Crikey, you guys are getting all mixed up.  REST is defined by
my dissertation.  REST is not defined by the TAG discussion or
the W3C&#39;s Webarch document or TimBL&#39;s design notes.  REST is an
architectural style, not the Web architecture.  Please try
to keep the terminology consistent.

REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.
REST merely requires that actions be applied to an identified resource,
and that identification be in the form of a resource identifier (rather
than, for example, a sequence of events).  Obviously, if you do not
have an identifier for a given resource, then you cannot interact
with it directly in REST, which means you can&#39;t do things like share
that specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form
of audit reference (you can&#39;t do that anyway -- you need all of the
information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,
method, authentication token, etc.).

That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,
conversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect
actions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are
trade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued
resource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more
specific resource before further actions take place, but both are
fully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be
vague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly
when a component has yet to determine the specific URI.
