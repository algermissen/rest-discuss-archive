&gt; Thinking about this a little more, I have a question I&#39;d like  
&gt; clarified.
&gt;
&gt; We talked about unique naming and how there shouldn&#39;t be /resource.xml
&gt; and /resource.json, but rather /resource and two representations based
&gt; on the Accept header.

Actually, there should be all three if you want a negotiated resource.
It is important to understand that these are three *different*
resources (resource != file).  Each identifier corresponds to a
unique semantic and mapping over time.

&gt; But in hindsight, what&#39;s the difference between
&gt;
&gt; GET /resource.xml
&gt; GET /resource.json
&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; GET /resource
&gt; Accept: application/xml
&gt;
&gt; GET /resource
&gt; Accept: application/json
&gt;
&gt; Semantically, the queries can be identical. Logically, one would
&gt; ASSUME they&#39;re identical.

The former are requests on two different resources.  The latter
are two varying requests on one resource.  The only difference,
in my opinion, is that the single varying resource makes for a
better bookmark because it is less susceptible to both
differences in user agent capabilities (different accept lists)
and changes in supported media types over time.  It is not,
however, a replacement for the media-specific resources and
their corresponding URIs.

A better protocol would tell the client the available variants
and how to get them, preferably in a way that doesn&#39;t impact
latency (trailers).  Yes, that was in HTTP/1.1&#39;s original design.

The media-specific resources are also useful for the apps
that don&#39;t want to negotiate, especially those performing
remote authoring or versioning.
