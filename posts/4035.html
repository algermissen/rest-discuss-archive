&gt; What I did not understand was that on the one hand REST says that the
&gt; naming authority decides what the resource is that a given URI 
&gt; identifies
&gt; and that on the other hand people on this list said that the user of
&gt; a URI (the link maker) decides what resource it identifies.
&gt;
&gt; Then I understood you to say that
&gt;
&gt; - a URI (directly) identifies the one resource that the naming 
&gt; authority
&gt;   decides it to identify.
&gt;
&gt; - a URI (may) **indirectly** identify other resources depending on the
&gt;   intention of the URI-user (the link-maker)

It would be better to say that the link-maker is indirectly identifying
other resources (for which he is ignorant of a better URI, if any)
through use of a URI that seems to result in what he wants when it
is used.  Whether or not his intended resource is, in fact, the one
identified by the URI (by means of the owner maintaining the mapping)
is unknown to that link-maker.

It gets worse: over time, if the majority of link-makers have a 
different
opinion about the nature of the resource being identified than the 
owner,
they might change the owner&#39;s opinion as well.  [oh, you mention that 
later]

&gt; I haven&#39;t seen the idea of URIs indirectly identifying resources used 
&gt; in
&gt; the context of REST before, that&#39;s why I asked what you (or REST) mean 
&gt; by
&gt; it.

Hmm, well, from my point of view, the idea that &quot;http&quot; URIs are ever
used to directly identify anything is a bit absurd.  The interface is
there to hide the nature of what is behind it, and it cannot do that
very well if the clients have to know what it is.

&gt; The practical problem I have is this:
&gt;
&gt; The moment a user agent sends a request to the origin server, any 
&gt; &#39;indirection
&gt; information&#39; is lost due to REST&#39;s unique addressing context. 
&gt; Certainly,
&gt; the origin server &#39;knows&#39; what resource the URI (directly) identifies 
&gt; because
&gt; that is controlled by the naming authority. But all intermediaries 
&gt; have no way
&gt; of seeing/accessing any information about indirection in 
&gt; identification.

The server doesn&#39;t know either -- it relies on the human maintainer to 
know
well enough to set up the correct mechanism for the mapping.

&gt; I read about the idea (thanks Mark!) that intermediaries can provide
&gt; information about the resources that the URIs identify they see in 
&gt; requests
&gt; &#39;running through&#39; them and weave that information into the 
&gt; representation
&gt; returned to the user agent. It was then that I understood the 
&gt; advantages of
&gt; a unique addressing context, because the intermediary knows that a 
&gt; given
&gt; URI unambiguously identifies a single resource.
&gt;
&gt; Given the idea of &#39;indirect identification&#39; the question arises, how
&gt; intermediaries can usefully enhance representations with information 
&gt; they
&gt; obtained, for example, from an RDF document.

They can only state what they know, and that very carefully.  Just like
real life, an intermediary must either state only what it has observed
in the past, or state its predictions on the future in terms that make
clear they are only guesses based on past observations.

&gt; I like the collaboration idea, which seems to come down to the 
&gt; possibility
&gt; that many *indirect* identifications can affect/alter a naming 
&gt; authority&#39;s
&gt; decision about the *direct* identification. Wonder how intermediaries 
&gt; can
&gt; contribute to this process.

That is one of the main weaknesses of HTTP -- there is no way for a
proxy to distinguish between authoritative responses and ones that
it cooked up on its own.

I&#39;ll be in England this week, so no more from me on this thread.
