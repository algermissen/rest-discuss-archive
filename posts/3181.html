&gt; Isn&#39;t the whole point of REST that URIs should be

No, the point of REST is to model a Web service.  It wouldn&#39;t be 
complete
if it neglected to include query parameters.  However, it works best 
when
query parameters are only used read-only and result in a list of
metadata and specific resource identifiers.  You can then do more 
complex
operations on those identifiers.

&gt; Regarding what I am trying to do, I want to expose
&gt; a mailfolder via HTTP.  Three things may happen
&gt; to this mailfolder:
&gt;
&gt; * The server may choose to move attachments to
&gt;    external URLs
&gt; * The server may change those external URLs
&gt; * New messages may be added to the folder
&gt; Note: Messages will not be deleted from the folder.
&gt;
&gt; I want clients:
&gt; 1. to be able to rertrieve the entire folder
&gt; 2. to be able to retreive only messages that have
&gt;    been added to the folder without retrieving
&gt;    already received messages whose representations
&gt;    have changed
&gt;
&gt; I would like to have a large number of anonymous
&gt; clients so I don&#39;t want to force the server to
&gt; maintain a state for each client (as required by
&gt; &#39;mark and move&#39; servers).

So, you are talking netnews, not mail.  That means the client has to
keep a list of read messages, not the server, and the list should be
by ordered number (the easiest choice given what you describe and
how all news readers work).

&gt; My proposed solution is to return
&gt; multipart/byteranges as a response to queries with
&gt; etags.  I suppose I could also return any diff
&gt; format, but I&#39;m not aware of one that is
&gt; particularly better suited to this problem than
&gt; multipart/byteranges.
&gt;
&gt; Is the consensus that this is HTTP-OK, and if so
&gt; what is the correct status code to return?

No, it is not HTTP okay because you allow the server to change the
file.  Neither etag nor byteranges will work.  In any case, this design
would tie the client implementation to the server storage 
implementation,
which is just a bad idea in general.  You should separate the two and
think of each message as a resource within a collection (the mailbox).
The client will then have to remember what has been read if they
wish to selectively retrieve messages.
