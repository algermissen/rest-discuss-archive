&gt; &gt;The correct quote is
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I hope I haven&#39;t given offense by editing your words. :-(

Editing is fine if you don&#39;t change the meaning in the process.

&gt; &gt;A resource is a membership function. A membership function is not  
&gt; a set.
&gt; &gt;The value of that function for a given time t is a set. The  
&gt; resource is
&gt; &gt;the continuity of those values over time, not the value at any given
&gt; &gt;instant in time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; You know this, I know this, everyone here should know this, but my  
&gt; audience
&gt; consists of people who do not know this. The problem I have here,  
&gt; is how to
&gt; lead into _any_ analogy in a way which doesn&#39;t stop people here at  
&gt; the first
&gt; paragraph, yet also doesn&#39;t stop my intended audience at the very  
&gt; first
&gt; paragraph. Your dissertation and your analogy are &quot;whole&quot;, but  
&gt; that&#39;s not
&gt; always the best strategy for teaching difficult concepts to those  
&gt; with only
&gt; an intermediate level of knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; What I&#39;m trying for is &quot;whole-part-whole&quot;, since everyone&#39;s  
&gt; starting place is
&gt; the dissertation. I don&#39;t think those who fail to grasp it are  
&gt; incapable of
&gt; learning REST, I think they need some help, by breaking resource/
&gt; representation down into a simplified &quot;part&quot; which may be modeled  
&gt; using Venn
&gt; diagrams, which may then be used to build the knowledge level of  
&gt; the target
&gt; audience back up to &quot;whole&quot;.

I don&#39;t think you were even close.  If you want to teach someone about
web architecture, then you can give concrete examples that some people
may find easier to understand.  If you want to teach someone about REST,
then you have to at least be consistent with the principles of REST
as they have been defined.  All you are teaching people is a very
confused model of fruit placement, and there is zero chance that they
will learn anything meaningful about REST when your whole example
ignores time.

Time is the single most important aspect of REST as an architectural
style.  All of the constraints are designed to moderate the effects
of a changing environment over time, enable independent evolution,
and reduce latency.  All of the benefits from REST-based design can
only be seen when a system is exposed to change over time.

REST is not about design-in-the-small.  It can&#39;t be taught by looking
at a single implementation at an instant in time any more than you can
teach swimming without talking about the nature of water.  The analogy
has to be representative of the subject being taught.

&gt; Yes, it does, by design. With a copy of &quot;How to Keep Your  
&gt; Volkswagen Alive:
&gt; A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&quot;, some  
&gt; tools and a
&gt; VW Beetle I can teach a 16-year-old how to set the timing on any  
&gt; vehicle with
&gt; a mechanical points-and-condenser ignition system, even a Zamboni.  
&gt; He&#39;d be
&gt; helpless faced with a modern electronic ignition system with computer-
&gt; controlled variable timing -- that takes some advanced study.
&gt;
&gt; The book I mention explains the concept of &quot;internal-combustion  
&gt; automobile
&gt; engine&quot; by considering one simplistic implementation, an air-cooled  
&gt; VW boxer
&gt; four. The procedures and explanations fundamentally apply to modern  
&gt; internal-
&gt; combustion auto engines, even the ones which seem laughable by today&#39;s
&gt; standards -- like setting the timing with a timing light, a wrench,  
&gt; and a
&gt; feeler guage for the &quot;points&quot;. The marginalia cartoons are a  
&gt; classic touch.

That&#39;s because a VW Beetle contains an implementation of an internal
combustion engine.  You can learn a lot by looking at an example of
an abstract concept.  However, as I was saying, a resource is not a
box of apples.  It isn&#39;t even close.  At most you could say that a
resource is a store where you can expect to buy apples.  At least then
the student will understand the value of it being a resource: a source
of future representations, not a specific set of representations at
any given instant in time.
