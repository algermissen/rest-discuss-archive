&gt;&gt;&gt; I have to admit it seems odd to send an ETag along with a response

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ETag is not an entity-header. ETag provides information about the
&gt;&gt; resource, not the current message, so it is orthogonal to cache
&gt;&gt; control.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hmm. How else might an ETag be used other than determining if a  
&gt; cached entity is still current?

The ETag *header field* is a response header.  The entity-tag value
contained within that header field may be used in *later* requests
for cache-related conditionals, like If-None-Match and If-Match.

The entity tag is actually metadata about the internal resource
mapping on the server -- it does not necessarily reflect anything
about the content (other than the premise that the value must
change whenever the content is changed).  That is why it doesn&#39;t
matter which status code is used or what content is supplied in
the response message, since the Etag is referring to the mapping
operation rather than the content of *this* message.  Hence, the
ETag provided in a 201 response must be the entity-tag of the
mapping result after completing the resource-changing operation.

It is a tricky thing to understand, and the spec does a poor job
of explaining it.
