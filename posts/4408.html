As I said before, bidirectional communication is a security issue
for general purpose servers.  It should be obvious that the folks
who write general purpose servers will distribute them with the
safe defaults turned on instead of the &quot;please shoot me, I don&#39;t
know what I&#39;m doing&quot; configuration.  That doesn&#39;t prevent anyone
with legitimate access to the server from designing, developing,
and deploying a web service based on REST-style interaction.
It isn&#39;t supposed to be available by default.
