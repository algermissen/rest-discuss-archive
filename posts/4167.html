&gt; My hunch is that those are the same; that less implementation
&gt; flexibility yields more predictable forms of attack.  Or perhaps you
&gt; had some more general concern in mind?

That may be true as well, but I was referring to human factors:
WWW server developers are far more paranoid than DBAs because they
get abused when they aren&#39;t paranoid enough.  Databases, in contrast,
are sold by feature list, just like a word processor.  The WWW server
(or firewall) is supposed to protect the DB from the real world.
