REST has a single agreed theory of naming.  Web arch=

not have a single agreed theory of naming because there is no=
 single
definition of the Web.

&gt; Instead of having arguments over philosph=
ical positions I think
&gt; it&#39;s perfectly ok for us at the REST/HTTP/L7 level=
 to say some things
&gt; cannot be said. Going from a resource identifier to a=
 resource is an
&gt; inherently ambiguous act.

The REST position is that noth=
ing can be said about what happens
behind the interface aside from what the=
 other side says.  It isn&#39;t
ambiguous -- it is downright denial.  Think of =
it as communicating
through a videophone -- you can make all the expression=
s you like, but
you can&#39;t control what the other person does with those exp=
ressions
(or even prevent the person from being replaced by an avatar).  Al=
l
you can do is express your intentions and accept the responses in
good fa=
ith.  In other words, you give up personal control in exchange
for the abil=
ity to talk to people you hardly know, based on the
theory that it is in th=
eir best interests to do what you want even
if it isn&#39;t exactly what you ex=
pect.
