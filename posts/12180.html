&gt; Perhaps the Netflix API would be considered RESTful, but should we  
&gt; be able to discover ALL of the links like Roy Fielding suggests?    
&gt; He did say straight out that &quot;there can be only one&quot; when it comes  
&gt; to bookmarks.  Is he putting forth an impossible constraint on data- 
&gt; driven APIs with that rule, or is there more that can be done to  
&gt; implement that constraint?
&gt;

I think you misread that.  There might be many different entry points
to an application, each of which is bookmarkable.  The point was that
the client only needs to know one of them, not that there is only
one of them to know.
