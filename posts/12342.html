&gt; The REST approach to having a client request the deletion of all  
&gt; members
&gt; of a collection, is for the server to instruct the client to call the
&gt; DELETE method of each member resource in turn.
&gt;

No, that is only one of many ways.  The most common is to define a
resource that has the semantics of all members of the collection
and apply DELETE to that one resource.  The simplest is to just
delete the collection.
