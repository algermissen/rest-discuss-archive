&gt;&gt; Yes. A RESTful interface is one where the server=
 provides the links
&gt;&gt; or forms that tells the client what operations to pe=
rform where.
&gt;&gt; If you are telling the client to do the wrong thing, then t=
he
&gt;&gt; pattern would be to tell the client to do the right thing instead.
&gt;&gt;=
 
&gt; 
&gt; All that is very well in a perfect world, but what if the client is =
of a malicious nature, and it&#39;s nature lead him to overcome what the server=
 provides, by issuing a request that he may learned from introspection of a=
nother application state?

How is that relevant to type safety?  The only d=
ifference between
a strongly typed distributed system and a weakly typed di=
stributed
system is that the former gives the attacker one more thing to li=
e
about.

The input has to be validated no matter how or where it has been =
defined.
