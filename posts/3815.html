&gt; What&#39;s the difference between the Web and a distributed filesystem such
&gt; as Plan 9&#39;s 9P or Amoeba&#39;s Bullet File System?

A shared data model between client and server for directories,
metadata, and content.  Basically, the same as the difference
between REST and Alex&#39;s notion of MoST, which is why I said he
might as well use a distributed file system.

&gt; Who says distributed filesystems don&#39;t have generic interfaces?

Sorry, I should have said &quot;REST&#39;s definitions of resource and
representation&quot; rather than &quot;generic interface&quot;.  I was talking
about that specific interface, not the notion in general.
