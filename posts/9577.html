&gt; &gt; Umm, all REST theory that I know about prevents you from knowing
&gt; &gt; the extent to which one resource state is overlapped with other
&gt; &gt; resources. In other words, the normal case is for many resources
&gt; &gt; to share the same or overlapping state
&gt;
&gt; I don&#39;t quite get this. Do you make a distinction between two
&gt; resources whose state happens to have the same value, and two
&gt; resources who share the same state?

Yes, but not in that example.

&gt; If I have two clocks, A and B, I can set them to have the same time.
&gt; Maybe A is simulating traveling at the speed of light, so gradually A
&gt; and B no longer have the same time. So initially the state happened to
&gt; have the same value.
&gt;
&gt; Or I can synchronize A and B to the same time. And by this I want to
&gt; mean that if I reset B, A will be reset too. This sounds like shared
&gt; state. But then I would think that there is a third resource, C. I
&gt; have set C to a particular time, and set A and B to refer to C. Which
&gt; means there is no shared state at all.
&gt;
&gt; Or maybe I am completely missing the point.

I think you missed the point.  You can have a single clock resource.
A single &quot;minute-hand&quot; resource.  A single &quot;minutes-in-decimal&quot;
resource.  A single &quot;hour-hand&quot; resource. ...  The state that
is being shared is the common time model.  If you change the
&quot;minute-hand&quot; resource, it will have a side-effect on the
&quot;minutes-in-decimal&quot; resource state and the &quot;clock&quot; state.
If you change the clock state, it will probably result in changes
to all the other resource states.  This is all normal and expected
by the REST model, even though REST only talks about one resource
at a time.  The interconnected states are not visible to the client
because it doesn&#39;t need to know they exist (and not knowing is
the best way to avoid coupling between implementations).
