&gt; There are enough smart people supporting the rest position to make
&gt; it worth exploring, but the &#39;dummies guide&#39; articles are pretty
&gt; thin on the ground? I&#39;ve failed to find comprehensible demonstrations
&gt; of a simple use of rest.

A Web browser is a simple use of REST.

&gt; Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why so few understand it.

That doesn&#39;t seem likely.  I think that if I were in the business of
selling REST as an idea, just as thousands of consultants have sold
OOSD/CORBA/COM/DCOM/WS, one after another, then a lot of people would
know about something called REST (though it would be a bit mangled).

Software development is still driven by fads and fashion.  In order
to become well known, you need to hire some sexy models and generate
press.  Personally, I&#39;d rather that people just learn a little more
about software architecture and principled design.
