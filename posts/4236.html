&gt; If you have isolation, GET on a public resource

Nope.

&gt; For example:
&gt;
&gt;   GET URI1
&gt;   OPEN TRANSACTION
&gt;   GET URI1
&gt;   PUT URI2 VALUE
&gt;   PUT URI3 VALUE
&gt;   COMMIT
&gt;
&gt; The first GET has no effect on the outcome of the
&gt; transtion.  The second GET changes the state of
&gt; the transaction.  In particular, the result of the
&gt; GET is that the transaction may fail may cause the
&gt; subsequent sequence of actions to fail (if URI1
&gt; changes before the second PUT).

Nope.  As far as I can tell, you are just inventing transaction
semantics that don&#39;t exist.  Transaction success or failure
depends on whether the server can cause the combined state change
requested by those requests, as a whole, to take effect on the
server as a result of the commit.  The only requests that matter
to the transaction processor are the ones that verify preconditions
and those that change state.  If the client places a precondition
on the GET request, then that is what they want.
