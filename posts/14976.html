&gt;&gt; IIRC, the multi-market problem is known to be intractable
&gt;&gt; even for strict transaction protocols.  We end up doing the

&gt;&gt; separation of inventory between sites (with periodic rebalancing
&gt;&gt; of inventory as stocks decrease).
&gt; 
&gt; You don&#39;t think notifications would work?  Or do you think of them as
&gt; compensating transactions?

Message (distributed) notifications or database notifications?
They might work -- it depends on how fast the orders are being
processed and how reliable the delivery.  Notification-based
systems tend to fail spectacularly at peak times, and are
usually overkill during non-peak times.   *shrug*  There&#39;s a
good chance that you could build a good enough system for family
farms using nothing more than email.

&gt; I&#39;m thinking, by the way, that one resource gets nominated by the
&gt; farmer as their inventory resource, and the other markets just display
&gt; a representation and then send an update to the inventory resource,
&gt; which could respond with an over-order notice.

I thought the sites were independent.  Yes, a single inventory
resource accessed by both sites should be fine as long as the
state changing requests are queued by the implementation.
The implementation of that resource could even be an atomic
test+decrement.  But how are you going to teach the markets
to use such a resource?

&gt;&gt;  I think the farmer could
&gt;&gt; be provided with a RESTful application for tracking and
&gt;&gt; rebalancing inventory across multiple sites, but I wouldn&#39;t
&gt;&gt; call that a RESTful solution to the inventory problem itself.
&gt;&gt; It just works well enough to keep the farmer happy.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Well enough&quot; is all I need.  Farming is like that, too.
&gt; 
&gt; But all the separation and rebalancing would have to happen
&gt; automatically, without farmer involvement.  So one inventory resource
&gt; consumed by multiple markets is an attractive idea, if it can work.

Yes, if you can make the markets use a shared resource that
is much easier.  If not, then it should also be possible to
automate a balancer even if the farmer&#39;s interface to the
markets is two different web pages.   You could then provide
the farmer with mash-up interface that treats the markets as
gateways.
