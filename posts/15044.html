&gt; Sorry to double check on this image, but IMHO, images are a very good me=
an to transport abstract things like REST to customers. So, it&#39;d prefer to =
have things clear.
&gt; So, you&#39;re suggesting that you are the server, the fri=
sbee is the request, and the dog is the client?

No, I was suggesting that =
the customer should not be
seeking RPC solutions (like type-safety checks) =
to apply
in a RESTful design where data is provided at the direct
instructi=
on of the server.  The scenario doesn&#39;t make
any sense, unless of course th=
e client isn&#39;t using REST
at all and merely thinks that HTTP =3D=3D REST.

=
&gt; This just raises me one question. How would you flag to the client a link=
 that is cool and MAY BE persisted, versus one that is of transient nature?=
 

I would never use a transient link in the first place.
Even my redirect =
links are persistent.  Why do you need one?
