These are not all-or-nothing properties.  For example, there is caching
on the user agent with authentication (default is private, not no-cache)
and only one of the representations need be access-controlled; anything
it refers to (stylesheets, images, javascript, etc.) could be on  
separate
servers with public access.

What we lose with authentication is shared caching of the authenticated
representations.  That may reduce scalability, but it doesn&#39;t remove
it altogether.
