&gt; I don&#39;t understand why you class that as gymnastics.

Because I&#39;ve written HTTP clients and HTTP servers.

If the server assumes that every content type is a variant of
a single resource instead of a representation, then clients are
unable to replace an HTML representation with an XML representation.

In order for the client to present an accurate user interface
for authoring a negotiated resource, it would have to know all of
the potential media types that might be representations for a given
resource. Not just the ones that are valid now, but all of those
that might ever be valid.

In contrast, if you design the system such that negotiated URIs
cannot be authored (they redirect using 300 instead), then the
client doesn&#39;t need to know in advance how the resource is
implemented.  If the server receives an XML replacement for a
negotiated URI, it can redirect to the media-specific URI for XML.
If the server receives the same for a non-negotiated URI, it can
simply replace the current representation and respond with 200.

That way, the client gets informed of the URIs for the other
specific resources that it might need to author or delete.

Note that there is yet another resource in effect here, and
that is the one that tells the server how to map each resource
to a set of representations.  That can be authored as well
if we give it a URI of its own.

&gt; Doing it this way gives the server the chance to say: sorry, that
&gt; representation isn&#39;t supported by me (if the user submitted something
&gt; un-indexable perhaps).

Why would anyone want such a feature?

&gt; Of course, I&#39;d be pretty annoyed if I&#39;d just typed war and peace into
&gt; a text box and the server said that.

I&#39;d be pretty annoyed by the text box. ;-)  HTML forms are not a
good editing environment and HTTP certainly isn&#39;t limited to them.
MS Word writes directly to web folders which is just another
HTTP client library (with bugs).
