&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks to everyone for your great feedback. It helped a lot!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The final slides are uploaded here:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://doc.opengarden.org/REST/Introduction_to_REST
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is missing one slide. I&#39;d point out which one, but I am curious
&gt;&gt; if anyone else can figure out what is missing from the description.
&gt;
&gt; What is &quot;Hypermedia is the engine of application state&quot;?

Yep.

&gt;&gt; I am especially curious because almost every presentation that
&gt;&gt; tries to describe REST leaves the same bits out, and I am wondering
&gt;&gt; if it is because I explained it poorly in my dissertation or if it
&gt;&gt; is simply hard to understand why it is essential to the style.
&gt;
&gt; It&#39;s hard to apply in the machine-to-machine, replacement-for-RPC  
&gt; case,
&gt; which is where many people really want to use REST.  If the client  
&gt; isn&#39;t
&gt; a user-agent, but is instead a knowledgeable actor in the domain,  
&gt; it can
&gt; be out of place for the server to tell it what links to traverse, and
&gt; what forms look like, rather than the client just constructing the  
&gt; links
&gt; and building the &quot;form-response&quot; from out-of-band knowledge.  It&#39;s  
&gt; extra
&gt; overhead.  While essential in the large-scale, evolutionary-web
&gt; situation, it&#39;s wasted on the smaller-scale &quot;I know that I want to  
&gt; make
&gt; a version 1.1 &#39;POST shoppingCartItemAddition&#39; request of
&gt; ShoppingCartFormat 2.7&quot;.

Umm, no, it is essential to eliminate the coupling between client
and server.  If the application doesn&#39;t follow the workflow defined
by the representations that are received, then the application isn&#39;t
using the REST style.  Not even a little bit.  It is using RPC plus
streaming, with a rather inefficient syntax, and the client will
break each time the server&#39;s application evolves because the client
must be anticipating the server&#39;s state based on its own assumptions.
In other words, the two are coupled by their original design.

REST simplifies applications because it rips apart the million
potential states inherent in any serious application and presents
to the client only one at a time, with every single transition
from that state described in a format that can be understood by
the client as a potential transition.  The client is completely
decoupled from the server aside from the shared agreement on what
each media type means.  The entire application only needs to be
understood (and can be completely tested) one state at a time.

The only difference between machine-to-machine interaction and
human-browser interaction is the choice of media types and the
degree to which the potential transitions are described by those
types. A browser knows the difference between an anchor and an
in-line image because the media type standard defines that difference.
It doesn&#39;t have to ask the user each time whether they want a
given relationship to be treated as an in-line image, stylesheet,
javascript, atom subscription, or any of the other relationships
that are automated with even browser-based hypermedia.  A pure
machine-to-machine simply automates all transitions based on
some predefined (or adaptive) criteria that is evaluated for
each representation received.

Hypermedia means the placement of controls within the presentation
of information -- it is not just a GUI paradigm.

&gt; As for the slides, I&#39;d not label it a &quot;design pattern&quot;.  As I
&gt; understand, architecture sets up the constraints of a solution  
&gt; space in
&gt; a context, and design expresses a more specific class of technical
&gt; solution within those constraints.

Pattern is, unfortunately, an overused term.  There are some
architectural patterns which are essentially the same as styles,
but most of the design patterns are simply language idioms.  The
software research folks call the former styles, whereas the
OOPL research folks chose to call just about everything a design
pattern.  The funny thing is that Christopher Alexander&#39;s work
defined patterns based on common living patterns (more like our
view of software data flows over time), not recipes for builders,
so OOPL design patterns have always been a bit of an oddity.
They are both important, but architecture should be about how
the system works when it is running, not how to structure code.
