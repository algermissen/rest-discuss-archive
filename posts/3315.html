&gt; MessageTrue.  However, I feel that the caching limitation only applies 
&gt; to
&gt; intermediaries.  Otherwise, the verb would be practically useless.  You
&gt; could certainly use a 303 as well, but the only advantage I see to 
&gt; that is
&gt; allowing intermediaries to cache the response.
&gt;
&gt; Hey, Roy:  if you happen to read this, what is your take on this?  Is
&gt; OPTIONS supposed to be non-cachable for everyone or just 
&gt; intermediaries?

It is only non-cacheable by default.  Use cache-control to change that.

The Web had a notion of external links, but nobody could agree on the
HTTP syntax so it didn&#39;t make the cut.  WebDAV added properties.

Adding a new header field to every GET response would increase latency
for no benefit to the common case and only marginal benefit to the
applications being discussed.  It is therefore more efficient to have
the client request that information only when it is desired.
