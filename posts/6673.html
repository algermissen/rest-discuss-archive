&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I understand that the URI spec considers these as different
&gt; &gt; identifiers. Can someone illuminate the rationale behind this?
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;d expect because it simplifies handling relative references if
&gt; hierarchy is explicitly indicated. After all, &quot;foo&quot; resolved relative
&gt; to the former would-be-URI is &quot;/foo&quot;, while &quot;/something/foo&quot; to the
&gt; latter.

And access control might be different.  Note that access control
might be enforced anywhere in the request chain, not just at the
origin server (which might theoretically know what the difference
is between those two resources).  Even proxy choices can be based
on URI paths.
