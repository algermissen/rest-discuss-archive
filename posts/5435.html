&gt; That is, I believe the single most useful way to improve

Sure, but interoperability is only one property we want to get
out of a system.  Evolvability and extensibility are others,
as is ...

&gt; Obviously if you go too far in this direction you get something
&gt; useless.  Hence, Einstein&#39;s dictum:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Keep things as simple as possible -- but no simpler!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; That&#39;s why for me the question is, &quot;What is the simplest thing that
&gt; could *possibly* work?&quot;

simplicity.  Take care not to assume one property is all-important,
since that will blind you to the trade-offs inherent in principled
design.

&gt; That&#39;s why I like the idea of specifying REST APIs simply as &lt;form&gt;
&gt; -- if its rich enough for the human web, it ought to be rich enough  
&gt; for the machine-readable web.

REST is an architectural style.  Please come up with a different
name for your implementation so that you don&#39;t confuse the heck
out of people like me trying to understand it.  REST cannot
have an API.  XForms, SOAP, and XML over HTTP are technologies
that can used with services that have an API.
