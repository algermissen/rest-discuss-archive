&gt; That is, assuming that I were to implement cookie authentication with 
&gt; some
&gt; kind of secure token not requiring any server state, and Cookie was a 
&gt; part
&gt; of the HTTP standard, and proxies were to treat Cookie similarly to 
&gt; how they
&gt; treat Authorization for caching, would such use of cookies be 
&gt; consistent
&gt; with REST? It would be almost like having a Set-Authorization response
&gt; header that could be returned from posting a login form, giving the
&gt; credentials that should be returned by the client on subsequent
&gt; requests.
&gt; Does that make any sense?

You should note that there is no design reason why Authorization
and WWW-Authenticate are limited to Basic and Digest.  That is why
those fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that
functionality in another field?
