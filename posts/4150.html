&gt; Initiating a transaction really creates a new view of the entire
&gt; resource space, so it makes sense that any resources accessed
&gt; within the transaction would be accessed at URIs hierarchically
&gt; subordinate to the URI of the transaction itself. However,
&gt; munging the existing URIs on the client is undesirable. Also, any
&gt; relative URIs inside the representations of those various
&gt; resources may be thrown off; the server would have to introspect
&gt; the representations it&#39;s returning and munge any URIs therein
&gt; itself, and the client would have to be disciplined about only
&gt; following URIs returned from the server (or built according to
&gt; rules returned from the server, as for an HTML form submission),
&gt; and emphatically not constructing URIs itself -- but then that&#39;s
&gt; just good REST sense, anyway.

I would never munge the request URI -- that just won&#39;t work in the
long term, once you consider the effect of proxies and multi-site
transactions.  And if you superset the URI space, then questions
come up about whether the new space has been checked-out, locked,
and/or has the same access control and handlers.  Yikes.

This topic has come up a few times on webdav and http-wg lists.
The transaction is a resource, but the relationship between it and
the requested resource can be accomplished via a header field that
defines each request as a sequenced resource within a hierarchical
transaction.  In other words, ask the server for a transaction begin,
send the URI it gives the client in each request as a header field
with a request number appended to it, and finally abort or commit
the transaction as a final request to the transaction&#39;s URI.  That&#39;s
basically how I did it for the still-vapor waka protocol.
