&gt;&gt; Whoa, I think this is a case of reading too much into my

&gt;&gt; The sites that I produce *always* separate languages into separate

&gt; Are you saying that this is the right way to do it or are you saying
&gt; that we need to do it this way because we dont have much of an option
&gt; given the current infrastructure?

I am saying that server-driven negotiation doesn&#39;t work very well
because different language editions are different resources and
deserve their own URIs.  It results in the problems that were already
described and quoted by Bill.

Agent-driven negotiation is far more effective, but there was a huge
disagreement between myself and the chair of the HTTP working group
and my original agent-driven design for HTTP/1.1 was effectively
buried in committee.

To do negotiation right, the client needs to be aware of all the
alternatives *and* what it should use as a bookmark.  In HTTP/1.1,
all we managed to standardize is 300 and Vary.  We needed Alternates
and Link to make it work.

&gt;&gt; the fact is that different languages do not produce equivalents.
&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of nuances, colloquialisms, and shared social
&gt;&gt; norms that simply do not translate.  We encourage resource owners
&gt;&gt; to only use true content negotiation (without redirects) when the
&gt;&gt; only difference between formats is mechanical in nature.
&gt;
&gt; Are you saying that true content negotiation should only be done for
&gt; stuff like changing formats (like when you have a base XML and you
&gt; convert it into PDF, HTML, etc.) and not for languages?

I am saying that all important resources must have URIs.
