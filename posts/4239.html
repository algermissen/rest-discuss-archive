&gt; If the transaction-as-a-whole is to have ACID semantics, and the
&gt; client sends some POST, PUT, or DELETE requests based on the
&gt; responses to some GET requests, such that the client would not
&gt; have performed the same sequence of POST, PUT, or DELETE requests
&gt; given different responses to those GET requests, then the fact of
&gt; having sent those GET requests is an important part of the
&gt; transaction&#39;s state. If another client in another transaction
&gt; sends some sequence of POST, PUT, or DELETE requests such that
&gt; the GET requests sent by the first client would have resulted in
&gt; different responses, then those two client transactions are in
&gt; conflict: If both transactions commit, the state of all the
&gt; resources together will not be what either transaction intended.

So, what you are saying is that a transaction via HTTP will only
have ACID semantics if actions that are dependent on prior GETs
include the etag in If-Match (or an equivalent precondition).
I&#39;ll buy that -- it is the only sensible implementation even
when transactions are not involved.

&gt; Such conflicts are commonly prevented by acquiring non-exclusive
&gt; locks on queried data or detected by remembering what data was
&gt; queried and verifying that it has not changed at commit time.

Yep.

&gt; Standard stuff, and stateful either way.

Huh?  It is only stateful (by the common meaning in architecture)
if the server is tracking what requests the client makes and
answers accordingly.  The transaction resource is building state on
the server and the client is holding state in the form of entity
tags, but the individual interactions are stateless.
