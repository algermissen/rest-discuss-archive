&gt;     Taisuke&gt; Hi. I&#39;ve been following this REST vs. &quot;document style&quot;
&gt;     Taisuke&gt; SOAP debate (I assume RPC style is dead on both sides),
&gt;     Taisuke&gt; and I&#39;m starting to think one of the advantages of REST
&gt;     Taisuke&gt; is that you can actually create a hybrid web service that
&gt;     Taisuke&gt; both human and machine can handle.
&gt;
&gt; 1. RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.

He said &quot;document style&quot; SOAP, which is a reference to the interaction
style described in the SOAP 1.2 specs.  SOAP 1.1 is RPC.  SOAP 1.2 is
a bunch of things.  REST is not a form of RPC.

&gt; 2. REST is about server holds state is stateless, with SOAP you can do
&gt;    that, but its not a dogma.

REST is an architectural style that is only present when all of its
constraints are met.  SOAP is a protocol.

&gt; 3. So REST versus SOAP is a meaningless distinction.

Yes, but he wasn&#39;t talking about SOAP.  He was talking about one of
the interaction styles described by the SOAP specifications.

&gt; 4. REST is about resources that you can access by an URI. No
&gt;    implication that it is better or easier human or machine readable.

Having the URI makes it possible for both human and machine-driven
interaction.  He is right -- that is one of the advantages of REST-style
applications, and it is used every day in the form of bookmarks.
However, the document-style interactions in SOAP 1.2 do allow for
the server to provide a URI, so the advantage only exists over those
SOAP 1.2 resources that are poorly implemented (i.e., all of them).
