Hi Dave,

The best way is to have the query do just that -- present a list
of query results.  If you actually want it to direct the client to
a single match, then send a redirect to that match.  The resources
themselves should be independently named from any query that you do,
even if that means simply redirecting them to something dull like

    /Artist/id/12345678
