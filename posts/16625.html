&gt; Hello Sean=
.
&gt; I work on academia too. But I teach Software Architecture fundamentals.=

&gt; 
&gt; So, I mention REST simple as an example in many of the class sessions=
, and I have one just devoted to explain the constrains and actually to wip=
e the idea of REST as an easy Web Service engine.
&gt; 
&gt; But, I do not start =
in any of the two explanations you just mentioned. I actually start with Ch=
apter 4. My students already know what an architectural style is and also m=
any of the properties. Chapter 4 explains what properties and requirements =
the Web had. It helps a lot to understand why the constrains, and also help=
s to build up criteria to choose REST for an app or not. 
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, chapter=
 2 ( 2.3 Architectural Properties of Key Interest) may be confused with the=
 actual properties of the web. Be careful with that. Section 2.3 lists the =
properties that are somehow affected by the styles in chapter 3, and they a=
re properties that are generally important for Networked applications. The =
web is just one particular type of networked application, it is a large dis=
tributed hypermedia system. The particular requirements (and the ones REST =
in chapter 5 tries to fulfill) are in chapter 4. 

Yes, and you should note=
 that I only included those properties that are later
used in the explanati=
ons -- there are many more out there in the wild, just
as there are more po=
tential constraints (and styles).  I only had a finite
time to finish writi=
ng.

Last year, I found (via a link from Mark Nottingham) an excellent desc=
ription
of the design process.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find the book now (m=
oving sucks).
It is in the intro pages of the really big book by Charles & =
Ray Eames:

http://www.amazon.com/Eames-Design-John-Neuhart/dp/0810908794

=
and we are fortunate that Amazon&#39;s &quot;look inside&quot; feature includes it
(see p=
ages 13-15).

&gt; To me, the dissertation is an excellent real life example o=
f architecting, following a clear methodology to generate a style, and that=
 can be applied to other applications, but that doesn&#39;t mean all my next ap=
plications should be REST. Roy gives an example in the conclusions, REST is=
 optimized for large grain hypermedia transfer, if you have a computational=
 intensive system, REST may not be for you.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, I use REST=
 as an analytical example. I try not to teach it as a set of rules and cons=
trains.
&gt; Cheers!

Excellent summary.  Cheers,
