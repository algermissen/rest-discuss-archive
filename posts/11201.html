Or someone needs to be beaten over the head with an ABNF-based
validator.

It is painfully obvious, no matter how you look at it, that square
brackets are forbidden outside of IPv6 address delimiters.  They were
forbidden anywhere in a URI before the IPv6 groups screwed that up.
That&#39;s why we don&#39;t painstakingly list all the forbidden characters
any more -- because some idiots decided the fact that we listed them
meant that they were available for extensions.

&quot;each syntax rule lists the characters allowed within that component&quot;

&quot;URI scheme specifications must define their own
  syntax so that all strings matching their scheme-specific syntax will
  also match the &lt;absolute-URI&gt; grammar, as described in Section 4.3.&quot;

and for those who still can&#39;t read ABNF ...

    A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6
    [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal
    within square brackets (&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;).  This is the only place where
    square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.

How could I be any more clear that that?
