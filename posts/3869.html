&gt; The genius of ReST is its recognition of the value of a standardized
&gt; resource interface in a heterogeneous large scale networked 
&gt; environments
&gt; and its attempt to articulate such an interface.  Its tragic flaw is 
&gt; that
&gt; it did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface to
&gt; achieve the value it promised.  To be perfectly clear about the 
&gt; problem:
&gt;
&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the state 
&gt; of a
&gt; resource into a response to a GET request, a client can have 
&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO
&gt; IDEA what the content of that response means; it is simply has bits 
&gt; that
&gt; can mean anything at all.

What does &quot;mean&quot; mean in this context?

&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses 
&gt; PUT/POST-ed
&gt; content to change the state of a resource, a client can have 
&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO
&gt; IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.

That just says that REST doesn&#39;t mandate one single model.  Nothing
prevents the server from establishing a model and telling the client
what it is.  That is how hypertext works: the engine of application
state change.

&gt; Roy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary and 
&gt; specified
&gt; at the whim of the server operator on a per-URI basis.  I think these
&gt; models should be standardized in some manner and be URI independent.

They aren&#39;t entirely arbitrary; they are merely chosen by the server.
In some cases they will be selected from a standard (such as webdav).
In other cases they will be defined by an interface language (like 
WSDL).

&gt; Because Roy&#39;s resources are so abstract, access to them has to be 
&gt; mediated
&gt; by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.

Ah, so httpd modules must be gods.

&gt; Allowing clients to interact
&gt; with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then requires 
&gt; that
&gt; service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to have 
&gt; essentially
&gt; arbitrary meanings.

That doesn&#39;t follow at all.  Service operators control the 
implementation
of HTTP methods.  Methods get overloaded because service operators do 
want
additional semantics, but normal people don&#39;t know how to extend them 
and
implementers can&#39;t read protocol specs.  It is an artifact of the social
process surrounding standardized protocols.  You can&#39;t fix it by
forbidding the extension of methods.

&gt; But resources don&#39;t really need to be so abstract and the meanings of 
&gt; HTTP
&gt; methods don&#39;t need to be so loose.  Programs don&#39;t actually manipulate
&gt; &quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;non-virtual objects;&quot; they just manipulate bits.

Right.  It&#39;s people that manipulate concepts and non-virtual objects.

&gt;   It would
&gt; be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits
&gt; whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose 
&gt; meaning
&gt; is determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.

No it wouldn&#39;t, since such a definition ignores the ability of people
to anticipate changes that have not yet occurred.  Time is essential
to the meaning of a hypertext link, and thus the definition of resource.
HTTP servers store representations, not resources.

&gt;   To say
&gt; otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect 
&gt; between
&gt; having an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a 
&gt; server
&gt; notify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that 
&gt; there
&gt; is a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP
&gt; server itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the
&gt; Internet and interacting via HTTP.

Or simply that resource isn&#39;t what you think it means.

&gt; Viewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special*
&gt; hidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent 
&gt; mediates
&gt; access.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and 
&gt; across
&gt; the Internet can use any data structures they want for their 
&gt; activities but
&gt; that their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an 
&gt; HTTP
&gt; server as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for 
&gt; communication
&gt; between these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared 
&gt; *explicit
&gt; model* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be
&gt; changed.

The blackboard model is another architectural style with a lot of
interesting work associated with it.  Tuple-spaces use that.  The
problem with blackboards isn&#39;t just a lack of a data model;
they also have centralized identification and lack metadata.
