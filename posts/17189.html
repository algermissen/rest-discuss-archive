&gt; I still fail to see how both diametrically-opposed approaches can
&gt; possibly be based on the same thesis.  Roy&#39;s examples have never been
&gt; based on the creation of custom data/media types.  If REST were worded
&gt; in a completely different way than it is, and Roy&#39;s examples always
&gt; (instead of never) started with the creation of custom types, then I&#39;d
&gt; be wrong.  But, REST and Roy are both quite clear that the style is NOT
&gt; about creating custom media/data types, but is in fact the exact
&gt; opposite of that approach.

Do keep in mind that, in order to have an *evolving* set of standard
media types (and likewise standard link relations), there will have
to be new media types being created and old media types fading away
over time.

One person&#39;s experiment may well become another person&#39;s standard,
in the long run, and REST is very much about the long run.  So we
should consider new media types in terms of their long-term intent
rather than their immediate status.

Likewise, standards are a byproduct of authority.  WalMart, for
example, is fully capable of defining standards within its own
logistical network, so there are ecosystems in which the architectural
style being used can be REST even though the standards aren&#39;t the
same as those on the open Internet.
