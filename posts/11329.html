&gt;
&gt; I&#39;ve been doing a VERY close reading of Roy&#39;s thesis (ie searching for
&gt; every use of key terms used in the thesis), and I can&#39;t find any
&gt; constraint articulated in either the chart (mapping styles to
&gt; properties) or the graph (showing the derivation of REST from the null
&gt; architecture) that directly addresses link dereferencing issues.
&gt;
&gt; Certainly the composite style known as LCODC$SS does not constrain
&gt; link dereferencing. And the Uniform Interface constraint (composed of
&gt; the constraints identification of resources, manipulation of resources
&gt; through representations, self-descriptive messages, and HATEOAS) also
&gt; does not rule out centralized link servers.
&gt;
&gt; So is this actually an implicit constraint that should be made
&gt; explicit, or is there some existing constraint in the thesis the
&gt; clearly forbids centralized link servers.
&gt;

Don&#39;t confuse architectural constraints (the choices we make as
designers) with environmental constraints (the forces imposed on
us by context).  The set of REST constraints only includes the former.

REST designs around the fact that centralized link servers do not
work across multiple organizations because they are too expensive
to maintain and create a significant entry-hurdle to deploying
independent content.  That doesn&#39;t prevent people from deploying
their own link servers and making use of them on the Web.  For example,
see the work on Hyper-G and HyperWave in the 90s.  They claimed that
a p-flood algorithm for distributing link changes was enough to
handle the scalability problem, but I never saw an installation of
Hyper-G that was even one-millionth the size of the Web/Intranets.
