&gt; Would that that were true. Fact is, most (all?) existing web browsers

It would have been nice if the W3C had used its influence in the
browser space to define standards for browser UI.  Things like
session logout, usable login dialogs, and the lack of standard
affordances for PUT, DELETE, etc., are all left undone because
&quot;that&#39;s how Mosaic did it&quot; was the only standard that mattered.

I thought that WHATWG was going to pick up the slack on some of
those undefined standards-in-waiting, but apparently not.
