&gt; Here are some variant protocols that I&#39;ve thought about (see attached 
&gt; file).

Nice diagram.

&gt; Which seems the best to you ?

II, except that if the user agent wants to see a list of messages since
a given time (as opposed to all messages), then it should use a query
on inbox, for example:

     GET /host/address/inbox/?since=&quot;{server-provided date of last 
retrieval}&quot;

Likewise, it is wise to define names within that space that represent
variations on the mailbox itself, so that someone can implement
fetchmail.  E.g.,

     GET /host/address/inbox/all
     DELETE /host/address/inbox/range?message=1-234

The most important thing to remember is that the names used by a
REST-based server do not need to reflect how the resources are
implemented.  The client must remain completely ignorant of the
implementation.

Note the use of /host/address above -- you should anticipate that
a single server might be used to handle messages for different MX
authorities and each authority will have its own way of assigning
mailbox accounts, so you want an unambiguous resource namespace.
It should not rely on things like the HTTP Host header field
because you don&#39;t want to limit the mailbox server to be on the
same IP address as the primary MX name.
