Yes, it is done every day with HTML -- you&#39;ve simply forgotten
that a =
person reading a page and following the links/forms on
that page is actuall=
y performing a process of decisions and
selecting actions that drive an app=
lication through a set of
hypermedia workspaces to perform whatever task th=
ey wanted to
perform.

So, thinking in that model, what kind of representat=
ion do you
need to take your application from the initial step (a URI) to
t=
he next step following that representation?  What does your
&quot;user&quot; (doesn&#39;t=
 have to be human) need to &quot;understand&quot; (in the
simplest sense) in order to=
 evaluate the alternatives provided
and submit the appropriate data or sele=
ct the appropriate links
to get it to the next state, and how does the prov=
ider of that
representation express such ideas without natural language?

X=
ML is not an answer here -- it could be some application of
XML which adds =
the necessary semantics, but just having angle
brackets is not enough.  Ask=
 Joe how much effort it takes just
to explain &quot;post it here&quot; to a blogging =
client. ;-)

The effort is all in the semantics of standard data formats;
t=
he rest of the technology has already been deployed.
