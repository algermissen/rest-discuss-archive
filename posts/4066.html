&gt; Just how useful does PUT end up being if the end result is &quot;anything 
&gt; g=
oes&quot;?=A0

A better way to think about it is that the request expresses the =
intent
of the client but the server is responsible for mapping that back in=
to
the state of the resource (the client is not supposed to have a clue as
=
to how the resource is implemented, and usually doesn&#39;t even know what
defi=
nes it as a resource).  Most of the time it just ends up being the
same as =
a flat file store, but the flexibility is there when you need it
because it=
 allows the server to evolve independent of the clients.

We don&#39;t need to =
require that the server do something sensible, since
whatever it does shoul=
d be in the best interests of the resource.

This is also why the Web does =
not support write-back caching.
