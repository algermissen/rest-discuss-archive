&gt;&gt; That concept tends to be a little confusing, partly because HTTP,
&gt;&gt; like many network protocols, has a notion of stateless interactions
&gt;&gt; that only refers to having all of the information needed to
&gt;&gt; understand each request inside the request or defined by universal
&gt;&gt; standard.  REST goes further and constrains application state
&gt;&gt; (not resource state) to be held on the client.
&gt;
&gt; Right.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;ve always assumed that this
&gt; additional constraint is a constraint on application semantics.  That
&gt; is, that a RESTful application semantic may not punt application
&gt; state.  So &quot;LOGIN&quot; wouldn&#39;t be a permitted semantic, because even 
&gt; though
&gt; a LOGIN message may be semantically self-contained (and uniform even),
&gt; it defers the maintenance of some application state (whether you&#39;re
&gt; authorized or not) to the server.

Well, keep in mind that the actions of PUT and POST also defer the
maintenance of state to the server.  Since we could construct a login
semantic via the PUT of a user-specific resource, with logout being
signified by a DELETE, it would be odd for REST to disallow LOGIN
just on the basis of it being a stateful semantic.  I think it is more
accurate to say that, because user identification must be supplied
with each request subject to authentication, that an action like LOGIN
would only add overhead.

&gt; But there&#39;s also a problem if the cookie is defined such that the
&gt; referenced state varies with time, which I would expect is much more
&gt; common than varying by gateway.  A message that references some other
&gt; state may be processed at a time when that state is different than it
&gt; was when the message was constructed.
&gt;
&gt; I understand that this isn&#39;t as relevant to the simple browser/server
&gt; interactions of today, but architecturally speaking it seems quite
&gt; important, especially as we move towards disconnected and queued
&gt; interactions.

That same problem applies to resources.  We could attempt to model REST
as a shared-memory-by-message-passing system, but don&#39;t because that
model tries to maintain distributed consistency.  REST just says that
there is no consistency -- only representations that indicate state
at some point in the past and an implicit grant of use for some time
into the future.
