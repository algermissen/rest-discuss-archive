&gt; I agree with the others, that you use content negotiation but allow

&gt; This
&gt; works really well to test the output of conneg systems, without having
&gt; to muck about with browser settings or use curl. I say parameter, not
&gt; query, because your URIs don&#39;t represent queries -- the output format
&gt; has always seemed a parameter to me:
&gt;
&gt; /team/cubs;view=csv
&gt; /team/cubs;view=json
&gt;

I don&#39;t know of any sane system that uses the query portion to
distinguish format-specific resources.  Everybody uses name
extensions for that purpose.  There is absolutely no good reason
to do the above instead of

    /team/cubs.csv
    /team/cubs.json

and plenty of reasons to avoid using query syntax.

Have a look at Apache Sling for an example.
