&gt; Am I missing something here, or are people confusing architectural

&gt;
&gt; Gall&#39;s list of the five constraints of the &#39;SOA architectural style&#39; -
&gt; modular, distributable, describable, sharable, (aka reusable), and
&gt; loosely coupled - all seem to be desirable qualities for a system to
&gt; exhibit, but I wouldn&#39;t call them architectural constraints. Do I
&gt; misunderstand the concept of architectural constraints?
&gt;

Right, they are desired architectural properties.  However, Nick&#39;s
list of properties for SOA is consistent with IBM and MS marketing.
When has SOA ever been described as constraining anything?  The  
reasonable
conclusion is that SOA is neither an architecture nor a style, but
rather a set of goals that can be sold to overmatched CIOs regardless
of the corresponding architecture or implementation.
