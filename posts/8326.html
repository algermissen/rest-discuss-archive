&gt; &gt;&gt; REST seems to encompass two orthogonal concepts. The first is its
&gt; &gt;&gt; HTTP heritage with headers, status codes, etc. (and is under-
&gt; &gt;&gt; appreciated or misunderstood, hence things like SOAP). The
&gt; &gt;&gt; second, though, is a design paradigm like OO that prescribes how
&gt; &gt;&gt; state and transitions are captured in representations that are
&gt; &gt;&gt; exchanged during the request-response pattern. Tim&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; moment was about the second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s solely the second.

&gt; I have a hard time accepting this absolute statement.

Er, well, sometimes it is better to have a hard time.  The former
is web architecture and the latter is REST.

&gt; Most
&gt; discussions on this list revolve around how to use http methods,
&gt; status codes, and headers to map REST concepts into HTTP. While REST
&gt; might be conceptually larger, it is bounded by its HTTP heritage.

Bounded?  No way.  It isn&#39;t even 1/3rd of the style.

&gt; While they aren&#39;t the same, they are Siamese twins. In other words,
&gt; would you give a talk about REST and never mention HTTP and its
&gt; methods, codes, and headers?

Yes, I have, though most of the time I give talks about the evolution
of web architecture along with REST.

That said, the purpose of this list (as Mark set it up) is to offer
both discussion of the style and implementation advice regarding
web architecture.  That&#39;s why there is so much discussion of HTTP.

I think people do a real disservice to the reader when they start
mixing up architecture and architectural style.  REST, as a style,
exists independent of the Web&#39;s timeline.  HTTP, in contrast, has to
be viewed through the limitations of particular implementations.
REST wouldn&#39;t be a very good abstraction if its understanding
depended on the details of today&#39;s implementations (which are far
less limited than those of 1997, 1995, and 1993).
