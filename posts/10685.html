&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Bob if he views the source of the form is assured that the  
&gt; assigning authority issupporting an entire class of URIs of the  
&gt; form: http://example.org/cityweather?city=CityName. ... Bob could,  
&gt; with this assurance, write his ownsoftware to construct and use  
&gt; such URIs to retrieve weather reports.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The TAG is clearly not suggesting that Bob is merely authorized by  
&gt; the FORM to write generic FORM-parsing software as you suggest. On  
&gt; the contrary, It is clearly stating that given the specific  
&gt; &quot;weather URI&quot; parameters that appear in the FORM, Bob is authorized  
&gt; to write software that can generate &quot;an entire class of URIs&quot; &quot;to  
&gt; retrieve weather reports&quot;. In other words the software can use a  
&gt; URI template.

I don&#39;t see why we should care.  Anyone is &quot;authorized&quot; to write any  
software.
Anyone is authorized to perform a GET on any URI.  The server will  
respond
however it sees fit.  The document got stuck in the weeds somewhere and
is struggling to make sense out of nonsense.

Don&#39;t read too much into what is obviously a poor choice of words.
What they meant to say is that some services correspond to a range
(template) of URIs for which guessing the potential values in that
range is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, even if there turns
out to be no resource for a given guess.  There are no guarantees
on the Web.
