No, if =
the update looks like a patch and PUT is allowed to perform
patch semantics=
 then the server will attempt to perform those semantics
and fail to store =
the patch.  Likewise, if the client expects a partial
update to work with P=
UT and sends that message to an HTTP server that
doesn&#39;t implement partial =
PUTs (i.e., all of them), then the current
representation will be entirely =
replaced with the partial content
regardless of your opinion on how PUT mig=
ht be specified otherwise.

&gt; I was asking specifically about httpbis&#39; over=
specified:
&gt; 
&gt; &#39;PUT is an idempotent update of state that is a complete re=
placement&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; vs the more generally applicable and succinct:
&gt; 
&gt; &#39;PUT is=
 an idempotent update of state&#39;

And you have been answered, many times.  P=
UT means PUT.  There are no
partial updates in PUT.  There was a half-assed=
 attempt to add those
semantics by committee in the midst of standardizing =
HTTP, but that
attempt failed because PUT&#39;s existing semantics had already =
been deployed
and we can&#39;t graft partial updates on top of existing replace=
 semantics. 
Period.  End of story.  Hence, PATCH was defined in 1995 (and =
finally
standardized much later because the WebDAV group was lazy).

This a=
nswer is final.  If anyone implements it differently in Rails,
then Rails w=
ill be neither compliant with HTTP nor compliant with REST.
Whether that ma=
tters to anyone developing Rails is besides the point.
