Umm, the integrati=
on problems you describe are mostly architectural
properties of very specif=
ic architectures.  Generally speaking,
you don&#39;t want to replicate the same=
 architecture when redesigning
a system to be more RESTful -- that would be=
 counterproductive.
You should instead be looking for ways to design the sy=
stem such
that these are no longer problems that need to be solved.

Think =
of it like locking/concurrency issues.  One can design a
system such that e=
very concurrent access is protected by some
deadlock-proof locking scheme, =
or one can design a system that
isolates all concurrent processing in a sha=
red-nothing architecture
that doesn&#39;t need any locking whatsoever.

You are=
 essentially asking how to avoid deadlocks in a
shared nothing architecture=
.   The appropriate answer,
therefore, is ... huh?

&gt; Specifically, we are =
trying to find RESTful solutions to:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Guaranteed Delivery - we need =
a paradigm to follow so that one service can transfer a sequence of resourc=
e representations to another reliably even though both services and the net=
work suffer temporary unreliability

That doesn&#39;t sound like a problem enco=
untered by RESTful
architectures.  Reliable upload of multiple files can be=

performed using a single zip file, but the assumption being made
here is t=
hat the client has a shared understanding of what the
server is intending t=
o do with those files.  That&#39;s coupling.

Applications like that are usuall=
y accomplished via code-on-demand.
The problem you will run into here is im=
plementation issues
regarding current browsers, not architectural issues an=
d
certainly not a style issue.  Most such tools are developed
as browser ex=
tensions or app-specific clients, mostly because
they need unfettered acces=
s to the filesystem and because
browsers (for some unknown reason) don&#39;t in=
clude integrity checks
in normal file uploads.

&gt; 2) Distributed Transactio=
ns - we need a paradigm to allow state changes on multiple services to happ=
en so that the changes succeed or fail as a unit

Again, not a characterist=
ic of RESTful architectures.  If the
client knows the transaction is distri=
buted, you have failed.
There are lots of ways to solve this kind of proble=
m on the
back-end of services interfaces, behind the resource abstraction,
=
but none of those are relevant to the REST architectural style
that might a=
pply on the front-end of the service interface.

&gt; 3) Long running operatio=
ns - we need asynchronous invocations between services and a mechanism for =
the invoking service to find out when the invoked service is done given tha=
t this work may take indefinitely long

Any resource can behave as a long-r=
unning service.  Just program it that way.

&gt; 4) Workflow Orchestration - w=
e would like to have orchestration services that define business processes =
via standardized representations (eg BPMN), then execute instances of those=
 processes and build up an process instance execution data resource by inte=
racting with other RESTful resources using message exchange patterns that c=
ould specify the above behaviors.

That is a system, not an integration pro=
blem.  If you want to
solve it, buy a full-featured WCM system like Day&#39;s C=
Q5.

(sorry=
, I don&#39;t have a way to answer that one without sounding
like a sales plug =
-- it is, after all, why I work for a WCM vendor).
