&gt;&gt;&gt; I created a question on St=

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;=
&gt;&gt; I still don&#39;t really understand the benefit of not allowing PUT to be
&gt;&gt;=
&gt; partial,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So you are asking, why PUT was defined as idempotent in t=
he first place, yes?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think the reason is sort of &quot;because we can d=
efine it that way&quot;. There is POST, which has no visibility (=3D=3DPOST is m=
eaningless to an intermediary) and everything could just be done with POST.=
 But then, adding methods that *have* visibility adds some serious capabili=
ties to HTTP. E.g. GET&#39;s semantics allow for caching and it is also very he=
lpful that we know that GET is safe - we can call it any number of times.
&gt;=
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; .. and PUTs &#39;complete replace&#39; semantics allow for.. ?

The ability=
 to write patch representations onto a server so that those
patches can lat=
er be retrieved by others.
