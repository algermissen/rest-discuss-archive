&gt; It seems that when you take all the REST constraints as a whole, that
&gt; there is nothing which constrains that all &quot;give me a representation
&gt; of this resource&quot; requests use the same semantic (i.e.  GET in HTTP).
&gt; Tim talks about this[1] as one of his &quot;axioms&quot;.

I think it is important to differentiate between things that the
architectural style does not allow (constraints) and things that
it allows but assumes nobody will do.  Tim has a lot of axioms
that are, at best, personal preferences for a rational universe.
Universality is one of them -- the principle that doing it well
enough in one place suggests that nobody else should duplicate
the same functionality, since duplication can be harmful.

&gt; The &quot;uniform interface&quot; constraint doesn&#39;t appear to cover it, as there
&gt; may exist many different uniform semantics as part of a single 
&gt; interface
&gt; which could mean &quot;give me a representation&quot; (&quot;RETRIEVE&quot;, &quot;SNARF&quot;,
&gt; &quot;GRAB&quot;, etc..).  I can&#39;t see how any of the other constraints would
&gt; prevent this either.
&gt;
&gt; Surely I&#39;m missing something here.  Thoughts?  Roy (when you have time 
&gt; -
&gt; no urgency)?

Nope, that&#39;s about right.  Should the architectural style prevent
people from shooting themselves in the foot, or simply note the
advantages of using one verb for each meaning?  I don&#39;t have an
answer to that one.
