&gt; I couldn&#39;t come up with a snappy REST quote - like &quot;REST - a really 
&gt; neat
&gt; idea&quot; so I thought I&#39;d do something funny.

And to think I went to all that trouble coming up with an acronym
that would be an easy pun.

&quot;No REST for the wicked.&quot;

&quot;I just spent all day reading about Web Services.  I need some REST.&quot;

I got up too early this morning.  (not enough REST)
