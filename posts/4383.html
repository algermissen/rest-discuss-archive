&gt; A practical problem, which incidentally shows how little REST is used 
&gt; for
&gt; web services: most apache configurations have ErrorDocument setups 
&gt; which
&gt; make it impossible (or very hard) to use the response body to add
&gt; specificity to error responses.

Generally speaking, if a person isn&#39;t capable of setting the
configuration file for their own web space, they aren&#39;t capable of
running a bidirectional application in that space either.
Apache httpd configuration defaults to read-only hypertext, but
that doesn&#39;t prevent anyone from overriding those defaults for
any set of URIs on the server, including those for ErrorDocument.
