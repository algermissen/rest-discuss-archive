That&#39;s dumb.  Which version of the runtime?

&gt; I have to admit it seems odd to send an ETag along with a response
&gt; marked no-cache, but it is permitted by the spec if you wish to do so.

ETag is not an entity-header. ETag provides information about the
resource, not the current message, so it is orthogonal to cache
control.
