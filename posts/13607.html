&gt; &gt;&gt; Feel free to make such a distinction, but acknowledge that such a

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...TimBL&#39;s point
&gt; &gt; was that cool URIs do not change, not that all URIs are cool.
&gt;
&gt; I have to disagree Roy. Clearly not all URIs are cool, but TimBL  
&gt; believes all URIs should be cool. I quoted from TimBLs Cool URIs  
&gt; design noteabove and I&#39;ll quote it again here:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is the the duty of a [URI space designer] to allocate URIs  
&gt;&gt; which you will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200  
&gt;&gt; years. This needs thought, and organization, and commitment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Nowhere in this note does he ever suggest that only SOME URIs need  
&gt; be cool.  His design note clearly suggests (at least to me) that  
&gt; web designers and implementers should strive to make ALL URIs as  
&gt; cool as possible. Here&#39;s the closing sentence of the note:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The message here is, however, that many, many things can change  
&gt;&gt; and your URIs can and should stay the same. They only can if you  
&gt;&gt; think about how you design them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Where do you get the idea that not all URIs need be or should be  
&gt; cool? (If I am understanding you correctly...)

Umm, maybe the several hundred conversations I&#39;ve had on
the topic with TimBL in the room.  Cool URIs are permanent,
so if you want to be cool then make permanence a design
criteria.  That&#39;s all there is to it.  Nobody is going to
argue against too much URI permanence.  There is certainly
nothing about that in conflict with REST, so if you perceive
a conflict then I suggest you look at your reasoning and
kill the paper tiger.
