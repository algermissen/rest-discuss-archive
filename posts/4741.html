&gt;&gt; PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, and UNLOCK do not have identifiable 
&gt;&gt; resources
&gt;&gt; (they all operate by way of a third party).  Is PROPPATCH always
&gt;
&gt; Could you please expand on what you mean by &quot;they operate by way of a
&gt; third party&quot; (is this about the Depth request header?)? For instance,
&gt; the results for a PROPFIND applied to the same Request-URI will vary 
&gt; for
&gt; Depth 0 (just the Request-URI), 1 (+ internal members) and infinity (+
&gt; all descendants).

That wasn&#39;t what I meant, though depth is certainly another can of 
worms.
I guess that is another reason why PROPFIND is not cacheable.

I meant that the client is using the resource URI to access other
resources that just happen to be properties of the resource URI.  The
indirection means that the client has no way to identify those 
properties
as resources, apply access control to them as resources, version them as
resources, etc.

&gt;&gt; idempotent?
&gt;
&gt; I would think so. PROPPATCH can either set (&quot;PUT&quot;) or remove (aka
&gt; &quot;DELETE&quot;) a property.

okay.
