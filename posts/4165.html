&gt;&gt;&gt; Doesn&#39;t that introduce statefulness into the architecture?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The transaction URI is just a client session identifier.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The meaning of the message shouldn&#39;t depend upon the state of
&gt;&gt; the transaction, only its identity. Ergo, still stateless.

Right.  Stateless in REST refers to the ability of the server to
not know about prior requests in order to completely understand
the current request.  Since each request is just like a normal one
with the addition of a link to the transaction resource, each
recipient completely understands the current request even if they
are a different server than the one that handled the prior request.

&gt; I don&#39;t understand.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that either:
&gt;
&gt; (a) Each transaction contains the states of the various resources
&gt;     within it;
&gt;
&gt; or:
&gt;
&gt; (b) Each resource contains different states for different
&gt;     transactions itself.

I think you are mixing representation and resource state with the
concept of stateless messages -- they are entirely different topics.
For example, PUT is a way of creating a named state on the server,
but the message is stateless.
