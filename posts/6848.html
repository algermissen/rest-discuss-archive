Yes, JSD is mostly a precursor of OOD with various other flavors
thrown in that are symptomatic of the times in which it was taught.
I meant more of a dredging up the past and creating a design
methodology that would lead to REST-based architectures, not
necessarily JSD itself.

&gt; I&#39;m not sure where you got your data on the suppression of deep  
&gt; analysis in correlation with the rise of OOD.  That&#39;s a bit of a  
&gt; slap, which might warrant a reference or two.

Eh?  I didn&#39;t say it was suppressed, nor did I say that deep analysis
isn&#39;t present in OOD.  I meant that debates about which methodology
to use for a given system have essentially disappeared, replaced
with so-called &quot;uniform&quot; methodologies that assume OOD.  The reason
for that is not technical at all -- the software industry changed,
and analysts went with the money.  This is a very old topic in
software engineering.

   &lt;http://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+fad&gt;

and I am sure that some people will list REST among them too,
eventually.  Hopefully, some people will look beyond the fad aspect
and start asking the right questions.
