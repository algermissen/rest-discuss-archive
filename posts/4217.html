&gt; Isolation is a red herring.

&gt; 1. Does the value returned when a third party GETs
&gt; a resource change before your transaction that
&gt; modified that resource COMMITs/ABORTs?

That is what &quot;isolation&quot; means.  If you have isolation, others
won&#39;t see the resource change.  If you don&#39;t, they will.

&gt; 2. Does your transaction fail if any of the values
&gt; it retrieved via GET changes before you try to
&gt; COMMIT?
&gt;
&gt; If #1==yes, you don&#39;t have Atomicity.

Yes. If the server wants atomicity, it must selectively lock or
isolate anything that changes during the transaction.  So what?

&gt; If #1==no, you might not have REST (GET depends on a cookie or conneg).

False.  Conneg is part of REST.  Besides, the request messages will
have to be marked as no-cache in order for any transaction to work.

&gt; If #2==yes, you don&#39;t have HTTP (GET is not idempotent).

False.  GET can be repeated as many times as you like.

&gt; If #2==no, you don&#39;t have Consistency (You can&#39;t guarantee not to 
&gt; violate invariants)

No, the question is bogus.  If any of the non-GET transactions fail
due to a change in the state of the resource, then the transaction
should fail.  The server is fully capable of determining that on
its own using existing conditional mechanisms like If-Match.

&gt; #2 means that transactions are incompatible w/ HTTP.
&gt; #1 means that they may also be independtly incompatible with REST.
&gt;
&gt; Whether #1==no is compatibility with REST depends
&gt; on whether Roy blesses transaction headers as
&gt; being more like Con-Neg or condemns them as being
&gt; more like Cookies.

Why don&#39;t you just implement it and figure it out for yourself.
