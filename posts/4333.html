&gt; Roy&#39;s definition of resource:
&gt;
&gt; More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership
&gt; function M_R(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or
&gt; values, which are equivalent. The values in the set may be resource
&gt; representations and/or resource identifiers.

That&#39;s my definition for a resource within a REST-based information
system.  That is because such a system creates an interface that
causes that mapping to be the only observable definition of a resource.
What the resource actually *is*, within a larger scope, is a different
topic.

&gt; This leads me to a conclusion I don&#39;t like: Two resources that are
&gt; owl:sameAs must respond to the same requests at the same time with the
&gt; same representations, because the resource *is* the membership
&gt; function.

That depends on what you mean by &quot;is&quot;.  ;-)

&gt; Something smells wrong to me.

Context.

&gt; Roy says that &quot;a non-virtual object (e.g. a person)&quot; can be a
&gt; resource. How is a person a membership function? I tried to
&gt; rationalize this by saying that the words &quot;entity&quot; and &quot;value&quot; in the
&gt; definition referred to the person to which the membership function
&gt; mapped, but the very next sentence of the definition limits the values
&gt; to &quot;representations and/or identifiers&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; What am I missing?

When you watch a movie on TV, are you watching photons, characters,
or people playing the roles of characters?  When someone makes a
statement about something they see on TV, do they identify the
photons, the characters, or the actors playing those characters?
Most of the time, they try to clarify the ambiguity by setting the
context -- by referring to the actor by their real name (or pseudonym)
as opposed to the character&#39;s name, or by clarifying the context
via some other part of the statement.

So, in my disseration I was trying to describe both the set of things
that have been named (resources) and the extent to which those named
things can be represented within an information system (the mapping).
It is a bit confusing because I edited it too many times.

My definition of resource in general is in rfc2396bis.
