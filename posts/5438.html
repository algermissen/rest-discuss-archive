&gt;
&gt; Okay, fair point. Here&#39;s my list of principles that constrain the &quot;as  
&gt; possible&quot; side of simplicity:
&gt; 	* interoperability/compatibility
&gt; 	* extensibility/evolvability
&gt; 	* learnability/usablity
&gt; anything else you&#39;d suggest?

Those are properties, not principles. I frequently get those
mixed up too, particularly when I use generality as a principle. ;-)
This figure, for example, has constraints written in normal text and
properties in italics.

     
&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ 
rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9&gt;

I would start with the set of properties in

     
&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ 
net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3&gt;

and perhaps add a few more, then figure out their relative importance.
Why &quot;learnability/usablity&quot; instead of visibility?

Principles are found in most software engineering textbooks, and
occasionally in patterns as well.  I glossed over them in my
dissertation because the audience (Professors doing research
in Software) would have been annoyed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I like the idea of specifying REST APIs simply as &lt;form&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; -- if its rich enough for the human web, it ought to be rich enough
&gt;&gt; &gt; for the machine-readable web.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; REST is an architectural style.  Please come up with a different
&gt;&gt; name for your implementation so that you don&#39;t confuse the heck
&gt;&gt; out of people like me trying to understand it.  REST cannot
&gt;&gt; have an API.  XForms, SOAP, and XML over HTTP are technologies
&gt;&gt; that can used with services that have an API.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about that -- I seem to keep getting yelled at from both sides.  
&gt; :-)   Some people tell me &quot;it is just REST&quot; or &quot;it is just The Web--  
&gt; stop making up names.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; However, I&#39;ll take your statement as normative, and try to create a  
&gt; distinguishing name.  I&#39;m still a little unclear on the optimal  
&gt; terminology, though. I have started using the term &quot;REX: REST-Enabled  
&gt; XHTML&quot; for my effort encode REST-compatible (?) URLs inside HTML  
&gt; documents.  Would that help?  Or can you suggest something more  
&gt; specific?

Isn&#39;t REX the name of a computer language?  I usually talk about
REST as a style and REST-based architectures as implementations
of that style, so sticking to REST-based APIs that use XHTML
is fine.  I suggest avoiding the use of an acronym or naming
it after a loved-one (unless it is a pet turtle, which apparently
have no objections to such things).
