&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t quite grasp the concept of &quot;virt=

&gt; probably because i don&#39;t have a mathematical backgr=
ound.
&gt;
&gt; Danny Ayers has this really simple example to illustrate the stat=
e
&gt; machine of a lamp:
&gt;
&gt; http://dannyayers.com/engine-of-state/on
&gt;
&gt; Ala=
n

Umm, no, that is a very simple example of two web pages with links
to =
each other.  It doesn&#39;t actually &quot;do&quot; anything.  The comments are
right -- =
if it were an application, then there would be one resource
and the hyperte=
xt would tell you how to change its state (not just
the browser&#39;s view).

A=
n application is something a user wants to do with computers.
&quot;Writing a me=
mo&quot; is an application.  Microsoft Word is a software
system for writing mem=
os (among other things).  Google Docs is a
network-based software system fo=
r writing memos (among other things).

&quot;Buying stuff&quot; is another applicatio=
n.  Amazon is a network-based
software system for buying stuff.  You get th=
e idea ... a
network-based application is something a user wants to do
with=
 computers that needs (for whatever reason) to be network-based.
It can be =
as simple as reading a book, or as complex as ordering
parts for a Boeing 7=
67.  And let&#39;s not forget that there are
many network-based applications fo=
r which REST is not likely
to be a good design (an alarm monitoring system =
would be one
example -- it may have RESTful components, such as a status vi=
ew,
but it would be silly to restrict the sensors to a pull-based
interacti=
on just out of architectural purity).

Application state in REST is what mo=
st distributed systems would
call session state or transaction state, depen=
ding on which end
of the system is being talked about.  However, we can&#39;t c=
all it
session state because then networking folks assume the communication=

is session-scoped, and we can&#39;t call it transaction state because
then dat=
abase folks assume we are talking about back-end ACID.
Let&#39;s face it, there=
 are very few ways to describe anything in
computer science that hasn&#39;t alr=
eady been used in a slightly
different fashion.  Application state is a goo=
d term to describe
what really matters to the user.

Danny&#39;s pages are not =
an application.  That is, unless your
application happens to *be* making RD=
F assertions.  For that
purpose, having two different resources with singul=
ar states
might be a useful thing.
