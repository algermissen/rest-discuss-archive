&gt;&gt; We have no way of knowing whether the URI, as used by the author,

&gt;&gt; to reference.  That&#39;s why it is useful to look at the text inside
&gt;&gt; the anchor, both here and in other authors&#39; use of the URI, and
&gt;&gt; any other metadata that might be laying about.
&gt;
&gt; So it is true that an author&#39;s use of a URI provides a context that
&gt; affects what resource the URI is actually intended to identify, yes?

No.  It affects the result of identifying the resource, and that in turn
affects how people using that URI perceive it as identifying.  But, what
it actually identifies is unknown to the link author, unless they happen
to know by some other method (e.g., being the owner, asking the owner,
etc.).  People generally just follow the leader and assume that what
one person thinks it identifies is what they think it identifies.

&gt; So, a single URI can in fact identify several different resources
&gt; (depending on the URI-user&#39;s intention). Did I get that right?

A single URI can be used to indirectly identify multiple resources,
even though it only directly identifies whatever the maintainer of
that mapping wishes to maintain.

By author I meant &quot;link maker&quot;, not resource owner.
