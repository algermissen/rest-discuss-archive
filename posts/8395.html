&gt; [. . .]
&gt; &gt; REST simplifies applications because it rips apart the million
&gt; &gt; potential states inherent in any serious application and presents
&gt; &gt; to the client only one at a time, with every single transition
&gt; &gt; from that state described in a format that can be understood by
&gt; &gt; the client as a potential transition. The client is completely
&gt; &gt; decoupled from the server aside from the shared agreement on what
&gt; &gt; each media type means. The entire application only needs to be
&gt; &gt; understood (and can be completely tested) one state at a time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This is where I get a little confused.
&gt;
&gt; I assume that the client still needs to understand each of the  
&gt; possible
&gt; states so that it knows what to do with/at each of those states. I  
&gt; also
&gt; assume that the client needs to understand what each of the  
&gt; transitions
&gt; (links) out of the current state means so that it can determine  
&gt; which one
&gt; to follow.

Each state is described by the current set of representations.
A client&#39;s understanding will depend on its understanding of the
media types.
&gt; What happens when the application evolves to include a new
&gt; state? How does the client figure out what to do with that new state?

The client doesn&#39;t need to memorize the states, other than the
few cool URI &quot;start states&quot; that might be bookmarked.  Each state
tells it what to do next.  The evolution a client has to worry about
is when the media type evolves in unanticipated ways, which is the
same problem as occurs when new HTML elements are added that a browser
doesn&#39;t recognize.  Perhaps a representation is provided such that
the new bits can be safely ignored by old clients, or parallel
states are introduced for different types of clients, or clients
are automagically updated through code on demand, or clients
use content negotiation on each request.  Those are all typical
mechanisms for backwards compatibility with clients.
