In this case, yes, though it is true for any client.

&gt; My understandin=

t the submission resquest upon the activation of a hypermedia control. (Web=
 browsers know how to create a POST request from a user&#39;s submission of a f=
orm)

which it gets from the media type definition, yes.

&gt; The user howeve=
r does have an understanding (expectation) of what the server is intending =
to do with those files. This expectation is the basis for choosing to activ=
ate the hypermedia control in the first place.

A user (or configured robot=
) will understand their own intent,
yes, but not necessarily how the server=
 intends to accomplish that
functionality.  A user is unlikely to know that=
 a given service
needs guaranteed delivery, since best-effort delivery is t=
he norm.
One would have to add that to the interaction requirements, which
=
means standardizing that kind of interaction through additional
definitions=
 in the media type or link relations and sending
enough information with th=
e request to enable the recipient to
verify the received message integrity,=
 and both sides need to
know that the request needs to be repeated automati=
cally if
the checks fail.  And that still doesn&#39;t tell us what to put in
th=
e representations being sent.  That&#39;s why this kind of
functionality is mor=
e likely found in javascript or a
browser extension.

There is also no need=
 to limit yourself to one interface.
Look at all the interfaces on Apache A=
ctiveMQ, for example

  http://activemq.apache.org/protocols.html

The so-c=
alled REST protocol calls for POST to a given
queue URI, which I&#39;ll just as=
sume isn&#39;t guaranteed delivery.
Guaranteed delivery could probably be added=
 with a simple
message integrity check if the messages are unique, but I
wo=
uld prefer a more explicit pattern.

For example, we might define a message=
 sink with a URI such
that each client knows (by definition) that it should=
 append
its own client-id (perhaps set by cookie) and a message counter
to =
the request URI, as in

   PUT URI/client-id/count HTTP/1.1
   MIC: a162b17=
f

and then the client can send as many messages as it wants,
provided the =
count is incremented for each new message, and
the server must verify (and =
store) the MIC before responding
with a success code.  Each message can the=
refore be logged,
verified, etc., just like a message queue with guarantees=
.

We could try to standardize something like what I describe above,
but it=
 would require multiple independent implementations and a
lot more free tim=
e than it probably deserves.  In any case, it also
begs the question of why=
 would we want to do this using HTTP
[aside from just avoiding firewall blo=
cks, which is not a
rational rationale].

The fact is that most people writ=
e message queues for systems
that are more operational than informational -=
- i.e., they are
doing something, usually at a high rate of speed, that isn=
&#39;t
intended to be viewed as an information service, except in
the form of a=
n archive or summary of past events.  Would a
more RESTful message queue ha=
ve significant architectural
properties that outweigh the trade-off on perf=
ormance, or
would it be better to use a tightly coupled eventing protocol
a=
nd merely provide the resulting archive and summaries via
normal RESTful in=
teraction?  That kind of question needs to
be answered by an architect fami=
liar with all of the design
contraints for the proposed system.
