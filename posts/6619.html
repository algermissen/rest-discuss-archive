&gt; &gt; It would have been nice if the W3C had used its influence in the
&gt; &gt; browser space to define standards for browser UI. Things like
&gt; &gt; session logout, usable login dialogs, and the lack of standard
&gt; &gt; affordances for PUT, DELETE, etc., are all left undone because
&gt; &gt; &quot;that&#39;s how Mosaic did it&quot; was the only standard that mattered.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought that WHATWG was going to pick up the slack on some of
&gt; &gt; those undefined standards-in-waiting, but apparently not.
&gt;
&gt; WHAT-WG specs are really big, so you have to look closely. It doesn&#39;t
&gt; help that they are breaking off chunks and taking them to W3C. For
&gt; example, here is what&#39;s they&#39;ve done for PUT/DELETE in forms:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/web-forms-2/#for-http

Yikes.  Looks like they need a clue-stick about security.

Standard UI affordances are like &quot;hypertext = GET, button = POST,
fancy-red-X = DELETE, upload-arrow = PUT, ... basically, common idioms
that represent the action and allow the user to be aware of the type
of action being requested before it is selected.  (One of the more
commonly cited examples was a Boeing design for an airplane&#39;s
landing gear control, which is shaped like landing gear so that
it is distinguished from all of the other controls.  It doesn&#39;t
really matter what they are -- they just have to be different for
each one and used consistently within a given browser.  Such affordances
were actually required by HTML back when I was involved.

&gt; I&#39;d be curious to hear the history on session logout, usable login
&gt; dialogs. Have any pointers or information?

Nothing specific off-hand.  All you need to logout of an HTTP session
is a UI for telling the browser to stop sending its cached credential,
which was obvious to everyone except the browser developers.  Likewise,
if the browser displayed the HTTP message sent with a 401 response, then
application developers could easily define their own custom login
dialogs.  That is all part of the design of URI+HTTP+HTML -- the only
bit missing was one implementation to show all the others how to do it.
