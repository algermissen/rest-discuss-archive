&gt; I noticed in your WAKA ApacheCon presentation that you discuss the
&gt; ability to include metadata about the resource and representation along
&gt; with the response.  Could that assume the form of a link to another
&gt; document?  Either way would be the moral equivalent of what Roger is
&gt; proposing it seems to me.

Yes, it includes external links with role attributes.  It also allows
metadata to be interleaved with the response data, thus removing the
issue regarding overhead latency.

&gt; Would there be any equivalent of the OPTIONS method?  Or is that sort 
&gt; of
&gt; functionality deprecated?

Yes.  At least one form of OPTIONS request was always intended to
contain the desired (later) request in the OPTIONS body (excluding the
body of the desired request itself), thus allowing the server to know
exactly what options should be described.  It couldn&#39;t be standardized
because I didn&#39;t have time to implement it, and without that nobody
else was willing to implement.

&gt; RFC2616 mentions that and further specification of OPTIONS is left for
&gt; future versions of HTTP. Is there any work currently underway to 
&gt; further
&gt; refine that method?

Always.  No implementations yet, though.
