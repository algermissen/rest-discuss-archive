&gt; Does that mean that I don&#39;t have to rely on content negotiation for
&gt; choosing the format of the response? So, it would be RESTful to have
&gt; those two URIs for example
&gt;
&gt; http://www.physicists.org/html/list-of-physicists
&gt; http://www.physicists.org/xml/list-of-physicists
&gt;
&gt; although the representations they return are
&gt; representations of the same resource (concept) and only differ
&gt; in the markup language used ?

Those are two different resources.  If a person wishes to identify
the XML representation of a concept, an HTML response to that resource
would not be a valid representation even though it may have essentially
the same content.  If the resource is a concept independent of
representation format, then its URI must not have any aspect
that is specific to the representation format.  Having that aspect
in the URI (as interpreted by the origin server) implies that the
resource semantics includes the format.

BTW, for server-contructed URI, there is no effective difference
between query and path info -- both distinguish a resource.  It is
only when the URI is client-constructed (as in GET forms or ISINDEX
or the old server-side image maps) that the client has any way to
distinguish the non-query path as a resource, and even then the
various URI with the query info tagged-onto the end identify separate
resources.

A resource is defined not by its implementation, but by a user&#39;s
expectation of results from future actions on that resource.
If two URI are expected to respond to GET differently, then they
must identify different resources.
