&gt; Thank for that. So a d=

 one slide of my presentation), could be  
&gt; something like
&gt;
&gt; An &quot;applica=
tion&quot; is a group of activities (services?) provided by a  
&gt; set of &quot;resour=
ces&quot; that together form the means necessary to  
&gt; achieve a goal&quot; ?
&gt;

You=
 must have made that one up -- it is not even remotely like
the definition =
I just gave you.

&gt; And &quot;Application state&quot; as
&gt;
&gt; A snapshot of the &quot;data =
view&quot; after a completed request/response  
&gt; (and before the next request?)=
 ?
&gt;

No.  I do have such a snapshot in the dissertation, but it was
talkin=
g about steady-states in REST.  Application state exists
regardless of the =
style used -- in fact, one of the main goals
of any interaction style is to=
 partition where application state
is kept or shared.  &quot;state&quot; is a well-de=
fined term in I&CS.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28computer_science=
%29

Application state would be the state of the application at
some point =
in time, using the definition of application that
I gave you (which is also=
 referred to in the dissertation).
