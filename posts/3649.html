&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to get my mind around exactly what visibility means 
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; why its important to REST.  I think I have a vague sense of what it 
&gt;&gt; is,
&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at
&gt;&gt; Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.
&gt;
&gt; What it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to 
&gt; monitor
&gt; or mediate the interaction between two other components. &quot;

Why it&#39;s important?  Hmm...

There are several places where it comes into play:

   o efficient intermediaries

     - security across trust boundaries

     Many networks don&#39;t trust each other, or at least don&#39;t trust what
     is on the other side of a firewall.  As a result, intermediaries are
     installed to filter traffic.  That is a hard problem for 
general-purpose
     application protocols, so we need to make it easier in order to make
     filtering more efficient and gain the trust of firewall admins.

     - extensibility

     Visibility calls for more explicit descriptions within messages, as
     opposed to relying on external IDLs or XDR-style typing by schema,
     which in turn makes it easier to extend the functionality later.

     - evolvability

     When intermediaries can understand a request, they can more easily
     perform or adjust it on behalf of the intended recipient, just as
     WebTV or cell phone networks can adjust for their clients.

     - performance

     Visibility is necessary for cacheability.

   o understandability

     It is simply easier to build complex systems if you can see and
     understand the individual interactions.

   o reusability

     People learn by emulation.  That is described somewhat in the 
section
     on Java versus Javascript.

There are probably others.
