Er, not since it was completely rewritten -- I haven&#39;t even reviewed it.
The first sentence, for example, is problematic.

&gt; FWIW, one of the underlying philosophical aspects of REST is that
&gt; resources and their representations change, and that includes REST  
&gt; itself.

No, it is that representations can change if that is how the resource
is defined.  A resource does not change -- what changes are the
perceptions of the users of a resource (hence, &quot;do not try to bend
the spoon, for that would be impossible ...&quot;).  That is where I and
the semantic web part ways, since someone decided that the semantic
web would assume a world that does not change its own perceptions.

My dissertation will not change.  Whether or not the style changes is
debatable -- other people&#39;s perceptions are guaranteed to change
(I&#39;ve already seen multiple papers claiming to &quot;add&quot; features to REST
that were already in the style to begin with, as well as plenty of
arguments about &quot;REST fundamentals&quot; that are not even close
to what I wrote).  Personally, I&#39;ve got better things to do.

I think that this thread is seriously missing the point of my
dissertation.  All of the REST constraints exist for a reason.
The first thing you should do is determine what that reason is,
and then see if it still applies to the system being designed.
Use the old noggin -- that is the point.

FYI, the reason, in this case, is independent evolution of components.
And hypermedia is a defined term (that does not mean just HTML).
