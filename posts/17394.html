&gt;&gt; Validating forms submitted by users and repo=

&gt;&gt; POST-REDIRECT-GET is a commonly used pattern for this. But I rec=
ently
&gt;&gt; saw an interesting piece of code, which forced me to think again a=
bout
&gt;&gt; the basics.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The code I am looking at, is actually overriding=
 HttpServletRequest
&gt;&gt; and oerriding &#39;getMethod&#39; to change HTTP verb from P=
OST to GET. then
&gt;&gt; doing request forwarding.
&gt;&gt; So for the forwarded resou=
rce its a GET request, even if from browser,
&gt;&gt; its was a POST request.
&gt;&gt; =
I see two problems with this,
&gt;&gt; 1. The response is still given to user age=
nt as part of POST request.
&gt;&gt; 2. For web container, even if getMethod is o=
verridden, its a POST
&gt;&gt; request. (I do not know, if in the forwarded reque=
sts, web containers
&gt;&gt; strictly use the request objects thats wrapped and d=
o not use any of
&gt;&gt; the internal information for that request)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The a=
dvantage of this method, is that you do not need to persist
&gt;&gt; information =
between redirects, So you do not need session or other
&gt;&gt; persistence mecha=
nism.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyone else has seem this kind of idiom used in J2EE web appli=
cations?

&gt; None of this has any bearing on what is seen at the protocol le=
vel. At the protocol level, a POST is a POST.
&gt; 
&gt; From your description it=
 seems that this idiom is based on an incorrect understanding of the protoc=
ol.

I don&#39;t see how that is responsive to the question.  The server is
cha=
nging a POST request inside the service handler to be a GET
request so that=
 the handler can do some funky chicken dance that
has specific behavior wit=
hin the current JDK.

This is essentially the same thing that Apache httpd =
does when
an internal content handler needs to perform an internal redirect=

to obtain some part of the content, such as with server-side
includes bein=
g embedded in the POST response.

REST plays no part in this because it is =
all behind the resource
interface provided by the servlet engine.  There ar=
e no constraints
on POST, so changing the method to a safer one (like GET) =
is
certainly not going to violate any of the client&#39;s expectations
regardin=
g their POST.

It may be weird.  It may be unreliable over time.  But it is=
 not
inherently for or against RESTful interaction with the client.
The rea=
son for doing content handling in this manner is usually
so that the intern=
al request contains the same authentication
information as the original req=
uest, thereby avoiding some
security issues during request handling.
