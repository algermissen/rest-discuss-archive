&gt; &gt; You&#39;re right that Roy&#39;s dissertaion doesn&#39;t say anything about

&gt;
&gt; But then it also doesn&#39;t say anything about a *specific* set of  
&gt; methods.
&gt;
&gt; Believe it or not, the set of methods currently defined in RFC2616 is
&gt; not the result of a big design plan; it just happens that those  
&gt; methods
&gt; that weren&#39;t widely used at some point of time were taken out  
&gt; (probably
&gt; due to the standards process), and were left for subsequent efforts to
&gt; be picked up, such as WebDAV.

Actually, that was the result of a big design plan, which occurred
before the HTTP working group began in 1994.  There were a lot more
prototype methods in the hypertext &quot;as implemented&quot; spec.

What you are probably thinking of is the set of methods in the
original HTTP/1.1 proposal, which were later trimmed by the WG to
fit the scope of what the WG considered could be standardized
at that time.

&gt; Whether or not all WebDAV methods have been defined *well*, and  
&gt; whether
&gt; they are all needed, is a separate discussion. But just because
&gt; something doesn&#39;t appear in RFC2616 doesn&#39;t make it not &quot;restful&quot; per
&gt; se. Consider LINK or PATCH, for example.

Both of which are RESTful, as designed by me in the original
HTTP/1.1 proposal.
