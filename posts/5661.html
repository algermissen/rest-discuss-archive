&gt; I implemented a REST web service for administering account

&gt; that PUT is not supported by Apache.

&gt; Has anyone on this list set up Apache with Tomcat for use with the  
&gt; POST
&gt; request-method?

I suggest doing a google search.  mod_jk is a servlet interface  
extension,
so I don&#39;t know what it supports (and unfortunately I have no time to  
check
right now).  PUT is supported by Apache if the module responsible for  
handling
that part of the Location space allows PUT.
