&gt; I am just not grasping the finer details, but this doesn&#39;t seem like a
&gt; valid REST approach.  And to complicate it more, suppose that I had
&gt; performed a T-DELETE instead.  Now, the URI returns an Etag of &quot;1&quot; and
&gt; the T-URI is no longer mapped.  Again, this does not feel RESTful at 
&gt; all.

There are many ways to implement transactions (meaning: making several
actions seem atomic).  Isolation is not a property of transactions -- it
is only a property of workspaces (one implementation of transactions).
If you insist on having that property, then you&#39;ll have to live with
its limitations as well.  For example, do you want a wire transfer
deposit to fail just because you happen to be using your ATM card
at the same time?  The fact is that many simultaneous transactions
can safely take place on the same resources if you don&#39;t force the
server into a single model.  The right thing to do is tell the server
what you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation
according to the types of resources it is trying to protect.
