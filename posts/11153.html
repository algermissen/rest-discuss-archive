&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know of any sane system that uses the query portion to
&gt; &gt; distinguish format-specific resources. Everybody uses name
&gt; &gt; extensions for that purpose. There is absolutely no good reason
&gt; &gt; to do the above instead of
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; /team/cubs.csv
&gt; &gt; /team/cubs.json
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and plenty of reasons to avoid using query syntax.
&gt;
&gt; What would they be?
&gt;

1) It interferes with other uses of the query syntax (for queries);
2) It is often controlled by a different subsystem during operations,
    in a method-specific and implementation-specific manner, which  
makes it
    harder to preserve names when the implementation evolves;
3) It looks like a query, so some caches don&#39;t bother to cache the
    response because the hit rate is lower than non-query responses;
4) It looks like a potentially &quot;unsafe&quot; resource, so some (spineless)
    spiders won&#39;t traverse it and your site will disappear from search
    engines.
