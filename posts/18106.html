&gt;&gt; Period. End of story. Hence, PATCH was def=

&gt; What exactly does this have to do with WebDAV? Do=
 you think WebDAV should have defined PATCH?

Yes, it was part of the origi=
nal authoring task when the DAV WG was initiated.
That&#39;s why I removed PATC=
H from RFC2068 (because it was supposedly going to
be developed further by =
DAV and we did not want a conflicting definition).
