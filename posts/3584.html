&gt; So if I PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, there now exists a resource with that name
&gt; (assuming all goes well).  Does that necessarily imply that there is 
&gt; now
&gt; also a resource named /foo/bar?  That is, if I start with an empty
&gt; hierarchy and no resources, then do a PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, is there
&gt; anything about REST or HTTP that dictates that  I now have three
&gt; resources rather than one?

What is a resource?  What makes you think it didn&#39;t exist before the 
PUT?

Yeah, I know that&#39;s an annoying answer, but it is quite pointless to be
discussing these things if we aren&#39;t even clear on what is a resource.

A resource is a source for *future* responses to future requests.  Thus,
the resource will already exist by virtue of you eventually doing the 
PUT,
and what you are doing with those requests is changing the responses
to future requests.  Whether or not those ancestral names, or any other
names that might have been created by the usual side-effects, are
accessible to future requests (and hence are resources) is defined by
the server and not by the protocol (or even the style).

The server might choose to reject the PUT request simply because it
wants access control to be specified first.  Interoperability is
obtained not by restricting the behavior of the server, but by
requiring that the server respond according to its desires and
enabling the client to understand that response.

One of the keys to understanding how REST works is to understand that
the implementations have no clue what the resource is or how it is
defined or what, in fact, makes it a resource.  That is just too hard
a concept for the implementations to handle.  Even the human beings
maintaining the site have a hard time figuring that one out, because
we just aren&#39;t very good at predicting the future.  In contrast,
it is relatively easy to talk about representations, storing them
and mapping them to names that are resources, since those are
operations that manipulate bits in the &quot;now&quot; and are easy for
server mechanisms to understand and implement.

Thus, it is not necessary to know what the fate of /foo/bar/ might
be after a

    PUT /foo/bar/thing

even though we do know what its fate will be after a

    DELETE /foo/

has successfully completed.  Note, however, that the success of the
first request does not imply that the server must allow the second
request.  It may choose to forbid it (for any reason).
