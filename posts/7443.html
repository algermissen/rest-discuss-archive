&gt; I think I get what you are saying, but I want to be sure. Basically  
&gt; you are
&gt; saying that each of the following URLs point to a DIFFERENT  
&gt; resource as far
&gt; as REST is concerned, correct:

No.  Why would I have said &quot;For two resources to be the same, ...&quot; if
I thought that changing a URI always resulted in different resources?
They might be different resources, the client generally won&#39;t be able
to figure that out, so the only safe assumption is that they are
different resources until stated otherwise by the server.

This is Web Architecture.  Resources are an abstraction -- a source of
goodness as perceived by the person who linked to that resource that
is in the form of a value-giver over time.  There are no resources on
the Web -- only senders and receivers of representations that have
the effect of evaluating a resource mapping at invocation time,
thereby becoming &quot;the resource&quot; as we perceive it over time even
though we all know it is just a finite data server at any single
point in time.

The ultimate goal is to choose the one true identifier that will
always map to the intended resource, such that the link author (and
the millions of people who subsequently copy or bookmark that link)
never have to change the link. Of course, we rarely achieve the
ultimate goal the first time, and sometimes there are many paths to
the ultimate goal that get explored along the way, and sometimes
people move the goal posts.

If there are many URIs for a given resource, the best implementation
is for all of the other URIs to redirect to the one URI that is
deemed to be &quot;best&quot; for the resource&#39;s unique semantics.  The reason
for that is not REST or Web Architecture (though both are specifically
designed to enable it): the reason is network economics as expressed
by power laws, Metcalfe&#39;s law, PageRank, and a hundred other
restatements of the factors that place value on social networks.

REST works because it makes absolutely no attempt to understand
what the resource is, how it might be implemented, or the scope of
how it will change over time.  It eliminates the semantic burden of
understanding by focusing only on the interface as a means of hiding
knowledge from the other side, yet communicating all that needs to
be said in the same way that two people communicate -- tossing
representations across the gap with a relatively small number of
pitch inflections to indicate what is expected in return.  In short,
REST doesn&#39;t care what the resource is or how many URIs identify
the same resource, because to care would require understanding that
would lead to coupling which is more dangerous than inefficiency.

Such communication theory is a lot more abstract than REST, REST is
a lot more abstract than Web Architecture (URI, HTTP, HTML, ...),
and Web Architecture is somewhat more abstract than any current
implementation of that architecture (Apache httpd, Mozilla Firefox,
etc.).  And yet they all need to influence each other, in various
ways, when we attempt to design changes to a living system.
