&gt;&gt; That is, we have GET, PUT, POST and DELETE, our fundamental
&gt;&gt; ways of dereferencing a URI. We&#39;ll assume that we are putting
&gt;&gt; together nice RESTful services and using all these methods correctly.
&gt;&gt; What happens when we start combining these dereferences?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example:
&gt;&gt;   POST is used to create new resources
&gt;&gt;   GET is used to retrieve a representation of a resource
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On their own they&#39;re RESTful,
&gt;
&gt; No, the POST invocation isn&#39;t RESTful by itself.  In the examples
&gt; people have given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation
&gt; will result in a resource being created (and furthermore, that this
&gt; resource will have a particular relationship to the POSTed
&gt; representation).

Nonsense, Mark.  Of course that is REST -- it is right in the
HTTP standard.  The client is *told* by the server the URI of
the new resource.  The client doesn&#39;t need any other expectation than
simply following HTTP.  This is no different from following application
state as presented by links within representations.

&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees here.  I&#39;ve found 
&gt; it
&gt; helpful to focus on one of the primary objectives of the uniform
&gt; interface; substitutability, i.e. the ability to substitute one service
&gt; implementing POST with another service implementing POST.
&gt; Query-via-POST fails this test because the expectation about the query
&gt; results being returned cannot be provided by other services.  For
&gt; example, if one swapped in a resource which spat out the input document
&gt; to a printer, then clearly it wouldn&#39;t meet the expectation of
&gt; performing a query.

Sorry, that makes no sense.  The interface is substitutable.  Resources
are not substitutable.  Nobody has an expectation that you can replace
one resource with a different resource and have continuation of
semantics.  What you get with REST is an interface that tells you
how it works.  POST is part of that interface when used right.
