&gt; Roy asks about a stateful server evolving when the new server has  
&gt; no idea
&gt; what stage the client is at.  This is a great question, but most  
&gt; stateful
&gt; servers today do the right thing.  They provide for the old version  
&gt; and the
&gt; new version, with a mapping between them.  Thus stateful server  
&gt; evolution is
&gt; fine if the server has been built for evolution, and most of the  
&gt; &quot;real&quot;
&gt; systems do.   Heck, we do side-by-side deployment too with a ton of
&gt; variables to control how to direct.

Er, sometimes they do, yes, and other times they are just a checkbox
on a marketing pamphlet.  I have yet to see an instance of one
vendor&#39;s server be replaced with a different vendor&#39;s server and
not have the whole house of cards collapse.  That is, except on
the Web, which handles that change without any problem whatsoever
if the identifiers do not change.

In any case, the kind of evolution you are talking about there is
very restricted and well planned.  The statefulness, for example, has
to be limited to session tickets or pointers to back-end systems
that remain available during the process, and a bunch of money has
to be thrown at the system to make even that possible.

The kind of evolution I was talking about includes both small-scale
planned evolution on the server and the wild whack-a-mole style of
evolution that happens when one company absorbs another or an entire
service shifts from a centralized architecture to edge-based Akamai.

The important thing is not just that stateful-client architecture
is evolvable, but that it is evolvable for free.  We can indeed
deploy an evolvable stateful system, but only if it is planned and
budgeted as such by the likes of Bill Gates.  A poor snot-nose
grad student doesn&#39;t have that option, so in order for the vast
multitude of services to be evolvable the solution has to be cheap
and on by default.  That is what we hope for when we architect the
system for independent evolvability across multiple organizations.

&gt; Properly built stateful servers are often higher user-perceived  
&gt; performance
&gt; in versioning when the server side state is migrated to a new  
&gt; version in
&gt; between client requests, rather than at run-time as the client  
&gt; request with
&gt; the old state comes in.
&gt;
&gt; The question can be turned around a bit, and consider what happens  
&gt; when a
&gt; stateful client is replaced in the middle of a conversation with a  
&gt; server by
&gt; a new client which is just like the old one but has no idea what  
&gt; state the
&gt; server is within its application.

A better example is a user operating on the same server with two  
different
clients (e.g., desktop and blackberry) and expecting the state on both
to remain synchronized.  That is much easier to implement with a  
stateful
server and that may be the more appropriate architecture to choose after
considering all of the other requirements.  Yep, there are lots of  
tradeoffs.
Likewise, real-time monitoring systems are usually better architected
as a distributed object or event-based system, with only the management
console projecting a simpler interface.

&gt; I think the question of location of client vs server state and
&gt; versioning/evolvability is a very complicated decision, and some of  
&gt; the
&gt; factors include how much the client is &quot;trusted&quot;, how much
&gt; time/processing/resource usage is on the client vs the server, the  
&gt; data set
&gt; between the two, etc.

And let&#39;s not forget the question of how much money you are willing
to spend on server complexity to make up for the other trade-offs.

&gt; The Web works in many ways because the time on the
&gt; client is long compared to on the server (sub x second response  
&gt; time for
&gt; those humans), the client can go away at any time (ie not trusted  
&gt; to do
&gt; garbage collection properly), and the data sets are small  
&gt; (typically you
&gt; just need to handle the amount of data that the client has entered to
&gt; reconstruct the state).  The more you change those (and other)  
&gt; factors, the
&gt; more you lean towards server-side state.  There&#39;s trade-offs in  
&gt; network
&gt; performance, user-perceived performance, and other network and  
&gt; application
&gt; properties that get adjusted.  There&#39;s just no way that large data  
&gt; sets on
&gt; the server communicating a small data set to well behaved (from a gcol
&gt; perspective) clients where the server does most of the computing  
&gt; are going
&gt; to be made client-side stateful.

Yeah, that&#39;s why stored procedures exist, and also why one thing a
resource can be is (effectively) a stored procedure.  But it&#39;s also
interesting to consider other architectures that have more flexibility,
such as mobile code.

It is core to the Web design principles that the clients cannot be
trusted, but that certainly isn&#39;t true of every system.  Most times.
Postscript printing, for example, is an excellent case study in the
use of mostly-safe mobile code to enable independent evolution of
printing applications from printer hardware.

&gt; To paraphrase somebody, you&#39;ve got to do the analysis for yourself and
&gt; figure out which architectural style makes sense given your  
&gt; applications
&gt; requirements.

Yep, that&#39;s the key.  And there is usually more than one valid
architecture for any given application, with both positive and
negative trade-offs in the short term and long.  In the end, though,
simplicity usually works better.
