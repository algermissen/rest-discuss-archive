&gt; I think the answer you&#39;re looking for is found in the explanation
&gt; often given about GET and side-effects; that the client didn&#39;t request
&gt; them and so can&#39;t be held accountable. Similarly, from the POV of
&gt; this thread, if a server non-idempotently &quot;versions&quot; a resource on a
&gt; PUT, the client isn&#39;t requesting that action, the server just decided
&gt; to do it, and therefore it&#39;s not a violation of PUT semantics ... as
&gt; long as the server also sets the state of the targetted resource to
&gt; that represented in the request, of course.

&gt; I&#39;ve understood this distinction for some time, but it still catches
&gt; me on occasion...

Yes, that&#39;s it.  We have to keep dancing around that bush because
terminology is a committee-driven process.  Everyone has an opinion
and so no opinion is spec&#39;d consistently.
