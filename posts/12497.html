&gt; So the &quot;application&quot; in Engine of Application State is really your

Most of the time, with some caveats:

The &quot;application&quot; is what the user is trying to accomplish,
such as &quot;buy a book&quot; or &quot;transfer money from one account
to another&quot; or &quot;watch some monty python episode&quot;.  The browser
is just the software that presents and operates upon the
application state.

Forms usually change the state of the browser as well.

Links and forms are specific UI mechanisms in HTML that teach
the browser how to construct the request upon activation.
A more elaborate media type could have more elaborate
mechanisms, and non-browser clients are even less restricted
in how they interact with media.

Although GET requests are not requesting a state change, it is
still possible for some resource states to change in response
to a GET.  For example, there may be some other resource that
counts the number of GETs, or the most recent user agent.
