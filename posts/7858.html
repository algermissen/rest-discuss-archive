Marc, I already explained to Rajiv last November that I would not
allow Sun to go forward with the REST name in the API.  It doesn&#39;t
make any sense to name one API as the RESTful API for Java, and I
simply cannot allow Sun to claim ownership of the name (which is
what the JSR process does by design).  Change the API name to
something neutral, like JAX-RS.
