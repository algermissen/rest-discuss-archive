&gt;&gt; Must the client Machine be preprogrammed to know the correct format?
&gt;&gt; (Clearly, this is not extensible.)  Is there a RESTful way for 
&gt;&gt; clients to
&gt;&gt; dynamically discover the correct format?  /Roger
&gt;
&gt; [hvw] By analogy to web browsers and HTML: In the human-to-machine 
&gt; case,
&gt; nobody ever POSTS out of thin air. You POST based on information you
&gt; previously received in an HTML form. Mark Baker proposed RDF Forms
&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/ and that is one way you 
&gt; could
&gt; promote similar discovery in machine-to-machine processing. The RDF 
&gt; form
&gt; tells the invoker the media type(s) to POST.

Exactly.  The same mechanism that tells the client what URI to use
is going to define either a specific media type to use in the POST
or a range of media types based on whatever application is defined
by that mechanism.  Usually, that mechanism is described within the
client&#39;s current application state in the forms of a prior media
type (hypertext), but it could also be defined externally via an IDL
or even a command-line interface.
