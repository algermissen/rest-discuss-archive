Good grief.  Why does everyone equate REST with HTTP?  REST apps work
quite well with file, ftp, gopher, wais, urn, ...

I won&#39;t even mention waka in that list because it isn&#39;t done yet.
[Sorry, I got engaged the weekend before I gave the waka talk at
ApacheCon and wasn&#39;t prepared for the effect that has on work over
the holidays.]
