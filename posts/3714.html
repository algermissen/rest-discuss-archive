&gt;&gt;&gt; In section 5.2.1.1 of your dissertation, you open with:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any
&gt;&gt;&gt; information that can be named can be a resource: ...&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a
&gt;&gt;&gt; URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user
&gt;&gt;&gt; account).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The URI identifies the resource, not the information that is
&gt;&gt; sent in response to a GET on that resource.
&gt;
&gt; I used the term &quot;information&quot; because that is the term you used in
&gt; the quoted section of your dissertation.

It isn&#39;t the *only* information in REST.  The identified information
is an abstraction. If I have a link to

    http://bigbank.com/services/myaccount

then it is identifying the same abstraction regardless of the number
of different users that might receive different bytes in response
to successfully authenticating and accessing that resource via GET.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; As such, I don&#39;t
&gt;&gt; understand what you mean by abdicating the user account.
&gt;
&gt; In the original email, you wrote:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, that is not against REST principles.  Access control and
&gt;&gt; authorization
&gt;&gt; are the normal way of doing user-specific services.
&gt;
&gt; If HTTP Auth is used to make a user-specific service, the
&gt; resulting &quot;resource&quot; is named using the combination of the URI
&gt; and the username + password. The URI alone cannot be used to name
&gt; the &quot;resource&quot;. This means the &quot;resource&quot; is not a real resource.
&gt; It is not part of the global URI namespace.

I think you need to go back and figure out what &quot;resource&quot; means
instead of assuming that it is the information resulting from
a request.

&gt; If the user were willing to abdicate their entire user account,
&gt; they could use the &lt;userinfo&gt; part of the URI syntax to include
&gt; their username + password in the URI. I am assuming that this is
&gt; not a viable option.

Right, it isn&#39;t.  But do you see why the URI supplied above is not
user-specific even though its response may be?  Likewise, the URI

    http://bigbank.com/services/account/1234565432

is not user-specific even if only one user in the universe has
access rights to GET responses on that URI.

&gt; As a simple demonstration of this, note that it not feasible for
&gt; you to create hyperlinks to any of the &quot;resources&quot; in your online
&gt; bank account. This is true despite the fact that you have access
&gt; to these &quot;resources&quot;, using a normal WWW client. The failure of
&gt; this application to obey REST design principles has prevented the
&gt; user from sharing information in the normal WWW way.

No, that isn&#39;t true in general -- it depends entirely upon how the
app UI was designed.  Most such systems use a frame or an appserver
session that hides the URI; that isn&#39;t RESTful, but it has nothing
to so with the access control part.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It isn&#39;t.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.
&gt;&gt; A server can and will take into account the entire request when
&gt;&gt; determining which representation should be sent in response to
&gt;&gt; a request, just as it does so for determining whether the response
&gt;&gt; should be 200 or 401.
&gt;
&gt; The &quot;resource&quot; that is the user-specific resource is not a
&gt; resource. You seem to be saying that it is RESTful for the origin
&gt; server to say the resource is the conglomeration of all user&#39;s
&gt; user-specific resources. If you take this stance, you diminish the
&gt; power of REST, since the web of resources is central to REST.
&gt; Making everything one big resource defeats this.

It doesn&#39;t defeat anything that wasn&#39;t already defeated by the
nature of the application: the page cannot be placed in a
shared cached.

The purpose of REST is to model how the Web is supposed to work.
If I were to take the stance that access control doesn&#39;t fit the
REST model, then it wouldn&#39;t be the right model.  User-specific
responses via access control are no different than negotiated
response by conneg, except that access-controlled resources
default to not-shared-cacheable.

&gt; This argument is closely related to the REST argument against
&gt; using proprietary identifiers inside the body of a request. The
&gt; REST view is that the URI is *THE* identifier. This is necessary
&gt; to enable hyperlinks.

The URI is still *THE* identifier.  It identifies the same thing
regardless of who uses the URI.  But that has only an indirect
relation to the information returned in response to GET on that
resource.  If the application wishes to provide an account-specific
URI, such as the second one above, then it can certainly choose
to do so via a redirect after the initial access control exchange.
However, that doesn&#39;t make it any more (or less) RESTful.

A related example is

     file://localhost/etc/host

What is that resource?  If you think it is the file on your own
Unix-based system, you would be mistaken.  URIs identify interfaces,
not implementations.
