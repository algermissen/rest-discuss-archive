&gt; I thought REST was the STYLE! Now we have the style of a style?  
&gt; I.e, REST is substyle of the hypermedia style?

REST is a composition of constraints that come from many styles.

&gt; So I went back to the thesis to see how you defined hypermedia only  
&gt; to discover that you don&#39;t. AFAICT there is only one definition  
&gt; constraining hypermedia in your thesis: Hypermedia is defined by  
&gt; the presence of application control information embedded within, or  
&gt; as a layer above, the presentation of information. (I notice that  
&gt; assertion is not footnoted.)
&gt;
&gt; This sentence really doesn&#39;t help since it uses the phrase defined  
&gt; by not defined as.Thus, the sentence doesn&#39;t say what hypermedia  
&gt; is, it merely imposes a constraint on the concept of hypermedia --  
&gt; whatever it may be. Nowhere in the thesis is hypermedia (style)  
&gt; ever cited or defined. Or is hypermedia not a style but the single  
&gt; architectural constraint provided by the quoted sentence? All this  
&gt; kind of makes it a moving target.

*shrug*  I didn&#39;t think it needed to be &quot;defined as&quot; (at the time).
Too many of my friends are experts in hypertext research and they
probably would have poked mercilessly at my final defense.

&gt; [Current debate aside, I&#39;d be really interested to hear your  
&gt; definition of hypermedia, or even just see some pointers to others&#39;  
&gt; definitions that define it as an interaction style. All the  
&gt; definitions I&#39;ve ever seen define hypermedia as a kind of media.  
&gt; Even Ted Nelson defined hypermedia as simply the medium, not the  
&gt; style.]

See slide 35 (pp. 50-53) of

http://roy.gbiv.com/talks/200804_REST_ApacheCon.pdf

&gt; All that being said, my argument still holds. Even if hypermedia is  
&gt; defined as an interaction style (or something like a style) as  
&gt; opposed to a particular kind of media (data), a style is no more an  
&gt; engine than a set of HTML documents is an engine.

Oh, really?  I wonder what you think engine means.

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Engine

An engine is a system for transforming input into some form
of output.  The engine in a car is a system for transforming
gasoline into torque that can be applied to a drive axle.

My little bullet of a constraint

   &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;

does not say that the engine is a hypertext document.  It describes
the engine as being a hypermedia system, much like a car&#39;s engine
would be described as an internal combustion system.

I did not cite any specific reference for that because (AFAIK)
there doesn&#39;t exist any specific reference.  I was doing synthesis.
Nelson&#39;s definition is tied to what he cared about -- non-linear
writing as a form of poetry.  Conklin was entirely focused on
graphical user interfaces, so his definition is tied directly to
GUI affordances.  My observation is something that I considered
to be inherent in the design largely because the Web was based
on Engelbart&#39;s view of hypertext, but AFAIK Engelbart never actually
defined the term other than by how it was used in Augment/NLS

&gt; To support this claim, let me quote further from the paragraph in  
&gt; which the above quoted sentence appears (4.1.3):
&gt;
&gt; Hypermedia is defined by the presence of application control  
&gt; information embedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation  
&gt; of information. Distributed hypermedia allows the presentation and  
&gt; control information to be stored at remote locations. By its  
&gt; nature, user actions within a distributed hypermedia system require  
&gt; the transfer of large amounts of data from where the data is stored  
&gt; to where it is used.
&gt;
&gt; Yet again, we see that it is user actions (powered by the browser  
&gt; software) that singled out as driving the application (&quot;user  
&gt; actions ... require the transfer of ... data&quot;) -- the system does  
&gt; not drive itself.

User actions are part of the system being designed.  That paragraph
is talking about a design constraint imposed by the requirement that
the information be distributed all around the world.  Aside from using
the same term in two different ways, I don&#39;t see how that has anything
to do with your point.  Whether or not the system drives itself is
irrelevant.

&gt; Saying that hypermedia (the entire system or style) is the engine  
&gt; is like saying the entire automobile (or the architectural style  
&gt; called &quot;automobile&quot;) is the engine. It may be true in a Zen-like  
&gt; way (and believe me, I LOVE mystical philosophies), but it is  
&gt; utterly confusing to 99% of humanity.

99% of humanity was not my audience, and I&#39;ll hasten to bet that less
than 1% of humanity knows what an engine means even for something as
mundane as an automobile.

&gt; It is far clearer to the rest of humanity to say that the browser  
&gt; (or more generally user agent) is the engine of state, the user is  
&gt; the driver of state, and hypermedia is the representation of state.

The only reason that is clearer to the rest of humanity is
because it is wrong.  It&#39;s like saying the Web is defined by
what a user sees in MSIE.  I don&#39;t care how easy it may be for
a non-educated user to understand that definition: it is wrong
and I have no interest in peddling simplified forms.
