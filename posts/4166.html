&gt; I understand the multi-site issue, but not the proxy issue.  As for the
&gt; multi-site issue, I realize that this approach is not perfect.  I can
&gt; think of some ways around it, but things start to get ugly.  I suggest
&gt; that my approach reaches more of an 80/20 point.  It allows the most
&gt; common needs of transactions to occur with little overhead.

So does the approach I suggested.  Personally, I find URI-munging a
fatal flaw, even if it gets around a few current implementation issues.

&gt;&gt; And if you superset the URI space, then questions
&gt;&gt; come up about whether the new space has been checked-out, locked,
&gt;&gt; and/or has the same access control and handlers.  Yikes.
&gt;
&gt; I would think these answers would be specific to the application, not 
&gt; to
&gt; transactions in general.

Yes, but the only reason they are specific to the application is because
the transaction system is messing with *their* state, namely the set
of resource identifiers that the clients and servers are supposed
to be making actions upon.  That doesn&#39;t work through intermediaries
because the intermediary isn&#39;t prepared for the transaction software
to be changing the meaning of each user&#39;s requests.  Likewise, all
of the replay-protecting security protocols have to be aware of
the munging as well, or nothing will work.  In short, it breaks the
orthogonality of methods and identifiers.
