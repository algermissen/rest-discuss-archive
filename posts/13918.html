&gt; I&#39;m looking for additional references for architectural properties  
&gt; found in section 2.3.4 of Roy&#39;s paper?  I was curious how Roy came  
&gt; up with his list.  I&#39;ve never done a dissertation so if I&#39;m parsing  
&gt; the paper incorrectly, please let me know.

There wasn&#39;t any one reference.  There are a lot of references in the
references list, some of which define what I called a property.
Usually these are defined in the literature as software qualities
or system properties.

You might want to check the new book on Software Architecture by
Taylor (my dissertation committee chair), Medvidovic, and Dashovy:

    http://www.softwarearchitecturebook.com/
    http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470167742

though I don&#39;t know if they used the same terminology as my diss.
I am still waiting for my free copy. ;-)
