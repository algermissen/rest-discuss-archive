&gt; So how is sending DELETE over POST any safer than just allowing  
&gt; DELETE?

Not at all -- it is simply that someone needed POST in spite of the
known security hole that was created by enabling it, and that point
of view has prevailed.  The same can&#39;t be said for DELETE.  It is
really easy to define a rational security model for all of these
methods -- the hard part is getting all of the browser vendors to
implement one model.

&gt; Roy&gt; Instead of railing against the browser developers for their
&gt; Roy&gt; common sense restriction
&gt;
&gt; The point is not that they restrict it, but that the implementations
&gt; don&#39;t fully support the HTTP standard. None of them restricts DELETE
&gt; or PUT in anyway.

Umm, I remember discussion from 1994 that was specifically about
restricting methods in HTML.  Why each browser chose to not implement
certain things is a mystery, but they were certainly aware of the
methods at that time.  IIRC, they simply had no agreed UI for indicating
the distinction when the action is selected.  Somebody has to define
that for them before any such behavior can be standardized.
