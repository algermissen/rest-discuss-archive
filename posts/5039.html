That&#39;s not true.  REST only requires that the representations
supply the identifiers.  That doesn&#39;t prevent the representation
from dynamically constructing the identifier in accordance with
whatever rules are standard for the media type (e.g., HTML has
forms, server-side image-maps, and Javascript -- all of which
can generate very RESTful transitions to the next state).
