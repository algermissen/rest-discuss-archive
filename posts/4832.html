&gt; If anybody asks on rest-discuss about how to do a shopping

Heh, well, it&#39;s a nice example even with the cookies -- sometimes
just having the UI to show is enough.  I was asked the question
(for the 100th time) a few weeks ago --- how to build a shopping
cart that follows REST constraints --- and was a bit surprised
that I couldn&#39;t find any of my old e-mails on the subject.  I used
it as one the primary examples in talks about the style.

I did find a related discussion on www-talk

&lt;http://www.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1995q3/0348.html&gt;

and, lo and behold, there is a response from James Gosling
that is very close

&lt;http://www.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1995q3/0354.html&gt;

     - behaviour and state needs to be pushed out. Things like
       shopping baskets are easy to do as Java applets. Since
       there&#39;s no shared state between the client and server,
       everything is cacheable. The server gets one &quot;put&quot;
       when the customer pushes &quot;buy&quot;.

And the message I sent about it here:
