&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Client A retries the first PUT (network problems, double  
&gt; submit, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t matter) sends ETag: YYY
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand this sequence. You say the client sends ETag
&gt; &gt; XXX in step #1, but when it retries the request in step #5, it
&gt; &gt; sends ETag YYY. Did you make a typo somewhere or did you omit
&gt; &gt; things from your timeline?
&gt;
&gt; Ops, it&#39;s a typo indeed. It should be ETag XXX. I hope this clears
&gt; remaining confusion for everyone. It&#39;s supposed to be a simple retry
&gt; of the first PUT, (e.g. client A
&gt; never saw the response and want to ensure everything is fine). In the
&gt; meantime Client B saw A&#39;s changes (because he has the unforgeable YYY
&gt; ETag) and submits it&#39;s own changes.
&gt;

In that case, client A definitely wants to receive the 412, since
otherwise it will never know about client B&#39;s changes.

A more interesting question is whether the spec over-constrains the
case where a PUT is successful but tried again.  In other words, should
the server be allowed to accept the PUT if the etag differs but the
current state matches what is being PUT?  Subversion handles such
cases nicely because it is common for two developers to patch the
same bugs.  I think the &quot;MUST respond with 412&quot; is yet another case
of a bogus requirement being added in 2616.

Note: this is an HTTP spec issue, not a REST issue.
