Hi Ernie,

&gt; I want to provide a web service that, say, converts HTML documents
&gt; into various formats.   The naive RPC method would seem to be to
&gt; create a special URL string for each type, e.g.:
&gt;
&gt; 	/convert.cgi?format=pdf&document=mydocument.html
&gt; 	/convert.cgi?format=doc&document=mydocument.html
&gt; etc.

That is confusing.  Why &quot;document=mydocument.html&quot;?  Is the server
translating the input file or is it getting the file from somewhere
else?  I could understand a gateway form like

    /convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/get_it_here.html
or
    /convert/http://example.com/get_it_here.html

OTOH, a translation service like

    /convert?format=pdf

can simply be a POST of file-upload with the response being the
converted representation.

&gt; However, that doesn&#39;t seem very RESTful.

Why?  POST is RESTful too, when it is used correctly.

&gt;  I would imagine the RESTful
&gt; alternative would be to:
&gt; a) PUT the initial resource; get a URL back
&gt; b) &lt;do something to that URL&gt;
&gt; c) Return the URL describing that resource
&gt; d) GET the final resource
&gt;
&gt; But, if so, I can&#39;t figure out the RESTful way to do (b). Is there?

That would only make sense if you want the document to be stored
as a new resource that is available from then on, and the converted
forms are available via different links and/or negotiation.
In that case, you want the Alternates header field, though similar
functionality can be accomplished within the body of a 201 response.

It is relatively easy to create an HTTP server module that
provides content-conversion on the fly for anything stored within
the system.  It then becomes a resource discovery problem (how does
the client know where to obtain all of these other formats?), which
is what Alternates or Link was intended to supply.
