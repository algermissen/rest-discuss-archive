You might want to look at R=
ohit&#39;s dissertation for more exploration.
   &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit=
/&gt;

&gt;  &quot;The interaction method of sending representations of resources to 
=
&gt; consuming components has some parallels with event-based integration 
&gt; (=
EBI) styles. The key difference is that EBI styles are push-based. 
&gt; The c=
omponent containing the state (equivalent to an origin server in 
&gt; REST) i=
ssues an event whenever the state changes, whether or not any 
&gt; component =
is actually interested in or listening for such an event. In 
&gt; the REST st=
yle, consuming components usually pull representations. 
&gt; Although this is=
 less efficient when viewed as a single client wishing 
&gt; to monitor a sing=
le resource, the scale of the Web makes an 
&gt; unregulated push model infeas=
ible.&quot;
&gt;  =A0-5.4 (paragraph 4) - 
&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/=
dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm

Unregulated push models are infeasible on=
 the Web.  There needs to
be something regulating the flow of events, which=
 means aggregations
and source-based filtering.  I did not even attempt to =
address that
topic because it wasn&#39;t *my* topic.

&gt; For reference/archive d=
ata, a pull model definitely makes the most 
&gt; sense. Yet the pull model sh=
ows cracks when used for real-time 
&gt; delivery scenarios like RSS.

I think=
 the key thing that people should learn from my dissertation
is that princi=
pled design means thinking about the problem you want
to solve first, withi=
n the context you need to solve it, and then
selectively applying constrain=
ts to get the properties you want.
REST was just one example of that method=
.  A natural &quot;next step&quot;
would be to look at a different problem (say, ISEN=
s) and see what
additional constraints could be added to EBI in order to ma=
ke it
more scalable.  I would not start with REST as the basis.

&gt; It seems=
 to me that you could take all the other benefits of REST 
&gt; (standardized =
wire protocol, URIs, distributed caching, limited verb 
&gt; set) and apply it=
 to a push model (perhaps over XMPP) and see the end 
&gt; of problems like th=
is:
&gt;
&gt;  =A0 &quot;...InfoWorld.com now sees a massive surge of RSS newsreader 
=
&gt; activity at the top of every hour, presumably because most people 
&gt; conf=
igure their newsreaders to wake up at that time to pull their 
&gt; feeds. If =
I didn&#39;t know how RSS worked, I would think we were being 
&gt; slammed by a b=
unch of zombies sitting on compromised home PCs.&quot;
&gt;  =A0- http://www.infowo=
rld.com/article/04/07/16/29OPconnection_1.html

Er, or they could just cont=
ract with Akamai and they would never
see any &quot;massive surge&quot;. *shrug*

Pus=
h models suffer from a major social problem: those that gain the
most are t=
he least likely to pay for it.  For example, every news
service thinks that=
 they are the center of the universe.  Consider
what would happen if every =
blog client received an event whenever
a story was published that the news =
service *thinks* is worthy of
their immediate attention.  We already know w=
hat happens: SPAM.
To solve the scalability problem you will first need to =
regulate
that social problem, because publishers will not self-regulate.

I=
t is, however, one heck of a dissertation topic.
