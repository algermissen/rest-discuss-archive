&gt; Something that I&#39;m sure confuses a lot of folks is the fact
&gt; that in his dissertation, Roy defined &quot;Resource&quot; as a mapping.
&gt; A mapping is a relation, not a thing. But in common usage,
&gt; we talk about resources as if they were things.

Not really, though I agree most people think that way.  Natural
resources are an abstraction as well -- sure, they are &quot;trees&quot; or
&quot;oil&quot; or &quot;gold&quot; or what-have-you at any given point in time,
but when we say &quot;that land is rich in resources&quot; we are talking
about the ongoing production source of &quot;stuff we want&quot;, not
individual trees, barrels, or nuggets.  Likewise, management
often plays allocation games with resources in the abstract
before actually mapping those &quot;resources&quot; to people.  YMMV.

I agree about the confusion. It would have been easier for me to
use a different name, but then people would still think that URLs
identified files.  At least the acronym wouldn&#39;t have changed.
