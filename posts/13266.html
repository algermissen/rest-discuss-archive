Bill, if you want people to have an open mind about what you are
trying to do, then the respectful thing would be to remove REST
from the name of your site.

Quite frankly, this is the single dumbest attempt at one-sided
&quot;standardization&quot; of anti-REST architecture that I have ever seen.
It even manages to one-up the previous all-time-idiocy of IBM
when they renamed their CORBA toolkit &quot;Web Services&quot; in a
deliberate attempt to confuse customers into thinking they
had something to do with the Web.

Distributed transactions are an architectural component of
non-REST interaction.  Message queues are a common integration
technique for non-REST architectures.  To claim that either one
is a component of &quot;Pragmatic REST&quot; is the equivalent of putting
a giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as
if it were the latest fashion statement.

The idea that the community would welcome such a pack of
marketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply
ridiculous.  Just close the stupid site down.
