&gt; I suspect that the problem you have with the services style is that
&gt; it constitutes a collection of antipatterns for distributed OOP. If
&gt; so, let&#39;s document what the risks of that style are.

Ick, terminology is being misused.  OOP is a programming structure
paradigm dependent on such things as classes and inheritance.  There
is no such thing as distributed OOP.  Object-based systems is what you
get when you take OOD and distribute the objects.  It is called
object-based (instead of object-oriented) because we are talking
about architecture, rather than source code structure, and architecture
doesn&#39;t have classes and inheritance.

&gt; Communicating
&gt; to the OOP world through patterns/antipatterns is a great way to
&gt; make the case for the REST style - with the added bonus the claims
&gt; for REST will seem less grand.

That is difficult to do.  The OOPSLA community took the architectural
concept of patterns and expanded it into anything with a recipe for
implementation.  I use the original notion of patterns, which came
from Alexander watching human behavior as people live/work/move within
a space.  The closest analogy in computing is how data moves within an
architecture.  In other words, I do explain REST as a pattern, but
what people call patterns now is tuned more for programming idioms
rather than understanding system behavior.

Architectural styles and architectural patterns are fairly consistent,
but as you noted the purpose of REST is to force the developer into a
less object-specific architecture, which is contrary to most of the
OOD patterns.  Whether that is good or bad depends on what is
being implemented.
