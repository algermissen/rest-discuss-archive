&gt;&gt; Suppose the HTML snippet:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Professor &lt;a 
&gt;&gt; href=&quot;http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/pages/svenonius.html&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Elaine Svenonious&lt;/a&gt; is the author of several papers, ....
&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why does REST &#39;allow&#39; the interpretation that the author uses the URI 
&gt; to
&gt; identify a resource that &#39;is&#39; the person Elaine Svenonious?

Because REST doesn&#39;t interpret hypertext -- people do.

&gt; The person &quot;Elaine Svenonious&quot; is not directly addressable (in the 
&gt; sense
&gt; that it
&gt; does not have a location) and allowing a URI to identify it implies 
&gt; (IMHO) the
&gt; use of URIs as names (which I thought was purely an RDF/Semantic Web 
&gt; issue).

No.  All URIs are names.  Some URIs also contain what might be viewed as
an address involving multiple indirect mappings, and very few URIs
contain a directly addressed maping (e.g., file://127.0.0.1/).
&quot;http&quot; URIs, in particular, have at least one mandatory indirect
mapping, which makes them capable of referencing any concept.

&gt; Hmm, propably my non-understanding can also be expressed like this:
&gt; How can an architectural style for distributed systems use object 
&gt; references
&gt; (here URIs) as object references AND names for abstract concepts?

Because they are not object references -- they reference resources.
BTW, it is a style for network-based systems -- &quot;distributed&quot; means
something else.

&gt; [You just cannot reference an asbtract concept directly, you can only 
&gt; refer
&gt; to it by name.]

You cannot access an HTTP-based resource directly, either.
