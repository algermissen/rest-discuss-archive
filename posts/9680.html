&gt; Yeah, me too; which is why a while back I proposed sayin=

if you cut =93application=94 to =93app.=94 People weren=92t
&gt; very enthusia=

&gt;
&gt; So instead I=92ve taken to saying =93the h=
ypermedia constraint=94 or
&gt; sometimes just =93hypermedia=94 over either =
=93HATEOAS=94 or using the
&gt; full phrase. Eg. in this case it=92d be:
&gt;
&gt; S=
imilarly, form-based links that allow compliance with the
&gt; hypermedia cons=
traint require an extra trip.

The word &quot;hypertext&quot; should have been enough=
, but it actually
means very different things to different people (especial=
ly
those within the hypertext research community).  I can&#39;t just
shorten it=
 to &quot;hyperstate&quot; either, since that would imply
&quot;much more state&quot; (not what=
 we want).

It has some aspects in common with &quot;data reactive&quot; engines, as =
in

  http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/paraducks/papers/tr9605.d/

though=
 I wasn&#39;t aware of that paper until 10 minutes ago.
Much of the software ar=
chitecture research on constraints was
influenced by the GUI work on constr=
aint-based layout toolkits.

I would suggest calling it the &quot;hypertext cons=
traint&quot; when in
normal discussion, or the &quot;reactive constraint&quot; when within=

slapping distance of a literary hypertext fan.
