&gt; I&#39;m curious if anyone has any comments on this xml.com article:

&gt; After reading the thesis and this entire mailing list archive, this
&gt; article doesn&#39;t sit well with me for some reason. I can&#39;t pin point it
&gt; right now, as I&#39;ll need some more time to reflect, but there are some
&gt; areas that don&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to what I&#39;ve come to learn as REST.

It seems to be one person&#39;s suggestions on how to implement
a REST-based service.  Too bad it wasn&#39;t written that way.

It would be more accurate to say that he is interleaving REST
with SOA and some vague notion of W3C webarch, without
understanding that REST pre-dated the other two by over three
years and that both SOA and webarch cover topics beyond the
hypertext realm of REST.  He marks suggestions as [AR] to
mean &quot;arguably REST&quot;, which should really be read as
&quot;not part of REST but not specifically forbidden by REST&quot;.

BTW, just about everything he wrote about methods and use
of XML is wrong, and the stuff about query is just bad design
from SOA (nothing at all to do with REST).

Cheers,
