&gt;&gt; For example, do you want a wire transfer
&gt;&gt; deposit to fail just because you happen to be using your ATM card
&gt;&gt; at the same time?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, I don&#39;t get the analogy.

Is your entire account locked (prevented from changing) during the
ATM transaction, or does the bank merely prevent the available funds
from dipping below $400 during the transaction?  That is the essential
difference between forcing the server to implement isolation versus
letting the server figure it out how to implement its own resources.

&gt;&gt; The right thing to do is tell the server
&gt;&gt; what you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation
&gt;&gt; according to the types of resources it is trying to protect.
&gt;
&gt; True.  If the server &quot;knew&quot; that the transaction was going to be short,
&gt; devoid of GETs (at least of updated resources), limited to X number of
&gt; requests, etc., then the server may instead choose to follow a 
&gt; different
&gt; approach.

A good server isn&#39;t going to support arbitrarily long transactions
unless the state is held on the client side.

&gt; However, in my prior post, I had a concern that simultaneous access to
&gt; the same resource via the same URI (where one was outside of a
&gt; transaction and the other was inside the transaction) didn&#39;t fit my
&gt; understanding resource state.  Am I just misunderstanding it all?  For
&gt; instance, is it enough for a server to return  a response that includes
&gt; something like the following headers for a GET request within the
&gt; context of the transaction?
&gt;
&gt; Vary: X-Transaction-URI
&gt; X-Transaction-URI: http://example.com/t/123

If the state of the resource is not isolated, then there is no need.
If they are isolated, then all of the within-transaction responses
will have to be marked as cache-control private or no-cache.

Please, never prefix a header with &quot;X-&quot;.
