&gt; good points:
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I&#39;ve always assumed that constraints on a general media types must be
&gt; communicated in hypermedia (just like the URI).
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt; By &quot;general media types&quot; are you thinking there are &quot;non-general&quot;
&gt; media types that may not require constraints (on inputs, I assume) be
&gt; communicated via hypermedia?
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; But I wasn&#39;t aware of anything in HTTP that restricted the proxy
&gt; behavior this way -- and I can&#39;t think of a REST constraint on this.
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have in mind the following from Fielding:
&gt; &quot;REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be
&gt; self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard
&gt; methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange
&gt; information, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability.&quot; [1]
&gt;
&gt; I have adopted an interpretation of this section that closely follows
&gt; that described by Joe Gregorio:
&gt; &quot;...[T]he reason that RESTful systems can scale much easier ... has to
&gt; do with the amount of information that each message carries and that
&gt; is available to intermediaries without peeking into the body.&quot; [2]
&gt;
&gt; I find no direct references to &quot;not peeking into the body&quot; in Fielding
&gt; or RFC2616.

Er, in terms of REST, that is not a style issue.  In HTTP, it is
kind of obvious, so I didn&#39;t think to write it down.  You would
have to look in the http-wg archives to see all the discussion about
why length-delimited framing is better than MIME-style boundaries.
