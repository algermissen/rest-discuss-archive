&gt; Suppose you have the following:

&gt; What allows a client to know that both URI1 and URI2 reference the same
&gt; resource (assuming it knows about both URIs)?

Usually, nothing at all, though it is possible to find out by examining
RDF assertions about the resource or talking to the resource owner.
That is true even if R1 is never equal to R2, since representations
do not need to be similar.  However, it is true that the resource
cannot be anything that is not reflected in all of its representations,
even when the sole characteristic of the resource is that it be random.

See also the rarely implemented HTTP headers Alternates and URI.
