&gt; Yes. I&#39;m of the opinion that the main reason we use the word &quot;resource&quot;
&gt; rather than the word &quot;thing&quot; is that using the former makes us seem a
&gt; bit smarter than if we use the latter. However the nuances of &quot;thing&quot;
&gt; are probably more apposite than the nuances of &quot;resource&quot;.

We use the term resource because &quot;thing&quot; includes those that have yet
to be named or described, and thus cannot be individually considered
a resource by any system.

Short terminology may lessen universal understanding, but at least
it saves me from typing too many phrases.
