&gt; 1.  Roy, you really really ought to review the MetadataInURI  
&gt; finding.  You were on the TAG, it&#39;s about URIs and metadata, you  
&gt; don&#39;t like the first sentence, you know everbody..  &#39;nuff said.

Yeah, but I left the TAG in order to get some important work done, and
that isn&#39;t going to get done if I try to stick my head back into the
TAG editorial process.

&gt; 2.  There are at least a few obvious questions you didn&#39;t answer,  
&gt; fair enough.  The &quot;think for yourself&quot; line is always good advice.   
&gt; But I want to poke a little more at the question of representations  
&gt; of REST and versioning. Is REST fully completely captured for all  
&gt; time in your thesis, or is your thesis a representation of REST at  
&gt; a point in time?  That is, is the REST resource immutable or  
&gt; mutable?  Obviously your dissertation will not change but I have  
&gt; thought that the dissertation was a capture at a point in time.

Heh, I deserve a little wishful thinking.  REST is an architectural  
style.
If people can explain the style better, then yes the representation will
change even if the dissertation doesn&#39;t.  Note, however, that the first
thing anyone (other than me) does when they start describing REST is
come up with some extremely lame excuse for why the style should change
to fit their latest pet example, as opposed to just being honest about
it and describing a new style that fits their new constraints.

The habit of glomming onto the REST name, as opposed to doing what I ask
and thinking about each new architecture as an opportunity to define a
new style when the existing ones don&#39;t fit, is particularly annoying.
It is possible to completely lose most of REST&#39;s beneficial properties
by adding a single contrary constraint or relaxing one that doesn&#39;t
seem as &quot;important&quot; as the others, and very few people are capable of
recognizing that because the interrelationships in trade-offs are
actually very complex (even with a simple style).

At the same time that I encourage people to follow the design thinking
in my dissertation to discover their own styles, I would prefer that
people not use the REST name to associate those different styles with
what I defined.  Wishful thinking, perhaps, but that is what I prefer.
