&gt; The final slides are uploaded here:
&gt; http://doc.opengarden.org/REST/Introduction_to_REST

It is missing one slide.  I&#39;d point out which one, but I am curious
if anyone else can figure out what is missing from the description.

I am especially curious because almost every presentation that
tries to describe REST leaves the same bits out, and I am wondering
if it is because I explained it poorly in my dissertation or if it
is simply hard to understand why it is essential to the style.

Otherwise, it is a reasonable talk given the time limitations.
I would spend more time on the &quot;why&quot; parts, but that&#39;s just me,
and I&#39;ll be doing my own presentation at Jazoon07 anyway.

BTW, I don&#39;t understand the triangle diagram.  I have absolutely
no idea what that has to do with REST, or why it appears on the
wikipedia entry as well. YMMV.
