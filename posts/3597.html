Oh, I see what you mean.  If you look back in my dissertation,

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ 
net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_4_3
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ 
rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_3

you will notice that there is only one constraint: communication must
be stateless in nature.  The remainder of the description is simply
explaining the properties induced by that constraint and the effect it
has on architectures based on that style.

In other words, they are just two sides of the same coin.
