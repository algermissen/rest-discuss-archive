&gt; Why is there a preference, within the REST community, for URIs of the 
&gt; form
&gt;
&gt;     http://university.edu/ws/student/001
&gt;
&gt; rather than this form?
&gt;
&gt;     http://university.edu/ws/student?id=001
&gt;
&gt; Is there a specification that mandates the former or is it simply 
&gt; consensus
&gt; within the group that the former is &quot;more RESTful&quot; than the latter?

There are several reasons.  The first is simply practical: many
caches do not cache responses to requests that contain what appears
to be query information, since there is usually less of a chance
of a future hit on the same query.  Server-side caches can optimize
around that for their own common queries, but they have no way of
changing the intermediaries.

The second reason is that path is a hierarchical name space, unlike
the query.  If you are using hierarchical tools to manipulate
hierarchical spaces, it is best to avoid escaping from the hierarchy
in arbitrary ways.  A hierarchy is, after all, simply a pre-established
query with a defined order among elements.

The third reason is that there is only one query portion of a URI.
If you use it for silly reasons, then it won&#39;t be as useful for
actual queries (user-driven options).

I am sure there are other reasons -- those are just off the top of
my head.  There are also implementation-specific reasons, such as
more predefined options in Apache for handling requests in the path,
resulting in more efficient handling of blobs of data that are stored
as simple files.
