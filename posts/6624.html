&gt; &gt; No. What is the content difference between an archived invoice and

&gt; &gt; The difference should be expressed in the action (method) and the
&gt; &gt; metadata (media type), not by changing the content. That is only
&gt; &gt; possible
&gt; &gt; in a system that alters the media type based on the reason the
&gt; &gt; content is
&gt; &gt; being viewed (i.e., the resource), which in turn is only possible if
&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t rely on a single meaningless media type for message  
&gt; exchanges.
&gt;
&gt; Just to make sure I understand, you advocate a separate media type for
&gt; an invoice that the sender intends to be submitted for payment vs one
&gt; that is intended to be archived, correct?

It is just an example.  Think of it this way: your browser receives
two messages, one says it is application/quicken and the other says
it is application/logfile.  Both have identical content consisting
of an invoice.  Should your browser assume that both should be
processed as an invoice just because they have the same content?
Why should the browser behave any differently if the data format
happens to be an instance of XML?
&gt; Has anybody actually done anything like that?

Not that I know of.  It is a more extreme example of the &quot;view source&quot;
resource that I explained in the metadata finding.

&gt; And in the phrase &quot;a system that alters the media type based on the  
&gt; reason the
&gt; content is being viewed (i.e., the resource)&quot;, do you mean that a
&gt; different media type goes with a different resource, or that a
&gt; different media type indicates a different reason for viewing the
&gt; content of the same resource?

I meant different resource: same body, different metadata.
