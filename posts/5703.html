&gt; Hi Jonathan,

&gt; Is a cowpie the opposite of a cowpath?  If so, then I think the  
&gt; &#39;Opaque URI&#39; meme qualifies as one, and you just stepped in it. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Here&#39;s what Roy Fielding had to say on the topic, and I considered  
&gt; it important enough to add to the microformats-rest wiki:
&gt;
&gt; http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/opacity
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like you should join us there. ;-)

&gt;
&gt; The key, as I believe Jon Hanna said, is to make sure that clients  
&gt; do not HAVE to know the URI&#39;s internal structure, but that doesn&#39;t  
&gt; mean that *you* can&#39;t do MORE if you have appropriate  
&gt; understanding. And if enough people share that understanding --  
&gt; like a microformat -- there&#39;s nothing to prevent you from taking  
&gt; advantage of that.  As long as you don&#39;t do something that makes  
&gt; life harder for -other- people...

Er, not quite.  The key is that the server is free to tell the client
that there does exist structure in a given URI-space, and then the
client is free to make use of that knowledge in future requests.
That is how server-side imagemaps worked -- HTML says that the src
URI is structured such that appending &quot;?X,Y&quot; to that URI, where
X and Y are non-negative integers, corresponds to points on a map
that can respond to future GET requests.

Thus, one way for the server to tell the client that a given URI
is structured is to provide the URI in a standard element of a
standard media type that has been defined as such.  Another is to
include the URI in a response header field.

Note, however, that I am also one of the creators of the robots.txt
standard.  That particular scenario requires that the spider find out
the constraints on a site prior to the very first access of a real
hypertext link.  It is too late to obtain that information by
looking at header fields after a normal request is made.  Adding a
new method to HTTP was out of the question because it would have
to be deployed before it could be used [OPTIONS could fulfill that
purpose today, 12 years after robots.txt was defined].  Adding fields
to DNS wasn&#39;t an option back then, either.  Reserving /robots.txt
remains the best option given the alternatives available.

Note, however, that no other &quot;reserved URI&quot; features have the same
requirements as spiders, so it is still true that favicon and pics
chose the wrong solution.
