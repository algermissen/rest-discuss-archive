Umm, all REST theory that I know about prevents you from knowing
the extent to which one resource state is overlapped with other
resources.  In other words, the normal case is for many resources
to share the same or overlapping state, just as there can be
many different views of a clock and each clock can be separated
into subresources (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.) that have an
overlapped state with the clock.
