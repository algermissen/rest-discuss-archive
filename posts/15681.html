&gt; I hope you&#39;re implementing a REST based system for a bank one day
&gt; Roy. I love to delete some of my money using your system :-)

One day?

I&#39;d love to implement a system that let me PUT my own
bank balance, but that would be f&#39;ing stupid on the part
of the bank.  I don&#39;t build stupid systems.  REST does not
require that every data item be mapped to a resource, let
alone that every resource allow PUT and DELETE.
So why on earth would I allow a client to DELETE money?

REST is not distributed objects.  Don&#39;t get stuck thinking
that resources are like objects.  They are not.  The origin
server is in complete control over what actions are allowed
across that interface, and the nature of the results.
