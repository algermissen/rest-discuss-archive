&gt; Suppose the HTML snippet:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt;   Professor &lt;a 
&gt; href=&quot;http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/pages/svenonius.html&quot;&gt;
&gt;   Elaine Svenonious&lt;/a&gt; is the author of several papers, ....
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Is REST&#39;s interpretation of this snippet that the author uses the URI 
&gt; to
&gt; identify a resource that &#39;is&#39; the person Elaine Svenonious?
&gt;
&gt; And that the author&#39;s intention is *not* to identify a resource that 
&gt; &#39;is&#39;
&gt; the Web page.

REST is an architectural style, not an interpreter.  REST-based
components will see the anchor reference (which gives meaning),
extract the reference, obtain the URI from that reference, and
perform a retrieval action (implied by the anchor tag, not by the
URI).  What exactly the URI identifies is not relevant to the client,
since it only follows the rules of interaction called for by the
protocols.

The origin server, if a request gets that far, receives a request and
maps it to a response, using however complicated or slow a process it
might desire.  To be Turing-like, you might even place a person on
the back end that does a manual mapping for each request.  However,
for efficiency reasons, the mappings are typically arranged in advance.

REST does not define how the mapping works, and thus cannot say one
way or the other as to the URI coiner&#39;s intention.  It does know that
whether the URI identifies the person or not is irrelevant to the
meaning and nature of a successful response to the request, which
in all cases is a representation.  A &quot;Web page&quot; is actually a
construct of one or more representations as rendered by the client,
and thus is never directly identified by a URI (the first URI is
merely a starting point from which my home page is constructed as
a sequence of interactions, depending on the client configuration).

We have no way of knowing whether the URI, as used by the author,
is intended to identify the person, their home page, or some other
aspect of past responses that the author simply had no other URI
to reference.  That&#39;s why it is useful to look at the text inside
the anchor, both here and in other authors&#39; use of the URI, and
any other metadata that might be laying about.
