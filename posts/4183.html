&gt; Does that mean that session cookies are okay, as long as I use
&gt; URI syntax for the session key and the session state is
&gt; persisted?

Yes and no.  They satisfy the stateless constraint, but they lose by
creating an infinite resource space.  Sessions are rarely necessary,
but when they are necessary (such as per-client transaction state that
needs to be available via multiple devices) they should be tied to
a specific user, not the browser that user happens to be using.
Authentication is where that should be enabled.

A more REST solution for shopping carts is to keep the state on the
client, which could be accomplished simply by defining a few commerce
elements for HTML and the protocol for dealing with the checkout
(a resource referenced by those elements).  The reasons that did not
happen on the Web are purely social, not technical.
