Yes.

&gt; It&#39;s a different thing when we talk about the design of the system.  
&gt; The
&gt; developer view. Clearly in any RESTful application you _will_ have
&gt; different types of resources, no matter how you call it: A resource of
&gt; type &quot;article&quot; _will_ have different underlying business logic /
&gt; properties / behaviors etc than for example a resource of type
&gt; &quot;customer&quot;. These different resource types must be implemented in  
&gt; _some_
&gt; way. What representations does it serve? What methods does this  
&gt; resource
&gt; type allow? With which adressing-schema (URI-templates) is it  
&gt; adressable?
&gt; For example you might use a java-class ArticleResource to implement a
&gt; resource of type article. At runtime these class can manifest  
&gt; itself in
&gt; many different resource instances. Anyways - however you do it, you  
&gt; have
&gt; to have some notion of resource types. I don&#39;t see why not just  
&gt; call it
&gt; &quot;resource types&quot;?
&gt;

Because those implementations behind the interface are not the same
as the resources exposed through the interface.  Even in the simple
case, where an http URI template maps to a filesystem hierarchy, we
do not say that the individual files are the resources.  (They are
resources of their own accord, but they are not the resources exposed
via HTTP.)  They are just storage mechanisms that supply representations
when mapped from a URI.

I think I misunderstood Stefan&#39;s original question, though.
URI templates describe a naming pattern, not a resource type
or even set of resources.  Templates define a set of names.
And, yes, RDF (or anything that defines link relations) could
describe an assertion that some resource has some defined type, and
might even be extended some day to support templates in place
of URIs, but it is wrong to think of RDF descriptions as being
definitive of resources.  They are usually wrong in the long run.
