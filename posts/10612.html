&gt; Hey
&gt; In the same post, Dr. Fielding says
&gt; &quot;
&gt; it makes sense to compare REST to the
&gt; blackboard style (they do have a lot in common, as styles go).
&gt; &quot;
&gt; And the thesis says :
&gt;
&gt; &quot;the blackboard architectural style consists of a central repository
&gt; and a set of components (knowledge sources) that operate
&gt; opportunistically upon the repository&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I am just curious as to how blackboard and REST have a lot in common.
&gt; In a REST style, where is this central repository? Other than the fact
&gt; that REST could also be said to consist of a set of components (which
&gt; is also there in pipe and filter ), where is this central repository
&gt; needed to compare REST to a blackboard style ?
&gt;

I said they had a lot in common, not everything in common.
It mostly has to do with the uniform interface.
