Of course one can. Independent evolvability of components can only
be achieved if the client is prevented from knowing what exactly
will happen as the result of its requests. If it knows, then client
developers build into the system an expectation of the server
implementation that simply will not hold true over time.  Likewise,
a server doesn&#39;t understand why a client has requested X or what
sequence of requests will come next -- it just knows the current
intention of the client as expressed in the message.

Do you think that strong typing is good for a distributed system
that crosses organizational boundaries?

&gt; Further possible interpretations include deleting an /instance/ of part
&gt; 00345 from the current inventory and deleting part 00345 from the
&gt; catalogue as a whole. OTOH, the semantics of DELETE /parts/00345 is
&gt; bothclear and unambiguous;  deleting the resource identified by the 
&gt; URI.

What makes you think that /parts/00345 is not a query for part
numbers that contain the string &quot;00345&quot;?  Did the server tell you?

All servers have an infinite resource space (if we ignore URI length
limitations of some components).  Some of those resources will allow
DELETE and others will not.  When I write a server application, the
resources that I want to be authorable are a very small subset of
those that are GETable.  If you try to author a negotiated, query,
or computed resource, then I give the client an appropriate error or
redirect to the source resource.  Naturally, the source resource
is defined such that the client&#39;s intent can be unambiguously
expressed via an HTTP method.

In interface design, if you don&#39;t want users to push a button, then
placing a big note next to it that says &quot;Don&#39;t push this button&quot; is
not a good solution.  It is better to just remove the button.

In REST, a client only expresses an intent within a message.
A server is given leeway (within the scope of the method semantics)
to choose a response that fits the nature of that resource.
It doesn&#39;t need to satisfy every request with a successful response.

People who are used to distributed file system protocols get
very worried by HTTP, but it works just fine.  You just have to
relax and leave the details to late binding.
