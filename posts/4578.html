&gt; I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve read the whole discussion, Roy, because that&#39;s
&gt; part of my point.

I read it.

&gt; Would it have helped if I clarified that from the server&#39;s POV, it&#39;s
&gt; RESTful since uniform semantics are *provided*, but from the client&#39;s
&gt; it isn&#39;t since uniform semantics aren&#39;t *expected*?  Or are you saying
&gt; that REST doesn&#39;t constrain the client end of connectors?  That 
&gt; wouldn&#39;t
&gt; make much sense to me.

No, I am saying that the client receives instructions in the form
of communication with the server.  HTML FORMs are RESTful because
the standard data format HTML contains instructions for how to package
a user-entered form, when to send it, and what method to use.  If the
client has received instructions (via representations or header fields)
that lead it to believe that sending a particular form of query to
a particular URI with a particular method is something that a user
may do from its current state, then a 201 response to that query with
a Location header field is completely defined by the relevant
specifications and entirely RESTful in operation.

In short, if you can draw a state machine in which each state is
self-described (resident on the client), the transitions from
that state are also self-described (instructions for the client
to initiate), and each transition is invoked using a self-descriptive
message, then you have a RESTful application.  All of the rest
of the constraints fall out from the need to be self-descriptive
(i.e., generic methods are necessary because resource-specific
behavior is too complex to be self-descriptive).

Note, however, that it isn&#39;t necessary for all components to understand
all of the semantics.  It is only necessary for them to know when they 
do
understand them and also when they do not.  That way, applications can 
be
deployed within the subset of the network that does understand without
adversely impacting the components that do not (assuming they are
implemented according to the communication standards).

&gt; My bad.  But my point remains; that RESTfully, resources cannot be
&gt; expected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the results of 
&gt; the
&gt; specified query in the POST response, or in the form of another
&gt; resource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an
&gt; expectation is not uniform.

They can if the server told the client that such is expected.
Resource expectations are not uniform.  For example, consider
the server-side image map feature that Kevin Hughes developed.
That is an instruction to the client that for URI m, requests
of the form m?x,y will be interpreted as points on the graphical
plane of the embedded image.  The only change necessary to
enable that was a modification to the HTML standard (which was
easy to do back then).
