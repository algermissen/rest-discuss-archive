&gt; &gt; The objective is to inform the user of the results of the user&#39;s
&gt; &gt; request. If someone else&#39;s DELETE succeeded first, then a success
&gt; &gt; response would not be illustrative of the handling of the user&#39;s
&gt; &gt; request, but its handling of some other request.

&gt; Or not, apparently, after reading Roy&#39;s last response... ;-) The gist
&gt; of which seems to be that any response code is allowed when DELETE is
&gt; aimed at a resource mapping to the empty set.

Well, no, the gist of it is that any response code is possible,
no matter what the request.  The client needs to deal with all
of them.  What is the client going to do when it receives a 204?
A 404?  A 410?  How about a 456?

The point of having a flexible interface is to be flexible.
The more response codes you can map into &quot;success&quot;, the better.
