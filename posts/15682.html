&gt;&gt; A resource is never deleted.  The current representation is deleted.

&gt; How about this wording?
&gt; 
&gt; If the target URI of the DELETE request maps to the empty set, then
&gt; there&#39;s no representation to delete, and the proper response status is
&gt; 404 to reflect that.  410 is also acceptable, if the resource mapping
&gt; to the empty set *used* to have a representation.

Any status code should be expected.  If it is unclear what the status
means, then maybe the server wants to be vague.  Deal with it.

Rigidity is the enemy of long-lived systems.
