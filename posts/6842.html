&gt; I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s practical. Taking an arbitrary RPC system and

&gt; &quot;difficult&quot;, it&#39;s *design*, and machines aren&#39;t very good at design.
&gt; For example, the URIs the tool would generate (e.g. if it found a
&gt; getFoo() method) would suck, because there&#39;s typically no way (and
&gt; definitely no general way) to identify resources and their naming
&gt; structure via RPC interfaces (you&#39;re actually better off going
&gt; straight to the data). As another example, the granularity of data
&gt; access normally needs to be designed, IME; getFoo() and getBar() on
&gt; the same object might be better off as two URIs, or as a single URI
&gt; which returns both kinds of data (ala
&gt; &lt;root&gt;&lt;Foo&gt;foo&lt;/Foo&gt;&lt;Bar&gt;bar&lt;/Bar&gt;&lt;/root&gt;). There&#39;s many many other
&gt; considerations.

Right, it is often harmful to REST design to start with an RPC-style
interface and work backwards from functionality.  If a group already
has an RPC implementation, then presumably there is something wrong
with the architecture if they want to change it to the REST style.
Architectural change isn&#39;t like changing door knobs or painting
the garage a different color -- it is fundamental.  That is, unless
the RPC is already architected as a data-oriented interface, in which
case the translation is easy to automate (though extremely rare in
practice).

An interesting idea would be to look at the back-end of a working
system and try to anticipate a REST architecture on the basis of
the observed data flow.  And yet, that too is filled with risk,
since the existing RPC may be causing the data-flow to be unnatural,
which in turn is why the system needs to be redesigned.  JCR,
for example, forces the front-end to be data-oriented and then
allows the back-end to be adjusted for storage-efficiency.

I have yet to see an acceptable building that was designed by a
computer, even with extensive rule-based systems.  I see no reason
to believe a network-based application would be any different.
Sounds like a good research area, though.

Maybe I am showing my age, but there used to be a great deal of
debate about the proper way to analyze customer requirements and
design accordingly.  Much of that was suppressed by the rise of
OOD consulting.  It would be interesting to see what would happen
if someone were to dredge up Jackson System Design (JSD) methodology
and customize it specifically for REST-like architectures.
