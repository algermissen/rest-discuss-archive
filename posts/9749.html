&gt; Thanks Roy for your =
advice. So, what would be the correct HTTP  
&gt; response code in case of &quot;pa=
rtial grade upload&quot; using POST  
&gt; interface? For example, let&#39;s say we hav=
e
&gt;
&gt; POST /grade-upload/{year}/{term}/{course}
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; sec1, &quot;John Doe=
&quot;, A
&gt; sec2, &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, B
&gt; sec21, &quot;Some Guy&quot;, XX
&gt;
&gt; and server accepts t=
wo valid grades for Jane and John, but &quot;skips&quot;  
&gt; an invalid grade  for &quot;S=
ome Guy&quot;. So the response entity body could  
&gt; send back a representation =
of &quot;invalid&quot; records along with error  
&gt; messages, etc., but in terms of t=
he proper HTTP code, I&#39;m not sure.  
&gt; Does 200 seem like a good idea in th=
e situation like this (partial  
&gt; acceptance of the resource&#39;s state/repre=
sentation)? I couldn&#39;t find  
&gt; any suitable HTTP codes for  this situation=
.

Keep in mind that when you do POST there is no longer a shared
understan=
ding of the resource&#39;s state.  As such, I would probably
respond with 200 a=
nd the same index/form page with the latest
grades updated (blank if invali=
d or empty), and a link to the
equivalent content in the form of text/csv. =
 Responding with 200
and a Content-Location field equal to the requested UR=
I should
tell the client that the representation being returned is the
resu=
lting resource state.

OTOH, this type of content manipulation is what JCR-=
based
web content management products were designed to handle almost
automa=
tically.  For example, Day Communiqu=E9 has built-in support
for spreadshee=
ts and can handle both file-like updates (mapping
onto the content hierarch=
y) or direct manipulation of the
individual record fields.
