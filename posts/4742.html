&gt; I was under the impression that the degree of visibility in both cases
&gt; was identical, since the client has just as much trouble anticipating
&gt; the state of the resources as the intermediary.

They are effectively the same, yes, but visibility is a continuous 
function.
Just knowing something about the intent of the client may be better 
than nothing.

&gt; What I think you&#39;re
&gt; talking about there - please correct me if I&#39;m mistaken - is the amount
&gt; of information that can be extracted from a message.  But I wouldn&#39;t
&gt; personally call that amount of information &quot;visibility&quot; in the section 
&gt; 2
&gt; of your dissertation sense-of-the-word, since to do so, it seems, would
&gt; be akin to suggesting that &quot;getStockQuote&quot; is more visible than GET
&gt; simply because it&#39;s more specific, i.e. is equivalent to the GET
&gt; semantic plus the expected type of the data (a stock quote).

There are many variables involved in determining visibility, not just
the self-descriptiveness of the message.  For example, simplicity and
visibility are intertwined: being very specific, to the point of 
describing
all possible details, will reduce visibility regardless of how 
descriptive
the message becomes -- the additional information becomes noise.
Making the method data-specific, as in your example, creates complexity
because the expected types of data in an open system are potentially 
infinite,
but it is only when the system as a whole is considered that we find the
trade-off unacceptable.

I keep feeling that there should be an easier way to describe this stuff
so that the constraints follow from the design goals of the Web.  The 
problem
is that the design encompasses a number of independent factors that 
become
a feedback loop, with the goal of that loop being continual growth of 
the
Web itself (i.e., more information being linked-in).  For example, the 
main
reason that getStockQuote is evil, far more so than the issue of 
visibility
described above, is because then a URI alone would not be sufficient to
to identify the resource, which would mean the resource could not be
linked-in with the rest of the Web, which would mean the Web loses that
potential for growth and we all lose because the value of the Web to
each user is influenced by Metcalfe&#39;s Law.
