&gt; I noticed that while idempotence seems an important
&gt; distinguishing property of some HTTP methods, it&#39;s not
&gt; mentioned at all in REST.  Or did I miss it?

The reason it is important to HTTP/1.1 is for pipelining requests
and knowing when it should be safe to repeat the same request without
user intervention.  The only part where I briefly touch on it is when
mentioning Waldo&#39;s paper on partial failures in RPC systems.
