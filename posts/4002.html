&gt; I don&#39;t believe that the notion of a resource&#39;s state makes any sense
&gt; wrt abstract concepts so why would REST allow me to TRANSFER
&gt; REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STATES of cars, dogs or even believes?

How do you think about abstract concepts like &quot;3&quot;?  Do you think of
it symbolically (the glyph) or numerically?  If you need to explain
to someone the algorithm for calculating the area of a circle, how
do you do that?  Those are all representations.

&gt; While POSTing to &#39;presidential democracy&#39; IMHO *obviously* makes
&gt; no sense I also have serious problems with the idea of GETing a
&gt; representation of the state of &#39;presidential democracy&#39;.

Then don&#39;t provide one.  There is no requirement that all resources
have representations.

&gt; So, why does REST (&quot;REpresentational State Transfer&quot;!) include the
&gt; notion of abstract concepts in the definition of resource?

Because they are resources.
