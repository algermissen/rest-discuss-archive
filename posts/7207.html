Has anyone looked at Dream yet to see how RESTful it actually is?

    http://www.opengarden.org/dream

&quot;MindTouch Dream is a REST-based distributed application framework  
developed in Mono/.NET. With Dream, a Web service is similar to an  
object, and features interact through standard HTTP verbs. This  
design allows the developer to assume an &quot;idealized&quot; world where  
everything a service comes into contact with is accessed through Web  
requests. The Dream service library addresses common problems, and  
the Dream runtime orchestrates all interactions without requiring a  
Web server to be pre-installed on a target machine.&quot;
