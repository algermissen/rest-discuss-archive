&gt; &gt; With respect to the original topic: can anybody point out why having
&gt; &gt; *more* verbs would not be REST-ful? For instance, consider
&gt; &gt; PATCH and COPY/MOVE...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the RTF Dissertation:
&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf
&gt;
&gt; =====
&gt; Connectors
&gt; REST uses various connector types to encapsulate the
&gt; activities of accessing resources and transferring resource
&gt; representations. The connectors present an abstract interface
&gt; for component communication, enhancing simplicity by
&gt; providing a clean separation of concerns and hiding the
&gt; underlying implementation of resources and communication
&gt; mechanisms. The generality of the interface also enables
&gt; substitutability: if the users&#39; only access to the system is via
&gt; an abstract interface, the implementation can be replaced
&gt; without impacting the users. Since a connector manages
&gt; network communication for a component, information can
&gt; be shared across multiple interactions in order to improve
&gt; efficiency and responsiveness.
&gt; ======
&gt;
&gt; My view is that the &#39;generality of the interface&#39; is decreased when
&gt; additional verbs are used.

I disagree.  The generality refers to all resources having the same
interface, not all resources having an artificially limited interface.
It isn&#39;t even necessary for all resources to support the same set of
methods -- only that, when supported, they mean the same thing to all
resources.

PATCH was in my original HTTP/1.1 proposal and, assuming it is
implemented the way I described, is just as RESTful as PUT.

The limiting factor of only a few methods is a side-effect of the
architectural constraint.  Given that all methods have to mean the
same thing to all resources, there are a very limited number of
semantics that can usefully fit within a method.

&gt; Another concern is that if there are several different approaches  
&gt; for any
&gt; given task, an application has to deal with each of the approaches  
&gt; and this
&gt; can be costly. If a particular verb could be re-phrased in terms of  
&gt; other
&gt; verbs, then those other verbs are more &#39;primitive&#39;. With only a few
&gt; &#39;primitive&#39; ways of doing many things there is less need to adapt  
&gt; to many
&gt; different approaches - a cheaper way to conduct business.
&gt; For example, it&#39;s hard to argue that DELETE could be rephrased as  
&gt; GET and
&gt; vice-versa. It&#39;s easier to argue that PATCH could be rephrased as a  
&gt; PUT or
&gt; POST to a related &#39;metadata&#39; resource.

So can DELETE.  PATCH has very specific semantics and a very specific
goal of reducing bits on updates.  It is a separate method because it
needs access to the same (generic) conditional mechanisms as PUT and
because POST (when applied to an authorable resource) means append.

MOVE and COPY are namespace operations.  The problem with the
WebDAV definitions are that they target the wrong resource and then
stick another URI in an arbitrary header field.  That is due to trying
to squeeze a multitarget operation into a protocol (HTTP) that simply
wasn&#39;t designed for multiple targets.  The target should be the
collection that is being changed.  This is an architecture detail,
not a question of architectural style.

REPORT, on the other hand, is just plain evil.  It is bad architecture,
violates REST, avoids giving a URI to important resources, and tunnels
arbitrary methods through HTTP.
