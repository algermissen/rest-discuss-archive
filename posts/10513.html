&gt; With both POST and PUT what is sent in the request is an &quot;entity&quot;

That is incorrect.  The &quot;entity&quot; in HTTP messages is just a
representation as payload.  A POST entity is usually a representation
of an input form, though it may be other things (an appendage, a new
atom entry, etc.).  A PUT entity is a representation of the intended
result state for the requested resource.  Likewise, the entity within
a response is always a representation of something -- that something
can be determined by the looking at the status code.
