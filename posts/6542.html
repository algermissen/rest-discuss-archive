&gt; The basic concept I am trying to portray is that a resource is a  
&gt; set, in fact
&gt; that is what Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation calls it:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;[A] resource... maps to a set of entities...&quot;

The correct quote is

&quot;a resource R is a temporally varying membership function MR(t), which
  for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, which are equivalent.
  The values in the set may be resource representations and/or resource
  identifiers.&quot;

A resource is a membership function. A membership function is not a set.
The value of that function for a given time t is a set.  The resource is
the continuity of those values over time, not the value at any given
instant in time.

Your analogy starts off on the wrong foot by talking about resources
in terms of how they might be implemented (a box of apples).

A better framework for an analogy is a double-sided wall of pigeon-hole
boxes, with doors, a button, and a label per box on each side.  The
client side of the wall can only see the labels on their own side.
The server side of the wall can only see the labels on their own side.
When the client pushes a button, the button on the opposite side  
lights up.
The server side then opens their door, places something corresponding to
their server-side label in the hole, and closes their door -- causing  
the
corresponding client-side button to light up. The client then opens the
door, grabs what was placed in the hole, and closes their door.   
Finally,
the client decides whether or not to change the label on their side of
the door based on what was received when the button was pushed.  The
client has no idea what is behind the door or how the holes get filled.

&quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; are only used here for a directional sense, so
variations an be made for writing (e.g., the client could place
something in the hole first and then push the button, or there
could be more than one type of button, etc.).

Now you can add apples and oranges to that framework and make an
analogy.
