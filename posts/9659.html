I wasn&#39;t going to point to that one until after my talk
today at Ra=
ilsConf Europe in Berlin.  The Jazoon one had to be
reduced from 1 hour to =
30 minutes (found out the day before),
and even then it was far too rushed.=
  I am standing on stage
at a stadium-style movie theatre, with a big-scree=
n projection
of my slides way over on the right and a projection of what yo=
u
see on the video above my head.  I couldn&#39;t see the audience
of 600 or so=
 people, and they weren&#39;t looking at me anyway,
so the whole experience was=
 a bit disjointed.

Surprisingly, it sounds much better that what it seemed=
 like
while I was on stage, though the audio-leveling takes a bit of
the va=
riation out of my voice (i.e., will put you to sleep).
But I always hate wa=
tching myself on TV.

Today&#39;s talk should be better.
