&gt;&gt;&gt; The request could not be completed due to a validation failing  
&gt;&gt;&gt;=
 against
&gt;&gt;&gt; the sent entity. This code is only allowed in situations where=
 it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; expected that the user might be able to resubmit the request wit=
h  
&gt;&gt;&gt; valid
&gt;&gt;&gt; content and where the sent content was syntactically corr=
ect  
&gt;&gt;&gt; according
&gt;&gt;&gt; to its media type. The response body SHOULD include=
 enough  
&gt;&gt;&gt; information
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the user to recognize the source of the c=
onflict.  
&gt;&gt;&gt; Invalidations are
&gt;&gt;&gt; most likely to occur in response to a =
PUT or POST request.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yep, that&#39;s what I would do, though a properly s=
pecified response  
&gt;&gt; code
&gt;&gt; would never include that second sentence &quot;Th=
is code is only  
&gt;&gt; allowed ...&quot;
&gt;&gt; since servers are always right (and ne=
ver omnipotent).  And the last
&gt;&gt; sentence is kind of goofy -- request payl=
oad is unlikely to be
&gt;&gt; invalid when it isn&#39;t present.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do you want m=
e to standardize it?
&gt;
&gt; Yes please.

Actually, Julian just pointed out to =
me that WebDAV already
defined a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code whi=
ch is
probably sufficient

    http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.htm=
l#STATUS_422

so I guess I don&#39;t need to write that I-D after all.
Unless t=
here is some reason that you can&#39;t use 422?
