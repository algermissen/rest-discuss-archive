&gt; I am going to make an argument otherwise.
&gt;
&gt; In section 5.2.1.1 of your dissertation, you open with:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any
&gt; information that can be named can be a resource: ...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a
&gt; URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user
&gt; account).

The URI identifies the resource, not the information that is
sent in response to a GET on that resource.  As such, I don&#39;t
understand what you mean by abdicating the user account.

&gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.

It isn&#39;t.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.
A server can and will take into account the entire request when
determining which representation should be sent in response to
a request, just as it does so for determining whether the response
should be 200 or 401.

&gt; Therefore, the application is not RESTful. Conclusion: ACLs are
&gt; not RESTful.

That is a bizarre conclusion.  If that were the case, I would have put
a section in the dissertation explaining why one of the central features
of HTTP isn&#39;t modeled by REST.
