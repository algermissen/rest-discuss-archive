&gt; &gt; Neither REST nor HTTP would care. I would send 200 or 204,
&gt; &gt; because there is no equivalent of a &quot;rm -f&quot; (i.e., remove even
&gt; &gt; if it doesn&#39;t exist&quot;) in HTTP. If the client actually wants
&gt; &gt; to check that it exists, then the request would include an
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If-match: * 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and the precondition failed response would then be required.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So 2xx/4xx only indicates that the request was accepted/rejected,
&gt; without implying that any processing happened as a result of the
&gt; request?

Processing did happen.  The resource was identified, the existence
of representations was checked, and the end result is what the client
requested (that the resource be placed in a state of having no
current representation).  DELETE is idempotent.
