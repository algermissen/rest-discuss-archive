&gt; So, services (even those that look like verbs) can be stateless

Er, services that &quot;look like verbs&quot; are just confusing -- the question
is whether they behave according to the uniform methods applied to them
or not.  If you send it a GET, what happens?  If you send it a POST,
what happens?  How about PUT?  As long as the service doesn&#39;t go out of
its way to violate some other constraint (such as GET resulting in a
modified resource state), then how it looks shouldn&#39;t matter.

&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a different beast -- it is a gateway, and it would &quot;look&quot;
&gt;&gt; more RESTful simply by choosing a different URI syntax, e.g.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   http://myconverter.com/pdf/http://example.com/get_it_here.html
&gt;
&gt; Ah, I get it.  If, for example, it always returned the result as:
&gt;
&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?result.html
&gt;
&gt; That would be non-RESTful (er, unprincipled? :-), because it doesn&#39;t
&gt; actually create real resource.

You mean, if it redirected (or gave 202 response with a link) the client
to a different resource called

    http://myhost.com/convert?result.html

right?  It would still be RESTful.  It just wouldn&#39;t be very useful,
since all that identifies is a resource whose state is the most
recently completed conversion.  OTOH, if that is the resource that
you happen to want (as in, for example, a monitoring app), then maybe
it is useful enough.

A better way to think of the problem is to work backwards from the
end result.  What do you want the state of the system to be at the
completion of N requests (potentially parallel, multiple clients)?

Hint: A RESTful system progresses from one steady-state to the
next, and each such steady-state is both a potential start-state
and a potential end-state.  I.e., a RESTful system is an unknown
number of components obeying a simple set of rules such that they
are always either at REST or transitioning from one RESTful
state to another RESTful state. Each state can be completely
understood by the representation(s) it contains and the set of
transitions that it provides, with the transitions limited to a
uniform set of actions to be understandable.  The system may be
a complex state diagram, but each user agent is only able to see
one state at a time (the current steady-state) and thus each
state is simple and can be analyzed independently.  A user, OTOH,
is able to create their own transitions at any time (e.g., enter
a URL, select a bookmark, open an editor, etc.).
