&gt;&gt; The resource in HTTP is the mapping from the entire identifier
&gt;&gt; (including scheme, authority, path, and query) to a set of values.
&gt;&gt; For two resources to be the same, they must map to the same set
&gt;&gt; of values for all time.  There is no way to determine that by
&gt;&gt; inspecting the identifiers, aside from scheme-defined equivalence.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I assume here by set of &quot;values&quot; you don&#39;t mean set of  
&gt; representations returned. These are the values as known to the  
&gt; server, from which it creates and sends representations down to  
&gt; clients. Is that correct?

resource values at time t = { representations | URIs }

also known as representations or redirects.
