&gt; Does this make sense now?

Not really.  An HTTP server&#39;s URI-space has nothing whatsoever to do
with its storage space, aside from that created by the handlers within
that space.  In other words, what you name the URIs and how the messages
are extracted from relevant storage is defined entirely by the handler
you write for the URIs.  See mod_mbox, for example.
