You mean REST-based HTTP, right?  We don&#39;t need to &quot;auto-discover&quot;
an HTTP interface because the communication API is a standard and
the parameters are defined by the current representation.  We do
need to discover the initial resource, and that&#39;s exactly what
Yahoo, Google, and URIs written on napkins do for us.  Any well-known
website for &quot;finding services&quot; would do the same.
