&gt;&gt; for that is not REST or Web Architecture (though both are  
&gt;&gt; specifically
&gt;&gt; designed to enable it): the reason is network economics as expressed
&gt;&gt; by power laws, Metcalfe&#39;s law, PageRank, and a hundred other
&gt;&gt; restatements of the factors that place value on social networks.
&gt;
&gt; I understand how that should help search engines count how many  
&gt; references there are for calculating page rank, but could you  
&gt; elaborate how canonical URLs affect &quot;Metcalf&#39;s law, power laws, and  
&gt; a hunder other restatements...&quot;

Too hard to summarize.  This might help explain it.

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank

Canonical URLs means that new links are created to the same URL as
previous links, which increases linked-to values, which increases
both the perceived node value of a hub and the corresponding values
of the nodes that link to that hub.

&gt; I did take the canonical URL thing to heart in our new  
&gt; architecture. It may be a bit over-designed but we generate  
&gt; controllers that canonicalize by dropping trailing slashes and even  
&gt; reordering the query parameters. For example:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&p=4&o=a
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&o=a&t=java
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&o=a&p=4
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&t=java&o=a
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&p=4&t=java
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&p=4&o=a
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&o=a&t=java
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&o=a&p=4
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&t=java&o=a
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&p=4&t=java
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&t=java&p=4
&gt;
&gt; All get redirected to:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4

Why don&#39;t you redirect to a permalink style URI?  The ? will reduce
your cache effectiveness, and is mighty ugly.  Well, I guess for
&quot;give me a list of java articles sorted by title&quot; that is okay,
since the articles themselves seem to have permalinks.  Note that

    http://www.artima.com/articles/java/index;date;p4

is short and says more.  YMMV.

&gt; Currently there is one URI that doesn&#39;t get redirected to the  
&gt; canonical form. It&#39;s on my list to fix that:
&gt;
&gt; http://artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4

Yep, I have the same problem with aliases to gbiv.com.  Unfortunately,
my ISP seems to use mod_rewrite&#39;s &quot;final rule&quot; within the virtual host
section, so the easy fix doesn&#39;t work for me.
