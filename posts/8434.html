&gt; I&#39;m curious to know if you were asked to review the forthcoming
&gt; (already-out ?) &quot;RESTful Web Services&quot;. I haven&#39;t read it, but
&gt; have read Sam Ruby&#39;s blog over the years and am wondering how
&gt; well his ideas map to your (i.e., the correct by definition)
&gt; concept of REST.

I was asked to review an early draft, but I don&#39;t know how far that
was (or is) from their current draft.  I really don&#39;t have the time.
Sam&#39;s a smart guy -- he&#39;ll figure it out once he has to explain it.

&gt; If that book becomes popular, which it seems it will be based on
&gt; the response, it may become the working defintion of REST to many
&gt; people, which, *if* it is missing important aspects of the
&gt; definition, would be a shame.

*shrug*  I don&#39;t see how that is any different from any of the other
technologies depicted on bookshelves everywhere.  The book isn&#39;t the
one that I would write, but then neither are any of the books on HTTP.
