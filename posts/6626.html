&gt;&gt; Standard UI affordances are like &quot;hypertext = GET, button = POST,

&gt;&gt; that represent the action and allow the user to be aware of the type

&gt; Hmm. I&#39;m puzzled about how to present what it is they&#39;re going to
&gt; PUT/DELETE. Don&#39;t yet see an action here.

That would depend on what was being deleted.  It could be a button
on the browser frame for &quot;delete this resource&quot;, or it could be an
icon next to each entry on a page that looks like a folder tree, or
it could be a button on the bottom of a scrollable list of URI
references, or it could be a button next to the edit link on a blog
entry.  I am sure there are other URIs that could be deleted, so
basically anything for which the client has a URI could be a
potential target for a DELETE, though it would only be presented
as such when appropriate or when the current page requests it in the
form of an &lt;input method=&quot;DELETE&quot;&gt; (or something like it).

Likewise for PUT.  Every MS application has the same icon for
&quot;Save to disk&quot; -- we should have one for &quot;Save to Web&quot; too.

&gt;&gt; Nothing specific off-hand.  All you need to logout of an HTTP session
&gt;&gt; is a UI for telling the browser to stop sending its cached  
&gt;&gt; credential,
&gt;&gt; which was obvious to everyone except the browser developers.
&gt;
&gt; Oh... you mean stop sending HTTP authentication credentials (I was
&gt; thinking cookies). Yah, we need an HTML widget for that. Firefox
&gt; already has that functionality exposed in chrome. I&#39;ll see if I can
&gt; get that implemented... I can do the backend, but I might need help to
&gt; implement the widget.

Yep, there&#39;s nothing we can do about cookie auth aside from removing
the reasons to use it.
