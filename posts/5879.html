&gt; As for the remainder, I&#39;m really not sure what you&#39;re talking about  
&gt; (more details, please). For instance, RFC3253 (Versioning)  
&gt; introduces separate URIs for version histories and versions (basic  
&gt; versioning).

They are all in the archives Julian.  WebDAV is history and my only
interest in it is for legacy support.

&gt;&gt; The problem with MOVE is that it is actually an operation on two
&gt;&gt; independent namespaces (the source collection and destination
&gt;&gt; collection).  The user must have permission to remove from the
&gt;&gt; source collection and add to the destination collection, which
&gt;&gt; can be a bit of a problem if they are in different authentication
&gt;&gt; realms.  COPY has a similar problem, but at least in that case
&gt;&gt; only one namespace is modified.  I don&#39;t think either of them map
&gt;&gt; very well to HTTP.
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; That seems to be a problem with the concept of moving resources  
&gt; around, not with the actual definition of the MOVE method, right?

No, it is a problem with specifying multiple arguments when both the
syntax and the access control mechanism assume there is only one.
It doesn&#39;t quite fit in the original HTTP syntax.
