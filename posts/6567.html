&gt; I&#39;m getting ready to release documentation for a REST-style API for
&gt; Blinksale.com, an online invoicing application. I&#39;d be keen to get
&gt; this group&#39;s feedback on the design before formally announcing it to
&gt; the world. Any and all criticism or suggestions for improvement, both
&gt; of the documentation and the API itself, is welcome. Have a look:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.blinksale.com/api

I am curious as to why it is using &quot;application/xml&quot; as the media
type instead of something more standardized.  Was something like the
Visa XML Invoice (or any of the other various attempts) considered?
If considered, were they rejected due to complexity or for some
other reason?  [Just curious because the network benefits of
automated invoice processing are enhanced by a standard invoice
format rather than a unique one for each customer.]
