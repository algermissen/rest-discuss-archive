&gt;&gt; Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,
&gt;&gt; as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav
&gt;&gt; implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to
&gt;&gt; a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes
&gt;&gt; such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the
&gt;&gt; method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources
&gt;&gt; (even if some may not allow it).
&gt;
&gt; But does HTTP happily accept either alternative?  Or does HTTP
&gt; standarize on one or the other method?

HTTP doesn&#39;t tell applications how to do a sequence of actions.
It only defines what each action means and how the client should
interpret the response to each action.  WebDAV is a little more
explicit about sequences, which is why it prefers MKCOL and would
probably reject a deep PUT.

&gt;&gt; If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other
&gt;&gt; links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,
&gt;&gt; then you should not delete the container unless you want all of
&gt;&gt; those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.
&gt;
&gt; What do you mean by &quot;the server automatically maintains links?&quot;

Many content management products (like Day Software&#39;s Communique)
include an automatic link maintenance function that will recognize
a delete on a resource and either note all links to it as being
broken (and thus scheduled for review) or simply deactivate those
links so that they don&#39;t show up on the published pages until someone
either changes the destination or restores the deleted resource.
