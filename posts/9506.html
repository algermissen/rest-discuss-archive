I suggest you do some research on the Khoros system developed by UNM
back in 1990-91.  It would have been a significant system if the PIs
hadn&#39;t succumbed to greed.

The legacy bits are now known as AccuSoft VisiQuest.

    http://www.accusoft.com/products/visiquest/overview.asp

though it does not appear to be much of an improvement over the
original system.  It was originally distributed in source code form,
so you might be able to get the original code from someone else
in your research specialty.

Cheers,
