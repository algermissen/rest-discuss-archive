&gt; But you didn&#39;t address the (apparent) tension between bookmarking/ 
&gt; deep-linking and REST, which was my original question. Bookmarking  
&gt; takes a dynamically generated bookmark and effectively makes it  
&gt; static -- at least it&#39;s static (persisted) on the client side. As  
&gt; more and more clients bookmark more and more of the URIs they  
&gt; receive, the more they are incrementally &quot;fixing&quot; the original URI  
&gt; space.
&gt;
&gt; Hence my point: encouraging promiscuous bookmarking of (deep) links  
&gt; seems to be at odds with REST&#39;s desire to minimize &quot;entry point&quot;  
&gt; URIs. Do you see the tension as well, or am I missing something  
&gt; that resolves the tension?

Why do you think that there is a desire in REST to minimize the
number of entry points?

&gt; Devdatta makes the excellent point earlier in the thread about &quot;how  
&gt; blogs require you to permalink instead of the page you are  
&gt; viewing.&quot; It seems that perhaps there is an implicit REST  
&gt; constraint that is beginning to become more explicit. Roughly, REST  
&gt; distinguishes two types of URIs:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;entry point&quot; type URIs, which may be bookmarked indefinitely.  
&gt; These are Cool URIs.
&gt; &quot;transitional&quot; type URIs, which may not be bookmarked indefinitely.  
&gt; These are unCool URIs. I call then &quot;transitional&quot; given that their  
&gt; role is typically to enable transition to the next state.

No.  There are some crappy web applications that expose what you would
call a transitional (partial web state) URI to the client because
they are badly written to expose an old terminal screen interface
as intermediate HTML forms, but I would not call such a system RESTful.
Those URIs are not identifying resources.

Permalinks provide a URI to the article resource that is independent
of its current representation (usually, the representation of some feed,
which is not the same resource and hence requires the provision of a
permalink URI for people to bookmark).  It is just hypertext and has
the same role in REST as the list of summaries that Google returns
in response to a search.

&gt; I&#39;m not wedded to the names (you could call them internal/ 
&gt; external), but I do think this distinction between types of URIs is  
&gt; an important aspect of REST that, so far, has not been clearly  
&gt; outlined. It certainly seems to be in play in the permathread  
&gt; debates regarding whether &quot;URIs should be RESTful or not&quot; (and  
&gt; whether that designation is even a meaningful one). I also think  
&gt; the distinction is a bit at odds with the common understanding of  
&gt; URIs on the Web that ANY URIshould be a bookmarkable URI, ie that  
&gt; ALL URIs should strive to be Cool.

I won&#39;t repeat my opinion about opaque URIs.  If there is a
tension between the desire to bookmark and the fact that REST
encourages folks to break up an application into a state
machine of reusable resource states, then I would consider it to be
more like sexual tension.  Just because you have it doesn&#39;t mean
it is bad, and one way to improve things is to make the more
important resource links look sexier than the less important ones.

&gt; I think it&#39;s a pretty major change in Web architectural thinking  
&gt; (or at least emphasis) to now say (effectively) that a significant  
&gt; class of URIs should NOT be cool, ie one should NOT expect them to  
&gt; be useable indefinitely. In a way, this harks all the way back to  
&gt; Parnas&#39;s admonition that we hide information that is likely to  
&gt; change. Using modern web-speak, REST seems to admonish us to &quot;hide&quot;  
&gt; the URIs that are likely to change (unCool URIs) and &quot;expose&quot; only  
&gt; those URIs that are likely to stay the same (Cool URIs). But  
&gt; nothing I&#39;ve seen in the desciptions of Web Architecture (eg  
&gt; AWWWv1) remotely suggests that some URIs should effectively be  
&gt; hidden, or per my previous point, not bookmarked. If anything, Web  
&gt; Architecture descriptions at least imply that all URIs SHOULD be  
&gt; &quot;exposed&quot; and bookmarkable.

&quot;All important resources should be identifiable by URI.&quot;

I think you should look at each of those words in turn and
consider why they were chosen.  That particular quote is from

    http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2002/01-uriMediaType-9
and
    http://www.w3.org/2002/04/22-tag-summary

but it was also in the first drafts of the TAG&#39;s webarch.  That
principle was not new -- I remember TimBL mentioning it during his
keynote in Geneva, May 1994, and it dates from Engelbart&#39;s work:

   http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/augment-132082.htm#11K

which in turn influenced my design when HTTP/1.0 needed finishing.
By definition, working on improving the Web Project meant increasing
the number of Web-accessible resources.

Here is a more recent variation on the same theme that I just ran
across while doing a search:

http://derivadow.com/2007/12/28/web-design-20-its-all-about-the- 
resource-and-its-url/

Other things that might be worth keeping in mind is that REST is
designed for reuse, not just use.  The notion that anyone has control
over a successful application&#39;s reuse is pure fantasy, as described in

&lt;http://www.w3.org/mid/E6416F61-E40C-4DE6-8B7A-D8A94EE8537B@...&gt;
