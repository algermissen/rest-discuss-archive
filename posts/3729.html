&gt; You all appear to be arguing for or against one of
&gt; these positions, but it is not clear which.

Not really.  I was arguing against a claim that simply is not
true about REST.

&gt; Here is an example to clarify this distinction.
&gt; The choice is between
&gt;
&gt; (1) CookieBank uses cookies or auth to provide
&gt; access to a customer payment at URL:
&gt;
&gt;   http://CookieBank.com/accounts/payments/12

That is not a likely scenario.  Applications working within an
account context will typically use a company-unique payment ID or
one that is account-specific.  A more realistic example is the &quot;top&quot;
page, which is often made account-generic specifically because
the company wants customers to bookmark a single URI for the
initial access point.  It is not identified with an account
number because the user is going to choose from their accounts
after visiting that page.

&gt; (2) RestBank tops CookieBank by making URIs for
&gt; specific payments visible in the &quot;Location&quot; bar
&gt; so users can forward them to others:
&gt;
&gt;   http://RestBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12

The purpose would be for auditing, not sharing transactions.

&gt; My opinion:
&gt;
&gt; REST and Authentication are orthogonal, but that
&gt; people frequently abuse authentication to make it
&gt; unrestful.  So, RESTAuthenticateBank is RESTful,
&gt; but CookieBank is not.

Authentication is orthogonal.  Cookies are also orthogonal when
they are simply used for content negotiation or authentication.
However, Cookie authentication is not allowed in REST because it
lacks visibility, which causes security problems because the other
components don&#39;t know it is sensitive information.

If the semantics of the request is determined by the contents of
authentication or cookies, then that in non-RESTful.  All of the
examples I used were requests with the semantics determined entirely
by the URI and only the response content determined by the request
metadata. That is why the exchange remains RESTful, because the URI
is universally applicable (means the same thing) for other users
even though the content exchanged will be user-specific.  Likewise,
a user-specific URI that is access-controlled for a single user
is universally applicable even if the rest of the universe is denied
access -- the semantics are clear from the request method and URI.

&gt; CookieBank WOULD be restful if it sent a
&gt; content-location header that specified the URI of
&gt; the underlying resource.

No, content-location was an attempt to set the base URI for
embedded relative URIs, but it has not been implemented sufficiently
to make it useful for even that purpose.  It cannot be used to
compensate for multi-semantic URIs, such as a single URI being
used for many different types of request via POST, because
visibility of those actions must occur in the request (prior
to the response being generated).
