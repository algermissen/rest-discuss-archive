Now now, Bob -- stop toying with the kids.  Phil told me back
in the eBuilt days (2000) that you were an expert in inventory
control programs for ERP, so I expect you know the answer to that
problem better than I do.

REST does not have a solution to distributed (more than one
central server) transaction problems, other than to use
server-side intermediaries to change the problem itself.
REST doesn&#39;t even try to solve that problem, since it is
behind the server interface.

IIRC, the multi-market problem is known to be intractable
even for strict transaction protocols.  We end up doing the
same thing that everyone else does, which is to use journaling
of orders and either compensating transactions or strict
separation of inventory between sites (with periodic rebalancing
of inventory as stocks decrease).  I think the farmer could
be provided with a RESTful application for tracking and
rebalancing inventory across multiple sites, but I wouldn&#39;t
call that a RESTful solution to the inventory problem itself.
It just works well enough to keep the farmer happy.
