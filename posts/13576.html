&gt; Roy says[0], &quot;A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive

&gt;
&gt; I have situations where formats such as Atom are fairly well-suited to
&gt; represent my resources.  If I re-use the format and keep the content
&gt; type &quot;atom+xml&quot;, then client&#39;s wouldn&#39;t know my specific usage of atom
&gt; (e.g. semantics behind some of my &quot;rel&quot; attributes).

Link relations are universal, independent of the format in
which they are found, though perhaps only used with a target
that is in a specific format (by practice, not by standard).
The fact that some media type specifications also introduce
new link relations does not make the relations specific to
those media types.
