&gt; What do you call the concept of &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;types&quot; of resources in
&gt; your RESTful designs? E.g. when you decide to turn each &quot;customer&quot;
&gt; into its own identifiable resource - http://example.com/customers/1234
&gt; - what does http://example.com/customers/{id} describe? Both &quot;resource
&gt; class&quot; and &quot;resource type&quot; would work, but don&#39;t seem really

We call them resources.  If they had types, they would be strongly
coupled to whatever expected that type.
