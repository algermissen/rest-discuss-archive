&gt; &gt; If you find yourself in need of a distributed transaction

&gt;
&gt; P.S. In this previous message to this group:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4150
&gt; You appeared to be saying something different:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;This topic has come up a few times on webdav and http-wg lists.
&gt; The transaction is a resource, but the relationship between it and
&gt; the requested resource can be accomplished via a header field that
&gt; defines each request as a sequenced resource within a hierarchical
&gt; transaction. In other words, ask the server for a transaction begin,
&gt; send the URI it gives the client in each request as a header field
&gt; with a request number appended to it, and finally abort or commit
&gt; the transaction as a final request to the transaction&#39;s URI. That&#39;s
&gt; basically how I did it for the still-vapor waka protocol.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Do I misunderstand?
&gt;

No, I just found it to be useless for REST.  It might still
be needed for non-RESTful use of the same protocols.

I tried out the above and then simplified it out of the protocol.

My thinking is that the above exchange is equivalent to the
server providing an independent set of resources to the client
(i.e., any state-changing actions by the client are automatically
isolated by being in a client-specific workspace) and then the
commit is just another button on a web page (or the equivalent
typed element/relation in your favorite media type).  The problem
is therefore teaching the client which action to select, not
what transaction protocol to be aware of.

&gt; By the way, that&#39;s not the design I have in mind, but I&#39;d like to
&gt; understand it better.
&gt;

So would I.

&gt; The use cases I have in mind all involve B2B automated
&gt; order-fulfillment and related scenarios.
&gt;

Yep, multiparty contract agreement?  I know of many scenarios
in which the resources depend on some sort of transaction-like
semantics on the back-end because they are dealing with multiple
parties.  I don&#39;t know of any where the client needs to be aware
of it.

The same is generally true of ACID database transactions --
all of the work is done on the servers, with the client&#39;s
awareness limited to the commit/cancel decision (or fail).
Where REST differs is that the client can&#39;t make arbitrary
changes to the database, so there is no need for a REST
client to be aware of the begin-transaction semantic.

At least that&#39;s my theory -- it could be wrong,
