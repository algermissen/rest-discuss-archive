&gt; In hindsight, trying to make HTTP stateful seems to be such an

&gt; there really were no good reasons.

See Brian Behlendorf&#39;s early proposal for a State header field
(mostly to keep track of netnews-style articles read) and later
discussion of Netscape Cookies, both on www-talk archives.

There were also a lot of contemporaneous complaints about
statelessness with regards to gateways, particularly of the
screen-scraping kind interfacing with old mainframe apps.
