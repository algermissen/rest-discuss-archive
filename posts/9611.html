This seems to come up quite often.  I fail to understand what
people are complaining about.  Javascript running within a browser
context is inherently untrusted.  Untrusted scripts should not be
allowed to perform unsafe actions without user intervention, period.
The only reason POST is allowed (and only to the host where the
script came from, hopefully) is because there is no other method
for sending payload-driven safe queries.

It&#39;s like the farm kids I met once in Germany, who thought they
could trick us suburban visitors into pissing on an electric fence.
I don&#39;t know what they were trying to say to convince us it would
be okay (not having much grasp of the language at age 12), but it
sure didn&#39;t take much imagination to figure out the right answer.

Instead of railing against the browser developers for their common
sense restriction, we should be designing a framework under which
a browser can know which methods are allowed silently, which methods
are allowed with user confirmation, and which methods are not allowed
at all.  Then the framework can be defined with configurable defaults
for browser context versus extension context, and with the ability
to override those defaults under certain conditions.  If someone
takes the time to do all that, just as other people previously took
the time to define security contexts for applets and related things,
then I am sure the browser vendors will be happy to standardize
on one security framework for XHR.
