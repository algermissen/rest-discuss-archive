&gt;&gt; On the other hand, in my experience it&#39;s easier to build code

&gt;&gt; fixed URL structure, and if you only imagine having one (or few)  
&gt;&gt; clients
&gt;&gt; to a single service, hypermedia might be an overkill.
&gt;
&gt; Also, hypertext for simple case tends to need two calls, one the
&gt; bootstrap document to find the link, and two, to the actual link you
&gt; care about. Whereas a fixed url scheme on the client means one call.

Yes, a RESTful system is at least one level of indirection away
from a strongly coupled system.  A fixed URL scheme is essentially
the same as baking the first representation into each client.

Is that surprising?

Likewise, a RESTful system is always going to be less efficient
than a system designed for a static set of clients accessing
a small set of services that never change.

A lot of people think of systems as static things.  Dead things.
REST is not going to appeal to those people.  All of its constraints
are designed to keep systems living longer than we are willing
or able to anticipate.
