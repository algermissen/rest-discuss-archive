&gt; To execute a join, REST seems to require that you

No, if you are trying to do a join then you have already escaped REST&#39;s
constraints.  REST does not allow the client to know that the server
is a relational database.  Therefore, it only allows requests on
resources established by the server via its defined URIs (any resource
can be crafted similar to a stored procedure) or queries.  Naturally,
a query can be constructed to pass all of the information for a
SELECT statement, but it would still separate the client from the
server implementation by not allowing the client to send arbitrary SQL.

Day Software&#39;s Communique (my employer) does that by providing both
the table cell addressing hierarchy and URI mappings to stored
procedures/queries.

The rationale for REST being different from RDA, aside from greater
flexibility of implementation, is that remote data access interfaces
are extremely susceptible to abuse by rogue clients.  DBs are simply
not designed for anarchic scalability -- only friendly scalability.
