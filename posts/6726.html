&gt; It&#39;s not a problem, per se - I just wanted to get feedback from the  
&gt; group about my proposed use of Content-Language to target a  
&gt; specified translation of a resource rather than the use of Accept- 
&gt; Language which has language negotiation behaviour.

PUT replaces all representations of the identified resource with the
representation provided. PUT does not selectively replace the
representations that happen to match a given language header field.
Negotiated resources either disallow PUT or redirect to the
more appropriate (localized) resource that corresponds to the
language-specific variant.

In other words, resources don&#39;t have translations. Each resource has
a given meaning.  When that meaning includes content negotiation, remote
authoring has to be managed as a set of subsidiary/specific resources
that indirectly change the set of variant representations of the
negotiated resource.  Authoring whole sets through a single resource
is not supported by the protocol because it is more efficient to have
the server provide individual identifiers for the members of the
current set and also more likely that such identifiers will help
the author retain the sameness of the resource across edits.
