&gt; I see identity as the rock of vocabulary that allows unambigous

...
&gt; This set of definitions defines the resource concept in a different  
&gt; way
&gt; to REST, and I think forms a subset of theoretical REST that can form
&gt; the basis of discussion about which methods a particular architecture
&gt; should have. It lies somewhere between the real web and REST theory  
&gt; as a
&gt; practical bridge of good web style.

Perhaps you should consider what the purpose of these definitions
may be, and what it is you are trying to describe.

REST is a model of an idealized Web application that attempts to
maximize a particular set of properties that I consider to be
the &quot;most important properties&quot; of the Web as a whole.  Its purpose
is to guide architecture decisions in light of that model, so that
I can avoid breaking the important bits while developing the
architecture and so that developers can understand the
important bits when developing applications.

The problem with your model is that it doesn&#39;t respect reality.
By axiomatizing away the notion of resource equivalence you simplify
the model, but then your model is incapable of explaining the
information theoretic properties of the Web that I just finished
describing.  In your model, URI aliases are not an issue because
they don&#39;t exist.  In the REST model, URI aliases are an issue
because they reduce the perceived importance of a given resource
and reduce the efficiency of caching resource representations.

REST teaches the architect that reducing aliases will result in a
more efficient system, whereas your model just assumes such a
reduction is impossible.  Google search ranking and duplicate result
presentation emphasize the same characteristics as the REST model
because those are characteristics of the information space
as we know it (the Web).  And you say that your model is somewhere
between the &quot;real Web&quot; and REST theory?  Wrong.  The Web is a lot
more than the sum of client-server interaction.

So, the question then isn&#39;t how you might define resources.  The
question is what do you intend to accomplish by doing so?  There
are many ways to look at any given system, particularly when
focusing on only one of the components.  An abstraction like REST
is supposed to help the designer identify mismatches in the
architecture.  Perhaps you don&#39;t see the problem because you
aren&#39;t applying your model to the Web as a whole, but rather
something more limited (such as a server-side development
framework)?
