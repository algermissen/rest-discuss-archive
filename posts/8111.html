&gt; OK, but stating the obvious pragmatic issue: A major benefit of REST
&gt; is that things work with existing HTTP implementations - servers,
&gt; proxies, caches, client libraries. But if a REST application uses
&gt; methods other than those listed in HTTP/1.1, that will greatly reduce
&gt; the number of existing implementations that will be able to work with
&gt; that app.

Any implementation that doesn&#39;t support arbitrary HTTP methods
is not going to work in other, less obvious, ways as well.  It is
a lost cause to design systems around the lowest common denominator
implementation -- just report errors when they are found and use
a configurable workaround when necessary (and only when necessary).

The only reason that Web proxies suck is because Web browsers
are too stupid to report an error while working around them.
