&gt;&gt; I think that Roy refers to properties not being resources in the

&gt;
&gt; That&#39;s true, but applies to WebDAV in general, not RFC3253  
&gt; (Versioning) or RFC3744 (ACL). Introducing WebDAV properties as  
&gt; second-class citizens may have been a bad idea, but that happened  
&gt; long before.

Yes, but that is what the thread was about -- the gates were opened
and the negative effects are multiplied by each new extension
(as opposed to the resource only model, wherein the complexity
of each new extension is linear).
