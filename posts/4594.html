&gt; Because it requires a non-uniform expectation.  Roy&#39;s right that
&gt; declaring it with a mandatory extension would alleviate the problem of
&gt; resources processing the request when they shouldn&#39;t, but IMO the
&gt; request still needs to have uniform semantics in order to be RESTful.

We&#39;ve had this kind of discussion before, Mark.  You have invented
a constraint that does not exist in either the Web or my dissertation,
and are saying it defines RESTful.  Sorry, you simply cannot say that.
You can say that REST + Mark&#39;s constraint is a better design, but
you can&#39;t say that REST contains a restriction unless it actually
appeared in my dissertation (because REST is the name given to the
architectural style described there, not some general philosophy
of design that changes over time). Otherwise, you&#39;ll drive me insane.

The expectation in REST is defined by the user agent&#39;s current
application state, which comes from the current set of representations
that created that state (e.g., the current Web page), the type
of user agent being used, and the specific configuration for
that user.  Browsers know how to traverse Web pages because HTML
and URIs tell them how to do so.  Browsers will know how to
traverse super-duper-query resources because the representation type
that links to those resources, along with URIs, will presumably tell
them how to do so in the same way that &lt;img src=&quot;..&quot;&gt; tells them
how to process in-line images.

In any case, 201 with a Location header field is a generic response
that doesn&#39;t require any special expectation to process.  Retrieving
that URI using a GET will give the browser a representation of the
newly identified resource (it might even have multiple representations
that are negotiated via Accept).  Assuming that there isn&#39;t any special
metadata provided along with that resource, the only one who will
know that it represents the query results of the previous POST is
the user, which is fine because nobody else needs to know!
Everyone else just thinks of it as a new resource.

It is still REST because all of REST&#39;s constraints are being obeyed:
the application state remains on the browser, the messages are
self-descriptive and stateless, and the representations (eventually)
have standardized media types.  Using POST does have the drawback
that external caching is not possible for the initial query, but
such things are rarely cached right now anyway.  In any case,
lack of GET-based caching does not mean it is less RESTful --
it only means that it is less efficient.

REST is, first and foremost, a way to understand and communicate
the properties of the Web circa 1999 or so.  It could not do so
if it somehow excluded things like HTML forms and POST.
