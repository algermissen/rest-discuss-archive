&gt; 2. Use a parametrized URL, like:
&gt;
&gt;   GET /getNewNotifications?since=UID
&gt;
&gt; where UID is the unique identifier of the last
&gt; message retrieved, but this seems unRESTful in
&gt; that this URL is not really opaque (In the
&gt; Wiki Jeff Bone appears to argue that this is ok,
&gt; so I am not really sure, but to me it feels
&gt; unRESTful)

It is not unRESTful.  Every resource should have a URI.  That is a
resource, even if it is ephemeral in content.

&gt; 3. Use a single range headers against a single
&gt; mailbox URL, but that prohibits you from changing
&gt; the representation of the underlying mailbox.  If
&gt; we want the server periodically to check
&gt; availability of actual messages and update on that
&gt; basis, we can&#39;t use range headers.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Use multipart-byteranges.
&gt; I think this is the best option, but a. most
&gt; clients don&#39;t suppport it and b. it verges on
&gt; specification abuse.

It also ties the client and server implementations together,
which is definitely contrary to REST.

&gt; A much more useful way to go would be for the HTTP
&gt; authors not to have used bytes as the only units
&gt; for range headers.  If HTTP allowed range headers
&gt; to be specified in application units e.g. records,
&gt; then this would all be very easy.  Unfortunately,
&gt; they didn&#39;t and we have HTTP as it currently
&gt; stands.

Sorry, but you are wrong on both accounts. Read section 3.12
of RFC 2616.  In any case, a range request is not an appropriate
solution to this problem because it ties the client and server
implementations together.  If you don&#39;t care about that, then
just use rsync as your protocol.  It is more efficient.
