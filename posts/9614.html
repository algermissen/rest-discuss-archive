Er, I thought that Mark convinced them to fix that a long time ago=

&gt; Darned if I can figure out how to make an electric fen=

I would have described the bit where one of the kid=

to demonstrate by example, assuming that I just didn&#39;t understa=

what they were talking about.  Of course, he missed.  [Yes,
that analogy=
 really did occur in real life, when I was 12 and
living for a month in a s=

where the kids were just as m=

small town.  Fortunately, we were the f=

they had met who could actually play soccer, after =
6 years in AYSO,
so we got along just fine.]
