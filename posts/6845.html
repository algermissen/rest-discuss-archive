No, that isn&#39;t being pedantic -- it is being superficial.

What do you think abstractions are for?  When your parents told
you that the leaves of a given tree are &quot;green&quot;, did you have a
hissy fit over colors?  Did you grab a leaf and demand that everyone
consider it to be the one true &quot;green&quot;?  Did you declare it heresy
when the grass was also called green?  Did you complain when the
crayon package came with various shades of &quot;green&quot;?  Were you the
kid who stuck all the green crayons in his pocket, so that only
he could be the one true creator of the green fuzz-balls that made
brown rectangles look like trees?  No?

Then why is it so hard to accept that an ARCHITECTURAL STYLE
cannot itself be implemented, just as there is no implementation
of green (only examples)?  And that not being implementable in its
style form does not mean that an architecture cannot be constructed
in such a way as to fit our agreed style?  And that being abstract
doesn&#39;t mean it is worthless to be able to talk about the style,
examine its characteristics, debate which ones are &quot;best&quot; for a
given application, and generally enjoy learning something that you
might not have known last week?

We can talk about green, various shades of green, and all the
other colors that, when combined, do not come out green.  Children
have no problem understanding such things, though they might not
yet understand the properties of light and vision that make it all
work.  Software architectural styles are much more complex, which
means you need to spend a lot more time thinking about the subject
(and drawing experiments) before it finally becomes clear.  And
at that point you won&#39;t be complaining about abstractions: you&#39;ll
start looking for other colors.
