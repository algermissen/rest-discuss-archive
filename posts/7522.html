Toss it... you should be looking at

  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt


&gt; Basically in the path portion of a URI you can have a set of params  
&gt; at the end of a segment, each prepended by a ; char. And it is OK  
&gt; to have a ; char at the end. So these would be valid:

&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles;p5
&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles
&gt;
&gt; And also:

&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had any troubles in practice using URIs with params in  
&gt; their segments?

Not that I know of.

&gt; Are people moving towards this approach rather than query  
&gt; parameters with their ?, &, and = chars?

A few, but only when they are not using HTML forms to create the query.
The vast majority just copy whatever they read in &quot;CGI for Dummies&quot;.
The only real difference is that some app frameworks will pre-parse
the ?key=value args for you, so it is simpler to implement.

It used to be that browsers and Squid would not cache any response
containing a query segment, but that may have changed by now.
