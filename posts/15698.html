Insanity is a relati=

services, so they tend to provide=
 sane responses to sane requests,
but they will also lie to a client that t=

(such as a DoS attacker or misbehaving robot).  I didn&#39;=
t say
that the server will return any status code -- I just said that
the c=
lient needs to handle any status code.

The problem with providing a specif=
ic list of status codes to
give is that there are many orthogonal errors th=
at might be
indicated (e.g., 401) and the set of status codes itself is
ext=
ensible.  Besides, it just leads to poor assumptions on
the part of clients=
.
