&gt; i&#39;m having a hard time understanding your explanation. can you  
&gt; please post two examples, one &quot;RPC plus streaming&quot;, the other true  
&gt; REST?

RPC is remote procedure call.  One of the things that typical RPC
mechanisms lack is the ability to describe responses (or even
parameters) as a stream of data as opposed to a small data type.
HTTP has no problem doing that even when it is used in an RPC way.

So, people who advocate &quot;resource-oriented&quot; as an end in itself,
as if the only thing you need to build a network-based application
is a URI template and resource definition language, are just fooling
themselves into thinking what they are doing is REST.  Resources
are just one part of the style.  Resources are necessary for REST,
but resources must be allowed to evolve independently from the
clients and the only way that can happen is when the clients are
expecting to be instructed by the next representation received.
Otherwise, the client is making assumptions about the server&#39;s
implementation --- assumptions that will break eventually --- and
becomes much more complex and brittle than the type of network-based
application that REST is intended to encourage.

That is why hypermedia as the engine of application state is
an essential constraint of REST, and why RESTful application
frameworks cannot ignore the need for meaningful media types,
whether it be in the form of microformats or specialized XML
data types.
