&gt; I think the general question here is what are the
&gt; standard ReST semantics for container.  It feels
&gt; like we loop through this periodically on this
&gt; list but never resolve it generically.  Here are
&gt; the questions that should be in the FAQ (I don&#39;t
&gt; know the answers).

Well, for one, it is REST -- not ReST.  I like uniformity in some
things.

&gt; 1. How do you create a container?
&gt;   Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?
&gt;   Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,
&gt;    a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?

Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,
as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav
implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to
a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes
such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.

REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the
method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources
(even if some may not allow it).

&gt; 2. How do we add things to the container?
&gt;   Do we rely on directory structure and just do
&gt;    a PUT /collection/item?

If you know that item os the name you want, yes.

&gt;   Do we POST /collection and get back a 201 CREATED?

If you don&#39;t know what the name should be, yes.

&gt; 3. How do we specify the order of items in a collection?
&gt;   If we do this by POSTing to the collection, how
&gt;   do we disambiguate between an add-to-collection
&gt;   POST and an &quot;order-by&quot; POST.

Order is a property of the collection representation.

&gt; 4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?
&gt;   My answer: DELETE /container

That is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.
The server might tell you to delete the children first.

&gt; 5. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and not
&gt;   its contents?
&gt;   My answer: Make it a container of links (see #4)

Move the contents first.

&gt; 6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?
&gt;   My answer: Either iterate through the contents
&gt;   and DELETE individually or DELETE the container
&gt;   and then create it again but then see #1

If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other
links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,
then you should not delete the container unless you want all of
those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.

BTW, why do you switch from &quot;collection&quot; to &quot;container&quot;?
