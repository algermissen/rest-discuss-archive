&gt; If you don&#39;t write it to the disk and make it available, then its an
&gt; error code in the 400 range.
&gt;
&gt; HTTP doesn&#39;t care about XML level errors. However it doesn&#39;t say you
&gt; have to accept bad XML either. The choice is with your app. HTTP never
&gt; obligates you to accept a PUT request. All it requires is that you
&gt; return the right response code to indicate what you did. The choice of
&gt; what to do is up to you.

One of these days I&#39;ll find the time to write an I-D that
describes the 418 status code we discussed on March 24.
