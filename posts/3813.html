&gt; MoST is either ReST with additional constraints to achieve much greater
&gt; levels of visibility or MoST supercedes ReST because ReST is useful 
&gt; only
&gt; for web publishing and we want more.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#39;t have a huge stake in defining ReST one way or another.  My 
&gt; personal
&gt; view is that ReST is sufficiently semantically incoherent so you can 
&gt; go in
&gt; whatever direction you like.  Try reading Roy&#39;s dissertation and 
&gt; figuring
&gt; out the exact meaning of resource and representation in his paper and
&gt; you&#39;ll see what I mean.

Well, now that&#39;s a completely clueless statement.  The point of the
definitions is that the interface does not define the exact meaning,
leaving meaning to be defined by the nature of the links between
the information.  A server does the interpolation between the contents
of a PUT and the model hidden behind the server -- saying that isn&#39;t
defined by REST is just goofy.  I have no problems building PUT,
containers, or any of the other things that you claim are not defined
by REST, since those are implementation details that are defined within
HTTP by the origin server and not by the client.  I don&#39;t even need to
use webdav, though it has its definitions as well.  The only problems
I run into are buggy browsers that never managed to implement basic
HTTP correctly, let alone the advanced features.

If you don&#39;t like the generic interface, then just implement a
distributed file system.  That has all the features you are looking
for in a concrete model.
