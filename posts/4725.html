Josh, while that may be your theory (and you are welcome to it), the
notion that there are two levels of REST is completely false.  There
are different extents to which a REST-based application will use HTTP
methods, but that doesn&#39;t mean the architectural style has two different
sets of constraints.  The application is either obeying the REST
constraints or it is not, and POST in particular has the meaning
&quot;process this&quot; regardless of how REST-compliant it may be because
REST does not define the meaning of POST (HTTP does).
