&gt; I thought Josh&#39;s explanation made sense.  Analyzing the URL moves

&gt; Fielding didn&#39;t really care to integrate so much.

No, it is just that people are different from machines,
servers are different from clients, and TimBL used the word
&quot;Axiom&quot; to mean architectural constraint.  In order to understand
TimBL&#39;s design notes, you have to know about the context in which
he is writing a response.  In this case, various thoughts were
recorded as the &quot;Opacity Axiom&quot; in response to a discussion about
client behavior and the perceived need for URNs.  It has long
since been taken out of context and abused in various ways.

Also, keep in mind that TimBL&#39;s design note was written two
years after Henrik and I worked out the important bits of what
would become the HTTP object model, later re-named REST to get
away from OOM terms, about 18 months after we had similar
discussions at MIT with TimBL and the rest of the W3C team, and
more than a year after HTTP/1.0 was finished and HTTP/1.1 proposed.
So, saying it was something that I &quot;didn&#39;t really care to
integrate so much&quot; is missing the mark by quite a bit -- he is
trying to describe our model to people who did not understand it.

The opacity principle, as actually used on the Web, refers only
to the machine interpretation of request processing as being
dependent on control data (e.g., hypertext anchors and message
field names) rather than on metadata appearing within the URI.
It is the same reason why we distinguish media types from data
formats -- the fact that a string of bytes looks like angle tags
doesn&#39;t mean we want to process it as HTML.  Ignoring any
semantically significant data in a URI allows operations on a
resource to be orthogonal to identification of the resource.

REST does include the opacity axiom in the original sense of
that phrase.  I did not use it by name in REST because it isn&#39;t
a principle at all -- opacity is just a name TimBL used for the
set of constraints around URI processing by clients (a byproduct
of the constraints that you will find in REST).  The principle
involved is orthogonal design.

&quot;Opacity of URI&quot; only applies to clients and, even then, only to
those parts of the URI that are not defined by relevant standards.
Origin servers, for example, have the choice of interpreting a
URI as being opaque or as a structure that defines how the server
maps the URI to a representation of the resource.  Cool URIs will
often make a transition from being originally interpreted as
structure by the server and then later treated as an opaque
string (perhaps because the server implementation has changed
and the owner wants the old URI to persist).  The server can make
that transition because clients are required to act like they
are ignorant of the server-private structure.

Clients are allowed to treat a URI as being structured
if that structure is defined by standard (e.g., scheme and
authority in &quot;http&quot;) or if the server tells the client how its
URI is structured.  For example, both GET-based FORM actions and
server-side image map processing compose the URI from a
server-provided base and a user-supplied suffix constructed
according to an algorithm defined by a standard media type.

Note, however, that some people have taken the mere title of
&quot;opacity&quot; and assumed that it meant URIs should not have
meaningful construction at all.  TimBL&#39;s axiom doesn&#39;t say
that and neither does REST.
