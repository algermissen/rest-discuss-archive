&gt;&gt;&gt; REST doesn&#39;t mandate the use of XML for the content of request and

&gt;&gt;&gt; messages.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not by a long shot.  I&#39;d expect that HTML is far and away the most
&gt;&gt; popular format.  RSS is probably the most popular XML based format,
&gt;&gt; but way behind HTML.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I should clarify that I&#39;m looking at REST from the standpoint of 
&gt; being
&gt; an alternative to SOAP, not as a way of constructing a web app. In that
&gt; setting it seems much more desirable for a REST service to return XML 
&gt; than
&gt; HTML, correct?

It depends on the consuming application.  In any case, REST is an
architectural style and SOAP is a protocol, so you can build REST-based
applications using SOAP.  You will have to be more specific, such as
REST-based HTTP applications versus RPC-based SOAP applications.

&gt; I assumed that using REST as an alternative to SOAP was the most 
&gt; common use
&gt; of REST. Is that wrong?

Completely wrong -- hypertext browsing on the Web is the most common
use of REST-based applications.  The only reason that SOAP even enters
the discussion is because some people tried to fix the major problems
with SOAP that caused its resources to be unusable on the Web, and
when they did so they used REST as the basis of their arguments.
