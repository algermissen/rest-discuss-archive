&gt; My one uncertainty is on the
&gt; utility of entry points that only redirect, because I&#39;m not sure how
&gt; many people will ever go there. Since everyone who goes there gets
&gt; redirected elsewhere, they will probably link to one of the target
&gt; pages, not the entry point.

That&#39;s why there exists a link relation called bookmark.
Too bad nobody implemented it.

&gt; So far I&#39;ve been thinking of having a
&gt; default form of the content at what you might otherwise use as the
&gt; entry point, and then include on that page a menu of links to the
&gt; other forms.

Note that blogs also use &quot;permalink&quot; links to tell the user
which link should be used for bookmarks or external links.
