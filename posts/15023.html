&gt; I have a customer who raised a concern about REST &quot;type safety&quot;. What he=
 means may be best explained by a simple example.
&gt; 
&gt; Assume we have a res=
ource that represents a folder, and by issueing a POST request, I can attac=
h a file. What, however, if that post request wrongly goes to, let&#39;s say, a=
nother document resource instead of our folder, and the document resource a=
lso accepts POST (for some reason)?
&gt; 
&gt; In a RPC world, the document type =
would not understand an &quot;addDocument()&quot; call, and consequently return an ex=
ception. But what about REST? Of course, the POST&#39;s attributes most likely =
wouldn&#39;t be understood and something like 400 Bad Request returned. But wha=
t if they were understood?

Ah, yes, a similar thing happens all the time w=
hen
flaying frisbee in the park with my dog.  When I throw
the frisbee and =
the dog tries to catch it in his teeth,
everyone seems to be happy.  Howeve=
r, when the dog tries
to throw the frisbee and I try to catch it in my teet=
h,
it just doesn&#39;t seem to work well for either of us.

&gt; So, are there mea=
ns or patterns, to achieve (some sort) of type safety?

Yes.  A RESTful int=
erface is one where the server provides the links
or forms that tells the c=
lient what operations to perform where.
If you are telling the client to do=
 the wrong thing, then the
pattern would be to tell the client to do the ri=
ght thing instead.
Generally speaking, it works out better that way.
