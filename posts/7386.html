&gt; &gt; Maintaining multiple URIs for the same resource is not

&gt; &gt; equivalent URIs to the preferred one. Althought that&#39;s not
&gt; &gt; quite what you are asking, I think it is the answer.

&gt; I&#39;m curious why you make the above statement. Is there a W3C  
&gt; finding that documents this, or some other paper? I&#39;ve been doing a  
&gt; significant amount of research on URLs and URI best practices in  
&gt; the past 3+ months and have found nothing like this (though I could  
&gt; have missed it.)

It is inherent in the power laws of economics, the network effect
of Metcalfe, the PageRank of Google, and I am sure it is mentioned
somewhere in webarch.  A gave a presentation to the W3C Tech Plenary
that described it using a single graph that is bisected when other
sites start referring to two separate URIs for the same resource.

When the best resources on the Web are identified by the sites
that link to them, introducing multiple URIs for the same resource
has the effect of exponentially decreasing its perceived value.

It also decreases cache efficiency, but resource owners don&#39;t
respect that as much as the PageRank argument.
