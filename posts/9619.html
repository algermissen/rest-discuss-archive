&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but *I&#39;m* chiefly complaining about

&gt; &gt; Er, I thought that Mark convinced them to fix that a long time ago.
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not up to date with the latest HTML discussions. Maybe I should
&gt; &gt; get back in the fray.

&gt; I&#39;m not sure exactly what is happening. Support for PUT and DELETE was
&gt; part of the original WHATWG document:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2004-06-27-call-for-comments/ 
&gt; #methodAndEnctypes
&gt;
&gt; but the current working draft is devoid of content:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#forms

Yeah, that surprised me last night when I went and looked.  It was
annoying enough for me to submit the invited expert form, just to
try and figure out what is going on at the W3C this time.

And that new &quot;ping&quot; feature is the most vulnerable idea I&#39;ve seen
in years.  WTF?
