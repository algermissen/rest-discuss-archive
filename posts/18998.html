&gt; Right. That was always in the back of my mind too, though as=

Well, that would only argue for a signature being exchanged =
instead
of an etag (or just put the signature in the etag).  IOW, it doesn&#39;=
t
resolve the theoretical question.

&gt;&gt; This reason may not have been Roy&#39;s=
 reason for including self-descriptive messages as a REST constraint, but i=
t would be important in business contract situations.
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t remember=
 when or where, but I recall Roy talking about how
&gt; HTML documents needed =
their stylesheets and images in order to fully
&gt; reflect the intent of the =
publisher in a legal context. Not sure if
&gt; that was based on conjecture or=
 actual case law though.

Conjecture ... fidelity of reproduction is the es=
sential element for
legal documents, which is why certain forms of TIFF and=
 PDF are
officially recognized standards for archival forms.  However, peop=
le
in lawsuits present HTML all the time -- they just have to provide
it in=
 both rendered and plain text forms, and then call some witness
to establis=
h that the HTML would have matched the printed format
when rendered by a ty=
pical browser at the time.


No, I am not going to &quot;settle&quot; the philosophic=
al question with an
authoritative answer.  I wouldn&#39;t learn anything if I d=
id.

I suggest folks worry less about that constraint (of visibility during=

a POST, which we already know isn&#39;t visible by nature) and more about
what=
 properties are lost by representation-by-reference.  Most of the
value cas=
es for REST apply to repeatable responses, not an application
that can&#39;t be=
 reused, can&#39;t be transformed, and can&#39;t be shared.
I do not believe in try=
ing to apply all of REST&#39;s constraints unless
there is a reason for doing s=
o (aside from buzzword compatibility).

My guess is that coupling would be =
more of a hazard than loss of
visibility, but maybe even that wouldn&#39;t matt=
er if the application is
entirely driven via hypertext.  It is really hard =
to get excited
about the finer points of API design when the chosen method =
already
says &quot;do whatever you like with this&quot;.
