&gt; If (i) means &quot;organizing its URI space in a stable manner&quot;, ie so

Why would navigating imply transient URIs?

There are times when the best RESTful design will conflict
with UI guidelines (split-page processing) or browser limitations.
The goal here is not to run away screaming whenever something
doesn&#39;t match the ideal -- it is to recognize there is a
problem and find a way to compensate for it (e.g., by changing
the mode of interaction, using better clients, introducing
code to compress multiform steps into a single network
interaction, or just buying bigger machines).

Minimizing dependencies does not mean that one cannot
have a rich and well-defined URI space.  Such dependencies
can be programmatically adjusted as whole trees of resources
just as easily as any single resource.  However, that doesn&#39;t
mean that REST implies one particular design of URI space
is somehow &quot;more RESTful&quot; than some other design, which
was the original point being argued.  Aside from the legacy
cache issues, any given organized structure is just as
good as any other organized structure, and both are better
than a disorganized structure. That&#39;s what we mean by
&quot;it just doesn&#39;t matter to REST how you design your URIs.&quot;

IIRC, the complaint was about APIs that have a standard
URI structure.  The problem with that is not the structure,
but rather the way that the structure is communicated to
clients (by antiquated agreement rather than by following
your nose).  The follow-your-nose style has the built-in
capacity for indirection and redirection at the time
of the current interaction, whereas standard layouts
encourage the client to bake-in assumptions that will
inevitably break.

That does not mean it isn&#39;t RESTful to have permanent URIs.
REST is still dependent on at least one starting URI, and
thus it is always going to be better for the URIs to be
permanent.  It just isn&#39;t necessary to structure the
application around such permanence.

Bookmarks are resource identifiers from a prior interaction.
They are bread-crumbs. Sometimes they get eaten.

REST doesn&#39;t enter into the discussion until one of the
URIs is actively traversed and the application enters one of
its initial states.  After that point the user agent is led
by the nose through the application.  If the application is
designed correctly, then the only times that the user agent
will pause long enough to make a bookmark will be at one of
the application steady states, which should correspond to one
of the cool URIs.  In other words, a RESTful architecture will
expose the cool URIs (and only the cool URIs) to the user.

REST cannot remove all the points of coupling.  It can reduce
those points of coupling to the set of URIs that an organization
is willing to maintain over time for bookmarks (cool URIs).
How many of those you have is entirely up to the organization.
It is certainly possible for all of the URIs to be maintained.
