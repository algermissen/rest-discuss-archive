&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that mean that session cookies are okay, as long as I use

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes and no.
&gt;
&gt; That means &quot;no,&quot; right? ;-)

I meant that, if the session is defined as an aspect of the resource
that is being acted upon (the effect of placing it in the URI instead
of in the cookie header fields), then it does not violate the
stateless constraint.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean it is &quot;okay&quot;, because
doing so makes the URI worthless for later reference (infinite URIs
due to session id being in the URI).  The set of URIs can be reduced
to a more natural, finite set by inserting the user id instead.
Better yet, when possible, avoid placing temporary state on the
server and thus keep the URI free of any user state information.
That is easy to do for new architectures -- much harder when dealing
with legacy browsers.

In any case, the problem with cookies in the header is *not* that
they violate statelessness, but rather that they violate visibility
(because nobody knows why they are there) and reliability (because
they are associated with the site rather than the current state of
the user&#39;s interface).  A message containing cookie headers is still
stateless, assuming that the cookie isn&#39;t specified relative to
some prior state (which would be very weird).

&gt; But a serious question.  You say:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; They [session cookies w/ URI syntax session keys and persisted state] 
&gt;&gt; satisfy the stateless constraint, but they lose by
&gt;&gt; creating an infinite resource space.
&gt;
&gt; Not challenging the assertion at all, but looking for a bit more 
&gt; clarity in the abstract.  Sounds like there might be one of those 
&gt; mind-blowing gestalts lurking here.  I&#39;d really like to understand:
&gt;
&gt; (1)  What you mean by an infinite resource space...
&gt; (2)  How it is that (session) cookies create an infinite resource 
&gt; space...

I meant session cookies placed within the URI.

&gt; (3)  Why an infinite resource space is a bad thing...

At any instant in time, the web consists of a space of nodes defined
by all referenced resources (resources with defined URI).  If some part
of the URI corresponds to a random id, then that space is effectively
infinite and short-lived, which in turn means that people can&#39;t share
those resources even when they are equivalent.

Metcalfe&#39;s Law refers to the value of a network of connected nodes.
When two or more URI exist for the same resource, that resource&#39;s
connected neighbors are partitioned among them.  In effect, the
Web reaches a point of disjunction rather than conjunction, which
affects the value of the neighbor relations.  Hmmm, just a minute...
googling...I knew there would be a theory somewhere:

    &lt;http://powerlaws.media.mit.edu/&gt;

That looks like a valuable resource.

&gt; PS - Roy, since you went to all the trouble to get gbiv.com, why do 
&gt; you go by fielding@... when clearly roy@gbiv is the intended and 
&gt; admirably-groanable pun? :-)

Because, when I tried that, I quickly found out that some portion of
the Internet has been using that address in the same way as Mickey Mouse
for those marketing sites that demand a non-verified e-mail address.
So much for my grand plan to reduce typing by grabbing a four-letter
domain.  I decided it would be better to reject that address, at least
for a few more years.  The pun still works for my personal home page.

Actually, it isn&#39;t a pun -- G. Biv is my basketball nickname from
the dorms at UCI.
