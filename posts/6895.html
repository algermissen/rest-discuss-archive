&gt; Your analogy for &quot;green&quot; leaves is not applicable because I wasn&#39;t  
&gt; asking
&gt; for the &quot;one true REST,&quot; I was asking for an *implementable* REST;  
&gt; one that
&gt; could gain wide usage so as to see tools developed for it and a  
&gt; body of
&gt; practical knowledge around its use. In the case of leaves, there are
&gt; billions of &quot;implementations&quot; and also no need to get trees to &quot;adopt&quot;
&gt; producing them.

No, you just don&#39;t understand the terminology yet.  You asked a bunch
of gardeners for help implementing green, or at least an easy-to-read
guide on doing so.  If you want an implementation guide for leaves,
that is a different story.

If you want to know how to implement an HTTP and URI-based service
in accordance with REST, then you should search for web architecture
and things like Apache modular design.  There are plenty of opinions
out there.  Most of the &quot;simple guides&quot; are just plain wrong, but
that&#39;s because they take the &quot;shortest path for the programmer is best&quot;
mentality of software engineering.  Hence, CGI, servlets, etc.
Great for prototypes, lousy in real (scalable) practice.

Yes, those guides could be improved -- the W3C webarch document,
for example, has a number of good ideas sprinkled around a tangled
discourse of a committee&#39;s long-term agenda.  That document could
benefit from a clean sweep driven by a single editorial viewpoint.

&gt; It&#39;s as if TBL had sat around and talked about URIs, HTML, and HTTP  
&gt; but
&gt; whenever anyone asked him how to implement it he did his best to  
&gt; make them
&gt; feel as if they were beneath him for asking. Instead TBL helped them
&gt; implement in a standard way so that it would be as universally  
&gt; compatible as
&gt; possible. Clearly many people before and since have used  
&gt; condescension to
&gt; discuss their ideas but I dare say nobody else in history has seen  
&gt; the level
&gt; of success TLB saw based on their ideas, at least not as rapidly. I  
&gt; see
&gt; people on this list lament how the industry has taken to SOAP and  
&gt; not REST
&gt; and the backhanded jabs at those who use SOAP, but it&#39;s becoming  
&gt; pretty
&gt; clear to me at least one good reason why REST has remained still- 
&gt; borne and
&gt; SOAP has reined supreme.

Huh?  Please, find a clue.  TBL stopped implementing URI, HTML, and
HTTP back in 1993.  Yes, 1993.  Since then he has spent an enormous
amount of time creating an organization that can, essentially, talk
about them, with the hopes of doing something more in the form of
the semantic web at some point in the future.

But perhaps you are right -- maybe I should have shown people how to
create an architecture based on REST, instead of just talking about it.
Usually, creating a network-based architecture means protocol design,
like in RFCs 1808, 1866, 1945, 2068, 2145, 2396, 2616, and 3986.
Maybe I should have written an extensible client library that could
show people how to manipulate the Web programmatically without assuming
a human is at the wheel; like, maybe, libwww-perl and MOMspider.
Maybe I should have spent more time teaching people how to build
service frameworks for scalable (real) Web sites, like Apache httpd.

Maybe I did, and you still have no clue what you are talking about.
REST is still-born?  Get a life.  You haven&#39;t even figured out what
the Web is yet and you want to lecture me on teaching.

Nobody on this list laments about SOAP.  SOAP was known to be a bad
idea in 1999 and, in spite of our comments to that effect, the industry
still insisted on proving that for themselves.  That was expected
given the money behind SOAP and is still an ongoing process, but we
don&#39;t need to lament it because this list is for discussing REST.

&gt; Tell you what; my venting isn&#39;t going to change your or anyone else&#39;s
&gt; approach on this list. I&#39;ll still participate to try and learn  
&gt; more, but I
&gt; give up on trying to inject any practicality into the discussions.

All you have injected so far is whining.  If you want a different
approach, first figure out what people are talking about and then
try a new approach yourself.  I don&#39;t understand why you are venting,
because everything we have done so far has succeeded pretty well.
REST is catching on just fine, without a dime spent on marketing.
I don&#39;t measure success by the number of people who attend training
courses because their boss told them to.  If you want to measure
success that way, then that&#39;s your problem.
