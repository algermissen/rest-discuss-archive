&gt; Hiya all,

&gt; I&#39;ve taken a back-seat this time, luckily due to too much stuff going
&gt; on in the real world. My two bobs worth, and I&#39;ll just start with this

&gt; We all have our definitions (in our heads, at best) of what thing is
&gt; called what and what that part of technology is categorised under. The
&gt; thing is, it&#39;s all really philosophically interchangeable in the end
&gt; (for a good example of what I&#39;m talking about, see &quot;Everything is
&gt; miscellaneous&quot;; google it). I know we&#39;re all hardcore engineers here
&gt; and all, but if we take a step back and examine what we&#39;re doing here
&gt; in human terms, what the heck is all this bickering about?
&gt;

Yes, we are all a cloud of atoms -- what&#39;s the point of distinguishing
us into types, shapes, or names?

&gt; I find this (&quot;HTTP is a application protocol NOT a middleware
&gt; protocol&quot;) a bit of a strange assertion. First of all, the notion of
&gt; middleware is to glue software components and / or systems together,
&gt; and as such an application protocol *is* a middleware protocol. Are we
&gt; here just battling over semantics that actually are superfluous in
&gt; nature? Aren&#39;t we trying to say that RESTful design removes much of
&gt; the need for *traditional* middleware whos sole purpose is to glue
&gt; applications together through structures simulating OO (which REST
&gt; does for you in better ways through resources [mining from
&gt; identification management]), so why are you recreating the middleware
&gt; problem through something that already solves much of it? This
&gt; misguidance will of course be misinterpreted as commercial bias.
&gt;

No, that&#39;s not what middleware means (it certainly isn&#39;t tied to OO).
There is a lot of good middleware and a lot of good distributed
architectures that use various types of middleware for communication
according to various good architectural styles.  There is plenty of
middleware active in the Web as well, like content distribution  
networks,
name resolvers, load balancers, etc.  Middleware are implementation
packages that may or may not fit a given architecture, and should be
used only when and where the fit is right.  Likewise, there are
plenty of good RESTful architectures that end at the resource
interface, behind which is another architecture composed of
middleware services that are not (and should not be) RESTful.

&gt; People whinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias. Um, computer
&gt; scientists have a bias too, even people who have no bias have a basic
&gt; philosophical bias, and these semantics *will* affect (as oppose to
&gt; mere observatory notions) the work that is done. The argument of bias
&gt; is mostly moot (but not completely, of course). I personally get the
&gt; feeling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only
&gt; business bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went
&gt; with it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and
&gt; as such I *really* welcome it.
&gt;

Would you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked to see a
new Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?

Would you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a
filet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?

WTF is wrong with you people?

Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set
themselves up as the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards
organization on a topic for which they not only had NOTHING to
do with creating and know NOTHING about, but for which they
actually sell products that are the exact opposite of RESTful
architecture.  The organization claims that it will specify REST
standards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dictators
in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals would be
allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL),
and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the board
to ensure that never changed.

And, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Leads
owning the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because
they know damn well that their current market is shrinking: their
entire product architecture is based on J2EE, the giant black
hole of Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.

But, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that
is found in my dissertation.  This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,
AssHat version of REST, so that JBoss can tell their customers
that they are the new leaders in &quot;REST&quot; architecture and all
they need to do get their systems to be RESTful 2.0-compliant
is to buy their J2EE application server, now with REST-beans.

Bill Burke is not evangelizing REST throughout the Java world.
What he is evangelizing is the same old architectures that he
evangelized as J2EE and WS-* -- the only difference is that now
he starts off calling them REST.  All he is doing is making
people like you confused over what is REST and what is not, in
the hope of making a business out of clambering onto yet
another buzzword.

No, I see no reason to appreciate that nonsense.  Not in the least.
I don&#39;t care if it was an &quot;honest mistake&quot; or a deliberate attempt
at fraud -- the result is the same.  Only a complete idiot would
participate in such a forum.

If you want a place to collect REST ideas and patterns, then
use the wiki that Mark Baker established.  He actually knows
what he is talking about, doesn&#39;t pretend to be a dictator, and
actually earned the role of editor long before most of you had
even heard of the term.
