Not MOMspider -- it was a discussion on the robots list in 1996:

&lt;http://webdoc.gwdg.de/ebook/aw/1999/webcrawler/mailing-lists/robots/ 
0964.html&gt;
&lt;http://webdoc.gwdg.de/ebook/aw/1999/webcrawler/mailing-lists/robots/ 
1014.html&gt;
&lt;http://webdoc.gwdg.de/ebook/aw/1999/webcrawler/mailing-lists/robots/ 
1015.html&gt;

IIRC, the system was written by Rob Hartill when he was a post-doc
at LANL.  I don&#39;t think he ever accepted that it was a bad design,
no matter how many times I reinforced the standard on GET = safe.
