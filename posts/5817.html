&gt;&gt;&gt; Why not. I=

&gt;&gt; 10.4.1 400 Bad=
 Request
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The request could not be understood by the server due to mal=

&gt;&gt; mod=
ifications.
&gt;&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 418 Invalid
&gt;
&gt; The request could not be comple=
ted due to a validation failing against
&gt; the sent entity. This code is onl=
y allowed in situations where it is
&gt; expected that the user might be able =
to resubmit the request with  
&gt; valid
&gt; content and where the sent content=
 was syntactically correct according
&gt; to its media type. The response body=
 SHOULD include enough information
&gt; for the user to recognize the source o=
f the conflict. Invalidations  
&gt; are
&gt; most likely to occur in response to=
 a PUT or POST request.

Yep, that&#39;s what I would do, though a properly spe=
cified response code
would never include that second sentence &quot;This code is=
 only allowed ...&quot;
since servers are always right (and never omnipotent).  =
And the last
sentence is kind of goofy -- request payload is unlikely to be=

invalid when it isn&#39;t present.

Do you want me to standardize it?

Of cour=
se, it would help if browsers would implement HTTP, eventually,
and treat t=
he code as a 400 if not understand.
