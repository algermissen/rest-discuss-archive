&gt; Thank you very much for the clarification.

&gt; If I understand correctly, the single bookmark constraint means  
&gt; that any initial access to the REST system must allow  
&gt; discoverability to every accessible part of the system through some  
&gt; degree of linkage sepration.  There is some path from every point A  
&gt; to point B and back again.  There&#39;s some way to discover the entire  
&gt; system using any entry point.

No.  This is an application of computers to do something useful,
not a math problem or a reachability analysis.  Any given client
might only be able to reach 1% of a system and still be successful
at doing what they wanted to do.  The simplest example of that is
a system using authentication and role-based access control.

In any case, this line of thought is missing the point of REST.
If the application state is entirely defined by the client&#39;s
workspace (set of representations) and all possible transitions
away from that state are presented in those representations,
then the potential size of the overall system is irrelevant.
Each state can be considered independently.  That is fundamental
to the use of state machines to simplify the understanding of
complex systems.

The client only needs to know what it has in that workspace,
at that time, and so any pre-definition of URI layout or
WSDL-like service semantics is an absolute waste of time as
far as a RESTful architecture is concerned.  External artifacts
might help the developers communicate about or improve the design
of their system, just as readable URIs will help a human user
understand where they are in a hypertext user-interface, but
those external artifacts must not have a role in the runtime
architecture if the system is truly hypertext-driven.
