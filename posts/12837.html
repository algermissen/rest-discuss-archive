If you find yourself in need of a distributed transaction
protocol, then how can you possibly say that your architecture
is based on REST?  I simply cannot see how you can get from one
situation (of using RESTful application state on the client and
hypermedia to determine all state transitions) to the next
situation of needing distributed agreement of transaction semantics
wherein the client has to tell the server how to manage its own
resources.

Most likely, the system you are thinking of is just doing
CRUD operations on multiple servers.  Each of those actions
might be based on a RESTful architecture.  When all of them
are done and the client makes a final request to approve or
cancel the changes, it might be interacting with a TM-style
manager resource that tells all of the other services to commit
the associated changes to a more persistent or public set of
resources, just like a staging server might be used to prepare
content prior to publication.   The sum of all those actions
might be equivalent to an ACID transaction.

None of that matters to the REST client.  As far as the client is
concerned, it is only interacting with one resource at a time
even when those interactions overlap asynchronously. There is
no &quot;transaction protocol&quot; aside from whatever agreement mechanism
is implemented in the back-end in accordance with the resource
semantics (in a separate architecture that we don&#39;t care about
here).  There is no commit protocol other than the presentation
of various options to the client at any given point in the
application.  There is no need for client-side agreement with
the transaction protocol because the client is only capable of
choosing from the choices provided by the server.

If I am missing something, please let me know, but for now
I consider &quot;rest transaction&quot; to be an oxymoron.
