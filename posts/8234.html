&gt; &gt; REST is an architectural style.

&gt; If you follow where the notion of a &quot;style&quot; comes from (the arts),  
&gt; then
&gt; hi and lo analogy would refer to periods of use, not levels of use.
&gt; Levels are what Don was referring to.
&gt;
&gt; For example, when the industry gets their hands on REST, that will be
&gt; the beginning of the end of hi rest and the start of the beginning of
&gt; mannerist REST.
&gt;
&gt; Here&#39;s another problem with the notion of software &quot;style&quot;.
&gt; Architectural styles go in and out of fashion, and aren&#39;t necessarily
&gt; appropriate (for example the greeks building temples in a style better
&gt; suited to wood that stone). None of this stuff from the physical world
&gt; carries over very well, I&#39;m afraid.

There are two types of Architecture in the real world of buildings:

   1) the artistic shells that a bunch of critics talk about as yet
      another way of demonstrating their linguistic flexibility
      without actually having a clue about buildings;

   2) the design for construction of a building in order to fit its
      long-term purpose while occasionally transcending it in other
      dimensions.

Amongst actual successful architects (not the critics who write about
them), styles are an important organizing method based (usually) on
the materials available in a given location.  Those styles are all
over the place.  Most people, however, only know about the monumental
styles (the outlandish ones used to construct churches, temples, and
civic structures that are meant to be more visually imposing than
truly functional).

Only one in a million architects reach the stage of a Gehry, who
can devote his focus entirely on his artistic style (while his
crowd of apprentices try to make the building work).

REST, as styles go, is more like the architecture of barnyards and
office suites.  The notion that there is anything lo or hi about it
demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding -- it&#39;s like saying

   &quot;That is a good barn, and I soooo like how the 3ft-wide main door
   is slimming and artistic.&quot;

There is no gray area when a constraint is violated, even if the
pain is not immediately apparent.  The purpose of the architectural
style is to let us know what fits, and what doesn&#39;t, before we try
to lead a horse through the door.
