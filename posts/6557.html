Not exactly.  A resource is a conceptual mapping.  That mapping may be
as abstract as &quot;the Apple Store&quot; or as concrete as a single apple that
was at one time in a box at the Apple Store.  A resource is largely
defined by what you make of it.  So it is possible that the
representations of a given resource do not change over time.
A web site is a resource.  A web page (the conceptual page expected
by a user when they follow a hypertext link) is a resource.
So are each of the in-line elements that make up that page, as
are (at least for the server) all of the files/programs used to
construct the content of that page.  Each of those are separate
resources in their own right.

But knowing what the &quot;resource&quot; is does not teach much about REST,
since REST is designed to hide that information from clients.

Lots of people complain about the definition, largely because
it seems so nebulous and effectively anything could be a resource.
What they don&#39;t understand is that allowing anything to be a resource
is the goal, and REST describes how to build an architecture that
can effectively manipulate anything even when the client has no
idea what that thing actually may be.  That&#39;s the point.

If an application can accomplish the user&#39;s need of today in a
way that is reusable by others, and without revealing much of
anything about how it works, then there is a good chance that
the implementation of how it works can evolve independently of
the user and also that how the user makes use of that work can
evolve independently from what was anticipated by the resource
owner.  Those are two of the goals of REST: independent evolvability
and design-for-serendipity.  There are other goals (e.g., scalability).
