&gt; Well, in the last years I went through the archives several times, and

&gt; interested.

The only thing that recursive PROPFIND is used for within actual
webdav applications is directory listings.  Those are better implemented
as a single resource that is defined by the collection itself, and
whose representation(s) are available at a distinct URI.

The most recent reference you are looking for is

   http://xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/003191.html

with particular attention to the second-to-last paragraph.

Most of the other discussion was at the Xerox PARC and UCI f2f
meetings.  WebDAV made certain choices and is limited to Save As
dialogs because of them.  WebDAV discussions are hopeless because
the WebDAV specifications redefined the meaning of resource to be
the same as file, thereby failing to handle the interesting cases
of Web authoring in favor of duplicating FTP.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That seems to be a problem with the concept of moving resources
&gt;&gt;&gt; around, not with the actual definition of the MOVE method, right?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, it is a problem with specifying multiple arguments when both the
&gt;&gt; syntax and the access control mechanism assume there is only one.
&gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t quite fit in the original HTTP syntax.
&gt;
&gt; That&#39;s correct. So are you suggesting that there&#39;s a way to model a  
&gt; move
&gt; operation without specifying two arguments that should have been  
&gt; used to
&gt; define a MOVE-like method?

No.  It is possible to do so by exchanging representations of the
before and after hierarchy, but I am not saying it should have been
done that way.  I was only saying that WebDAV failed to consider the
implications of how that change in method semantics impacts the rest
of the HTTP model (particularly, access control and how to express
partial failure conditions).

WebDAV is history.  The only interesting discussion is how much,
if anything, should be recovered from it when a replacement is
designed.  Almost all of WebDAV&#39;s design rationales -- so-called
performance issues -- are obsolete as soon as the message syntax
is no longer MIME.  What is the actual design rationale for locking
(hint: it isn&#39;t the lost update problem)?  What resource is it
that WebDAV clients are actually looking for when they do recursive
PROPFIND requests?  Where should namespace operations be targeted?
Those are interesting questions.
