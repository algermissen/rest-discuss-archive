Yeah, Yaron&#39;s twisted little view of history.  It would be more  
accurate to say
that some people insisted HTTP could not carry internationalized data in
header fields (which is blatantly false -- it is only inconveniently  
encoded),
and thus spawned an incredibly convoluted XML format for properties,  
which
later got boiled down to name-value pairs (like all metadata systems).   
DASL
got invented because an XML search interface was needed to deal with  
the complex
properties, but was later dropped due to lack of interest in a  
half-assed
variation of what the real database people were working on with XQuery.

The issue of identification started because of a really bad paper tiger  
design
for munging URIs that was proposed by someone else, rejected, and then  
replaced
by me during a meeting at Xerox PARC with the imagemap-style URI  
provided
by the server.  Larry did not object to that style of munging.  The  
design was
not used by WebDAV because the editors chose not to for some unknown  
reason,
not because there was any objection from the working group (on the  
contrary,
both Henrik and I objected to the extra methods).  All of that nonsense
about extra round-trips is just bullshit invented by Yaron --  
Microsoft&#39;s own
implementations had no such concern for round-trips and actually made  
two
unnecessary requests prior to each WebDAV resource action just to check  
if it
was actually WebDAV-enabled.

WebDAV is stuck with that design because we let Microsoft dominate the
working group as the only significant implementation.  Apache&#39;s mod_dav
didn&#39;t come along until much later.  Henrik&#39;s implementation in libwww,
completed during the HTTP/1.1 design, was ignored because it didn&#39;t use  
XML.
