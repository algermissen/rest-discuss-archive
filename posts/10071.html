&gt;&gt; PUT basically means that the client is asserting tha=
t the new
&gt;&gt; state of the resource corresponds to the representation in the=

&gt;&gt; request body. However, the server may honour that request in any
&gt;&gt; way=
 it chooses, incl. deriving parts of the new resource state
&gt;&gt; from previou=
s resource state. What=92s crucial, though, is that the
&gt;&gt; client cannot as=
sume that this will be the case, and the server
&gt;&gt; cannot assume that the c=
lient intended a partial update.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; ... I understand that for the inte=
nt to be clear, there&#39;d have to be a
&gt; new verb such as PATCH if *any* clie=
nt should be able to express the
&gt; intent of a partial update.
&gt; And althou=
gh it would be _OK_ for a server to handle a PUT with a
&gt; &#39;diff&#39; differentl=
y, this would have to be part of a server-specific
&gt; out-of-band agreement =
(and a generic client couldn&#39;t be held
&gt; responsible).
&gt;
&gt; Or would you say=
 it&#39;s _wrong_ for a server to treat a PUT with a diff
&gt; format this way?

I=
t is wrong.  A resource is not just the state -- it is also the
mapping fro=
m state to representation(s).  For example, you can have
one resource that =
is my home page and a second resource that is the
text/html version of my h=
ome page, and those two resources are
different even if they have the same =
representation most of the
time and the same state all of the time.  A diff=
 is a representation
of how to get from one state to another, not a represe=
ntation of
either of those states.  Therefore, it is always wrong to &quot;patch=
&quot;
the resource on a PUT of a diff, as opposed to setting the resource
state=
 to the diff.  That is why I introduced PATCH in the first
drafts of HTTP/1=
.1.

What Aristotle may have been referring to is the ability of a server
t=
o take one state update (via PUT) and reflect that update in
various ways o=
n later GET.  That is because there is no correlation
in HTTP between a PUT=
 and any subsequent GET other than that
described by the server itself (via=
 etags).  For example, if you do
a PUT of a diff in context (diff -C3) form=
at, it is reasonable for
the server to later supply a different representat=
ion of that same
diff in the uniform (diff -u) format (assuming anyone ever=
 bothers
to register the media types).
