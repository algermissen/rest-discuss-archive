&gt;&gt; Well, no, the gist of it is t=

&gt;&gt; no matter what the request.  The clie=

it receives a 204?
&gt;&gt; A 404?  A 410?  How about a 456?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The point of =
having a flexible interface is to be flexible.
&gt;&gt; The more response codes y=

&gt; Would there be =
a recommended response code to be returned in this particular or is that in=
consequential (even if clients can handle whatever they get)?

Neither REST=
 nor HTTP would care.  I would send 200 or 204,
because there is no equival=
ent of a &quot;rm -f&quot; (i.e., remove even
if it doesn&#39;t exist&quot;) in HTTP.  If the =
client actually wants
to check that it exists, then the request would inclu=
de an

If-match: * 

and the precondition failed response would then be req=
uired.
