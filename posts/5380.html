&gt; However, at the same time, my understanding is that REST was designed
&gt; to represent the way the (normal) web already works today.  And the
&gt; fact of the matter is that there&#39;s *lots* of websites that support
&gt; the equivalent of PUT and DELETE operations without actually using
&gt; them.  While its nice to think this problem might be solved by new
&gt; browsers, that&#39;s not really a viable option in the short term.

REST is a style of interaction that produces certain properties
that we want out of a system.  The Web is an implementation, some
of which is standardized (the good stuff) and some of which was
hacked-in by folks who were just trying to make a customer happy.
We can&#39;t work around an architecture -- we leave it as soon as
the attempt is made.  To work around browser bugs, just fix the
stupid bugs or use a better browser.

I am amazed by how few people bother to point out Apache httpd
bugs that interfere with REST, even when they know I can fix them
once I know they exist and why they need to change.

The only reason the browsers haven&#39;t been fixed is because the
people who want them fixed haven&#39;t tried.  I&#39;ve been too busy
and don&#39;t have a machine that will compile Firefox.  If people
would spend less time trying to convince Web Services to do what
they don&#39;t want to do and more time simply helping Web browser
developers fix their bugs, maybe we could make some progress.

If someone here patches Firefox and Ernie applies some peer
pressure on Safari, I am quite certain that I can guilt the
MSIE developers into fixing it as well.  Just come up with a
simple statement of what needs fixing and why.
