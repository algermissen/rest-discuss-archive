Subject:Questions about hypermedia api design<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi all,


I would like to get some advice on how to improve the way we build our
hypermedia apis.


We currently use HAL as our base hypermedia format and all non safe
interactions are done using bare json documents submitted through http
posts. The link relations are simple identifiers which are not the proper
way to do it.


The problems that I can see are:
By using non standard link relations clients that are not produced by us
have no way to find the resources that the server provides.
By using bare json documents the clients have no way to know the format of
documents expected by the server making it harder for clients to be
developed and to keep them compatible to server when has to change.


I'm thinking about raising api "hateoas" level by stating that all non safe
interactions have to be done throughout HAL forms. That way clients can
inspect the forms and know if they are compatible with server. By doing
this I think that will ease both client development and maintenance. But I
still have the following doubts:


1 - should we use HAL forms instead of uri templates? We currently use uri
templates a lot but they don't have any built in mechanism to indicate
format and validation.
2 - when making the safe requests how can we give clients any way to check
the format of these responses? Should we use json schema?


To solve our link relation problem I was thinking about creating a
specification for inline relations using urns. I have to further develop
this idea but the basics are:


the urns would be composed of a set of properties. I was thinking about, at
least, three properties:
 organization - A kind of hierarchical structure like a java package to
capture hierarchical nature of organizations
subject - The matter to which the operation is made to act
operation - action that will be carried on.


An example would be:
urn:Ilr:organization=com.myorganization,subject=order,operation=create


There would be 2 two kinds of inline relations: pointers and selectors.
Pointers indicate resources that are directly involved in fulfilling the
operation on the subject as stated in the urn. Selectors sets restrictions
on links in the resource.
For example:


The
pointer:urn:ilr:organization=com.myorganization,subject=order,action=create
points to the resource you have to use in order to create a client order
(in my case a hal form)


The selector:urn:ilr:organization:com.mycompany.* points to a resource that
contains all links to any sub organization of com.mycompany like
com.mycompany.mydepartment and all its subjects and operations.


This distinction will help on finding a resource in a decentralized
environment where resources can be add and removed without centralized
control.


As I said this have to be refined but I would like to know if there is
already something like this or even if this is a good idea.


Any help will be very appreciated!


Att,
Osvaldo Pina.

Subject:Canary fields<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I've just had a problem with serialization of JSON in Go that seems like it
would be a general problem. I don't know about the elegance of my solution
or its generality but I doubt I'm the only one who came to it, and further
than others must've come up with something similar.

The context is this: Go permissively deserializes JSON into structs -
attributes that don't correspond to a struct member are ignored silently,
and struct members without a corresponding JSON attribute are left with a
zero value. When the server is upgraded, if its versions of JSON resources
get new attributes, the client ignores them (nbd), but when the client does
a PUT with the intention of updating, it zeros out attributes of which it
is unaware. The solution to this problem was not difficult (and involved an
applicaiton of the concept of lenses in the Go context...).

The problem is: if the server receives an PUT update, how does it know that
the update is legitimate, or produced by a pre-lens client who may have
elided important fields?

My solution is that the server adds a JSON attribute on all resources whose
name is the Etag of the resource, and whose value is (unconditionally)
"canary." PUTs without this field intact are assumed not to know how to
properly do updates and return a 4xx status.

I dimly feel as if I'm reimplementing something I may have heard/read in
passing, but I'm wondering if the technique is well known? Perhaps it is
(or should be) deprecated - if so in favor of what?

Subject:WS-REST Call for Papers...<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>WS-REST 2018 has announced the call for papers[1]
Join us in sunny Lyon, France in April for a jam-packed one-day workshop on Web Services, REST, and Web APIs.
This year we're running two tracks for submissions: Research and Industry.
The Research track is accepting 3-6 page original papers eligible for publication in the conference proceedings.
The Industry track only requires 500 word abstracts for review and selection. We're hoping this opens the potential speaker pool to a wide array of practitioners, authors, and anyone with real-world experience to share.

Deadline for submissions is January 17th.

Feel free to ping me if you have any questions.
Cheers.
