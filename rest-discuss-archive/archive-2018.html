Message:<br><br>
<pre>The call for papers for WS-REST 2018 has been extended to January 25th[1]
Join us in sunny Lyon, France in April for a jam-packed one-day workshop on Web Services, REST, and Web APIs.
This year we're running two tracks for submissions: Research and Industry.
The Research track is accepting 3-6 page original papers eligible for publication in the conference proceedings.
The Industry track only requires 500 word abstracts for review and selection. We're hoping this opens the potential speaker pool to a wide array of practitioners, authors, and anyone with real-world experience to share.
Deadline for submissions is extended to January 25th.
Feel free to ping me if you have any questions.
Cheers.
