The proposed\n&gt;&gt; specs are describing an RPC-like system. What they are not describing\n&gt;&gt; is an architecture whereby representations of application state are\n&gt;&gt; transferred, but rather an architecture made up of procedures invoked\n&gt;&gt; upon specified URIs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; YES!  The proposed specs are kind of RPCish. (They are at least \n&gt; conforming to the uniform interface).  The point is to jumpstart things.\n&gt;\n&gt; To be fair....\n&gt;\n&gt; The two transaction specifications (compensation and 2pc) were written 8 \n&gt; years ago.  The messaging one was a simple exercise I did to create a \n&gt; facade over an existing messaging implementation (JMS).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think there are a huge amount of improvements we can make here.  For \n&gt; instance instead of defining URL patterns, URLs can be made more opaque \n&gt; and instead the spec defines a set of resources, link relationships, and \n&gt; interactions with those relationships.\n&gt;\n&gt; For messaging JMS is a *VERY* session oriented model.  The key piece to \n&gt; extract from this exercise is that HTTP messages are being exchanged \n&gt; rather than an envelope format.  To improve things, Atom can be borrowed \n&gt; from (at least the interactions not the envelope format).  restms.org \n&gt; has also done some interesting stuff.  I and others doing messaging at \n&gt; Red Hat have a few other ideas as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; For security, I think many things are well defined (authentication comes \n&gt; to mind).  I think OAuth has huge potential to manage authentication \n&gt; when you are running a Queue, Topic, Transaction Management, Workflow \n&gt; when you&#39;re dealing with Service as a Service (SaaS) (think Amazon SQS). \n&gt;   multipart/encrypted and signed could be used for multipoint messaging. \n&gt;   The question becomes, how do you integrate all these existing security \n&gt; mechanisms with the services REST-*.org want to define?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, a few years ago I started off very skeptical against REST.  A \n&gt; friend and former mentor of mine, Steve Vinoski took the time over weeks \n&gt; to convince me otherwise.  Through the process I kept an open mind and \n&gt; became convinced REST was good direction for distributed computing.  I \n&gt; think I&#39;ve kept an open mind while discussing things on this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope many of you can keep an open mind with what we&#39;re trying to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;   \n\nSo this would be a directory of useful hypermedia, and extensions for HTTP?\n\nThat could be a good resource\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
