I understand that for the intent to be clear, there&#39;d have\n&gt; to be a new verb such as PATCH if *any* client should be able\n&gt; to express the intent of a partial update.\n\nOr in absence of PATCH, if you only have the big five, you can\ntunnel through POST to a patch resource, which can then be\nadvertised adequately in hypermedia. It’s an ugly way of going\nabout this, but at least POST is explicit about having little\nintrinsic meaning.\n\n&gt; And although it would be _OK_ for a server to handle a PUT with\n&gt; a &#39;diff&#39; differently, this would have to be part of a\n&gt; server-specific out-of-band agreement (and a generic client\n&gt; couldn&#39;t be held responsible).\n&gt;\n&gt; Or would you say it&#39;s _wrong_ for a server to treat a PUT with\n&gt; a diff format this way?\n\nIt’s bad. You switch on the media type to tunnel a different verb\nover PUT. Even worse in this particular case, the verb you’re\nusing should be idempotent but the verb you are tunnelling is\nnot. Tunnelling via POST is less objectionable.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
