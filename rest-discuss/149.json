If I can&#39;t put an identifier in\n&gt; a browser URL bar and expect to get some set of bytes back then I don&#39;t\n&gt; personally think it is really REST-y. But then REST is just a philosophy\n&gt; so there will be differences of opinion on that. I would say that\n&gt; message-id&#39;s should be HTTP URLs that dereference to the message\n&gt; contents and that ACLs should be used to say who can and cannot see it.\n&gt; Archives of messages (e.g. egroups) could add a header\n\nRFC2111 says that message IDs are just presumed to\nbe in some accessible message store.  And it is up\nto the local implementation to deal with resolving\nit.\n\nThat being said, I like the idea of making\nmessage-ids resolvable via HTTP and may add that\nas a &quot;Should&quot; to the MIME-RPC spec.\n\n&gt; &gt; The last one is important.  XML does not easily\n&gt; &gt; allow delivery of multiple XML documents or other\n&gt; &gt; opaque data types like graphics or MSOffice files.\n&gt; &gt; MIME is designed to do just that.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is easy to set up an HREF from an XML document to a MIME. I don&#39;t\n&gt; know whether SOAP does it intelligently or not. In Python it would take\n&gt; me a couple of lines to get from an HREF to a MIME part so I don&#39;t know\n&gt; what MIME-RPC adds.\n\nBut then you are not interpreting the XML document\ncorrectly.  What happens when an XML schema\nconflicts with an the MIME-type of an href&#39;ed\nresource.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s nothing wrong with RPC if it meets your needs. And MIME-RPC\n&gt; seems a good way to do RPC if you are trying to avoid defining an XML\n&gt; vocabulary. But I haven&#39;t yet seen how a REST web application would take\n&gt; advantage of any of the MIME-RPC conventions.\n\nOk.  So part of what I am saying is that REST only\nworks for a fairly limited application domain.\nHowever, in the context of REST, I am also saying\nthat one may want:\n\n* to communicate asynchronously\n* to package primitive types with other types\n* to interoperate better with web browsers\n* to avoid using XML but have unambiguous\nsemantics\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
