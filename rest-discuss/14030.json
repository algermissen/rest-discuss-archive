Currently, compression only affects the body of an\nHTTP request, not the headers. And, particularly in the REST world\nwhere I think headers are relied upon even more heavily, a &quot;simple\nrequest&quot; can be much more than simply &quot;GET /resource&quot;.\n\nFunny thing is, though, that REST over HTTP could have Header\ncompression today between a compatible client and server. It could\nsimply, &quot;compress the headers&quot; in to a single X-Compressed-Header,\nwith a base64 encoding, or some other contrivance. My point being is\nthat I think the header compression, should it be of value, can be\ndone with current clients and servers over HTTP. Clearly, not all of\nthe headers would be compressed, but a majority could be, and it can\nbe made available through Con-neg. Mind, I&#39;ve put a whole 2 minutes\nthinking this through.\n\nThe darkside of SPDY, is that it&#39;s all over SSL. Which pretty much\nobliterates caching in the large, something I think many REST\nadvocates hold dear. Clients could still cache, but that would be\nabout it.\n\nGranted, it&#39;s still young, they&#39;re just playing with this, and it may\nor may not gain any tractions whatsoever. But I thought it would be\ninteresting to take a quick look at it through REST colored glasses.\nAt first glance, it&#39;s not clear that it would offer a whole lot to a\nREST MtoM architecture.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
