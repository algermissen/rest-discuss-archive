Did a quick search and came across\n&gt; http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestAndUriOpacity\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST does not require that a URI be opaque. The only place where the\n&gt; word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I complain about the\n&gt; opaqueness of cookies. In fact, RESTful applications are, at all\n&gt; times, encouraged to use human-meaningful, hierarchical identifiers in\n&gt; order to maximize the serendipitous use of the information beyond what\n&gt; is anticipated by the original application.&quot; Roy Fielding\n\nWow, I didn&#39;t know that. But that makes sense.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for setting me straight :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Still don&#39;t like the WSDL-like nature of WADL though and this still\n&gt; leaves open the question of how does a client discover the mechanism\n&gt; to construct a URI. HTML specifies that anchor tags contain opaque\n&gt; URIs and, yes, form tags can specify a GET with an opaque base URI\n&gt; plus querystring parameters. But this information is specified at the\n&gt; level of the content-type format specification (as HTML does). That\n&gt; way, the client knows that if they have been fed text/html or\n&gt; application/xhtml+xml then these URI rules apply.\n\nI agree, the issues I&#39;ve complained about regarding WADL is using it\n(or any IDL) to perform code generation. Once that happens it creates\na statically coupled (early bound) dependency on the server. This is\nan unhealthy constraint on a RESTful server.\n\nURI Templates _could_ be used in the same way - generating static and\nremote constraints on the server-side URI generation.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Following that logic, URI construction rules should be specified by\n&gt; the content-type format specification. Unfortunately, most formats\n&gt; make no such provision and those that do (such as Atom [1], RDF-RSS\n&gt; [2], RSS [3], OPML [4] or Sitemaps [5]) specify opaque URIs. I can&#39;t\n&gt; find any reference to URI construction or templates in APP [6] either.\n\nI&#39;ve been noticing that most formats don&#39;t support/expose URI or Forms\ngeneration either, and in my recent blog post [1] I&#39;ve predicted that\nthis current situation is going to change in the next 10 years. Right\nnow HTML(and HTML Forms)+microformats enable the &quot;low tech&quot; approach.\nRDF offers a &quot;high-tech&quot; approach. I&#39;m predicting that experience and\nnew schema technologies will support the more common combining of all\nthese things.\n\n[1] http://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2008/01/comments-rest-interactions-and.html\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Indeed, the only specification (draft) that I have found is from Joe\n&gt; Gregorio &quot;URI Template&quot; [7][8] and that does not address discovery so\n&gt; far as I can see.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the absence of URI templating at the Content-Type level (excepting\n&gt; the &#39;primitive&#39; templating in HTML) any attempt to implement URI\n&gt; templating at present effectively means that each client must coded on\n&gt; a site-specific basis. I would argue that URI are, to all intents and\n&gt; purposes, generally opaque (whilst acknowledging that REST doesn&#39;t\n&gt; require it - see above). Note that opaque doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t\n&gt; be &#39;pretty&#39;, &#39;hackable&#39; or human-readable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I note the proposal to include URI Templates in the WHATWG activity\n&gt; [9] Mike refers to, but that doesn&#39;t help with any of the other\n&gt; formats.\n&gt;\n&gt; Apologies for posting at more length than I normally do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; http://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-3.2.2\n&gt; [2] http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/spec\n&gt; [3] http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\n&gt; [4] http://www.opml.org/spec2\n&gt; [5] http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php\n&gt; [6] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-4.1\n&gt; [7] http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-01.html\n&gt; [8] http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-02.html\n&gt; [9] http://blog.welldesignedurls.org/2007/01/11/proposing-uri-templates-for-webforms-2/\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/16/08, David Orchard &lt;dorchard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yet again, somebody claims that URIs are supposed to be  opaque under REST.
