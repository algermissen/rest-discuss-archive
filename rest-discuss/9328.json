I then have a &#39;confirmed&#39; email but would be\n&gt; the only one with the credentials.\n\nThat&#39;s a good observation.\nWhy would someone want to do this? I can think of two reasons:\n\n- the &#39;just because&#39; factor,\n\n- spamming the email owner with &#39;newletters&#39; from the website -- but\n  there are better ways to spam someone rather than relying on that\n  someone following the validation link and the frequency of the\n  newsletter.\n\nI&#39;m pretty much ruling out anonymity because there are pbetter\nmechanisms to hide your identity (tor network, throw-away hotmail\naddress, etc.).\n\nWhat other reasons are there?\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
