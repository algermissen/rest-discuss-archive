A practical reason is that the meaning is\n&gt; &gt; more obvious, especially to most firewalls that permit blocking based\n&gt; &gt; on methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, but here&#39;s where you and I diverge, Mark.  While you see enabling\n&gt; firewalls as a positive, I see it as an unnecessary and undesirable hinderance\n&gt; to adoption of new technology.  I.e., are notification applications so\n&gt; semantically different that we need to differentiate them for the purposes of\n&gt; firewall filtering *beyond* existing method filtering and the already\n&gt; significant issue of connection asymmetry?\n\nIt&#39;s not just firewalls.  To any intermediary, the effort in determining\nwhat&#39;s going on is going to be greater for the extension header than for\nthe extension method, at least during the initial transaction where the\nintermediary learns what the Watcher URI is.  In an environment with\nvery long lived subscriptions where that initial cost gets amortized,\nit&#39;s less of an issue.  But in the absence of that info, and knowing\nthat the method I need to use for subscription is POST (not PUT as with\nWebDAV LOCK), and so the chances of reusing deployed optimizations is\nnil, I&#39;d go for the new method.\n\nBut it&#39;s not a huge deal, I could live with either approach.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
