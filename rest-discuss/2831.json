We&#39;re talking about HTTP GET, so it would have to be HTTP \n&gt; headers...which is a pain for structured information.\n\nAs long as it&#39;s part of the *message*.  Headers seem the obvious place,\nbut the body&#39;s fine too.  There&#39;s many ways to do this.\n\n&gt; What if each individual page on a site uses only some small subset of \n&gt; them? There are performance costs to sending them all every time. It is \n&gt; quite a bit cheaper to send a URL or list of URLs and let the recipient \n&gt; choose which to dereference and how deeply to follow links into the \n&gt; representations it finds.\n\nYep, very true.  The WAPforum went back and forth on this for quite a\nwhile with CC/PP.  Initially, everybody assumed that the preferences\nwould be cached, but I&#39;m pretty sure the final decision was to send\nall the data in each message.  I could be wrong, the final decision\nhappened after I left, and after I cared.\n\n&gt; To me, statelessness has these advantages:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1. Conversations can migrate between agents and devices because there \n&gt; is no privileged information associated with the connection between the \n&gt; initial &quot;initator&quot; and the &quot;listener&quot;. My proposal preserves this.\n\nYep.\n\n&gt;   2. Filtering, caching and other intermediary projects are easier \n&gt; because there is no need to store state between messages. My proposal \n&gt; preserves this. Filters and caches _may_ need to dereference URIs, but \n&gt; they don&#39;t have to maintain state themselves. That is important for \n&gt; scalability. It means cache&#39;s memory usage does not increase with the \n&gt; number of conversations they watch.\n\nYep.\n\n&gt;   3. If a message is missed or a conversation partner dies, it is easy \n&gt; to &quot;reboot&quot; and &quot;resynch&quot; the client and server state through transfer \n&gt; of representations. My proposal preserves this.\n\nState of preferences?  Ok.\n\n&gt;   4. Logs are explicit so that historically you can look at a single \n&gt; message in isolation and understand its meaning entirely. My proposal \n&gt; does not preserve this.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; In a perfect world, I would get all 4 every time. But if the only \n&gt; problem is really &quot;4.&quot; then I consider that an acceptable cost. On the \n&gt; other hand, if there is some other major benefit of scalability I am \n&gt; missing...\n\nNo, that&#39;s a good summary.  With any design choice, it&#39;s pros vs. cons.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple policy decision could turn the same message\nsyntax into a stateless transaction, if the URI were to identify a\nfixed preferences profile that didn&#39;t change over time.  So if the\npreferences change, the URI changes.  This would allow you to include\nURIs for fixed and common preference profiles, while including the\nfrequently-changing preferences by-value.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
