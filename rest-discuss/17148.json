It&#39;s described by an XML\n&gt;&gt; schema and\n&gt;&gt; it seems to me that my client must have this schema baked into the\n&gt;&gt; code in\n&gt;&gt; order to work with it - how would it otherwise know how to mark-up the\n&gt;&gt; data\n&gt;&gt; needed to describe, for instance, a purchase order? This is where my\n&gt;&gt; understanding of a dynamic client breaks down. The client may have\n&gt;&gt; multiple\n&gt;&gt; known schemas to choose between - for instance Danish and German\n&gt;&gt; variations\n&gt;&gt; of purchase order schemas.

With SOAP/WSDL you\n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; given\n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything up front and have to figure out what to use when. With\n&gt;&gt; REST you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are only served the links that fits the actual state. You cannot do\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; last\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with WSDL.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes, you can. At least with WSDL (let&#39;s forget SOAP). WSDL is a\n&gt;&gt; web\n&gt;&gt; format, registered in IANA, and I can get it dynamically and consume\n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; dynamically. Nobody does it because of tools, granted. The shame is on\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; tool designers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I guess that depends on how you consume the XForm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Totally true. Knowing the XFORM up front will make you write a rigid\n&gt;&gt; client.\n&gt;&gt; Same for WSDL. Consuming the XFORM dynamically will make everybody\n&gt;&gt; happy. It\n&gt;&gt; is harder with WSDL, but possible too.\n&gt;&gt; Here the real difference is then the actual implementation, plus, I\n&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt; say, XFORM is still light, and WSDL we may label it as &quot;heavy&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
