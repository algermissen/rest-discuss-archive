Rather\n&gt; counter-intuitive. I&#39;m not sure how intermediaries will treat the\n&gt; message set.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would a better alternative be the following?\n&gt;\n\nRight.  Works in practice, but that tests only the network path between my \nworkstation and my server.  I don&#39;t want to require a VPN connection to \nDELETE, nor do I want to set 404 and 410 responses to uncacheable.  What \nI&#39;ve described has the advantage of being simple to implement on the server, \nthe disadvantage is it&#39;s a bit bass-ackwards.  So I&#39;m looking for a simple, \nfass-rontwards alternative, or something besides no-cache to make what I \nhave work.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
