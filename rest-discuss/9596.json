The big new feature of v0.5 is that it  \nprovides a programmable API so that you can control the storage grid  \nin a programming language of your choice without having to understand  \nhow the storage grid is implemented.\n\nWe chose to offer a RESTful API with a few bits of JSON encoding here  \nand there.  This is the first time we&#39;ve tried to design an API  \naccording to REST principles, and I would be very interested in  \nfeedback from the people of this group about how well this API fits  \nthe precepts of the REST approach.\n\nOne particular question I have is: why the heck don&#39;t web browsers  \nsupport PUT and DELETE actions?  Our API can be used directly from a  \nstandard not-javascript-enabled web browser, but for that purpose we  \nhave to contort it to encode PUT and DELETE commands into POST  \ncommands so that the web browser will send the command to the web  \nserver.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nRegards,\n\nZooko\n\n"}}
