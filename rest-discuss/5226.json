This is close to the API I am leaning to. Reading more on \nREST, I realize that I must think in term of resources as opposed to \noperations. So the acquisition operation that I want to offer can be \nseen as a &quot;Device Communication&quot; resource.\n\n  * The POST will create the  resource (i.e. initiate a communication \nand create log data about it), and return the URI to this data.\n\n  * the GET on the returned URI will return the communication log data. \nThis data may even indicate an &quot;in progress&quot; status when requested \nbefore the end of the communication.\n\n  * A PUT on this same URI, with appropriate input, may be used to \nchange the status of the communication, i.e. cancel the communication. \nNot sure about this one ... just thought about it.\n\nFinally, I was thinking that the GET URL called on an &quot;in progress&quot; \ncommunication could (optionally) return live log info and the document \nreturned will not be completed until the communication completes. The \nclient invoking the resouorce that way could output the log info in a \nwindow to have real time feedback from the service. Not sure about that \none either...\n\n--\n\n"}}
