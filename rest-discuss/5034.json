Simpler than what we use for databases. The\nresult is essentially a lowest common denominator. The results are in\nRSS, the protocol is HTTP.\n\nThere is no doubt that database binary wire formats are definitely past\ntheir sell-by date. Think of how many database drivers we could dispense\nwith if they all used one wire format.\n\nHe doesn&#39;t say much about queries, but name-value pairs\n(application/x-www-form-urlencoded as used by HTML forms) or Google (no\nreal syntax) seem to be as far as it goes. Again, lowest common\ndenominator.\n\nI don&#39;t think anything he is proposing contradicts the REST\narchitectural style either.\n\n&gt; complex XPath expressions could always be encoded as URLs in\n&gt; some manner to provide the sort of complex joins you are talking about.\n\nOr, maybe the indexes necessary to make joins work will be maintained by\nthird party intermediaries (Google?), and they would be the servers to\nquery. These third parties might run spiders specialised on particular\nXML or RDF namespaces or schemas.\n\n[snip]\n&gt; I actually think he&#39;s correct that RSS/Atom is becoming the standard\n&gt; &quot;Noun&quot; format that is the subject of the HTTP &quot;Verbs&quot; (with proxies\n&gt; and other intermediaries becoming the &quot;Adverbs&quot; I guess.)\n\nI see URIs as the nouns, and RSS/Atom as more of a structure to hang\nmetadata on.\n\nI agree that HTTP methods are verbs, but I wonder whether\nintermediaries-as-adverbs is stretching the analogy a bit. :)\n\n"}}
