So it&#39;s unavoidable that the\nmeanings (you say semantics) are being written out operationally\nin terms of server behavior.  That doesn&#39;t bother me, and from what\nI observe it&#39;s rarely the cause of confusion.\n\nWhat caused confusion in this instance was trying to interpret\n&quot;non-idempotent&quot; as a constraint: f(f(x) != f(x).  That&#39;s a logical\nnegation of idempotence, whereas the authors of RFC2616 had in\nmind something different: the absence of any constraint at all.\n(Replace the &quot;!=&quot; with an operator which means &quot;no relation&quot;.)\n\nThat&#39;s a pretty serious confusion if you end up thinking that you\nmust design a system such that if it POSTs twice, the result had\nbetter not be the same as a single POST.  That would make about\nas much sense as refusing to drive at 40MPH as soon as you\nreach the &quot;end speed zone&quot; sign.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
