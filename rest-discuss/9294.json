If \n&gt;&gt; we can conceive a way to update XML trees without the PATCH message body \n&gt;&gt; taking more bytes than using an XPointer query as I&#39;ve described then \n&gt;&gt; there is no reason to implement PATCH for XML updates.\n&gt;\n&gt;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain all the bytes in the world, \n&gt;and lose his consistency?\n&gt;\n\nYou got me there.  Why not ask Roy?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;PATCH has very specific semantics and a very specific\n&gt;goal of reducing bits on updates. It is a separate method because it\n&gt;needs access to the same (generic) conditional mechanisms as PUT and\n&gt;because POST (when applied to an authorable resource) means append.\n&gt;\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7345\n\nMeaning, I think, that if I POST &lt;dd&gt;Rocky Mountain High&lt;/dd&gt; multiple \ntimes it must be appended multiple times.  Currently, to avoid the \nduplicate entry, I return 400 Bad Request if the entry already exists.  \nSo I&#39;ve pretty well borked POST into not meaning append, except the first \ntime, because I&#39;m forcing merge semantics onto POST.  More importantly:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The generality refers to all resources having the same\n&gt;interface, not all resources having an artificially limited interface.\n&gt;It isn&#39;t even necessary for all resources to support the same set of\n&gt;methods -- only that, when supported, they mean the same thing to all\n&gt;resources.\n&gt; \n\nSince I have some resources which treat POST as append, and others which \ntreat POST as merge, I&#39;ve violated the principle of generality.  As a \nresult, my messages are not self-descriptive, and breaking the Uniform \nInterface constraint results in something that is not REST.\n\nWhich seems to suggest that PATCH is the proper method, unless of course \nthe implementation ends up heavier than just doing a PUT.  Consistency \nis up to the application developer.  I profit by saving bytes, and \nmaintaining consistent method semantics across all my resources.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
