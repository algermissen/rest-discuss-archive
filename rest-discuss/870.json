Let&#39;s say you want to move a resource. On\nUnix, you use a symlink, but you are restricted to file systems that\nhave been mounted. In a standard OS address space you need to account\nfor the indirection in advance and you can only redirect to objects in\nthe same address space. On the Web, you can account for the indirection\nin advance by indirecting *through markup* and you can redirect to any\nresource anywhere. You can also account for redirection after the fact\nusing HTTP status codes but this is quite inefficient and will probably\nbreak some client software.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
