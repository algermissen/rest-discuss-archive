In so=\r\nme systems I\n&gt; &gt; also support PUT for updating the state of resources creat=\r\ned using the\n&gt; &gt; factory, but do not want to allow creating such resources =\r\nwith PUT. \n&gt; &gt; In such contexts, which HTTP status code do you advise to re=\r\nturn when an\n&gt; &gt; attempt is made to PUT to a request URI that does not iden=\r\ntify an already\n&gt; &gt; existing resource? In other words, how do you signal th=\r\nat creation at that\n&gt; &gt; URI with PUT isn&#39;t possible because of this particu=\r\nlar application design?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have often used 404, but I&#39;m also seeing 4=\r\n05 or even 403 being used.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about the collective wisdom of t=\r\nhis group on this subject. \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Philippe Mougin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
