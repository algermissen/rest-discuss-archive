As Bill wrote, it was designed for a\nspecific class of systems, and is not any more general than that.\n\nFor example, SOAP is less specific, and thus less useful.  REST has\nmore constraints, and is thus more tied to a range of applications,\nbut is then more useful to applications within that range.\n\nI think (but cannot prove - yet) that a sweet spot usually exists in\nthe continuum between particular and general that makes an\narchitecture best fit its intended class of application, and the sweet\nspot is delimited by its constraints.\n\n"}}
