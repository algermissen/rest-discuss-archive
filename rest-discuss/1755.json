In SQL, views provide representations of\n&gt; logical entities that may span many physical tables. Obviously the\nmechanism\n&gt; for identifying and resolving an entity is different to identifying and\n&gt; resolving a resource but the principles seem similar. Can a *View* in SQL\nbe\n&gt; considered a rough equivalent to a *Representation* of a resource in REST?\nI really don&#39;t think so.\nA RDBMS view mainly changes schema with regard to naming and I think it&#39;s a\nnamespace operation - it changes the names by which you address/navigate the\ndata.\n\nIf you access the data with something like these:\n SELECT * from view_2 where key = $id\n SELECT * from view_3 where key = $id\n\nthen I think /that/ would be REST &#39;representation&#39; - the resource ID hasn&#39;t\nchanged, only the content returned.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately SQL Databases don&#39;t allow updates through views that span\n&gt; multiple tables.\nI bet there are companies that do that... but not many. I think Dr.\nStonebraker&#39;s last company did something like that.\n\n\n\n"}}
