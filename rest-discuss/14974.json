Phil told me back\nin the eBuilt days (2000) that you were an expert in inventory\ncontrol programs for ERP, so I expect you know the answer to that\nproblem better than I do.\n\nREST does not have a solution to distributed (more than one\ncentral server) transaction problems, other than to use\nserver-side intermediaries to change the problem itself.\nREST doesn&#39;t even try to solve that problem, since it is\nbehind the server interface.\n\nIIRC, the multi-market problem is known to be intractable\neven for strict transaction protocols.  We end up doing the\nsame thing that everyone else does, which is to use journaling\nof orders and either compensating transactions or strict\nseparation of inventory between sites (with periodic rebalancing\nof inventory as stocks decrease).  I think the farmer could\nbe provided with a RESTful application for tracking and\nrebalancing inventory across multiple sites, but I wouldn&#39;t\ncall that a RESTful solution to the inventory problem itself.\nIt just works well enough to keep the farmer happy.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
