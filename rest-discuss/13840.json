A description of \na use case? A description of the components and their interaction? A \ncode example? Well, again concerned about nda&#39;s I&#39;ll try to give a overview.\n\nWe have internal uses and external uses for the connectors. Our \narchitecture is build on very modular modules (what else?) akind of OSGi \n(in spirit, not in implementation) except they are not hot-deployable. \nThose modules are just a (or several) normally written Java class, with \nit&#39;s public methods exposed in a interface. No REST up to here.\n\nThe classes and public methods that are to be exposed as resources/uri&#39;s \nare then annotated with Jersey and injected into a Resource class (our \nclass, not Jersey&#39;s, although it depends a lot on Jersey stuff). This \nresource receives the request coming from one of several connectors and \ndispatch the request to the specified injected method. Content \nnegotiation happens here. In the first version of it we also used Spring \nIntegration, that we had to drop at some point but we&#39;re planning to \nintegrate again in the future. Very easy to do that, just a question of \nconfiguration. A good word to the guys of Spring Integration with whom I \nhad very interesting discussions in their forum and thank God for not \nbeing easily flammable. And a good word for the guys at Jersey also who \nare restless answering questions. Did I say restless? I meant tireless...\n\nThe connectors are responsible for detaching the message from the \nprotocol, deal with the parameters and headers, find the right resource \nand forward  the message to it. And wait for the response and send it \nback if it&#39;s the case. All the connectors have exactly the same \ninterface and behave the same. Actually, most of the functionality is in \na AbstractConnector that the others extend.\n\nWe also have &quot;user-agents&quot; classes, in the development of which I wasn&#39;t \ninvolved, but there is one per connector and I think they should be \ncalled &quot;user-agent connectors&quot; instead of just user-agents. They are \nused in our internal, inter-module communication. For the external ones, \nour starting point is the connectors I described.\n\nI guess this is it as a overview. I hope is what you wanted. I think I \ncannot describe much more than this, specially not the business use cases.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Oct 14, 2009, at 10:52 AM, Ant�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the moment we are using a HTTP, a IMAP, a JMS and a IntraVM \n&gt;&gt; connector. I think at some point we had more (at least a JCR one I \n&gt;&gt; think) but we drop it along the way. We&#39;ll also drop the IntraVM one \n&gt;&gt; in favour of the JMS one by using his VM protocol.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is a work in progress, of course, so I think probably it has \n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s flaws and probably some things could be improved from a REST \n&gt;&gt; point of view, but they are stable and working, meaning we have the \n&gt;&gt; same uniform interface accessing the same resources using the same \n&gt;&gt; URI&#39;s receiving the same responses in all the 4 connectors.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of curiosity: can you provide an example?
