Is this not what you&#39;re\n&gt; driving at?\n\nYeah, seems that would be kind of like trying to write object-oriented \nassembler.  Or something. ;-)  Possible, tedious, and of high cost for \ndubious benefit.  WSDL appears to me to be extreme overkill and \nlow-level cognitive damage for something as simple as a REST-based \napplication --- an overcooked layer cake with colorful acronym \nsprinkles.  Doubtless you need it (and the rest of the &quot;stack&quot;) if \nyou&#39;re doing RPCs, but if you&#39;re just exposing a resource model --- too \nmuch.  (Coordination is punted in either case.)\n\nI think what I&#39;m looking for is something like WSDL that lives at the \nresource / URIspace / HTTP level of abstraction.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
