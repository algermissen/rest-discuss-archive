An important part of the batch-GET operation is the\nability to optimize away the overhead of the singleton retreivals ...\npipelining multiple GETs just isn&#39;t the same as GETting multiple thing\nat once.\n\nIn any case, it seems like some HTTPng might have a b[atch]GET\noperation.  It may even be constrained to take URIs that are\nself-consistent in some way, though I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s\nsuper-important...\n\nIn any case, does anyone feel my pain?\nHow have you worked around it?\n\nWhere eles does HTTP bind too tightly?\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
