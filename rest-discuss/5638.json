Sampson &lt;justin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Several forum=\r\ns, such as the W3C Web Services Architecture working\n&gt; group, have witnesse=\r\nd a high-profile debate over the past few\n&gt; months about applying represent=\r\national state transfer (REST)\n&gt; principles to Web services architectures. (=\r\nREST principles\n&gt; underpin many of the scalable Web-resource naming and acc=\r\ness\n&gt; mechanisms.) This debate about Web principles is valuable,\n&gt; particul=\r\narly with respect to resource identification and operation\n&gt; visibility, bu=\r\nt it is quickly becoming irrelevant to the bigger\n&gt; picture as transport in=\r\ndependence surpasses the Web&#39;s importance\n&gt; to Web services. The REST princ=\r\niples are relevant for HTTP\n&gt; bindings, and for the Web server&#39;s parsing of=\r\n resource names, but\n&gt; they are useless in the context of TCP or message-qu=\r\neue bindings\n&gt; where the HTTP verbs do not apply.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll have to think a=\r\nbout this some more; I&#39;m not entirely sure\n&gt; what to make of it yet.\n\nWerne=\r\nr&#39;s making the same mistake as most other Web services\nproponents; failing =\r\nto distinguish between the different roles of\ntransport and transfer protoc=\r\nols.  Because of this misunderstanding,\nhe also misses the significance of =\r\nHTTP to document oriented\ncomputing.\n\nIt&#39;s ironic too, because he&#39;s now Ama=\r\nzon&#39;s CTO.  Although looking at\nthe design of Amazon&#39;s services, it seems t=\r\nhey don&#39;t appreciate the\narchitectural differences between their &quot;REST&quot; and=\r\n &quot;SOAP&quot; services;\nthey seem to think it&#39;s just an encoding difference.\n\nMar=\r\nk.\n--\nMark Baker.
