If the server\nreceives an XML replacement for a negotiated UR=\r\nI, it can redirect to\nthe media-specific URI for XML. If the server receive=\r\ns the same for a\nnon-negotiated URI, it can simply replace the current repr=\r\nesentation\nand respond with 200.&quot;\n\nI have read and re-read these, but for t=\r\nhe life of me I cannot grok\nwhat you mean ... could you elaborate or show a=\r\nn HTTP message example\nto assist please?\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/rest-discuss/message/5168\n[2] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest=\r\n-discuss/message/5170\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\nh=\r\nttp://simplewebservices.org\n\n\n"}}
