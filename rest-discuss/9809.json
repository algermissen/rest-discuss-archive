That is the truly RESTful\n&gt; &gt; way to do a shopping cart.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds good. However now the burden falls on the client to maintain the\n&gt; cart and if the client crashes, it cannot restore the data unless it is\n&gt; stored some where on the client. For a truly thin client this may or not be\n&gt; a viable option.\n\nIf the client is a browser, then it tends to store its URL history in\npersistent storage, so even if it crashes you can go back to the last\nstate of your basket.\n\nOf course, this is only valid if your application implements the basket\nusing GET rather than POST. I would argue that using GET is the only\nsensible way to do it for browsers, even if it leads to unwieldy looking\nURLs, as users inevitably use the back button and expect to return to the\nprevious state. Only the last part (payment/confirmation) of the process\nshould use POST.\n\nIf the client is not a browser, it should be designed to recover from\ncrashes in much the same way.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
