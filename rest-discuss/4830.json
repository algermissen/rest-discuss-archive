I want users to be able\n&gt; to interact with the application using their browsers (representations\n&gt; in HTML) or programmatically (representations in XML).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like the interaction &quot;pattern&quot; to be similar for both types of\n&gt; access. (Or maybe that&#39;s not something I should want?)\n&gt; \n&gt; The application has a unique URL for each item it exposes to its users.\n&gt; Using a browser, users can GET a URL and see a representation of the\n&gt; item. If they want to edit the item, they click the &quot;Edit&quot; button which\n&gt; would POST back to the same URL. After modifying the values, they click\n&gt; the &quot;Submit&quot; button which POST-s back to the same URL again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Something seems fishy with this design when compared with how it would\n&gt; be done programmatically. A user would GET the URL and receive XML. They\n&gt; would then PUT the modified XML to the same URL which would update the item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Browsers don&#39;t support PUT-ing XML, of course. So we have to POST\n&gt; multipart/form-data. I don&#39;t have a problem with implementing code that\n&gt; can extract the necessary bits from XML or multipart/form-data.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s the intermediate step of POST-ing to the URL to get an editable\n&gt; HTML representation of the item that I&#39;m not happy with.\n&gt; \n&gt; An alternative would be to include a link with a query string parameter\n&gt; like &quot;?mode=edit&quot; but that doesn&#39;t strike me as being very REST-ful, either.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know it&#39;s possible, but I&#39;m trying to avoid returning HTML containing\n&gt; the necessary JavaScript to dynamically transform the initial\n&gt; representation into an editable HTML form at the click of a button\n&gt; (without making another request).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Jason\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
