},\n         { href: &quot;/bar&quot;, type: &quot;barType&quot;, rel: &quot;=\r\nhttp://example.com/customeRel&quot; ]\n\nIn a conversation with someone who is not=\r\n entirely into the whole REST thing they commented\n\n&quot;including the type & r=\r\nelation in the link is extra complexity, if we did it in XML we could just =\r\nfigure that out implicitly from the schema when we GET the linked resource&quot;=\r\n\n\nLeaving aside XML Vs JSON arguments (which aren&#39;t relevant to my question=\r\n) I justified it with an argument that explicitly including the relation me=\r\nant you didn&#39;t need to GET the resource to know what the relationship was (=\r\nas the same type could have different relations to different resources, e.g=\r\n. parent vs child relations) and including the type meant the client could =\r\nknow what it was going to GET without actually getting it - e.g. &quot;I don&#39;t n=\r\need to know about barTypes right now so I won&#39;t bother getting them until I=\r\n need to know about them&quot;\n\nBut afterwards I thought to myself while my argu=\r\nments above seem reasonable there must be other good reasons (that I can&#39;t =\r\nimmediately think of) for being explicit with types & relations in links in=\r\n RESTful APIs.\n\nCan you help me with your thoughts on what those other good=\r\n reasons are?\n\nThanks\nBen\n\n\n"}}
