Then we could take that, and build a set of\nmethods that would be slightly more general than PUT/DELETE (I&#39;ve said\nthat I believe GET is axiomatic, and likely POST too).\n\nPUT/DELETE, as defined in 2616, seem to be optimized for the &quot;web\nauthoring&quot; use case, which while mappable to the kinds of things we\ntalk about doing with REST, have some quirks that make some things\nawkward.  As an example, SOAP can&#39;t use PUT because of the assumption of\nPUT that the body is data-to-be-stored rather than a\nrepresentation-to-be-set.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
