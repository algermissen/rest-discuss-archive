Yes, they may have mostly the same content but\n&gt; they have different breadcrumbs which mean one can&#39;t be cached and served\n&gt; for the other.\n\nJust because you navigated to a location circuitously doesn&#39;t mean\nyou&#39;d want to see that path reflected in your breadcrumbs. You\nprobably want canonicalized breadcrumbs. You have a back button if you\nwant to retrace your steps; you have breadcrumbs to navigate the site.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
