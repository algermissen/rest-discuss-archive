People are just starting to understand\n&gt; REST, how could someone choose atompub when he doesn&#39;t understand\n&gt; REST?\n\nWell yes; yet I see people who deal with REST hardly dealing with Atom / \nAPP. Most of the times indeed it ends up being some proprietary XML or, \nmore likely, some JSON media type being considered &quot;better suited&quot;, less \noverhead to deal with, easier to deliver custom data structures. What \nthey don&#39;t usually say (or see, for that matter) is that, ultimately, \nagain it ends up with systems which seem somewhat tightly coupled, \nJavaScript code in the browser or (even worse) external applications \ndepending upon a custom data structure which might or might not be \nrequired to undergo more or less fundamental changes all along the way. \n From that point of view, I still consider Atom / APP a good thing \nbecause it provides a bit more standards-based convention on how to \nhandle things in a portable, interoperable way. So, at the very least I \nhope some more of its concepts will be likely to make it into things \nlike HAL, Collection+JSON, ...  - or concepts derived from these make it \ninto a successor to the current Atom / APP specs if there are any. :)\n\nCheers,\nKristian\n\n"}}
