REST is much more that using HTTP and using Hypermedia as an Engine\n&gt; to control State. That means, there are several other constrains. The\n&gt; HyperMedia use is just one of the four constrains needed to achieve the\n&gt; use of an universal interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Hypermedia constrain is there because REST was aimed to be a style\n&gt; for systems in a networked environment whose main interaction is the\n&gt; transfer of large hypermedia documents.  I had thought always that, if\n&gt; you are not into that kind of system, you should not use REST as it is,\n&gt; but you may use a derivative.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. REST is a style, detailed with the reasoning of each constrain, which\n&gt; means you can identify which constrains work for your work and use them.\n&gt; You may be using then a subset of the style, perfectly fine, and fits\n&gt; with your application. But your application is not, then RESTFull.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. So, what you see is not only people forgetting about the Hypermedia\n&gt; constrain, but actually using subsets of the style they need. The name\n&gt; you suggest to look for is then not related to the lack of Hypermedia\n&gt; thingies, but of an incomplete use of REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Than brings me to the actual problem that faces what you are proposing:\n&gt; It may be too many names!\n&gt; Actually, some may be completely new styles aimed to different things.\n&gt; I can use representational style of resources, without stating the\n&gt; workflow as a State. It may be transactional and atomic. It may be the\n&gt; RETA.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, we can use the State Machine for workflow, but using RPC as the step\n&gt; unit.  YOu have SMARPC.\n&gt; \n&gt; What about the ones that use REST as CRUD, but with resources? CRUDRES\n&gt; If someone is not using Hypemedias as the state machine supported, it\n&gt; may be they are not using state machine at all. I have seem apis that\n&gt; are more like RPC. So, it is Representational, no State, no Transfer,\n&gt; but RPC. RERPC.\n&gt; \n&gt; And what if they have state machine workflow on server? No Hypermedia.\n&gt; That is the tricky one, since the REST name fits, only that it is not\n&gt; intended for hypermedia transfer, but for transactions. RESTX may be the\n&gt; name.\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, and that is something I was planning to mention in a post when\n&gt; having some time, we may actually review the needs of the applications\n&gt; and define a style, based on REST, that may fit my app needs, instead of\n&gt; forcing the app to support REST just to have that name in the credits. \n&gt; We may find there are less that a dozen totally different styles, all\n&gt; REST children, but with a name on their own. With all the rationale on\n&gt; how to use them, it may be a great help for all those that are not quite\n&gt; there yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen\n&gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Given that the creation of APIs that ignore the hypermedia constraint\n&gt; is undeniably an ongoing activity wouldn&#39;t it be nice to give those a\n&gt; name in order to differentiate them from RESTful APIs?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think that it can in various circumstances be argued to be to have\n&gt; HTTP based APIs that define some URI layout and maybe only use generic\n&gt; media types. It is certainly more useful than doing the same API with\n&gt; RMI, SOAP or CORBA.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; However, given there is no name for them, they simple become\n&gt; &#39;REST-APIs&#39; which obfuscates the fact that systems using those APIs will\n&gt; *not* have the properties induced by REST.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If we name them, differentiation between the two becomes a lot easier.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; What I lack is a compelling name that sounds cool enough so API owners\n&gt; can still be proud even if they are not (yet) in the REST-Olymp of\n&gt; things :-) ?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; HTTP-base APIs\n&gt;&gt; Fixed-URI-APIs\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Both *not* cool....\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;&gt; NORD Software Consulting\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt;&gt; Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;&gt; Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
