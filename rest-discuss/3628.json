Understanding HTTP is essential for practically\nall web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.\n\n&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565928628/topiczero-20&gt;\nHTTP Pocket Reference (Price:  $9.95US)\nby Clinton Wong\nAll web programmers, administrators, and application developers need to be\nfamiliar with HTTP in order to work effectively. The HTTP Pocket Reference\nprovides a solid conceptual foundation of HTTP, and also serves as a quick\nreference to each of the headers and status codes that compose an HTTP\ntransaction. For those who need to get &quot;beyond the browser,&quot; this book is\nthe place to start.\n\n&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471398233/topiczero-20/&gt;\nHTTP Essentials (Price:   $24.49US)\nby Stephen A. Thomas\nThis guide explains the protocol that defines how Web browsers communicate\nwith Web servers, the mechanisms that keep that communication secure, and\ntechniques for accelerating HTTP. Topics include the structure and format of\nHTTP messages; security technologies such as SSL, TLS, and SHTTP; and how to\nhandle compatibility between HTTP versions. Coverage extends to related\ntechnologies such as Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC), Web Proxy Auto\nDiscovery (WPAD), Web Cache Coordination Protocol (WCCP), Internet Cache\nProtocol (ICP) and Hypertext Caching Protocol (HTCP).\n\n\n\n"}}
