Here is what you said\n&gt; in your dissertation:\n&gt; &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from\n&gt; other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between\n&gt; components (Figure 5-6)[...]\n&gt; In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints\n&gt; are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four\n&gt; interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of\n&gt; resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and,\n&gt; hypermedia as the engine of application state. These constraints will be\n&gt; discussed in Section 5.2.\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And in section 5.2 you say:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership function\n&gt; MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, which are\n&gt; equivalent. The values in the set may be resource representations and/or\n&gt; resource identifiers\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if my credit card company exposes\n&gt; &lt;https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary&gt;,\n&gt; the content of which varies depending on a cookie, do you believe that\n&gt; response to a request for this URI is a representation of a REST style\n&gt; Resource?  In particular, do you believe that my account information and\n&gt; your account information are really different representations of the same\n&gt; underlying resource (that they are &quot;equivalent&quot;) or that the resource\n&gt; identified by this URI is simply changing rapidly depending on which of us\n&gt; is making a request at that exact moment?\n&gt;\n&gt; Alternatively, if my credit card company starts using HTTP-auth instead of\n&gt; cookie-auth, would that somehow make your account data and my account data\n&gt; different representations of the same underlying resource?\n&gt;\n&gt; Note to Walden and the other folks on the legal-subpoena thread: We all\n&gt; have a pretty clear notion of what &quot;my account&quot; means.  That the content\nof\n&gt; my account changes over time (because I spend money or others steal it),\n&gt; doesn&#39;t change its identity (Herclitus/flux arguments notwithstanding).\n&gt; The issue here is simply whether or not the concept of &quot;Representation&quot; in\n&gt; Representational State Transfer is sufficiently broad so that a\n&gt; &quot;Representation&quot; is nothing more than the content return by an HTTP server\n&gt; at a specific moment in time.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.

Fielding&quot;\n&gt; &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Crikey, you guys are getting all mixed up.  REST is defined by\n&gt; &gt; my dissertation.  REST is not defined by the TAG discussion or\n&gt; &gt; the W3C&#39;s Webarch document or TimBL&#39;s design notes.  REST is an\n&gt; &gt; architectural style, not the Web architecture.  Please try\n&gt; &gt; to keep the terminology consistent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.\n&gt; &gt; REST merely requires that actions be applied to an identified resource,\n&gt; &gt; and that identification be in the form of a resource identifier (rather\n&gt; &gt; than, for example, a sequence of events).  Obviously, if you do not\n&gt; &gt; have an identifier for a given resource, then you cannot interact\n&gt; &gt; with it directly in REST, which means you can&#39;t do things like share\n&gt; &gt; that specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form\n&gt; &gt; of audit reference (you can&#39;t do that anyway -- you need all of the\n&gt; &gt; information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,\n&gt; &gt; method, authentication token, etc.).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,\n&gt; &gt; conversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect\n&gt; &gt; actions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are\n&gt; &gt; trade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued\n&gt; &gt; resource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more\n&gt; &gt; specific resource before further actions take place, but both are\n&gt; &gt; fully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be\n&gt; &gt; vague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly\n&gt; &gt; when a component has yet to determine the specific URI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ....Roy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
