On the other hand, if you&#39;re\n&gt;  &gt; running on a manager server, Rails and J2EE have a lot more\n&gt;  &gt; capabilities than PHP.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  I would be curious to know what the &quot;lot more capabilities&quot; are\n&gt;  that Rails and J2EE have over PHP. While I would agree that in many\n&gt;  circumstances Rails or J2EE might be a better choice, the whole idea of\n&gt;  REST (as oppossed to, say, WS-*) is that there are a small, well-defined\n&gt;  set of &quot;capabilites&quot; required to share in the full richness of what the\n&gt;  web has to offer. I have seen on more than one occassion a J2EE project\n&gt;  fail due to development overhead (design complexity, over-engineering,\n&gt;  etc.) only to have a well-thought-out PHP application save the day.\n\nLet me pick three (*), in no particular order:\n\n- If you choose GUI, Java has better tooling support for management,\ndebugging, troubleshooting, monitoring, etc.  PHP and Ruby do not come\nclose.  If you choose the command line, Ruby is the better contender.\nPHP ... what command line tools?\n\n(I&#39;m only referring here to tools that benefit from using the same\nlanguage as the application, e.g. database migration in Rails).\n\n- Love them or hate them, some of us do need to use SOAP services on\nthe back-end.  Java/.Net at a league ahead of Ruby/PHP.  But if you&#39;re\nusing SalesForce or Amazon Web Services, Ruby has some amazing\nlibraries to choose from.\n\n- If you have to mix languages, Ruby and Python play nicely with Java\nand .Net.  No such luck with PHP.\n\nAssaf\n\n(*) The hardest part is not finding them, but editing to just three.\n\n\n\n&gt;  I am not the world&#39;s hugest fan of PHP -- I prefer Perl myself and am\n&gt;  constantly amazed at the community surrounding Python (though I have\n&gt;  not yet had the pleasure of deploying a Python web application). I just\n&gt;  think that discussions of &quot;what&#39;s the best programming language for\n&gt;  web application development&quot; are quite often asking the wrong questions.\n&gt;  When debates about batch capabilities in the AtomPub discussions came\n&gt;  up, I was charmed by a Roy Fielding post where he mentioned that he&#39;d\n&gt;  likely reach for &quot;a shell script and curl&quot; when faced with the task of\n&gt;  posting 10,000 entries. It just got me thinking -- the language, to a\n&gt;  large extent, just doesn&#39;t matter. Do what&#39;s simple & practical.\n&gt;\n&gt;  --peter keane\n&gt;\n&gt;  [0] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/os-php-flexobj/\n&gt;  [1] http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg01117.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I wouldn&#39;t say one is more Web than the other.  And I wouldn&#39;t say\n&gt;  &gt; shared hosting is a better model for the Web.  They won&#39;t let you run\n&gt;  &gt; a Web crawler, scale to more than one server/database, etc.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; -- Assaf\n&gt;  &gt; http://labnotes.org\n&gt;\n\n"}}
