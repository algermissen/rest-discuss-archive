But then you can also ask why the spec says what is being  \nreturned at all.\n\nThe reason the spec says that an Atom feed is returned is that this  \ndesign time information is needed to code an AtomPub client.The  \nstaement cannot be removed from the spec. It is part of the semantics  \nof application/atomsrv+xml.\n\nAtomPub servers that do not respond with an Atom feed to a GET request  \nto a collection are breaking clients. And the hint about the other  \nHTTP codes is just informing the developer to handle it gracefully.  \nThe intended/expected coordination between client and server fails,  \nregardless of handling the 406 or running into an unhandled exception.  \nThe client cannot do what it was coded to do (coded to do based on [1]).\n\n\n[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-5.2\n\n\n&gt;  Don&#39;t forget that the response codes are part of the standard  \n&gt; interface and contract with the client.  While not specific to REST  \n&gt; (i.e. HTTP is one implementation) the concept of uniform interface  \n&gt; is.  I think that many people focus on the verbs (GET, PUT, POST,  \n&gt; DELETE) while very little attention is given to the plethora of  \n&gt; response codes.  Atompub definitely brought 201 Created up from  \n&gt; oblivion, but the others just as important.  If a bad request or a  \n&gt; state transition isn&#39;t understood, there is a proper response to it.\n\nYes. But the proper response isn&#39;t helping because the implied  \ncontract is broken anyhow.\n\nDo you think that an AtomPub server that is only capable of replying  \nto a GET on a collection with an image of the collection is a correct  \nimplementation of RFC 5023?\n\nShould a test tool report an error for such a service because [1] is  \nnot correctly implemented?\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Noah\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Dec 21, 2009 at 12:48 AM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@... \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 21, 2009, at 8:54 AM, Eric J.

That allows for a resource to have more than just an Atom\n&gt; &gt; representation.  Reading between the lines and remembering that a\n&gt; &gt; request is made up of more than just its URI and method, it also\n&gt; &gt; effectively says that a GET request with an Accept header consisting\n&gt; &gt; only of &#39;application/atom+xml&#39; MUST return &#39;application/atom+xml&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; issue a 406 error.\n&gt;\n&gt; But this means that it is ok for the server to break it&#39;s own promise:\n&gt; AtomPub says a feed will be available.
