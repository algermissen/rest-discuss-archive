But I w=\r\nould\n&gt; note that the uses of cookies he describes there are *not* the same =\r\nas\n&gt; the uses described in the cited thread.\n\nRoy Fielding wrote (in\n&lt;http:=\r\n//www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_3_4_2&gt;):=\r\n\n\n&quot;Cookies also violate REST because they allow data to be passed without\ns=\r\nufficiently identifying its semantics, thus becoming a concern for both\nsec=\r\nurity and privacy.&quot;\n\nIn other words, cookies violate the constraint of self=\r\n-descriptive\nmessages. I tend to think that cookies are well defined as ref=\r\nerences to\nsession state kept on origin servers and so violate only the con=\r\nstraint\nof statelessness. I accounted for the possibility that cookies have=\r\n no\nsolid definition, writing that cookies would, in that case, violate the=\r\n\nconstraint of self-descriptive messages. Roy Fielding seems to posit\nthat =\r\ncookies violate both constraints (to get my drift, one has to read\nmore of =\r\nthe cited section of the dissertation than the sentence that I\nquoted).\n\nNo=\r\nw that I think more on the subject, I admit that I failed to account\nfor a =\r\nfourth possibility: cookies could have a solid definition as\nsomething othe=\r\nr than references to session state kept on origin servers.\nI think that thi=\r\ns is not the case, but I&#39;m game to read arguments to the\ncontrary.\n\n-- \nPle=\r\nase do not reply to me when replying to rest-discuss.
