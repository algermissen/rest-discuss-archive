From my understanding of\n&gt;&gt; these fields, the client is effectively telling the server how to act.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m somewhat inclined to agree with some of this;  If-Mod* and If-Unmod*\nare\n&gt; probably okay because they are describing what they  want in terms\n&gt; independent of some representation, but the rest presuppose some\nparticular\n&gt; representation.\n\nI have to disagree with this.  Those headers are only cache control hints.\nThey specify ETag values that are compared against the ETag values that had\nbeen supplied by the server to represent a version of whatever underlying\nentity is referenced by the URL.  They aren&#39;t referencing any underlying\ndata in the reponse body (i.e., representation) itself, so the don&#39;t\npresuppose any representation.\n\nAlso, the response may be handled by a caching proxy without ever hitting\nthe server itself.\n\n\n\n"}}
