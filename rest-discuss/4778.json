Because neither the x or the y \n&gt; coordinate is subordinate to the other it seems this information \n&gt; should be passed in the query string rather than the URI part, for \n&gt; example:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /location?x=110022&y=220033\n\nThere is nothing wrong with /location/110022/220033 (this hints that there\nis a &quot;parent&quot; resource at /location/110022 but doesn&#39;t guarantee it - URIs\nare opaque to everything except those processes that know how they are built\nin a given application, which ideally means only the server [or only the\nserver and only the client in a limited set of cases]) or\n/location/110022_22033\n\n&gt; Then maybe for uniformity I should change the first URI so it also \n&gt; passes the identifier in the query string:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /location?id=12345\n\nQuery strings are best avoided, but not a big bad. (Most of the reasons for\navoiding query strings aren&#39;t really valid, but a matter of assumptions made\nelsewhere by others making query strings somewhat disadvantaged).\n\n&gt; I also want to track who&#39;s requesting the resource for billing \n&gt; purposes so my options would seem to be:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /location/12345?customerId=6789\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /location/?id=12345&customerId=6789\n&gt; \n&gt; In either case I&#39;m not sure if I like the mixing of metadata, who \n&gt; requested the resource, with the query data.\n\nThis is valid only in the case of something like &quot;the location that client\n6789 put into her list of &#39;favourite locations&#39;&quot; or such, and even then:\n\nA. Only really useful if it makes sense to let other customers see that list\n(sometimes it does, c.f. wishlists, often it doesn&#39;t).\nB. Ideally it would redirect from there to a URI that would return the\nresource in isolation from the details of specific customers.\n\nTracking who is actually using the application should be done through other\nmeans, RFC 2617 authentication gives one way even cookies have something in\ntheir favour over user identification in URIs (that should in no way be read\nas my justifying the use of cookies, they suck big time but userids in URIs\nsuck more).\n\nRegards,\nJon Hanna\nWork: &lt;http://www.selkieweb.com/&gt;\nPlay: &lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\nChat: &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/selkie&gt; \n\n\n"}}
