Not simply for GETs, but\n&gt; for pushing data as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; But another place that would be valuable is the fact that most any HTTP\n&gt; result can have a typed body. So it&#39;s easy to envision when you get some\n&gt; warning, or other error message (perhaps a redirect), that you can \n&gt; leverage\n&gt; the ability to send more interesting data than what is simply in the\n&gt; headers, and have that data marshaled for you automagically.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the LINK infrastructure should be aware of things like redirects,\n&gt; and expose those things. If you hit a URI that gets a permanent or \n&gt; temporary\n&gt; redirect, it would be nice for the client to honor that at least somewhat\n&gt; transparently. And by that I don&#39;t me silently following the redirect, but \n&gt; I\n&gt; mean if it sees you hitting it again, will simply jump straight to the \n&gt; final\n&gt; destination.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the trivial case, I don&#39;t see a reason why you should be having to set\n&gt; the Accept header -- framework should do that for you. It should set the\n&gt; content type on the way out properly, and set the accept header as well,\n&gt; since it &quot;knows&quot; you want the Movie info.\n&gt;\n&gt; The common headers should be First Class. I shouldn&#39;t have to set an\n&gt; &quot;If-Modified&quot; myself, I should be able to link.setIfModifiedSince(myDate),\n&gt; so I don&#39;t have to marshal the dates myself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Going back to the mime mapping, that should be controllable at a higher,\n&gt; &quot;global&quot;/framework level, but also at the request level. I can easily see\n&gt; having to map &quot;text/xml&quot; to something different at the request level\n&gt; depending on the link.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, anyway, just some quick thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
