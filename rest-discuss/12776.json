Bes=\r\nt if that out-of-band or prior knowledge is captured in or referenced from =\r\na well-known media type. If it&#39;s a really rich media type, if the processin=\r\ng model described by the type tells you what kinds of verbs, headers, statu=\r\ns codes, and representation formats help you manipulate resources by way of=\r\n that media type, an attributed link may be all you need to offer up to the=\r\n client. Alternatively, the service can offer up a form that helps guide th=\r\ne client to supplying the necessary representation to progress its goals. T=\r\nhat form would be attributed with something like a rel tag, so the client a=\r\ngain understands what part submitting this form has to play in the applicat=\r\nion protocol. In addition, the form fields might also be attributed to furt=\r\nher aid in the semantic comprehension of the form. All those annotations mu=\r\nst of necessity be understood by the client - there&#39;s no magic.\n\n--- In res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sebastien Lambla&quot; &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I do lik=\r\ne Ian Robinson&#39;s categorization of &quot;hypermedia controls&quot;, aka links\n&gt; and f=\r\norms.
