A client interacts\nwith a service and in so doing the service may create new resources.\nThey may be short or long-lived. Is there, in general, a requirement to\nreify this as a &quot;session&quot;? Opinions requested.\n\nOne reason that I resist this is because I would like for it to be\npossible to construct a single logical client from many different &quot;HTTP\nclients&quot;. i.e. for me to dispatch part of the job to a totally different\nsoftware component merely by sending it a URI. &quot;Tax form verification\ncode service, please check my tax form before I send it. It is at\nhttp:///&quot;. This gets much more complicated if the client and server have\na shared, implicit notion of where we are in the multi-step process.\n\nOne way it would help deal with the issues discussed on that c2.com wiki\nis by spreading out the state among multiple resources so that you might\nnot need to load balance any particular resource. As the &quot;state&quot; is\nspread among different URIs, each new step in the process can switch\nmachines if necessary. Still, the steps will often need to share\ninformation so you still need to push this back to the database and that\nwill still be somewhat expensive.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
