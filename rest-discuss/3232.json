To me the first one is ReSTful, the\n&gt; second one isn&#39;t, but Mike obviously has been thinking about ReST \n&gt; longer\n&gt; than I have... so I accept that I&#39;m probably missing something.\n\nMaybe I am missing something, but since several people have said that\nREST implies opaqueness in the URI, my guess is that a legend\nhas somehow begun and I need to put it to rest (no pun intended).\n\nREST does not require that a URI be opaque.  The only place where\nthe word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I complain about the\nopaqueness of cookies.  In fact, RESTful applications are, at all times,\nencouraged to use human-meaningful, hierarchical identifiers in order\nto maximize the serendipitous use of the information beyond what is\nanticipated by the original application.\n\nIt is still necessary for the server to construct the URIs and for the\nclient to initially discover those URIs via hypertext responses, either\nin the normal course of creating the resource or by some form of query\nthat results in a hypertext list.  However, once that list is provided,\npeople can and do anticipate the names of other/future resources in\nthat name space, just as I would often directly type URIs into the\nlocation bar rather than go through some poorly designed interactive\nmulti-page interface for stock charts.\n\nSites that rely on interstitial advertising (like the annoying yahoo\ngroups interface) do not like it when user&#39;s avoid the indirect path,\nbut the social network-effect of the Web is enhanced by meaningful URI.\nIn general, sites that give meaningful URI are used more often.\n\nIt also helps prevent the &quot;lost in hyperspace&quot; syndrome, but that&#39;s\na separate issue.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
