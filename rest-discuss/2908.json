There&#39;s the\nleast variability in what that means, and the greatest wealth of\ntoolkits to choose from that factor out most of the gritty details for\nyou.  By and large REST interfaces don&#39;t tell you how to serialize and\ndeserialize complex structures, so you kind of start from scratch every\ntime. If they use a SOAP encoding, you get some of that. But there just\nis nothing simpler than saying &quot;Here&#39;s the XML-RPC interface, and some\nsample code in a few of the popular scripting languages.&quot;\n&quot;\n\ni see holes in just about every sentence of this but i wonder is it just\nme; i have nothing good to say about it so i&#39;ll shut up.\n\n\n"}}
