Various software and other websites\nincorrectly requesting stuff that used to exist or\nstuff that NEVER existed on my web server.\n\nI think it is part of life when you expose a\npublic web server.\n\nSince the client can request a secret URL, the\nnotifier would be getting a 404 and would then\nstop sending.  If it keeps sending it is just\nbehaving badly.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s why I wanted headers that would make the message\n&gt; self describing. You would just click (literally or metaphorically) on\n&gt; the &quot;unsubscribe URI&quot; and the messages would stop arriving....\n\nAs you noted before.  Unless the notification URL\nsays to continue, notification stops.  So this\nisn&#39;t an issue.\n\n&gt; Still undecided what&#39;s most important. Maybe it is an issue for\n&gt; negotiation: a Verbose: header which defaults to True. Yeah, I kind of\n&gt; like that idea.\n\nYou are making the spec too complex.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
