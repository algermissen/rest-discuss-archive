I have been \nlooking very seriously at REST (as some of you know from previous \nposts) and think that REST could handle all of the required business \nprotocols.\n\nWhile I think the IBM will probably do something to remove the cloud \nover ebXML, the fact remains that everything they said they \ncontributed and now claim patents over can be done in other ways, \nthat is, REST.\n\nI am not a lawyer, but my guess is that using REST would have a \npretty good chance of avoiding the patent claims.  People who are \nlawyers are examining the claims as we speak, and I&#39;ll post more \ndetails as they become available (assuming there is interest).\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
