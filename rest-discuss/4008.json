And the answer is the communication\ncontext in which the URL was delivered.\n\nRoy&#39;s paper is relatively silent on this communication context other than\nto say that it is supplied by the world wide web.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to collapse this division and view URLs in terms of a\nset of commitments other parties make about the content available at a\nresource and their abilities to uphold those commitments.  I prefer to\nthink of content located by a URLs as being the result of some party&#39;s PUT,\nPOST, or DELETE and avoid the trap into which many REST oriented developers\nfall of exposing hidden representations\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

Could you make that more explicit,\n&gt;&gt; maybe with reference to specific words Roy used?\n&gt;\n&gt; What I mean is if REST goes beyond the technical aspects of distributed\n&gt; systems?\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;How do you think about abstract concepts like &quot;3&quot;?  Do you think of\n&gt; it symbolically (the glyph) or numerically?  If you need to explain\n&gt; to someone the algorithm for calculating the area of a circle, how\n&gt; do you do that?  Those are all representations.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If REST is only about the technical aspects (e.g. how messages are\n&gt; transferred, how interfaces are contrained) then what Roy writes is\n&gt; IMHO outside the scope of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Put in another way: in what sense is what Roy writes relevant for\n&gt; an architectural style for distributed systems?\n&gt;\n&gt; To mw, what Roy says, are aspects of a possible application of REST\n&gt; but not REST itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, what am I missing?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Walden\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\n&gt; Consultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
