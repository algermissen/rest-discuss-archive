I think it&#39;s time to do some serious work to\n&gt; improve the operational semantics, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think a lot can be done to add semantic value to existing media\n&gt; types just by adding LINKS w/ rel values. No matter the media-type\n&gt; (XHTML, XML, Atom, etc.) a custom client that has access to clearly\n&gt; documented LINK+rel values can understand and process quite a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Taking an approach that uses the XHTML LINK element + rel values may\n&gt; be a viable way to increase the semantic value of these common types\n&gt; w/o destroying the original meaning and value for Web browsers and\n&gt; other existing clients.\n\nBut then aren&#39;t we going backwards here?\n\nFirst, let me be clear, my primary interest and slant on this in the\nMtoM space of code talking to code, and the only time any reads this\nstuff is if they&#39;re debugging it.\n\nBut basically, now the media type doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.\nEmbedded RDF, HTML Link Rel tags, whatever. I can&#39;t tell anything\nwhatsoever from the media type now. Media type may as well be\napplication/octet-stream. Because in order to get any value out of it,\nI now need to introspect the payloads to see what&#39;s what, and whether\nit&#39;s useful to me at all.\n\nI can try con neg, but it may well simply give three different kinds\nof XHTML. Not helpful at all.\n\nIf we&#39;re going to get rid of the mime type, then I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all\nsorts of wonderful things that can be crammed in the payload that\naffect semantics and behavior, but I think that&#39;s been done already.\n\nNow, as part of, perhaps, the Semantic Web, which is effectively\ntrying to automate and make discoverable the Human consumed web. Fine.\nThere you&#39;re pretty much stuck with piggy backing on top of HTML to\nget any thing with any traction (since sending XSLT links with XML\nprobably won&#39;t really take off...).\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
