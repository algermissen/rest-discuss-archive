Those things might be \nnamed places/regions (towns, suburbs, administrative regions), roads, \nroad segments, or physical devices. The goal is to obtain a list of \nresources that match a set of search criteria.\n\nI think I know what I&#39;m doing when it comes to giving each &quot;thing&quot; \nresource a unique URI. What I&#39;m having trouble with is the RESTfullness \nof the application that lets me find sets of these resources from their \nparent collections. My confusion is related to whether each resource \ntype should have its own collection resource, or whether one end point \ncan handle all resource types.\n\nWhen searching for the resources that represent the &quot;thing&quot; I&#39;m trying \nto locate there are two selection methods:\n\n1. Name, or partial name match.\n2. Geographic bounding box (minX, minY, maxX, maxY)\n\nAs an example, say I need to find towns and one particular type of device.\n\nShould I use a generic locator:\n\nGET /location?type=town&state=TAS&name=nowhere\nGET /location?type=device&minX=140&minY=-34&maxX=154&maxY=-20\n\nof should I have use something like:\n\nGET /town?state=TAS&name=nowhere\nGET /device?minX=140&minY=-34&maxX=154&maxY=-20\n\nIf I use the second approach, should the resource representing the \ncollection of towns and devices actually be named &quot;/towns&quot; and &quot;/devices&quot;?\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\n-- \nRegards\nAndrew Hallam\n\nDigital Earth Pty Ltd\nhttp://www.digitalearth.com.au\n\n\n\n\n"}}
