The\n&gt; former seeks to minimize the number of cool (long lived) URLs and the\n&gt; latter practice seeks to maximize them. Put another way, proponents of\n&gt; server-generated ephemeral URLs appear to believe that long-lived URLs\n&gt; are not cool because they create long-lived dependencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; So which is the better design -- a hypermedia application rich in long\n&gt; lived URLs or a hypermedia application poor in long lived URLs, just a\n&gt; few &quot;bootstrap&quot; URLs? Up til now I always assumed the former, but now\n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure. Again this reminds me a bit of the deep-linking\n&gt; debate, eg a building with many doors vs a building with few doors.\n\nThat reminds me, I meant to get back to your earlier question to me\nabout deep linking.  In the approach I was talking about, deep linking\nisn&#39;t an issue, because either way, the service should give you an\n&quot;out&quot;, i.e. a navigable state transition URI regardless of whether it\ngives you the page you expected or not.  As long as you &quot;bookmarked&quot; or\notherwise saved a URI that was given to you from the service, it follows\nwhat I was trying to specify via my definition of hypermedia.\n\nI hadn&#39;t thought about the cache header point that Mark made earlier,\nbut I like the idea of using it as a hint.  Even if you tried to\ndereference it after it expires, the service will hopefully give you a\nnavigable resource instead--even if it&#39;s an error page with a pointer to\nthe &quot;front door&quot;.\n\nPersonally, I think that if you&#39;re only using the URIs presented to you\nfrom the server (or the &#39;friendly&#39; ones printed on the side of a bus\nwhich are bound to be *a* &#39;front door&#39; if not *the* &#39;front door&#39;), then\nyou can bookmark any URI you like.  My issue is with URI generation or\n&quot;guessing&quot; in the case of automated agents; it&#39;s less about the TTL of\nthe particular URI.  However, the TTL is more relevant if you&#39;re going\nto use template-based approaches and you don&#39;t want your system to break\nin the face of changes in the service.\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S.
