The notion that mailing\nthe URL of a WSJ article means something different\nfrom mailing the URL of a bank savings register is\na little odd.\n\nUsing HTTP-auth for customization is abusive.\nNow, I can define all sorts of resources\nparametrized by username password.\n\nRather than adding a id=thingid to the query\nstring.  In the future, I can simply pass thingid\nin the username...\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
