The obvious and cleanes=\r\nt\n&gt; approach seems to be to accept absolute URIs to the other resources as\n=\r\n&gt; exposed by the API. The only disadvantage I can see is that it&#39;s more\n&gt; v=\r\nerbose than accepting ids to the referenced resources, but this is\n&gt; partia=\r\nlly offset by avoiding the need to return raw ids in\n&gt; representations in t=\r\nhe first place. Does this seem a reasonable\n&gt; approach? I&#39;m only wondering =\r\nas it doesn&#39;t seem that common.\n\nIt should be more common, as this is exact=\r\nly how one implements the\nhypertext constraint [1]. Clients should be given=\r\n links, not construct\nthem.\n\nKeep in mind also that, as long as your media =\r\ntype makes it clear what\nis a URI and what isn&#39;t, you can use relative URI&#39;=\r\ns instead of absolute\nones, which quite often means only a few extra bytes =\r\nper datum. But\nthen, of course, you generally won&#39;t worry about &quot;extra byte=\r\ns&quot; because\nyou&#39;re not relying on small message size for performance; instea=\r\nd,\nyou&#39;re relying on caching, which counter-intutitively does better with\n*=\r\nlarger* messages, not smaller ones. Using relative URI&#39;s is then simply\nest=\r\nhetics for humans.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n[1]\nhttp://roy.gbiv=\r\n.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n\n"}}
