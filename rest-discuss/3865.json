Alex&#39;s arguments\n&gt; about MoST being different from REST seem to be comparing MoST\n&gt; constraints to the absence of constraints in REST, not to\n&gt; expressed constraints in REST.\n\nYes.  That is correct.\n\n&gt; I think the main impetus for MoST is the desire to have a more\n&gt; constrained model for representations than just &quot;a representation\n&gt; of a resource at time t&quot;. The web-calculus uses a more narrowly\n&gt; defined model and defines its generic interface in terms of this\n&gt; model. I suspect the web-calculus satisfies the desires expressed\n&gt; in this thread about MoST.\n\nI took a look at the web calculus and I think it addresses an orthogonal \nproblem.\n\nMoST views HTTP as a blackboard communication interface for agents both on \nthe server and across the Internet (See my response to Seairth) and just \nseeks to standardize the blackboard interface (not the interface to the \nagents themselves!).\n\nIf I am understanding the documentation I saw, the &quot;web calculus&quot; attempts \nto model how all of these agents across the Internet react to changes in \nwhat is on the blackboard.  That&#39;s a *very ambitious* enterprise and \ngeneralizes way beyond HTTP.  I am not in a position to judge the efficacy \nof your model, but, if it works, calling it simply a &quot;web calculus&quot; strikes \nme as *extremely* modest.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
