Transactions over HTTP should be optional,\n&gt; discoverable, negotiable, based on optimistic commits, and (in the\n&gt; case of failures) use compenstating requests as a way to reverse\n&gt; previous work.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\nCompensation often does not work.  Think of an offer to buy.  If it&#39;s\noptimistically committed, both buyer and seller may take followup\nactions that could be difficult or impossible to undo (e.g. starting\nproduction) if the offer is cancelled.  Alternatively, both parties\nmay need to wait for some undeterminate timespan to make sure a\ncompensating request does not arrive.\n\nA better alternative in many situations, which I&#39;ve described on this\nlist before, is to use a provisional-final pattern, where the initial\nrequest is provisional, and then both parties agree that it should be\nmade final or cancelled.  All these interactions can be done\nRESTfully.\n\nAn example in regular business practice is a request for quotation\n(provisional) followed by an order (final).\n\nYou may think that is not a transaction, but it follows a 2-phase\ncommit pattern, altho it does not obey all the ACID rules (which are\nimpossible to follow RESTfully).\n\n"}}
