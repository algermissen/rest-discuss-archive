The \nlevel of question you have is more on the level of business logic.  That \nis, /car?make=ferrari and /cars?make=ferrari are both absolutely fine.\n\nAbout verbs, it is not necessary for all resources to support all verbs. \nI usually do something like:\n\nswitch($method){\ncase HEAD:\ncase GET:\n    // print something and do a 200 return\n   emit();\n   break;\n\ncase POST:\n    // handle form input\n    process();\n    emit();\n    break;\n\ndefault:\n    // do a &quot;method not supported&quot; unless you are using DELETE, PUT, or TRACE.\n}\n\n\nt, what you&#39;ll find as you get into the RESTful way of doing things \nis that the choice of which verbs to implement, and what exactly that \nmeans, gives you a pretty large vocabulary to work with.\n\nOn Wed, 19 Jul 2006, Jonas Bengtsson wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m just getting into this REST thing so please have some patience\n&gt; with my newbie level questions :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Say that I want to get a set of cars. It seems wrong to use the same\n&gt; &quot;base&quot; URI as when I get one car, i.e.:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /car/1  &lt;-- get car with id 1\n&gt; GET /car  &lt;-- get all cars\n&gt; GET /car?make=ferrari  &lt;-- get all ferraris\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like it&#39;s better to create a new resource, like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /cars &lt;-- get all cars\n&gt; GET /cars?make=ferrari &lt;-- get all ferraris\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that a better way to structure the resources? How do you normally\n&gt; do actions like searching?\n&gt;\n&gt; In either case, the /car/ or /cars/ won&#39;t support the POST(?), PUT,\n&gt; DELETE verbs. Should all resources support all verbs to follow the\n&gt; REST style?
