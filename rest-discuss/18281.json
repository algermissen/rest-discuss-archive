It is the examples that are wrong. Media types should not describe \nobjects like &quot;sales order&quot; or &quot;bill&quot;. They should be more general like \n&quot;e-procurement&quot;. The fact that its a sales order can be derived from the \nrel-type (as argued earlier on).\n\nSo my previous little step-be-step list becomes:\n\n1) The client follows a link-rel &quot;this-is-the-sales-order&quot; and assumes it \nwill get, well, a sales order - in some yet unknown format.\n\n2) The client does not need to specify &quot;I want a sales order&quot; in the accept \nheader (it does so by the URL it has selected).\n\n3) The client must specify its capabilities (or the context in which it will \nprocess the sales order). So it sends Accept: application/e-procurement+xml \n(not application/salesorder+xml).\n\n4) The server replies with a sales order and content-type \napplication/e-procurement+xml.\n\n5) The client knows that a sales order in the context of \napplication/e-procurement+xml should be decoded in a certain way and does \nso.\n\nRepeat step 1-5 with &quot;sales order&quot; replaced with \n&quot;bill/quote/reservation/etc&quot; - but do not change the media type.\n\nBetter now?\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;J�rn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jan Algermissen&quot; &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;REST Discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, December 31, 2011 1:10 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: The &quot;new media types are evil&quot; meme\n\n\n&gt; Jan, I am quite sure I understand what you are saying :-) You could even\n&gt; argue against me, saying that, well, Jorn, since you have decided to \n&gt; inspect\n&gt; the payload before acting on the response (checking the XML, right) - then\n&gt; you might as well drop the concept of a media type completely and always\n&gt; depend on data-inspection. Something that certainly won&#39;t work!\n&gt;\n&gt; I totally agree that switching on domain specific information / \n&gt; capabilities\n&gt; in the media type feels intuitive, makes life easier, and makes HTTP work\n&gt; with you instead of against you. But I am having a seriously hard time\n&gt; deciding on whether or not to do it - what do I gain and, more \n&gt; interesting,\n&gt; what do I loose?\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if we mint new media types - when and for what purpose should we do\n&gt; that? Lets talk about e-procurement again. In this domain we have orders \n&gt; and\n&gt; bills. What media types should we have?\n&gt;\n&gt; Should we have only one media type (like Webber&#39;s\n&gt; application/vnd.restbucks+xml in\n&gt; http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/):\n&gt;\n&gt;  application/e-procurement+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; or many media types:\n&gt;\n&gt;  application/e-procurement.order+xml\n&gt;  application/e-procurement.bill+xml\n&gt;  application/e-procurement.person+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; As we extend the application we are probably going to need stuff like\n&gt; inventory, reservation, bank account, money transfer and so on. If each of\n&gt; these are going to get their own media type then we end up with the known\n&gt; &quot;over proliferation of media types&quot; as opposed to sticking to a few well\n&gt; known media formats.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, to argue against my previous post - this is an e-procurement REST \n&gt; API -\n&gt; meaning &quot;this is one specific instance of the REST architecture&quot;. It \n&gt; happens\n&gt; to work with HTTP which has many more media types, but for this specific\n&gt; REST instance (e-procurement) we actually don&#39;t have that many media \n&gt; types.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this is a valid interpretation of REST as an achitecture, and\n&gt; e-procurement as an instance of it, then the &quot;over proliferation of media\n&gt; types&quot; is a non-problem - there won&#39;t be that many media types per API /\n&gt; instance of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do I sound scizophrenic? Probably. I feel so. Like running around in\n&gt; circles. Need sleep ...\n&gt;\n&gt; /J�rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
