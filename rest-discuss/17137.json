It&#39;s described by an XML\n&gt; schema and \n&gt; it seems to me that my client must have this schema baked into the\n&gt; code in \n&gt; order to work with it - how would it otherwise know how to mark-up the\n&gt; data \n&gt; needed to describe, for instance, a purchase order? This is where my \n&gt; understanding of a dynamic client breaks down. The client may have\n&gt; multiple \n&gt; known schemas to choose between - for instance Danish and German\n&gt; variations \n&gt; of purchase order schemas. But that&#39;s only semi-dynamic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy xmass everybody :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; /Jørn\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 23, 2010 8:01 PM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Re: XForms vs. WSDL?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi again.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jørn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yes, that&#39;s certainly one important difference. With SOAP/WSDL you\n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; everything up front and have to figure out what to use when. With\n&gt; REST you\n&gt; &gt; are only served the links that fits the actual state. You cannot do\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; last\n&gt; &gt; with WSDL.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, yes, you can. At least with WSDL (let&#39;s forget SOAP). WSDL is a\n&gt; web \n&gt; format, registered in IANA, and I can get it dynamically and consume\n&gt; it \n&gt; dynamically. Nobody does it because of tools, granted. The shame is on\n&gt; the \n&gt; tool designers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess that depends on how you consume the XForm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Totally true. Knowing the XFORM up front will make you write a rigid\n&gt; client. \n&gt; Same for WSDL. Consuming the XFORM dynamically will make everybody\n&gt; happy. It \n&gt; is harder with WSDL, but possible too.\n&gt; Here the real difference is then the actual implementation, plus, I\n&gt; would \n&gt; say, XFORM is still light, and WSDL we may label it as &quot;heavy&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
