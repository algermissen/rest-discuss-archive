The only types that\n=\r\nare significant to a client are the current representation=92s media\ntype a=\r\nnd standardized relation names.&quot;\n\nA typed resource (as this DTO provides to=\r\n your client) implies in\ntighter coupling between both sides, the opposite =\r\ndirection of freedom\nthat you want.\n\n\n\n&gt; Yes, true.. but if you combine the=\r\n two models into one, while possible, you are requiring your front tier to =\r\nknow about ejb/back end stuff. An even better example of why you would avoi=\r\nd this.. if you were going to use those same XSD generated JAXB classes in =\r\na Jersey client (or java client).. and you have the ejb entity annotations =\r\nin them as well, your client side now has to have the ejb classes to compil=\r\ne.\n\nYou are right.. that&#39;s why you should not do that. But that is not\nwhat=\r\n I meant, I probably did not leave it clear enough. Session beans\nimplies t=\r\night coupling by nature: it requires your clients to know and\nshare the sam=\r\ne interface that your server knows, the opposite\ndirection that REST goes, =\r\ninstead of relation names and media types,\nyou are using java interfaces an=\r\nd classes. Taking out session beans\nand adding rest in its place:\n\n   (dto)=\r\n      dto                 s-bean                 e-bean\nCLIENT ---&gt;  WEB TI=\r\nER --&gt; APP TIER --&gt; DB TIER\n\nbecomes:\n\n  (independent model)        resourc=\r\ne from here on...\nCLIENT --&gt;                        WEB TIER --&gt;\n       APP=\r\n TIER --&gt; DB TIER\n\nWhat I meant is that it should be your frameworks&#39; respo=\r\nnsability to\nmap the resource representation to your model... while it does=\r\n not, so\none requires dtos, going back to non-restful architectures.\n\nDTOs =\r\nare also typically anemic, and because Java classes are closed\n(unlike ruby=\r\n ones), the client will have to live with an anemic DTO\nrepresentation of h=\r\nis resource.\n\nThat&#39;s why I believe DTO and REST should not be together...\n\n=\r\nRegards\n\nGuilherme Silveira\nCaelum | Ensino e Inova=E7=E3o\nhttp://www.caelu=\r\nm.com.br/\n\n"}}
