Following links can only provide information to a\n&gt; &gt; client that would then change its own state. Each client could end in\n&gt; &gt; different states even though the hypermedia and resource\n&gt; &gt; representations\n&gt; &gt; were exactly the same for each.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we&#39;re splitting hairs, then one bit difference constitutes clients\n&gt; in different states.  But do you feel that two clients as described\n&gt; above could be in *significantly* different states having done the same\n&gt; GET and received the same representation?  I think not.  It does seem\n&gt; to depend, though, on what the client is caching along the way...Is\n&gt; that your point?\n\nNo - I was thinking that one client was a text indexer (like a search\nengine) and another was a visual browser. They both receive the same\ncontent, but one just extracts words and associates them with the URI. The\nother shows some UI and stuff.\n\nI still don&#39;t get the &#39;state machine&#39; viewpoint. Not a big deal.\n\n\n"}}
