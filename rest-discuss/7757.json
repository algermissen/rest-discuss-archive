So far as I can\ntell, the spec does not forbid POSTing onto a missing resource. So I\nhave remodelled the flow to show two paths, where one permits and the\nother prevents POSTing to missing resources.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If it doesn&#39;t exist, how can you POST into it. 404 or 410 IMO.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which incidentally is another condition to put on that. Hence, if anyone\n&gt; on screen readers, HTMLifying clients or similar will forgive my ASCII-art.\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT? -&gt;true -&gt; (same as previous)\n&gt; |\n&gt; |false\n&gt; |\n&gt; KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED PREVIOUSLY -&gt; true -&gt; 410 Gone\n&gt; |\n&gt; |false\n&gt; |\n&gt; 404 File Not Found\n&gt;\n\nGood feedback - have added 410 Gone.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d also add that some statuses can be calculated before all of this\n&gt; (e.g. we can sometimes say that /1/2/3 would map to something that would\n&gt; return a 403 before we even work out exactly what that something is and\n&gt; whether it exists or not).\n\nFor more completeness, I have added the resolution of status codes\nprior to testing for the existence of a resource.\n\nThere is a new version of the activity diagram uploaded. The changes\nare extensive.\n\nFor a list of all representations and a version history, see\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/who/alan-dean/image/http-headers-status\n\nI&#39;m finding this a very useful process - thanks for the feedback everyone :-)\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
