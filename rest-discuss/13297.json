I was wrong.  I should have at least \nwarned Roy.  I don&#39;t think he would have given any blessing though.\n\n&gt;&gt; Choosing to\n&gt;&gt; have JBoss lead and own such an effort in a JCP-style way doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; inspire me good things either.\n&gt;&gt;\n\nWe want to define middleware services.  I think we&#39;re as good as anybody \nin developing middleware.  We have a huge user base to tap for a \nfeedback loop.  We have large customers willing to work with us to help \ndevelop their RESTful applications.\n\nOur efforts in organizations like the JCP have been to make their \nprocesses more open, to bring popular user-driven technology to JCP \nspecifications, and to fix technical problems within specifications.\n\n&gt; My suggestion would be to move this off the JBoss domain, change the  \n&gt; name, and invite the community to define (or rewrite) the charter -  \n&gt; i.e. turn this into a best practices site that might spawn  \n&gt; standardization HTTP-related efforts at e.g. IETF (where they belong).\n&gt; \n\nDo to technical issues rest-star.org is a redirect to jboss.org.  It has \nto do with the web authoring tools the graphic arts guys were using. \nThe intention all along was to have it separate from Red Hat.  It didn&#39;t \nmake a lot of sense to do this work under something like the RESTEasy \nJava project as we wanted it to be more than something consumable by \nJava developers.\n\nAlso I think on the website we stated that we were totally open to \nchanging the charter.  Maybe we shouldn&#39;t even of had a charter to begin \nwith.\n\nGiven the feedback here though, we may relaunch it as an open source \nspecification effort instead of a &quot;official&quot; standards body.  And then \nbring each individual thing to the W3C or IETF.\n\n&gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t mean that proposing RESTful APIs for such problems isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; useful or necessary. As you know, there are already existing efforts  \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; those areas and having more attempts at this stage sounds useful. For\n&gt;&gt; example, Google recently announced its PubSubHubbub effort:\n&gt;&gt; http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then, let the most popular media types (such as Atom) or RESTful APIs\n&gt;&gt; (such as Amazon S3) win and be leveraged by developers and supported  \n&gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; tools. Just don&#39;t lead people into thinking that there is or even need\n&gt;&gt; to be a consensus in the REST community on how to define such RESTful\n&gt;&gt; APIs, especially when you haven&#39;t even consulted it with your plans.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My suggestion is that Roy quickly starts and leads an official REST\n&gt;&gt; project, maybe at the W3C or at IETF where important things engaging  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; REST community could be organized and decided. I&#39;m afraid otherwise  \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; such a wonderful adventure will get side-tracked or harmed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Here I have to disagree - I don&#39;t have any idea what an &quot;official REST  \n&gt; project&quot; might be doing.\n&gt; \n\nI think we were pretty clear on rest-star.org that we weren&#39;t an \n&quot;official REST project&quot; or trying to define the meaning of REST or be \n&quot;official REST&quot;.  From the website:\n\n&quot;REST-* is an organization dedicated to bringing the architecture of the \nWeb to common patterns in middleware technology&quot;.\n\nThe name REST-* was, on purpose, supposed to convey images of WS-*. \nOther than being tonque-and-cheek, and ignoring the negative \nconnotations of WS-*, WS-* generally equates to defining middleware:\n\n&quot;The REST-* community aims to introduce new REST-based standards for \nthese traditional services&quot;\n\nThe key word was *traditional*.   What I think I should have said was:\n\n&quot;The REST-* community aims to morph these traditional services into a \nmore RESTful approach through a set of open specifications.&quot;\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
