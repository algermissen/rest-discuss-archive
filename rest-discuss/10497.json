A sub-constraint of the\n&gt;  &gt; uniform interface constraint is the Hypermedia (... as the engine of\n&gt;  &gt; application state) constraint which I&#39;ve never seen used in any\n&gt;  &gt; self-described Grid based system. So no, probably not.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hello Mark Baker:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m one of the authors of a self-described grid filesystem --\n&gt;  allmydata.org &quot;Tahoe&quot;, a.k.a. the Least AUthority Grid FileSystem --\n&gt;  and we&#39;ve tried to make our API RESTful, but we&#39;re not sure if we got\n&gt;  it just right:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/browser/docs/webapi.txt\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m not sure about the sub-constraint that you mention above.\n&gt;  Identifiers in the allmydata.org system can be used as hyperlinks in\n&gt;  documented stored in the grid, so what I think that the constraint\n&gt;  means is that if you build an app on the allmydata.org grid\n&gt;  filesystem, and you expose documents to your users which contain\n&gt;  hyperlinks back into the grid, then you are obeying this sub-\n&gt;  constraint, but if you build an app that hides such links from the\n&gt;  user, then you aren&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Am I close?\n\nHey Zooko, long time.\n\nThat&#39;s interesting.  What you describe above certainly sounds like\nhypermedia, but because we&#39;re talking about an architectural\nconstraint, we need to confirm that hypermedia is the *only*\napplication model you&#39;re using when we&#39;re testing for RESTfulness.\n\nFrom the link you provided, some of the text there (I&#39;m ignoring the\n&quot;XML-RPC coming soon&quot; note!) gives me the impression that some\nrelationships between resources are established a priori, rather than\ndiscovered as the application state progresses. e.g. it says &quot;For\nexample, this identifies a file or directory: [...]\nhttp://localhost:8123/uri/$URI&quot;.  If that&#39;s the case, then that isn&#39;t\nusing the hypermedia constraint.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
