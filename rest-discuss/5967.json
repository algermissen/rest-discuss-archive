Take a look at http://www.yahoo.com.  It&#39;s got a lot of \n&gt; resources on one page.  It&#39;s got a directory, a list of movies, stuff \n&gt; about small businesses, featured services, entertainment, buzz log, \n&gt; news, traffic, etc.  Are you saying the only RESTful way to do this is \n&gt; to give each of these separate URLs?  I guess the pictures are already \n&gt; being downloaded as separate resources, so maybe it&#39;s not too much of a \n&gt; stretch.  It just seems so much more efficient for the server to compose \n&gt; it on the fly.  \n\nI believe you&#39;re quite wrong. Pipelining and persistent connections\nnegated the performance penalty of many resources years ago.\n\nAnd anyway, we&#39;re talking about scalability; not performance.\n\n\nNote that REST isn&#39;t some new idea that was just dreamed up. There are\nmany apps out there built with these techniques. They tend to be the\nhighly scalable ones.\n\n\n&gt; If you want to have things like online banking, or personalized site \n&gt; pages (like Yahoo can do), or web mail, I don&#39;t see how you can avoid \n&gt; having two things.  E.g., the URL for your April bank statement is \n&gt; http://www.bank.com/statements/200604, and your identity is passed along \n&gt; some other way, say through a cookie. \n\nAuthentication is not tangenital to the resource. It is part of the\nresource. HTTP authentication is part of the header. You can even do\ncookie authentication this way (by keeping the auth details in the\nheader).\n\n[Note that clear-text visibility is not an argument against this\n approach because we have SSL for proper security]\n\n\n&gt;&gt; But consider the scalability implications of never being able to have\n&gt;&gt; an intermediary cache the resource (because you don&#39;t know when it\n&gt;&gt; will change).\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Well, you never know when any resource might change, right?\n\nBut the caching model in HTTP works for resources. Nothing else. So\na cache can handle resource changes... Last Modified resource caching\nis particularly easy to implement (hence it&#39;s inclusion in many\nframeworks).\n\nBut a session based app can rarely allow any caching because of the\ncomplexity of doing it.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
