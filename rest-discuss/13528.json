Should one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; discourage people to create cool URIs\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) with the result that they are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more likely not to hard-code / deep-link them?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is nothing unRESTful about deep-linking. URIs are how you\n&gt;&gt; identify resources in a REST/HTTP system. It is perfectly reasonable\n&gt;&gt; for clients want/need to store references so some resources. A\n&gt;&gt; clients that does so needs to understand redirections when\n&gt;&gt; dereferencing stored URIs, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t say it was unRESTful. But, if a client\n&gt; bookmarks/deep-links/hard-codes URIs, then I would say it is more\n&gt; tightly coupled to the server than if it just kept one root-URI and\n&gt; then used HATEOAS/followed hyperlinks from there to get to the deeper\n&gt; resources.. Do you agree?\n\nNo.\n\nWhen following a link extracted from representations there is always a\ndelay between when the server generated the URIs and when the client\ndereferences them.  This interval can be quite large even for clients\nthat are not bookmarking with caching.  Storing those URIs for later\nuse is, in some respects at least, just and extension of the delays\nbetween URI generation and dereference that always exist in an REST\nsystem.\n\nWith normal client execution and caching the server does have some say\nover the life time of URI visibility.  However, this view requires an\nassumption of well behaved clients.  Even with clients that follow the\nrules the expected lifetime a URI cannot be relied on due to things\nlike computers being put to sleep, clients getting jammed for long\nperiods, etc.\n\nAll in all, i think it is much safer for a system to assume that once\na URI has been handed to a client, that it could be dereferenced at\nanytime in the future.  The act of removing support for a previously\nissued URI should require an affirmative defense and should usually be\nhandled with a 410 Gone response.  Redirection is continued support in\nmy mind.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
