They don&#39;t go for internal reviews much\nand I haven&#39;t talked to them in a while, but if they did anything\ndrastically wrong, they&#39;d hear about it from me.\n\n&gt; &gt; There is a wildly varying set of data maintained within various Amazon \n&gt; &gt; systems, and even if by some miracle every data service took the \n&gt; &gt; trouble to highlight and markup every potential reference to resources \n&gt; &gt; from other data services at Amazon (hyperlinks),\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think so.  I spent some time working through their \n&gt; API document, and it doesn&#39;t really seem all that \n&gt; complicated.  Or at least, it doesn&#39;t *have* to be.\nDid you look at any update APIs? Or just the query interfaces?\nThe update APIs have two broad families - one for Marketplace sellers\n(individuals and small shops, with the occasional 100K SKU seller), and\nanother for Merchants (medium to large scale, like Target, Nordstrom, etc).\nThe kind of data submitted are things like Product, Relationships, Price,\nInventory,  Shipping, Rebates, Browse structures, etc. The Product data has\nthe most complex data needs - there are many many product attributes\n(weight, brand, manufacturer, voltage, material, color, hazmat, loft,\ngender, diameter, and on and on...). \nThe issue with hyperlinking that I mentioned (which actually isn&#39;t that big\na deal) has to do with a document containing a product attribute like\n&#39;material&#39; and deciding whether that document should link to resources about\nthat &#39;material&#39; and if so, which resources? What is the most useful for an\napplication? These sort of fine-grained links don&#39;t seem to be manageable in\nthe large scale scenerio that we have. \n\n\n\n&gt; Remember, the goal is to provide power by keeping things *simple*.    \n&gt; If you buy the REST idea that there are only four verbs, then \n&gt; everything else becomes a small set of nouns and list of a \n&gt; valid attributes.  Also, the goal is NOT to ensure everything \n&gt; is browseable\n&gt; -- just provide the blank forms so it can be queried.\nThe list of valid attributes still needs to be presented and the user\ninteraction on a single page with those attributes along with the valid\nchanges to that data is very hard to automate. It can be done, but it\nresults in a plain vanilla user interface. It gets the job done, but it\nisn&#39;t the slickest thing.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me put it this way: if I understand it correctly, REST is \n&gt; just treating the web as a database.  That was the magic of \n&gt; Roy&#39;s thesis\n&gt; -- he proved you could do anything you want by keeping the \n&gt; back-end simple, and let the client add complexity if it \n&gt; wants.  Isn&#39;t that right?\nUh, sort of... I don&#39;t think the thesis &#39;proved&#39; anything. My reading is\nthat principled design of Web-scale systems would result in a system with\nthe noted characteristics. The implication is that we can also create large\nscale systems if we all steal like a sumbitch from the ideas inherent in the\nWeb.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve already proved that it is trivial to write basic tools \n&gt; for automating database UIs by reverse-engineering the \n&gt; schema.  Why shouldn&#39;t that work for REST web services?\nFor resource representations that contain medium sized numbers of named\nproperties (columns in tables, elements in document markup, etc) it&#39;s a\nreasonable start. But hypermedia goes beyond that - images, audio, 3d scenes\n(hyperspace?), vector graphics, etc.\n\n\n"}}
