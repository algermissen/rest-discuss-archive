Fielding&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I did not understand was that on the one hand REST says that the\n&gt; &gt; naming authority decides what the resource is that a given URI\n&gt; &gt; identifies\n&gt; &gt; and that on the other hand people on this list said that the user of\n&gt; &gt; a URI (the link maker) decides what resource it identifies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then I understood you to say that\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - a URI (directly) identifies the one resource that the naming\n&gt; &gt; authority\n&gt; &gt;   decides it to identify.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - a URI (may) **indirectly** identify other resources depending on the\n&gt; &gt;   intention of the URI-user (the link-maker)\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be better to say that the link-maker is indirectly identifying\n&gt; other resources (for which he is ignorant of a better URI, if any)\n&gt; through use of a URI that seems to result in what he wants when it\n&gt; is used.  Whether or not his intended resource is, in fact, the one\n&gt; identified by the URI (by means of the owner maintaining the mapping)\n&gt; is unknown to that link-maker.\n&gt; \n&gt; It gets worse: over time, if the majority of link-makers have a\n&gt; different\n&gt; opinion about the nature of the resource being identified than the\n&gt; owner,\n&gt; they might change the owner&#39;s opinion as well.  [oh, you mention that\n&gt; later]\n\nHmm, this suggests (IMHO) that it is &#39;bad practice&#39; to use URIs to\nidentify other resources than the ones they identify by definition their\nnaming authority.\n\nExample:  Given a URI that identifies a resource that &#39;is a document&#39; (the\nabstraction of a document), say a paper about presidential democracy, it\nwould be bad practice to use that URI to identify the idea &#39;presidetion\ndemocracy&#39;.\n\nI think this is what I don&#39;t get in my head. It is exactly what people do\nall the time but this common practice seems to be very unRESTful.\n\nOr am I just confused by RDF/SW abuses of the Web?\n\nTaken to extreme: if thousands of RDF authors would use my email address to\nidentify &#39;me&#39; in RDF documents, should I then call my ISP (the naming authority)\nand have him change the definition of what resource my email address identifies?\n\n\nHowever, thanks for all the answers to myquestions. You all have been\nvery helpful. \n\nJan\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
