As we\ntalked about, there are already many attributes the current web and the REST\narchitecture that can be seen as object-oriented.  But much of it is not\nexplicitly laid out and there are also some OO concepts that could use some\nadditional support tools.\n\nI guess by full-blown, I meant fleshing it out from the current base set and\nto create tools for current OOP programmers to be able to program for the\nweb using a familiar development environment.\n\nLet me use the recently discussed orbitarium example (with the URI\nvariations suggested by you and Allan Doyle) and see how a standard java\nprogrammer may want to access and manipulate such a resource:\n\nAssuming there is an RDF description of the orbitarium which describes the\norbitarium:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;\n         xmlns:o=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/vocab#&quot;&gt;\n\n   &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/about&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;o:planets&gt;\n         &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li\nrdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Mercury&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Venus&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Mars&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;\n      &lt;/o:planets&gt;\n   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n\nIgnoring that earth is the 3rd planet, it would nice to have a tool that\nreads the RDF and instantiates an orbitarium object and the 3 planets\nobjects which map directly to these resources.  As an example, the class\ndefinition generated for the orbitarium could be something like this:\n\nclass Orbitarium {\n  String about;\n  Vector planets;\n}\n\nclass Planet {\n  String resource;\n\n  Float GetGeocentricPosition() {\n    return GET(resource+&quot;/GeocentricPosition&quot;);\n  }\n\n  Float GetHeliocentricPosition() {\n    return GET(resource+&quot;/HeliocentricPosition&quot;);\n  }\n}\n\nNote that these objects are in essence &quot;references&quot; to the source objects.\nThere are probably some way to make these types of URI references a real\nreference type in the program&#39;s addressing space, but that isn&#39;t necessary\nto make this work.\n\nI can now write a display program that can plot the planet orbits over time\nusing the existing programming methodologies, despite the fact that the\nsource of the data is sitting somewhere else on the web.\n\nAnd if I create the charts in SVG, it would be great if I have a tool that\ntakes my planet chart object and publish it by generating an RDF file.  And\nin fact I can include in my publishing call the original planet objects\n(assuming proper publishing rights are observed):\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;\n         xmlns:j=&quot;http://www.joesorbitarium.com/planets/vocab#&quot;\n         xmlns:o=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/vocab#&quot;&gt;\n\n   &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.joesorbitarium.com/about&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;j:planetcharts&gt;\n         &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li\nrdf:resource=&quot;http://www.joesorbitarium.com/planetscharts/Mercury&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li\nrdf:resource=&quot;http://www.joesorbitarium.com/planetscharts/Venus&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li\nrdf:resource=&quot;http://www.joesorbitarium.com/planetscharts/Mars&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;\n      &lt;/j:planetcharts&gt;\n      &lt;o:planets&gt;\n         &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li\nrdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Mercury&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Venus&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.orbitarium.com/planets/Mars&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;\n      &lt;/o:planets&gt;\n   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n\n\nI&#39;m not an RDF expert, so forgive me if some of this is not proper usage.\nBut, my main point is that one of the reasons SOAP was getting momentum is\nthat it presents a familiar programming model.  I think we can do the same\nwith REST by presenting not an RPC model, but a OOP model for building\nRESTful applications.\n\n//Joe\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\nSent: Tuesday, May 28, 2002 12:35 PM\nTo: Joe Hsy\nCc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST-OO?
