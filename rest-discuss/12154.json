Of course,\nthe server side should know the purpose of this PUT, and return the\nURI of the created composite resource.\n2. use DELETE to delete the composite resource.\n\nIn this way, both the client side and the server side have clear\nunderstanding of what each operation and each URI mean.\n\nI feel it is more explicit and clear than sending a POST with many &quot;delete&quot;.\n\nCheers,\n\nDong\n\n-- \nhttp://dongnotes.blogspot.com/\n\n"}}
