And the\n&gt; information which allows you to see how it is different is not\n&gt; available in the request, it&#39;s stored in the &quot;session&quot;.\n&gt;   \nWell, every time I access a page representing a stock ticker, it could \nbe different, too.  Every time I access a Wikipedia article, it could be \ndifferent.  And the information about how the Wikipedia article is \ndifferent, if I&#39;m lucky, is buried in the form of English text in the \nrelated discuss page.\n&gt; The above example is also a good illustration of why sessions are\n&gt; bad. It is clearly unscalable to do the above. You can start fixing\n&gt; that scalability problem by throwing money at bea or whoever... but\n&gt; that way is very expensive. \n&gt;   \nI&#39;m guessing you mean because the session state is presumably kept local \nto one server.  I don&#39;t know how the &quot;session&quot; object in JSP is \nimplemented.  For all I know it could come from a distributed database.\n\nSuppose, instead of using a &quot;session&quot; object in JSP, I used a separate \nresource, accessible by a URL.  Then if that resource was changed, how \nwould the change be propagated to all the other servers in the farm?  \nSeems you have the same problem, with a session object, or with a \n&quot;resource&quot;.\n&gt; By designing RESTfully you get to write less cheques.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; PS note that keeping data in the cookie header is ok. As long as it&#39;s\n&gt; always presented in the cookie header. You have to be able to do\n&gt; shopping carts somehow.\n&gt;   \nWell, I&#39;ve seen examples where people put the shopping cart ID into the \nURL explicitly.  E.g., a POST to http://www.example.com/carts/23892 puts \na new item in cart #23892.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
