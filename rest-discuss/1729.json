The implementation of\n&gt; HTTP was simple.  But, as far as I can see, the fact that it is RESTful is\n&gt; just as much a coincidence as anything else.\nHTTP was simple. And it succeeded. And it grew. And it /continued/ to\nsucceed. Why was that?\nIf you list the reasons, and give that list a name, you will have &#39;named&#39;\nthe principles of the Web architecture.\nRoy just happened to call it REST.\nIn other words - HTTP happened first, REST was the name made up to explain\nit.\n\n&gt; So, if this is the case, why\n&gt; does everyone keep getting hung up on HTTP when discussing REST?\nNot every discussion of REST falls back on HTTP. I&#39;ve talked a small amount\nabout using JMS with REST concepts - addressability, minimal methods,\nmultiple representations for an entity, etc. Refering back to HTTP is just a\nway of giving concrete examples and avoiding academic ivory towers.\n\n&gt; It seems to me that the &quot;REST effort&quot; would progress much better if all\n&gt; conversations would just drop HTTP and talk about implementations in\n&gt; general.  I think that a lot of people (including myself) end up having a\n&gt; hard time determining if an argument is about REST or the &quot;RESTfulness of\n&gt; HTTP&quot;.  HTTP may be a good example of the REST principles, but that&#39;s all\nit\n&gt; should be.  Maybe we could come up with (assuming there isn&#39;t already) a\n&gt; fictitious RESTful implementation (NOT BASED ON HTTP) that would allow\n&gt; discussions of REST without losing focus or making it difficult for us\nnewer\n&gt; guys to figure out which is about REST and which is about something\nrelated\n&gt; to REST.\nOkay. Start a page on the Wiki. But remember, an implementation of REST\nshines when it is large-scaled and network based -\nsingle-user/single-machine APIs have a lot of other issues and tradeoffs\nthat make REST not a clear choice.\n\n\n"}}
