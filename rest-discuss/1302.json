But at some point, I have to ask &quot;ok, where is\n&gt; it?&quot;  Where is the spec that I can look to, to show me and others how to\n&gt; use SOAP in this way?  Are you going to write it?  If not, who will?  I\n&gt; haven&#39;t heard anybody else volunteer, nor even identify the need for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frankly, I&#39;ve now given up on SOAP ever being used in this way because\n&gt; it&#39;s become synonymous (in developers&#39; minds, and in deployed code) with\n&gt; non-REST style interactions.  If, at some point in the future this\n&gt; changes, then I&#39;ll be very happy.  But until that point, I&#39;m going to\n&gt; use the only protocol that lets me do REST out of the box; HTTP.\n\nProbably the best way to describe where my head is at is that I feel that\nthere ultimately will be a unification of the various approaches, and I do\nplan on playing an active role in documenting that unification.  The\nunification, IMHO, will not be precisely REST as documented and practiced\ntoday, but will share a number of important characteristics with that\narchitectural aproach.  It most definately will NOT be RPC as practiced\ntoday.\n\nA fairly approachable overview of where I think things are headed can be\nfound at:\n\n   http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/04/05/neurotransmitters.html\n\nFeedback welcome.\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
