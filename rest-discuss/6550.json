Just add a parameter, say editform,\n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; the url, eg: \n&gt; &gt; http://server/someresource?editform \n&gt; It is my understanding that you&#39;re not supposed to modify resource\n&gt; URI&#39;s in \n&gt; this way. It&#39;s the simple answer but I understand it&#39;s not RESTful.\n&gt; Can you \n&gt; who are more familiar with this please comment? \n\nThe server is allowed to do anything it wants. As the operator of a\nwebsite I can construct my url-space in any way I choose. If I tell the\nclient that the http://server/someresource?editform url exists by way of\na hyperlink no web tenets are broken.\n\nIf the client sees the resource http://server/someresource and deduces\non its own that the http://server/someresource?editform must exist, then\ntenets are being broken[1]. If the client application moved on to\nsomeone elses server, it would have to follow my naming conventions or\nthe application would no longer work. REST separates the concerns of\nnouns, verbs, and content types[2]. Although we are all expected to have\nsimilarly-structured content, we are not all expected to have\nsimilarly-structured urls. They work differently from each other in REST\nand have different constraints.\n\nBenjamin.\n[1] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UrlConstruction\n[2] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestTriangle\n\n\n"}}
