Wiki editing is the\n&gt; &gt; obvious exception, but that&#39;s best done from the browser (WYSIWYG\n&gt; &gt; editing), not via PUT in a form IMO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ideally, we&#39;d have both though.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thing is, isn&#39;t what we have: ie support through Javascript, actually\n&gt; the ideal situation?\n\nNot by itself, IMO.  Common practice with script based solutions\nrequire associating the HTML pages with the script, meaning that users\nonly realize the benefit if publishers let them have it.\n\nA viable script based solution to this problem would resemble plugins, I think.\n\nA former client of mine has a WYSIWYG Web authoring environment which\nhas its own XSLT-like scripting environment.  The scripts could either\nbe associated with the content by the publisher, or installed locally\non the client as a plugin, and activated as required (by media type &\nXML namespace).  http://www.xfytec.com\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
