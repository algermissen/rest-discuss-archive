Then, I would replace &#39;Create, Read,\n&gt; Update, and Delete&#39; with &#39;PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE&#39;.  To clarify my\npoint,\n&gt; I might reword the last sentence to say &quot;...web of linked resources\naccessed\n&gt; by a handful of verbs that allow you to create, read, update, and delete\n&gt; them.&quot;  I would then elaborate on the connection between a RESTful style\nand\n&gt; HTTP and make sure I reference Fielding&#39;s thesis.\n\nI don&#39;t believe that REST depends on those /particular/ operations. Any\nself-consistent system can pick whatever small number of operations it\nwants. It will only be consistent with itself though, unless it uses the\nsame operations (with the same meanings, etc) as other systems though.\n\nIf your job is to build a system, without regard to interoperability with\nother systems, then using those particular operations is a lower priority.\nBut if you are successful, you will eventually run into them, so you better\nbe prepared to translate, or just use them from day one.\n\n\n"}}
