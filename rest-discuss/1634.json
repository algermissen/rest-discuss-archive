It&#39;s a question of whether there are problems\n&gt; &gt; that require routing where the client specifies the list of nodes in\n&gt; &gt; advance and then waits for the completion of hte action. If so, what is\n&gt; &gt; the syntax for supporting that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that &quot;client specifies list of nodes [to process intermediate states of\n&gt; some request]&quot; doesn&#39;t imply or require path-based addressing, or indeed any\n&gt; URI syntactic solution.  \n\nThat&#39;s why I finished the sentence. By the way, chained URI-syntax was\njust one possible solution. As Mark said, he uses XML-based routing.\n\n&gt; ... PBA has this insidious problem:  the client\n&gt; specifies A/B/C and hands off to A, counting on A to hand B/C to B, and\n&gt; counting on B to handoff to C, and counting on the reverse.  That is\n&gt; different from&quot; &quot;client calls A, gets representation Ra.  Client calls B\n&gt; with representation Ra, getting representation Rb.  Client calls C with\n&gt; representation Rb, getting representation Rc.&quot;  It&#39;s not necessary for any\n&gt; &quot;intermediary&quot; to know about or interact with any of the others, and if you\n&gt; want a way to declaratively specify or refer to such a sequence of handoffs,\n&gt; invent and XML dialect for it.  (In fact, IIRC, this is what XML Pipes etc.\n&gt; do, more or less.)  Don&#39;t overload URIs with operational semantics.\n\nI think that this issue of operational semantics is a red herring. Do\nyou agree that a site could offer a service like this:\n\nhttp://www.math.com/sum?x=5&y=9\n\nIt returns 11. How could it then be wrong to have something like\n\nhttp://www.math2.com/power?x=5&y=http://www.math.com/sum?x=2+y=7\n\nAs soon as you open the door to &quot;generative&quot; URIs (which we agree is\nnecessary sometimes), it becomes clear that a reference to another\nresource is a valid input to the first resource. If I express this in\nXPipe or something, I have a declarative form the result but I don&#39;t\nhave a *globally accessible URI* for the result unless I can write the\nXPipe to some file somewhere.\n\n&gt; Note that the first, in addition to the problems already mentioned an in\n&gt; addition to introducing new syntax *and* semantics, also means that there\n&gt; are now not one but *two* types of HTTP URI addressible resources:  the\n&gt; traditional kind *and* an &quot;addressable proxy&quot; type.  Lots of new complexity,\n&gt; and for what purpose?\n\nNo extra complexity. It follows as naturally as:\n\na * b\n\na * (b + c)\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
