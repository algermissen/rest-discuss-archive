You who work for a\n&gt; university paid for by the public trust with a mission that includes public\n&gt; service [1] should know this better than most. It isn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t just\n&gt; be about making it easy for the elitists of development, the Eriks and the\n&gt; Berends, it is and should be about empowering as many people as possible,\n&gt; and that means being liberal is what you accept and conservative if what you\n&gt; provide. Even if it makes your job harder; doing so will make empower that\n&gt; many more people and is the right thing to do.\n&gt;\n\nOnce again, whatever point you&#39;re trying to make will most likely be lost \non others when you resort to name-calling of those who disagree with you, \ni.e. &quot;elitists&quot; who don&#39;t do &quot;real work&quot; or &quot;lead real lives&quot;.  Do you \nthink it&#39;s possible for you to make your points without all the B.S. and \nsweeping generalizations?  You have not backed up your claim that using \nXML &quot;puts a burden of conservatism on others.&quot;\n\nMy service outputs valid XML, but accepts a wide variety of input.  For \nexample, you can use &quot;BBcode&quot; (or even wiki-code) if you&#39;d like, to make \na post -- it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect.  You can even [b]nest \n[i]improperly[/b][/i], when the server accepts that input it will be \ntransformed to &quot;&lt;strong&gt;nest &lt;em&gt;improperly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; before the \npost is stored, or published.\n\nThus, the service is being liberal in what it accepts and conservative in \nwhat it produces, without &quot;burdening others with conservatism&quot; despite my \ninsistence on using valid XML.  I fail to see how this use of valid XML \nputs interacting with, or maintaining, my service beyond the reach of non-\nexperts.\n\nAnyone with the ability to make a post on a wiki, weblog or forum -- and \na Web browser with forms capability -- can use it.  Anyone who has even a \npassing familiarity with Web development can work *with* it, even if they \ndon&#39;t know XSLT.  Or JavaScript, as would be required with JSON.\n\nYour point seems to be that, in and of itself, the use of XML is somehow \nlimiting.  I&#39;m sorry, but that just isn&#39;t the case.  In my experience the \nopposite is true -- appropriate use of XML is quite liberating, and within \nreach of the majority of Web developers out there due to its simplicity.  \nNothing dogmatic about it, just pragmatic.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
