Do you\n&gt; still see multiple interpretations?\n\nWe might be able to construct an example where there&#39;s only one\ninterpretation of a POST example, but that doesn&#39;t suggest that this\nis a good general solution.  It would require rethinking how schemas\nare designed.  For example, you wouldn&#39;t want to use &quot;name&quot; elements\nin multiple places, you&#39;d have to use &quot;purchaserName&quot; and &quot;shipToName&quot;,\netc.. rather than using a &quot;purchaser&quot; element which includes a &quot;name&quot;\nelement.  That&#39;s quite a burden to place on schema designers.\n\nIMO, the best approach is to separate the concerns of specifying the\nvalid state of resources (XML schema, RDF, etc..), from the ways in\nwhich the state is manipulated.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
