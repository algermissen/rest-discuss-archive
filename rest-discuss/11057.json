For example, between\nthe middel-ware and the datastore (database or file-based system). I\nuse it for things like application meta-data (configuraitons,\ntemplates, transformations, etc.), too.\n\nOf course, I allow squid to act as the caching proxy *in front* of the\ncode I have running on the HTTP Web server, too.\n\nMikeA\n\n\nOn Fri, Jul 18, 2008 at 1:27 PM, icetbr &lt;icetbr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok, I&#39;m sort of out of touch here. Do you you mind explaining me the\n&gt; basic concept of this cache? When an image changes, the file&#39;s date in\n&gt; the filesystem is changed, and that&#39;s how you know you need a new\n&gt; version. How do you know when a resource changes? Where do you store\n&gt; its representation? Squid acts in the client, and only enterprises use\n&gt; it. I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re talking about the same thing here (if so, sorry\n&gt; about my lack of explanation). When you talk about &quot;REST cache&quot;, is it\n&gt; always about the client?\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Jul 18, 2008, at 7:46 AM, icetbr wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I know something about Etags, expiration header and other specifics of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the HTTP protocol.

In fact, that is the advantage of using a uniform\n&gt;&gt; interface such as HTTP. The cache need not be application aware.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
