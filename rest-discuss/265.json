Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Note, the reason for closing connections is that\n&gt; holding open a thread or child process(!!) for\n&gt; each client is expensive.\nThe KnowNow servers supposedly does 10K clients per Solaris box. I don&#39;t\nknow if that is expensive or not.\n[honest, i&#39;m not trying to plug them, but they&#39;re the only example of http\nevents that I can point to with any amount of understanding]\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But you first have to model your presence app as a set of resources.\n&gt; &gt; e.g. each user gets a URI, a persistent GET to that URI returns a\n&gt; &gt; stream of presence messages as their presence status changes, etc..\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, that may be, but since you also have to\n&gt; write a custom client, I don&#39;t see the bonus of\n&gt; HTTP here.\nI wrote a buddy list/IM clone in just HTML & JavaScript - sure it was\n&#39;custom&#39;, but I can now give it away to 10K script kiddies to innovate with.\nChange graphics, chat with their thermometers, etc.\nThe bonus is that the client is just like 10 million other clients, with a\nlarge support staff - all are different dynamically loaded modules within\nthe WebApp called WWW.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
