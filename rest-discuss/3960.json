The talk explains how the web-calculus is\nderived from existing REST theory, and highlights the advantages\nof this design. The presentation generated much positive\ndiscussion, especially amongst HP Lab&#39;s web services group.\n\nHP Labs provided wonderful A/V support, including a video of the\npresentation. The presentation video and the slides are available\nfor download from the Waterken Inc. site. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/HP2003/\n\nThe presentation is really the first work that explains the\nfunctionality benefits that come from using the web-calculus. In\nexplaining these benefits, the presentation also serves as a good\nprimer on REST. I encourage everyone to download and view the\nvideo.\n\nThanks to everyone at HP Labs who made the presentation possible.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
