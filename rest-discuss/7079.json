Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; That&#39;s an URL.  You can&#39;t tell by looking at an URL what its representation \n&gt; may be.  URLs are opaque.  Look again at the URL I gave as an example, and \n&gt; stop assuming the query string is a query string.  Taken character-for-\n&gt; character that URL identifies a resource, and that&#39;s all it does.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this case it is a query string.  Let&#39;s make a different example, a State \n&gt; Capitol service.  The URL:\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://example.com/capitol\n&gt;\n&gt; Consists of a form (method=GET) which is a simple drop-down list containing \n&gt; the names of all fifty states.  When I select my State from the list and \n&gt; click &quot;submit&quot; what happens?  A GET is sent to dereference this URL:\n&gt;\n&gt; [2] http://example.com/capitol?query=CO\n&gt;\n&gt; When this URL is dereferenced it returns a representation which contains the \n&gt; word &quot;Denver&quot; in an HTML page.  No representation needs to be sent to that \n&gt; URL, it just needs to be dereferenced.  When URL 1 is dereferenced, the \n&gt; representation it returns is a form which may be filled out and returned to \n&gt; the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; When interacting with a web application, URLs are dereferenced which transfer \n&gt; representations of application state.  When the service URL is dereferenced, \n&gt; that one application state contains a list of fifty other application states, \n&gt; with a submit button.  That is an HTML representation, i.e. hypermedia.\n&gt;\n&gt; [3] http://example.com/capitol?query={state_abbreviation}\n&gt;\n&gt; Selecting one item and returning the representation of the form to the server \n&gt; (either as a message body, or urlencoded) results in the retrieval of one of \n&gt; the other application states, which are also each individually \n&gt; dereferenceable at their own RESTful URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say I want to move the capitol of Colorado to Oak Creek.  I can design \n&gt; a service which accepts a PUT at [2] containing the same representation \n&gt; returned by a GET at [2], with &quot;Denver&quot; replaced by &quot;Oak Creek&quot; such that \n&gt; subsequent GET requests at [2] return a representation containing the words \n&gt; &quot;Oak Creek.&quot;  Application state has changed as a result of a representational \n&gt; state transfer, i.e. a PUT.\n\nAnd people complain because they say they can&#39;t find clear\ndescriptions.\n\nEric, you should reformat this on the REST wiki and we can point new\npeople to it in future.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\nPS That means I thought it was a really good explanation.\n\n"}}
