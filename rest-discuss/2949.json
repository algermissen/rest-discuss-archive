With Jabber and most other P2P \nsystems, I can &quot;log on&quot; as me anywhere in the world and messages are \nforwarded to me. That&#39;s because there is an always-on intermediary that \nstands in for me. The lack of these intermediaries is a big problem for \nHTTP-based P2P and is the second major reason (beyond firewalls) that \nHTTP is not seen as much of a P2P solution.\n\n &gt; If you can&#39;t open a connection to the desktop - and Jabber\n &gt; I&#39;m assuming doesn&#39;t do this either - then have the desktop open a\n &gt; connection to the server (or Jabber server, or HTTP proxy, or\n &gt; whatever) and then wait for\n\n&gt; incoming messaging.\n\nWell it probably doesn&#39;t make that much sense to connect to a true &quot;data \nserver&quot; and wait for it to send you messages. I&#39;m not going to open a \nconnection to Google and Slashdot and a dozen Weblogs and just sit \nthere. More likely I have a single trusted intermediary with a single \nsocket open for me. It either polls those other sites or accepts \nnotifications for me.\n\nIt needs to do the message redirecting for me and it might as well have \nstore and forward and presence capabilities at the same time.\n\nGetting the trusted intermediaries out there and available involves a \nlittle bit of a bootstrapping problem.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
