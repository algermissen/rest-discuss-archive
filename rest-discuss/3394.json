It seems to me that 404\nis\n&gt; &gt; the correct response, but I wanted to make sure...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve used 404 myself, but I could think of good reasons not to.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there was some set of query params that identified the &quot;primary\n&gt; key&quot; for the resource, then additional parameters could safely be\n&gt; ignored such that GET returned the same representations as for the\n&gt; URI with only the primary key params specified.  In theory, it may be\n&gt; useful to return a 302 response back to this primary URI; in practice,\n&gt; it&#39;s certainly not worth the extra round trip, so probably fine to\n&gt; just return the same representations on a 200 until new parameters\n&gt; are supported.\n\nHmm... I suppose you could also just return a Content-Location: header with\nthe 200 response.  On the other hand, this effectively allows others to\nextend the URL with your implicit permission.  For instance, suppose someone\nchose to add their own query parameter which they used in their own system\nfor some reason or other.  Now, suppose at a later point in time, you decide\nto add a new query parameter to your system which just happens to be the\nsame name as someone else&#39;s parameter name.  Potentially, you could cause\nunexpected side effects for that link that&#39;s already out there.  Admittedly,\nit&#39;s unlikely that this scenario would happen, but there&#39;s a lot about the\nweb today that I would have said the same thing about yesterday.\n\n&gt; If you expect your primary key may change, then a 404 approach\n&gt; probably makes good sense.\n\nIn this case, I do not have the pk in the query string.  I have just\nfinished writing a new blog system (didn&#39;t like any of the ones I found),\ntrying to use the REST architecture as much as possible.  I still have a\nlong way to go, but the first version is up and running(?) at\nhttp://www.seairth.com/blog. In this case, the query string is only used to\nfetch html-based forms for adding/editing folders and entries.  For\ninstance, suppose I have an folder whose URL is:\n\nhttp://www.seairth.com/blog/blogg\n\n(yes, it actually exists)  If you do a GET on that URL, you will get back an\nappropriate representation of the resource.  Now, if I wanted to create a\nnew subfolder or entry, I would POST the appropriate message to that URL.\nThis could be done by writing a gui application similar to what Joe Gregorio\nhas done with his blog system.  However, since I don&#39;t have ony yet, I opted\nto use html-based forms.  In order to fetch the appropriate form, I would\nuse a URL like:\n\nhttp://www.seairth.com/blog/blogg?form=addentry\n\n(yes, it exists, but is protected)  This would return to me an html form,\nwhich would in turn just POST to the URL (without the query string).  At the\nend of the day, it all works really, really well.  So far, anyhow.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
