I need a way\nto communicate this error to the user in case creation fails or\nresulting resource in case the execution succeeds.\n\nWould this be correct?\n\n1.) Initial POST to /res1 returns an URI /res2\n2.) Subsequent GET or HEAD of /res2 return 202 until the task finishes\n3a.) In case the execution succeeds, a GET or HEAD of /res2 returns 200\nwith task result as body\n3b.) Otherwise make the /res2 go away and start returning 410 (or 404?)\nand explaining what went wrong in the body?\n\nOr is there a better way?\n\nThanks,\n-- \nLubomir Rintel (GoodData), phone: #7715\n\n\n"}}
