I felt lucky to dig up this old thread, but I can&#39;t say the\n&gt; responses were tremendously helpful to me (I am up to a very basic\n&gt; understanding of REST, but not of Apache.)\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve undoubtably found an answer already, but here are some\n&gt; resources for others who stumble across this thread.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sitepoint.com/print/guide-url-rewriting and\n&gt; http://www.sitepoint.com/print/search-engine-friendly-urls are some\n&gt; help, and CherryPy http://www.cherrypy.org has a handy &quot;default&quot;\n&gt; method that looks like it may address this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
