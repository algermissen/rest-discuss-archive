I usually choose\n&gt;&gt; queries, in the idea that the resource should have only one URI\n&gt;&gt; assigned to it, and the user might query its space.\n&gt;\n&gt; The notion that we&#39;re talking about only one resource here\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.

Why enter?&quot;\n\n--\n\nThey are the same resource because they are the same *information.*  \nThe two are separate *representations* of the same abstract *resource* \n--- and the resource itself is the thing named by the URI.\n\nIf this isn&#39;t clear, imagine this:  what if you had some magic piece of \nsoftware which translated documents in any natural language to any \nother natural language on the fly.  What would you call the \ntranslations themselves vs. the information they contained?  The \ntranslations are representations.  The information itself is the \nresource.\n\nSimilarly:  a novel in five different languages is still the same \n*novel.*  Five different printings of that novel --- same or different \nlanguages --- are different *books.*  When I speak of &quot;Beggars in \nSpain&quot; by Nancy Kress, I&#39;m talking about what she wrote --- not my copy \nof it on my bookshelf.\n\nHope that&#39;s helpful, cheers.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
