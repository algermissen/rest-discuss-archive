REST&#39;s hypermedia constraint mandates that the client only relies on the current steady state (think &quot;Web page&quot;) when deciding what to do next.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand why the distinction matters.\n\nBecause it decouples the server implementation from the client&#39;s expectations. It is the reason why e.g. Amazon can evolve without considering the millions of clients using it. Amazon can even evolve *while* clients are in the middle of a purchase.\n\n&gt;  I&#39;ve read here that it matters because the server could mix things up and then the client in the hard coded situation would be stuck.  \n\nIt matters because REST aims to free the server from having to consider its clients when it evolves.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d suggest that even in the &quot;REST&quot; scenario, a server could throw a curve ball that will leave the client with no place to go but home.\n\nSure. For those cases, REST emphasizes that the client MUST expect such cases and deal with them instead of considering it to be a violation of some agreement. IOW, any 4xx response is still valid from the POV of the constract that governs the communication. It is not a sign of broken communication.\n\n&gt;  I think this classification has to more to do with degrees of coupling than it has to do with REST.\n\nHuh? REST is essentially about removing any coupling beyond the uniform interface - so that statement does not make sense :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Would an automated load tester (client) for a web application that uses hypermedia to traverse the application and execution not be considered RESTful because the state-machine for the application is hard-coded to some degree?\n\nWhy would it be hard-coded?\n\n(Of course you hard-code the knowledge of the media types used, but that is not hard coding the state machine)\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like some clarity on this topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eb\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
