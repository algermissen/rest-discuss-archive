Having just one without the other is where too\n&gt; many professors fail... either they teach a concept and leave it as\n&gt; an exercise to the reader to apply it (usually disastrous), or they\n&gt; show examples without the underlying conceptual framework, and\n&gt; students merely ape the example blindly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave.\n&gt; \n\nSee my response here:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/14346\n\nREST development is entirely an exercise in applied architecture.  I&#39;m\nnot interested in teaching what REST is, I&#39;m interested in teaching\nfolks how to implement systems from architectural Models.  This is\nwhere all the pragmatism of using REST lies, implementers don&#39;t need to\nunderstand theory of software architecture if someone who already does\nhelps them to Model a system.  That architect can explain REST in terms\nof the resulting Implementation, to those who need to build it.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
