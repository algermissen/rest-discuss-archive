JSON isn&#39;t too \nhot for languages other than javascript if you have XML parsers to hand \nby not JSON parser.\n\nI tend to find that if I&#39;m writing javascript then I&#39;m also producing \nXML documents or fragments out of what I&#39;m receiving, so I tend to \nfavour XML. However, JSON does indeed come into its own for anything \nwhere just having a javascript object is what you want.\n\n\n\n"}}
