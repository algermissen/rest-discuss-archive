That stinks.\n&gt; \n\nPlease don&#39;t separate my point from its context.  None of what I say\napplies to an intranet, so you can&#39;t generalize your statement like\nthat.  If by &quot;expose&quot; you mean you want to create an invoice service as\na Web API over the public Internet, then, yes.\n\nBut why do you think you need to create a media type at all?\n\nI&#39;ve never seen an invoice service that couldn&#39;t be cleanly described\nusing Atom + (X)HTML.  It&#39;s tabular data; use &lt;table&gt;.  Annotate using\nRDFa + GoodRelations.  There&#39;s simply no need to define a media type for\nthis purpose.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What am I giving up as a consequence of using a custom format? So far\n&gt; it seems that I&#39;m just giving up the right to call it RESTful.\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re giving up on a uniform interface, if by custom format you mean\nsomething you don&#39;t intend for standardization and don&#39;t intend to\nregister with IANA.  But, even if you *do* go down that road, it isn&#39;t\nclear that you&#39;ll ever get the full benefits of REST, since your data\ndoesn&#39;t inherently need its own media type I doubt it will become\nubiquitous.\n\nThe power of REST is that by re-using ubiquitous types like Atom\n+ XHTML to define an invoice-service payload, you get all the benefits\nof Internet scale *overnight* thanks to the uniform interface.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
