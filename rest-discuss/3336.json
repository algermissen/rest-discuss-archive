I was underscoring the tendency for discussion communities\nto oversimplify models, leading to the assumption that if one is\ntalking about idempotence in methods, then one must be talking\nabout REST.  It&#39;s another example of lumping HTTP and REST\ninto a single lump.  As one learns these patterns, it takes continued\neffort and review to keep the lumps from bleeding together.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Roy T.

Or did I miss it?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason it is important to HTTP/1.1 is for pipelining requests\n&gt; and knowing when it should be safe to repeat the same request without\n&gt; user intervention.  The only part where I briefly touch on it is when\n&gt; mentioning Waldo&#39;s paper on partial failures in RPC systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
