At a hi=\r\ngh level this looks the\n&gt; same to your rule system, but in truth it could h=\r\nave changed &quot;beneath\n&gt; the feet&quot; of the rule system,\nIt all makes sense... =\r\nif the server changes (b) the operation meaning\nusing the same relation nam=\r\ne, its seems like he didnt worry about\nbasic backward compatibility issues.=\r\n\n\nAnd in (a) all the issues Mike has commented on the write web appear,\ni.e=\r\n. the media type should tell us which data type to use in specific\nsituatio=\r\nns, the representation should do that, or a mix between those\ntwo could tel=\r\nl us which media type to use?\n\n&gt; and the once &quot;more robust&quot; rule system\n&gt; i=\r\ns in truth no better than a hardcoded system.\n&gt; Computers have yet to do we=\r\nll when the creators lie to them :). And we\n&gt; creators don&#39;t lie out of mal=\r\nice, simply laziness.\n&gt; A rule system is a good idea, I&#39;m just pointing out=\r\n that there can be\n&gt; a lot of issues with one.\nI agree with that, if the se=\r\nrver does not even think about being\nbackward compatible - for laziness, mi=\r\nstake and so on.\n\nAny other solutions on how to lessen that pain when those=\r\n process evolve?\n\nRegards\n\nGuilherme Silveira\nCaelum | Ensino e Inova=E7=E3=\r\no\nhttp://www.caelum.com.br/\n\n\n\n2010/5/27 Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt;=\r\n:\n&gt; On Thu, May 27, 2010 at 12:10 PM, Guilherme Silveira\n&gt; &lt;guilherme.silve=\r\nira@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; You define conditions as you would analyze you=\r\nr resource. Note that\n&gt;&gt; the string can be *anything* that you want, but yo=\r\nu checking the\n&gt;&gt; presence of a linked resource:\n&gt;\n&gt; Not to get all buzzwor=\r\ndy here, but that sounds like a rule based system.\n&gt;\n&gt; You have media type =\r\nbehaviors keyed in to the system, somehow, so, for\n&gt; example, you know what=\r\n &quot;buy a product&quot; means in terms of what data\n&gt; gets sent to the &quot;buy now&quot; l=\r\nink, and, of course, that the &quot;#buyNnow&quot;\n&gt; link actually MEANS &quot;buy now&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Once you have those base behaviors specified, then you can write write\n&gt;=\r\n rules to react to conditions in pursuit of a goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most folks represen=\r\nt those rules statically, as ordered instructions\n&gt; in a program. Vs using =\r\nsome kind of rule system that manages to order\n&gt; the rules based on the sta=\r\nte of the application. This &quot;rule soup&quot; is\n&gt; (ideally) self organizing, but=\r\n you typically have to do some kind of\n&gt; chicanery through state variables =\r\nto keep rules from firing to soon,\n&gt; or to order the rules when more than o=\r\nne rule has the potential to\n&gt; fire. That&#39;s just a truth when dealing with =\r\nany rule system.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the key here, the real take away, is the under=\r\nlying\n&gt; infrastructure of dealing with the resources -- of coding the media=\r\n\n&gt; type and the actions as generic procedures. Whether you use a rule\n&gt; sys=\r\ntem to infer your workflow or explicitly lay it out using code, the\n&gt; under=\r\nlying relationships coded to the media types are the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; Making that =\r\nunderlying infrastructure, the translating of the media\n&gt; types and support=\r\ned operations in to code easier to create would be a\n&gt; real boon. Such as d=\r\noing a GET from #itemList, a GET that\n&gt; automatically redirects if it has t=\r\noo. That alone would add a lot of\n&gt; robustness to client code.\n&gt;\n&gt; For most=\r\n code, IMHO, having to use a rule engine for logic is simply\n&gt; overkill. Su=\r\nre it can be more flexible, and resistant to change, but\n&gt; one issue with t=\r\nhat is that the rules were written given basic\n&gt; assumptions. And the premi=\r\nse is that those assumptions won&#39;t change,\n&gt; even if other premises are mad=\r\ne on the hosting server. But,\n&gt; historically, many a system has overloaded =\r\nan older concept using the\n&gt; same identifiers with a new concept. And whate=\r\nver assumption your rule\n&gt; system made upon that concept are now mistaken b=\r\necause it was never\n&gt; told about the new assumptions associated with the sa=\r\nme identifier as\n&gt; published by the server system.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
