That\nway, an agent could locate do things like summarize all the contacts for\nme, and correlate that with their postings to alt.sex.  But the issue\nis, what&#39;s the best way to do this?\n\nOne obvious way, which you seem to suggest, is for everybody to share\nthe same relative name for it.  The major problem with this though, is\nthat a software agent wouldn&#39;t know whether a web site was following\nthese rules, or if they just happened to have a page named /contact.\nIt is absolutely key that names not be standardized, because it means\nthat there has to be some central authority that ensures that names\ndon&#39;t conflict.  After 20 years of people doing this, you literally\nwould have to check with somebody to ensure that it&#39;s ok for you to\npublish /foo/bar/baz, lest somebody else has already defined what that\nmeans.\n\nThe opacity-friendly way of doing this would be to assert a relationship\nbetween the main site and the URI it uses for the concepts of &quot;contact&quot;,\n&quot;help&quot;, and &quot;search&quot;.  For example, a GET on http://foo.com could\nreturn some N3 asserting;\n\n@prefix chs: &lt;http://jbone.net/contact-help-search&gt;\n&lt;/admin/help/&gt; a chs:Help .\n&lt;/search/&gt; a chs:Search .\n&lt;/contact-us/&gt; a chs:Contact .\n\nAh yes, the sweet smell of decentralization ...\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
