The entity in a POST can be\n&gt; a lot more elaborate and formal (and therefore more expressive)\n&gt; than a grunt, though.  However, from the client POV, it may be\n&gt; utterly meaningless.\n\nIt&#39;s still grunting. Elaborate here would means two fingers.\n\n&gt; : Who knows what will happen in that language game [1].\n&gt; \n&gt; Fine, fine question if taken at face value.  So, what is the answer?\n\nApply Grice&#39;s maxims. Don&#39;t grunt when you have a better way of saying \nthings.\n\n&gt; : What \n&gt; : you do know is the success criteria are undefined\n&gt; \n&gt; The server will respond with a status code indicating the level\n&gt; of success, so how is it undefined?\n\nWhat were we trying to do?\n\n&gt; : - unlike PUT and \n&gt; : DELETE, POST is degenerate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or misunderstood.\n\nNope. POST is different.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
