I listed several means\nto achieve it.\n\n&gt; &gt; This this can be achieved in a number of ways:\n&gt; &gt; 1. POST the value(s) and the server redirects the browser to a URI\n&gt; &gt; with the encoded value(s)\n&gt;\n&gt; In which case you&#39;re using POST, which may indeed be the right answer;\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s RESTful.\n\nPOST is not antithetical to REST. POST has the fuzziest meaning, to be\nsure, but is not without meaning. Why is a POST-initiated redirect not\nRESTful? Furthermore, the target URI will be both RESTful and\nencoded/obscured.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Encode the value(s) in the browser, either with local javascript or\n&gt; &gt; via a an AJAX server call, and then update the html hrefs using the\n&gt; &gt; DOM.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bleah. JavaScript cannot in general be relied on. If you have to rely on\n&gt; it, REST is already broken.\n\nYour conclusion does not follow on from the premise, I think.\n\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t forget the third alternative:\n&gt; &gt; 3. Redesign the web application to avoid the need to use sensitive\n&gt; &gt; value(s) on a GET.\n&gt;\n&gt; Easy enough to do, but then we&#39;re back to a non-RESTful POST where you\n&gt; should normally use GET. Maybe there are ways around this, but they&#39;re\n&gt; really jesuitical. For instance, you could only ask the user for their\n&gt; credit card info as part of an unsafe operation. Then you could assign\n&gt; them the unique ID that is not the credit card number for future use\n&gt; with GET. However, you would not allow the user to check their balance\n&gt; unless they&#39;d done something else unsafe first. e.g. agreeing to a contract\n\nPerhaps you have misunderstood my point, which is that you could\ndesign the URI &#39;representation space&#39; without recourse to using the\ncredit card number at all. If you have authenticated the user (which\nyou have already acknowledged is out-of-scope to your question) then\nthe server can be aware of the credit card without propagating that\nknowledge to the client (indeed, I would argue that to do so would be\nbad security design).\n\nRegards, Alan Dean\n\n"}}
