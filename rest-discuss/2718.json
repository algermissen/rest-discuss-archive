If true, that seems like an abuse of HTTP. Why\n&gt; not just choose a protocol that is built to be asynchronous?  I&#39;d \n&gt; prefer\n&gt; to stick will well supported standards-based tools if possible.\n\ni have dreamt of a RESTful protocol built as a BEEP profile to handle \nsituations like this which would just bloat HTTP.  i reckon BEEP is \nquite capable of just about any kind of 1 request-1 response, 1 \nrequest-no response (async) or 1 request-n response cycle you can think \nof.  if only there were a perl module on cpan.\n\nit allows you to distinguish between the client-server and \ninitiator-listener dichotomies.  where in client-server normally the \nserver is the listener and the client is the initiator, you could also \nhave the opposite.  if you have a copy of &#39;BEEP: The Definitive Guide&#39; \n(o&#39;reilly), check out chapter 4, &#39;Exchanges&#39;.\n\nhttp://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beep\n\nso e.g. a client could connect to your server (through NAT, firewalls, \netc.; all you need is TCP) and you could start sending POST methods \n&#39;back&#39; to it.  i don&#39;t know if this is the best solution to your \nproblem but you might want to explore further.  of course this is just \nramblings on my part; total vapour rather than something you can pick \nup off the shelf and start writing code with.\n\nhttp://www.beepcore.org/\n\nthe website leaves a lot to be desired (e.g. the news has no dates, \nit&#39;s just &#39;there&#39;) but you should be able to at least pull RFC3080.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
