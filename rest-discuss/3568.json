An alternative might be to provide a new response header\n&gt; during challenges that points a browser to a server-defined skin (possibly\n&gt; using the technique S. Mike found in the W3C Note).  Newer browsers that\n&gt; recognized the header would  be able to give a more &quot;polished&quot; look, while\n&gt; older browsers would continue working without problem.\n\nYou misunderstand me.\n\nWhen a user requests a protected resource the server can send back an\nentity body with the initial 401. The rfc says that the entity is for\nwhen the response fails - but that should only happen after a\nchallenge has been sent. \n\nTherefore, if browsers displayed any entity body sent by the server\nwhen no challenge has been sent the entity body could be used to\nprovide a &quot;normal&quot; authentication FORM (ie: a username and password\nPOSTing to some place).\n\nIn other words the entity body from the server replaces the login\ndialog box for the user.\n\nThis would fit in with the way most web applications want to do\nauthentication and it&#39;s REST compliant (as far as I can see).\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
