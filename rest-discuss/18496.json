Since then I have been wondering about how much such a form tells =\r\nmy program at *runtime*.\n\nFor this discussion I am focusing on HTML forms a=\r\ns we know them from the web. These includes:\n\n- Action URL\n- Encoding\n- Ope=\r\nration\n- Inputs\n\nAt runtime my program can parse the action URL, the encodi=\r\nng and the operation, and use these to dynamically create a HTTP request.\n\n=\r\nBut what about the input definitions (the actual payload)? Are they useful =\r\nat runtime? \n\nAt compile-time (or &quot;read the documentation time&quot;) the inputs=\r\n are useful for telling my program (the developer) which values to that cor=\r\nresponds to what. As the developer I can see that the name of the person mu=\r\nst be sent as &quot;PersonName=3Dxxx&quot;. But after this I don&#39;t see how the client=\r\n program can use the input definitions for anything at runtime.\n\nHave I ove=\r\nrlooked some nice features of using forms?\n\nOne could decide to publish the=\r\n identifiers for the input elements that is used. For instance saying that =\r\nthe input marked with id=3D&quot;name-of-person&quot; defines the name of the input f=\r\nor the person&#39;s name. Like this:\n\n  &lt;input id=3D&quot;name-of-person&quot; name=3D&quot;Pe=\r\nrsonName&quot;/&gt;\n\nBut I don&#39;t see how that really changes anything - its just on=\r\ne more indirection to follow.\n\nThanks, J=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
