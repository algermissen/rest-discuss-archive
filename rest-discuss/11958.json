Consolidating and formalising\nthat knowledge once it exists is also good.\n\nI would say that most of the time you should err on the side of\nusing well-established media types until you have a feel for the\nissue. “Innovating” in a vacuum is bad. It doesn’t help anyone.\nYou make your mistakes while flying blind because there are few\nimplementations at all ends and they all have to upgrade in lock\nstep. (How often do we have to learn the lesson that this is a\nrecipe for failure?)\n\nBut people with similar apps should occasionally sit down at a\ntable together and find out how they can standardise their\napproaches into a separate format. I didn’t read Dare’s post\nabout OpenSocial but from what I get from this thread, this is\nwhat happened there. This is good.\n\nThere is no correct dogma to answer the question of how specific\none’s media type should be. All options are valid, each with pros\nand cons, and you need to decide on a case-by-case basis which\nside to pick. This sort of tradeoff is what engineering is about\n(and REST is the closest we have to it in software development).\nSorry to the cookie cutter brigade. :-)\n\nIn passing, though, I have to note that it would be nice if we\ncould do a better job of what media types tried to do with their\ntype/subtype separation, ie. have a standardised way to specify a\nlayering of specifity of formats, including multiple formats, so\nthat it would be possible to say that a document is text, and\nspecifically HTML, and specifically a combination of hCard+hTag+\nhEXIF+image-link, and specifically a Flickr photo, so as to allow\nclients to know what the representation means without having to\nparse it, at whatever their level of understanding of the\nspecified format.\n\nI don’t know if this would work in practice, after all the\ntype/subtype thing in media types is mostly a failure. Maybe\nthat was just because of it tried to constrain types to just two\nlayers. It would also be necessary to do a better job of what\nmedia types tried to accomodate with the `+xml` suffix\ncontortion, ie. make sure that types reliant on possibly multiple\nlower-level formats are expressible in a sensible fashion.\n\nIf it did work, it would resolve the tradeoff issue nicely.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
