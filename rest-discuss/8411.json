This thread, along with Tim Ewald&#39;s recent blog post on REST and\nstate=\r\n machines has really clarified REST for me. At least I think it\nhas... Let =\r\nme try to sum up my current thinking as follows:\n\n    With REST, the API is=\r\n on the client.\n\nWhen you design a RESTful protocol, you aren&#39;t specifying =\r\nan interface\nto be exposed by the server. Instead the client conforms to a\n=\r\nhypermedia format that drives its behavior. An important part of this\nbehav=\r\nior is interacting with resources on the web (addressed by URIs)\nusing stan=\r\ndard methods of a transfer protocol. These interactions\nresult in the clien=\r\nt transitioning to another state by supplying it\nwith a new hypermedia docu=\r\nment to process. \n\nThe specific resources and methods that make up the serv=\r\ner-side\ninterface are not central to the protocol. It is only required that=\r\n\nthe responses to the interactions and their effect the resources\nconforms =\r\nto the constraints defined by the standard method definitions\nof the transf=\r\ner protocol. Thus, in a RESTful protocol, the contract\nbetween the client a=\r\nnd the server is limited to the constraints of the\nunderlying standard tran=\r\nsfer protocol. In addition to de-coupling the\nclient and server, it also al=\r\nlows for significant optimizations (e.g.\ncaching) to be implemented by the =\r\nclient and intermediaries.\n\nExisting, standardized RESTful protocols includ=\r\ne HTML (over HTTP), SVG\n(over HTTP), VoiceXML (over HTTP) and APP. (APP is =\r\nthe only protocol\nin this list that is not designed for driving a user inte=\r\nrface -- I&#39;m\nnot sure if there are others.)\n\nHave I got it?\n\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
