Yet, I need \nto customize the pages depending on dynamic content.  I&#39;m going to argue \nthat cookies are a good way to do this.\n\nSo, say I have a page displaying the weather.  When a browser GETs the \npage, I can deliver an HTML page that uses AJAX to retrieve the actual \ndata, and fill it into the form.  I have maximized cachability, since \nthe HTML page doesn&#39;t change.\n\nBut how does this work when I have a user session?  Let&#39;s say I have a \nbook site, and the user has a shopping cart.  Following John E.&#39;s \nsubject-verb-object paradigm, the session is the subject.  The content \nchanges according to the subject.  Am I doomed to just render all the \ncontent dynamically?\n\nOne way to handle this is to use cookies.  The user GETs a generic \nshopping cart page.  The page contains JavaScript which retrieves the \ncontents of the shopping cart, from a generic URL.  The response to the \nrequest for the shopping cart page does not depend on the subject.  But \nthe response for the request for the contents of the cart relies on the \ncookie.  Thus the shopping cart page can be cached, even if the contents \nof the cart can&#39;t (and they&#39;re dynamic, so who cares).\n\nCan this be done without cookies?  Suppose I try to encode the session \nID in the URL.  Then when the JavaScript retrieves the shopping cart \ncontents, it must use a different URL for each session.  That means that \nURL must be written into the shopping cart page, which means the \nshopping cart page must be unique for each session, which means the \nshopping cart page is no longer cacheable.  Whoops.\n\nDoes anyone else agree with this explanation as to why cookies are \nvaluable for cacheability?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
