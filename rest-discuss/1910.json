In fact, a general observation is in order:  the\nmechanism by which an operation or change in one part of a system of\ninteracting components causes operations or changes in another part, and the\ncombinatorics of those operations or changes changes, is the heart of\nsoftware architectural complexity.\n\nMy late-night research project over the last year - inspired by discussion\non FoRK and this list - has been an effort to come up with a generic and\nformal mathematical framework for characterizing and analyzing this kind of\ncomplexity.  It&#39;s nowhere near done yet, but it&#39;s been an interesting\nendeavor so far.  Current computer science gives us good tools for analyzing\nthe time and space complexity of algorithms, but no or poor tools for\nanalyzing software architectural complexity.\n\nMy hope is that if this research bears fruit it will provide us with good\ntools for that purpose;  my intuition, though I&#39;m not letting it bias the\nresearch, is that generic compositional frameworks (pure functional\ncomposition, UNIX-like dataflow composition, Linda-like coordination\nframeworks, REST) are quantifiably &quot;simpler&quot; in various ways than other\ncompositional frameworks (procedural composition with side-effects,\nobject-oriented composition.)\n\n$0.02,\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
