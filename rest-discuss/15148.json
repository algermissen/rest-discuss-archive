Can you point me to a system where CCXML is used like\n&gt; &gt; PHP? Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I stand corrected.  My PHP analogy wasn&#39;t meant to suggest that CCXML\n&gt; generates VoiceXML, but it does route calls to VoiceXML apps for\n&gt; handling, right?  VoiceXML doesn&#39;t need CCXML any more than HTML needs\n&gt; PHP.  But I thought CCXML mostly needed VoiceXML, just as PHP mostly\n&gt; needs HTML.

I think the best way to think about CCXML and VoiceXML is as\ncooperating markup languages. The CCXML processor can invoke the VoiceXML\nprocessor to handle a portion of the overall interaction. A good analogy\nmight be an Atom client that interacts with or invokes an HTML client to\ndisplay the content portion of the feed. CCXML doesn&#39;t typically embed the\nVoiceXML though -- usually it just contains a URI for an initial VoiceXML\npage. The processors could be part of the same client or distributed. RFC\n5552 would be one way that distributed processors could interact:\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5552#section-1.1.4 But from a REST\nperspective, you could think of them being part of a single distributed\nclient (well, more or less -- cookies can make that a bit challenging).\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\r\n--000325557e1eafeb8204839828e0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Apr 6, 2010 at 4:59 PM, Eric J. =\r\nBowman &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:eric@...&quot;&gt;eric@=\r\nbisonsystems.net&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n&quot;wahbedahbe&quot; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Eric J.
