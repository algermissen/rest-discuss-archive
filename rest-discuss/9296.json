So I clicked on http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html \n&gt; &lt;http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html&gt; to\n&gt; read more and, perhaps not surprisingly, found that it&#39;s pretty broken\n&gt; REST.\n\nIBM just published their similar HTTP interface to WebSphere MQ.\n\nhttp://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24016142\n\nSee the PDF, especially chapter 5 and 8 for the details regarding their \nuse of HTTP. Now, they don&#39;t claim to be RESTful, but they do seem to \ncare about being good HTTP citizens, examples such as: &quot;GET - Browses \nthe first message on a queue. In line with the HTTP protocol this does \nnot delete the message from the queue&quot;.\n\nHowever, there some obvious problems with the design (possibly due to \nsimplifying clients), most of which has already been discussed in this \nthread:\n* DELETE to retrieve a message is done on the queue URL\n* DELETE to browse a message is done on the queue URL\n* No support for retries if a POST or DELETE fails\n* A custom header (x-msg-format) that overrides Content-Type, not sure \nif this is really an issue\n* No description of how caching is handled. Examples does not contain \nany cache headers at all so I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s not supported at all.\n\nWhat do you think if their design, judging from this thread this seems \nto be an tricky area?\n\n/niklas\n\n\n"}}
