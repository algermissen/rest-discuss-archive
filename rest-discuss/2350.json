You can get more information from \nhttp://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/ or jump straight to the \ndocumentation at http://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/docs/\n\nBasically, the modifications are;\n\n - proper support for directories\n - added a &quot;relatedInformation&quot; element if there is any available\n - added an xlink attribute to relatedInformation and cachedVersion\n - bugfixes (especially on looping and maxResults &gt; 10)\n - ability to specify an XSLT stylesheet using the &quot;xsl&quot; querystring \nvariable, which allows you to do on-the-fly formatting\n\nAlso, if you are interested, XooMLe will feature in an upcoming \nO&#39;Reilly book which is still being written. At this stage, I think it \nis called &quot;Google Hacks&quot;, it&#39;s about the things that people have done \nwith the Google API since it was released, and should be a pretty \ngood read :)\n\nCheers, and thanks to everyone for their suggestions and feedback on \nXooMLe, please kep it coming if you have any more ideas for making it \nmore RESTful (or just more useful!)\n\nBeau\n(from DentedReality)\n\n\n"}}
