Conneg support in browsers is horrible.\nMozilla sends a static Accept header, no matter what the context,\nwhich enumerates all of the types it supports. I&#39;ve logged a bug[1]\nfor this (please vote for it if so inclined).\n\nIE seems to generate the Accept header based on the filename\nextension of the resource (EW!), and by default sends a header that\nincludes a lot of image/ types, a */* (which is a CUAP[2]), but no\nHTML.\n\nOf course, conneg is still useful to expose, but lack of support in\nbrowsers means that another means of doing this -- probably with\nquery strings (or maybe path parameters?) -- will have to be hacked.\n\n*sigh* \n\n\n[1] http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?bug_id=118696\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/cuap\n\n\nHmm... Bugzilla would be an excellent candidate for RESTification...\n\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
