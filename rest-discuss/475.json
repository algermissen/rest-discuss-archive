If you watch a resource that is a collection, either send a snapshot\n&gt; of the collection (which could be big - so you fragment via hyper-links like\n&gt; you mentioned) or don&#39;t send any details.\n\nSending deltas as an *optimization* sounds okay to me...they could be\ndeltas against a once-a-day golden version so that you can miss several\nmessages without running into problems. But the point is that you could\nalways discard the deltas and really sync up properly if you want.\n\n&gt; But what is the &#39;non-delta details&#39; that get sent - the result of applying\n&gt; the original http request, or a replay of the original http request?\n\nYou have this notion of the &quot;original http request&quot; that I am trying to\nwean you from. If I fire up vi through an ssh connection to edit a\ndocument, there is no original HTTP request. There is just a change. \nThe details that get sent would be up to the application. My only\nrequirements on them would be that a) the client can ignore them and not\nlose out on anything other than performance and b) the client can\nreceive them twice without worrying about corrupting its internal state\n(another problem with deltas if you aren&#39;t intelligent about saying WHAT\nyou are applying the delta to).\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
