I can only send\n&gt; information to it and the information goes into a black hole. That&#39;s\n&gt; against the REST philosophy. If email were designed according to REST\n&gt; then every email message would have a globally unique identifier and you\n&gt; would reply to a message by POSTing to the identifier (which you can&#39;t\n&gt; do with an SMTP unique identifer).\n\nYou could always create an HTTP service that\nprovides some data about any mailto uri, but I&#39;m\nnot sure why you would want to.\n\nIn any case, RFC822 says that every mail message\nshould have a globally unique identifier\n(message-id) and that replies should have\n&quot;in-reply-to: message-id&quot; in their headers.\n\nWhat is missing here?\n\n&gt; &gt; I think REST provides a philosophy. MIME-RPC\n&gt; &gt; provides a wire format.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right, REST is a philosophy. The wire format is already HTTP + MIME +\n&gt; XML. What does MIME-RPC add?\n\nAs I said before, in MIME-RPC, any MIME transport\nis the transport (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, etc).\nThe wire format is a MIME envelope wrapped\naround whatever makes the most sense for your\napplication (e.g. GIF, JPEG, or Flash rather than\nSVG).\n\nThe last one is important.  XML does not easily\nallow delivery of multiple XML documents or other\nopaque data types like graphics or MSOffice files.\nMIME is designed to do just that.\n\nIt appears to work very well for both email and\nthe web.\n\nMy question is What is REST?  What does it add?\nThere seems to be no definition only ostensive\ndescriptions.  Note: sending an XML document over\nHTTP is compliant with MIME-RPC.  I just think\nthat you frequently want to do more.\n\nI am actually beginning to think that MIME-RPC and\nREST are orthogonal.  You can use MIME-RPC in\nREST-style or not.  It is just that\nbecause MIME-RPC  allows people to do things in\nnon-REST style, some RESTers might object.\n\n&gt; &gt; Please define your use of RPC.  My use of RPC is\n&gt; &gt; simply that the recipient of the message is an\n&gt; &gt; application rather than a person.\n\n&gt; http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestFaq\n\nOk.  I read this and think we are in agreement.\nMIME-RPC does not require use of method names.  It\nreally just presumes that people are sending data\nstructures to one another.  In the spec, method\nnames and arguments are nothing more than\nelements of a struct.  If application developers\nwant to interpret that struct as a command, they\nare free to do so.  If they want to interpret it\nas a message advising them of something, that is\nok too.\n\nI think that MIME-RPC supports both REST and\nnon-REST styles.  I like REST style, I just don&#39;t\nthink I always want to use it and I think that\nfrequently people want a more easy to use\nabstraction of their code.  MIME-RPC supports them\neither way.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
