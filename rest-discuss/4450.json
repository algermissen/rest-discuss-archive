Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt; b) with POST to a generic resource and return the location of the stored \n&gt; input document.\n&gt;  - this would allow the use of GET, PUT and DELETE on the stored input \n&gt; document for management, but the client would have to remember the \n&gt; server generated location and maintain a mapping. Somewhat annoying.\n&gt;  - in order to get to the final merged document, the response would need \n&gt; to provide a reference to it. This means the representation has more \n&gt; information than what was submitted - another schema would be required \n&gt; (or a more flexible one).\n&gt;  - I&#39;m not concerned about the non-idempotent definition of POST, I can \n&gt; guarantee the server works in an idempotent manner (even if the client \n&gt; can&#39;t truly trust that across all services).\n\nI don&#39;t consider it that annoying that clients have to remember \nmappings.  When you design so that state is not stored on the server, \nnaturally it will have to be stored elsewhere-- it&#39;s part of the \nclient&#39;s job.\n\nIn any case, you can make this plan more robust as follows: when the \nserver creates a record for a new document, also store the digest of the \nrequest that caused it.  Then, if it receives a duplicate request from \nthe client, ignore it and return the exiting resource location.\n\nAlso, assuming that input documents are not shared, the server could \nprovide a query function that returns the output resource given an input \nresource URL.\n\n-John\n\n\n-- \nhttp://giftfile.org/  ::  giftfile project\n\n"}}
