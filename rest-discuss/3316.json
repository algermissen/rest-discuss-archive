However, I feel that the caching limitation only applies\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; intermediaries.  Otherwise, the verb would be practically useless.  You\n&gt; &gt; could certainly use a 303 as well, but the only advantage I see to\n&gt; &gt; that is\n&gt; &gt; allowing intermediaries to cache the response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey, Roy:  if you happen to read this, what is your take on this?  Is\n&gt; &gt; OPTIONS supposed to be non-cachable for everyone or just\n&gt; &gt; intermediaries?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is only non-cacheable by default.  Use cache-control to change that.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Web had a notion of external links, but nobody could agree on the\n&gt; HTTP syntax so it didn&#39;t make the cut.  WebDAV added properties.\n&gt;\n&gt; Adding a new header field to every GET response would increase latency\n&gt; for no benefit to the common case and only marginal benefit to the\n&gt; applications being discussed.  It is therefore more efficient to have\n&gt; the client request that information only when it is desired.\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
