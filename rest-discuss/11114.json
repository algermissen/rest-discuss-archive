Other\n&gt;  &gt; than the early blogging APIs being based on XML-RPC and eventually\n&gt;  &gt; evolving into AtomPub I don&#39;t really know why forms with well-known\n&gt;  &gt; query params aren&#39;t a a de-facto standard.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the query params are well known, what do you need the form\n&gt; for? \n\nEasy integration with a lot of deployed software.\n\n&gt; You really only need an annotated link, like a `rel`\n&gt; attribute on a generic link element or a special link element\n&gt; names, so that machine clients will know what to do with it, at\n&gt; which point they already know what to do with it without being\n&gt; told about each form field, because they have well-known names.\n&gt; All of which is the essence of AtomPub.\n\nAnd also the essence of opensearch, if I understand you properly.\n\n\n&gt; The other end of the question is application/x-www-url-encoded\n&gt; and whether it suffices as a wire format for an API. Sure; a bag\n&gt; of key-value pairs is a completely sufficient data structure to\n&gt; cover a huge range of use cases.\n\nMy suspicion is that it&#39;s to a Web Data API as a HashMap is to an OO API.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
