On\n&gt; the other\n&gt; hand, I think it makes good sense and would have liked it\n&gt; if 2616\n&gt; did define it in this manner.\n&gt; \n\nHmmm.. So, I&#39;m going to jump to the conclusion that it\nwould be ok to use a different header. E.g. - something\nlike &quot;X-Report-Location&quot;. :)\n\n&gt; Not necessarily.  It might make more sense for you to say\n&gt; that every\n&gt; resource under /report/ exists with empty state until\n&gt; such time as it&#39;s\n&gt; modified.  A Wiki could work like this.\n&gt; \n\nOk, I can see cases where one would represent the initial\nstate of resources as a 204. I&#39;ll keep that in mind. But in\nsuch cases, wouldn&#39;t the original response to a\n/reportmaker request be a 201 Created instead of a 202\nAccepted?\n\n\n&gt; Another option is 404, as that would acknowledge that the\n&gt; resource\n&gt; hasn&#39;t yet been &quot;created&quot;.  I&#39;ve used both 204 and 404\n&gt; depending upon\n&gt; the situation.  This feels more like a 404 to me though.\n&gt; \n\nUsing a 404 sounds like a good idea. But wouldn&#39;t this be\nconfusing for clients? That is, how can a client\ndifferentiate between the following cases?\n1. No report was created with this URI and nothing is in\nthe works.\n2. A report is in process for this address.\n\nWould providing a listing service\n(/inprogresslist?queryparams) be a viable solution?\n\nThanks,\nBen\n\n\n"}}
