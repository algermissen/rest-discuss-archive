It&#39;s called HTTP authentication. Anything involving personal, \n&gt;&gt; private data should require a username password combo to access. \n&gt;&gt; Presumably if someone e-mails their URL and username and password to a \n&gt;&gt; friend, they know what they&#39;re doing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately nobody likes HTTP auth because the only way to\n&gt; authenticate with it seems to be using that ugly browser-supplied popup\n&gt; box which you cannot format or provide links to help or &quot;forget your\n&gt; password?&quot; links or anything else. Looks like we are going to be stuck\n&gt; with cookies for a long time.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nHave you not heard of AJAX?\n\nbtw these issues have been discussed here a lot only just\nrecently.
