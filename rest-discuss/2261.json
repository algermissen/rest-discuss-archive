I have no primary interest in &quot;stupid math hypertext\ntricks&quot;, only in constructing minimal models to discriminate the\nproperties of REST.  My answer to &quot;why not just do the following?&quot;\nis because it sheds no light on RESTful use of POST.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Request:\n&gt; GET /squaring-resource?4\n&gt; \n&gt; Response:\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; \n&gt; 16\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;squaring-resource&quot; above is the (theoretically) open set of all\n&gt; possible squares.  We are just querying a subset of the resource.\n\nYes, this is an interesting view of resources that renders them looking\nmore like state space than processes.  To be more precise, the resource\nyou have above is the &#39;square&#39; relation with no constraint on its domain,\nand the parameter in the request is the domain constraint for the duration\nof the query.\n\nThis raises an interesting question for me: Are parameters to be considered\npart of the URI proper in all contexts?  Certainly for caching, the &quot;?4&quot; is\nan important part of the URI.  But is the requirement of URI opaqueness to\nclients, extending even to parameter lists, perhaps too strong? On the one\nhand, &#39;no&#39; because only resources are authoritative as to what are\nmeaningful\nparameters.  On the other hand, &#39;yes&#39; because in the case where a resource\nis in effect a relation (like your example above), it&#39;s not unthinkable that\nthe null set (No Content) be returned when the relation is a partial\nfunction and\nthere is no mapping for the given parameter.\n\n&gt; Or is this about avoiding RPC?  Or is this all about how to deal with\n&gt; containers and such?  I&#39;m just not sure any more.... :~&#92;\n\nAgain, in case it&#39;s not clear above, it&#39;s about *discriminating* RPC from\nREST, if indeed they are partitioned (I don&#39;t think they are).  If literal\ncontainer semantics and only container semantics were allowed for POST,\nthen I believe I would have no issues.  I also believe, however, that a\nbunch\nof &#39;RESTful&#39; implementations would go down in flames, so to speak.\n\nBut not to any sort of final RESTing place, alas.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
