What are you trying to\n&gt; accomplish?\n\nI&#39;d like (e.g.) to be able to make a resource such that references to\nthat resource result in redirects to another resource on another machine\nwith no coordination between the two machines.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know what you mean. Can IMAP do content-negotiation so that I can\n&gt; &gt; ask for a particular message in different content-types depending on the\n&gt; &gt; client?\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the purpose of multipart/alternative.  See\n&gt; RFC2046 sec. 5.1.4:\n\nIt isn&#39;t the same thing. The information producer has to generate all of\nthe types speculatively.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I don&#39;t think so.  Pick an application that works\n&gt; better for HTTP than IMAP. \n\nDoes IMAP even have a notion of non-authorized references that would\nallow me to reference public IMAP servers? Anyhow, I gave you an example\nabove.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Nothing stops you from exposing a view of your\n&gt; schema rather than your underlying schema.  If you\n&gt; do end up exposing your schema, you can always\n&gt; expose a view later when you change it.\n\nIt typically is not that easy in practice. You really need a rich,\nTuring complete, programmatic layer between outsiders and your databases\n-- much more than a view with some stored procedures. You need to be\nable to unify multiple data sources. So you would have to *implement*\nthe ODBC/SQL interface in code.\n\nEven relational companies do not push ODBC/SQL as a good middle-teir\nintegration so I\n\n&gt; Since there is a pretty direct mapping between\n&gt; resources and objects in table, I am not really\n&gt; sure what you are arguing here.\n\nThat ODBC/SQL is only intended to be an abstraction layer over\nrelational databases. Trying to make it a general purpose integration\nlayer for (e.g.) structured data and multiple data sources will be\npainful.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; The reason why HTTP and SMTP have been so\n&gt; succesful in letting people talk to one another is\n&gt; MIME.  No non-MIME transport protocol has been\n&gt; particularly successful.\n\nI will agree that this is yet another reason why the RPCs will probably\nfail...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
