Haven&#39;t we\nbeen down the road of stating that methods and media types need not be\nprotocol-layer concerns, before?  Looks like a new instantiation of SOA\nto me, more than REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the stated goals was to make it easier to bring a new API\n&gt; online (interfaces, documentation, clients, etc.) when a new service\n&gt; was rolled out.\n&gt;\n\nAssuming you&#39;re right in your assessment, haven&#39;t we heard this promise\nbefore, from SOA/WS-*?  All this tooling needed for code generation\nseems to me like its costs outweigh its benefits compared with REST,\nwhere even if it&#39;s less convenient to build, a system may still be\nrapidly developed with a text editor and knowledge of URI + HTTP + HTML\nthat &quot;just works&quot; without all the fancy enterprise doo-dads.\n\nIncessantly banging my anti-corporatized-REST drum,\nEric\n\n"}}
