Obviously, a\n&gt; &gt; RESTful system should not require a MOVE verb, and the\n&gt; &gt; operation can be carried out as follows (assume that the\n&gt; &gt; representation already exists):\n&gt;\n&gt; Can be, but server will lose information about the identity (think\n&gt; version history), and of course it&#39;s not efficient for large resources.\n&gt; Why not use MOVE?\n\nTwo reasons:\n\n1) MOVE isn&#39;t a REST method.\n\n2) Even if it were, you would still face the issue of how the client\nshould inform the server that a redirect is required. For example, it\nis easy to imagine a variant of my example where the representation is\nmoved to a different domain. There a MOVE would be of no use, as the\noriginal server has no control over the destination server. (imagine a\nblogger moving entries from one blog provider to another, but wanting\nredirects from the old addresses to the new).\n\nRegards,\nAlan\n\n"}}
