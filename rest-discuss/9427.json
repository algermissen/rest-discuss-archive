Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; [2007-07-04 03:40]:\n&gt; &gt;No it isn&#39;t. Stored does not &quot;very unambiguously&quot; mean\n&gt; &gt;&quot;replaced&quot;. With such abstract terms (&quot;store&quot;, &quot;replace&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;&quot;modify&quot;, &quot;update&quot; -- elsewhere in the spec, PUT is referred\n&gt; &gt;to as an &quot;updating&quot; method), only &quot;replaced&quot; very\n&gt; &gt;unambiguously means &quot;replaced&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s some disagreement here, which stems from the wording of\n&gt; the RFC.  But HTTP is not REST,\n\nHTTP is a protocol for REST applications.\n\n&gt; if we are discussing the semantics of PUT in REST terms\n&gt; (generic interface) then store means replace in RFC 2616 just\n&gt; like STOR means replace in RFC 765.\n\nA generic interface can be anything. A “uniform interface” has no\nparticular properties other than being uniform. HTTP provides the\nmeans to implement *a* particular uniform interface. The\nspecifics of the uniform interface defined by HTTP are described\nin RFC 2616 and nowhere else.\n\n&gt; &quot;REST does not restrict communication to a particular protocol,\n&gt; but it does constrain the interface between components, and\n&gt; hence the scope of interaction and implementation assumptions\n&gt; that might otherwise be made between components. For example,\n&gt; the Web&#39;s primary transfer protocol is HTTP, but the\n&gt; architecture also includes seamless access to resources that\n&gt; originate on pre-existing network servers, including FTP,\n&gt; Gopher, and WAIS. Interaction with those services is restricted\n&gt; to the semantics of a REST connector.&quot;\n\nThis is exactly what I’m saying.\n\n&gt; This tells me that a REST connector must understand that the\n&gt; semantics of GET equal the semantics of RETR, APPE=POST,\n&gt; DELE=DELETE, LIST=OPTIONS and STOR=PUT in order to meet the\n&gt; Uniform Interface constraint.\n\nErr. Yes, that is true if you are implementing a RESTful bridge\nto old protocols like FTP. It is not a universal truth about\nREST. Sorry.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
