The coupling created by making particular  \n&gt;&gt; URI patterns known to intermediaries for analytics and routing  \n&gt;&gt; seems to be a heavy trade off. Especially since once it is  \n&gt;&gt; established and figured out by the developers it will just spread  \n&gt;&gt; all over the place. I&#39;d go a long way to maintain URI opaqueness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Heavy tradeoff because it makes the business achieve its goals?\n\nNo, heavy trade off because the business goal could very easily (at  \nleast as far as your example goes) be achieved without introducing the  \ncoupling.\n\n&gt; These are operational requirements that most real-world HTTP  \n&gt; services deal with routinely.\n\nMight be - but I understand you to be saying those business goals  \ncould not be achieved without making use of shared knowledge about URI  \npatterns. I question that.\n\nAfter all, the value of REST lies in the style-induced, guaranteed  \nsystem properties and the short term price to be paid for that is  \nconsiderably high. *Maybe* you gain some near time business advantage  \nby breaking constraints but you are working against the long term goal  \nthat motivated the use of REST in the first place.\n\nI am all against architectural purity for its own sake but the call  \nfor business level goals that justify anything is far too often made  \ntoo quickly.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
