A simple &quot;method&quot;\nname seems like it would convey the exact same information. Is HEAD an\nextension method? It&#39;s defined in HTTP so I wouldn&#39;t think to call it that.\n\nDo query elements always represent the parts of the URI after the question\nmark? Even for POST? If so, that&#39;s why I was asking (in a previous message)\nif there could be separate input elements (form? variable?) for form\nvariables that can be POSTed (using multipart/form-data) to a resource.\n\nHow is it possible to have query outputs? Or is that a typo in the DTD?\n\nThe content model for documentation and appinfo should be ANY so that we\ncould include structured content. Personally, though, I would prefer if\nannotation&#39;s content model was ANY and there were no documentation or\nappinfo elements. The distinction that XML Schema makes between human and\nmachine readable annotations seems entirely arbitrary to me. XML makes\ncontent both human and machine readable at the same time!\n\nIt seems odd that representationType elements are contained by a\nresourceTypes element.\n\nYou have some example representationType elements with match attributes. The\nDTD says those should be called test.\n\nI still think that the match attribute on reference elements should be\nselect. XSLT&#39;s match attribute defines a pattern that (usually) gets checked\nas the processor recurses down the entire document. You could just as easily\nextract the same information, albeit more efficiently, if you used normal\nXPath expressions.\n\n&lt;representationType name=&quot;xslt&quot; media-type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;\n        match=&quot;/*[@xsl:version or @version]&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;reference name=&quot;includes&quot; match=&quot;*/xsl:include/@href&quot;\ntype=&quot;xsltResource&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;reference match=&quot;*/xsl:import/@href&quot; type=&quot;xsltResource&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/representationType&gt;\n\n(The * is there because XSLT document elements can be either xsl:stylesheet\nor xsl:transform.)\n\nIf you still want to scan the entire document you could always use an XPath\nlike &quot;//foo&quot;.\n\nA more realistic example for different representation types might be for the\ndifferent types of schemas that are out there:\n\n&lt;representationType name=&quot;xsd&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot;\ntest=&quot;xsd:schema&quot;&gt;\n &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&lt;/representationType&gt;\n&lt;representationType name=&quot;rng&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot; test=&quot;rng:*&quot;&gt;\n &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&lt;/representationType&gt;\n&lt;representationType name=&quot;sch&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot;\ntest=&quot;sch:schema&quot;&gt;\n &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&lt;/representationType&gt;\n\nYou say that WRDL doesn&#39;t care which representationType matches a\nrepresentation. Won&#39;t consumers of a WRDL-generated API want to know what\ntype of document was returned? Won&#39;t the WRDL-generated proxy want to know\nso that it could validate the representation? It seems like things would be\neasier all around if the first representationType that passed its XPath test\nwas the &quot;winner&quot;.\n\nCould you expound a little more on &quot;the built-in support for navigation\nthrough hyperlinks&quot;? I don&#39;t follow that. How is that used in the API?\n\nThanks,\nJason\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Paul Prescod\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com ; rael@...\nSent: Saturday, February 23, 2002 12:57 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Meerkat API in WRDL\n\n\nNew (rough!)
