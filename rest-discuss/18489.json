This\nseems to be the canonical RESTful collection where POST to the\ncollection URI creates the new resource and then PUT and DELETE to the\nresource URI updates and destroys it.\n\n2) Collections that represent relationships between resources (for\nexample the friends of a user). New relationships between resources\ncan be created with POST, but it&#39;s not clear how they should be\nremoved as the target resource should still exist, just no longer be\nreferenced.\n\n3) Collections that represent queues of references (for example a TODO\nlist for a user). This is more complicated as the collection is\nordered and so elements in arbitrary positions need to be added or\nremoved and again the target resources should not be deleted.\n\nIf anyone could point me to nice patterns for implementing 2 and 3 I&#39;d\nbe very grateful.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\n"}}
