XSLT transforms the Atom into XHTML\nmarked up with RDFa.  From that XHTML, the RDFa may be extracted into\nRDF using XSLT, that technology is called GRDDL.  For my wiki/weblog/\nforum system, RDF doesn&#39;t make sense as a storage medium, particularly\nas compared to Atom.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) i&#39;m curious about your use of RDF here. are you using an existing\n&gt; vocab as your main RDF serialization? have you defined a vocabulary\n&gt; explicitly? using adhoc rdf:Description elements?\n&gt;\n\nI have a vocabulary consisting of terms like wiki, weblog, forum,\narticle, comment and so forth.  Instead of formalizing a vocabulary\nfirst, I&#39;ve taken a path of allowing it to reveal itself organically as\nthe system is developed.  As of now, &#39;wiki&#39;, &#39;weblog&#39; and &#39;forum&#39; are\nexpressed as XSLT mode names -- I&#39;d never have gotten there if I&#39;d\nstarted by using OWL to formalize this ontology, and locked myself into\nmaking these terms XML elements.\n\nThese terms have everything to do with the display and behavior of the\nresulting website, but nothing to do with the underlying data, where\neverything is just an Atom Entry.  So the challenge for a domain-\nspecific RDF vocabulary, is to map these terms from the application\n(the XHTML executing in the browser) back to the data structures.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Is any part of your work available via open source? code? docs? etc.\n&gt; \n\nI set up the wiski.org domain to house various private-process, public-\ndomain work I need hosted.  Once my use of my own RDF vocabulary for\nContent Management Systems based on Atom stabilizes, I will publish the\nresults on wiski.org.  Then I will put it forth as an open standard\nthrough some other body, ceding control.\n\nThe same goes for the /date service.  Currently, it just converts UNIX\ntimestamps to Gregorian calendar dates.  Originally, it was intended to\nsupport historical dates, which turned out to be much harder than it\nsounded.  Eventually, /date will support historical dates properly,\nallowing service consumers to obtain non-Gregorian results, or multiple\nresults -- what date it was in Germany depended for a long time on what\nreligion you were, so neither Gregorian nor Julian is the &quot;correct&quot;\ncalendar for these dates.\n\nWhen the basic /date service framework is nailed down beyond any\npoints of contention between me and my partner, /date will be open-\nsourced, as global contribution will be required for what amounts to\ncultural (more so than language) translation, and the addition of\nholidays.  If you look hard enough, the code for /date and the node.js-\nbased httpd it runs on are available, and patches are accepted, but like\nthe rest of Bison Systems&#39; work it is not open-source at this time.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Is any part of your work available via open source? code? docs? etc.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ll post the link to my demo site again one of these days, for now you\ncan search for it or contact me off-list.  Whenever I publish the link,\nI get lots of bot hits, whereas since the last restart most of the\ninterest has been from actual people:\n\nServer : bison_nanoweb/2.2.9.1 (FreeBSD 7.2; PHP/5.2.9)\nStarted : Sun, 04 Apr 2010 01:44:58 GMT\nUptime : 54d, 14h, 22m, 20s\nMemory : 1867 KB\n\nTotal hits/connections : 9988/7869 (avg 0.13/m 0.00/s)\nTotal sent size : 9,890 KB (avg 0.13 KB/m 0.02 Kbit/s)\n\nHTTP responses statistics\n\n200 OK : 4230\n206 Partial Content : 11\n304 Not Modified : 2969\n400 Bad Request : 4\n404 Not Found : 2728\n416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable : 1\n500 Internal Server Error : 12\n501 Method Not Implemented : 32\n\nThose 500&#39;s weren&#39;t there the other day, I&#39;ll have to look into that.\nOnly GET and HEAD are implemented on the demo, so the 501&#39;s aren&#39;t\nunexpected, neither are the 404&#39;s due to all the dead links.\n\nThe proof of REST in general, and my approach in particular, is in the\npudding:  1KB/hit average with a 70% cache-hit ratio.  HTTP pipelining\nlooks to be yielding a 20% reduction in connection overhead.  Systems\nnot using REST are highly unlikely to even approach such numbers.\n\nAll my work on the demo is under the CC 3.0 attribution license, which\nworks out to &quot;if you use my vocabulary you must use my namespace&quot; in\npractice.  Same goes with any media types on wiski.org -- if you use\nthem, don&#39;t change the media-type identifiers.  To my mind, an XML\nnamespace satisfies attribution for most potential re-use of my work.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
