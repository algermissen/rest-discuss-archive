Quite a few people do seem to think that URI \ndesign has much more direct importance to REST than it does, and while \nit&#39;s reasonable for people interested in REST to ALSO be interested in \nURI design, and hence to end up discussing it here, it&#39;s perhaps harmful \nto have such an emphasis on it that we muddy the waters further.\n\n"}}
