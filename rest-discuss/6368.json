I&#39;ve found it pretty easy to generate the same\n &gt; &gt; authentication headers from application code and webserver\n &gt; &gt; configurations. I&#39;ve done this in PHP, Python, and CGI without too\n &gt; &gt; much difficulty. Seems like a no-brainer choice.\n &gt;\n &gt; I think it is not the problem to generate HTTP auth, but to handle it.\n &gt; But I\n &gt; might be wrong. On the server side I have a Tomcat handling the\n &gt; requests in\n &gt; a servlet derived from HttpServlet. There I have a HttpServletRequest\n &gt; object\n &gt; representing the HTTP request. My understanding so far was that HTTP\n &gt; auth is\n &gt; handled before I get the chance to react upon it in my servlet. I thought\n &gt; that the servlet container (Tomcat) handles HTTP auth before it calls my\n &gt; servlet.\n\nI believe it can be configured either way, and potentially differently \ndepending on the URL path.  Our application handles all authentication \ninside Tomcat except for certain paths, for example.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
