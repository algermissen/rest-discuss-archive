Since each request is just like a normal one\nwith the addition of a link to the transaction resource, each\nrecipient completely understands the current request even if they\nare a different server than the one that handled the prior request.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me that either:\n&gt;\n&gt; (a) Each transaction contains the states of the various resources\n&gt;     within it;\n&gt;\n&gt; or:\n&gt;\n&gt; (b) Each resource contains different states for different\n&gt;     transactions itself.\n\nI think you are mixing representation and resource state with the\nconcept of stateless messages -- they are entirely different topics.\nFor example, PUT is a way of creating a named state on the server,\nbut the message is stateless.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
