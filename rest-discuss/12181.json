It seems fraught with all the\nsame contrac=\r\nt versioning issues as WSDL, DCOM, etc. Knowledge and\nmeaning are continual=\r\nly evolving products of the dynamic social context\nwithin which they exist,=\r\n and that fact surely needs to be addressed in\nany workable content binding=\r\n approach...\n\nIn REST terms, concepts can obviously be modelled as URI-addr=\r\nessable\nresources and published in different representation formats. For\nex=\r\nample, the location concept &quot;London, UK&quot; can be modelled as a resource\nwith=\r\n the address http://dbpedia.org/resource/London and then published\nin repre=\r\nsentation formats including RDF, N3, KML, GeoRSS, etc. However I\nam unsure =\r\nhow the self-describing message and HATEOS constraints\ntranslate in this co=\r\nntext? The best I can come up with is that the\nDBpedia, Freebase, OpenCyc o=\r\nntologies should be viewed as the knowledge\nrepresentation equivalents of s=\r\ntandard MIME types (or metamedia types?),\nand that hypermedia should be use=\r\nd for runtime binding to the immediate\nsibling nodes of a concept within th=\r\nose standard ontologies (thereby\navoiding the versioned contract binding ni=\r\nghtmare). Any approach like\nthat would make me feel a lot more comfortable =\r\nthat just tagging stuff\nwith DBpedia URIs, which seems to violate a whole r=\r\naft of basic\narchitectural principles e.g. encapsulation and separate of\nin=\r\nterface/implementation.\n\nTo my (clearly limited) mind, these seem like real=\r\nly important questions\nand I don&#39;t think they are receiving enough consider=\r\nation in linked\ndata/semantic web circles at present?\n\nregards\n\nJulian\n\n\n\n-=\r\n----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Simon Reinhardt\nSent: 03 March 2009 15=\r\n:58\nCc: Rest List\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] This is REST\n\nSolomon Duskis =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; Craig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;rel&quot; seems like a good start and I think=\r\n\nthat \n&gt; building on that idea can lead to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; compli=\r\nant \n&gt; RESTful application.  I think it may be a problem that may be solved=\r\n \n&gt; with an &quot;As Simple As Possible,&quot; well known media-type plus a guide on\n=\r\n\n&gt; how to develop &quot;rel&quot; dictionaries.\n\nThis is basically what RDF provides:=\r\n a common data model (and a bunch of\ndefined formats for it) and a simple, =\r\ndistributed way for defining your\n&quot;rel&quot; values, encouraging you to re-use t=\r\nhe ones defined by others so\nthat a Web service client needs less built-in =\r\nknowledge about your\nservice.\nAnd Linked Data [1] is all about taking one e=\r\nntry point and traversing\nthe data Web from there dynamically by following =\r\nthe links provided\n(choosing those which have a &quot;rel&quot; type that matches you=\r\nr intentions).\nLinked Data is mainly about linking up open data of course b=\r\nut its\nprinciples can easily be applied to closed applications which, I thi=\r\nnk,\nwould benefit from that.\nJust one way of doing it, but I more and more =\r\nthink that the ideas\nbehind Linked Data and REST overlap largely. :-)\n\nRega=\r\nrds,\n  Simon\n\n[1] http://linkeddata.org/\n\n\n--------------------------------=\r\n----\n\nYahoo!
