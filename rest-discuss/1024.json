Using this, you can implement\nyour\n&gt; own dispatcher in the form of a servlet. It just needs some URL base\nmapped\n&gt; to it. You could (I believe) have the dispatcher invoke JSPs.\nThe standard mechanism for mapping paths to servlets is conceptually broken.\n\nFrom the servlet 2.3 spec (in web friendly PDF) on the JCP site:\nhttp://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr053/servlet23_PFD.pdf\n&quot;If the last node of the url-path contains an extension (.jsp for example),\nthe servlet container will try to match a servlet that handles requests for\nthe extension. An extension is defined as the part of the path after the\nlast &#39;.&#39; character.&quot;\n\nThe section is ambigous about handling urls of the form\n&quot;/a/b/foo.xap/x/y/z&quot; - it implies that &quot;/a/b/foo.xap&quot; must be registered\nwith the servlet container (often via a manually edited text file). I was\ngoing for any number of *.xap files on disk.\n\nI&#39;ve never met an ASP/JSP programmer that cared in the least what this meant\nfor their larger design. They didn&#39;t notice that relative URLs aren&#39;t\npossible and the server has to compute static text constantly.\n\nThe dispatcher that I wrote a few years ago was a servlet. It handled files\nwith an extension of .xap (xml application page) anywhere in a URI path. The\n&#39;extra path info&#39; that many web server environments provides became\nunavailable after a certain version of the servlet specification (it was\nworking earlier). You can find the code at http://xml.apache.org/xang/ (the\ndispatching framework in that project geared writing servlets in a &#39;resource\nmodeling&#39; fashion, it also did some rpc-ish stuff but after actually\nbuilding stuff with it, I moved away from custom verbs into a minimal common\nset - hence my interest in rest)\n\n\n&gt; And for ASP, AFAIK you&#39;d have to implement an ISAPI filter to do this,\nwhich is\n&gt; not trivial and is beyond the skill set of the typical web developer.\nNah, implementing ASP is easy, its a file format after all.\n - parse text into script sections\n - load up JavaScript engine (Rhino is really good, FESI is okay too)\n - provide java objects that implement MS&#39;s Request and Response interfaces\n - provide some global functions/classes like ActiveXObject(&quot;classId&quot;)\n - ignore the existing body of COM objects and just use Java class\nidentifiers instead.\n\nBut it doesn&#39;t matter because ASP/JSP is just wrong anyways (mixing\nuser-agent specific ui with data access as code).\n\n\n\n"}}
