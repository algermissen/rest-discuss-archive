My instinct is that application\nproviders should provide distinct login entry\npoints.\n\nAnyone else have an opinion here?\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 5 Mar 2003, Chuck Hinson wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; S.

The resource is NOT Chuck\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hinson&#39;s bank account - the resource is &#39;my&#39; bank account with &#39;my&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;being whoever is accessing it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That is sophistry.  Most charitably, I would refer\n&gt; &gt;you to all the people who want URL&#39;s for the\n&gt; &gt;different variants produced in\n&gt; &gt;content-negotiation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But I think that authentication is very different\n&gt; &gt;from content negotiation.  The notion that mailing\n&gt; &gt;the URL of a WSJ article means something different\n&gt; &gt;from mailing the URL of a bank savings register is\n&gt; &gt;a little odd.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Using HTTP-auth for customization is abusive.\n&gt; &gt;Now, I can define all sorts of resources\n&gt; &gt;parametrized by username password.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Rather than adding a id=thingid to the query\n&gt; &gt;string.  In the future, I can simply pass thingid\n&gt; &gt;in the username...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I respectfully disagree, and I&#39;ll leave it at that.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;-Alex-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;S.
