If there&#39;s a better alternative, totally +1.\n\nAlso, RDDL renders as XHTML - so the user agent could even render it to a \nhuman if needed.\n\n&gt; Some questions come to mind:\n&gt; \n&gt; How does this work for mixed XML content? What is the appropiate media \n&gt; type for an XHTML document containing RDFa that uses OWL? What should \n&gt; the user agent assume for all possible media types such content might be \n&gt; served as? What should the RDDL say about such content that is suitable \n&gt; for human-readbable as well as machine-processable options?\n\nThe RDDL natures that would be mandatory for a given data type would have \nto be specified by that data type definer.\n\nWhile the idea of a generic user agent (ala browser) that can process any \ndata type to its fullest extent is cool, IMO its not practical. We also \nhad this idea of having a parent type notion .. so the RDDL would have a \nrequired nature where you&#39;d have to say what the parent type is - which \nallows generic processing by a generic UA. (And the idea was to restrict \nthat parent type set to a reasonable subset of &quot;standard&quot; media types .. \nnot that it too could point to another one of these data types!) So \nbasically, a generic UA could try to do something with the stuff it \nunderstands, or, give up and look up the parent type and treat the content \nas being of that type.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t solve the mixed content problem but it does provide a way to \nsolve it (below).\n\n&gt; IOW, it seems XML+namespaces blow a hole in the media type approach, as \n&gt; do mixed models. I&#39;ve been waiting for years for someone to explain how \n&gt; this isn&#39;t a gap in the architecture.\n\nI agree .. the only thing this allows is to easily and cheaply introduce a \nnew media type that is documented as &quot;this contains stuff from this and \nthat&quot;. Not really a solution, but at least the information is fully captured.\n\nSanjiva.\n-- \nSanjiva Weerawarana, Ph.D.\nFounder & Director; Lanka Software Foundation; http://www.opensource.lk/\nFounder, Chairman & CEO; WSO2, Inc.; http://www.wso2.com/\nMember; Apache Software Foundation; http://www.apache.org/\nVisiting Lecturer; University of Moratuwa; http://www.cse.mrt.ac.lk/\n\nBlog: http://sanjiva.weerawarana.org/\n\n"}}
