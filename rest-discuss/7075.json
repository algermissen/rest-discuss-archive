So does that make it inappropriate to ask on\n&gt; REST-discuss?\n\nNot particularly.\n\nBut we are getting down an alley.\n\n\n&gt; So my question was really &quot;How to you programmatically update the DNS?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So I guess PowerDNS it to what you refer?\n&gt; http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/pdns\n&gt; That probably means hosting your own DNS.  I was hoping to find reasonable\n&gt; priced services that provided a REST intereface for updating DNS.\n\nAh I see. I wasn&#39;t clear about that.\n\nI can setup a programmatic DNS for you if you really want one (based\non pdns).\n\nLet&#39;s sketch out an API right now:\n\nEndpoint: domains.tfnet.co.uk\n\n\nCreate a new domain:\n\n  POST /\n  content: form-urlencoded\n  name:          the domain name (required)\n  hostmaster:    hostmaster email address (required, validated)\n  default-ttl:   what it says (optional)\n\n  responses:\n\n  201 with Location: domain...\n  500 with error message\n\n(note I don&#39;t do updating DNS so you&#39;d have to register the domain\nwith someone else and then create it in my db)\n\n\nGet the domain records:\n\n  GET /&lt;domain&gt;\n  where &lt;domain&gt; comes from the Location header response to the domain\n  creation.\n\n  responses:\n  404 if the domain doesn&#39;t exist\n\n  200 with HTML UL list of records, eg:\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;cname&quot;&gt;somehost&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nCreate a new record:\n\n  POST /&lt;domain&gt;\n  where &lt;domain&gt; comes from the Location header response to the domain\n  creation.\n\n  content: form-urlencoded\n  name:         the record reference\n  type:         CNAME, A, etc...\n  content:      the record data\n\n  responses:\n  404 if the domain doesn&#39;t exist\n\n  201 if the host was created, Location header points to a domain page\n  with fragment id pointing to the record\n\n\nEdit record:\n\n\n  PUT /&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;recordname&gt;\n  where &lt;domain&gt; comes from the Location header response to the domain\n  creation\n  and &lt;recordname&gt; is the, errr... record name\n\n  same content as for the record creation.\n\n  responses:\n  404 if the record/domain doesn&#39;t exist.\n  200 on success.\n\n\nDelete a record:\n\n  DELETE /&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;recordname&gt;\n\n  responses:\n  404 if the record/domain doesn&#39;t exist.\n  200 on success.\n\n\nI could knock this up for you quite quickly if you want it.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
