See for instance http://b=\r\nitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html#collection_resource where POST/PUT=\r\n/DELETE is defined for AtomPub\n\nThis seems more and more like re-inventing =\r\nthe exact reason for having media types - but hiding/tunneling it inside so=\r\nme generic format like application/xml.\n\nYou are right in the way that, yes=\r\n, it can be done. But there should be no need for it when the same thing ca=\r\nn be done with a properly defined media type.\n\nIf you build your applicatio=\r\nn on top of HTTP, using it only for transport of data and using only predef=\r\nined domain-agnostic formats like application/xml, then, yes, you would hav=\r\ne to put the domain specific semantics &quot;somewhere else&quot;.\n\nIf, on the other =\r\nhand, you accept HTTP as an application protocol, then you can use the medi=\r\na type for defining your semantics.\n\nBut, apparently there are different vi=\r\news of HTTP as an application protocol or a simple data transfer layer?\n\n/J=\r\n=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
