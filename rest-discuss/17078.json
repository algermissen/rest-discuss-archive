Ok. But these M2M clients that are =\r\nkeying off of the id values etc. (which one can argue is &quot;out of band knowl=\r\nedge&quot; -- but it is questionable) can&#39;t interact with ANY service that is si=\r\nmilarly designed using the same media type.\n\nThe issue is this: the meaning=\r\n of the id values is described in the HTML you are serving, but is really o=\r\nnly readable by a human being who is doing the coding. It is an odd sort of=\r\n &quot;out of band&quot; -- it is sort of like a signal embedded within a signal. But=\r\n the client itself is not picking up the extra signal -- the human being de=\r\nveloping (not using) the client is. I still consider it out of band but see=\r\n how this is debatable.\n\nTo me your example, while hard to argue against, s=\r\ntill doesn&#39;t yield the benefits I&#39;d like to see from a RESTful m2m system. =\r\nWith your methodology, I still can&#39;t write a single client that a wide rang=\r\ne of services can be targeted against. I write a client to your v1 system w=\r\nith the benefit that it will still work when you upgrade to v2 -- it is a n=\r\nice benefit but still not the end goal that at least I am shooting for.\n\nI =\r\nkeep hearing that what I&#39;m targeting is not possible -- thing is I know tha=\r\nt it is, because I&#39;ve done it for specific use cases. The problem is boilin=\r\ng it down to the key essential, generic methodologies that apply across dom=\r\nains. I&#39;m continuing to plug away at it when I have time though...\n\nAndrew\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
