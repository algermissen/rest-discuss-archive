The\n&gt; problem is that the color attributes are user generated. So sometimes\n&gt; we get arguments like: &quot;blue/light blue&quot; &quot;red/pink&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; When we build the URI based on that, we get stuff like:\n&gt;\n&gt; /search/shoes/colors/blue;red/pink;silver/\n&gt;\n&gt; We tried URL encoding, converting the URL to:\n&gt;\n&gt; /search/shoes/colors/blue;red%2Fpink;silver/\n&gt;\n&gt; But it looks like JBoss automatically decode the %2F back to /,\n&gt; before it calls our java layer (we are using JBoss and java in the\n&gt; backend to parse the url). So we get a 404 not found error message.\n&gt; We noticed something simmilar with apache.\n&gt;\n&gt; A workaround was to double-encode the slash string, so the first\n&gt; automatic, unwanted dencoding of JBoss wouldn&#39;t convert it back to /\n&gt; before passing it to the Java application.\n&gt;\n&gt; That seems to work, but I was wondering if anybody else runs in the\n&gt; same problem before, and if there is a better way to fix it without\n&gt; having to double url encode slashes.\n&gt;\n\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
