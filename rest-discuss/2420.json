I didn&#39;t recognize those terms as characterizing this\n&gt; example.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   DELETE /foo   =&gt;  200 OK\n&gt; &gt;   DELETE /foo   =&gt;  404 Not Found\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder, but I can&#39;t find anything in 2616 which says that a DELETE\n&gt; on a non-existent resource has to return 404.  I also can&#39;t find\n&gt; anything that suggests that a 200 response is wrong.\n\nTrue, but consider this sequence,\n\n  DELETE /foo   =&gt;  200 OK\n  GET /foo      =&gt;  404 Not Found\n  DELETE /foo   =&gt;  200 OK (Huh??? Wasn&#39;t /foo gone just a moment ago ?)\n\n&gt; So perhaps DELETE is just under-defined?\n\nPerhaps, but I don&#39;t think 200 would be the right way to fill out the \ngap in this case.\n\n&gt; Are there other examples that demonstrate this issue that don&#39;t use\n&gt; DELETE?  Conditional PUTs maybe?  Dunno.\n\nWell, anything where you&#39;d expect to get a different response on the \nfirst request than on a second or subsequent request. Actually if the \nfirst PUT creates a new resource the request doesn&#39;t even need to be \nconditional to get something similar,\n\n  PUT /foo      =&gt;  201 Created  (this is a MUST in 9.6)\n  PUT /foo      =&gt;  200 OK       (this is a SHOULD)\n\nGiven that this behavior isn&#39;t underspecified, PUT is probably a better \neg. than DELETE.\n\n&gt; &gt; Does your client stack implement request piplining? If it does,\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s presumably somewhere where a decision has to be made about\n&gt; &gt; whether to pipeline a request immediately or wait for pending\n&gt; &gt; responses to arrive. I played cautious and only allowed piplining\n&gt; &gt; for GET and then only if the only pending responses were for GETs.\n&gt;\n&gt; We only block on non-idempotent methods (POST).\n\nSo unless I&#39;m missing something you&#39;re treating all sequences of \nidempotent requests as idempotent sequences? In which case how do you \ninterpret that passage from RFC 2616, 9.1? (seeing as you&#39;re ignoring \nit ;-)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
