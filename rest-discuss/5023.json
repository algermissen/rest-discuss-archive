Does anyone know off hand whether WHAT- \n&gt; WG or other improve-HTML initiative has PUT/DELETE for forms and/or  \n&gt; some kind of proposal for using verbs correctly for common cases like  \n&gt; this on their radar?\n\nI know that some people fought tooth and nail to have wider verb/method\nsupport in XForms. It has also been an issue in the development of Atom.\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=xforms+OR+atom+put+delete\nhttp://www.dehora.net/journal/2004/01/jabber_and_alternate_rest_architectures.html\nhttp://www.dehora.net/journal/2004/02/web_idiocy_put_post_j2me_atom_and_reliable_messaging.html\n\n&gt; Has anyone even informally proposed potential  \n&gt; spec enhancements that would provide this kind of functionality? I&#39;ll  \n&gt; go dig and see what I can find out...\n\nThe first thing to be done is make XMLHttpRequest support any method in\nthe method field. There is no reason for the API to put an artificial\nconstraint on the field; if its syntactically correct (according to the\nBNF in the HTTP RFC), it should just use it, and don&#39;t make any judgment\nabout semantics.\n\nAfter that, WHATWG forms support would be the way to go. To me a\nhyperlink\n(such as underlined blue text) should mean GET, and anything else should\nbe\na button. &quot;Buttons change things, links don&#39;t, and are therefore safe.&quot;\nTo\nmake this work for developers, it needs to be as easy to put a button in\na\nHTML page as it is to type &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;.\n\nI appreciate your evangelism efforts thus far; keep up the good work.\n\n"}}
