REST goes further and constrains application state\n&gt; &gt; (not resource state) to be held on the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;ve always assumed that this\n&gt; additional constraint is a constraint on application semantics.  That\n&gt; is, that a RESTful application semantic may not punt application\n&gt; state.  So &quot;LOGIN&quot; wouldn&#39;t be a permitted semantic, because even though\n&gt; a LOGIN message may be semantically self-contained (and uniform even),\n&gt; it defers the maintenance of some application state (whether you&#39;re\n&gt; authorized or not) to the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that right?  Does this additional constraint impact anything else?\n\n\nAfter reading carefully, I&#39;m not sure I can discern any additional\nconstraint in the above.  I&#39;m starting with the assumption that without\n&quot;application state&quot; there is no application.  Moving from there, if\neach request is self-contained in that the server can interpret it\nadding only universal standards, then by process of elimination there\nmust be some conversational state maintained by the client, because\nthere&#39;s not other place it can be.  And if the client doesn&#39;t maintain\nthat state, then there is no application, just an isolated iteraction.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n--Walden\n\n\n"}}
