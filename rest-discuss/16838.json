You&#39;ve got a be=\r\nef - clearly.  I&#39;m\n&gt; trying to help you understand that your beef really is=\r\nn&#39;t with\n&gt; &quot;marshalling&quot; - a factual necessity - it seems to be with develo=\r\nper&#39;s\n&gt; lazy out of the box JAXB JavaBean-to-XML object serialization.\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nMe just being me, tends to fool people into thinking I have beeves when\nI d=\r\non&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been very careful to discuss confusion surrounding\nterminology,=\r\n rather than staking out a &quot;JAX-RS considered harmful&quot;\nposition.  I appreci=\r\nate your helping me to work through this, but I\nalso think there are lesson=\r\ns to be learned (given that this *is* rest-\ndiscuss) by analyzing where, wh=\r\ny and how folks wind up somewhere other\nthan REST when using frameworks cra=\r\nfted specifically to support REST.\n\nCase in point, is that so many folks ar=\r\ne apparently misappropriating\nthe terminology that I&#39;ve been misled by read=\r\ning them, a la REST=3DCRUD,\ninto believing (for example) that marshalling i=\r\ns what people do when\nthey don&#39;t understand the hypertext constraint.  Usin=\r\ng the same term\nwhich in WS-* meant &quot;serialize to SOAP&quot; may mean that it&#39;s =\r\npreferable\nto avoid the term in framework documentation, to avoid such conf=\r\nusion.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I won&#39;t again say you&#39;re confused:)  I&#39;ll instead say you&#39;ve l=\r\natched\n&gt; on to a term &quot;marshalling&quot; and projected upon it way too much mean=\r\ning.\n&gt;\n\nWell, that, or I adopted the meaning that&#39;s most prevalent in the\nm=\r\naterial I&#39;ve read -- which means it&#39;s others who have projected too\nmuch, o=\r\nr an incorrect, meaning onto the term in their own confusion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s als=\r\no poor inductive reasoning.  You&#39;ve observed that folks using\n&gt; JAX-RS to d=\r\no simple objective serialization (a la JAXB) and you&#39;ve\n&gt; apparently conclu=\r\nded that therefore all folks using JAX-RS must do\n&gt; simple object serializa=\r\ntion.\n&gt;\n\nIf I thought that, I would&#39;ve staked out &quot;JAX-RS considered harmfu=\r\nl&quot; as\nmy position, instead of the position that the terminology is leading\n=\r\nfolks astray (for whatever reason), and is best avoided by those trying\nto =\r\nlearn.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The truth is, JAX-RS as with most so-called REST Frameworks are=\r\n tools\n&gt; that *can* support RESTful services but can also lead to bad\n&gt; imp=\r\nlementations.  That&#39;s not necessarily the fault of the framework.\n&gt;\n\nNo, yo=\r\nu&#39;re right -- it could result from the documentation and articles\nabout the=\r\n frameworks.  Four to five years ago, there was no such thing\nas a REST fra=\r\nmework, now they&#39;re myriad, but we&#39;re still in the first\ngeneration.  Movin=\r\ng forward, there&#39;s some value to examining the\nreasons why the appearance o=\r\nf these frameworks hasn&#39;t really led to\nmore examples of honest-to-gosh RES=\r\nT in the wild.  I kinda thought they\nwould...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, most Jersey=\r\n code that&#39;s around me is using ROME to\n&gt; produce Atom but it&#39;s pretty clos=\r\ne to this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2008/02/05/integrating-jersey-=\r\nand-abdera\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t describe an anti-pattern - its simply factual=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; describes how an Object-Oriented language (like Java) does these\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; things. =A0You seem pretty opinionated on Java frameworks but yet\n&gt; &gt;&gt; d=\r\non&#39;t come across as a Java programmer?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t know Java. =\r\n=A0But that&#39;s irrelevant to the point I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; making, which is that JAX-RS =\r\ncontains terminology which has\n&gt; &gt; everything to do with Java and nothing t=\r\no do with REST.\n&gt; &gt; =A0Personally, Java cost my project years, and was a mi=\r\nstake to\n&gt; &gt; pursue -- I am not an enterprise.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d suggest that your l=\r\nack of experience with Java and JAX-RS is\n&gt; limiting your ability to provid=\r\ne a useful critique on the subject.\n&gt;\n\nPerhaps.  OTOH, the OP didn&#39;t give u=\r\ns much in the way of details about\nhis project or experience, so I decided =\r\nnot to make any assumptions\nabout that, or why he thinks a Java-based frame=\r\nwork is the way to go.\nGiven that he may indeed be new to both REST and Jav=\r\na, I feel my advice\nwas spot-on -- if, given my knowledge and experience, I=\r\n can&#39;t relate\ndiscussions of JAX-RS to REST, what hope is there for someone=\r\n new to\nthe field to succeed in bringing a system to market that way?\n\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n   Architecture               - &gt;         Implementation\n&gt; Uniform Interfac=\r\ne          - &gt;   @GET, @POST, etc.\n&gt; Resources manipulated - &gt;   @ProducesM=\r\nime, @ConsumesMime\n&gt; through representations\n&gt; URI                         =\r\n     -&gt;    @Path\n&gt; Hypermedia                   -&gt;  @Ref, @Produces, etc.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\nWell, yeah, on this level it makes sense.  But when the discussion\nturns =\r\nto implementation, there&#39;s a whole world of terminology that\nsimply isn&#39;t e=\r\nncountered in REST, outside of Java -- terms I&#39;m familiar\nwith outside of R=\r\nEST, applied in a way that doesn&#39;t make sense to me\nwithin REST.  As I&#39;ve s=\r\naid, the terminology seems to bring the WS-*/SOAP\nparadigm along with it, w=\r\nhich is why I challenged the notion of using\nJava, JAX-RS or frameworks in =\r\ngeneral, as a starting point.  Frameworks\nare HTTP libraries mistaken for R=\r\nEST libraries, as if REST&#39;s constraints\nmay be abstracted away as easily as=\r\n generating cache headers (which may\neventually be the case, but we&#39;re nowh=\r\nere near that today).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; You get the idea.  It&#39;s not perfect, but the too=\r\nls are there to\n&gt; support an implementation that lives within the REST cons=\r\ntraints.\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m comfortable enough with Java not to notice Java-ish\n&gt; =\r\nterminology but when read the guide:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://jersey.java.net/nonav/docu=\r\nmentation/latest/user-guide.html#d0e2522\n&gt; \n&gt; ... I think they&#39;ve done a pr=\r\netty good job at sticking to the\n&gt; resources, representations, URI, etc. sp=\r\neak.\n&gt; \n\nOK, thanks for the links, I&#39;ll go read them now, with an eye towar=\r\nds\nfiguring out where the disconnect lies -- such that when it comes time\nt=\r\no document my own solution, I don&#39;t fall into the same traps and see my\nown=\r\n work horrifyingly used to recast SOAP.  :-0\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
