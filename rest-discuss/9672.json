And, if you want to treat them \ndifferently, there&#39;s also a few 2Xx responses after a POST/PUT that \nmight encourage a client to go back to the server.  HEAD and OPTION \nusually imply a future trip to the server, too.  Also, in the case of a \nGET, the first trip is pretty lightweight; headers only.  Similarly, \nform-based links  that allow compliance with HATEOAS (God, I hate that \nterm) requires an extra trip.  Want to look up a person?  Can you \nconstruct a link, e.g., http://example.com/users?first_name=&quot;Stefan&quot; ?  \nNot without, getting a form first.  Finally, 303s mean a cache can store \nless information, and perform the redirection on the server&#39;s behalf.  \nUltimately, though, circumstances will help you decide whether the \nexpense of a 303 outweighs simply returning the resource.\n\n-- Pete\n\n"}}
