The major problem with this though, is\n&gt; that a software agent wouldn&#39;t know whether a web site was following\n&gt; these rules, or if they just happened to have a page named /contact.\n\nThe problem and solution are both the same in the Web case and in the local\noperating system file structure case.  How, when I run a script on a machine,\ncan I be sure that /proc is the process psuedofile system and not a directory\nthat just happened to be named /proc?  In the OS case, it&#39;s because I can\nsomehow obtain, hopefully programatically, some assurance that the\nenvironment conforms to some standard --- in this case, I can tell I&#39;m\nrunning on (say) Plan 9 and therefore can expect /proc to be organized in and\nbehave a certain way, the &quot;standard&quot; defined by Plan 9.  In the Web case, one\nassumes there would be some resource supported by the site which would\nindicate that it conformed to\n\n    http://directory.nameschemes.com/SemNameCore/2002\n\nor whatever.\n\n&gt; It is absolutely key that names not be standardized, because it means\n&gt; that there has to be some central authority that ensures that names\n&gt; don&#39;t conflict.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t make any sense.  There&#39;s no difference in &quot;standardizing&quot;\ncertain generative grammars for generating resource names and &quot;standardizing&quot;\ncertain XML schemas for various purposes.  Neither requires a centralized\nauthority;  both merely require that naming schemes and their associated\nsemantics are themselves distinguishable via URI.\n\n&gt; The opacity-friendly way of doing this would be to assert a relationship\n&gt; between the main site and the URI it uses for the concepts of &quot;contact&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;help&quot;, and &quot;search&quot;.  For example, a GET on http://foo.com could\n&gt; return some N3 asserting;\n&gt;\n&gt; @prefix chs: &lt;http://jbone.net/contact-help-search&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/admin/help/&gt; a chs:Help .\n&gt; &lt;/search/&gt; a chs:Search .\n&gt; &lt;/contact-us/&gt; a chs:Contact .\n\nMore or less.  I&#39;m not arguing that such information shouldn&#39;t be provided;\nindeed, I&#39;m piddling around with trying to figure out if RDF or other\nXML-based mechanisms can reasonably be used to construct generative grammars\nof the type I&#39;m talking about.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
