Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;dierken@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; Is your question whether PUT of x-www-form-urlencoded is allowed to store\n&gt; something other than a byte-per-byte copy of the submission (I&#39;m not sure,\n&gt; but it probably is acceptable)?\n&gt; Or is your question whether parsing x-www-form-urlencoded data is allowed\n&gt; for PUT requests (it should be)?\n\nThose two are mutually exclusive aren&#39;t they? If PUT must store a\nbyte-per-byte copy of the submission then parsing\nx-www-form-urlencoded is not possible.\n\nIn my mind there is not question. One PUTs a representation of the\nentity that one is going to store at the URI. The representation that\nis PUT might not be the representation that is stored on disc. So one\nmight send a form-encoded representation of the entity and process\nthat form-encoded representation before serializing the entity to\ndisc. A typical example would be to interpolate form values into an\nXML document.\n\n\nBut what the toolkit people are saying is: we are not aware of any\nother toolkit that allows for parsing of form parameters for methods\nother than POST. And as we aren&#39;t aware of any we won&#39;t change our\ntoolkit.\n\nHaving thought about it a bit I can&#39;t think of any other toolkits\nthat do this either.\n\n\n\nI think the consensus of this list is that I am right and that I ought\nto be able to PUT form data and process it on the server side into an\nentity for storing at the URI. But no toolkit I can think of supports\nthe RESTfull behaviour.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
