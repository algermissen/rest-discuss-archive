They would like to build a \nstandards compliant REST system, so user authentication will be done \nwith one of the schemes in RFC 2617.\n\nIn order to meet the REST visibility requirement, the URI structure will \ninclude the userid. Although in practice this could be done using CGI \nstyle parameters, the developers are lazy, so the userid will be \nrepresented as the top level path component.\n\nThus\n\n/&lt;userid&gt;/home\n\nis the home page, and\n\n/&lt;userid&gt;/mirroronthewall\n\nis the vanity mirror on the wall page.\n\nThis allows the developers to use relative links and thus static pages \nwhich do not need to contain the userid directly.\n\nAs a further access control requirement, users are only alloed to access \ntheir own pages; thus the &lt;userid&gt; in the URI must match the userid \ngiven in the HTTP Authorization: header.\n\nSo far so good, this seems to not break REST principles.\n\nPointlessvanity.com would like to publicly adverise some of the URI \nwithin the site (e.g. the vanity mirror), but they obviously cannot give \na specific URI since this would only be valid for one user. So they \nwould like an intelligent redirector, such that accesses to any page \nwithin their site with an empty &lt;userid&gt;, will redirect to the \nappropriate page based on the authorisation header.\n\nSo, if a client accesses\n\n/mirroronthewall\n\nwith a userid of &#39;Richard&#39; in the Authorization header, the redirector \nwould redirect to\n\n/Richard/mirroronthewall\n\nThe problem (to me) is this redirector seems to break REST principles, \ndue to its use of the non-visible Authorization header to determine \nwhere to redirect to. Is this the case, or am I misunderstnding REST?\n\n"}}
