Most of the time, they want to get an iPhone native applic=\r\nation, an Android application and a traditional Web based Application to co=\r\nver the other mobile phones out there.\n\nThe way we are currently doing thin=\r\ngs is the good old (bad?) RPC over HTTP way.  We define a bunch of URI whic=\r\nh are coded inside the different apps, we exchange data as JSON, etc.  This=\r\n week, trying to do things in a better way, I&#39;ve begin a more serious study=\r\n of REST and how to do it properly.\n\nWhat I really can&#39;t wrap my head aroun=\r\nd is how, technically, have HATEOAS in a native application?  I mean, when =\r\nbuilding a native application, I have tables to display lists, buttons to d=\r\no some things, etc.  My understanding is that all those should be displayed=\r\n based on the data (hypermedia) received from the server.  Is that right?\n\n=\r\nA concrete example would be a hotel room rental service.  The person would =\r\nopen the application and have fields to enter the from/to dates.  It would =\r\nthen tap a &quot;Get Available Rooms&quot;.  The app would call the server and get ba=\r\nck a list of rooms along with prices and other details.  From there the per=\r\nson could select one room and rent it.  \n\nThe RPC way of coding this is obv=\r\nious to me but I have no idea how I&#39;d do that in a proper REST way!  What b=\r\nugs me is that every way I look at it, the client application would still b=\r\ne tightly coupled to the service.  I understand how I would only need to GE=\r\nT the http://rent-a-room.com URI hardcoded and then in the response I would=\r\n have the http://rent-a-room.com/available-rooms URI given. But...  My appl=\r\nication would expect each &quot;call&quot; to return some pre-defined data and &quot;rel&quot;,=\r\n those can&#39;t appear out of the blue?!  \n\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is =\r\nthat both the business process and the data exchanged must be known to my c=\r\nlient application at the moment of coding it, and those can&#39;t change withou=\r\nt breaking existing clients.  But reading about REST, every is talking abou=\r\nt loose coupling and not breaking clients... I just don&#39;t see it.\n\nWhat am =\r\nI missing?\n\nThanks a lot and sorry if it is a stupid question!\n\n\n"}}
