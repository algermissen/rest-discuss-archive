I may be\n&gt; mistaken in my understanding of it, but maybe by summarizing those points\n&gt; one may understand where I come from.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. &quot; A reserved subset of [a limited set of] characters may be used to\n&gt; delimit syntax components [...]&quot;\n&gt; 2.1. &quot;A percent-encoding mechanism is used to represent a data octet [when\n&gt; this] character is [...] being used as a delimiter of, or within, the\n&gt; component.\n&gt; 2.2. [Reserved] characters are called &quot;reserved&quot; because they may (or may\n&gt; not) be defined as delimiters by [...] each scheme-specific syntax, or by\n&gt; the [...] syntax of a URI&#39;s dereferencing algorithm.\n&gt;\n&gt; And\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If data for a URI component would conflict with a reserved character&#39;s\n&gt; purpose as a delimiter, then the conflicting data must be percent-encoded\n&gt; before the URI is formed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;characters in the reserved set are protected from normalization and are\n&gt; therefore safe to be used by [...] producer-specific algorithms for\n&gt; delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; And\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;other subcomponents may be defined by [...] the implementation-specific\n&gt; syntax of a URI&#39;s dereferencing algorithm&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will not quote anything about IP literals as they cover the host name and\n&gt; not the path, and as such are irrelevant to our conversation.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3.3 &quot;URI producing applications often use the reserved characters allowed in\n&gt; a segment to delimit scheme-specific or dereference-handler-specific\n&gt; subcomponents.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that clears up quite clearly that nothing prevents you from defining\n&gt; for your derefencing algorithms whatever reserved characters are discussed\n&gt; in that rfc, provided they&#39;re not being used in your scheme.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the http scheme, I see no mention of reserving any of those\n&gt; &quot;reserved&quot; characters. Even going back in time to 2396 I see:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.2 &quot; These characters are called &quot;reserved&quot;, since\n&gt; their usage within the URI component is limited to their reserved\n&gt; purpose. If the data for a URI component would conflict with the\n&gt; reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before\n&gt; forming the URI.&quot;\n&gt; And\n&gt; &quot; Characters in the &quot;reserved&quot; set are not reserved in all contexts.\n&gt; The set of characters actually reserved within any given URI\n&gt; component is defined by that component.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, we do see:\n&gt; &quot;The angle-bracket &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; and double-quote (&quot;) characters are\n&gt; excluded because they are often used as the delimiters around URI&quot;\n&gt; And\n&gt; &quot;Other characters are excluded [of the non-escaped ascii set] because\n&gt; gateways and other transport\n&gt; agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or they are\n&gt; used as delimiters.\n&gt;\n&gt; unwise = &quot;{&quot; | &quot;}&quot; | &quot;|&quot; | &quot;&#92;&quot; | &quot;^&quot; | &quot;[&quot; | &quot;]&quot; | &quot;`&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The new RFC, which obsoletes that RFC, says that : Section 2, on characters,\n&gt; has been rewritten to explain what\n&gt; characters are reserved, when they are reserved, and why they are\n&gt; reserved, even when they are not used as delimiters by the generic\n&gt; syntax.\n&gt;\n&gt; All in all, those characters are used widely, and the previous versio would\n&gt; have you encode them. But the latest revision has removed those\n&gt; restrictions. Anyone wanting to see those characters enoded would have to\n&gt; take the burden of rewriting rfc 3986, and anyone wanting to prevent those\n&gt; caharacters from being used in their encoded form would have to revise\n&gt; history and go modify 2396.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please advise if I missed a fundamental point.\n&gt;\n&gt; S\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
