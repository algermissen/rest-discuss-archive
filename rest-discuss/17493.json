IOW, the application flow *might* follow=\r\n some pre-supposed state machine, but it also *might not*. Server and clien=\r\nt simply cannot agree on this at design time - or it&#39;s not REST.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nWhich REST constraint is broken by pre-agreeing on application flow at\n&gt;&gt; d=\r\nesign time?\n&gt;\n&gt; The hypermedia constraint.\n\nHow?\n\n&gt;&gt; Doesn&#39;t that imply tha=\r\nt AtomPub is not RESTful? I&#39;m not\n&gt;&gt; sure about that.\n&gt;\n&gt; In some aspects A=\r\ntomPub is not RESTful. For example, it defines that GET requests on collect=\r\nions return Atom feed documents. Design time knowledge like this is breakin=\r\ng the hypermedia constraint.\n&gt;\n\nSure, I meant in general. Presumably the pr=\r\notocol itself is all design\ntime knowledge. Are you saying that the AtomPub=\r\n protocol is not\nRESTful?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Parallels between applications for human=\r\n-directed clients and\n&gt;&gt; machine-directed clients break down here. The reas=\r\non that html apps\n&gt;&gt; work with very little pre-supposition is because human=\r\ns are capable of\n&gt;&gt; levels of awareness, adaptation and intuition that are =\r\n(currently) far\n&gt;&gt; beyond anything a machine can manage. I think it&#39;s too e=\r\nasy to\n&gt;&gt; underestimate how much that human capability affords change in\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n application flow, and to over-estimate the capability of machines.\n&gt;\n&gt; I h=\r\nave come to think that it is misleading to make that distinction at all. Us=\r\ner agents are software components that are programmed to work on behalf of =\r\nsome user&#39;s use case. In some use cases the user will perform many user act=\r\nion steps in that use case (e.g. ordering a book on Amazon) in other use ca=\r\nses the user will merely start the process and review the results (e.g star=\r\nting a user agent that compares book prices at various sites an stores the =\r\nresult in a database).\n\nIf that was really the case then why are we talking=\r\n about &#39;design\ntime&#39;? Where&#39;s the distinction?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, - and this=\r\n is what Ian is IMHO trying to capture with his term &#39;DAP&#39; - media types do=\r\n not fall from the sky at random but are designed on the basis of some set =\r\nof interactions the designers think about when they create the media type. =\r\nClearly, when you design a media type for procurement you will have some ba=\r\nsic interactions in mind.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually you can design media types tha=\r\nt are completely application\n&gt;&gt; agnostic, and when using them define your D=\r\nAPs purely in terms of\n&gt;&gt; entry points and link relations. Providing a more=\r\n generic interface\n&gt;&gt; from an app agnostic media type seems like it might e=\r\nncourage\n&gt;&gt; healthier re-use in the system.\n&gt;\n&gt; This I doubt (I think it ju=\r\nst moves the problem elsewhere). But I am open to be convinced otherwise.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\nI have a generic media type that I&#39;m confident could be used to\nexpress a=\r\nn equivalent of AtomPub purely in terms of rels and entry\npoints. Be intere=\r\nsted to understand where your skepticism lies, maybe\nbetter to discuss that=\r\n on mike&#39;s hypermedia mailing list?\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
