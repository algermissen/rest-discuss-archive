I say this\n&gt; because obviously the server has to be able to interpret that URI to\n&gt; find the object.  Am I close here?\n\nI think he is going a step further and saying that things other than the URI\nowner (the server) should be able to apply the above methods.  For instance,\nyour client should be able to do the compare() method to determine if the\nsame resource is being requested again.  When you submit a form to a\nrelative URI, the client must be able to use the create() method to generate\nan absolute URI from from a base and a relative (and possibly a query\nstring).  For instance, suppose you have an html form in a resource pointed\nto by http://site.com/foo.  The form method is GET and the action is\n&quot;bar/baz&quot;.  When you submit the form, the client will create a URI that will\nlook something like http://site.com/foo/bar/baz?field=value.  In order to do\nthis (or the comparison), the client must be able to understand more about\nthe URI (within the http scheme space) than the basic ability to dereference\nit.\n\nAt least I think that&#39;s what he is saying...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
