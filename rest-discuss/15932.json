[1]\n&gt; \n\nWhat are you even talking about?  HTML media types ha=\r\nve always been\nmachine-readable.  There is no human involved, correct me if=\r\n I&#39;m wrong,\nin Google&#39;s index of the Web.  The very fact that alternate bro=\r\nwsing\ndevices can guide the blind through an HTML table, proves the machine=\r\n-\nreadability of the media types I mention.  That&#39;s not even taking RDFa\nin=\r\nto consideration.\n\nHow on Earth do you read that reference, and decide that=\r\n it means HTML \nshould only be written for machines?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; HTML is as much a=\r\ns structuring text as it is about presentation\n&gt; (although the tendency and=\r\n recommendation is to use CSS for that, but\n&gt; nevertheless the markup is th=\r\nere).\n&gt;\n\nYes, HTML can be misused for presentation.  How does that change t=\r\nhe\nfact that, properly used, it&#39;s about structuring data?  Not just text,\nd=\r\nata.  Since 2004, all my markup is based on structuring data and\ndocuments =\r\nlogically, separate from their presentation, all of which may\nbe found in e=\r\nxternal CSS documents.\n\nHow on Earth does pointing out that it&#39;s *possible*=\r\n to mix structure\nand presentation, begin to make what I&#39;m saying wrong?  I=\r\ns it possible\nfor you to tone down the argumentativeness of, well, _all_ yo=\r\nur posts?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if my main goal is not to make\n&gt; a website but to allow =\r\nservices to access my data in a  &quot;machines\n&gt; talking to machines&quot; way,\n&gt;\n\nW=\r\nho says the main goal of a REST system is making a website?  What a\nREST sy=\r\nstem *is*, is a distributed hypertext application.  A user,\ncould be human =\r\nor machine, is attempting to perform a task, using an\ninterface transferred=\r\n over the network.  The main goal of a REST system\nis to provide a hypertex=\r\nt application interface over the network.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; why should I care about &lt;b&gt;b=\r\nolds&lt;/&gt; and\n&gt; &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;?\n&gt;\n\nThis is yet another question for the sake =\r\nof being argumentative, isn&#39;t\nit?  Inline markup has nothing to do with the=\r\n structure I was speaking\nof, which comes from block-level markup.  If your=\r\n data doesn&#39;t include\nnatural language which may contain emphasized passage=\r\ns, then,\n*obviously*, these tags are irrelevant to your system.\n\nA cargo ma=\r\nnifest is still just tables and lists, structurally.  Same\nwith genetic dat=\r\na.  Or flight reservations.  Or concert tickets.  Or\nanything else you can =\r\nthink about interacting with over the Web -- you\ncan model it using ubiquit=\r\nous media types.  BTW, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; aren&#39;t\nautomatically presentational.  Se=\r\nmantically, &lt;em&gt;USS Constitution&lt;/em&gt;\nis improper -- ship names are marked =\r\nup with &lt;i&gt;, so if the cargo\nmanifest has anything to do with maritime ship=\r\nping, then yeah, you need\nto care about &lt;i&gt;.  Or re-invent that wheel in yo=\r\nur custom media type.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Why should I care about accessibility at all? T=\r\nhat is\n&gt; a problem for web designers to deal, not to a &quot;data provider&quot; serv=\r\nice\n&gt; designer...\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re right.  Why shouldn&#39;t the ability to see be a =\r\nprerequisite for\ndeveloping and maintaining your system?  After all, it&#39;s n=\r\not like\nthere&#39;s any solution out there to the problem of communicating text=\r\n to\nthe blind...  I don&#39;t know about you, but that sounds mighty\ndiscrimina=\r\ntory to me.\n\nI don&#39;t care if your system is targeted to machine users.  You=\r\n don&#39;t\nhave a bunch of Cylons developing it, do you?  No?  You&#39;re using\nhum=\r\nans?  Yeah, I thought so.  How on Earth is a human going to develop,\nlet al=\r\none debug, a hypertext interface that&#39;s only machine readable?\n\nSo, as it t=\r\nurns out, humans will have to use your hypertext after all...\nwhich is also=\r\n the basis of the Web&#39;s success.  How will another entity\ninteroperate with=\r\n, or re-use, your system if their humans can&#39;t access\nyour interface?  Agai=\r\nn, the reason for choosing HTML as your hypertext\nfor driving the applicati=\r\non, is because the option is there for\naccessibility.\n\nFine, you don&#39;t give=\r\n a rat&#39;s ass.  But what if, next month, your boss\ndoes?  Perhaps as the res=\r\nult of an anti-discrimination in the workplace\nlawsuit, since you&#39;re exclud=\r\ning the blind from a job that only involves\nreading and manipulating text..=\r\n.  Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just add in\nthe accessibility markup to your ex=\r\nisting HTML, than have to re-invent\nthat wheel for your custom media type?\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So why not put the focus on XML, that &quot;is a set of rules for encoding\n=\r\n&gt; documents in machine-readable form&quot;,&quot;widely used for the\n&gt; representation=\r\n of arbitrary data structures&quot; [2]?\n&gt; \n\nOh, good grief.  Do I honestly have=\r\n to type (X)HTML every time?  Isn&#39;t\nit obvious when I say &quot;HTML media types=\r\n&quot; that I&#39;m referring to\ntext/html _and_ application/xhtml+xml?  Nitpicking =\r\nsemantics is, again,\nargumentative.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Why use HTML that &quot;tells you how d=\r\nata should look&quot; instead of XML that\n&gt; &quot;tells you what it means&quot;, that &quot;app=\r\nlies context to the data&quot;, and\n&gt; &quot;separates data content from data presenta=\r\ntion&quot;[3]?\n&gt; \n\nBecause HTML doesn&#39;t tell you how data should look, you&#39;re ma=\r\nking false\nassumptions.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t you agree that REST is much more than=\r\n a glorified way of\n&gt; making web sites?\n&gt;\n\nYes.  But your habit of asking q=\r\nuestions in that form tempts me to\nargue against it to the bitter end.  A t=\r\nelephony system that doesn&#39;t\ninvolve HTML or browsers can be RESTful, and i=\r\nf it is, a data-view\nanalysis of it will look exactly like the data-view an=\r\nalysis of a\nwebsite.  This holds true for any REST system.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So I would =\r\nsay: ... Create your own Media-Type. Create hundreds,\n&gt; thousands of new Me=\r\ndia-Types. Don&#39;t wait for some organization to\n&gt; define then from the top-d=\r\nown. Do it yourself from the ground-up and\n&gt; encourage others to do the sam=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n\nYeah, you would -- you&#39;re always arguing against the importance of so=\r\nme\naspect of REST or another.  This is absolutely, unequivocally NOT the\nRE=\r\nST style, and represents an utter failure to grasp the notion of a\nmedia ty=\r\npe.  Look, HTML 5 will use the same media type as HTML 4, and\nHTML 3, and H=\r\nTML 2, and HTML before that.  HTML 5 will be used to do\nall the same compli=\r\ncated things, like airline reservations, over the\nWeb, using the same media=\r\n type that&#39;s always been used.\n\nThis is the point of REST, folks.  If you&#39;r=\r\ne putting a hypertext\ninterface out on the Web for human consumption, then =\r\nit does not matter\nwhat the nature of your data is, you can create an HTML =\r\ninterface.  The\nworst possible thing you can do, is go about minting new me=\r\ndia types\nfor each resource type you create.\n\nIf you do that, then I expect=\r\n the JPEG images in each image gallery you\ncreate, to have unique media typ=\r\nes too, entirely defeating the purpose\nand, most critically, breaking the s=\r\nelf-descriptive messaging\nconstraint.  REST is based on the principle of ge=\r\nnerality here, which\nis why it says, clearly in black-and-white, to re-use =\r\n_standard_ media\ntypes.  That it also says the set of such types is evolvin=\r\ng, is not\nsome loophole for the creation of thousands of new media types ev=\r\nery\nmonth, not one of which will EVER become a standard.  NOT REST!!!\n\n-Eri=\r\nc\n\n"}}
