Believe\n&gt; it or not, Antonio, I&#39;m not a complete and total moron who can&#39;t for\n&gt; the life of me figure out what an acronym is.  But thanks for trolling.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;   \nOk, I see, it stands for&quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot; \nbut it doesn&#39;t come from&quot;hypermedia as the engine of application \nstate&quot;... subtleties of the english language I guess...\n\nNevertheless, if I read the two following paragraphs\n\n&quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of \nresources; manipulation of resources through representations; \nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application \nstate.&quot;\n\n&quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of \nresources; manipulation of resources through representations; \nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t think they mean the same. Now if your problem is with the \nacronym itself, and you think &quot;hypermedia constraint&quot; is clearer or \nnicer than HATEOAS as a short way of referring to the concept of \n&quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;, I again say that the \nfirst is more ambiguous and prone to confusion that the second, \nspecially if you&#39;re talking to a newbie or someone who&#39;s trying to learn \nREST as it was I not many months ago (and still am of course).\n\nJust say &quot;hypermedia constraint&quot; and I guarantee you that person soon \nforget about that, or at most it will think &quot;hypermedia constraint = \nmust have links&quot;. Say to him HATEOAS and I assure you that he will \neither give up on learning REST or he&#39;ll rush to find out what it really \nis and he&#39;ll never forget it.\n\nOf course, if you&#39;re talking among Restafarians they will understand the \nsame either you say HATEOAS or &quot;hypermedia constraint&quot;, but for them \nthey even understand &quot;the 4th constraint&quot;...\n\nJust to finish, let me assure you I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a complete and \ntotal moron, and what you call trolling is just a way of writing to make \na point, it&#39;s called &quot;irony&quot; and it&#39;s a figure of speech in literature. \nBut of course you knew this... Nevertheless, I&#39;m sorry if with that I \nhurt your feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
