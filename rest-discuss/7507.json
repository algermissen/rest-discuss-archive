And can we change that?  Or consider the problem from a different\n&gt; perspective?\n\nThis is simple. The search engine finds x pages which it deems equally \ngood as a response to a given query. Which does it link to first? \nThere&#39;s no way of saying.\n\n&gt; Google tweaks their algorithms quarterly.  Why could they not\n&gt; include an update given new guidance?  The rest would follow.\n\nWe can already give this guidance to Google. Google reacts appropriately \nwhen it receives a 301 Moved Permanently by treating the target of the \nlocation header as the URI to use.\n\n&gt;&gt; It is also a caching minus, because the cache \n&gt;&gt; won&#39;t know it already has something that came via a different \n&gt;&gt; URI. That can be a usability minus in the form of slower \n&gt;&gt; perceived response time, and a business minus in terms of \n&gt;&gt; higher bandwidth costs. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I&#39;d like to explore why that is and see if there are not new ways to\n&gt; look at the problem.\n\nThe same reason you don&#39;t know whether what&#39;s behind door number 1 is \nthe same as what&#39;s behind door number 2.\n\nAgain, but a note behind door number 2 saying &quot;go to door number 1 and \nopen that instead&quot; and your problem is solved. As a bonus we can also \ncontrol how often we check door number 2 to see if that note is still there.\n\n\n"}}
