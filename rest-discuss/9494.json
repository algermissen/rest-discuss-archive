Heintz wrote:\n&gt; Elliotte,\n&gt; \n&gt; You are mistaken. JSON has no place for code - it is only a data format. \n&gt; JSON specifically is a sub-set of JavaScript. (And also a sub-set of \n&gt; YAML...)\n\nIf that were true, there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. It isn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; You may want to actually read http://json.org/ before continuing this \n&gt; diatribe...\n&gt; \n\nPlease assume that I have read the and quite a bit more many times. The \nissue is not what the specs say. The issue is what code does. JSON was \ndeliberately and carefully designed to be able to be passed to eval() \nand executed as Javascript. There is nothing about JSON that prevents \nthe embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\nThis is by design, not accident. Waving your hands and crying, &quot;But you \nweren&#39;t supposed to do that&quot; is no defense against an attacker.\n\nI thought we got away from the bad practice of treating code as data and \nvice versa  forty years ago. But I guess there&#39;s a whole new generation \nnow who didn&#39;t learn those lessons the first time, and will now have to \nlearn them for themselves the hard way. :-(\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
