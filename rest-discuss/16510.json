I have neither fancy degrees nor corporatist experience, but am\nmerely a self-glorified Web developer/host/ISP who is incapable of\nseeing REST outside the confines of my experience, therefore I am the\none responsible for all the confusion as to what constitutes a self-\ndescriptive message, and may as well be ignored, if not asked to just\nstop even trying to make a valid point...\n\nWell, if your alternative to re-using HTML/Atom is based on your self-\nglorified credentials and experience, and has led you to believe that\nminting endless opaque identifiers for use on the Web is congruous with\nthe REST style, then perhaps you _should_ be listening to the benefit\nof my particular knowledge and experience, because my messaging is\nself-descriptive and yours isn&#39;t, as far as the reality of the deployed\ninfrastructure is concerned.\n\nNot to personalize this or anything... but apparently even my thick\nskin to Internet flaming has its limits, and I&#39;ve definitely reached\nthat point today.  ;-)\n\nSuccinctly?  Minting new types and identifiers willy-nilly incurs\nsubstantial cost which will not be recovered any time soon, whereas re-\nuse, even of such mundane markup as HTML, gives immediate payback\nwithout incurring any of those costs.  Shouldn&#39;t even be controversial.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
