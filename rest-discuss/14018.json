If they know about foo links and if\n&gt;&gt; they can\n&gt;&gt; provide a foo link they should do so.\n&gt;&gt; So when clients do not find a foo link they can reasonably &#39;believe&#39;\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; the server cannot provide one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Where does the client get this expectation that a &quot;foo&quot; link exists or\n&gt; should exist at all?\n\nYes, exactly. When a service uses Atom and chooses some kind of  \nextension,\nthe client is unable to know this before the interaction because it  \ncannot\nbe specified. The client can only observe it and then trust the server  \nto\nkeep using the extension if it (the client) chosses to implement the\nextension.\n\nThis calls for things like &#39;profiles&#39; to provide a way for the server to\ncommunicate that it uses a certain extension (this has come up on the\natom lists a couple of times and there even was a draft once).\n\nOTH, it seems contrary to what REST is aiming at. From a REST POV the\nunderstanding really is (IMHO) that the client makes observations,\nprobably &#39;implements&#39; them and then trusts the server to &#39;do its\nbest&#39;.\n\nAnd this is what is fine on the human Web (because we can compensate\nshould such expectations break) and machine clients can not.\n\nI observe the 1-click at Amazon. I like it. I start using it. When\nit&#39;s suddenly gone I just go look what is there instead. Maybe use that\nold shopping cart again. Programs cannot do this.\n\nThe latter is not even a problem because they can just fail and a\nhuman admin can find a solution. But trying to convince busniess people\nto base the entire architecture of an enterprise on this model is\nan excercise where you risk your credibility as an IT professional :-)\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If the client is expecting a &quot;foo&quot; link and a service isn&#39;t providing\n&gt; one, then, I&#39;d argue that there is a mismatch in the protocol that the\n&gt; client is using and the one the server is using (whether by design,\n&gt; version incompatibility, or bug, doesn&#39;t much matter).\n\nRight. But how to express the protocol? That is really the question.\nIf you bundle up hypermedia semantics (media types, extensions,\nlink rels, query params) you usually do not stick them in a single\nspec and therefore you do not have a place to define that you\nuse exactly that bundle.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Simply, when you have this kind of mis-communication, someone is using\n&gt; the &quot;wrong&quot; protocol, or isn&#39;t following the spec properly of the\n&gt; agreed upon/advertised protocol.\n\nSee above. Which spec.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The specification will dictate when and where a service will provide\n&gt; the &quot;foo&quot; link, and where the client can expect to find one.\n&gt;\n\nSee above.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
