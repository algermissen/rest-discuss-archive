A lot of services that are called RESTful but aren&#39;t are ther=\r\ne to support AJAX.  One big reason they aren&#39;t RESTful tends to be a lack o=\r\nf HATEOS.  But even if you do have HATEOS in your AJAX calls, I don&#39;t know =\r\nof anyone who doesn&#39;t have a session on the server to keep track of authent=\r\nication, which also violates REST.  Now, the fact that I don&#39;t know anyone =\r\ndoing it is hardly an exhaustive search.  So the question has to do with RE=\r\nST thus:\n\n\n  1.  Can you use truly RESTful web services that require authen=\r\ntication in an AJAX browser-based application.  The answer to this question=\r\n, from your answer below, is yes.\n  2.  Should you make those web services =\r\nRESTful? If the answer to this is &quot;no&quot; then I see your point that this has =\r\nnothing to do with REST (except to answer that question).  But I think the =\r\nanswer must be &quot;yes, if it&#39;s feasible&quot;, so my question is about whether it =\r\nis feasible/practical to do.  Is there a (good) reason no one seems to be d=\r\noing it?\n     *   If you have a requirement to have a nice, pretty, branded=\r\n login screen are you already stuck at that point?
