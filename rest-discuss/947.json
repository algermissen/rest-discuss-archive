There are a lot of people learning REST via the Wiki.  We should\ntake care to tag those more, &lt;ahem/&gt;, &quot;controversial&quot; pages as &quot;Not\ngenerally accepted as RESTful&quot;.\n\nBut back to Jeff&#39;s ideas.  Ignoring the so-called dogma for the moment,\nhere&#39;s a couple of very practical concerns.\n\nFirst, internationalization.  If we agree that /help means &quot;help&quot;,\nshouldn&#39;t we also permit /aide to mean the same?  And if we do that, do\nwe require bots to understand all languages, and that no new languages\nbe defined?  If not, how do you deploy new languages?  You need a layer\nof indirection here, something to assert &quot;this URI is of this type&quot;.\n\nSecond, if my namespace already includes a &quot;/help&quot; - perhaps I use it\nas the name for my &quot;happy elves love partying&quot; resource - does that mean\nthat I can&#39;t use the help/contact/search system?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
