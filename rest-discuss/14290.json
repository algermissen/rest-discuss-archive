I am questioning the RESTfulness of  \nspecs that =\r\nallow the clients to make assumptions about the hypermedia  \nit will receiv=\r\ne at some point in the interaction. AtomPub for example  \nenables the clien=\r\nt *implementor* to assume that a GET on a collection  \nwill return an Atom =\r\nfeed document. This is equivalent to making an  \nassumption about the appli=\r\ncation state to be in after the GET to the  \ncollection.\n\nAnd I am trying t=\r\no say that M2M clients (besides passibe, server  \ndriven crawlers) can only=\r\n be built when such contracts are in place.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
