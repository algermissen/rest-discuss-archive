This is an\napples-to-oranges comparison (possible more like fruit-to-apples).  There is\nno REST toolkit because REST is not an implementable specification, just an\narchitectural style.  It seems to me that Dave&#39;s comments do nothing more\nthan show he doesn&#39;t understand what REST is.  I would have given a bit more\ncredit to his opinion if he had instead asked/answered why SOAP isn&#39;t\nRESTful.\n\nInterestingly, (while I think that Dave should know better) I think this is\none of the bigger stumbling blocks to the acceptance of REST.  When I first\nheard about it, I too thought it was something like SOAP, XML-RPC, etc.\nThis may be due to the fact that few people talk about REST separately from\nHTTP (at least outside of this list).  As a result, I believe many people\nlook at REST as competition instead of just another tool to (possibly)\nimprove what they are working on.\n\nHey, maybe we all need to come up with a single e-mail sig that says\nsomething to this effect.  If we all use it, maybe people will take notice\nand get over some of the incorrect notions they have.  How about:\n\nREST doesn&#39;t make the things you use.  REST makes the things you use better.\n\n:)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Vincent D Murphy&quot; &lt;vdm@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 22, 2002 5:18 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] dave winer on REST vs SOAP\n\n\n&gt; http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/11/21#restVsSoap\n&gt;\n&gt; i&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions about this; suffice to say i take\n&gt; anything winer says with a pinch of salt since reading his contributions\n&gt; to the recent RDF flamewar.\n&gt;\n&gt; found here:\n&gt; http://use.perl.org/~gnat/journal/9071\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
