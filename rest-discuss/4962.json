I find relative URLs very handy and succinct, and don&#39;t want\nto lose their power so I constrain the URLs I generate in\nrepresentations\nthis way.\n\nI will lose the trailing slash for representations where I want &#39;Save\nAs&#39;\nto work, e.g. PDF and other graphics. Embedded URLs aren&#39;t as much of an\nissue here so you don&#39;t lose much by not having the trailing slash.\n\n&gt; This seems to me to be an ambiguity that should be at least summarized\n&gt; in a Best Practices document.  Does anyone have any opinions or\n&gt; examples of how they resolved this issue in their own application\n&gt; designs?\n\nThe idea of Best Practices, or a RESTful design (patterns) cookbook,\nis a good one.\n\nI think frameworks like Ruby on Rails, while full of anti-RESTisms\nat the moment are a good example of how things should be done; with\ndeclarative descriptions of your resources, and intelligent generation\nof representations.\n\nI&#39;m constantly dreaming of a DSL for RESTful applications but don&#39;t\nhave the time to implement it.\n\n&gt; WEBDAV specifies that the second example URI\n&gt; &quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/&quot;  denotes a collection, which has\n&gt; properties that are distinct from a member URI.  This notion alters\n&gt; how a collection URI responds or interact with HTTP commands such as\n&gt; GET, POST, etc.  In particular, the WEBDAV spec does not require that\n&gt; a GET on a collection return a conanical list of all it&#39;s contained\n&gt; member URI&#39;s.  That at least seems to violate the REST best practice\n&gt; of discoverability, however it does offer a potential way to\n&gt; consistantly handle the problem of when the member URI list is very\n&gt; long, such as if there are millions of parts under the given example.\n\nI recall that Roy Fielding had some pretty negative things to say\nabout WebDAV, and in particular how it was developed, the last time\nit came up on rest-discuss. I don&#39;t have time to search the archives,\nsorry.\n\nI thought it seemed likely that most of what it does (collections,\ntransactions) can be done by treating the collections and transactions\nas Just Another Resource. Especially properties... I just don&#39;t see\nwhy they aren&#39;t subordinate resources.\n\nThe attraction of WebDAV for me has been the client support in Adobe\nand Microsoft products. So for example, in a REST/HTTP mailbox resource\none could offer access to attachments through a &#39;Web Folder&#39;. I&#39;m not\nso interested in the other features that aren&#39;t supported anywhere.\n\n"}}
