This is typically\nmitigated by switching to SSL and use HTTPS instead of plain HTTP, which is however still vulnerable to man in the\nmiddle attacks. Server is not required to store client credentials in plain text, which means client credentials are\nsafe even in case of accidental server data leaks.\n\n- HTTP digest authentication is much more robust and safe even over plain HTTP, but requires implementing more complex\nalgorithms. It also doubles the number of requests - each client request needs to be sent twice (see the protocol for\nexplanation why). Again, server is not required to store client credentials in plain text, which means client\ncredentials are safe even in case of accidental server data leaks.\n\n- WSSE is somewhere in between the basic and digest. It can be used over plain HTTP, it does not require 2 HTTP requests\nfor every client request, but it does require server to store user credentials in a plain text (unlike the two protocols\nabove) which makes the client credentials potentially vulnerable in case of a successful attack on the server.\n\n- you may also want to look at OAuth, which is becoming quite popular and can be used for implementing more advanced\nauthentication and authorization scenarios.\n\nHTH,\nMarek\n\nOn 09/08/2011 04:34 PM, jim.margetts wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new to REST and have a quick query:\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of the literature i&#39;ve read about RESTful design warns against using any sort of sessions.
