I&#39;ve had a go at implementing this, b=\r\nut it makes my lovely tidy RESTUL URLs look ugly and difficult to read/revi=\r\new.\n\nThus, I&#39;m considering alternative options.  I could put the fields att=\r\nribute in the http header attributes instead of the URL.  Alternatively, I =\r\ncould analyse my application to determine the bare minimum set of fields th=\r\nat meet the different UI requirements.  Another option would be to introduc=\r\ne a &#39;short&#39; boolean parameter - that when true returns an agreed short set =\r\nof fields, and when false returns the full set.\n\nHas anybody had to solve a=\r\n problem like this?  Or offer any wisdom?\n\ncheers,\nIan\n\n\n"}}
