Has the topic of\n&gt; DNS reimplemented over HTTP requests to known server IPs, acting as proxy\n&gt; caches to root HTTP domain name servers been covered on this list? It\n&gt; would be fun to reimplement DNS and cover generic URI/URN resolving at\n&gt; once. (Not that the world would rush to adopt it or anything; you&#39;d spend\n&gt; your million dollars on marketing and bribery, not development...)\n\nI think that if you want DNS&#39; performance you&#39;d at least need to move \nHTTP to a UDP foundation before moving DNS to an HTTP foundation. TCP \nconnections are kind of expensive and DNS runs all over the Internet \ntrying to resolve each address.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n\n"}}
