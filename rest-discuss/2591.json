In a world where resources\nare synonymous with documents (or =\r\nfiles or records or any entity in\ncomputer accessible storage), DELETE make=\r\ns sense. In a world where\nresources can reside outside computers and their =\r\nstorage, DELETE doesn&#39;t\nmake much sense, at least not until Stephen King wr=\r\nites a story called\nWeb Browser of the Gods.\n\nSo, as strawman text, appende=\r\nd onto 9.7:\n\n   The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete th=\r\ne resource\n   identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden =\r\nby human\n   intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client =\r\ncannot\n   be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if th=\r\ne\n   status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action\n=\r\n   has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT\n   indic=\r\nate success unless, at the time the response is given, it\n   intends to del=\r\nete the resource or move it to an inaccessible\n   location. **In cases wher=\r\ne the resource in question can not sensibly\nbe \n   deleted (for example the=\r\n resource is in fact a physical object) the \n   origin server should return=\r\n 501, not implemented (see section\n10.5.4).**\n\nwhere 501 is the server erro=\r\nr used to indicate it is incapable of\nperforming the request. Creating a ne=\r\nw error code for this case is about\nas useful as dividing the resources in =\r\ntwo.\n\nBill de h=D3ra \n--\nPropylon\nwww.propylon.com \n\n\n"}}
