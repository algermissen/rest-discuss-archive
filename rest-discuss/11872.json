In a collection, a user can create\nentity &quot;types&quot;* (e.g., Artist, Artistic Work, etc.), then assert a\nrelationship between these two entity classes (e.g., Artist has many\nArtistic Works).   It is then  pretty easy to represent  the\nrelationship in Atom -- &lt;link\nrel=&quot;http://example.com/artist/to/artistic_work&quot;\nhref=&quot;http://example.com/artist/to/artistic_work/&lt;artist_identifier&gt;&quot;\ntitle=&quot;Works&quot;&gt; on the &quot;parent&quot; in the relationship.\n\nThere could be an infinite number of these relations created by end\nusers as they define entity classes and assert relationships between\nthem.  Obviously, service docs could be dynamic so as to represent\nthese newly minted link relations, but since they would typically\nfollow an easily regex-able pattern, I wonder if defining a link\nrelation uri template might make more sense.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n--peter keane\n\n*types simply define the set of attributes available for the entity --\ne.g., birth & death dates for Artist, material & creation date for\nArtistic Work.  Types are represented as an AtomPub Category document.\n\n"}}
