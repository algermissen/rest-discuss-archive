Unless\nsomeone specified the exact behavior more recently than four years ago. I\nwould enjoy being corrected on this point though.\n\nYou can check the content-type request header and parse the data yourself.\nMost modern servlets will not actually consume the input stream until you\nask for &#39;parameters&#39;. If you check the request headers for the content-type,\nand if it&#39;s &#39;application/xml&#39; you can send the inputstream to an appropriate\nxml parser.\n\n\n&gt; Is there an implicit content type on a post request that says the message\nbody will\n&gt; contain name/value pairs?\nYes - &#39;application/x-www-urlencoded&#39; indicates the body content is name\nvalue pairs encoded according to the appropriate (but not immediately handy)\nspec.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a second challenge that I have.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I have been testing this application, I am realizing that it will\n&gt; be more difficult to test from an html page since html does not allow\n&gt; put/delete to be specified on a form.\nYou can use javascript and XMLHTTPRequest object - the greatest thing to\ncome out of microsoft since I don&#39;t know when.\n\n&gt; Also, a form will always write parameters as name/value pairs.\nDepends on the encoding specified for the form. But if you bypass the plain\nvanilla html forms and use xmlhttprequest objects then you can format anyway\nyou want.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it sound like I am approaching this problem correctly?\n&gt;\nYes.\n\n"}}
