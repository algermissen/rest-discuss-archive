We use\nit a *lot* here, and it works great.  I think you just have to\nunderstand the limited context in which it is used/useful.\n\nOur use case is basically, I want to send a HTTP message to some server,\nand I specify a proxy (or proxies) through which the message first\ntraverses.  Each of those proxies has to be trusted by the party that\nspecifies them.\n\nSo, for example, we use it from our wireless browser to specify a path\nthat includes an intermediary that converts from RIM base station ids\nto the soon-to-be-standardized GEO headers (http://geotags.org).\nWe also use it for security, so that the user can &quot;turn on&quot; security,\nwhich basically sends messages through a proxy that wraps them up\nwith S/MIME.\n\n&quot;Static routing&quot;, as we refer to this, is certainly not a general\nrouting solution.  We support 3 other types of routing, for different\ntypes of integration problems.  But static routing definitely has its\nspace - it&#39;s the most common form of routing that we use, which I think\nsays something for the needs of wireless.  Other domains may use other\ntypes of routing more commonly.  No surprise there, I hope.\n\nLucas wrote;\n&gt; PUT or POST to joe://messages/jeff/\n&gt; ...message body here as xm...\n\nBTW, what the heck does that mean?  Are you really suggesting using a\nURI scheme to identify people, or am I misreading?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
