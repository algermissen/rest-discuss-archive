Hopefully this is clearer. Firstly, to confirm I am on firm ground: this situation only appears to arise when the client is unaware of the resource URI and therefore has to use POST instead of idempotent PUT - based on Roy&#39;s post that you kindly included, where he refers to a series of individual POST requests.\n&gt;    Secondly, I was looking at Bill de hOra&#39;s HTTPLR [1] last night and figured that his use of stateful URI&#39;s could be used to keep the client and server in sync i.e. no need for expensive ETag-type values.. Given that methodology, here is an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; Client                             Server\n&gt; \n&gt; POST /someURI                  update resource state;\n&gt; &lt;details&gt;                      /someUri goes to &quot;.../ready&quot; state\n&gt;  ...                                \n&gt;  &lt;clientViewOfState&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;http://.../initial&quot;  --&gt;        \n&gt;  &lt;/clientViewOfState&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/details&gt;\n&gt;                                          \n&gt;                           &lt;--  200 OK gets lost         \n&gt; \n&gt; client re-sends:\n&gt; POST /someURI                            \n&gt; &lt;details&gt;                      server detects conflict;\n&gt;   ...                          informs client of what its view is\n&gt;   &lt;clientViewOfState&gt;\n&gt;      &quot;http://.../initial&quot; --&gt;        \n&gt;   &lt;/clientViewOfState&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/details&gt;\n&gt;                                          \n&gt;                           &lt;--  409 Conflict\n&gt;                                &lt;serverStateView&gt;\n&gt;                                    &quot;.../ready&quot;\n&gt;                                &lt;/serverStateView&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n\nI am not sure what you are getting at with the URIs here but I see your point. Why not have the client do a GET on the resource it wants to update?\n\n&gt;                          \n&gt; Thus, the client and server are keeping in synch via the use of the stateful URI&#39;s.\n\nHmm - what is a &#39;stateful URI&#39;?\n\n\n&gt; This means that the server is maintaining some application state i.e. breaking REST&#39;s statelessness constraint.\n\nHow so? The application state is where the client is in the overall application. How is the server maintaining that information in your example?\n\n&gt; However, if I am correct, constraints can be relaxed as and when the situation arises?\n\nWell, if you relax REST&#39;s constraints it ain&#39;t REST anymore and you&#39;ll have to do the &#39;induced properties analysis&#39; all over :-)\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this seem reasonable...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://dehora.net/doc/httplr/draft-httplr-01.html\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 14/7/10, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] HTTP reliability - in order msg delivery?\n&gt; To: &quot;Sean Kennedy&quot; &lt;seandkennedy@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &quot;Jim Webber&quot; &lt;jim@...&gt;, &quot;Rest Discussion Group&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, 14 July, 2010, 7:41\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jul 13, 2010, at 2:15 PM, Sean Kennedy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How does this look...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sean,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am having trouble to see what you are asking.

I imagine for a banking application, the order of transactions on an account would be important...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can do this by including in the client&#39;s message a token that expresses the client&#39;s assumptions about the state of the resource. The server can use that token to verify that the client&#39;s expectation and the actual resource state match. If they do not match, the server instructs the client what to do next.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Roy somewhat explains this in [1]:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Think of it instead as a series of individual POST requests that are\n&gt; &gt; building up a combined resource that will eventually be a savings\n&gt; &gt; account when finished. Each of those requests can include parameters\n&gt; &gt; that perform the same role as an ETag -- basically, identifying the\n&gt; &gt; client&#39;s view of the current state of the resource. Then, when a\n&gt; &gt; request is repeated or a state-change lost, the server would see\n&gt; &gt; that in the next request and tell the client to refresh its view\n&gt; &gt; of the form before continuing to the next step.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/9805\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt; &gt; NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; &gt; Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt; &gt; Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt; NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt; Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
