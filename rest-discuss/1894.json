In that case, the agent inventing the URIs is of course the\n&gt; one that can treat them as transparent rather than opaque.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, Jeff says that if the client and server negotiate somehow (prose\n&gt; document or something else), the server could delegate the right to\n&gt; interpret the URIs. I don&#39;t think that this is very often necessary in\n&gt; practice but as long as permission was given explicitly it would be okay\n&gt; with me.\n\nI think it&#39;s actually too hard to give semantic meaning to the URI, \nwhich is probably which everyone says they should be outwardly opaque. \nHow do you convey that meaning to a global audience?\n\nIt might have meaning to some participants, but there is no way to \nformally publish those meanings, so no systems should be built having to \nunderstand the URI.  One merely has to GET that URI and use (hopefully) \nRDF to understand what that object is.  And to understand the encoding \nof that object, use the MIME type.\n\nOK, *phew*.\n\nThanks!\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms090806090500060007040101\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms090806090500060007040101--\r\n\n"}}
