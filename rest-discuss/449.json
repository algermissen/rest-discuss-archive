This is probably do-able with minimal\n&gt; impact on the existing Web architecture.  There&#39;s a large amount of\n&gt; current work going on along these lines relative to distributed\n&gt; filesystems, filesharing, p2p and decentralized systems.  It would be\n&gt; nice to see a principled design for such functionality available for\n&gt; general use within the Web community.\n\nYup.  You can do this without redirection too.  If you think about\nit, any intermediary along a path is a potential new context in\nwhich a URI can be interpreted and which can be forwarded on without\nredirecting back to the initiator.\n\nI recall a very old (pre-Bone) FoRK post in which Rohit suggested\nthat in order for naming to decentralize, we have to move to\nrelative names such as &quot;Rohit&#39;s Adam&quot;, which may be URIfied as;\n\n  http://[rohit&#39;s pgp key]/adam\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
