PUT (should) guarantee idempotency but does that mean a POST cannot be idempotent.  Additionally whether &quot;other&quot; resources are modified as a result of PUT/POST is not what qualifies the usage of PUT/POST.  It&#39;s what happens to resource directly being manipulated that is of interest here.\n&gt;\n&gt; If using PUT, I would GET the representation of the cache (because it had to have existed) and return an empty representation.  I personally don&#39;t the get the &quot;flusher&quot; resource but that&#39;s probably not important.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many ways to address this however.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
