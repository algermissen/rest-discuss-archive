Among reasons this is better in theory, it is easier to build HTML\nforms that have different ACTION= attributes. This is the only thing\nthat would stop the REST community from using XooMLe as a perfect case\nstudy. It&#39;s a tiny thing to change but sort of goes to the heart of REST\nphilosophy. Priority = 8 out of 10.\n\n* I&#39;d suggest that the key should be passed using HTTP authentication\n(at least as an option). Then developers could share references without\nsharing their keys. As I recall, if you really want, you can embed HTTP\nauthentication information in URIs *anyhow*. Priority = 7/10\n\n* &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; could be used to provide a nice HTML-based\nrendition. I would be happy to provide this XSLT stylesheet. Priority =\n6/10\n\n* I&#39;d use a namespace on the returned XML (with default prefix) so that\nit is a little easier to associate namespace-triggered behaviour with\nthe XML. It would just take one attribute value to be &quot;namespace aware&quot;.\n6/10\n\n * It would be great if you would publish a schema. I believe there is\none embedded in Google&#39;s WSDL but you could extract that modulo\ncopyright issues. You could also use a schemaLocation attribute to point\nto it. 6/10\n\n * &lt;url&gt;...&lt;/url&gt; could become &lt;url xlink:href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;...&lt;/url&gt;. I have\nmixed feelings about XLink but it *is* the standard way to do linking in\nXML. More or less this will endear you to people who have developed\nXLink processors. 5/10\n\n * You could build on the way HTTP/REST works to add some interesting\nfeatures. \n\n 1. For instance you could embed a link to the cached page in each item: \n    &lt;URL&gt;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~norman/&lt;/URL&gt; \n   \n&lt;cached&gt;http://xooomle..../cached?url=&quot;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~norman/&quot;&lt;/cached&gt;\n\n 2. You could have a link from each page that is a &quot;sub-query&quot;. So let&#39;s\nsay I send you a link like\n&quot;http://.../?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&method=doGoogleSearch&q=Paul&quot;, it would\nembed within it a link like this:\n\n    * &lt;subquery\nxlink:href=&quot;http://.../doGoogleSearch/hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&method=doGoogleSearch&q=Paul/&quot;/&gt;\n\nThen I could do a *subquery* just by appending &quot;?q=Prescod&quot;. By subquery\nI mean that it would be interpreted as the same as &quot;Paul+Prescod&quot;. This\nsomewhat goes back to the first issue: you need a way for the method to\nbe part of the path, not part of the query, but you also need a way for\na representation for the &quot;query&quot; to be part of the path. Once it is\nmoved into the path it is opaque so it doesn&#39;t matter if you use some\ncompression scheme or something:\n\n * &lt;subquery\nxlink:href=&quot;http://.../doGoogleSearch/fj4fjefe0fa9e8w09i03fj/&quot;/&gt;\n\n====\n\nNow that you can think of the Google database as a set of resources,\nyou&#39;ll find that there are a bunch of ideas like this where we can do\ninteresting things by associating these resources.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
