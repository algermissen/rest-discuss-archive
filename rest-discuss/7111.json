Off the top of\nmy head I would have said &quot;No&quot;, but a quick thought exercise failed to\nturn up any counter examples.\n\nSeveral of REST&#39;s constraints separate concerns, which Roy&#39;s\ndissertation explicitly mentions, but others that he doesn&#39;t describe\nas separating concerns, IMO, do.  For example, the uniform interface\nseparates concerns of interface (connector) from component\nimplementation, allowing implementations to vary without the interface\nneeding to change.  Also, &quot;hypermedia&quot; further separates (beyond that\nprovided by the client/server constraint) the concerns of\nindependently evolving client and server implementations.\nStatelessness could also be described, I think, as separating the\nconcerns of message semantics from server or network state.\n\nLuckily, it would only take one counter-example to disprove the\nconjecture.  Can anybody think of one; a constraint on the\nrelationship of architectural elements which does *not* separate any\nconcerns?\n\nMark.\n\nOn 11/28/06, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; [sorry, this is slightly OT, but the best place I know for it]\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The more a system is constrained, the looser coupled are the\n&gt; components&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (because coupling between components is induced by non-pervasive\n&gt; semantics shared between components).\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you agree?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
