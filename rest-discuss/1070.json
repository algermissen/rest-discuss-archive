Do I base my implementation on one of the proposed \n&gt; solutions (all of which have merit - at least to my not yet \n&gt; fully REST-ified mind) or do I not support notifications and rely \n&gt; on a polling solution instead (which in my case is probably \n&gt; borderline acceptable, at least for the initial phase)?\n\nDoing notifications using HTTP is not difficult. At its heart all you\nare doing is setting up an HTTP server on both sides. We got bogged down\ntrying to work out models that would be applicable to all or almost all\npossible event notification situations. It is highly likely that doing\nnotifications for your particular application is relatively simple. If\nyou discuss your requirements maybe we can help.\n\nI think that the biggest PRACTICAL issue with HTTP notifications is the\nsame as with every other protocol: firewalls, NAT and other types of\nassymettric connectivity at the IP level.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
