Be aware of caching implications of (2) when the resource is read- \n&gt;&gt; write.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; This seems to me to be a very good reason not address representations at \n&gt; a different URI, because of these problems it creates.\n&gt; That, of course, assumes that the document in question is correctly \n&gt; identified as a representation and is not actually a separate resource.\n&gt; If it is a separate resource then it definitely needs its own URI, and \n&gt; caching should not be a concern here.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 4. If you are supporting both (1) and (2), when a client submits a  \n&gt;&gt; request with negotiation headers as in (1), return a Content-Location  \n&gt;&gt; header with a value containing media-type specific URI (such http://blah.org/blahbhal?format=xml)\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; This works but, as you have admitted in your third point, it creates an \n&gt; ambiguous distinction between resources and representations, and \n&gt; therefore the significance of a URI. This forces intermediaries to be \n&gt; aware of your application/implementation; is that considered a kind of \n&gt; coupling?\n&gt; \n&gt; What I mean by this is that it is not clear to intermediaries whether \n&gt; /foo and /foo.xml and /foo.doc are the same or separate resources, and \n&gt; this can only be assumed once the intermediary is taught the specifics \n&gt; of your implementation.\n&gt; There is also ambiguity in how this URI -based conneg is actually \n&gt; implemented because xyz application may use this dot notation, but abc \n&gt; application may use something like /foo?type=xml or \n&gt; /foo?accept=application/xml\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; PS: Conneg may be overrated. Although I see APIs serving XML and JSON,  \n&gt;&gt; there is no reason to always support multiple formats. It all depends  \n&gt;&gt; on the use cases and clientele.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s over rated, I think it&#39;s extremely important. \n&gt; Having a design which minimizes the costs involved in extending the \n&gt; formats you support and keeping this out of the URI design gives you \n&gt; optimal flexibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
