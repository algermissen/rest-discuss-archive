Do the links\n&gt; really have to point to versions specifically or can they point to\n&gt; &#39;master&#39; resources that represent the target\n&gt; concept as such?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you really must point to a version and really must point from a\n&gt; version (instead of accumulating the\n&gt; links in the master resource) then you probably just need to duplicate\n&gt; the links.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe it helps to make the links first class objects and version them\n&gt; also?\n&gt;\n&gt; You can find a deeper treatment of the subject here:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://www.coolheads.com/SRNPUBS/ref-track-docs-paper.pdf&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And propably it also helps to have a look at repository software  \n&gt; such as\n&gt; CVS and SVN and how they manage versions and releases etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTH,\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On May 7, 2008, at 10:37 PM, Miles Crawford wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My question is about versioning RESTful resources with URIs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I often see as a &quot;best practice&quot; the user of a version number in\n&gt;&gt; URIs such as:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /v1/person/{username}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and then, if your service changes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /v2/person/{username}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So - here&#39;s my question.  Say my organization wants to create two\n&gt;&gt; services that relate to one another, a generic person service and a\n&gt;&gt; student service. How do I avoid loops that cause troubles with  \n&gt;&gt; version\n&gt;&gt; numbers?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A timeline:\n&gt;&gt; v1 person released, links to v1 student\n&gt;&gt; v1 student releasted, links to v1 person.\n&gt;&gt; time passes...\n&gt;&gt; v2 person released, links to v1 student\n&gt;&gt; time passes...\n&gt;&gt; v2 student released, links to v2 person.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now a client can get a v2 student, link to a v2 person and then link\n&gt;&gt; back to a v1 student.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Has anyone had problems with this type of mismatch?
