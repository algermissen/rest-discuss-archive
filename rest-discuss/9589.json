Do we really need to burden the clie=\r\nnt with the ceremonial\nstuffing of the envelope?\n\nStart by posing the title=\r\n and content. An interesting feature of HTTP\nthat&#39;s often ignored in favor =\r\nof envelopes, is that you can use named\nparameters.  If you can determine t=\r\nhe blog&#39;s posting URL, which is\nfairly easy to do, you&#39;ve covered the basic=\r\ns for WordPress, Blogger\nand MovableType.  I think that&#39;s a good base to st=\r\nart with.  Add\nauthentication -- we&#39;re doing this from the browser, after a=\r\nll -- and\nyou also get the author metadata and access control.\n\nIn response=\r\n, the server will redirect you to a URL where you can\nupdate, publish and d=\r\nelete the post.  Now this being the Browsable\nWeb, we&#39;ll have to do with ju=\r\nst two verbs.\n\nI think we already have enough commonality here to extract a=\r\nn\ninterface that already works for a lot of people to handle all the\ncommon=\r\n cases.  That would be the microformat way of doing things, even\nif we don&#39;=\r\nt involve hAtom directly.\n\n-- Assaf Arkin\n\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Ern=\r\nie P.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
