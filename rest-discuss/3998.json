The paper and the talk explain why the web-calculus\nis a good approach to web services.\n\nI hope this paper will better communicate why I am working on the\nweb-calculus, and encourage others to as well.\n\nI am thinking of submitting this paper to CACM, so I look forward\nto any feedback.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
