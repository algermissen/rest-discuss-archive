I could remember and\n: compose the former, there is no way I could remember the latter (FYI, I\n: frequently like to Wikipedia just by prefixing a term with\n: &quot;www.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;)\n\n1. I can tell you are in sales.\n2. You make assumptions I don&#39;t: have you heard of cut and paste?\n\n: If I&#39;m at a party and someone asked me about some pictures I took, I can\n: just tell them to go to:\n:\n: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschinkel\n:\n\nI guess if they can remember that, several hours and several beers\nlater, then they can probably also remember your name.  That&#39;s\nbetter than I can do.\n\nTypically, I email or IM links to people.  As far as typing into the\nlocation bar of the browser, I avoid it like the plague.\n\n: I share an appreciation for motorcycles with my dad.  I like to send him\n: links in email. Let&#39;s assume the link breaks. Which one is he likely to be\n: able to fix? (and which one is least likely to break?)\n\nBreaks?  You mean line breaks?  Yes, I agree with *short* URI\nin principle.\n\n: But if they were this instead this, it would be much easier for dad to\n: identify and fix those broken links (and much less likely they&#39;d break):\n\nI feel bad for your dad in this case, and if I were he, I&#39;d stick to\nfixing motorcycles, because it would entail much less futile typing.\n\nHonestly, Mike, show your dad how to cut and paste broken (line\nwrapped) URI back together.  As for other breakage, forget it.\n:\n: http://www.suzukicycles.com/bikes/drz400sm/2007/\n: http://www.kawasaki.com/bikes/ninja-650r/2007/\n: http://www.yamaha-motor.com/bikes/fjr12300a/2007/\n: http://powersports.honda.com/bikes/rc51/2006/\n:\n: Now, let&#39;s say that I wanted to send him a link to look at the 50th\n: Anniversary Sportster. See the link below? Tell me what I should send him.\n: Go head. Open it up. And tell me what link.\n\nI&#39;m afraid....\n\n\nWalden \n\n\n"}}
