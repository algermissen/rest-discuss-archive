Unfortunately, it&#39;s\n&gt; intended to be displayed only when a login attempt fails.\n\nYes, sorry. That was my point. I just wasn&#39;t terribly clear.\n\n \n&gt; In truth, the dialog box bothers me less and less.  I think the browser\n&gt; makers could dress it up a bit, making it look more like a feature of the\n&gt; browser instead of a out-of-place dumpy dialog box.\n\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, the exact means by which users authenticate\nwill always need to be under application control because clients like\nit that way. I don&#39;t know many websites that use basic auth now, but\nones that offer &quot;login&quot; forms abound, and not just for non-techies.\n\nEven from a webservices perspective my suggested change to the 401\nbehaviour looks useful: a server might want to supply to a client a\npage describing the authentication system to be used. Maybe a user\ntoken can be obtained from an ldap server somewhere, or something\nlike that.\n\n\n&gt; As for the &#39;logout&#39; bit, I think this gets back to some of the theories\n&gt; behind REST itself.  My understanding is that 401 allows you to\n&gt; *authenticate*, not *log in*.  &quot;Logging in&quot; implies maintaining some form of\n&gt; server-side session state, which is a big REST no-no (at least as I\n&gt; understand it).  In this view, it makes sense that there would not be a\n&gt; corresponding &quot;logout&quot; ability.\n\nIt depends what you mean by &quot;login&quot; doesn&#39;t it  /8-&gt;\n\nDoes REST really require that there be no server maintained state at\nall? I thought the problem was how the association between server and\nclient is done: if it&#39;s done RESTfully (one way would be by\nauthentication) then it&#39;s ok isn&#39;t it?\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
