When I subscribed to the REST group, I simply\nused my old, ra=\r\nrely used, anonymous backup mail account at yahoo.com -\nhence the fake name=\r\n. I created profile to use with this group,\nthinking (obviously, wrong), th=\r\nat system would pickup my real name\nfrom the profile, but obviously it didn=\r\n&#39;t. It should be ok from now on.\n\nWell, back to the business  :-) \n\nYes, it=\r\n slipped from my mind that interactions are completely\nstateless and that t=\r\nhe client has to provide complete state with every\nrequest sent to the serv=\r\ner. So the original sentences\n\n&quot;By means of that URI and selected OPERATION=\r\n derived from UNIFORM\nINTERFACE (GET, PUT, ...) that RESOURCE is being mani=\r\npulated with,\nmeaning that ANY number of ACTIONS are being initiated &quot;behin=\r\nd the\nscenes&quot; on server. Those ACTIONS will bring APPLICATION to NEW STATE\n=\r\nand our client will receive the REPRESENTATION of some RESOURCE which\ndescr=\r\nibes that NEW (but now CURRENT) STATE of APPLICATION.&quot;\n\nwould be more accur=\r\nate when written like this:\n\n&quot;By means of that URI and selected OPERATION d=\r\nerived from UNIFORM\nINTERFACE (GET, PUT, ...) that RESOURCE is being manipu=\r\nlated with,\nmeaning that ANY number of ACTIONS are being initiated &quot;behind =\r\nthe\nscenes&quot; on server. These ACTIONS will result in &quot;shifting\nAPPLICATION&#39;S=\r\n focus&quot; (blah, there has to be a better term) from\noriginally targeted RESO=\r\nURCE to another RESOURCE (by\ncreating/updating/retrieving that another RESO=\r\nURCE ?), and our client\nwill receive the REPRESENTATION of that RESOURCE, t=\r\nhus being\nTRANSFERED (the client) to a NEW STATE.&quot;\n\n\nAs you can see, I&#39;m a =\r\nbit confused about what&#39;s actually happening on\nthe server and how that fit=\r\ns in REST&#39;s boundaries. That &quot;shifting of\nfocus&quot; is basically a lame statem=\r\nent trying to express that there is\nsome kind of transition of state happen=\r\ning on the server too - we do\nhave some application whose back-end processe=\r\ns are implemented in some\nprogramming language. When a request (URI+operati=\r\non) hits a resource,\nsome of those back-end processes are being triggered, =\r\nresulting\neffectively in &quot;some kind of change of the STATE&quot; - state of thos=\r\ne\nback-end processes (but obviously that&#39;s another kind of state, not\nthe s=\r\ntate that REST is all about). When these processes are completed,\nwe have a=\r\ns the result that another RESTful RESOURCE, whose\nrepresentation will be de=\r\nlivered to the client as server&#39;s response to\nthe initial request.\n\nBasical=\r\nly, when trying to think in the REST way, I have to forget\nabout all the ba=\r\nck-end processes and activities that are triggered by\nrequests? Those are a=\r\nctually outside of REST&#39;s scope? Request issued\nupon some resource will tri=\r\ngger some actions, those actions will\nproduce another resource, but those a=\r\nctions and all of the related\ninternals are beyond REST (i.e. it doesn&#39;t ma=\r\ntter how it&#39;s done)?\n\nDoes that make sense  :-)  ?\n\nBest regards,\n    Miran=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
