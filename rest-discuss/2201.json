The meaning of HTTP PUT is\n&gt;directly analagous to an &#39;upsert&#39; in DB land.\n&gt;The reason POST is an INSERT is that it is not idempotent - if you call\n&gt;INSERT on your table 3 times, you get 3 records. If you call UPDATE on your\n&gt;table 3 times you get one very fresh record.\n&gt;\nBut POST doesn&#39;t always mean insert (where insert mean create new \nresource).  A POST to a resource R can have one of three general results \n(ignoring errors):\n    1. the creation of a new resource S\n    2. a modification to R&#39;s state resulting in R&#39;\n    3. no change in R&#39;s state\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
