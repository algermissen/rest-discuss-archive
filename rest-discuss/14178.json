For example, you cannot convey to the client number\n&gt; of a leasing contract without a markup for contracts (or even leasing\n&gt; contracts). The domain model has to propagate into the media types -  \n&gt; that\n&gt; is unavoidable.\n&gt; \n\nI disagree.  If I were designing a REST system to deal with leasing\ncontracts, the first thing I would do is research whether or not there\nexists a standard for representing leasing contracts.  Upon finding\nnone, my options as a REST developer are to re-use an existing media\ntype by extending it to handle the specifics of a lease-contract\nrepresentation, or create a new media type.\n\nIf I do create a new media type, I wouldn&#39;t call the result RESTful\nunless and until that media type is standardized.  I would simply use\nXHTML as the media type.  If the client number is important\ninformation, then I would identify it as such using RDFa or a\nmicroformat approach, i.e. assign @id=&#39;client_number&#39; thereby giving\nclients the ability to glean a client number from any XHTML\nrepresentation of a lease contract.  Clients that aren&#39;t interested in\nthe client number will gracefully degrade, displaying a human-readable\ndocument.\n\nWhereas, if I create a new media type, I&#39;d be reinventing a whole bunch\nof different wheels -- headings, paragraphs, boldface, italics, links,\nlink relations, HTTP methods and the whole #!.  Clients that don&#39;t\nunderstand this new markup language will ignore the markup they don&#39;t\nrecognize and display the representation as a big puddle of text.\n\nMy rule of thumb remains:  Don&#39;t create a new media type, when the\ntechnology exists to extend any number of existing media types to solve\nthe problem.  Creating media types is hard, hard work -- if done\nproperly.\n\nUnfortunately, I mostly see new media types being created for the sole\npurpose of serving as a &quot;token&quot; to guide server behavior (mostly by\nredefining method semantics).  Such media types aren&#39;t really media\ntypes at all -- they&#39;re another way to send instructions to a server,\ninstead of following REST by sending a representation of an application\nstate to the server.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
