Bjorg &lt;steveb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  In my prior life at M$, we did a lot of research on\n&gt;  applying [pi-calculus] to writing applications.  While that experience formed the\n&gt;  design of how our REST framework (MindTouch Dream) pipes requests\n&gt;  through the system, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s very pi-ish.  Pi&#39;s ultra-focus on\n&gt;  discrete events made it a pain working with sequences of messages and\n&gt;  open-ended streams of information.  Unfortunately, these are more\n&gt;  often the norm than the exception.\n\nI did not have the whole of pi-calculus in mind when I made my rash invocation.\nJust that in my limited understanding, pi-calc is similarly stateless.\n\nThe pi-calc jocks in the w3c choreography grp thought it wd be\npossible to do choreography on the web in a stateless manner (using\nsomething analogous to the REST definition of stateless).  That ended\nup being a bit too radical for the eventual group consensus.  I see\nthey are still at it:\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/\n\nThis group is implementing the resultant WS-CDL specs apparently in a\nmore pi-calc style:\nhttp://www.pi4tech.org/tiki-index.php\n\nI&#39;m way out of touch, but I don&#39;t think that stuff ended up being\nRESTful in any sense of the word.\n\n"}}
