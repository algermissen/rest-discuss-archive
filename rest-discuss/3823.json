The\nsolution to this (not widely used yet, too many people seem to love C)\nis the notion of pre- and postcondition:\n\n1. If the client fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting\n   all the conditions stated in the precondition,\n\n2. then the server fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting\n   all the conditions stated in the postcondition.\n\nEverything beyond that is of no concern to the client.\n\n\nExplicit pre- and postconditions are missing from REST, but that it is\nall you need. If the precondition states that you can PUT, you can. If\nthe postcondition states that the result of the PUT is that a GET\nreturns the putted resource, than that&#39;s all there is.\n\nIf you seek an understanding of how different resouces work together\nand how to accomplish certain tasks (booking a meeting with different\nparticipans for example), that has and will always be part of the\ndocumentation. That&#39;s just part of the architecture. UI don&#39;t see any\nmetamodel solving that problem.\n\n-- \nRegards,\n\nBerend. (-:\n\n\n"}}
