The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\n&gt; &gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http\n&gt; &gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\n&gt; &gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\n&gt; &gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any application of cookies breaks REST, because they are by definition\n&gt; stateful, and all REST interactions are stateless.\n\nBut on one level are cookies not pieces of state representation that\nget transferred between client and server? Isn&#39;t it just the fact that\nthey &#39;stick&#39; that makes it possible to break the stateless http model\nwith cookies?\n\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; they don&#39;t have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of doing\n&gt; &quot;sessions&quot; statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker.
