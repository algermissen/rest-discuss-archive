I don&#39;t know of any aspect of the protocol\nthat explicitly deals with frames.\n\nFrames are a way to deal with the gap between the idealized &#39;resource model&#39;\napproach supportable by HTTP and the &#39;user-interaction model&#39; approach\nsupported by browser client apps and familiar with many developers - coupled\nwith server-side technology that didn&#39;t always support dynamically creating\nrepresentations easily. A server-side-include/template mechanism pretty much\nremoves the need for client-side frames. Frames as &#39;client-side-includes&#39;\n(paul - correct me on the terminology) were used when you didn&#39;t have\nserver-side-includes.\n\nOther representation languages and clients do not need to follow the\nhtml/frameset approach.\n\nCookies - in my opinion - are a valid approach to provide stateful\napplications without making the protocol stateful (which would be a Bad\nThing). Their use grew outside this problem space and started to take on\nthings better provided by the protocol - like user identification (cookies\nwith sessionId) and resource identification (I&#39;ve seen redirect locations,\n&#39;next page&#39;, etc in cookies).\n\nI think a lot of stuff has built up to support browser-client access for the\n&#39;visual web&#39; application. I believe there is a need to step back and take a\nlook at the HTTP with an eye toward machine-to-machine communication. We\nshould not just re-apply every aspect of existing HTTP tools (servers, etc)\nto this new application - we should apply the protocol basics where they\nfit, regardless of &#39;common use&#39; by the visual web.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
