It might make more sense for you to say\n&gt; &gt; that every\n&gt; &gt; resource under /report/ exists with empty state until\n&gt; &gt; such time as it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; modified.  A Wiki could work like this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I can see cases where one would represent the initial\n&gt; state of resources as a 204. I&#39;ll keep that in mind. But in\n&gt; such cases, wouldn&#39;t the original response to a\n&gt; /reportmaker request be a 201 Created instead of a 202\n&gt; Accepted?\n\nHmm, no.  So long as the processing happens later, 202 is fine.\n\n&gt; &gt; Another option is 404, as that would acknowledge that the\n&gt; &gt; resource\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t yet been &quot;created&quot;.  I&#39;ve used both 204 and 404\n&gt; &gt; depending upon\n&gt; &gt; the situation.  This feels more like a 404 to me though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Using a 404 sounds like a good idea. But wouldn&#39;t this be\n&gt; confusing for clients? That is, how can a client\n&gt; differentiate between the following cases?\n&gt; 1. No report was created with this URI and nothing is in\n&gt; the works.\n&gt; 2. A report is in process for this address.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would providing a listing service\n&gt; (/inprogresslist?queryparams) be a viable solution?\n\nI&#39;d do as the other poster suggested.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
