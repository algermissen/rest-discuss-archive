Simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and clean in theory, but in practice it collides badly with my ISPs server\n&gt; &gt; &gt; configuration.  Similarly, I have found that client tools like curl and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lwp-request make you jump through hoops to use PUT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; curl -T filename url ?\n&gt;\n&gt; And you display the error messages how?  and URL-encode the file how?\n&gt; These aren&#39;t rocket science, they&#39;re just a sign of immature tech.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conclusion: not ready for prime time.  If I, as a longtime Un*x geek, have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hassles in using PUT, clients using my API and other programmers building\n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar RESTful web services will find it a serious problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *shrug* works for me.  The only time I use POST for PUTting is to support\n&gt; &gt; browsers, which is only a small part of the systems I build.  I also\n&gt; &gt; always control the Web server (at least so far).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ask your ISP to turn it on; if they care about developers, they might.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s the only way things will improve.  But if you&#39;re happy to suck up\n&gt; &gt; the architectural costs of using POST for PUT (which aren&#39;t that big,\n&gt; &gt; really), more power to you.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to be clear about my motivations here: to get real.  We talk about\n&gt; this stuff as if implementation was beneath us.  Oh, the REST evangelist\n&gt; goes, that&#39;s just CGI.  It&#39;s just server configuration.  It&#39;s just a bit\n&gt; of perl.  But *which* CGI?  Which configuration?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
