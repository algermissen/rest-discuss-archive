In this \ncase it is my contention that following the specifications leads to \ngreater efficiency and greater profits. Companies so incompetent that \nthey cannot manage a firewall or proxy server will be beaten by \ncompanies that can. Precisely because the market prefers competent, \nprofitable, efficient companies, the pointy-haired will be weeded out.\n\nWe&#39;re not advocating following the spec for the spec&#39;s sake. We&#39;re \nadvocating following the spec because it works better than not following \nit.\n\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
