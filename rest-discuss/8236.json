The Restlet open source project was launched at the end of 2005 and \nwas the first REST framework for Java. Since its launch, it has \nattracted an active and quickly growing community of users. With more \nthan sixty different contributors and two core developers, the project \nwent through an intense and fruitful collaborative design.\n\nSeveral applications are already deployed in production within \norganizations of various sizes, including Overstock.com, an Internet \nleader for brand names at clearance prices. The Restlet project is also \nused as a support technology for various software architecture classes \ncovering the REST architecture style, for example at University of \nCalifornia Irvine, or at the INSA Rouen engineering school.\n\nNOELIOS, as the founder and leader of the project is now offering a \ncomplete professional support, including yearly subscription plans and a \nper-incident plan, with prices ranging from 350 � to 2850 �. It also \noffers some expert consulting services on Restlet and connected \ntechnologies such as Java, XML and REST.\n\nChanges log:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.0/changes\n\nDownload links:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/downloads/1.0/restlet-1.0.0.exe\nhttp://www.restlet.org/downloads/1.0/restlet-1.0.0.zip\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.noelios.com\n\n\n"}}
