The meaning of HTTP PUT is\ndirectly analagous to an &#39;upsert&#39; in DB land.\nThe reason POST is an INSERT is that it is not idempotent - if you call\nINSERT on your table 3 times, you get 3 records. If you call UPDATE on your\ntable 3 times you get one very fresh record.\n\nI think there was a message quite a while ago on the comparison of CRUD &\nSQL with HTTP methods - can&#39;t find it right now...\n\n\n"}}
