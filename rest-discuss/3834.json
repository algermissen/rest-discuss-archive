I didn&#39;t realize.  We should\n&gt; add this to the FAQ, as we&#39;ve had this twice before I think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s 400, sometimes it&#39;s 200.  It depends on the method too.\n&gt; For PUT, I&#39;d use 400, because to return 200 would be telling\n&gt; intermediaries that what was sent, was stored.  For POST, more than\n&gt; likely I&#39;d use 200, because I may want to resolve the bad data problem\n&gt; by, for example, driving the application to ask for the data again,\n&gt; and perhaps I want to count the retries or some such.  If I used 400,\n&gt; then the application makes no progress, so I can&#39;t do that.  I think.\n&gt; Funny how such a seemingly simple question opens up the whole &quot;state&quot;\n&gt; can-o-worms.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
