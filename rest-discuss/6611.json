RDF Schema or\n&gt; OWL  could  be  use to describe the data, all in one single RDF graph,\n&gt; delivered as application/rdf+xml\n\nAt the moment I don&#39;t think there is strong evidence that RDF Schema or\nOWL form useful descriptions of the semantics their corresponding\ndocuments convey. I don&#39;t think there is strong evidence that RDF is a\ngood model or that its encodings are good formats for transferring\ninformation. RDF is harder to process into internal representations than\nXML, and it is the internal representations that programs work from: Not\nthe abstract RDF graph. Semantics (what the program will do with it) are\nthen described in program code that operates on the data. The best\nschema will be one that the author of the program code understands. The\nsemantic meaning of particular content type data is transferred out of\nband through that programmer.\n\nMy opinion is that best practice for content-type (i.e. ontology)\ndefinition is to encode data in XML, and specify it through a\ncommunity-driven process as a human-oriented text.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
