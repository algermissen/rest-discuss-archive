I&#39;ve never learned Linda (or\nJavaSpaces etc.) so I don&#39;t see how the references are relevant.\n\nWhat is the relationship to Linda?\nHow is a &quot;resource&quot; isomporphic to a &quot;tuple space&quot;?\nHow are the HTTP methods isomorphic to Linda out(), in(), rd(), eval()?\nHistorically speaking, was HTTP designed to be &quot;like&quot; Linda?\n\nI note the following claim for IBM&#39;s TSpaces:\n\n * Data is de-coupled from programs. Data can outlive its producer\n(because once it&#39;s produced, it lives in tuple space) and can be\nproduced before the receiver exists. \n\n * Communication is anonymous. The sender needn&#39;t know about the\nreceiver, and vice-versa. Sender and receiver only need to know about\ntuple space, which mediates all communication. \n\n * Communication is asynchronous. The sender and receiver don&#39;t have to\nrendezvous to communicate; the producer produces when it&#39;s ready, and\nthe consumer consumes when it&#39;s ready. \n\nNone of these seem to apply to HTTP to me. I have no doubt that you\ncould build a Linda layer on top of HTTP but I have trouble seeing how\nit is &quot;already there.&quot;\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
