I&#39;m speaking of controls that would be\n&gt; displayed as plain text, maybe appended at the end of the text\n&gt; representation as a tiny domain specific language. Nothing would\n&gt; change to the processing rule of text/plain. But the presence of a\n&gt; certain link relation would allow a user agent to parse the dsl and\n&gt; allow a person to activate them. In the context of a command line\n&gt; interface, that could be practical.\n\nthat&#39;s an interesting idea, and to some extent (just thinking beyond \nonly links here) you&#39;re proposing some form of markdown (i am using this \nterm generically here), right? i am afraid there are many variants of \nthat, and i haven&#39;t seen any one standardized, but maybe the original \none does have quite a bit of adoption. if a markdown variant would \nofficially declare what its profile URI is, then it would be quite a \nsmart way of telling clients that they could do a better job of \nrendering content, if they received text/plain associated with that \nprofile URI.\n\n&gt; How could a link relation could be add to a text/plain response?\n\nsince text/plain has no standardized way where to put links that could \nbe used, the only possible way would be the context, so in case of HTTP \nthat would be a Link header. if text/plain were redefined to also allow \na media type parameter named &quot;profile&quot; (as recommended in \nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-profile-link-02#section-3.1), \nthen this would be another good place to put it (and one that could be \nused in emails as well, which is not the case for the HTTP Link header).\n\ngreat idea, are you planning to implement this in some way? cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
