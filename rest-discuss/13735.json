The existence of links is defined \n&gt;&gt; either by the webmaster, or by search engines. How this translates to \n&gt;&gt; machines ?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t true. The WWW is not read-only for humans, as we can do all \n&gt; manner of things that affect the state of the server (Wiki&#39;s are the \n&gt; most blatant example, but just about anything that receives a POST acts \n&gt; on it, and doesn&#39;t throw away the result is an example).
