To truly realize the benefits of REST both client and s=\r\nerver\n&gt; &gt;    have to be good citizens.\n&gt; &gt;    - The server is the critical =\r\npath. It&#39;s responsibility is to expose\n&gt; &gt;    resources in a manner that is=\r\n consistent with adhering to the constraints.\n&gt; &gt;    That means it sticks t=\r\no the uniform interface (headers, media types),\n&gt; &gt;    supports caching, us=\r\nes hypermedia etc.\n&gt; &gt;    - The client must also adhere to REST constraints=\r\n. If it does not,\n&gt; &gt;    then the overall benefits of REST are not achieved=\r\n within that system. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;    responsibility is to consume resources in =\r\na RESTful manner, i.e. use the\n&gt; &gt;    uniform interface, consumes hypermedi=\r\na, obeys caching requirements, etc.\n&gt; &gt;    - A client not obeying the rules=\r\n does not necessarily remove all\n&gt; &gt;    benefits of REST for the server, th=\r\nough it can if it is the ONLY client.\n&gt; &gt;    - Not enough emphasis is put o=\r\nn this division of responsibilities when\n&gt; &gt;    talking about REST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Thoughts?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Glenn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Mar 10, 2012 at 1:0=\r\n6 PM, William Martinez Pomares &lt;\n&gt; &gt; wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; **\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fine then, Glenn, here it is plain answer:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a. Yes if y=\r\nou define RESTFulness as a badge that certifies you follow the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rules. =\r\nYes, you can earn that badge only in your server and forget about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the =\r\nclient.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; b. NO, if you define RESTFulness as the achievement of th=\r\ne expected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; quality properties you seek for when using REST. And that N=\r\nO is because the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rules are made to achieve a way of interaction betwee=\r\nn the components, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one of those components is the client.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n In other words, client matters.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As I had been posting here, one =\r\ncomponent may not behave by the rules,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but if that is free license the=\r\n architect is aware of and it is reasonable\n&gt; &gt;&gt; so that the impact will no=\r\nt break the business goals, that is fine. But if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you need a system whe=\r\nre clients behave correctly, and you don&#39;t control the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; clients, then y=\r\nour architecture must have controls and policy enforcement\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to avoid th=\r\nose spoiled clients from ruining you day. If not, your system\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will not=\r\n get to its goal and it will be a failure, even if your server is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; made=\r\n by the REST book.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; REST stops when it defines the constrains and =\r\npromises quality\n&gt; &gt;&gt; properties, but life goes on, and the rest of the sys=\r\ntem is still to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; constructed. Having just one server following REST =\r\nrules is just one step.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And let me clarify this: It should not be part=\r\n of the server&#39;s job to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; assure the client is working as it should. It =\r\nmay help, but we can have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; several layers that can add controls and enf=\r\norce policies. There is far\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more in an system than just one server and=\r\n one client.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Finally: I feel the discussion confuses an App, with=\r\n a Server, with a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; System, with a API. When we talk about a server doin=\r\ng its part, sounds like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we are talking about an API. Is it that? Yes, =\r\nwe can expose a REST like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; API, but then we need a client to consume it=\r\n. A system is something far\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more complex, where all components, includ=\r\ning clients, may affect other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; components. Butterfly effect, that is ca=\r\nlled.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, this was not a short and sweet answer, and I feel I&#39;m=\r\n repeating\n&gt; &gt;&gt; myself here. But it is truly a more deep discussion than ju=\r\nst earning a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; badge.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; William.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My point was that this is not a contest of who can earn the REST=\r\n badge.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; question I am seeking clarification on is whether o=\r\nr not the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RESTfulness of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a system is confined to the server or =\r\nnot / what defines the scope of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My un=\r\nderstanding up until now is that REST really is confined to how the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nserver is implemented and does not directly include the client However\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; questioning that understanding.

The result can impact how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; speak/educate about REST and also how I build RESTful systems.
