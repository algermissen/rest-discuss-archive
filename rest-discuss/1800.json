In\nREST terms: with PUT I am sending the entity as a representation to create or\nreplace the resource at the URI provided on the request line; and with POST, I\nam sending the entity as a representation that is *subordinate* to the resource\nat the URI provided on the request line.\n\nWhat it means to &quot;create&quot; or &quot;replace&quot; or &quot;send a subordinate&quot; is up to the\nserver on the other side of the URI.  Heck, for PUT and/or POST, the URI may not\neven physically exist.\n\n-Philip\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jeffrey Winter [mailto:j.winter@...]\nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 3:37 PM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Is REST CRUD?\n\n\nI agree with Mark on the interpretation of POST.\n\nFrom the RFC [1]:\n\n    9.6 PUT\n\n       [...]\n\n       The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is\n       reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a\n       POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed\n       entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to\n       some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.\n       In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed\n       with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the\n       server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.\n\nStill, how might subtle differences in interpretation of the non-GET methods\neffect the adoption of the REST model?  If web services are built that\ndon&#39;t follow these guidelines strictly enough, what sorts of\nproblems could emerge for developers attempting to integrate with them?\n\n[1] http://rfc.net/rfc2616.html\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;mbaker@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;jbone@...&gt;; &lt;robert@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 8:45 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Is REST CRUD?\n\n\nI don&#39;t like your description of POST there Jeff.  POSTed data need not\nhave anything to do with being a representation of the resource to which\nit&#39;s being POSTed.  Like POSTing a representation of a pair of shoes to\na shopping cart.\n\nIt&#39;s just &quot;take this data&quot;, with the (critical) proviso that a\nsuccessful response just means that the data was accepted, nothing more.\ni.e. you need not tunnel with it to use it.\n\nMB\n\n[snip]\n\n\n"}}
