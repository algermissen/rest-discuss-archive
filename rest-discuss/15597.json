I gather the SHOULD is:\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the variant\n&gt;    corresponding to the response entity;  especially in the case\n&gt;    where a resource has multiple entities associated with it, and\n&gt; those entities actually have separate locations by which they might be\n&gt;    individually accessed, the server SHOULD provide a Content-Location\n&gt;    for the particular variant which is returned. &quot;[1]\n&gt; \n&gt; You read that particular SHOULD statement as a prescriptive as in &quot;you\n&gt; SHOULD expose those entities at separate locations.&quot;  And I read it to\n&gt; mean, &quot;when the situation exists, you SHOULD do it this way&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nThe English is plain.  &quot;A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for\nthe variant corresponding to the response entity.&quot;  It then goes on to\nnote that this is *especially* the case if certain conditions are met.\nThis does _not_ mean that the SHOULD only applies *if* those conditions\nare met.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t\n&gt; interpret it as asserting whether or not the existence of the\n&gt; situation itself is good or not.\n&gt; \n\nWe&#39;re talking about a situation where the server is responding with a\nvariant of a negotiated resource.  Therefore, the SHOULD directly\napplies to the situation, without passing any judgments on it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Put another way, if we had a weather forecast:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://weather.example.com/zip/22180\n&gt; \n&gt; You seem to suggest it&#39;s desireable to have:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://weather.example.com/zip/22180.txt\n&gt; http://weather.example.com/zip/22180.html\n&gt; http://weather.example.com/zip/22180.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; and I think the former as desirable.\n&gt;\n\nYes, I agree, the former is desirable for the negotiated resource.  The\nlatter are also desirable as they meet the conditions of the SHOULD.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve read web architecture[2]\n&gt; and don&#39;t see the basis for your conclusion that identifying variants\n&gt; is particularly desirable.\n&gt;\n\nThen refer to REST, where this desirability is called the\n&quot;identification of resources constraint.&quot;  If you are developing REST,\nthen all REST&#39;s constraints are particularly desirable.  If you are not\ndeveloping a REST system, then go ahead and violate the identification\nof resources constraint, I won&#39;t stop you.  But don&#39;t violate that\nconstraint and call the result REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Unless I&#39;ve misinterpreted Roy&#39;s thoughts,\n&gt; I gather he supports the former:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;If the resource is a concept independent of\n&gt;   representation format, then its URI must not have any aspect\n&gt;   that is specific to the representation format.&quot;[3]\n&gt; \n\nRoy is saying, don&#39;t negotiate for a URI ending in *.txt, basically.\nThis doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Personally, I see the coupling introduced with a @type attribute as\n&gt; much less offensive than the coupling (resource&lt;-&gt;representation) that\n&gt; occurs by having the variants in their own URIs.\n&gt;\n\nWhat coupling is that?  Allowing the representation to be a resource in\nits own right by assigning it a URI, is decoupling.  Only being able to\naccess that representation directly through @type is the coupling that\nassigning URIs to variants avoids...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You asked a fair question: what does it break/what&#39;s the downside?  I\n&gt; think it breaks the essential ideal in REST that URIs identify\n&gt; resources as concepts separate from their representation.\n&gt;\n\nThe essential ideas in REST are called constraints; following the\nIdentification of Resources constraint does not violate any other\nconstraints.  Identification of Resources states that any resource you\nwish to manipulate must first have its own URI.  If you intend to\nmanipulate variants (or cache them), you must first identify those\nvariants as resources, otherwise you are breaking this constraint, as\nhas been pointed out 1000 times on this list as best-practice.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re\n&gt; relating resources together (e.g. linked data), for consistency, it&#39;s\n&gt; important to link the concepts together not a specific representation.\n&gt;\n\nThen link to negotiated URIs instead of variant URIs.  The ability to\nlink the concepts together, not specific representations, is provided\nby content negotiation.  Assigning URIs to variants does not negate\nthis ability.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think the Cool URIs[4] document makes the case too.\n&gt; \n\nQuote, please.  Cool URIs says nothing about representation vs.\nresource.  It discusses the maintenance of URIs once they&#39;ve been\nassigned, but has nothing to do with this topic.\n\nNone of which matters.  All that matters here, is RFC2616&#39;s\nadmonishment, &quot;A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the\nvariant corresponding to the response entity&quot;.  Black-and-white,\ncut-and-dried, no ifs, ands or buts about it, for all the reasons of\nmaking caches and user-agents work that I&#39;ve mentioned in this thread.\n\nBest practice is best practice for valid reasons, here.  The only\nreason that&#39;s a SHOULD and not a MUST, is that a MUST would require us\nto assign URIs to the compressed and the uncompressed variants of a\nresource.  For that reason, a MUST makes no sense.  If that isn&#39;t your\nreason, then abide by the SHOULD, by assigning URIs to variants.\n\nYour REST system will thank you.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
