As soon as you assign any meaning to a URI, then\n&gt; &gt; only those privy to that meaning are in on your little secrets (like\n&gt; &gt; appending &quot;/subs&quot; means &quot;subscribers to the URI before /subs&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; Interoperability means sacrificing private convention for public\n&gt; &gt; specification.  So you make the URI-to-URI relationship explicit with\n&gt; &gt; a statement, such as is done with an HTTP header or an RDF statement,\n&gt; &gt; etc..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; That statement (the name and location of the information) is still a little\n&gt; secret that only those in the know.\n&gt; However, it may be better to move that out of the URI, and also do something\n&gt; to ensure backward compatibility - like defining these as &#39;advisory&#39; and\n&gt; optional. These turns the http response into a multi-link (or something -\n&gt; Paul, help me out here) with named references to interesting sub-properities\n&gt; of the resource. If those sub-properties are addressable, they are also\n&gt; probably subscribable. So a DAV Properties: specified URI should be\n&gt; listenable for just property (not content) changes.\n\nOk.\n\n&gt; If an HTTP WATCH method were to be used, would OPTIONS return that fact?\n&gt; Does it operate per resource? (ignoring the extra requests to figure stuff\n&gt; out)\n\nOPTIONS works on the whole req/resp chain, including the resource\n(except when &quot;*&quot; is used).  Yah, it should have the Allow header\nin the response which would tell you what methods were supported.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
