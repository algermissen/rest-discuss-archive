As I understand\n&gt; the comments, the problem is not the use of PUT to make a copy per se,\n&gt; merely the use of an HTTP header to provide the URL for source of the copy\n&gt; instead of using an &quot;enclosed entity&quot; (as RFC 2616 calls it) containing the\n&gt; URL for the source of the copy.\n\nWell, an entity includes its entity headers too, including any special\nheaders AWS invents.\n\nAWS has invented a hypertext message with all the link information in\nits extension headers.\n\nThey don&#39;t seem to have invented a special Content-type for it, but I\nhaven&#39;t read their whole spec. If they would invent a Content-type,\nthen a server receiving that PUT message would know how to process\nthese (bodyless) documents properly.\n\nSeems ok to me.\n\nThe questionable part might overloading PUT to mean COPY, but if you\nbelieve PUT has the flexibility to interpret the entity and do\nsomething creative that ends up with a resource being available at\nthat URI, then no problem. This is like the PATCH discussion. I think\nmost people thought it was wrong to PUT a special differences document\n-- but I was unconvinced.\n\nIt&#39;s wrong to suppose that any agent is going to PUT these documents\nto some unsuspecting server and something bad will happen. I&#39;m not\ngoing to let my agent PUT these anywhere I haven&#39;t been instructed to\nby some hypertext I received earlier, or by reading the documentation.\n\nIf I do PUT it to some random server, I can&#39;t say what exactly what\nwill happen, but whatever it is, it will be what I deserve.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What threw me off a bit was Julian&#39;s question about why Amazon didn&#39;t use\n&gt; COPY or POST. As I understand it, simply substituting POST for PUT in the\n&gt; example I posted earlier in the thread wouldn&#39;t really solve the problem\n&gt; since POST, like PUT, requires that an enclosed entity be used -- not an\n&gt; HTTP header.\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifically, the section on PUT (9.6) says: &quot;The PUT method requests that\n&gt; the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.&quot; While the\n&gt; section on POST (9.5) says: &quot;The POST method is used to request that the\n&gt; origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate\n&gt; of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nHugh\n\n(asshole?)\n\n"}}
