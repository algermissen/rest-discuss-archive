The server returns a URL to the\nnewly created resource.  Later, we realize that we need to change a part of\nthe resource, so we want to update only that part.  So why not just POST the\nentire &quot;resource&quot; (the same that was PUT earlier, but now with the change)\nto the given URL for the resource?  The server can then compare them and\ndetermine if the change is allowed or not.\n\nAs an alternative, when the original resource is PUT on the server, the\nserver could return a series of URLs.  The first URL would be for the\nresource itself.  The additional URLs would be for different representations\nof the resource that effectively allow limited interaction with parts of the\nresource.  For instance, you may get a response like this:\n\n&lt;purchaseOrder&gt;\n    &lt;URL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345&lt;/URL&gt;\n    &lt;editable&gt;\n\n&lt;ShippingAddressURL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345/shipTo&lt;/Ship\npingAddressURL&gt;\n\n&lt;ShippingMethodURL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345/shipVia&lt;/Ship\npingMethodURL&gt;\n    &lt;/editable&gt;\n&lt;/purchaseOrder&gt;\n\n\nNow, you could POST to any of the above URLs the parts that you want to\nupdate.  If the requested update is in the shipping address only, then you\ncould use &lt;ShippingAddressURL&gt; and send only that part of the purchaseOrder.\nThis technique would allow each business to determine how much or how little\nof the resource can be edited simply by returning only the URLs that allow\nediting.  Of course, this technique is that it requires both parties to know\na common vocabulary, which may or may not be a good thing.  :)\n\n\nOr has all of this been covered already?  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
