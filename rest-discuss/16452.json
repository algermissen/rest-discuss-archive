But,\nit will work for any negotiated resource.  The assumption is that any\nresource only has one Atom variant, otherwise this method of service\ndiscovery doesn&#39;t work any better than using a hideous well-known URI.\n\n(The purist in me thinks &#39;Accept: text/robots&#39; should 301-redirect to\nmy robots.txt -- or whatever else I choose to call it -- file, which\nmay be on a path &#39;shorter&#39; than the requested hierarchy.)\n\nBTW, I&#39;m not claiming my demo is entirely RESTful, I just meant to say\nI see nothing unRESTful about my use of cookies.  In addition to the\nREST mismatch I already mentioned (XBEL), I&#39;ve added another -- which\nI&#39;ll get around to asking about if nobody gets it, as I&#39;m currently\nstumped.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
