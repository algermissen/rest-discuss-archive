So, I shouldn&#39;t\n&gt;             have an image resource that uses content negotiation to\n&gt;             decide whether to return SVG, JPG, PNG, etc. that also\n&gt;             allows you to PUT a new SVG version of that image? The\n&gt;             only way to update that image is to POST to a\n&gt;             container/manager? And there&#39;s no way to DELETE the image?\n&gt;\n&gt;              \n&gt;\n&gt;             that can&#39;t be right ...\n&gt;\n&gt;              \n&gt;\n&gt;             -Lee\n&gt;\n&gt;                 ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;\n&gt;                 * From:* Chuck Hinson &lt;mailto:cmhinson@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                 So in the case of resources with multiple\n&gt;                 representations, or resources\n&gt;                 that have query strings, does it make sense to\n&gt;                 constrain DELETE in the\n&gt;                 same way the Fielding says PUT is constrained\n&gt;                 (resources that have\n&gt;                 multiple representation should not support PUT).\n&gt;\n&gt;                 I suspect that it probably isnt reasonable to require\n&gt;                 this constraint of\n&gt;                 DELETE, but I wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be a useful\n&gt;                 simplication is many cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;                 Just thinking out loud...\n&gt;\n&gt;                 --Chuck\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;             rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             Your use of Yahoo!
