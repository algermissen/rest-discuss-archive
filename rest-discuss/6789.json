But I\n&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t advocate it because that&#39;s a low level tool with a specific\n&gt;&gt; purpose.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I agree with you. Nevertheless here is work Bryan Thompson did\n&gt; on XPointer and range headers -- I&#39;ve been meaning to drill down on\n&gt; this when the time came; it hasn&#39;t come yet, but it always is just\n&gt; around the corner:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://wiki.cognitiveweb.org/HttpRangeAndXPointer\n\nIt is interesting (even without a pirate reference) but my point\nstill stands. REST allows you to create the operations that work on an\nobject and it does it through the verbs acting on resources. You can\nturn anything into as few or as many resources as you want by\ndrawing the resource space differently.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
