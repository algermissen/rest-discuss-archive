Given the proliferation of standards across\nvarious areas, not to mention within those areas as well, I wonder what the\nmost prudent approach to take is? The issues (for me at least) are:\n\n1. Multiple standards for the same domain  - how do you choose ? Should you\ntry and choose something that answers 2 (below) first and let that determine\nthe answer here ?\n2. No standards for the domain - what is the best way to define your own ?\nDo you choose a component--oriented base standard such as xCBL or OAGIS and\nbuild your implementation on top of that or reinvent the wheel completely\nand implement everything from scratch.? If it is the first option then what\nis the best component-oriented standard?\n3. Where does the Semantic Web/RDF/DAML/etc fit in? AFAICT none of the\nexisting standards are implemented using this approach.\n\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
