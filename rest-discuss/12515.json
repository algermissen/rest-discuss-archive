This can be done in the metadata (HTTP\nHeaders) or the URI, but not the body.\nVersioning via URI runs the risk of breaking existing clients that need to\nstay with an older version. Versioning via URI also greatly complicates\nhypermedia sent with each resource representation.  In effect, a change in\nversion threatens to create an entire URI namespace, even if only a few URI\nneed to change; even if only a few resource representations need to change.\n\nVersioning via metadata is much less disruptive since it allows clients that\nare not concerned w/ versioning changes (i.e. simple GET clients negotiating\nfor HTML representations) can continue to use the URIs they may have stored\nin the past (think about a link list posted to a blog or forum).\n\nVersioning via media-type has the benefit of using existing well-known tech\nalready in place for clients and servers (no custom header needed) and\nallows clients to negotiate for the exact version they need *per URI* if\nthat is appropriate for that client. It also allows the server to clearly\nindicate supported versions for each URI (via the OPTIONS method). It also\nmakes it easier to roll out minor modifications or customizations in the\nworkflow as only a few resource representations may need new hypermedia\nlinks (I&#39;ve had many cases where only a singles resource needed new\nhypermedia links).\n\nFinally, versioning via media-type eases demands on caching intermediaries\nsince it does not balloon the number if URIs that might be cacheable. It\nalso reduces frustration within organizations that make use of reverse DNS\nand other security proxies that use URI space as a way to limit access to\nexternal clients (Just this week I wrestled with a major int&#39;l company that\n*refused* to allow a new URI for a version update since it would take\nadditional time and money to properly provision the proxies).\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 15, 2009 at 09:48, Peter Williams &lt;pezra@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter Williams wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Solomon Duskis &lt;sduskis@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Why should a client or server care about explicit versioning?
