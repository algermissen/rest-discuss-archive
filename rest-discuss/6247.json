The server occasionally gets duplicate\n&gt; requests from clients, which, since these requests are not idempotent,\n&gt; causes problems. I hypothesize that the double-requests are occuring\n&gt; when the server gets busy, and doesn&#39;t respond to a request within a\n&gt; certain time frame, so the client (sometimes IE, sometimes our own\n&gt; software) decides to resend the request. The two get queued up and\n&gt; handled one right after each other by the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to change the state-effecting operations to use POST, but to\n&gt; justify the change in the software, I&#39;m seeking evidence that using POST\n&gt; might resolve this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are web browsers prone to automatically resending GET requests, if they\n&gt; don&#39;t hear back from the server within, say 5 seconds?  Or 30 seconds? \n&gt; Will the same thing happen with a POST?  Thanks.\n\nI haven&#39;t see a browser resubmit by itself, but people clicking on the \nform twice is common enough. Re your justification, I&#39;d be more worried \nabout the GET not reaching the origin server at all*, rather than it \ngetting there twice.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n* I&#39;ve seen people get bit by this, where services don&#39;t get started. or \ndon&#39;t get stopped, so end getting started twice. That sort of nonsense.\n\n"}}
