In other words, a client may send a\nrepresentation to the server and the server, in turn, engages in a number of\nresource interactions (usually creating resources along the way) in order to\ncomplete the work. If one of the interactions cannot be completed it may\nmean previous interactions need to be &#39;rolled back&#39; or canceled.\n\nThe classic case I use is modeling order placement and fulfillment. For\nexample a client may assemble a representation of an online order and send\nit to a server. That server may then need to create an &quot;order&quot; resource, a\n&quot;stock&quot; resource to debit stock &quot;shipping&quot; resource to schedule shipping,\nand a &quot;payment&quot; resource to cover the costs of the work. These steps might\nhappen in parallel and might even involve other servers.\n\nI prefer using the Saga model since it is an &quot;optimistic&quot; pattern and I find\nthat easier to model over HTTP.  On the more pragmatic side, I can model the\ninitial interaction set w/o employing the details of the saga (implementing\neither &#39;forward compensation&#39; or &#39;backward compensation&#39; steps). I can then\nadd the compensation  work later in the implementation process (sometimes\nweeks or months!) without much disruption to clients or proxies, etc.\n\nmca.\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\r\n--001636c5b84d7dd2f2046bc2f022\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nI use Sagas to model long-running operations that &quot;enlist&quot; multip=\r\nle\ncompletions in a single unit.
