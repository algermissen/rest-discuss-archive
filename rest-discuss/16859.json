They clearly show why =\r\nit is important to have one operation that is resource state independent.\nT=\r\nhat does not eliminate the need of having another operation that is actuall=\r\ny state dependent, like POST.\n\nJulian points out that PUT is a REPLACE and =\r\nthat is important to understand. Actually, a replace is one form of update =\r\nthat is too aggressive.  The discussion about partial updates comes from th=\r\ne actual need of partial updates, and PUT is not suitable by definition, no=\r\n matter how much we play with representations and assumptions from the serv=\r\ner understanding partial data.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Nov 10, 2010 a=\r\nt 9:08 AM, Julian Reschke &lt;julian.reschke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On 09.11.2010 16:=\r\n40, wahbedahbe wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah, this debate again... it&#39;s a bit like debatin=\r\ng the right way to eat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; soup with a fork.

This is=\r\n my take on what AtomPub does. It is necessary for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; things like identif=\r\niers and URIs (in general hypermedia controls) that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the server needs c=\r\nontrol over.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right. The important part is that the state o=\r\nf the resource after the\n&gt; &gt; PUT does only depend on the payload, not the p=\r\nrevious state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is that important?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
