I think you can just rely on PUT for idempotency and the rest\njust depend=\r\ns on who you want to generate the id.\n\nIf the clients can generate unique i=\r\nds, then why don&#39;t they just\nrepeatedly PUT to http://example.com/&lt;myunique=\r\nid&gt; ?\n\nIf you&#39;d rather the server &quot;allocates&quot; ids then\n&gt;&gt; POST /factory\n&lt;&lt; =\r\n201 Created\n&lt;&lt; Location: /factory/&lt;auniqueid&gt;\nThen then client repeatedly P=\r\nUTs to\nhttp://example.com/factory/&lt;auniqueid&gt;\n\nThere seems to be some worry=\r\n about &quot;reclaiming&quot; an unused id after a\nperiod of time, but is that really=\r\n a concern? You don&#39;t really\n&quot;allocate&quot; or &quot;do&quot; anything on the POST. You j=\r\nust make sure you never\nsend back the same id twice which isn&#39;t that hard. =\r\nYou don&#39;t even need\nto keep track of what you&#39;ve sent. If you&#39;re worried ab=\r\nout the client\nmaking an id up, you could either a) not care -- this is ess=\r\nentially\nback to the client-generated-id case, or b) sign your ids so you c=\r\nan\ndetect a fraud.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\n\n\n"}}
