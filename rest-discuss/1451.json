Working with ebXML\n&gt; was just one learning experience.  Working with REST is another.\n\nI think that it is very important to have people working from the top\ndown, starting with business requirements. Really there should be more\npeople working on that end rather than on the plumbing but it is easier\nto get your head around plumbing.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Oh, but I *do* mean a unit of work, in the sense of two trading\n&gt; partners coming to agreement on advancing a business deal to the next\n&gt; state.  Each business transaction succeeds or fails as a whole.\n\nOkay, but people often mean transactions in this sense: &quot;I want to be\nable to take an arbitrary number of state-changing operations and ensure\nthat the succeed or fail as a single operation.&quot; \n\nFor example:\n\nPUT X\nPUT Y\nPOST Z\nPUT A\nPOST B\n\n&quot;But only do ANY of these things if you can guarantee ALL will succeed.&quot;\n\nThis is tricky in distributed systems because it requires that the\nserver trust that the client will not lock up too many resources and\nthen disappear.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; For an Order, the transaction is Offer-Acceptance.  At the end of the\n&gt; transaction, the order will be either accepted or not (it was either\n&gt; rejected or the transaction failed for technical reasons).  To be\n&gt; accepted, both trading partners must agree explicitly and auditably.\n\nAgree.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Couldn&#39;t you just send the offer-response-holder URI with the offer?\n\nGood idea!\n\n&gt; So do you think this has promise as a REST transaction protocol?\n\nI see it as a REST offer-acceptance protocol. But in what sense is it\n&quot;transactions in general&quot; and what exact definition of &quot;transactions&quot;\nare you using? Is there a way we could avoid that word so as not to\nconfuse people?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
