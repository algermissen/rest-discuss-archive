Don&#39;t\nget into the &quot;What is below&quot;, every server has a possibly infinite\nnumber of URLs .. the URL/Resource can be anything I want. If someone\nother than the server/agent involved in content negotiation is allowed\nto decide the content-type, he is trying to access a different\nresource, he wants a particular content-type that is different from\nthe normal resource. The normal resource returns a representation\nbased on content negotiation.\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.\n\n\nCheers\nDevdatta\n\n\n2008/11/17  &lt;mike@...&gt;:\n&gt; &quot;But if the server wants to link to a particular content-type only,\n&gt; then isn&#39;t that a different resource? Cos tomorrow, the other server\n&gt; could stop serving that particular content-type from that resource? In\n&gt; that case, the URL should contain the Content-type, imho.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; How would that situation be improved by putting conneg in the URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be worsened; since using conneg with Accept headers leaves no\n&gt; requirement on the server to respect the content type requested, and this\n&gt; gives the server the option to return a 415 or respond with an alternative\n&gt; type than requested.\n&gt;\n&gt; If conneg is in the URL (e.g. ?type=application/xml) it only makes sense to\n&gt; return a 404 - so it&#39;s alot more restrictive in that sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Having multiple URIs for multiple representations of the same resource\n&gt; implies that they are separate resources. I can&#39;t see how that approach is\n&gt; acceptable as a RESTful design.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
