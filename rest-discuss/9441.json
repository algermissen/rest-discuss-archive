So this discussion is revealing a lot of confusion between syntax  \nand=\r\n semantics!\n\nPlease take a good look at the graph here, to get a simple pic=\r\nture of  \nsyntax and semantics:\n\nhttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/resource/RDF-=\r\nsyntax-semantics.png\n\nHow you can combine string tokens together to form se=\r\nntences, or  \ndocuments is syntax. (that&#39;s the upper row of the graph) How =\r\nthose  \ntokens relate to something else (the lower row of the graph), which=\r\n  \none can think of as things in the world if it helps, is semantics.  \n(th=\r\nose are the downward arrows, illustrating the reference  \nrelationship) Wit=\r\nhout semantics you can not speak of the truth of a  \nsentence. Without sema=\r\nntics you can not make sense of the idea of  \nrefactoring your data [1], be=\r\ncause refactoring is preserving the  \nmeaning of what is said, whilst chang=\r\ning the way it is said.\n\nBoth xml and json are probably equally complex if =\r\nyou look at them  \nsyntactically. json also can have a huge amount of white=\r\n space  \neverywhere, between brackets, lines etc... just like xml. It is ju=\r\nst  \nthat json comes with a predefined semantics, which is why it seems  \ns=\r\nimpler, because you immediately know how to interpret it.  Where the  \njson=\r\n syntax is simpler, is probably where it is less flexible than  \nxml...\n\nXM=\r\nL comes with no default semantics. Except of course that everyone  \nimagine=\r\ns they see one, because it is so difficult for humans not to  \ninterpret te=\r\nxt they see. You can think of the structure of the xml  \ndocument, but that=\r\n is not really the semantics of it. That&#39;s just an  \nobjectification of the=\r\n syntax.  DOM (and I think the infoset) are  \njust objectifications of the =\r\nsyntax. They allow one to walk the  \nobjectified syntax of the document.\n\nN=\r\now as I mentioned earlier, the most powerful semantics that has been  \nbuil=\r\nt on xml for data exchange is RDF. It has the advantage over json  \nthat it=\r\n has URI namespaces, and complements the syntax of xml. It has  \nfull model=\r\n theoretical backing on top of it, has been built with the  \nopen world ass=\r\numption in mind, which is what we have to deal with,  \nwhen working on the =\r\nweb, and is not so difficult to learn if you use  \nnotations such as N3. Cu=\r\nrrently the difficulty with these tools are  \nthose related to tools that o=\r\nn the leading/bleeding edge, not  \nproblems of their essential nature.\n\nI t=\r\nhink Tim Berners Lee&#39;s team have developed some JavaScript  \nlibraries to p=\r\narse rdf/xml by the way [2]. So this should help  \nsimplify things somewhat=\r\n. I am sure with a little effort one could  \nmake things even better.\n\nHenr=\r\ny\n\n[1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/refactoring_xml\n[2] http://dig.cs=\r\nail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/Developer.html\n\n\nOn 12 Jul 2007, at 12:42, A.
