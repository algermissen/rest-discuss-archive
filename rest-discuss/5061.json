The developer involved is a VB and \n.Net scripter who just wants to get things done. However, I&#39;m not \nconfident that they understand what the SOAP stack is doing or what the \nimpact will be on the developers who will be using the services.\n\nI&#39;d much prefer to use a HTTP GET and a simplified XML response message, \nand using that as a starting point to move to a REST approach, but \nsimplicity seems to be taking second place to using the latest \nbuzzwords. If anyone has any suggestions on how to contrast the two \napproaches I&#39;d really appreciate the help. Thanks.\n\n-- \nRegards\nAndrew Hallam\n\nDigital Earth Pty Ltd\nwww.digitalearth.com.au\n\n\n\n"}}
