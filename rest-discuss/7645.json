Across these representations I\nwould expect essentially the same information to be returned.\n\nHere, I think you are talking about one representation that returns\nresource content and another representation that returns a form to edit\nthat content. Both representations would presumably be HTML, so they\ndon&#39;t sound like representations of the same resource. They convey\ndifferent information using the same content type. It sounds like they\nwould require different urls. The two resources are related. It is\nlikely the share state on the server. However, hyperlinking to one is a\nvery different matter than hyperlinking to the other.\n\nYou indicate as such here:\n&gt; - GET /wiki/foo\n&gt; - [click edit]\n&gt; - GET /wiki/foo?mode=edit\n&gt;   (or /wiki/foo/editable, or /wiki/foo;edit, or...)\n&gt; - [make changes]\n&gt; - POST /wiki/foo\n\nAn alternative design would be to include the edit form as part of the\nmain representation, perhaps with its visible attribute set to false\nwhen javascript is available. A javascript toggle on the page might make\nthe edit form visible and allow submission back to the server. This\nsingle response document design would only need one url.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
