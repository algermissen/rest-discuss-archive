A\n&gt; user can only make claims.\n\nPaul seemed to be noodling on an interesting observation about the\ndifference in the scope of properties and methods between web semantic\nlanguages and programming languages.  Properties and methods in\nweb semantic languages are global; in programming languages (00 languages\nanyway) they are typically scoped by the owning resource.\n\nMy main point was that this difference really highlights the major\ndifference between a web seen as a collection of markup that can be\nmapped to objects (by the receiver), and a web seen as a collection\nof objects that have been mapped to markup (by the sender).\n[Here I&#39;m speaking of xml-based services.]\n\nIf, when dereferencing a URI, a service chose to provide a deep level of\ndetail\nabout the resource, that included subordinate resource (property) details,\nit would\nbe entirely up to me to ignore whatever implied object mapping the sender\nhad in mind and build up a view of those details that suited me, by say\nusing\nan XPointer fragment in the reference.\n\nI could then send that XPointer reference to somebody else in an email. That\nperson could dereference the URI that I constructed.  The resource returned\nby\nthat URI may bear little resemblance to what the service provider originally\nhad in mind.\n\nGranted, I&#39;d be constrained to work with whatever data is provided by a GET\nand could only POST/PUT/DELETE in a manner that the service dictates, but\nit&#39;s up to me to interpret that data to suit my needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
