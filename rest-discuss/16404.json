So if this is too generic I will re=\r\nad up more and come back.\nIt is a big, open question, but I&#39;ll try to push =\r\nyou in the right direction.\n\n&gt; I am trying to understand how REST and metad=\r\nata initiatives are related to each other. Why do you need Dublin Core/XMP =\r\netc. ? Are these microformats ?\n\nOn the surface, there is no direct connect=\r\nion except the Web architecture. REST is an architectural style for managin=\r\ng information resources.  It has very little standard metadata associated w=\r\nith it other than that it inherits from HTTP.\n\nDublin Core is a framework f=\r\nor describing publication metadata. It was produced by a bunch of librarian=\r\ns through the OCLC in Dublin, OH. It originally started around the Warwick =\r\nFramework but was recast as the poster child for RDF along the way. Dublin =\r\nCore is mostly used to describe authorship, subject designation, publicatio=\r\nn dates, etc. It is actually a more complicated framework that supports int=\r\neroperability across metadata profiles, but for your purposes here, it is a=\r\nn RDF vocabulary for describing resources with standard metadata terms (dc:=\r\ntitle, dc:subject, dc:creator, etc.)\n\nIt would be used either directly as R=\r\nDF:\n\nhttp://bosatsu.net/index.html http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator http://=\r\npurl.org/net/bsletten  \n\nThis is a simple fact or &quot;triple&quot;  connecting a do=\r\ncument to an author, indicated by a 303 non-network-addressable resource th=\r\nrough the Dublin Core creator relationship). RDF statements follow a subjec=\r\nt - predicate - value relationship but can have many different serializatio=\r\nns. In this case, both the subject and the relationship are global and reso=\r\nlvable:\n\nhttp://purl.org/dc/terms/creator\n\nThis can resolve both human-read=\r\nable and machine-processable versions of the relationship. The data model a=\r\nllows you to use relationships from other vocabularies so it makes it very =\r\neasy to accumulate data from the Web. People are now starting to weave RDF =\r\ninto XHTML, HTML, SVG, ODF, etc., generating it on the fly, exposing it nat=\r\nively as part of the Linked Data Project (http://linkedata.org).\n\nThere are=\r\n technologies that build on RDF such as SKOS and OWL to allow you to organi=\r\nze the terms and resources in new and interesting ways. You can then start =\r\nto do certain types of inference over the data organized this way. One of t=\r\nhe exciting parts is that you can organize other people&#39;s data the way you =\r\nwant to see it relatively easily.\n\nRDF and microformats serve similar goals=\r\n (to describe documents and resources) but they have much different scopes.=\r\n RDF has a data model associated with it and is largely intended to support=\r\n global references and relationships. Microformats are intended to be simpl=\r\ne, developer-friendly ways of encoding certain domains (events, people, rev=\r\niews, organizations, etc.)\n\nThe good news is that it is easy to convert Mic=\r\nroformats into a form that can be used with RDF so it is all good metadata.=\r\n\n\nXMP is based on an older version of RDF and was intended as a way of allo=\r\nwing Adobe&#39;s various partners to contribute tools in a document-processing =\r\nframework and allowing them all to annotate a document, image, etc. with me=\r\ntadata (camera information, filters applied, etc.) It isn&#39;t super-wildly us=\r\ned but I think the adoption of RDFa by ODF is going to help spur interest h=\r\nere again.\n\nThe excellent &quot;RESTful Web Services Cookbook&quot; and &quot;REST in Prac=\r\ntice&quot; books touch upon the relationship between REST and Semantic Web techn=\r\nologies like RDF, but I am taking a much deeper dive in a book I am writing=\r\n for Addison-Wesley called &quot;Resource-Oriented Architectures : Building Webs=\r\n of Data&quot;.\n"}}
