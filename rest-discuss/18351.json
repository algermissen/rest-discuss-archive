I often say\nREST/HTTP because we mostly blur the lines between the two in most of these\ndiscussions, but yes, HTTP is an implementation of a RESTful protocol.\n\n&gt; What I do challenge is the missing semantic level, which makes\n&gt; impossible to find out what all these resources are about.\n\nImpossible?\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand what&#39;s wrong of admitting HTTP is _the_ transport level for\n&gt; myriad of specific applications, defining their own semantics in the\n&gt; HTTP message body payload.\n\nIs anyone denying this? *puzzled*\n\n&gt;  Or do we perceive OSI architecture fixed\n&gt; in stone once and forever?  Sure it is in the textbooks, but not\n&gt; always as positive example. It is often cited that early in the\n&gt; Internet history, there were no precise idea what the applications\n&gt; will appear, so why we insist there could be no layer above OSI 7?\n\nNo one is denying that there is a layer above.

Currently, it&#39;s a mess, but with some good clues and a\ngrowing best-practice, and early manifestations of specs.\n\nWhat puzzles me is the insistence that this semantic layer belongs in REST.\n\n&gt; Comparison with WWW is not fair.  There is a single shared semantic\n&gt; for human readable web pages, and our brains (so far) are way better\n&gt; resolving the semantics, compared to software code.\n\nAs much as I&#39;d like to agree with you, I don&#39;t. There&#39;s plenty of known and\nheavvily used content types that are not meant for human digestion, such as\nimages, CSS and JS files, JSON, and XML and further up into abstraction.\nOnly the *browser* is human readable; the markup, images and code is not\n(unless you&#39;re a geek).\n\n&gt; I do remember times when web sites were\n&gt; participating in &quot;rings&quot;, where each site was happy to include links\n&gt; to the next one in the ring, thus allowing a new sites to become\n&gt; visible.\n\nIt was also a very early example of social engineering.\n\n&gt; Another way to learn about a web site was for somebody to\n&gt; share the link by email, or even offline.  The HATEOAS &quot;follow your\n&gt; nose&quot; approach reminds me exactly this - no global knowledge, just\n&gt; follow the next step.\n\nThere&#39;s a difference between a trail laid down in bread-crumbs, and one\nthat is carved in stone. &quot;Follow-your-nose&quot; is not the same as abandon\ncommon knowledge. Ever written a FOAF crawler? The principle is to follow\nyour nose, but using an established ontology. Whether you&#39;re traversing\nnodes or resources (some times orthagonal to each other) doesn&#39;t matter to\nthe HATEOAS concept.\n\n&gt; The power of Internet rose when the web of links\n&gt; started to be analysed as a whole, not just looking at the next peek.\n\nNot sure if I can agree with this, either. Even the web crawlers are\nlooking for the next peek, so I don&#39;t see a sharp edge between the past and\npresent here.\n\n&gt; However, web services (not only REST) are in the pre-search era, quite\n&gt; possible due to common semantics lacking.  May be because of something\n&gt; else as well. IMHO only of course.\n\nBig vendors and lock-in, I think. RESTful thinking has been around for a\nlong time, even in the pre-search era, but just like with good wine ...\n\n&gt; Scenarios - well, couple of, but details are not necessary in the\n&gt; scope of this thread. Basically, having number of REST services under\n&gt; common API running in several places in the world, how do you find if\n&gt; there is a specific piece of information that could be retrieved from\n&gt; any of them, or specific processing capability available?  Sure there\n&gt; are custom solutions, but from this discussion I gather a generic one\n&gt; is hardly of interest.\n\nWell, again, it depends on what you&#39;re after.
