It doesn&#39;t actually &quot;do&quot; anything.  The comments are\nright -- =\r\nif it were an application, then there would be one resource\nand the hyperte=\r\nxt would tell you how to change its state (not just\nthe browser&#39;s view).\n\nA=\r\nn application is something a user wants to do with computers.\n&quot;Writing a me=\r\nmo&quot; is an application.  Microsoft Word is a software\nsystem for writing mem=\r\nos (among other things).  Google Docs is a\nnetwork-based software system fo=\r\nr writing memos (among other things).\n\n&quot;Buying stuff&quot; is another applicatio=\r\nn.  Amazon is a network-based\nsoftware system for buying stuff.  You get th=\r\ne idea ... a\nnetwork-based application is something a user wants to do\nwith=\r\n computers that needs (for whatever reason) to be network-based.\nIt can be =\r\nas simple as reading a book, or as complex as ordering\nparts for a Boeing 7=\r\n67.  And let&#39;s not forget that there are\nmany network-based applications fo=\r\nr which REST is not likely\nto be a good design (an alarm monitoring system =\r\nwould be one\nexample -- it may have RESTful components, such as a status vi=\r\new,\nbut it would be silly to restrict the sensors to a pull-based\ninteracti=\r\non just out of architectural purity).\n\nApplication state in REST is what mo=\r\nst distributed systems would\ncall session state or transaction state, depen=\r\nding on which end\nof the system is being talked about.  However, we can&#39;t c=\r\nall it\nsession state because then networking folks assume the communication=\r\n\nis session-scoped, and we can&#39;t call it transaction state because\nthen dat=\r\nabase folks assume we are talking about back-end ACID.\nLet&#39;s face it, there=\r\n are very few ways to describe anything in\ncomputer science that hasn&#39;t alr=\r\neady been used in a slightly\ndifferent fashion.  Application state is a goo=\r\nd term to describe\nwhat really matters to the user.\n\nDanny&#39;s pages are not =\r\nan application.  That is, unless your\napplication happens to *be* making RD=\r\nF assertions.  For that\npurpose, having two different resources with singul=\r\nar states\nmight be a useful thing.\n\n....Roy\n"}}
