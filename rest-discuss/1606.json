P-)\n\n&gt; 1. This thread focused on offer-acceptance.  But almost every \n&gt; business protocol I can think of has a similar kind of interaction, \n&gt; where both trading partners must explicitly agree on the next state \n&gt; of the business deal.  The interaction pattern could be exactly the \n&gt; same.  See also #2:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Offer-acceptance is only the beginning of a longer conversation.  \n&gt; For example, an offer to buy, when accepted, is intended to be \n&gt; fulfilled and paid for. \n&gt; So at least two other transactions will be forthcoming:  \n&gt; * Deliver the committed goods or services, which I will call &quot;Notify-\n&gt; Comfirm&quot;.  Notify is where the seller notifies the buyer that the \n&gt; goods or services have been delivered, to the seller&#39;s best \n&gt; understanding.  Confirm is where the buyer either agrees or disagrees.\n&gt; Notify-Confirm is actually the same as offer-acceptance.\n&gt; Notify is equivalent to Offer, Confirm equivalent to Accept.\n&gt; * Pay - also a Notify-Confirm transaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The longer conversation (an economic exchange) has its own \n&gt; patterns.  It can be orchestrated or choreographed based on the \n&gt; states of the resources representing the economic commmitments and \n&gt; fulfillment events of the business deal.  In other words, when all \n&gt; the commitments have been fulfilled, the order is complete.\n&gt; (That&#39;s what a lot of business people mean by &quot;a transaction&quot;.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The whole economic exchange between two trading partners may be \n&gt; hyperlinked into a network of economic exchanges - a value system or \n&gt; supply chain.  For example, if I order a computer from Dell, my \n&gt; economic exchange with Dell may be hyperlinked to a slot on Dell&#39;s \n&gt; assembly schedule, which in turn may be hyperlinked to economic \n&gt; exchanges with Dell&#39;s suppliers for components, etc., turtles all the \n&gt; way down.\n\nI think the type of composition I have in mind could be used for all\nof these, though I&#39;d focus on building more generic patterns as I\ndescribed above, with the hopes that it would cover off what you&#39;ve\nwritten there.\n\nWhen I think of this stuff, I inevitably think back to Bill Mcarthy&#39;s\npresentation at OOPSLA &#39;97 Business Object workshop, about REA and\nthe various interaction patterns seen in business;\n\nhttp://jeffsutherland.com/oopsla97/oo97final.html\n\nUnfortunately the content of that presentation isn&#39;t available, but I\nremember the gist quite clearly.\n\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand this yet.  How can a response document \n&gt; say &quot;Accept&quot;\n&gt; &gt; but have an error?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Lots of ways, for example:\n&gt; 1. Could be too late.  Offers are not good forever.  The buyer needs \n&gt; to be able to move on to a different seller.\n&gt; 2. The seller could have tried to change the offer in the response \n&gt; document or in some other way violate the rules of the deal.\n&gt; 3. There could have been authorization or certificate or signature \n&gt; problems.\n\nAh, I see.  So what I described would apply then; that the expectation\nthat a fault might happen should be part of the contract, and that\nthe sides should synch up in some manner, before proceeding past a\npoint of no return if it turns out that this error condition did\noccur.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
