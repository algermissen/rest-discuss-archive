Joining them was Jeff Barr, \nWeb services evangelist from online bookseller Amazon.com. \n\nMoad kicked off the discussion by asking the panelists to\nidentify the gaps that remain unfilled in this interim period\nbefore Web services becomes a new way of computing. Simon Phipps,\nchief software evangelist from Sun Microsystems, noted that \nit&#39;s easy to get the impression that all the technical problems\nhave been solved, but that, in fact, many remain. The current\ntechnology, as specified by the W3C and other standards \norganizations, is fine for small projects, he went on, but\nbusiness-strength solutions are lacking, creating a need for\nproprietary products.\n\nDavid Orchard, BEA&#39;s technical director, said that Web services \nlack tested interoperability, and that standards committees need \nto do much more to get important interoperability capabilities,\nsuch as security and transactionality, working satisfactorily.\n\nBarr sees a glass that is half full, and noted that the vendor\nrepresentatives&#39; focus on a complete, industrial-strength \nsolution--while ultimately necessary and well-intentioned--doesn&#39;t\nnegate the ability to build many solutions today, with existing \ntechnologies.\n\nDevelopers have their hands full learning those current techno-\nlogies, Barr explained. Simply because a new standard is released\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean that developers feel a need to adopt it\nimmediately. He&#39;s also concerned that the industry could be \n&quot;over-complicating&quot; Web services with far too many complex and\ninterrelated specifications.\n\nMansour Safai, CEO of M7, commented that Web services doesn&#39;t \nmake old, tough problems disappear. All of the existing challenges,\nsuch as application integration and workflow, remain, regardless\nof the technology used to implement a solution. Safai noted that,\nat the end of the day, Web services are simply an API with \ndifferent underpinnings than other distributed computing solutions.\n\n\n**************************advertisement***********************\n==================================================================\nMicrosoft Tech Ed 2003 \nJune 1-6, Dallas, TX\n==================================================================\nRealize your potential at Tech Ed 2003, Microsoft&#39;s \npremier technical conference.

All  that is needed now, he said, is to standardize\nthe pieces of the map.\n\nSun&#39;s Phipps commented that he felt that developers would respond\nbest to powerful and simple standards, though he acknowledged the\nrisk of large companies hijacking the standards process.\n\nSafai emphasized that because enterprises have systems from different\nvendors, interoperability is a key requirement. He cautioned that\nsimply because a standard describes a way for applications to talk\nto each other, interoperability does not necessarily result.\n\nMoad then directed the panelists to consider Phipp&#39;s contention\nthat Web services open standards are in danger of being hijacked\nby proprietary solutions. BEA&#39;s Orchard suggested that, by their\nnature, XML, SOAP and WSDL are extensible, and that keeping out\nproprietary extensions will prove to be difficult. Phipps added\nthat there&#39;s nothing wrong with companies adding value through\nproprietary extensions, as long as the companies clearly label \nthem as such.\n\nTurning to language implementations, Moad asked if Web services\nwill remain language-independent. Sun&#39;s Phipps said that everyone\nexcept Microsoft is committed to Java. Although Sun, IBM and BEA\nall use Java at the &quot;end-points&quot; of the Web services pipe, and\nalthough there is twice as much Java code as there is XML code,\nthere is no required connection between the two.\n\nAddressing the $64,000 question, Moad asked the panelists if they\nconsidered Web services a success. Barr said that Amazon is currently\nprocessing millions of calls per day using Web services, and that a\nsignificant amount of business is transacted through the returned \ndata. He feels that what Amazon, and others, have accomplished to date\nis &quot;just the very small tip of a very big iceberg.&quot;\n\nThat said, Barr continued, the industry needs to spend more time \nbuilding applications using standards that have had a year or so to\nmature and migrate to various toolkits. Working in this &quot;comfort \nzone&quot; produces the most successful application implementations.\n\nClearly--for Amazon, at least--Web services constitute an important\nelement of their distributed computing strategy, and in a future\nnewsletter, we&#39;ll revisit what Amazon and others are doing in the \nreal world. \n\n\n**************************advertisement***********************\n==============================================================\nTELL US WHAT YOU THINK and WIN $100 Gift Certificate\n==============================================================\nSD magazine needs your feedback on upcoming magazine coverage.\nPlease take our short (7 questions) online poll and enter your \nname to win one of three $100 gift certificates to Amazon.com.  \nClick here for the survey:\n\nhttp://click.sd.email-publisher.com/maaa0qJaaXr5la4E4Veb/\n==============================================================\n**************************************************************\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hot Links\n\nLinking to specific sections of an XML document will become easier,\nthanks to a new XMPL Pointer Language (XPointer) Recommendation \nfrom W3C.
