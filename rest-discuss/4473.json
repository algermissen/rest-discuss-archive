The service they submit\ndata to is the storage service.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this violates the principles of REST and it simplifies\n&gt; things quite a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; The practicalities would be that your client could construct a\n&gt; multipart body containing all the input document and POST it to your\n&gt; service URI. The service could then process the request and return a\n&gt; non-cacheable response with the merged document as the body.\nIf the service were purely an algorithm, yes I could do this. But I&#39;m going\nfor persistence.\n\n"}}
