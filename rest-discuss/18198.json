A case file can be represented in HTML in various \n(realistic) ways:\n\n1) Using micro formats\n\n2) Using RDFa\n\nFurthermore, we can either choose to name the case file properties using a \nNordic standard, which really doesn&#39;t fit our data model very well, or we \ncan name the properties using some other (non-)standard that fits the data \nmodel a lot better.\n\nAll in all we have a minimum of four different ways of expressing the \ncontent of a case file using HTML. And thats not counting the gazillion \ndifferent ways to express stuff in micro formats.\n\nNow I want the client to be able to say &quot;I understand HTML and please serve \nit as a micro format using Nordic standard names&quot;.\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: mike amundsen\nTo: Erik Mogensen\nCc: Jorn Wildt ; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, December 28, 2011 7:19 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Different vocabularies, same media type\n\n\nJorn:\n\n\ni must assume (since it&#39;s not clear in your messages) that this &quot;single \nmedia type, multiple vocabularies&quot; problem means:\n- you decided to use only one media type\n- you decided to map your problem domain details to this media type multiple \nways (via these &quot;vocabularies&quot;)\n- you actually _need_ to do it this way.\n\n\nfirst, &quot;vocabularies&quot; is rather vague to me. you name a few (some made up \nfor the case of the discussion), but provide no examples. it is not clear to \nme how you plan to express the same problem domain information for the same \nresource using different &quot;vocabularies.&quot; in fact, i doubt this scenario is \npractical in a live system. IOW, i doubt you can successfully create varying \nrepresentations on the same resource expressing the same problem domain data \nusing different &quot;vocabularies.&quot;\n\n\ninstead, i suspect that, when using these &quot;vocabularies&quot; to express problem \ndomain specifics, you&#39;ll find that the representations vary widely enough \nthat they are not (practically speaking) the same _resource_ at all. i \nencourage you to prove me wrong on this point by providing some clear \nexamples.\n\n\nsecond, it sounds (from you responses here) that you imagine multiple \nclients out there that all understand the same media type, but don&#39;t share \nan understanding of the same vocabularies. you also mention the notion of \n&quot;negotiating&quot; for vocabularies between client and server. again, i can&#39;t \nconjure up real-life examples of this (feel free to point to some).\n\n\ni think you are positing scenarios that while possible, are unlikely and/or \nsub-optimal. i think it likely likely that you will encounter clients that \ndiffer in the way domain specifics are represented. i those cases, i suggest \nthe most effective way to do that is to provide unique addresses. this is \nespecially true (IMO) when the representation includes &quot;actionable&quot; \nhypermedia controls upon which the client is expected to act.\n\n\nin my experience, attempts to do &quot;multiple things&quot; while using the same URI \nare not often successful; esp. when the client is expected to recognize, \nparse, and act on the response representation.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 28, 2011 at 09:12, Erik Mogensen &lt;erik@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 28, 2011 at 8:28 AM, Jorn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n\n1) Assume we have a resource with a sales order.\n[...]\nI guess it boils down to a question of what kind of variations we need.

Typically we \nwould mint a new version of the media type - but that certainly doesn&#39;t make \nsense for a spreadsheet!\n\n\nIf you have different layouts (or even just different styles) of cells in \ntwo spreadsheets, I would not give them the same URI.\n\n\nA URI may identify one and only one resource, but a resource may be \nidentified by any number of URIs. That&#39;s a fact of life; one of the a trade \noffs of combining the network address with the resource identifier.\n\n\nIMHO that would go for the XML vocabularies too: The &quot;EU sales order&quot; and \nthe &quot;US sales order&quot; (or whatever the hypothetical case was) don&#39;t _have_ to \nhave the same URI, even though they come from the same rows in the same \ndatabase tables.  Solving the problem of linking/navigating to the &quot;right&quot; \nresource is a lot easier; hypermedia. Clients can&#39;t depend on all players \nalways using the one true URI of any resource to identify it; witness \ntinyurl.com and derivatives.\n\n\nDifferent layout with the same content... Heard that before:  WML. That \nworked out well? ;-)  How do sites really handle it?  Usually using the same \nmedia types, but using &quot;m.example.com&quot; subdomains, i.e. different URIs for \nthe same &quot;resource&quot;.\n-- \n-mogsie-\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}}
