But the client of course can remember and use as much as it wants during its path through the application.\n\nBetter?\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Complex application flows will \n&gt; require clients to maintain an understanding of their context in order \n&gt; to intelligently traverse from one state to another, IOW &#39;prior \n&gt; interactions will change the set of rules&#39; - is this really different to \n&gt; clients keeping track of prior interactions? I think it&#39;s hard to make a \n&gt; case for that in a determinate, state-machine world.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the human web - we have the benefit of symbolism and the powerful \n&gt; methods of inference that come with that; GUI stuff like icons, images, \n&gt; breadcrumbs, and other stuff like natural language, etc. The machine web \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have any of this because machines don&#39;t have common sense. This \n&gt; is where, for me, the parallel between the human web and the machine web \n&gt; begins to break down a bit and the comparison stops making sense - and \n&gt; so it&#39;s also where the meaning and value of a &#39;steady state&#39; becomes a \n&gt; bit confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
