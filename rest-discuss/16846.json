I&#39;d like to see more examples of media\n&gt; &gt; types that describe how PUT/DELETE should be used as well. I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; buy the &quot;you have the URI, so just invoke PUT or DELETE on it&quot;\n&gt; &gt; generic approach -- you end up with problems like the one you are\n&gt; &gt; tackling here. At the end of the day though, unless you think the\n&gt; &gt; idempotent property of PUT and DELETE is going to realize practical\n&gt; &gt; benefits for your system, you might just be better off using POST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a valid point. The key take away is that perhaps the &quot;Uniform\n&gt; Interface&quot; is not quite as uniform as we may like. Or, perhaps the\n&gt; interface itself is uniform, the semantics surrounding the use of the\n&gt; interface is not.\n&gt; \n\nYup, I&#39;ve said this myself on many occasions.  Some folks believe that\n&lt;link rel=&#39;edit&#39;/&gt; is a hypertext control.  Others, myself included,\nbelieve that hypertext controls are forms, not link relations.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
