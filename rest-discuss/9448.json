There are just messages.\n&gt;\n\nA 404 or a 410 message says that the requested URI maps to the empty set:\n\n&quot;A resource can map to the empty set, which allows references to be made \nto a concept before any realization of that concept exists&quot;\n\nThey are &quot;just messages&quot; but those messages contain entity bodies, and I \ndo not see where the spec says an entity body (no restriction is made to \n2xx responses in the spec) can not have an entity tag.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Huh? An ETag is both an entity header field and a response header.\n&gt;\n&gt;Eric, please read the definitions in RFC2616. Not every header appearing\n&gt;in an HTTP response is a &quot;Response Header&quot;, as defined in Section 6.2.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t recall making that claim -- obviously, &quot;Server&quot; and &quot;Date&quot; have \nnothing to do with the response.  Section 6.2 lists ETag as a response \nheader.  So how is it not a response header?  Are you saying that since \nRFC 2616 doesn&#39;t specifically state that ETags may be used on 4xx \nresponses, then doing so goes against spec?  Well, I disagree.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;No, it just means that you are using HTTP machinery in a way not\n&gt;sanctioned by the spec, so basically you&#39;re inventing a new protocol.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m using HTTP machinery in a way nobody has tried before, this is not \nthe same thing as &quot;inventing a new protocol&quot; nor is it &quot;against&quot; RFC \n2616.  If it were a &quot;bad thing&quot; to send an ETag with a 410 response \nthen the spec would say so.  If the spec had to specifically account \nfor all possible request/response combinations allowable, wouldn&#39;t it \nbe literally thousands of pages long?  Just because an ETag on a 410 \nisn&#39;t directly &quot;ruled in&quot; hardly makes it &quot;ruled out&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s just something that is not compliant to RFC2616. You won&#39;t notice\n&gt;any problems as long as you&#39;re just using your own client, no\n&gt;intermediaries, and so on.\n&gt;\n\nThat is exactly my concern, and remains my challenge.  Just exactly what \nclient will have problems with my setup?  Just exactly why would an \nintermediary get all fouled up due to an ETag on a 410 response?  \nGranted, a client needs to understand my API to make the second DELETE, \nbut that hardly restricts usage to a &quot;custom&quot; client -- I can make an \nXForms page which uses XHR to implement this, meaning any HTTP client \nwith an understanding of XForms (and XHTML) and XHR will interoperate \nwith my system cleanly.\n\nAgain I ask, what, specifically, will happen to trip up any intermediary \nand what, exactly, causes my system not to interoperate with a wide \nvariety of clients?  If I have truly violated RFC 2616, then surely you \ncan come up with an actual downside instead of FUD?  Be specific, please, \notherwise the only reason you are giving me is &quot;because I say so&quot; and \nnot anything to do with RFC 2616, really.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
