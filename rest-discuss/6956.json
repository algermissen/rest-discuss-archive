I like the way WordPress uses &quot;slugs&quot; instead (but I hate\n&gt; the name &quot;slug!&quot;)\n \nYou can use slugs just as easily as you can use surrogate integer keys in\nRails. The integer PK is used by default when new models and controllers are\ngenerated because the integer PK is the only unique identifier we can make\nassumptions about. But if your model has a slug attribute, using it instead\nof the PK for generated URLs and routing is usually as easy as overriding\nActiveRecord::Base##to_param:\n\n    class Foo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n      def to_param\n        slug\n      end\n    end\n\nYou may also have to tweak your controller:\n\n    class FoosController &lt; ActionController::Base\n      def show\n        # the following resembles what is generated by default:\n        @foo = Foo.find(params[:id])\n        # change it to this:\n        @foo = Foo.find_by_slug(params[:id])\n      end\n    end\n\nMost everything else should be taken care of. Using the `url_for` and\n`link_to` helper methods should automatically use the slug instead of the\ninteger PK and routing should Just Work as well.\n\nIt&#39;s swell.\n\nI&#39;ve had more trouble trying to create sane slugs for my models than I have\ngetting Rails to use them. In fact, I tend to just use the integer PK in all\nbut the most highly trafficked areas of an applications because slugification\ncan be a bit of a PITA. It can help URIs stay cool, though, so I try to use\nthem when that&#39;s important.\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n\n"}}
