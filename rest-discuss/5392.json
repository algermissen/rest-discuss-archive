REST doesn&#39;t need a &quot;description\n&gt; language&quot; as Web services folks know them, because what&#39;s describable\n&gt; is either already described (e.g. the HTTP and URI specs, data\n&gt; format specs), or described at runtime (e.g. specific URIs, form\n&gt; instances, etc...).\n&gt;\n&gt; Best case, a description of a RESTful service risks providing duplicate\n&gt; and/or stale information.  Worst case it yields violating REST\n&gt; constraints like &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;, which\n&gt; isn&#39;t a good thing for a &quot;RESTful description language&quot; to do, or at\n&gt; least encourage by its very existence.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re really interested in supporting REST, you might want to\n&gt; consider what it would mean to use these &quot;descriptions&quot; at runtime as\n&gt; you would a form.\n\nMark is absolutely right.\n\n\nOne disadvantage to REST is that it can&#39;t be auto-discovered and\nturned into an API for a traditional language in quite the same way as\nthe WSDL/SOAP stack. In that space it&#39;s pretty easy to:\n\n- build a service in language (Java, .NET, whatever) thus building\n  some API\n\n- auto-generate the SOAP/WSDL interfaces\n\n- allow clients to auto-generate their side of the SOAP\n\n\nPersonally, I think the REST way is better than the SOAP stack because\nit&#39;s simpler and leads to less complex, more stable, systems.\n\nBut the WSDL/SOAP way is attractive to a certain class of programmer\nbecause of the simplicity (but actually it&#39;s difficult to make the\nbuild system for these complex services /8-)\n\n\nThere&#39;s no reason why toolkits couldn&#39;t be made for\nauto-client-generation of REST services but we&#39;d need more meta data\nfrom HEADs first I think. For example, you might need to have\ndescriptions for the XML documents that will be sent in response to\noperations.\n\nI am beginning to think that the biggest achievement we could make is\nto resolve the dichotomy of XML description; media type or document?\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
