There is at\nleast one parse=\r\nr available for it, too[2]. Feel free to check it out\nand post your comment=\r\ns/suggestions/doubts on that design; I&#39;d\nappreciate any and all feedback.\n\n=\r\nI also use XHTML quite a bit for data-oriented representations; it&#39;s\nreally=\r\n just an XML format that already has several H-Factors *and*\nrenders well i=\r\nn common browsers (great for &quot;debugging&quot;\nrepresentations!). The design docu=\r\nment is different (documenting @id,\n@name, @rel, & @class along w/ expected=\r\n structures in the\nrepresentation). I posted an example of using XHTML as a=\r\n design source\nfor hypermedia APIs, too[3].\n\n[1] http://amundsen.com/media-=\r\ntypes/collection/format/\n[2] https://github.com/hamnis/json-collection\n[3] =\r\nhttp://amundsen.com/hypermedia/profiles/\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhtt=\r\np://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 19, 2=\r\n011 at 04:40, Paul Cohen &lt;paco@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Oc=\r\nt 18, 2011 at 4:17 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve coll=\r\nected examples of these affordances in my H-Factors page[3]\n&gt;&gt; Finally, onc=\r\ne you decide on the set of hypermedia controls your design will support, yo=\r\nu need to document them as a collection including how they are represented =\r\nin an outbound document and how client applications should recognize, parse=\r\n, and render/activate them when they appear in a response representation. T=\r\nhat is what a &quot;media type definition&quot; is about.\n&gt;&gt; Armed with the media typ=\r\ne definition both client and server have sufficient &quot;out-of-band&quot; shared kn=\r\nowledge to exchange hypermedia messages and use the format to representatio=\r\nn domain-specific information in order to support an &quot;application&quot; experien=\r\nce.\n&gt;&gt; hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; I liked the H-Factors classification. Thanks!\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; So to summarize, the core issue is that we really need media types\n&gt; tha=\r\nt (in their specification) have full syntactical support for all\n&gt; core (HT=\r\nTP-based) hypermedia features (H-Factors). Currently it seems\n&gt; XHTML is cl=\r\nosest to achieving this. The problem with XHTML is that\n&gt; it&#39;s meant to imp=\r\nlement web pages and be consumed by web browsers.\n&gt; It&#39;s not meant for hype=\r\nrmedia data representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems a lot of people are inventing the=\r\nir own conventions for\n&gt; embedding hypermedia information in JSON. Yes, me =\r\ntoo! :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; It sure would be nice with a documented *general* JSON-based m=\r\nedia\n&gt; type that has support for all core hypermedia features (H-Factors). =\r\nI\n&gt; would like a convention that either:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0a) uses leading/trailing (s=\r\ningle or double) underscore characters\n&gt; for a set of JSON object/dictionar=\r\ny keys that handle hypermedia link\n&gt; information. That would facilitate dif=\r\nferentiating between actual JSON\n&gt; application data and hypermedia link inf=\r\normation and it would not\n&gt; interfere with the name space of normal JSON ob=\r\nject/dictionary key\n&gt; names (without underscore characters).\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0b) has =\r\none single reserved key, eg. &quot;__link__&quot; which always will\n&gt; refer to a JSON=\r\n object/dictionary containing hypermedia link\n&gt; information, along the line=\r\ns that Dilip Krishnan proposed earlier in\n&gt; this thread.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another approa=\r\nch would to be invent a completely new hypermedia\n&gt; enabled data format but=\r\n would take a lot of time and energy. Also JSON\n&gt; is very nice since it is =\r\nsimple, clean, ubiquitous and so easily\n&gt; consumed by JavaScript-based web =\r\napplications.\n&gt;\n&gt; /Paul\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Paul Cohen\n&gt; www.seibostudios.se\n&gt; mobile:=\r\n +46 730 787 035\n&gt; e-mail: paul.cohen@...\n&gt;\n\n"}}
