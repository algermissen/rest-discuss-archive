What\nthe spec prohibits is using GET/HEAD for *unsafe* operations.\n\n&quot;In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and\nHEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action\nother than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered &quot;safe&quot;.\nThis allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT\nand DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the\nfact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
