In any system with a notion of\nresource vs. representation, it&#39;s essential that producers be able to\ncommunicate the intended processing model to consumers.  Sometimes I\nserve (X)HTML as text/plain, if my intent is that the entity be\ndisplayed rather than rendered.\n\nAbsent any clear description of producer intent, payloads have zero\nmeaning in any system where the resource/representation dichotomy\nexists (i.e. RESTful systems).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But I think it&#39;s fair to say that self-descriptive representation\n&gt; formats are not unimportant as they yield key benefits (again see\n&gt; 5.1.2 -- but they&#39;re important for data encapsulation and\n&gt; evolvability).\n&gt; \n\nYou lost me there.  REST only requires that messaging be self-\ndescriptive, not the data format itself.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
