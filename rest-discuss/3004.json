Tim Bray gave a very positive Plenary talk on REST and Web \nArchitecture. He didn&#39;t slam RPC-based Web Services (as he did when he \nspoke to our more intimate group in Vancouver) but nevertheless he was \nclearly pro-REST. His only references to other ways of doing things were \noblique: &quot;Some people do not give things URIs. This means that those \nthings are not on the Web. That should be self-evidently a bad thing.&quot;\n\n  2. I spoke with Jeff Barr from Amazon. He says their REST interface is \n  popular (no numbers) and some people have found ways to do things with \nit that are literally not possible with the SOAP interface. You can make \nan HTTP hyperlink to an Amazon XML page parameterized with an XSLT \nstylesheet. Amazon runs the stylesheet on the server side. This means \nthat with nothing more than an HTML document and a stylesheet on \ngeocities (no CGI!), you can generate a pretty sophisticated web storefront.\n\nPeople who think that REST and other ways of doing things are mostly the \nsame because you can make them look the same with glue code totally miss \nthe fact that there environments where there is _nowhere to put the glue \ncode_. The continued rise of XML and XSLT makes REST more and more of a \n&quot;no-brainer&quot; and vice versa.\n\nThat was also a theme of Tim&#39;s talk...that XML was the cure for many of \nthe Web&#39;s weak points (machine to machine communication, \ninternationalization, metadata, ...)\n\nConsidering where we were a year ago, REST&#39;s current status is actually \namazing considering the subtlety of the ideas.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
