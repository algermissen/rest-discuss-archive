How to handle non-trivial mutation\n&gt; operatio=\r\nns. The GET (read) operations are pretty obvious. It would be\n&gt; really grea=\r\nt to have a *publicly available* set of &#39;patterns&#39;\ndescribed\n&gt; for transact=\r\nion models like this. Instead of the endless debate on the\n&gt; blogs and here=\r\n :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Or even just a non-trivial application scenario.
