RFC 4331 [1] is even more specific about 507:\n\n   WebDAV [RFC2518] defines the status code 507 (Insufficient Storage).\n   This status code SHOULD be used when a client request (e.g., a PUT,\n   PROPFIND, MKCOL, MOVE, or COPY) fails because it would exceed their\n   quota or physical storage limits.  In order to differentiate the\n   response from other storage problems, the server SHOULD include an\n   XML error body as defined by DeltaV [RFC3253] with the appropriate\n   precondition tag.\n   ...\n\nHowever, I think 5xx errors are supposed to be for cases where the client \ndid the right thing and the server cannot fulfill the request due to some \nserver-related problem. If the server is functioning well (in this case, \nproperly enforcing the quota) , then it should never issue 5xx responses, \nIMO.\n\n[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4331#6 \n\n\n"}}
