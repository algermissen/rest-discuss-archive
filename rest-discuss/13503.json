Using them when the representation format\ndoesn&#39;t support links is a really good thing! Using them to supplement link\ninformation that is in a hypermedia representation format does make the\nmessage more self-descriptive and could be very useful when\nlayers/intermediaries don&#39;t understand your hypermedia format.

Or\nthat the practice of putting links in headers should be *preferred over*\nputting links in your hypermedia representation. That is bad IMO.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t &quot;go against HTTP&quot; -- I said it goes against &quot;the established\npractice of the Web&quot;. The Web is more than URI and HTTP (I know... shocking\nisn&#39;t it?!!). There&#39;s that hypermedia thing too e.g. HTML. Here&#39;s a\nquestion: on the Web today, is it more common to see links in a) HTTP\nheaders or b) the HTML body. If you said &quot;b&quot;, then you agree with my point!\n\nI also think it goes against the design principles of the Web. It is my\nunderstanding that the Web standards were designed in a way that allows the\ninterchange and separate evolution of hypermedia formats and protocols. HTML\ncan be used with HTTP, FTP and other protocols yet to be invented. HTTP can\nbe used with HTML, SVG, VoiceXML, Atom, etc. URI is the lynch pin as HTML\n(and other hypermedia formats) only depend on URI for references and URIs\nare extensible to many protocols. When you put your links in your HTTP\nheaders rather than the hypermedia body, you prevent the application state\nmachine from being driven by hypermedia alone and make it dependent on HTTP.\n\nThis design principle has been discussed by the editors of the Web&#39;s\nspecifications and is embodied in those specifications. Larry Masinter wrote\nthe following in an article on the orthogonality of specifications (\nhttp://www.w3.org/QA/2009/06/orthogonality_of_specification.html):\nWhile HTTP is the current &quot;common denominator&quot;  protocol that all web agents\nare expected to speak, the web should continue to work if web content is\ndelivered by other protocols -- FTP, shared file systems, email, instant\nmessaging, and so forth.  HTTP as it has evolved has severe difficulties,\nand designing a Web that *only works* with HTTP as it is currently\nimplemented and deployed would unfortunate. We should work harder to reduce\nthe dependencies and isolate them.\n\nRoy Fielding wrote the following in his &quot;REST APIs must by hypertext driven&quot;\npost (http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n):\nA REST API should not be dependent on any single communication protocol,\nthough its successful mapping to a given protocol may be dependent on the\navailability of metadata, choice of methods, etc. In general, any protocol\nelement that uses a URI for identification must allow any URI scheme to be\nused for the sake of that identification. *[Failure here implies that\nidentification is not separated from interaction.]\n*\n*\n***The HTTP RFC is following this principle when it requires that when\ncreating a resource, the 201 Created response should not only have a\nlocation header, but also a body that refers to the new resource:\nIf a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be\n201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the\nrequest and refers to the new resource, and a Location header (see section\n14.30).\n\nIn summary, it must be possible for the application state machine to be\ndriven by hypermedia alone. Removing links from the representation body and\ninstead putting them in HTTP headers prevents this and creates a dependency\non the HTTP protocol that hinders the evolution of the Web.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\r\n--0016e68e87185805250474305716\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Sep 21, 2009 at 5:46 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;spa=\r\nn dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;m=\r\nike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0=\r\n.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Andrew Wahbe wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin=\r\n: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI can see link headers =\r\nbeing useful if you need to use a representation format that doesn&#39;t su=\r\npport linking.
