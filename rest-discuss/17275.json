For example, when\n&gt; I&#39;m publishing something on the web with a web framework like\n&gt; RubyOnRails or whatever, I have a model of something, say a User, and\n&gt; a URL route like /user/:id, and some controller code that goes and\n&gt; fetches that model instance and delivers up some HTML for the user\n&gt; using a template. Every time I do something like this it just isn&#39;t\n&gt; feasible for me to think, hmmm is this URL identifying a real world\n&gt; object? Is the database record for the User an Information Resource?\n&gt; Or is my database record about a Real World Thing or a Document?\n&gt; Should I really have two URL paths here, one for the Document about\n&gt; the User and one for the User themself? Should I use a # in that URI,\n&gt; or use the 303 redirect to indicate it is the Real World Object?\n\nI know exactly what you mean! In the applications and web services I&#39;ve\nbeen involved in recently, I haven&#39;t ever needed to stop and ask the $64m\nmetaphysical question, &quot;is this an information resource or not?&quot;\n\nAll you end up caring about is, can my user or client get the data they need,\nand can they follow their nose from there to do whatever they need to do next\n(get more data/modify some data/process some data/...)?\n\nOne reason why I&#39;ve liked using content-based extensions to Atom recently\nis that it gives you a fairly intuitive convention for separating metadata\nfrom data. E.g., when you GET /person/123 you receive...\n\n&lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;published&gt;2010-10-14T18:29:48+01:00&lt;/published&gt;\n    &lt;updated&gt;2010-10-15T19:39:01+01:00&lt;/updated&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;edit&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;author&gt;\n        &lt;email&gt;jane.bloggs@...&lt;/email&gt;\n    &lt;/author&gt;\n    &lt;content type=&quot;application/x.exampleapp+xml&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;user xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;givenname&gt;Jane&lt;/givenname&gt;\n            &lt;familyname&gt;Bloggs&lt;/familyname&gt;\n            &lt;!-- etc. --&gt;\n        &lt;/user&gt;\n    &lt;/content&gt;\n&lt;/entry&gt;\n\n...and it&#39;s fairly intuitive that things like published, updated and author\nin the &quot;head&quot; of the representation are *about* the data, and things like\ngivenname, familyname, etc., *are* the data (in the same way that it&#39;s\nintuitive that stuff in the &lt;head&gt; of an HTML representation is *about*\nthe content, and stuff in the &lt;body&gt; element *is* the content to be rendered).\n\nNow, say your clients want to be able to navigate to relatives of Jane. You\nmight do something like...\n\n&lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/rel/mother&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/rel/father&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/789&quot;/&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/entry&gt;\n\n...or you might do...\n\n&lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;content type=&quot;application/x.exampleapp+xml&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;user xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n            ...\n            &lt;mother href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;father href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/789&quot;/&gt;\n            ...\n        &lt;/user&gt;\n    &lt;/content&gt;\n&lt;/entry&gt;\n\n...and it&#39;s an interesting side question which is better, but the point is\nthat from a hypermedia constraint point of view it doesn&#39;t really matter\nI don&#39;t think, because either way clients will have what they need to be\nable to make appropriate state transitions, and it certainly doesn&#39;t matter\nwhether http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456 identifies an information\nresource or not. In fact, if you then told me I had to do 303s from that URL\nto some other, as a web service engineer I&#39;d get frustrated, because that\nwould start introducing extra round trips which would slow everything down.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I totally sympathise with people who say &quot;don&#39;t conflate\nyourself with your homepage&quot;, but I guess I&#39;m saying that I can see how a\nlinked data engineer and a restful web service engineer would both look at\neach other&#39;s systems and go, &quot;you did what?&quot;\n\nCheers,\n\nAlistair\n\n&gt; \n&gt; YAGNI\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve found it easier to look at the World Wide Web through REST\n&gt; colored glasses where my URLs identify Resources, and my Server\n&gt; delivers up Representations of them. And yet, RDF remains a nice data\n&gt; model (with a few decent Representations) for describing web graphs,\n&gt; and it has rdf:type for explicitly documenting the nature of the\n&gt; Resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; //Ed\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#distinguishing\n&gt; [3] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI2\n&gt; [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#oldweb\n&gt; [5] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#id-resources\n&gt; [6] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#semweb\n\n-- \nAlistair Miles\nHead of Epidemiological Informatics\nCentre for Genomics and Global Health &lt;http://cggh.org&gt;\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics\nRoosevelt Drive\nOxford\nOX3 7BN\nUnited Kingdom\nWeb: http://purl.org/net/aliman\nEmail: alimanfoo@...\nTel: +44 (0)1865 287669\n\n"}}
