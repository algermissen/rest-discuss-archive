To make up for it, I wrote a really long\n&gt; response.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t have anything against JMS or messaging systems, they are great\n&gt; tools. And just like HTTP, they work wonders when used in the right\n&gt; situation. This thread is interesting to me because there hasn&#39;t been much\n&gt; discussion about applying aspects of REST to a classical asynchronous\n&gt; messaging based system. \n\nI&#39;ve been playing with both JMS and REST recently and at first, I was \ntrying to see how REST could be used instead of JMS. I came to think \nthat these 2 &quot;specifications&quot; should not be seen as one-or-the-other. \nThey are 2 different technologies that solve 2 different sets of \nproblem; they can play together nicely when facilitating access to a JMS \nservice is a requirement.\n\nIn our system, we have a bunch JMS services (queue receivers and topic \nconsumers). We provide custom Java client classes that clients can use \nto easily connect to the services. These talk directly to the JMS \nbrokers to contact our JMS services.\n\nThere is (well, will be) also a REST interface to the JMS services. The \nREST service allows the creation of a service request through a simple \nPOST to a URI. The implementation of this REST &quot;service&quot; connects to the \nJMS broker, sends the corresponding message, and waits (with timeout) \nuntil it receives confirmation that the message was received by the JMS \nservice. This confirmation of reception implies that the service request \nhas created  a resource and this new resource is returned to the REST \nclient who can, at anytime, GET it to see the status of his orignal \nrequest (running, completed, cancelled, logging ...).\n\nSo far, the JMS custom client classes are only used internally, and \nwhile the system has not yet been used by our clients, I expect they \nwill prefer to use the REST access to the service. Even though the Java \nJMS custom classes provide finer control, REST&#39; simplicity will most \nlikely be a real advantage.\n\nTechnically, from REST&#39;s client perspective, the launching of the \nservice is synchronous: the REST server connects to the JMS service, \nwaits for confirmation of reception, and returns the resource URI to the \nclient. But the execution of the service request is asynchronous, and \nthe REST clients can make calls on the returned URI to check the status \nof the JMS service request.\n\n\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n"}}
