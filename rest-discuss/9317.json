Joe&#39;s posted a blog entry here (http://bitworking.org/news/210/Project-Zero ).\n&gt;\n\n\nIBM have something like 40% market share of the enterprise SOA\nindustry; WebSphere &quot;-1&quot; has embraced WS-* like there&#39;s no tomorrow.\nProject 0 may be a clean start for IBM, but I dont see them abandoning\nthe dark side. [disclaimer, I work for a competitor].\n\nPutting that aside, two interesting things\n * its not open source, just open dev. I&#39;m somewhat reminded of MS&#39;s\nchannel-9 and fairly open access to the dev team; I wonder if\nmarketing will be involved in project 0 to make all thinking public.\nLike the discussions on pricing, whether they view Ruby/Rails as a\ncompetitor, etc.\n * use of groovy and PHP as scripting frameworks.\n\nView it as an experiment to gauge consumer reaction. If you like it,\nthey get to convince management to go to product release and price\nthings high enough to make the DB2 license you will also need seem\nlike a bargain. If it doesnt get takeup, then it can die without IBM\nhaving to publicly announce &quot;WS bad, REST good&quot;, &quot;Websphere -1 bad,\nProject 0 good&quot;. It could be the basis for a websphere successor, or\nits an attempt to divert engineering effort from OSS competitors, and\nfrom anything that the JCP process is tring to come up with. Everyone\nwho writes an app on project 0 is someone who isnt providing patches\nand docs to Rails, to Phobos, to Cocoon. That may appeal to some\npeople, but long term it isnt necessarily in their interest.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
