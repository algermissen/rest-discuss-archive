All changes to a bound contract \nmust be accepted by both parties.\n\nSo what they do in EDI is create Change Orders, which are documents \ndefining either a changed contract in total, or just the requested \nchanges to an existing contract.  \n\nOne party requests changes by issuing a Change Order, and the other \nparty either accepts or rejects them or they may go into negotiation.\n\nSo in this situation, I think a Change Order could be POSTed by one \nparty to the original contract resource as a sub-resource, and if the \nother party accepts the changes, the contract resource would be \nchanged, and also the Change Order and its acceptance would be \nretained as part of the audit trail of the contract.\n\nTakes care of both authorization for changes as well as deltas.\n\nI know, it seems like admitting an operation through the back door, \nbut that&#39;s the way it&#39;s done when people want to be formal about it.\n\nPossibly overkill for many situations, but I&#39;d be interested if \nanybody thinks it&#39;s unRESTful.
