So going back to more  \nhumbler =\r\nexpectations. How do you guys think is it best to &#39;instruct&#39;  \nthis &#39;generi=\r\nc rest client&#39; properly? What do we expect as inputs and  \noutputs for this=\r\n client and what steps it should take. Moreover, how  \ndo we express these =\r\ninstructions to the client? I&#39;d sure hate to code  \neverything manually. A =\r\nDSL might make sense here. Any thoughts?\n\nOn Oct 10, 2009, at 10:34 PM, Jos=\r\nh Sled wrote:\n\n&gt; Jan Vincent &lt;jvliwanag@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt; What\n&gt;&gt; are t=\r\nhe cues human users of the web follow to understand the html  \n&gt;&gt; page\n&gt;&gt; r=\r\nendered to them? I was wondering if such might be applied to work\n&gt;&gt; simila=\r\nrly to computers.\n&gt;\n&gt; My favorite go-to example along these lines is credit=\r\n card entry for\n&gt; purchases.  If you as a human see a form with a heading i=\r\nncluding the\n&gt; words &quot;credit card&quot;, and an input for a number, expiration d=\r\nate and  \n&gt; (in\n&gt; &quot;v2&quot; of the form) a CCV code =85 you know what to do.  If=\r\n it asks for\n&gt; something different, you&#39;d be as stuck as a computer would b=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is that versioning step =85 when CCV codes were introduc=\r\ned,\n&gt; sites could add explanatory text and a picture to help describe the  =\r\n\n&gt; new\n&gt; concept.  It&#39;s that level of teaching that&#39;s hard to reproduce for=\r\n an\n&gt; automated client; it&#39;s probably the point the engineer gets involved =\r\n \n&gt; and\n&gt; patches the code to support the new field, probably by interpreti=\r\nng  \n&gt; the\n&gt; same explanatory text + picture from a trace of the recent fai=\r\nlures of\n&gt; the automated client.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On the other hand, is\n&gt;&gt; there a &#39;s=\r\nmart&#39; way for a generic REST client to figure out the\n&gt;&gt; meanings of the hy=\r\npermedia without explicit specifications?\n&gt;\n&gt; At the level you&#39;re thinking =\r\nof, I don&#39;t believe so, no.  Given  \n&gt; there&#39;s\n&gt; no inherent meaning in any=\r\n of this stuff, everything must be specified\n&gt; somehow.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; ...jsled\n=\r\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - a=3Djsled; b=3Dasynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b=\r\n}\n\nJan Vincent Liwanag\njvliwanag@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
