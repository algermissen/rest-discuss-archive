There&#39;s nothing &quot;SEO unfriendly&quot; about the URL you posted.\nAny advantage to placing keywords in URIs comes down to extreme cases\nof tie-breaking where all other things are equal.\n\nMeaning there are a hundred other things you can do for your site to\nmake it rank better, regardless of your URI allocation scheme.  Lacing\nyour URIs with keywords is almost completely pointless in this regard.\nThere&#39;s really no connection between your URI allocation scheme&#39;s\nusability, and either REST or SEO.\n\nYour resource, http://www.mysite.com/blogs/peter, can return anything\nyou need it to return, regardless of any back-end API.  You can refer\nto my demo site for ideas on how to integrate Atom feeds into Web pages\nin a direct fashion:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/xmltest/example.axml\n(works cross-browser when /date service is online, lacks CSS for IE)\n\nClient side or server side, you can easily use XSLT to transform an\nAtom source into an XHTML page.  Just remember to link to that source\nin the result, and use its URI in Content-Location if you&#39;re using\nconneg to determine whether to return Atom or XHTML for a particular\nresource.\n\nI developed the Atom framework first, that&#39;s the API, the XHTML is just\ntransformations.  There&#39;s really no need to put the URI of a &quot;REST\nresource&quot; into the URI of a request.  If that&#39;s how you want your back-\nend to look, fine, but you still don&#39;t need to expose it to the world.\n\n-Eric\n\n&quot;Jorn Wildt&quot; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am experimenting with a setup where I base a website completely on\n&gt; a REST API. This means creating the REST API first and then only\n&gt; using that for fetching data to display in the website. This leads to\n&gt; some troubles with URLs for the website - especially how the web URL\n&gt; should identify the REST resources to display.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a traditional website there is a tight integration to the backend\n&gt; database. This means we can use DB identifiers and readable names in\n&gt; our URLs. Something which most people agree on is good for SEO.\n&gt; Example: to show Peters blog we use the URL\n&gt; http://www.mysite.com/blogs/peter.\n&gt; \n&gt; But what happens if the backend is a REST API? Now we cannot just\n&gt; write &quot;peter&quot; in the URL since this tells us nothing about how to\n&gt; fetch the &quot;peter&quot; resource. We must instead include the whole URL for\n&gt; the &quot;peter&quot; resource. This URL could be\n&gt; http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/peter which would serve an ATOM feed for\n&gt; our website to format and display nicely. From this follows that our\n&gt; website URL must include the url encoded &quot;peter&quot; reference. Now our\n&gt; URL becomes:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.mysite.com/blogs/http%3a%2f%2frest.mysite.com%2ffeeds%2fpeter\n&gt; \n&gt; The downside of this is that our web URL becomes SEO unfriendly,\n&gt; unreadable and impossible to remember. The upside is that we can now\n&gt; display *any* ATOM feed on our website, not just our own feeds, which\n&gt; in turn happens to be both good and bad. It&#39;s bad because evil\n&gt; persons can craft a URL with a reference to an evil hackers ATOM feed\n&gt; and make it look like a URL to our site. It&#39;s good because it gives\n&gt; us much more flexibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could of course publish a URL template for my ATOM resources,\n&gt; stating that &quot;peter&quot; can be mapped to\n&gt; http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/peter. \n&gt; \n&gt; But the use of URL templates makes link relations in the ATOM feed\n&gt; less usefull. A link relation must include the complete URL to the\n&gt; related resource. So an ATOM related link to &quot;older entries&quot; could be\n&gt; http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/peter?page=2. Now we *have* to put this\n&gt; complete reference into our website&#39;s URL:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://rest.mysite.com/blogs/peter/http%3a%2f%2frest.mysite.com%2ffeeds%2fpeter%3fpage%3d2\n&gt; \n&gt; So our website&#39;s URL becomes more and more obscure if we really don&#39;t\n&gt; want to know anything about the REST API&#39;s url templates.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have I missed something? Comments?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
