I&#39;ll take a look at the relevant mailing lists to see what has been \n&gt; discussed.\n\nLittle, unfortunately.\n\n&gt; Rather than wait for a revised 2616, it would be nice if there were \n&gt; rough consensus on what the semantics for PUT should be. Is there? If \n\nAbsolutely. The first step is getting consensus on the issue, the next \nstep is proposing actual spec text.\n\n&gt; not, I think it is important that deeper explanations of REST highlight \n&gt; this fundamental disagreement among theorists and practitioners. (The \n&gt; otherwise excellent &quot;RESTFul Web Services&quot; book does not seem to deal \n&gt; with the issue, for example.) Perhaps I&#39;ll contribute something to the \n&gt; REST wiki on the subject. (I looked there and did not see anything.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, and most relevantly for this group, do any of the principles of \n&gt; REST have a bearing on which way the semantics of PUT should be revised? \n\nI wouldn&#39;t think so. It seems to be purely a matter of HTTP semantics.\n\nMy impression is that people try to do more things with PUT as they \nshould, as they don&#39;t have PATCH. Maybe fixing the latter helps.\n\n&gt; For example, does the principle of &quot;identification of resources&quot; \n&gt; (everything via URI and a URI for everything) imply that elements of a \n&gt; representation that change independently should have their own URIs, \n&gt; enabling PUT to efficiently use only replacement semantics?\n\nI think if it&#39;s desired to be able to independently edit these \nresources, separate URIs are a very good way to achieve this. See XCAP \n(RFC4825) and JCR (JSR-170).\n\n&gt; And if REST principles don&#39;t give any guidance as to whether replacement \n&gt; and merge semantics should be combined in one method (PUT) vs. separated \n&gt; into two methods (PUT/PATCH), does that say anything about the \n&gt; prescriptive power of REST? Just asking, not dissing REST (you know I \n&gt; love REST). &lt;grin&gt;\n\nNo comment :-).\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n"}}
