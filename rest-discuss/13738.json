For example  \n(shameless book plug follows, sorry!), in our forthcoming book, Savas,  \nIan, and I show how we could outsource the payment of coffee orders to  \na third party using a hypermedia-driven protocol.\n\nThe automata client &quot;writes&quot; data to at least two services in this use- \ncase. Does that qualify as service composition? If so I can elaborate,  \nif not I&#39;m stuck.\n\nJim\n\n"}}
