I am hav=\r\ning very similar\nconversations at work, and i am trying to decide exactly w=\r\nhat i think.\n\n&gt; - omitting _properties_ of the message? not following you h=\r\nere. maybe an example you\n&gt; can point to would clear this up for me.\n\nWell,=\r\n if a human goes to a web page in a browser we just omit any\nlinks they are=\r\n not allowed to execute (either because they are not\nauthorized, or because=\r\n the state of the resource does not allow it). I\nwas suggesting that we mig=\r\nht do the same thing with any other media\ntype.\n\n&gt; - seems you assume M2M h=\r\nere in several of your replies. is it your POV that\n&gt; RDF is only to be use=\r\nd in M2M scenarios? or do you mean to say that some of\n&gt; the affordances is=\r\n describe have no value in M2M cases?\n\nI did not mean to imply that RDF wou=\r\nld *only* be useful in the M2M\nscenario. I do think RDF is more compelling =\r\nfor M2M use cases, though.\nWe already have a quite good media type for use =\r\ncases that involve\nreal time user interaction (HTML). No need to reinvent t=\r\no wheel for\nthose use cases. For automata use cases HTML is somewhat less\nc=\r\nompelling.\n\nAs for affordances, I am not sure i see the same set of afforda=\r\nnces\nyou do, or at least not in the same way. By analogy, in the physical\nw=\r\norld some affordances are possible because of the laws of nature or\nthe evo=\r\nlution of the human body, other are based purely on cultural\nconvention (eg=\r\n, up usually maps to forward). I think the &quot;embed&quot; link\naffordance is based=\r\n on a set of cultural conventions (img usually maps\nto embed). However, whi=\r\nch culture a client belongs to depends on what\nit is trying to accomplish a=\r\nnd what technology it uses. So different\nclients might interprete the same =\r\nfeature as a different affordance.\n\n&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusivel=\r\ny a H2M (human-to-machine) affordance, i use\n&gt; &quot;x:include&quot; quite often in M=\r\n2M cases\n\nI agree that automated user agent can make good use of transclusi=\r\non.\nHowever, i am inclined to think that the decision of whether to\ntranscl=\r\nude belongs to the client rather than the server. Proxies to\nnot transclude=\r\n any representations in html, regardless of the flavor\nof those links. Scre=\r\nen readers have no need to transclude images in\nHTML. Nor do (most) automat=\r\ned user agents, for that matter.\n\nAre these clients wrong/broken when they =\r\nchoose to treat a &quot;embed&quot;\nlink as a &quot;navigation&quot; link?\n\nUnder what circumst=\r\nances would it be wrong/broken for an automated\nclient to transclude a &quot;nav=\r\nigation&quot; link if it could successfully\ninterpret the resulting document?\n\n&gt;=\r\n - templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, IME. as long as the v=\r\nocab is\n&gt; stable and the templates are used to control timing and flow, thi=\r\ns has worked well\n&gt; for me. of course H2M templates are much easier to supp=\r\nort since the selector is\n&gt; not in the code, but in the head of the human.\n=\r\n\nAgreed. There are situations where templates provide significant\nvalue. (E=\r\ng, give me a list of thing created between two timestamps.)\nHowever, that v=\r\nalue is less overwhelming in M2M scenarios.\n\n&gt; finally:\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So is y=\r\nour point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF\n&gt;&gt; based me=\r\ndia type? =A0Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do\n&gt;&gt; so?\n&gt; &lt;=\r\n/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; is it possible? not sure. my first attempts have not been good, =\r\nbut that&#39;s proly *me*&lt;g&gt;.\n\nThat is not promising. Though as you point out, =\r\nnot conclusive.\n\n&gt; is it *important*? not really. CSV doesn&#39;t provide affor=\r\ndances and it does\n&gt; quite well. my comment here is really about my particu=\r\nlar experience.\n\nWell, CSV does quite well as a data format. But not so wel=\r\nl as a media\ntype on which to build complex distributed applications.\n\n&gt; i =\r\nam writing apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse,\n&gt; and (in s=\r\nome cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses.\n&gt; When i implem=\r\nent those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill;\n&gt; that&#39;s all.\n\nF=\r\nair enough. The rendering part does seem like it would be a bit\nharder to h=\r\nandle with RDF. All the UI logic would have to be directly\ncoded into the c=\r\nlient(s).\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
