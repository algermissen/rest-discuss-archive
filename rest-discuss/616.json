So the semantics of PUT are definitely\n&gt; wrong for notification.\n\nSo treat it as a semaphore; a resource that represents my interest in\nthe resource.  If it&#39;s &quot;0&quot;, then I don&#39;t care.  If it&#39;s &quot;1&quot;, then I do\ncare, and I&#39;ll go off and do my thing, then set it back to &quot;0&quot;.  That&#39;s\nall PUT.\n\n&gt; You obviously can use POST.  But that is because\n&gt; POST has no meaning at all.  It is used for\n&gt; queries (terroristornot.com), it is used for\n&gt; updates, it is even used to delete sometimes.\n&gt; Often POST actually results in the creation of\n&gt; new resources (e.g. adding stuff to a shopping\n&gt; basket).\n\nI&#39;m not singling you out here Alex, because others have said it, but\nPOST has a *very* precise meaning.  It&#39;s not fuzzy at all.  All that&#39;s\nfuzzy is the implementation details of what it means for the POSTed\nthing to be processed.  But that&#39;s implementation, not interface.\nThe interface is quite clear.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
