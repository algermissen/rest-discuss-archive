But that doesn&#39;t mean\nthere aren&#39;t ways you can win by keeping the rest of\nyour app RESTful in its design.\n\nStill, reading the code, I think the cookie is there so\nthe shopping cart can be repopulated after quitting the\nbrowser, or a reload. Pretty orthogonal to maintaining\nconnection state. A *good* use of cookies, dare I say?\n\nI&#39;ll probably study this properly over the weekend to\nfind out for sure, but I have a hard time seeing how\nyou couldn&#39;t POST a representation of the array of\nordered items.\n\n"}}
