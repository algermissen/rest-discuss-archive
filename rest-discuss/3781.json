That is why\n&gt; those fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that\n&gt; functionality in another field?\n\nWith all due respect, given that HTTP authentication is fundamentally \nbroken*, that cookies are a defacto standard, and that HTTP-auth is poorly \nsupported by actual UAs.  The bigger question is why duplicate cookie \nfunctionality with auth-specific headers?\n\nThe argument for HTTP-auth is that it provides an automated mechanism for a \nweb server to tell a web client that authentication information is required \nand specifies the type.\n\nWhen end-users are accessing a web site, auth is a user interface issue and \nnot automatic so there is no reason why auth requirements cannot be \nspecified in the body of a 401 response.\n\nWhen auth-access is automated, are there actual contexts in which automated \nclients try to access get a 401 and then try some auth protocol?  In \nreality don&#39;t they simply request with the correct auth and if that&#39;s what \nthey do, isn&#39;t that simply passing a cookie?\n\n-Alex-\n\n* HTTP-auth is broken because nothing binds the auth to the content of the \nrequest, so there is no protection from MITM attacks.  You can solve this \nwith SSL, but that is not part of the HTTP spec and is unfortunately \noverkill for many applications.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
