It would be almost like having a Set-Authorization response\n&gt; header that could be returned from posting a login form, giving the\n&gt; credentials that should be returned by the client on subsequent\n&gt; requests.\n&gt; Does that make any sense?\n\nYou should note that there is no design reason why Authorization\nand WWW-Authenticate are limited to Basic and Digest.  That is why\nthose fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that\nfunctionality in another field?\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
