So the &quot;engine&quot; phrase suits your  \nmind, fine. Others may prefer something protocol-centric (I do). I  \ndon&#39;t see anyone trying to squeeze marketing value out of this, I see  \npeople trying to understand and help other people to do the same.\n\n&gt; I mean, I think buzzwords can be a good thing in spreading  \n&gt; technologies\n&gt; (like it was the case with AJAX), but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a value in\n&gt; these kind of expressions to explain what&#39;s explained by the author\n&gt; itself, on the contrary it only adds to the confusion.\n\nYou are, of course, entitled to that opinion. But I rather like  \n&quot;Hypermedia constrains/describes protocols.&quot; It is a useful vehicle  \nfor engaging people in this difficult subject area. While the formal  \nHATEOAS might be useful as a tool for communicating at a PhD level  \n(its original intent), perhaps there are better terms that can be used  \nin a broader software engineering context.\n\nUntil I hear compelling reasons to abandon these thoughts, I&#39;ll keep  \non using them. So far, nothing compelling on this list.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"}}
