Visibility is improved because a monitoring system does not\n&gt; have to look beyond a single request datum in order to determine the\n&gt; full nature of the request. Reliability is improved because it eases the\n&gt; task of recovering from partial failures [133].&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; These two features are preserved by the rule I stated about &quot;No Implicit\n&gt; State&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Scalability is improved because not having to store state between\n&gt; requests allows the server component to quickly free resources, and\n&gt; further simplifies implementation because the server doesn&#39;t have to\n&gt; manage resource usage across requests.&quot;\n\nI believe those three constraints can be satisfied by requiring that each\nrequest from client to server must contain all of the information necessary\nto understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context\non the server.\n\nIn short, I agree with the &quot;No Implicit State&quot;, but I still don&#39;t see how\nthese assersions support the conclusion that &quot;Clients should be considered\nentirely stateless.&quot;\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
