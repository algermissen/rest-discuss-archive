I am not sure it is\n&gt; restful though.  If I am not mistaken using POST suggests the\n&gt; following to the restful observer.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1&gt; Changing an existing resource, adding to a collection of\n&gt; resources. 2&gt; Providing a set of data for the server to process.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I am not sure that the scenario Michael described falls into these\n&gt; two categories, so I wonder if using POST is restful.  I would be\n&gt; interested to hear a counter argument.\n\nNo counter argument from me. I posted the original question precisely \nbecause I couldn&#39;t think of a RESTful way, whereas a non-RESTful one, \nusing POST was obvious from the start.\n\nLooking back, however, I should have emphasized even more that I was \nasking about principles, not for a solution to a practical problem. \nAlthough the two can coincide.\n\n&gt; Also I believe that using POST takes away the ability to cache,\n\nAgreed. But I think there are cases where this is really an advantage. \nCaching is useful for requests that are expected to be repeated. Let&#39;s \ntake the case of a relatively cheap computation that takes arbitrary \nparameters. It is unlikely that the same request is repeated and even if \nit is, the cost is low. Therefore the gain of caching is low. But there \nare costs of caching too. First there&#39;s the cost of caching the request \nitself. Then there&#39;s the opportunity cost of *not* caching (evicting) \nanother request.\n\n&gt; This is not to say that POST cannot be used, I just doubt that this\n&gt; would be considered restful.\n\nThen, is this just a legitimate case where RESTful principles don&#39;t \napply? Restricting REST to a defined scope isn&#39;t a bad thing at all.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
