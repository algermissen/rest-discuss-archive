Is tha=\r\nt the case?\n\nCookies in HTTP always violate REST. By definition, cookies ar=\r\ne a\nmechanism for associating requests with a session maintained on an\norig=\r\nin server. If an application uses cookies as intended, the use of\nthe cooki=\r\nes violates the constraint of stateless communication. If an\napplication us=\r\nes cookies but does not use them as intended, the use of\nthe cookies violat=\r\nes the constraint of self-descriptive messages. Maybe\nmy premise is wrong a=\r\nnd cookies are not a mechanism for associating\nrequests with a session main=\r\ntained on an origin server. Maybe cookies\npass arbitrary information from o=\r\nrigin server to user agent and back. If\nthat is so, then the use of cookies=\r\n still violates the constraint of\nself-descriptive messages, because cookie=\r\ns are not self-descriptive at\nall.\n\nGiven that cookies in HTTP always viola=\r\nte REST, I add that violating\nREST is not the end of the world, and so usin=\r\ng cookies is not the end of\nthe world. Sometimes cookies are a decent way t=\r\no get a job done.\n\n-- \nPlease do not reply to me when replying to rest-disc=\r\nuss.
