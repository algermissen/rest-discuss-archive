This corresponds to Jan&#39;s &#39;group&#39;\n&gt; resources, i.e. you can just GET them.  Where is the caller\n&gt; of getMumbles getting its mumbleIds parameter from?  Is\n&gt; there a resource there waiting to have a URI assigned to it?\n\nGood questions...\n\nThe caller in the case I was thinking them gets the list of ids in the\ncourse of some other computation ... in the course of converting Foos to\nBars, an intermediate step is to dereference the Mumbles that the Foos\ncontain.  So, I guess there is a resource there, but it&#39;s quite\ntransient, and it doesn&#39;t really pass a threshold for &quot;general\napplicability&quot; on some scale.  I guess this is the &quot;permenance&quot; axis;\nthese resources are quite transient.\n\nThe other dimension is &quot;domain&quot;.  These resources wouldn&#39;t really exist\nwithin the domain-of-discourse of the rest of the resource space, but\ninstead at a level above it ... their grouping isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; within\nthe [resource] space, but instead created solely by a computation on the\nspace.  While systems generally have to deal with these shifts, we don&#39;t\nhave to like it. :)  So, on the &quot;domain&quot; axis, I&#39;d put these resources\nquite low.\n\n[If those axes were X and Y, respectively, on some graph, this would be\nright down near the origin.]\n\nAs well, the semantics of POST are still inappropriate, I think. \nThere&#39;s no need for an unsafe, non-idempotent operation to enter the mix\nto handle, basically, a bunch of GETs.\n\nTherefore, I&#39;m disinclined to create a resource or use POST for this\nbatchGET.\n\nPlus the round-trip overhead of POST + GET; probably a small price to\npay, though.\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, I&#39;ve used the mumbleGroup concept as well; there&#39;s\ndefinitely times where the system resource-domain has groups that should\nbe treated as first-order concepts.  I just don&#39;t think this is one of\nthem.\n\n\n\n&gt; I like the idea of POSTing queries and turning them in to\n&gt; resources, because you can attach metadata to them.\n\nIndeed -- especially when it fits into the resource domain -- that is,\nthere are natural group resources which are defined by lists and/or\nqueries.\n\nAt the same time, I&#39;m sympathetic to the desire to have a QUERY\noperation which takes a request body, which helps satisify a different\nclass of queries.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
