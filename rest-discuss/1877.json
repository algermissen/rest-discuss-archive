The Amazon interface supports HTTP/URL requests with \n&gt; XML returned data and some folks here refer to it as being a REST \n&gt; interface.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On the other hand, I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of postings here and \n&gt; on XML-DEV about strict adherence to the REST URL scheme (i.e. \n&gt; http://.../search/isbn/123456789 vs.\n&gt; http://.../search?isbn=123456789).\n\nNo, actually it is strictly REST. If the client needs to generate a URI\nusing information only known to the client (like an ISBN number or a\ndate) then the URI should use a query string. But even if it wasn&#39;t\nstrictly REST-y, I wouldn&#39;t fuss too much about the construction of URIs\nbecause in the web architecture URIs are typically opaque.\n\n&gt; It seems to me that as long as the service has an HTTP/URL interface \n&gt; vs. SOAP packets, some folks might consider it as REST. But if \n&gt; you stick with the strict URL adherence/naming scheme, neither \n&gt; Google nor Amazon are strictly REST-compliant...\n\nSome pure-HTTP services are very un-REST. \n\n * http://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes/\n\nBut Amazon does not have this problem.\n\nDuring ETCON someone implied that they were using GET for things other\nthan queries but I don&#39;t see anything about that. They use POST for\nmutations which is good. And the XSLT service looks really cool.
