But I recently\nsaw an interesting piece of code, which forced me to think again about\nthe basics.\n\nThe code I am looking at, is actually overriding HttpServletRequest\nand oerriding &#39;getMethod&#39; to change HTTP verb from POST to GET. then\ndoing request forwarding.\nSo for the forwarded resource its a GET request, even if from browser,\nits was a POST request.\nI see two problems with this,\n1. The response is still given to user agent as part of POST request.\n2. For web container, even if getMethod is overridden, its a POST\nrequest. (I do not know, if in the forwarded requests, web containers\nstrictly use the request objects thats wrapped and do not use any of\nthe internal information for that request)\n\nThe advantage of this method, is that you do not need to persist\ninformation between redirects, So you do not need session or other\npersistence mechanism.\n\nAnyone else has seem this kind of idiom used in J2EE web applications?\n\nThanks,\nUnmesh\n\n"}}
