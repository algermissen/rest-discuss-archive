WE&#39;ve certainly been talking about it quite a bit&lt;g&gt;.\n\n&lt;snip&gt; I still lo=\r\nok for someone that explains in clear terms why is\nWSDL so bad. &lt;/snip&gt;\nPer=\r\nsonally, I don&#39;t find WSDL to be &quot;bad.&quot; I do, however, assert that\nthe WSDL=\r\n pattern is not compatible w/ Fielding&#39;s particular arch\nmodel. WSDL, as I&#39;=\r\nve experienced it (and continue to experience it)\ndoes not employ hypermedi=\r\na to drive the transfer of application state.\nThe WSDL implementations I se=\r\ne today still assume design-time\nconsumption and binding of a static, stron=\r\ngly-typed schema. I have yet\nto find WSDL implementations that induce the &quot;=\r\nArchitectural Properties\nof Key Interest&quot;[1] Fielding outlines; especially =\r\nModifiability. For\nthese reasons, when working in an arch model that follow=\r\ns the\nFielding&#39;s REST, I resist adding  WSDL|WADL implementations to the\nar=\r\nchitecture.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;At the end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which =\r\nis not\nthe case lately.&lt;/snip&gt;\nI find this interesting. I still see WSDL de=\r\nlivered to me by\nthird-party integrators that is in the RPC style. In fact,=\r\n I cannot\nrecall ever implementating a document-style WSDL integration for\n=\r\nproduction use. I&#39;d very much like to see some examples of this. The\ncloses=\r\nt I&#39;ve been able to come to any &quot;document-style&quot; w/ WSDL I&#39;ve\nbeen given is=\r\n to implement a single XML message-handler that treats a\nrange of calls eas=\r\nh as a unique &quot;message format&quot; instead of a single\ndocument model for a rel=\r\nated set of request/response interactions.\nMaybe I am simply working w/ rat=\r\nher dull folks who are not keeping up\non WSDL evolution. Please feel free t=\r\no pass along any pointers you\nhave on document-style WSDL implementations (=\r\nhere or off-list, if you\nlike).\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/=\r\ndissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp:/=\r\n/twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://r=\r\nest-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 23, 2010 at 09:54, William Martinez=\r\n Pomares\n&lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello.\n&gt; I still look for some=\r\none that explains in clear terms why is WSDL so bad. At the end the answer =\r\nis usually it supports RPC, which is not the case lately. Actually, it neve=\r\nr was, as document style services should be the ones to use. Oh, well.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhy is WSDL needed? To describe the actual service consumption process. Whe=\r\nre do we find the service? Where do we find the document format we need to =\r\nsend or expect to receive? Where do we find the message send a receive patt=\r\nern? It is there, in the WSDL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, REST allows that flow to be discove=\r\nred, rather than written in one place. Ian&#39;s description of the use of XFor=\r\nms achieves that, so they are similar in the goal, may not be so similar in=\r\n the process. Both will required some out-of-band information. XForms is no=\r\nt forcing the POST method, actually. Is is a way to describe the expected d=\r\nata in a known format, reducing coupling. You may later change the XFORM gi=\r\nven some data for the request is changed, and nothing breaks (as a matter o=\r\nf fact, with WSDL should happen the same, but people use compile time bindi=\r\nng, stubs, that break that possibility).\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, I think the benefit=\r\n of this form is it avoid, at least a little, the early binding that WADL o=\r\nr WSDL have. So, you are creating totally dynamic clients instead of static=\r\n ones, pre-build with stubs and things like that. There is still one proble=\r\nm to solve, though, the semantics of the data fields in the Form. But that =\r\nshould be managed as a pre defined context, with a general, agreed upon, gl=\r\nossary.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, J=F8rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was reading Ian Robins=\r\nons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (again, it&#39;s a good\n&gt;&gt; read) at http://ian=\r\nsrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/.\n&gt;&gt; Here he introduces=\r\n the idea of adding XForms to a link relation, such that\n&gt;&gt; instead of havi=\r\nng only:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 &lt;link rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot; title=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and=\r\n document out of band how to post data to that link, one could have an\n&gt;&gt; X=\r\nForm at the end of the link and then use that information as the\n&gt;&gt; online/=\r\ninline/in-band documentation.

If y=\r\nou then add a list of links to XForms, the list would be much\n&gt;&gt; like the W=\r\nSDL list of methods/messages.
