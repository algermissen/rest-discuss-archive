I might use the DC namespace as an identifier, but the idea of\nusing content negotiation here is fine.\n\nFor more complicated header semantics, where the client needs to be\nguaranteed that the server understands the extension, something like\nPEP, RFC 2774, or SOAP would be required.  But it doesn&#39;t sound like\nthat&#39;s critical for this example.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.  Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.   http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n   Will distribute objects for food\n\n"}}
