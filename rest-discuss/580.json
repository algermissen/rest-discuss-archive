This is\northogonal in some respects to whether it&#39;s push or pull.  Independent of that, the\nbasic idea is that state is transferred from origins to others;  those others then do\nthings with that state.  So in essence it&#39;s an object migration protocol for arbitrary\nrepresentations of object state, and everybody but the origin server receives /\nmaintains / caches one of these representations in order to act on it.  Even a browser\ncan be viewed as a cache with a pretty face.  What we&#39;re really adding with HttpEvents\nis an optional cache invalidation protocol which operates via HTTP and for which both\nsides present a resource-based and HTTP-appropriate interface.\n\n&gt; Be careful there...if this is true then we get back to treating PUT as\n&gt; PUSH CONTENT and POST as PUSH DELTA.\n\nNot necessarily.  As mentioned, I&#39;m in favor of treating notifications as just that,\nstrictly that from the perspective of HttpEvents:  a notification that change has\nhappened.  It&#39;s up to the client to get the state.  Pushing state is an optimization.\n(As an optimization, though, it seems that treating those methods that way might be\nappropriate in some contexts, but the negotiation details seem hairy so we should\nleave it alone.\n\n&gt; Will this happen often enough to worry about? Why would the client do a\n&gt; GET before it is notified? Maybe just dumb luck. Maybe clairvoyance.\n&gt; Neither seem important enough to worry about.\n\nThis kind of argument scares me.  ;-)\n\nSeriously, I see no harm in having the origin server provide a timestamp with each\nstate-change notification that says &quot;state changed at this time.&quot;  Seems to me there&#39;s\nno downside.  (Or, alternatively, not a timestamp but a fingerprint, etc.  Just\nsomething to let the subscriber check their current representation state against the\norigin state.)\n\n&gt; But maybe standard caching handles that. The client gets a notification\n&gt; of a change. It asks its local caching proxy for the document. The\n&gt; caching proxy uses all of the standard HTTP voodoo to say whether its\n&gt; local copy is fresh &quot;enough&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s true --- but what if the client is itself an intermediary? :-)\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t mind having optimizations as a SHOULD. They are best practices\n&gt; that clients and intermediaries do not rely upon but may use to improve\n&gt; performance. Arguably, all optimizations should be MAY or SHOULD. If you\n&gt; want to write this up as an optimization SHOULD or MAY, I&#39;d buy it.\n\nOkay, I haven&#39;t come up with a use case for why this should be a MUST, so I&#39;m willing\nto let it be optional.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
