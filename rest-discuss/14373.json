This frees you to make decisions in\n&gt; the future that might more difficult if you relied on more application\n&gt; specific. For example, spinning off some of these resources into a\n&gt; separate system to allow that functionality to be expanded on a\n&gt; separate release cycle, would mean that the lessons resource would\n&gt; need to interact with a search resource in the new system every time\n&gt; the lesson was requested. However, by using URIs you can avoid\n&gt; interacting with the remote resource at all when you only need the\n&gt; identification.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of URI is that, even though it&#39;s suggested\nthat they do not change, they CAN change.\n\nWhen a client, that happens to record URIs, references one, and the\nhost server sends them a 301, the client is then free to update their\nURI in place.\n\nThere&#39;s no mechanism for that when you just send a &quot;43S09&quot;. Because if\nyou build up http://my.edu/courses/43S09, and you get a 301, you don&#39;t\n&quot;know&quot; why the 301 moved. Could be because it was moved to\nhttp://socal.my.edu/courses/43S09 or http://my.edu/labs/43S09 or\nhttp://my.edu/course/54S08.\n\nAll sorts of reasons a URI can move or change.\n\nBut at if you record URIs there&#39;s a facility to communicate that\nchange lazily to clients. If you move from http://my.edu/courses/43S09\nto http://socal.my.edu/courses/43S09, then after 2 months of no\ntraffic at http://my.edu/courses, you can probably shut down that end\npoint safely.\n\nOne more reason why I think that clients must do a lot of the heavy\nlifting in a REST system in terms of protocol support.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
