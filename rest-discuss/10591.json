REST is only one\nchapter in a larger theme - the title of the dissertation is\n&quot;Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software\nArchitectures&quot;\n\nI&#39;ve read it probably half a dozen times now, and I learn something\nnew every single time.  I recall very strongly when I came up with the\nidea that in RESTful apps, not only could resources be &#39;objects&#39; or\n&#39;nouns&#39; but they could be &#39;verbs&#39; in the form of code... so I could\ncreate (and deploy) an application by HTTP PUT-ting new versions of\nsource code on my website instead of deploying a .war file or\nsomething like that.  The web server never goes down, you just update\nthe resources on it using the uniform interface inherent in the\napplication.\n\nBut of course that thought is not original, we use resources which are\nactually code all the time (e.g.\nhttp://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.2.3.js is a resource,\nthe jQuery javascript code) ..\n\nThat code-on-demand feature is in the dissertation.  But somehow, it\njust didn&#39;t click that code could be a resource, even though I&#39;m\nfamiliar with the Lisp world where the lines between code and data are\nblurred.\n\nFrom 5.1.7\nThe final addition to our constraint set for REST comes from the\ncode-on-demand style of Section 3.5.3 (Figure 5-8). REST allows client\nfunctionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the\nform of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the\nnumber of features required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features\nto be downloaded after deployment improves system extensibility.\nHowever, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional\nconstraint within REST.\n\n\nThen of course, you start to think about things like - if the code\nresource was stored as an abstract syntax tree or bytecode, you could\nrequest different representations of the code - such as Javascript,\nJava, or C# or Lisp representations depending on your language of\nchoice... the server would have a disassembler of sorts to turn the\nAST into source code.   But, we don&#39;t even have IDE workbenches that\ndo such things, and the usefulness of that is questionable, but that&#39;s\nwhere my mind wandered.\n\n-d-\n\nOn 4/2/08, dfl_maradentro &lt;dfl_maradentro@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Uummm, ok, I thought REST was tied to HTTP (cause WWW is tied mostly\n&gt; to HTTP and REST to WWW).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The difference is that ROA is based on HTTP, whereas in principle\n&gt; REST is\n&gt; &gt; not tied to HTTP, but\n&gt; &gt; HTTP 1.1 was setup the REST way.\n&gt; &gt; I think that is the difference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Roger van de Kimmenade\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Apr 2, 2008 at 4:33 PM, dfl_maradentro &lt;dfl_maradentro@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   More precisely, the book says something like:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ROA, a way of turning a problem into a RESTful Web Service: an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangement of URI&#39;s, HTTP, and XML...
