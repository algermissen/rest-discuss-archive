Actually, that&#39;s not just a RESTy design, that&#39;s the right way to do\naddressing / routing, period.  The address states where you want to get to,\nnot how you&#39;re going to get there --- that&#39;s a different job, appropriately\nand best handled by a different mechanism.  If we&#39;ve all learned anything in\n20+ years of protocol design, hopefully we&#39;ve learned that information\nspaces should be abstracted as far away as possible from the details of\nnavigating them.\n\nRandom thought:  that&#39;s probably the best argument for the Axiom of Opacity\nthat I&#39;ve yet encountered, oops. ;-)\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
