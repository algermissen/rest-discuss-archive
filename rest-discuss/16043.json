Any thoughts??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; First thought? Google ought to know better. If the desire is to GET\n&gt; an image from the server, rotated + or - x degrees, then the proper\n&gt; method is GET, not an RPC POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /image.jpg?rot=90\n\nI&#39;d agree with PUT over POST because you get a caching option (which is\nusually what you want for image operations). Whether to use GET seems\nlike an it depends thing - if a resource was created as a side effect of\nthat GET, then GET was not the right thing.\n\nIt&#39;s Friday so I&#39;d like to avoid a discussion on whether the resources\n&quot;/image.jpg?rot=90&quot; exist to be discovered by people (therefore GET) or\nwhether they are man made inventions (therefore POST/PUT) \n\n;)\n\nBill\n\n\n\n"}}
