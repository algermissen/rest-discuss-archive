If the clients wants to logout \n&gt; by issuing a post or delete on its a=\r\nuthentication resource, the server will \n&gt; know that the realm is no longer=\r\n valid. At that stage it will consider the \n&gt; authentication for that realm=\r\n to be outdated and the user to be anonymous. \n&gt; Any access to a protected =\r\nresource will simply re-trigger a 401.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve not experiemented with tha=\r\nt technique yet. The server would have to \n&gt; keep track of which realms wer=\r\ne used and discarded, or simply of the ones \n&gt; that have been issued and de=\r\nlete them when the user logs out or times out.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a bit worried that =\r\nthis approaches leads to UAs still believing they are \n&gt; authorized, and su=\r\nddenly stop being authorized without any form of obvious \n&gt; communication. =\r\nMaybe the fact that a 401 is re-issued is enough to make that \n&gt; solution r=\r\nestful?\n&gt; \n&gt; Seb\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fro=\r\nm: &quot;Berend de Boer&quot; &lt;berend@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 25, 2008 10:36=\r\n PM\n&gt; To: &quot;Ryan Tomayko&quot; &lt;rtomayko@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Authentication and authorization\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ryan&quot; =3D=3D Ryan Tomayko &lt;rtomayko@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Ryan&gt; Wh=\r\nile this may be _a_ solution, it sure doesn&#39;t feel like a\n&gt; &gt;    Ryan&gt; very=\r\n good one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Ryan&gt; Shouldn&#39;t forced logout be a function provided =\r\nby UAs (and\n&gt; &gt;    Ryan&gt; other types of clients)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recently someone =\r\nemailed me a different solution: always use a logged in\n&gt; &gt; user, which wou=\r\nld be &quot;anonymous&quot; if you don&#39;t know anything else.
