Let&#39;s not mix up financial transactions and=\r\n database transactions! We&#39;ll first talk about the need for atomic units of=\r\n work. Then see how to support financial transaction business logic.\n\nAlso,=\r\n we&#39;re talking about units of work in public view, not hidden behind resour=\r\nces. Inside, it&#39;s up to a resource to ensure that its integrity and consist=\r\nency are maintained through its interactions with others, and it&#39;s free to =\r\nuse transactions to achieve that internally if it wants, without exposing t=\r\nhat to its clients. &quot;\n\nAnd he continues:\n&quot;DC: In a distributed system, you =\r\nhave to decide on what to give up out of Consistency, Availability and Part=\r\nition Tolerance... &quot;\n\n&quot;DC: Essentially, the rule of thumb is, use ACID inte=\r\nrnally, use BASE externally.\n\nWe&#39;re back to the inevitable inversion from i=\r\nnternal imperative thinking to external declarative thinking.\n\nAs an impera=\r\ntive programmer you&#39;re inclined to want to take your internal programming s=\r\ntyle out into the distributed world - to think single-thread, central contr=\r\nol: &#39;begin - do work - commit&#39;.\n\nBut the importance of Availability and Par=\r\ntition Tolerance in distributed systems usually outweighs the importance of=\r\n Consistency, leading the wise architect to a more relaxed, less imperative=\r\n, more declarative approach. &quot;\n\nYou can continue reading, it is nicely expl=\r\nained and I think it matches fairly well this discussion.\n\nCheers!
