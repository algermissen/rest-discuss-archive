It seems like all\n&gt; operations -- mutation as well as retreival are done via GET, with the\n&gt; magic &quot;Operation={whatever}&quot; ... let alone REST &quot;Level 1&quot; , this doesn&#39;t\n&gt; even make a &quot;get/post&quot; distinction!\n\nYes, its pretty ugly ;-( I guess they only mapped the underlying (SOAP\norianted) app to URI params, in order to beeing able to call it RESTful.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Queues are identified by parameter name rather than as a resource...\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t played with it, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the\n&gt; responses always come back 200, with the actual error code in the\n&gt; response body.\n\nYou bet :o)\n\nWhat I like is the pattern and given enough time, I&#39;d surely like to\nimplement this RESTfully. I think there are quite some issues to\nexplore wrt reliability atc.\n\nDid you notice the read-and-remove operation? I wonder if that should\nbe done via POST to the queue or via DELETE to the enqueued item. Any\nthoughts?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s no /hypermedia as engine of application state/ involved, unless\n&gt; you count the API docs as such. :(\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, we have a major vendor promoting a REST interface [yay!] that shares\n&gt; ZERO components with the architectural style of the same name, nor any\n&gt; further conceptualization of it people on this list seem to have [boo!].\n\nYes, boo! but this also indicates that REST is (somehow) a marketing\nfactor...that&#39;s not bad after all.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [1]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/sdk/102-1177876-7264137?s=AWSSimpleQueueService&v=1%2d0\n&gt; [2]: http://asynchronous.org/blog/archives/2004/08/25/levels_of_rest.html\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
