Then=\r\n apply DELETE to that URI.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, Julian.  I hadn&#39;t th=\r\nought of this, but\nit doesn&#39;t apeal to me greatly as it adds an extra level=\r\n of\ncomplexity.  Previously, for each representation my client handled,\nit =\r\nneeded to remember the resource URI and the media type.  If I\nneed represen=\r\ntations to have URIs in order to be able to delete them,\nthen my client mus=\r\nt record the resource URI, the media type and\nthe representation URI.\n\nIt m=\r\night help if I explain what my application is.  It&#39;s a repository\n(initiall=\r\ny for ontologies, but I now realise it could be for any\ntype of resource). =\r\n Each resource in the repository can have many\nrepresentations (e.g. OWL an=\r\nd EPS representations of an ontology).\nIn addition, I use the RDF network A=\r\nPI Joseki to store metadata\nabout the resources (but that&#39;s not relevant to=\r\n my question here).\n\nThe only URIs that would be known to the user would be=\r\n those that\nidentify ontologies (or whatever other types of resource are\nst=\r\nored in the repository).  It therefore seems to go against\nOccam&#39;s Razor to=\r\n require additional URIs for representations, just\nso that that they can be=\r\n deleted (e.g. if one was mistakenly PUT to the\nwrong URI).  However, I rea=\r\nlise that one of the principles of REST is\nthat there is no need to sparing=\r\n with URIs, so perhaps Occam&#39;s Razor\nshouldn&#39;t be applied here.\n\nRegards,\nS=\r\ntephen\n\n"}}
