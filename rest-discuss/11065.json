I like the idea of\n &gt; capability-based systems.\n &gt;\n &gt; What do you think are the down-sides of this approach?\n\nIt occurs to me that maybe the lack of responses is because people may\nnot have followed the links and read the backstory.  Let me post a\n&quot;teaser&quot; here which suggests the core idea, with the caveat that you\nreally ought to read the article [1, 2] before following-up.\n\nThe core idea is:\n\n    Solve CSRF attacks by making references unforgeable, not by making\n    them unshareable.\n\nThis has a cost (it makes URLs long and opaque), but on the other hand\nit is the only possible defense against CSRF attack that also allows\npeople to share powerful resources at the web layer (by sharing URLs,\nHTML pages, Javascript, etc.).\n\nOur inspiration for taking this strategy is from the\nobject-capabilities community.  That community&#39;s definitive document\nis Mark S. Miller&#39;s PhD thesis [3].\n\nThis idea that we have deployed in Tahoe, the Least-Authority\nFilesystem, is relevant to several recent discussions on this mailing\nlist, such as [4, 5], and this post of last year by Roy Fielding: [6].\n\nRegards,\n\nZooko\n\n[1] http://hacktahoe.org/nathan_wilcox.html\n      # Nathan Wilcox and CSRF attacks\n\n[2] http://hacktahoe.org/csrf.html\n      # solve CSRF attacks by making references unforgeable, not by\n        making them unshareable\n\n[3] http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis\n      # Robust Composition: Towards a Unified Approach to Access\n        Control and Concurrency Control\n\n[4] http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.rest/8123\n      # Subject: HTTP cookies as unconditional violations of REST\n\n[5] http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.rest/8089\n      # Subject: Pretty URLs, sessions, and no cookies\n\n[6] http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.rest/6814\n      # Subject: Re: Work-arounds for RESTful use of unsupported PUT  \nand DELETE?\n\n\n"}}
