I am also doing a PhD. - Web \n&gt; services has caught my attention and REST in particular. \n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I am writing to you all is that I am struggling to find \n&gt; that &quot;angle&quot; in my PhD. I would love to help in the propogation of REST \n&gt; but am at a loss as to how my research can help. \n&gt; My superviser suggested either a) developing the concept further or b) \n&gt; solving issues with regard to REST and QoS e.g. reliability, security \n&gt; and transactions.\n&gt; My understanding with regard to b) is that REST uses https for security \n&gt; and Post Once Only for reliability. The area of reliability is \n&gt; attractive but I am open to ideas... \n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
