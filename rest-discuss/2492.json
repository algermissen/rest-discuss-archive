However, I\nam beginning to wonder if that&#39;s true.  Suppose you were to take the English\nlanguage.  Now, suppose I were to present to you the following:\n\n\n    twipperty\n\n\nYou say: &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;  I answer absolutely nothing.  It has not meaning\n(identifies nothing)  as a result it isn&#39;t even a word, even though it looks\nlike one.\n\n\nAnd this brings us to URIs.  Just because you can put together a random\nstring of characters that looks like a URI does not, in fact, make it a URI.\nAnd this is where I think we make our mistake....\n\n\nIf you were to see:\n\nhttp://www.not-an-actual-website.com/some-random-path/twipperty\n\n\nIs it a URI?  Well, it looks like one (and &quot;twipperty&quot; looked like a word).\nBut until you can resolve it to some sort of meaning (identify something\nwith it), then it ain&#39;t a URI, no matter how much it looks like one!\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
