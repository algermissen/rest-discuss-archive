Secondly,\n&gt; if that&#39;s the case then I&#39;m happy to start calling it &#39;semi-REST&#39;, so\n&gt; that we can move on to talk about the technical benefits of REST\n&gt; constraints, including this one, without getting side-tracked by this\n&gt; somewhat unnecessary fight over nomenclature.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t understand how striking out in the opposite direction of REST\ncan be dismissed as a semantic debate, or called semi-REST, when it&#39;s\nsomething altogether different from Roy&#39;s style.  I won&#39;t cherry-pick\nany of the dozen places where standardization is mentioned -- reading\nthe thesis should make it obvious that holistically, this style is\ndocument-oriented, and the format of those documents is generalized,\nnot customized per application or even per problem domain.\n\nA REST API is one where the data being transferred has been refactored\ninto common types.  Problems are solved using hypertext to customize\napplication flow.  Media and data type are bike-shed colors the system\nis not dependent upon (what matters is how the documents are linked\ntogether, i.e. how to transition from one state to another, so the\ndecision to use XForms vs. HTML forms is based on any criteria *but*\nthe nature of the data).\n\nIt is NOT REST to refactor the data type into one that&#39;s optimized for\nthe nature of the data being transferred, where problems are solved by\ncustomizing data types to guide application flow instead of using\nhypertext.  Media and data type are the foundation and framing of the\nresulting bike shed, which the system is absolutely dependent upon.\n\nCustomizing data and media types per resource type isn&#39;t REST even if\nthe resulting types are standardized.  It&#39;s anti-REST -- there&#39;s\nnothing in the thesis to support this approach, while everything the\nthesis does say, supports the approach where data and media types have\nno relationship to resource type (hypertext is the engine of application\nstate, not media type).\n\nSo we can&#39;t simply move on and start talking about custom media type\nsolutions in terms of REST, because the two approaches are so\ndissimilar as to not even be related.  REST is the opposite approach\nfrom optimizing media and data types around resource type, or the\nconcerns of application flow, because in REST media and data type have\nno relation to what the application states are or how to transition\nbetween them.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
