I&#39;m trying to improve my understanding =\r\nof REST in exactly this area myself lately.  \n\nFrom my reading, Amundsen is=\r\n NOT using a generic type (such as application/xml) - he is using a vendor =\r\nspecific but well documented type: application/vnd.phactor+xml.  You can se=\r\ne the documentation here: http://amundsen.com/media-types/phactor/\n\nI don&#39;t=\r\n know to what extent this is a real world media type or a sample of what a =\r\ngood one would look like, but it is definitely a vendor-specific media type=\r\n.  To me, his slides are advocating for a looser coupling of clients and se=\r\nrvers by defining the media type in terms of HOW you are going to relay inf=\r\normation, not WHAT information you are sending/receiving.\n\nSo, in the case =\r\nof the maze example, every maze element is just a list of links that you co=\r\nuld follow to another maze element.  Rather than define it in terms of \n&lt;ma=\r\nze&gt;&lt;connectedNodes&gt;&lt;maze id=3D&#39;m1&#39;/&gt;&lt;maze id=3D&#39;m2&#39;/&gt;&lt;maze id=3D&#39;m3&#39;/&gt;&lt;/con=\r\nnectedNodes&gt;&lt;/maze&gt;\n\nHe defines it as\n&lt;maze&gt;&lt;collection href=3D&quot;http:/www.e=\r\nxample/mazes&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=3D&quot;http://www.example.org/mazes/1&quot; rel=3D&quot;maze&quot; id=\r\n=3D&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;...&lt;/collection&gt;&lt;/maze&gt;\n\nNow, if you had a program that already un=\r\nderstood the application/vnd.phactor+xml media type, it would be able to un=\r\nderstand this quite well.  Of course, if you want to do something particula=\r\nrly &quot;mazy&quot; with it, you would have to understand specifically the media typ=\r\ne of application/vnd.amundsen.maze+xml, but there&#39;s no getting around that =\r\nI think.\n\nThat&#39;s the way I read it, but as I said, I&#39;m trying to get my hea=\r\nd around this stuff, too, so I&#39;d be interested in others&#39; thoughts on this =\r\njust like you.\n\nOn Jun 6, 2011, at 10:54 AM, albertwylde wrote:\n\n&gt; I am som=\r\newhat new to the REST architectural style, so please go easy on me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI am having difficulty understanding how a machine agent would understand t=\r\nhe content of my payload when using a generic media type.
