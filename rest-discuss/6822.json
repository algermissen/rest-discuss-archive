I consider it pragmatic to \nuse /people/ and /places/ instead of /xyzzy/ and /zyxxz/, vouching for the \nformer over the latter is one of common sense pragmatism IMHO.  The same goes \nfor using separate directories for separate types of resources, instead of \nsomething like /webapp/index.php?q=bob and /webapp/index.php?q=virginia -- \nthat is directly a matter of architecture and common-sense pragmatism.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Looking from &quot;the outside&quot;, respectfully speaking I think that is one of the\n&gt;problems with that which is called &quot;REST.&quot; If you can&#39;t really describe it\n&gt;in anything other than abstract terms, and you can&#39;t really implement it\n&gt;without making it not REST, than does it really exist other than to stir up\n&gt;endless debate? Sorry if I&#39;m being pedantic, but jeesh.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m hardly on &quot;the inside&quot;, heheh.  I&#39;ve given a couple of concrete examples \nof architectural differences in URIs which are hardly abstract notions.  I \nfurther believe that singular vs. plural is an abstract notion since they \nhave no architectural difference.  What I&#39;m implementing is REST-derived, but \nI believe it would be doing me an injustice to call that *not* REST.  The app \nI&#39;m developing implements discrete programmatic constraints within a set of \nabstract architectural constraints known as REST.\n\nAlthough, since I haven&#39;t published a working example for people to tear \ninto, it&#39;s still open for debate that I haven&#39;t stepped outside the REST \nconstraints in some way or another.  In which case, I would be REST-inspired \nnot REST-derived, and it would be accurate to say that my results are *not* \nREST.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
