If  the CGI produces a XHTML error form then it can be used by both users and processes. Here is a link to some notes on using XSL with a wiki to produce a REST interface. It uses Google search as one of it&#39;s service.http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/XslWikiThere are working samples in linked pages, but they are still primitive and under construction.  The URL hiding is a security advantage especially when the querystring parameters are hidden. If the XSL is attached to the server in a way that the end user can&#39;t access it, the details of the web service are kept from the user, even when the XSL is executing on the client.
