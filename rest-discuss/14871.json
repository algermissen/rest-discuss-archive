Either choice may be RESTful, one is not more RESTful than the\nother.\n\nThe point of applied software architecture, following any given style,\nis to provide a context for making implementation decisions.  Media\ntype design impacts URI design in REST.  Media type selection/creation\ndoes not follow from URI design -- the cart must come *before* the\nhorse.\n\nRestricting media type choice based on what works with the URI design,\ninstead of choosing/creating the media type which best fits the data\nmodel, breaks with REST discipline.  The resulting system can only be\ncompared against its own narrow interpretation of REST, which defeats\nthe purpose of applied software architecture.\n\nIdeally, the architect can evaluate the implementation&#39;s design choices\nagainst the entire REST style, as opposed to a preconceived notion of\nthe style -- where queries must be made against the server, and the pros\nand cons of constraining query to the client through use of URI\nfragments are not considered.  (No offense intended, just illustrating \nmy point.)\n\nTo follow REST, is to use it as your guide when considering tradeoffs,\nlike where to draw the line between client (#) and server (?) when\nmodeling a new API.  Being RESTful is not the end-all, be-all of API\ndesign -- meeting the goals of the system, is (RESTful or not).\n\nOne API may not be more RESTful than another, but only one likely fits\nbest with the goals of the system.  REST is a process, not an outcome.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
