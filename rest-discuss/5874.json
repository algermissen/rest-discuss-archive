I don&#39;t believe  \n&gt;&gt; WEBDAV methods are necessary or even advisable for REST based  \n&gt;&gt; apps. &lt;/Nic&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Ah, the slings and arrows, fantastic!  :-)  So, you are certainly\n&gt; entitled to your opinion, and others theirs. I&#39;m well aware that\n&gt; crusades can be difficult... Let&#39;s take a closer look at this issue\n&gt; together then.\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I&#39;ll note that there is no mention in Fieldings&#39;  \n&gt; dissertation of\n&gt; which specific methods are necessary, sufficient or even desireable  \n&gt; for\n&gt; a REST application to support. There is, however, the constraint that\n&gt; REST resources support a uniform interface. HTTP simply happens to be\n&gt; /an implementation/, albeit the most widely deployed and, some would\n&gt; argue, the best available.  ;-)  REST is no more defined by GET, PUT,\n&gt; POST and DELETE than it is by the FOO, BAR, BAZ and BLAH methods of  \n&gt; some\n&gt; other implementation. To take your position to the extreme, someone  \n&gt; may\n&gt; just as well state that REST is solely defined by GET and POST...\n\nThat is correct.  My work distinguished between the REST architectural\nstyle and any particular instantiation of that style (URI, HTTP, etc.).\nThis is undoubtedly a pain in the ass for folks who just want an\nacronym for good webarch design.\n\n&gt; IMHO, necessity has very little to do with the issue, otherwise one  \n&gt; may\n&gt; just as well tunnel all of your application semantics through POST and\n&gt; be done with it. (Oh, wait, that&#39;s SOAP over HTTP!) It is not the\n&gt; /necessity/ of DELETE, for example, that makes it a good idea, it&#39;s\n&gt; simply that if everyone implemented their own DELETE via POST we would\n&gt; soon find ourselves back in fragmented API land. Clearly, the same can\n&gt; be said of PUT (and some do). Similarly, metadata properties  \n&gt; associated\n&gt; with a resource may be set and read via POST, resources could be moved\n&gt; and copied about via POST and so on. The fact remains, however, that\n&gt; there are standardized protocol methods that have been defined for  \n&gt; these\n&gt; common operations. Further, these methods have been defined within the\n&gt; HTTP framework as extensions to HTTP itself -- they are intended to  \n&gt; play\n&gt; nicely together.\n\nSometimes.  PROP* methods conflict with REST because they prevent\nimportant resources from having URIs and effectively double the\nnumber of methods for no good reason.  Both Henrik and I argued\nagainst those methods at the time.  It really doesn&#39;t matter\nhow uniform they are because they break other aspects of the\noverall model, leading to further complications in versioning\n(WebDAV versioning is hopelessly complicated), access control\n(WebDAV ACLs are completely wrong for HTTP), and just about every\nother extension to WebDAV that has been proposed.\n\n&gt; In designing RESTful applications, I believe that one must remain\n&gt; cognizant of the implications associated with how application  \n&gt; behaviors\n&gt; are realized through HTTP. Sure, you can tunnel anything you want\n&gt; through POST, even things that have been defined as other methods,  \n&gt; but I\n&gt; think it undermines the &#39;interface genericity&#39; constraint somewhat as\n&gt; you are no longer interacting with the resource you want to, e.g.,\n&gt; delete or move, but an arbiter who then does the delete or move for  \n&gt; you.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is unclear to me why someone would advocate the use of DELETE (over\n&gt; POST as DELETE) but caution against the use of MOVE and am curious  \n&gt; as to\n&gt; your statement regarding the advisability of using WebDAV (or other?)\n&gt; methods for REST applications. Could you elaborate more on this  \n&gt; point? I\n&gt; won&#39;t discount the constraints that may be imposed by a given  \n&gt; business,\n&gt; economic or political reality, but am for more interested in  \n&gt; discussing\n&gt; the architectural and systems engineering constraints.\n\nThe problem with MOVE is that it is actually an operation on two\nindependent namespaces (the source collection and destination\ncollection).  The user must have permission to remove from the\nsource collection and add to the destination collection, which\ncan be a bit of a problem if they are in different authentication\nrealms.  COPY has a similar problem, but at least in that case\nonly one namespace is modified.  I don&#39;t think either of them map\nvery well to HTTP.\n\nTease: Any method in waka can have 0|1|2|N-arguments.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
