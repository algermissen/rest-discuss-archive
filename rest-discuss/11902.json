That&#39;s more the way I&#39;m leaning  \ncurrently.  Regardless, this exchange has motivated me enough to  \nfinally commit some of my thoughts to a wiki page entitled &quot;The  \nHypermedia Scale&quot;.\n\thttp://restpatterns.org/Articles/The_Hypermedia_Scale\n\nThe driving question behind it is that if HATEOAS is the style to  \nfollow, then how does one translate the HATEOAS principles that have  \nworked so well for human-to-machine interactions to machine-to-machine  \ninteractions?  Surprisingly, while there are multiple, established  \nhypermedia types, none are either complete or constrained enough for  \nthis use case.  Atom lacks the crucial ability to describe how to  \ncreate new entries in the presence of extensions, and HTML has so much  \nexpressive power that it&#39;s causing headaches.  It would be interesting  \nto have a discussion on how to improve on this (or, just as  \nimportantly, correct the article where it&#39;s wrong).\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; if(someFunc(uri1)) // i.e. determine the kind of the URI used\n&gt;&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   doBlah();\n&gt;&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;&gt; else if(someFunc(uri2))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   doBlahBlah();\n&gt;&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t understand this code.  Why would the client inspect the URI  \n&gt;&gt; to determine what to do? URIs are opaque and should be used as is  \n&gt;&gt; (unless the context prescribes how URI can be constructed, such as  \n&gt;&gt; URI templates or form elements).  Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve  \n&gt;&gt; never such code before, but do people really do this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Flickr style client code may look like the above. Or, take a client  \n&gt; app that is trying to work with the three photo sharing sites I  \n&gt; mentioned. Please don&#39;t read too much into the structure of the  \n&gt; code. It is the dependency I am pointing out.\n\nOk, now I get it.  The check was to determine what host the user agent  \ninteracts with, not the structure of the path.\n\nYes, sadly that will remain the reality for a while as there doesn&#39;t  \nappear to be a hypermedia type that has just the right expressive  \npower for all our RESTful services needs.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean  \n&quot;carte blanche&quot; to run off and invent completely new types. :)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in conclusion, I agree with you that the answer varies, but I\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe the outcome is not driven by the application, but its reach\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (which you may have alluded to already by stating interoperability\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and compatibility).  The more user agents there are interacting  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your API, the more driven you should be to fit it into an\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established MIME type.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Compatibility considerations do sometimes require introducing new\n&gt;&gt;&gt; media types.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is a contradiction in terms.  How can you justify introducing  \n&gt;&gt; a new media type for the purpose of compatibility?  By definition  \n&gt;&gt; nothing in the world will be compatible with it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Nope. For the same reason XHTML has a different media type than HTML.\n\nI&#39;ve read your response at least half a dozen times.  The only  \nconclusion I could draw was that you meant to say that a new media  \ntype is introduced to *break* compatibility and not preserve it, am I  \ncorrect?  Yet you begin your response by negating mine, which stated  \nthat it would not be compatible.  (confused)\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
