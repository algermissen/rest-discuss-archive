This is probably the same\nargument as &#39;should we allow rm /&#39; in unix.\n\n&gt; // ALTERNATE #3\n&gt; C: DELETE /customers/lists/42/customers/9\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n\nI don&#39;t like this.  I&#39;m not sure why.\n\n&gt; // ALTERNATE #4\n&gt; C: POST /customers/lists/42?remove=/customers/9\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n&gt;\n&gt; // ALTERNATE #5\n&gt; C: POST /customers/lists/42/remove\n&gt;  /customers/9\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n&gt;\n&gt; // ALTERNATE #6\n&gt; C: POST /customers/lists/42?remove\n&gt;  /customers/9\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n\nThese are the least RESTful in my view because they put\nthe verb of the request in the URI.  (s/remove/DELETE/)\nI would prefer to see that &#39;remove&#39; flag buried in the\nentity body rather than anywhere else.\n\nAt least these alternatives use POST which is allowed to\nhave side-effects, rather than GET, which isn&#39;t.\n\nThe only reason to use these alternatives is because of\nHTML forms, which subset HTTP and are therefore broken\nby design.  Burying the verb as a sentinel value (method=DELETE)\nin a hidden HTML form field is less evil in my opinion.\n\n&gt; // ALTERNATE #7\n&gt; C: PUT /customers/lists/42\n&gt;  /customers/2\n&gt;  /customers/3\n&gt;  /customers/5\n&gt;  /customers/7\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n\nThis is fine.  It sort of implies that the DELETE was done\nclient-side (e.g. by javascript).\n\nThe difference is its DELETing an entry, its PUTting a replacement\nlist (minus the entry) on the server.  Which may not scale as well\nas DELETing an entry for a large list.  That doesn&#39;t make it\nRESTless though.\n\n\n"}}
