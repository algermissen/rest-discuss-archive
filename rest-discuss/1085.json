If the system accepted changes to availability via\nHTTP, then a PUT to the URI might make sense - in this example,\n&#39;availability&#39; is a very synthesized entity and it probably doesn&#39;t make\nsense.\n\nThe differences between the two are fairly minor.\n\nhttp://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity?product=http://www.myi\nnventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow\n\nhttp://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/?when=tomorrow\n\nI chose not to use full a URI to indicate the product, because I felt the\nowner of the resources would have their own &#39;internal ID&#39; of the product,\nand I didn&#39;t expect them to be fully URI based for their keys - but they\ncould just as easily be URIs.\n\nI also didn&#39;t break the problem down into functions and parameters - I tried\nto break it down into addressable information entities.\nThis way it would be easy to &#39;hang new properties&#39; off of a product via the\npath segments of a URI. But that is purely a stylistic opinion - I just like\npath based rather than query string based addressing. It helps me\nconcentrate on information rather than function+parameters.\n\nSomething I&#39;m still thinking about is how a client acquires the URI to begin\nwith. Either of these two approaches could return the same data, so they are\nequivalent from that point of view - but is one easier to use from the\nclient? This gets into the &quot;hyperlink .vs. generative&quot; argument. I like the\nhyperlink approach because it has the promise of a client talking to these\ntwo different styles of URIs without knowing or caring - more loose\ncoupling. But I like the generative approach because the client may have a\nfragment of information that is not part of the name/location of the\nhyperlink that has the URI, but is actually part of the value of the URI.\n\nHere are some concrete examples that help me think about the issues. In both\ncases the text &#39;productId&#39; is a coordinating name. In both cases the client\nalso knows the value &#39;blueshoes&#39;. One difference is that the hyperlink\nexamples has to list all possible values - which might be a bit much.\n\n--hyperlink1--\n&lt;stuff&gt;\n &lt;availability\nproductId=&#39;blueshoes&#39;&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availabi\nlity/?when=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\n--hyperlink2--\n&lt;product productId=&#39;blueshoes&#39;&gt;\n\n&lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/?wh\nen=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n\n&lt;description&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/description/&lt;/des\ncription&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\n--generative1--\n&lt;stuff&gt;\n\n&lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/%productId%/availability/?\nwhen=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\n--generative2--\n&lt;stuff&gt;\n &lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/&lt;productId\n/&gt;/availability/?when=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\n\n--generative3 (not recommened, since entities scare the bunnies and break\nlots of code)--\n&lt;stuff&gt;\n\n&lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/&productId;/availability/?\nwhen=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
