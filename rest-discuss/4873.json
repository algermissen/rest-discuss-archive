Unfortunately YahooGroups seemed to be\nrather erroneous. None of my responses were sent (they&#39;re &quot;posted&quot;, but\ndon&#39;t show on the messages page), as since I posted them using the web\ninterface, I don&#39;t have any local copy :-(( I hope they&#39;re not lost. Most\nof them are quite lengthy and have good arguments.\n\nAnyways after re-evaluating REST I think my principles are a bit\ndifferent. I want to provide as much &quot;accessibility&quot;. The REST principle\nwhich uses PUT, OPTIONS, and other semantics seem not to be synchronized\nwith my goals. My views are simpler, the only methods are &quot;GET&quot; (simple\nretrieve), and &quot;POST&quot; (retrieve with additional [i.e., large]\ninformation). I also am not really fond of the idea of using more HTTP\nheaders than what&#39;s already defined, and I even think some of these\nheaders are redundant (they should also be contained in the document\nitself, such as content language and encoding). However I like the idea of\nusing HTTP status codes as response codes. Actually my web sites are\nalready implemented this way. Even though you see a simple user-friendly\nerror page, the returned error code is actually quite significant (usually\n503).\n\nSo thanks for the SHARE. Actually share.org is already available, but I\nguess it&#39;s okay. Since nobody seems to be using it then I guess I&#39;ll be\nusing it. Anyway, seems nobody ever named this &quot;Simple HTTP API&quot; I guess\nSHARE is a good name. SSDL unfortunately has been taken by SOAP SDL so I\nguess I&#39;ll use something like SHARED (SHARE Description), which is also\nnot bad. As for RIDL -&gt; SHARE IDL, I think WSDL (or an extension of it)\nwould be  sufficient.\n\nI guess this &quot;solves&quot; the problem, the solution being somewhat\nproprietary, since I am now certain that there is no such thing as &quot;SHARE&quot;\ncurrently. Even Amazon calls it RESTful. Let&#39;s call it SHARE, which is\n(IMHO) a subset of the REST concept. :-)\n\nI hope my previous responses will show up on YahooGroups though, or I&#39;ll\nbe fully pissed. The YahooGroups even reported bouncing attempts to my\ne-mail and when I revalidated my e-mail, YahooGroups gave a database\nerror. :-((\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n\n\n\n"}}
