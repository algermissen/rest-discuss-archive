Basically if you tell the client to do that, then you are\n&gt; committing to that exact naming scheme forever. For instance someone\n&gt; could make a hyperlink today to a document that will come into existence\n&gt; in 2003. On the other hand, if you put in a level of indirection between\n&gt; the resources then the client is told that you reserve the right to\n&gt; change your naming convention any time. Here&#39;s how you do that:\n&gt;\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; GET /Portfolio?asof=20020916\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020916&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020916&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then client applications dereference through that query to get at the\n&gt; concrete resource associated with a particular date.\n\nI recently noticed the Content-Location header in the HTTP.  Could this be\nused for such a purpose?  Instead of requiring redirection (which means\nadditional network traffic), you could return the expected response pluse\nthe header:\n\n--&gt;\nGET /Portfolio?asof=20020916\n\n&lt;--\n200 OK\nContent-Location: /Protfolio/20020916\n\n&lt;response-entity here&gt;\n\n\nI know this would not work for the complex query example you gave, but in\nthe case where you are querying for a single resource... maybe?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
