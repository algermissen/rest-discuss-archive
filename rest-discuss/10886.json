That I&#39;ve been using \nRuby on Rails for several years may have had some influence.\n\nFor layering sessions on top of stateless HTTP I know of two common \nways: cookies and encoding a session ID in each URL. The latter is \npotentially vulnerable to hijacking and fixation attacks. The former \nobviously requires cookies and doesn&#39;t allow two parallel sessions in \nthe same browser.\n\nI&#39;m looking for a way to have my cake and eat it: pretty and public \nURLs, no cookies or javascript required, and sessions nevertheless. And \neverything nicely RESTful, of course. I&#39;m rather certain that this is \nan impossible combination, however, I thought I&#39;d ask before giving up \nearly.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n"}}
