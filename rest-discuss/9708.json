Of course,\n&gt; the answers you already got are totally correct, and you should follow\n&gt; their direction - if you don&#39;t want URI opacity. Why you may like URI\n&gt; opacity is a separate discussion, which I&#39;d be happy to address if\n&gt; you&#39;re interested. The approach below is simply suggested to round out\n&gt; the discussion...\n\nI have heard of this cult.  I am told they are responsible for the strange \nchants and incantations heard emanating from the back room at our regular \nREST ceremonies.  It&#39;s been said if you enter that room you will never \nreturn....\n\n&gt;  (...)\n\n&gt; The results here can either be tailored to this client in some way, or\n&gt; be a cache of this specific query for everyone to use.  Further, it\n&gt; may either be updated as the possible search results change, or stay\n&gt; as a constant, eternally-cacheable snapshot. Which of these can\n&gt; perhaps be set as an additional argument in the original POST query\n&gt; body. Of course, this resource can have suitable headers sent along\n&gt; with it, optimised to these particular dynamic and/or personalised\n&gt; characteristics. You may need to avoid nervous proxy-cache behaviour\n&gt; around query URIs by chunking up your results, after all, in chunks of\n&gt; 40 with their own URIs, or, again, in chunks of a size asked for in\n&gt; the original query.\n\nYou may have answered another, related issue here that&#39;s been on my mind \nregarding personalization. The application now either: 1. retrieves any \n&quot;personalized&quot; data as a separate XMLHTTTPRequest call and updates the DOM \nwith that info (OK, so I have a cookie that holds the current user&#39;s \nusername that allows me to create a user-specific Ajax GET request -- a \nvenial REST sin, I think...), or 2. the user&#39;s username is part of the URL \niteslf and creates, essentially, a custom web application for this \nuser since all URLs include the username (I use this for the \nadministrative side where the user is &quot;logged in&quot; as an admin and re-use \nof the same queries is not as important as in the read-only view).\n\nBUT...If I include the username as a query parameter and, in essence \ncreate new resources tailored to this user, I could switch back and \nforth between personalized and non-personalized interactions fairly \neasily.  As you say, these should be POSTS (although I note that Aristotle \nsuggested in his reply to your post that GET would be OK there, at least \nfor search).  Hmmm...am I wading into dangerous waters if I start creating \nthese &quot;idempotent&quot; side-effects not for caching purposes, but for \npersonalization?  I like the idea of keeping these as GET requests since \nthat will in almost all cases be the result of clicking a link.\n\n-Peter Keane\nhttp://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pkeane/  (&lt;--brand new blog)\n\n\n&gt;  (...)\n&gt; I&#39;d also be interested to know how big this particular REST sub-cult\n&gt; is - I hope it&#39;s not just me!   =0)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;\n&gt; Duncan Cragg\n&gt;\n\n"}}
