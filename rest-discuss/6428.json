And returning consistently different representations for two\n&gt; different URI, is how a server tells the world that the URIs identify\n&gt; different resources.\n\nI agree with both of you.\n\nThe web afaik doesn&#39;t have a single agreed theory of names, perhaps \nbecause REST/HTTP aren&#39;t adequate to provide one. One basic and \ninteresting position here is to claim there is a one to one exclusive \nmapping of resources to resource identifiers (identifiers are not time \nvariant), and that we need a higher level formalism to indicate semantic \nrelations between sets of resources, (eg, same-as, family-likeness, \netc). Instead of having arguments over philosphical positions I think \nit&#39;s perfectly ok for us at the REST/HTTP/L7 level to say some things \ncannot be said. Going from a resource identifier to a resource is an \ninherently ambiguous act.\n\nSo, one can argue *perfectly well*, that all that editing a form page \ndoes is change the representation of the resource at that POSTed to URL, \nand that any change in state of any other resource denoted by another \nURL is a coincidence. Yet, people seem to get by *perfectly well*, with \nthat coincidence; many thousands of them are updating wikipedia and the \nlike right now on the basis that changing the state of one resource is \nthe way to change the state of another resource. Nothing breaks except \npeople&#39;s common sense intuitions.\n\nMachines are another matter, which is why they might need Layer 8 \nlanguages, whereas we can by on having arguments in mailing lists. To \nsignal that two URIs denote the same resource, you can use an OWL sameAs \nrelation or some such. A special case of that appears in atom protocol \nvia the edit resource. Another example is found in subversion \nbranch/copy actions, which can be seen as resource christening actions \nor statements that the resource identifiers denote the same resource but \nare each serving a subset of the entities. Such things *are* possible to \nstate outside of REST/HTTP; whether or not we agree with the statement \nis another matter.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
