They&#39;ve\n&gt;developed a bunch of APIs that they think make this happen. \n&gt;\n&gt;Said publishing house has been hired to put editorial on this\n&gt;together.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So I looked at one of AOLs offerings:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://dev.aol.com/aol_video/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt;There&#39;s a REST API!\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://dev.aol.com/aol_video/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Except this isn&#39;t REST. It isn&#39;t even HTTP for God&#39;s sake. It&#39;s just\n&gt;stupid. There are methods embedded in the URIs. Everything is done\n&gt;with GET. We were just talking about how stupid that was.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI work for AOL, and believe me I&#39;ve mentioned that this isn&#39;t a REST \nAPI.  (It&#39;s an RPC-over-http API.)  I think that for you to provide this \nfeedback to the publishing house would be good.  It&#39;s unhelpful to \nmislabel things.\n\nI&#39;d be happy to hear about specific issues that we could bring back to \nthe development team in question.  A general suggestion to use REST \nstyle interfaces could be helpful; demand from the developer community \nis important.  At the moment a big focus is on making things available \nvia in-browser JSON calls (which I just noticed they amusingly call the \n&#39;AJAX&#39; API). \n\nThe APIs are definitely incomplete and only a portion of them are \ndocumented on dev.aol.com.  Please consider it a work in progress.\n\n-John\n\n"}}
