I hope the recent changes haven&#39;t\nmessed up your work too much (change to unique URIs for each method).\n\n// I&#39;ve been putting together a few XSLT templates\n// that encapsulate calling your service in order to demonstrate some of the\n// benefits of a REST-style approach to some colleagues at work.\n\nsounds interesting - i&#39;d like to see what you&#39;ve done if i could :)\n\nin the near future, i am planning on allowing the XML output to include a\nref to an XSL, probably by just including t=http://your.xsl in the request\n(URL-encoded of course). this shouldn&#39;t affect any existing use of XooMLe as\nit will just not include any reference to it if not requested.\n\n// Both the Amazon and Google template use the XSLT document() function in\n// order to call the service and obtain results.  I&#39;m not sure how that\n// function\n// would react to an HTTP Authentication request, so I would ask\n// that you allow\n// keys to be used in the query for the time being.\n\nas far as the keys go, my plan is this;\n\n1. XooMLe will look for &key=GoogleAPIKey in the request,\n2. if that&#39;s not found, it will also check for the key value using a 401\nHeader (HTTP Auth Required) which could potentially be sent in the form\nhttp://key:GoogleAPIKey@.../search/ (username will\nbe &quot;key&quot;, password will be your key). Apart from that, you can use whatever\nHTTP Authentication manager you have access to depending on the language\nbeing used.\n\nHope that works out for you ;)\n\n// I&#39;d be happy to share this work with anyone that is interested;\n// just send me\n// an\n// email. Thanks again.\n\nI&#39;d like to see what you&#39;ve done!\n\n\n"}}
