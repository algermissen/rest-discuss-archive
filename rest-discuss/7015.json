I have since come to accept that it was wrong; forgive me\n&gt; for I have sinned. ;)\n\nThe basic idea is solid and sending links around is absolutely one of\nthe greatest benefits afforded a system based on hypermedia...\n\n&gt; But I would still like to explore the concept to fully understand\n&gt; how to achieve &quot;correctness&quot; and also the same levels of usability\n&gt; that I had being able to email the links.  So here are my questions:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1.) Revisiting my design; it *is* idempotent; i.e. it doesn&#39;t add a\n&gt; new item to the cart with multiple GETS as I incorporated logic to\n&gt; ensure it only added one. It was also &quot;safe&quot; in a manner of\n&gt; speaking; adding to the cart did not obligate a person to buy but it\n&gt; did leave an item in the shopping cart (making it impossible for us\n&gt; to truly understand abandon rates; can you tell we didn&#39;t pay\n&gt; attention to that metric?)\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2.) What if there was a url I could have emailed to customers that\n&gt; instead took them to a screen that asked them to click a button on a\n&gt; form that used POST to add the identified item into the shopping\n&gt; cart?  That would be more RESTful then?\n\nYou got it.\n\n&gt; Obviously I don&#39;t need this anymore since I&#39;m not part of that\n&gt; company, but I&#39;ve often pondered that design since GWA.\n\nThis is such a frequent design technique that I&#39;d be surprised if you\ndidn&#39;t need it at some other point in time.\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n"}}
