You&#39;ve POSTed a tin-of-beans \nreasource to a shopping-list resource, which resulted in the \nshopping-list resource being altered.\n\nYou should return a 200 with a representation of the shopping-list \nresource. The shopping-list&#39;s representation should most likely contain \nthe list of URIs of the resources contained in some sort of hypertext \nformat (hence the items should be linked to with HTML href attributes, \nRDF rdf:resource attributes or similar) in a document format which \nexplains the purpose for the links at an appropriate level (e.g. \nhuman-readable if HTML, defined relationships between list and item if RDF).\n\n"}}
