A GET should not have side\neffects that are detectable to the requester. If you are keeping\naudit information it should not be stored with the items being\ntracked.\n\nThe access log for an HTTP server is a good analogy. The resources\nbeing accessed are not aware that the log exists but if you know\nwhere to look you can get a list of all the requests made to the server.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n\n"}}
