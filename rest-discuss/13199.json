But I might have overlooked it.\n&gt; If you consider it acceptable: which status code would you return to  \n&gt; a client that did not provide an appropriate header? Well certainly  \n&gt; one of the 4xx errors, but I&#39;m not sure which to choose in particular.\n\nIncidently I asked the same thing a while ago and it has been  \nsuggested to use 412 Precondition Failed + explanatory text.\n\nSounded like the best idea.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Julian Reich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
