I thought those were only supposed\n&gt;    Karen&gt; to determine whether or not the page was served, not what the\n&gt;    Karen&gt; content thereof was.\n&gt;\n&gt;Interesting point. Not sure what the authoritative answer is, but it\n&gt;looks to me that can&#39;t be true. You would never be able to say &quot;Welcome\n&gt;Karen&quot;, based on authentication.\n&gt;\n\nSure you can, provided you send a &quot;Vary: Authorization&quot; header with the \nresponse.  If the user is not authenticated, the representation which \ncorresponds to no Authorization header can say &quot;Welcome Stranger&quot;.  The \nno-auth representation would set cache-control: public, while Karen&#39;s \npersonalized represenatation would set cache-control: private.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
