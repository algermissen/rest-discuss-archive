Certainly the integration \n&gt; complexity is reduced. But OTOH the effort of reaching agreement on \nthe \n&gt; common interface is increased.\n\nMiles, your opinion is really interesting and I agree with it from \none angle, but disagree from another angle.\n\n&gt; Just to spell this out a bit more, with multiple point-to-point \n&gt; interfaces only two parties need to agree on any particular \ninterface, \n&gt; whereas all N have to agree on the common interface. \n\nThat&#39;s true, but the actual practice since the early days of EDI says \nit&#39;s best to have a combination of aspects that are standardized and \naspects are negotiated between each pair of trading partners.  \n\nThe more aspects that are standardized, the easier it is to negotiate \nthe operational interface between trading partners.\n\nPlus, each trading partner usually has many other partners. So unless \nyou want a different interface for each of your trading partners, the \nforces for uniform interface remain in play, even locally.\n\n&gt; I guess that you know as well as I do that agreements are fraught, \n&gt; messy, political and expensive. I take that as a hint that reducing \n&gt; that element of the _total_ cost is likely to be a win.\n\nThat still says to me, standardize as many aspects as possible, but \nkeep the scope of each detailed trading contract as small as possible \n(e.g. two parties per).\n\n&gt; OTOH, on the common interface model every change requires global \n&gt; renegotiation and reimplementation; \n\nThat assumes everything is standardized and mandatory, doesn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt; and new particpants either have to \n&gt; get along with what the first-movers already decided on whether or \nnot \n&gt; it&#39;s fully appropriate for them, or alternatively simply not become \n&gt; participants at all (or become participants in something else). \nAnd, \n&gt; again FWIW, I&#39;ve seen data from several B2B exchanges that this \nlast \n&gt; problem is a real one ... they have a tough time signing up anyone \n&gt; beyond the initial consortia.\n\nThere&#39;s a lot more to the B2B exchanges problems than common \ninterfaces.  In fact, the major B2B exchanges I know about are all \ninvolved in efforts to create global uniform standards.  (I don&#39;t \nthink interfaces have anything to do with their business problems, by \nthe way, so standards won&#39;t help them either.)\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
