So in your case the best approach would\n&gt; b=\r\ne to return 200 and put a representation with a link to the new\n&gt; address i=\r\nn the response body.\n&gt;\n\nGood.\n\n&gt; &gt; That would be: I have a resource &quot;budget=\r\n&quot;, and to &quot;approve&quot; it\n&gt; &gt; I send its representation via PUT to /budgets/ap=\r\nproved/{id},\n&gt; &gt; where the ID is the one of the original resource?\n&gt;\n&gt; No, =\r\nthat would mean you want to store the representation of that\n&gt; budget in /b=\r\nudgets/approved/{id} =96 which isn=92t what you=92re after.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rather, you=\r\n would PUT a body like &lt;approval&gt;approved&lt;/approval&gt;\n&gt; to /budgets/{id}/app=\r\nroved.\n&gt;\n\nAhhh, it starts to take shape. Thanks so much!\n\nSo, in that solut=\r\nion /budgets/{id}/approved becomes a resource. That  \ncould be a RW atrribu=\r\nte just fine. Would it make sense to publish that  \nas a write-only resourc=\r\ne? I mean, the service is the one who decides  \nwhat to publish as GETable =\r\nand what not right? Or does REST assume all  \nresources are GETable (modulu=\r\ns authorization)?\n\nEven if the flag is not PUTable via /budgets/{id} would =\r\nit be OK to  \ninclude it as an attribute in the representation of a budget?=\r\n Would  \nyou as a client expect it as a nested resource with its own link, =\r\nor  \nwould it be OK to have it as a plain boolean attribute? Or would you  =\r\n\nrequire an additional request to /budgets/{id}/approved? I start to  \nhave=\r\n answers to those questions but would like to validate them.\n\nAs far as RES=\r\nTfulness is concerned would be OK to send a boolean  \n(string &quot;true&quot;) to /b=\r\nudgets/{id}/approved instead of that &quot;approved&quot;?\n\n&gt; (Actually, you would PU=\r\nT it to whichever approval URI the\n&gt; resource at /budgets/{id} links to. Th=\r\ne client doesn=92t\n&gt; spontaneously construct URIs, it only follows links an=\r\nd forms.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#39;t be a RESTful way to express this RPC-style action\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Set the approved flag of budget with URL foo to &quot;approved&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n? That is you pass the URL, not the representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; That would work as =\r\nwell =96 POST &lt;budget href=3D&quot;/budget/{id}&quot;/&gt; to\n&gt; /approved_budgets. Or bu=\r\ndget_uri=3D/budget/{id} I suppose. (Query\n&gt; string format.)\n&gt;\n\nIn that appr=\r\noach I would get a 201 with a Location, and a GET for that  \nnew resource w=\r\nould give the same representation I send? That is, a  \nlink, not &quot;a budget&quot;=\r\n?\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
