Ignoring the so-called dogma for the moment,\n&gt; &gt; here&#39;s a couple of very practical concerns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First, internationalization.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s no more or less a problem here than it is in agreeing on XML tag name\n&gt; choices in &quot;standardized&quot; schemas, etc., and then dealing with\n&gt; transformations between language representations of tag name choices.\n\nI think it is substantially different.  Representations can be\ntransformed willy nilly with no implication, but names cannot.\n\n&gt; &gt; You need a layer\n&gt; &gt; of indirection here, something to assert &quot;this URI is of this type&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; As mentioned, the semantic information about what particular name elements\n&gt; needs to be represented elsewhere.  I&#39;ll go further:  not only do complete\n&gt; URI need to be typed, but their parts need to be typed.\n\n&quot;need&quot; as in &quot;must&quot;?  If so, you&#39;re placing quite a burden on namespace\nowners.  I should be able to create http://foo.org/a/b/c/d/e/f/g without\nany worry that people will assume certain things about that means, which\nmay place additional obligations on me as webmaster.\n\n&gt; &gt; Second, if my namespace already includes a &quot;/help&quot; - perhaps I use it\n&gt; &gt; as the name for my &quot;happy elves love partying&quot; resource - does that mean\n&gt; &gt; that I can&#39;t use the help/contact/search system?\n&gt; \n&gt; Good question.  The answer at first seems to be yes, and this seems to be a\n&gt; weakness.  The mechanism for avoiding this problem is the same as it is in\n&gt; XML:  introduce namespaces inside URI components to avoid collision.  But we\n&gt; don&#39;t even have to do anything to introduce those;  the &#39;;&#39; property space\n&gt; does our job for us.  Instead of namestd:help you have help;namestd or what\n&gt; have you.\n\nURI parameters have no global meaning, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
