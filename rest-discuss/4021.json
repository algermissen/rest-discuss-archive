You should clarify one aspect of it, though.\n: &gt; Do you mean that (say, over a given time period) GET(URI1) *always*\n: &gt; yields Representation1, and likewise for URI2/Representation2?\n: &gt; Or do you  mean that via observation, we have just seen the scenario\n: &gt; below played out once?\n:\n: Well, to keep it simple(?), let&#39;s stick to the &quot;always&quot; scenario.\n\nMy take is that two identifiers that consistently yield different\nrepresentations, sans any other meta-data affecting the format\nof representation requested, identify different things.\n:\n: &gt; You are asking questions of the nature What may two people claim?\n: &gt; and What allows knowledge?  Are these the questions you mean to\n: &gt; ask, or do you mean to ask questions about the constraints in REST?\n:\n: Well, a bit of both, really.  The first bit has to do with whether a\nsingle\n: client can know the commonality of two URIs that point to the same\nresource.\n: For example, there is this resource somewhere and it has two URIs\n: referencing it.  How can a client assert that these two URIs reference a\n: single resource?  It seems to me that the answer is you can&#39;t necessarily\n: know.  It is possible, though, that the semantics of a particular\n: representation (e.g. RDF document) could allow such understanding, but\nthat\n: would be specific to that resource and not generally applicable to all\n: resources.  In other words, each resource would have to explicitly tell\nthe\n: client in a potentially proprietary way of the relationship of its URIs.\n: But there isn&#39;t anything at a more generic level (say HTTP, for instance)\n: that allows this to be known.\n\nMaybe no strict format for it called out in HTTP, but HTTP is hypertext\ntransfer protocol, and hypertext is a suitable medium for setting\nexpectations of the kind described above, isn&#39;t it?\n\n:\n: The other part is whether it is possible for two clients to assert that\nthey\n: talking about the same single resource if neither of them share an\n: identifier (URI).  It seems to me that they cannot.  Period.  Which gets\nme\n: back to the first question... if a single client does not have a mechanism\n: to find that two different URIs are of the same resource, then it is in\nthe\n: same seat as the two clients that do not share a resource.\n\nYou mean two clients are having a conversation; they think they&#39;re\ntalking about the same resource, but when they exchange identifiers, it\nturns out that client A&#39;s identifiers are disjoint from client B&#39;s\nidentifiers?\nSo then, they can&#39;t know they&#39;re talking about the same resouce; and\nyet they seem to be?\n\nWell, you puzzle it out, but if two parties agree that they are talking\nabout a single thing, there&#39;s at least one identifier in that picture.\nMaybe\nit&#39;s just not a URI.\n\nWhat is your goal in these questions?\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n"}}
