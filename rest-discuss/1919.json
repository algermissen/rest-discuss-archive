But clearly the Web benefitted from having such a\nsimple MEP to start with since it hid some complexity from developers\n(e.g. request/response correlation).  However, that doesn&#39;t mean it\nrequires one.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
