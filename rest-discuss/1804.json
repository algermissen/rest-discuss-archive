I agree that it may be a weak argument, but I am pretty sure IIS\n(and possibly other HTTP servers) takes advantage of this internally.  Also,\npeople tend to use the tools available if they think it will help.  It is\nhighly foreseeable that a server application would take advantage of the\npersistent connection to maintain state.  I am not saying that someone who\nis mindful of REST would do such a thing.  All I was saying was that HTTP\n1.1 contains additional features over HTTP 1.0 that are less RESTful in\nnature.\n\nAnother argument is that persistent connections potentially do not scale\nwell.  Yes, a persistent connection does reduce network traffic and latency,\nbut it also means that a given server can handle fewer connections over a\nperiod of time, especially if the clients and the server are keeping the\nconnections open, but are otherwise idle.\n\n\nAs for another example of a part of HTTP 1.1 I feel is not RESTful (in my\nmind):  the If-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Range, and\nIf-Unmodified-Since header fields (14.24-28).  From my understanding of\nthese fields, the client is effectively telling the server how to act.  I\nwas under the impression that a client could submit a representation of a\nresource to the server, but the client has no control over what the server\nactually does with the resource.  Likewise, I thought that the client has no\ncontrol over the representation of the resource returned to it.  However,\nthese header fields appear to give the client some control over how the\nserver receives and returns representations of resources.\n\nOf course, since I am still figuring out what REST really is, I fully admit\nthat I may also be viewing all of this incorrectly...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Philip Eskelin&quot; &lt;philip@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;&#39;Seairth Jacobs&#39;&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;&#39;rest-discuss&#39;&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 11:29 PM\nSubject: RE: [PMX:#] [rest-discuss] REST and HTTP\n\n\n&gt; Monday, July 08, 2002 9:40 PM, Seairth wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I agree that HTTP has taken on a lot more over the years.
