It might be necessary for clients and servers to\nexchange additional out-=\r\nof-band information on the proper way to form\nthe message for a particular =\r\nmedia type (element names, order, etc.),\nbut that descriptive information i=\r\ns something else.\n\nFinally, the details of the entity body are only interes=\r\nting to the\ntwo parties involved in the message (sender, receiver). From th=\r\ne\nintermediaries POV, they need to no nothing about this body - in fact\nsho=\r\nuld not be peeking into the body at all.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nOn Thu, Oct 29, 2009 at 09:34, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; On thing that keeps bugging me....\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I have an order acce=\r\npting resource /order-processor-a and the\n&gt; client has discovered that it a=\r\nccepts application/order+xml (assuming\n&gt; the type being a standard type). O=\r\nrder submissions would be done with\n&gt;\n&gt; (Case A:)\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /order-processor=\r\n-a\n&gt; Content-Type: application/order+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;order&gt;\n&gt; =A0 &lt;item&gt;A&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n =A0 &lt;item&gt;B&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now suppose I had another order processo=\r\nr that accepts submission of\n&gt; orders in the form of form data, e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n(Case B:)\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /order-processor-b\n&gt; Content-Type: application/x-www-for=\r\nm-urlencoded\n&gt;\n&gt; item=3DA&item=3DB\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Isn&#39;t case B violating REST&#39;s mess=\r\nage self descriptiveness constraint\n&gt; because the meaning of the message de=\r\npends on the knowledge that the\n&gt; recipient is an order processor? IOW, an =\r\nobserver could only figure\n&gt; out the meaning if it knew the past interactio=\r\nns and not form the\n&gt; message itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is application/x-www-form-urlenco=\r\nded as bad a choice as application/\n&gt; xml? In fact, is any general media ty=\r\npe (e.g. text/uri-list) a\n&gt; violation of the message self descriptiveness c=\r\nonstraint?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
