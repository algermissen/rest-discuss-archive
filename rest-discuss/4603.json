The latter would map to HTTP POST with a header\n&gt; &gt; (mandatory, due to deployment issues) declaring that the expected\n&gt; &gt; role/type of the resource identified by the Request-URI, is that of a\n&gt; &gt; book order processor.\n&gt;\n&gt; But Amazon does not include such a mandatory header in\n&gt; their POST. Are you saying that Amazon&#39;s service is not RESTful?\nI wouldn&#39;t be suprised. Amazon isn&#39;t that religious (or even particularly\nwell informed) about REST. I&#39;ve only met two or three people that\nunderstand - much less care deeply - about REST. I have met people that\nquickly recognize the value when I explain the basics, though. Amazon is\nfull of very smart & quick people.\n\nThis long running discussion of &#39;what is RESTful&#39; helped clarify my\nconfusion surrounding &#39;hypertext as the engine of application state&#39;. When I\nrealized what that might mean - separation of expectations from strictly\nmethod+uri - I was struck by the similar realization many people have when\nthey first understand the separation of uri and method in HTTP. Many people\nreally don&#39;t know that HTTP has GET and POST along with other methods & that\nthose methods have /meaning/ (at the protocol/contract level). This adds\nanother level of richness to REST application design. Very cool.\n\n\n\n"}}
