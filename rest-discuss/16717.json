The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; constraint in question is the embodiment of the decision to expand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MIME from e-mail to become *the* tagging-and-bagging spec for IP\n&gt; &gt;&gt; network protocols. Chapter 6 extensively covers the topic of REST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mismatches in HTTP, without mentioning the IANA registry...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why would that be a mismatch?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re missing the point; the argument has been that centralised\n&gt; &gt; registration is _not a requirement_ for REST. Shared understanding\n&gt; &gt; is the requirement, which can be achieved via other means than a\n&gt; &gt; central registry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shared understanding is the requirement...\n&gt;\n\nThis statement is accurate, but imprecise.  REST requires that the\nshared understanding be network-based.  If the shared understanding\nisn&#39;t network-based, it&#39;s library-based.  REST defines the difference\nas the self-descriptive messaging constraint, defining uniform to mean\nstandardized and network-based.  Which is exactly what your post goes\non to explain...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The only way to prevent this conflict at an architectural or transfer \n&gt; protocol level is to define a set of content type labels and a method \n&gt; for components to share which of the set they understand, for\n&gt; instance the Content-Type and Accept headers in the hypertext\n&gt; transfer protocol.\n&gt; \n\n+1\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to understand content typed with a specific label, then a \n&gt; specification for that content type must be known, and given that\n&gt; some content type outwith the set could also share the same name, or\n&gt; that two content types within the set could share similar ambiguous\n&gt; names, then the only way to prevent conflict here is to store a\n&gt; reference to the content type specification along with the label for\n&gt; that content type, within the defined set.\n&gt; \n\nExactly like how domain name lookups work on IP by using the root name\nservers to define a distributed registry.  You can use any domain name\nyou want on your LAN, but the shared understanding won&#39;t be network-\nbased, i.e. you can&#39;t extend your API over the Internet that way,\nbecause it isn&#39;t an Internet domain name unless it&#39;s duly registered.\n\nIt isn&#39;t in-scope for HTTP to define any other mechanism for domain\nname lookups, HTTP refers to URI which specifies DNS for IP networks.\nIt also isn&#39;t in-scope for HTTP to spec any other mechanism for\nunderstanding Content-Type headers aside from the IANA registry.  Wrong\nlayer entirely.\n\nUnregistered identifiers can&#39;t be forbidden, because that would prevent\nnew media types from evolving.  HTTP discourages persistent use of x\nidentifiers, in favor of re-using media types or registering new ones.\nAll HTTP is doing there, is defining a profile of the existing rules of\nthe underlying network:\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521#section-4\n\nThis is quite clear that unless you&#39;re using a string that&#39;s defined in\nthe IANA registry, you must use x- (which has been obsoleted by x.) so\nas not to confuse anyone into thinking it&#39;s a standardized Internet\nMedia Type.\n\nIf HTTP doesn&#39;t override the network-based shared understanding of the\nContent-Type header, how do you justify doing this at an even higher\nlevel, i.e. in your HTTP API, and claiming it&#39;s network-based,\nparticularly when REST defines media type as RFC 2048, further\nconfirmed by Roy&#39;s clarification that self-descriptive = registered (at\nthe minimum)?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Bringing it back to the real world, *the shared understanding of\n&gt; content type labels already exists* at an architectural level, we\n&gt; call the labels &quot;Internet Media Types&quot;, they have a registry at IANA,\n&gt; and a well defined registration process, these aren&#39;t just transfer\n&gt; protocol specific, they are a shared understanding at the Internet\n&gt; Layer, which is two layers below any transfer protocol.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is why the transfer protocols you use on a daily basis, like\n&gt; SMTP, FTP and HTTP all use internet media types.\n&gt; \n\nJust like how they all re-use URI and DNS.  Part of IP.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, to meet the shared understanding constraint and not\n&gt; use IANA registered media types you would not only have to go lower\n&gt; than (HTTP/DNS etc), but you&#39;d have to lower than the transport layer \n&gt; (tcp/udp etc), and even lower still, somewhere below the internet\n&gt; layer (IPv4, IPv6 etc) and start from scratch tbh, define a new \n&gt; internet-like-thing which isn&#39;t the internet and doesn&#39;t use any of\n&gt; the internet stack, components or protocols.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or am I missing the point too?\n&gt; \n\nI think your posts in this discussion since joining the group, have\nexponentially increased my understanding of the point I&#39;ve been trying\nto make for a year now.  My conclusions were correct, but my rationale\nwas off.  Thinking of the IANA registry being as critical as DNS to the\noperations of network protocols in general, further confirms REST&#39;s\nrationale in considering it critical to any uniform interface style for\nIP networking.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
