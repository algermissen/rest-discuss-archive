Mark then asks for\n&gt; clarification [which] Roy provides:\n&gt; \n\nBy explaining the difference between the REST style and the Web\ninstantiation of REST.  Mark&#39;s comments, given in the context of\nfeedback for an HTTP API on the Internet, were being misconstrued as\ntruisms of the style itself.  Roy _isn&#39;t_ calling this wrong:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6569\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately I think we are seeing evidence in this thread of what\n&gt; Roy said here: &quot;This is one of those gray areas of increasing\n&gt; RESTfulness that will doubtless drive some people nuts.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nYes, I&#39;ve been thinking about that, and would like to retract my prior\nstatement that Roy&#39;s being contradictory with his other statements\nabout there not being any degrees of REST -- you either meet the\nconstraints or you don&#39;t.\n\nAn approved-standard type with a registered identifier meets the self-\ndescriptive messaging constraint for HTTP on the Internet.  How RESTful\nthe result is, depends on the proliferation of the standard -- due to\nthe nature of REST as a network-based API, not a library-based API.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think both sides are making good points but there is no simple\n&gt; black and white answer.\n&gt; \n\nThere is a black-and-white answer, and a gray area, for RESTful HTTP on\nthe Internet.  The truism is that Content-Type MUST contain an IANA-\nregistered identifier that points to an *approved* standard.  Even a\n&quot;Rand Paul&quot; standard... he&#39;s the politician who&#39;s also a board-certified\nopthalmologist -- but only by his own certification board, which has\nonly ever certified him... nice work if you can get it...\n\nThe gray area is a function of uptake, i.e. ubiquity.  Early adopters\nof Atom weren&#39;t violating the self-descriptive messaging constraint.\nThese implementations have, over time and without needing to be changed,\nbecome one helluva lot more RESTful than they were initially.\n\nWhy?  Because the proliferation of Atom is what makes the interface\nuniform, over and above just being a standard.  Nowadays, standard\nAtom libraries abound, it&#39;s in all the browsers that matter, there are\nfeed readers and aggregation services -- all those things we call\n&quot;network effects&quot; which drive the serendipitous re-use and anarchic\nscalability we&#39;re presumably trying to harness with pragmatic REST\ndevelopment.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
