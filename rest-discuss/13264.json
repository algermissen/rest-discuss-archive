I&#39;ve been on their case \n&gt; &lt;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltacloud-devel/2009-September/000138.html&gt; about \n&gt; the governance and have had some useful \n&gt; &lt;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltacloud-devel/2009-September/000145.html&gt; and \n&gt; some less \n&gt; &lt;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltacloud-devel/2009-September/000142.html&gt; \n&gt; useful \n&gt; &lt;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltacloud-devel/2009-September/000147.html&gt; responses \n&gt; from Red Hat about it. I find this kind of wording \n&gt; &lt;http://www.jboss.org/reststar/community/governance.html&gt; particularly \n&gt; disconcerting, and straight out of the WS-* era:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Red Hat, as the founder of REST-*, gets a permanent seat on the\n&gt;     board. All other board members must be elected by the overall\n&gt;     membership once a year.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nIf this is all you are concerned about, then I&#39;m pretty happy.  If you \nread the website you&#39;ll see that we are very open to changing any part \nof the governance model.\n\n\n&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that this article \n&gt; &lt;http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/03/12/020312hnwsi.html&gt; has \n&gt; vanished as it gave great coverage of the governance shenanigans that \n&gt; plagued WS-*, but basically until such time as this looks like something \n&gt; other than a lone vendor&#39;s attempt to own some standards I&#39;m not giving \n&gt; it the time of day (despite the concept itself being sound).\n&gt;\n\nThe organization is going to be run as an open source project.  IP will \nbe licensed under ASL 2.0.  Anybody can participate in discussions.\n\nAs I said on my blog, Red Hat (and JBoss) has a pretty good history of \nrunning open communities and projects.  When they&#39;ve become popular \nwe&#39;ve brought them to a standardization effort so that all can share in \nthe IP.  With this effort we&#39;re going to be both the project and the \nstandards body.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
