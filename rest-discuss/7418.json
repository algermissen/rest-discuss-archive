Therefore:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://myserver/host/blueprints/\n&gt;&gt; MindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService?dream.out.format=jsonp\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does not retrieve a different format of the resource at:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET http://myserver/host/blueprints/\n&gt;&gt; MindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It retrieves a different resource. In other words, my understanding\n&gt;&gt; of the HTTP spec&#39;s use of the term &quot;resource,&quot; and also Roy&#39;s use of\n&gt;&gt; it in his thesis, gives no special meaning to a question mark in a  \n&gt;&gt; URI.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I do exactly what you are describing, because the user trying to\n&gt;&gt; figure out our information architecture from the URIs may indeed\n&gt;&gt; apply special meaning to that question mark. (In my model for URI\n&gt;&gt; design, the part of the URI left of the question mark defines a\n&gt;&gt; conceptual thing from the user&#39;s perspective, but not a resource from\n&gt;&gt; the HTTP or REST perspective.) So I think it makes sense to do what\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re doing from a usability perspective, but my feeling is your\n&gt;&gt; article may be inaccurate when it says you can apply query parameters\n&gt;&gt; to a URI to get a subset or different format for a single resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following your point.  Are you saying I could express\n&gt; it better without using the term &#39;resource&#39;?  But what should it be\n&gt; called then?\n\nYes, since you&#39;re attempting to explain REST, and the term &quot;resource&quot;  \nI think means in REST what it means in HTTP, which is very specific.  \nI CC&#39;d the list because I wasn&#39;t 100% sure of that, so see if anyone  \nhas a different definition of &quot;resource&quot; in the HTTP and/or REST  \ncontext.\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s look at the following use case (for Dream):\n&gt; 1) we have a URI that points to an XML document (e.g.\n&gt; http://server/recipes)\n&gt; 2) doing a GET on this URI gives us the document verbatim\n&gt; 3) doing a GET?dream.out.format=jsonp gives us the document in a\n&gt; different representation (sending &#39;Accept: application/json,\n&gt; text/javascript&#39; should trigger the same conversion)\n&gt; 4) doing a GET?dream.out.select=/list/entry[author=&#39;Julia Child&#39;]\n&gt; gives us the XML sub-document that matches the xpath expression\n&gt;\n&gt; I would say that #2-#4 all refer to the same &quot;resource&quot;, but chose to\n&gt; represent it in different ways.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understood you correctly, you are stating the\n&gt; &quot;http://server/recipes&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;http://server/recipies?dream.out.format=jsonp&quot; identify two different\n&gt; resources, because they are different URIs.  Is that correct?  And if\n&gt; yes, is there a less strict interpretation that would weaken this\n&gt; equality relationship to only apply to the scheme, authority, and path\n&gt; components of the URI (i.e. excluding user name, password, path\n&gt; parameters, query parameters, and fragment)?  I think such an equality\n&gt; relationship would be useful and feel intuitive.  And would certainly\n&gt; be deserving of a name by which it could be referred to.\n&gt;\nI agree. Our URIs in our new architecture do a similar thing. But I  \ndon&#39;t call them &quot;resources.&quot; I call them whatever they are: article,  \nforum post, etc. I also do the &quot;container&quot; pattern a lot as you named  \nit. You could call these things (for lack of a better word) resources  \nif you want, but it seems like overloading the term in an article  \ntrying to explain REST. You might try coming up with a better name  \nthan &quot;thing&quot; that isn&#39;t &quot;resource.&quot;\n\nOn the other hand, I&#39;m not really sure it&#39;s an article about REST if  \nyou&#39;re going in that direction. It may be more an article about user- \nfriendly web information architecture and URI design. At least that&#39;s  \nhow I think of those patterns you described, that the URI to the left  \nof the question mark defines one &quot;thing&quot; in the *user&#39;s* mental model  \nof your website. The stuff to the right of the question mark the user  \ncan think of as stuff that customizes their view of the &quot;thing.&quot; But  \nthose different URIs giving views of the same &quot;thing&quot; are not  \nrepresentations of resources in the HTTP terminology, which is where  \nI believe REST lives. In that worldview each different URI is a  \ndifferent &quot;resource&quot; that may have multiple &quot;representations.&quot;\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles\n\nIs a view of the collection of articles that shows the most recently  \npublished 15 articles.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?p=7\n\nShows page seven of the same list, the collection of articles shown  \nin most-recently-published order. Here the &quot;thing&quot; in the user&#39;s mind  \nis the collection of articles. But from the HTTP perspective, from my  \nreading of the spec, these are two distinct resources each of which  \ncould have multiple representations, not two representations of the  \nsame resource.\n\nAnyway, my feefback is simply to be very clear on the terms in your  \narticle, and since it is an article attempting to explain REST, try  \nto use &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;representation&quot; as it is used in the HTTP spec  \nand Roy&#39;s paper. (And I welcome clarification from others if I&#39;m not  \nunderstanding these terms correctly.)\n\nBill\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - Steve\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Steve G.
