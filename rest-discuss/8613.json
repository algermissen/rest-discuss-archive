When you \nenable GZip, you double the number of representations available.  Each \nvariant now comes in two versions, inflated and deflated.  After you decode \nthe deflated version, it is bit-for-bit identical to the inflated version.\n\nSo the ETag is the same either way, even if it&#39;s a weak validator.  If an \nintermediary has cached foo.html in gzipped form, then a request comes in \nfrom a user-agent which doesn&#39;t support gzip, the intermediary is free to \ndeflate and serve foo.html to the client if the server validates the \nrequest, because the only variance is the Content-Encoding request header.\n\nIf you&#39;re sending a weak validator then the intermediary is free to deflate \nand serve foo.html to the client, even if the server has a more up-to-date, \ndeflated version of foo.html available.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
