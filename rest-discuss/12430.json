The approach of using mediatypes for\n&gt; versi=\r\noning has two massive drawbacks:\n&gt; 1. Multiplication of media types\n\nHow is=\r\n this a problem?\n  \n&gt; 2. Side-by-side approach to building formats\n\nThis me=\r\nchanism can also be used to explicitly deprecate obsolete API versions.  I =\r\nwouldn&#39;t suggest that people have multiple formats just for fun.  But if ex=\r\nisting application semantics change sufficiently separate formats are much =\r\nsimpler and cleaner than the alternatives.  \n\n\n&gt; I think it sends the wrong=\r\n message. You can and should do versioning inside\n&gt; an existing media type,=\r\n provided you accounted for this by not unreasonably\n&gt; limiting your option=\r\ns (for example by restricting yourself to a closed xsd).\n\nBy &quot;an existing m=\r\nime type&quot; do you mean something like &quot;application/json&quot; or something like &quot;=\r\napplication/vnd.myapp+json&quot;.  The former is poor choice because it requires=\r\n an out-of-band agreement between the client and server about exactly what =\r\nflavor of JSON document the server will return.  Not just any JSON document=\r\n will do for the client but that fact is not made explicit.  \n\nThe latter w=\r\nould work.  However, it assumes that you are never going to change the appl=\r\nication semantics in any incompatible way.  I am not comfortable assumption=\r\ns that an application is going to be designed correctly the first time.\n\n&gt; =\r\nPlus, it&#39;s not gonna be simple. It&#39;s like argueing that having all the\n&gt; fl=\r\navours of RSS and ATOM to support is better to support extensibility. If\n&gt; =\r\nyou have to create a new version, you&#39;ve already accepted there&#39;s a fatal\n&gt;=\r\n flaw in your current format.\n\nIndeed.  Supporting obsolescent formats/API =\r\nversions is hard and annoying.  However, it can be very useful even when th=\r\ne obsolescent formats are fatally flawed.  The parallel support of both for=\r\nmats allows clients to be transitioned to the new API one at a time, rather=\r\n than all at once.  This extra runway can be crucial for small teams workin=\r\ng on large systems.  Or for systems where the clients are outside of the di=\r\nrect control of the API developers.\n\n--\nPeter\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
