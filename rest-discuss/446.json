This is probably do-able with minimal\n&gt; impact on the existing Web architecture.\n\nHmm.  Interesting.  Can you expand on that?  Does\nit solve the problem of failover servers/load\nbalancing?\n\n&gt; There&#39;s a large amount of\n&gt; current work going on along these lines relative to distributed\n&gt; filesystems, filesharing, p2p and decentralized systems.  It would be\n&gt; nice to see a principled design for such functionality available for\n&gt; general use within the Web community.\n\nYes thats true, but it seems to focus on\nidentifying documents not resources.  These are\ndifferent.\n\nThe most obvious replacement for names is google&#39;s\n&quot;I feel lucky&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it is really\nwhat you want in a protocol.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
