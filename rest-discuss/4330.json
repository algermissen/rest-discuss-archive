I have questions about how you&#39;re doing\n&gt; that:\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you describing the behavior of an HTTP resource with RDF?\n\nNo, I&#39;m describing the state.\n\n&gt; Are you describing the relationships between HTTP resources with RDF?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Are you using HTTP resource identifiers as subjects in your RDF?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; If so, do the resource identifiers have an rdf:type?\n\nWell, the resource, not the identifier, is what rdf:type refers to, but\nyes.\n\n&gt; Is there a difference between an RDF resource and an HTTP resource?\n\nNo, because there&#39;s no such thing as either of those; there are\nresources, period.\n\n&gt; Is it significant that owl:sameAs is defined over &quot;individuals&quot;\n&gt; (instances of owl:Thing) instead of over &quot;resources&quot;?\n\nNo.  Same thing.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
