Similarly, from the POV of\nthis thread, if a server non-idempotently &quot;versions&quot; a resource on a\nPUT, the client isn&#39;t requesting that action, the server just decided\nto do it, and therefore it&#39;s not a violation of PUT semantics ... as\nlong as the server also sets the state of the targetted resource to\nthat represented in the request, of course.\n\nI&#39;ve understood this distinction for some time, but it still catches\nme on occasion...\n\nMark.\n\nOn 1/2/07, Walden Mathews &lt;waldenm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In 2616*, I interpret &quot;side effects&quot; to mean resource state changes,\n&gt; as opposed to values returned in the response.
