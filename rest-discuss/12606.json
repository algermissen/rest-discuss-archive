But\nwhen i design a user interface, i would also like to present\ninformation and other possible actions than the primary intent (An\nexample is suggesting similar books when i buy one). When i do this\nusing the same API, i cannot avoid a lot of chatter between the server\nand the client. To avoid this, i have seen a need for using another\nset of interfaces which internally use the API designed for\nmachine-machine interactions.\n\nSuresh\n\nOn Sat, May 2, 2009 at 12:32 PM, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; On 02.05.2009, at 04:22, Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just wondering how far one could take that since\n&gt;&gt; human-machine interactions and machine-machine interactions differ\n&gt;&gt; significantly in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think they differ as much as you seem to believe they do,\n&gt; especially if the machine-to-machine interface is designed following\n&gt; HATEOAS. Of course there are practical problems, such as the fact that\n&gt; HTML supports only GET and POST, browsers don&#39;t support explicit\n&gt; setting of Accept headers or lack a logout option for HTTP Auth, but\n&gt; these restrictions are not restrictions of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; E.g. if I&#39;m writing an application client, say built using Java/Swing,\n&gt; that is driven by hypermedia contained in representations returned\n&gt; from the server - would you expect that there&#39;d have to be a second\n&gt; server API for other clients?
