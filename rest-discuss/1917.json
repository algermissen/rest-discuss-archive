GET say &quot;given this identifier, give me whatever\n&gt; you&#39;ve got&quot;, while POST says &quot;given this identifier and addtional data, do\n&gt; whatever you are going to do with it, then give me whatever you&#39;ve got\n&gt; afterwards&quot;.  Either can return a representation of a resource that changes\n&gt; with each request, but only POST does this by intent.  Yes?\n\nThat is my understanding, yes. It sounds vaguely bogus to have a\ndistinction with a primary goal of establishing who is at fault for a\nscrew-up but then when you think of it, that&#39;s the whole point of\nstandards anyhow. If I leave off quotes in an XML attribute, the other\nparty and I can both consult the XML specification to determine who is\nat fault. Interoperability is achieved when the party at fault\nconsistently corrects to line up with the party who was correct. Or vice\nversa, in which case the &quot;wrong&quot; behaviour becomes a defacto standard.\n\nWrong behaviours seldom became defacto standards on the real Web because\nthe browsers kind of enforce a certain level of compliance. If you use\nPOST to mean GET then you can&#39;t use bookmarks. If you use GET to mean\nPOST then you get users hitting &quot;reload&quot; or &quot;print&quot; and changing your\ndatabase. In the XML world we don&#39;t have those natural checks so for a\nwhile it was common to use POST to mean GET with SOAP. But XSLT and\nother declarative languages serve a similar purpose in the XML world.\nUsing POST to mean GET destroys compatibility with those languages.\n\n(many Web apps respond the same way to GET and POST but if the HTML\ninterface only ever advertises one method then the other is effectively\nnon-existent)\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
