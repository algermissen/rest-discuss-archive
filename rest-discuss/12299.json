A collection resource can be created which contains\n&gt; &gt; only members 2, 5 and 9 and treats DELETE as a stored procedure to\n&gt; &gt; delete all members along with the collection resource itself.  No\n&gt; &gt; problem.  But, hypothetically, why?  I still see no compelling\n&gt; &gt; reason to optimize DELETE at the expense of the visibility which\n&gt; &gt; allows proper cache behavior.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; […]\n&gt; \n&gt; Presumably the client can create this collection, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; So the client can therefore cause the ‘batch’ deletion of resources,\n&gt; without being ‘un-RESTful’?\n&gt; \n\nNo.  If the client is creating a collection for the purpose of having\nthe deletion of that collection delete member resources of the\ncollection, then DELETE has the semantics of DELETE for member\nresources, while having the semantics of BDELETE for collection\nresources, but in REST you can&#39;t assign multiple semantics to a single\nmethod, because then you do not have &quot;a consistent set of semantics for\nall resources&quot;.\n\nIt is simply not RESTful for a client to request more than one\noperation at a time.  If the client wants to delete multiple resources,\nthen it must call the DELETE method of each resource it wants to\ndelete.  Not POST a collection of resources for batch deletion in one\nfurther request.  That further DELETE would be a BDELETE, where the\nresponse code doesn&#39;t indicate the success or failure of the sub-\noperations, and is therefore invisible to intermediaries, which won&#39;t\nhave a clue to stale the deleted sub-resources, making it highly\nprobable that the user who just requested a bunch of resources be\ndeleted can still see those resources.  Which is still why DELETE is\nits own method, it solves these problems, with the tradeoff of\nincreased network traffic.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
