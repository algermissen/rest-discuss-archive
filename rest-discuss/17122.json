In others, as you mention, it is\nd=\r\nepicted as non RESTful because actual implementations are static\nbinding, b=\r\nuild time code generation things. Totally agree, just that\nWSDL implementat=\r\nion may not be what was intended.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\nWell, any arch discussion will ha=\r\nve a context. In the context of the\nREST arch model, I find the WSDL patter=\r\nn (WSDL, WADL, GData Python\nAPI, etc.) to be inappropriate. I&#39;ve already me=\r\nntioned a handful of\nreasons. Possibly one I did not emphasize is the lack =\r\nof hypermedia in\nthis external definition pattern. While WSDL can do a good=\r\n job of\nexpressing the request and response details, I&#39;ve yet to see WSDL d=\r\no a\ngood job expressing the state transition details. IOW, which steps are\n=\r\nfirst, second, third, etc. These &quot;steps&quot;, in my experience almost\nalways de=\r\npend on the state of things at the moment and are not at all\neasy to proper=\r\nly express in a static document.\n\nI find it much easier to express the vali=\r\nd state transitions in the\ncontext of the _current_ state transition. Thus,=\r\n when working in a\nREST arch implementation, I continue to favor including =\r\napp control\ninformation in the response representation rather than in an ex=\r\nternal\ndocument. I&#39;ve been toying with pulling more and more details on the=\r\nse\ntransitions out of client code and into the message. I&#39;ve even been\nexpe=\r\nrimenting with putting some of the state transition detail in\n_external_ do=\r\ncuments, but have yet to find the WSDL pattern helpful\nfor that work.\n\n&lt;sni=\r\np&gt;\nSee, if we are able to hit a URL looking for data about how to\ncontinue =\r\nmy flow, I can have many resources that can help me. One\ncould be an XFORM.=\r\n The other one can be a WSDL. Both should tell me\nwhat to do next. But wait=\r\n, for that a WSDL should be something I can\nconsume dynamically. There is n=\r\nothing in the spec that says it should\nbe static. Implementations do not fo=\r\nllow that, and thus All\nimplementations of WSDL are unRESTFul. But that is =\r\nnot WSDL&#39;s fault,\nis it?\n&lt;/snip&gt;\nWhile I can see that it would be _possible=\r\n_ to use WSDL at runtime,\nI&#39;ve yet to see a viable example. I&#39;ve toyed with=\r\n this a bit and found\nit a non-starter. I&#39;m open to seeing working examples=\r\n of this. I&#39;m not\nreally interested in reading more technical papers about =\r\nit, tho.

Nothing there leads me to believe WSDL\nis appropriate for RE=\r\nST style arch models. From my POV, WSDL 2.0 is\noverly verbose (w/o the corr=\r\nesponding value in the added material) and\nlacking in key information neede=\r\nd at runtime including valid &quot;next\nsteps&quot; in state transitions. I find this=\r\n last item vital when working\nin any M2M scenario.\n\nNow, oo get back to you=\r\nr initial sentence, let&#39;s have an architecture\ndiscussion about WSDL.

At the end the answer is usually it supports RP=\r\nC, which is not the case lately. Actually, it never was, as document style =\r\nservices should be the ones to use. Oh, well.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Why is WSDL needed?=\r\n To describe the actual service consumption process. Where do we find the s=\r\nervice? Where do we find the document format we need to send or expect to r=\r\neceive? Where do we find the message send a receive pattern? It is there, i=\r\nn the WSDL.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, REST allows that flow to be discovered, rather t=\r\nhan written in one place. Ian&#39;s description of the use of XForms achieves t=\r\nhat, so they are similar in the goal, may not be so similar in the process.=\r\n Both will required some out-of-band information. XForms is not forcing the=\r\n POST method, actually. Is is a way to describe the expected data in a know=\r\nn format, reducing coupling. You may later change the XFORM given some data=\r\n for the request is changed, and nothing breaks (as a matter of fact, with =\r\nWSDL should happen the same, but people use compile time binding, stubs, th=\r\nat break that possibility).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; That said, I think the benefit of thi=\r\ns form is it avoid, at least a little, the early binding that WADL or WSDL =\r\nhave. So, you are creating totally dynamic clients instead of static ones, =\r\npre-build with stubs and things like that. There is still one problem to so=\r\nlve, though, the semantics of the data fields in the Form. But that should =\r\nbe managed as a pre defined context, with a general, agreed upon, glossary.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J=F8rn Wildt &lt;jw@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was read=\r\ning Ian Robinsons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (again, it&#39;s a good\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nad) at http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Here he introduces the idea of adding XForms to a link relation, such tha=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instead of having only:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 &lt;link rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;&quot; title=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and document out of band how to post data t=\r\no that link, one could have an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; XForm at the end of the link and then =\r\nuse that information as the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; online/inline/in-band documentation.
