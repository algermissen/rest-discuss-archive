Since then I have been wondering about how much suc=\r\nh a form tells my program at *runtime*.\n&gt;\n&gt; For this discussion I am focusi=\r\nng on HTML forms as we know them from the web. These includes:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Action=\r\n URL\n&gt; - Encoding\n&gt; - Operation\n&gt; - Inputs\n&gt;\n&gt; At runtime my program can pa=\r\nrse the action URL, the encoding and the operation, and use these to dynami=\r\ncally create a HTTP request.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what about the input definitions (the =\r\nactual payload)? Are they useful at runtime?\n&gt;\n&gt; At compile-time (or &quot;read =\r\nthe documentation time&quot;) the inputs are useful for telling my program (the =\r\ndeveloper) which values to that corresponds to what. As the developer I can=\r\n see that the name of the person must be sent as &quot;PersonName=3Dxxx&quot;. But af=\r\nter this I don&#39;t see how the client program can use the input definitions f=\r\nor anything at runtime.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have I overlooked some nice features of using f=\r\norms?\n&gt;\n&gt; One could decide to publish the identifiers for the input element=\r\ns that is used. For instance saying that the input marked with id=3D&quot;name-o=\r\nf-person&quot; defines the name of the input for the person&#39;s name. Like this:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; =A0&lt;input id=3D&quot;name-of-person&quot; name=3D&quot;PersonName&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But I don&#39;t se=\r\ne how that really changes anything - its just one more indirection to follo=\r\nw.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yaho=\r\no!
