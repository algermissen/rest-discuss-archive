Writing a WADL file means that you&#39;re duplicating the\ndiscovery process provided by HTTP itself.\n\nI would like to develop more tools based on the HTTP discovery process\nand the patterns that are being developed around REST. It would rely\non a sort of duck-REST (if it looks like REST - it must be) approach\nbut it would be interesting.\n\nThe sorts of tools that I am thinking about are code generation tools\nsuch as there are in the WS-* world. Point a tool at an endpoint press\na button and out comes skeleton Python, Perl, Java or C#.\n\nOf course... that&#39;s only the client side and one of the nice things\nabout WSDL (did I just say &quot;nice&quot;? must be slipping) is that you can\ndefine a WSDL somewhere (by transformation from somewhere else say)\nand then generate service implementation code from that.\n\nWADL could do that and I&#39;m also looking at that.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
