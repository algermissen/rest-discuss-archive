Wikis have some problems, but for me, they are much \nmore RESTful than Yahoo Groups.\n\n&gt; One thing I remember is that some people were using &quot;transaction&quot; \nin the\n&gt; sense of transactional integrity and some people were using it \nmerely to\n&gt; mean a &quot;Communication involving two or more people that affects all\n&gt; those involved; personal interaction&quot;/&quot;The doing or performing of \nany\n&gt; business; management of any affair; performance.&quot;\n&gt; http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=transaction&r=67\n&gt; \n&gt; We had this same terminological problem during the REST/SOAP panel.\n&gt; Lucas used transaction in the latter sense and Rohit thought he \nmeant in\n&gt; the database sense.\n\nThe appropriate transaction model for Web conversations is another \nvery closely related issue.  I strongly favor state-alignment \ntransactions over anything even remotely resembling database \ntransactions, but that may be because I am thinking of business \nexchanges.  I suspect mostly people are not even thinking of the \nissues.  W3C-ws-arch is still thinking database transactions.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
