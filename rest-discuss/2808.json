The server is\n&gt; holding state on the client&#39;s behalf.  That&#39;s the problem.\n\nMy thought is that if the Web-as-we-use it were architected entirely \naccording to REST, then &quot;client-side&quot; state (not username/passwords, but \npreferences, etc.) would more likely live at any URI-addressable home. \nSo you might launch your favorite news site like this:\n\nhttp://www.mynews.com/\n\nor like this:\n\nhttp://www.mynews.com?prefs=http://mypreferences.com/~prescod\n\nNo matter what device you were using, you would point the site at your \nconsistent preferences-URI. The browser would (at your _request_) send \nthe information to remote servers. Servers would _ask you_ for read \nand/or write permission to your preferences-URI and the information \nstored there would tend to be open, textual and in many cases defined \nindependent of any particular application. If you &quot;publish&quot; your \nfavourite sports team, it should be provided to all services _and all of \nyour devices_ unless you specifically override it for some particular \napplication or device.\n\nThe problem with this vision is it requires a trusted third party to \nhold your preference information. Most people do not run their own \nservers. ISPs are the logical choice except who trusts AOL or MSN???\nBut even so, there could be a degenerate case where the preference-URI \nis something like &quot;local://mybrowser/preference-cache&quot; and some protocol \nmagic would make that work as if it were a real, full-time preference \nserver.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
