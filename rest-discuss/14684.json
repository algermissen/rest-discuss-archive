I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of detailing any method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; semantics against either the element itself or a &quot;rel&quot; attribute.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I think so, too. Since the client understands the semantics of\n&gt; &gt; the transition it is taking anyway[1] there is usually no need to\n&gt; &gt; specify the method in the hypertext.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To make sure I understand correctly, are you suggesting that ideally\n&gt; link relations would specify (in the link registry) which method\n&gt; should be used to navigate to the target URI?\n\nYes. With GET being the default. The relation type describes the  \nsemantics of\nthe link target and these semantics include what kind of domain goals  \nthe client\ncan achive with requests to the target resource.\n\nIf you see &lt;link rel=&quot;cart&quot; href=&quot;./shopping-cart&quot;/&gt; and the type spec  \nfor &#39;cart&#39;\ntells you that a DELETE request on it empties the cart then you know  \nthat\n\nDELETE ./shopping-cart achieves the domain goal of emptying the cart.\n\nI started to describe that in http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?p=8\n\n(last paragraph where it says: &quot;express the operations that are  \ncurrently stated\nin the form of prose in hypermedia specifications in terms of the  \nabove predicate\nconjunctions and HTTP operations&quot;)\n\n\n&gt; So perhaps a &quot;create&quot;\n&gt; relation could be registered that specifies &quot;POST&quot; as the method to\n&gt; use?\n\nNo, link relations denote resource semantics, not actions. The resource\nsemantics include what is achived by what requests on the resource.\n\nIf you say\n\n&lt;link rel=&quot;lock&quot; href=&quot;/445/lock&quot;/&gt; these semantics might be that PUT\ncreates the lock and DELETE removes it.\n\n\n\n&gt; Would this be problematic for custom relations that the client\n&gt; may not be aware of the appropriate method for?\n\nThe cient needs to implement the semantics anyway. However, if the\nHTTP connector implementation you use does not support all methods,\ndump it and get a better one.\n\n&gt; Currently, the Atom\n&gt; link registry does not specify any defined methods for any of the\n&gt; existing relations that are registered.\n\nIf there is no such definition, no domain operations are involved. GET\nmakes sense by default.\n\n&gt; Even the &quot;edit&quot; relation\n&gt; doesn&#39;t specify a method, it is still just GETable resource that one\n&gt; can apply the uniform interface to.\n\nNo. The semantics of edit and edit-media are defined in the AtomPub  \nspecs and\nthere the effect of a PUT and DELETE to either of them is specified.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - --\n&gt; Kris Zyp\n&gt; SitePen\n&gt; (503) 806-1841\n&gt; http://sitepen.com\n&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt; Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\n&gt; Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; iEYEARECAAYFAktgpagACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAxKswCgqEHhKdR8hgWrc8Yiy0ZrH3as\n&gt; IeYAoKe9tvA7UZDSzGIIO41uQVBy3nYP\n&gt; =MhL1\n&gt; -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------\n  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n\n  Mail: algermissen@...\n  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
