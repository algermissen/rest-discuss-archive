I have to admit that i don&#39;t really understand.\n&gt; You have to define a format that is suitable for any kind of\n&gt; application. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the\n&gt; representation to be self descriptive, but you still have to define (ou\n&gt; refine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as\n&gt; Bill? said).\n\nSee my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.\nEarlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough to \ndefine your entire application from the client&#39;s perspective.\n\nIf the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept \nheader, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the \nsemantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a \ncontainer.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST means \nadd an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container; messages \nmust be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.\n\nIf the server returns a container in response to a GET without an Accept \nheader, the resource is a container and not an index.  That means the \nsemantics of POST should be with respect to the container and not an index. \nIn other words, if the resource is a container, then POST means add a \nmessage to the container and can at your option affect an index.  Messages \nare stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing constrains the \nserver from providing an index in response to a GET with a an &quot;Accept: \ntext/x-yannick-index&quot;, but that is really beside the point.\n\nNote, nothing constrains how the server actually stores the index or the \ncontainer.  All that is required is that clients can interact solely in \nterms of the representations it exposes.\n\n&gt;&gt; HOW do you know that /inbox/ actually is a container containing MIME\n&gt;&gt; messages?\n&gt;\n&gt; it&#39;s a one-line-doc matter...  :), or application/x-container, and no\n&gt; need for doc!\n\nIf the content-type returned from a GET without an Accept header is indeed \nan application/x-container\nthen how does the client obtain an index?  If it gets an index only when it \nsends the appropriate Accept header, then I have no issue with your app.\n\n&gt;&gt;   The client does not need to know *anything*\n&gt;&gt; about how the server thinks about inboxes internally.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why does it need it in the proposed example ?\n\nIt does if GET w/o an Accept header does not imply the required semantics \nw/r/t POST.\n\n&gt; the index is a *representation* of the container. e.g.\n\nIt depends what you mean by representation.\n0 is a representation of all integers after a suitable transformation.\nWhat is the content-type returned from a GET without an Accept header?\nWhat information is that content-type intended to represent?\n\n&gt; c:\n&gt; GET /inbox/\n&gt;\n&gt; s:\n&gt; 200 ok\n&gt; aaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\n&gt; bbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\n\nSo /inbox/ is an index.  Appending an entry to this index is very different \nfrom appending a message to an inbox.\n\n&gt; c:\n&gt; POST /inbox/\n&gt; Content-Type: mime/rfc-822\n&gt;\n&gt; MIME ...\n&gt; Subject: ccc\n&gt; Message-ID: ccc-mid\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; s:\n&gt; 201 created\n&gt; Location: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid\n\nYou CAN support this, but it is not HTTP because it is not meaningful to \nappend a MIME message to an\nindex (because the index does not contain message data).\n\nYou needs to support this:\nc:\nPOST /inbox/\nContent-type: text/index-entry\n\nccc: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid\n\nIf this is not legal, you are not really supporting HTTP.\n\n&gt; but this example is juste quickly imagined to be an example, and must\n&gt; not be considered as a proposal, nor as an complete and robust system.\n&gt; there is surely problems in it :)\n&gt; but it is concrete. Can&#39;t you give a concrete example of MoST model ?\n\nI hope I have been concrete with respect to your example....\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
