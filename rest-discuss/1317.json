Designing code with this viewpoint results in needing to do\ncertain things - like returning the URI of the new PO in the response\nmessage rather than assuming the client will know where it is - but that\neffort results in a more flexible and interoperable system. It&#39;ll work fine\nwithout it, but you are just limiting the scope of your system (which might\nbe acceptable for the problem you are trying to solve).\n\n\n\n"}}
