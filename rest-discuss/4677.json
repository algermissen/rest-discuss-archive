It can be used to\n&gt; decouple systems from knowing the specific format and syntax of resource\n&gt; identifiers. This would be one way for a map service to use path segments\n&gt; and a different vendor use query terms. The tradeoff is that the document\n&gt; format would have to be agreed upon, but implementors would be free to\n&gt; choose varying resource identifier formats.\n\nThat&#39;s exactly what I was getting at -- the hypermedia constraint\ncontinues to be a useful one, even when it&#39;s not a human at the end of\nthe browswer.\n\nWhile a human might require a full and verbose HTML form to come back at\neach step in the interaction cycle, an automaton might only require...\n\n   &lt;map xmlns=&quot;http://path/to/map/description&quot; /&gt;\n\n....to come back in response to -- say -- `GET /map`.  That is, the xml\nnamespace of the document itself might be the hyperlink to some\naggreed-upon-format describing how to interact with the service.  \n\nWhile `xmlns` might be a bit of a stretch w.r.t. retrievability [for\nsome strange reason], subst in RDF and you&#39;re good.\n\n\nAnother useful non-HTML-format response might be a &quot;term map&quot; ... where\nWMS is just one &quot;syntax&quot; of interface exposed by some more general\nservice ... JMS [for &quot;jsled&#39;s mapping service&quot; ] might be the other. \n\nThe response to `GET /` might then be something like...\n\n  &lt;mappings xmlns=&quot;http://ns.eg.org/term-mapping-namespace&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;map to=&quot;http://ns.wms.org/mapping&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;mapping they-say=&quot;tomatoe&quot; we-say=&quot;tomato&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;mapping they-say=&quot;potatoe&quot; we-say=&quot;potato&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/map&gt;\n  &lt;/mappings&gt;\n\nBut it&#39;s really hard to see how to make that format work generally\nunless the underlying service is already basically a 1-1 mapping, in\nwhich case it&#39;s probably easier to have the server be responsible for\ndoing the mapping.\n\n\nIn any case, assuming some sort of top-level GET returns a\nresource+service-description language, the automaton can probably\nunderstand a whole set of coordinated interaction exchanges in response\nto receiving that one root-level document.  This is weird, because it&#39;s\nin direct conflict with why the web  works so well -- the server is the\ndirector&#39;s chair, and at a relatively fine grain.  At the same time,\nhumans consuming web services are different from automatons doing the\nsame, and I think a hybrid approach will probably work pretty well.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
