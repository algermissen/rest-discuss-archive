But if you add the\nfollowing URL to your REST interface, it suddenly becomes clear (at least I\nhope it does. :)\n\n\t3.) http://example.com/color-combos/a-and-b/\n\nNote that any state that you need can simply be modeled as a URL that\nrepresents that state. Just make sure to think in terms of nouns, not verbs\n(i.e. &#39;/color-combos/a-and-b/&#39; not &#39;/swap-a-and-b&#39;). But note that the use\nof URL #3 does not preclude the use of #1 or #2, both of which are almost\ncertainly useful in other contexts.\n\nDoes this help?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n"}}
