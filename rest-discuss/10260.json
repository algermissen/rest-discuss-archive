The Web as we know it has another\n&gt; thing called discovery. Given a resource I can discover how to use\n&gt; it, as I&#39;m using it, and use hypermedia to drive the application\n&gt; state.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my experience that doesn&#39;t work for the programmable Web. You\n&gt; really do need to know what the states and transitions are, before you\n&gt; start coding for them. Things like getting an order done is pursuing\n&gt; known transitions, to a desired end state, but you&#39;ll never start if\n&gt; you don&#39;t know there&#39;s a paved road leading to your destination.\n\nI don&#39;t think hypertext-driven apps are incompatible with a\nstate-transition map.\n\nFor example, I think what will happen eventually with\ncomputer-to-computer order processing on the web is that it will\nbecome stereotyped, either by standardization or convention.\n\nThat&#39;s what ebXML was trying to do, unfortunately based on EDI ideas\nrather than the Web.  For the Web, maybe it will be based on what\nAmazon does.\n\nSo an expected state-transition model will emerge, and the hypertext\nwill tell you what actual resources fill the roles in the order\nprocessing scenario.\n\nAll the application state will be managed by agents acting as clients.\nBut &quot;who&#39;s the client&quot; and &quot;who&#39;s the server&quot; might switch around\nduring the order and fulfillment process.\n\n"}}
