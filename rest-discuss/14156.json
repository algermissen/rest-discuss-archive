In order to being able to make such an assumptions, the  \nclassification information must be made available by the service. In  \naddition, when client developers should be enabled to develop clients  \nbefore the services exist this information is needed as some form of  \nservice type description. The specification of application/atomsrv+xml  \nis a good example of such a service type description.\n\nBut however this is approached, it essentially comes down to telling  \nthe client what kinds of resources (IOW: kinds of application states)  \nto expect on the server. I just cannot code to update the resource  \nfoo:status when I have now clue that this user goal is applicable to  \nthe resource in the first place.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to align this (IMHO fact) with the  \nconstraint that no information about resource types must be made  \navailable to clients in RESTful systems?\n\nJan\n\nP.S. In human driven interactions the situation is different: We still  \nhave knowledge of the resource type iin general (we know a trouble  \nticket when we see one) but we are not dependent on knowing that the  \nresult of some interaction will be a trouble ticket. We can allways  \nfollow some human-targeted links and make a few hops to reach the  \ntrouble ticket resource we expect should be &#39;somwehere&#39;. M2M clients  \ndo not have that luxury (unless we apply some form of AI I guess).\n\n"}}
