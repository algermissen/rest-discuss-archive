I&#39;m guessing it is all\n&gt; about user interface issues -- being able to put the login box\n&gt; where-ever you want it.\n\nExactly right.  This is a major issue, as it prevents many tasks from\nbeing automated.\n\n&gt; What needs to be done to web infrastructure so that this bit of context\n&gt; moves from the HTML/cookie domain down into HTTP where it is supposed to\n&gt; live?\n\nI don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a quick fix.  One thing I was thinking of was\nan HTML/XHTML extension that would allow more flexibility in the user\ninterface of the authentication system.  But it would take forever to\nroll that out.\n\nOther ideas;\n- conventions for cookie values.  would also be difficult to rollout\nas HTTP libs that support cookies would all need fixing.\n- recognizing forms with two fields where one is a password input type,\nand somehow kludging that knowledge into the auth system.  easier to\nrollout, but error prone and not sure how the kludge would work\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
