The paper describes a RESTful interface\n&gt; &gt;for tradeable electronic credit.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m at a disadvantage here since I really don&#39;t understand the\n&gt; capability model that&#39;s being described.\n\nThe basics of the model are fairly simple. Based on your next\nsentence, it looks like you&#39;ve already groked the main point.\n\n&gt; However, reading the paper, I got the sense that security is\n&gt; provided as a result of traversing a graph.\n\nThat&#39;s correct. The graph basically says: &quot;If a user has access to\nthis resource, they are also authorized to use these other\nresources.&quot; You can tell which resources the user is not\nauthorized to use by noticing that there is no way to get to those\nresources by traversing the graph. Having a simple and\nwell-defined model like this makes it a lot easier to study your\napplication security and make sure you got it right.\n\n&gt; This doesnt seem terribly useful - why should I have to traverse\n&gt; a graph to get to a resource every time I want to access the resource?\n&gt;  Why can&#39;t I just directly access it.\n\nYou can directly access it. Any resource in the graph can have a\nURI associated with it. You can use this URI to directly access\nthe resource. The graph defines how you get additional URIs, given\nthe ones you&#39;ve already got.\n\n&gt; I really dont get this.  Perhaps I&#39;m dense, but it just doesn&#39;t seem\n&gt; useful to have a world where everybody gets their own URI to a single\n&gt; resource.  What happens to sharing and linking?\n\nYou&#39;re not dense, just a little hard of hearing. ;) As I said in\nthe last message, you&#39;re right, you wouldn&#39;t use this model to\ngive everyone their own URI to a single, shared, read-only\nresource. You use this model to protect and share access to\nprivate resources.  Think more about your online banking interface\nthan your Wall Street Journal subscription.\n\nFor example, you might have a capability URL for your bank\naccount. From this resource, you can navigate to resources that\nlet you pay bills and view your withdrawal/deposit history. The\naccount history might be composed of a different resource for each\nof the calendar months. At tax time, you might give your\naccountant the URIs for your January to December account history\nresources. Your accountant can then do up your tax forms, but\ncannot pay bills from your account.\n\nTyler\n\n\n"}}
