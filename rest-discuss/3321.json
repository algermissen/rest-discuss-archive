There is no such thing.  Don&#39;t be un=\r\nder\nthe\n&gt; illusion that you are using something &quot;that already exists&quot;.  You=\r\n are\n&gt; redefining/adding-to the semantics of the OPTIONS method, i.e., ther=\r\ne\nis\n&gt; no server in the world that understands OPTIONS &lt;url&gt; means it shoul=\r\nd\n&gt; return the metadata document for a service.    \n\nI completely agree tha=\r\nt very, very few, if any, are using OPTIONS in \nthis way currently; but the=\r\n same could be said of the headers you\nare proposing that others support.  =\r\nReturning an Allow header\nalong with a set of schemas, or even a link, or a=\r\n redirect to \na set of schemas is a perfectly valid and appropriate use of =\r\nOPTIONS.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say that it is adding to the semantics of the OPTIONS =\r\n\nmethod any more than adding an extension header is adding to a GET.\nA clie=\r\nnt is requesting what their options are at that location\nand the server is =\r\ninforming them.\n\nWhat I am saying is that instead of proposing the inclusio=\r\nn of a \nnew header with each GET, it might better to propose the\nadoption o=\r\nf the convension of using the OPTIONS method.  I don&#39;t \nhave a problem with=\r\n a standalone document, but I would like to see \nthe OPTIONS method be the =\r\nmechanism for getting to it.  \n\n&gt; To recap:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Yes, the OPTIONS verb is =\r\na viable alternative to the using the \n&gt; Meta-Location header.  There are p=\r\nluses and minuses to each approach.\n&gt; *  However, you still need the Meta-A=\r\nbout header to solve the problem\n&gt; of allowing third parties to add metadat=\r\na about a resource (see\nbelow).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If a time comes when search engines ar=\r\ne able to parse and understand\n&gt;&gt; semantically marked up documents, wouldn&#39;=\r\nt it be easier to just have\n&gt;&gt; a link to the service right in the document =\r\nitself instead of\n&gt;&gt; introducing\n&gt;&gt; a custom header?  \n\n&gt; &quot;link to the serv=\r\nice right in the document itself&quot; ... You mean\nmandate\n&gt; that every metadat=\r\na description document must contain  buried within\nit\n&gt; a URL to the servic=\r\ne it describes?  Consequently, tools must delve\ninto\n&gt; (and understand the =\r\nsemantics of) the metadata description document to\n&gt; extract the URL, right=\r\n?  \n\nTo be honest, I am much more ambivalent about how 3rd-party metadata \n=\r\ndocuments refering back to the service.\n\nGoogle has no idea of the meaning =\r\nof the documents it is parsing, it\njust\nindexes the words and pulls URLs ou=\r\nt of link tags. Granted, if\nsome metadata decides to put links into the doc=\r\nument in some way that it\ndoesn&#39;t understand (like the soapAction attribute=\r\n etc.) then it&#39;s either\ngoing to miss them; have to start looking for a wid=\r\ner range of\nstandardize linking\nmechanisms (xlink, etc.); or get a lot smar=\r\nter about the way it parses\ndocument.\n\n&gt; For example, an aggregator tool wh=\r\nich, say,\n&gt; wants to collect together the URLs of all metadata descriptions=\r\n which\n&gt; refer to some vendor&#39;s service must parse through every metadata\n&gt;=\r\n description document to extract the URL.  Yikes!  Not very RESTful is\n&gt; it=\r\n?  \n\nI&#39;m not sure how this is RESTful or non-RESTful.  If a client requests=\r\n \na document, it&#39;s up to the client to do whatever it sees fit with it.\n\n&gt; =\r\nThis would be analogous to forcing caching tools to examine (and\n&gt; understa=\r\nnd) the contents of every message to decide whether it should\n&gt; cache the m=\r\nessage.  No, this Meta-About URL needs to be in the HTTP\n&gt; header.  /Roger\n=\r\n\nUnless the OPTIONS method of the metadata (the meta-metadata of the\nservic=\r\ne) service included a link to the service that&#39;s being \ndescribed. :) If yo=\r\nu&#39;re pouring over what you know to be metadata \ndocuments anyway, you could=\r\n always hit that resource with an OPTIONS\nrequest while your at it.\n\nThis h=\r\nas been an interesting discussion.\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n"}}
