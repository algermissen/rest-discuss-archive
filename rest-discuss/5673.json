One comment, Safari&#39;s XHR implementation is a little bit broken, PUT \n&gt; and DELETE requests are silently converted to GETs.\n\nI am incredulous??! Is this really so?\n\nIs there some config option somewhere that is forcing this bizarre\nbehaviour?\n\nIsn&#39;t Safari based on Konqueror? or is it a moz based thing? I haven&#39;t\nused a mac in years.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
