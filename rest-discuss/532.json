Any thoughts on this?\n\nJeff Bone wrote:\n\n&gt; So we&#39;ve got a problem we need to solve with notifications on\n&gt; containers.  As a cautionary note:  I think we need to tread\n&gt; lightly, here.  We don&#39;t want to hardwire any particular kind of\n&gt; container semantics into the spec --- IMO, one of the problems\n&gt; with DAV is that it imposes a new and rigid container semantics\n&gt; on Web-based systems, one that isn&#39;t necessarily universal.  That\n&gt; said...\n&gt;\n&gt; When subscribing to a container, there are two possible kinds of\n&gt; notification of interest:  changes to the contents of the\n&gt; container (i.e., what is in it) --- potentially recursively ---\n&gt; and changes *in* the contents of the container (i.e., changes to\n&gt; the things in it) --- again potentially recursively.  In order to\n&gt; subscribe to a particular subtree of the resource space, however\n&gt; an application may define that, you shouldn&#39;t have to subscribe\n&gt; to each individual resource in that subtree.  So we need two\n&gt; mechanisms:  a notification-time specifier that indicates which\n&gt; resource has changed, and a subscription-time specifier that\n&gt; indicates the &quot;depth&quot; of the subscription.\n&gt;\n&gt; NOTIFICATION SPECIFIER\n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; This one&#39;s easy.  A container which generates notifications\n&gt; SHOULD include a header &quot;Changed-URI&quot; that gives the full URI for\n&gt; the resource which has changed, generating this event.  The\n&gt; Changed-URI MAY be a different URI than the Subscribed-URI /\n&gt; Watched-URI associated with the subscription.  A Changed-URI in a\n&gt; notification SHOULD (?) be a sub-URI of the Subscribed-URI, i.e.,\n&gt; a URI that has as a leading substring the full Subscribed-URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; SUBSCRIPTION SPECIFIER\n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; This one is tricky.  At a first pass, it might be acceptable to\n&gt; simply allow two kinds of container subscriptions:  subscriptions\n&gt; to change notifications when the top-level contents of the\n&gt; container change, and subscriptions to changes to the top-level\n&gt; contents or to any of the contained objects, recursively.  I.e.,\n&gt; a &quot;recursive&quot; boolean.  There are perhaps two ways to do this.\n&gt;\n&gt; (1)  On the subscription request, the client could pass a header\n&gt; &quot;Recursive-Subscription&quot; along to the subscribed resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2)  We could introduce some URI magic.  Before everyone begins\n&gt; yelling that this violates URI opacity, consider OPTIONS *.  It&#39;s\n&gt; already the case that * is in effect a special URI that in the\n&gt; context of OPTIONS means &quot;state of the server that receives the\n&gt; request.&quot;  With that in mind, assume\n&gt;\n&gt;     /foo\n&gt;     /foo/bar\n&gt;     /foo/baz/baf\n&gt;\n&gt; /foo/ is a container that contains a non-container /foo/bar, and\n&gt; a container /foo/baz/ that itself contains a non-container\n&gt; /foo/baz/baf.  A subscriber might specify\n&gt;\n&gt;     /foo/*\n&gt;\n&gt; To get notifications in all of the following circumstances:  (a)\n&gt; the contents of /foo/ change.  (b) The state of /foo/bar\n&gt; changes.  (c)  The contents of /foo/baz/ change.  (d)  The state\n&gt; of /foo/baz/baf changes.\n&gt;\n&gt; A subscription on just /foo/ would simply generate events when\n&gt; the contents of /foo/ change.\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually prefer the second option;  it gives a name-based\n&gt; mechanism for distinguishing between the object itself and the\n&gt; subtree, and let&#39;s name-based dispatch code figure out what&#39;s\n&gt; going on rather than having to grope through the headers.\n&gt; Sticking it in the headers feels a bit too much to me like RPC\n&gt; with paramater-passing in the headers.  But it&#39;s only a mild\n&gt; preference.\n&gt;\n&gt; $0.02,\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
