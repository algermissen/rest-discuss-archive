This is\n&gt; ghost of your own creation haunting your perception of this debate.  I have\n&gt; been very explicit that, in the general case, hypertext indexes (lists,\n&gt; navigational structures, etc. --- the namespace is the query space\n&gt; regardless) are desirable wherever they are possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have a collection of data on the\n&gt; &gt; web that you want people to treat as a true collection then you should\n&gt; &gt; provide an index to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So:  drill down on what you mean, specifically, by index.\n&gt; \n&gt; jb\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
