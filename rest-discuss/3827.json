The\n&gt; solution to this (not widely used yet, too many people seem to love C)\n&gt; is the notion of pre- and postcondition:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. If the client fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting\n&gt;    all the conditions stated in the precondition,\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. then the server fullfills its part of the obligation, i.e. meeting\n&gt;    all the conditions stated in the postcondition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Everything beyond that is of no concern to the client.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Explicit pre- and postconditions are missing from REST, but that it is\n&gt; all you need. If the precondition states that you can PUT, you can. If\n&gt; the postcondition states that the result of the PUT is that a GET\n&gt; returns the putted resource, than that&#39;s all there is.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you seek an understanding of how different resouces work together\n&gt; and how to accomplish certain tasks (booking a meeting with different\n&gt; participans for example), that has and will always be part of the\n&gt; documentation. That&#39;s just part of the architecture. UI don&#39;t see any\n&gt; metamodel solving that problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Berend.
