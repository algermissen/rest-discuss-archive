The end \n&gt; result is no body document for this URI in my local cache. To \n&gt; fix this, I changed my code to ignore the ETag returned on \n&gt; POST/PUT when attempting to update my local cache w/ a GET.\n\n&gt; Was my initial code faulty?\n\nYes. It doesn&#39;t make sense to do a conditional get when you want the server\nto return the response body unconditionally. In other words, don&#39;t make GET\nrequests conditional when you have no entity for the resource in your cache.\n\n&gt; Is returning an ETag in POST/PUT \n&gt; response w/ an empty body standard practice?\n\nKinda. It depends on the response code, not just the method. If the ETag is\nreturned in a &quot;201 Created&quot; response, then the ETag is for one of the\nrepresentations of the resource referenced in the Location header field\n(but, a 201 response should have a body). See the definitions of the other\nstatus codes to see what ETag means for those kinds of responses. If nothing\nis mentioned for a particular status code, then the use of the ETag header\nis undefined for that response and the ETag should be ignored.\n\nOut of curiousity, what response code was the server returning?\n\nRegards,\nBrian\n\n\n"}}
