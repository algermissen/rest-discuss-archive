Of course, we rarely achieve the\n&gt; ultimate goal the first time, and sometimes there are many paths to\n&gt; the ultimate goal that get explored along the way, and sometimes\n&gt; people move the goal posts.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there are many URIs for a given resource, the best implementation\n&gt; is for all of the other URIs to redirect to the one URI that is\n&gt; deemed to be &quot;best&quot; for the resource&#39;s unique semantics.  The reason\n&gt; for that is not REST or Web Architecture (though both are specifically\n&gt; designed to enable it): the reason is network economics as expressed\n&gt; by power laws, Metcalfe&#39;s law, PageRank, and a hundred other\n&gt; restatements of the factors that place value on social networks.\n\nI understand how that should help search engines count how many  \nreferences there are for calculating page rank, but could you  \nelaborate how canonical URLs affect &quot;Metcalf&#39;s law, power laws, and a  \nhunder other restatements...&quot;\n\nI did take the canonical URL thing to heart in our new architecture.  \nIt may be a bit over-designed but we generate controllers that  \ncanonicalize by dropping trailing slashes and even reordering the  \nquery parameters. For example:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&p=4&o=a\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&o=a&t=java\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&o=a&p=4\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&t=java&o=a\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&p=4&t=java\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&p=4&o=a\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&o=a&t=java\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&o=a&p=4\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&t=java&o=a\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&p=4&t=java\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nAll get redirected to:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nCurrently there is one URI that doesn&#39;t get redirected to the  \ncanonical form. It&#39;s on my list to fix that:\n\nhttp://artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
