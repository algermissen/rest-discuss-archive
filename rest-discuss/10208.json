At no point does it treat a URI as anything\nother than an atomic opaque unit. This is the reason why it apparently\naccomplishes less than a template because it addresses only the\nuniform interface.\n\nRegards,\nAlan\n\nOn 1/16/08, Michael Makunas &lt;michael@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  That looks interesting, but do you really gain anything beyond what a\n&gt;  simple URI template would? It seems to accomplish less, IMHO. In your\n&gt;  examples, the client thinks a certain server knows where a cart\n&gt;  service is. It looks at the representation at the root and checks for\n&gt;  a location (in the form of an element,node,string, or whatever).\n&gt;  Finally, it navigates to that location. I&#39;m trying figure out what\n&gt;  should be at that location.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think the solution is to put a URI template (or something similar)\n&gt;  there. And if that&#39;s the case, why not have that at the root and skip\n&gt;  your first step?\n&gt;\n&gt;  -Michael\n\n"}}
