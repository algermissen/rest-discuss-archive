It would be nice to get some clarity on the \nbetter approach for each of these cases.\n\nI have a resource type, a geographic location that can be uniquely \nidentified both by its position in a coordinate system and also by a \nunique identifer assigned to it when it was created in the database. \nI would like a requestor to be able to retrieve a resource instance \nusing either form of identification.\n\nLooking at examples of RESTful URIs it would seem that I could \nrepresent a location request like this:\n\nGET /location/12345 where &#39;12345&#39; is the location&#39;s primary key.\n\nNow lets say that I want to retrieve this location by its geographic \nposition, I now have 2 pieces of information that, together, \nuniquely identify the resource.  Because neither the x or the y \ncoordinate is subordinate to the other it seems this information \nshould be passed in the query string rather than the URI part, for \nexample:\n\nGET /location?x=110022&y=220033\n\nThen maybe for uniformity I should change the first URI so it also \npasses the identifier in the query string:\n\nGET /location?id=12345\n\nI also want to track who&#39;s requesting the resource for billing \npurposes so my options would seem to be:\n\nGET /location/12345?customerId=6789\n\nor\n\nGET /location/?id=12345&customerId=6789\n\nIn either case I&#39;m not sure if I like the mixing of metadata, who \nrequested the resource, with the query data.\n\nCheers\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
