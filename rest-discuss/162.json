For one thing it works at a totally\ndifferent logical level. For another thing its future is controlled by\nbig companies and surrounded by hordes of patents.\n\n&gt; ... In addition, this is metadata about an\n&gt; application, not protocol-level functionality, so supporting it via special HTTP\n&gt; headers etc violates opacity.\n\nI tihnk we should think of what we are doing as an extension to the\nprotocol, not an application. A particular stock site is an application.\nThe protocol should allow notifications on any kind of site (whether it\nbe a stock site or otherwise).\n\n&gt; Proposed solution: have a single out-of-band communication to specify how to\n&gt; find the WSDL description.  For example:\n&gt; &quot;The service provider MAY choose to have a file named watch_services.wsdl at\n&gt; &lt;some well known location&gt;&quot;.\n\nIf you&#39;re going to punt in this way, we might as well make it a binary\nfile format because the WSDL will hide all of the details from the user\nanyway. \n\n&gt; At least one incantation will have to be involved, because the service\n&gt; description bootstraps the entire interaction.\n\nI don&#39;t need a service description to hook up a web browser to an HTTP\nweb service like Google. I don&#39;t need a service description to hook up a\nWebDAV client like Office 2000 to a WebDAV server like Apache+mod_dav.\n\nA big part of standardization is figuring out what is common (e.g. the\nidea of notifications) and what is application-specific (e.g.\nnotifications when a price goes beyond a limit). But you seem not to\nwant to relegate anything to the common category. It&#39;s all application!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
