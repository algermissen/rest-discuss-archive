The amount of obscurantia needed is very large; few people outside\nof the standards development community have it.  Witness that REST advocates\nregularly need to point to primary materials such as\nhttp://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/override-entry.txt and RFCs.\n\nWhat is missing is concise documentation related to HTTP semantics.  Things like\nRFC 2616 need to cover too much turf for non-fanatics to find answers in a\ntimely way.  Eg, wading through a sea of BNF diagrams to glean semantics is\nimpractical.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t blame this on HTTP.  The REST design style is at a stage where lore\nis passed on person to person.  This can change if anybody takes the initiative\nto develop documentation for a general audience.  The REST Wiki is a beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
