We can use POST for everything, but when another\n&gt;  &gt; method matches perfectly it&#39;s generally best to use that.\n&gt; \n&gt; The consequence of mixing up a merge and overwrite operation justify\n&gt; alternate methods imo. Consensus (on atom-syntax at the very least) is\n&gt; PUT is not a patch/merge operator. To distinguish between the two forms\n&gt; of update. You can switch on something else, like a media type (or a\n&gt; type param), but you have to define it per media type as opposed to once\n&gt; in the method (ie it&#39;s not uniform for all media). I&#39;ve always felt the\n&gt; time to use a new methods is when the old method is dangerously close to\n&gt; what you want to do, but incorrect.
