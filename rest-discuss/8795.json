Or, more accurately, discovering \nconflicts between best practices.\n\nA best practice (and a constraint) of REST is to provide links in a \nreturned representation to other useful states of the application \n(HATEOAS). Another best practice is that a server should accept messages \nin the same format as it sends them, such that a user can get a \nrepresentation, modify it a little, and PUT it back.\n\nIt seems to me that these two practices are in conflict.\n\nImagine an expense report application where the following is returned:\n\nGET /users/placey/expenses/123\n...\n&lt;ExpenseReport xml:base=&quot;http://example.com/expenses&quot;\nxmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n&lt;Submitter xlink:href=�http://employees.example.com/placey�&gt;Peter \nLacey&lt;/Submitter&gt;\n&lt;ChargeTo xlink:href=�/departments/sales�&gt;Sales&lt;/ChargeTo&gt;\n&lt;ExpenseItem&gt;\n&lt;Date&gt;2007-06-01&lt;/Date&gt;\n&lt;Description&gt;Airfare&lt;/Description&gt;\n&lt;Amount&gt;500.34&lt;/Amount&gt;\n&lt;/ExpenseItem&gt;\n&lt;/ExpenseReport&gt;\n\nEven though the Submitter element is redundant with information in the \nURL, I want to provide that link to the &quot;employee&quot; system so that the \nclient can get more detail on the employee if they want to. Similarly, I \nwant to provide a link to information about the department being charged \n(maybe it has budget information). However, if I were to PUT this back \nto the server, I wouldn&#39;t want the client to specify the submitter, and, \nmore importantly, I wouldn&#39;t want the client to be telling me what the \nURL to the submitter&#39;s employee record is. Ditto, I do not want the \nclient to tell me the URL of the sales department.\n\nSo, does one practice (connectedness) trump the other (representational \nsymmetry)? Or should the server accept messages with unwanted URLs and \nfields and simply toss them away?\n\nPete\n\n"}}
