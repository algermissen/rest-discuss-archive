An interesting question came up:\n\nLet&#39;s say you have a distributed cache you want to manage through a \nRESTful interface.  One operation on the cache is clearing or flushing \nit.  The interesting thing about flushing is that the act of flushing \nchanges the state of the cache, but &quot;flushing&quot; isn&#39;t a state of the \ncache itself.  It seems to be a pure operation.  How do you model \nsomething like this in REST?  Is it correct to do:\n\nPUT /cache/flusher  (PUT because flushing is idempotent)\n\nOr maybe even better:\n\nGET /cache\n\nreturns a document like\n\n&lt;cache&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;FLUSH&quot; href=&quot;/cache/flusher&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/cache&gt;\n\n\nOr maybe this is better:\n\nDELETE /cache/data\n\nMaybe I just answered my own question :)\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nBill\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
