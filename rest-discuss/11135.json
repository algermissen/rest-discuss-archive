I judge protocols on their\n&gt; merit. If a protocol is the best solution for the use cases it\n&gt; was designed for, it will surface to the top. But I won&#39;t\n&gt; recommend unnecessary complexity to promote a spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the long term, that does more harm than good. I&#39;m actually\n&gt; surprised that we&#39;re not looking at the WS-* agenda games as a\n&gt; lesson learned. I&#39;m not convinced the answer is more politics,\n&gt; and I&#39;m very worried about cargo culting.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s our job to recommend the best technology we know is\n&gt; sufficient to solve the problem at hand. And sometimes that\n&gt; means saying &quot;No. Not for this use case. Use your head, use\n&gt; [that] instead.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hammering is something WS-* has suffered from, and I&#39;d hate to\n&gt; see the same happen to REST, because once the false claims turn\n&gt; into broken promises, all that&#39;s left is backlash, and backlash\n&gt; has a way of diminishing the value of even the best\n&gt; technologies.\n\nYou seem to have lost the plot. Do you accept that having fewer,\nmore generically useful media types is good REST design? Is that\nfor political reasons, too? If you find it acceptable, why do you\naccept the technical reasoning there but characterise it as\ndespicable politics in protocols?\n\n&gt; I&#39;m seeing too many people enveloping everything they send with\n&gt; AtomPub, for no reason other than it&#39;s AtomPub, so it might be\n&gt; good, right? I see people who don&#39;t bother to learn REST, they\n&gt; just envelope with AtomPub â€” enveloping is easy, architecture\n&gt; style is hard. They&#39;re not even using it right, but they marked\n&gt; the checkbox, and yes, there&#39;s one case involving wrapping RPC\n&gt; calls inside AtomPub.\n&gt;\n&gt; So when the time comes and we get to see SOAP passing over the\n&gt; wire, except the envelope is called AtomPub, would we stand\n&gt; back and smile and think to ourselves &quot;mission accomplished&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; AtomPub is a good solution, just not the best solution to every\n&gt; problem. Using it like a hammer would be worse than not using\n&gt; it enough, possibly the worst thing that could happen to it.\n\nHTTP has been suffering from a massive case of hammering for a\ndecade.\n\n&gt; We need to teach developers how to engineer the right solution,\n&gt; that&#39;s the only way they could rise to the problem, not help\n&gt; them cargo cult the next shiny spec or the next best whatever.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see enough of that, and quite frankly it saddens me and\n&gt; in some way even scares me.\n\nCargo cult happens. You cannot stop it. All you can do is design\nfor surviving it. The technologies that succeed in the long term\nare those that have been so designed. People are morons; this is\nnot a bug.[1]\n\n[1]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
