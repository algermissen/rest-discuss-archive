But I don&#39;t want the clients\n&gt; &gt; needing to know what the server intends to do. I&#39;d like to expose the\n&gt; &gt; resource as the &#39;current status&#39; - no assumptions about &#39;extending&#39; an\naudit\n&gt; &gt; trail - and so I used PUT.  If the server chooses to keep history, then\nI\n&gt; &gt; suppose a new resource is needed for the audit trail - which would be a\n&gt; &gt; collection of previously PUT entities.\n&gt;\n&gt; The above paragraph seems to imply that you are thinking of something\n&gt; different for status than simple ACKs.\nThe status messages are just advisory and notify the sender of the biz docs\nprocess through the receivers business process.\nIf the receiver&#39;s business process spawns multiple biz docs, then the status\nnotifications shouldn&#39;t be used - since they are only &#39;advisory&#39;. The new\nbusiness docs should be sent to the sender - probably as a POST to the\nReply-To location. I&#39;m using POST here to &#39;extend&#39; the originating document\nwith related material. The Reply-To in the example says &#39;.../ack&#39; so maybe\nsomething isn&#39;t quite right.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you thinking of Delivery and Payment as statuses?  If so, I got\n&gt; an argument for you...\n&gt;\nUm, not sure what a &#39;status&#39; is - but my notification would be advisory and\nreal biz docs would deserve real URI based exchange.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
