Possibly. I think the discussion would be more interesting\nif someone would present a workable proposal how to implement this, without\nlosing the PROPFIND/depth 1 functionality of WebDAV.\n\nBTW: HEAD gets a fixed set of properties (entitity headers) as well. It&#39;s\nnot really different from PROPFIND/depth 0. So is HEAD unRESTful?\n\n&gt; right. Adding verbs for locking or other strange things with new and\n&gt; unusual semantics would certainly be a good idea though...\n\nCorrect. The interesting part is to decide wether a specific feature should\nbe a new verb or can be &quot;tunnelled&quot; through existing methods.\n\n\n\n"}}
