Having looked at OpenSearch, it&#39;s not very clear to me where it shows a walk through from the initial URL request all the way through an example. I did however see the response they return includes &lt;url..&gt; elements with a type=&quot;...&quot; that explains the media type for that resource. So I am unclear as to why what I am doing is incorrect.\n\nI am sorry Jan, but your responses don&#39;t seem to help much unfortunately. If anything, they confuse me even more. \n\nYou&#39;ve responded on several occasions that it&#39;s all about the media types, yet when I ask you how a response that returns with different resources that can be used would instruct a non-human machine on what media type to use when using the resource, I don&#39;t get a clear cut example or response. Specifically I am trying to understand how either a human or a machine can make use of one of potentially several different resources it receives from a previous request, and properly set the Content-Type to the right media type when making the request to the resource. If my response returns five different resources that a machine/client can use, and I don&#39;t specify media types that are to be set to use those resources, they can&#39;t just know it. There has to be a way a machine could discover the right media type to use with no prior info on the resource. If I upgrade my server and add three new resources, the machine/client should be able to use them simply by the\n &lt;link..&gt; info returned.\n\nHaving read several articles/blogs on the subject, along with many threads here, I am simply not digesting the initial published URL request/response.. what the response might look like. If you could be so kind as to provide an example of what a response might look like for a simple webcart service, or some other service, that might offer a few sub-services initially, that would be most beneficial. Prior to all this HATEOAS stuff, I simply provided a SDK document with info on the resources, what they accepted, what they may return, what they were used for. Now it seems the REST/HATEOAS way is to not provide that sort of document, instead just publish a single URL and the client can learn what is possible simply by making a request to this one URL. So throw me a bone here would ya.. don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s about the media types..I know this.. show me with a simple snippet and some info on the makeup of the response or something to better illustrate this. \n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1904030369-1269488110=:49332\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hi Jan, et all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What assumptions exactly am I incorrect on?
