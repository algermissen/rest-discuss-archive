Now, if we want to access a resource, what\n&gt; is the best way the client can specify the response format to the server?\n&gt; \n&gt;   /endpoint/&lt;ep_id&gt;?format=XML  \n&gt; or \n&gt;   /endpoint/&lt;ep_id/xml\n\nFirstly, the client isn&#39;t going to know the URI until it receives the \nrepresentation that contains the reference to it, so whatever URI is \nmost convenient for the server will do fine. As far as the client is \nconcerned either of those or indeed, /animal/crackers/in/my%20soup are \nall fine. Indeed, the client could be given a URI that is handled by a \ndifferent server. The only URI the client will need a priori knowledge \nof is the &quot;starting point&quot;, the resource that describes other relevant \nresources and lets the client make use of the application as a whole.\n\nIs there any reason for the XML and JSON representations to be \nconsidered different resources? If not, then the client should just send \nan accept header giving its preferences.\n\n\n"}}
