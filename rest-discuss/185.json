Just recognize that you&#39;re doing this,\n&gt; and don&#39;t try to pretend that you&#39;re doing HTTP behind the gateway\n&gt; or that will just cause more trouble.\n&gt;\n\nIf I wanted to model the resource system as an addressable collection of\nmessages, what would the HTTP requests and responses look like? Especially\nif those messages were literally HTTP request and response formats? Like\nblindly logging all web server activity and having an analysis program\nconsume those from disk via HTTP.\n\n"}}
