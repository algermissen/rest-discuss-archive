Suppose the\n&gt; application is to=\r\n index a bunch of web sites then the intended server\n&gt; side component type =\r\nis something like &#39;any&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is, I think, also reasonable to ask whethe=\r\nr there is some sort of\n&gt; primary application for a given server component =\r\nthat defines its\ntype.\n\nType is an illusion. Bunchtype doubly so.\n\nIt&#39;s dif=\r\nficult for &#39;types&#39; based on goals to &quot;come into being&quot; since\nthey do not, i=\r\nn fact, exist. Clients may perceive that they do exist,\nuntil Amazon morphs=\r\n from an online book seller to an online marketplace\nfor everything to an o=\r\nnline rating system to an online community forum\nwithout ever flipping its =\r\n&#39;type&#39; bit from one state to another. Servers\nmay believe that they exist, =\r\nuntil a client tracks updates to a bunch of\nbooks instead of buying them.\n\n=\r\nA goal is not merely the recognition of a domain, or even a range.\n&quot;These a=\r\npples are red&quot; does not define a goal. &quot;I will buy red apples&quot;\ndoes, becaus=\r\ne it marks off the limits of an activity (purchasing) based\non the range of=\r\n a domain (red apples). Domain boundaries that have no\nrelationship to acti=\r\nvities are uninteresting; the set of red apples on\nits own is boring.\n\nThe =\r\n&quot;primary application&quot; could be defined as the set of state\ntransition paths=\r\n which the server developers desire most. But the degree\nto which clients a=\r\nctually follow those desired paths varies widely, and\nthen the representati=\r\nons vary widely, and then the states and paths\nthemselves vary widely, as t=\r\nhe business changes. RESTful systems support\nthis. Types and goals are mere=\r\nly momentary, mutable marketing.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n"}}
