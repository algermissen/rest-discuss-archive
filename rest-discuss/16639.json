The argument is that you can&#39;t just call\nanything that gets used self-descriptive by virtue of its being used --\nthat may be self-descriptive in the natural-language sense, but it\nisn&#39;t self-descriptive in the normative, technical sense.  It isn&#39;t\nself-descriptive &quot;enough&quot; to not be self-descriptive at all.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For one thing, a media type link could be followed by a human and the\n&gt; content perused.\n&gt; \n\nSo can a link relation link.  But how is that standardized?  REST isn&#39;t\nmeant to be a label that applies to any HTTP solution that works, or\neven that&#39;s scalable, it&#39;s meant to describe a subset of solutions that\nwork by using defined standards.  Changing how standards are defined is\na reasonable debate; it&#39;s even reasonable to debate whether\nstandardization is necessary in practice.\n\nIt isn&#39;t reasonable to argue that nonstandardized solutions are\nacceptable in REST, because that would be some other architectural\nstyle, by definition.  Unregistered identifiers aren&#39;t standardized,\ntherefore they aren&#39;t the REST style, even in &quot;spirit.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In any event, I&#39;m not anti-IANA - I just think that there needs to be\n&gt; better support for media type extensibility to greater specificity.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t disagree with that at all.  I can think of half a dozen reasons\noff the top of my head, for why the IANA registry is broken and needs\nto be fixed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to blame application/xml and others for basically defining\n&gt; how to structure a glob of data but not what it means . Also, to be\n&gt; honest, I consider that saying that you can&#39;t be self-descriptive\n&gt; unless your specific subtype is registered with the IANA is\n&gt; nonsensical (I gave the example of RSS in an earlier thread, but\n&gt; there are plenty of other well-known unregistered types and subtypes).\n&gt; \n\nBut that requires redefining the meaning of self-descriptive.  RFC 3023\ndefines +xml, meaning such types *may* be registered, it doesn&#39;t mean\nany +xml type *is* registered, let alone standardized.  It&#39;s nonsensical\nto me to treat this as a loophole around registration, or to state that\nsuch an unregistered type is self-descriptive -- self-descriptive means\nregistered, technically speaking.  Using +xml isn&#39;t some sort of\nautomatic standard, or even registered.\n\nBy stating that registration is unneccessary, the bar for self-\ndescriptiveness is raised to ubiquitous, i.e. tied to uptake, which\nisn&#39;t the point of the constraint.  Self-descriptive has nothing to do\nwith uptake, which is reasonable, because otherwise we have to\ndetermine at what point an identifier becomes ubiquitous enough to be\ndeemed self-descriptive (which requires redefining self-descriptive,\nfirst).\n\nWithout redefining the term, there is no way that any unregistered\nmedia type, no matter how ubiquitous, can possibly qualify -- that\nisn&#39;t what the term means.  My cousin isn&#39;t my brother even if we&#39;re so\nclose that he&#39;s my bro -- technically speaking.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If the IANA were to offer some procedure by which I could easily\n&gt; register my application/vnd.something-specific+xml then I would be\n&gt; happier, but they don&#39;t...\n&gt;\n\nAgreed, but this problem may be solved without changing the definition\nof self-descriptive such that we don&#39;t need to solve this problem.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ...and the pragmatic reality of web dev is that absent an easy type /\n&gt; subtype registration process, the types simply won&#39;t get registered\n&gt; (which, in practice, has little or no bearing upon their utility or\n&gt; how well-known they actually are).\n&gt; \n\nJust like self-descriptive says nothing about utility or ubiquity.  If\nthe mechanism for self-descriptiveness is broken, then it needs fixing.\nAbandoning the constraint because it&#39;s too hard in practice, isn&#39;t the\nsolution.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I floated my idea simply because it&#39;s an obviously easy way to\n&gt; federate registration. I&#39;m not sure how broad a change it implies to\n&gt; the existing standards stack (it may even be a very significant\n&gt; change for all I know) but that need not necessitate calling it a bad\n&gt; idea (although I acknowledge it might warrant calling it impractical)\n&gt; but I don&#39;t see standards are requiring immutability anyway. There is\n&gt; work going on right now looking at how HTTP might be improved in the\n&gt; light of 1.1 having been around for over a decade, so it&#39;s not\n&gt; inconceivable that we could see an HTTP/1.2 at some point.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad idea; I&#39;m pushing back against the notion\nthat unregistered identifiers are self-descriptive because registries\nserve no purpose, in which case anything and everything is self-\ndescriptive, so what&#39;s the point of the constraint?\n\nBy definition, such a change would not be HTTP/1.2 because it requires\na new major version number to replace the IANA registry.  HTTP 1.2, or\neven HTTPbis, could be changed to define some other registry in\naddition to IANA.  I&#39;m trying to figure out what you mean to change,\nHTTP or MIME?  Either way may be a very good idea, I&#39;m not passing\njudgment -- only saying that self-descriptive requires registration, so\ndeclaring the IANA registry broken and not using it doesn&#39;t meet the\nconstraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
