One that I can think of right away is performing\n&gt; atomic updates across multiple resources.  The canonical,\n&gt; &quot;transfer funds between accounts&quot; example seems like a\n&gt; good use case to examine.\n\nI don&#39;t know yet whether RPC and REST are on two sides of a fence or two\nends of a spectrum. Is submitting a &quot;transfer order&quot; an RPC (because the\nmeaning is embedded in the message)? Well let&#39;s just say we can move it\npretty far to the REST side of the spectrum if we:\n\n * make the order addressable so that it can be referred to by anyone,\nanytime\n * describe the transfer order in an XML or RDF schema, in as rich a way\nas possible\n * make the URI for &quot;submit transfer order for this account&quot; a hyperlink\nfrom the account object\n * separate the URI for &quot;submit transfer order&quot; from the URIs for &quot;pay\nbills from this account&quot; and &quot;get information about this account&quot; and\n&quot;withdraw money from this account&quot;\n * if transfer orders can be removed, updated or read, use standard HTTP\nmethods to do so\n * make a GET on the URI for &quot;submit transfer order&quot; return something\nthat lists the current orders and perhaps describes what will happen\nwhen new orders are submitted (prose or machine readable?)\n\nHopefully these will help someone.\n\nHere&#39;s a way of thinking about it: consider an intermediary or third\nparty shown a single message. The more they know without understanding\nthe domain, the better. With GET, PUT and DELETE you know a bunch\nwithout knowing much about either the resource types or the\nrepresentations. With POST, you usually need to know more about resource\ntypes but if you don&#39;t need to know data format then you are still\nmaking progress. A POST to a transfer order submission URI is going to\ncreate a money transfer document -- the exact representation is only\nneeded if you care who is receiving the money and how much money is\nbeing received. If you need to know both the resource type and the data\nformat to know anything interesting about what&#39;s going on then you&#39;re\ndoing RPC. e.g. if you have a &quot;submit something&quot; resource and what\nhappens is entirely dependent on what you submit.\n\nAnother random thought: Moving data between accounts is not in general\nan atomic operation. One bank has to debit the money and the other\ncredit it. When they are the same bank they can present the illusion of\natomicity but more generally the operation involves a perhaps unreliable\nthird party. That suggests to me that using resources rather than\nstateful messages is a better way to keep everyone aligned and in\nagreement about what&#39;s going on. When we start to involve various\nindependently controlled parties we have to relax our requirements of\natomicity and figure out how to get work done without it.\n\nSo basically I think that doing a POST of a &quot;money transfer order&quot; is a\nbetter model than doing an RPC and therefore I disagree with Sam Ruby\nthat this example exposes a limitation of the REST model.\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
