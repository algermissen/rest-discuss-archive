It actually says so right there in the thesis.  You&#39;re\nfree to disagree with the thesis, but it would probably help those\ntrying to learn REST if you&#39;d teach them what the thesis says, instead\nof teaching your disagreement with it, unless you can phrase that\ndisagreement in the language of software architecture rather than\nhyperbole.\n\nA media type is metadata, not the data format itself.  Self-descriptive\nmessaging (on the Web) requires IANA registration, because no value\nthat isn&#39;t in the registry meets the definition of a media type, and no\nother registry exists.  Achieving the desirable properties of the REST\nstyle depends upon standardization of data types, but only using media\ntypes (meaning, values appearing in the registry) is a constraint.\nCustomizing your own data types which nobody will ever adopt, when\nubiquitous data types exist which will work well enough, is a REST\nanti-pattern.\n\nBut, this sounds like a case where a new *standardized* data type is\nexactly what we&#39;re talking about.  So what on Earth is the rationale\nbehind your argument against registering a media type for it?  Roy&#39;s\nthesis explains the rationale behind the constraint in question, which\nseems like pragmatic goals for Web-based systems and mentions nothing\nabout heads exploding; so I would expect your rebuttal to explain how\nportability is achieved in a distributed hypertext style based on\nbespoke data types, backed up by reference to known architectural\nstyles which exhibit portability _without_ &quot;constrain[ing] the data\nelements to a set of standardized formats.&quot;\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
