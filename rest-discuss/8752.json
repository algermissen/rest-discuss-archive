There are ongoing debates as to which one is better suited in\ntoday&#39;s highly interactive environment. However, recent efforts,\nincluding Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2.0, have tried to\ngive Web services the ability to benefit from REST and use REST concepts.\nThe HTTP binding specification, available in WSDL 2.0 adjuncts, talks a\nlot about this. The first part of this article focuses on how REST is\nmarried to Web services in WSDL 2.0. The second part explains how it&#39;s\nbeing implemented in the Apache Web services project. Does WSDL 2.0\nenable REST? The motivation of WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding is that it allows\nservices to have both SOAP and HTTP bindings. The service implementation\ndeals with processing application data, often represented as an XML\nelement, and the service doesn&#39;t know whether that data came inside a\nSOAP envelope, HTTP GET, or HTTP POST. WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding enables\nyou to expose a service as a resource to be invoked using HTTP methods.\nAt the same time, you need to understand that HTTP binding doesn&#39;t\nenable you to implement a full REST style system. This is often debated\nby a lot of people, and it all depends on how much you believe in what\nREST can deliver.\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-rest1/\n\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
