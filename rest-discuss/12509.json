I have a launching custo=\r\nmer testing the API from their perspective. Just now a developer of theirs =\r\nran into my office. He wanted to catch (4xx and 5xx) errors. \n\nNow my appli=\r\ncation can return a 403 response code for several reasons. In the body of t=\r\nhe response I have a human readable error message explaining why things wen=\r\nt awry.\n\nHere&#39;s the problem, he wants to act different on different types o=\r\nf 403 response codes. If only to notify the user in different ways. My erro=\r\nr message can not (always) be copied 1-to-1 to their frontend. \n\nWhat is he=\r\n to do? Match on the possible changing human readable error message? Obviou=\r\nsly this is very brittle.\nPass my error message to their frontend? More oft=\r\nen than not this is not desirable.\nOr should I include an error identifier =\r\nin the response body? So that he may match on that. This introduces a fair =\r\nbit of coupling which I don&#39;t like at all and feels very unRESTful.\n\nThe on=\r\nly semi-helpful post I found was this one: http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/40=\r\n09\n\nI would very much appreciate your help.\n\nWith kind regards,\nHarm\n\n\n"}}
