All this hand-wringing is a result of people\nclaiming that the meaning of a PUT request depends on the server\nimplementation. The result of the message is what differs based on\nserver implementation.\n\n&gt; What\n&gt; I recall is that there was no consensus that Atom servers must choose &quot;omit\n&gt; == unset&quot; as opposed to &quot;omit == don&#39;t care&quot;, and it&#39;s therefore unspecified\n&gt;  (by AtomPub) what happens when you omit a field.\n\nI don&#39;t care if AtomPub came to consensus on the wrong answer.\n\n&gt; Note that any client that\n&gt; cares about this must have already retrieved the original data it&#39;s\n&gt; modifying and it only wanders into unspecified territory if it starts\n&gt; dropping fields in the round-trip.  If someone else thinks there was\n&gt; actually consensus on this point please let the AtomPub editor know about\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n\nAgain, AtomPub&#39;s consensus doesn&#39;t matter. What you&#39;re saying is that\nthere&#39;s no way for an Atom client to decide that an entry doesn&#39;t need\na summary anymore. Broken.\n\n&gt; Personally I like PATCH for clarity but worry about deployment\n&gt; issues with intermediaries and libraries that even today think &quot;all the\n&gt; world&#39;s a GET&quot;.  My next choice would be a POST with a standard delta update\n&gt; MIME type to the resource, though that&#39;s a fallback position obviously.  I\n&gt; look forward to seeing James Snell&#39;s proposed RFC on the subject.  Thoughts?\n\nXML deltas are incredibly complicated.\n\nMark Baker wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Unset&quot; suggests that the message, by leaving stuff out, is requesting\n&gt; that said stuff be explicitly set to something (like a default).\n\nNo, it doesn&#39;t. See the behavior of Apache when you send a PUT request\ncontaining an Atom entry. For &quot;unset&quot; to mean anything else, shared\nstate would be required.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
