In a restful \nsystem, the objects are identified\nby identifiers of a unique addressing space and all objects have a \nuniform API (all objects have the\nsame methods).\n\nIf you use HTTP,  the addressing spacxe is URI and the uniform API is \nthe collection of HTTP methods\n(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD..)\n\nGET http://www.foo.org/persons/bugsbunny HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.foo.org\n\nis &#39;just&#39; the invocation of the method &#39;GET&#39; on the object \n&#39;http://www.foo.org/persons/bugsbunny&#39;\n\nI have the impression that you understand &#39;resource&#39; to mean &#39;document&#39; \n(and the like). If so,\nthat is not how REST is defining &#39;resource&#39;.\n\nIf you have an OO background, thinking of &#39;resource&#39; as &#39;object&#39; gives \nyou the correct notion.\n\n&gt;I realize that to define this as a standard would go above the very \n&gt;nature of REST as a principle rather than a standard, but all good \n&gt;principles have standards underlying them.  Paul Prescod has a good \n&gt;article on &quot;why not&quot; I&#39;ve linked below, but somewhere behind why not \n&gt;lies a coder trying to make a choice:\n&gt;http://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding/\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHere is my suggestion:\n\n- if you build a system that is to interoperate with systems &#39;on the \ninternet&#39; (systems that you cannot control) try to use standardized MIME \ntypes for your representations. This will make interoperability more \nlikely. An example woul be to use NITF for news articles.\n\n- if you build a system solely ment for a domain you control (e.g. a \nparticular enterprise application), define your own \n(company-standardized) MIME types and documeent them well, to ease \nfuture integration with other systems (in the enterpise). Rely on public \nformats as much as possible\n\n- the best choice is maybe to use RDF, which offers the benefit that \nconsumers of the representations (the RDF messages)  can make use of \nthose portions of a message they understand as opposed to discarding the \ncomplete message if they do not understand the MIME type in the first \nplace. This benefit is called &#39;partial understanding&#39;.\n\nPlease make sure you look at Mark Baker&#39;s explanation[1], which is far \nsuperior to mine.\n\nI hope this helps to get you some entry points into REST space.\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2002/11/17#2002-11-rdf\n\n&gt;I&#39;m hoping this is not too off topic, I knew of no better place to turn \n&gt;to in this conundrum.\n&gt;\n&gt;Many thanks,\n&gt;Myren\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
