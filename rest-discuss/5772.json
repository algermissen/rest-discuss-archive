I&#39;m not sure if this\n&gt;&gt; is against REST per se... but it would not be best practice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I noticed that Roy&#39;s dissertation frowns upon using cookies and URL  \n&gt; rewriting for user sessions. I learned last week that the recommended  \n&gt; alternative is HTTP authentication. But try as I may I can&#39;t find a  \n&gt; way to use HTTP auth because of usability (can&#39;t give a nice login  \n&gt; page if JavaScript is disabled, hard or impossible to do single-sign  \n&gt; on, etc...) and security issues (can&#39;t tell the client to &quot;log them  \n&gt; off&quot; once authenticated, or force the client to ask for the name and  \n&gt; password again). The cookies I plan to use are really just auth  \n&gt; tokens, and I plan to try and avoid any real session state. So that  \n&gt; part is actually quite RESTful I think, at least in the area of  \n&gt; representing state with URIs. I feel trying to understand REST really  \n&gt; helped me in that area. But I&#39;ve found HTTP authentication in its  \n&gt; current form to be unusable in practice, at least for my current  \n&gt; requirements.\n\nDo you have a pointer for &quot;auth sessions are ok?&quot; I think the point is\nthat sessions are bad. Whether they&#39;re done with auth or not is not\nthe point.\n\nState should be created with a POST or a PUT into the resource space.\n\n\nPersonally I *do* use cookies for authentication. But I use them like\nbasic auth and I use them because it&#39;s not possible to alter the UI of\nbasic auth. O&#39;Reilly will be publishing an article about this\nsoon. I&#39;ll let the list know.\n\nAs long as cookies aren&#39;t used for sessions I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong\nwith them and how they can be anti-REST.\n\n\n&gt; Well then I guess you&#39;re right in that there&#39;s not much room in REST  \n&gt; for personalization of resources. Because putting the customization  \n&gt; state in the URI could be done, for example, by having the user&#39;s  \n&gt; nickname (such as &quot;chuck&quot;) in every URI after they log in. Yuck.  \n&gt; That&#39;s seems unRESTful because each conceptual resource has one URI  \n&gt; for each user. \n\nI think that is specifically forbidden in Roy&#39;s dissert on REST:\n\n  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\n\n\n&gt; What I find odd is how hard it is to accomplish by following the  \n&gt; official recommended HTTP way the simple basic things almost every  \n&gt; website wants to do.\n\nYes. Roy specifically talks about client side script in his\ndissertation as I recall.\n\nClient side stuff used to be hard but it isn&#39;t anymore.\n\nEverything else is a hack. Some pretty cool hacks, but hacks none the\nless.\n\nRemember also that REST is a style, so althorugh the rules are quite\nstrict you are free to break them. There&#39;s no API that&#39;s going to\nbreak if you don&#39;t do pure REST.\n\nIt&#39;s just that you will lose the benefits (such as scalability) to an\nextent.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
