This can be contrasted with the application \n&gt; state implied by the &#39;object&#39; of the request.\n\nAnd in REST we have no separate subject and object. We only have\nresources pointed to by URIs.\n\n\n&gt; I draw a firm distinction between these. Because I draw a firm \n&gt; distinction I can say that the &#39;subject&#39; can be transferred &#39;out of \n&gt; band&#39;, \n\nWhat does that mean? I&#39;m not sure what you mean by out of band.\n\n\n&gt; and therefore even though the &#39;session&#39; is a &#39;resource&#39; (in the \n&gt; sense that it&#39;s a &#39;semantic thing with state&#39;) it needn&#39;t be identified \n&gt; in the URI. Just like the &#39;resource&#39; related to the data in the \n&gt; HTTP-Auth header isn&#39;t identified by URI.\n\nThings I call resources are only identifed by URIs. The thing in the\nauthentication header is not a resource.\n\n\n&gt; I still don&#39;t understand what argument you&#39;ve presented against this [1] \n&gt; which makes this [2] a good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] Session 63e7e7 GETs /games/chess\n&gt; [2] GET /games/chess/63e7e7\n&gt;\n&gt; The only argument you&#39;ve made has been for caching. But you can use \n&gt; ETags for caching...\n\nHaving state in the resource means you don&#39;t need ETags for caching;\nyou can just use conditional-GET which is simpler.\n\n\nBut I understand the point you&#39;re making which is &quot;what&#39;s the real\ndifference?&quot;\n\nThe real difference is that you have to add a session identifier to\nthe request to access the state and then you have to add ETags if you\nwant it cached properly. But if you store the state in the resource\nthen those things aren&#39;t necessary; suddenly you&#39;re representing the\nstate directly.\n\nLook at it this way, if you store the state in the resource then you\ndon&#39;t NEED the session. Why would you add something that you don&#39;t\nneed?\n\nWhat are the advantages of sessions?\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
