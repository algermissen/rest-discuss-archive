Entity headers like Content-Type  \n&gt;&gt; provide metadata about the entity. What a given media type means is  \n&gt;&gt; something clients and servers learn out of band. This is true for  \n&gt;&gt; existing IANA media types as well as new media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, and that&#39;s not a good thing.  It means that user agents,  \n&gt; intermediaries, and servers must be revved simultaneously.  The cost  \n&gt; of &quot;educating&quot; end-points is so enormous that it should only be done  \n&gt; as a collective effort (I did a post on this some weeks ago showing  \n&gt; the information theoretical justification for this).  It also means  \n&gt; that there is no graceful degradation since either a MIME type is  \n&gt; known or it&#39;s not.  And it doesn&#39;t set the stage for serendipitous  \n&gt; engineering, imo.\n\nSteve - that is what I was referring to as the misinterpretation.  \nContrary to what you are saying, media types encourage shared formats.  \nIn the absence of that, we have fragmented apps today.\n\nJust imagine Flickr, Picasa Web, Panoramio and others using a shared  \nmedia type for managing photos. Since there is no such thing, what do  \nwe have today? Point-to-point integrations that are not portable. That  \nis the opposite of &quot;serendipitous engineering&quot;.\n\nSee Dare Obasanjo&#39;s post [1] where he uses contacts/address book APIs  \nas an example. The outcome is the same - fragmentation. I would also  \ninclude [2] in that bucket. OpenSocial has an opportunity to get it  \nright, but I am not aware of any move in that direction.\n\nHere is what is happening today. Most server applications are  \nexpecting client developers to do one of the following kinds of  \nprogramming:\n\nif(someFunc(uri1)) // i.e. determine the kind of the URI used\n{\n     doBlah();\n}\nelse if(someFunc(uri2))\n{\n     doBlahBlah();\n}\n\nThe second category of code is the following for textual document  \ntypes such as XML, Atom and JSON.\n\nobj = parseResponse(...);\nif(&quot;foo&quot;.equals(obj.rootElemName)) // Or some nested element or a JSON  \nproperty\n{\n     doBlah();\n}\nelse if(&quot;bar&quot;.equals(obj.rootElemName)) {\n     doBlahBlah();\n}\n\nThe first approach introduces coupling between URIs and clients while  \nthe second expects the clients to guess the type of the representation  \nby parsing it. As late Alan Flavell wrote in [3], content-type  \nguessing was a source of a number of bugs in IE. This is not to say  \nthat these two styles of code must be avoided at all cost.  \nNonetheless, if applied at the root level, they tantamount to media  \ntype tunneling, and tunneling, in general, is sub-optimal.\n\nConsequently, most developers are trying to look for schemas, WADL and  \nthe like to simplify this mess, which undermines the uniform interface  \n- please see some recent threads on why.\n\nBy the way, using the right HTTP method for the right operation is  \njust part of applying the uniform interface.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The moment you start overloading media types, that visibility  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be gone. Also note that this is a problem with any payload  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; format, including Atom.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Would the web really have scaled as well as it did if we had &quot;text/ \n&gt;&gt;&gt; login+html&quot;, &quot;text/checkout+html&quot; instead of only &quot;text/html&quot;?   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; What if a page allows both operations, does it become &quot;text/login \n&gt;&gt;&gt; +checkout+html&quot;?  I&#39;m a bit wary about manifesting the intent at  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; that level.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The answer is simple. Are clients required to apply special  \n&gt;&gt; processing rules to any of these?\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe yes, maybe no... that&#39;s the point.  A server cannot and should  \n&gt; try to anticipate everything the client wants to do.  Instead, it  \n&gt; should package up the information into a &quot;document&quot; that is self- \n&gt; descriptive and not application specific (i.e. application/xhtml+xml  \n&gt; vs. application/vnd.xyz+xml).\n\nHow about using SOAP then? I am not asking sarcastically. A lot in the  \nindustry consider SOAP as a self-describing format. By looking at the  \nSOAP headers, and the namespace of the body&#39;s content, one should be  \nable to figure out how to process a message. So, why not?\n\n&gt; Preliminary experimentation with using XHTML as standard MIME type  \n&gt; for web-services has been quite positive, but I haven&#39;t applied to a  \n&gt; product yet.  And I know from my write up about the cost of custom  \n&gt; MIME types, that using this approach is awfully expensive in the  \n&gt; grand scheme of things.  Hence, using established hypermedia formats  \n&gt; should be preferred.  However, since cost is bound by the total  \n&gt; population of user agents which need to know about it, it&#39;s  \n&gt; negligible for private, in-house, custom made applications.\n\nSee the examples above, which show that not introducing media types  \ncan become awfully expensive. Once you have a media type, there is at  \nleast a chance for someone else to reuse it or collaborate with you on  \nimproving it.\n\n&gt; So, in conclusion, I agree with you that the answer varies, but I  \n&gt; believe the outcome is not driven by the application, but its reach  \n&gt; (which you may have alluded to already by stating interoperability  \n&gt; and compatibility).  The more user agents there are interacting with  \n&gt; your API, the more driven you should be to fit it into an  \n&gt; established MIME type.\n\nCompatibility considerations do sometimes require introducing new  \nmedia types.\n\nSubbu\n\n[1] http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/10/24/RESTAPIDesignInventMediaTypesNotProtocolsAndUnderstandTheImportanceOfHyperlinks.aspx\n[2] http://www.opensocial.org/Technical-Resources/opensocial-spec-v081/restful-protocol\n[3] http://www.alanflavell.org.uk/www/content-type.html\n\n"}}
