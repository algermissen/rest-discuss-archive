REST\nmay become unfeasible as a model for browser-based system performance,\nwhich hardly means it won&#39;t continue to be the ideal, or that resources\nwill cease to exist as an abstract concept even if TAG replaces the term\nin AWWW v2.\n\nIt merely opens the door for exactly what Mike just said -- leadership\non features/performance passes to native apps which aren&#39;t precluded\nfrom leveraging REST to the hilt.  The problem with declaring REST a\ndinosaur (and deprecating application/xhtml+xml, removing Content-Type,\nignoring interoperability in favor of versionless &quot;standards&quot; etc.), is\nit&#39;s still adapted to its environment -- HTTP over an anarchic, end-to-\nend Internet, no habitat loss I can see...\n\nPersonally, I find the UX I&#39;m subjected to on most every site could\nstill benefit from the developers undertaking to learn a bit about\nREST even though everything about it except buzzwordiness has gone out\nof vogue lately, to the point I find it pointless to continue to comment\non www-tag, particularly as my concern about updating HttpRange-14 not\nonly wasn&#39;t responded to but judging by the minutes, wasn&#39;t even\nconsidered.  It&#39;s been shown that sniffing binaries is a security hole,\nbut I guess we&#39;ll just put out those fires as they flare up for the\nsake of not having to talk about resources/representations even though\nit&#39;s also been shown [3] that resources exist.\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\n-Eric\n\n[1]\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013AprJun/0001.html\n[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2013Jun/0014.html\n[3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2013Jun/0028.html\n\n"}}
