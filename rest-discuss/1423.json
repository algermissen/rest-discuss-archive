REST is a paradigm and a set of patterns. HTTP can be used \n&gt;for an implementation of REST, but isn&#39;t the perfect embodiment of REST. \n\nIs it me, or does this sound strangely close to the thinking that brought about Don Box&#39;s notorious &quot;HTTP is Dead&quot; keynote?  Replace REST with SOAP in the last sentence, and what do you have?  Put another way, is there a meaningful non-HTTP implementation of REST out in the wild?  Sorry, but I really tripped on this statement.  Would anybody care to expand on it?  \n\n"}}
