The only concern is or backwards compatibil=\r\nity.  Say I\n&gt; have a resource representation that is not following the conv=\r\nention because\n&gt; I didn&#39;t really understand the convention or didn&#39;t follow=\r\n it the way it\n&gt; will be interpreted.  For example, take the media type dis=\r\ncussed in the\n&gt; previous post  that you mention, text/form+html.  Hypotheti=\r\ncally, if I am\n&gt; producing that as a media type but really what I am sendin=\r\ng is a snippet\n&gt; that is not a valid HTML document, is there any reason to =\r\nfear that anything\n&gt; would stop working if proxies started interpreting tha=\r\nt media type to expect\n&gt; valid HTML? &lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This situation would be t=\r\nhe same as not adhering to any other media type,\n&gt; i think. In fact your sn=\r\nippet would not even be a valid representation of\n&gt; the &quot;derived&quot; media typ=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I think, the only contraint would be, that e.g. a VALID\n&gt; &quot;app=\r\nlication/atom+xml&quot; representation is still a valid &quot;application/xml&quot;\n&gt; repr=\r\nesentation. As far as i know, this is anyway state of the art. it is\n&gt; just=\r\n not standardized (except for XML Media types [1]).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The backward =\r\ncompatibilty is also given for intermediaries: if they do\n&gt; know the deriva=\r\ntion concept, the visibility increases. if they do not know\n&gt; the correlati=\r\non, they would handle such a media type as an unknown media\n&gt; type. like an=\r\n intermediary today, who knows xml but not atom, would ignore\n&gt; atom docume=\r\nnts.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; [1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jakob Strauch&quot; &lt;jakob.strauch@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Due to previous posts [1] i was asking myself, if it would make sen=\r\nse\n&gt; to standarize the usage of the + sign in media type indications.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think the benfit would be, that a more specific media type like\n=\r\n&gt;  &quot;application/odata+atom+xml&quot; (which is currently not existing) could be =\r\nat\n&gt; least interpret as &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; (which is currently the medi=\r\na type\n&gt; of an odata resource [2]).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; An intermediary could loo=\r\nk at the media type\n&gt; &quot;application/odata+atom+xml&quot; and could interpret it a=\r\ns a known atom\n&gt; representation, even if he don=B4t know the odata media ty=\r\npe. If atom is also\n&gt; unknown, maybe he is interessted, that it=B4s a valid=\r\n xml document, too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This seems to be just an convention at th=\r\ne moment or standarized only\n&gt; for xml-based documents [3].
