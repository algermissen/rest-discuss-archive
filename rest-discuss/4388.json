Similarly, I have found that client tools like curl and\n&gt; lwp-request make you jump through hoops to use PUT.\n\ncurl -T filename url ?\n\n&gt; Conclusion: not ready for prime time.  If I, as a longtime Un*x geek, have\n&gt; hassles in using PUT, clients using my API and other programmers building\n&gt; similar RESTful web services will find it a serious problem.\n\n*shrug* works for me.  The only time I use POST for PUTting is to support\nbrowsers, which is only a small part of the systems I build.  I also\nalways control the Web server (at least so far).\n\nAsk your ISP to turn it on; if they care about developers, they might.\nThat&#39;s the only way things will improve.  But if you&#39;re happy to suck up\nthe architectural costs of using POST for PUT (which aren&#39;t that big,\nreally), more power to you.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
