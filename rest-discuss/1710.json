You\nstill need to p=\r\nick a serialization in order to be able to realize the\nthing.  And once you=\r\n&#39;ve picked a serialization, you are no longer a\nlayer because the serializa=\r\ntions themselves remain recognizable.\n\nI suppose that true layering is perh=\r\naps native to protocols, and doesn&#39;t\napply to data formats.  At least that =\r\nseems a reasonable hypothesis\nbased on this discussion.\n\nThanks for that te=\r\nxt from 2616 - it makes my point about HTTP/TCP, and\nsaves a response to Mi=\r\nles. 8-). In HTTP &quot;0.9&quot; and 1.0, there was\nactually some poor layering, bec=\r\nause a request was said to end if the\nconnection went down (I.e.

Yo=\r\nu won&#39;t find any\n&gt; mention of TCP in RFC 2616 (I hope - I don&#39;t have it han=\r\ndy) for\nexample,\n&gt; but XHTML couldn&#39;t exist without XML.\n\n&quot;HTTP communicati=\r\non usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The\ndefault port is TCP 80 =\r\n[19], but other ports can be used. This does not\npreclude HTTP from being i=\r\nmplemented on top of any other protocol on the\nInternet, or on other networ=\r\nks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport;\nany protocol that provides suc=\r\nh guarantees can be used; the mapping of\nthe HTTP/1.1 request and response =\r\nstructures onto the transport data\nunits of the protocol in question is out=\r\nside the scope of this\nspecification.&quot;\n\nBut you can imagine a similar state=\r\n for XHTML (in a world where there\nwere multiple competing markup language =\r\nsyntaxes):\n\n&quot;This does not preclude XHTML from being encoded in any other s=\r\nyntax.\nXHTML only presumes a concept of &#39;element&#39; and &#39;attribute&#39;. Blah bla=\r\nh\nblah blah.&quot; \n\nIn fact it is very trendy these days to define markup langu=\r\nages in terms\nof the &quot;infoset&quot; and say that &quot;any mapping from any syntax to=\r\n the\ninfoset is legal.&quot; So you could imagine an XHTML this is an extension =\r\nto\nthe &quot;infoset&quot; but the infoset would be a layer on top of XML itself.\n(af=\r\nter all, it has been implemented on top of relational databases etc.)\n\n&gt; A =\r\nHTTP connection isn&#39;t necessarily a TCP connection because of this.\n\nThe sa=\r\nme goes for many XML specifications. XHTML doesn&#39;t happen to have\nthat lang=\r\nuage in the spec because there is no real competitor to XML\n(though there a=\r\nre hardly competitors to TCP used much anymore either!).\n\n-- \nCome discuss =\r\nXML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, c=\r\nonferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememark=\r\nup.com/extreme/\n\n\n"}}
