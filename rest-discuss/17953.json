Then portraits of the members are requested, then arbitrary data\nfrom the full representation is requested in the collection so that N\nhundred HTTP requests don&#39;t have to be made for a particular feature.\n\nIs there any good research trading off the chattiness, cachability,\nlatency and redundancy of denormalized data in RESTful collection\nresources? Are there good rules of thumb to apply here. It&#39;s tempting\nto say do the N hundred HTTP requests and come back when you can show\nit&#39;s a problem, but that doesn&#39;t go down well...\n\nThanks,\n\nJim\n\n"}}
