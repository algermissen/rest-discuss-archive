Their purpose  \n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; discovered by inspection.  Of course, there are expectations when\n&gt;&gt; following a link and breaking these may cause confusion in the user\n&gt;&gt; agent even for humnas (for example, following a &quot;pay now&quot; link and\n&gt;&gt; arriving at a recipe for chocolate cake).  Furthermore, encoding the\n&gt;&gt; nature of the document in the content type, means that this\n&gt;&gt; information will be out-of-band, which may cause other complications.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a misinterpretation.\n\nSorry, but can you clarify if you simply don&#39;t agree with my  \ninterpretation or if you *know* that my interpretation is wrong?\n\n&gt; The idea behind using concrete media types is to keep the  \n&gt; interactions visible, i.e., we should be able to apply some amount  \n&gt; of processing without parsing the representation. That processing  \n&gt; could be in the form of routing at a proxy, prioritizing/ \n&gt; deprioritizing some messages, or applying different caching rules.\n\nThat can also be achieved by adding custom HTTP headers or known end- \npoints.  Since we&#39;re already talking about custom MIME types, I don&#39;t  \nthese alternatives as fundamentally different.  Either way, the proxy/ \ngateway knows about the application&#39;s intent, which means they are  \ncoupled.  Though headers would be more generic (or neutral in Nick- \nspeak).\n\n&gt; The moment you start overloading media types, that visibility would  \n&gt; be gone. Also note that this is a problem with any payload format,  \n&gt; including Atom.\n\nWould the web really have scaled as well as it did if we had &quot;text/ \nlogin+html&quot;, &quot;text/checkout+html&quot; instead of only &quot;text/html&quot;?  What  \nif a page allows both operations, does it become &quot;text/login+checkout \n+html&quot;?  I&#39;m a bit wary about manifesting the intent at that level.\n\n&gt; If visibility is of no importance for your applications, fine, use  \n&gt; HTML/XHTML, POX, Atom or whatever. If visibility is important, look  \n&gt; for or design concrete media types.\n\nSome concrete examples when to use one over the other could be  \nhelpful.  What kind of documents/applications require specialized MIME  \ntypes?  For instance, my above &quot;text/login+html&quot; types are probably  \nnot what you had in mind.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
