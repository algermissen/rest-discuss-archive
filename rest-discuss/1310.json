After all, it is what we&#39;ve been doing for years, there is a huge body of information out there on ways and means of  doing it effectively and as several people have highlighted recently, REST is more about resource (information/knowledge) modelling which by comparison is less widely known and less &#39;supported&#39; in the how-to sense - it is out of most developers&#39; comfort zones.\nThe issue of getting a handle on resource modelling, designing effective representations for REST-ified systems to deal in, is one with which I am currently struggling. A good starting point may be adding appropriate links to the resources page on the REST wiki. I&#39;m happy to do the maintenance if people would care to contribute appropriate links (either directly to me or to this list).\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
