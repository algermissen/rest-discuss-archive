It\n&gt; tends to reduce the serendipity that normally occurs with rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thin representations in a thin/fat pair tend to be narrowly focus\n&gt; on some particular use case.  Usually multiple uses will emerge that\n&gt; could almost, but not quite, use the thin representation because it is\n&gt; a little too thin.  These use cannot all be accommodated ore the thin\n&gt; representation would become too &quot;fat&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nI agree with your assessment.  But there is a RESTful way to do this\nwhich results in the same application state regardless of fat vs. thin.\nI&#39;m working on implementing conneg on my demo, at this time the\nfollowing resource is defaulting to server-side transformation sent as\ntext/html:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/conneg/\n\nClients capable of performing XSLT transformations will soon be\ndetected, and served stub-file representations like you see here:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/xmltest/index.xht\n\nThe latter is definitely a thin representation compared to the former,\nassuming a user agent is capable of rendering it into an application\nstate.  The application state resulting from either representation is\nthe same, only if this weren&#39;t the case would I consider it a problem.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Having a multiple representation types also raises the cognitive\n&gt; effort required implement a client of the system.  Client implementers\n&gt; must understand both representations and decide which to use.  It also\n&gt; elevates the risk that a client implementer will decide your system is\n&gt; unsuitable because they do not understand that a more complete\n&gt; representation is available, since that information is only available\n&gt; out-of-band (ie, in the documentation which they might not bother to\n&gt; read).\n&gt; \n\nWhat I&#39;ve done is use &lt;link rel=&#39;alternate&#39;/&gt; to indicate what other\nrepresentations exist, and their respective media types, in-band.\nClient implementers are given an obvious choice of supporting XSLT or\nnot.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In my experience it is best to avoid the thin/fat representation\n&gt; approach and just have a single representation that has all the\n&gt; relevant information.  If that representation is very large it is\n&gt; often a good indication that one or more additional resources would\n&gt; useful for some of the information.  The original representation can\n&gt; then link to the resource(s) that contain the additional information.\n&gt; \n\nI agree 100%, if the variants don&#39;t yield the same application state,\nthen they&#39;re better off being separate resources.  I also agree 100%\nwith any approach resembling my own, which minimizes the amount of data\ntransferred where possible, falling back to a &#39;fat&#39; representation\nwhere not possible, provided the variants yield the same application\nstate.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
