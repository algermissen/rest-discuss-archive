I have some friends and we all=\r\n go to the online blackjack service.\nEach one of us enters the application,=\r\n which allows us to play BJ. The main screen requests our IDs. At the next =\r\nminute, we all but one are ready to play, that one not ready is because he =\r\nforgot the ID numbers. \nLet&#39;s see what happens there. We are, say, ten clie=\r\nnts, each one is using the application, and nine of which are ready to play=\r\n while one is waiting for ID input. As you can see, there is one applicatio=\r\nn, but each client has a different application state now. And each client k=\r\nnows its state clearly. \n\nSo, we left our friend finding his number and we =\r\nstarted to request cards. We knew there was a dealer at the other end of th=\r\ne line, but we were not able to know if we were all playing with the same d=\r\nealer!\nStill, there was just one mass of cards. Yes, each card requested ch=\r\nanged the mass. Still more, each request may be served by a different deale=\r\nr!\n\nHere, the mass of cards is a resource, the dealers are the servers. \nNo=\r\nw, can you clearly see the difference of the states? Each request will chan=\r\nge the resource state, but that is not the app state. Each client has its o=\r\nwn state of the game, and that is the app state.\nThe actual server state ma=\r\ny be dealer working or dealer in a break. So server state is actually anoth=\r\ner very different thing.\n\nSo, what is the REST constrain here? Well, if you=\r\n program the dealer to know the hand of each client, you are violating REST=\r\n, since then the server is actually controlling the state of the app for ea=\r\nch user. \nThe idea is the client controls its app state, not the server. So=\r\n, even when the client wins the hand, it will have to show it to the dealer=\r\n, saying I won. And the dealer will give me the lollipop gift. And after th=\r\nat the dealer will wait again for another request.\nEach request will contai=\r\nn all the information needed to be totally completed in one interaction. Th=\r\ne sum of all interactions is your final goal, the application.\nAlso note th=\r\ne resource can be changed in the process, but that is not an app change.\n\nW=\r\nhy is all that setup good? Well, you can have thousands of clients that it =\r\nwill not impact servers, since they not keep track of the hands. You can ad=\r\nd or remove dealers with no impact on the clients nor in the application st=\r\nates. You keep hidden the resource implementation. And you got then a nicel=\r\ny distributed game, scalable and simple.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nWilliam Martine=\r\nz. \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mark Baker &lt;distobj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; On Fri, Oct 2, 2009 at 4:56 AM, Kristian Nordal\n&gt; &lt;kristian.nordal@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also struggling with the difference between application stat=\r\ne and\n&gt; &gt; server state (which I assume is the same as &quot;resource state&quot;). Ca=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; someone point me to a good definition of &quot;application state&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n&#39;s literally the *state* of the *application*.  If you&#39;re looking at\n&gt; your=\r\n bank balance, that&#39;s a different state than if you were preparing\n&gt; to sub=\r\nmit a bill payment, and once you&#39;ve submitted the payment,\n&gt; you&#39;re in yet =\r\nanother state in the application state machine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
