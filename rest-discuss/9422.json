As Mark said.\n\n&gt; or 410 response does not mean there are no representations available\n&gt; for the requested resource -- they _are_ representations of the requested\n&gt; resource, according to REST.\n\nAt this point, I really don&#39;t care about REST. REST is an interesting \ntopic, but it doesn&#39;t override what RFC2616 says.\n\n&gt;  &gt;Yes, it carries an entity. But no, the ETag header does not apply to the\n&gt;  &gt;entity being returned, but to the entity available on the server.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh? The server just returned the entity available on the server. A\n&gt; 404 or a 410 response includes an entity, in response to a request for\n&gt; the resource. Perhaps they are representations of a &quot;null&quot; resource?\n\nIn general they are not representations of *any* resource (at least not \none with a URI known by the client). There are just messages.\n\n&gt;  &gt;ETag is not entity header field but a response header field, so the\n&gt;  &gt;information above does not apply (see Section 6.2 vs 7.1).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh? An ETag is both an entity header field and a response header.\n\nEric, please read the definitions in RFC2616. Not every header appearing \nin an HTTP response is a &quot;Response Header&quot;, as defined in Section 6.2.\n\n &gt;...\n&gt; Sorry, no sale. Maybe you can explain just what REST constraint is\n&gt; broken by applying an ETag to a 410 response, or perhaps explain just\n&gt; what it is that can go wrong. If there is some actual downside to\n\nAgain, all I&#39;m concerned with is how HTTP is used here. I don&#39;t care \nabout REST concepts right now.\n\n&gt; this, I would be more receptive of your arguments. But if it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make any &quot;bad things&quot; happen, wouldn&#39;t that tend to support my argument?\n\nNo, it just means that you are using HTTP machinery in a way not \nsanctioned by the spec, so basically you&#39;re inventing a new protocol.\n\n&gt; I tend towards pragmatism, when I come up with something and it works as\n&gt; expected, and I can&#39;t find any negative effects, I tend not to believe\n&gt; that I&#39;ve broken any REST constraints or violated RFC 2616.\n\nInteresting approach.\n\n&gt; When I implement something and &quot;bad things&quot; do happen, then I stop\n&gt; myself and attempt to discern, through both RFC 2616 and REST, where it\n&gt; is I went wrong and why. Like my first shot at the double-DELETE, I\n&gt; discovered problems through testing, which led me to identify the error\n&gt; I was making in both REST and RFC 2616 terms. Now I&#39;ve fixed it, and\n&gt; believe it or not, putting an ETag on a 410 response doesn&#39;t cause the\n&gt; sky to fall. ;-) If there is some obscure, theoretical error\n&gt; remaining in the interaction that causes no ill effects then I question\n&gt; the theory, not my working code.\n\nIt&#39;s just something that is not compliant to RFC2616. You won&#39;t notice \nany  problems as long as you&#39;re just using your own client, no \nintermediaries, and so on.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n"}}
