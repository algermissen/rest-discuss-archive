If an order fulfillment service only deals with orders th=\r\nis may not be a problem, but if it also deals with invoices, a client would=\r\n have to inspect the representation to determine whether an &quot;order&quot; or a &quot;i=\r\nnvoice&quot; was returned.  I would think its needs to represent both applicatio=\r\nn context and data.\n\n\n"}}
