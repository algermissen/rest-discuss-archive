I&#39;m normally a lurker but I have a quetion for the group.\n\n=\r\nLet me paint the scenario for you:\n\nI have a Resource. If the User is anony=\r\nmous, when they GET the\nResource, the Representation returned displays one =\r\nset of information.\nHowever, if the User if of the type Admin, the Represen=\r\ntation returned\ndisplays the same information, but with additional informat=\r\nion\nrelevant to the Admin User.\n\nMy question is this: should the decision t=\r\no display this different\nresponse data rest with the Resource, or the Repre=\r\nsentation: that is,\nshould the Resource always return ALL the information, =\r\nregardless of\nthe User type, and let the Representation determine this info=\r\nrmation\nto be returned based on User type, or should the data the Resource\n=\r\nreturns be limited based on User type? The latter would, in effect\ncreate t=\r\nwo Resources, whereas the first would call the same Resource,\nand filter th=\r\ne response based on rules defined in the Representation.\n\nI feel that the R=\r\nesource should return all the information and that it\nis the responsibility=\r\n of the Representation to determine what is\ndisplayed. What do you guys thi=\r\nnk?\n\nCheers!\n\nBen\n\n\n\n"}}
