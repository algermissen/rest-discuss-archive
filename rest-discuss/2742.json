And I got busy with other things and never \nfollowed up properly.\n\nBut now I see an independent emergence of the same idea from Joe \nGregorio:\nhttp://bitworking.org/wellformed.html\n\nJoe&#39;s even got some implementation ideas.  And he refers to REST, as \nwell.\n\nPlus, I see Phil Eskelin noticed the idea:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/2706\n\nSo maybe it&#39;s worth porting to rest-discuss and see if&#39;s got legs.\n\nJoe and I had a little email exchange about it, as follows:\n\n[Joe, responding to my ping] Interesting. I had come at it from an \nRDF angle and not web services. Given the interest I&#39;ll try putting \ntogether a quick implementation of this.\n[Joe&#39;s article also spawned a thread on xml-dev]\nHave you done any work on an implementation?\n\n[Bob] No.  Busy with other things.\nWhere I was gonna focus next was on binding the bids to the ad, and \nthe ad to the winning bid.\nThen a little work on the non-repudiation angle - you don&#39;t really \nneed to repeat the representations, just the digests.\n[I was thinking of Paul&#39;s URL + hash format]\nThe other thing I was thinking is to relax the &quot;biddingEnds&quot; so as to \neliminate sniping.  Do it more like a regular auction - going, going, \ngone.  But of course at the option of the advertiser\n\n[Joe] Oooh, neat idea. If you think of it that way then this replaces \nauctions and classified ads all at the same time.\n\n[Bob] Yes.  What I have in mind is offers of all kinds:\noffers to sell, offers to buy, offers to barter, offers of services, \nyou name it.\nI don&#39;t see any reason why any of this stuff can&#39;t be decentralized.\n\n\n\n"}}
