How do I know that I can call PUT, =\r\nDELETE, GET or POST on that one url? By this I mean.. why should a client w=\r\naste another round trip hoping something works, when it might not. I much p=\r\nrefer something like:\n\n&lt;link rel=3D&quot;edit&quot; href=3D&quot;...&quot; type=3D&quot;...&quot; methods=\r\n=3D&quot;get,delete&quot;/&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t see why this is bad... it allows a client to sti=\r\nll discover the URL to call, but also provides the specific methods it can =\r\ncall on that URL at that time. It saves the client from making a request th=\r\nat will result in a method not allowed or some other error response. It als=\r\no saves the server side from inundated requests that are going to respond w=\r\nith errors that could quite easily be avoided by simply providing the metho=\r\nds allowed on the resource in the first place.\n\nIs there perhaps a better w=\r\nay to do what I&#39;ve said above?\n\nAs well, if I return a response with severa=\r\nl links, how do I specify in those the media types to use? For example, if =\r\nthe URL that was called is /orders and the media type is application/vnd.or=\r\ng.company.orders+xml, then I know that if the response comes back with link=\r\ns with /orders in it, I can use the same media type. But what if I return o=\r\nther links too, that allow a user to pull up history, using a history resou=\r\nrce, and some other things. Where do I specify the media type? Does the use=\r\nr discover this URL (link), then make an OPTIONS call to it to get the medi=\r\na type it should use for that resource?\n\nMy thought is something like\n\nGET =\r\n/orders\n\n&lt;links&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot; href=3D&quot;../orders&quot;/&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link rel=\r\n=3D&quot;edit&quot; href=3D&quot;../orders&quot;/&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link rel=3D&quot;history&quot; href=3D&quot;.../histor=\r\ny&quot; type=3D&quot;application/vnd.org.company.history+xml&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/links&gt;\n\nPerhaps we =\r\nprovide methods=3D&quot;...&quot; in the history link as well, allowing the client to=\r\n not only discover it, but know what methods can be performed on that url a=\r\nt that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-343282100-1269402359=:85443\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hi all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;Ok, but I am pretty s=\r\nure that this was not the original intention.
