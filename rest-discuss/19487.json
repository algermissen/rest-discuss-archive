At some point on an atom feed\nyou will hit the current item, prev will=\r\n point to the next item that\ndoes not yet exist. Most implementations I can=\r\n find 404 this uri and\nthe client has the logic to keep polling the 404. Th=\r\nis seems off to\nme, I would expect this to be a 204. Then if I change my ur=\r\ni structure\nit becomes a 404, otherwise it would seem that if I change my u=\r\nri\nstructure all prev uris would need to redirect to the new ones (which\nwo=\r\nuld be a rather large undertaking).\n\nI couldn&#39;t find any details on this in=\r\n relevant specs, has anyone seen this?\n\nCheers,\n\nGreg\n\n-- \nLe doute n&#39;est p=\r\nas une condition agr=E9able, mais la certitude est absurde.\n\n"}}
