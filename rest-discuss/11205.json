You use semantic technology like RDF/XML and\n=\r\nSPARQL (and probably reasoning?) to make it very easy to write client\ncode =\r\nfor interacting with a server (almost transparently) if I get i\nright?\n\nHow=\r\never, I think it might be difficult for other clients to use the\nservers, e=\r\nspecially if the clients are written with other programmring\nlanguages etc.=\r\n I mean the representations would change whenever you\nchange the object mod=\r\nel because The RDF vocabulary are generated from\nthe (Java) object model ri=\r\nght? And also the RDF models are implicit in\nthe Java object model so a non=\r\n-Qi4j client cannot download an RDF\nschema and perform its own reasoning ri=\r\nght? (perhaps it would be\npossible to generate and export such a schema? an=\r\nd maybe you already\ngenerate such as schema internally?)\n\nI guess since the=\r\nre&#39;s probably not enough existing (RDF) vocabularies\nout there that you cou=\r\nld use, you have to create your own sometimes.\nBut what if you had a Person=\r\n model that correlated pretty much with a\nfoaf:Person, or a Project model t=\r\nhat where almost a fit with\ndoap:Project, could you then use these (with th=\r\ne correct namespaces\netc.)? I think that would be of great value to other n=\r\non-Qi4j clients,\nand expose more of the potential from having a RESTful int=\r\nerface.\n\n- Erling\n\nOn Fri, Aug 15, 2008 at 3:31 PM, Rickard =D6berg &lt;rickar=\r\ndoberg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working on an application dev=\r\nelopment framework in Qi4j for\n&gt; some time now, and just added some REST fe=\r\natures that might be\n&gt; interesting for you. Basically, the server can now e=\r\nxpose the state of\n&gt; any domain object as an RDF/XML document, and there&#39;s =\r\nalso a SPARQL\n&gt; endpoint which maps to the internal query services. On the =\r\nclient there\n&gt; is then Java libraries that use these to find and load/store=\r\n the data of\n&gt; the domain model. All in all this makes it possible to have =\r\na domain\n&gt; model in Java and work with it in clients (e.g. applets/JavaWebS=\r\ntart) as\n&gt; if they were not remote (basically the REST/SPARQL interface act=\r\ns like a\n&gt; remote database). If you&#39;re interested you can read more about i=\r\nt here:\n&gt; http://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/qi4j_rest_entitystore_and_sp=\r\narql\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really like to have feedback from you about these ideas, a=\r\nnd how\n&gt; to improve it to be as useful as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Rickard\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nMed vennlig hilsen\nErling Wegger Linde\n\n"}}
