There may be some complex business process that may govern  \norder cancellation. Using POST gives the server an opportunity to  \nprovide a decent abstraction for the order cancellation process  \nprovided that the body of the representation for POST includes  \ninformation about the cancellation request.\n\nIt is okay to argue that the first is RESTful while the second is not,  \nbut it does not help very much. There are two competing requirements  \nhere. One is visibility, and the other is separation of concerns.  \nUsing PUT maintains visibility, but will most likely force the client  \nto know who/when it is valid to flip the flag to true or false. Using  \nPOST reduces visibility, but maintains a cleaner separation of concerns.\n\nA lot of problems being discussed on this thread often come down to  \nthis point. You can have absolute visibility with poor separation of  \nconcerns, or partial visibility with better separation of concerns.  \nSince these are networked/distributed systems, I would go with the  \nlatter.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
