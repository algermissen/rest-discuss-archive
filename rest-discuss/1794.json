For example, if I POSTed a picture of a hand\n&gt;&gt;to a dog resource, the dog may change state to &quot;recently petted&quot;.  But\n&gt;&gt;the fact that a hand induced the state change isn&#39;t reflected in the\n&gt;&gt;state of the dog.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My point is that there&#39;s a difference between &quot;here is a hand, update your\n&gt; state accordingly&quot; and &quot;change your state to recently petted.&quot;\n\nThis is an excellent point that we&#39;ve had to deal with.  Our network \napplication is very RESTful.  All we transfer across the network are new \nrepresentations of objects.  We always need to know, however, who made \nthe change, and how it was made.\n\nThe fact that the dog is now being petted is not enough.  We needed to \nknow the Who and the How as well.  We&#39;ve wrapped up the Who, How, and \nWhat into a simple Request.  Just sending the What (dog) wasn&#39;t enough.\n\nSo the question becomes, when trasnfering the state of the dog, how do I \nalso say who&#39;s responsible for that state change?  Do I also send a new \nstate of a Hand which is now Petting and hyperlink that to a Person?\n\nOr do I bundle up the Who with the What?\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
