All\n&gt; &gt; that I see is a request entity that may replace or create a \n&gt; new resource\n&gt; &gt; identified by the request-URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; This has always bothered me too. Unless I misunderstand the concept of\n&gt; &#39;representation&#39; (which is perfectly possible--I haven&#39;t gotten around\n&gt; to reading Fielding&#39;s dissertation or other deep scholarly work on\n&gt; REST), the ability to PUT or POST a representation raises a serious\n&gt; issue which I have not seen addressed on this list.\n&gt; \n&gt; What if a client PUTs a representation of a type that is \n&gt; impractical to\n&gt; transform to the type of the existing resource? Doesn&#39;t that \n&gt; effectively\n&gt; cripple the resource, upsetting the expectations of other clients? For\n&gt; example, suppose your resource is an SVG graphic--one of the most\n&gt; information-rich image formats, and one that can be transformed to any\n&gt; output format (known in this context as a representation, right?) you\n&gt; like. So your server might make available JPEG, PNG, and EPS\n&gt; representations of the image. Outbound, there&#39;s no problem. But now\n&gt; suppose somebody wants to PUT a JPEG to the URI? If you allow the put,\n&gt; then your information-rich SVG image is now degraded to a \n&gt; dumb JPEG (I&#39;m\n&gt; talking about what happens in the real world, not the MIT Media Lab),\n&gt; which not only contains less information than the old \n&gt; resource, but may\n&gt; be impractical to transform to some of the representation \n&gt; types that are\n&gt; supposed to be available.\n&gt; \n&gt; So do you disallow certain types of representations from being PUT or \n&gt; POSTed? That certainly seems like a practical response to the problem.\n&gt; But I would think that in a very large proportion of cases, you&#39;d have\n&gt; to prohibit any type but the original type of the resource--in which\n&gt; case the distinction between resource and representation seems rather\n&gt; academic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or am I just confused?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Matt Gushee\n&gt; Englewood, Colorado, USA\n&gt; mgushee@...\n&gt; http://www.havenrock.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
