This sometimes seems like nitpicking, but\nin my opinion when you discuss rest designs, you must talk\nabout representations, in order to be concrete.\n\nIf you&#39;re talking about representations and the composition\nof same, then you can talk about which agent does that, and\nhow much control that agent can really exercise over\nrepresentational consistency in a distributed application.\n\nMark&#39;s design is fine; it&#39;s abstract, though.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
