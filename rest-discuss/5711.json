What if someone wants to do an XSLT transform on the P3P\n&gt;&gt; policy - shouldn&#39;t it have its own URL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure... but content neg can handle that as well. The point is a\n&gt; request for meta data can be made using content neg:\n&gt;\n&gt;  GET / HTTP/1.1\n&gt;  Host: someplace.com\n&gt;  Accept: robot/robot\n&gt;\n&gt; The reply *could* be:\n&gt;\n&gt;  HTTP/1.1 302 Ok\n&gt;  Location: /place/I/keep/robots.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; Same for the P3P stuff. It&#39;s the metadata querying that content neg is\n&gt; good for.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the favicon,  I never understood why that wasn&#39;t an HTML LINK\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is also an HTML LINK, with /favicon.ico as a fallback. I imagine\n&gt;&gt; that they thought people wouldn&#39;t want to change every single page on\n&gt;&gt; their site.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm... that is a good point. But it&#39;s not done for CSS files (where\n&gt; it would be similarly useful) so I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s necessary for\n&gt; favicon personally.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nic\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
