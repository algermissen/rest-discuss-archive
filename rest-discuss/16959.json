Web\napplication providers undermine their business models when, by\ncontinuing to use HTTP, they enable a wide range of attackers anywhere\non the internet to compromise users&#39; information.&quot;\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/pages/how-deploy-https-correctly\n\nCiting Gmail as a baseline-performance example is kinda lame, for one\nthing, because it&#39;s not the sort of application that&#39;s meant to be\ncached.\n\nThere&#39;s a golden opportunity being missed here, to advocate for digest\nauthentication (deployed correctly) as a more scalable solution than\nreplacing HTTP with HTTPS in order to keep cookie-based authentication\nas the status quo.  But, switch to HTTPS even for anonymous access?\nIsn&#39;t that an overreaction?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
