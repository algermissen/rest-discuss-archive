But it would be nice to see more conscious\n&gt; alignment with REST from the Linked Data crowd, in particular around\n&gt; the issue of what URLs identify, and (for me) unhelpful terminology\n&gt; like Document and Information Resource.\n\ncf. my attempt of an explanation of the relation of resource, \ninformation resource and document[1] that is based on my personal \ndefinition (at least), which also maybe have a shared understanding \n(that means, I don&#39;t want to say that I &quot;own&quot; the definitions nor to \nclaim that I invented them - I think it&#39;s exactly the other case; I just \nordered the thoughts for my own ;) ).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\nPS: My thinking in [1] should (from my POV) align with Roy T. Fielding \nstatement about resources:\n\n&quot; Any\ninformation that can be named can be a resource: a document or image,\na temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a\ncollection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person),\nand so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an\nauthor&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a\nresource.&quot;[2]\n\nwhich lately maybe contradicts a bit with the \nresource-representation-view, where representation is (strongly \nconstrained) defined as &quot;a sequence of bytes, plus representation \nmetadata to describe those bytes&quot;[2], and in combination with the \n&quot;strong&quot; relation of requested resources and retrieved representations \nof exactly these resources (maybe the mother of all problems in the \nSemantic Web world).\n\nI would say the &#39;temporally varying membership function&#39; isn&#39;t the \nresource itself, because this function is created by its context, i.e. a \nname. For example I&#39;m still a human being, or at least something, even \nif I wouldn&#39;t have a name.\n\n[1] \nhttp://infoserviceonto.smiy.org/2010/11/25/on-resources-information-resources-and-documents/\n[2] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/documents/2002-REST-TOIT.pdf\n\n"}}
