The idea that what seems like a problem to=\r\n you should actually be acted upon.  When, more likely, just because 1% of =\r\nyour customer base requests a feature, doesn&#39;t mean you have to do it.  You=\r\n have to consider the silent 99% minority who probably don&#39;t want to see th=\r\nat change.\n\nYou have more than a 100 conversations about REST in the course=\r\n of a year... Okay... how does coining this acronym make you a more effecti=\r\nve communicator?  For one, the acronym HATEOAS is already searchable everyw=\r\nhere on the Internet.  So by ditching it, you are wasting time trying to ge=\r\nt bees to re-pollinate the flowers.\n\nAgain...\n\nI am not criticizing you for=\r\n wanting to be the best you are for what you do... I would *never* do such =\r\na thing.\n\nI am simply saying that, as an outsider looking at this, you are =\r\nmisapplying your gifted talents.\n\nJust find something _better_ to do.  Also=\r\n, when I said to &quot;find&quot;, I guess I made the faulty assumption you are like =\r\nme and already have 3453 items on your todo list.  I didn&#39;t mean &quot;*think* o=\r\nf something better to do&quot;.  Better opportunities should be around us than t=\r\no  paint bike sheds.\n\n\n"}}
