See:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/Message/Tutorial/\n&gt; \n&gt; The benefit of mapping data in XML to a Java object is being able\n&gt; to fully leverage the syntax you&#39;re currently working in. Doing\n&gt; that means representing your data using the AST (Abstract Syntax\n&gt; Tree) that your syntax is designed to work with. If you&#39;re working\n&gt; in XSLT, then keeping your data in the XML AST (ie: the XML\n&gt; Infoset) is most convenient.  If you&#39;re working in Java, then\n&gt; mapping your data onto the Java AST is most convenient. A tool\n&gt; that can automatically translate between the two ASTs lets you\n&gt; choose the right tool and syntax for the particular task. Without\n&gt; such a tool, you end up using clumsy meta-level APIs like the DOM.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember what your syntax is there for. Don&#39;t steal its job.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyler\n&gt; \nYes, its about the right tool for the job. For complex processing that\ncannot naturally be performed in the XML domain, mapping into (Java)\nobjects is the best way to go and tools are a necessary part of that\nmapping process.\n\nHowever IMHO there are a large number of processing problems that can\neasily solved by scripting services (behind REST interfaces) together\ninto pipelines, as described by Josh, without resorting to coupling\nyour XML to objects. If you can do this you save yourself a lot of\nwork, particularly when the system evolves.\n\nTony\n\n\n"}}
