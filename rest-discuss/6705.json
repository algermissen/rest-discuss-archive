What I  \nam trying to elucidate to other developers is that a resource-modeled web\napplication is inherently more &quot;internet scalable&quot; than what they are used\nto.  And what they are used to is modeling their web services with UML\ntools.  Clearly, at the moment there are no equivalent RESTful tools.\n\nThe first question out of mouths of developers is &quot;How does REST (and\ntherefore resource-oriented design) make my job easier?&quot;.  And I think that\nthe answer is;  it doesn&#39;t.  But it does make your application lighter,\nfaster, easier to federate, and operate across multiple trust domains.\n\nCiao,\n\n\tRick\n\n\nOn Oct 25, 2006, at 11:31 AM, Dr. Ernie Prabhakar wrote:\n\n&gt; I also think it is something of a disjoint comparison.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my admittedly naive view, Resource-Oriented is about\n&gt; *invocation* semantics, whereas Object-Oriented is about  \n&gt; *implementation*.   It is easy (perhaps even preferable) to use an  \n&gt; OO language to implement your REST structure.  However, the REST \n&gt; argument is that you should NOT expose your internal method invocation \n&gt; stack as a web service, because you&#39;ll lose all those wonderful \n&gt; RESTful scalability advantages.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Ernie P.\n&gt;\n[snip]\n\n\n"}}
