What *i=\r\ns* interesting to me is whether the media-type design\nI employ is free of p=\r\nrotocol-specific requirements.\n\nIt is my assertion that, if you want to use=\r\n the media-type I designed in my\nblog post, you can use that media-type wit=\r\nh any uniform interface you\nwish. While I will accept that my blog post may=\r\n be unclear on this point (I\nhave some lazy language in the section regardi=\r\nng mixing protocols), that is\none of the primary messages I tried to convey=\r\n in my example.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n2010/4/7 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;=\r\namsmota@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My understanding is: you have a architectural sty=\r\nle, you design a\n&gt; architecture that conforms to that style, you implement =\r\nthat design, you\n&gt; write applications that run over that architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nSo, REST imposes a Uniform Interface, I build a architecture wich I define\n=\r\n&gt; as Uniform Interface: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, LISTEN (this is based on a\n=\r\n&gt; real use case). Note this interface is defined in the architecture,\n&gt; ind=\r\nependent of any protocol beacause this architecture will support multi\n&gt; pr=\r\notocols, meaning the same resources will be adressed by several protocols\n&gt;=\r\n via their specific connectors. Its based on the HTTP protocol because it\n&gt;=\r\n will be the protocol that we foresee will be more used (and also has more\n=\r\n&gt; support and tools available), but we also foresee other use cases that wi=\r\nll\n&gt; use LISTEN, like support for JMS protocol via a JMS Connector. And tha=\r\nt I\n&gt; can extend if needed by adding new verbs, without breaking existing u=\r\nsers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then we build applications on this architecture. We define media-=\r\ntypes,\n&gt; relations, resources. One resource of the application can make use=\r\n of GET,\n&gt; POST, PUT, DELETE verbs, another one GET and LISTEN only. None c=\r\nan use verbs\n&gt; non existing in the Uniform Interface, at least until we dep=\r\nloy Architecture\n&gt; 2.0 that can extend it with ERASE, for example.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note=\r\n that I use the word Architecture to refer to a actual implementation\n&gt; of =\r\na achitecture, not only its design. (And that I use the term &quot;I&quot; loosely,\n&gt;=\r\n as all this was/is a collective effort).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not only my understen=\r\nding but the way we built our infrastructure,\n&gt; or midleware, that it has n=\r\now some good months in production. And that\n&gt; &quot;midlware&quot; based on this is p=\r\nrobably the more robust piece of software we\n&gt; use including several 3rd pa=\r\nrty frameworks, with exactly 0 bugs until now\n&gt; (even if the fact that it r=\r\nuns, for now, only on the intranet helps). And it\n&gt; supports HTTP, IMAP, JM=\r\nS, intra-VM, JCR protocols. If I had the time I had\n&gt; built also a SOAP con=\r\nnector.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now from what I understood, you say that the architectural styl=\r\ne imposes a\n&gt; Uniform Interface, but the actual architecture does not? It w=\r\nill have as\n&gt; much Uniform Interfaces as protocols it uses? And the Uniform=\r\n Interface you\n&gt; apply to your media-types is the one that is mandated by t=\r\nhe Architecture\n&gt; Style, and so we have two diferent levels of Uniform Inte=\r\nrface, at the\n&gt; protocol level and at media-type level, and none at the\n&gt; a=\r\nrchitecture/application level?\n&gt;\n&gt; I admit perfectly my &quot;misinterpretation&quot;=\r\n of REST if that&#39;s the case, and\n&gt; that what I described is wrong from a RE=\r\nST perspective. After all I read\n&gt; Fielding less than 2 years ago... But so=\r\nmehow what I desribe seems more\n&gt; &quot;neat&quot; to me, whatever the name.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do=\r\nn&#39;t know nothing about english poetry, but I remember (from a book of\n&gt; Ger=\r\nald Weinberg, best wishes for him in his health) something like &quot;a rose\n&gt; b=\r\ny any other name smells as sweet&quot; :)\n&gt;\n&gt; On 7 Apr 2010 19:14, &quot;mike amundse=\r\nn&quot; &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ant=F3nio:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If the same app=\r\nlication (meaning the same set of resources) are to be\n&gt; referenced by both=\r\n HTTP and FT...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; First, this is not an application descripti=\r\non here, but a media-type\n&gt; description.

Possibly I&#39;ve not=\r\n made that as clear\n&gt; as it should be in this short blog post.\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, =\r\nthe media-type description I&#39;ve described here does, in\n&gt; effect, have a un=\r\niform interface. There are three (and only three)\n&gt; hypermedia links descri=\r\nbed and the meanings for these links (including\n&gt; the possible operations) =\r\nare detailed as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Third, I think I hear you saying that your *appli=\r\ncation* has a uniform\n&gt; interface. That is fine, but not the same as saying=\r\n an architectural\n&gt; style has a uniform interface. I read Fielding&#39;s Sec 5.=\r\n1.5 [1]\n&gt; referring to &quot;a uniform interface between components.&quot;  For examp=\r\nle,\n&gt; in a layered system some components may interact using the HTTP\n&gt; pro=\r\ntocol on one layer and another set of components at some other\n&gt; layer may =\r\ninteract using FTP, BEEP or some other protocol. The fact\n&gt; that multiple p=\r\nrotocols are used in the completion of a request does\n&gt; not, as I understan=\r\nd Fielding, reduce the RESTful nature of the\n&gt; architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; As an asid=\r\ne, the use of your application-level interface terms (FETCH,\n&gt; ATTACK, KILL=\r\n) strike me as solid candidates for relation link values.\n&gt; IOW, FETCH, ATT=\r\nACK, KILL may be the equivalent of DSL reserved words\n&gt; for your applicatio=\r\nn which, in a RESTful hypermedia implementation,\n&gt; need to be expressed as =\r\nlinks w/ relation value annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2010/4/7 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 7 April 2=\r\n010 15:14, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The =\r\nuniform interface...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\r\n--000e0cd1a400391fc90483abbbc6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nAnt=F3nio:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Possibly we&#39;ve gotten off the track a bit=\r\n.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether the uniform interface you are working wi=\r\nth is the same for all layers, all=A0connectors, etc. it not interesting to=\r\n me while I am designing the media-type.

The fact&lt;br&gt;\nthat multiple protocols are used in the completion=\r\n of a request does&lt;br&gt;\nnot, as I understand Fielding, reduce the RESTful na=\r\nture of the&lt;br&gt;\narchitecture.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs an aside, the use of your applica=\r\ntion-level interface terms (FETCH,&lt;br&gt;\nATTACK, KILL) strike me as solid can=\r\ndidates for relation link values.&lt;br&gt;\nIOW, FETCH, ATTACK, KILL may be the e=\r\nquivalent of DSL reserved words&lt;br&gt;\nfor your application which, in a RESTfu=\r\nl hypermedia implementation,&lt;br&gt;\nneed to be expressed as links w/ relation =\r\nvalue annotations.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;mca&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://amundsen.com/blog/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://amundsen.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;2010/4/7 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:amsmot=\r\na@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amsmota@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;:&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; On 7 April 2010 15:14, mike amundsen &lt=\r\n;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mamund@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mamund@...&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&gt;&gt; Th=\r\ne uniform interface...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    =\r\n\n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd1a400391fc90483abbbc6--\r\n\n"}}
