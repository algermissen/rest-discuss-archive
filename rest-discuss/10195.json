This appears to me to push the sche=\r\nma definition\nto the edges of the system, meaning that instead of accepting=\r\n data\nfrom a user-agent and then performing various gymnastics to clean,\npa=\r\nrse and structure the entity data in the Request (say, from a\nform-encoded =\r\nPOST) into a format acceptable by the database, we can\nuse the schema defin=\r\nition itself as a method of ensuring that only\nrequests with entities encod=\r\ned in an acceptable schema will be accepted.\n\nAn example of this would be a=\r\n RDF schema definition for &quot;Person&quot;. The\nschema definition could be used vi=\r\na XForms to ensure that data is\nsubmitted that adheres to the &quot;Person&quot; sche=\r\nma. On the server side, the\nResource method handling the POST would validat=\r\ne the entity using the\nsame schema definition. If acceptable, the RDF docum=\r\nent can be parsed\nand stored.\n\nMy question is this: in my experience, Busin=\r\ness Logic consists of\nensuring the state of the system in the database: inc=\r\nrementing a\ncolumn here, ensuring this record is not orphaned here, etc; In=\r\n a\nsystem that ensures that all input and output data is consistant and\nval=\r\nid, and allows participants to act on the state of the system\ndirectly, is =\r\nthere any role for Business Logic? \n\nAgain, I&#39;m sorry if this is a stupid q=\r\nuestion with an obvious answer,\nbut I picture this as a huge system whos st=\r\nate is directly malluable\ndue to the constraints in place at the edges of t=\r\nhe system, ensuring\nthe integrity of the actions performed on the state of =\r\nsaid system.\n\nAm I way off base here? Am I in arm-wavy territory here?\n\n(Al=\r\nso, sorry if this is isnt 100% ReST based, but I feel this is a\nReSTy quest=\r\nion due to the fact that the manipulations of the state\nsystem are driven b=\r\ny ReST)\n\nCheers!\n\nBen\n\n\n"}}
