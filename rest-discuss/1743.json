After all, Linda&#39;s methods (in, rd,\nout) are operations on a tuplespace=\r\n;  the Web&#39;s GET, POST, DELETE are\noperations on resources, not on the Web =\r\nas a whole (whatever that means).\nSo the right mapping is tuplespace-&gt;resou=\r\nrce, not tuplespace-&gt;HTTP\nnamespace.  The HTTP namespace merely provides an=\r\n arbitrarily large number\nof named tuplespaces, i.e. resources.  Equivalent=\r\nly, resources aren&#39;t\ntuples, they&#39;re tuplespaces.\n\nA more detailed explanat=\r\nion of a Webby Linda mapping can be found at\n\n    http://internet.conveyor.=\r\ncom/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/LindaAndTheWeb\n\n&gt; As an aside: a lot of process synch=\r\nronization problems can be handled by\n&gt; applying best practices for CVS, ra=\r\nther than global locking schemes (as\n&gt; per SourceSafe), which maybe wouldn&#39;=\r\nt be planetary scalable anyway.\n\n&lt;RANT&gt;\n\nNot exasperated with you particula=\r\nrly, Bill, but let me rant for a sec:\n\nCould we all get over this whole ide=\r\na of locking as necessary or desirable\nfor versioning, avoiding conflict in=\r\n object evolution, etc.?  It&#39;s a\nside-effect of a bad storage metaphor, nam=\r\nely that stored entities are\nmutable.  Stored entities need not be mutable:=\r\n  imagine a filesystem in\nwhich stored files are immutable, identified by O=\r\nIDs (maybe hashes), and\naccessible directly via those names or more conveni=\r\nently via names.  What&#39;s\nmutable is the file name-&gt;stored objects (i.e. bit=\r\ns), and indeed a canonical\nmapping must be maintained, but that can be done=\r\n heuristically.  With the\naddition of a stream of representations of mutati=\r\nons in the name-&gt;stored\nobject mappings --- something like a filesystem jou=\r\nrnal --- it is possible\nto have complete and implicit file versioning.\n\nThe=\r\n evolutionary history of a given file is then an arbitrarily bushy tree\nof =\r\nimmutable stored entities, and the &quot;canonical&quot; version is just the\nparticul=\r\nar version that happens to be pointed to by some name in a\nhierarchical nam=\r\nespace at some given time.  The history / version graph\nitself can be recon=\r\nstructed from the journal and consulted / heuristics\napplied to generate th=\r\ne canonical mapping in the case of conflicts.\n\nIf we factor the notions of =\r\nnaming and storage and assume immutability, then\nthe problem isn&#39;t just sol=\r\nved, it *disappears.*  Really.  This is one of\nthose problems we can just d=\r\nefine away by appropriate abstraction.\n\nCheck out Tannenbaum&#39;s Amoeba opera=\r\nting system and its fileserver (&quot;bullet&quot;)\n/ directory server architecture. =\r\n Also, Plan 9 has a new archival filesystem\narchitecture called Venti that =\r\napplies essentially the same concepts to\nblock-level storage.\n\nThese issues=\r\n are rather near and dear to my heart --- they&#39;re part of the\nDeepfile &quot;Big=\r\n Picture.&quot;  I just cringe whenever people talk about\nversioning, locking, D=\r\nAV, CVS, etc. because most people don&#39;t recognize that\nthese are only band-=\r\naids on what is fundamentally a sick and empoverished\nfilesystem metaphor.\n=\r\n\n&lt;/RANT&gt;\n\nCheers!\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
