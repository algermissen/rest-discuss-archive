A capabi=\r\nlity URL embedded within a representation is\nauthority that should always b=\r\ne granted when authority to the\nrepresentation&#39;s resource has been granted.=\r\n\n\n&gt; Take the case where I give you the Yurl for a Web resource where the\n&gt; =\r\nrepresentation includes hyperlinks for other resources.\n\nPassing a URL to a=\r\nnother user grants that user access to the target\nresource, as well as acce=\r\nss to any resources that are referenced in a\nfetched representation, and so=\r\n on, recursively.\n\nFor example, consider the capability URL:\n\nhttps://yurl.=\r\nnet/id/6fo4lr6it4topf5rqcnml2fpav2hzmug\n\nThe above URL refers to a wiki pag=\r\ne editor resource. A GET operation\non this URL returns:\n\n&lt;?xml version=3D&quot;1=\r\n.0&quot; encoding=3D&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=3D&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=3D&quot;/xsl/ht=\r\ntp/yurl.org/Author.xsl&quot;?&gt;\n\n&lt;list&gt;\n&lt;doc schema=3D&quot;http://waterken.org/name/A=\r\nuthorProxyScope$Author-interface&quot;&gt;\n&lt;super schema=3D&quot;http://yurl.org/Author&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;self schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Embed&quot;&gt;\n&lt;target&gt;6fo4lr6it=\r\n4topf5rqcnml2fpav2hzmug&lt;/target&gt;\n&lt;/self&gt;\n&lt;topic&gt;home comments&lt;/topic&gt;\n&lt;valu=\r\ne schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&lt;target&gt;scdexb3ncrpdfp7l=\r\nvd4guthvt6floqny&lt;/target&gt;\n&lt;/value&gt;\n&lt;assign schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.or=\r\ng/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&lt;target&gt;puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynbdw62&lt;/target&gt;\n&lt;/assign=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;revoke schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&lt;target&gt;mzkuol4e=\r\n6u4konlco4tfxgyajqg5ewhd&lt;/target&gt;\n&lt;/revoke&gt;\n&lt;proxy schema=3D&quot;http://web-cal=\r\nculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&lt;target&gt;z7b4euktmhbxbfax5nvvt7wsnclnjvhj&lt;/target&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;/proxy&gt;\n&lt;/super&gt;\n&lt;/doc&gt;\n&lt;/list&gt;\n\nThe above representation contains a numbe=\r\nr of embedded capability\nURLs, including the authority to: read the current=\r\n wiki text (the\nvalue element); assign new wiki text (the assign element); =\r\nand so on.\nAll of the embedded authorities are described by the schema at:\n=\r\n&lt;http://yurl.org/Author&gt;.\n\nTo edit a wiki page, the user naturally requires=\r\n the authority to read\nthe current text and the authority to assign new tex=\r\nt. To implement\nthis access policy, the hypermedia resource web is construc=\r\nted so that\nboth these authorities are reachable from the page editor resou=\r\nrce.\n\n&gt; I might want you to be able GET representations from some of those\n=\r\n&gt; hyperlinks, edit and PUT some of the others, POST to still others, and\n&gt; =\r\nsome of them I don&#39;t even want you to see.  I mean, I might want\n&gt; others t=\r\no be able to see them, but not you.\n\nYour hypermedia web must be designed t=\r\no implement this access policy.\nCreating a hypermedia web that is at odds w=\r\nith your access policy puts\nyou in a pickle.\n\nWhen designing your applicati=\r\non, first start out with pencil and paper\nand draw your hypermedia web. Mak=\r\ne sure that starting from any point\nin the web, you can only get to other p=\r\noints in the web that conform\nto your access policy.\n\n&gt; I might want others=\r\n to be able to get representations of the same\n&gt; resource including a diffe=\r\nrent subset of the hyperlinks the resource\n&gt; knows about, with a different =\r\nset of capabilities, maybe more or less\n&gt; than what I gave you.\n\nI avoid su=\r\nch designs. I make the resource mean the same thing to all\npeople, and repr=\r\nesent extra authorities as separate resources. For\nexample, my wiki home pa=\r\nge is at:\n\nhttps://yurl.net/id/home\n\nI have the authority to edit that page=\r\n and you don&#39;t; however, when I\ndo a GET on the above URL, I see the same t=\r\nhing that you do. I have a\nseparate URL that I use for editing the page.\n\nT=\r\nhanks for the questions,\n\nTyler\n\n--\nThe web-calculus is the union of REST a=\r\nnd capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\nName your t=\r\nrusted sites to distinguish them from phishing sites.\nhttps://addons.mozill=\r\na.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=3D957\n\n"}}
