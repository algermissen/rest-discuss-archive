Especially if the number of people wiriting clients is small and\n&gt; controlled.\n\nYes.  I should have written &quot;I think the risk here is ... and in that\ncase I would recommend having the server resolve the URN into a URL&quot;.\nThe point is, if you&#39;re not satisfied with that risk, then the clear\nalternative would be for the server to resolve it.\n\nIn my experience writing the code is easier than changing code you\nhave not touched in a while, or worse, other people&#39;s code.  It&#39;s not\nthe number of people writing clients, but the number of different\npeople who will have to change them in the future.  And most scaling\nbandwidth is easier than scaling development.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But even your service is public, if it is important that the URL be able to\n&gt; change then make that clear in no uncertain terms in the docs and in\n&gt; UPPERCASE comments in any representations returned.  And if you are\n&gt; paranoid, literally change the URL every time with a validatation parameter\n&gt; so that anyone who did hard code quickly learns better and no time is given\n&gt; to allow hardcoded clients time is build up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or IMO best of all, just document it and commit to the URL format just as\n&gt; Google have done with their Chart service, for example. Yes I know, that\n&gt; violates the HATEOAS requirement but I personally don&#39;t think being a\n&gt; fundamentalist in all things is such a good idea; some times it is better\n&gt; just to put a stake in the ground. If *everything* were meta, we&#39;d never get\n&gt; anything done.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n-- Assaf\n\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n"}}
