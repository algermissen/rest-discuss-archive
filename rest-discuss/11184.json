The problem I&#39;ve just encountered is regarding\nthe best w=\r\nay to design my URI for data that is a subset of the parent\nresource and ca=\r\nn be filtered by multiple parameters.\n\nFor example lets say I have a collec=\r\ntion of Books and I&#39;d like to\noptionally filter by Category and/or Year pub=\r\nlished.\n\nMy first (probably not very restful idea) was to create something =\r\nlike:\n/books?category=3Dscifi&year=3D2008\n\nThen I thought about a hierarchy=\r\n\n/books/{category}/{year}\nbut then I would also need\n/books/{year}/{categor=\r\ny}\nBut this makes it seem like one category is a child of year or vice\nvers=\r\na which isn&#39;t correct.  Plus as I add filters I&#39;d need all sorts\nof combina=\r\ntions.\n\nThe other option I read about involves putting them at the same lev=\r\nel\nseparated by a comma or semicolon:\n/books/{year},{category}\nBut then see=\r\nms king of messy since it&#39;s possible to omit a filter and\nthen I&#39;d have som=\r\nething like\n/books/,sci-fi\n\nSo far the original query variable URI still se=\r\nems to make the most\nsense to me.  Does anybody have a better suggestion or=\r\n opinion on how\nbest to do this?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my pos=\r\nt and I look forward to\nreading you opinions.\n\nCheers,\nRandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
