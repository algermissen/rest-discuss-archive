Part of the discussion comes down to finding =\r\nRESTful idioms, standards, and/or tools to apply to certain recurring enter=\r\nprise integration problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically, we are trying to find RESTfu=\r\nl solutions to:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Guaranteed Delivery - we need a paradigm to follow =\r\nso that one service can transfer a sequence of resource representations to =\r\nanother reliably even though both services and the network suffer temporary=\r\n unreliability\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Distributed Transactions - we need a paradigm to all=\r\now state changes on multiple services to happen so that the changes succeed=\r\n or fail as a unit\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Long running operations - we need asynchronous i=\r\nnvocations between services and a mechanism for the invoking service to fin=\r\nd out when the invoked service is done given that this work may take indefi=\r\nnitely long\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Workflow Orchestration - we would like to have orchestr=\r\nation services that define business processes via standardized representati=\r\nons (eg BPMN), then execute instances of those processes and build up an pr=\r\nocess instance execution data resource by interacting with other RESTful re=\r\nsources using message exchange patterns that could specify the above behavi=\r\nors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure that some of these topics have been discussed to death. =\r\nI&#39;m not looking to repeat the details in one thread, but just wondering if =\r\npeople can give me quick dump of the conventional wisdom as to how to appro=\r\nach such problems, and/or point me to solutions (or alternatives) that they=\r\n consider consistent with RESTful approaches.\n&gt; \n&gt; I found the Rest-* effor=\r\nt at http://www.jboss.org/reststar . The name of this project tweaks me, bu=\r\nt some of the specs under it seem relevant. Are there others? Are these pro=\r\nblems that the community sees value in solving through standards and toolin=\r\ng?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
