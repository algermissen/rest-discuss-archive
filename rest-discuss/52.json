Alexander Jacobson&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok.  On both MIME-RPC and rest-discuss.\n\nOkay.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; The main point of REST seems to be that things\n&gt; should exist in terms of URIs, but it seems to\n&gt; insist on only allowing HTTP uris.   Why not allow\n&gt; HTTPS URIs or mailto uris?\n\nHTTPS is REST-compatible.\n\nThe problem with mailto is I can&#39;t dereference it. I can only send\ninformation to it and the information goes into a black hole. That&#39;s\nagainst the REST philosophy. If email were designed according to REST\nthen every email message would have a globally unique identifier and you\nwould reply to a message by POSTing to the identifier (which you can&#39;t\ndo with an SMTP unique identifer).\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; I think REST provides a philosophy. MIME-RPC\n&gt; provides a wire format.\n\nRight, REST is a philosophy. The wire format is already HTTP + MIME +\nXML. What does MIME-RPC add?\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Please define your use of RPC.  My use of RPC is\n&gt; simply that the recipient of the message is an\n&gt; application rather than a person.\n\nThis may help:\n\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestFaq\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
