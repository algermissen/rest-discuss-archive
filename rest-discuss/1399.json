But I understand that it came from telecom practices. \nI th=\r\nink it is also very similar to some previous work on consensus.  \nBut I am =\r\nnot an expert in transaction or consensus theory.\n\nI just know that this tr=\r\nansaction model has been used fairly widely \nin real electronic commerce by=\r\n real companies (e.g. Intel and \nSiemens). It is also the simplest Web tran=\r\nsaction model I have seen, \nand seems to me to be RESTifiable.\n\nFirst I&#39;ll =\r\ndescribe the model in its native form, and then consider \nRESTificiation.\n\n=\r\nRosettaNet transactions use something like EDI-mailbox-style SOAP.\nIt&#39;s a p=\r\neer-to-peer interaction between two business activities, \nhidden behind bus=\r\niness services (service access points) with \ndispatchers directing messages=\r\n to the business activities. \nIt&#39;s not actually SOAP, but ebXML adopted the=\r\n same transaction model \nand does use SOAP.\n\nIt&#39;s not REST because the busi=\r\nness entities (whose states are to be \naligned) are hidden behind the servi=\r\nce access point and dispatcher.  \n\nBut I think that the EDI-mailbox-style i=\r\ns a RosettaNet+ebXML \nimplementation detail.\n\nUN/CEFACT has a metamodel for=\r\n this transaction model that claims to \nbe technology-neutral. So if the tr=\r\nansaction model is not \nRESTifiable, UN/CEFACT might be concerned.\n\nThe bas=\r\nics of the transaction model:\n\nIt&#39;s a two-party request-response interactio=\r\nn, with receipt \nacknowledgements for both request and response.\nThe intera=\r\nctions are between a requesting business activity and a \nresponding busines=\r\ns activity.\nUN/CEFACT describes five different patterns for different kinds=\r\n of \nbusiness interactions.\nI will consider only one pattern here which is =\r\nmost applicable to \nOffer-Acceptance, the business protocol for contract fo=\r\nrmation and \norder placement.\n\nIn an Offer-Acceptance state-alignment trans=\r\naction consists of these \nsteps:\n1. The requesting activity sends an Offer =\r\ndocument to the responding \nactivity via the responding business service.\n2=\r\n. The responding  business service sends back a receipt \nacknowledgment for=\r\n the Offer document, or an error message.  If an \nerror message, the transa=\r\nction fails with a Control Failure. In some \ncases, there can be two acknow=\r\nledgments or possible points of error: \nthe first for schema validation, th=\r\ne second for business rules.  \nUN/CEFACT, ebXML and RosettaNet V1.0 require=\r\n both; RosettaNet V2.0 \nonly requires one.\n3. The responding business activ=\r\nity does whatever it needs to do to \ndecide whether it can fill the order o=\r\nr not.  It then sends back a \nResponse document that says it either Accepts=\r\n or Rejects (declines) \nthe offer.  If Rejection, the transaction fails wit=\r\nh a Contract \nFailure.\n4. The requesting business service sends back a rece=\r\nipt \nacknowledgment for the Response document, or an error message.  If an =\r\n\nerror message, the transaction fails with a Control Failure.\n\nIf the Respo=\r\nnse document says &quot;Accept&quot; and there were no error \nmessages, the transacti=\r\non succeeds.\n\nThere are time constraints on each step.  If any timeout occu=\r\nrs, the \ntransaction fails with a Control Failure.\n\nIn cases where the Resp=\r\nonse document says &quot;Accept&quot; but has an error, \nand the error message from t=\r\nhe requesting business service cannot be \ndelivered, the transaction model =\r\nspecifies a separate Notification of \nFailure to be sent from the requestin=\r\ng business service via another \nchannel.  Otherwise the responding activity=\r\n may think incorrectly \nthat the transaction succeeded.\n\nState Alignment:\n\n=\r\nThere are two levels of state alignment in this transaction model:\n1. The s=\r\ntate of the transaction, aligned between the requesting and \nresponding bus=\r\niness activities, where the events that trigger state \ntransitions are the =\r\nrequesting and responding documents, receipt \nacknowledgments and/or error =\r\nmessages.\n2. The state of the business entity being offered, for example an=\r\n \nOrder. Example states might include Offered, Accepted and Rejected  \nThe =\r\nevent that triggers a state transition in the Order is the end of \nthe tran=\r\nsaction.  If the transaction succeeds, the Order transitions \nto the Accept=\r\ned state.  If the transaction fails with a Contract \nFailure. the Order tra=\r\nnsitions to the Rejected state. If the \ntransaction fails with a Control Fa=\r\nilure, the Order stays in the \nOffered state.\n\nRestification:\n\nI&#39;ll stick w=\r\nith a peer-to-peer configuration because it is most like \nthe source.  But =\r\nI think the same underlying principles apply to a \nclient-service configura=\r\ntion, although only the Web resource for the \nbusiness entity will exist on=\r\nly on the server side.\n\nReplace the business service access points with res=\r\nources \nrepresenting the business entity being offered, for example the \nOr=\r\nder.  (Alternatively, each transaction might become a sub-resource \nunder t=\r\nhe Order.)\n\nRosettaNet and ebXML assume that a business service access poin=\r\nt will \nhandle many transactions for many business activities, so each \nmes=\r\nsage contains tags for dispatching to the business collaboration \n(long con=\r\nversation about the Order), business transaction, and \nbusiness activity.\n\n=\r\nIf the resource is the Order, then only the business transaction and \nbusin=\r\ness activity tags are required.\nIf the resource is the Transaction, then th=\r\ne business activity can be \nassumed.\n\nIn either case, I think the REST styl=\r\ne is functionally equivalent to \nthe EDI-mailbox style, but has at least tw=\r\no advantages:\n1. the business entities and transaction results are Web reso=\r\nurces, \nand\n2. the &quot;service access point&quot; is finer-grained.\n\nI assume the m=\r\nembers of this list understand some of the advantages \nof #1.  If not, and =\r\nthere&#39;s interest, I could expand =96 and of course \nhelp is always apprecia=\r\nted.\n\nThere is a lot more to the transaction model =96 mostly about securit=\r\ny \nissues.  But I think those are also functionally equivalent between a \nR=\r\nEST and EDI-mailbox style.\n\nSo what do you all think?  Does this have promi=\r\nse for fulfilling the \nbusiness transaction requirement for REST?  Should I=\r\n post it on the \nrest-wiki?\n\nWhat else is required or would be nice to add?=\r\n\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
