The list that you\ndescribe seems about right.\n\n1. http://www.mnot.net/tarawa/\n\n\n\nQuoting Jeff Bone &lt;jbone@...&gt;:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So we&#39;ve all been using a variety of ad-hoc mechanisms to describe \n&gt; resource models for a while now, including the chatty but pervasive \n&gt; sort of &quot;protocol traces&quot; that show the back-and-forth flow of messages\n&gt; \n&gt; between a resource provider and consumer / client.  I&#39;m wondering if \n&gt; anybody&#39;s got preferred formats / standards / conventions for how to \n&gt; describe:\n&gt; \n&gt; the set of resources that are available\n&gt; i.e. the permutations of URIs that are allowed / meaningful\n&gt; the set of methods each one takes\n&gt; for POST and PUT, the formats and constraints of allowed input\n&gt; descriptions of representations / result codes returned by each method\n&gt; \n&gt; / input permutation per resource\n&gt; \n&gt; Love to see what people are doing in this sense.  I would hazard an \n&gt; intuitive guess that a lack of even a semi-formal set of conventions \n&gt; for declaratively describing / documenting resource models is one of \n&gt; the main sources of friction that we (the REST community) experience in\n&gt; \n&gt; trying to communicate with the unenlightened. ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; jb\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
