This works for \n    urls with well defined versions in them, \n    like synergy. For example, Synergy&#39;s url looks \n    like this: \n\n \nhttp://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/synergy2/SynergyInstaller-\n1.2.0.exe \n\n    InstallPad would try 1.2.0, 1.3.0, and then\n    1.3.1 (which is the latest version). This can \n    only work with URLs that have some version \n    information in them; InstallPad does not \n    maintain a central online database, nor is it \n    omniscient, and cannot therefore find the \n    latest version of a program any other way.  \n\nI guess the developer of InstallPad (like myself until just recently) has\nnever heard of the requirement for &quot;Opaque URIs?&quot;   \n\nI guess it also begs the questions of &quot;How should he be doing it if he\nshouldn&#39;t look into the URI?&quot;\n\n-Mike Schinkel \nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/ \nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/ \n\n \n\n\n\n"}}
