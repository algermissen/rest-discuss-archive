Sure, you can whip up an XML language, give it a\n&gt; schema,=\r\n and assign it a media type identifier.  But that doesn&#39;t make\n&gt; it a media=\r\n type, certainly not one that&#39;s of use for driving a REST\n&gt; system.  What d=\r\noes application/x-cargo+xml tell me that&#39;s any different\n&gt; from what applic=\r\nation/xml tells me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there some definition (and no, XSD doesn&#39;t begi=\r\nn to cut it) of how\n&gt; to render and interact with such a document?  If your=\r\n cargo manifest is\n&gt; HTML tables and lists, then block-level vs. inline ele=\r\nments are clearly\n&gt; understood by anyone looking at your HTTP headers.  Any=\r\none looking at\n&gt; the HTTP headers sees by the media type, how linking is ha=\r\nndled -- this\n&gt; particular out-of-band knowledge, is common knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n If, to make these determinations, I have to look beyond your media type\n&gt; =\r\nidentifier to some other resource to determine what a link is, and\n&gt; there&#39;=\r\ns nothing to refer to anywhere telling me which elements are\n&gt; block and wh=\r\nich are inline, then you&#39;ve missed the point of REST\n&gt; entirely -- your out=\r\n-of-band knowledge isn&#39;t common knowledge, it&#39;s\n&gt; proprietary to your syste=\r\nm.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Your system may not have the concerns of laying out the document, =\r\nbut\n&gt; still, your &quot;media type&quot; doesn&#39;t really tell me anything about what\n&gt;=\r\n methods to use.  An HTML media type tells me lots about how to interact\n&gt; =\r\nusing GET, POST and urlencoded queries before I&#39;ve even looked at the\n&gt; mes=\r\nsage body -- this is self-descriptiveness.  The application/xml\n&gt; media typ=\r\ne tells me nothing of the sort, neither does any *+xml type\n&gt; that is funct=\r\nionally no different from application/xml.)\n&gt; \n\nI wonder, though, if it wou=\r\nld be possible and/or useful to determine exactly what it is that a standar=\r\nd media type offers and come up with a language for encoding that in a decl=\r\narative manner (i.e. make that media type description machine readable).  S=\r\no if a client needs to &quot;know&quot; about the media type, this machine-readable m=\r\nedia type definition could be delivered runtime (say, linked-to w/ an http =\r\nheader).  I&#39;m not saying we have such a description language, I am just spe=\r\nculating, what if.... Certainly this is sub-optimal when a well-known media=\r\n type (HTML, Atom, etc.) would do the trick.  But are there instances when =\r\nsuch an approach would be defensible from a REST perspective?\n\n--peter  \n\n\n=\r\n&gt; But, the majority crowd who equate HTTP with REST, will be satisfied to\n&gt;=\r\n call what you propose RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
