These\n&gt;    types are unregistered, experimental, and should be used only with\n&gt;    the active agreement of the parties exchanging them.\n&gt;    However, with the simplified registration procedures described above\n&gt;    for vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be\n&gt;    necessary to use unregistered experimental types, and as such use of\n&gt;    both &quot;x-&quot; and &quot;x.&quot; forms is discouraged.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From:\n&gt;  RFC 2048 - MIME Registration Procedures\n&gt;  ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2048.txt\n\nif using x- and x. is discouraged, and registration is encouraged, this \nstill seems to leaves a single point of failure (the IANA).\n\nthe IANA is also as vulnerable as any other single authority to being \nhijacked by the US Dept. of Commerce/ICANN etc. acting in the interests \nof megacorps.   witness what happened to DNS.  &lt;/rant&gt;\n\ni just think URIs, being Universal, are a good fit for what mime does \nnow.\n\n&gt;&gt; this just makes me wonder why we can&#39;t use URIs as mime types, like\n&gt;&gt; namespace URIs in xml.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that way almost anybody can define a mime type without going through\n&gt;&gt; the IANA.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; maybe i&#39;m missing something obvious and this is a bad idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is being considered:\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#uriMediaType-9\n&gt;\n&gt; But given the problems of using URIs to identify namespaces in XML\n&gt; I doubt that the idea will make much progress.\n\ncorrect me if i&#39;m wrong, but i think the problems of URIs being used to \nidentify namespaces are to do with a lack of understanding of what URIs \nare, rather than problems arising simply because of the use of URIs per \nse.\n\nIMO the problems can be associated with the same type of people who \nbelieve fallacies like &#39;the web is a filesystem&#39; and &#39;a URI is a \nfilesystem path, so where&#39;s the file&#39;?\n\nthanks for your points anyway.\n\n\n"}}
