However some people here do not agree with this, and have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintained that the server is free to do anything it likes, including\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; retaining the old categories, adding any new ones, and still returning\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 200.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I think that the majority of the AtomPub working group simply couldn&#39;t\n&gt; figure out how to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disallow &quot;bad&quot; server behavior in the spec without also outlawing &quot;good&quot;\n&gt; server behavior.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The HTTP spec makes exactly this point. That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t define\n&gt; &gt; how a PUT request affects the state of the server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I find it very puzzling that Julian is the only other person in this\n&gt; &gt; thread that seems to understand that the semantics of  PUT are\n&gt; &gt; unambiguous, while the requirements on the servers are completely\n&gt; &gt; undefined.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.) the semantics of PUT are unambiguous\n&gt; &gt; 2.) requirements on servers receiving PUT requests are undefined\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Both are true, and #2 does not change #1. Understanding that these two\n&gt; &gt; facts can be simultaneously true is key to understanding HTTP. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; not a problem, and it&#39;s not underspecified.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that (1) and (2) are true and (2) does not change (1). But way back\n&gt; in the thread, you appeared to want to add a third constraint\n&gt;\n&gt; 3.) &quot;[O]missions in a client PUT message [mean] unset those portions&quot;;\n&gt; omission does &quot;not mean only update the included elements.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (1), (2), and (3) can NOT be all true. (3) contradicts (2) because it\n&gt; defines &quot;requirements on servers receiving PUT requests&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ambiguity I&#39;ve been referring to all along is the ambiguity between (2)\n&gt; and (3). Some people think PUT defines the requirement of replacement\n&gt; semantics (the 3 camp) and some people think the choice between replacement\n&gt; and merge are undefined (left open to the parties applying HTTP) (the 2\n&gt; camp). I thought Robert was in the (3) camp. You can&#39;t be in both.\n\nYes, you can. That is the understanding that is missing. The messages\nmust have unambiguous semantics in order to build working systems, and\nimplementations must be free to react as they please in order to build\nmaintainable systems. The completely clear replacement semantics of\nPUT messages place no requirements on servers, but they do create user\nexpectations. Meeting user expectations, aka &quot;not sucking&quot;, is not\nsomething you can put in the wire protocol.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
