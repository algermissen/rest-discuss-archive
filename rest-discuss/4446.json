I guess I read it too quickly.\n\n\n&gt; As far as using external sources for generating references to resources,\nas you\n&gt; describe above, the way I would do that is to query the system to\ndetermine\n&gt; whether such an artist exists. So for example, the phone book lists a\n&gt; &quot;Lisa B Simpson&quot; which could be used like this.\n&gt;\n&gt;    GET /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\nYou&#39;ll still have to generate the URI on the client - why not just use\n&quot;/artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson&quot; directly?\nSure, the HTML FORM element only provides a way to construct query terms in\na URI, but several people would like to go beyond that. Really wish we had a\nstandardized syntax & sample libraries...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The http path, /artist, suggests that only one artist should be returned,\nNot sure if that&#39;s a safe assumption. I suppose it&#39;s a reasonable guess -\nbut I would easily implement something of similar naming that would return a\nlist.\n\n\n"}}
