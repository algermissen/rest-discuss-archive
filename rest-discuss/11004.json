That&#39;s what conneg is for. Browser gets an html version, maybe\nredirecting if it makes sense, others get whatever the client and server\nagreed upon?\n\n&gt; Especially if you are using HTML w/ MicroFormats as your content type,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t it be ideal if your web site and your web service were one\n&gt; and the same? The redirect on POST best-practice seems to stand in the\n&gt; way of that.\n\nDon&#39;t see how it does that. And the idea that you ahve pages and services\nseems to forget that conneg, 300 and 303 is there *exactly* to ensure\nseveral representations (vcard, html, json, xml, image) are all available\nfor the same entity. See httpRange-14 et al.\n\n&gt; I believe that the right &quot;fix&quot; here would either 1) resolve the\n&gt; browser problems that require redirect on POST so that you are free to\n&gt; use the response code that best matches your semantics; or \n\nI fail to see where a POST always triggers a redirect? I happily send back\nwhatever code I want based on the scenario, 204, 200, 201 etc.\n\n&gt; 2) allows a &quot;next&quot; URL to be communicated with any response to a\nPOST/PUT/DELETE\n&gt; request.\n\nWhat&#39;s the problem with the Location: header, the Link: header or simply\nleveraging the content type? Like &lt;link&gt; ?\n\nSeb\n\n\n\n"}}
