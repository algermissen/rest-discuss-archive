Well, maybe i have to expect all HTTP response codes.\n\nYep! HTTP *is* the interface. You have to expect all of it.\n\n&gt; At least the common one (404 etc.). In practice, only a smal subset of response codes will be supported.\n\nWhy? And besides - who knows what intermediaries sit in the middle and produce responses the service developer never dreamed of?\n\n\n&gt; But how do you tell the clients, which ones?\n\nRFC2616 tells them. There is no service specific description in a RESTful system.\n\n&gt; Are response codes not part of the &quot;contract&quot;.\n\nThe contract is HTTP. No more no less. That is what clients have to understand.\n\nJan\n\nP.S. However, in order to develop clients, you must have some sort of knowledge about the media types and link relations to expect. That is what the global registry (IANA) is for. If you apply REST inside the enterprise, an enterprise-global registry will suffice, meaning you do not necessarily have to register all your media types with IANA....but you can, of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Or are even all response part implicit part of the contract?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jakob\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
