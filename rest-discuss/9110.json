So a company\n&gt; &gt; &gt; publishing a web API can either tell it&#39;s potential\n&gt; &gt; &gt; users to follow the pure REST hypermedia model, or do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; URI construction. And if they do the former, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likely to get a lot more people using it. Which would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you chose? If you say hypermedia, I can tell we are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussing a hypothetical question and not one on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which your livelihood depends. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seeing as I&#39;m primarily a Perl hacker, I&#39;ll just point\n&gt; &gt; to WWW::Mechanize for this matter. Proof&#39;s in eating\n&gt; &gt; the pudding. Doing hypermedia is very easy given\n&gt; &gt; tooling that abstracts the rote work. I&#39;m basing this\n&gt; &gt; on actual experience, not hypothesis, much as you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; like to paint the REST proponents with the ivory tower\n&gt; &gt; brush.\n&gt; \n&gt; To expand on this point: saying &quot;it&#39;s easy for great\n&gt; developers to write hypermedia clients&quot; sounds to me like\n&gt; the following would if the clock were turned back 15\n&gt; years: &quot;it&#39;s easy for great developers to implement HTTP\n&gt; clients&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; So imagine the clock having turned forward a few years\n&gt; and then consider the argument that hypermedia is hard to\n&gt; program to again.\n\nAh, but I&#39;m not talking about 2022, I&#39;m talking about 2007.  As times change\nbest practices change.  Imagine me saying &quot;Let&#39;s set up an international\ndiscussion group for regular people&quot; in 1945.  That would be\nincomprehensible.  RoyTF&#39;s thesis has an abstract purity to it, but\npragmatically the hypermedia constraint is less then fully workable given\ncurrent realities. Given *those* constraints, it could well be that the\nbetter solution IS to offer up documentation for URL construction and avoid\nthe hypermedia constraint. That&#39;s the hypothesis I&#39;m stating.\n\n&gt; Hypermedia has the same simplicity story; it&#39;s easy to roll \n&gt; tooling for it \n\nNo it is NOT. For a Perl hacker, yes. For an average Joe, no.  Want to\naccelerate that?  Start writing open-source clients for well-known services\nin the mainstream languages (see the P.S.)\n\n&gt; and in due time the market will have consolidate on Good\n&gt; Enough existing tooling so that people won&#39;t have to,\n\nThat&#39;s I&#39;ll give you, and my position will probably need to be revised when\nthat reality exists.\n\nFYI, I will thank you however, for this dialog as it has helped me\nunderstand my own thoughts on the subject.  I previously felt that there was\nsomething wrong with the hypermedia constraint but could not put my finger\non it exactly.  Now I know it is simply that, at this point in time,\npublishing services requiring hypermedia traversal is less optimal for a\nclass of potential services than allowing clients to hardcode and/or\nconstruct URLs.  As tools evolve and become ubiquitious, and as well-known\nservices and their open-source clients emerge, use of hypermedia will evolve\nto being ideal in most if not all cases.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\nP.S.
