I&#39;ve decided to pursue development of a framework/httpd for\nimplementing my architectural style, using standalone FastCGI apps\nconfigured per resource &quot;type,&quot; following the design pattern laid out\nhere:\n\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/fastcgi/\n\nMarshalled by a non-blocking I/O core server component with HTTP cache\nconnector, so all output is held in RAM as compressed streams.  In order\nto farm out the development of standalone FastCGI modules, I need to be\nable to determine whether applicants posess enough of a REST skillset to\ngrok how their assigned module fits into the overall system.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
