It isn&#39;t publicly available (yet). \n\n&gt; B=\r\nelow I assume you think about in-browser (js) code that will be \n&gt; expandin=\r\ng the templates, right? \n\nIn my context, this isn&#39;t necessarily in-browser =\r\ncode, or js code (more likely Java, C# or Perl code). But yes, I &#39;m talking=\r\n about client side expansion of URI templates communicated by the server.\n\n=\r\n&gt; Anyway, in terms of HTML such I think the lists of contexts could be \n&gt; p=\r\nrovided by any repeating thing like ul/li, table/tr, p\n\nInteresting. This r=\r\nesonates with the problem Eric wrote about: dynamically passing a declarati=\r\nve description of constraints on allowed values for expansion. In your exam=\r\nple, you communicate a list of possible contexts for expansion. A context i=\r\ns a set of value for performing a given expansion. Do I understand correctl=\r\ny? If so, I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t directly pass to the client a list of =\r\nURI generated server-side by expanding the &quot;templates&quot; using the various co=\r\nntexts? I&#39;m certainly missing some pieces here!\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n"}}
