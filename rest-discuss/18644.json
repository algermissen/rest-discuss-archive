Yes if you define RESTFulness =\r\nas a badge that certifies you follow the\n&gt; rules. Yes, you can earn that ba=\r\ndge only in your server and forget about\n&gt; the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; b. NO, if you de=\r\nfine RESTFulness as the achievement of the expected\n&gt; quality properties yo=\r\nu seek for when using REST. And that NO is because the\n&gt; rules are made to =\r\nachieve a way of interaction between the components, and\n&gt; one of those com=\r\nponents is the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, client matters.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I had bee=\r\nn posting here, one component may not behave by the rules, but\n&gt; if that is=\r\n free license the architect is aware of and it is reasonable so\n&gt; that the =\r\nimpact will not break the business goals, that is fine. But if you\n&gt; need a=\r\n system where clients behave correctly, and you don&#39;t control the\n&gt; clients=\r\n, then your architecture must have controls and policy enforcement\n&gt; to avo=\r\nid those spoiled clients from ruining you day.

And let me\n&gt; clarify this: It should not be part of the server&#39;s=\r\n job to assure the\n&gt; client is working as it should.
