Here is an\n&gt; outline of what I am trying to do. I have a list of package names (approx\n&gt; 100), and I would like to allow users to search through these packages by\n&gt; providing a regular expression. Of course the package names that match the\n&gt; regex will be returned back to the client. So let me try and walk through how\n&gt; my mind is thinking about the REST way of doing this.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said a few times recently, in my personal opinion there is\nnothing wrong with a query as an optimization. I think that your\nsolution is absolutely fine as long as:\n\n 1. the list of 100 package names *is* exposed somewhere as a\nURI-addressable list for a client that would rather do iterative\ndiscovery rather than query-based discovery. You&#39;ve already said that\nyou&#39;ll do this.\n\n 2. each package has its own URI for hyperlinking both in the list\ndescribed in 1. and in the query results that you are already working\non. For client-simplicity, you should probably use the same XML\nvocabulary for the query results as for the &quot;full list&quot;.\n\n 3. if packages can be mutated or deleted, you use the appropriate HTTP\nmethod and not queries.\n\nSo overall my opinion is that you are on the right track!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
