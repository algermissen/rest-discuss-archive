And it\n&gt; seems that both are equally important to REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts/comments/suggestions?\n\nI am still trying to get a grip on my thinking, but the point is\nthat state means a different thing for the server than for the\nclient. The client may keep implicit state that persists across\nrequests, but the server may not. State on the server is always\nexplicit, exposed via resources.\n\nThatâ€™s not a satisfactory explanation, but my understanding is\nnot yet coherent enough to express it much better than that.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
