The\n&gt; complexities of Irish dialect are interesting, but they&#39;re hardly\n&gt; relevant to this discussion - what is your point here exactly?\n\nThe point is that the thing that is normative is &quot;law number 3 in gaelic&quot;. \nWhich is a different resource from &quot;law number 3 in english&quot;. The parent \nresource, the thing you may or may not assign a URI to is &quot;law number 3&quot; and \neverybody understand what law you talk about. both an english and an irish \nversion (aka representation) of such law exist, but you *care* that they are \ndifferent, as only one of them is normative.\n\nAs such they&#39;re not conneged represetnations but two separate resources that \nhappen to be two represetnations of a common thing.\n\nThe point Jon was making is that, if you imply that Accept is needed on top \nof the URI for such different representations to be accessible, only a UA \nknowing about HTML 5 (or code *you wrote* to understand the need for Accept) \nwill be able to directly identify both resources distinctly.\n\nYou not only break the addressability concern, you also break serendipity.\n\n&gt; Well then why bother making the distinction between resource and\n&gt; representation?\n\nBecause some resources are not representations, while some representations \nare not resources.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m suggesting that these can all be achieved using HTTP conneg and\n&gt; using URIs just as they were intended; to identify resources.\n\nURIs were intended and are used (in terms of webarch) to identify \n*anything*. That includes resources *things* and representations \n*documents*.\n\n&gt; This is not possible\n&gt; presently because there is no mechanism in markup to indicate the\n&gt; appropriate HTTP conneg headers for a request.\n\nI believe you&#39;re overestimating what conneg was intended for. As a general \nrule, you conneg representations when no one gives a damn about which one \nthey get.\n\nAs such, getting a png or a jpg whenever an image is requested depends on \nthe capabilities of the platform. If the user needs to be in control, you \n300 or 303 and you use links with properly addressed representations \n(separate URIs).\n\n&gt;&gt;   [examples where cachce invalidatioon doesn&#39;t work]\n&gt;\n&gt; HATEOAS ?\n\nNot sure I get you.\n\n&gt; If the PUT didn&#39;t &#39;go through&#39; them; then they aren&#39;t an intermediary,\n&gt; are they?\n\nBecause your intermediary and my intermediary when talking about proxies \nwill be different, and they do not communicate together.\n\nYour caching (staleness) strategy has to deal with one chain of \nintermediaries between each user and the origin server. Hence my proxy may \ninvalidate /document.xml because i PUT, but yours wont.\n\nSeb \n\n\n"}}
