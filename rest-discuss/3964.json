Therefore you need\n&gt; at least an uri list.\n\nYes, you obviousl=\r\ny need a URI.  The question is whether it make sense to \nprovide the inform=\r\nation available from the URI along with the URI itself. \nWhy not provide th=\r\ne URI along with the resource itself?\n\n&gt;&gt; HEAD gives you the content-type w=\r\nhich implies both the allowed POSTable\n&gt;&gt; types and the allowed query strin=\r\ngs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose that the default content-type is html, to be complient with=\r\n\n&gt; browsers (like IE) that ask for */* (even if the purpose of your service=\r\n\n&gt; is to be queried by a specific client dealing with xml).\n&gt; Therefore, th=\r\ne submission method is an html form, and thus the\n&gt; content-type is www-url=\r\n-encoded. How do you then specify the names and\n&gt; the types of the form&#39;s f=\r\nields ?\n\nA HEAD of /collection.xml returns content-type: application/shoe-o=\r\nrders+xml\nSome research on this content-type tells you that it looks like t=\r\nhis:\n &lt;orders&gt;\n  &lt;order custId=3D&quot;asdsad&quot; addrId=3D&quot;abc123&quot; cartId=3D&quot;abc12=\r\n3&quot; ccNo=3D&quot;.....   /&gt;\n  ...\n &lt;/orders&gt;\n\nThe schema tells you which elements=\r\n are required and which are optional.\nSince the translation from form-encod=\r\ned of these name value pairs to an \nupdate to this object is obvious, the c=\r\nontent-type tells you everything you \nneed to know about the form.\n\nSo now =\r\nyou create a form located at /form.html\nit POSTs to /collection.xml\n\nThe se=\r\nrver responds:\n  201 Created\n  Location: postedobjectlocation\n  Content-typ=\r\ne: text/plain\n\n  Thank you for posting.\n\nThe end user is never directly exp=\r\nosed to the application/shoe-orders+xml \ntype.\n\nNote: It would be more eleg=\r\nant if there was a variant of multipart/mixed \nthat had a types parameter w=\r\nhich constrained the set of types allowed in \nthe mix, but I am not aware o=\r\nf an RFC that looks like that so we are stuck \nwith the above.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n__=\r\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.
