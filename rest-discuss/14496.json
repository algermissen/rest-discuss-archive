Even the third party APIs incur epic fail=\r\nure when subject to this basic eyeball test.\n\nActually, Amazon&#39;s API docume=\r\nntation for programming languages is also inconsistent in how it wraps HTTP=\r\n, from language to language.  The sample C# code is simply wrong and broken=\r\n, stupid and ugly.  It doesn&#39;t even pass through the FxCop/StyleCop rules g=\r\nauntlet.
