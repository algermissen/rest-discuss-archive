There are users, groups,=\r\n and news feeds for users and groups. There are also business related objec=\r\nts of many types.  Interested in getting your opinion on a design question.=\r\n\n\nWhen you think about getting or posting content to a news feed for a user=\r\n or group, which of the below is more natural?\n\nOption A\n\n/feeds/entity/:id=\r\n/items     # to post, delete feed items or get\n                         # g=\r\nroup or business object related feed items\n/feeds/user/:user_id/items  # to=\r\n get/post/delete feed items relating to a user\n/users/:id                  =\r\n         # to get user profile\n/users/:id/followers        # to get/add fol=\r\nlowers\n... there are lots of other child resources under users\n/groups/:id\n=\r\n/groups/:id/members          # to get/add followers\n/object/:id            =\r\n      # get info about the object\n\nOR\n\nOption B\n\n/users/:id/feeds/items    =\r\n   # to get/post/delete feed data \n/groups/:id/feeds/items      # to get/po=\r\nst/delete feed data\n/users/:id                     # to get user profile\n/u=\r\nsers/:id/followers         # to get/add followers\n... lots of other child r=\r\nesources under users\n/groups/:id\n/groups/:id/members          # to get/add =\r\nfollowers\n/object/:id/feed/items       # get a feed related to an object\n/o=\r\nbject/:id                         # get info about the object\n\nThe advantag=\r\ne of A is that you can use the same URL for all posts (but not for reads be=\r\ncause users have different types of feeds than groups or the various busine=\r\nss objects). The advantage of the latter is it shows the type of parent the=\r\n feed belongs to and may be used for reads or writes or the other actions t=\r\nhat live under each type of parent (like users or groups).\n\n\n"}}
