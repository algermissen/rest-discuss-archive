Josh&#39;s suggestion of using\n&gt; hypermedia has actually been implemented by WMS\n&gt; clients. \n\nI don&#39;t believe there is any constraint in REST\nthat says you cannot use heaps of name/value pairs\nin URLs. There may however be practical limits \nthat suggest it may not be a good idea.\n\nIn theory URLs can be arbitrarily long. In practice\nURLS more that 1K in size may not be handled by\nsome components on the Web.\n\nI know that is a bit vague but I have seen the 1K limit\nmentioned previously on this list. Just not sure where.\n\n&gt; In addition, if my memory serves me\n&gt; right, OGC&#39;s Web Mapping Service also allow an\n&gt; XML encoding of request parameters, and the WMS\n&gt; client composes an xml file and send it to the\n&gt; WMS server using POST, which is definately not\n&gt; REST IMHO.\n\nOn the contrary, this is a perfectly valid solution\nto the problem. There is nothing wrong with posting\ncomplex data to a resource.\n\nUse GET when you can, use POST when you must.\n\n&gt; In the xml encoding case, can one make it restful? \n\nno-op\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n"}}
