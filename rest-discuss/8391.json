Maybe this will help: \n\n&lt;http://www.w3.or=\r\ng/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html&gt; \n\n&gt; The analogy with procedure call holds s=\r\ntill when looking at combined forms: The \n&gt; hierarchical part of the URL is=\r\n paused first, and then the semi-colon separated qualifiers \n&gt; are paused a=\r\ns indicating positions in some matrix. As an example let&#39;s imagine the URL =\r\n\n&gt; of an automatically generated map in which the parameters for latitude, =\r\nlongitude and \n&gt; scale are given separately. Each may be named, and each if=\r\n omitted may take a default. \n&gt; So, for example,\n&gt; \n&gt;          //moremaps.c=\r\nom/map/color;lat=3D50;long=3D20;scale=3D32000\n\nor translating into your exa=\r\nmple:\n\n/speciesAbundancePlot;site1=3DHAZARDS;site2=3DANACAPA;species1=3DPCL=\r\nA;species2=3DCNIC\n\n-Ray\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, John Panzer &lt;=\r\njpanzer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris Burdess wrote:\n&gt; &gt; under.bluewaters wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; /plotAbundance?site1=3DHAZARDS&site2=3DANACAPA&species1=3DPC=\r\nLA&species2=3DCNIC\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically, its an RPC call that accepts and ar=\r\nbitrary number of sites\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and species.
