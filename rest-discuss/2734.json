Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure everybody interested in Web notifications has noticed, but the\n&gt; world of blogs has built pub/sub mechanisms. Very useful, but not very REST.\n&gt; But of course, that&#39;s the way the Web was built too...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There are two approaches (that I know of - I&#39;m a newbie to blog\n&gt; infrastructure)\n&gt;  - trackback (from MoveableType)\n&gt;  - pingback\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally these both allow a blog to subscribe to a different blog - the\n&gt; original blog is then notified when new entries are added to the second\n&gt; blog, etc.\n&gt; Unfortunately, neither use the terms publish, subscribe, notify, etc. very\n&gt; often. The term &#39;ping&#39; generally means &#39;notify&#39;.\n\nAt Sam Ruby&#39;s suggestion, I have spoken with the inventor of trackback \nabout being more REST-y. He&#39;s open to the idea but we haven&#39;t converged \non a final design and development plan yet. He used the term REST in his \nliterature so he was trying to do the right thing but various \nimplementation quirks pushed him towards using non-idempotent GETs. I \nthink future versions will fix that.\n\nI don&#39;t know anything about PingBack. If there is anything better there \nmaybe it could be incorporated into the TrackBack refactoring.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; This seems more cooler... they provide for an HTTP response header\n&gt; X-Pingback, as well as a &lt;link&gt; tag in HTML and XHTML: &lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot;\n&gt; href=&quot;http://charlie.example.com/pingback/xmlrpc&quot;&gt;\n\nTrackback uses RDF.\n\n&gt; They also say &quot;HTTP headers are defined to override link elements when they\n&gt; differ.&quot; - I wonder if this is wise, given that its easier to change content\n&gt; than response headers. I think this happened with HTTP/HTML &lt;meta\n&gt; http-equiv&gt; tags.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also use XML-RPC instead of pure HTTP.\n&gt; method: pingback.ping\n&gt; description: Notifies the server that a link has been added to sourceURI,\n&gt; pointing to targetURI.\n\nAt least it is using POST as POST instead of as GET.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s interesting to consider the difference between notifications (that a\n&gt; link was added) and an explicit request (add a link to the &#39;referenced-by&#39;\n&gt; collection). Both need a magic name - either &#39;pingback.ping&#39; (the name of\n&gt; the method) or &#39;referenced-by&#39; (the name of the collection). With a custom\n&gt; named method, you need another magic name to get a list (apparently not\n&gt; discussed in the pingback spec). With a named collection, you just use GET\n&gt; on that same collection.\n\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;ve been suggesting. POST extends the collection of \ntrackbacks. GET returns the list of trackbacks.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
