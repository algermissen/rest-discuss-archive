Mike Dierken [mailto:mdierken@...]\n\n&gt; This might be a circular argument, but the Web\nuses/should-use/is-defined-by\n&gt; REST principles.\n&gt; The term &#39;REST&#39; explicitly means &#39;transfer state&#39; - and if you use an\n&gt; approach to invoke\n&gt; arbitrary functions then it is not a &#39;transfer state&#39; approach - it isn&#39;t\n&gt; REST. (of course, this is only my opinion).\n\nWhether web and REST is synonymous is a difficult question.  Even Roy admits\nthat there are many websites that use URIs and implementations that are not\nRESTful.  We can encourage REST, but the web is what it is warts and all.\n\nAnd as I replied to Seth, I don&#39;t think invoking a function or method is not\nmutually exclusive with transfer of state.\n\n&gt; There can be value in invoking functions over a network, and there are a\nlot\n&gt; of technologies to do it (rpc, corba, dcom, xml-rpc, soap-rpc, etc.), and\n&gt; many make it easy to use in many languages. However, the whole REST\nposition\n&gt; is that transfering state via a small number of functions is a different\nbut\n&gt; fully functional approach and many believe it is better at large scales.\n\nI don&#39;t know if it is &quot;fully functional&quot; if it precludes the creation of\nprocedural applications.  And as for whether procedural applications can\nwork at the large scale, I think that has more to do with loose coupling vs.\ntight coupling as opposed to procedural vs. representational.\n\n&gt; Building more/better toolkits for invoking functions over a network is\nfine\n&gt; and there are interesting things that can be done, but that approach is\n&gt; fundamentally different than one where your primary goals are to transfer\n&gt; state and identify resources. It may be that there are some problems that\n&gt; are hard to cast into a resource-modeling/state-transfer approach, and\nI&#39;ve\n&gt; got no problem shifting to an &#39;invoke function&#39; approach for those\nproblems,\n&gt; but I do have a problem with calling that approach &#39;web compatible&#39; or\n&#39;part\n&gt; of REST&#39; or whatever. There&#39;s nothing wrong with having networked\n&gt; applications &#39;outside the Web&#39; or not using REST when its too hard to make\na\n&gt; particular problem fit into the Web architecture.\n\nThis is fair enough.  But where we run into problems is if want to promote\nREST as a better way to do web services, but then we tell people that they\ncan&#39;t write procedural web services in REST and they must go else where if\nthey want to write procedural web services.\n\n//Joe\n\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
