This form would POST\n&gt; the PO to the server.  In this case, that same PO is considered to be\n&gt; nothing more than &quot;data&quot;.\n\nIt might be easier to use JavaScript to take the Form data, make an XML \ndocument out of it, and use XMLHttpConnection (or whatever that \nJavaScript object is called) to PUT that XML document.\n\nYou&#39;re right in that every resource should have a URI.  There has been \ndiscussion here on this list regarding how that URI is created.  Since \nthis information is coming from a browser, which cannot host resources, \nthis issue is hard.  One solution is to use UUIDs to provide a unique \nidentifier for the resource.  A UUID is unique over time and space.  And \nbecause URIs should be opaque to the end user, a URI can easily be built \nfrom a UUID.  That way, the client has decided on the resource name, and \ncan assume it has not clashed with a current resource name.\n\nAnother benefit of the client creating the resource name is that it \nalways knows this resource name.  So it can continue to check that URI \nvia GET for its latest status.\n\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms010100030103020806040406\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms010100030103020806040406--\r\n\n"}}
