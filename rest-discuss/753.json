It is consequently simpler. \n\nIt has first-class concepts of &quot;resource&quot;, &quot;representation&quot;, &quot;method&quot;,\n&quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;. Methods are HTTP methods like PUT, GET, DELETE,\nYOURMETHOD. Inputs are like HTTP method inputs: headers, query params\nand body (the URI is implied by the resource!). Outputs are like HTTP\noutputs: status code, headers and body. Resources know what\nrepresentations they support and you can navigate from resource to\nresource through hyperlinks without worrying about the XML or HTML\nsyntax of the representation (unless you want to). Following a hyperlink\nis a type-safe operation.\n\nThat&#39;s about all the concepts in it.\n\nA rough proposal for an API (Java-ish syntax to prove it isn&#39;t biased\ntowards dynamic languages) is provided. Everything is statically type\nchecked just as with IDL or WSDL. Of course in Python everything would\nbe done at runtime and thus save a build step.\n\nWhen I implement it I think it will be a really cool tool. Until then, I\nthink it is a useful pedagogic tool for those working on REST Zen. If\n*you* want to implement it before I get around to it, in whatever\nlanguage, please do. I&#39;ll work with you to clear up any fuzzy parts of\nthe spec.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
