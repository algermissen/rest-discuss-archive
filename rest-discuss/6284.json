Feel free to use the code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks Andrew.\n&gt; As it happens, the &#39;server&#39; side is C# so that&#39;s an ideal starting point.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Nic said, both ends will have to be updated, and, depending on the\n&gt; &gt; complexity of your production environment infrastructure, your server\n&gt; &gt; implementation may need to do SSL/HTTPS during development and not in\n&gt; &gt; production because a hardware accelerator may be used for SSL\n&gt; &gt; termination.  It just depends.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does indeed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The client side is in Java, so I&#39;m on firmer ground with JSSE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n***************************************************************************************************\nThe information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged Access to this email by anyone other than the intended addressee is unauthorized.
