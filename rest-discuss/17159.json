Bowman wrote:\n&gt;&gt; J�rn Wildt wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the reasons for turning to REST is simplicity. By adding\n&gt;&gt;&gt; layers of RDFa onto HTML the API becomes more difficult to consume\n&gt;&gt;&gt; compared to a straight forward XML format. If I present a REST API to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my customers that makes it (a lot) more difficult to consume than a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; SOAP API then I loose some of my selling points.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What I&#39;ve been trying to explain, is that RDFa exists separately from\n&gt;&gt; the REST API.  Complexity ensues when the solution to m2m is the\n&gt;&gt; creation of custom media types bound to the nature of the data -- REST\n&gt;&gt; says it&#39;s simpler to use a generic media type, and solve m2m at another\n&gt;&gt; layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, do see \n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-754 \n&gt; for more on this, here&#39;s a snippet:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When representations are provided in hypertext form with typed \n&gt; relations (using microformats of HTML, RDF in N3 or XML, or even SVG), \n&gt; then automated agents can traverse these applications almost as well as \n&gt; any human. There are plenty of examples in the linked data communities. \n&gt; More important to me is that the same design reflects good human-Web \n&gt; design, and thus we can design the protocols to support both machine and \n&gt; human-driven applications by following the same architectural style.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That list would include RDFa now, and RDF in N3 is quoted specifically \n&gt; over other RDF formats because RDF in N3 has basic hypermedia semantics, \n&gt; in that it&#39;s the only (current) RDF representation other than RDFa to \n&gt; specifically mention dereferencing URIs.\n\nwhoops, almost forgot, XML and SVG are mentioned because &quot;If they are \nkeying off of something unique within the content (like an XML namespace \ndeclaration that extends the semantics of a generic type), then it�s \nokay.&quot; - xml namespace of course being shorthand for a prefix+term \nconcatenated to define the URI of properties (like you see in link \nrelations) which can have their own (hypermedia) semantics.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
