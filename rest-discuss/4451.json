This argues that HTML \n&gt; FORM GETs are a bad way of creating URIs because they are \n&gt; fabricated.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of discussion about how the URIs in a REST\nsystem should look. Or how they map to server data structures. \n\nMaybe I&#39;m behind the times here -- Roy seems to want a WSDL-like\ntechnology to allow you to compose URIs. But does the URI really\nmatter?\n\nPaul Prescod argues[1] that the URIs in a REST system ought to be\nthought of as opaque. You would only discover them as links from other\nresults obtained in the REST system.\n\nYou could unite different servers with totally different\nURI-construction conventions this way -- just like the HTML web.\n\nOf course you might *want* the URI to make sense to a human, but that\ncould be ad hoc and cosmetic.\n\n\n[1] See point 3 on &lt;http://prescod.net/rest/mistakes/&gt;: &quot;My rule of\nthumb is that clients only construct URIs when they are building\nqueries (and thus using query strings). Those queries return\nreferences to objects with opaque URIs.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
