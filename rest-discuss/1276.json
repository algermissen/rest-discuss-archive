Unfortunately I haven&#39;t\nworked out how to view ppt files in Linux yet, nor do I think I should\nhave to. So reading your tutorial will have to wait until I next boot\nan operating system that has an application that can view that\nproprietary format.\n\nPerhaps your REST tutorial resource URI should follow REST\nprinciples? ;)\n\nThen I could:\n\nGET /rest/tutorial?flavor=html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.xfront.com\n\nor following Paul&#39;s content negotiation suggestion:\n\nGET /rest/tutorial HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.xfront.com\nAccept: text/plain, text/html\n\nand hopefully get a version of the tutorial that my browser can\nrender.\n\nRegards,\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
