Instead  \n&gt; of a\n&gt; (Java) API call you&#39;d be making HTTP calls only.\n&gt;\n\nThanks John and Subbu for this idea. It does seem like a good way to  \nget going.\nAs more and more applications become web enabled, one even wonders if  \nthis should\nnot come with the operating system...\n\nDoes anyone know of a small proxy cache for clients written in java?\n\nMy client probably will need to keep close track of all the headers  \nand redirects of the call, so that it\ncan help people debug the services they encounter on the web, and also  \nbecause it will be useful to know which things are information  \nresources and which are not. For example Tim Bray is not an  \ninformation resource - though he is very resourceful source of  \ninformation - as you can see by querying\n\ncurl -i -L -H &quot;Accept: application/rdf+xml&quot; http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Bray\n\nHenry\n\n\n&gt; On 11/9/07, Story Henry &lt; henry.story@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am writing a hyperdata web browser client, and was wondering if\n&gt; &gt; there were client side java libraries  to cache http responses, so\n&gt; &gt; that I could ask the local cache for a URL and it would return me  \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; cached version if there were no reason to get something fresh from  \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; web, or go out and get something on the web.
