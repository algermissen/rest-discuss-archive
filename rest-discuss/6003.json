If\n&gt; you had been maintaining the state of my shopping basket on your  \n&gt; server,\n&gt; then when I login (or maybe even without logging in), you can say  \n&gt; &quot;Here\n&gt; are the shopping baskets you&#39;re filling, would you like to pick one of\n&gt; them up and finish shopping?&quot;. You can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re stashing\n&gt; session state in the URL. Also, there only needs to be &#39;one&#39; shopping\n&gt; basket, and such a model would correlate better with reality. This  \n&gt; model\n&gt; you propose creates an entirely new basket for each additional item.\n&gt; You&#39;re not doing that because it makes sense. You&#39;re doing that in a\n&gt; vain attempt to deny session state.\n&gt;\nWell, having one basket per user is a fine design choice, but in that  \ncase the user couldn&#39;t &quot;interact with two instances of the  \napplication,&quot; as you put it in your initial email in this thread. To  \naccomplish this, I think you could simply associate the ID of the  \nlatest shopping basket snapshot created by the user with the user ID  \nitself. So if a user has lost all of those snapshot URLs because of a  \nbrowser crash, you can always point them back to the latest one.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
