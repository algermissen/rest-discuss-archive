The goal is to allow all of our\n&gt; customers to access our api so they can get information regarding\n&gt; their account/transactions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Creating the resources seem fairly straight forward. For example, each\n&gt; customer can access a list of their transactions via a URL such as:\n&gt; http://webapi.ourdomain.com/customer/123/transactions\n&gt;\n&gt; The question I have is how to I secure the application such that\n&gt; customer 123 only has access to /customer/123/* ??\n&gt;\n&gt; I am developing the application using the RESTEasy framework running\n&gt; in Tomcat. I am familiar with basic servlet authentication. However,\n&gt; we are likely to have more and more customers and do not want to\n&gt; modify the web.xml and redeploy for every new customer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there an approach to configuring multiple client authentication\n&gt; without having to redeploy each time?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nSubhash Chandran S\n\nhttp://indiwiz.com/\n\n"}}
