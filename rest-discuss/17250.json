And cloud storage services like Amazon S3 are nice examples of\nRESTful service. Likewise we&#39;ve seen some nice work in the version\ncontrol space [2] that fits well w/ REST&#39;s use of Hypermedia as the\nEngine of Application State constraint. One could venture to say that\nthe success of these technologies on the Web has largely been the\nresult of the thought that has gone into REST.\n\n//Ed\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_7\n[2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5829\n[3] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_3_3\n\n"}}
