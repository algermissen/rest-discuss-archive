It&#39;s the only thing you can use. \n\nThat said, this example&#39;s use of cookies is pretty bad.\n\n    Vincent&gt; For example, I think its pretty much impossible to do\n    Vincent&gt; useful authentication/authorisation and login/logout\n    Vincent&gt; functionality without cookies, because of useless browser\n    Vincent&gt; support for HTTP auth. But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t\n    Vincent&gt; ways you can win by keeping the rest of your app RESTful\n    Vincent&gt; in its design.\n\nThere has been a thread on this with some very convincing code that it\nis possible. Next time I&#39;ve to do HTTP auth, I will definitively give\nthis a try.\n\n\n    Vincent&gt; Still, reading the code, I think the cookie is there so\n    Vincent&gt; the shopping cart can be repopulated after quitting the\n    Vincent&gt; browser, or a reload. Pretty orthogonal to maintaining\n    Vincent&gt; connection state. A *good* use of cookies, dare I say?\n\nNo IMO. If you use a cookie, you would need only one. A session state\nidentifier. Rest of session variables are stored at the server.\n\n\n    Vincent&gt; I&#39;ll probably study this properly over the weekend to\n    Vincent&gt; find out for sure, but I have a hard time seeing how you\n    Vincent&gt; couldn&#39;t POST a representation of the array of ordered\n    Vincent&gt; items.\n\nFrom an HTTML form and browser? Impossible I would say.\n\n-- \nRegards,\n\nBerend. (-:\n\n\n"}}
