That is, each request contains all of the\ninformation necessary for a connector to understand the request, independent of\nany requests that may have preceded it.&quot;\n\nSo when you say:\n&quot;No, the POST invocation isn&#39;t RESTful by itself.  In the examples people have\ngiven, the client expects that a particular POST invocation will result in a\nresource being created (and furthermore, that this resource will have a\nparticular relationship to the POSTed representation).&quot;\n\nIt is the user that has the expectations and not the client and the\n&quot;relationship to the POSTed representation&quot; that you speak off does not exist\nas the interaction is stateless. The client is expecting only &quot;response control\ndata, optional resource metadata, and an optional representation.&quot;\n\nAlso when you say:\n&quot;resources cannot be expected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the\nresults of the specified query in the POST response, or in the form of another\nresource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an expectation\nis not uniform.&quot;\n\nHTTP doesnt need to know that you are performing a Query-over-POST just as it\ndoes not need to know that you are annotating an existing resources or Posting\na message to a bulletin board.\n\nAnd according to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9\n&quot;The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server\nand is usually dependent on the Request-URI.&quot;\n\nand,\n\n&quot;If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be 201\n(Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and\nrefers to the new resource, and a Location header&quot;\n\nThe fact that the above statement begins with a &quot;If&quot; itself signifies that the\nclient does not need to know anything more than dealing with the appropriate\n&quot;response control data, optional resource metadata, and an optional\nrepresentation&quot; and therefore signifies that the interface is uniform.\n\nSandeep\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
