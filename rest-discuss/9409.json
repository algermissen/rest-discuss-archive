This added confusion may be worse than the technical\n&gt;non-idempotence of your original two stage DELETE.\n&gt;\n\nHow so?  A user on my system can issue a DELETE and the resource will \nbe removed, there is no requirement for additional headers.  What is \nwrong with one DELETE resulting in the resource being removed and \nresponding 410 Gone?  No added semantics involved, no If-Match \nrequired, so easy anyone can do it, nobody but me needs to know about \nthe second DELETE as it is administrative in nature.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I am not going to suggest that you not implement this, but I must\n&gt;suggest that you consider, when you have received as much resistance\n&gt;as your two stage DELETE has, if it is worth all the trouble. Many\n&gt;people have had a bad reaction to various aspects of this idea.\n&gt;\n\nI refuse to consider most of the &quot;bad reactions&quot; that have come about \nhere, as they either quote a section of RFC 2616 without explaining \njust what the problem is they&#39;re seeing, or frame their objections \nin terms of some other example like a trashcan.  The only time I \nwill change what I am doing due to a &quot;bad reaction&quot; here is if the \nobjection makes sense, not because there&#39;s a standard kneejerk \nobjection here to anyone doing anything different.\n\nThe only &quot;is it worth all the trouble&quot; question I ask myself, \npertains to posting my ideas to this list, because the helpful \nresponses tend to be few and far between, with lots of people \nassuming I must be wrong because a lot of other people assume I \nam wrong and start insisting that maybe that&#39;s a valid reason to \nnot do what I am doing.  The only result of this is that when it \ncomes to REST, I will prefer to keep my own counsel.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
