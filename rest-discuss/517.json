Can IMAP do content-negotiation so that I can\nask for a particular message in different content-types depending on the\nclient?\n\nAnyhow, what makes IMAP particularly weak compared to HTTP is that it\nisn&#39;t designed to allow the server to do arbitrary computation in the\ngeneration of responses. It accepts data and moves data but it can&#39;t\ngenerate it without warping the protocol.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ODBC/SQL is also nice from the perspective you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give.  The problem is that it does not specify a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way of passing the types of objects!!!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also not very well geared for large scale, loosely coupled computing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why?\n\nExposing your relational database schema to the world is not good\nencapsulation!\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I think it is the main benefit of the protocol and\n&gt; the big problem with most RPC protocols.  They\n&gt; don&#39;t provide a standard way of representing\n&gt; all types.\n\nWe&#39;ll have to agree to disagree. The list of MIME types are part of the\nInternet. Any protocol can easily adopt the relevant ones.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
