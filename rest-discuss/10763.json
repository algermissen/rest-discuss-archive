Is there a\nRESTful way for a server to let a client fetching a multimedia\nresource to know that there is a metadata resource associated with it?\n\nIt&#39;s possible to use content negotiation for an aspect of the\nexchange.  If the metadata and multimedia were considered different\nrepresentations of the same resource, they could be distinguished by\nmedia type and fetched separately by using the Accept header.\n\nHow does the client learn that this is an option, given that it starts\nwith a single multimedia URI?\n\nIf the method relies on request and response headers, how can an AJAX\napp view and control the headers?\n\n"}}
