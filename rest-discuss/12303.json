REST is distributed, there are no boundaries, it\n&gt; therefore does not have the notion of an API.\n&gt; \n\nIf you&#39;re saying that I&#39;m patently wrong, then I disagree, but that\nisn&#39;t clear.\n\nREST is an architectural style, i.e. a mansion, not the house itself.\nREST has no concept of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, even though that address\nis a mansion.  We can talk about a RESTful API implementation, but we\ncan&#39;t use that API implementation as a definition of REST, any more\nthan we can state that any mansion that doesn&#39;t look like the White\nHouse must not be a mansion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I can talk about an API, the set of resources and media types I\n&gt; decided to document, or read about someone else, of for the purpose\n&gt; of containing a discussion we agreed to look at. But there is no\n&gt; cohesion unit of API under REST to which this litmus test can apply.\n&gt; \n\nRight, REST is not a protocol, merely a design pattern.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ironically this pursuit of &quot;no resource may disappear unless directly\n&gt; DELETEed&quot; has resulted in this litmus test which is both tightly\n&gt; coupled and allowing non-uniformity, as seen in the context of\n&gt; distributed architecture.\n&gt; \n\nThis is not what I have been saying.  The _client_ can&#39;t disappear any\nresource unless it calls the DELETE method of that resource.  The\nserver can do (almost) whatever it wants.  But the client is\nconstrained to requesting one action against one URI at a time.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
