Pagaltzis wrote:\n\n&gt; as we know, the key constraint of REST is\n&gt; \n&gt; Hypermedia as the engine of application state\n&gt; \n&gt; As most of us probably have noticed, that makes for one bulky\n&gt; linguistic entity. It is, to be frank, a mouthful. Being,\n&gt; however, that it is the most important aspect of REST, it also\n&gt; comes up a lot whenever I try to explain REST or discourse about\n&gt; it. Consequently, conducting such conversation is often awkward\n&gt; and straining.\n\nAgree. Being a Chinese, I have the similar feeling for the Chinese\ntranslation of the phrase. For the Chinese and those curious, my\ntranslation is: “超媒体作为应用状态的引擎”\n\n&gt; So here is my proposal: let’s shorten the awkward part of the\n&gt; phrase, “as the engine of”, to a single word meaning the same\n&gt; thing: “driving”. Now, any rephrasing is not going to put the\n&gt; focus on “hypermedia” quite in the same way as Roy’s phrasing\n&gt; manages to, which is the trade-off; in return, however, we get\n&gt; a term that is much easier to incorporate into sentences:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hypermedia-driven application state\n\nYes, the direct translation will be: 超媒体驱动的应用状态, which I find\neasier to understand, at least to preach :-)\n\nSo, yes, +1.\n\n&gt; If people start using this, I suspect that “application” will\n&gt; frequently get shortened to “app”, which makes the phrase roll\n&gt; off the tongue even easier. In fact, read it out aloud:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hypermedia-driven app state\n\nno such short form in Chinese though.\n\n&gt; This, therefore, is my submission: let’s start referring to the\n&gt; constraint as “hypermedia-driven app state”.\n\nHas the consensus been reached yet? I believe only so will it not only\nbe good for the spread and adoption of the term but for the REST too.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n&gt; Respectfully yours,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm. org/ &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;&gt;\n\n-- \nZhang Yining\nURL:         http://www.zhangyining.net | http://www.yining.org\nmailto:      yining@... | zhang.yining@...\nFingerprint: 25C8 47AE 30D5 4C0D A4BB  8CF2 3C2D 585F A905 F033\n\n"}}
