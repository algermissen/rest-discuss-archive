I&#39;m beginning \nto suspect that any form of object persistence is a fantasy. Objects \ncannot be exported from their runtime environments; but that&#39;s a subject \nfor another thread and perhaps a different mailing list.\n\nThat being said, I&#39;m not sure distributed objects is really what \nJelliffe&#39;s proposing, but he should probably avoid using object oriented \nlanguage to describe what he is doing, which at first glance seems quite \nreasonable and commendable.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
