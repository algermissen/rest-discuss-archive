I do understand the benefits (decou=\r\npled clients) from this approach but the downside for me is that the client=\r\n needs to discover the links each time it tries access something i.e given =\r\nthe following hierarchy of resources:\n\n/collection1\ncollection1\n  |-sub1\n  =\r\n  |-sub1sub1\n\t|-sub1sub1sub1\n        \t|-sub1sub1sub1sub1\n    |-sub1sub2\n  |=\r\n-sub2\n    |-sub2sub1\n    |-sub2sub2\n  |-sub3\n    |-sub3sub1\n    |-sub3sub2\n=\r\n\nIf we follow the &quot;Client only need to know the root URI&quot; approach, then a =\r\nclient shall only be aware of the root URI i.e. /collection1 above and the =\r\nrest of URIs should be discovered by the clients through hypermedia links. =\r\nI find this cumbersome because each time a client needs to do a GET, say on=\r\n sub1sub1sub1sub1, should the client first do a GET on /collection1 and the=\r\n follow link defined in the returned representation and then do several mor=\r\ne GETs on sub resources to reach the desired resource? or is my understandi=\r\nng about connectedness completely wrong?\n\nBest regards,\nSuresh\n\n\n"}}
