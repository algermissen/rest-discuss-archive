As a corollary to (2) use nouns in the logical URI, not verbs. \n&gt; &gt; Resources are &quot;things&quot; not &quot;actions&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; URIs are like phone numbers - both are universal addressing schemes.  All\n&gt; I&#39;m saying is that we shouldn&#39;t arbitrarily discourage people from modeling\n&gt; &quot;actions&quot; as resources for those applications that makes sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Buying a book is a clearly an action.  You can abstract the URI into a noun\n&gt; by calling it a &quot;purchase transaction record&quot;, but to the end user pushing\n&gt; the &quot;buy&quot; button, it is still an action.\n\nRight, but GET on that URI does not initiate the action as you might\nexpect if it was really a verb and not a noun.\n\nI really think it just confuses things immensely to try and validate\nthe reasons for putting a method in a URI.  If it&#39;s not used as a\nmethod, then why bother trying?  Perhaps I&#39;ve just been doing this long\nenough that I never need to consider doing so.  Practice makes perfect,\nI suppose.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
