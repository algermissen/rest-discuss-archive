I actually argue about the term REST API since it comes, I think, from the idea that REST is a Service or RPC replacement.\n\n\nI think the whole notion of &#39;API&#39; is hindering RESTful thinking. The notions of &#39;service&#39;, &#39;interface&#39; and &#39;API&#39; suggest that the contract that informs and guides client side development is located at the server, that the client developer is coding against the interface provided by the server.\n\nWith REST, however, the contract is provided by the media types (and link rels) only. The client developer cannot even anticipate to what servers and services the interaction will lead the application.\n\nI think it is helpful to view server side development as exposing server-component managed (business-) state for serendipitous consumptions instead of viewing it as providing an &#39;application programmer&#39;s interface&#39;.\n\nA nice side effect of this view is that it immediately becomes evident that there cannot be any client side coding before specific media types have been decided upon.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
