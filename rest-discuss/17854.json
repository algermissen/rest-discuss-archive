If a reseller auth=\r\nenticates they see all their customers, if we authenticate we see all custo=\r\nmers. But a bookmark would not be the same for each.\n\nI guess this is somew=\r\nhat covered in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1771=\r\n4 but wanted to check if this is bad.\n\nLastly, what do you advise here:\n\n/a=\r\npi/v1/customers/{customer}/billing/invoices\n\nor\n\n/api/v1/billing/{customer}=\r\n/invoices - List of all bills\n\nor both? \n\nWe have partners/resellers too wh=\r\nich I can&#39;t decide on:\n\n/api/v1/resellers/customers/{customer}/billing/invo=\r\nices\n\nor does /customers change state depending on who is auth&#39;d like I&#39;ve =\r\nasked above? What have you done for customers/billing or layouts with diffe=\r\nrent authorization roles?\n\nI was looking at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/R=\r\nepository_RESTful_API_Reference\n\nThanks,\n\nGavin.\n\n\n"}}
