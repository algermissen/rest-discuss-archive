But for performance reasons we need to leave hooks into *this*\n&gt; &gt; project that will allow us to inline useful information later.\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO charter for the notifications design is partly to lay the groundwork for an\n&gt; update project to follow, which means in practice that anything that prevents\n&gt; later update extensions has a high burden of proof.  EG We should avoid\n&gt; specifying what&#39;s in the notification entity body, because that&#39;s the likely\n&gt; location of update data, but we should also not give a half-assed definition of\n&gt; what&#39;s in the update entity body, because that may make things harder on the\n&gt; update project.\n\nHere&#39;s a proposal for both the notify and update parts.\n\n 1. the client signs up for notification by doing a GET or HEAD with a\nspecial header.\n\n 2. the server does a POST or NOTIFY (argue that one out later) to the\nclient informing it that the resource is available. It MUST pre-announce\nwhether an immediate re-subscribe would succeed.\n\n 2. the client responds, optionally asking:\n  a) to be re-susbcribed (any flags or options the same)\n  b) for a representation of the resource to be PUT to a URI specified\nin a Location: header\n\n 3. the server does the requested PUT and re-SUB\n\nIf we have broad agreement on these, I could write it up.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
