So far, nothing compelling on this list.\n\nI&#39;m going to chime in as to what I think this all means, relying on\nintuition and observation based upon reading the O&#39;Reilly book, rather\nthan formal vocabularies and PhD&#39;s.\n\nIt seems to me that, whatever acronym you want to use, the &quot;Hypermedia\nEngine&quot; is basically the concept that resources should include not\njust their actual data, but representations of State applicable state\nchanges for that resource.\n\nSimply, resources include links for other operations.\n\nThere are several reasons for this.\n\nOne, is robustness.\n\nSince the commands are included within the resource, the actual\nmechanism for executing that command (the specific text of the link\nreference), can change over time without the client having to know or\ncare about that detail. This maintains the &quot;URI are opaque&quot; concept.\n\nThus, while systems move, and evolve, the clients can maintain stability.\n\nTwo, extensibility.\n\nIf the resource is itself naturally extensible, i.e. XML, JSON, or\nsome other format, then the command set for a resource can change over\ntime but older clients can remain stable.\n\nThree, is discovery.\n\nWhen you have an extensible interface, bundling the available state\nchanges can allow a developer of a client to be instantly aware of new\nfunctionality. This can happen before they&#39;re documented, before\nthey&#39;re announced, etc.\n\nWe have all been to a website and seen new links and actions appear\nover time with perhaps hardly 2 line announcement from the site owner.\n\nNow, given this, there are some conditions.\n\nSome formats simply aren&#39;t extensible. You can&#39;t augment a JPEG, for\nexample. But opaque formats tend to get wrappers for that very reason.\n\nThere is no expectation for clients (and by clients, I mean programs)\nto necessarily &quot;intuit&quot; what new commands do, or when they should be\nused. If the command set changes, it&#39;s implied that someone,\nsomewhere, will need to update their client code to make use of those\nnew services.\n\nAlso, obviously, the extra command set adds data to the overall\npayload, making it less efficient.\n\nWe tolerate this on a human driven web page because the\ndiscoverability is related to ease of use (no expectation that a user\nwould want to type in the address bar\n&quot;http://www.example.com/item/12345/reviews&quot; or whatever. No, they&#39;ll\njust click a link.\n\nBut, arguably, if you want to maintain the extensibility and\nrobustness of the system, and allow it to change beneath the clients\nfeet, you as a producer are obligated to provide this information\nevery time, in every packet.\n\nGiven that, tho, there is no expectation that a resource format remain\nstatic at all. If one day the service sends back format A, and the\nnext it sends out incompatible format B, then that&#39;s just the truth of\nit and clients will have to abruptly deal with that situation.\nClearly, if you&#39;re using XML, it would be kind to change the schema\ndeclaration so that a client can &quot;fail fast&quot;, rather than slogging\nthrough unfamiliar XML.\n\nIt would be nice if the service provider sent out some notice about\nthe pending change as well, so as not to disrupt clients. But, be that\nas it may, since the state changes are bundled within the payload, on\nthe off chance someone is blind sided by a format change, the new\npacket maintains its &quot;discoverability&quot; ideally allowing a developer to\nadapt quickly to the format as is, without necessarily having the\nformal documentation from the provider.\n\nSo, through these mechanisms, the network can remain robust, and even\nhave a bit of &quot;self-repairability&quot;. Certainly not in an automated\nsense, humans will be involved, but the quality is still there and it\ncan be effective.\n\nImagine the format changes from a consumer on the opposite side of the\nworld. That consumer may well be able to be back up and running with\nno input from the provider, rather than going through a length email\nexchange 12 hrs apart. Fixing the problem in 1hr vs several days of\nplaying email tag because neither party is conscious the same time as\nthe other.\n\nAnyway, that&#39;s the way I read this. This is my understanding of what\nis trying to be accomplished.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n\n"}}
