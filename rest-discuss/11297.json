I&#39;m\ninterested in anything that can plop down in front of an origin server and use\nthe basic freshness and/or validation mechanisms defined in RFC 2616 Section\n13 to serve up cached representations of resources generated by the origin\n(e.g., things that describe themselves as a &quot;reverse proxy cache&quot;,\n&quot;accelerator&quot;, or &quot;surrogate cache&quot;).\n\nFor example, each of the following function in some capacity as a gateway\nproxy cache:\n\n  * Apache2 mod_proxy + mod_cache\n  * Squid w/ reverse proxy config\n  * Varnish\n\nExamples of things that don&#39;t qualify:\n\n  * Pound - non-caching reverse proxy\n  * Perlbal - and other load balancer proxy type things\n  * Non-intermediary / integrated framework caching\n    systems (like Rails&#39;s) that aren&#39;t based on RFC 2616.\n\nI&#39;m also interested in systems like Django&#39;s caching framework[1], which\nperforms many of the caching features described in RFC 2616 but from inside\nthe origin server using WSGI middleware.\n\nAny information on which caching features are supported by these systems would\nalso be greatly appreciated (although I&#39;m planning to do this type of research\nso a simple link will do). For instance, Varnish caches only those responses\nthat include freshness information and does not perform validation when a\ncached entry goes stale. Stuff like:\n\n  * Support for &quot;Vary&quot;\n  * Validation (with ETag and/or Last-Modified)\n  * Invalidation (e.g., on PUT, POST, DELETE)\n  * Manual purge/invalidation strategy\n  * Supported cache storage (desk, shared mem, mmap, memcached, etc.)\n  * Anecdotes on configuration/deployment experiences\n\nIf this goes well, I&#39;ll publish a comparison matrix somewhere. My suspicion\nafter some light googling is that there aren&#39;t a whole lot of implementations\nout there so this could be a quick exercise (but I&#39;d love to be proved wrong).\n\nThanks,\nRyan\n\n[1]: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/\n   &quot;Django&#39;s Cache framework [docs.djangoproject.com]&quot;\n\n"}}
