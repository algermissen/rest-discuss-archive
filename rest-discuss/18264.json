Then I would=\r\nn&#39;t mind relaxing the constraints a bit. For instance by using a domain spe=\r\ncific media type like application/vnd.salesorder+xml.\n\nOr if it is inside a=\r\nn enterprise or similar where we have a bit more control over who is using =\r\nthe API. Then again we can relax the constraints a bit and use domain speci=\r\nfic media types (as has already been agreed upon in this list some time ago=\r\n).\n\nAnd so on. By relaxing the constraints we make it easier for ourselves =\r\nin the short term - but harder in the long term. Whether this is a problem =\r\nor not must depend on the intended use of the application.\n\nI think the big=\r\ngest problem from here is branding of our APIs. I want to call my API a RES=\r\nT API because people will then know what I am talking about. But strictly s=\r\npeaking I cannot do that since I coded it for the time frame of a few years=\r\n - not decades. What do I then do?\n\nMaybe Facebook got it right: pick a dif=\r\nferent name, &quot;Graph API&quot; or &quot;Linked Data API&quot;, and be big enough to brand t=\r\nhat as something better or equal to REST.\n\nHappy new year to all of you :-)=\r\n\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
