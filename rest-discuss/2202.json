The most popular response was &quot;http authentication&quot;.  Since I am\nworking on this project in PHP, I asked php.net&#39;s newsgroups where I might\nfind code for digest authentication (basic authentication is easy enough).\nWhat I got back was that PHP currently does not support digest\nauthentication (though I would have thought I could code around that\nproblem).  And to make things worse, it seems not a lot of browsers support\ndigest authentication in a compatible manner.  For instance, I came across\none article that says:\n\n    Opera and Amaya both support Apache&#39;s version of digest authentication\n    IE5+ both support IIS&#39;s version of digest authentication\n    Opera and Amays do not work with IIS and IE does not work with Apache\n\nNow, this may have changed with IE6, but I have not been able to find\nanything to substanciate that.\n\nSo, this leaves me with using basic authentication.  However, I am not crazy\nabout using it for two reasons:\n\n1) Repeatedly sending login information over the wire in plaintext.  Now, I\nrealize that I could use SSL, but that would be both expensive and slow the\nsite down.\n\n2) I don&#39;t see a way to &quot;expire&quot; the login information.  But maybe there is\na method that I am just not aware of...\n\n\n\nSo, this brings me to session cookies.  Some time back, I recall reading the\nstatement that &quot;cookies are not RESTful&quot;.  Now, is this all use of cookies\nor just persistant cookies?  Is it okay to use a single session cookie?  I\nwould see this as no different from using http authentication (i.e. the\nclient resending identifying [set of] values over and over again), except\nthat I can occasionally change the cookie&#39;s value to limit replay attacks\nand limit the possibility of stealing the password to only one request\ninstead of every request (assuming basic authentication).\n\n\nThere is one other thing I do like about http authentication:  it doesn&#39;t\n&quot;interfere&quot; with the application process.  In other words, the browser just\nresubmits the last request with additional headers.  To implement html login\nforms and cookies, I have to take on the responsibility of keeping track of\nthe submitted data in the last request.  It also means that the browser\ncaches the login page in it&#39;s history (which does not happen with http\nauthentication).\n\n\nSo, how do you deal with the security issues of http authentication vs. html\nform/cookie authentication when you are running over a unsecure conneciton?\nAnd how do you do this and keep it all RESTful?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
