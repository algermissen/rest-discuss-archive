Mike Dierken said \nregarding using etags and &quot;if-none-match&quot; headers. The scheme is as follows:\n\n1. Allow subscriptions to a resource http://foo.com/bar\n2. When bar changes, publish notifications to all the subscriber containing \nthe link to bar or the diff, etc and an entity tag to be used to identify \nbar at that particular instance of time (i.e. the state of bar when the \nnotification was sent).\n3. If a subscriber is only interested when bar is in that particular state \n(think along the lines of a lock on bar as suggested by Mike) it uses the \netag and an &quot;if-match&quot; header to ensure that a GET is only successful if bar \nis still in the required state (e.g. if bar is not locked).\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable strategy? The reason I ask is that it \nmakes me feel uneasy that the client has to know that the etag is overloaded \nto represent state and whether to use it or not.\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
