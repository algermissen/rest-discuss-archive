A &quot;REST\n&gt; Patterns&quot; site I think would be very helpful to a lot of people as it\n&gt; would give solid examples of how some things could be done, even if\n&gt; does not present the to the metal specifics of how it is done.\n&gt;\n&gt; It can promote the REST architecture and talk at a higher level, it\n&gt; could even leave HTTP completely out of the equation.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is a new way of thinking for many, and having answers to &quot;how do\n&gt; I...&quot; questions, in a central place, with some nice diagrams at a high\n&gt; level, would be very valuable.\n&gt;\n&gt; The goal being not interoperability, per se, rather best practices for\n&gt; REST in the enterprise, regardless of the actual protocols etc. used.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt;\n\nAs a member of a team that is implementing a quasi-REST infrastructure\nover several protocol I couldn&#39;t agree more. More than this, something\nwith the unfortunate name of REST-DeadStar sure looks like a vendor\nlock-in project, and I said &quot;look&quot; as their authors already repeated\nthat it&#39;s not. But sometimes is not enough to &quot;be&quot;, it&#39;s also\nnecessary to &quot;look&quot; like...\n\n"}}
