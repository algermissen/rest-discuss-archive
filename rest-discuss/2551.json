PUT is very good at what\n&gt; it does and it makes little sense to overload POST to mean update.\n&gt; In fact, I&#39;d say using POST to mean UPDATE is a violation of REST\n&gt; because it suggests that there are user-visible, side-effects to\n&gt; simple updates which 99.9% of the time there are not -- this is why\n&gt; PUT is idempotent and POST is not.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further, your suggestion to use POST for limited updates isn&#39;t the\n&gt; optimal solution 90% of the time. Coarse-grained messaging (which I\n&gt; think is one of the fundamentals of REST) has proven to be more\n&gt; scalable and it drastically simplifies the code that both the server\n&gt; and the client must deal with. Further it makes all types of things\n&gt; easier when you&#39;re dealing with whole resources.\n\nSo POST should not be used to update a resource and PUT can only update a\nresource by replacing it, then how do you update only a part of a resource?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
