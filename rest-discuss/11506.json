OAuth was designed to allow access to RESTful \nAPIs (among other things).  You state:\n\n&quot;I have looked at both OAuth &lt;http://oauth.net/&gt; and OpenID \n&lt;http://openid.net/&gt;, but they do not seem to have a good story for \nautomated agents as they focus on having human interaction in a browser \nsession.&quot;\n\nThis is true of OpenID but not of OAuth.  OAuth explicitly separates the \nstep of a user granting authorization (which has a standard in-browser \nflow, and can also be accomplished through out of band means) and the \nuse of that authorization, as embodied in an access token, at some point \nin the future.  So for example, you can take the results of the \nin-browser authorization step and then, potentially, use them in \nserver-to-server calls for the next several months, even if the user \nnever logs in again.\n\nAlan Dean wrote:\n&gt; All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not a security expert, but I have been musing how to federate \n&gt; regular HTTP Digest Auth for a little while for RESTful applications \n&gt; and have posted my thoughts [1].\n&gt;\n&gt; For all I know, this has been thought of before or already debunked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, feedback welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://tinyurl.com/fedauth\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
