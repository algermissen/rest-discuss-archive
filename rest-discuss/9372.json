A response to a request for a resource includes a \nrepresentation and optionally, an entity body.  The representation \nindicates the state of the resource, which may be an error \nresponse:\n\n&quot;Depending on the message control data, a given representation may indicate \nthe current state of the requested resource, the desired state for the \nrequested resource, or the value of some other resource, such as a \nrepresentation of the input data within a client&#39;s query form, or a \nrepresentation of some error condition for a response.&quot;\n\nA 404 response with no entity body is still a representation of the \n(possible nonexistence of the) requested resource.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yet nobody ever specifically states what is un-RESTful about my\n&gt;&gt; implementation or why they think that, they only seem to make\n&gt;&gt; statements about how I *must* be doing something wrong or\n&gt;&gt; quoting RFC 2616 to me even though that isn&#39;t where REST is\n&gt;&gt; defined.\n&gt;\n&gt;I did. Your design breaks uniformity to avoid hypermedia: it\n&gt;overloads the meaning of a response code in order to avoid\n&gt;exposing server state as a separate resource.\n&gt;\n\nI appreciate how you phrased your objection, however, I must still \ndisagree because I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re coming up with the \nrequirement for application state to be part of the (opaque) \nresource identifier.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
