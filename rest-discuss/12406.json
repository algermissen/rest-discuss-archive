The article Subbu provided  \n(http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/10/generalized-linking) is a great \nexample of what is possible with JSON in that regard.\n\nKris Zyp&#39;s efforts on JSON referencing, whilst maybe not as extensible \nas Subbu&#39;s proposal, have been implemented on the client side in the \nDojo toolkit \n(http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/06/17/json-referencing-in-dojo/), and \nthey seem to provide an adequate hypermedia mechanism for &#39;basic&#39; HATEOAS.\n\nThe most significant difference I see between Subbu and Kris&#39; proposals \nare the optional content negotation properties - namely &#39;type&#39; and \n&#39;hreflang&#39; - I absolutely agree with Subbu that these properties are \nimportant for extensbility, but clearly (since they are optional) they \nare not &#39;crucial&#39;.\n\nInterestingly; other hypermedia formats like HTML provide no concrete \nmarkup for content negotation either, although they probably should in \nmy opinion! HTML5 is not adding markup for this at time of writing :(\n\nSubbu - one thing that struck me was that the &#39;title&#39; and &#39;length&#39; \nproperties seem like meta-data that could (should?) be aquired from \nheaders in a HEAD response from the URI being linked to, rather being \nburned into the referencing hyperlink itself.\n\nI&#39;ve come up with another possible alternative for greater \nextensibility, which is to allow an abritrary list of headers for a \nhyperlink, rather than singling out content-type and language.\nFor example:\n\n&quot;link&quot; : {\n    &quot;rel&quot; : &quot;self&quot;,\n    &quot;href&quot; : &quot;http://example.org/movie/11&quot;,\n    &quot;headers&quot; : {\n        &quot;Accept&quot; : &quot;application/json&quot;,\n        &quot;Accept-Language&quot; : &quot;en-gb&quot;,\n        &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot; : &quot;compress, gzip&quot;,\n        &quot;x-custom-header&quot; : &quot;foo&quot;\n    }\n}\n\nThe headers list could be treated as advisory in the sense that a client \ncould chose to ignore/override the headers specified in the link and \nwith an understanding that the server could opt to not respect them at \nall (as per the HTTP RFC).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRegards,\nMike\nhttp://twitter.com/mike__kelly\n\nMichael Schuerig wrote:\n&gt; On Sunday 12 April 2009, Richard Wallace wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; The Sun Cloud APIs are RESTful and use JSON for their resource\n&gt;&gt; represenations\n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://kenai.com/projects/suncloudapis/pages/CloudAPISpecificationRe\n&gt;&gt; sourceModels&gt;. They totally respect HATEOAS and are a great example\n&gt;&gt; from what I&#39;ve seen so far.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; They are RESTful, but about HATEOAS I&#39;m not sure. I may just be \n&gt; betraying my ignorance here as I haven&#39;t even tried to follow the \n&gt; discussion. I formed my (mis-)understanding of HATEOAS mostly from \n&gt; (mis-)reading Richardson & Ruby&#39;s &quot;RESTful Web Services&quot;. There I got \n&gt; the idea that HATEOAS implies something like &quot;affordances for machines&quot;, \n&gt; in other words, a client program (i) doesn&#39;t have to guess which states \n&gt; there are to advance to from the current state and, once it has decided \n&gt; where to go, it (ii) doesn&#39;t have to tinker with bits and pieces of the \n&gt; target address to go there. A client program would be able to discern \n&gt; possible transitions from the resource representation itself, thus \n&gt; becoming more resilient to changes.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Sun Cloud APIs don&#39;t seem to follow this particular interpretation. \n&gt; As far as I can tell, it consists of hierarchically related resources, \n&gt; which are delivered in such a way that lower-level resources are \n&gt; physically contained within higher-level ones. I don&#39;t see how a client \n&gt; program would be able to do anything with this representation without a \n&gt; complete understanding of it. There would have to be built-in knowledge, \n&gt; that Virtual Data Centers have addresses and clusters as sub-resources; \n&gt; and as representations of these sub-resources are simply contained in \n&gt; the representation of the VDC, there is no linking, or hypermedia, \n&gt; involved. This way of modeling breaks for circular relations among \n&gt; resources, or if there are just too many to include or even link them \n&gt; individually.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I might be utterly confused about HATEOAS.\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
