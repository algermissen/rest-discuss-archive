Specifically, I am talking about the ability for a URI\n&gt; authority to indicate in a computer-readable format the composition \nrules of\n&gt; a given URI?  For instance, suppose there was a document that looked\n&gt; something like (loosely based on regex):\n&gt; \n&gt; https?://example.invalid/(isbn)\n&gt; isbn = {regex pattern for ISBNs}\n\nPersonally, I think is an absolutely terrible idea and leads to \ninterfaces just as brittle as an RPC system. The best way to \nimplement this functionality, (at least the way I do it) is to use a \nredirecting query ie\n\nGET /example.com/somepath/?isbn={isbn}&nuflag={nuflag}\n\nThis should return a 302 Redirect who&#39;s location header is then the \nreal URL, http://example.com/somepath/{isbn}/{nuflag}.\n\nUsing redirecting queries is a lot more flexible then &#39;parameterized&#39; \nURLs since it keeps the full URL-resoultion strategy on the server \nwhere it belongs. Also, queries are logical constructs which do not \nchange while URLs  can change at any time (under heavy load, some \nwebservices will migrate resources to another machine). This also \nallows people to throw together quick scripting hacks like Udell&#39;s. \n\n(I would hardly call John&#39;s lookup anything other than a hack. It&#39;ll \nbreak as soon as Amazon changes its URLs, something he has no control \nover).\n\nUnfortunately, I really have to disagree Roy on this. There&#39;s \nabsolutely nothing with human readable resources--in fact they should \nbe encouraged--but URI opaqueness is fundamental and very important \nto building flexible systems. The only thing a client should be doing \nto a URL is applying the basic verbs (GET,PUT,POST,etc) to it. It&#39;s \njust a locator. Machines aren&#39;t as smart as humans. \n\n- Buko O.\n\n\n"}}
