otherwise, the client\napps are to treat the FO=\r\nRM as an entity body template.\n\nAtom solved this problem by dropping suppor=\r\nt for templates completely;\nservers simply have no way (as defined by Atom/=\r\nAtomPub) to inform\nclients at runtime of any state-transfer option details =\r\n(other than\nidentified links such as rel=3D&quot;edit&quot;, etc.). this works fine f=\r\nor\nproblem domains where the options are either non-existent, or the list\no=\r\nf options are simple/stable enough to hard-code all details of each\nand eve=\r\nry possible option (including _when_ these options are valid)\ninto the clie=\r\nnt apps directly.\n\nwhile it&#39;s true that machine-only clients (i.e. no activ=\r\ne human in the\ndriver seat) have additional work to do when supporting temp=\r\nlating, i\nrarely find this &quot;additional work&quot; is wasted energy. i&#39;ve been ab=\r\nle to\nuse HTML.FORMs to very good effect in M2M scenarios several times.\nth=\r\nis works especially well when the _vocabulary_ of the problem domain\nis sta=\r\nble, while the _workflow_ options of the problem domain are\nvariable/custom=\r\nizable. IOW, machines do not need to learn *new\nvariables* over time, but i=\r\nnstead need to learn *new collections* of\nthe same variables (i.e. the numb=\r\ner of FORMs encountered and the list\nof variables in each FORM changes over=\r\n time, but none of these changes\nintroduces *unknown* variables to the mach=\r\nine).\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamun=\r\nd.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jan 4, 2012 at 12:53, Jan Algermissen\n&lt;jan.al=\r\ngermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 4, 2012, at 6:39 PM, Will Hartung w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jan 4, 2012 at 5:51 AM, Jan Algermissen\n&gt;&gt; &lt;jan.algermis=\r\nsen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not refer to generic forms.
