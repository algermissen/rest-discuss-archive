I\n&gt; &gt; think the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HTML5 WG came up with a brilliant solution for a similar\n&gt; &gt; problem, i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that of defining HTML5 as an abstract DOM and then defining\n&gt; &gt; different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; serializations for it.  Similarly I think we might want to consider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focusing on defining a SOM (Service Object Model) and only\n&gt; &gt; later worry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the exact serializations of it. Does that not work\n&gt; &gt; with what you were saying?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Go a step backward into the HTML5 conceptual model:\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Forms should support all HTML verbs.\n&gt; &gt; 2.  Elements for specific content types like audio and video.\n&gt; &gt; 3.  Should be possible to break document into sections.\n&gt; &gt; And so forth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Those are the things we need to decide on first, before we\n&gt; &gt; even get to create an abstract model.\n&gt;\n&gt; So rather than use an analogy, what specific things do you think we need to\n&gt; decide on first related to RESTful web services?\n\nSo far I mapped out the following:\n\n1.  Describe a collection of resources (one or more).\n\n2.  Describe which headers are used with that collection.  I&#39;m\nfollowing HTTP 1.1, so no need to describe the headers themselves, but\nyou may want to know where I&#39;m allowing conditional GET and PUT, for\nexample.\n\n3.  Describe which content types are supported by that collection.\nAnd that should allow you to go all the way into structure and\nsemantics of the various content types.\n\n4.  Describe which status codes are returned and what they mean, for\ncases that are more specific than the HTTP spec.\n\n5.  URL templates for entry points (mapped to #1), optionally separate\nfrom the base path.\n\n6.  URL selection from content types (mapped to #1).\n\n7.  Authentication mechanism.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; We might even have\n&gt; &gt; several abstract models, maybe one is optimized for tooling\n&gt; &gt; and another for people, one for static languages another for\n&gt; &gt; dynamic languages.  Each abstract model can have different\n&gt; &gt; serializations.\n&gt;\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t sound like it is needed. Sure, some use cases might use\n&gt; attributes that others don&#39;t but it seems to me that there really is one a\n&gt; need for one abstract model. Can you give concrete examples that would\n&gt; indicate otherwise?\n\nThat depends on which abstract model happens first.  If it&#39;s the one I\nlike, I&#39;m going to side with you that there&#39;s no clear need to have\nmore than one.  If it&#39;s the one I don&#39;t like, I&#39;m going to have a\nlaundry list of precise features I&#39;m missing to justify a different\none.  And, I do reserve to change my opinion over time, and in the\nwords of the other camp, &quot;see the light&quot; :-)\n\n\n&gt; Alan Dean made a good start with DSD [1] though I think it needs a different\n&gt; discovery model; I proposed [2] using a combination of robots.txt, HTTP\n&gt; headers, and HTML headers. Why don&#39;t we discuss those specifics?\n\nThose deal with discovery, that&#39;s an important problem to solve, but\nunderstand that until I have something to discover, I don&#39;t have a\ndiscovery problem.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://simplewebservices.org/index.php?title=Domain_Service_Discovery\n&gt; [2] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10211\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n-- Assaf\n\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n"}}
