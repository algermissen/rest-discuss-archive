Looks good, as Aristotle says.\n\n&gt;For example, I&#39;m implementing a referral program where the user enters a\n&gt; list of names and addresses into an HTML form and then picks from a list of rewards. After\n&gt; each step, I need to perform server-side validation. Only after the second stage validation\n&gt; occurs can the &quot;transaction&quot; be considered complete and committed. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve\n&gt; considered thus far:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /referrals: gets an empty form in which users enter referral names and emails\n&gt; POST /referrals: submits the referral form data (names and emails) and returns a 201\n&gt; Location: /referrals/{id}, where {id} is the server generated-id for this set of referrals or a 409\n&gt; if the validation failed, displaying the original name/email form with inline error messages\n\n\nIE6 and earlier used to display the returned representation for 4xx\nerrors only if they exceeded a certain length. Otherwise IE6 displayed\na custom error message, ignoring your returned entity. Having trouble\nfinding the right Google search for that behavior. You have to make\nyour returned entity &gt; e.g. 4096 bytes, or something, for it to\ndisplay.\n\nNo idea if it&#39;s an issue in IE7.\n\nI guess  409 is as good as 400.\n\n\n&gt; GET /referrals/{id}: based on the previous post, the server knows that the referral names and\n&gt; addresses have been entered, so the user gets a new form to select a reward (essentially\n&gt; customizing the representation based on the state of the resource)\n&gt; POST /referrals/{id}: submit _only_ the reward data to update the referral resource (e.g.\n&gt; partial PUT without the religious war).\n&gt;\n\nSounds like you consider &#39;referral resource&#39;  to include the chosen\nreward? Nothing wrong with that, just wasn&#39;t clear until now.\n\n\n&gt; Does this sound &quot;correct&quot; or at least reasonable?\n\nYep.\n\n&gt;I would greatly appreciate any alternatives\n&gt; or suggestions.\n&gt;\n\nI get the impression you don&#39;t feel comfortable with this.\n\n\n&gt; Justin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
