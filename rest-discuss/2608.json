One\nthing is that I don&#39;t want to do it in isolation, so if you&#39;re\ninterested in this approach, I say we just start with some\ninformal language.  Unfortunately, the message below is too\nambiguous about the ambiguity in DELETE for me to get my\nteeth in.\n\nWhat do others think about this approach?  I think Mark Baker\nproposed something like this, offering to author some new\nmethods once we had a clear model.  Let&#39;s do it, unless it&#39;s\nalready been done and we&#39;d be duplicating effort.\n\nI can pledge a genuine interest and *some* time, but can&#39;t\ncommit to any schedule, unfortunately.\n\nWalden\n\nPS - shall I publish a simple Alloy model to this list\n\ttommorow to drive a stake into the ground?\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Paul Prescod [mailto:paul@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 18, 2002 4:31 PM\n&gt; To: S.

It&#39;s okay for HTTP to diverge but if the spec doesn&#39;t \n&gt; say clearly \n&gt; one way or another, then people will just guess. HTTP says basically \n&gt; &quot;DELETE means you should delete.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy describes a very mathematical mode for HTTP (resource is \n&gt; a mapping \n&gt; etc.) and if the HTTP methods were described in those terms \n&gt; it would be \n&gt; much easier to build interoperable software.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are hints that it was politics that prevented this from \n&gt; happening \n&gt; the first time around, but what should we do about it now? \n&gt; Just transmit \n&gt; the true meanings of the methods through mailing lists? \n&gt; Increment HTTP? \n&gt; Write an RFC clarifying? Wait for Roy&#39;s new protocol? I&#39;m \n&gt; being serious \n&gt; here: I think that there is a problem and a variety of \n&gt; solutions and am \n&gt; soliciting opinions on both issues.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
