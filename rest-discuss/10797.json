I was saying that the argument that in all those\n&gt; years no one had the time to redefine http through a new rfc to complete\n&gt; what the apparent lack of time in completing 2616 left out was fairly over\n\nWell, it takes *much* more than a single person&#39;s time to update an RFC \nas important as HTTP/1.1.\n\nTrust me, I know, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re currently doing in the \nHTTPbis working group.\n\n&gt; the top, and that considering you should &quot;know&quot; both rfc apply when 2616 is\n&gt; not explicit about that is not the easiest way to push people to evaluate\n&gt; Link: or any other things defined in 2068. And I make the point that an rfc\n&gt; that obsolete another rfc doesn&#39;t complete it but replace it.\n\nIt does replace it, but it doesn&#39;t invalidate what was left out. Think \nof it that what&#39;s in RFC 2068, but not in RFC 2616, didn&#39;t progress \n(yet) on the IETF standards track.\n\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like what I see in Link:. It means I think http\n&gt; should be cleaned and a new spec defined to clean up the previous one. Call\n&gt; it http 1.1 revision 1 or http 1.2, it doesn&#39;t change the fundamental that\n&gt; the current document is ageing.\n\nThat activity started almost two years ago, leading to the IETF forming \nthe HTTPbis working group, which has been active for several months now.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
