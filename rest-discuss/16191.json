Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; WTF?!? Just what exactly is=\r\n it you people expect?\n\nHang on. Who&#39;s &quot;you people&quot;? I think the people inv=\r\nolved in the\n&quot;flame&quot; (one of the lamest ones in know Internet history) is a=\r\n *very*\nsmall crowd that do not include &quot;you people&quot; on this list.\nPerspect=\r\nive, please. :)\n\n&gt; It is not enough for some people to just disagree\n&gt; with=\r\n my answers, they take it further and bitch and moan about how\n&gt; inadequate=\r\n those answers are to their needs.\n\nI don&#39;t actually know what happened, I =\r\ndidn&#39;t pay attention. I think\nwe had a pretty good discussion about the usu=\r\nal semantics in REST and\nwhat to emphasise and whatnot (like forgetting tha=\r\nt REST without\nHATEOAS isn&#39;t LOVEYEAH!), but looking through the emails I *=\r\nsuspect*\nsome language barriers and words going into semantic territory tha=\r\nt\nwere new to them, and they got a bit lost.\n\nAs to regulars, well I&#39;ve bee=\r\nn on this list for quite some time and\nare just as guilty as the next perso=\r\nn in both flames, passionate\nrhetorics and blatant ignorance of some black =\r\nart. However, I have\nbeen more active in periods, and I suspect that applie=\r\ns to all of us;\nWe come in and out of periods of busy or having enough. Som=\r\ne times you\nwill interact with people who you think will have your babies, =\r\nand\nother times you&#39;re interacting with people who&#39;d make poor parents.\nThe=\r\nse things come and go in leaps and bounds. The rough guide is ;\n\n1. Don&#39;t t=\r\nake it personal\n2. Don&#39;t be so cocksure\n3. Patience will put out fires\n\nI t=\r\nhink the people involved failed a bit on all of these, in no\nparticular ord=\r\ner or targets.\n\n&gt; That is what I have such a strong negative reaction to. T=\r\nhat&#39;s what\n&gt; I&#39;m so tired of. That is what will lead me to follow everyone =\r\nelse\n&gt; here who&#39;s simply had enough of that ridiculous attitude towards _fr=\r\nee_\n&gt; help _willingly_ given, and just NOT any more. You don&#39;t have to kiss=\r\n\n&gt; my ass, but if beyond disagreeing, you just don&#39;t like the answers I\n&gt; g=\r\nive for whatever reason, I consider myself well within my rights to\n&gt; tell =\r\nyou to please STFU.\n\nI actually agree with you, although I believe STFU sho=\r\nuld read PDBAD.\nBut some responsibility you have to take yourself for engag=\r\ning\nyourself in that very same open process. If you state the goodness of\nA=\r\n, someone will call out that B is a better answer, and STFU. It&#39;s a\nhuman t=\r\nhing to expect that your free time and patience will be\nappreciated, howeve=\r\nr other people&#39;s opinion render that process void\nand null, justified or no=\r\nt.\n\nIn other words, the ability to ignore the tiniest hint of crap thrown\ny=\r\nour way (or better yet, adressed back in the most polite and humble\nway pos=\r\nsible) can be a healthy undertaking for the value of the list.\nI have to ad=\r\nmit to learning this the hard way (and Eric might know of\nthe NGC4LIB maili=\r\nng-list in which I&#39;ve pissed off a many people over\nthe years). Don&#39;t give =\r\nup, just change strategy. It&#39;s easier for you\nto change strategy than it is=\r\n to teach the Internet how to behave.\n\n&gt; Because I&#39;ve had enough of that cr=\r\nap, and not just when it&#39;s directed\n&gt; my way. What started as a fun thread =\r\nyesterday, turned into a\n&gt; disaster.\n\nThat&#39;s not true; a lot of that stuff =\r\nis really helpful for a lot of\npeople. For every flame between 5 people the=\r\nre&#39;s 500 watching, and you\nsimply don&#39;t know what they take away from it. T=\r\nhis is all about very\nsubtle parts of REST (to a degree), and not a lot of =\r\npeople are\nwilling to engage and pipe up as this is, well, flame-territory.=\r\n\n\nAs with all things, this, too, shall pass.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n--\n=A0Project=\r\n Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n--- http=\r\n://shelter.nu/blog/ ----------------------------------------------\n--------=\r\n---------- http://www.google.com/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n\n"}}
