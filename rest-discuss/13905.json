We are currently using the If-Modified-Since header along with\n304 &quot;Not Modified&quot; response codes to ensure that the device does not\ndownload the file more than is absolutely necessary, but I&#39;d like to\ngo a step further and only provide the changed records to the device\n(this is an XML file FWIW). After combing over the HTTP spec and not\nfinding much on Google I think this might be a valid approach:\n\nClient sends a GET request with an If-Range header that specifies the\nlast download date and a Range header that specifies the same. The\nserver could then send back a response of 304 &quot;Not Modified&quot;, 206\n&quot;Partial Resource&quot; along with the deltas as the body or a 200 with all\nof the records as the body.\n\nSample Request Headers:\nIf-Range: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:49:37 GMT\nRange: lastmod=Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:49:37 GMT\n\nIs this approach correct? The HTTP spec suggests that I may define my\nown custom units for the Range header but they may not be portable[0]\nis there a standard already in place that I&#39;m missing?\n\n-mike\n\n[0] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.12\n\n-- \n________________________________\nMichael E.
