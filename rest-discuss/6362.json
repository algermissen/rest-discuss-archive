Please first note, if I talk about client I do not mean\nbrowser, but instead another application calling the REST interface by http.\n\nTo make the discussion not too abstract a small example. Consider a server\nproviding some kind of document repository. Each user can download documents\n(GET) or upload new documents (POST). To download a document it is necessary\nto check if the user has permissions to the document. Getting a document\nshould look like this:\n\nHTTP GET to http://../document/123\n\nNow, from what I have read cookies should be no option and I agree on that.\nAnother idea is that there is a special login interface, which returns a\nTOKEN for further requests. In such a case the above request would change to\nsomething like:\n\nHTTP GET to http://../document/123/TOKEN\n\nThe disadvantage is that now the URL can not be bookmarked or exchanged\namong users anymore, because the TOKEN will be invalid for another user.\n\nAnother often cited method is to use HTTP auth (basic or digest). But this\nis no option, if access rights are not handled by the application server but\ninside the application.\n\nSo the perfect solution would be that the client sends each time\nusername/password along with the http request, but without adding this to\nthe URL. Can this be done, let&#39;s say can I just add some individual HTTP\nheaders or is there a better way to do it?\n\n\nSebastian\n\n\n\n\n"}}
