Of course, now that I think about\nthis some more, this would require some form of processing of the request to\ndetermine how to update the resource... which sounds like POST processing.\nI know differences between SET and PUT have been discussed, but what about\nthe differences between SET and POST?  The only thing I can think of is that\nSET allows the direct creation of a resource at a given URI, while POST does\nnot.\n\nAnd I suppose that SET could always be implemented via PUT by providing\nsufficiently fine grained URIs to the sub-resource(s).  Okay... so maybe\nthere isn&#39;t a need for a SET after all.  Within SOAP and similar RPC specs,\nuse of a SET would make more sense since you would not have all of the URIs.\n\nOr do I just have SET all wrong?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jeffrey Winter&quot; &lt;j.winter@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Duncan Wilcox&quot; &lt;duncan@...&gt;; &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, December 16, 2002 10:42 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] PUT vs. POST (vs. SET?)\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SET is PUT plus a hook to a processing model.

My\n&gt; understanding was that &quot;SET&quot; would be a way of storing or updating\n&gt; a resource in a way that is not as document-centric as PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt; This would be useful even in a pure XML/HTTP context and not just\n&gt; with SOAP.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
