Though the section you quote\nmentions RPC mechanisms, it doesn&#39;t mention either self-descriptive\nmessaging (SDM) or hypermedia. So how could it possibly reflect anything\nabout the relative importance of the two in terms of differentiating from\nRPC?\n\nWhat is reflected in the quote is that &quot;generic interfaces with standard\nsemantics&quot; is the most fundamental aspect in terms of differentiating from\nRPC. I would agree that of all the principles the Roy highlights in his\ndescription of REST, the principle of generality/uniformity is the most\nimportant one. Roy&#39;s thesis says so quite explicitly: &quot;The *central feature\nthat distinguishes* the REST architectural style from other\nnetwork-based styles [including presumably RPC --nlg] is its emphasis\non a *uniform\ninterface* between components. By applying the software engineering *principle\nof generality* to the component interface, the overall system architecture\nis simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved.&quot; And I&#39;ve\nhighlighted the fundamental importance of interface generality/uniformity\nin other venues.[1][2]\n\nHowever, Roy says that four constraints are required for uniform interfaces\n(aka generic interfaces): &quot;In order to obtain a *uniform interface*,\nmultiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of\ncomponents. REST is defined by *four interface constraints*: identification\nof resources; manipulation of resources through representations;\nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application\nstate.&quot; So again, I don&#39;t see how the section you quote reflects the\nrelative importance of *any *of the four interface constraints, much less\nthe relative importance of just the SDM and hypermedia constraints.\n\n[1] http://bit.ly/QXM1X4\n[2] http://j.mp/uXzVcB\n\n-- Nick\n\r\n--e89a8f2343a51539fb04c67cf94a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat, Aug 4, 2012 at 6:13 AM, Mike Kelly &lt;span=\r\n dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekelly321@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot;&gt;mikekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmai=\r\nl_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left=\r\n:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;g=\r\nmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;On Sat, Aug 4, 2012 at 12:56 AM, Nick Gall &lt;s=\r\npan dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nick.gall@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot;&gt;nick.gall@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;h=\r\n5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left=\r\n:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gm=\r\nail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Fri, Aug 3, 2012 at 6:08 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;span dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekelly321@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mi=\r\nkekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_q=\r\nuote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;div bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 3 Aug 2012, at 19:35, Nick Gall &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:nick.gall@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nick.gall@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;I&=\r\n#39;ve never heard that one style of dispatching is more &quot;RESTful&quot=\r\n; than another.
