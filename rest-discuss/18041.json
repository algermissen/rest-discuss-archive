(I think I believe the assertion, but an example\nwould =\r\nhelp me, too). Why isn&#39;t it idempotent?\n\nIf a partial update is *not* idemp=\r\notent, then there&#39;s something here,\nbecause an intermediary cannot automati=\r\ncally retry such a partial update.\nThe Apache HttpClient (which, while not =\r\ntechnically an intermediary, is\nnonetheless application-agnostic HTTP plumb=\r\ning) can be configured to\nautomatically retry idempotent requests on networ=\r\nk errors, and this\ncurrently includes PUTs, by definition of RFC2616. So th=\r\nere *are*\nimplementations that depend on these semantics, and I doubt HttpC=\r\nlient is\nthe only one. I wonder what Squid, Varnish, or Apache with mod_pro=\r\nxy do\nwith failed PUTs, if anything.\n\nIn short, if partial updates are not =\r\nidempotent, you can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t use\nPUT to do them, because the RFC explici=\r\ntly defines PUT to be an idempotent\noperation, and you will be breaking any=\r\n RFC2616-compliant current/future\nimplementations that rely on this fact, a=\r\nnd I&#39;ve just documented there&#39;s\nat least one such implementation.\n\nSo can s=\r\nomeone explain why partial updates aren&#39;t idempotent with an\nexample? I.e. =\r\nShow such a partial update that results in different things\nwhen applied on=\r\nce vs. twice. Or, perhaps more pertinently, why the type of\npartial update =\r\nRails wants to do with PUT is not idempotent (I can think\nof a few differen=\r\nt meanings for &quot;partial update&quot;).\n\nJon\n........\nJon Moore\nComcast Interacti=\r\nve Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:  Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt;\nDate:  Fri, 16 Dec 20=\r\n11 13:38:19 +0000\nTo:  &quot;Eric J.
