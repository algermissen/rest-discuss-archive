So far I\nhave looked into using =\r\nASP.NET pages\n(http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RestAspNetExample and\nh=\r\nttp://www.prescod.net/rest/dotnet/) and URL rewritting\n(http://www.codeproj=\r\nect.com/aspnet/URLRewriter.asp) or taking over the\nentire system using an H=\r\nTTP handler or module.  I&#39;m really unsure as\nto what direction to take.  Do=\r\nes anyone have any suggestions or want\nto tell me that using IIS and/or .NE=\r\nT for REST doesn&#39;t make sense?\n\nI like the idea of using GET, POST, PUT, an=\r\nd DELETE because the action\nbeing performed is obvious.  One article I foun=\r\nd (on this very list)\nsuggests using GET and POST makes more sense for untr=\r\nusted (browser)\nclients.  If this is the case, then how does one define in =\r\na POST that\nit is actually a DELETE or PUT?  I&#39;m also curious to know if an=\r\ny\nXMLHttpRequest implementations even support PUT and DELETE.\n    \nIf you h=\r\naven&#39;t already guessed, I&#39;m not very well versed in the HTTP\nrealm.  Are th=\r\nere any good HTTP resources out there for someone like me?\n\nThanks to all w=\r\nho respond,\n\nStuart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
