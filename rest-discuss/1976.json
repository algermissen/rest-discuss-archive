The puchase order, payments,\n&gt; etc, are messages that change the state of the trade.\n\nYes!  \n\n&gt; The trade can also contain at any one time, information that \ndescribes\n&gt; how to make a valid state change from the current state. In other\n&gt; words, it can contain information that allows the customer to\n&gt; acknowledge receipt of the item, or for the supplier to send the \nbill,\n&gt; or for either to cancel the trade.\n\nYes!\n\n&gt; The question that this raises in my mind is that if the &quot;trade&quot; is\n&gt; addressed through a single URI, how is the view of each party, the\n&gt; supplier or the purchaser, restricted to the state changes that they\n&gt; can make.\n\nThe &quot;trade&quot; will be one URI, but there will be several sub-resources \nhyperlinked to it for the order, each line item, each shipment, each \npayment, etc. and possibly each conversation or transaction about \neach of those resources.\n\nThe view of each party depends on the configuration:\n* if centralized, either in a marketplace or in the extranet of the \ndominant trading partner, there will be one set of resources.\n* if P2P, each trading partner will maintain their own set of \nresources.  It&#39;s like a HOPP or Half-Object Plus Protocol pattern, \nwhere each corresponding resource is a half-object and the business \ntransaction protocol keeps their states aligned.\n\nWe&#39;ve already discussed on this list several times different ways to \nimplement state alignment transactions in REST.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
