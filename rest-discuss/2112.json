I know the verb PUT should be used with with the 201\n&gt; Created code but what should the target of the verb be?\n\nFor what you&#39;re doing, POST is correct. PUT would return the &quot;/new&quot;\nLocation. PUT is like writing to a file (whether creating or\noverwriting). POST is like asking the server to create a new file with a\nparticular content.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; 1) What is the best way to indicate error to the client when the\n&gt; client sends malformed XML to the server? I&#39;m not sure whether 407\n&gt; Not Acceptable, 409 Conflict, or 400 Bad Request is best. Currently I\n&gt; use 400 but the rfc says this error code should be avoided and the\n&gt; server should aim to be as specific as possible.\n\nYou mean 406 Not Acceptable.\n\nI think that 406 is intended for declaring an inability to generate an\nacceptable *response* entity, not for rejecting the request entity.\n\nI think that 409 is similarly unsuitable because the problem has nothing\nto do with a clash between current state and intended state.\n\nSo I think 400 is best: &quot;The request could not be understood by the\nserver due to malformed syntax.&quot;\n\n&gt; 2) Does it make sense to have a dummy &#39;new&#39; resource that is the\n&gt; target of resource creation request? You could ask what the result of\n&gt; GET /app/rest/container/new is and I&#39;m not sure since it rarely makes\n&gt; sense. This leads me to believe resource creation should be done by a\n&gt; POST to the container where POST means &#39;Append&#39;. The rfc is not\n&gt; completely clear on the difference in this unique case--it seems to\n&gt; indicate either PUT or POST works.\n\nI think POST is right. \n\n&gt; 3) When the client is generating entities who is responsible for\n&gt; generating etags? The server is usually responsible because the\n&gt; server usually generated the resource, but when the client does\n&gt; resource generation should it have the burden of generating etags\n&gt; too? Should clients be trusted to generate etags?\n\nThe client can&#39;t really do resource generation in REST. The client can\nhand a representation to the server and say &quot;make this a resource\nplease&quot; but that&#39;s different. So in the end the server has\nresponsibility for generating etags whether it created the resource from\nscratch or from a supplied representation.\n-- \n&quot;When I walk on the floor for the final execution, I&#39;ll wear a denim \nsuit. I&#39;ll walk in there like Willie Nelson, John Wayne, Will Smith \n-- Men in Black -- James Brown. Maybe do a Michael Jackson moonwalk.&quot;\nCongressman James Traficant.\n\n"}}
