So, if I want the \nservice&#39;s response in XML for programmatic access, I would specify \nACCEPT: text/xml.  Or, if I want the UI for user access, I would \nspecify text/html.  To get the schema, I could specify \napplication/xsd+xml.  To get the interface def, I could specify \napplication/kinda-like-wsdl-for-rest+xml.  Sure, some necessary MIME \ntypes don&#39;t exist, but isn&#39;t that a fault of MIME and not HTTP?  \nAfter all, if XML can get its own MIME type even though its really \njust text, why stop there?\n\nOkay, so we&#39;d end up with billions of MIME types for everyone&#39;s \ndifferent schemas.  But since XSD is so core, it really should have \nits own MIME type.  Perhaps one more new MIME type is needed: \napplication/metadata+xml, which when requested would return an index \nof all various metadata of the service, such as scaler values like \nauthor and version, and links (different URLs) to complex metadata, \nsuch as reviews of the service.  Of course, these different URLs \ncould themselves be services, which can be accessed programatically \n(via ACCEPT: text/xml) or by a user (via ACCEPT: text/html).  The \nreviews could even have reviews.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Roger L. Costello&quot; \n&lt;costello@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Alex,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;S.

If Gene Siskel gives it \na\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think we are mixing two very separate concepts\n&gt; &gt; of metadata.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that you are missing my point.  Let me quote David Jacobs:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Metadata about a web service goes beyond a WSDL file, XML Schemas \nand a\n&gt; tmodel description.\n&gt; \n&gt; A web service may have\n&gt; * a WSDL file\n&gt; * an HTML description\n&gt; * XML schema&#39;s it returns and accepts\n&gt; * a DAML-S description\n&gt; * a reliability rating\n&gt; * a usefulness rating\n&gt; * how it can be integrated with other services\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, while a service provider will often produce a lot of \n&gt; service metadata to facilitate its use, they cannot be seen as\n&gt; objective \n&gt; parties when contributing metadata to be used in matchmaking (i.e., \nis \n&gt; this the service I need).  Clearly there is a role for third \nparties to\n&gt; add their own metadata about a service in the form of ratings and \nnew \n&gt; metadata formats which might increase the service&#39;s usefulness for \na \n&gt; population segment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; My point is that a HOW metadata document is just a small part of the\n&gt; metadata that you will associate with web service.  Further, even \nof the\n&gt; HOW metadata there will be many, many different formats - XHTML, \nWSDL,\n&gt; RDF, DAML-S, OWL, etc.  To top it off, all of the many metadata\n&gt; documents will be distributed across the Web [just like all of the \nWeb\n&gt; sites that link to your Web page are distributed across the Web].\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottom line: for a Web service there will be many (many) metadata\n&gt; documents, spread across the Web.  The key is to provide a &quot;general\n&gt; mechanism&quot; for associating a metadata document with a web service. \n&gt; That&#39;s what Meta-Location buys you.  /Roger\n\n\n\n"}}
