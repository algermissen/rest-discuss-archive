The links you provided and the Linked Data Patterns book [1] are good steps in this direction (as hopefully so so too the Linked Data book [2]).\n\nWhile it can be exciting to think about starting over, the reality is\nthat the Web is deployed and working at scales that would&#39;ve been hard\nto imagine in the early days of the WWW. The work done on REST to\ndescribe the set of constraints that have allowed this growth to occur\ncount as doing things &quot;right&quot; in my book.\n\nThat isn&#39;t to say REST is finished, or that the RDF data model doesn&#39;t\nhave something to offer. But it would be nice to see more conscious\nalignment with REST from the Linked Data crowd, in particular around\nthe issue of what URLs identify, and (for me) unhelpful terminology\nlike Document and Information Resource.\n\n//Ed\n\n"}}
