The question you have to answer is \nwhy did you convert a protocol deals with CRUDE (don&#39;t forget the E - we \ncan do Execute-like operations too) operations on resources in an \nintuitive manner to one that doesn&#39;t?\n\nYou can hardly claim that when given the choice of GET, PUT, POST and \nDELETE that GET was the intuitive choice for deleting something. That&#39;s \nhighly counter-intuitive, as I said if I was dropped into that project \nas a developer I&#39;d be confused as can be until I decided to just drop \nevery thing I knew and assumed you weren&#39;t using the protocol I&#39;m \nfamiliar with at all.\n\nFor someone who isn&#39;t familiar with the details of HTTP, they are still \nused to the web and to HTTP in practice. GETting a representation of a \nURI and then performing other GETs on the basis of that with occasional \nPOSTs (PUTs and DELETEs in rarer case) is what every five year old is \nnow used to. If my 5 and 7 year old can find their way around the web \n(and my 3 year olds are beginning to get the basic idea), it must pass a \ncertain level of intuitiveness.\n\n&gt; PS Another benefit that comes into mind, is the bookmarking feature.\n&gt; In case a POST is used to one and only one URL than this is not possible \n&gt; and this is with the REST-style cleaner\n&gt; and possible.\n\nBookmarking is a concrete example of the general point of \ninteroperability and of extensibility. Simply put if I give you a URI \nyou can run GET on it and get a representation that lets you then go on \nto do many other things - that&#39;s a lot of power in one little string.\n\nBookmarking is an example of that, and a very powerful one in practice.\n\n\n"}}
