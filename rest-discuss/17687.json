The obvious and cleanest approach seem=\r\ns to be to accept absolute URIs to the other resources as exposed by the AP=\r\nI. The only disadvantage I can see is that it&#39;s more verbose than accepting=\r\n ids to the referenced resources, but this is partially offset by avoiding =\r\nthe need to return raw ids in representations in the first place. Does this=\r\n seem a reasonable approach? I&#39;m only wondering as it doesn&#39;t seem that com=\r\nmon.\n\nApologies if this has been asked before, it likely has, but the combi=\r\nnation of URI and input as search terms defeated the usefulness of this lis=\r\nts search functionality.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJim\n\n\n"}}
