Internal APIs tend to  \n&gt; be more\n&gt; fine-grained and have a richer feature set than their external\n&gt; counterparts.  Those fine-grained APIs are more prone to change over  \n&gt; time.\n&gt; HATEOAS is meant help manage those kinds of changes .\n&gt;\n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Apr 14, 2009 at 12:38 PM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Apr 14, 2009, at 9:03 AM, Michael Schuerig wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; generalized linking[*] and there my reaction is the same: So what?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; All I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see are proposals for expressing links among resources.

There are very few external facing and  \n&gt;&gt; successful\n&gt;&gt; services that illustrate things like this. For internal apps, IMO,\n&gt;&gt; there is less motivation to treat URIs as opaque as it is tempting to\n&gt;&gt; assume that clients know about URIs as well as all possible state\n&gt;&gt; transitions. Under such assumptions, HATEOAS may seem like an\n&gt;&gt; unnecessary pedantic exercise.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IMO, it is best to evaluate pros and costs of HATEOAS, or for that\n&gt;&gt; matter, any other idea, in the context of your own apps. If you are\n&gt;&gt; convinced that HATEOAS is beneficial for your apps, then the  \n&gt;&gt; proposals\n&gt;&gt; that have been discussed so far can help.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lack of an IETF RFC or a W3C recommendation should not, IMHO, prevent\n&gt;&gt; anyone from doing the right things for their apps.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; http://subbu.org\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
