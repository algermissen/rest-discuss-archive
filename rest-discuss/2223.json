As opposed to extending the\n&gt; defined set of\n&gt; methods for the sake of greater method specificity?\n\nExtending the methods means being able to reuse the semantics of the\nexisting contract between client and server; aka firewall safe.  If I\nPOST some data to /foo with an intent of /bar, I&#39;m still doing a POST,\nand it&#39;s still the server that has the ultimate say (because it&#39;s still\na POST).  This is in contrast to invoking the BAR method, which could\nmean anything.\n\n&gt;  As opposed to adding\n&gt; &#39;control&#39; data\n&gt; (mentioned in the thesis, but not in association with HTTP) to qualify\n&gt; methods?\n\nAFAIK, &quot;control data&quot; refers to fringe &quot;management&quot; aspects of the\nconnection; caching, varyability, connection stuff, mux, ordering,\netc..  It doesn&#39;t change or extend the methods.\n\n&gt;  As\n&gt; opposed to any other meta-method for working around generic method\n&gt; limitations?\n\nNot sure what other approaches there might be.  PEP had the &quot;PEP&quot;\nmethod, which was sort of a wildcard so that you could URI-identify\nan extension method.  Think of it as a layer 6 construct, so that the\nURI could identify the layer 7 extension.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
