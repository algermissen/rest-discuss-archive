I&#39;ll try to \nexplain why.\n\nI&#39;m sticking to the original topic of WMS GetMap requests.\n\nA GetMap request requires minX, minY, maxX and maxY values (real \nnumbers) to define the geographic extent of the map image, plus the X \nand Y size of the map image in pixels (integers). Roughly speaking, \nthese values determine the view scale of the map image.\n\nIf the view scale is small (think of a map of Australia), delivered in a \n500 x 350 pixel image, it doesn&#39;t matter if you ask for that map using:\n\n    minX = 110 (decimal degrees)\n    minY = -45\n    maxX = 160\n    maxY = -10\n\nor (exaggerating the issue)\n\n    minX = 110.0000001\n    minY = -44.95999999999\n    maxX = 160.0000000001\n    maxY = -9.9999999999\n\nyou will probably get the same map representation (when the two images \nare compared pixel by pixel). Therefore, if you put the X/Y coordinate \nvalues in the URI path there are numerous URIs that identify the same \nresource, which is perfectly legal. (Obviously, there are just as many \npossible URIs when using query parameters.)\n\nAs a matter of style, putting the X/Y coordinate values in the query \nparameters seems to make more sense to me. It could be all put in a URI \npath but sometimes it is useful to see the parameter names and values \n(and order doesn&#39;t matter).\n\nI tend to think of URI paths as being composed of discrete values. \nHabit, I guess.\n\n-- \nRegards\nAndrew Hallam\n\nDigital Earth Pty Ltd\nhttp://www.digitalearth.com.au\n\n"}}
