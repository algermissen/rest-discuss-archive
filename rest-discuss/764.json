It is very difficult for the client \nto get the various services to have a common view of a &quot;transaction&quot; \nso that a failure on any service causes a complete rollback on all of \nthem. HTTP does not have a magical solution to this problem but \nneither do specifications such as SOAP or ebXML. The solutions \nproposed by the OASIS Business Transactions working group are \ncurrently protocol agnostic and should work fine with HTTP.&quot;\n\nebXML does have a business transaction protocol.\n\nIt is the same as the RosettaNet PIP protocol, and has also been used \npreviously in telecommunications.\n\nThe documents describing it are way too complicated for their own \ngood, but the protocol is fairly simple.  It is a two-party set of \nstereotyped messages with timeouts that either succeed completely or \nfail completely.  The goal is business state alignment instead of \ndatabase transactions.  An example of business state alignment:  the \nPurchase Order was either accepted or rejected or the transaction \nfailed due to a timeout.\n\nThe OASIS Business Transaction group dismisses the ebXML/RosettaNet \ntransaction protocol as too simplistic (last I saw).  They provide \nfor multi-party transactions, which ebXML/RosettaNet do not.  On the \nother hand, we in ebXML have not found any multi-party business \nprocess so far that could not be broken down into orchestrated sets \nof two-party commitments and thus two-party transactions.\n\nebXML business transactions are described in:\nhttp://homepage.interaccess.com/~linkage/COOL.ppt \nhttp://www.ebxml.org/specs/ebBPSS.pdf\nhttp://www.ebtwg.org/projects/documentation/bioreference/pdf/Chapter9_\nPatterns.pdf\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
