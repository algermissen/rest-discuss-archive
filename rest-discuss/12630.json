My answer will be governed by the following assumptions.\n1&gt; Initially when the ~100 candidate state transitions were presented to the\nclient, it was the server that defined this set of state transitions to the\nclient.\n\n2&gt; That the model you propose is indeed the only way to present this\nproblem, in that only the server can host or execute the logic needed to\ndetermine the allowed state transitions given the chosen award.\n\nProvided 2 is true and 1&gt; holds, a record of that set could be store on the\nserver prior to sending it to the client, and a unique identifier (URI) that\nrepresents this set could be created on the server.  The end effect is that\nfor this particular client&#39;s request there will exist a resource (URI) on\nthe server that keeps track of the entire list of candidates in the set sent\nto the client.\n\nThat collection URI will be included in the request.\n\nWhen the client attempts to filter (grabs the award in your example), the\nclient could simply send the award URI, and the candidate state transition\ncollection URI to the server.  The server can then process this request by\nreferring to the collection store on the server side for this client.\n\nI believe that this would represent a ReSTful solution that would over come\nthe GET request size/length limitations.\n\nAnother approach would be to make the selection criteria (logic) to be sent\nalong with the data. This would mean that the assumption I made in 2&gt; is no\nlonger valid.  JavaScript would be a particularly good choice for this,\nsince it can be run on the browser and on the server.  At my company, we use\nJavaScript in this fashion to execute web services (syntactic and semantic\nresource validation as well as business logic) for resources both on the\nserver side and on the client.  We have created a restful open source\nframework called Hannibal\nhttp://code.google.com/p/hannibalcodegenerator/\n&lt;http://code.google.com/p/hannibalcodegenerator/&gt;to\nmake this easier.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nBediako\n\nOn Mon, May 18, 2009 at 12:42 PM, Michael Schuerig &lt;michael@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Monday 18 May 2009, Bob Haugen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, May 18, 2009 at 9:50 AM, Michael Schuerig\n&gt; &lt;michael@... &lt;michael%40schuerig.de&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t load the relevant data initially as it is bound to change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; over time.
