Here are some alternatives I whipped up for removing an\n&gt; item, including a variation on Vincent&#39;s suggestion.\n\nNice work.  Here&#39;s an example of my suggestion:\n\nC: GET /customers/lists/42\nS: 200 OK\n    /customers/2\n    /customers/3\n    /customers/5\n    /customers/7\n    /customers/9\n\nTo delete the item referring to /customers/9:\n\nC: DELETE /customers/lists/42/5\nS: 200 OK\n\nI see each entry in the collection as a seperate resource,\nwith its own URI.  For URIs, I am using the ordinal position\nof the item in the list as a hierarchical key to be resolved\nrelative to the collection URI.  (A caveat applies though,\nsee below.)  So,\n\nThe /customers/2 entry is /customers/lists/42/1\nThe /customers/9 entry is /customers/lists/42/5\n\nRationale:\nPerhaps it is helpful to distinguish between /customers/9\nand an entry in the list /customers/lists/42 that refers to\nit, i.e. /customers/lists/42/5.  You are DELETEing the entry\nin the list, not the actual customer.\n\nCaveat:\nYou would need to ensure that POSTs and DELETEs to the list\nresource don&#39;t invalidate existing keys.  But now I&#39;m veering\noff-topic (and out of my depth) to linked versus sequential\nallocation, which I believe is covered Knuth&#39;s TAOCP chapter 2.\n\n\n"}}
