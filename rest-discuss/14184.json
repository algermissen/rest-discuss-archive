Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I disagree. If I w=\r\nere designing a REST system to deal with leasing\n&gt;&gt; contracts, the first th=\r\ning I would do is research whether or not there\n&gt;&gt; exists a standard for re=\r\npresenting leasing contracts. Upon finding\n&gt;&gt; none, my options as a REST de=\r\nveloper are to re-use an existing media\n&gt;&gt; type by extending it to handle t=\r\nhe specifics of a lease-contract\n&gt;&gt; representation, or create a new media t=\r\nype.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I do create a new media type, I wouldn&#39;t call the result REST=\r\nful\n&gt;&gt; unless and until that media type is standardized. I would simply use=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; XHTML as the media type. If the client number is important\n&gt;&gt; informati=\r\non, then I would identify it as such using RDFa or a\n&gt;&gt; microformat approac=\r\nh, i.e. assign @id=3D&#39;client_number&#39; thereby giving\n&gt;&gt; clients the ability =\r\nto glean a client number from any XHTML\n&gt;&gt; representation of a lease contra=\r\nct.\n&gt;\n&gt; If everything is XHTML, how do you know what kind of representation=\r\n\n&gt; that the service wants? Sure, XHTML.\n&gt;\n&gt; So &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;This is my Leas=\r\ne for the White Van. It&#39;s 4\n&gt; weeks.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;, is that a valid Lease =\r\nfor your system?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Clients that aren&#39;t interested in\n&gt;&gt; the client numbe=\r\nr will gracefully degrade, displaying a human-readable\n&gt;&gt; document.\n&gt;\n&gt; cur=\r\nl or Firefox may degrade gracefully, that python script someone\n&gt; wrote wil=\r\nl go &quot;Uh, what&#39;s this&quot; and likely abort. No degradation there\n&gt; at all.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Whereas, if I create a new media type, I&#39;d be reinventing a whole bunch\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; of different wheels -- headings, paragraphs, boldface, italics, links,\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n link relations, HTTP methods and the whole #!. Clients that don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; under=\r\nstand this new markup language will ignore the markup they don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; recogni=\r\nze and display the representation as a big puddle of text.\n&gt;\n&gt; My point is =\r\nthat XHTML simply isn&#39;t specific enough and doesn&#39;t offer\n&gt; enough clarity =\r\nto a client as to what it is seeing and what to expect.\n&gt; You could make a =\r\n&quot;smart&quot; client that goes crawling through payload\n&gt; looking for its markers=\r\n and microformats. That&#39;s fine, but when you\n&gt; say your client accepts &quot;XHT=\r\nML&quot;, it&#39;s a bit misleading, because it\n&gt; wants XHTML that&#39;s properly format=\r\nted, with proper embed extension\n&gt; vocabularies or microformats. Otherwise,=\r\n it&#39;s just gibberish to the\n&gt; client.\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re still defining your own fo=\r\nrmats, payloads, and semantics, but\n&gt; now it just has a catch all media typ=\r\ne of XHTML, oh, and it renders in\n&gt; a browser. Just because it&#39;s in XHTML d=\r\noesn&#39;t make it any more\n&gt; interoperable. I can&#39;t write a shopping client th=\r\nat &quot;just works&quot; with\n&gt; Amazon and Best Buy, and they both use HTML.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My=\r\n rule of thumb remains: Don&#39;t create a new media type, when the\n&gt;&gt; technolo=\r\ngy exists to extend any number of existing media types to solve\n&gt;&gt; the prob=\r\nlem. Creating media types is hard, hard work -- if done\n&gt;&gt; properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; If=\r\n you&#39;re extending a data type and not changing the semantics, then\n&gt; that&#39;s=\r\n a fine idea. If you are changing the semantics, then telling\n&gt; folks it&#39;s =\r\na application/xyz+xml when that&#39;s half truth, or perhaps\n&gt; even wrong (depe=\r\nnding on the kind extension) doesn&#39;t really help\n&gt; anyone, does it? Publish=\r\ning atom feeds where the bulk of your\n&gt; information is in your own namespac=\r\ne, is that really helpful? Is that\n&gt; really using &quot;atom&quot; then? Maybe if you=\r\n&#39;re leveraging some other atom\n&gt; tool suite to publish the atom and your ex=\r\ntensions, then ok. But then\n&gt; you&#39;re using atom as a wrapper to the real me=\r\nat, which is your actual\n&gt; data -- which isn&#39;t atom at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
