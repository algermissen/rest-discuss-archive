The \nquestion is, is this putting state on a connection or not.\n\nI think not. If we consider this to be the current state of the resource \nfrom which we access the post handler (i.e. the resource whose \nrepresenation contains a &lt;form&gt; in the case of an HTML rep) and that \nthis state changes upon a successful POST to the post-handler, then this \nis perfectly restful.\n\nIf the same resource presents us the form (on GET) and handles it (on \nPOST) then we&#39;ve the advantage of the invalidation rules coming into \nplay, though I&#39;d prefer not to depend upon them too much (since they are \nlittle talked about I&#39;d be concerned that there are more things out \nthere not handling them correctly than with other caching mechanisms).\n\n&gt; Instead Unique IDs can be generated by the client using GUIDs.\n\nI prefer to avoid having the client tell me anything other than what it \nis the client&#39;s job to tell me (i.e. what &quot;real&quot; data should be in the \nform).\n\n&gt; Paul Prescod has some interesting things to say on the subject of\n&gt; reliable http http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; A way to be absolutely sure that the GET response comes from the\n&gt;&gt; origin server would solve that problem.\n\nHow &quot;absolute&quot; do you need? If we need to be *absolutely* sure we need \nto essentially consider this a man-in-the-middle attack by the cache and \ntake necessary precautions. HTTPS will manage this unless it&#39;s a trusted \nclient-side cache that is mistrusting.\n\nI think it&#39;s more reasonable to assume the cache is at least vaguely \ncorrect in its handling. We have mechanisms for both client and server \nto insist upon an entity not being cached.\n\n\n"}}
