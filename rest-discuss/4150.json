However,\n&gt; munging the existing URIs on the client is undesirable. Also, any\n&gt; relative URIs inside the representations of those various\n&gt; resources may be thrown off; the server would have to introspect\n&gt; the representations it&#39;s returning and munge any URIs therein\n&gt; itself, and the client would have to be disciplined about only\n&gt; following URIs returned from the server (or built according to\n&gt; rules returned from the server, as for an HTML form submission),\n&gt; and emphatically not constructing URIs itself -- but then that&#39;s\n&gt; just good REST sense, anyway.\n\nI would never munge the request URI -- that just won&#39;t work in the\nlong term, once you consider the effect of proxies and multi-site\ntransactions.  And if you superset the URI space, then questions\ncome up about whether the new space has been checked-out, locked,\nand/or has the same access control and handlers.  Yikes.\n\nThis topic has come up a few times on webdav and http-wg lists.\nThe transaction is a resource, but the relationship between it and\nthe requested resource can be accomplished via a header field that\ndefines each request as a sequenced resource within a hierarchical\ntransaction.  In other words, ask the server for a transaction begin,\nsend the URI it gives the client in each request as a header field\nwith a request number appended to it, and finally abort or commit\nthe transaction as a final request to the transaction&#39;s URI.  That&#39;s\nbasically how I did it for the still-vapor waka protocol.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n\n"}}
