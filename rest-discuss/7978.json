In my prior life at M$, we did a lot of re=\r\nsearch on\napplying it to writing applications.  While that experience forme=\r\nd the\ndesign of how our REST framework (MindTouch Dream) pipes requests\nthr=\r\nough the system, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s very pi-ish.  Pi&#39;s ultra-focus on\ndiscret=\r\ne events made it a pain working with sequences of messages and\nopen-ended s=\r\ntreams of information.  Unfortunately, these are more\noften the norm than t=\r\nhe exception.\n\nIf you&#39;re familiar with pi, you might enjoy reading about Cu=\r\nes in\nDream.  They are akin to ports with sessions.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n- Steve\n\n---=\r\n-----------\nSteve G.
