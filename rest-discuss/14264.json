The service cannot insert =\r\nextra hops with human readable\n&gt;&gt; documentation to direct the cliet to a pl=\r\nace where it finally finds\n&gt;&gt; the &quot;buy&quot; relation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lets compare this to =\r\nthe human interaction: Amazon decides to remove  \n&gt; the &quot;buy&quot; link on an it=\r\nem. Why on earth would they do that? People  \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to shop an=\r\nymore because they broke the expectation  \n&gt; of the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, what =\r\nAmazon really wanted was to insert a new step in the  \n&gt; workflow. For inst=\r\nance &quot;click this checkbox if you are not a  \n&gt; terrorist&quot; (now required by =\r\nthe US government :-)). What would  \n&gt; Amazon do? Probaly set up huge sign =\r\nreading &quot;we have changed our  \n&gt; interface, blah blah, follow this link ins=\r\ntead&quot;. This is the human  \n&gt; documentation you mention.\n\nYes. And you exact=\r\nly describe how server evolution is independent from  \nthe client when the =\r\nclient is human driven.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What would the corresponding computer change b=\r\ne? If it is not a  \n&gt; mandatory step (which it probably is) then it could j=\r\nust use content  \n&gt; negotiation to version the interface and everybody woul=\r\nd be happy.  \n&gt; If it was mandatory then our computer has to learn a new me=\r\ndia type:  \n&gt; application/shop.terroristcheck+xml. Amazon would still keep =\r\nthe  \n&gt; &quot;buy&quot; relation, but at the end of it there would be our new media  =\r\n\n&gt; type.\n\nYes. Or probably some kind of redirect based on a missing &#39;order =\r\n \nparameter&#39;.  Key point being that the server can in fact evolve  \nwithout=\r\n breaking the communication immediately.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; From this I would say: client=\r\ns should *not expect any specific media  \n&gt; type for a relation* - the &quot;buy=\r\n&quot; relation only states &quot;GET this to  \n&gt; continue buying&quot;, but at the end of=\r\n that link the computer could  \n&gt; find any ressource: an application/shop.o=\r\nrder+xml or application/ \n&gt; shop.terroristcheck+xml or something else.\n\nMy =\r\nconcern is with the step just before that. The client expects the  \nbuy rel=\r\nation to be there because otherwise you ould not even code it  \n(you cannot=\r\n make the client code choose the buy relation if you do not  \nassume that i=\r\nt is there in the first place).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess a client should not be driven =\r\nby *expectations* of what to  \n&gt; find where - only by *knowledge* of it&#39;s c=\r\nurrent ressource and a  \n&gt; *goal*.\n\n\nYep. I&#39;ve been down that road, too. Bu=\r\nt I found that eventually it  \ncomes down to expecting &#39;availability&#39; of go=\r\nals (availability of the  \ntransition that constitutes a given goal). It&#39;s =\r\nbecause machine  \nclients have their own state machine - they are not drive=\r\nn by the  \nservice. A machine client actively is coded to buy - it does not=\r\n  \nbrowse around and if it suddenly finds a buy link is triggered to  \nexec=\r\nute the buy goal.\n\nA machine client will consist of an inherent flow of act=\r\nions (its own  \nstate machine). For example: search, pick item, buy - the o=\r\nnly way you  \ncan code that is by expecting, for example, buying to be avai=\r\nlable  \nfrom the application state &#39;viewing item&#39;. And such an expectation =\r\nis  \nformed at design time, based on some hypermedia describing the kind of=\r\n  \nservice (such as application/atomsrvxml).\n\n&gt; You would then end up with =\r\na huge matrix of media-types and goals,  \n&gt; each of which telling the compu=\r\nter what to do next. Any unknown  \n&gt; media type would kill the application =\r\n(or make it backtrack and try  \n&gt; something different).\n\nBut this assumes t=\r\nhat the client does not have its own program flow;  \nlike a GUI application=\r\n that is driven by the user. In pure machine  \nclients this is impossible i=\r\nf they persue a certain task (as opposed  \nto crawling and indexing, for ex=\r\nample).\n\nYou can also view the client and service as two independent state =\r\n \nmachines with points of coordination (the goals). Both state machines  \ne=\r\nxist independently and if the service-side state machine changes in a  \nway=\r\n that the client is not capable of mimicking the communication  \nbreaks.\n\n\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Our initial goal would be &quot;find item&quot; and initially we would look up  \n=\r\n&gt; a specific URL and get the representation stored there. Then our  \n&gt; medi=\r\na-type/goal matrix would tell us what to do next. It would never  \n&gt; depend=\r\n on an expectation of what ressource type to find at the end  \n&gt; of any rel=\r\nation - it should only know that &quot;if I have media- \n&gt; type=3Dapplication/sh=\r\nop.item+xml and goal=3Dbuy then I must GET the  \n&gt; &#39;buy&#39; relation and then =\r\nre-evaluate with the new ressource&quot;.\n\nThat is a very good approach. But you=\r\n are describing a client without  \nown program flow. Try to code that as pa=\r\nrt of some program that has  \nits own life and just interacts with the serv=\r\nice to &#39;get a job done&#39;.  \nThe key point is: Does the client side want to b=\r\nuy some item? Or does  \nit want to buy some item *SHOULD IT HAPPEN TO COME =\r\nACROSS SOME LINK  \nTHAT ENABLES TO BUY SOMETHING?*\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that make sens=\r\ne?\n&gt;\n\nYes, it does.
