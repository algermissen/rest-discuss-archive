Something like:\n\npermalinks - \n\nhttp://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/XML2001/\nhttp://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/JulyHoliday/\n...\n\nalternative state-based &#39;views&#39;\n\nhttp://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/planned/\nhttp://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/issued/\n...\n\nalternative views would return collections of resources that match the view, using the permalinks i.e. http://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/planned/ would return :\n\n&lt;trips&gt;\n    &lt;trip permalink=&#39;http://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/Xmas2002/&#39; \n             link=&#39;http://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/panned/Xmas2002/&#39; /&gt;\n    &lt;trip permalink=&#39;http://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/Easter2003/&#39; \n             link=&#39;http://www.mytravel.com/person_identifier/trips/panned/Easter2003/&#39; /&gt;\n    ....\n&lt;/trips&gt;\n\nAnyone using a state-based link to a trip that is no longer in that state would receive a 301 moved status code with the link to the current state.\n\nYou could still use the state-based uri to manipulate the state as mentioned in the OP.\n\nStill, I feel a little uneasy about the existence of more than 1 URI for the same resource, but this happens all the time on the web and the 3xx status codes show that this behavior was identified and catered for.\n\n\n&gt;I think the URI should be the permanent identity of the business \n&gt;entity and its state should be represented either by data elements or \n&gt;hyperlinks.\n\nCan you give an example of state being represented by hyperlinks?\n\nRobert\n\nPS Anyone else feel that email is definitely NOT the best medium for brainstorming ideas. It&#39;s hard to beat a bunch of people locked in a room to sort out a few things :-(\n\n\n"}}
