Can we please discuss whether the above is &quot;RESTful&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if not, what would it take to make it so?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not RESTful, because &#39;square&#39; is an instruction to be \n&gt; &gt; followed, not data to be submitted.  In addition, this is a poor\n&gt; &gt; example because the client *expects* that squaring is done, which\n&gt; &gt; kind of begs the question as to why it can&#39;t do it itself and then\n&gt; &gt; PUT the result ... 8-O\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to hear it&#39;s not RESTful.  That&#39;s a start.  (The reason\n&gt; the client doesn&#39;t square is because it doesn&#39;t know how to, kind of\n&gt; like why you don&#39;t do your own dental work, assuming you don&#39;t, but\n&gt; none of that is relevant now.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, can you make it restful by changing the way you think about\n&gt; it?  For instance, can we call it a *record* of an action, or perhaps\n&gt; a short &#39;action document&#39;, or a &#39;delta representation&#39; of future\n&gt; resource state, or any other &#39;trick&#39; that gets us beyond this\n&gt; hitch?  What if we argue that it came straight from an HTTP form\n&gt; submission?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please anticipate where I&#39;m going with the above and help me find\n&gt; the boundary.\n[snip]\n\nAhah...I was wondering if I was missing a very subtle semantic point in your\nexample, or if I was correct in thinking that you were putting a remote\nprocedure call into a POST request.  It looks like the later is true,\nbecause no matter how you slice it, you&#39;re effectively doing a square(x, y)\nacross a network, which is good for SOAP-RPC, but goes against the RESTful\nstyle.\n\nWhat *would* be more RESTful?  An abstract approach might be to transfer a\nrepresentation in a POST request that sends a 201 (Created) response\nincluding a &#39;Location&#39; response-header field that specifies the\nsubordinate&#39;s location.  The recent shopping basket (in the client state\nposts) example is a good place to start.\n\nIn other words, once you&#39;re ready to check out, you might POST the basket\nrepresentation to an order taking resource.  This might cause the server to\ncreate a subordinate of a container resource, and hand you a URI in the 201\nresponse that you can then use to do subsequent GET/PUT/POST/DELETE\nrequests.\n\nPhilip\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
