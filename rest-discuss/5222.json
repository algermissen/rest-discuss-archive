I have long thought that these  \nthings go to the heart of what REST is about, but now that I started  \nto actually apply REST to create a networked system I see much more  \ninteresting issues coming up (admitedly, I had this oh-duh-that&#39;s- \nwhat&#39;s-this-is-all-about-smack-hand-to-forehead moment). While the  \nsystem I work on is of rather low complexity, there are massive  \nmaintainability issues - ideally you want to forget about your  \ncomponents once they have been deployed. IOW, the issue is: dealing  \nwith change.\n\nI suddenly realized after 2+ years of investigating REST[1] how  \ncentral the issue of change is and that the real questions that have  \nto be asked when designing RESTful APIs are:\n\n- what linking semantics do I need in my message types\n   to enable clients to discover the URIs they need at\n   runtime\n\n- how do clients get a hold on the initial URIs, what is\n   the evolvability cost of hardcoding them and where?\n\n- what is the right balance of a-priori knowledge (usually\n   hardcoded in the client) of the system and knowledge\n   transferred to the client via representations? Should I\n   put micro scripting engines in my clients to enable them\n   to cope with RDF namespace version changes in the future?\n   (e.g. code to tell the client how to transform\n   ex2:lives-at to ex:address)\n\n- what kinds of changes can I imagine now and how could I\n   come up with clients I would not need to touch at all in case\n   these changes appeared (the ideal case of course)\n\n\nI am amazed how similar my maintainability problems (hard to touch  \ncomponents at all once they have been deployed) are to the situation  \nwith browsers on the Web: whoever maintains Web applications cannot  \njust add a feature that requires an upgrade of the client code.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1] If that puts me in the idiot corner - so be it :o)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
