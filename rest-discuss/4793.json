I&#39;ve described them and defined URIs for each \ntype below. Any comment would be much appreciated!\n\n1) Get a map showing a route from a source location to a destination \nwith optional intermediate locations:\n\nGET /map?\nsrcx=00001&srcy=00002&dest1x=00003&dest1y=00004&centerAbout=route&sca\nle=6000\n\nor alternatively using path parameters:\n\nGET /map/srcx=00001;srcy=00002;dest1x=00003;dest1y=00004;centerAbout=\nroute;scale=6000\n\n2) Get a map displaying all features of a given type within a \nspecified radius of the source location (proximity search):\n\nGET /map/x=00001;y=00002;centerAbout=src;scale=6000?\nradius=5000&filter1=restaurants&filter2=licensed\n\nWith an arbitrary number of destination locations possible in case \n1) and an unbounded number of filters in case 2) these URIs could \nget quite lengthy.  Are there any rules of thumb for determining \nwhen a query has become too long to be conveniently handled by a GET \noperation, and if so what are the alternatives?\n\nCheers\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
