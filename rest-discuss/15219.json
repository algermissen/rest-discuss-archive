How hard can it be.\n\nAnd off they go.\n\nSending crap over HTTP == REST. Thankfully, REST is easier to\npronounce than HTTP. So all my ad hoc HTTP RPC interfaces now become\nREST interfaces. Simple. Just rolls of the tounge.\n\nSo, the problem is that REST is already understood, WELL understood.\nIt just happens to be pretty much completely wrong.\n\nThen you have to go in to the whole thesis, the concepts behind it,\nthe vocabulary, etc. etc. etc. &quot;Why can&#39;t I just POST whatever I\nwant?&quot; arguments, etc.\n\nIt&#39;s hardly worth fighting any more. It&#39;s exhausting. If folks want to\nknow about REST, they can look it up.\n\nIf you think that REST is misunderstood, then rewrite the wikipedia\narticle until it&#39;s clear, so that rather than getting in to exhausting\ndiscussions, advocates can just point to that and the thesis and tell\nfolks to come back later if they&#39;re interested. They won&#39;t, HTTP RPC\nsolves 99% of the use cases that they&#39;re REALLY trying to solve, so\nthey won&#39;t make the leap to rearchitecting their system. But at least\nit makes it easier for folks using it to make the material more\napproachable.\n\n"}}
