But I recently\n&gt; saw an interesting piece of code, which for=\r\nced me to think again about\n&gt; the basics.\n&gt; \n&gt; The code I am looking at, is=\r\n actually overriding HttpServletRequest\n&gt; and oerriding &#39;getMethod&#39; to chan=\r\nge HTTP verb from POST to GET. then\n&gt; doing request forwarding.\n&gt; So for th=\r\ne forwarded resource its a GET request, even if from browser,\n&gt; its was a P=\r\nOST request.\n&gt; I see two problems with this,\n&gt; 1. The response is still giv=\r\nen to user agent as part of POST request.\n&gt; 2. For web container, even if g=\r\netMethod is overridden, its a POST\n&gt; request. (I do not know, if in the for=\r\nwarded requests, web containers\n&gt; strictly use the request objects thats wr=\r\napped and do not use any of\n&gt; the internal information for that request)\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; The advantage of this method, is that you do not need to persist\n&gt; infor=\r\nmation between redirects, So you do not need session or other\n&gt; persistence=\r\n mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone else has seem this kind of idiom used in J2EE web a=\r\npplications?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Unmesh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
