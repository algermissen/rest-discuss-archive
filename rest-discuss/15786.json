I am seeking a RESTful alternative. I will act as the business analyst here, stating the problem in a language that makes sense to the business. Here&#39;s the problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of us have had to catch a taxi at the airport (or some similar setting) where a lot of people are doing the same. Generally, we stand in line, the taxis arrive, waiting if necessary, and the party at the front of the line gets in the taxi, works out an agreement with the cab driver, and goes. Sometimes, the cab driver and passengers won&#39;t reach an agreement and the passengers will go back to the front of the line and the taxis take the next passenger. Details follow:\n&gt; \n&gt; There are four types of actors involved: Passengers, an airport, the taxi companies, and taxis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s what we know of the basic process:\n&gt; 1) passengers and taxis arrive at the airport with random inter-arrival times\n&gt; 2) on arrival, passengers ask the airport for a taxi\n&gt; 3) on arrival, taxis ask the airport for a passenger.\n&gt; 4) the airport makes passenger/taxi pairing by an &quot;oldest first&quot; rule for both taxis and passengers, among those unpaired\n&gt; 5) unpaired taxis and passengers wait for the airport to pair them\n&gt; 6) after a taxi and passenger are paired, they try to agree on terms of service\n&gt; 7) Sometimes taxis and groups can&#39;t agree and then the passenger goes back in line. The taxi should be paired with the next available passenger. \n&gt; 8) the airport breaks a pairing when either party tells the airport negotiations failed, or if 1-2 minutes pass.\n&gt; 9) failed pairings will not be repaired\n&gt; 10) the probability of negotiation failures is small for all taxis and all passengers, and eventually every party finds a pair they can deal with\n&gt; 11) the airport can and should make concurrent pairings\n&gt; 12) a taxi departs when it and its passenger reach agreement and it tells the airport of the agreement, whereupon the airport&#39;s duties are done\n&gt; 13) taxi companies like to watch the passenger line depth (excluding paired passengers) to make dispatching decisions (the decision mechanism is out of scope)\n&gt; \n\nI am not sure what you are up to with this. Do you want to develop a system that simulates the above actors?\n\nOr are the actors actors in use cases? What are those use cases and where is the software system that is to realize them?\n\nI guess what makes most sense is that the airport is the system, but then you mentioned it as an actor, too.\n\nCan you clarify?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In typical business fashion, these represent a &quot;best effort&quot; attempt to capture the &quot;current&quot; requirements and may be clarified or revised somewhat for arbitrary and capricious reasons, because management is full of evil bastards. Complaining about this, or imprecise language, or other &quot;IT mumbo jumbo&quot; will result in you being reassigned to work on the TPS reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
