I blogged about it at [1].\n&gt;\n&gt; OTOH, I&#39;d be curious to know how you guys think it should have been\n&gt; implemented if it were RESTful.  Thus far I believe I can mostly recognized\n&gt; RESTfulness, but still don&#39;t know how to design for it.\n\nIt&#39;s similar to the JSON/RPC approach. You make an encoded call and\nget the data back.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting that people are still using this pattern. It&#39;s\nkinda the starting point for WS-* and XML-RPC and all those.\n\nI don&#39;t have much of a problem with this particular pattern I have to\nsay. I&#39;d prefer a proper RESTfull API with hypermedia as the engine of\napplication state. But this is a pragmatic alternative. If paypal are\nprepared to scale this app (in my view this is the killer reason for\nusing REST) then it&#39;s fine. \n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
