Maybe I should just leave it &quot;decide which kinds of\n&gt;&gt; resources you want to expose&quot;, but I was wondering whether this &quot;kind&quot;\n&gt;&gt; thing\n&gt;&gt; merits its own term.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good question. I think the answer is &#39;yes&#39;, but as such not defined\n&gt; within the REST scope itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to favor DDD (Domain-driven Design) these days, so every\n&gt; primary entity and their immediate entities have a guaranteed resource\n&gt; exposure, whether I have an actual pre-defined use for them or not. (I\n&gt; know this sounds strange and even bad practice to a lot of people, but\n&gt; it has saved the day in too many projects for me to ignore their\n&gt; usefulness :) After that there&#39;s some heavy thinking about &quot;what kind\n&gt; of stuff you want to expose&quot; which normally ends up in a few good\n&gt; workshops. Not sure that &quot;kind&quot; can even be typified, but I guess\n&gt; there&#39;s that useful portmanteau of &quot;things&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; that can be\n&gt; defined a bit (and this resonates well with the minimal REST\n&gt; interface).\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex\n&gt; --\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n&gt; ------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n&gt; \n\n"}}
