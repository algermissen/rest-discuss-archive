For \n&gt; example, one could consider any web link to be a continuation.  The \n&gt; meaning of the continuation on the server is the return of the resource \n&gt; to which it refers.\n\nI think they&#39;re inherantly unRESTfull because they&#39;re per-session. A\ncontinuation can&#39;t be part of a RESTfull namespace because it\nrepresents session state.\n\nAll current implementations of continuation based servers are the\nsame:\n\n   grab the current continuation (a program stack)\n   save the continuation in a session\n   restore the continuation when the user hits the relevant uri\n\nanother possible implementation is:\n\n   1. grab the current continuation\n   2. serialize the continuation to something encodeble \n   3. send it back in the response\n   4. allow it to be sent back to the server and reconstruct the\n      continuation\n\nthe problem with this is step 2. You have to capture the entire state\nof the machine and represent it somehow. Not an easy task.\n\nI&#39;ve seen pure LISP toy implementations of this. But no practical\nsystem is possible (IMHO) because real implementation languages are\nrarely pure (there&#39;s a lot of C)\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Unless the continuation&#39;s state can be parcelled up with the\n&gt;&gt; continuation (and they&#39;re aren&#39;t many languages that support that -\n&gt;&gt; even LISPs can&#39;t the C bits of the stack) then you&#39;re going to need to\n&gt;&gt; scale with increasing hardware rather than multiple machines.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; I think I agree with you here.  As long as by &quot;continuation&#39;s state&quot; you \n&gt; mean the continuation, \n\nOur terminology might be tripping us up here. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m using\nthe correct terminology. To me, a continuation is a recorded program\nstack; that *is* state.\n\n\n&gt; and by &quot;continuation&quot; you mean the &quot;continuation \n&gt; ID&quot; of which I spoke.  In other words, the continuation, as a \n&gt; representation of &quot;what to do next&quot;, must be part of the request, if the \n&gt; system is to be scalable.  The &quot;what to next&quot; might be, take the result \n&gt; of this form, use it to change a resource, then return the page that \n&gt; represents that resource.\n\nThat&#39;s not enough to record the continuation. A serialized\ncontinuation is basically a serialized program stack.\n\nWhat to do next isn&#39;t enough; you must record what went before in\norder to make what to do next have any sense.\n\nI guess you *could* build a continuation system based on some abstract\nsyntax for what you&#39;re going to do next. But I&#39;m not aware of one.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; In other words the problem is how do you load balance continuations?\n&gt;&gt; They&#39;re state so it&#39;s hard to do. Massive virtualization tools might\n&gt;&gt; help but people aren&#39;t focused on building those for languages that\n&gt;&gt; support continuations.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Hmm, not familiar with massive virtualization tools.  Can you give an \n&gt; example?\n\nHave a look at:\n\n  http://www.azulsystems.com/\n\nthey do java and .net virtualization on a massive scale. But the cost\nis enormous. \n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t believe these kind of tools are the answer; hence\nI don&#39;t believe continuations are a good tool. \n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
