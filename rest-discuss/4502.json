Suppose an RDF document is\n&#39;running through&#39; an intermediary which intends to augment the\nrepresentation with data about many of the resources referenced,\ne.g. getting human readable labels or whatever from some\nHTTP service.\n\nMy suggestion would be to specify the group (what do the\nresources have in common that makes you want to retrieve\nthem in batch?), create a resource for it and then GET the\nresource:\n\nPOST /mumble/groups HTTP/1.1\n\n&lt;data that specifies the group, maybe only URI/ID list, but\nmore likely some sort of query or pattern, e.g.\ndc:Creator=&quot;Jim Smith&quot;\n\n\nServer reponds:\n\nHTTP 201 Created\nLocation: /mumble/groups/8873\n\n\nThen you \n\nGET /mumble/groups/8873 HTTP/1.1\n...\n\n\nDoes this help?\n(It certainly helps me, thanks for triggering this by your post :o)\n\n\nJAn\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, it seems like some HTTPng might have a b[atch]GET\n&gt; operation.
