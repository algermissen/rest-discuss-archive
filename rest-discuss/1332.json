I especially appreciate\nPaul Prescod&#39;s excellent articles and posts, and of course Roy Fielding&#39;s\nseminal thesis.\n\nOf the numerous benefits of the REST model, two things jumped out at me:\n\n1. The benefit of a naming system (URI&#39;s) that encourages the explicit\nnaming of resources so that those resources can become active participants\nin the system - thus, become leverageable by other applications and used in\nways that the original resource provide may not have thought of.\n\n2. The importance of using a few universal verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)\nfor applications that want to scale to the web level, where it is difficult\nto coordinate and enforce changes to every participant.\n\nThese two concepts got me to thinking about REST and Object-Oriented\nprogramming.  At first, it would seem clear that they are opposing\narchitectural approaches, especially when OO is view in the terms of CORBA\nor SOAP-RPC.  But, I actually think there is more in common than meets the\neye.  Maybe this has already been discussed, but I would like to explore a\nway of looking at REST from an object-oriented viewpoint.  \n\nOne of the fundamental concepts behind OO is that everything is an object\nand every object has basic methods that it must support.  By using these\nbasic methods, a whole bunch of interesting  applications can be written\nwhich manipulate objects without knowing anything else about these objects\n(for example, containers, sorters, formatters, storage, etc).\n\nEvery object is addressable in the namespace of the OO system, in a similar\nway that URI&#39;s are addressable in the current web system.  And the generic\nobject manipulators are not unlike how people create new applications from\nURI&#39;s that may be totally outside of the original intent of the URI\nproviders.\n\nI think where CORBA and SOAP-RPC deviate from this is in their focus:\n\n1. They don&#39;t encourage making all objects addressable, but rather encourage\nhiding objects behind a few addressable objects.\n\n2. That they don&#39;t focus on just a few universal methods for all objects,\nbut focus on defining new methods, many of them simply to access the data\nhidden per above.\n\nThese two factors together vastly diminish the capability to benefit from\nthe web&#39;s network effects and reduce the ability to create interesting\napplications from existing &quot;objects&quot;.\n\nTo take this a little further, it seems that there may be some room for\nexpanding from the current 4 basic methods (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE)\nwhich are very much document-centric to include some basic methods for\ntransaction-centric objects.\n\nAs Bob Haugen mentioned in recent email, we would like to model transactions\nin REST.  If we think of URI&#39;s are objects, a transaction may be like a\nthread object.  We may want to add START, STOP, CANCEL, and GETSTATE (maybe\ncan be overloaded by GET).  With some basic set of extensions, we can write\napplications that can control and monitor arbitrary transaction systems.\n\nAnyway, just some late night ramblings.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
