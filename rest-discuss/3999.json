The paper&#39;s description is:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This document shows how the web-calculus is derived from the\n&gt; REST architectural model that underlies the World Wide Web (WWW).\n&gt; The advantages of this approach to web services are highlighted.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The paper covers the material from my presentation at HP Labs a\n&gt; few weeks ago. The paper and the talk explain why the web-calculus\n&gt; is a good approach to web services.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope this paper will better communicate why I am working on the\n&gt; web-calculus, and encourage others to as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking of submitting this paper to CACM, so I look forward\n&gt; to any feedback.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n\n"}}
