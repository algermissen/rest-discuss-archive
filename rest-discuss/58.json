It is bad to have useless silos of functionality. Why should\nSMTP have some features and REST other features unless there is some\nreason that the two features do not coexist naturally. For instance,\nthere is HTTPS but as far as I know, there is no POPS. So I had to set\nup SSL-based POP &quot;manually&quot;. And I can&#39;t depend on it being available in\nan application. If POP was HTTP then &quot;POPS&quot; would be avaialable\neverywhere.\n\nReason #2. The web is organized around URI addresses. HTTP is the only\nprotocol that is similarly organized. You could make a URI-centric SMTP\nor POP but it would be just as hard as adding async infrastructure to\nHTTP software but you&#39;d be left with problem #1.\n\nReason #3. We&#39;re computer scientists. Overgeneralizing is what we do.\n\nOf course SMTP and POP are not going away. But if we&#39;re building new\nasych apps then yes, I&#39;m going to follow the party line and say that\nasynch HTTP are the way to go. And the sooner we clarify that the\nbetter.
