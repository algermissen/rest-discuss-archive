If\nthese messages have content-type: message/http-request then the it can be\nparsed as such and handed to some sort of HTTP dispatching software - like\nApache. The response from something like Apache would go up as a new HTTP\nrequest with content-type: message/http-response.\n\nThe collection of pending messages can be a third party provider of\n&#39;mailbox&#39; functionality. With tricky software you could be backwards\ncompatible by having the intermediary hold open the connections for older\nclients until a message/http-response arrives (or times out), do the\ncorrelation and literally pipe the response back to the older client.\n\n\n\n"}}
