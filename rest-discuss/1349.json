So for example \nwhen &quot;purchase orders&quot; come up again, as they did last week, there is \na reference available.\n\nThe pages are by no means complete. Purchasing is fleshed out a lot \nmore than any of the others.  Paul indicated he was working on \nsessions, so I left that part completely blank.\n\nBut I am personally going to give it a rest for a while and see if \nanybody else think it&#39;s useful enough to contribute.\n\nIt&#39;s a wiki, so feel free to edit.  I&#39;m sure I missed something and \nscrewed up something else.\n\nHave fun,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
