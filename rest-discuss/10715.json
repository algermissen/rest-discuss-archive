This HTML is being\nedited by a human being using a wordeditor like TinyMCE, FCKEditor,\nKupu, or whatever.\nWhen I click on &quot;Save&quot;, a PUT request is fired containing the HTML.\nThe server updates its internal state, and replies ok. At the next\nGET, I&#39;ll see the HTML I just sent.\n\nNow let&#39;s say that the server needs to do some html cleanup, like\nstripping some tags, or modifying some attributes. This might be done\nin the PUT request handler, just before updating the internal state,\nso that I store the cleaned up version. Fine. When I do GET, I&#39;ll see\nthe cleaned up version.\n\nNow, let&#39;s say that I want to support another button: &quot;Cleanup&quot;. This\nbutton cleans up the currently edited content, but doesn&#39;t save it on\nthe server yet. It&#39;s useful because I might be working on a &quot;dirty&quot;\nhtml for a long time, and I need to clean it up from time to time\nbefore finally saving. Unfortunately only the server knows how to\nclean it up, so the operation could never be performed in javascript\nby my browser.\n\nHow does this last requirement fit inside the REST view of the world?\nUp to the last point it looked like a very simple problem of putting\nand getting a resource.\nBut if I just want a simple &quot;Cleanup&quot; button, all of a sudden this\nlooks so much like RPC. So? I&#39;m a little confused. Should I just say\nthat this part of my application doesn&#39;t fit the REST assumptions, so\nit doesn&#39;t even make sense talking about it? Or does it make sense to\nconsider it under a different light?\n\nThanks a lot!\nStefano\n\n"}}
