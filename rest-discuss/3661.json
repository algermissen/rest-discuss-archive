Has there been an exploration\n&gt; of how application security affects other REST guidelines? It\n&gt; seems like supporting access control has ramifications for many\n&gt; parts of REST, the most well-known effect being the interplay of\n&gt; HTTP Auth and caching. It seems that if not done carefully,\n&gt; access control could negate many of the benefits of REST. What are\n&gt; your thoughts?\n\nEven if it is done carefully, access control does negate some goals\nof REST (shared caching in particular).  However, it doesn&#39;t negate\nthe benefits of the model: a given security model can be analyzed\nto see how it affects applications that are attempting to communicate\nusing the REST model, and then improved based on those observations.\nLikewise, security models can learn from the lessons of REST in order\nto improve their efficiency.\n\nI think it is very important to note that the REST model is not ideal\nfor all applications, and that various aspects of security (access\ncontrol, authentication, authorization, accounting, and privacy of\ncommunication) will place requirements on the architecture that need\nto be addressed in the interaction model.\n\nMost sites address this issue by separating secure services from the\nservices that need higher scalability.  This is hampered somewhat by\nthe goofy way that WWW browsers warn about &quot;secure&quot; sites containing\n&quot;insecure&quot; embedded content.  Likewise, just about every variation on\nsecuring web sites is damaged in one way or another by browser\nbehavior, which is why sites currently use cookies as authenticators.\n\nI should note that the big conflict between REST and security models\nis the fact that REST does not allow for sessions.  What needs to be\nunderstood is that sessions are bad for security models too -- they\ncause most of the denial-of-service and man-in-the-middle attacks\nto be possible.  What is needed is an efficient, session-free means\nof authenticating that is more secure than username/password, which\nis actually an easy problem to solve if you don&#39;t try to solve all\nof the security problems at once.  What is blocking that is the need\nto negotiate security mechanisms before engaging in secure\ncommunication, which is currently done within a session.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
