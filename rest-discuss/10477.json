Objects are finer grained and designed for\n&gt;  purposes other than external interface needs.\n\nI can agree on the former, but not generally on the latter. However, I\nwas more pointing to the fact that the word &quot;resource&quot; is really\nwhatever you make of it, including objects (whatever you make &quot;object&quot;\nout to be). :)\n\n&gt;  My point here is that the potential for abuse is too high.\n\nNot sure that this RESTful objects thing is any more prone to abuse\n(i.e; wrong use) than any other thing out there. HTTP by itself is\nabused all the time, even the OO paradigm is overly abused by most\ndevelopers anyway. Unfortunately for the human race it requires proper\nknowledge to do things well. There&#39;s always some smartness that goes\nwith every job well done, no matter what field, profession or\nsituation. Guns don&#39;t kill people; bullets do. Are you saying the\naccessibility of our tool are to blame for the abuse of the tool?\n\n&gt; The OO folks\n\nWho are they?\n\n&gt; will\n&gt;  go ahead and design object models the way they always have, or will reuse\n&gt;  existing models, and then just slap some HTTP on top of them with some URLs\n&gt;  that reference those objects, and will REST on the 7th day.\n\nHmm, aren&#39;t you more saying they won&#39;t REST on the 7th day? :)\n\n...\n\n&gt;  I predict way more wrong than right will be inflicted on business\n&gt;  stakeholders and IT management with this approach. ;-)\n\nGiven the knowledge business stakeholders / owners and IT management\nin general show on REST, I&#39;d say we&#39;re safe for a long time still. :)\nIf they don&#39;t understand the goodness of REST, then they&#39;re not\ncapable of understanding the trouble with not doing it right either.\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
