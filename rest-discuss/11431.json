In other words, how many servers out there are going  \n&gt;&gt; to benefit from this technique?\n&gt;\n&gt; the question is more how many page authors will be able to reliably  \n&gt; develop forms against services/servers? i think mike&#39;s idea is  \n&gt; pretty good because it increases loose coupling between clients and  \n&gt; servers.\n\nI don&#39;t disagree, and I do see the value of templates for non-browser  \nscenarios. But the most of the web today won&#39;t be taking advantage of  \nthis for a long time.\n\n&gt; on today&#39;s web, forms and services are more or less tightly coupled,  \n&gt; and they almost are developed as one thing. mike proposes an  \n&gt; architecture that introduces a more loose coupling, because a form  \n&gt; is able to interact with more services than before.\n\nAgain, I don&#39;t disagree about loose-coupling, but the technique serves  \njust a tiny tiny fraction. Also consider the amount of JS code out  \nthere that knows how to construct URIs from form params and other  \ninputs. That won&#39;t be migrating to use templates anytime soon.\n\n&gt; ( mike, please correct me if i am wrong. )\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Not having templates in forms does not violate URI opacity since  \n&gt;&gt; HTML forms do follow a well-defined and well-understood approach to  \n&gt;&gt; construct a URI from form parameters.\n&gt;\n&gt; yes, but if you have some service out there that expect certain  \n&gt; URIs, then currently it is not possible to build a form for that,  \n&gt; unless the service does expect form-encoded data. mike&#39;s proposal  \n&gt; would allow forms to interact with a much wider set of services.\n\nSame as above. Those services/servers can very well allow form-encoded  \ndata. I would argue that, doing so is better since it would let them  \nwork with existing browsers and JS libraries.\n\nSincerely,\nSubbu\n----\nhttp://www.subbu.org\n\n"}}
