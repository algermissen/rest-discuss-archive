I did\n&gt; although compare it t=\r\no SOAP&#39;s action header, so the question is: what is the\n&gt; context for your =\r\nanswer - the content type header or the action header? I\n&gt; guess you are re=\r\nferring to the action header?\n&gt;\n&gt; Switching on content type still seems oka=\r\ny to me - even though I do not know\n&gt; if it makes sense when you take the o=\r\nther answers into account. The feed\n&gt; back so far is mostly: create another=\r\n ressource to POST to - don&#39;t do\n&gt; different POSTs to the same ressource.\n\n=\r\nNo, you&#39;re right. I misspoke.\n\nIt&#39;s an interesting idea.\n\nThe premise is th=\r\nat PUT take a resource representation and performs the update.\n\nIt does &quot;mu=\r\nddy&quot; the concept of a PUT at the detail level. But, from a\npragmatic level,=\r\n it&#39;s really much like quibbling over the difference\nbetween:\n\nUPDATE name =\r\nSET (firstName, middleInitial, lastName) VALUES\n(:origFirstName, :origMiddl=\r\neInitial, :newLastName) WHERE id =3D :id;\n\nand, simply:\n\nUPDATE name SET (l=\r\nastName) VALUES (:newLastName) WHERE id =3D :id;\n\nI think to be pedantic, y=\r\nou would use PATCH instead of PUT for this,\nbut that&#39;s just because it seem=\r\ns to have found favor (I don&#39;t know the\norigin for PATCH, as it&#39;s not one o=\r\nf HTTP verbs, though WebDAV uses\nPROPPATCH, so there&#39;s likely some inspirat=\r\nion from that).\n\nAs for the argument about uniform interface, and that usin=\r\ng PUT with a\nfragment doesn&#39;t quite comply with that, I&#39;d probably disagree=\r\n as\nwell, as the uniform interface (i.e. PUT will take the entire resource\n=\r\nrepresentation and do the right thing) still exists, this is just an\noverlo=\r\nading of it.\n\nWhat would be best is that the availability of a &quot;fragment en=\r\nabled&quot;\nPUT is discoverable (perhaps via OPTIONS, or some other negotiation\n=\r\nprotocol), so that clients can degrade gracefully.\n\nSo, basically, I think =\r\na fragment can work well, but I think you\nshould still be able to send the =\r\nentire resource as well, using the\nfragments as an optimization for those c=\r\nlients that support it.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
