I think there=\r\n are a lot of grey areas.\n\nFor example, something that is pure &quot;routing&quot; (m=\r\nessage in, message out with little change other than the destination addres=\r\ns/URI) seems like a connector to me. Except what if it&#39;s a customer service=\r\n app that routes incoming emails to the most appropriate employee by perfor=\r\nming sophisticated analysis of the email body? Still a connector? Does the =\r\ndependence on application state/logic make it a component? So does a connec=\r\ntor need to be independent of the application domain and reusable across co=\r\nntexts? How reusable does it need to be? What if my router only looked for =\r\na keyword in the subject line? What if it just did a round robin across all=\r\n customer service employees? Where&#39;s the line between connector and compone=\r\nnt?\n\nCurious about what others think as well.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
