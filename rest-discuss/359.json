The risks of running public servers are well known.  They\n&gt; are administered by skilled specialists and even so are generally outside (or\n&gt; right on) the firewall.  The skill and commitment of users is lower.  The\n&gt; machine setup is less secure.\n\nNone of this is unique to HTTP.  Essentially you are arguing against any sort of\ndecentralized system where nodes have symmetric connectivity and no fixed client /\nserver roles.  You&#39;ve just given the administrative argument against p2p in any\nsense.\n\nIMO, it&#39;s important to recognize that, while security should be considered and dealt\nwith, the *way* it&#39;s dealt with today (i.e., network admins who build walls around\ntheir castles) imposes severe obstacles to creation and proliferation of new,\ninnovative technologies.  It also *dramatically* lowers the value of the network as\na whole;  since the value rises with the number of possible interconnections between\nnodes, the fact that most of the nodes in the Web today are clients and cannot be\nconnected *to* is a serious value constraint.\n\nWithout discounting the need for *security,* it&#39;s important to recognize that\n*network admins* and their administrative practices which cause asymmetric\nconnectivity are in fact damage and must be routed around if we&#39;re to get maximum\nvalue out of this network-thingie we&#39;ve built. ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
