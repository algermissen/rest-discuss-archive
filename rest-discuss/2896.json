This smells suspiciously like the &quot;correlation IDs&quot; from\n&gt; mailbox-and-dispatcher-SOAP that we trashed in a previous thread in\n&gt; this list.\n\nI don&#39;t read Roy&#39;s mind, but the term &quot;transaction ID&quot; strikes me as \ndifferent than &quot;correlation ID&quot; in the sense that correlation IDs are \nfor identifying conversations whereas I think of converstaions as being \ncomposed of transactions. So we might have a conversation spanning hours \nbut a transaction would typically be only the minimal set of messages \nthat must be grouped perhaps for atomicity reasons. Nevertheless, I do \nsee some competition between the notions of statelessness and \ncross-message transaction identifiers.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
