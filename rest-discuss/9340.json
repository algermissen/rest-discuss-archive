Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; [2007-07-02 13:50]:\n&gt;&gt; What I want to do is have a second DELETE on the same URL erase\n&gt;&gt; the file, thus changing the response code to 404. But if two\n&gt;&gt; users DELETE the same resource, the inadvertent result (which\n&gt;&gt; neither user intends) is the 404 response on a subsequent GET.\n&gt;&gt; My DELETE implementation is non-idempotent because the\n&gt;&gt; side-effects of a second DELETE request identical to the first\n&gt;&gt; DELETE request are different. Even though each DELETE is\n&gt;&gt; idempotent by itself, the sequence is not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having people DELETE a URI which the server says is 410 is\n&gt; unusual enough; it doesn’t really matter if it becomes a bit more\n&gt; peculiar, so I’d just reject any DELETE to a 410 URI that lacks\n&gt; an If-Match header.\n\nYes. This confuses me considerably.\n\nLet&#39;s ignore the zero-length files (implementation detail) and look at \nthe resource mantipulations.\n\n1. Resource Exists.\n2. DELETE -&gt; Resource doesn&#39;t exist.\n3. DELETE -&gt; Resource exists even less?\n\nThe state of a resource returning 404 or 410 is identical - null.\n\nAll that is different is metadata about a resource that used to exist. \nThis is primarily a convenience to a client trying to understand why a \nGET or POST failed.\n\nIf you want to manipulate the metadata of a resource that doesn&#39;t exist \nyou&#39;d be best to make that metadata a resource in itself.\n\n\n"}}
