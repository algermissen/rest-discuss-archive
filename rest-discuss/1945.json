The problem mentioned with intermediaries refers to network\n&gt; socket level connections.\n\nPer the recent conversation on socket-level aspects of HTTP, it strikes me\nthat they are deliberately not a part of the protocol.  There are actually\ntwo protocols, an application-level protocol defined by the HTTP RFCs and\na socket-level protocol defined by standard practice.  Don Box&#39;s comment\nrefers to the socket-level protocol.\n\nAt the same time, limited duration of connections is a deliberate part of\nthe REST architectural style.  It is expected that HTTP is mainly used for\nhypertext documents, not messages, and it is reasonable for proxies to\nassume that well-behaved connections will be short lived.\n\nShort lived connections follow from stateless transactions, and stateless\ntransactions follow from HTTP&#39;s scalability requirements.  HTTP web\nservices should be architected to avoid the need for long lived streams\nbecause long lived streams expend too many server resources.  Web\napplications that need long lived streams imply a less scalable web!\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
