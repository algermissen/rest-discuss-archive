It is an identifier of a\n&gt; representation of a resource.  The representation may or may not be\n&gt; identical to the resource itself.\nI&#39;m pretty sure the URI identifies the resource, not a representation.\nRepresentations are transient things - unless you explicitly make the\nrepresentation a resource in its own right - but that gets fractally complex\n(representations of a representation of a resource, etc.).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For instance, suppose we have a purchase order resource on the server.  It\n&gt; has a representation identified by URI1.  At the same time, suppose we\nalso\n&gt; have another representation of the PO identified by URI2.\nThere would then be two resources. &#39;The PO&#39; would be URI1, and &#39;The PO\nheaders&#39; would be URI2. The data returned by URI2 also happens to be\navailable within the data returned by URI1.\n\nThis gets into what I call &#39;overlapping resources&#39; (a possibly poor term,\nbut it works for me..) I think of URI2 as a &#39;synthetic resource&#39; or a\n&#39;derived resource&#39;. Operations like DELETE might not actually do anything -\neither indicated by &#39;not implemented&#39; or some other response - or they\nmight, its up to the application to decide.\n\nJust my opinions though.\n\n\n\n"}}
