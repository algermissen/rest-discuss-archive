This means it is falsifiable.  Roy&#39;s thesis\nexplains clearly the benefits of a RESTful approach like:\n\nGET /image.jpg (for Etag)\nGET /image.jpg?rot=90 (cacheable)\nPUT /image.jpg\n\nThe PUT entity is the cached /image.jpg?rot=90 and the request is\nconditional, using the Etag from the initial GET to avoid the lost-\nupdate problem.\n\nRoy&#39;s thesis explains both the tradeoffs of this approach, and the\ndrawbacks of following Google&#39;s RPC approach.  When tested, the\ndescribed implementations, mine and Google&#39;s, will bear out exactly\nwhat Roy&#39;s thesis predicts.\n\nThis is not proof of REST, but is further corroboration of the thesis.\nThe RESTful solution is capable of avoiding the lost-update problem.\nGoogle, by claiming that REST requires the image to be rotated on the\nclient and using the word &quot;awkward,&quot; doesn&#39;t begin to falsify the\nscience behind REST, which has been corroborated by enough\nimplementations over time as to make its falsification less and less\nlikely -- certainly not by RPC.\n\nIf we are to take seriously the notion that Google&#39;s solution, by\nvirtue of being Google&#39;s solution, somehow falsifies REST, then Google\nwill have to come up with a solution that isn&#39;t so easy to falsify\nagainst the goals of REST, particularly scalability.  Believe it or\nnot, it&#39;s possible for Google to get scaling wrong -- as proven by\ntheir RPC image-rotation example.\n\nMy REST solution *falsifies* Google&#39;s RPC approach, because beyond the\nlost-update problem, it uses GET to rotate images, not POST, resulting\nin cacheable image rotations.  Google&#39;s approach only allows a rotated\nrepresentation to be viewed by first changing the state of the resource.\n\nRoy wrote an entire thesis explaining the benefit of transferring\nrepresenations of application state between components, which I can\npoint to as explanation for why my solution is architecturally correct.\nWhere is a corresponding thesis Google can point to, which falsifies\nREST by explaining the benefits of remote procedure invocation over\nHTTP?  Oh, right, it&#39;s Google so I can just take them at their &quot;awkward&quot;\nword.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\n\nREST is hard science, which is what allows me to override any logical\nfallacy based on arguing that surely, Google knows more than I do about\nAPI design.  All Google needs to do, is provide some documentation in\nthe language of computer science, which falsifies REST by proving that\ntheir RPC approach is more scalable than the solution I posit.\n\nUntil then, evaluating my solution against the hard science of REST\ngives me solid ground to claim that it falsifies Google&#39;s approach.\nCan anyone falsify my approach?  I&#39;m not interested in opinions, only\nfacts which may be proven or disproven.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
