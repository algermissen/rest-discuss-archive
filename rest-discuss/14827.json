Thanks. :-)\n\nGood!\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Roy Fielding pointed out several times, an API must not call itself RESTful as long as it is not applying HATEOAS. I want to support this constraint by adding HATEOASfulness to my future applications. One thing I just do not understand so far about HATEOAS-via-HTTP is (and what other people asked me when citing Fielding in this issue): How a client shall actually know which http method to use to follow a link received with the previous request to a RESTful server? Roy answered in his blog that the method could be read out of the last result. But actually how?\n\nThis information is part of the hypermedia semantics specified (media type specification or link relation specification etc). Such a specification can either explicitly state the method to use (see RFC 5023 for example) or specify a hypermedia element that tells the client at runtime what method to use (e.g. HTML forms).\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; I understand that typically one would use e. g. http &quot;Link&quot; headers or e. g. XLink in XML content to model HATEOAS transformation URIs. But the problem is that in reality neither the &quot;Link&quot; header nor XLink provide the possibility to declare the http method used on that URI.\n\nRight. The specification of the link relation would have to do that.\n\n&gt; So my client can learn from the previous http request what the URI is to place an order, but it does not see which http method must be used to place it (whether it is a PUT or a POST for example, since both could be valid in theory).\n\nRight. Suppose you&#39;d use an AtomPub collection to tell the client about the order processor:\n\n&lt;app:collection href=&quot;/orders/&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;app:accept&gt;application/procurement+xml;type=order&lt;/app:accept&gt;\n&lt;/app:collection&gt;\n\nThen you would know from RFC5023 that the method to use is POST.\n\nThere is really no technical magic going on - it all must be specified and implemented by the client (or the client plugin loaded for processing the primary media type of the current steady state).\n\nJan\n\n&gt; I understand that in a perfect world, I could apply the common sense for the CRUD-via-http pattern on that resource (PUT, GET, POST, DELETE), but it might be not so obvious in all cases which of that methods is actually right to achieve a particular business task, since the business use case is beyond simple CRUD, as there might be more than one way to RESTfully model a complex business case.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fielding wrote in his blog that the client will learn about the http methods by inspecting the last response, just as it learned about the possible URIs. But how to actually achieve this in reality, aside from the purely theoretical idea? Is the actual solution really to break down all business cases to CRUD atoms (and such to unambiguity of http methods)?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I already searched the archive for this but could not find a working real-world solution (maybe I used the wrong keyword when searching?).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Markus\n&gt;  \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
