Then if you want to add the tag &quot;chunkybacon&quot;\nto a set of images, you could POST to e.g. /tag/chunkybacon/ an\nentity-body with the list of the URIs of images you want to add the\ntag. Of course if you GET /tag/chunkybacon/ you&#39;ll see a\nrepresentation of a list of all chunkybacon images so far.\n\nA similar trick using lists is to expose a list of all image tags\nunder /images/&lt;id&gt;/tags; then you can POST multiple tags to a single\nimage. A more complex application would be to support image sets at\nURI level, like &quot;/images/&lt;id1&gt;;&lt;id2&gt;;&lt;id3&gt;&quot;; then you can POST\nmultiple tags to multiple images at &quot;/images/&lt;id1&gt;;&lt;idN&gt;/tags&quot;... You\ngot the idea. Whatever method you use, be sure to link to or create\nforms to it elsewhere.\n\nSide note: the &quot;list URIs&quot; above, as a not-much-known convention, use\n&quot;,&quot; as separator when order matters and &quot;;&quot; when it doesn&#39;t. Note also\nthat URIs have a maximum lenght.\n\n\n\nOn 5/2/08, Gary Bernhardt &lt;gary.bernhardt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Fri, May 2, 2008 at 4:56 PM, Stefano Masini\n&gt; &lt;stefano.masini@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;m still trying to figure rest out. Let&#39;s see if I hit a sweet spot\n&gt; &gt;  or if I&#39;m just missing something (more likely, please forgive me).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I have several images, each with its own uri that have metadata.\n&gt; &gt;  If I want to update the metadata of a given image I send a POST\n&gt; &gt;  request on its uri. Right?\n&gt; &gt;  What if I want to atomically update some metadata (say, a tag) for a\n&gt; &gt;  group of images, how do I approach that?\n&gt; &gt;  Sending multiple POST requests, one for each uri, is not atomic, so I\n&gt; &gt;  can&#39;t accept it.\n&gt;\n&gt; First, it sounds like you want PUT, not POST.  PUT means &quot;create or\n&gt; replace the entity&quot;; POST means &quot;accept this entity as a child&quot;.  What\n&gt; you want to do here is GET the full representation, make whatever\n&gt; changes you want, then PUT the whole thing back.  It&#39;s a\n&gt; &quot;read-modify-write&quot; operation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I thought about posting on the common parent of all the image uris\n&gt; &gt;  (say, if I have /images/1, /images/2, etc., then I post on /images).\n&gt; &gt;  In the parameters of the post request I would put a list of all the\n&gt; &gt;  imaged ids (or entire uri), so that the server can handle the request\n&gt; &gt;  atomically.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d define a way to refer to a specific set of images.  Say you want\n&gt; to modify images 1, 4, and 13.  You can PUT (and GET) to\n&gt; &quot;/images/1,4,13&quot; with an entity fully describing three images.  This\n&gt; is just like your proposed idea, except you&#39;re referring to a limited\n&gt; set of images instead of all of them.  The server then atomically\n&gt; replaces images 1, 4, and 13 with the entities you provided.\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing to note is that URIs like this require more complex linking.\n&gt;  The client needs to be able to construct those &quot;1,4,13&quot; URIs somehow,\n&gt; but it must be told how to, at runtime, by the server; otherwise it\n&gt; would violate HATEoAS.  You need a way to say something like &lt;a\n&gt; href=&quot;/images/&#92;d(,&#92;d)*&quot;&gt;, where the href there is actually a regex\n&gt; describing how to build a URI out of a series of integers.  Maybe\n&gt; someone else can chime on how to do this well, because I have no idea.\n&gt;  I do know that you do *not* want to actually use regexes, though. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  But then what should I get in return? What should /images return if I\n&gt; &gt;  issued a GET? The whole repository? Naaa... too big.\n&gt; &gt;  Isn&#39;t the POST supposed to return the same representation? Just after\n&gt; &gt;  handling the posted request.\n&gt;\n&gt; This question is answered by the limited-subset solution above.  When\n&gt; you GET &quot;/images/1,4,13&quot;, you get back exactly what you&#39;d expect -\n&gt; images 1, 4, and 13, just as they were when you PUT them in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  How much am I missing from the rest picture?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, the PUT/POST thing, but everyone makes that mistake at first. :)\n&gt; I think another thing people often miss is that the URI space doesn&#39;t\n&gt; have to be rigid or static.  That&#39;s exactly the issue here.  What\n&gt; you&#39;re trying to do is modify a subset of a collection, so just say it\n&gt; in the URI! :)\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Gary\n&gt; http://blog.extracheese.org\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
