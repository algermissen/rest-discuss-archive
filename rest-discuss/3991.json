Suppose you know I&#39;ve\n&gt; been renovating my house for the last 4 years, and you&#39;re interested\n&gt; in that project.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I (the author) assign a URI as an identifier of the concept\n&gt; &quot;Walden&#39;s house renovation&quot;, and give you that URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose that you use a browser or whatever to deference that URI\n&gt; periodically over a span of several years.  Suppose that each time\n&gt; you do so, you retrieve a different &quot;document&quot; in response, each one\n&gt; representing at the time of dereferencing the project under study.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that if each document so served required its own URI, then\n&gt; there would be no identity at the level of my project, only identity\n&gt; of documents representing it.  That would not serve your interest in\n&gt; my project as well as having an identifier that targets the project\n&gt; directly.\n&gt;\n&gt; As the &quot;author&quot;, I assign the URI, and then manage the implementation\n&gt; such that the representations all support a &quot;sameness&quot; of subject.

IMHO,\n&gt; : abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\n&gt; : are\n&gt; : subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\n&gt; : words:\n&gt; : subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\n&gt; : part\n&gt; : of the architecture itself).\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\n&gt; : include\n&gt; : c) ?\n&gt; :\n&gt; : The second question I have is related to the question what the\n&gt; : semantics of a resource are.  Roy&#39;s dissertation says:\n&gt; :\n&gt; : &quot;REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the\n&gt; :  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather\n&gt; :  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the\n&gt; :  time the reference is created.&quot;\n&gt; :\n&gt; : To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the\n&gt; : semantics of resources.  What is the precise meaning of &#39;author&#39; here?\n&gt; : Author of a &#39;document&#39; that uses a particular URI or the author that\n&gt; : somhow &#39;brings into being&#39; a particular resource?\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Thanks,\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Jan\n&gt; :\n&gt; : [1]\n&gt; : http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; : --\n&gt; : Jan Algermissen                &lt;algermissen@...&gt;\n&gt; : Consultant & Programmer\n&gt; :\n&gt; : http://www.topicmapping.com\n&gt; : http://www.gooseworks.org\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; : To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; : rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Your use of Yahoo!
