I&#39;m\n&gt; looking at using the HTTP/1.1 caching support (Etag, If-Modified-\n&gt; Since, If-None-Match and If-Range). I have some questions about how\n&gt; this works when deployed on a cluster of servers with a load\n&gt; balancer, is this a good place to ask, or can someone recommend a\n&gt; good list to discuss HTTP caching.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tx\n&gt; Simon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
