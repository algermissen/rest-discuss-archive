And since that expectation\nisn&#39;t provided by other resources, then the connector semantics aren&#39;t\nuniform.\n\nIt&#39;s an ok hack, sure, but better I think, would be indicating that\nexpectation explicitly in the message (i.e. make it self-descriptive)\nvia a new method.\n\nMark.\n\nOn Fri, Oct 08, 2004 at 04:30:16PM -0400, Joe Gregorio wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Bud wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am using GET to retrieve bunch of data from the backend, I am using REST.\n&gt; &gt; As part of my GET request I am attaching a filter object in text/xml\n&gt; &gt; format well the query sometimes is bigger than what GET request can\n&gt; &gt; handle which is I guess 2KB of data, how should I solve this problem.\n&gt; &gt; I am using POST for Creates and Modifys.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I guess my only alternative is to put some sort of flag in the\n&gt; &gt; request and send the request thru POST and at the backend I can check\n&gt; &gt; for this Flag and perform a GET operation using the POST input.\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to take a look at this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Aug/0182.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \t-joe\n\n"}}
