The form can still reference the container as the target of the POST\nthough.\nYou could also use different content-type representations of the container\nresource (the client uses the Accept header) one for the data and one for\nthe description of how to interact with it.\n\nIf the form is retrievable separately from the data, there are different\nways to reference between the two:\n - a response header that identifies the resource that describes the\nacceptable interactions for that resource\n - a separate resource that identifies the data resource and the\ninput/schema resources, there may be more than one acceptable input to the\nsame resource. For example:\n\n&lt;manufacturer&gt;\n &lt;products&gt;\n  &lt;product type=&#39;shoes&#39;\n    resource-location=&#39;http://shoesRus.com/shoes/&#39;\n    service-description=&#39;http://shoesRus.com/shoes/services&#39;&#39;&gt;\n &lt;/products&gt;\n&lt;/manufacturer&gt;\n\nI like the approach of mixing the data and the accepatable interactions -\nkind of how HTML did it.\n\n"}}
