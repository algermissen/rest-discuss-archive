I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I \n&gt;&gt; used REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On the surface, looks like a good match but how do I use REST to make \n&gt;&gt; multiple updates in a single atomic operation? I can see how I&#39;d pull \n&gt;&gt; the entry for bnewport from a cache, but what about all the records \n&gt;&gt; whose age is &gt; 37?\n&gt; \n&gt; Simply build an API that supports that. There&#39;s no reason why you\n&gt; can&#39;t POST multiple datums at once. \n&gt; \n&gt; But you don&#39;t have to do that, see below. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC? \n&gt;&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records per server \n&gt;&gt; interaction and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I could solve it \n&gt;&gt; using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see lots of \n&gt;&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol. \n&gt;&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\n&gt; \n&gt; Build a transaction API; for example: \n&gt; \n&gt;   POST /transaction          =&gt; transaction id \n&gt; \n&gt; now put some data into it: \n&gt; \n&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;   somedata \n&gt; \n&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;   moredata \n&gt; \n&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;   evenmoredata \n&gt; \n&gt; now commit it: \n&gt; \n&gt;   GET /transaction/{trnid}  =&gt; transaction representation \n&gt; \n&gt;   PUT /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;   {transaction representation} \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would say that you&#39;ve misunderstood REST. It&#39;s not as complicated as\n&gt; you think it is. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n\nI don&#39;t know, one of the advantages of REST with HTTP was compatibility with \nHTTP security like web seal etc. Your suggestion above hides the records in \nthe transaction representation which looks no better than SOAP in terms of \nleveraging HTTP caching, security etc. These looks like pluses to me as REST \ncan leverage these builtin HTTP services. I thought unless the record keys \netc are encoded in the URL then I may as well use SOAP, no? \n\nBilly\n\n"}}
