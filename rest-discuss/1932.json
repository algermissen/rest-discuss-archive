As such, you&#39;d need a message correlation ID, among\nother facilities, which core SOAP doesn&#39;t provide, but does leave hooks\nfor.\n\nSOAP itself doesn&#39;t mandate any particular architectural style (unlike\nREST, it isn&#39;t one), but it does encourage looking at the world in terms\nof messages, not state transfers.\n\nCheers,\n\n\n"}}
