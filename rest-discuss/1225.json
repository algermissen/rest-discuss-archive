It would be\nequally ridiculous for the client to try to send the *entire\nconversation* before it could add a single message. If the server has\nexposed some state as a resource then the client can rely on it.\n\n&gt; In short, I agree with the &quot;No Implicit State&quot;, but I still don&#39;t see how\n&gt; these assersions support the conclusion that &quot;Clients should be considered\n&gt; entirely stateless.&quot;\n\nMy point is that the server should make no assumptions about how much\nstate the client is maintaining and vice versa. That is an extra\nimplementation dependency that degrades interoperability.\n\nIt should all be in the message or in resources referenced by the\nmessage. Cookies are a violation of this principle (which is probably\nwhy they aren&#39;t a W3C specification).\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
