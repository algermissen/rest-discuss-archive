However I&#39;m surprised at his opposition to XML. In\n&gt; what seems to be the CouchDB use case the primary purpose is to store\n&gt; web pages in a database.\n\nI&#39;d say documents, every kind of document\n\n&gt; This is exactly what XML is for, and exactly\n&gt; what a native XML database and XQuery are designed to do. That he had\n&gt; some problems using XML as an API substitute does not surprise me, but\n&gt; why has he then thrown the web page baby out with the RPC bathwater?\n&gt; Curious.\n\nHe seems quite skilled and competent so behind the harsh post there\nmust be something bothered him.\nFor my little experience with Erlang, and taking a wild guess, I&#39;d say\nJSON is better handled in Erlang than XML and since he\nembeds a JavaScript engine the difficulties handling JSON are\nbasically non existent. BTW he supported XML as exchange format until\n0.7 so there has be to a technical reason (maybe Erlang&#39;s support for\nXML?) to justify the change. I should dive into the mailing list and\nfind out but I don&#39;t have time right now\n\n&gt; The real question, I suppose, is whether CouchDB supports any\n&gt; subdocument level of granularity. Can you actually search inside\n&gt; documents, or can you emrely insert and retrieve them by key? What if I\n&gt; want to cut documents apart and put them back together again? Is this\n&gt; possible? If not, we&#39;re simply back in the MySQL world where all pages\n&gt; are unstructured BLOBs. I spent some time looking through the FAQ and\n&gt; documentation but I couldn&#39;t figure out how to do this.\n\ncouchdb is declared &quot;alpha software&quot; so there&#39;s plenty of stuff ahead.\nI don&#39;t have answers for your question because I have zero experience\nwith this tool. I&#39;m reading (in this exact moment) some introductory\nmaterial online.\n\n&gt; Or perhaps I&#39;m just totally misunderstanding the use case? However,\n&gt; without understanding the structure of the documents CouchDB contains,\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t strike me as a modern tool for web site development compared\n&gt; to options like eXist and Mark Logic.\n\nCouchDB has for free the features that make Erlang shine, I wouldn&#39;t\ndismiss it so easily.\n\nAnyway, we&#39;re just speculating and we are deeply off topic as Karen\ntrying to say in the other thread ;-)\n\n-- \nLawrence, stacktrace.it - oluyede.org - neropercaso.it\n&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand\nsomething when his salary depends on not\nunderstanding it&quot; - Upton Sinclair\n\n"}}
