I&#39;m being dense just know.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing that my group was &quot;getting&quot; was the idea that every useful state\n&gt; is just an explicit link from wherever we are now,\nWhat do you mean by &#39;state&#39;? I&#39;m thinking in terms of client, server and\nserver-based data. It sounds like you are using &#39;state&#39; as in state\ntransition... maybe that&#39;s a viewpoint that I haven&#39;t tried yet.\n\n&gt; and how beautiful it is\n&gt; when the client doesn&#39;t have to try to invent meaningful states and then\n&gt; gamble on their validity in the system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Walden\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: S.
