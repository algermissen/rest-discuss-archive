So, =\r\nI believe the most natural\n&gt; solution would be to encode the resource scopi=\r\nng information in the URI\n&gt; like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /computers/1+2+3+4+5+6/tempe=\r\nrature\n&gt;\n&gt; but of course this doesn&#39;t scale beyond a certain limit (the URI=\r\n gets to\n&gt; large and hits the limits of the most popular HTTP servers).\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The alternative would be to first save your subset of computer IDs on\n&gt; th=\r\ne server by creating a new temporary resource with a PUT or a POST and\n&gt; th=\r\nen reference it in a GET. However this looks cumbersome, and leads to\n&gt; 2 r=\r\nequests when 1 would do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Plus, if the service was meant to be read-o=\r\nnly it wouldn&#39;t even be\n&gt; possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; What would be a possible RESTful ap=\r\nproach here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Free Ekanayaka\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: it seems that other peo=\r\nple already have raised this issue, for\n&gt; example the real-life problem I d=\r\nescribed is a variation of the sample\n&gt; problem described here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://=\r\nblog.labix.org/2009/07/23/accessing-restful-information-efficiently\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
