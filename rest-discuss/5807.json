I\n&gt;&gt; can do that with cookies and URL rewriting, but it isn&#39;t so easy to\n&gt;&gt; do with HTTP authentication. I think I actually figured out a way to\n&gt;&gt; do it if JS is enabled, but I haven&#39;t tried it and once again, what\n&gt;&gt; do I do if JS is not enabled? Do I degrade by saying you can&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; SSO without JS? Do I degrade by switching to cookies/URL rewriting?\n&gt;\n&gt; See the OASIS SSO stuff (Liberty alliance).\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a RESTfull addendum to that which I will try and publish here.\n&gt;\nUnderstanding the Liberty Alliance stuff is on my list. Thanks for  \nthe suggestion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 7) Lastly, these sites will each have several people who can do\n&gt;&gt; various administration roles such as editing, reviewing, moderating.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m planning on having every administrator come up with a second\n&gt;&gt; &quot;admin&quot; password of there own, and forcing them to supply the admin\n&gt;&gt; password before doing any administration, all of which will happen\n&gt;&gt; under HTTPS. This is one area where I&#39;ve considered HTTP auth might\n&gt;&gt; fit, because all the administration could take place under /admin, I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t care about SSO, I&#39;m not so worried about confusing the user\n&gt;&gt; because that actually would add to the security. But once again, I\n&gt;&gt; was stopped by the inability to log them off once done.\n&gt;\n&gt; Better to have a single user and apply roles. Then they don&#39;t have to\n&gt; reauthenticate.\n&gt;\nWe are planning on doing role based access control, such that the  \nusers get roles and the roles get permissions. But I really want to  \nrequire a second password for administration for the same reason that  \nUNIX administrators have a separate password for root. But I don&#39;t  \nwant one root password for the whole network. Each user that is given  \nadmin privileges would chose their own admin password, which they  \nwould need to supply after having already logged in with their  \nregular password to escalate their authentication to admin. (And each  \nuser would get certain specific admin roles by escalating their auth.)\n\nSo since I want two passwords, I think it would be nice to be able to  \ncontrol what the prompt is. They don&#39;t really need to specify a  \nusername because they are already authenticated as the user, they  \njust need to supply their admin password. I think that would be  \ndifficult to communicate via an HTTP auth drop down dialog.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
