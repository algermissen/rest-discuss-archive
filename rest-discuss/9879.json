I suppose I could swallow this provided the user still saw\n&gt;&gt; the same pages and the site still worked if cookies were turned off.\n&gt;&gt; (That&#39;s not what I see in practice though.) In other words if the only\n&gt;&gt; purpose of the cookie were to gather knowlege about how users navigate\n&gt;&gt; through a site.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That was exactly what I was getting at -- it seems to me cookies are a \n&gt; good solution for this particular problem. Of course they&#39;re abused 95% \n&gt; percent of the time.\n\n\nOnly 95%? You&#39;re an optimist. :-)\n\nAnd now that I think about it, I suspect that cookies aren&#39;t really \nnecessary even here. I have seen log file analyzers that are smart \nenough to provide this sort of tracking information without relying on \ncookies. You simply need to pay attention to the address and time of \nvarious requests to link them up.\n\nIt&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s more than good enough for practical work.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
