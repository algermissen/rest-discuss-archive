Fine.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Consuming a message from the queue, though, seems problematic.\n&gt;  They allow either GET or DELETE on the *same* URL to pop a message\n&gt;  from the queue.\n\nI don&#39;t see anything wrong with that (possibly timing issues when two clients\nconsume the same item).\n\nGET to find out the queue entry.\nDELETE to remove it (being processed).\n\n\nIs it &#39;wrong&#39; to use two verbs on the same resource?\nIf so why?\n\nDELETE on a queue perhaps should delete the whole queue.\nDELETE on an entry I&#39;d hope would DELETE only that entry.\n\nregards\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
