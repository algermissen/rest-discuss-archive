The closest I could find was in 1.1 Purpose:\n\n        &quot;Practical information systems require more functionality than\n        simple retrieval, including search, front-end update, and\n        annotation.&quot;\n\nIs that what you meant?  If so, I understand that and agree, but I still\ndon&#39;t get your point, sorry...\n\n&gt; &gt; As Nick pointed out, there aren&#39;t many systems out there that do\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; (interactive Web browsers being a notable exception). I think this\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; one of the drivers for the sem-web initiatives, but I also think \n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; value in trying to leverage this approach today to build more robust\n&gt; &gt; software systems that can gracefully handle changes in the service\n&gt; &gt; implementation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many systems that use computed links. Almost all of the\n&gt; closed-world hypertext systems had automated dictionary lookup\n&gt; (click on any non-linked word and it retrieves the dictionary\n&gt; entry for that word). Programming IDEs do much the same. A template\n&gt; is just a way for a server to tell a client that there is a range\n&gt; of resources available -- just like server-side image maps, HTML\n&gt; forms, and (in less visible ways) javascript. As long as the template\n&gt; is defined by the server, they are still links. As long as the\n&gt; template\n&gt; is defined by the server in a recent representation, it is RESTful.\n\nThanks for the pointer to the computed links concept.  It&#39;s been a\ncouple years since I read much of the hypertext research, and I didn&#39;t\nremember this.  With a quick google, I found this paper that looked\npretty relevant:  &quot;Hand-made and Computed Links, Precomputed and Dynamic\nLinks (1997)&quot; (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/161116.html).  From the\nintroduction:\n\n        &quot;This paper surveys the use of hand-made and computed links in hypermedia systems and\n        contrasts precomputation and dynamic computation of those links which are computed.\n        This paper seeks to raise all the issues in one place, so that designers of hypermedia\n        systems can consider the issues together, whether they can afford to ignore some forms of\n        link, which forms are the most suitable to their working environment, and so on.&quot;\n\nBased on a quick skim of the paper, I guess I should qualify my\nuneasiness about URI templates.  I can see how the server could specify\na URI template in the resource it sends to allow computed links (for\ndictionary, glossary or other types of lookup) using JavaScript or\nsomething like XForms and an agreement about what the form did as part\nof the specification of the content model.  In effect, as you say, it&#39;s\nfunctionally equivalent to an HTML form, because the form effectively\ndefines the template as stated by the recommendation Nick referenced.\n\nThis use of template URIs still wouldn&#39;t bother me because they would be\ndefined (potentially) dynamically by the server and be a part of the\nrepresentation used by the client.  Since they&#39;re part of the hypermedia\nthat must be processed by the client to accomplish any state transition,\nI 100% agree that they would, in fact, be RESTful.\n\nHowever, I see URI templates defined in a different resource -\nespecially out-of-band API documentation - as a totally different beast.\nAdmittedly, I only did a quick skim of the paper and a couple of other\nsources, but I would find it a bit of a stretch to say that these could\nbe considered computed links of the same kind.  By their very nature,\naren&#39;t they documented so that they can become part of the client&#39;s\nimplementation rather than having it use the information in the resource\nfrom the service?  The template isn&#39;t defined by the server at all in\nthis case, right, so how can this use of template URIs be RESTful?\n\nThanks again for the reference.\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S.
