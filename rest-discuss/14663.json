Probably messed up somehow)\n\nSo,=\r\n I agree (obviously) that it is more an implementation problem than a archi=\r\ntectural one.\n\nThat said, eventually architectures expose most of their val=\r\nue by being implemented :), so to rephrase my question, does anyone have an=\r\ny pointers to information that deals with implementing fine grained authori=\r\nzation at the REST level. Environment is not relevant right now for me as I=\r\n am just trying to graps possible abstrations that make sense in this conte=\r\nxt.\n\nPersonally I am trying to get something going by combining JSR311 with=\r\n Spring security but it gets a bit hairy if one wants to keep authorization=\r\n as a cross cutting concern that is mainly specified declaratively. \n\nFurth=\r\nermore, I don&#39;t have a good way of coping with e.g. a PUT of a resource whe=\r\nre an attribute is not provided. How to distinguish an attempt to &#39;nullify&#39;=\r\n that attribute vs a client that is PUTting the resource without having acc=\r\ness to the resource and at the same time keeping the authorization code out=\r\n of the REST processing logic.\n\n\nAny help warmly appreciated!\n\nPeter\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jim Webber &lt;jim@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Will&#39;s right when he says &quot;REST&quot; has nothing to with this. But there a=\r\nre regular ways of dealing with this using HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - The price of a gi=\r\nven order item should be &#39;readable&#39; by the &#39;creator&#39; of the order item whil=\r\ne an &#39;administrator&#39; should be able to update the price\n&gt; \n&gt; Using one of t=\r\nhe HTTP authentication mechanisms (or OpenID, OAuth even) the creator will =\r\nhappily receive 401 when applying some verbs (e.g. PUT, DELETE) to a resour=\r\nce (e.g. pricing) but find they&#39;re get 200 OK responses to other verbs (e.g=\r\n. GET). The administrator might find they receive 200 OK responses to all o=\r\nf those operations.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - An collection of order states (not a separate =\r\nresource but part of the order) should be readable by the &#39;creator&#39;. An &#39;ad=\r\nministrator&#39; should be able to add states\n&gt; \n&gt; How the order is projected o=\r\nnto the Web in terms of resources is an implementation decision. You might =\r\nchoose to have the collection of order states physically written down on th=\r\ne same piece of paper in your back end, but you could still happily project=\r\n them as different logical resources onto the Web. Hypermedia is your frien=\r\nd should you want to link them together. Eg:\n&gt; \n&gt; Administrator: GET/order/=\r\n1234\n&gt; 200 OK....\n&gt; &lt;order&gt;\n&gt; &lt;atom:link href=3D&quot;http://myservice/order/123=\r\n4/state&quot; rel=3D&quot;order-state&quot; type=3D&quot;application/x.ordering+xml&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;line-=\r\nitem&gt; ... &lt;/lineItem&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Creator: GET/order/1234\n&gt; 200 OK...\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;order&gt;\n&gt; &lt;line-item&gt; ... &lt;/lineItem&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Creator, after some =\r\ncreative thought tries: GET http://myservice/order/1234/state\n&gt; 401 Unautho=\r\nrized...\n&gt; \n&gt; Nonetheless, administrators will have more chance of a 200 OK=\r\n response than creators just as above.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that help at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
