Some of those of name value pairs have discrete\n&gt; values, and some have continuous values. There are two types of\n&gt; parameters that accept discrete values:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Parameters that accepts single discrete values only. e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt;      - image format\n&gt;      - exception format\n&gt;      - transparency\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Parameters that accept a list of discrete values. e.g\n&gt;\n&gt;      - Map layer names (layers=major-road,minor-road,river&)\n&gt;\n&gt; Examples of parameters with continuous values are:\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Geographic extent (minX, minY, maxX and maxY)\n&gt;     - Temporal ranges (from date/time, to date/time).\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore, the use of continuous values seems to dictate the use of\n&gt; query parameters. Describing map resources is not like describing a\n&gt; purchase order that has a single unique identifier. Does that make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Josh&#39;s suggestion of using hypermedia has actually been\n&gt;  &gt; implemented by WMS clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand what Josh is saying, but I disagree with him on this one\n&gt; because WMS was not designed to provide a user interface. It was\n&gt; designed to provide interoperability between software applications that\n&gt; need to display maps. (Separation of concerns.) A WMS client from vendor\n&gt; A should be able to simultaneously display map images from WMS servers\n&gt; provided by vendors B, C and E.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In addition, if  my memory serves me right, OGC&#39;s Web Mapping\n&gt;  &gt; Service also allow an XML encoding of request parameters, and\n&gt;  &gt; the WMS client composes an xml file and send it to the WMS\n&gt;  &gt; server using POST, which is definately not REST  IMHO. In the\n&gt;  &gt; xml encoding case, can one make it restful?\n&gt;\n&gt; GET would seem to make more sense to me, but I&#39;ll defer to those on this\n&gt; list who are more knowledgeable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Andrew Hallam\n&gt;\n&gt; Digital Earth Pty Ltd\n&gt; http://www.digitalearth.com.au\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
