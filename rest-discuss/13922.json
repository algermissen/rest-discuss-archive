Logically, one would\nASSUME they&#39;re identical.\n\nFrom a caching point of view, they are separate requests. A cache that\nhas the XML representation won&#39;t be able to answer a JSON query, so\nboth have a similar caching impact in terms of ensuring that the cache\nis properly synced with both representations.\n\nSo, on the surface, they really don&#39;t seem that much different to me.\nI was curious what other folks thought.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
