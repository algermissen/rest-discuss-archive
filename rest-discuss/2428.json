There is\n&gt;&gt;this idea that if we PUT a resource through its URI, then we GET\n&gt;&gt;that resource back, we should get back the same value as we PUT.\n&gt;&gt;That statement implies that we have representation-level control,\n&gt;&gt;which we do not.  It would make more sense to think of it this\n&gt;&gt;way.  If we PUT a representation to a URI, then GET back a representation,\n&gt;&gt;the latter representation *means the same thing* as the former,\n&gt;&gt;though it may differ in format or even typographically.  THoughts?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, PUT&#39;s a bit funny that way.  It&#39;s definined to really mean\n&gt;&quot;store&quot; more than &quot;set the state&quot;, so it is expected that bits are\n&gt;preserved.  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m having a hard time understanding why you say this.  In reading 2616, \nI can see how that might be one possible interpretation, but I don&#39;t see \nthat it requires that interpretation.  Perhaps I&#39;m missing something \n(quite likely).\n\nI would like to think that if I want to create a resource that indicates \nthe temperature in Paris at 0600 25-May-2002, I should be able to PUT \nthe temperature in degrees Farenheit or Celcius.  And further, assuming \nsome suitable kind of content negotiation, I would think that even \nthough I PUT degrees Farenheit, I should be able to GET degrees Celcius.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
