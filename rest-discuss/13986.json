I questioned the assertion because it is not uncom=\r\nmon to see\ngateway proxies mucking about in bodies, rewriting URIs etc.And =\r\nwhile\nthis is often criticized for all the obvious reasons, I wasn&#39;t aware\n=\r\nof any well-defined rule that was being violated. SIP contains\nlanguage lik=\r\ne &quot;The proxy MUST NOT add to, modify, or remove the\nmessage body.&quot; so that =\r\nsort of proxy behavior would be a violation of\nthe protocol.

Is this not the case?\n\nAl=\r\nso, I&#39;m curious as to why this couldn&#39;t be a style issue. The\nclosest thing=\r\n I&#39;ve found to architectural style-like constraints for\nthe SIP architectur=\r\ne is Rosenberg&#39;s Architecture and Design Principles\nfor SIP (http://tools.i=\r\netf.org/html/draft-rosenberg-sipping-sip-arch-01).\nIt describes the &quot;Proxie=\r\ns are for routing&quot; principle which assigns a\nspecific role to intermediarie=\r\ns -- similar to the roles assigned by\nthe client-server constraint. One mig=\r\nht argue that the SIP protocol\nconstraint quoted above is derived from this=\r\n principle. Is there some\nreason that an architectural style couldn&#39;t or sh=\r\nouldn&#39;t contain a\nconstraint that implies that intermediaries never modify =\r\nmessage\nbodies?\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n"}}
