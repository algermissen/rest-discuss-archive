Had it been a perfect world then all the &quot;life scien=\r\nce&quot; services would communicate using the same set of media-types - but it w=\r\nould still be useful with catalogoues for discovery of the services.\n\nIt is=\r\n more or less the same as the difference between a phone book and the netwo=\r\nrk protocol used by the phones.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
