If you must\n&gt; have the context-free ID (or other &#39;key&#39;) on its own (to\n&gt; avoid extracting it from the URI string in processing code)\n&gt; then including it as an extra attribute can&#39;t hurt.  Like so:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;account about=&quot;/account/1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n\nYes.  I was thinking about a very nice property for someone or something\nusing the data, which is being able to traverse the data-linkages\nwithout having to understand to put &#39;/account/&#39; at the front of &#39;1&#39;. \nBut, no, it&#39;s not either/or.  It seemed in the example like the &#39;1&#39; was\nbeing used where a URI may be more apporpriate.\n\n&gt; I would view having the URI as a minimum.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Having an about attribute with a URI in the root element\n&gt; like that is starting you down the road of making your XML\n&gt; RDF-friendly. (Josh: do you agree?)  I see this as a\n&gt; good thing, but that&#39;s a contentious issue.\n&gt; http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/10/30/rdf-friendly.html\n\nPartially.\n\nI&#39;ve been soaking in RDF recently, and think it is a very good thing --\neven if only as a good set of guidelines about how to structure plain\nXML.\n\nMy use of &#39;about&#39; and &#39;resource&#39; there was more &quot;those are the default\nattribute names I think of, now&quot; ... I&#39;ve used &quot;href&quot; for both before,\nbut never really was happy with it ... [mostly because it wasn&#39;t\nnecessaily a &#39;hypertext&#39; reference, exactly.]\n\nI think the more important thing is: if you&#39;re writing out a\nrepresentation of a specific [piece of] state, it&#39;s useful to identify\nit -- and other pieces of state traversable from it -- with a URI.  Use\n&quot;href&quot; or &quot;this&quot; or &quot;about&quot; or &quot;src&quot; or &quot;uri&quot; or whatever, but be\nconsistent about it.  If it&#39;s a public-facing thing, think about what\nthe callers will expect, &c.\n\n[ ... but preferably &quot;rdf:about&quot; and &quot;rdf:resource&quot;. ;) ]\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n# A: Because it breaks the flow of normal conversation.\n# Q: Why don&#39;t we put the response before the request?\n\n\n"}}
