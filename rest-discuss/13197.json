For instance:\n&gt; \n&gt; POST /api/v1/user/appliances/&lt;id&gt;/cmd/remove_package?name=&lt;name&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is used to *remove* a package from a virtual appliance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t a more restful approach be something like\n&gt; \n&gt; DELETE /user/appliances/&lt;id&gt;/packages/&lt;name&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments that will help my understanding of REST principles are \n&gt; greatly appreciated. Also, if you can help me to understand why they \n&gt; would have chosen one way over the other. The site is built on Ruby on \n&gt; Rails (according to their twitter stream).\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n\nYeah, not very restful because their URI&#39;s aren&#39;t resource oriented (and \nRPCish), but per earlier discussions on DELETE vs. POST  a\n\nPOST /user/appliances/&lt;id&gt;/packages/&lt;name&gt;/remove_package is just as \nviable as\nDELETE /user/appliances/&lt;id&gt;/packages/&lt;name&gt;\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
