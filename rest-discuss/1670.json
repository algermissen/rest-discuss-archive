Refer to Mark Bakers &#39;An Abstract Model for HTTP Resource State&#39; (http://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-state-model). \n\n&gt;And you never know how far these side effects reach. You are at the mercy of whoever\n&gt;made that particular object. \n\nWhy is this any different for a resource?\n\n&gt;You never know the state of the object, it&#39;s lika\n&gt;quantum-mechanics. Unless you look, you don&#39;t know what you have. And when you&#39;ve\n&gt;looked you still don&#39;t know :)\n\nThis is where REST is advantageous, however, you can still only see a &#39;representation&#39; of the state of the resource, i.e. you only see what the resource provider wants you to see, so you can never truly know the state of the resource?\n\nContinuing on with the whole no side-effects approach, I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling this notion, i.e. being purely functional (in the programming language sense) and being able to change the state of a resource via HTTP methods. Am I understanding what you mean when you say side-effect free and if so should we be looking more at FP rather than OOP for implementing REST-like systems?\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
