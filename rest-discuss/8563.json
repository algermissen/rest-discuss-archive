My background is in device\ncontrol.  Standards like WS-Management are making headway into small\ndevices.  Equal capabilities can come at a lower cost (memory, processor\npower, etc.) by applying the principles of REST to these small devices.  The\nonly problem is that I&#39;m not quite sure how the principles apply completely.\n\n\nDevice control consists of simple state transitions in terms of the device\nitself (e.g. turn on/turn off).  With REST, I&#39;m limited in terms of the\nverbs used to control that device (GET, PUT, POST, etc.).  That&#39;s fine.  I\ncan induce state changes through PUTs.  Although it&#39;s a bit strange to\nchange the device state to &quot;On&quot; when there are a bunch of intervening\nstates/progress indicators that a client wants to see on the way to &quot;On&quot;.\nThis can be handled too using separate states, control vs. progress.  I&#39;ve\nconsidered this to be resource state management.\n\nI&#39;m looking at where application state comes into play.  I consider\napplication state to be the client interactions with the device such that\nthe device gives the client hints about what transitions are valid against\nthe device while the device is in a given state. \n\nDoes this provide more context?\n\n\n"}}
