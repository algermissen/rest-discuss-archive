After all, the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;REST&quot; stands for &quot;state&quot;.  The\n&gt; server is state-less, but REST applications can have state.\nThe term &#39;stateless&#39; shouldn&#39;t be applied to REST or applications build in\nthat style. HTTP as a protocol is called a &#39;stateless&#39; protocol, because the\ninterpretation of any individual message is independent of any preceding\nmessage.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s\n&gt; just that maintaining state is the responsibility of the client,\n&gt; not the server.  Another way to say this is to say that the server\n&gt; maintains no session information.\nIf your application or business logic requires the concept of &#39;sessions&#39;,\nthen model those sessions as resources & you should be fine. Think of it as\na &#39;working session&#39; rather than &#39;protocol session ticket&#39; or something. You\nshould be able to set down your &#39;work in progress&#39; & pick it up later - even\nfrom a different client.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In the FSM/REST model that I use, state/session information is\n&gt; returned from the server to the client in an XML document.  In the\n&gt; subsequent request, the client returns this XML document to the\n&gt; server.  So, state information is passed back and forth between\n&gt; server and client.\nIf the resources involved are coarse-grained &#39;entry-points&#39;, then this is\nmore of a custom message-passing system, rather than using the built in\nprimitive/generic operations upon resources. The state information passed\nshould be a representation of a resource. The content should exclude\nidentification of any logical resource that the server should apply the\ninformation against.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you can see that the billing information could be passed\n&gt; back and forth between the server and client (perhaps in an XML\n&gt; document) until it is complete, error free, contains a valid credit\n&gt; card number, etc.\nYes, this sounds very reasonable. I&#39;d be interested to know the\nvisible/addressable resource model involved.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think what we have done in this re-design, is to take what we\n&gt; might have called state, and turned it into a (temporary?)\n&gt; resource.\nI would approach it in the same way- but perhaps did you mean &#39;turn session\ninto a resource&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
