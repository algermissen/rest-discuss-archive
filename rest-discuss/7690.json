Problem is that I lose track of the ETag at the\n&gt; end of the first request. The RFC says that a server MAY do so. Do\n&gt; most servers not return an ETag with the 201 Created response? If I am\n&gt; writing a new server, would clients ignore the ETag returned for the\n&gt; PUT response?\n\n\nYeah, I&#39;ve been around this particular house too ;-)\n\nAs it happens, I write in .net and the runtime sinks ETag headers if\nthey are set because a 201 response is not cacheable.\n\nAs to the clients, I haven&#39;t the foggiest - browsers don&#39;t support PUT\nand pretty much all the other clients are hand-cranked / proprietory.\nI&#39;m guessing that any MS software will ignore it on a PUT (just a\nguess from the server-side .net behaviour).\n\nMaybe someone who works in Java / Perl / PHP can advise what the\ndefault behaviour is in those runtimes.\n\nI have to admit it seems odd to send an ETag along with a response\nmarked no-cache, but it is permitted by the spec if you wish to do so.\n\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
