Not a violation of the spec --\n&gt; more just &quot;disregard&quot; for the spec.  So &quot;SHOULD&quot; is to be treated as:\n&gt; &quot;you really ought to unless you really know what you are doing and\n&gt; you have a good, valid reason not to&quot;, not &quot;this is a good idea that\n&gt; you might want to consider&quot;. (...)\n&gt;\n\nThe thing is, HTTP isn&#39;t constrained to being used on the Web.  So\nthere are plenty of things in there which, in the context of the Web,\nbecome a &quot;MUST&quot; even though the spec says &quot;SHOULD&quot;.  For example, the\nuse of registered media types.  If your context is intranet, then knock\nyourself out disrespecting the SHOULD by creating new media types willy-\nnilly.\n\nIf your context is the Web, then how is an intermediary to tell the\ndifference between one application/vnd.customers+xml and another?  Such\na collision is likely on the Web, so consider the use of registered\nmedia types a MUST.  If your context is intranet, then g&#39;head.  These\nSHOULD instead of MUST situations in the spec aren&#39;t loopholes.\n\nOff the Web, I send Content-Location with 201 responses instead of\nLocation, &#39;cuz it makes more sense to _me_ that way...  But, I haven&#39;t\nread 2616bis lately (really need to quit putting that off, now), so I\ncan&#39;t really comment on the issue, beyond pointing out that the Web\nturns a lot of HTTP&#39;s SHOULDs into MUSTs, for all intents and purposes.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
