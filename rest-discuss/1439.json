There is\n&gt; a URI representing the PowerPoint document. That is the level at which\n&gt; you can do network transactions. You can talk about individual slides\n&gt; using pointers into the slideshow, but that isn&#39;t a protocol/networking\n&gt; issue, because it has resolved completely on the &quot;client side&quot;.\n[...]\n&gt; I think you&#39;ve missed an important distinction. If the &quot;car&quot; has a\n&gt; representation that exposes all of the state of the window then yes, the\n&gt; window is &quot;on the Web&quot; despite the fact that it does not have its own\n&gt; URI. It can be addressed through a URI reference (e.g. URI+XPointer) But\n&gt; if you must POST a message to the car to ask *it* about the state of the\n&gt; window, then the window has neither a URI nor a URI refrence and it is\n&gt; not on the Web. If you cannot reference it with a Web address then I\n&gt; don&#39;t think it is on the Web.\n\nI&#39;m no Microsoft guru (Actually, I&#39;ve started using Windows as my primary\ndesktop for the first time, and I&#39;m less than pleased), but from what I&#39;ve\nseen there isn&#39;t a fragment identifier that can be used to identify a\nslide in a powerpoint show; the slides are not addressable.\n\nIf we assume that&#39;s the case (PDF is another format that can be\nsubstituted for the purposes of this discussion if it&#39;s not), one can put\na slide on the Web by making its parent slideshow available at a URI. I&#39;d\nsay that a reasonable interpretation of &quot;on the Web&quot; is &quot;available on the\nWeb&quot;; certainly more accurate than &quot;addressable on the Web.&quot;\n\nAddressability is a very important aspect of the Web, but let&#39;s not\nconfuse it with availability. Remember that resources are abstract, while\nrepresentations are concrete; when you use a URI reference, you&#39;re\nidentifying something concrete in the representation, not in the resource.\n\n\n&gt; No. At some point you are no longer interested in sending messages to\n&gt; objects and I would say that that&#39;s the point you stop decomposing. It\n&gt; isn&#39;t a judgement call. If you need to address something in a network\n&gt; transaction then the thing needs a URI.\n\nDetermining your level of interest in something isn&#39;t a judgement call?\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Back to SOAP (and hopefully a bit closer to reality), it&#39;s up to you\nas to\n&gt; &gt; what you expose in the URI interface. If you want it to be\ninteroperable\n&gt; &gt; with applications that need to reference different subresources, that\n&gt; &gt; would indicate the use of separate URIs. You can do this in any Web\n&gt; &gt; Services environment; the only question is how much pain you have to\nput\n&gt; &gt; up with to give different services different URIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you describe how to do this in any web service environments you\n&gt; are familiar with? Remember that an important requirement is that new\n&gt; resources will be created all of the time with no human interaction.\n\nI think it was noted before that this information is available in most\nenvironments; it&#39;s more a question of whether people will use it, and\nwhether they&#39;ll be encouraged to use it. I&#39;m somewhat hopeful that\nprogress can be made here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
