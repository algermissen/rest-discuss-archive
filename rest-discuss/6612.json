They have\n&gt; a lot of source information to work from when devloping a standard. They\n&gt; will only standardise encoding for information already widely published\n&gt; on the web, and only when several attempts have already been made to\n&gt; define content types for the information. Their process is then to\n&gt; cherry-pick the best fits to examples in the wild.\n&gt;\n&gt; A similar approach may be able to be taken by RESTafarians defining new\n&gt; content types. Using information available on the web may still be a\n&gt; viable way to collect samples. As to how these would fit with\n&gt; applications that need to use the type, well that would still be\n&gt; something of an unknown.\n\nI think you&#39;re mistakenly overstating the importance of the data\nformat in a RESTfull system.\n\nIt is important that the data format be self-describing in as much as\nyou need to be able to find out, from an entity you have recieved,\nwhat further entities you can get to and how. But no more than\nthat. REST is not for defining what an application does with data\noutside of interactions.\n\nA list of invoices might be represented in ATOM. But a list of\ntransactions might also be an ATOM list because ATOM can include\ncomplex data in the content element. \n\nIt&#39;s not a standard to represent invoices or transactions in this\nway. But it would work right? And there is no standard for lists of\ninvoices as far as I&#39;m aware (there probably is one for transactions).\n\n\nAnother advantage of REST (which Roy was drawing out) is that we don&#39;t\nalways need to rely on heavily standardized data formats. Often such\nformats are invented for particular operations (say B2B conversations)\nand are ill suited to the sort of light operations that many REST\ninteractions involve.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
