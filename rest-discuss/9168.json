Clearly XML has a grammar (referring to the first  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; meaning of &quot;semantics&quot;; the second meaning doesn&#39;t even apply).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You need to go back and look at what people mean by semantics.\n&gt;\n&gt; I still think your statement is wrong.\n\nMhh?\n\n&gt; Said differently, why do you state that XML has no semantics and  \n&gt; JSON does?\n\nI may be wrong with JSON having semantics. But this make the problem  \nof JSON just more acute.\n\nAs I understand JSON is a way of exchanging serialised JavaScript  \nobjects. As a result it would inherit the semantics of JavaScript. It  \nis popular because it is easy for Javascript to produce these  \nobjects, and easy for it to consume them. There must therefore be  \nsome meaning to the things sent over the wire. The string or the  \ninteger objects are well understood I imagine to have certain  \nproperties.\n\nBut it could be that JSON has no explicit semantics. This means that  \nthe consumer of the JSON will impart the implicit semantics on the  \nJSON. Ie: JSON is creating a tight binding between the consumer of  \nthe javascript code and the server producing it. This is bad because  \nit means that the meaning of the JSON list will be dependent on who  \npublishes it. So if I receive some code, and pass it on, or put it on  \na different server, the JSON will have a different meaning. The  \nserver could produce the same JSON, but change the client, and  \nthereby the meaning of the JSON could change completely. This is the  \nproblem of working without URI namespaces.\n\nXML has no explicit semantics, but RDF gives it one. The URI  \nnamespaces mean that the direct meaning of the document are  \nunderstood everywhere to be the same. Which is required for an open  \nspace of data.\n\nHenry\n\n"}}
