At some point I can publish them to make them public.\nAnd at any time I can toggle between draft or published mode.\n\nMy object model is very simple - articles have a method for each of\nthese actions.  article.publish and article.make_draft.  I don&#39;t know\nhow I can easily map those to resources.\n\nThe ways I&#39;ve thought of are\n  - expose the state, so that clients would do something like PUT\n/articles/1 with published=true or published=false\n  - create a new intermediate resource like versions\n\nI don&#39;t like either of those choices.  For the first one, my\ncontroller code would have to look at the incoming params, then see if\npublished=true, and if so call the publish method on the article.  The\nsecond choice has me creating resources where I don&#39;t really want any.\n All I want to do is map a HTTP request to an operation on my object\nmodel.\n\nPat\n\n"}}
