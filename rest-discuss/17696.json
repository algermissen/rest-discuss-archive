I&#39;m\n&gt; might be off here, but it seems like a smell where your object relationship semantics\n&gt; that hide behind your resource space are leaking on the client side. This knowledge\n&gt; is and should be hypermedia driven by the server. I might considering modeling the\n&gt; resource interaction differently.\n\nI don&#39;t think it is necessarily that the object semantics are leaking.\n It is extremely common to have resources be related to other\nresources.  Just think about the `a` tag in HTML.  These associations\nare not visible in representations as a result of a leaky abstraction,\nnor is the ability to modify relationships.  Allowing clients to\naccomplish resource relationship modification using the fundamental\nabstractions of REST style architectures is appropriate.\n\nCertainly there a many situations where using URIs is not necessary.\nHowever, if you ever try to integrate two or more systems you quickly\nrealize that URIs are the only way to identify resources that live in\nother systems.  Always using URIs to identify other resources, even if\nthey are currently housed the in the same system, has the advantage of\nrequiring less rework and less disruption to (not fully hypermedia\nbased) clients if some resources are ever relocated to a different\nsystem.\n\n&gt; Assuming that there is a need to construct these relationships on the client\n&gt; side using resource identities; I wonder how one might construct these\n&gt; resource identities and their representations (relative or absolute) given that\n&gt; they may be represented differently for different content types?\n\nOne should *not* be constructing resource identities on the client\nside.  Clients should use URIs that are well known, or that have been\nseen in the representations of other resources.  If the client needs\nto associate resource A with resource B, following the hypermedia\ninstructions in some representation is a very natural way to\naccomplish that.  For example, the client might &quot;see&quot; the appropriate\nrelationship `form` in B&#39;s representation, populate A&#39;s URI in the\nappropriate `input` in that form, and then submit the form.\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
