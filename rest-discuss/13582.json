This could\n&gt;&gt;&gt; roughly take one of two forms:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A set of specifications based on a range of technologies that focus on\n&gt;&gt;&gt; REST constraint compliance, or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. A more HTTP-centric set of specifications working on providing features\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not available on the Web and probably not consistent with REST constraints\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such as pub/sub, transactions, reliable POST, etc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Methinks a little from column A, and a little from column B.\n&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; These are all great points.  The output of REST-* is not meant to be an\n&gt;&gt; academic exercise.  We want to create specifications that can be implemented\n&gt;&gt; and solve specific problems.  While our goal is to be architecturally pure,\n&gt;&gt; software, in general, is very rarely architecturely pure when in its final\n&gt;&gt; form.  As a result, initial iterations (and even final ones) maybe a mix of\n&gt;&gt; both HTTP and REST-centric designs.  Remember, WE JUST STARTED!\n&gt; \n&gt; I know how you feel. The architectures I build at the moment are all\n&gt; real-time, so while REST is a template I have weakened statelessness\n&gt; and essentially substituted cache for pub/sub. This is actually\n&gt; changing over time and the architecture is just starting to come into\n&gt; closer alignment with REST as developers begin to understand that even\n&gt; in a real-time system poll+cache turns out to solve many problems\n&gt; better.\n&gt; \n\n&quot;...starting to come into closer alignment with REST.&quot;  Some of the \npeople that will be getting involved simply did a HTTP facade over \nexisting APIs (Transaction guy was one.  JBPM guys did another that \nwasn&#39;t published on REST-*.org).  These guys don&#39;t know anything about \nREST, ....YET....I need their help.  There is no possible way I can do \nall the work.  So initial submissions won&#39;t be perfect somebody guides \nthem in the right direction.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, I have a neat little HTTP-friendly pub/sub protocol that\n&gt; I&#39;m working at the moment to free from IP strictures within my\n&gt; organisation. I&#39;d love to talk to you guys about it.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m looking at pubsubhubub and webhooks as well for ideas.\n\n\n&gt; * Transitional HTTP: Breaks REST constraints in some way, probably by\n&gt; breaking statelessness of client/server.\n\nI definitely see that happening now and then.  Some things will be \nslightly RPCish as well until they can become refactored.  Sometimes I \nsee myself walking a very fine line when defining link semantics and \nthey seem to many times look RPCish.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; This, IMO, does not mean we should change the name of the site or to coin a\n&gt;&gt; new buzzword.  The goal we are striving for is to be RESTful. REST is our\n&gt;&gt; ideal.\n&gt; \n&gt; You understand, of course, that this is a subject that the REST camp\n&gt; are very touchy about :) Roy has stated his preference many times for\n&gt; new architectural styles to use their own names and not to try and\n&gt; reuse or redefine REST. Roy has also worked hard for many years to\n&gt; avoid REST the architectural style being confused with HTTP or the\n&gt; Web. Calling this REST-* is akin to renaming web services to SOA-* ;)\n&gt; The backlash you have already seen here I think is similar to what you\n&gt; could expect from that renaming.\n&gt; \n\nThe REST camp should be touchy.  They should be hostile.  We need \nskeptism.  I just hope that we get the acknowledgement when we do \nproduce something that is RESTful.\n\nBTW, I&#39;m starting to seem the same skeptism and hostileness from the \nWS-* crowd.  Well, specifically JJ, but I think REST is a swear word in \nJJ&#39;s dialect of French.\n\nIMO, this is all good.  Enterprise IT needs REST.  The WS-* guys need to \nrealize they need an architectural shift.\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
