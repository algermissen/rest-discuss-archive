That said, I must confess I need\nsome clarification on a few points (if the group will indulge me):\n\n1) Some material on REST seems to reserve POST for &quot;create&quot; and PUT\nfor &quot;update&quot; while others seem to blur the distinction.  Any insight\nhere would be most helpful.\n\n2) The writings seem to direct one away from using the query string as\nmuch as possible.  While it is clear that .../somecgi.pl?action=delete\nis most unREST-ful I assume .../invoice?id=3224 is OK to refer to\nparticular invoice (for example)?  I&#39;m confused by the apparent\nalternative URI to do the same thing .../invoice/3224  If the latter\nis preferable, why is that - especially when this seems to embody\n&quot;Common REST Mistake #3&quot;?  In short, when does one use the query\nstring versus the .../container/contained notation?\n\n3) Does seems REST assumes the user will create a URI parser from\nscratch?  The writings seem to call for a &quot;central xml file&quot; to do\nthis.  Do libwww-perl, Waterken, Cocoon, sqlREST enter in here? Could\nsomeone comment on this a bit more?\n\n4) I&#39;m unclear as how a PUT works.  If we take PUT to mean &quot;update&quot;\nthe resource, does one simply send the updated representation of the\nresource in a PUT request to the server?\n\nThanks a ton,\n\nT. Colvin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
