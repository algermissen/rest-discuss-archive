E.g. when you decide to turn each &quot;customer&quot;\n&gt; into its own identifiable resource - http://example.com/customers/1234\n&gt; - what does http://example.com/customers/{id} describe? Both &quot;resource\n&gt; class&quot; and &quot;resource type&quot; would work, but don&#39;t seem really convincing.\n\nAs other have pointed out, they&#39;re just &quot;resources&quot;, pretty much\ntypeless at the URI interface level. I&#39;m keen to know why you ask?\n\nMany years ago when I started getting into Topic Maps I learned that\nall things can be a topic (as a conceptual entity within a Topic Map),\nfrom the concrete to the abstract, to the existing to fantasy,\nanything. In Topic Maps there was a distinct separation between Topics\nand their many relationships with each other (Associations), so as I\ndeveloped Topic Maps systems I realised that I had created systems\nthat were decoupled from the interfaces, Topics and Associations\ndeserving their own entity definition. And all of this also applies to\nREST and resources, and this is why I love REST too; semantics of\noperation can stay minimal without the need for resources\n(GET,PUT,DELETE,POST,OPTIONS,PATCH) with actions upon typeless things\n(resources) where the state of the type is handled on the next\ninteraction layer (with responses).\n\nYour example of http://example.com/customers/1234 is just a resource.\nIts type can be _discovered_ but is typeless until you do so. And that\nis just so cool and underappreciated, especially by the SOAP/POX/CRUD\ngang. :)\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
