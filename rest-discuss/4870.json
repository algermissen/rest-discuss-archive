It&#39;s meaningless to say that the metadata and the binary image data\nare both &quot;representations&quot; of a single picture &quot;resource&quot;, though I know\nthat&#39;s a popular conception here.\n\nThe fundamental insight I take from REST as it relates to Web services is\nthat well-behaved Web services should feel a lot like well-behaved Web\nsites. A Web service is just a machine-readable Web application, and a Web\napplication is just a dynamic Web site. The principles of the Web\narchitecture that made it so successful apply to all three.\n\nSo how would you structure this picture library as a Web site? For each\npicture there would doubtless be an HTML page displaying the metadata\n(which I&#39;m assuming means title, author, etc.) with a hypertext reference\nto an image of the picture (either inline or as a clickable link). I&#39;d\nprobably give links to a few representations, but with different URLs\n(sunset.jpeg, sunset.png, sunset.gif), with a note of the size of each.  \nThere might even be a POST form to update the metadata. There would also\ndoubtless be an HTML index page containing hypertext references to the\npages for the various pictures, probably with a GET form to search for\npictures by metadata.\n\nJustin\n\nP.S. One of the reasons I like this list is that it&#39;s one of those rare\nplaces where I&#39;m not the most theoretical person. :)\n\n\nOn Tue, 22 Feb 2005, leighdodds2001 wrote:\n\n&gt; In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Michael Jakl &lt;mj@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since Picture and Picture-Metadata are closely connected, I&#39;m tempted\n&gt; &gt; to see &quot;Picture&quot; as the resource, and &quot;binary&quot; and &quot;XML/RDF&quot; as two\n&gt; &gt; different representations. The problem with this approach is that I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t address representations of a resource, only a resource. What\n&gt; &gt; would you suggest?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d agree that Picture is the resource and that there can be two\n&gt; representations, the binary images and the XML/RDF.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can use content negotiation (i.e. the Accept header) to retrieve\n&gt; alternate representations from the same URI. But that doesn&#39;t address\n&gt; your addressing requirements. I&#39;d meet that by either: parameterising\n&gt; the url, e.g:\n&gt; \n&gt; /pictures/124?format=rdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Or by making the metadata a sub-ordinate resource:\n&gt; \n&gt; /picture/124/metadata\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been leaning towards the latter approach lately, but I&#39;ve seen both\n&gt; in use and I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much to choose between them.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can do this and STILL support content negotiation though, so it&#39;s\n&gt; not either/or.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, and also don&#39;t forget that you can encode the XML/RDF inside the\n&gt; image itself too, just for completeness! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; HtH,\n&gt; \n&gt; L.\n&gt; --\n&gt; http://www.ldodds.com/blog\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
