Adding for instance http:// \napi.example.com/v1/users/fish/tags to the above mentioned &#39;API&#39;  \nwouldn&#39;t break any existing clients, although it could be argued to  \nbe a new version. For data formats, using XML should make it possible  \nto add elements and support more types of elements in without  \nbreaking old clients.\n\n(Note though that client might be doing lots of silly things such as  \njust iterating over your elements without checking the tag name at all)\n\n--\nStian Soiland, myGrid team\nSchool of Computer Science\nThe University of Manchester\nhttp://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ssoiland/\n\n\n\n"}}
