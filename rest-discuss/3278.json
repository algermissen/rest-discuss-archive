This resource\n&gt; creation often requires authentication. HTTP authentication, which is\n&gt; challenge-response, conflicts with this; if the user POSTs a\n&gt; relatively large resource entity and the server challenges, the entity\n&gt; is lost. What to do in this scenario? How are others solving this problem?\n\nFirst, the only reason you would lose the entity is if the client did not\nresend the POST request with the entity in response to the 401.  A few\nthoughts come to mind on how to get around the large entity problem (note\nthat I don&#39;t have a feel for the RESTfulness of these ideas):\n\n1) If the URI requires authentication regardless of the verb used, start\nwith a GET or HEAD to force authentication, returning a 204 (or something\nappropriate).  Afterwards, use POST.\n\n2) Variation on #1: have the GET return a unique URI that could be used for\na PUT such that the end result would be the same as a POST that returns the\nsame URI.\n\n3) Start by POSTing a small placeholder entity.  Once the new URI is\nreturned, use a PUT to set the resource as you actually want it to be.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
