It can be captured, copied, and replayed\nelsewhere. Cookie based approaches are just breaking the URI into two pieces\nand hoping that the Bad Guys don&#39;t capture both pieces. Since that is not\ndoable, people make one piece very transient, which only reduces the window\nof opportunity.\nNow that I think about it, using HTTPS would minimize the chance that other\npeople will find the cookie.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My first thoughts were that you could use HTTPS with client certs to\nprovide\n&gt; identity, but it seems that you&#39;ve only shifted the problem around.\nInstead\n&gt; of providing proof of identity with a cookie, your providing it with a\n&gt; certificate.  Or maybe using a cookie for authentication doesnt violate\nthe\n&gt; no-hidden-state rule.\n&gt;\nI think there is an interesting design question here regarding coordination\ncosts of establishing trust:\n - server provides tokens for identity\n - client provides tokens for identity\n\nI&#39;ll have to think about this for a while.\n\n\n\n"}}
