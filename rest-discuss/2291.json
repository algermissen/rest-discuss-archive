Are these ideas based on experience in some judicial\nsystem or another?  Or are they systems analysts views of where the\nauthoritative data in a transaction *ought to* be found?\n\nMy own opinion, based on judges and arbitrators I have faced in\ncontract matters, is that they want a context from which to judge\nwhat constitutes the contract in question, and they don&#39;t like\nother people constraining them in their judgment of how wide or\nnarrow that context should be.\n\nI think that judges and juries for that matter are interested in\nconversational state, not just in discrete &#39;stable states&#39; of a\nnegotiation.\n\nBut I&#39;ve never been to court over an electronic transaction, so my\nview may be totally uninformed.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 30, 2002 1:07 PM\n&gt; To: Paul Prescod\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Evidence\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll respond to all the other messages here ...\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 30, 2002 at 09:26:44AM -0700, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the stateless case, you could just take the offending \n&gt; message to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; court and leave everything else behind, because its meaning is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; independant of any conversation it may have been sent in.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You need the message plus all resources pointed to by the \n&gt; message. If\n&gt; &gt; the messages is &quot;Yes I agree to the contract at \n&gt; http://..../&quot; then you\n&gt; &gt; need http://.../ and you need it as it was at the time the \n&gt; message was\n&gt; &gt; sent (a good argument for signed, immutable resources in contractual\n&gt; &gt; contexts).\n&gt; \n&gt; No, I don&#39;t think you need representations of all the referenced\n&gt; resources, at least if you&#39;ve done it right.  Using that example, it\n&gt; would be a mistake to agree to a contract by reference, because the\n&gt; contract may change by the time the message is processed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rule is, if the meaning of the message depends upon the result of\n&gt; dereferencing a URI, then this is stateful and a bad thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; So while it would be fine to, say, send a list of contracts by URI\n&gt; for the simple purpose of enumerating them, it would not for the\n&gt; purpose of agreeing to them.  That&#39;s because in the former case, only\n&gt; their *identity* contributes to &quot;meaning&quot;, whereas in the \n&gt; latter, their\n&gt; *state* contributes to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\n&gt; Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\n&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
