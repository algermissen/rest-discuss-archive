Once you have received a specific message (indicated via the\n&gt; inbox), POST its URI to the URI of the mail resource you want it to be put\n&gt; in:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /mail/trash\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sample.invalid/mail/inbox/0013\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This would remove the link from the inbox and place it in the &quot;trash&quot;.  Of\n&gt; course, you could always just DELETE the URI directly if you were done with\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; At any rate, all you would ever have to do to check for mail would be to\n&gt; &quot;GET /mail/inbox&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Simple and clean... I think.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;S.
