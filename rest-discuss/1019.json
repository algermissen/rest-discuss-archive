However, if in a hyptertext representation of\nhttp://foo.com/bar/b I encounter &lt;a href=&quot;..&quot;&gt; I can infer --- indeed, the\nhypertext processor is being explicitly told --- that http://foo.com/bar/ is\na resource.  So my question is this:  what is special about hypertext and\nhypertext processors that they should be allowed to do this?  I&#39;m not\nsuggesting that this kind of inference is valid in the absence of explicit\ninformation, but I am wondering why the contract between client and server\nmust be markup.  There are cases where this is desirable, but there are cases\nwhere it is not.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s not clear to me what this means right now, but it is extra\n&gt; information that can be extracted from a URI that is unavailable in\n&gt; &quot;/&quot; based URI.  Who knows what neat stuff we might be forgoing in the\n&gt; future by not using it?\n\nIf I&#39;m parsing this correctly, then this is precisely the point I&#39;m making.\nThe axiom of opacity is vague and --- clearly, given the discussion we&#39;ve had\nabout it --- open to interpretation, even among smart folks who would work\nhard to do things &quot;the right way.&quot;  The problem is we may be throwing the\nbaby out with the bathwater.\n\nMy conclusion from looking at how the axiom is used and abused and the\nimplications of such abuse is that the real *technical* motivation for\nopacity is to allow (a) lexical equivalence testing by spiders, proxies,\nmapping systems, and so forth, and (b) canonical URI for resources.  This is\nall well and good and desirable, but a too-strict interpretation of the axiom\nironically encourages URI that do not achieve these goals.  It would be\nbetter to state these goals explicitly as axioms rather than state an\novergeneralization with paradoxical implications as an axiom.\n\n&gt; Also, a practical issue is that any web server I&#39;ve used typically\n&gt; makes it a lot easier to bind a chunk of code to query based URI than\n&gt; hierarchical based URI.\n\nWithout a doubt.  It&#39;s unfortunate that the very software that builds the\nmost powerful namespace in the world so completely fails to give us tools for\nusing that namespace in powerful, flexible ways.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
