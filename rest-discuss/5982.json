It seems that the two resources\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/alan.dean\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/lyle.kopnicky\n&gt;\n&gt; would share a lot in common.  The two pages probably share the same \n&gt; basic structure, with just some different details.  So by describing \n&gt; them with different URLs, we are not taking advantage of the cachability \n&gt; of that common structure.  How could we take advantage of the commonalities?\n&gt;\n&gt; You can&#39;t solve it by redirecting both to the same page - then you&#39;ve \n&gt; lost the uniqueness of that resource.  I guess one way to solve it is, \n&gt; that the page downloaded would be a sort of &quot;shell&quot; with JavaScript that \n&gt; downloaded the common features (e.g. page layout in HTML), and the \n&gt; customer-specific features (e.g. statement line items in XML), from \n&gt; different URLs, and then combined them.\n\nOr xml with an attached xslt. The look of the page is always the same\nbut the data is always different.\n\nThe xslt they utilized would be highly cached. The data would be less\ncached.\n\n\n&gt; It seems that REST, at least in the HTML context, relies heavily on \n&gt; client-side processing, like JavaScript.  It discourages server-side \n&gt; construction of pages.\n\nNot necessarily. In dynamic applications like this one yes it\ndoes. But javascript isn&#39;t the end of client side processing.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
