They may not be robust, they may be brittle to\nchange, but if the system is generally stable, for many cases, the\nclient pretty much works.\n\nSimilarly on the server side, a robust server is one that&#39;s sending\nwell design links and references, operates HTTP politely, &quot;knows&quot; it&#39;s\nold URLs so it can redirect to new URLs, etc. A simple server sends\nlittle more than 200s, 404s, and 500s. A simple server relies on URI\nconstruction, with no links.\n\nLong term, if the foundation is correct, a simple server can be\nreworked up to being a more complete REST server by tweaking it&#39;s\npayloads and including the proper links. Similarly, a simple client\ncan grow in sophistication and become a &quot;better&quot; client.\n\nBut you need a good server to have a good client. Trivial clients work\nwell with robust servers and crummy servers. A robust client won&#39;t\nwork as well with a trivial server, as the payload lack the\ninformation it requires.\n\nIn the end, the lifespan of the URIs are not important. An underlying\nassumption is simply that URIs WILL change, and there are mechanisms\nin place to deal with changing URIs.\n\nSo the real question isn&#39;t URI lifespan, it&#39;s leveraging and\nresponding well to the protocols already in place.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
