If one wants to do reliable POST, then using simple POST\n&gt; to get the IDs is probably a bit brain dead, eh?\n\nNot brain dead, it will work, as the point is you don&#39;t need a reliable \nsingle POST to start  a reliable exchange - reliability is introduced \nusing a sequence of requests and key for communicating shared state \n(HTTP is an asymmetric protocol, so it isn&#39;t possible to this in one \nstep anyway). If you request an ID and fail to get a response, then \nrequest again. The main thing is that the ID is not shared with other \nclients. Without that the server can&#39;t reason correctly about exchange \nstate.\n\n\n&gt; What I don&#39;t see yet is whether this &#39;overwriting&#39; of HTTP semantics\n&gt; is ok or bad or architecturally deadly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recall that WAKA might introduce &#39;Request Identifiers&#39;, is that\n&gt; something that could be used here? Would such identifiers be\n&gt; generated by the client and would re-POSTs use the same identifier?\n\nHTTPLR uses URLs to identify the message exchange (that is, the ids are \nURLs). That&#39;s for management reasons - you want to be able to \ndistinguish between the exchange state and what&#39;s being exchanged.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
