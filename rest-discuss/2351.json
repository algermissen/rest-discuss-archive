I&#39;d like to make the following \nsuggestions which will make Xoomle more RESTful and easier to use and \nintegrate with existing code.\n\n1) Actually, I was going to say you might want to expose an RMS \ndocument but nevermind. In the future though, you might want to \nconsider that there&#39;s a difference between the Google service (a \nsearch mechanism using the PageRank algorithm) and a Google service \nprovider (a URL that exposes the Xoomle API). If people have a Google \nappliance for their internal LAN or their desktop then you can have \nmany service providers providing the same service. You might also \nhave people exposing Google-like services on top custom data stores, \neg a database. For this reason, I would suggest modularizing your XML \nformat so Google-like services could add/remove search metadata and \nsemantics. \n\n2) Please don&#39;t use XML-based errors. It&#39;s very annoying to go \nthrough all the trouble of parsing an XML document just to discover \nit contains no useful information. HTTP has a rich set of built in \nresponse codes you should use. Particularly, I would suggest the \nfollowing:\n    \n    2.1) If a search or spelling suggest does not return any results \nthen the Xoomle service should return the &quot;HTTP 204 No Content&quot; \nstatus code. If you want to specify the type of error, include an URL \nin the &#39;Location&#39; header which the client can use to determine the \nbasic type \neg &#39;www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/types/errors/NoKeySpecified&#39;. \nOnly if the error contains rich information do you need to provide an \nXML document describing the error. (Most of errors I think, don&#39;t \ncontain rich information they&#39;re of the sort like &#39;Phrase not \nspecified&#39; so this should save you and me both some work). Similarly, \nHTTP defines error codes like &#39;HTTP 503 Service Unavailable&#39; for \nexample to indicate that Xoomle can&#39;t contact Google. Really, 90% of \nthe time I don&#39;t care what type of error happened, I just need to \nknow that there was an error.\n\n    2.2) Similarly, the behavior you expose tends to be made \nredundant by HTTP. For example, your method doGetCachedPage simply \nreturns the HTML of the cached page straight from google. Rather than \ndoing this, I&#39;d suggest issuing an HTTP Redirect to the client so \nthey can retrieve the cached page themselves.\n\n\n3) This is trivial but I don&#39;t really see the need for the top-level \nXML element &#39;doGoogleSearchResponse&#39; since that&#39;s a bit verb-like. \nHaving &#39;GoogleSearchResult&#39; as the root seems cleaner to me. Also, \nsince XML is case-sensitive and since ppl will be writing xslts to \nhandle Xoomle responses I&#39;d suggest being consistent with your naming \nconvention. Since you&#39;re using camel-casing it seems \nlike &#39;GoogleSearchResult&#39; should be &#39;googleSearchResult&#39;.\n\nAlso I have a few questions:\n\n1) How do I pass the &#39;site:&#39; restriction to Xoomle? Is this just \nsomething the Google SOAP api forbids?\n\n2) Is there any way to expose the directories offered by the Google \nDirectory?\n\n3) Can you explain more about how max results work? \n\n4) What do the plain-text spelling suggestions response look like? \nAre you sure you don&#39;t want to return an XML document instead?\n\n\nAll in all, this is a great service and looks like it could be very \nuseful to develop apps on top of Google. Keep up the good work!\n\n- itdp\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., &quot;borkazoid&quot; &lt;beau@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; just thought you might be interested that a new version of XooMLe \n&gt; (XML interface to the Google API) has been uploaded to the live \n&gt; server now. You can get more information from \n&gt; http://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/ or jump straight to the \n&gt; documentation at http://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/docs/\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, the modifications are;\n&gt; \n&gt;  - proper support for directories\n&gt;  - added a &quot;relatedInformation&quot; element if there is any available\n&gt;  - added an xlink attribute to relatedInformation and cachedVersion\n&gt;  - bugfixes (especially on looping and maxResults &gt; 10)\n&gt;  - ability to specify an XSLT stylesheet using the &quot;xsl&quot; \nquerystring \n&gt; variable, which allows you to do on-the-fly formatting\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if you are interested, XooMLe will feature in an upcoming \n&gt; O&#39;Reilly book which is still being written. At this stage, I think \nit \n&gt; is called &quot;Google Hacks&quot;, it&#39;s about the things that people have \ndone \n&gt; with the Google API since it was released, and should be a pretty \n&gt; good read :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, and thanks to everyone for their suggestions and feedback \non \n&gt; XooMLe, please kep it coming if you have any more ideas for making \nit \n&gt; more RESTful (or just more useful!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Beau\n&gt; (from DentedReality)\n\n\n"}}
