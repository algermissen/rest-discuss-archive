This does bring up the question of whether REST is common sense or not\n(I know that&#39;s not what Walden was actually saying).  After all this time, I\nstill have trouble grasping some parts of REST (and still disagree with\nother parts).  From discussions on this list and others, I&#39;m not sure that\nanyone short of Fielding &quot;totally gets it&quot; (though I could certainly be\nwrong;  apologies to those folks).  For those who are steeped in REST, it\nwould be common sense.  But to the rest of the world, I feel that REST is\nanything but common sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the paradigm of SOAP treating the Internet like a big LAN\ndoes fall under the category of &quot;common sense&quot;.  Most technical and\nnon-technical people immediately understand what that means.  Many of those\npeople can conceptualize it with little effort.  Does it mean that it&#39;s the\nbest way to go?  Not necessarily.  But the masses (those that make of the\n&quot;common&quot; sense; Dave Winer included) certainly seem to think so.  Heck, I\neven see the simplicity and appeal to that model.\n\nAdmittedly, I also see the issues involved as well, which is what got me\ninterested in REST to begin with.  While I can see how REST can help resolve\nsome of the issues, it is far from clear to me how it will solve all of the\nissues.  I think the reason is that REST just doesn&#39;t make sense overall.\nAnd as long as REST is not considered to be common sense, it will have\nlimited acceptance.  I don&#39;t see it becoming common sense any time soon,\nesp. when so few actually seem to grasp what it is.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
