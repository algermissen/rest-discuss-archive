They allow you to mode=\r\nl your\napplication in terms of resources and links, and will make your app\n=\r\nconsumable from a number of open source libraries. You can read more\nabout =\r\nthem here if you are interested:\n\nhttp://blog.stateless.co/post/13296666138=\r\n/json-linking-with-hal\nhttp://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\n\nCheers,\n=\r\nM\n\nOn Tue, May 29, 2012 at 2:23 PM, Kristian Rink &lt;kawazu428@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Folks;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am at the moment into trying to choose a data forma=\r\nt / representation\n&gt; to use for building a RESTful web service which should=\r\n allow for reading\n&gt; and writing resources, which should be accessible usin=\r\ng &quot;standard&quot; tools\n&gt; as well as using a dedicated programming API and which=\r\n should as much as\n&gt; somewhat possible rely upon existing open standards.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; After doing some reading, I came across Atom and APP as it seems in many=\r\n\n&gt; possible ways provide sane and stable solutions for problems at hand\n&gt; (=\r\nincluding things like &quot;workspaces&quot;, &quot;feeds&quot;, &quot;entries&quot;, dealing with\n&gt; serv=\r\nice and category descriptions, dealing with textual and binary\n&gt; content, d=\r\nealing with extensibility and stuff like OpenSearch and the\n&gt; like).\n&gt;\n&gt; In=\r\n many ways, so far it seems the perfect match, however it right now\n&gt; (at l=\r\neast for me) suffers from a particular shortcoming: I am not really\n&gt; sure =\r\nwhether it&#39;s a technology or a standard to &quot;last&quot;. Doing some\n&gt; reading on =\r\nthat, I rather quickly stumbled across articles pointing out\n&gt; that &quot;AtomPu=\r\nb has failed&quot; and &quot;AtomPub is basically dead&quot;, suggesting\n&gt; that everyone e=\r\nlse uses JSON based REST services right now, eventually\n&gt; pointing out that=\r\n even the Google GData services are considered &quot;legacy&quot;\n&gt; and replaced by d=\r\nifferent approaches right now. On the other hand I\n&gt; don&#39;t really see what =\r\ncould replace Atom or especially AtomPub talking\n&gt; about providing a given =\r\ndata structure, a data and service semantics to\n&gt; allow for read/write inte=\r\nractions with a service in a somewhat sane,\n&gt; standard way.\n&gt;\n&gt; So to ask: =\r\nIf you were about to start a new RESTful project supposed to\n&gt; work with ex=\r\nisting &quot;standard&quot; tools, what kind of data representation\n&gt; would you choos=\r\ne? Would you still go for Atom / AtomPub? Would you\n&gt; rather use some kind =\r\nof JSON+HTTP? Something completely else?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any inpu=\r\nt,\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
