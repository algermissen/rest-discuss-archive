While\n&gt; this may be a practial way of sidestepping the development of discovery\n&gt; and representation techniques, it limits the applicability and\n&gt; extensibility of the solution. It appears the authors of the\n&gt; specification were not able to wait for that development to take place.\n&gt; There is some justification to proceeding on the basis WebDAV did, given\n&gt; that the practical application of this metadata discover on the web is\n&gt; still an immature technology base at best today. Still, it is an\n&gt; incomplete solution and one that should not be held too far aloft as an\n&gt; example to others. It violates the Roy&#39;s principle that every resource\n&gt; needs an identifier. Metadata is data, which needs a resource, which\n&gt; needs an identifier. WebDAV replaces the use of an identifier with the\n&gt; use of additional verbs. That&#39;s a no-no.\n\nYes.\n\n\n&gt; The fact that an alternate solution is not yet really well established\n&gt; indicates two things to me:\n&gt; 1) A solution is not required for the 80% case. We will continue to do\n&gt; fine on the web with fairly ad hoc solutions and approaches where\n&gt; required.\n&gt; 2) The industry is still getting a handle on what this metadata stuff is\n&gt; all about and what it is supposed to do, anyway. The definitions we tend\n&gt; to have for it are too wide to nail down into anything useful, and\n&gt; anything practially useful is not general enough to really satisfy.\n\nIf I needed lots of &quot;meta data&quot; about resources for a REST based\nwebservice I&#39;d make an RDF view of the resource and either make that a\nrepresentation of the resource to be accessed through content neg or\nuse a header to indicate the location of the &quot;meta data&quot; resource.\n\nIf I need a small amount of &quot;meta data&quot; I just put it in an extension\nheader.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
