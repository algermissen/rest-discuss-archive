The first is its HTTP \n&gt; heritage with headers, status codes, etc. (and is under-appreciated or \n&gt; misunderstood, hence things like SOAP).  The second, though, is a design \n&gt; paradigm like OO that prescribes how state and transitions are captured \n&gt; in representations that are exchanged during the request-response \n&gt; pattern.  Tim&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot; moment was about the second.\n\nIt&#39;s solely the second.\n\nThe first part is how it does that, and the decisions as to how they \nwork (e.g. which pieces of information we do and do not put in headers) \ncomes entirely from how well that lets us do the second.\n\nWhile HTTP predates REST, REST was developped by examining HTTP and \nseeing what worked and what needed fixing in version 1.1. Again my \nanalogy with a programmer learning a design pattern s/he has already \nused works here too. It&#39;s hence not correct to talk of the HTTP matters \nas being part of REST&#39;s heritage, IMO, but more accurate to describe \nthese HTTP matters as being determined by following REST, albeit \nretroactively.\n\n\n"}}
