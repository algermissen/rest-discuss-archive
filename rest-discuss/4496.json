I saw that error when I hit send, but I thought the\npoint would come accross without a corrective note ;-)\n\n&gt; The Host header has to be the host name of the destination server, not\n&gt; the host name of intermediary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was surprised by this because I assumed that Host behaved like a\n&gt; hop-by-hop header and was just there to add back the host information\n&gt; that sending the request via TCP/IP had stripped out.\n&gt; \n&gt; So although it is required, the Host header in a proxy request doesn&#39;t\n&gt; actually do anything at all, especially as it is the responsibility of\n&gt; the intermediary to rewrite it when it forwards the request anyway\n&gt; (also 14.23).\n&gt; \n&gt; One effect of this is that intermediaries require an IP address\n&gt; because they can&#39;t rely on DNS-based virtual hosting.\n\nYes, a single server-application can only act as a single proxy. You\ncannot use different locations on the same host/port to invoke\ndifferent proxies...\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Presumably it is like this so that if an HTTP/1.0 intermediary\n&gt; forwards the Host header to a HTTP/1.1 destination host without\n&gt; rewriting it, the destination host doesn&#39;t reject the request for\n&gt; having an incorrect Host header.\n\n&gt; --\n&gt; Dave\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
