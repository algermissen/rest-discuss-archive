This isn&#39;t, the scenario where it doesn&#39;t give a 403 isn&#39;t either.\n\n&gt; One of the key\n&gt; points to the web is that it is so explorable, and by exploring, the\n&gt; user *will* make judgement upon the URL he/she tries out. I always\n&gt; gets a bit annoyed at your scenario above; it means someone has missed\n&gt; opportunities and broken the usability of the web. *Technically*\n&gt; nothing is buggy or broken, but I still regard it as broken or buggy\n&gt; by *design*.\n\n\nThat assumes not only that implementation factors made that feasible, or \ndidn&#39;t just make it too hard to work nicely, but that \nhttp://www.examplenet/a/b/ could be reasonably represented AND that that \nrepresentation is one you would want the user to see (not always the \ncase by a long shot).\n\nI do like it when http://www.examplenet/a/b/ works. I do try to make \nhttp://www.examplenet/a/b/ work when applicable, but it&#39;s not always \ngoing to.\n\nThis is on top of the fact that such structuring of URIs meets a \ndifferent set of criteria to others that have to be met to work well \nwith the web. Using both is the ideal, but arguing that it&#39;s a matter of \none versus the other is bogus.\n\n\n"}}
