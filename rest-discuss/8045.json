I \n&gt; agree with what seems to be the majority here that the \n&gt; &quot;froth&quot; of multiple competing implementations is good in that \n&gt; it encourages innovation and enables multiple tools focused \n&gt; on different needs, but it can also confuse the marketplace. \n&gt; For example, Python has a bunch of web frameworks that \n&gt; compete. Ruby, by contrast, has Rails, which dominates so \n&gt; much that you don&#39;t hear about any other Ruby web framework. \n\nThanks for recognizing this. (Sorry for the late reply, I just found this\nemail; need to update my inbox rules...)\n\nYou explained it far more succinctly than I was able to. \n\n&gt; I think that actually helps promote Ruby over Python to some \n&gt; extent. So even though froth is good in general, there is a tradeoff.\n\nExactly, and as I have been trying to decide [1] on a new programming\nlanguage, *everything* points me to Python *except* that lack of critical\nmass around any one framework.  I look at Rails and, though I don&#39;t like the\nlanguage or the &#39;religious ferver&#39; of the Rails adherents, I see how almost\neveryone using Ruby seems to be supporting Rails and recognize the huge\nbenefits that has.  \n\nIn an similar manner, if REST ends up with tens of incompatible frameworks\nfor each language it will become the Python to SOAP&#39;s Ruby on Rails; the\nbetter way but with so many incompatible solutions it will gain far less\ntraction than it deserves.  \n\nJMTCW anyway.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n[1] http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/onthehuntforanewprogramminglanguage\n\n\n\n\n"}}
