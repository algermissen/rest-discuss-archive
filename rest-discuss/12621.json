One of the best I&#39;ve seen. I have a small quibble\nwith your suggesting that NOUNS should be unconstrained, but other than\nthat, its wonderful.

Constrained vocabularies of nouns is overall a good thing.\nSometimes its called reference data, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies,\nauthorities, codes, master data, enumerations, etc. In web terms, its the\nprinciple that resources should have as few aliases as possible.
