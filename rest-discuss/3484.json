How do\n&gt; you go about, in a RESTful manner, returning different representations of\n&gt; the same resource when those representations have the same content-type?\n&gt; Admittedly, this is not a common case these days, but I think such a\n&gt; scenario will become more frequent.\n&gt;\n&gt; As mentioned in a couple posts, a common technique is to use a query string\n&gt; to distinquish.  Another technique is to treat the variants as a sort of\n&gt; sub-resource.  Both of these techniques have their advantages and\n&gt; disadvantages.  However, the one disadvantage they both have is that they\n&gt; are in no way standardized across implementations.  For instance, Jeff\n&gt; Bone, Joe Gregorio, and I use different query strings for serving up RSS.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the nice things about MIME types is that they are &quot;standardized&quot;,\n&gt; hence the Accept header.  But that is course-grained.  For instance, there\n&gt; is no way using Accept: to indicate whether the client wants to receive RSS\n&gt; 0.91 or RSS 2.0.  Sure, we could register more and more content-types, but\n&gt; that seems like a nightmare (though I gather some work is being done to\n&gt; address such a problem).\n\nActually this is possible, and standardized if rss would be a registered \nmime-type [1] with version as an optional attribute. It seems as if rss is \nnot registered.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So what is a RESTful app to do?\n\nActually i think most of the underpinnings for this already exist in the\nHTTP specification [1] and mime-type standards. A content type may\ncontain optional attributes (version/level etc). If you look at the\nmime-type [2] of xml-xhtml you can see they they have the optional\nattribute &#39;profile&#39;. Also you have the accept-quality &#39;q&#39; parameter in an\naccept clause and thus write:\n\nAccept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7,  application/xhtml+xml;q=1.0\n\nor even:\n\nAccept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7,  application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9, \napplication/xhtml+xml;profile=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd&quot;\n;q=0.9\n\nThe &#39;only&#39; remaining problem is that few mime-types define optional parameters\nand even fever user-agents send them. But if you use your own internal \nmime-types and/or other mime-types with optional attributes defined and \ncontrol both client and server end then you can go right ahead and use\nthis syntax. Actually at some points in time html supported level\nand version but they&#39;ve been removed since nobody used them.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n\n[1]\nhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html\n[2] \nhttp://www.rfc-editor.org/cgi-bin/rfcdoctype.pl?loc=RFC&letsgo=2616&type=ftp&file_format=txt\n[3] \nhttp://www.rfc-editor.org/cgi-bin/rfcdoctype.pl?loc=RFC&letsgo=3236&type=ftp&file_format=txt\n\n/Mikael Andersson\n\n"}}
