I was just \n&gt; saying that &quot;self des=\r\ncription&quot; metadata isn&#39;t going to be used by a \n&gt; large set of clients.\n&gt; \n=\r\n\nI would argue that if a client doesn&#39;t need this &quot;metadata&quot; then it&#39;s not =\r\na RESTful system. This would imply that the client was too closely bound to=\r\n the URI structure of the server and/or server-specific data types. Some so=\r\nrt of metadata about the link (if its not a straight GET/PUT/DELETE of the =\r\nverbatim link) is necessary to map information from the client&#39;s domain to =\r\nthe server&#39;s interface.\n\nSpecifically, on your point earlier in the thread:=\r\n\n\n&gt;My point was that transmitting a &quot;form&quot; (quotes) is usually not useful\n&gt;=\r\nto a machine-based client as the &quot;discovery&quot; phase happened when the\n&gt;progr=\r\nammer coded the client.\n\nThis goes against the principles of REST. There is=\r\n no service discovery phase that occurs during coding. The client is coded =\r\nagainst the uniform interface. e.g. URI + HTTP + Hypermedia Format (+ Link =\r\nRelations). A web browser works with any HTTP server that serves back HTML.=\r\n A CCXML client (again, which is machine driven) works with any HTTP server=\r\n that serves back CCXML -- the server could be implementing a conferencing =\r\nservice, or a service to locate the callee on multiple phones, or whatever.=\r\n The CCXML client doesn&#39;t care, it just executes the CCXML, just as a web b=\r\nrowser just executes the HTML.\n\nThere&#39;s no &quot;server-specific form types&quot; in =\r\nthe uniform interface, or it wouldn&#39;t be uniform. The hypermedia format is =\r\nnot specific to a service. If anything, it&#39;s specific to a type of client. =\r\nHTML is specific to (primarily visual) data presentation & interaction clie=\r\nnts. VoiceXML is specific to aural data presentation & interaction clients.=\r\n CCXML is specific to call control clients. Any of these hypermedia clients=\r\n could interact with any number of services that return data in the client&#39;=\r\ns hypermedia format. A single service, via conneg, can interact with variou=\r\ns types of client. The client and server are not coupled to each other at a=\r\nll.\n\nIMO, the most common mistake is to design a format specifically for yo=\r\nur service -- that&#39;s not RESTful as it always results in coupling. The tric=\r\nk is designing a hypermedia format for the client domain you wish to target=\r\n (if no such format already exists -- if one exists, you should just use it=\r\n). A client that is coded to work with that format is not bound to any one =\r\nservice.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
