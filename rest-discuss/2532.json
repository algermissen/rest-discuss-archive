Or does\nhe mean that once a resource is born, it always exists, even\nafter it&#39;s been deleted?\n\nI think it must be the latter, else we have to ask what the\nmeaning of &quot;Created&quot; is in response to some PUT or POST.\n\nAs an implementation detail, it may be difficult for server software\nto keep track of all deleted resources that may have once existed,\ngiven that resource space is effectively infinite.\n\nIf someone does a DELETE on a resource that has never existed,\nshould the server discriminate that case against the case of a\ndeleted resource?  I don&#39;t think so...\n\nPerhaps a better way to think of it is thus:  DELETE is idempotent\nin the sense that it describes an end-state of a resource, not\na method.  So, the existence of a resource is not an important\npre-condition for DELETE.  A 200 response to DELETE always means\n&quot;okay, it&#39;s not mapped (now)&quot;.  And who cares how we got to that\nstate.\n\nWalden\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 13, 2002 9:25 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] [fielding@...: Re: Resources always\n&gt; exist]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So it looks like DELETE should not return 404.
