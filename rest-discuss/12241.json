I found two\npo=\r\nrtions of your reply particularly helpful:\n\n&lt;snip&gt;If you are interested in =\r\navoiding the myriad problems which\narise from developing an application  th=\r\nat ignores REST, then don&#39;t\nbreak the uniform interface constraint.&lt;/snip&gt;\n=\r\nIs it correct for me to assume that the &quot;uniform interface&quot; of which\nyou sp=\r\neak is that outlined in RFC2616 only? If not, what other sources\ndo you con=\r\nsider viable as part of the &quot;uniform interface?&quot;\n\nand\n\n&lt;snip&gt; Unless you wa=\r\nnt it to scale, in which case the importance of\n&quot;visibility&quot; far outweighs =\r\nthe disadvantage of not having\nbatch-processing capability.&lt;/snip&gt;\nI am unc=\r\nlear on your use of &quot;visibility&quot; here. Are you referring only\nto the values=\r\n passed as HTTP Methods (and the defined behaviors for\nthem)? Are the other=\r\n meta data items (HTTP Headers) that you consider\npart of visibility? For e=\r\nxample, if in my hypothetical case a large\ncommunity (hundreds of servers, =\r\nthousands of clients) shared an\nunderstanding of the methods I mentioned an=\r\nd the metadata does this\nhave any impact on your consideration of this exam=\r\nple?\n\nFinally, it is not the case that I am not ...&quot;concerned about any of\n=\r\nthe problems that REST solves...&quot; If that were true, I would not have\nposed=\r\n my question here. Also, I am not trying to &#39;make a case&#39; for\nperforming ba=\r\ntch work over HTTP, nor am I attempting to convince\nanyone of the validity =\r\nof this hypothetical case. Feel free to\nquestion my understanding of Fieldi=\r\nng&#39;s dissertation, but not my\nsincerity in learning from it and implementin=\r\ng its REST principles\nproperly.\n\nThanks again for your reply.\n\nmca\nhttp://a=\r\nmundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 18, 2009 at 17:48, Eric J.

Such a=\r\nn assumption cannot be safely\n&gt; made when the system runs openly on the Int=\r\nernet. Anarchic scalability\n&gt; refers to the need for architectural elements=\r\n to continue operating\n&gt; when they are subjected to an unanticipated load, =\r\nor when given\n&gt; malformed or maliciously constructed data, since they may b=\r\ne\n&gt; communicating with elements outside their organizational control.
