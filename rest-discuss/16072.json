T=\r\nhe latter is\n&gt; mitigated by allowing clients to consume a &#39;discovery&#39; docum=\r\nent that\n&gt; describe the resources available and their URIs. I note that per=\r\nformance\n&gt; is not an explicit goal of REST, but as things stand today I wou=\r\nld\n&gt; prefer the option of discovery than throwing out the system benefits o=\r\nf\n&gt; REST. Fwiw, a forms document fits in my notion of discovery.\n&gt; \n\nOn fat=\r\n formats -- I hear you but at the same time, the SIP/IMS standards that are=\r\n poised for LTE make use of some fairly fat formats (e.g. PIDF for presence=\r\n etc). The solution there seems to be conpression (e.g. compressed bodies a=\r\nnd SigComp, etc.) and there&#39;s a lot of momentum there -- it doesn&#39;t seem to=\r\n be holding things up. Is this really a barrier to REST?\n\nOn the discovery =\r\ndoc -- are non-HTML, REST approaches really wasting that much on traversal?=\r\n e.g. There&#39;s not a lot of traversal in AtomPub compared to an HTML-based w=\r\neb site. It seems that the wastefulness here it more about UX than somethin=\r\ng fundamental to HATEOAS. I would imagine that for m2m REST you could optim=\r\nize the traversal to the minimum interactions required for the workflow no?=\r\n Can an up-front discovery doc really make it better? Even if you had say a=\r\n URI template up front, you&#39;d likely need to &quot;traverse&quot; a few resources to =\r\nget the parameter values needed to make a request. If not, then I&#39;d imagine=\r\n the first page of the service would normally offer the link/form anyways. =\r\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\n&gt; Finally push is very useful for mobile but that is o=\r\nutside REST&#39;s design\n&gt; goals. I suspect there are some concepts from ARREST=\r\nED  or P2P that may\n&gt; be useful in mobile systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n\nPush is a b=\r\nig issue -- polling of any sort (even long polling or COMET) is problematic=\r\n in mobile. I am hopeful that this ID https://wiki.tools.ietf.org/html/draf=\r\nt-roach-sip-http-subscribe-07 becomes a good way to receive notifications o=\r\nf HTTP resource changes over an LTE network. While the SIP side isn&#39;t exact=\r\nly REST, bridging the two worlds with a simple Link header integrates well =\r\nwith the web I think.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
