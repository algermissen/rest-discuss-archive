Similarly, in other aspects \n&gt; of the web we have &quot;Web2.0&quot; which, as far as I can see, is the radical \n&gt; notion that the technology we&#39;ve all been using for over 15 years might \n&gt; actually work and maybe we should just use it rather than trying to win \n&gt; the glory of being the person who fixes it.\n\nHear!
