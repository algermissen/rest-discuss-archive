Having looked at OpenSearch, it&#39;s not very clear to me where it shows a walk through from the initial URL request all the way through an example. I did however see the response they return includes &lt;url..&gt; elements with a type=&quot;...&quot; that explains the media type for that resource. So I am unclear as to why what I am doing is incorrect.\n\nDid not say it was incorrect - I only said that you seem to think in too complicated terms.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry Jan, but your responses don&#39;t seem to help much unfortunately. If anything, they confuse me even more.\n\nWhat about OpenSearch description and Atom Service documents? These should explain things pretty well.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve responded on several occasions that it&#39;s all about the media types, yet when I ask you how a response that returns with different resources that can be used would instruct a non-human machine on what media type to use when using the resource, I don&#39;t get a clear cut example or response.\n\nThat is because at least I do not really understand what you are looking for. What do you mean by &quot;what media type to use when using the resource&quot;, for example.\n\n&gt; Specifically I am trying to understand how either a human or a machine can make use of one of potentially several different resources it receives from a previous request, and properly set the Content-Type to the right media type when making the request to the resource.\n\nWhich Content-Type? Do you mean the Accept header? Clients should put in there those types they understand and that they think make sense for the given request (use Firebug to trace what FireFox is doing as an example).\n\n&gt; If my response returns five different resources that a machine/client can use, and I don&#39;t specify media types that are to be set to use those resources, they can&#39;t just know it.\n\nSo what? The type attributes are only hints anyway, not guarantees.\n\n&gt; There has to be a way a machine could discover the right media type to use with no prior info on the resource.\n\nIt is simple: use those you understand. You will only find out when the request is made which type you actually got.\n\n&gt; If I upgrade my server and add three new resources, the machine/client should be able to use them simply by the &lt;link..&gt; info returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having read several articles/blogs on the subject, along with many threads here, I am simply not digesting the initial published URL request/response.. what the response might look like.\n\nAtomPub service doc, opensearch description doc.... But any other bookmarkable enry state is fine, too. You can use Amazon even if the first interaction is a product page and not the home page, eh?\n\n&gt; If you could be so kind as to provide an example of what a response might look like for a simple webcart service, or some other service, that might offer a few sub-services initially, that would be most beneficial. Prior to all this HATEOAS stuff, I simply provided a SDK document with info on the resources, what they accepted, what they may return, what they were used for. Now it seems the REST/HATEOAS way is to not provide that sort of document, instead just publish a single URL and the client can learn what is possible simply by making a request to this one URL. So throw me a bone here would ya.. don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s about the media types..I know this.. show me with a simple snippet and some info on the makeup of the response or something to better illustrate this.\n\nDesign you media types so that a client can persue its goals from any possible entry point. Amazon for example tells you where you can search on *every* page, not just the home page. So you need not go back to the home page to enter a new search.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
