Thus I would suggest\n&gt; going for the latter instead of a query parameter approach.\n\nThere is a slight  technical difference in the absence of header&#39;s \nspecifying cacheabilty, in that the former is by default not cacheable \nbut the latter is.\n\nThe distinction is just one for compatibility with implementations which \nused query strings for unsafe, non-idempotent operations with GET and is \nstrictly speaking a matter outside of REST concerns generally and merely \nan implementation matter concerning HTTP. The distinction also \ndisappears entirely once explicit cacheability information is sent.\n\nHowever, while I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m nit-picking, it can crop up as a \npractical concern, so it is worth remembering.\n\n\n"}}
