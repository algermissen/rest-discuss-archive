I am not quite sure I understand the flow of things=\r\n\ntho. If I publish a URI to my service I\nhave something like http://myservi=\r\nce.com/webcart as the URI.

I am trying to figure out =\r\nhow I start up my service\nSDK that I&#39;ll publish on my site to help develope=\r\nrs get started using\nmy public service.\n\n\n\nRegardless.. I assume the respon=\r\nse would be some sort of list of links\nthat can be called?

GET, POST, PUT and=\r\n DELETE. Does my SDK doc say &quot;if rel is EDIT\nthen you can PUT to that URI. =\r\nIf it is SELF then you can only GET to\nthat URI&quot;? or is there another attri=\r\nbute that lists the allowed methods on the URI of each link?
