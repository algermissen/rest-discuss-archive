I have one  \n&gt; &gt; part of my d=\r\nesign right now where I&#39;m unsure what a good RESTful  \n&gt; &gt; approach would b=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some part=\r\ns  \n&gt; &gt; that clients are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; uncommon case; I would think that navigation links, for example,  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; would typically not be modifiable in a PUT.) So is it better to:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n1. Require clients to submit all the read-only parts unmodified in a  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPUT, and respond with an error code if they are absent or altered?\n&gt; &gt; 2. T=\r\nake advantage of the leniency allowed in a server&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; implementation of=\r\n PUT to ignore the read-only elements (or their  \n&gt; &gt; absence)?\n&gt; &gt; 3. Sepa=\r\nrate read-only elements into a sub-resource that only  \n&gt; &gt; supports GET? (=\r\nThis may not be feasible for resources which must be  \n&gt; &gt; created as a who=\r\nle.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; or something else?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second, there are some elements tha=\r\nt are modifiable or not depending  \n&gt; &gt; on the privileges held by the (auth=\r\nenticated) user. I would think  \n&gt; &gt; this would be expressed by a differenc=\r\ne in the representation  \n&gt; &gt; returned to the client, but what should that =\r\ndifference be? (My  \n&gt; &gt; representations are XML documents, if there isn&#39;t =\r\na more general  \n&gt; &gt; solution.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And in a broader sense, I&#39;d like th=\r\ne client to know which elements  \n&gt; &gt; of the resource the user can modify, =\r\nfor presentation purposes. Is  \n&gt; &gt; there a generally accepted way to do th=\r\nis, perhaps with form  \n&gt; &gt; templates or XForms?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be interested =\r\nin any comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m  \n&gt; &gt; just looking at it =\r\nfrom the wrong angle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  -- Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
