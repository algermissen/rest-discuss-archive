And where &quot;label&quot; is one of those subcategory sorts of\n&gt; things, not a tag that entries can have none or a dozen of. Deleting a\n&gt; blog requires deleting its labels, deleting a label requires deleting\n&gt; its threads, deleting a thread requires deleting its entries. (What\n&gt; you probably DON&#39;T want to get into is accepting PUTs.\n\nIf I understand you right you mean that there could be a uri of \nhttp://example.net/catX/blogY/labelZ/threadα/entryβ and one of\nhttp://example.net/catX/blogY/labelZ/threadα/ and one of \nhttp://example.net/catX/blogY/labelZ/ and so on.\n\nThis is all well and good - indeed I highly recommend these sorts of \nhierarchical URIs.\n\nHowever as far as REST is concerned there is no inherent relationship \nbetween any of those URIs. It is extremely easy for a representation of \nentryβ to show it&#39;s relationship to threadα though as the relative URI \nis .. and most likely the code that builds the representation of threadα \nwill just always contain a link to .. and depend upon the rest of the \nsystem to make sure it&#39;s only going to come into effect somewhere where \nthat code makes sense.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m not getting what you&#39;re saying though.\n\n\n"}}
