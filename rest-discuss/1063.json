IBM believes we followed the OASIS intellectual property policy\nprocess.\n&gt;&gt;3. IBM will NOT charge royalties on either the patent related to \nTPA or\n&gt;&gt;the additional one whose application we disclosed.\n&gt;&gt;We will not be amending our declaration to you, just qualifying it \nto you\n&gt;&gt;as above. * * *\n&gt;&gt;IBM is proud of our work in ebXML and proud of our past and current\n&gt;&gt;participation in OASIS. OASIS will be an important organization for \nIBM\n&gt;&gt;and the industry as we all move to a common infrastructure for\n&gt;&gt;successfully conducting business on the Internet.  * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Robert S. Sutor, Ph.D.\n&gt;&gt;   Director, IBM e-business Standards Strategy\n\nI won&#39;t comment on Sutor&#39;s statement.\nThe fact remains that these particular patterns were not the only \nones lurking behind the Web service technologies.  And I&#39;m still \nguessing, but can&#39;t prove, that REST would be more free of such \nencumbrances.  (Although IBM&#39;s patent was very broad, and I guess \nthat&#39;s the way the patent lawyers write them.)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
