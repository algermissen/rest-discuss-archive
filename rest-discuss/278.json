Suppose the server application\n&gt; is willing to queue events for the client.

The Client would then\n&gt; POST to the subscription URI to retrieve queued events, or DELETE to\n&gt; end the susbscription.\n\nYou could certainly define a web service this way. I am on the fence\nabout whether it makes sense to handle this case in the general spec\ninstead of simplifying things by requiring the Queue to be a separate\ncomponent. It could go either way.\n\n&gt; I originally was thinking that the client could GET the subscription\n&gt; URI in order to retrieve queued events, but now I think that that\n&gt; would be wrong, because a GET in this case would change the state of\n&gt; the resource by returning any queued events. \n\nI would prefer to make each event into a separate resource and do a\nGET/DELETE on that resource. The top-level subscription resource would\ncontain an index of these sub-resources.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
