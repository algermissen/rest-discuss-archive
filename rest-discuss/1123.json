Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt; Does this generate client side code only? I only looked at it briefly.\n\nYes, it only generates client proxies at the moment. I have some\nexperimental code working that makes it easy to write a server. It uses\nreflection to invoke the appropriate methods. I didn&#39;t include it in the\ndistribution because I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s that elegant yet.\n\n&gt; I like it though - especially the part that maps client API methods into\n&gt; HTTP methods - it bridges the two worlds where programmers want it their\n&gt; custom way dammit but the architecture wants it a common way or else.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ultimately I&#39;d like to see a declarative mapping between API constructs\nand\n&gt; HTTP messages - the full message with headers, etc available.\n\nI was thinking about something like this for the simple reason that query or\nheader names in HTTP can be illegal in the language you&#39;re binding to. WRDL\nhas an apiName attribute but I thought that maybe it could be possible to\nhave some sort of configuration file that does the mapping on a per language\nbasis. I really don&#39;t want to tie RSDL to any particular methodology (line\nOO) so I imagine that these configuration files would be on a per tool\nbasis.\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
