There is\nnothing you can do to prevent a link from being bookmarked and I&#39;d suggest\nthat you don&#39;t worry about it.  All webservers have the defaults semantics\nbuilt in when a link is requested that is no longer exists it returns a 404.\n\nIf a service is much more robust, accessing a dead link would redirect it to\nsomething meaningful, maybe a the &quot;top&quot; of the app or the &quot;top&quot; of the\nentity.  This is optional and requires some more thought in how you\nimplement your service but may be worth its weight in gold when you need to\nupgrade.\n\nIt is worth exploring more, in my opinion.\n\n-Noah\n\nOn Mon, Sep 28, 2009 at 6:33 PM, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On Sat, Sep 26, 2009 at 4:00 PM, Noah Campbell &lt;noahcampbell@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think for entities it&#39;s fine, especially if you want to leverage\n&gt; caching\n&gt; &gt; middleware.
