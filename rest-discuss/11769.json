Here&#39;s what I wrote back then [1].  \n&gt; Interestingly, after a presentation I gave yesterday, somebody  \n&gt; suggested something very similar; Paul Fremantle, who happened to be  \n&gt; there, and myself still believe this would be worth pursuing.\n&gt; \n&gt; A while back, Sanjiva Weerawarana proposed (via email) a way to  \n&gt; decentralize media types. I think the proposal was excellent; Dan  \n&gt; Diephouse�s excellent latest blog post [2] reminded me of it again.  \n&gt; Here�s a brief introduction to a possible solution for �decentralizing  \n&gt; media types�.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Problem\n&gt; In a plain HTTP interaction, the Content-type and Accept headers carry  \n&gt; information about the type of the data being transmitted and accepted,  \n&gt; respectively. You�ve seen these media types in numerous examples, e.g.  \n&gt; a typical request or response might have a Content-type header with  \n&gt; the value application/xml.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with this approach is that media types have to be  \n&gt; registered centrally with IANA. This means that while you can invent  \n&gt; your own media types, nobody will know about them � unless you go  \n&gt; through the time-consuming process of actually having your media type  \n&gt; registered.\n&gt; \n&gt; What�s wrong with application/xml? Nothing, really, except that it  \n&gt; doesn�t tell you anything more than that what is being sent is XML:  \n&gt; You don�t have any way to tell what XML it is unless you actually  \n&gt; parse and e.g. look at the outer element�s XML namespace.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Solution\n&gt; What Sanjiva (and his collaborators, Paul Fremantle, Jonathan Marsh  \n&gt; and James Clark) propose is this: Define a single new media type,  \n&gt; application/data-format, with a required parameter uri. This uri  \n&gt; points to a definition of the data format, like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; application/data-format;uri=http://mediatypes.example.com/foo/bar\n&gt; \n&gt; The uri is an HTTP URI that points to an RDDL document, in other  \n&gt; words: you can do an HTTP GET on it and retrieve a documentation of  \n&gt; the data format that�s both human-readbable as well as machine- \n&gt; processable.\n\nSo, for this to work it assumes all user agents that don&#39;t know the \nformats will know how to process RDDL.\n\nSome questions come to mind:\n\nHow does this work for mixed XML content? What is the appropiate media \ntype for an XHTML document containing RDFa that uses OWL? What should \nthe user agent assume for all possible media types such content might be \nserved as? What should the RDDL say about such content that is suitable \nfor human-readbable as well as machine-processable options?\n\nIOW, it seems XML+namespaces blow a hole in the media type approach, as \ndo mixed models. I&#39;ve been waiting for years for someone to explain how \nthis isn&#39;t a gap in the architecture.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
