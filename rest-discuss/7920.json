I suspect it really needs at least a third significant stab\nbefore it is &quot;ready&quot;, but I would like to start soliciting feedback on\nthe current draft.\n\nIt attempts to be REST in practice rather than REST from first\nprinciples. It doesn&#39;t actually go and list out REST constraints.\nInstead, it tries to explain the differences between an unconstrained\narchitecture and a RESTful architecture from a participant or manager&#39;s\nperspective.\n\nA quick extract:\nREST is a set of rules that an architecture should conform to... It\nisn&#39;t surprising that an unconstrained architecture has its problems...\nREST eliminates ad hoc messages and radically shifts the focus of API\ndevelopment towards defining pieces of information that can be retrieved\nand manipulated... The uniform interface is meant to evolve over time.\n\nI&#39;m interested in feedback on what is really missing from the article as\nwell as commentry on the content. I want it to remain precise and clear\nbut high-level. My focus is on architecture as a vehicle for ensuring\ncomponents can talk to each other and that various other architectural\nproperties such as scalability and evolvability are met.\n\nBenjamin.\n[1] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestInPlainEnglish\n\n\n"}}
