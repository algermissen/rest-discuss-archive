URI&#39;s name  \nResources which have multiple representations, REST of course stands  \nfor Representation state transfer, and RDF is the simplest possible  \nway to describe Resources. They are three parts of the triangle. Of  \ncourse I don&#39;t have to convince anyone on this list of the power,  \nsimplicity and clarity of REST. I do urge RESTafarians though to  \nstart look at RDF more carefully (not necessarily the xml version) as  \nthe other side of the task they are endeavoring to accomplish.\n\nOnly the simplest possible thing on the web can work. URIs, REST and  \nRDF are each perfections of simplicity that mesh together perfectly.\n\nAs an example, try describing a web resource using RDF. If you find  \nit difficult to do, it&#39;s probably that the application is badly  \narchitected.  So for example on dev.java.net all users have the same  \nstart page url\n\n         https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage\n\nso what is that page really naming? How is one going to describe it ?  \nOne needs to describe it using some blank node such as\n\n      [] :representationOf &lt;StartPage&gt;;\n         :ownedBy &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt;;\n         ....\n\nie, there is no way to refer to the resource uniformly. The same is  \ntrue of xmlrpc or soap messages.  Of course the correct way to set  \nthis up would be to give every person their own start page\n\n    @prefix sioc: &lt;http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#&gt;\n\n    &lt;https://www.dev.java.net/people/bblfish&gt; a sioc:User ;\n               sioc:email &lt;mailto:henry.story@...&gt; .\n\n\nBy this simple exercise I believe you can quickly spot and explain  \nthe problem with badly architected web applications.\n\n\nHenry\n\n[1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/dropping_some_doap_into_netbeans\n[2] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/semantic_web_birds_of_a1\n\nHome page: http://bblfish.net/\nSun Blog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/\nFoaf name: http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me\n\n\n\n\n"}}
