Then we have metadata for\nthe video file itself.  Duration, co=\r\ndec attributes, dimensions, etc..\nThe video file is always transcoded to at=\r\n least one other format,\nusually two, and the original is always kept.  So =\r\nwe have a base video\nitem and three related items that hold metadata for th=\r\ne specific\nformat.  The metadata for the video file itself will contain a\nr=\r\nesource name for the actual file.\n\nIn the database, the base video item is =\r\nstored in one table, and the\nfile metadata itself is stored in another tabl=\r\ne, linked together with\na FK.\n\nSo how best to represent this structure usin=\r\ng rest resources that\nprovides basic crud operations?  \n\nOne catch is that =\r\nI really need a single query that will return the\nbase metadata plus format=\r\n specific metadata for a single format, but\nupdates should be separate quer=\r\nies.\n\nIdeas?\n\n\n\n"}}
