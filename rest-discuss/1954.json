I am working on something \nsimilar. PPrescond mentioned three top level urls to expose the \ndifferent functionality like spellchecking and searches and I&#39;d \ndefinitely agree. Something like:\n\nhttp://xoomle.../searches/Paul+Prescond\n\nwould be very nice. You might imagine a folder on a hard drive \ncalled &#39;searches&#39; and in this folder is a &#39;file&#39; corresponding to \nevery conceivable Google search. It would be nice to be able to \nsearch this folder--that is search searches. Especially if \ninformation can be stored about searches indicating how successful \nthey are. (Find me searches containing the word Prescond where the \nlast time the search was performed X condition was met). This makes \nno sense, but that&#39;s okay.\n\nI just like the idea of making every search a real URL and being able \nto dynamically extend a search by appending to a URL. Keep up the \ngood work.\n\n- codaland @ http://codaland.blogspot.com\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Paul Prescod &lt;paul@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Xoomle is really cool!\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are some of my ideas for improvement in order of importance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Rather than &quot;method=&quot;, I&#39;d say that there should be three top-\nlevel\n&gt; URIs. Among reasons this is better in theory, it is easier to build \nHTML\n&gt; forms that have different ACTION= attributes. This is the only thing\n&gt; that would stop the REST community from using XooMLe as a perfect \ncase\n&gt; study. It&#39;s a tiny thing to change but sort of goes to the heart of \nREST\n&gt; philosophy. Priority = 8 out of 10.\n&gt; \n&gt; * I&#39;d suggest that the key should be passed using HTTP \nauthentication\n&gt; (at least as an option). Then developers could share references \nwithout\n&gt; sharing their keys. As I recall, if you really want, you can embed \nHTTP\n&gt; authentication information in URIs *anyhow*. Priority = 7/10\n&gt; \n&gt; * &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; could be used to provide a nice HTML-based\n&gt; rendition. I would be happy to provide this XSLT stylesheet. \nPriority =\n&gt; 6/10\n&gt; \n&gt; * I&#39;d use a namespace on the returned XML (with default prefix) so \nthat\n&gt; it is a little easier to associate namespace-triggered behaviour \nwith\n&gt; the XML. It would just take one attribute value to be &quot;namespace \naware&quot;.\n&gt; 6/10\n&gt; \n&gt;  * It would be great if you would publish a schema. I believe there \nis\n&gt; one embedded in Google&#39;s WSDL but you could extract that modulo\n&gt; copyright issues. You could also use a schemaLocation attribute to \npoint\n&gt; to it. 6/10\n&gt; \n&gt;  * &lt;url&gt;...&lt;/url&gt; could become &lt;url xlink:href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;...&lt;/url&gt;. I \nhave\n&gt; mixed feelings about XLink but it *is* the standard way to do \nlinking in\n&gt; XML. More or less this will endear you to people who have developed\n&gt; XLink processors. 5/10\n&gt; \n&gt;  * You could build on the way HTTP/REST works to add some \ninteresting\n&gt; features. \n&gt; \n&gt;  1. For instance you could embed a link to the cached page in each \nitem: \n&gt;     &lt;URL&gt;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~norman/&lt;/URL&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; &lt;cached&gt;http://xooomle..../cached?\nurl=&quot;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~norman/&quot;&lt;/cached&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  2. You could have a link from each page that is a &quot;sub-query&quot;. So \nlet&#39;s\n&gt; say I send you a link like\n&gt; &quot;http://.../?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&method=doGoogleSearch&q=Paul&quot;, it \nwould\n&gt; embed within it a link like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;     * &lt;subquery\n&gt; xlink:href=&quot;http://.../doGoogleSearch/hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-\n1&method=doGoogleSearch&q=Paul/&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then I could do a *subquery* just by appending &quot;?q=Prescod&quot;. By \nsubquery\n&gt; I mean that it would be interpreted as the same as &quot;Paul+Prescod&quot;. \nThis\n&gt; somewhat goes back to the first issue: you need a way for the \nmethod to\n&gt; be part of the path, not part of the query, but you also need a way \nfor\n&gt; a representation for the &quot;query&quot; to be part of the path. Once it is\n&gt; moved into the path it is opaque so it doesn&#39;t matter if you use \nsome\n&gt; compression scheme or something:\n&gt; \n&gt;  * &lt;subquery\n&gt; xlink:href=&quot;http://.../doGoogleSearch/fj4fjefe0fa9e8w09i03fj/&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ====\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that you can think of the Google database as a set of resources,\n&gt; you&#39;ll find that there are a bunch of ideas like this where we can \ndo\n&gt; interesting things by associating these resources.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Come discuss XML and REST web services at:\n&gt;   Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, \nconferences.oreillynet.com\n&gt;   Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n\n"}}
