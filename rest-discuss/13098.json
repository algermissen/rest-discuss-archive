So I might have two (or more) different res=\r\nources/URIs for one behind-the-scenes object, each of which contains only t=\r\nhe elements that the user can modify, which supports GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT?\n=\r\n\nI like that; it seems much cleaner than the direction I was going.\n\nI thin=\r\nk I&#39;d also want to have a resource which contains all the elements and supp=\r\norts only GET/HEAD/OPTIONS (since, in my case, they&#39;re all readable if the =\r\nuser is authorized to see the resource at all), but I think I&#39;d want it to =\r\nhave an edit link to navigate to the appropriate read/write resource. Does =\r\nthat mean that in order to avoid trouble with caching, I&#39;d have to have par=\r\nallel versions of that resource with different URIs as well, since the edit=\r\n link would be different depending on the user?\n\n -- Jim\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim:\n&gt; I am addre=\r\nssing the security portion of your post.

For example:\n&gt; - user1 has GET,HEAD,OPTIONS for /coll=\r\nection/\n&gt; - manager1 has GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST,PUT for /collection/\n&gt; - adm=\r\nin1 has GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST,PUT,DELETE for /collection/\n&gt; \n&gt; This means I=\r\n focus on defining the proper Resources (addressed via\n&gt; URI) when I want t=\r\no limit what state representations clients and\n&gt; server share.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the =\r\ncase you provide, I would consider different Resources to\n&gt; handle differen=\r\nt update privileges for the same stored data. This\n&gt; also clears up any att=\r\nempts at doing partial updates (and therefore\n&gt; clears up caching issues) s=\r\nince none are needed now that there are\n&gt; different resources to handle the=\r\n details.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my example, the ability to pass different state represent=\r\nations\n&gt; is modeled as different resources. These various &quot;secured&quot; resourc=\r\ne\n&gt; variations might still all &quot;map&quot; to the same data storage on the\n&gt; serv=\r\ner, but that&#39;s not interesting to the client anyway since the\n&gt; data model =\r\nis *not* the resource model on RESTful implementations.\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://a=\r\nmundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jul 1, 2009 at 15:42, Jim Edwards-Hewi=\r\ntt &lt;jimeh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi, everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a newbie here (thoug=\r\nh not to REST in general), and the list archives\n&gt; &gt; have been a great help=\r\n in clarifying my understanding of a lot of REST\n&gt; &gt; concepts and suggestin=\r\ng good design elements. I have one part of my design\n&gt; &gt; right now where I&#39;=\r\nm unsure what a good RESTful approach would be.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have resources th=\r\nat support GET and PUT, but contain some parts that\n&gt; &gt; clients are not all=\r\nowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an uncommon case;\n&gt; &gt; I would think=\r\n that navigation links, for example, would typically not be\n&gt; &gt; modifiable =\r\nin a PUT.) So is it better to:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. Require clients to submit all the=\r\n read-only parts unmodified in a PUT,\n&gt; &gt; and respond with an error code if=\r\n they are absent or altered?\n&gt; &gt; 2. Take advantage of the leniency allowed =\r\nin a server&#39;s implementation of\n&gt; &gt; PUT to ignore the read-only elements (o=\r\nr their absence)?\n&gt; &gt; 3. Separate read-only elements into a sub-resource th=\r\nat only supports GET?\n&gt; &gt; (This may not be feasible for resources which mus=\r\nt be created as a whole.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; or something else?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second, there =\r\nare some elements that are modifiable or not depending on the\n&gt; &gt; privilege=\r\ns held by the (authenticated) user. I would think this would be\n&gt; &gt; express=\r\ned by a difference in the representation returned to the client, but\n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nat should that difference be? (My representations are XML documents, if\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n there isn&#39;t a more general solution.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And in a broader sense, I&#39;d =\r\nlike the client to know which elements of the\n&gt; &gt; resource the user can mod=\r\nify, for presentation purposes. Is there a\n&gt; &gt; generally accepted way to do=\r\n this, perhaps with form templates or XForms?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be interested in =\r\nany comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m just\n&gt; &gt; looking at it from =\r\nthe wrong angle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  -- Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
