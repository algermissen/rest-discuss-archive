I can&#39;t see the need for anything else. I&#39;m coming from a\n&gt; rather object oriented background however, and am probably being\n&gt; somewhat shortsighted.\n\nWhen moving from Object-Orientation to REST, it is important to fix your\nanalogies to the right places. In REST, a URL is like a pointer or\nreference in Object-Orientation. You aren&#39;t meant to understand it. It\nisn&#39;t a tree, despite having structure. A smart person might be able\ninterpret the just pointer and figure out some sort of relationship of\nthis memory block to another, however it makes more sense to look at the\npointers and references that exist within the memory rather than looking\nat the pointer itself.\n\nThe same goes for REST. URLs are usually structured to avoid naming\nclashes and to make sense to the server owner. Human clients may be able\nto make use of this structure, but at the machine level the only real\nstructure to a RESTful application is the graph of hyperlinks between\nresources. When you look at a fleet, you should be able see or navigate\nto the list of vehicles that form part of the fleet. That doesn&#39;t mean\nthat the vehicles urls should include the fleet urls, in fact they\ndefinately shouldn&#39;t if the vehicle can ever change fleets. It is just a\nlist.\n\nPart of the power of this decoupling is that I can maintain a list of\nvehicles that from part of my fleet without containing them on the same\nserver, let alone within the same path structure. That means that I can\nwrite an application solely dedicated to fleet management, and have it\nsimply refer off via hyperlinks to an appliation solely dedicated to\nvehicle management. By trying to interpret the urls themselves as\nstructure you close yourself off to these kinds of important\ncapabilities.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
