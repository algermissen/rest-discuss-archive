But the name is really too close to WS-*.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not just too close to WS-*. It is too close to the platonic ideal \n&gt; of REST itself. It implies REST is about standardization of data \n&gt; exchange formats within and across industries. It also is not a small \n&gt; leap for people then to think that the data exchange formats are what \n&gt; REST is all about.\n&gt; \n&gt; The name is just bad taste, and confusing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your content in your message is improving, but your logo is still a \n&gt; puzzling point. So it&#39;s not as simple as &quot;_all_ you were hung up on was \n&gt; the name&quot;. The bad name suggested, I think, to most of us that you were \n&gt; coercing REST for marketing purposes. We&#39;re responding with a fair level \n&gt; of consumer fear, uncerainty and doubt (as opposed to corporate FUD). \n&gt; You&#39;re basically now burdening us with explaining to our COO why \n&gt; &quot;REST-*&quot; he heard about in Delta Airlines In-flight Magazine isn&#39;t REST.\n&gt; \n\nI am perfectly fine with consumer FUD.  But if you do not want us to \npromote something that is not RESTful, then we&#39;re going to have to be \nengaged on a technical level either here on rest-discuss or on the \ngoogle groups we&#39;ve created at REST-*.org.   We want our specs to be \nRESTful, but we&#39;re REST-noobs, we will get things wrong.  We want our \nspecs to be architecturally sound.  FUDing us just because we&#39;re a big \nbad vendor, because we sell middleware, or because we&#39;re JBoss just \nisn&#39;t very constructive.  We&#39;re not going away.\n\nFuthermore we launched an effort, not a product.  We admitted from the \nbeginning that what we had was old, raw, and unfinished.  Our goal is to \ndefine RESTful middleware, not to define REST itself.  Maybe not clearly \nstated at first, but I&#39;ve at least refined the message on the website.\n\nWhether or not REST-* continues to be the name is still debatable, but \nwhatever name it ends up being will have &quot;REST&quot; within it.  You guys are \njust going to have to deal with it.  If REST is positioned as a \nparadigm, as an idea, you can&#39;t say any one person, company, or \norganization cannot use it to promote whatever they are doing however \ngood or bad.  Imagine if the same tact was taken with the coined phrase \nObject-Oriented-Programming?  Or even worse, as you say, it was \ntrademarked?  If it had, OOP wouldn&#39;t have been called OOP, it would \nhave been called entirely something else.\n\nRoy&#39;s role is a good one.  IMO, it is Roy&#39;s (and other&#39;s) job to keep \neverybody focused.  One could question his tactics, but personally I \nprefer abrasiveness and bluntness.  Even though I was pretty demoralized \nby his initial comments, somebody, expecially the creator, has to hold \nthe banner for RESTful purity and bash people into submission as much as \npossible.  But to say you cannot use REST the name (or REST the brand) \nif we are not pure, or even worse, because one or two of you don&#39;t agree \nwith what somebody is doing is just completely unproductive.  You have \nto let individuals, companies, and organizations come to terms with REST \nin their own way and at their own pace.  As REST goes from the early \nadopters to mainstream, there is going to be confusion.  People will get \nit completely and utterly wrong, but IMO, this is part of the process. \nFor myself, I am completely open to learning what the &quot;right&quot; way is, \nbut you&#39;re just not going to convince me there is no place for \nmiddleware or middleware services within REST.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
