It might be (1) simply a state-change\n&gt; notification protocol, (2) a push-based state replication\n&gt; protocol, or (3) a subscription / listener management protocol.\n&gt; It appears that we are generally converging on (1), viewing (2)\n&gt; as either an optimization or application-specific or both, and\n&gt; (3) as interesting but somewhat out-of-scope for this spec.  (We\n&gt; are talking about reifying subscribers and subscriptions, but\n&gt; pushing out &quot;listener management&quot; etc.)\n\nYou should separate listener management and subscription management. The\nlatter is in scope because it is part of the relationship between\npublisher and subscriber. The former is not.\n\n&gt; If so, then we may be spinning our wheels somewhat; various folks\n&gt; did a fair bit of work on NOTIFY back in the early days [1] in\n&gt; the context of proxy cache notification and in the course of the\n&gt; HTTP-NG discussions.  Not sure what the current state of NOTIFY\n&gt; is;  did it ever go anywhere?  I apologize if there&#39;s an obvious\n&gt; answer to this, as my own &quot;cache&quot; of HTTP caching-related\n&gt; information is a bit stale.  No mention of NOTIFY / this draft in\n&gt; Ari&#39;s 1998 book, and very little I can find via Google.\n\nMnot seems to think it is still a very open issue. (btw, we could have\nbeen more forthcoming with comments on his spec):\n\n * http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/292\n\nFollowing some links he&#39;s provided, I&#39;d say it is still under active\nstandardization. \n\n&gt;...\n&gt;...\n&gt; CONS:  As noted in [1], any point-to-point notification protocol\n&gt; suffers when there are a large number of parties interested in\n&gt; receiving notifications;  the draft explicitly states that\n&gt; &quot;clients should not attempt to use this facility as a matter of\n&gt; course&quot; for that reason.  IMO, we&#39;re no better or worse off in\n&gt; this regard with either [1] or HttpEvents as contemplated.  \n\nFirst, it isn&#39;t sufficient to say: &quot;Their spec doesn&#39;t scale but ours\ndoesn&#39;t either.&quot;\n\nSecond, I think that a subscription based spec is more amenable to\noptimization. If the publisher pushes enough information to the client\nthat the client is &quot;happy&quot; then there is no need for a GET which avoids\na GET-flood. I would expect this to be the common case.\n\nConsider implementing a chat program using only GETs and cache\ninvalidation. You would double the latency, bandwidth usage etc.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
