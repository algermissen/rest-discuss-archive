If you are parsing PATH_INFO, you can use\n    mod_rewrite to de-uglify the cgi script path.\n\n    /readable/foo/bar -&gt; /cgi-bin/ugly.cgi/foo/bar\n\n    I don&#39;t have mod_rewrite code for this but its a\n    trivial one-liner (after setup).\n\n2. Pick keys out of the URL with mod_rewrite and\n    rewrite them as query-string arguments.\n\n    From .htaccess:\n\n    RewriteBase /readable\n    RewriteRule ^invoices/$ cgi/invoices/index.pl.cgi\n    RewriteRule ^invoices/([0-9]+)?$ invoices/$1/ [R=permanent]\n    RewriteRule ^invoices/([0-9]+)/$ cgi/invoices/one.pl.cgi?id=$1\n    RewriteRule ^invoices/([0-9]+)/form/$ cgi/invoices/form.pl.cgi?id=$1\n\n    I would think this complicates use of the query-string\n    for queries, but I didn&#39;t try that.\n\n    On the other hand, this could work well for adapting\n    existing scripts to expose non-dispatch-query-string\n    URLs. Some do this to be more available to spiders\n    like GoogleBot.\n\nPS: I publish all my URLs to have a leading slash so\nthere I can have terse relative URLs\n(e.g. ./foo , ../foo/bar ) in HTML representations,\nand have legacy browsers interpret them consistently.\n\n"}}
