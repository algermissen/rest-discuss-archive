It&#39;s a subtle point.\n\nHTTP uses TCP/IP.  It does not fill in holes.\nPlease clarify your point?\n\n&gt; (d) If you&#39;re using HTTP to do RPCs, you aren&#39;t using HTTP\n\nUhm.  So, SOAP and XML-RPC aren&#39;t using HTTP?\n\n&gt; &gt; I think the format of the POST should me\n&gt; &gt; multipart/form-data.  XML-RPC folks prefer XML-RPC\n&gt; &gt; and SOAP people prefer SOAP envelopes.\n&gt; &gt; These are all RPC.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Mark&#39;s perspective --- certainly my own perspective --- is that the\n&gt; XML-RPC and SOAP communities and the RPC-oriented &quot;web services&quot; efforts that we\n&gt; see all over the place today\n\nblah blah blah.  I think most web apps (of\nwhich terrorist_or_not.coom is an example) are\nRPC.  The issue here is whether they are or\naren&#39;t.\n\nThe other RESTers here seemed to have no problem\nwith the overall design of posting\nmultipart/form-data to some URL.\n\nI just fail to see why that is REST.\nI think you and I agree that it isn&#39;t.  Perhaps\nif you explain why to Mark and Paul, they will\nunderstand it better than if I do. ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; If you do, explain how to make\n&gt; &gt; terrorist_or_not.com non-RPC and why it would be\n&gt; &gt; better that way.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll take that challenge.  Next message.\n\nLooking forward.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
