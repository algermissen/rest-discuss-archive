Suppose I go to a web site and think that\n&gt; &gt; a binary is out of date with respect to the\n&gt; &gt; source. I NOTIFY on the URL of the binary and the\n&gt; &gt; server may retrieve the source and recompile IF\n&gt; &gt; the source is more recent than the binary.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you misundertand the NOTIFY pattern;  re-read the WD-Proxy\n&gt; spec.  You don&#39;t NOTIFY a resource on an origin server, you GET that\n&gt; resource with appropriate headers and then the origin server generates\n&gt; a NOTIFY to you, &quot;touching&quot; your cached representation to tell you it&#39;s\n&gt; been modified on the origin server.\n\nMy use of NOTIFY had nothing to do with the\nWD-Proxy spec.  Though it is good to know that we\nare in some agreement.  My point is that NOTIFY is\nmore general than just explicit proxies.  It\napplies to any HTTP resource.\n\nThe fact that the WD-Proxy spec. describes a\nNOTIFY that is specific to proxies is irrelevant\nto my argument.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
