It isn&#39;t\nHTTP.\n\n&gt; When a message causes the temperature to change - that is a request, which\n&gt; might spawn notifications.\n\nIt isn&#39;t necessarily an HTTP request.\n\n&gt; The thing that originates the notification - what kinds of things would it\n&gt; want to say?\n\nIf it&#39;s a thermometer it won&#39;t say much. &quot;Temperature changed.\nTemperature changed. Temperature changed.&quot;\n\nBut then the HTTP system has to propogate this out through HTTP\nnotificatoins.\n\n&gt; It would say what resource was affected, how it was affected, possibly who\n&gt; affected it, etc.\n\nOnly the first is mandatory. You can figure out how it was affected\n(i.e. up or down and how many degrees) by doing a GET. It is probably\nnot useful to report the GPS location of the termometer!\n\n&gt; What structure and format of names/values would it use?\n\nI think that the only thing that must be standardized are the things\nthat will be useful for most applications. So I would say that it needs\nto be able to report the location that changed. That&#39;s an HTTP header.\n\nArguably it should also be able to deliver a representation of the\nchange or the resource in a standarized way. If so, that&#39;s the HTTP\nbody.\n\nOtherwise you invent your own body formats, maybe your own headers and\nyou&#39;re off to the races.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I underlying engine should only report that the resource has been changed or\n&gt; deleted - I agree.\n&gt; But how does it say &#39;changed&#39; or &#39;deleted&#39;? I am saying since the resource\n&gt; is reflected as a URI - otherwise you couldn&#39;t subscribe to it - the\n&gt; notification should be cast in terms of URI modification operations, i.e.\n&gt; HTTP concepts.\n\nHow about:\n\nHTTP-event: POST\nHTTP-event: PUT\nHTTP-event: DELETE\n\nSo a full notification might look like:\n\nPOST /your.event.sync\nTarget-URI: http://www.the.thing.you.were.watching\nHTTP-event: PUT\n\n(some proprietary body, or the resource itself if you asked for that)\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
