If the request body contains a URI that points\n&gt; to http://aonlinestore.com/sku/jumbopackofshrimp then that maybe is\n&gt; the exactly what that the user is requesting.  The fact that this week\n&gt; a jumbo pack of shrimp contains 10 shrimp and last week it contained 8\n&gt; shrimp is irrelevant to the user because the identifier is specifying\n&gt; what the user wants.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe that to discount the my weathersnapshot scenario based on\n&gt; the fact that I used a text/uri-list is addressing a different point.\n&gt; I admit that I tend to be somewhat more cavalier about allowing the\n&gt; server to pile on semantics to a message than I would ever allow a\n&gt; client to do and I realize that&#39;t not a good idea.  However, I believe\n&gt; the point I was trying to make is just as valid if I were to use\n&gt; application/vnd.acme.list-of-uris-to-weather-images.\n&gt;\n&gt; What are negative effects of allowing a server to dereference a link\n&gt; contained in the request to acquire all the information necessary to\n&gt; process the request?\n\nIt&#39;s been a while, I&#39;ll take a stab... assuming it&#39;s truly a URL and\nnot a URI...\n\nPerformance - the server now has to do the de-referencing of a one or more URLs.\n\nComplexity - the order example requires a transaction and\nde-referencing adds to the list of things that can go wrong.\n\nUnderstandability - from a client perspective, it&#39;s less\nunderstandable - guarantees that key attributes (e.g. price) of the\ntarget resource hasn&#39;t changed and the like.  maybe that could be\ncovered by some &#39;purchasing protocol&#39; or somesuch?\n\nReliability - if the URL needs to be de-referenced and that server is\nunresponsive, your whole system is down.\n\nVisibility - moot, because of POST.\n\nSome are admittedly a stretch:)  What are the advantages?\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n"}}
