Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; as we know, the key constraint of REST is\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hypermedia as the engine of application state\n&gt; \n&gt; Being, however, that it is the most important aspect of \n&gt; REST, it also comes up a lot whenever I try to explain \n&gt; REST or discourse about it. Consequently, conducting \n&gt; such conversation is often awkward and straining.\n\nNot to be pedantic, but did you really me to say *the* most important, key\nconstraint?&quot;  At best I would think it is on peer with the other\nconstraints, especially when compared with the uniform interface constrain. \n\nPersonally, I think that &quot;hypermedia as engine of application state&quot; has\nbeen hijacked (even by Roy himself) to prematurely quash any exploration of\nURL construction. As such, I&#39;m always sensitive when I hear people want to\ndraw more attention to it.  \n\nWhat I&#39;m advocating here,  and have been on and off as I&#39;ve had time, is\nthat we should be looking at using &quot;hypermedia AND url construction&quot; instead\nof having the false dichotomy of &quot;hypermedia OR url construction.&quot; More\nspecifically, I&#39;m referring to the use of URI Templates for servers to\nconvey their intentions to the client via hypermedia.  \n\nFurther, I think if URL construction with URI Templates were incorporated\ninto REST best practices I think we&#39;d see a lot less pushback from people on\nthe hypermedia constraint. Of course we need to get URI templates to become\na recommendation, but encouraging URI templates use with REST could given\nweight to seeing that recommendation finally happen.\n\n&gt; So here is my proposal: let&#39;s shorten the awkward part of the \n&gt; phrase, &quot;as the engine of&quot;, to a single word meaning the same\n&gt; thing: &quot;driving&quot;. Now, any rephrasing is not going to put the \n&gt; focus on &quot;hypermedia&quot; quite in the same way as Roy&#39;s phrasing \n&gt; manages to, which is the trade-off; in return, however, we \n&gt; get a term that is much easier to incorporate into sentences:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hypermedia-driven application state\n&gt; \n&gt; If people start using this, I suspect that &quot;application&quot; will \n&gt; frequently get shortened to &quot;app&quot;, which makes the phrase \n&gt; roll off the tongue even easier. In fact, read it out aloud:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hypermedia-driven app state\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice that? It has a rhythm. Linguistically, this is \n&gt; important; it makes the term feel lightweight and natural to \n&gt; say, even if it has a lot of syllables. I also like the form \n&gt; with &quot;application&quot;\n&gt; shortened because it keeps the weight of the term on the \n&gt; &quot;hyper- media-driven&quot; part, restoring some of the precision \n&gt; of Roy&#39;s wording.\n\nWow. Given&#39;s Roy&#39;s past comments regarding interpretations of his thesis, I\nain&#39;t touchin that one with a ten foot pole! &#39;-)\n\n&gt; The constraint has not received enough attention despite \n&gt; being the pillar upon which REST, uh, rests; popular \n&gt; understanding of REST is nebulous at best as a consequence. \n\nOne of the reasons I believe it hasn&#39;t received &quot;enough attention&quot; is\nbecause it&#39;s reference in Roy&#39;s thesis was fleeting (only one sentence?),\nand particulars of it&#39;s implementation has been nebulous. \n\nHere on the list when someone has asked for examples to demostrate the\nhypermedia constraint they have frequently been dismissively told that &quot;any\nweb page with links is an example.&quot;  While that answer might make the\nanswerers feel smug, it has not provided acceptable guidance for people\ntrying to implement the constraint for use in RESTful services not targeting\nthe browser.\n\nThat said, codifying the constraints into concrete examples and\nimplementations was my main reason for joining with Alan Dean to start the\nSimple Web Services initiative. My hopes was to create a collaborative\nstructure to capture some best practices for use of REST&#39;s constraints from\nthe REST thought leaders and forge them into concrete examples,\nimplementations, and so on.  Just FYI.\n\nBTW, why not just call it &quot;the hypermedia constraint?&quot;  \n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n"}}
