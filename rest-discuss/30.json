Would Wiki be noticably better if it used PUT instead of\n&gt; POST?\n\nOopsie with that last message.  I&#39;ll continue my thought here.\n\nThere&#39;s *currently* a small efficiency advantage in having PUT as its\nown method; caching.  But safety is also an issue.  Permitting the\nPUT method to go behind a firewall is a much safer thing to do than\npermitting POST, for example, because PUT behaviour is much more\nnarrowly defined.\n\nI would expect that there&#39;s other good reasons too, but that&#39;s all\nthat I can think of right now.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
