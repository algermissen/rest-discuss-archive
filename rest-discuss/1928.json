Now, if that request returns an HTML page that has additional URIs\nin it (in the form of &lt;a href=&#39;&#39;&gt;, for instance), then my browser can use\nthem.  Again, the browser did not create these URIs.  Now, suppose I submit\none of the returned URIs and get back some more HTML.  This time, the html\ncontains a form that looks like &lt;form method=&#39;get&#39;\naction=&#39;http://www.seairth.com/scripts/process.cgi&#39;&gt;.  At this point, the\nURI given was not created by the browser.  However, this time, when the\nbrowser submits the form, it appends a query to the end of the URI (e.g.\nhttp://www.seairth.com/scripts/process.cgi?id=seairth). According to\nstatements made on this list, the browser has created a new URI/identifier.\nThis means that the browser is identifying a different resource than the one\nthat the server identified.  This is unlike all other URIs it was given or\nused.\n\nIn terms of REST, is this okay?  Or is this issue delegated to the\napplication-level (e.g. http in the example above)?  It seems to me that\nREST would have something to say about this, but what is it?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
