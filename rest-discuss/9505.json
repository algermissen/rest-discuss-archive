This is my first time\npost=\r\ning to the group.  In our lab we are trying to go with a web-based\napproach=\r\n to expose some of the image processing functionality being\ndeveloped.\n\nSom=\r\ne examples of what the processing would output are transformations\non the i=\r\nmages themselves and some sort of feature extraction.  There\nseems to be a =\r\nhigh need to have a mechanism that will allow multiple\nimage processors ope=\r\nrate on an input in a chain.  \n\nAs an experiment I wanted to build a JSON-f=\r\normated, RESTful image\nresize service.  Can you guys suggest what it would =\r\nlook like?  I am a\nlittle confused on how something that is very verb based=\r\n like resizing\ncan be modeled as nouns.  \n\nI would like to use multipart/mi=\r\nxed to bundle JSON data with multiple\nbinary images.\n\nI wanted to use CID&#39;s=\r\n, to reference files from the JSON, but I am not\nsure how to make web-brows=\r\ners support that.  To compensate I am just\nreferencing files in order of th=\r\ne message...\n\nHere&#39;s what I am thinking: \n\nPOST /resizedImages/ HTTP/1.1\nCo=\r\nntent-Length: 550818\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=3DBbC04y\n-=\r\n-BbC04y\n{ &quot;entries&quot;: [ \n  { &quot;image&quot;:1, &quot;resized-width&quot;:&quot;640&quot; },\n  { &quot;image&quot;=\r\n:0, &quot;resized-width&quot;:&quot;480&quot;, &quot;resized-height&quot;:&quot;640&quot; },\n  ]\n}\n--BbC04y\nContent=\r\n-Disposition: form-data; name=3D&quot;image&quot;; filename=3D&quot;file2.gif&quot;\nContent-Typ=\r\ne: image/gif\n\n   ...contents of file2.gif... \n--BbC04y\nContent-Disposition:=\r\n form-data; name=3D&quot;image&quot;; filename=3D&quot;file1.jpg&quot;\nContent-Type: image/jpeg=\r\n\n\n   ...contents of file1.jpg... \n\nAny suggestions will be appreciated.\n\nCh=\r\neers,\nJoe\n\n\n\n\n"}}
