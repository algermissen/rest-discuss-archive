To the underlying components (HTTP\nservers, caches, etc) they are identical.  The difference comes if you\nwant to be able to generate these URIs and you want to use URIs for the\nname of the product.  Then the first one works.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;It seems that using a URI for everything is a bit\n&gt; &gt; excessive, but I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time in this area.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why isn&#39;t it better for more things to have identities?\n&gt; (I&#39;m not sure where &quot;excessive&quot; begins, but for each product to have\n&gt; its own URI does not seem to be even close to the edge.)\n&gt; \nI think he meant &quot;using a URI&quot; is excessive not &quot;a URI for everything&quot;\nis excessive.  I personally don&#39;t think it is excessive because\nhopefully all this is automated so the user never sees these names.\nURIs don&#39;t cost anything to create vs. a simple string. (Well maybe a\nlittle extra memory, but not enough to really matter.)\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n"}}
