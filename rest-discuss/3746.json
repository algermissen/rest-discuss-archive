REST is defined by\nmy dissertation.  REST is not defined by the TAG discussion or\nthe W3C&#39;s Webarch document or TimBL&#39;s design notes.  REST is an\narchitectural style, not the Web architecture.  Please try\nto keep the terminology consistent.\n\nREST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.\nREST merely requires that actions be applied to an identified resource,\nand that identification be in the form of a resource identifier (rather\nthan, for example, a sequence of events).  Obviously, if you do not\nhave an identifier for a given resource, then you cannot interact\nwith it directly in REST, which means you can&#39;t do things like share\nthat specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form\nof audit reference (you can&#39;t do that anyway -- you need all of the\ninformation that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,\nmethod, authentication token, etc.).\n\nThat does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,\nconversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect\nactions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are\ntrade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued\nresource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more\nspecific resource before further actions take place, but both are\nfully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be\nvague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly\nwhen a component has yet to determine the specific URI.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
