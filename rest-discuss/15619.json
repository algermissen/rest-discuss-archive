If Glenn&#39;s=\r\n team are going to do &quot;REST like\n&gt;&gt; they =A0&gt;&gt; meant it&quot; to paraphrase Guil=\r\nherme, I don&#39;t think that JAX-RS is the\n&gt;&gt; =A0&gt;&gt; right way to go.\n&gt;&gt; =A0&gt; =\r\n=A0&gt; But that&#39;s just an opinion. Or is there some technical criticism as\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n well?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It seems like the client part of a REST client was not so clea=\r\nr at that\n&gt;&gt; time, and there were not so many attemps to create generic con=\r\nsumers. Every\n&gt;&gt; service provided their &quot;own specific REST APIs&quot; for their =\r\n&quot;specific REST\n&gt;&gt; services&quot;, i.e. twitter, facebook, and hundreds of others=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The first JAX-RS spec did not take hypermedia in account, so if you=\r\n think\n&gt;&gt; about REST without hypermedia, it will not be problem. But it see=\r\nms like\n&gt;&gt; REST depends on using hypermedia, right?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you believe so=\r\n and want your consumers to use hypermedia, using a Java\n&gt;&gt; framework, you =\r\nhave to rely on Restfulie, Jersey and Restlet, who are trying\n&gt;&gt; to do so.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Paul mentioned, its a matter of time for it to enter the JAX-RS sp=\r\necs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly. JAX-RS doesn&#39;t have a client, how can it be the wrong way=\r\n to go\n&gt; yet. The server part that is specified, deals well enough with the=\r\n protocol\n&gt; elements and doesn&#39;t prevent me from using formats or object mo=\r\ndels that\n&gt; contain links. One thing the spec does do well is UriBuilder/Ur=\r\niInfo -\n&gt; regardless of whether the builder pattern is to taste, it helps s=\r\nolves a\n&gt; layering problem in Java between service code and http code. The =\r\nJAX-RS\n&gt; impls haven&#39;t gotten in my way yet when it comes to working media =\r\ntypes,\n&gt; http, or just applying REST in general, which is more than I can s=\r\nay for\n&gt; most frameworks on the JVM. I&#39;m free to figure out the data.\n&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nhen it comes to building a client I suspect the problem will be dealing\n&gt; w=\r\nith Java&#39;s type system and generics (I&#39;m not sure C# would be much better).=\r\n\n&gt; To get around that in restfulie, it seems to be via hardcoding &lt;link\n&gt; r=\r\nel|href&gt; into a class incorrectly called &#39;Resource&#39;, like this\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://=\r\ngithub.com/caelum/restfulie-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/br/com/cael=\r\num/restfulie/Resource.java&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://github.com/caelum/restfulie-java/blob=\r\n/master/core/src/main/java/br/com/caelum/restfulie/Relation.java&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;=\r\ns a car subclass of carpark kind of error - resources aren&#39;t\n&gt; representati=\r\nons and not all media types have relations\n&gt;\n&gt; If that&#39;s the &#39;right way to =\r\ngo&#39; for hateoas, then perhaps I don&#39;t understand\n&gt; the concept of hateaos.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
