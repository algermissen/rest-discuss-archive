For example: if a client\n&gt;&gt;   is programmed to use a search, the service provider\n&gt;&gt;   must assure that the search will remain available\n&gt;&gt;   during the agreed upon service lifetime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. Use a means of description that is formal enough to\n&gt;&gt;   serve as the basis for legal contracts (e.g. SLAs).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3. Make that means of description standard/mainstream\n&gt;&gt;   enough to avoid that everybody is forced to reinvent\n&gt;&gt;   the wheel[1]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prose meets all these objectives. Plus it is also interoperable\n&gt; between all parties involved.\n\nSure prose is appropriate (never suggested otherwise). But just saying  \n&#39;use prose&#39; does not address 3. above. This was one of the points made  \nby Steve Jones: given that WS-* has a rigid interface description  \nlanguage &#39;built in&#39; while the use of REST means you have to come up  \nwith a means of describing interfaces yourself is a huge selling point  \nfor WS-*. Not that having such things as WSDL and BPEL is desireable  \nfrom a networked systems point of view but when a non technical person  \nhas to make a business decision about WS-* vs REST, the latter is more  \nlikely to &#39;loose&#39; if you first have to come up with a style for  \ndocumenting the interfaces. And even worse would be the position of  \n&#39;Nah, you don&#39;t need that. Just let everyone write it up&#39;.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
