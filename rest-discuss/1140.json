I don&#39;t think\nit would fly. Maybe if we asked them to &quot;please support SOAP over HTTP\nPOST in XSLT.&quot; ;)\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure IIS supports PUT. The method name is just a paramater on\nthe &quot;HttpRequest&quot; object, otherwise it doesn&#39;t care much. One small\nissue is that the default security configuration probably allows\nGET,POST, not GET,PUT,POST.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
