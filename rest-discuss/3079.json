I really like this part:\n&quot;a critical point is that the choreography application model requires \nthat implementation details (the business process rules) be exposed \nas part of the interface. This will make them very brittle should \nthey need to change, as well as drastically increasing the \ncoordination costs of implementing a multi-party process (since the \nmore parties that are in the process, the more agreement that will \nneed to be made). By keeping process implementation details hidden \nbehind the interface, none of those problems exist.&quot;\n\nIncidentally, in UN/CEFACT we have proposed as a hypothesis that all \nmulti-party business scenarios can be decomposed into sets of two-\nparty interactions with all coordination activities being the \n*internal* responsibility of any party with dependent commitments \nwith multiple other parties.\n\nWe have a set of test cases to explore:\n(a) all-or-nothing orders with dependent requirements from multiple \nparties\n(b) domestic and international shipping involving many parties\n(c) distributed meeting-time negotiation.\n\n(a) was completed at a meeting in Washington DC last week.\nDocumentation is in process.\n(b) domestic shipping was sketched out informally at the same meeting.\n(c) remains to be done.\n\nOther test cases are welcome.\n\n2. As a corollary, I am very skeptical of the examples that BPEL et \nal use for their multi-party business scenarios.  They seem to tailor \nthem to demonstrate their multi-party choreography capabilities, \nrather than figuring out what is the best way to business.  As you \nwrite, the number of parties in the process, the more agreements need \nto be made, and lawyers will be involved in each agreement where \nmoney is riding on the wire.\n\n3. I am very skeptical in general that the flavor of procedural \nworkflow that is used for internal document-shuffling is suited to \nexternal business conversations.  RosettaNet tried it and abandoned \nit - exceptions got too tangled.  There is another style of workflow \n(conversational or action-workflow pioneered by Winograd et al) that \nis suitable for external conversations, but that&#39;s not the kind of \nsoftware products that IBM et al want to repurpose.  Procedural \nworkflow assumes command-and-control.  Wrong assumption.\n\n4. I also like that you differentiate between internal implementation \nand external interface. BPEL says they handle both, and I haven&#39;t \nstudied their stuff in enough detail yet, but they don&#39;t seem to \ndifferentiate clearly in their examples.\n\nThanks again for the stimulating article,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
