I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t see how it changes anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is exactly the way I see it also, which is why I drew the \n&gt; analogy to the session timeout issue.  It seems to me that if \n&gt; you are calling this putative Google query unsafe, then you&#39;d \n&gt; have to call anything that resets a session time-out clock  \n&gt; unsafe too.  Do you?\n\nYou mean a cookie session?  Those are stateful.\n\n&gt; &gt;From my perspective, while the user &quot;did not request the side-effects&quot; \n&gt; explicitly, in this context, the action isn&#39;t of &quot;unexpected significance&quot; \n&gt; either.\n\nAre you sure that the user didn&#39;t request the side-effect?  I believe\nthat they did, because the terms under which they&#39;re using the service\npresumably say this (quick search turns up nothing except a FAQ).  They\nunderstand that they can invoke it 1000 times per day.\n\nWhat if you had a personal proxy which refreshed URIs for you, as\npersonal proxies are allowed to do?  If you&#39;ve got a bunch of queries,\neach with their own URI, this proxy may use up a sizable amount of\n\n&gt; &gt; .... what I didn&#39;t say, but would still try to do, is to\n&gt; &gt; identify the results of each query by a URI, so that I could re-GET\n&gt; &gt; them over and over without those being counted as a hit against my 1000\n&gt; &gt; (unless Google doesn&#39;t want to let you - a distinct possibility, sigh).\n&gt; \n&gt; This is sort of a side-bar issue, but it would probably cost more for \n&gt; Google to keep that resource around than it would to simply re-execute \n&gt; the query. I doubt they&#39;d go for it.\n\nI&#39;d guess it&#39;s at least an order of magnitude cheaper for them to hit\na cache than it is for them to re-query.\n\n&gt; Couldn&#39;t they simply make the results cacheable for 24 hours on an\n&gt; initial GET and be done with it?\n\nNo, because of the aforementioned &quot;unsafe GET&quot; issue.\n\nWell, they could just drop the limit.  They say it&#39;s their for &quot;lack of\nresources&quot;[1], but I don&#39;t buy that.  It&#39;s to test the market for\nqueries.\n\n [1] http://www.google.com/apis/api_faq.html#gen12\n\nTo DJ, &quot;GET should be safe&quot; is not a comment on the resource being\nGETted, it&#39;s a general comment; no consequential state, as determined\nby the server owner, should change as a result of a GET.  Otherwise\npeople would be afraid to click on links.\n\nAnd BTW, I think this thread is well named.  It is shades of grey.  But\nto SOAP proponents who somehow think this validates their approach, it\ndoes not, because you&#39;re not even using POST.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
