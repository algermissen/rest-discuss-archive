(my hunch) that a URI may identify a resource which references\n&gt;    other resources by embedding their URI in its represnetations,\n&gt;    to arbitrarily many recurses of this indirection, or\n&gt;\n&gt;b. (probably Jan&#39;s assumption) that a URI may &#39;identify&#39; a resource\n&gt;    by inference, more like connotation that identification, which I\n&gt;    believe is a trap I stepped into yesterday in trying to navigate\n&gt;    this territory.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nc.  a URI may identify a resource which makes use of other resources to \nproduce its representation.\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
