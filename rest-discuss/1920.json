In there, he said he took out MEPs, and the reason was that\n&gt; REST only defines one.\n\nNo, it was an offlist discussion and the document doesn&#39;t mention REST:\n\nhttp://www.prescod.net/soap/simplesoap\n\n(THAT&#39;S A VERY ROUGH IDEA SO FAR)\n\nFor anyone who doesn&#39;t know, MEP means &quot;Message Exchange Pattern&quot;.\n\n&#39;SOAP 1.2 describes different &quot;message exchange patterns&quot; and even\nallows the implementor to invent new ones. SimpleSOAP uses only one\nmessage exchange pattern, request-reply. On top of this you may of\ncourse build asychronous systems like the current mail system if you\nwish. Therefore, once you declare you are using SimpleSOAP, there is no\nneed to also declare what MEP you are using.&#39;\n\n&gt; If I understood that correctly, I disagree.  REST doesn&#39;t prescribe a\n&gt; MEP, HTTP does.  But clearly the Web benefitted from having such a\n&gt; simple MEP to start with since it hid some complexity from developers\n&gt; (e.g. request/response correlation).  However, that doesn&#39;t mean it\n&gt; requires one.\n\nI don&#39;t know whether there is really anything we disagree upon. My\nopinions on MEP are as follows:\n\n * request/response is the best choice of primitive MEP for a system\nthat depends heavily on the results of dereferencing URIs. Plus, today&#39;s\nInternet topology makes request/response essentially always available\nbut bidirectional asynch is much harder to roll out. Businesses and ISPs\nmostly do not want people outside making connections in, therefore the\nonly way to get information in is through a response to an outgoing\nconnection. (with the exception of email, but we know how happy\nbusinesses are with random people sending email to their employees)\n\n * A highly interoperable system like the Web could have multiple MEPs,\nas long as *all server implementations* support all of them. If you must\n&quot;configure&quot; your client to contact a server by informing it what MEP to\nuse then you are starting down a slippery slope that ends in WSDL and\nUDDI -- not as options but as requirements for getting actual work done.\nThis is what I object to in SOAP.\n\n * Nevertheless, if a system like the Web has only a single MEP, others\ncan built on top of it. Whether these others are standardized or not is\northogonal to whether they are primitive. At the very least,\nnotification should be standardized. Making new MEPs primitive is\nprobably too difficult at this point.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
