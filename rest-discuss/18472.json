wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That does not imply to me that i should expect/look for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; similar =\r\nsemantics in media types for other domains.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; no, it does not imply tha=\r\nt you should expect/look, etc. where is this coming from?\n&gt;\n&gt; You list LE a=\r\ns one of the hypermedia factors. That implied to me that\n&gt; you look for it =\r\n(even if you don&#39;t necessarily expect it) in other\n&gt; media types.\n\nok, yes.=\r\n i *do* find them in other designs and _use_ them in my own\nnew designs. i =\r\nguess i got hung up on &quot;should&quot; and &quot;expect&quot; in a way\nyou didn&#39;t mean. sure=\r\n, these appear other places (transclusion,\nnavigation, URI templating, payl=\r\noad templating, non/idempotent\nrequests, protocol method selection, request=\r\n header manipulation,\ntokenizing of link actions, etc. while HTML offers co=\r\nmmon examples of\nmost of all of these, Atom, VoiceXML, URI-List, HAL, Colle=\r\nction-JSON,\netc. all show examples, too.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Until this conversation i was=\r\n under the, apparently false, assumption\n&gt; that the h-factors list was a co=\r\nllect them all sort of thing. The more\n&gt; h-factors a media type has the bet=\r\nter it is. The first line of the\n&gt; page certainly seems to imply this, &quot;The=\r\n H Factor of a media-type is a\n&gt; measurement of the level of hypermedia sup=\r\nport and sophistication of a\n&gt; media-type.&quot;\n\nyep, that text about &quot;sophisit=\r\nication&quot; is pretty weak, eh? i wrote it\nearly in my experiments and should =\r\nreally update the page, relegate\nsome text to archives, etc.\n\nthe list i pr=\r\nesent there is not meant to be definitive (all\ninclusive). i&#39;m open to new =\r\nideas on how to improve it; both at the\nmembership and the narrative levels=\r\n. and the idea was definitely *not*\nto create a hierarchy with which to jud=\r\nge designs. just as creating a\nset of constraints (color, materials, proces=\r\nsing) for any industrial\ndesign can add structure and cohesion, the factor =\r\nmodel was meant as\nan aide in design and analysis, not as a measure of judg=\r\nement.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; so is this whole discussion about you telling me i have my &quot;sc=\r\noping&quot; wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, maybe. It is hard for me to tell for sure. =\r\nMaybe i am\n&gt; missing something really fundamental.\n\nwell, i suspect the two=\r\n of us are not yet on the same wave-length for\ngeneral terms. the last few =\r\nposts have helped to teach me more about\nyour POV and i suspect it will tak=\r\ne more typing still, that&#39;s all.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i find the distinction less\n&gt;&gt;&gt; com=\r\npelling once you move to describing domains (read: media types)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that ar=\r\ne less visually oriented.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; so, you think transclusion is only &quot;compell=\r\ning&quot; if the output is visual, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; I do find embedding graphical elem=\r\nents in documents and user\n&gt; interfaces (certainly a form a transclusion) c=\r\nompelling. However,\n&gt; there are many other contexts in which various forms =\r\nof transclusion\n&gt; are useful (and therefore compelling. I used the embedded=\r\n image\n&gt; example because we have been using HTML as an example.\n\nyeah, my p=\r\noint here is that compelling or not, these things exist. i\nhave decided to =\r\n*not* attempt to say one or more of these things\nSHOULD or MUST only be use=\r\nd in certain cases (visual rendering only,\netc.). i have treated all the fa=\r\nctors this way. for example, i do not\nsay HTML is inferior because it does =\r\nnot offer support for idempotent\nactions. i do not say that Atom is flawed =\r\nbecause it offers no native\naffordance for templated queries, etc. so &quot;comp=\r\nelling&quot; didn&#39;t enter\ninto my decision on what is included in the H-Factor l=\r\nist.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and &quot;compelling&quot; is your term for measure?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not exactly. A me=\r\nasure of hypermedia capability is compelling to me if\n&gt; i think it would be=\r\n reasonable and useful to ask the question of any\n&gt; media type, regardless =\r\nof domain. =A0For example, i find LT to be an\n&gt; extremely compelling measur=\r\ne to consider when evaluating, comparing\n&gt; and designing media types.\n\ncomp=\r\nelling -&gt; reasonable -&gt; useful  it&#39;s good stuff, but not the kind\nof measur=\r\nes i used when creating the list.\n\nsure, you can create a media type design=\r\n that uses _all_ these, just\none of these, etc. you can even create a reall=\r\ny _ugly_, _unhelpful_\ndesign with them!  my point is to document what&#39;s her=\r\ne and talk about\nhow they are used today.\n\nso, yes, talking about how usefu=\r\nl -&gt; reasonable, etc. some of the\naffordances are in some cases at some per=\r\niod of time for some apps,\netc. is great. that switches from talking about =\r\nwhether an item ought\nto be on my H-Factor *list* to whether an item on my =\r\nH-Factor list\nought to be in a particular *design*; very worthwhile stuff. =\r\nand much\nof that talk will use words like &quot;compelling&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;,\n&quot;appriopr=\r\niate&quot;, &quot;successful&#39;, etc. because that&#39;s how design\nimplementations are eva=\r\nluated.\n\nbut if the talk is to be about whether an item should be on the\nH-=\r\nFactor list at all, then i think the way we talk about these\naffordances is=\r\n different; the measures are different, the\nexamples/evidence are different=\r\n. do transclusion affordances exists in\nsome designs? if so, should this af=\r\nfordance be included in the list of\npossible factors? if yes, why; if not, =\r\nwhy?, etc.\n\n&gt; Hmm... does LE mean &quot;the media type contains a flavor of link=\r\n which\n&gt; will be automatically dereferenced by the canonical consumer&quot;?\n\nth=\r\nat&#39;s an interesting observation. i have not included details on\n_how_ these=\r\n affordances must be treated by clients; only that they\nappear and have a s=\r\nhared understanding between client and server.\nimmediate, deferred, pre-fet=\r\nched, etc. are not included in my\naffordance criteria right now and i do no=\r\nt know of any media type\ndocumentation that defines in-message affordances =\r\nas having these\nconstraints.\n\n"}}
