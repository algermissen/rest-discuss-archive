While I understand that REST is an \nArchitectural Style, and not a specific implementation, it maps well\nto the GET/PUT, etc. of the HTTP headers, and most people seem to\nleave it at that.\n\nAre the two inextricably tied?  Have people built real applications \nusing different, e.g. MQ or other MOM type async transports, than\nHTTP?\n\nThanks\nsdg\n\n\n\n"}}
