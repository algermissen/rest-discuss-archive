In other words, all three aspects of an interface (its  \n&gt; IFaPs) must be &quot;as generic as possible, but not too generic&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may take a while for &quot;application neutrality&quot; to sink in for some  \n&gt; people. That&#39;s OK. So did HATEOAS!\n&gt;\n\nNick - my comment was not that I don&#39;t understand what this term  \nmeans. IMHO, it is too broad to describe what you were trying to  \ndescribe. The fact that this term was used in various contexts does  \nnot change that. When you add a new item to a list of constraints, it  \nof course deserves extra scrutiny. At least on this list, a number of  \npeople sincerely want to understand and debate, and so, let us not  \nworry about &quot;sink in&quot;.\n\nNow that we agree on the media type aspect, let me ask you about  \n&quot;generic identifiers&quot;. (I am ignoring generic protocol operations  \nsince that is same as saying &quot;uniform interface&quot;). What do you mean by  \n&quot;generic identifiers&quot; in the context of REST?\n\nBy the way, since the actual report is not public, it is very very  \ndifficult to understand what this is all about. If this has been  \ndiscussed, please provide public references.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
