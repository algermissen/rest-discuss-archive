The goal is to allow all of our\n&gt;&gt; &gt; customers to access our api so they can get information regarding\n&gt;&gt; &gt; their account/transactions.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Creating the resources seem fairly straight forward. For example, each\n&gt;&gt; &gt; customer can access a list of their transactions via a URL such as:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://webapi.ourdomain.com/customer/123/transactions\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The question I have is how to I secure the application such that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; customer 123 only has access to /customer/123/* ??\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I am developing the application using the RESTEasy framework running\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in Tomcat. I am familiar with basic servlet authentication. However,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we are likely to have more and more customers and do not want to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; modify the web.xml and redeploy for every new customer.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there an approach to configuring multiple client authentication\n&gt;&gt; &gt; without having to redeploy each time?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt; You are likely to get the best help by asking this question on the\n&gt;&gt; RESTeasy user mailing list or forum, where everyone involved will be\n&gt;&gt; more likely to be familiar with that particular technology.  I can\n&gt;&gt; tell you how to do it with Jersey (Java) or Rails (Ruby), but not that\n&gt;&gt; particular framework :-).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Craig McClanahan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff Thorn\n&gt; Thorn Technologies, LLC\n&gt; (443) 255-2803\n&gt; jeff@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
