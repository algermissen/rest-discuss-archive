If the data format and message\n&gt; semantics work for your use case, I would not hesitate to use it in your\n&gt; implementation.\n\nWell actually, despite knowing there actually always will be some \ndifferences in &quot;mapping&quot; a custom data semantics to an existing one, I \nfigured out that, in our given use case, the concepts of Atom and APP \nboth fit better than any other approach I found so far, and, then again, \nseem to be backed by sufficient support (frameworks, documentation, \ntools out there) to eventually provide a reliable foundation being a \n&quot;primary representation&quot; in a prototype system that doesn&#39;t want to come \nup with a custom / proprietary API which essentially wouldn&#39;t do much \nmore than re-inventing things like workspaces, feeds, entries, \ncategories (one of the things about Atom that definitely got me \nenthusiastic about it when I started dealing with it) or representations \naccepted when POSTing things to a certain resource.\n\nSo far, my only real doubt here was, after reading through all the posts \nI found out there, that Atom / APP might not be &quot;state of the art&quot; here \nanymore. AFAICT, most of the frameworks and librares I stumbled across \n(in the Java/Java EE world) seem not to have seen major updates in a \nwhile. I simply wouldn&#39;t like to do an up-front design of a new system \nbuilt upon something obsolete in the beginning. So far, your comments \nhave merely convinced me that going with Atom / APP seems a good \nstarting point initially.\n\n\n&gt; Other media type designs that you might want to check out are HAL[1]\n&gt; and Collection+JSON[2]. Both aim at similar space and have markedly\n&gt; different approaches.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\n&gt; [2] http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/\n\nThanks very much for the pointers. I&#39;ll have a look for sure and see \nwhether one of these (or both) might come in at least as an alternative \nrepresentation usable by clients that can&#39;t / don&#39;t want to work with \nAtom. At first sight, especially HAL seems promising; curious to work \nwith this a bit. :)\n\nThanks again, all the best!\nKristian\n\n"}}
