I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I \n&gt;&gt;&gt; used REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On the surface, looks like a good match but how do I use REST to make \n&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple updates in a single atomic operation? I can see how I&#39;d pull \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the entry for bnewport from a cache, but what about all the records \n&gt;&gt;&gt; whose age is &gt; 37?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Simply build an API that supports that. There&#39;s no reason why you\n&gt;&gt; can&#39;t POST multiple datums at once. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But you don&#39;t have to do that, see below. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC? \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records per server \n&gt;&gt;&gt; interaction and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I could solve it \n&gt;&gt;&gt; using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see lots of \n&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Build a transaction API; for example: \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   POST /transaction          =&gt; transaction id \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; now put some data into it: \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;&gt;   somedata \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;&gt;   moredata \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   POST /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;&gt;   evenmoredata \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; now commit it: \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   GET /transaction/{trnid}  =&gt; transaction representation \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   PUT /transaction/{trnid}\n&gt;&gt;   {transaction representation} \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I would say that you&#39;ve misunderstood REST. It&#39;s not as complicated as\n&gt;&gt; you think it is. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, one of the advantages of REST with HTTP was compatibility with \n&gt; HTTP security like web seal etc. Your suggestion above hides the records in \n&gt; the transaction representation which looks no better than SOAP in terms of \n&gt; leveraging HTTP caching, security etc. \n\nThere isn&#39;t normally much caching with POST.\n\n\nI can&#39;t see why the above stops you doing security.\n\n\n\n&gt; These looks like pluses to me as REST \n&gt; can leverage these builtin HTTP services. \n\nAbsolutely. It&#39;s also just easier to do. Making a SOAP client/server\nto do what I was talking about would be significant. The REST code is\njust some handler.\n\n\n&gt; I thought unless the record keys etc are encoded in the URL then I\n&gt; may as well use SOAP, no?\n\nNo. Resources can be anything.\n\n\nBear in mind that my transaction design was just one way. A pretty\nobvious mapping between the concept of a transaction and REST. As\nother people have pointed out, you don&#39;t have to do it that way.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
