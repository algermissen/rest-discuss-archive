This second approach would\nlikely be cleaner anyhow...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Auth-POST submits form\n&gt; &gt;    {uri} must be a parent URI of the URI that will be deleted (which is\n&gt; &gt;    passed in the form itself).  Response returns the equivalent of\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;GET /client?{uri}&quot; (minus the deleted resource).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This looks more or less like the approach that I use as far as treating\n&gt; UI element as resources.  I&#39;d probably change the syntax of your URI\n&gt; namespace, but that&#39;s just personal perference (i.e, I cant give a good\n&gt; reason why you shouldn&#39;t do it the way you are).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the\nvalue\n&gt; &gt;of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}\n&gt; &gt;        returns the main menu options\n&gt; &gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/settings}\n&gt; &gt;        returns a static view of the current settings.\n&gt; &gt;    GET /client/editform?uri={/{id}/settings}\n&gt; &gt;        returns a form for editing changes.\n&gt; &gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n&gt; &gt;        returns a static list of the agreements.\n&gt; &gt;    GET /client/addform?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n&gt; &gt;        returns form to add an agreement.\n&gt; &gt;    etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; These seem fine, although I personally would change the structure of the\n&gt; URIs to something like\n&gt;    GET /client/menu?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/settingsviewer?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/settingseditor?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/agreementscreator?id={id}\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, this is just a reflection of the way I&#39;m doing things now - I\n&gt; can&#39;t give any justification for doing it one way or the other (other\n&gt; than it makes more sense to me).  (It also assumes that I haven&#39;t\n&gt; misinterpreted the intent of the examples you gave.)\n\nExcept in my examples above, which I don&#39;t think I have made very clear\n(sorry) is that {/{id}/access} would actually be something like\n&quot;http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/access&quot; (notice the last part of the\npath).  As a result, above examples would look more like:\n\nGET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/access\nGET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/settings\nGET /client/editform?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/settings\nGET /client?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/agreements\nGET /client/addform?uri=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/agreements\n\nThis would also allow the client&#39;s host server to be independent, meaning  I\ncould access an RNA interface on http://example.invalid from\nhttp://www.sample.invalid.  Now, I suppose you could have something like:\n\nGET /client/menu?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/\nGET /client/settingsviewer?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/\nGET /client/settingseditor?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/\nGET /client/agreementsviewer?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/\nGET /client/agreementscreator?id=http://example.invalid/rna/seairth/\n\nHowever, what would the URI be when you wanted to work with a specific\nagreement?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
