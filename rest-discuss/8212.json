Thus the GET is idempotent as it\n&gt; &gt; always refers to the next number in the sequence, and the design you\n&gt; &gt; mentioned is fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But the notion of &quot;next&quot; implies state. I&#39;m not sure whether you&#39;re\n&gt; proposing this state exists on the client or the server. If the latter,\n&gt; though, I think this would change the result for all clients, and that\n&gt; would be bad. It should be POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this a random sequence or a predetermined sequence? If random, I\n&gt; could see GET; but if it&#39;s a predetermined sequence I think POST is\n&gt; required.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
