I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I \n&gt; used REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the surface, looks like a good match but how do I use REST to make \n&gt; multiple updates in a single atomic operation? I can see how I&#39;d pull \n&gt; the entry for bnewport from a cache, but what about all the records \n&gt; whose age is &gt; 37?\n\nSimply build an API that supports that. There&#39;s no reason why you\ncan&#39;t POST multiple datums at once.\n\nBut you don&#39;t have to do that, see below.\n\n\n&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC? \n&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records per server \n&gt; interaction and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I could solve it \n&gt; using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see lots of \n&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol. \n&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\n\nBuild a transaction API; for example:\n\n  POST /transaction          =&gt; transaction id\n\nnow put some data into it:\n\n  POST /transaction/{trnid}\n  somedata\n\n  POST /transaction/{trnid}\n  moredata\n\n  POST /transaction/{trnid}\n  evenmoredata\n\nnow commit it:\n\n  GET /transaction/{trnid}  =&gt; transaction representation\n\n  PUT /transaction/{trnid}\n  {transaction representation}\n\n\nI would say that you&#39;ve misunderstood REST. It&#39;s not as complicated as\nyou think it is.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
