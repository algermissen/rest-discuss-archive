The service implementation deals\n&gt;  &gt; with processing application data, often represented as an XML\n&gt;  &gt; element, and the service doesn&#39;t know whether that data came inside a\n&gt;  &gt; SOAP envelope, HTTP GET, or HTTP POST. WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding enables\n&gt;  &gt; you to expose a service as a resource to be invoked using HTTP\n&gt;  &gt; methods. At the same time, you need to understand that HTTP binding\n&gt;  &gt; doesn&#39;t enable you to implement a full REST style system. This is\n&gt;  &gt; often debated by a lot of people, and it all depends on how much you\n&gt;  &gt; believe in what REST can deliver.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This at least seems to show the author is aware that what WSDL 2\n&gt;  &gt; supports is POX over HTTP, not REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Eran is one of the Axis2 team...he&#39;s probably implemented that very feature.\n&gt;                    \n\n\n\n-- \nDavanum Srinivas :: http://davanum.wordpress.com\n\n"}}
