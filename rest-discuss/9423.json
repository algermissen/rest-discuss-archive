I thought I was quite careful to say the opposite. XML most \ndeifnitely doesn;t do everything, but what it can&#39;t do (with a couple of \ninteresting if esoteric exceptions) JSON can&#39;t do either.\n\nI remain unimpressed by the claims people make that JSON is easier. I&#39;ve \nworked with both, and it doesn&#39;t seem so to me. JSON may be easier than \nDOM, but it is not easier than XML.\n\nThe claims of JSON&#39;s superiority seem mostly based on confusing XML with \nDOM on the one hand, while refusing to learn what XML actually is. \nDevelopers like to be able to just shove JSON into JavaScript and not \nleanr anything new. Of course, evaling JSON as JavaScript doesn&#39;t \nactually work, but most developers haven&#39;t noticed that yet.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
