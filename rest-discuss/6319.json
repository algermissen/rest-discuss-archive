I&#39;m trying to do this programmatically.\n\nYou&#39;re trying to write an SSL/TLS client?\n\nThat seems wrong. You should just use JSSE&#39;s\njavax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection to open a connection like so:\n\n   URL u = new URL(&quot;https://server/someplace&quot;);\n   URLConnection uc = u.connect();\n\nThis does all the work for you as long as the JSSE client is already\nset up.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m trying a REST mc - mc transaction, and I guess I want either both way\n&gt; checks, or minimally I want the server to verify the client?\n&gt; this was the opposite of Marks (more usual?) scenario where the client\n&gt; needs to trust the server.\n\nMark&#39;s scenario was the normal one. The client and the server setup a\nsecurely authenticated channel with encryption on the top. If your\napplication needs authentication then the client can do normal HTTP\nauthentication over the top of SSL.\n\nDon&#39;t go to client certificates because that complicates things more\nfrom the client end and you can always put it in later.\n\n\n&gt; I think this is where Nic&#39;s story comes in? I need to export\n&gt; (from the server keystore) a public key with an alias for use on the client\n&gt; as Nic suggests.\n\nI think you&#39;re getting really confused about this.\n\n\n&gt; ideally I&#39;d like to use a self certification (using the Java tools) but\n&gt; we couldn&#39;t get the java keystore values  into the IIS &#39;store&#39;.\n&gt; Could be that IIS just won&#39;t play with Java (Sun).\n\nNo.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
