Namely:\n&gt;\n&gt; - What do you think of the idea of having an interface definition\n&gt; language for REST services ? It seems some people outright reject the\n&gt; idea, while others support it in the form of WADL.\n&gt; It seems to me something like that would be nice to have, allowing for\n&gt; example Yahoo, Google and Microsoft to agree on a unified API for\n&gt; searches, that would be published using the IDL of choice. Client\n&gt; could then switch fairly easily from an implementation to another.\n&gt; Which leads to my second question...\n\nOlivier,\n\n1. signature!=interface. The original definition by D.L. Parnas\ndefined interface as signature+semantics. In the absence of a formal\nlanguage to define the semantics of a communication, all you are left\nwith is things to try and stabilise the signature (WSDL) or to\ndescribe some of the communications protocol.\n\n2. WSDL encouraged an explosion of service interfaces, which, as we\nall know, was a mistake. Why not not just assume that everyone and\neverything will adopt APP and built your services to integrate with\nthat?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - Is there any ongoing attempt at establishing a standard for service\n&gt; registries ? If we were to have that kind of domain-specific\n&gt; standardized services, it would probably be interesting to have\n&gt; registries of interesting service interfaces along with running\n&gt; implementations. Which could be automatically tested for liveness by\n&gt; the registry, possibly using information from the IDL (testing\n&gt; published resources actually are there and respond to advertised\n&gt; verbs, etc).\n\nOh olivier, we dont want to go there again.\n\n&gt; Sorry if this sound very naive, as I said, I&#39;m a newcomer. I did read\n&gt; the previous thread about WADL but it seemed to drift to a discussion\n&gt; of the merits of WADL itself and not IDLs for REST in general.\n&gt; --\n\nI think you need consensus on what constitutes an interface before you\ncan worry about an IDL.\n\n"}}
