OAuth was designed to allow access to RESTful APIs (among\n&gt; other things).  You state:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have looked at both OAuth and OpenID, but they do not seem to have a good\n&gt; story for automated agents as they focus on having human interaction in a\n&gt; browser session.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is true of OpenID but not of OAuth.  OAuth explicitly separates the\n&gt; step of a user granting authorization (which has a standard in-browser flow,\n&gt; and can also be accomplished through out of band means) and the use of that\n&gt; authorization, as embodied in an access token, at some point in the future.\n&gt; So for example, you can take the results of the in-browser authorization\n&gt; step and then, potentially, use them in server-to-server calls for the next\n&gt; several months, even if the user never logs in again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not a security expert, but I have been musing how to federate\n&gt; regular HTTP Digest Auth for a little while for RESTful applications\n&gt; and have posted my thoughts [1].\n&gt;\n&gt; For all I know, this has been thought of before or already debunked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, feedback welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://tinyurl.com/fedauth\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
