From rfc2616 sec 9.7:  &quot;The DELETE method\nrequests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the\nRequest-URI.&quot;  If the URI in question represents the object being subscribed to\nrather than the subscription itself, then the meaning of the DELETE is now\nambiguous and probably not easily disabiguated.\n\nMy suggestion:  if the resource of interest is\n\n   /resource\n\nthen its server-side subscriptions are represented under a collection\n\n  /resource/subs\n\nand each shows up as\n\n  /resource/subs/&lt;someid&gt;\n\n* Getting a subscription is a process of doing a POST to /resource/subs.\n* Getting the list of subs ifor resource s a GET on /resource/subs.\n* The state of a sub can be changed by an appropriate POST to\n/resource/subs/&lt;someid&gt;.\n* A sub can be cancelled via a DELETE on /resource/subs/&lt;someid&gt;\n\nAuthentication of any / all of these operations is an orthogonal issue, handled in\nany of the usual ways.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
