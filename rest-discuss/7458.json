Thoroughly specified\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; schemas describing almost every possible Purchase Order Request\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Response. Guess how long it takes one large computer\n&gt; manufacturer to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shake out enough impedance mismatches to get going with each new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trading partner? 30-60 days, and that is a dedicated team of\n&gt; experts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and\n&gt; resolving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bad standards exist, therefore standards are bad. Nice logic.\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a valid conclusion. RosettaNet is not a bad\n&gt; &gt; standard. As I wrote in another post, it is the third generation of\n&gt; &gt; ecommerce standards that each tried to learn from and resolve the\n&gt; &gt; problems of the previous generation. Each was better than its\n&gt; &gt; predecessor. So by the Microsoft rule, RosettaNet should have been\n&gt; &gt; pretty good.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s just a difficult problem.\n&gt; Exactly. RosettaNet is a great standard... the apotheosis of this\n&gt; style of exchanging full documents. My point is that style is not\n&gt; scalable, and that APP is using the same approach, on a smaller scale.\n\nI would suggest that by definition any standard that takes &quot;30-60 days&quot;\nof &quot;experts exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and\nresolving the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents&quot; is a\nbad standard. That doesn&#39;t mean the people are bad. It doesn&#39;t mean that\nthe ideas were bad. It just means that all the necessary ingredients of\nstandard prepration haven&#39;t come together in that problem domain as yet.\n\nIf it is working at all for anyone, I suppose it can&#39;t be all bad. Over\nseveral more versions it may either become a good standard or form the\ngroundwork for a family of good standards. However it can&#39;t presently be\ncalled good in the way that html is good. HTML works in a now familar\nproblem domain and can rely on common understanding and shared\nmotivation between participants about what features are necessary and\nwhat they should look like. Standards like these can be scaled up with a\nminimum of effort to a large number of users.\n\nThat is not to say that HTML was always a good standard. It needed to\nevolve over time as more users placed more demands on it, and it did. It\nalso drew on earlier document standards and deployed hypertext systems\nas a grounding for development.\n\nLet me take your comments at their merit though. Hugh, you suggest that\nthe style of communication where people get together and agree on a\ndocument format before communication takes place is not scalable. I&#39;ll\npay that in some respects. In the sense that we have clearly have good\nstandards today that scale up remarkably well, you are clearly mistaken.\nHowever the process of standardisation is only as scalable as available\nprocesses of human interaction and participation. That is to say it\ntends to fracture on socio-political grounds.\n\nBusiness is a hard problem-domain to crack because there are so many\npeople with different ideas about what business is. They each have their\nown ways of working. They have their own management styles, styles of\ndealing with clients and suppliers. They have their own vocabularies, so\nit is hard coming up with a common vocabulary that means the same thing\nto everyone. It&#39;s like coming up with a document format for common law\ncontracts. It can only be defined at a very high level with the real\nsemantics being hidden somewhere in human-readable text.\n\nAtom is not in the business league. It is smaller and targetted to a set\nof people who already know what a &quot;blog&quot; is, and can talk about it in\nterms familiar to each other. It has still to pass the test of time that\nHTML has and see off challenges such as hAtom, but I do tentatively\nconsider atom to be a good document standard.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
