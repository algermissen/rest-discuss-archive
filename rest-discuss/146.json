For\n&gt; example, if subscribed to stock quotes, periodic notifications that the\n&gt; &#39;value fetcher&#39; has some transient errors might be useful. These would be\n&gt; indicated in a status code in the asynch response. Or is subscription\n&gt; fundamentally different than intermediate responses to an asynchronous\n&gt; operation?\n\nI think that our current idea is that you are asking when the thing\nchanges, perhaps with some filter so that you only get notifications\nwhen it changes in a more significant sense (e.g. above some price\nboundary).\n\nIf you want to follow a long-running process like a purchase order\nfloating through a company getting digital signatures, then I think you\nwould subscribe to a URI that represents its status.\n\n/purchase-orders/po234212/status\n\nMake sense?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
