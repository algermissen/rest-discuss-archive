He talked me through it and the gist was that he  \ncould use (something like) XMPP for events AND polling. That way the  \nloss of an event isn&#39;t disastrous, and HTTP does all the heavy lifting.\n\nI don&#39;t know if this is applicable to your domain, but it was a neat  \nsolution that really appealed to me.\n\nJim\n\n"}}
