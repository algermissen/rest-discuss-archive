I don&#39;t\nthink there is any mention of state or statelessness in the SOAP spec.\nI think a SOAP service can be just as statefull as a REST resource.  Am\nI missing something here?\n\nI&#39;m also not sure what you mean by &quot;By definition [SOAP Services] are no\nobjects&quot;.  I don&#39;t want to get argument about what an object is or\nisn&#39;t, but SOAP services are something you can use for doing object\noriented decomposition of a problem, whether or not its stateless.\n\nToivo\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: inthedarkplace [mailto:inthedarkplace@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With REST you can&#39;t just take any Java/C++/C# Object and turn it\n&gt; into an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easily used network accessible &quot;thing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually you can and I do it all the time. I have automated tools\n&gt; which can automagically generate the REST code given an object&#39;s\n&gt; class. Also note that SOAP services are stateless. By definition they\n&gt; are not objects. Resources have states and they expose methods\n&gt; (DoGet, DoPut, DoDelete, DoPost, DoTrace, DoOptions) which constitute\n&gt; behavior. After having done a lot of SOAP and REST hacking it&#39;s\n&gt; evident to me and my team that REST is far more object oriented than\n&gt; SOAP. In REST you work with real objects, in SOAP you&#39;re essentially\n&gt; working with a class that defines arbitrary static methods.\n\n\n\n"}}
