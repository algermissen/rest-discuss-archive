There is a software running on the board that\n&gt; &gt; will take in a text and figures out which switches to toggle so as  \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; display the text on the board.\n&gt;\n&gt; Definitely makes sense, but therein lies my point. If the only thing\n&gt; the board can do (or can happen to the board) is the toggling of\n&gt; switches then it&#39;s a POST(?) with the text to change too end of story.\n&gt;\n\nIt depends on how do you model this. POST creates resources, if the  \ntest is a resource itself that&#39;s fine, but if the resource is the  \nboard and the text has the role of board state data, then you&#39;d PUT to  \nthe board to update its state.\n\n&gt; If I can manipulate in a different way how do I then distinguish\n&gt; between changing text and doing something else?\n&gt;\n\nYou need to model your data in a resource-oriented manner, it depends.  \nResources may be ad-hoc, may map clearly to a regular data-model, or  \ncan be logical as /releseases/latest.tar.gz, or &quot;abstract&quot; as  \ntransactions.\n\nFor example you may decide that\n\n   /board/{id}/leds/{x,y}\n\nis a resource with an on/off flag... It&#39;s up to you. Constraints are:  \nROA, correct usage HTTP verbs and HTTP status codes, etc. HTTP is  \nfixed, the ROA part is the one that is movable.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
