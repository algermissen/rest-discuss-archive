As much as SOAP people seem to\n&gt; keep insisting otherwise, the www is real and it works.\n&gt; \n\nYou (and others) really have to stop using this &quot;the www is real and it \nworks&quot; to answer every difficulty that application developers come \nacross when trying to apply a RESTful architecture to their problem \ndomain.  Its just totally unproductive.  The fact of the matter is the \nvast majority of the Web is a one-to-one relationship between client and \nserver.  In other words, the Web is a simple system.  As a result you \nhave a lot of simple answers to simple problems.  These integration \nproblems are real and I think REST can solve many of them in a better way.\n\nAnd stop trashing the SOAP stacks.  SOAP specs define real requirements \nand distributed computing problems.  Sure, the design and implementation \nof the SOAP stacks suck, but the problems they try and address are real. \n  I believe REST can solve these problems in a better way, but the Web \nis not a superset of these problems.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
