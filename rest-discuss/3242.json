He&#39;s recieved near\n&gt; universal acclaim for doing so. If you buy into TBL&#39;s strong claim\n&gt; (URI opacity is an axiom), or Paul Prescod&#39;s weaker variant (peeking\n&gt; into URIs is a bad idea), then what Jon&#39;s done is a nasty hack (a la\n&gt; screenscraping), and not has popular opinion has it, a neat hack.\n&gt; Either way, this hack seems to offer considerable, immediate, utility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe this an issue that needs to be punted onto the TAG. It seems\n&gt; the web has a constaint over and above any of REST&#39;s (is that a first?).\n\nThe problem here is not that Jon extracted information out of the URI.  The\nproblem is that Jon is relying on Amazon to not change it&#39;s URIs in a way\nthat will break his technique.  Had Amazon said &quot;one can extract ISBNs from\nour URIs thus&quot;, then no one would be saying that what Jon did was a hack.\nThis all goes back to the/my thought that as long as the server (or server&#39;s\nauthority) dictates how a given URI is composed, then it should be perfectly\nfine to extract information out of the URI.\n\nAs to whether the URI (or class of URIs) is opaque, I still think that they\nare.  As long as the client conforms to the composition rule(s) given by the\nserver (the simplest case being a URI whose only rule is &quot;this is the URI&quot;),\nthen I don&#39;t see how those constructed URIs would be any different than if\nthe server returned all possible combinations that matched the given\ncomposition rule(s).  Either way, they would still be &quot;opaque&quot;.  It&#39;s only\nwhen the client attempts to go outside of the composition rules that we get\nin trouble.\n\nBack to Jon&#39;s example above, Amazon has implictly told us (as most sites\nimplicitly do) that the only rule for their URIs is &quot;this is the URI&quot;\n(ignoring any generated via a form or javascript).  Jon went outside of the\nrules that Amazon provided, thus he is violating the opacity that TimBL\ntalks about.\n\nIMHO, of course.... :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
