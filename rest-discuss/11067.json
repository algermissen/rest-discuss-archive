This seems incorrect to me.\n\nMy initial code against this server was clearing the local cache on\nPOST/PUT and then doing a GET request w/ the ETag and getting a 304\nresponse from the remote server.  The end result is no body document\nfor this URI in my local cache. To fix this, I changed my code to\nignore the ETag returned on POST/PUT when attempting to update my\nlocal cache w/ a GET.\n\nWas my initial code faulty?  Is returning an ETag in POST/PUT response\nw/ an empty body standard practice?\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback.\n\n-- \nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n"}}
