What diff does it make if the form came from the form\n&gt; processing resource or was (for example) a standard invoice form, as\n&gt; long as both client and server can handle it?\n\nI guess I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re asking.  A standard invoice\nform could be used, of course, as long as it had a media type.\n\n&gt; What I liked about the direction of RDF Forms was that the combination\n&gt; of a media type and a form could pretty fully describe not only the\n&gt; POST message but also the result of a GET on the resulting resource.\n&gt; In other words, a 2-way resource type description.\n\nIf I understand you, RDF Forms doesn&#39;t do the latter.  It just says\n&quot;Send this media type here&quot;.  If there&#39;s any &quot;resulting resource&quot;\n(e.g. if a 201 response resulted from the POST of that media type),\nthe server may or may not choose to make representations of that\nresource available using the input media type.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
