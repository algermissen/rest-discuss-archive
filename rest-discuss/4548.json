HTTP provides a protocol that can be used REST-fully\nin many ways, but it can also be used non-REST-fully.  I don&#39;t know\nthe Jabber protocol, but you may be able to use that REST-fully also.\n\nI find it interesting that you are distributing transactions.  I had\nbeen thinking of transactions as local to a peer and not materializing\non other peers until they were committed (so only a client could hold\na URI for any object within the transaction).\n\nWhere I have complex objects, e.g., a red-black tree, I make each\nnode of the tree a first class object and give it a URI IFF I want\nto be able to have the tree span peers.  So, while a complex data\nstructure such as a tree may span peers, an object is never partially\nrepresented a given peer.\n\nI use &quot;local objects&quot; iff the data is always to be materialized\nwith the generic object.  For example, the property bindings of\na generic object are always materialized with the generic object,\nso they are modeled as &quot;local&quot; objects (strict containment).\n\nThanks,\n\n-bryan\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Ryan Fugger &lt;rfugger@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanks for the reply.

Do you need \nto  \n&gt; &gt; access the same host several times for performance and only \nswitch hosts  \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; reliability in the face of a host failure?\n&gt; \n&gt; No, different hosts each holding their aspect of distributed \nobjects is  \n&gt; integral to the application.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It sounds like we should talk about what capabilities a single \nserver is\n&gt; &gt; providing.\n&gt; \n&gt; A server hosts multiple nodes that each communicate with many \nneighbouring  \n&gt; nodes (&quot;friends&quot; with which they can exchange IOUs).  Nodes may \nalso  \n&gt; communicate with a strange node to pay or receive payment from that \nnode.   \n&gt; Payments are made by passing IOUs along paths connecting two \nstrange nodes  \n&gt; in the network of neighbours.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You may need a proxy that forwards requests to the current\n&gt; &gt; hosting server, or possibly returns a Location header with \nthe &#39;new&#39;\n&gt; &gt; location.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since trust is such an integral issue with this application, there \nmust be  \n&gt; a mechanism to change any server that proves untrustworthy, \nincluding  \n&gt; proxy servers.  Changing proxy servers then has all the same  \n&gt; identifier-renaming problems as changing servers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like I said, as hard as I&#39;ve tried to make it work, it just seems \nthat  \n&gt; REST is inappropriate for the application.  I&#39;m actually looking \nat  \n&gt; bypassing HTTP altogether and using something like Jabber for \npersistent  \n&gt; XML messaging sessions between servers.  Very unRESTful, I know, \nbut it  \n&gt; would be soooo appealingly simple...\n&gt; \n&gt; Ryan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
