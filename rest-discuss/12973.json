A browser for example has q=\r\nuite some automatic behaviour that results from implementing the processing=\r\n\n&gt;     model of HTML (load images, load stylesheets, execute JavaScript, do=\r\n page reloads based on &lt;meta&gt; tags, etc.) All that changes for the non-huma=\r\nn case is that media types would specify richer\n&gt;     application semantics=\r\n (because there is no user involved to decide what this or that link means)=\r\n.\n&gt;    \n&gt;     If there is no human to understand &lt;a href=3D&quot;/all-versions&quot;&gt;=\r\nClick me to see all versions&lt;/a&gt; then all you need is to standardize someth=\r\ning like &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/linkreks/\n&gt;     all-versions&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;/all-versions&quot;&gt;.\n&gt;    \n&gt;     Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; This last sentence is one of many =\r\ncrucial differences between the design for human-oriented resources and the=\r\n design for machine-oriented resources. =C2=A0The &quot;interface&quot; for humans is=\r\n free text to be\n&gt; understood at &quot;run time&quot;. =C2=A0The &quot;Interface&quot; for comp=\r\nuters must come through some previously agreed to keywords that appear in a=\r\n previously agreed to at &quot;design time.&quot;\n\nWhile the interface might be *code=\r\nd to* based on keywords that come in\nsome interface-description document at=\r\n &quot;design time&quot;, the runtime\nimplementation should still come through hyperm=\r\nedia that has the same\nkeywords at &quot;run time&quot;.\n\nIn this sense, it&#39;s not sub=\r\nstantially different from a human client. \n\nAs a human, you know from previ=\r\nous run-time experience (a sort of ad-hoc\n&quot;design time&quot; document, if you wi=\r\nll) that if you see a &quot;checkout with\ncredit card&quot; link, upon clicking on it=\r\n you expect to see a form with a\ncard number, expiration date and other fie=\r\nlds.  These days, you also\nexpect to see a CCV field (interface versioning/=\r\nmigration).\nnn\nAs an automated client, you know from the design document th=\r\nat if you\nsee a &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/checkout/&quot; href=3D=E2=80=A6=\r\n&gt;, upon navigating\nit, you expect to see a form with a rough schema like:\n\n=\r\n   form :=3D cc_number_field + expiration_date_field [ + ccv_field ] + =E2=\r\n=80=A6\n\n\nIn either cases, seeing a link that said &quot;Frobnigate the Whatsit!&quot;=\r\n  or\n&lt;http://example.com/frobnigate/&gt; =E2=80=A6 or encountering a form that=\r\n was\nreally a question of trivial pursuit =E2=80=A6 would confuse the clien=\r\nt.\n\nMoreover, getting one of the lower-frequency but still valid responses\n=\r\n(3xx, 503 + Retry-After, 101, &c.) would not confuse either the\nautomated c=\r\nlient or the user&#39;s agent.\n\n\nAs to the idea of &quot;information architect&quot; =E2=\r\n=80=A6 I&#39;d agree that the\nrequirements on a resource space for automated an=\r\nd human clients are\ndifferent =E2=80=A6 I think the question is &quot;how differ=\r\nent&quot;?  A lot of people\nhave a &quot;web ui&quot; and a &quot;REST API&quot;, and it&#39;s not clear=\r\n why the REST API\nisn&#39;t just an additional layer or refinement within the &quot;=\r\nweb ui&quot;.  Take\nflickr, for instance.  If the key links and HTML forms in th=\r\neir HTML UI\nhad e.g., &lt;a href=3D=E2=80=A6 rel=3D=E2=80=A6&gt;, &lt;link rel=3D=E2=\r\n=80=A6&gt; and other attributes, couldn&#39;t\nan automated client consume it just =\r\nas well?  It seems like supporting\none interface is better than two.  I don=\r\n&#39;t have any practical experience\ntrying something like this, however, so pe=\r\nrhaps it breaks down rather\nquickly.\n\n-- \n...jsled\nhttp://asynchronous.org/=\r\n - a=3Djsled; b=3Dasynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}\n\r\n--=-=-=\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--=-=-=--\r\n\n"}}
