In other words, I don&#39;t believe\n&gt;&gt; in doing content negotiation on the Accept-Language header (for\n&gt;&gt; usability reasons).\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t *think* that&#39;s what Claude said. Having a separate URI and NOT\n&gt; doing content neg is not the same thing.\n&gt;\nI may have misinterpreted what Claude was saying, but I think you  \nunderstood what I was saying. What do you mean by, &quot;Having a separate  \nURI and NOT doing content neg is not the same thing.&quot;?\n\n&gt; Best practice in this area is surely:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://www.example.com/somepage\n&gt;\n&gt; where somepage has:\n&gt;\n&gt;   somepage.fr.html\n&gt;   somepage.en.html\n&gt;\n&gt; and content neg is used to abritrate between them. The Location header\n&gt; specifies the fixed location of the negotiated page. A lot of people\n&gt; seem to encode any links in such pages in the specific locale of the\n&gt; page but I think that&#39;s just because of the authoring tools. It&#39;s\n&gt; better to keep the plain uri because cool uri&#39;s don&#39;t change.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we&#39;ve been over all this quite a few times. You might want to\n&gt; check the archives.\n&gt;\nI know my philosophy goes against the approach that seems recommended  \nby the HTTP spec by its examples of content negotiation being done on  \nAccept-Language. From a usability perspective, however, I believe  \ntaking that approach in my particular design case inappropriate.  \nWe&#39;re creating a network of sites, and each site will have one and  \nonly one locale. So if there&#39;s a English article on site A, the  \nFrench translation of it, if any, would be on site B. Since each one  \nof these sites will be mono-lingual, it doesn&#39;t make sense to do  \ncontent negotiation on Accept-Language. Nevertheless, I will know if  \nthere&#39;s a French translation, and if they mention they prefer French  \nover English in the Accept-Language header, I&#39;d like to be nice and  \nmention to them that there&#39;s a French version of this article over at  \nthis URI at site B. I may decide to do that if I notice that the  \nrequest is coming from an IP address in France, if that&#39;s something  \nusers find useful.\n\n&gt; I think this is silly. You are ignoring all the work that lots of\n&gt; people have done making content negotiation work for people who speak\n&gt; different languages.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not supported well enough because there are too many people who\n&gt; accept the english speaking web. Support the standards and things will\n&gt; improve!\n&gt;\nI think I am supporting the standard. In my case there isn&#39;t a French  \nrepresentation of the English article at that URI. By requesting that  \nURI you are asking for an article in English, and I&#39;ll send you one.\n\nI definitely want to have lots of different languages being spoken in  \nour network, but as I said, each site will be for users&#39; who can  \ninteract in a particular language.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would this be the RESTful way to think about personalization of\n&gt;&gt; resources based on content negotiation?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think so. I think that you&#39;re methods won&#39;t be idempotent and\n&gt; that&#39;s anti-REST.\n&gt;\nWhy wouldn&#39;t the methods be idempotent?\n\n&gt; However, I will admit I have a hard time undestanding how\n&gt; personalization can fit into REST. Client side script seems to be the\n&gt; best solution.\n&gt;\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard. The reason I brought this up is I can&#39;t  \npersonally see much difference between customizing a resource for  \nuser&#39;s preferred language (via Accept-Language content negotiation)  \nand customizing it by mentioning their first name in a Welcome  \nmessage. Why would one be a blessed-by-the-spec representation of the  \nresource and the other be blatant disrespect of the spirit of HTTP  \nand REST? One reason I can imagine this might be the case is that  \nthese kinds of customization are not intended by (or mentioned by)  \nthe HTTP designers.\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to do over HTTP, though, is give the user the best  \nexperience by looking at whatever information comes in with a request  \n(IP address, cookies, Accept-Language, referrer, whatever) and  \nprovide the most useful representation of the requested resource.\nIf I give a unique ETag to each variant, then I think caching should  \nwork, and conceptually to me it just feels like each of these are  \npersonalized representations of a resource. What would doing this  \nbreak? What would be the downside?\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
