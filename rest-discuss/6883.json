You can do anything you like. But recall that PUT defines the\n&gt; entire state of the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; So are you saying that I can&#39;t update only one field in a resource using PUT\n&gt; but I have to have the &quot;entire&quot; resource passed back on forth?  \n\nCorrect\n\n&gt; If so, how then does one define the &quot;entire&quot; resource?  In some enterprise\n&gt; systems, I can envision an entire resource being HUGE and often not easily\n&gt; definable because of all the interrelationships it has.\n\nIndeed. So you tend to keep the representation of the resource (the\ninformation that can be transferred using GET and PUT) relatively small,\nand manage its relationship with other resources using means external to\nthe resource (e.g. RDF).\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
