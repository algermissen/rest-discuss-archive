REST is an architecture. It is not limited \n&gt; to HTTP, though I&#39;ve personally never found a need to use any other \n&gt; protocol for a REST system.\n\nBefore I had heard of REST I had written RESTfull-like systems with\nSQL stored procs.\n\nAll data access is wrapped through get procs which either return\nsingle values or structured &quot;row&quot; types (all predefined, a bit like\nXML schema types).\n\nNew data is created (just like POST) and data to be change is edited\nwith update procs that look a lot like PUT handlers.\n\nSometimes the procs (get, create or update) take meta data in the proc\ncall as well as the data itself.\n\n\nOne of the things that has been in the back of my mind since I came\nacross REST is that some sort of mapping between SQL stored procs and\nHTTP REST does not seem like it would be difficult. Furthermore, it\nmight be as natural and easy to use as WSDL/SOAP is for OO programming\n(not that I am saying WSDL/SOAP is any good - but it is a good *fit*).\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
