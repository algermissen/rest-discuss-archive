Do people even agree that this is \n&gt; actually needed?\n\n\n\nPerhaps an HTML form comprises such a convention, not for the discovery \nof the service itself, but for the discovery of the parameters:\n\n* You discover the URL of a service by some means.\n\n* You GET that URL, which returns an HTML form.\n\n* The HTML form describes where to POST to invoke that service, and what \nparameters can be passed in that POST.  In some cases, it will use \n&lt;selects&gt;s to describe what options are valid for a parameter.\n\n* In most cases, the form will be interspersed with human readable text, \nto explain the meaning of the parameters (a machine-understandable way \nto explain parameter meaning, sounds like an AI problem...)\n\n* You (the user of a web browser, or a piece of software \nprogrammatically using the server) populate the parameters and POST them \nto the URL you discovered via the form.\n\n* You get back a response, which might be an error message about a \nparameter problem, or might be a respresentation of the &quot;answer&quot;.\n\n\nKyle Cordes\nwww.kylecordes.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
