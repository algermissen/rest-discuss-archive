(my hunch) that a URI may identify a resource which references\n: &gt;: &gt;    other resources by embedding their URI in its represnetations,\n: &gt;: &gt;    to arbitrarily many recurses of this indirection, or\n: &gt;\n: If I understand you correctly --\n: Directly identified resource: http://example.com/story\n: Indirectly identified resource:  http://example.com/pictures/picture1\n: where the directly identified resource has a representation that is an\n: HTML document and that HTML document includes the tag &lt;img\n: src=&quot;http://example.com/pictures/picture1&quot;&gt;\n\nYes, that is what I meant.\n\n:\n:\n: &gt;: &gt;\n: &gt;: &gt;b. (probably Jan&#39;s assumption) that a URI may &#39;identify&#39; a resource\n: &gt;: &gt;    by inference, more like connotation that identification, which I\n: &gt;: &gt;    believe is a trap I stepped into yesterday in trying to navigate\n: &gt;: &gt;    this territory.\n: &gt;: &gt;\n: &gt;: &gt;\n: &gt;: c.  a URI may identify a resource which makes use of other resources to\n: &gt;: produce its representation.\n: &gt;:\n: &gt;\n:\n: Directly identified resource: http://example.com/story\n: Indirectly identified resource: file://docroot/story/story.html\n: where a representation of the indirectly identified resource is used to\n: produce a representation of the directly identified resource.  This is\n: the case for what is commonly referred to as &#39;static content&#39;.\n\nHold it.  You&#39;re calling an URI a resource above.  That&#39;s going to\ncause confusion.  Are you saying that the first URI identifies two\nresources, namely the one that it identifies directly, and also the one\nthat can be identified directly by the second URI?  First let me get\nthat part straight.\n\nIf that&#39;s your claim, then I&#39;ll now need to know more about what\nthe phrase &quot;used to produce a representation of&quot; really means.  Do\nyou  mean they share a representation?  Do you mean something\nwhich occurs in the server implementation that cannot be observed\non the network?  Are you sure this is any form of identification at\nall, let alone &quot;indirect identification&quot;?  I have no idea, as the phrase\n&quot;indirect identification&quot; is new to me.\n:\n: Or\n: Directly identified resource:  http://example.com/pictures/picture1\n: Indirectly identified resources: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.jpg,\n:   file://docroot/story/images/picture1.png,\n: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.gif\n: where content negotation on the directly identified resource results in\n: the use of the representation of one of the indirectly identified\n: resources as the representation of the directly identified resource.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t really seem any different, except that you&#39;ve introduced\ncontent negotiation.  Are you implying that all content negotiation\nscenarios involve the &quot;indirect identification&quot; phenomenon?\n\n\nI&#39;m concerned  about the quality of the terminology, especially the\nterm &quot;indirect&quot;.  To me, it doesn&#39;t mean indeterminate; it just means\nthat the identification is multi-stage.  In\nthis setting, that implies identifier that points to identifier that\npoints...\nuntil something other than a pointer results.\n\nIf the phenomenon is something other than that, I&#39;ll bet a better\nterminology can be found.  Like &quot;selection via association&quot; maybe.\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n"}}
