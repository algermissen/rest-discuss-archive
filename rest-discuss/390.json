In order\nto illustrate this, we have to ask:  what is a notification?\n\nLucas assumes that a notification is a delayed, asynchronous\nresponse to a particular HTTP request.  Hence, a sink must expose\nonly as much state to the source as a client would ordinarily\nexpose to a server.  That&#39;s fine, *iff* you accept that\nnotifications are the continuation of the original request.  When\nwe consider notifications this way, what we&#39;re doing is\nfundamentally introducing asynchrony *into* the HTTP\nrequest-response cycle.  This certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be very\nRESTful, IMHO.  (Neither does introducing asymmetric protocols\nfor generating a request and receiving a later response.)\n\nThat&#39;s not the only way to think about asynchrony, though.  A\nmore HTTP-friendly way to think about asynchrony is to consider\nthe initial subscription request / response cycle to be related\nto the establishment of a subscription.  That is, it is a request\nin itself, an entirely valid one which talks about the\nsubscription being established.  The response is related to the\nsubscription abstraction as well.  Later notifications ---\nrequests to the sink --- are not conceptually the continuation of\nthe original request, but rather subsequent data-providing\nrequests.  They are related to but semantically (mostly)\nindependent of the request-response cycle that established the\nsubscription.  They do pose a greater security risk than a\nsingle, simple client-server request-response cycle.  But that&#39;s\na necessary risk that we have to accept and manage if we are to\nallow edge machines to publish resources.  Any solution,\nincluding an asymmetric response protocol, introduces new risks\nthat must be managed.\n\nIMO, the latter is the appropriate approach --- asynchrony and\nthe notification abstraction live at the level of abstraction of\nresources;  it&#39;s about resources communicating with each other.\nResources can communicate asynchronously, without changing the\nsynchronous semantics of HTTP.  We can leave that alone, and\nstill build asynchronous communication patterns between resources\non top of it.\n\nJust a bit more musing on the topic, ciao...\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
