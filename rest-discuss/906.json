(Remember, we&#39;ve already decided\nthat each possible permutation in fact identifies a different resource, so the idea that\nspecific values for parameters identify different resources shouldn&#39;t trouble you too much.)\n\nI&#39;m really kicking the dog, here, but here you go proving to me again that URI aren&#39;t\nactually opaque *even now.*  If you truly believed that URI were opaque --- or that the path\nparts were opaque --- then why would you assume that my URI suggests hierarchy?  If URI were\nactually opaque, I would entirely be free to interpret any syntactically well-formed URI in\nwhichever way I like.  Perhaps &#39;/&#39; means set intersection in my ontology, &#39;..&#39; is\nmeaningless, and order of parts is irrelevant.\n\nURI aren&#39;t opaque, they have specific syntax and associated semantics *even today.*  One way\nto look at what I&#39;m proposing is this:  find ways to free the semantics of URI from the\nimplied semantics of RFC2396 and make them explicit and usable by humans and software.\n\njb\n\nPS - Getting the semantics of .. right is troublesome in any context.
