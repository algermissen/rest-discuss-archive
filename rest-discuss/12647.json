In\n&gt;&gt; other words, clients never =\r\never send state back, only commands.\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize CQS is a big thing right=\r\n now particularly in the DDD/messaging\n&gt; sense, but I&#39;m wondering why your =\r\nchoosing to combine CQS and REST?\n&gt;\n&gt; Plus the style of CQS that Udi/Greg o=\r\nthers are talking about (which I\nthink\n&gt; is influencing this) is a strict s=\r\neperation, maybe you could do the same\nbut\n&gt; use REST just for the Q?\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\nlternatively if it&#39;s just CQS in general that you need then can you not\ngo\n=\r\n&gt; for this by just carefully using the HTTP verbs (GET/OPTIONS vs\n&gt; PUT/POS=\r\nT/DELETE)?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is a domain model on the server which interprets an=\r\nd executes this\n&gt;&gt; and all the domain logic around it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Isn&#39;t one approa=\r\nch just to use ROA but when its a PUT you take the\nincoming\n&gt; representatio=\r\nn, work out what commands to apply based on it, and then\napply\n&gt; those to t=\r\nhe domain model?\n&gt;\n&gt; You might also be interested in this thread of posts, =\r\nI think some of them\n&gt; cover messaging over REST type designs:\n&gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://d=\r\nuncan-cragg.org/blog/post/distributed-observer-pattern-rest-dialogue\ns/\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a t=\r\nhought\nwithout accepting it.\n\n\n"}}
