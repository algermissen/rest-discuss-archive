I=\r\nn other words, OPTIONS seems to be for obtaining more communications-centri=\r\nc metadata, while HEAD seems to be for obtaining more content-centric metad=\r\nata.\n\n// see: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.4\n=\r\n\nHow about evaluating these approaches against a specific, theoretical scen=\r\nario?  Suppose we have a service that supplies weather reports given a spec=\r\nific location.  Clients can currently specify the location by zip code or c=\r\nity+state, although it will soon support latitude+longitude too.  The servi=\r\nce can provide the response weather report as either text/html, application=\r\n/xhtml+xml, text/vnd.wap.wml, text/xml, and even image/gif...the client nee=\r\nd only specify which it wants via ACCEPT.  The service has a name, descript=\r\nion, version, author, and links to reviews.  The reviews are in fact other =\r\nservices provided by Amazon, epinions, etc. that can be accessed both progr=\r\nammatically and interactively.  The service currently supports the USA and =\r\nCanada, but will soon support much of Western Europe too.\n\nNow I, a user, w=\r\nant to find out about this service.  How do I do it, given only a URL a fri=\r\nend sent me of http://host.domain.tld/services/free/?svc=3Dweather&zip=3D98=\r\n005\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jeffrey Winter [mailto:JeffreyWinter=\r\n@...] \nSent: Friday, February 14, 2003 1:32 PM\nTo: Zylstra, Jay\nCc: res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Re: REST Resource Dis=\r\ncovery\n\n\n&gt; There must be a way to get to a service&#39;s metadata given \n&gt; only=\r\n the service&#39;s URI. \n\nYou could just call HEAD and no entity would be retur=\r\nned.\n\nStill, this is part of the reason why I&#39;ve suggested\nthat the OPTIONS=\r\n method could be used for this \npurpose.  There wouldn&#39;t have to be the &quot;ex=\r\npense&quot; of\nan extra header with each GET, but there are trade\noffs with usin=\r\ng this approach (like firewall restrictions\netc., and the adoption of a sta=\r\nndard but obscure method)\n\n[This paraphrases a message I posted to distribu=\r\nted-registry]\n\nWhile the Allow: header could be returned in any\nresponse, i=\r\nt is normally only returned in response\nto an OPTIONS method.  From one per=\r\nspective this\ndescribes a refinement of a resources interface:\n\n\tAllow: GET=\r\n,PUT,POST,DELETE  being analogous to:\n\n\tinterface resource {\n\t\tdelete();\n\t\t=\r\nrepresentation get();\n\t\tput(representation r);\n\t\tpost(representation r);\n\t}=\r\n\n\n\t\tvs. \n\n\tAllow: GET,POST  being analogous to:\n\n\tinterface resource {\n\t\tre=\r\npresentation get();\n\t\tpost(representation r);\n\t}\n\nFrom this perspective, th=\r\ne OPTIONS method is already supplying\na form of metadata; using it to give =\r\nthe Meta-Location: header\nwould seem to be a natural extension to this &quot;fun=\r\nctionality.&quot;\n\n"}}
