There is\n&gt;&gt;just nothing to be described pre-runtime.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There does seem to be a requirement for a description as both\n&gt;documentation and tooling-input (to create client-side access stubs) for\n&gt;the software-accessing-an-API case.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, I know what you mean (and I have worked on this myself), \nbut....would it be RESTful to\nimplement client behaviour based on knowledge beyond the semantics of a \nMIME type dfinition?\n\nE.g. would it be RESTful to code a client app to GET \nhttp://www.google.de/search?q=foo\nand *after* that expect to receive a list of hits; that is to hard-wire \nthe expectation that the\nserver will offer such a list of possible subsequent state changes? What \nif the state machine\n(that is the web app) changes?\n\nOTH, could the behaviour be part of the semantics of a MIME type?\n\n------\n\nBTW, I would like to see such a description language to generate \n*server-side* stubs to\nease the process of bringing legacy apps into REST space....\n\n-------\n\nAnd....it is an interesting issue (damn, someone give me more time in a \nday :-( ) how the\nstate machine of a web app relates to process/workflow management \n(essentially the web apps\nstate machine controls the possible actions of the client[1]) and to \npi-calculus on the theoretical\nlevel....\n\n[1] ..and can even differentiate between actor roles given the user \ninformation of the HTTP request.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;It&#39;s useful to describe an application state-space apart from its\n&gt;execution, especially as client software without a human operator can&#39;t\n&gt;respond well to (semantic) changes, and must be (well, it&#39;s easiest to\n&gt;be) built with a hard expectation of the server.\n&gt;\n&gt;...jsled\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                          http://www.jalgermissen.com\nConsultant & Programmer                  http://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n"}}
