This link=\r\n points to the list of additional\n&gt; properties for that resource (at the UR=\r\nL &quot;{additional-properties}&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The URL &quot;{additional-properties}&quot; ret=\r\nurns a list of key/value\n&gt; properties for reading.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) For each key/val=\r\nue in the list there will be links for a) editing\n&gt; the value of the key, a=\r\nnd 2) deleting the key.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3a) Editing is as simple as PUTing a new value=\r\n to the URL.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3b) Deleting a key is as simple as a HTTP DELETE of the U=\r\nRL.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The list also contains a link for adding new properties.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhat would be a suitable (simple) media-type for this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am considering=\r\n ATOM (which is nice for lists), but that seems like\n&gt; quite a bit of overk=\r\nill. HTML might also be useful (but does not\n&gt; support PUT, but POST would =\r\nbe okay too). A home-grown\n&gt; application/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility.=\r\n\n\nAtom is for feeds, and HTML is for layout markup. You need something\ndesi=\r\ngned for transactional entities. Shoji [1] is a JSON-based protocol\nand med=\r\nia type designed for that, and it includes entity collections\n(&quot;catalogs&quot;) =\r\nas a bonus. Every Shoji Entity automatically includes the\nconcept of using =\r\nPUT to edit each attribute at its own URL (the server\nis free to return 405=\r\n for attributes where that method is not allowed).\nDELETE is specified for =\r\nEntities, not Values as you describe above, but\nthere&#39;s nothing stopping yo=\r\nu from using DELETE that way.\n\nShoji even covers the concept of &quot;additional=\r\n properties&quot; for you;\nthey&#39;re called &quot;fragments&quot; in Shoji.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\n=\r\nfumanchu@...\n\n[1] http://www.aminus.org/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-02.tx=\r\nt\n\n\n"}}
