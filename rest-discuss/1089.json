In my mind the primary weakness with WRDL is that it isn&#39;t\n&gt;integrated into any kind of data binding framework. To clarify: WSDL\n&gt;more or less depends upon XML Schema. That means that if you figure out\n&gt;a way to map XML Schema into your language (as many languages have done\n&gt;-- at least for simple stuff) then you can generate wrapper classes that\n&gt;know how to serialize and deserialize themselves &quot;for free&quot;.\n\nDoes this matter for a dynamic language, though?  You could just\nreturn XML-marshalled objects of whatever type, agreeing on the DTD\nbeforehand, and let the chips fall at runtime.\n\n--amk                                                             (www.amk.ca)\n  &quot;Yes, but who do you work for?&quot;\n  &quot;Work for?
