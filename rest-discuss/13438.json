Did you get a chance to watch the video?  What I wanted\nto draw attention to was there are some scenarios where media-type\nversioning does seem to be the most appropriate choice.  Kirk does a\nway better job of explaining why than I ever could so I&#39;ll leave that\nto him.\n\nThe fact that this video is about a real implementation that actually\nworked is the significant thing in this case.  I&#39;m not trying to say\nthere is only one way of doing versioning and we should always use\nthat way, I&#39;m just saying let&#39;s not throw out conneg and media-type\nversioning as a viable solution.\n\nThe excuse that RESTful systems can&#39;t use media-type versioning\nbecause some web browsers don&#39;t deliver the right accept header is\nbogus because if we are going to dictate restful architectures based\non existing client behaviour then we had better toss out PUT and\nDELETE too.  Sure there will be some systems where this is a deal\nbreaker, but that needs to be decided on a case by case basis.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you have pointers to the scenarios where URI\nbased versioning has worked well.  I would be interested to compare\nthe contexts.\n\nDarrel\n\n"}}
