As much as people like to talk about the 4 Holy Operations, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pretty clear that only 2 are in practical use, and I don&#39;t think that is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because HTML Forms don&#39;t allow for PUT and DELETE.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; +1.

Let&#39;s even\nassume that developers used the methods properly (i.e. no idempotent\nupdates via POST).\n\nI bet it would be well under 10%.  Why?  Because I suspect that there\nare a lot more non-idempotent things one might want to do, than\nidempotent things.\n\nAnd if you assume *realistic* developer use, I think we&#39;re almost back\nto where we are today.\n\nThat&#39;s not to suggest I don&#39;t think the GET/POST restriction should be\nlifted (thanks WHAT WG), but my argument in favour of doing so is\nbecause restricting extensibility unnecessarily is daft, and can come\nback to bite you in the ass.  I just don&#39;t think it has (that much) in\nthis case.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
