For the fun of it, what\n&gt; &gt; about the following architecture:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Premise: I want to access my banking information.  I also want to\n&gt; share bits\n&gt; &gt; of it with my accountant.  The URL for the bank is http://my.bank.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) I GET http://my.bank/access.  The server returns an HTTP\n&gt; Authentication\n&gt; &gt; challenge\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that doing GET to an &quot;anonymous&quot; uri and obtain an invisible\n&gt; context after authentication is not restful. Why not doing a GET to:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://my.bank/private/sj\n&gt;\n&gt; which asks for credentials (here, sj credentials)?\n\n*sigh* sorry.  This is a mistake.  Originally, Steps 1 returned a web form\nand Step 2 was a POST that created the URI.  I changed it to HTTP Auth to\navoid limiting the scope of the example to HTML.  I failed to re-read what I\nchanged it to, and therefore didn&#39;t catch that I was returning a 201 in\nresponse to a GET.  So... let&#39;s go back and change that somewhat:\n\n1) I POST my credentials to http://my.bank/access, be this from a web form,\nsome proprietary xml, etc.  The server authenticates me and returns a 201\nwith a Location of http://my.bank/access/12345.  (note: the html form could\nbe retrieved with a GET to http://my.bank/access.)\n\n&gt; &gt; 7) Also on the screen is an option that says &quot;send this page to:&quot; and an\n&gt; &gt; input box.  I fill in my accountant&#39;s e-mail address, and press\n&gt; submit.\n&gt;\n&gt; What could be done here is first to POST to the URI:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://my.bank/accountant/sj\n&gt;\n&gt; an xml document containing the uri :\n&gt;\n&gt; http://my.bank/private/sj/accounts/checking/456\n&gt;\n&gt; This POST has for effect to make the corresponding resource available\n&gt; as :\n&gt;\n&gt; http://my.bank/accountant/sj/accounts/checking/456\n&gt;\n&gt; I could then mail this uri to my accountant.\n&gt;\n&gt; If an authenticated user try to GET this, it has to be authenticated,\n&gt; and if not the user sj himself, has to own the role &quot;accountant&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, the role &quot;private&quot; does not give any right... .\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand what you are saying here.  I get the bit about\ncreating the URI, but not the rest.\n\n&gt; &gt; The e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit such as 30 minutes,\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; which, the link will only return a 404 response or some such.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In my mind, this create a state inside the server (a timer). This is\n&gt; bad isn&#39;t it ?\n\nThe timer is not part of the client state.  It&#39;s part of the resource state.\nIt&#39;s the client state that the server is not suppose to be maintaining.\n\nBy the way, the reason I created the URI instead of using HTTP Auth (or a\ncookie or whatever) at all times was partly due to Tyler and his crazy\ncapabilities-based security model.  :)  I am not sure if I am doing it\nright, but the basic idea here was that the bank issued a URI\n(http://my.bank/access/12345) with a defined set of capabilities (the\n&quot;contract&quot;).  I could do anything that&#39;s defined, nothing more.  On top of\nthat, when I want to share part of my access, I ask the bank for another\ncapability URI (http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789) for that particular bit.\nLike the first URI, use is limited to what is defined.  This also means that\nI do not have to get my accountant set up with a separate password, flip a\npotentially large set of switches to set the security context, etc. just to\ngive access.  Of course, this is a somewhat weak example, since most people\nwould likely just copy-n-paste the screen and e-mail it instead of go\nthrough all of this effort.  But in a more complex situation, I see how this\napproach could work well (I think).\n\nSeairth\n\n\n\n"}}
