That&#39;s the short\n&gt; answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; The longer answer is that you don&#39;t need one, nor want one. If your\n&gt; framework cannot tell you the HTTP method, doesn&#39;t allow (or makes it\n&gt; heard) you to query or specify headers, it&#39;s probably not useful for\n&gt; REST either.\n\nOh, I pretty much disagree with this.\n\nThe modern &quot;REST&quot; frameworks make working with HTTP and non-HTML\nworkloads easier.\n\nAfter writing several of even the most simple services, you quickly\ndiscover lots of redundant code that readily can, and has been,\ncaptured well by the modern frameworks.\n\nThat said, I have not used any of them, as my efforts have been simple\nenough that the value they bring don&#39;t outweigh the &quot;weight&quot; of\nlearning and leveraging them. But my services have been really, really\nsimple, so I just used raw Java Servlets for my work.\n\nWhat I have learned, tho, that, at least on the client side, the\nimplementation of a REST system is not necessarily the difficult part\n(thus the attraction). In fact, I&#39;d argue that writing a solid REST\nCLIENT is more difficult than a REST server, as much of the heavy\nlifting of the protocol is, in fact, in the client.\n\nOf course, the real &quot;hard part&quot; is the payload and endpoints\nthemselves. Since, that&#39;s where the &quot;REST&quot;-ness of it all really lies,\nand the part most folks get wrong.\n\nA framework isn&#39;t necessary, anyone reasonable will likely factor out\nthe bits they need if they just start writing implementations\nnaturally. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the frameworks are useless.\n\nAll that said, I can&#39;t comment on any of the specific frameworks.\nServlets work up to a point, and have suited me so far, but are\ninadequate in the overall big picture (can&#39;t handle 100-Continue very\nwell at all, for example).\n\nAny reasonable, modern layer above raw CGI will be a win though.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
