You can expose resources\nbefore they exist - like &quot;tommorow&#39;s lottery numbers&quot; - but don&#39;t worry\nabout generating the representation on the fly, that&#39;s not really &#39;creating\na resource&#39;.\n \n(my opinion only, of course)\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of pkeane_littlehat\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 26, 2007 9:17 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] advice sought re GET vs POST for \n&gt; RESTful search\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve hit a conundrum and would like to solicit advice:\n&gt; \n&gt; I am retooling the search functionality of a digital library \n&gt; application and have defined a search URL template (a la CQL or\n&gt; OpenSearch) that allows a human or machine user to express a \n&gt; complex search with a properly formatted URL string.  E.g.,:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://example.com/search?query=atom+or+rss+syndication&type=a\n&gt; rticle &#92; \n&gt; &collection=my_collection&collection=your_collection&start=10&max=40\n&gt; \n&gt; I take that url string and &quot;normalize&quot; it (lower-case all \n&gt; query terms, alphabetize multiple params, etc) into a data \n&gt; structure such that all equivalent searches will result in \n&gt; the exact same data structure (NOTE that &#39;start&#39; and &#39;max&#39; \n&gt; are NOT included in the data structure).  I then get the md5 \n&gt; hash of the string representation of that data structure -- \n&gt; this will serve as a key to a cache of searches.  I then \n&gt; derive an sql statement from the data structure and perform \n&gt; the search.  The result of the search is simply a set of \n&gt; ordered ID numbers for all of the items that match the \n&gt; search.  I take that entire id number string and cache it, \n&gt; with the search md5 hash as the key.  Next, I apply the \n&gt; &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; parameters to this string, resulting in my \n&gt; viewable set of items,. which I load up (i.e., grab all of \n&gt; the data for these items) and send back in the response.  \n&gt; Note that the original search query is &quot;bookmark-able&quot; and \n&gt; will always return the same response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Embedded in the response are links to the &quot;previous&quot; and \n&gt; &quot;next&quot; set of items (computed based on the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; \n&gt; params of the original request).  BUT, instead of embedding \n&gt; that entire query string, I can simply embed a URL like:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://example.com/search_hash/56YYYufgsfggfccFF098?start=50&max=40\n&gt; \n&gt; for the &quot;next&quot; link.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I appear to have used a GET request to create a new \n&gt; resource in the search_hash resource &#39;collection&#39;, which I \n&gt; now refer to in the resulting hypertext of that new search.  \n&gt; Should the original query have used POST instead of GET?  \n&gt; (That seems wrong somehow, and in the case of repeat searches \n&gt; it WON&#39;T create a new resource, but using GET is CLEARLY \n&gt; resulting in a &#39;side effect&#39;, which in not allowed).\n&gt; \n&gt; any advice/observations on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; many thanks-\n&gt; Peter Keane\n&gt; daseproject.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
