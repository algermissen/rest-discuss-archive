The reason I&#39;m curious is because t=\r\nhere are a lot of frameworks like Rails which claim &quot;RESTfulness&quot; but seem =\r\nto just deliver REST - HATEOAS (well at least on the &quot;machine to machine&quot; A=\r\nctiveResource side of things when I last looked at it). Lots of folks seem =\r\nto think this is really great and is light years better than RPC but I don&#39;=\r\nt really understand why. \n\nAlso, things like the idempotency of PUT and DEL=\r\nETE have never yielded any practical benefits to me (though I get how they =\r\ncan in _theory_) so I&#39;m also really curious to know how people are making p=\r\nractical use of them in the systems they are building.\n\nI have personally s=\r\neen huge gains with &quot;full&quot; REST in systems I&#39;ve built -- chiefly in decoupl=\r\ning clients and servers (a lot of the stuff Craig McClanahan brings up in t=\r\nhis thread) -- and so I really &quot;get&quot; that. REST - HATEOAS -- not so much.\n\n=\r\nOn another note: I think HATEOAS is much more than &quot;links in content&quot; unles=\r\ns your client is something like a spider. What&#39;s your take on the discussio=\r\nn here: \nhttp://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2008/03/23/Connecting \n\nAndrew Wa=\r\nhbe\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; wahbedahbe wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually, I&#39;d like to turn this question around.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always been confused by what folks who design systems that c=\r\nomply \n&gt; &gt; with all of REST except HATEOAS think they are getting out of it=\r\n. It \n&gt; &gt; makes no sense to me. The only benefit I can think of is that \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; intermediaries have some insight into what is going on. From a practical =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; perspective this means you get caching (yes, theoretically it can be \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; more than caching but most systems stop there). Is that it?\n&gt; \n&gt; To tur=\r\nn this round again - I would not agree that all REST benefits are \n&gt; derive=\r\nd from links in content.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do folks think? What are the benefi=\r\nts of a REST - HATEOAS based \n&gt; &gt; architecture?\n&gt; \n&gt; Each principle and con=\r\nstraint adopted gets you some benefit, and those \n&gt; are well documented. So=\r\n the answer seems to the benefits except those \n&gt; derived from links in con=\r\ntent.\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
