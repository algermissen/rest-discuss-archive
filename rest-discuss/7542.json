A client\nsets or gets the state of a resource, then takes action based on the\nresponses to setting or getting the data.\n\nPerhaps rather than invoking a &quot;person[27].eat()&quot; method, you could add to\nthe &quot;person[27].goals&quot; a value of &quot;eat&quot;.\n\nPOST /people/ittay/goals HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.dror.com\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n&lt;goals&gt;\n &lt;goal priority=&quot;high&quot;&gt;eat&lt;/goal&gt;\n&lt;/goals&gt;\n\nThe server may decide that the request to eat is inappropriate, or the\nserver may schedule the activity for later, or it may immediately take\naction - these could be indicated in a response that points to the current\nactivities:\n\n201 Created\nLocation: /people/ittay/activities\n\n&lt;activities&gt;\n &lt;activity&gt;watch television&lt;/activity&gt;\n &lt;activity&gt;eat&lt;/activity&gt;\n&lt;/activities&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
