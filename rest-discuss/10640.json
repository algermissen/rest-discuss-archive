As I understand\n&gt;&gt; the comments, the problem is not the use of PUT to make a copy per se,\n&gt;&gt; merely the use of an HTTP header to provide the URL for source of the copy\n&gt;&gt; instead of using an &quot;enclosed entity&quot; (as RFC 2616 calls it) containing the\n&gt;&gt; URL for the source of the copy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, an entity includes its entity headers too, including any special\n&gt; headers AWS invents.\n&gt; \n&gt; AWS has invented a hypertext message with all the link information in\n&gt; its extension headers.\n&gt; \n&gt; They don&#39;t seem to have invented a special Content-type for it, but I\n&gt; haven&#39;t read their whole spec. If they would invent a Content-type,\n&gt; then a server receiving that PUT message would know how to process\n&gt; these (bodyless) documents properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems ok to me.\n&gt; ...\n\nNope.\n\nEven if they did have a content type for it, that would still not change \nthe defined semantics of PUT.\n\nPlease don&#39;t abuse PUT for RPC (and instructing a server to copy \nsomething from A to B is something like a RPC). If there&#39;s nothing more \nspecific, use POST. In this case, there already is a method that does \nhave the desired semantics, and that is POST.\n\n&gt; The questionable part might overloading PUT to mean COPY, but if you\n&gt; believe PUT has the flexibility to interpret the entity and do\n&gt; something creative that ends up with a resource being available at\n&gt; that URI, then no problem. This is like the PATCH discussion. I think\n&gt; most people thought it was wrong to PUT a special differences document\n&gt; -- but I was unconvinced.\n\nI see. And disagree with you :-).\n\n&gt; It&#39;s wrong to suppose that any agent is going to PUT these documents\n&gt; to some unsuspecting server and something bad will happen. I&#39;m not\n&gt; going to let my agent PUT these anywhere I haven&#39;t been instructed to\n&gt; by some hypertext I received earlier, or by reading the documentation.\n\nWell, maybe not you.\n\nIf a server, for instance through OPTIONS, claims to support PUT, *my* \nclients will use PUT and will assume it does what RFC2616 says.\n\n&gt; If I do PUT it to some random server, I can&#39;t say what exactly what\n&gt; will happen, but whatever it is, it will be what I deserve.\n\nNope.\n\nIf the server doesn&#39;t do what the spec says (&quot;store the entity&quot;), then \nyou can blame the server.\n\nThat&#39;s the whole point of having specifying semantics.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
