So hello everyone! I designed a\nset of REST services back in 2002 and did a couple\npapers based on the experience at XML 2002. Then the\nproject got cancelled...

Revisiting my design; it *is* idempotent; i.e.\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t add a new item\n&gt; to the cart with multiple GETS as I incorporated\n&gt; logic to ensure it only\n&gt; added one. It was also &quot;safe&quot; in a manner of\n&gt; speaking; adding to the cart\n&gt; did not obligate a person to buy but it did leave an\n&gt; item in the shopping\n&gt; cart (making it impossible for us to truly\n&gt; understand abandon rates; can you\n&gt; tell we didn&#39;t pay attention to that metric?)\n&gt;  \n\nI think maybe there is more to &quot;safe&quot; than not\nobligating the user. From RFC 2616 (HTTP), Section\n9.1.1\n\n&quot;  In particular, the convention has been established\nthat the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the\nsignificance of taking an action other than retrieval.\nThese methods ought to be considered &quot;safe&quot;. &quot;\n\nBasically a GET should do nothing but retrieve.\n\n&gt; 2.) What if there was a url I could have emailed to\n&gt; customers that instead\n&gt; took them to a screen that asked them to click a\n&gt; button on a form that used\n&gt; POST to add the identified item into the shopping\n&gt; cart?  That would be more\n&gt; RESTful then?\n&gt;  \n\nYes indeed it would be RESTful (actually I think it is\nmore about complying with HTTP in this case), assuming\nthe &quot;add to the shopping cart&quot; part was RESTful as\nwell. Something like the form directing the POST at a\nresource for the user&#39;s carts or the set of all carts,\nor whatever, as long as you have distinct resources\nwith distinct URI for distinct things. E.g. there\nshould be a resource for the cart, with its own URI,\nand likely a GET on that URI would show you the\ncontents of the cart presuming you have the authority\nto see it. Also have a distinct resource for the item.\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nSponsored Link\n\nRates near historic lows - \n$200,000 mortgage for $660/ month - \nhttp://yahoo.ratemarketplace.com\n\n"}}
