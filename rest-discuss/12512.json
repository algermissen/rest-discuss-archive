I have a launching customer \n&gt; testing the API from their perspective. Just now a developer of theirs \n&gt; ran into my office. He wanted to catch (4xx and 5xx) errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my application can return a 403 response code for several reasons. \n&gt; In the body of the response I have a human readable error message \n&gt; explaining why things went awry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem, he wants to act different on different types of 403 \n&gt; response codes. If only to notify the user in different ways. My error \n&gt; message can not (always) be copied 1-to-1 to their frontend.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is he to do? Match on the possible changing human readable error \n&gt; message? Obviously this is very brittle.\n&gt; Pass my error message to their frontend? More often than not this is not \n&gt; desirable.\n&gt; Or should I include an error identifier in the response body? So that he \n&gt; may match on that. This introduces a fair bit of coupling which I don&#39;t \n&gt; like at all and feels very unRESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only semi-helpful post I found was this one: \n&gt; http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/4009 &lt;http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/4009&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I would very much appreciate your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; With kind regards,\n&gt; Harm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
