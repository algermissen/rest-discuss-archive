I have XML-RPC, JSON and SOAP experience but want to give REST\n&gt; a=\r\n shot...\n&gt;\n&gt; I have 2 burning questions....\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Is it considered bad tas=\r\nte to use parameters (i.e. ?id=3D1) within the\n&gt; URL? From what I have read=\r\n it is but everyone seems to be doing it.\n\nIt&#39;s probably best practice if e=\r\nverything before the &#39;?&#39; identifies a\nservice and the query string after th=\r\ne &#39;?&#39; really is simply parameters\nto that service. If the parameters really=\r\n define a hierarchy you might\nconsider making them part of the service URI =\r\ne.g.\n/folders?name=3Dpictures might be /folders/pictures. There&#39;s some\nadva=\r\nntage in that  to whatever extent you can make your namespace\nhierarchical,=\r\n you can use relative URIs. Also there used to be some\ncaches that didn&#39;t h=\r\nandle query strings properly, and I don&#39;t know if\nthat behavior has improve=\r\nd over the last couple years.\n\n&gt; 2. What is considered the standard practic=\r\ne for user authentication? As\n&gt; I understand it Sessions are supposed to be=\r\n a thing of the past, but how\n&gt; would I work around that? Standard HTTP aut=\r\nhentication?\n&gt;\n\nRight: sessions are bad. Use HTTP Basic authentication:\nhtt=\r\np://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt\n\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; Christian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nHu=\r\ngh\n\n"}}
