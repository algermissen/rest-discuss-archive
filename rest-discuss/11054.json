I also do some caching in my business/dao layers.\n&gt;\n&gt; How would the &quot;REST cache&quot; be any different? I&#39;m imagining a &quot;service\n&gt; layer caching&quot; here, sort of like: (I use tomcat/java/jersey btw)\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Client requests resource &quot;/users&quot;\n&gt; 2) The service layer will be intercepted (AOP, or a filter) perhaps by\n&gt; my caching service and check the last-modified date for the &quot;/users&quot;\n&gt; resource. So I would have an entry in a hashtable like {&quot;/users&quot;,\n&gt; 10/23/08 14:25, [john, mary, bob]}\n&gt; 3) I compare the dates and either return [john, mary, bob] or a\n&gt; ResponseObject with the not-modified header.\n\nThen, what does the client do?\n\nIf you&#39;re sending back not-modified (which is a status code, not a\nheader, btw), the client doesn&#39;t have to do much: there&#39;s no response\nto process.\n\nSo now the client has less workload.  And maybe the client&#39;s client\n(if the client is another service, and itself returns not modified).\nThat works end-to-end.\n\nIf you&#39;re just caching the database then you can save a hit on the\ndatabase, but you still have to generate and send back a response,\nclient has to wait for it and then process the response, which may\nhave no new information.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The only difference here from a tradicional (ehcache, oscache) cache\n&gt; is the date based caching. Something like this? What other\n&gt; alternatives are there?\n&gt;\n&gt; I know something about Etags, expiration header and other specifics of\n&gt; the HTTP protocol. I&#39;m talking about the caching &quot;framework&quot; really.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
