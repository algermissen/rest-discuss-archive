This can easily be converted to XML using standard tools:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;case xmlns=&quot;http://my-casefile-namespace&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;My title&lt;/title&gt; \n&gt; &lt;/case&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But how would the machine readable HTML look like? Maybe:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;div property=&quot;case&quot;&gt; &lt;div property=&quot;title&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\nHopefully, something that makes better use of HTML semantics like:\n\n&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1 property=&quot;case:title&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/h1&gt; ...  &lt;/article&gt;\n\n&gt; So I feel trapped somewhere between these two formats and I guess that is \n&gt; why\n&gt; people turn to their own media-types. Now they get easy tooling and \n&gt; embedded\n&gt; hypermedia controls in XML (which they must invent themselves).\n\nThis sounds like more work for both producers and consumers than just\nserializing to an HTML form.\n\nThose insistent on rolling out domain-specific XML elements, rather than \nusing\nRDFa/microdata/classes to embed the same vocabulary into an HTML user\ninterface, could at least mix in XHTML, XForms, XLink, and WAI-ARIA with\ntheir domain-specific vocabulary rather than reinvent the wheel.\n\n&gt; Can&#39;t we combine and get the best of both worlds?\n&gt;\n&gt; What is needed is something that:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Makes it easy to serialize/deserialize any data (m2m scenario).  - Is\n&gt; browsable with a normal browser (h2m scenario).  - Has hyper media \n&gt; controls.\n&gt; - Can update data through hyper media controls.\n\nIf by &quot;easy&quot; you mean as easy as serializing name-value pairs into an XML\nelement tree, then these goals are in conflict, because magically building a\ngood user interface for h2m is hard to script - indeed such interfaces are \nan\narea of outright competition rather than just standardization! Consequently,\ndevelopers tend to want to customize cookie-cutter user interfaces, \nreplacing\nthe scaffolding erected by web frameworks.\n\n&gt; The HTML form could have RDFa added to it to lessen the coupling between \n&gt; the\n&gt; server and the client, like Eric suggested. Something like:\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;case_title&quot; name=&quot;Case.Title&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;/&gt;\n\nNote this does not work since RDFa takes the content of the RDFa &quot;content&quot;\nattribute or, failing that, the concatenated text nodes of the element as \nthe\nvalue, *not* the &quot;value&quot; property of the &quot;input&quot;, as the value of \n&quot;dc:title&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#sequence\n\nWhat you want to say is that the .value property may or should be a \n&quot;dc:title&quot;,\nbut HTML5 and friends do not currently offer a way to express that.\n\nAdding a way to do this is not easy since &quot;value&quot; might or might not be a\nprovided or valid value.\n\n--\nBenjamin Hawkes-Lewis \n\n\n"}}
