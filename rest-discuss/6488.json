For example, we can post a DeleteOperationRequest \nresource:\n\n   POST: http//example.com/deleteOperationRequest\n\npassing the URI of the resource to be deleted.\n\nThis returns the URI of the new deleteOperationRequest resource.\n\nGETting this resource will provide information on the operation: done, \nfailed, cancelled, running (with % done), invoked by, started at, and so \non...\n\nPUT can be used to issue a cancellation.\n\nDELETE deletes it (deletes the DeleteOperationRequest resource).\n\nWe keep this resource around for a long time, using it as an operation log.\n\nI understand that this is not what you want to do: you want to POST a \nnew resource, and later on, PUT or DELETE that same resource. This can \nstill be offered in parallel. But In situations where monitoring is \nneeded, we use the above approach.\n\nIt is a little RPCish to use a &quot;DeleteOperation&quot;, but the fact that this \nis an actual resource (&quot;DeleteOperationRequest&quot;), this seems RESTful \nenough to me. I&#39;d like to hear cleaner solutions or comments on this \napproach though.\n\n--\nClaude\n\nPhilip Ruelle a ï¿½crit :\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Looking through the archives of this group there have been numerous \n&gt; mentions of status monitor resources and several of those talk about \n&gt; status monitors only existing for the duration of a request. Whilst \n&gt; keeping hold of status monitor resources for eternity isn&#39;t a \n&gt; showstopper (they will just be a row in a DB) it is far from ideal \n&gt; requiring the server to store potentially huge numbers of monitor \n&gt; &#39;records&#39;*.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Has anyone implemented status monitors with a limited lifecycle and if so:\n&gt; 1) how have you defined that lifecycle \n&gt; 2) what is the client-server interaction across and beyond the lifecycle \n&gt; of a monitor. In other words what would be returned (HTTP Status) as the \n&gt; client invokes a GET as the monitor moves through different states and \n&gt; is ultimately deleted?\n&gt;  \n&gt; POST is a straightforward example and I am specifically thinking of an \n&gt; asynchronous DELETE request where the client needs to know if its \n&gt; request has failed or not. Polling the original resource and expecting a \n&gt; 404 is obviously insufficient in the case that the DELETE has been \n&gt; attempted and failed as the client will poll indefintely.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; Phil\n&gt;  \n&gt; * Even if there is only one monitor per resource it will still be \n&gt; necessary to store per-request details so the storage requirements are \n&gt; effectively the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; _www.mourant.com &lt;http://www.mourant.com/&gt;_\n&gt; \n&gt; The information in this email (and any attachments) may contain \n&gt; privileged and confidential information and is intended solely for the \n&gt; use of the individual or organisation to whom it is addressed.
