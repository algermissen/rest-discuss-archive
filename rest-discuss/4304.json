This is\nactually a browser bug, however with no active development from microsoft on\nInternet Explorer, you can&#39;t really count on browsers very much. &quot;\nIs this only a bug with IE? Do other browsers support easily logging out? If\nthis is a browser bug, what part of the protocol is the browser not\nsupporting correctly?\n\nWhy is it that HTTP doesn&#39;t define request or response headers that allow\napplication authors to control things that they obviously want to control?\nLike setting and clearing auth headers in order to avoid modifying URIs. I\nimagine a &#39;set auth header&#39; response would do the trick - a login.html page\nwould let a user enter username/password in a pretty page, then the request\nhandler would check the validity and respond with a server-generated token\nfor further auth. Maybe a new auth-type of &#39;server&#39; in addition to &#39;basic&#39;\nor something.\n\nShould we spin something up? Maybe take a crack at implementing it in\nMozilla?\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Chris Croome&quot; &lt;chris@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 31, 2004 3:02 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Hacking HTTP Authentication with mod_perl\n\n\n&gt; Hi\n&gt;\n&gt; There is an interesting document here:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hacking HTTP Authentication with mod_perl\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://wiki.slugbug.org.uk/HTTP_Authentication\n&gt;\n&gt; Which basically explain how to set up logging in and out using HTTP\n&gt; Authentication.\n&gt;\n&gt; The inability to log out and in again is often cited as the reason\n&gt; for using cookie and form of authentication.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris Croome                               &lt;chris@...&gt;\n&gt; web design                             http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/\n&gt; web content management                               http://mkdoc.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
