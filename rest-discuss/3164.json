There may be a large\nnumber of messages and, ideally, I only want the\nclient to retrieve new messages.\n\nAgain, my initial instinct here was that I could\nuse range-headers (because the mailbox only\ngrows), but, even if I just return metadata, I\nwant to give the server the option of moving the\nactual messages to different URLs.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no guarantee that the new\nURL will have the same length as the old.  So\nchanging all the URLs in the folder could\nradically change its length, thereby precluding\nuse of range headers to get new messages.\n\nDoes this make sense now?\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS I really want the server to be able to choose\non a per-message basis whether to return the\nwhole message or simply a URL but URL changes\nillustrate my pount sufficiently well.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
