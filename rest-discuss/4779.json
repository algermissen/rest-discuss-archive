The resource identifier consists of all the data \nin the URI,\n&gt; including the query terms.\n\nSounds like I need to read up on URIs a little more, would RFC 2396, \nUniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, be a good place \nto begin?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Tracking who is sending requests to the server about resources \nmight be\n&gt; better done via authorization headers in HTTP. Separating the \nresource from\n&gt; the authorization is a good approach in general and applies here \nas well.\n\nYes, that sounds like a good idea, I&#39;ll look into HTTP authorization \nheaders.\n\n&gt; If this is truly for billing, then you probably could justify \nrequiring a\n&gt; login. \n\nAs this is a web service interface and the requestor is likely to be \nanother application, not a browser, the header-based authorization \nmight still be the best option.\n\nThanks very much for your help :)\n\nCheers\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
