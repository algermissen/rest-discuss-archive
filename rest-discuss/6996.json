This would be cool:\n&gt;\n&gt; (5) GET /employees/{key}\n&gt;\n&gt; Fwiw, I don&#39;t like the way rails exposes pks in URLs, so {key} above\n&gt; would be any identifier that can survives a db wreck. If you don&#39;t use\n&gt; the db pk generator, it means you don&#39;t need to create an employee\n&gt; object speculatively while providing a unique URL - for example,\n&gt; premature object creation is a problem with Plone&#39;s portal_factory  \n&gt; that\n&gt; means you can&#39;t sanely use GET to serve the creation form.
