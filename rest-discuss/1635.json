How could it then be wrong to have something like\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.math2.com/power?x=5&y=http://www.math.com/sum?x=2+y=7\n\nNothing wrong with that at all, as long as (a) math2 explicitly tells the\nclient how to construct that URI, and (b) the client assumes nothing more\nabout URI construction than what math2 tells it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as you open the door to &quot;generative&quot; URIs (which we agree is\n&gt; necessary sometimes),\n\nWow, that&#39;s new --- I thought we disagreed about that. :-)\n\n&gt; it becomes clear that a reference to another\n&gt; resource is a valid input to the first resource. If I express this in\n&gt; XPipe or something, I have a declarative form the result but I don&#39;t\n&gt; have a *globally accessible URI* for the result unless I can write the\n&gt; XPipe to some file somewhere.\n&gt; \n\nWe&#39;re *almost* in agreement.  The subtle but important point that I&#39;d like\nto call attention to is the fact that\n\nhttp://www.math2.com/power?x=5&y=http://www.math.com/sum?x=2+y=7\n\n...means whatever www.math2.com states / wants it to mean, whereas the\n&quot;dangerous&quot; proposal is to assume that it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; to do:\n\nhttp://www.math2.com/power?x=5&y=GET&GET=http://www.math.com/sum?x=2+y=7\n\n...(or invent your own syntax) and have the client assuming that math2 is\ngoing to do the right thing.  I.e., you really don&#39;t want to open the door\nto embedding arbitrary URIs in the query strings of other URIs and assume\nthat the receipient is going to do the right thing.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; No extra complexity. It follows as naturally as:\n&gt; \n&gt; a * b\n&gt; \n&gt; a * (b + c)\n&gt;\n\nWell, there&#39;s your problem...  (* a b), (* a (+ b c))\n\n;-)\n\nJb\n\n\n\n"}}
