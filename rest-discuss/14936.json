My bad.\n\nSo summing up what you said, you did clear up the media type use. For a resource /orders, I would have one media type, say, application/vnd.com.mypackage.orders+xml (perhaps two, with a +json on the end). That would work for ALL resource calls, be it to create, get, put a single item or a list of them. The same one XSD segment would work in all cases. I see that now. Thank you.\n\nI was confused I think partly because of Jan&#39;s and some other responses on the Jersey forum regarding using media types for everything. I suppose I thought with how Jersey handles methods for specific media types (even tho you can use the same custom one on multiple methods), I thought perhaps what was meant was to use specific media types for each method (post/put/get/delete) so that you did NOT need to specify in a response link the method to use.\n\nAs for the right method to use... you&#39;re saying that just like a web page, if I were to copy a link off of a web site, and try to PUT that link to the server, I&#39;d probably get a 405 method not allowed or some error response back. So basically, a list of links that come back to the client in response to a a resource request would simply be a bunch of URIs, that is it. No media type specification, not methods allowed to be called on it. The client consumer simply has to trial and error to the server... if a client calls GET on /orders, and the authentication for the user making that request deems the user can NOT delete/update individual orders, the client UI still shows DELETE/UPDATE links. When the user, whose not allowed to delete/update, clicks one of those links, basically the server responds saying you&#39;re not allowed to do this. Is that what I am understanding you to say?\n\nIf so, I don&#39;t agree with that because I want to build a dynamic UI (if I am a consumer of this API) that gives &quot;hints&quot; so to speak on what a user can do at a given point. I expect my reply to give me the bare minimum essential information so I can represent the users next set of actions correctly. I surely wouldn&#39;t want to provide links to delete/update if the user can&#39;t do this. There has to be some correct/common/agreed upon/best practices manner in which REST developers are returning these URIs with enough information to allow a client consumer to render a UI that allows its users to make choices it&#39;s allowed to make, and not present every possibility. \n\nSo, would you give me an example of how you might do something like this? Show me two xml snippets.. using the same resource (lets use /orders or /cart your choice), one user is only allowed to GET resource items, the other can do the full gamut.. update/delete/get. Show me how you would respond in both scenarios so that I can see how the response URIs are formatted to allow the client consumer to know what can be done and present it as such in a UI to end users.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1095814979-1267294994=:14322\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Markus,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gave you a bad example, yes, create is a command and not a resource.
