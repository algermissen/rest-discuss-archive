That said, I totally agr=\r\nee with what you say, taken for granted the WSDL is an IDL used as an out-o=\r\nf-band definition of flow for REST. \n\nAs Mike pointed out, removing REST fr=\r\nom the picture, and trying to make WSDL a dynamically consumable, lean docu=\r\nment, not oriented to hypertext driven APIs but to messaging ones, not nece=\r\nssarily over HTTP: is still WSDL as bad? Maybe it is good for something, in=\r\n other context.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I guess no, it makes no sense=\r\n to use a IDL to represent REST Hypertext states transitions or flows. I ca=\r\nn almost call it an oxymoron. I hate RPC for services implementation, still=\r\n RPC may be good in some other situations. Just not for REST anyway.\n\nCheer=\r\ns!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares. \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Eric =\r\nJ.

With ID=\r\nLs, the\n&gt; categories allowed in the PATCH would be listed in a schema, and =\r\nthat\n&gt; schema would need to be updated when the list of categories changes.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not just give the current list in-band as part of a hypertext\n&gt; c=\r\nontrol?  IDLs add whole layers of indirection which simply aren&#39;t\n&gt; needed =\r\nwhen hypertext controls are used instead.  REST is about\n&gt; declaring to gen=\r\neric user-agents what state transitions are possible,\n&gt; not what applicatio=\r\nn-specific user-agents may infer from out-of-band\n&gt; understanding of the ap=\r\nplication flow.\n&gt; \n&gt; IOW, I&#39;m turning your question back on you -- I&#39;ve nev=\r\ner seen an IDL\n&gt; that can describe the hypertext-driven APIs I write.  That=\r\n&#39;s my\n&gt; context, but I try to keep an open mind, so all anyone has to do to=\r\n\n&gt; convince me that I&#39;m being nonsensical or dogmatic in my opposition to\n&gt;=\r\n IDLs is show me what I&#39;m missing by giving a counter-example of what an\n&gt; =\r\nAPI would look like which allows an Atom Entry to be PUT-edited or\n&gt; PATCH-=\r\ntagged without relying on out-of-band inferences (i.e. rel=3D&#39;edit&#39;\n&gt; means=\r\n PUT, and rel=3D&#39;some URI&#39; means PATCH) specific to the application\n&gt; or th=\r\ne domain (as opposed to generic).\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
