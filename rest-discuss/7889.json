The API defines what you can do with it. \nThe different ends of the connection want to do different things with \nthe medium of transfer and consequently view it in different ways.\n\nThis is hardly unique to HTTP or software by the way. For instance, \nMcDonald&#39;s sees a hamburger very differently than I as a customer do. \nFor them it is an inventory item. For me it is lunch. Their operations \non the hamburger include reordering and cooking. Mine include eating.\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
