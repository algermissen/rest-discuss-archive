I also want the option of using the same front end to\n&gt;  talk to =\r\nclassic HTTP(S)  accessible systems.\n\nFirstly, did you look at http://code.=\r\ngoogle.com/p/xeerkat/  ? (I don&#39;t\nknow the project, but it&#39;s the second goo=\r\ngle hit for p2p rest)\n\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking about a similar setup for my (st=\r\nill quite\ntheoretical) distributed file system. However, I wouldn&#39;t want to=\r\n use\nXMPP as it still requires a server setup, and would like to use a true=\r\n\np2p system such as JXTA or something simpled built on distributed hash\ntab=\r\nles.\n\nI agree that having a jabber account per resource would be very moder=\r\nn\nand decoupled and all that. (or at least unique &quot;to&quot; addresses - maybe\nth=\r\nere is a way to hack multiple addresses from a single account in\nJabber wit=\r\nh some prefix or postfix? Something similar to how qmail can\nbe configured =\r\nto receive emails to\nyouraccount-whateveryouwant@...)\n\nIf you use p2=\r\np groups you can just use some UUID (or even a virtual\nHTTP URI) as the res=\r\nource identifiers and submit it to the p2p message\ngroup in a HTTP-like mes=\r\nsage:\n\n  PUT http://myapp.com/p2p/nodes/a87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1ccdea8=\r\n8/ip4\n  Content-Type: text/plain\n\n  156.282.22.14:2331\n\ncould for instance =\r\nbe a way a node registered itself.  (Coupled with\nsome appropriate signatur=\r\nes to prove that the PUT came from\na87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1ccdea88). N=\r\note that there wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily be anything on http://myapp.com/p2p/ - =\r\nthe URIs only serve\nas identificators within the application. Requests woul=\r\nd be sent out\non the p2p group similarly:\n\n  GET http://myapp.com/p2p/nodes=\r\n/a87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1ccdea88/last_seen\n\nThe nodes who according to=\r\n say the distributed hash table knows about\na87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1cc=\r\ndea88 would then reply with an\nappropriate representation of the resource, =\r\neven if the node\na87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1ccdea88 himself was now even =\r\noffline.\n\nOf course you could have resources that are living freely outside=\r\n &quot;nodes&quot;:\n\n  PUT http://myapp.com/p2p/notes/7f5fd142-af5f-4c2a-9395-7df4f51=\r\nfdc04\n  Content-Type: text/plain\n\n  This is a note.\n\n\nDepending on which p2=\r\np framework is used, it might or might not be\nnecessary to add some headers=\r\n to identify that particular GET and POST\nrequests, who&#39;s requesting, and w=\r\nho&#39;s replying. In addition you would\nhave issues with authority, for instan=\r\nce it could be difficult for\nanyone to say 404, because all except the resp=\r\nonsible nodes wouldn&#39;t\nknow about the resource, and so you can&#39;t know if it=\r\n&#39;s a real 404 or\njust connection timed out. (which doesn&#39;t have a HTTP stat=\r\nus code\nASFAK).\n\n\nI&#39;m not so sure how clever it is to use &quot;http://&quot; URIs in=\r\n such an\napplication, as it would not distinguish between real HTTP URLs an=\r\nd\np2p-based ones, so a different protocol name is probably preferable,\nfor =\r\ninstance urn:myapp.com:p2p/nodes/a87497f6-65b0-4c0d-a988-4f5f1ccdea88\n\n\n-- =\r\n\nStian S=F8iland               You stick to the floor not because gravity i=\r\ns\nManchester, UK              pulling you down, but because that is the sho=\r\nrtest\nhttp://soiland.no/          distance between today and tomorrow.
