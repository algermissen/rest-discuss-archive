There&#39;s an\n&gt; &gt; initial resource /foo on the server, and a fixed resource which the\n&gt; &gt; client PUTs. In that case, is,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   GET /foo\n&gt; &gt;   PUT /foo\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; an idempotent sequence or not?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, you can always construct a GET-followed-by-PUT (of the same\n&gt; URI) example that is idempotent, but that&#39;s not the point.\n\nSo that sequence is idempotent? Even tho&#39; the client-visible result will \ndiffer on a reexecution? OK, that&#39;s how I understand idempotent as it \napplies to individual methods. It&#39;s what I called the server-side- \nrelevant-only interpretation, and I think it&#39;s the only one which is \nconsistent with PUT and DELETE being idempotent.\n\n&gt; The point is, as 2616 says;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non-\n&gt; idempotent, even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are\n&gt; idempotent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And I showed an example where that was the case.  It is clearly *not*\n&gt; the case for all sequenced uses of GET and PUT on the same URI, but\n&gt; that&#39;s ok, it doesn&#39;t need to be to make that statement in 2616\n&gt; correct.\n\nNo, that wasn&#39;t an example. You allowed the PUT entity to change between \nexecutions of the sequence. That means that the PUT isn&#39;t being used in \nan idempotent way, so a fortiori the sequence isn&#39;t idempotent.\n\nFor the clauses about idempotent sequences to make any sense we&#39;d need \nan example of a non-idempotent sequence of idempotent requests where \nany PUT entities stay the same from execution to execution. Like I \nsaid, I haven&#39;t been able to think of a single example. Can anyone else \ncome up with one?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
