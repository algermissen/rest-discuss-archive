But=\r\n\n&gt; even then, you should say that &quot;my understanding of Roy&#39;s thesis is\n&gt; di=\r\nfferent from yours&quot; instead of &quot;you&#39;re misunderstanding Roy&#39;s\n&gt; thesis&quot;... =\r\nUnless you&#39;re Roy...\n&gt; \n\nSo REST dies with Roy, because it&#39;s utterly incomp=\r\nrehensible to anyone\nelse?  Please.\n\nThere are plenty of examples on this l=\r\nist of people who have taken the\ntime to struggle with this subject, and be=\r\nlieve it or not, learned what\nREST is.  Since we all use the same definitio=\r\nns of the same terms, we\ncan even have conversations about REST without res=\r\norting to &quot;agreeing\nto disagree&quot; because, believe it or not, there are righ=\r\nt and wrong\nanswers -- due to the clarity with which Roy&#39;s thesis describes=\r\n his\nsubject matter to *anyone* who makes the effort to understand the\nComp=\r\nuter Science basis of REST, even if that means reading one or more\nof the f=\r\nootnoted reference materials.\n\nThe only definition of REST is Roy&#39;s thesis,=\r\n and it is *not* open for\ninterpretation.  There&#39;s plenty of room to flesh =\r\nout the things that\naren&#39;t in the dissertation, but there is no room to re-=\r\ndefine REST to\nfit your own definition of whatever you want it to be -- RES=\r\nT is not so\nabstract a notion that anything goes.  If I&#39;m wrong about somet=\r\nhing, I&#39;m\nquite certain Roy will correct me if nobody else here (who knows =\r\nwhat\nthey&#39;re talking about) does first.  REST isn&#39;t so theoretical that the=\r\n\nonly person capable of giving an answer here is Roy himself -- if that\nwer=\r\ne the case, I seriously doubt anyone else would be much interested\nin REST.=\r\n\n\nYou, however, have not studied your ass off for years learning this\nmater=\r\nial -- so stop reducing everything to a semantic debate.  You have\nlots mor=\r\ne listening and reading to do, before you&#39;re in a position to\ncorrect or ev=\r\nen criticize the posts of others.  You&#39;d be a lot farther\nalong with REST i=\r\nf you spent half as much time studying REST as you do\ncriticizing and argui=\r\nng with people on rest-discuss.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Neverthless, my interpretation actual=\r\nly is similar to the bigger part\n&gt; of what you said, but what you&#39;re descri=\r\nbing at the end of your post\n&gt; is what is referred as &quot;tunnelling&quot; and that=\r\n&#39;s not we&#39;re doing. We\n&gt; are not tunnelling HTTP over other protocols or ot=\r\nher proctocols over\n&gt; HTTP. We could have done that, it had been more easy =\r\nfor us, since\n&gt; we&#39;re partially based on Jersey and Jersey kinda support th=\r\nat.\n&gt; Instead, I&#39;v rewrited significant parts of what Jersey does with HTTP=\r\n\n&gt; in order to decouple the HTTP part from the REST part, in order to\n&gt; use=\r\n the later with other connectors that work over other protocols.\n&gt; Basicall=\r\ny, we&#39;re applying the same RESTfull constraints that are\n&gt; &quot;natural&quot; in HTT=\r\nP to other protocols. Of course that in order to do\n&gt; so we loose something=\r\n, but that&#39;s not the point.\n&gt; \n\nWhat I described has nothing to do with tun=\r\nneling.  Modeling a system\non the Uniform Interface means that you&#39;re using=\r\n methods which are as\nwell defined as methods come.  If you have some other=\r\n method you need,\nthen you redevelop your system to make it work with the U=\r\nniform\nInterface instead -- what you *don&#39;t* do is resort to tunneling cust=\r\nom\nmethods over POST.\n\nHow on Earth can you read what I read, and conclude =\r\nthat I&#39;m talking\nabout tunneling?  Oh yeah, you spend more time rebutting w=\r\nhat others\nsay than you do actually reading what they&#39;ve written, let alone=\r\n\ntrying to understand it.  As a result, you simply don&#39;t make any sense\nwhe=\r\nn you talk about applying the constraints of REST to a protocol like\nJMS --=\r\n a result of failing to take the time to learn what REST&#39;s\nconstraints actu=\r\nally are.  That or you&#39;re a troll -- I don&#39;t know quite\nknow what else to m=\r\nake of someone who has spent exponentially more time\narguing about REST tha=\r\nn they have spent trying to learn it.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But then again, in my understan=\r\nding of Roy&#39;s thesis, the constraints\n&gt; are to be applied to the architectu=\r\nre, not to the communication or\n&gt; the protocol. That the communication and =\r\nthus the protocol is part of\n&gt; that architecture, that is true. That some p=\r\nrotocols are are more\n&gt; &quot;natural&quot; fits for those constraints, that is also =\r\ntrue. But people\n&gt; here focus too much in &quot;protocol&quot; and less in &quot;user-agen=\r\nts&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;connectors&quot;, that also are part of the architecture.\n&gt; \n\nREST is=\r\n defined as a set of constraints -- you don&#39;t apply constraints\nto an archi=\r\ntecture, an architecture is defined by the constraints it\nimposes on a syst=\r\nem.  You apply REST&#39;s constraints to the communication\nbetween network conn=\r\nectors, independent of protocol.  The hypertext\nconstraint is applied to th=\r\ne message entity, and this has absolutely\nnothing to do with what network p=\r\nrotocol is involved. Again, if you\nwant to make every thread a discussion o=\r\nf the collective shortcomings\nof this group as a whole, please start rest-d=\r\niscuss-discuss.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that there are some superiors minds in t=\r\nhis list that \n&gt; aren&#39;t interested in these minor questions and doubts, but=\r\n then again \n&gt; this is rest-discuss, not rest-philosophical-discuss...\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nEnough already with all the boring ad-hominem *whining* in your posts.\nPlea=\r\nse. REST is an architectural style, so of *course* discussions here\nare goi=\r\nng to be philosophical in nature.  Again, plenty of people on\nthis list hav=\r\ne managed to get REST sorted out over the years, with less\nhelp than is ava=\r\nilable to those just getting started now.  But you seem\nto have a chip on y=\r\nour shoulder against anyone who *has* learned, and\nyou seem like a troll fo=\r\nr constantly demanding special treatment that\nnone of the rest of us needed=\r\n.\n\nThe rest of us had to learn the hard way, find the REST wiki by reading\n=\r\nthe archive of this list or simply lurking here for awhile (instead of\nbein=\r\ng told of it, but only *after* griping that no such thing existed,\netc.)...=\r\n what makes you so special?  REST is hard, there are no\nshortcuts, you simp=\r\nly need to invest the time (most often measured in\nyears) that it takes to =\r\nlearn any complex subject matter.\n\nIf I want to learn the Theory of Relativ=\r\nity, and actually use it in\nprofessional life, then there&#39;s no way around r=\r\neading Einstein&#39;s work,\nand no way around reading and studying Physics befo=\r\nre even getting to\nthat point.  It doesn&#39;t take an Einstein to grasp relati=\r\nvity theory (to\ncome up with it in the first place, sure), nor is Einstein =\r\nthe only\nperson capable of answering questions about it.  Stephen Hawking c=\r\nan\nexplain it to you, but only after you&#39;ve taken the effort to learn\nPhysi=\r\ncs.\n\nYet somehow, it&#39;s a failure of the REST community for not providing\nau=\r\nthoritative &quot;Cliff&#39;s Notes&quot; which offer some easier alternative than\nreadin=\r\ng Roy&#39;s thesis, for people who haven&#39;t studied software\narchitecture.  Your=\r\n trouble learning REST is nobody&#39;s problem but your\nown, so stop trying to =\r\nassign blame to others, or demanding that others\naccept &quot;your interpretatio=\r\nn&quot; of terms as valid before trying to answer\nyour questions, etc.\n\nLearn th=\r\ne terminology, and REST won&#39;t seem nearly so ambiguous as it\nmust seem, in =\r\norder for you to think that it&#39;s somehow open for\ninterpretation.  It isn&#39;t=\r\n, but you can only know that *after* studying\nyour ass off.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
