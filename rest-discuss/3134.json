I&#39;ll try\n&gt; to restate it here as I understand it:\n&gt;\n&gt; A GET operation that immediately follows a PUT operation must return\n&gt; exactly the representation presented by the PUT,\n\nIs some kind of equivalence implied?  If so, what is its specification?\nThere\nare folks hotly debating, as we speak, how to do equiavalence on URI\nstrings.\n\n&gt; _provided that the\n&gt; resource&#39;s state does not change between those two operations_.  Note\n&gt; that this statement is about the behavior of the server; it is not about\n&gt; behavior that an arbitraty client might be able to observe.\n\nAre you talking about nontransparent cache effects here?  If not, then\nI don&#39;t understand why you say that GET&#39;s behavior is not observable\nby clients.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If I remember correctly, this whole thing is not really about what you\n&gt; GET after a PUT.  It is more about whether or not you can do content\n&gt; negotiation/have variants on a PUT.  As I understand it, Fielding says\n&gt; you can&#39;t because there&#39;s no mechanism (in HTTP) to indicate whether the\n&gt; contents of the PUT is a variant of the current representation or a\n&gt; replacement for the current representation.  I seem to remember that the\n&gt; conversation wrapped up with an understanding that, in general,\n&gt; resources that support PUT cannot support content negotiation.\n\nLet&#39;s look at a SQL analogy in which UPDATE is in the same role as\nHTTP PUT.\n\n&gt;    UPDATE ORDER SET ORDER_DATE = &#39;1/12/2003 09:00:00&#39; where KEY=&#39;1&#39;\n\n1 row(s) updated\n\nHere I&#39;ve supplied a string representation of a date field, whose internal\nstorage for whatever SQL engine I&#39;m using is irrelevant.  Now I&#39;ll retrieve\nthe same info:\n\n&gt;    SELECT ORDER_DATE from ORDER where KEY=&#39;1&#39;\n\nJan 12, 2003 9:00 AM\n\n1 row(s)\n\nSemantically equivalent, but the format&#39;s been changed.  Happens all\nthe time.  The UPDATE didn&#39;t store yet another variant, nor did it take\nmy string and try to treat its bits as a long integer or something else.\n\n/walden\n\n\n"}}
