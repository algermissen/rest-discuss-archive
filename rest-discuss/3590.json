That doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of doing\n&gt; &gt; &quot;sessions&quot; statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; That concept tends to be a little confusing, partly because HTTP,\n&gt; like many network protocols, has a notion of stateless interactions\n&gt; that only refers to having all of the information needed to\n&gt; understand each request inside the request or defined by universal\n&gt; standard.  REST goes further and constrains application state\n&gt; (not resource state) to be held on the client.\n\nRight.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;ve always assumed that this\nadditional constraint is a constraint on application semantics.  That\nis, that a RESTful application semantic may not punt application\nstate.  So &quot;LOGIN&quot; wouldn&#39;t be a permitted semantic, because even though\na LOGIN message may be semantically self-contained (and uniform even),\nit defers the maintenance of some application state (whether you&#39;re\nauthorized or not) to the server.\n\nIs that right?  Does this additional constraint impact anything else?\n\n&gt; The purpose of statelessness is to prevent partial failures and\n&gt; allow for substrate independence (e.g., load-balanced gateways\n&gt; managing the traffic for many servers).  Cookies don&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily break that because they are inside the request,\n&gt; unless developers make the mistake of defining the cookie such\n&gt; that it varies by gateway.\n\nVery good point.\n\nBut there&#39;s also a problem if the cookie is defined such that the\nreferenced state varies with time, which I would expect is much more\ncommon than varying by gateway.  A message that references some other\nstate may be processed at a time when that state is different than it\nwas when the message was constructed.\n\nI understand that this isn&#39;t as relevant to the simple browser/server\ninteractions of today, but architecturally speaking it seems quite\nimportant, especially as we move towards disconnected and queued\ninteractions.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
