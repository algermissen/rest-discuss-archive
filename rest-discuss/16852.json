When this is the case (and I grant, \nit isn&#39;t always), PUTting to the URI of that resource neatly solves the \npartial PUT issue.\n\nAgain, it isn&#39;t always applicable, and it isn&#39;t always convenient when \nit is applicable, but it is another approach that can be used sometimes.\n\n\n"}}
