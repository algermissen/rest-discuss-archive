At some point I can publish them to make them public.\n&gt;  &gt;  And at any time I can toggle between draft or published mode.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  My object model is very simple - articles have a method for each of\n&gt;  &gt;  these actions.  article.publish and article.make_draft.  I don&#39;t know\n&gt;  &gt;  how I can easily map those to resources.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  The ways I&#39;ve thought of are\n&gt;  &gt;   - expose the state, so that clients would do something like PUT\n&gt;  &gt;  /articles/1 with published=true or published=false\n&gt;  &gt;   - create a new intermediate resource like versions\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  I don&#39;t like either of those choices.  For the first one, my\n&gt;  &gt;  controller code would have to look at the incoming params, then see if\n&gt;  &gt;  published=true, and if so call the publish method on the article.  The\n&gt;  &gt;  second choice has me creating resources where I don&#39;t really want any.\n&gt;  &gt;   All I want to do is map a HTTP request to an operation on my object\n&gt;  &gt;  model.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Pat\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Yahoo!
