We&#39;d need to use a separate media type\n&gt; for each &#39;sub-resource&#39;.\n&gt; And what if we want to update two sub-resources at the same time (e.g.\n&gt; address and salary)? we&#39;d need a uri like\n&gt; /user/123/?part=address;salary. Does it make sense? We&#39;d need another\n&gt; media-type too. Actually we&#39;d need a media type for any combination of\n&gt; subresources (assuming we&#39;re not using application+xml).\n&gt;\n&gt; I personally sometimes use PUT for partial updates because I don&#39;t\n&gt; have good answers to these questions (I too agree with Bill&#39;s comment\n&gt; on over-engineering).
