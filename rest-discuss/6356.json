How do you\n&gt; normally do actions like searching?\n\nMy own preference would be to use /cars/ for the collection and\n/cars/123 for a particular car, enjoying the conceptual hierarchy.\nBut it&#39;s totally a personal style thing. I don&#39;t think REST itself\nsays anything about URL hierarchies, except to say that client\ncode should not depend on any particular structure, even if you do\ndefine one. It&#39;s just a matter of human understanding and\nconvenience.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n"}}
