If it means anything, it means &quot;client connector&quot;.  What\nI&#39;m suggesting is that people read the thesis and use the precise terms\nthat *are* defined, instead of making up our own terminology to discuss\nthat thesis.\n\nSuch a terminology becomes limited to this group, while only introducing\nmore confusion.  Remember when &quot;noun vs. verb&quot; came along?  Did that\nultimately help or hinder?  My opinion is that it hindered, and we\nshould remember that any time we consider defining new terminology that\nisn&#39;t covered in the thesis we&#39;re all trying to learn and explain.\n\n@Bob:  I disagree that I&#39;m being pedantic.  When discussing client-\nserver the meaning of client is clear; less so with REST where it could\nbe a component or a connector.  Lumping component and connector into\none is, to me, the primary issue hindering m2m discussion.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
