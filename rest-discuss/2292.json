Using that example, it\n&gt; would be a mistake to agree to a contract by reference, because the\n&gt; contract may change by the time the message is processed.\n\nI&#39;m not convinced that it is always practical to &quot;inline&quot; all relevant\nstate. But I&#39;ll let Bob &quot;I know contracts&quot; Haugen come up with a counter\nexample. Real-world contracts (and laws) do sometimes refer to each\nother and we handle that by keeping historical copies of them around.\n\n&gt; The rule is, if the meaning of the message depends upon the result of\n&gt; dereferencing a URI, then this is stateful and a bad thing.\n\nOkay, you have a stronger definition of stateful than I do. I agree that\nwhere your model is practical it is better because it is easier to log,\nmore visible for intermediaries etc. But it feels like there are cases\nwhere you would end up inlining a huge web of historical documents.\nNevertheless, your distinction of referencing identity versus\nreferencing state points out that EVERY link does not have to be\ninlined. I&#39;ll have to think about some examples more.\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
