May I summarize how it looks from\nhere:\n\nHTTP GET, PUT, DELETE, and even POST realize uniform semantics. POST\ndoesn&#39;t constrain the semantics very much, because the server can do a\nlot of things with the posted message. But ordinary HTTP clients don&#39;t\nassume anything more than that the result of the POST may be available\nin the returned entity or at the URI specified in the Location header.\n\nHTTP permits a certain class of client applications to operate against\narbitrary servers in exactly the same way. When those clients POST, they\nwould not presume that the server will return the Location of query\nresults. They might, however, retrieve the representation from the 201\ncreated Location, should the server return that, and render it for the\nuser. They could not process the response more intelligently than that.\n\nIf you write a client application that presumes the resource returned in\nthe Location header is a query result, and attempt to do further\nprocessing based on that presumption, your client will fail against\narbitrary resources. Or rather, the server may happily respond with 200\nor 201 but your client will have to further process the response to\ndetermine whether the invocation really succeeded, before processing it\nas a query result.\n\nMark suggests a new interface, adding the QUERY-WITH-POST method to the\nusual HTTP methods. If you want to write a client that can operate\nagainst arbitrary resources, and presume the response will be a query\nresult it can process, you would have to use that new method. If the\nserver responds 200 or 201 in that case, you can process the response as\na query. This interface exposes uniform semantics to all such clients.\nThis approach seems the most robust way for Bud (the original poster on\nthe thread) to implement his query.\n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
