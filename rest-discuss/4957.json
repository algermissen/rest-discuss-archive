However, I&#39;ve encountered a problem for which I haven&#39;t yet\nseen a tried and tested solution.\n\nThe distributed nature of web-based systems means that races may occur\nwhen clients update specific resources. Traditionally this problem is\nsolved by using transactions. Server state seems to be discouraged by\nthose who advocate REST (though Paul Prescod introduces server state\nin order to resolve the reliable POST problem:\nhttp://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html), so the solutions that I\nhave in mind (updating a mutex or a counter associated with a resource\nusing PUT) would attempt to incorporate this principle.\n\nSo, what techniques have already been shown to deal with client update\nrace problems?\n\nPaul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
