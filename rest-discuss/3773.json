I&#39;ve just joined a company=\r\n\nthat consciously applies REST to a back-end server interface, but the\nfron=\r\nt-end user interface is not very RESTy at all. I&#39;m struggling to\nimagine ho=\r\nw certain features of that user interface, in common with user\ninterfaces I=\r\n&#39;ve seen in several Web applications, could be redesigned\nconsistent with R=\r\nEST principles.\n\nThese are some of the features I&#39;m wondering about:\n\n1. Lo=\r\ngin Page\n\nThe support for HTTP Basic authentication in common Web browsers =\r\nis not\nparticularly user friendly. Therefore, Web applications that require=\r\n\nuser authentication universally present an HTML login page with a form\ntha=\r\nt, when submitted, results in a cookie being set in the browser. This\ncooki=\r\ne is often a session key, which is obviously not RESTful; on the\nother hand=\r\n, if the cookie were used purely as an authentication token\nnot requiring s=\r\nerver state, would such use be consistent with REST?\n\n2. Current User\n\nOnce=\r\n the user is logged in, it is common to have at the very least the\nuser&#39;s n=\r\name displayed in the corner of every page of the application. At\na further =\r\nextreme, any given page may be completely different per user,\nsuch as a use=\r\nr-customizable &quot;dashboard&quot;. As I understand REST, the\nrepresentation return=\r\ned from a GET should not depend on the\nauthorization state, but only on the=\r\n URI.\n\nWhat if instead of &lt;/dashboard&gt; the URI was &lt;/joe/dashboard&gt;? Any us=\r\ner\nother than joe who tried to GET that resource could simply be forbidden.=\r\n\nBut does that make sense for putting the user&#39;s name at the top of every\np=\r\nage of the application? Should every page view that a user can see be\nconsi=\r\ndered a resource specific to that user?\n\n3. Menus, Etc.\n\nI wrote some comme=\r\nnts and questions on this topic at the bottom of\n&lt;http://conveyor.com/RESTw=\r\niki/moin.cgi/HowWikiComparesToRest&gt;. In that\ndiscussion, it had been posite=\r\nd that a RESTful Wiki would use PUT for\nediting pages. However, every page =\r\nof a typical Wiki has a menu bar at\nthe top & other bits of information lik=\r\ne the last modified date at the\nbottom, none of which can be edited by user=\r\ns.\n\nMore generally, Web applications tend to have lots of menus on the top\n=\r\nand left of every page that aren&#39;t directly relevant to the content of\nthe =\r\npage, but are really window dressing for the entire site. How can\nall that =\r\nUI cruft be understood in a RESTful way?\n\nJustin Sampson\n\n\n"}}
