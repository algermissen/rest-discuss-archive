I&#39;m trying hard to imagine how you&#39;d make a &quot;functional&quot;\n&gt; web service without making it useless!\n\nThat&#39;s a failure of imagination. ;-)  Seriously, the parallels are quite\nsignificant.  In effect, URIs are generic functions that dispatch on\nmessage, parameter, conneg and other headers to a fixed set of\nfunctions, i.e. the supported HTTP method implementations.  The abstract\nresource itself can be regarded as a monad that encapsulates the\nside-effecting state changes on e.g. PUT and POST.  The various pieces\nof input (&quot;parameters&quot;, headers) define the domain of the specific\nfunction and the set of possible representations associated with that\nfunction is the codomain / range.\n\nThat may stretch the way you think of &quot;functional&quot;, but it works quite\nwell.  With a bit more formality and rigor in these definitions it\nbecomes possible to begin talking about Web interactions using a\ncompositional algebra, and you can reason about Web architecture using\nthe tools of category theory.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
