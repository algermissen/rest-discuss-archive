This is comparable to E2E principle\nof the Internet, which basically says decentralized value\ngeneration is established by direct connection between machines,\nrunning service that does not depend on feature-rich, &quot;fat&quot; network.\nIn REST, information is directly connected because there&#39;s no\n&quot;fat API&quot; or &quot;custom protocol method&quot;. Everything in between is\nso thin, it&#39;s almost invisible.\n\nNow, before praising REST, we need to clarify why E2E information\nmodel is preferable just like E2E connectivity on the Internet.\nFor this argument, I could think of following two features: closer\ncoupling and service discovery.\n\nWhen information model is E2E, amount of addressable piece of\ninformation increases. This means each address points to smaller,\nand more specific information.\n\nWhen deep linking is done under such environment, it allows two\nindependently created information to be closely coupled through\nloose hyperlinking. You have more control on defining information\nor relation between information by simply doing more detailed\nhyperlinking. This result to better access to and understanding\nof cluster of information. +1.\n\nNow, let&#39;s look at service discovery. For this argument, think\nof Amazon.com. When you access its website, do you look for &quot;e-commerce\nAPI that allow me to buy Christmas present&quot;? No? I thought so.\nYou look for an item you want, then look for &quot;purchasing API&quot; - in\nthis case, a web form. So service discovery is data-driven.\n\nWhen you hide data behind service, you loose this driving force.\nNo amount of service metadata can change this. Only exception\nto this is probably a &quot;search API&quot;. Except for discovery service\nitself, all else should be data-driven. Data should express\nitself and service it belongs to. You locate data, and\noperate through it (sounds like variant of OOP). Since information\nmust come before service, this is another +1 for E2E information model.\n\nSo, how does this slight shift of focus from REST to E2E make\na difference?\n\nFor example, if you focus on E2E principle, cookie is not\nanti-Web anymore. While cookie is unRESTful, it is not\nanti-E2E, because information is still directly connected.\nObviously, there&#39;re type of cookie that is both unRESTful\nand anti-E2E. That&#39;s a type of cookie that controls content\ninformation-wise. Such cookie belongs to URI.\n\nNow, which part of URI should such &quot;URI cookie&quot; information\nbelong? I still do not have clear saying on this part, but\nI suspect this &quot;URI cookie&quot; is what we call &quot;query string&quot;\ntoday. In another word, any query string is a cookie to\ncontrol representation of a service. From this standpoint,\nfollowing could be said:\n\n- Service is located by URI with or without query string.\n- Representation of service is located by URI with zero or\n  more number of additional query string.\n\nAnd after all these, I presume following could also be said:\n\n- Use cookie for identification (or use standard HTTP auth).\n- URI must be a projection of the representing content it exposes.\n  If representation changes information-wise, URI must change.\n- URI must always be sharable to ensure maximum reachability.\n- For creating sharable URI even when &quot;URI cookie&quot; is being used,\n  use two &quot;URI cookies&quot;. One for private personalization, and\n  the other to hold sharable modification. Former can be linked\n  with identity once identity is created.\n\nNow, I guess many of these are already known as web development\npractice, so this seems to be a yet another example of the owl of\nMinerva flying at dusk.\n\nMy final conclusion is while information-level E2E and REST\nboth results to almost same architecture, E2E is the principle\nthat defines the data model of the Web, and that data model\nprefers REST principle for maximum reachability of data.\n\nComments?\n\n-- \nTaisuke Yamada &lt;tyamadajp@...&gt;, http://rakugaki.org/\n2268 E9A2 D4F9 014E F11D  1DF7 DCA3 83BC 78E5 CD3A\n\nMessage to my public address may not be handled in a timely manner.\nFor a direct contact, please use my private address on my namecard.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
