Here&#39;s the idea that is\n&gt; currently brewing in my head:\n\nI don&#39;t think there is any consensus on a correct REST approach yet.\nSeveral people are exploring ideas.\nMaybe there will never be one single correct approach.\nIt will depend (as usual) on context and conditions.\nFor example:\n\n&gt; if I am the client and I am sitting at a browser I don&#39;t want\n&gt; to create a PO from scratch.  I want CompanyB to provide me \n&gt; a nice order form to fill out.\n\nBut if you are CompanyA&#39;s computer system and you and CompanyB have a \nregular business relationship, you already know the format to use and \nwhat to do with it.\nSo just shoot them a PO.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
