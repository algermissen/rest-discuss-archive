It is a big mistake to build new\nmassive frameworks on top of a massive framework if you don&#39;t need to.\n\nOf course, now the software industry will now get to compete with a\nmore clueful bunch of MS HTTP products, instead of the WS-Bogus\nnonsense you could immediately write off and never think about again.\nThe Astoria stuff may not be the prettiest, but it looks to me like it\nwill *actually work* without an army of consultants, which is a big\nchange.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
