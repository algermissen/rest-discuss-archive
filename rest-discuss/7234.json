Each URI/resource could also expose a \nchunk of related WADL metadata. This would work well with OPTIONS which \ncan specify an URI.\n\nOf course, this approach requires some support from the server/framework \nused in order to transparently expose these metadata, otherwise it can \nbecome quite cumbersome.\n\n&gt; See: http://www.xfront.com/dist-reg/distributed-registry.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.xfront.com/dist-reg/distributed-registry.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The header described there could be returned only on the OPTIONS\n&gt; method so that it doesn&#39;t need to be included with each response.\n\nInteresting, I will have a closer look at this previous effort. Thanks \nfor the pointer.\n\n-- \nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
