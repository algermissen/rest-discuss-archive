I\nunderstand\nsyntax error to be a condition that aborts meaningful processing, and this\nis application level protocol, so the status code should tell us about how\neffectively state was transferred, not how effectively bits were\ntransported.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why wouldn&#39;t 400 in this case be the ideal way to drive the\n&gt; &gt; application in asking for the data again after correcting syntax?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How does 400 prevent the application from making progress?\n&gt;\n&gt; Because it&#39;s an error.  An error response describes the specifics of the\n&gt; error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,\n&gt; except to do a logical &quot;Back&quot;; as far as the state of the application is\n&gt; concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.\n\n&quot;Back&quot; seems more like a browser idiom.  I would say that the absence\nof a 2xx is the absence of a forward transition, which leaves application\nstate\nright where it was.  In this case, the &quot;way to proceed&quot; is to correct syntax\nand try again.  What am I missing?\n\nAnother thought: the details of a malformed request and an aborted\nstate transition are analogous to (or perhaps just examples of)\nconversational state.  Not part of the &quot;application state&quot; model.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application\n&gt; &gt; unsure about specific status codes can/should punt and use the x00\n&gt; &gt; in the appropriate category?  Doesn&#39;t seem to say that in 2616 for\n&gt; &gt; the 400 family.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sec 6.1.1;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required\n&gt;  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\n&gt;  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n&gt;  understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n&gt;  digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n&gt;  x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an\n&gt;  unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.&quot;\n\nAh, thanks.  So it would seem the part of 2616 that says 400 is about\nsyntax error specifically kind of violates that class/subclass thing, since\nother 4xx responses are not about syntax.
