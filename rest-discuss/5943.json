This causes a POST.  The response to the POST includes \n&gt; information confirming the action.  Later, the user uses the Back \n&gt; button, and the browser says &quot;This information was generated in response \n&gt; to a POST.  Do you want to resubmit it?&quot;  Or worse, it just resubmits \n&gt; the request without asking.  This is going to be a problem with any \n&gt; non-idempotent request.  It is especially a problem on a public access \n&gt; station, when a new person walks up and can resubmit a request that \n&gt; someone else made, perhaps even altering it.\n\nWhat you are trying to do is make a form submission idempotent. Multiple\nidempotent form submissions don&#39;t matter, so don&#39;t have to be protected\nagainst. There are a few theoretical approaches this, mostly unsupported\nby existing software:\n\n1) Use an idempotent method:\nIf a user is updating their details, give the details a URI and send a\nPUT request of the new data to that URI\n&gt;&gt; PUT http://example.com/users/lyle HTTP/...\n&gt;&gt; (personal data)\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 200 OK\n\nrepeat that and there is no harm done:\n&gt;&gt; PUT http://example.com/users/lyle HTTP/...\n&gt;&gt; (personal data)\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 200 OK\n\n2) Use two requests:\nThe first request &quot;reserves&quot; or &quot;primes&quot; the submission. It creates a\nresource and returns it to the client. The client transfers the intended\nstate to that resource.\n&gt;&gt; POST http://example.com/webmail/new HTTP/...\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 201 Created\n&lt;&lt; Location: http://example.com/webmail/new/1234\n&gt;&gt; GET http://example.com/webmail/new/1234 HTTP/...\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 200 OK\n&lt;&lt; (empty email submission form)\n&gt;&gt; PUT http://example.com/webmail/new/1234 HTTP/...\n&gt;&gt; (completed email submission form)\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 200 OK\n\nRepeat either part and there is no harm done:\n&gt;&gt; POST http://example.com/webmail/new HTTP/...\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 201 Created\n&lt;&lt; Location: http://example.com/webmail/new/4321\n&gt;&gt; GET http://example.com/webmail/new/4321 HTTP/...\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 200 OK\n&lt;&lt; (empty email submission form)\n\nor\n&gt;&gt; PUT http://example.com/webmail/new/1234 HTTP/...\n&gt;&gt; (completed email submission form)\n&lt;&lt; HTTP/... 410 Gone (404, or 401, etc...)\n&lt;&lt; (explanatory text: this email has already been sent)\n\nRepeat both, and the client still sends two emails, but the user would\nhave to enter the email content twice to do so.\n\nAnother alternative would be to discard duplicate requests at the server\nside. This would be logically equivalent to the second option presented\nabove except that the client would normally provide the identifer\nalongside the request. Duplicates of the same identifier would cause\ntheir containing message to be dropped. \n\nThe two approaches are not supported by html forms[1], but look to be\nsupported by xforms[2].\n\nBenjamin\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.1\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice11.html#send-put\n\n\n"}}
