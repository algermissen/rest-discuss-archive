They did it by\nadding information inheritance. At first glance, it looks like Java\ninheritance, and the specification talks about &quot;extending an interface.&quot;\nLooking beneath the surface, however, it&#39;s really just &quot;extending the\nvtable,&quot; just like COM.\n\n--\n\nLooks like it&#39;s going to be a loooong time before there&#39;s such thing as\nSHARE Interface Description Language.\n\nAnd I can&#39;t believe this, how can WSDL designers not think about multiple\ninterfaces right from the start?!?! And adding hacks into WSDL 2.0 just to\nmake it &quot;support&quot; multiple interfaces?\n\nIf you look at WSDL tutorials... I think more than 90% does NOT say\nanything about interfaces, let alone multiple interfaces (for one\nservice). This is some big omittance, IMHO.\n\nMy proposal for RSDL (which is now unofficially renamed to SHARED)\ncontains only two basic elements: interfaces and operations. There are no\ntypes, since types are contained in interfaces, and more other things.\n\nAnd there&#39;s something about multiple inheritance of interfaces. In my RSDL\nproposal this is expected, although I did not specify how this will happen\nsince it&#39;s out of the scope of RSDL.\n\nLooking at how late they incorporate multiple interfaces and multiple\ninheritance of interfaces into WSDL (which is essentially RSDL/SHARED&#39;s\nbuilding blocks right from the scratch), it&#39;s truly beyond me... BTW these\nguys are Microsoft, IBM, etc. representatives...\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
