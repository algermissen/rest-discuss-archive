However, to make claims that failure to use only\nIANA-registe=\r\nred media-types when implementing a solution that uses the\nHTTP protocol is=\r\n a &quot;clear-cut violation&quot; of REST is false.\n\n1) In the HTTP spec, there simp=\r\nly is no requirement that media-types\nMUST, SHOULD, or even MAY (using the =\r\nlanguage of RFC documents) be\nregistered before they are used.\n2) Fielding&#39;=\r\ns dissertation lists a number of constraints that identify\nthe REST style. =\r\nUsing only media types that have been pre-registered\nwith the IANA is not a=\r\nmong them.\n\nFinally, =A0this continued focus on some _proof_ that there is =\r\na\n_requirement_ to do so is (to me) a waste of time and a distraction.\nIt w=\r\nould be far more interesting (to me, at least) to discuss the\n_reason_ behi=\r\nnd the advantages of media-type registries for\ndistributed network applicat=\r\nions.
