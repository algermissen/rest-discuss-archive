My first impression is that it looks really good from a\n&gt; resource modelling point of view, but it appears to break down in \nthe\n&gt; WSDL where operations rather than types are defined.\n\nI think workflow is a bad model for the Web for reasons that are \nanalogous to why RPC is a bad model.\n\nWorkflow is organized around procedures, not resources.\n\nRosettaNet started by trying to use a procedural workflow model but \nabandoned it for a conversational state alignment model.  I&#39;m not \nsuggesting the RosettaNet model for REST, becsuse RNet is a message-\npassing system, as in message-oriented SOAP.  \n\nBut I am pretty sure that REST also needs to adopt an appropriate \norchestration model that is different from procedure-oriented \nworkflow.  And that the REST model should be oriented around resource \nstate.  (Others have said similar things on the REST wiki.)\n\nI also think that a resource state model will end up being much \nsimpler than workflow.  \n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
