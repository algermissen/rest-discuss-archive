I certainly agree that as a\ngeneral statement, REST isn&#39;t testable as it is an architectural style\n... however ... I think that it is possible to make testable RESTful\npatterns. There will be more than one pattern, to be sure, but each\npattern will be testable.\n\nI am working on EARL test / assertion representations of my own\npattern and an engine to exercise EARL instances (hence the diagram I\nshowed the group last month). Having this would permit a web\napplication to claim a &#39;conformance level&#39; to a specific pattern -\njust as HTML can claim various WCAG conformance levels.\n\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/who/alan-dean/news\n\n"}}
