Queries are more complex than just a\nlist of keywords, and should be represented in xml. So my question is: how\ncould I send the query to the server ?\nThe obvious solution would be a POST, but as it is a search, GET would be\nmore convenient?\nAn other solution could be:\n    C: POST http://my.server.com/queries/\n    S: 201 Created\n         Location: http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234\n    C: GET\nhttp://my.server.com/results?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234\n    or even\n    C: GET\nhttp://some.other-server.org/search?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queri\nes/1234\nbut I&#39;d like to avoid to much round trip\n\nMay be a redirect to the GETed adress instead of the 201 created whould be\nthe solution ?\n(Other GETs can be done on this address without side effect).\n\nThe problem here is that the server has to manager &quot;saved&quot; queries, and to\ndelete them (when ???)\n\nAny ideas ?\n\nThanks\n\n-------------\nYannick Loiseau\nPhD Student in Information Reatrieval at Irit\nmailto: yloiseau@...\nmailto: loiseau@...\n-------------\n\n\n\n"}}
