The problem with \n&gt; this approach is that I can&#39;t address representations of a \n&gt; resource, only a resource. What would you suggest?\n\nI&#39;d agree that Picture is the resource and that there can \nbe two representations, the binary images and the XML/RDF.\n\nYou can use content negotiation (i.e. the Accept header) to \nretrieve alternate representations from the same URI. But that \ndoesn&#39;t address your addressing requirements. I&#39;d meet that \nby either: parameterising the url, e.g:\n\n/pictures/124?format=rdf\n\nOr by making the metadata a sub-ordinate resource:\n\n/picture/124/metadata\n\nI&#39;ve been leaning towards the latter approach lately, but I&#39;ve\nseen both in use and I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much to choose between \nthem.\n\nYou can do this and STILL support content negotiation though, \nso it&#39;s not either/or.\n\nOh, and also don&#39;t forget that you can encode the XML/RDF inside \nthe image itself too, just for completeness! :)\n\nHtH,\n\nL.\n--\nhttp://www.ldodds.com/blog\n\n\n\n\n"}}
