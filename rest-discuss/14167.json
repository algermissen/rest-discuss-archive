And AtomPub does a good job and serves as a lucid example. My  \npoint is that such media type semantics involve classification of  \nresources and that this is something that is not RESTful.\n\nWhile AtomPub is not very constraining because it emphazises server  \nflexibility for other problem spaces there might be a need for  \nrelatively strict specifications. I suspect that the resource  \nclassifications used in such specifications will create a kind of  \ncoupling that brings us very close to non-uniform interface style  \ncoupling.\n\nViewed from another angle:\n\nSomeone who is in charge of evolving a service is free to change the  \nservice in any way, as long as it meets all constraints defined in the  \nused hypermedia specs. No client will break, ever. I think that for  \nM2M scenarios you either cannot build any clients at all or the  \nhypermedia specs inevitably contain very strict rules.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Subbu published an article one\n&gt; year ago today on this very subject [4]. While I differ slightly on\n&gt; the details, the major parts are there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone else have a best practice on documenting media types and link  \n&gt; rels?\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#edef-LINK\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.12\n&gt; [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html#style-external\n&gt; [4] http://www.infoq.com/articles/subbu-allamaraju-rest\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Dec 16, 2009 at 15:27, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@... \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Dec 16, 2009, at 7:39 PM, Will Hartung wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The media-type would have informed me what\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;rel=&#39;next&#39;&quot; link means.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sure. But how did you know that it makes sense to write code that  \n&gt;&gt; looks for\n&gt;&gt; the rel=&quot;next&quot; in the first place? Or: how did you know it makes  \n&gt;&gt; sense to\n&gt;&gt; expect that the response would be available in application/atom+xml?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As a human, you do the GET, see what is returned and if you  \n&gt;&gt; understand it.\n&gt;&gt; Then, if you do, you know what you can do next. All fine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When coding a client, however, you need to know at design time that  \n&gt;&gt; it makes\n&gt;&gt; sense to expect application/atom+xml to be returned. There might be  \n&gt;&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; possible media types available, too, but you need some source of  \n&gt;&gt; information\n&gt;&gt; that is the source for this expectation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub, for example, does state that collections are available as\n&gt;&gt; application/atom+xml feed documents. And it needs to do so because\n&gt;&gt; otherwise, building a client would not be possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub cannot make that statement without using the term  \n&gt;&gt; &#39;collection&#39; and\n&gt;&gt; specifying how a client knows that a resource is a (sic!!)  \n&gt;&gt; collection[1]. An\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub collection is a resource kind (or class or category or role  \n&gt;&gt; type or\n&gt;&gt; type or whatever you name it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] And it does so (more or less implicitly) by saying that  \n&gt;&gt; whatever URIs\n&gt;&gt; you find in the href attributes of a service document&#39;s collection  \n&gt;&gt; elements\n&gt;&gt; refers to collections. When I see\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;collection href=&quot;http://foo/orders&quot;&gt; I know a bunch of things  \n&gt;&gt; about the\n&gt;&gt; resource identfied by http://foo/orders. E.g. I know that a GET on  \n&gt;&gt; it will\n&gt;&gt; return an Atom feed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
