Bowman wrote \n\n&gt;&gt; The point I was making is that the feed URL is more or less constant, so\nwhat is the point of submitting it (to Technorati) every time you post to or\nedit your weblog?\n\nWell, isn&#39;t a URL a URI, or identifier, so isn&#39;t it appropriate to tell\nTechnorati the identifier of the blog to ping?  That the identifer also\nhappens to be a locator is just convenient.  \n\nOTOH, this would not be RESTful because it is sending the logic, not the\nrepresentation (right?)\n\n&gt;&gt; Your feed should get a new timestamp whenever it&#39;s updated with new\ncontent.  The value of that timestamp may be PUT to the user&#39;s URL to change\nthe value in &lt;updated&gt; concurrently with your feed&#39;s timestamp being\nupdated.  \n\nBut doesn&#39;t that violate REST by posting the logic not the representation?\nIsn&#39;t the &lt;updated&gt; field considered logic in this case?\n\n&gt;&gt; REST is not concerned with application logic, only information\narchitecture.  There is no constraint in REST regarding data quality, so no\nof course you can&#39;t jump to any general conclusions about REST based on the\nimplementation specifics of this example.\n\nYour answer leads me to a question that I hadn&#39;t even begun to ask on the\nlist: Is REST always appropriate and if not, why and why not?  Feel free to\ndefer that answer to later.\n\n&gt;&gt; Technoresti would have an easier time filtering out DoS attacks than\nTechnorati by implementing access control on the assigned /{username} URL,\nwhereas Technorati uses one URL for everybody to POST to.\n\nSounds good.\n\n&gt;&gt; Technoresti would have a far better chance of being &quot;done correctly,&quot;\nsince there&#39;s no timestamp in the XML-RPC ping other than the POST\nsubmission time.  Technoresti would allow batch updates of multiple weblogs\nwith one PUT, on a once-per-day for all weblogs schedule, instead of once\nper post.  The spidering would be smarter with reliable timestamps to use as\na baseline which the application logic can refer to.\n\nBut are those benefits of REST over XML-RPC, or simply the fact that the\ncurrect implementation didn&#39;t attempt to solve those problems?\n\n&gt;&gt; if a user changes their handle on a web forum where they have tens of\nthousands of posts, that one change potentially updates tens of thousands of\nresources.  Forum apps all work that way now, but that doesn&#39;t make a single\none of &#39;em RESTful.\n\nGood example, thanks.\n\nOne final thing to clarify.  If http://technoresti.com/users/{username} is\nthe resource and &quot;&lt;updated&gt;2006-12-31T24:59:59Z&lt;/updated&gt;&quot; is the\nrepresentation, what is the name of the resource; i.e. what&#39;s it&#39;s noun?  I\ncan see having a profile at http://technoresti.com/users/{username} and then\nsubmitting a respresentation of my profile (name, email, blog urls), but the\n&lt;updated&gt; element doesn&#39;t seem right for a resource.  Doesn&#39;t this seem more\ncorrect? http://technoresti.com/users/{username}/{blog-id}/updated\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\nP.S.
