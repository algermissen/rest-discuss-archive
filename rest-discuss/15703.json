The URI you use is just the name of=\r\n a resource, URI is not telling you the structure (at least not to HTTP nor=\r\n REST).\n \nWhen you use /mySets/{set}/{item} as a URI, you are referring to =\r\none resource that happens to be an item in a set. Nothing else should matte=\r\nr. The Server will tell you if that exists or not, if that was deleted or n=\r\not. For practical reasons, sending a delete to a resource should end up wit=\r\nh the resource being inaccessible using that URI. If the resource does not =\r\nexist at all, that was the easiest job for the server, and may even return =\r\na 200 saying I did my job, you will not find that resource in that URI agai=\r\nn. If the server is kind and sincere, it will tell you it didn&#39;t found the =\r\nresource, meaning also it is inaccessible. That is as far as it should go. =\r\nDELETE is not to get info about anything else, and even less about a struct=\r\nure in the URI that nobody should take into account. If you NEED to know if=\r\n the item was or not found, ask for it previously issuing the DELETE, don&#39;t=\r\n relay on the DELETE response.\n\nIf your app wants to know about the reason =\r\nwhy any of the items in /mySets/{set} is found, then you may infer that may=\r\nbe the /mySets/{set} itself may not exist, and ask about it. When you send =\r\nto server the /mySets/{set}, a totally independent URI, then you are referr=\r\ning to that resource, which, for REST, is just another resource totally unr=\r\nelated to the item ones.\n\nSee now how should that be seen?\n\nCheers!\n\nWillia=\r\nm Martinez Pomares\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Martin&quot; &lt;martin.g=\r\nrotzke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; say I have a resource like\n&gt; /mySets/{set}/=\r\n{item}\n&gt; which provides a DELETE.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this resource is found and succes=\r\nsfully deleted a 204 will be returned. If this resource is not found (e.g. =\r\nbecause it has been deleted before) a 404 will be returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I wond=\r\ner which status code should be returned if the resource\n&gt; /mySets/{set}\n&gt; i=\r\ns not found.\n&gt; Also a 404? A 400?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not so happy about a 404 because=\r\n it lacks some semantics - the DELETE on the subresource (or subsubresource=\r\n) /mySets/{set}/{item} implies that /mySets/{set} exists. If this is not gi=\r\nven it might indicate a conflict or that the client is wrong in some way.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; While looking for appropriate response codes based on their name 409 (C=\r\nonflict), 410 (Gone) or 412 (Precondition Failed) sound interesting (see ht=\r\ntp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4 )) but their s=\r\nemantics does not match really.\n&gt; \n&gt; My current choice would be to return 4=\r\n00 (Bad Request), but this has also different semantics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have s=\r\nuggestions how to handle this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx && cheers,\n&gt; Martin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
