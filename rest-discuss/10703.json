That way you can PUT on each of those resources in one go if\n&gt;  you so wish.\n&gt;\n&gt;  See:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/archive/2008/04/06/batching-data-service-r\n&gt;  equests.aspx\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m not sure yet what I think about that proposal  but it certainly does\n&gt;  solve the problem of batching requests much better than http pipelining does\n&gt;  it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  And I personally find the whole POSt to http://server/resource/1,2,3,4 to be\n&gt;  akward, with low visibility and discoverability, but that&#39;s a matter of\n&gt;  taste :)\n\nBy definition, it&#39;s either discoverable or it&#39;s not REST.  If the\nrepresentation linking to that resource tells the client how to\nconstruct the URL, it&#39;s fully discoverable.  If it fails to tell the\nclient how, then the client has no way to construct the URL at all\nwithout violating HATEoAS.\n\nNow, if by &quot;low visibility and discoverability&quot; you mean &quot;doesn&#39;t\nconform directly to the rigid 1990s view of the URL space&quot;, then sure.\n REST does require a bit of a mental leap.  But I don&#39;t find &quot;REST is\nhard, let&#39;s go shopping!&quot; a very convincing argument. :)\n\nI&#39;ve thought a lot about the idea of nesting multiple requests in a\nmultipart payload.  The more I&#39;ve come to understand REST, the less\nuseful that technique has seemed.  If examples like the one above are\nmotivating it, it&#39;s tremendous overkill.  The URL space does not have\nto be rigid!  Free your mind! :)\n\n-- \nGary\nhttp://blog.extracheese.org\n\n"}}
