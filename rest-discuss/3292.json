Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; I am not clear on what you are expecting the HTTP OPTIONS method to\n&gt; return. For example suppose that this is the URL to a Web service\n&gt; resource that returns a list of parts:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts\n&gt; \n&gt; Now suppose that you do an HTTP OPTIONS to that URL:\n&gt; \n&gt;     OPTIONS http://www.parts.com/parts\n&gt; \n&gt; and somehow you specify in the OPTIONS method &quot;give me the service\n&gt; description&quot;.  What do you expect to receive back?  Are you expecting to\n&gt; receive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS\n&gt; response?  Let&#39;s assume that you do get the service description back as\n&gt; the payload.  Fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,\n&gt; e.g.,\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata\n&gt; \n&gt; How would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?\n\nCould you not return the link to the service in a &quot;Location&quot; header\non the response?\n\nrfc2616 says:\n\n   The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient\n   to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the\n   request or identification of a new resource.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t specifically mention this use of the Location header but\nI don&#39;t see why it couldn&#39;t be overloaded like that. That would\nrequire understanding of course.\n\n\nPossibly a more RESTy solution is to just provide a link in the\nentity returned from the metadata request.\n\n\n\n&gt; Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide\n&gt; metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink\n&gt; to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your\n&gt; company wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF\n&gt; description of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go\n&gt; off and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here&#39;s\n&gt; your URL:\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata\n&gt; \n&gt; Now you need some way to link your service description back to the\n&gt; parts service.  That&#39;s the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.\n\nAgain, that could use &quot;Location&quot; or a link in the returned\ndescription. Couldn&#39;t it?\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
