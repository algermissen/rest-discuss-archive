I still dislike the idea that REST is discussed in=\r\n the SOA Magazine as a web service technique. I think it should have its ow=\r\nn place as architectural style. Last time I looked around, there was none.\n=\r\n\nI&#39;ll check around again.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; First, thanks to you, Ivan,=\r\n for writing that blog post and for your\n&gt; work to chronicle REST activitie=\r\ns on the Web. I think you make several\n&gt; very good points. It&#39;s true that, =\r\nafter ten years, there is still not\n&gt; much accessible material on this very=\r\n important architectural style.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the problems I see is that some=\r\n very good scholarship on\n&gt; architectural styles is bottled up behind IEEE =\r\nand ACM pay walls. This\n&gt; makes it more difficult to build a large collecti=\r\non of information\n&gt; from which others can easily draw.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own feeling =\r\nis that, at this point in time, collecting as many of\n&gt; the varied and disp=\r\narate links, references, and examples as possible\n&gt; and offering them in a =\r\ntargeted search would go a long way to exposing\n&gt; a general theme and commo=\r\nn ground that has developed around Roy&#39;s\n&gt; initial work over the years.  Th=\r\nat includes making rest-discuss and\n&gt; other email archives (HTTP, etc.) sea=\r\nrchable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also think that many people active on this list are type to=\r\n keep\n&gt; themselves quite busy. I see very few folks here volunteering to ta=\r\nke\n&gt; up new tasks. That&#39;s a bummer since so many on this list have been\n&gt; h=\r\nere quite a while and have so much to offer the general community and\n&gt; pro=\r\nbably would offer their time if we could come up with ways to make\n&gt; it eas=\r\ny to contribute regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I, too, admit I&#39;m pretty tied up. But I&#39;m r=\r\neady to offer assistance\n&gt; where possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/b=\r\nlog/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 10, 2010 at 08:59, Ivan =C5=BDu=C5=BEak &lt;izu=\r\nzak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hey all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A few days ago I wrote a blog post on =\r\nwhy I think understanding REST\n&gt; &gt; is hard and what we can and *should* do =\r\nabout it -\n&gt; &gt; http://wp.me/poYaf-34. Since a lot of what I wrote was inspi=\r\nred by\n&gt; &gt; following this group and since this group is the most relevant (=\r\nonly?)\n&gt; &gt; place for discussing REST - I&#39;d like to know what you think. Sho=\r\nrt\n&gt; &gt; version (since the post is really long):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although there&#39;s a =\r\nlot of great blog posts, papers and mailing list\n&gt; &gt; discussions, the curre=\r\nnt material on REST is a mess which makes REST\n&gt; &gt; hard to understand and c=\r\nonfusing to discuss:\n&gt; &gt; * there is no agreed upon and widely used terminol=\r\nogy, but a lot of\n&gt; &gt; unexplained and overlapping terms,\n&gt; &gt; * discussions =\r\nare fragmented all over the web and often unnecessarily\n&gt; &gt; repeat previous=\r\n discussions,\n&gt; &gt; * there are no (formal or semi-formal) models of (importa=\r\nnt) concepts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, I think people involved in and enthusiasti=\r\nc about REST\n&gt; &gt; (mostly people on this group) should:\n&gt; &gt; 1. Agree that th=\r\nere is a problem worth fixing =E2=80&quot; do we think that we\n&gt; &gt; can create a =\r\nbetter, clearer and more systematized way of\n&gt; &gt; understanding and discussi=\r\nng about REST?\n&gt; &gt; 2. Express interest in fixing it =E2=80&quot; is this somethi=\r\nng people want to\n&gt; &gt; contribute their time to?\n&gt; &gt; 3. Agree on how to fix =\r\nit =E2=80&quot; what should be our output (a RESTopedia, a\n&gt; &gt; document, video t=\r\nutorials) and how would we all contribute to and\n&gt; &gt; moderate the process?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 4. Do it =E2=80&quot; spend time discussing and developing the output.\n&gt; &gt; 5=\r\n. Eat our dogfood =E2=80&quot; use whatever we produce. If we don=E2=80=99t use =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; terminology and models we agree upon, the the mess has only gotten\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; bigger.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Ivan (hoping that all of this doesn&#39;t sound=\r\n as babbling of an\n&gt; &gt; overeagerly naive megalomaniac)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
