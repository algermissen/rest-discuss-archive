The XBEL schema is nominally for use with\nbookmarks but it has a fairly generic hierarchical representation\nthat could be used with for other applications, such as weblog\norganization and tranformation to RSS. It&#39;s at the point where\nit can be looked at and commented on. I would welcome any\nfeedback that people have.\n\nI&#39;ve tried to follow my understanding of REST as closely as\npossible, so any comments with regards to the interface itself\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\nI&#39;m giving it the name &quot;Rebel&quot; for, a RE(ST API for X)BEL, not\nbecause there&#39;s anything particularly rebellious about it, but\nbecause I couldn&#39;t think of anything else that sounded better.\nIt&#39;s currently implemented in Java as a Servlet.\n\nI think there are interesting things that can be done with the\ninformation when it is stored in this way, beyond simply storing\nand managing bookmarks.\n\nThe details are here: http://www.xefer.com/rebel\n\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
