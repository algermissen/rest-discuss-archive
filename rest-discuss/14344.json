I have lots of trouble following anything you write,\nbecause you think of application development in terms of RDF and I do\nnot.  I was going to re-boot this thread to get it back on track, you\nbeat me to the GoodRelations ontology, though.  But your approach does\nhelp me flesh out my thoughts, and you&#39;re right, media type should be\nleft out of the Model, and addressed perhaps in the Analysis phase,\nwhere I propose that raw data is modeled as hypertext.\n\n-Eric\n\nStory Henry wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On 21 Dec 2009, at 04:26, Eric J. Bowman wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My suggestion is to dredge up and dust off ye olde shopping-cart\n&gt; &gt; example.  \n&gt; \n&gt; OK.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In brief:  Define resources in terms of standard media types and\n&gt; &gt; link relations, saving URI allocation and method selection for the\n&gt; &gt; implementation phase.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nearly right, but I would de-emphasise media types, until the last\n&gt; moment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is how to go about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Take a problem the is not client server specific. Ie: try\n&gt; something that spans domains, that requires distributed cooperation\n&gt; among agents. eg: Social Networks. Think big, and built simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. define your models using RDF. Take an example on foaf:\n&gt;    \n&gt;    http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\n&gt; \n&gt;    (and publish those models as linked data, so we have recursion)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Create Linked Data using those models. \n&gt;    Build linked data examples that span across domains. Ie. one\n&gt; resource is defined on my site, the other on yours and link between\n&gt; them. FOAF is a good example of this.\n&gt; \n&gt;   see for example how the data in this file points to data others\n&gt; have on their web site\n&gt; \n&gt;   curl  http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card\n&gt; \n&gt;    You can choose one or more media types to do this, with content\n&gt; negotiation. Ie: the same URL can return any number of\n&gt; representations: html, rdf/xml, n3, ...\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Create browsers of linked data\n&gt;  \n&gt;   eg, the foaf address book \n&gt;   https://sommer.dev.java.net/AddressBook.html\n&gt;   or web versions of the same\n&gt;   http://foaf-visualizer.org/\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Add security restfully\n&gt; \n&gt;   eg, foaf+ssl\n&gt;   http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf+ssl\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Now you can do shopping, in a RESTful manner using the\n&gt; GoodRelations ontology for example http://purl.org/goodrelations/\n&gt;    You probably just need to define certain types of resources, as\n&gt; being ShoppingCarts, and actions that one needs to do on those to\n&gt; make it possible for people to create buying agents.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
