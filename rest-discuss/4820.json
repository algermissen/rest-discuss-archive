Say you have a resource:\n&gt;  some-uri-space/sub-space/xyz I would have another resource\n&gt;  (some-uri-space/edit/xyz) that would give me a editable\n&gt;  representation of the above resource.\n\nInteresting. Your edit form resources are not subordinates to the actual \nresources you&#39;re editing.\n\nThis has the advantage that it makes it easy to exclude those resources \nusing /robots.txt.\n\n&gt;  Note that this resource exists only for browsers and GETting it\n&gt;  returns a From that is POSTed to some-uri-space/edit/xyz, which is\n&gt;  then interpreted as a PUT to some-uri-space/xyz on the server. I\n&gt;  achieve this by using some hidden Form fields that have a URI and a\n&gt;  method.\n\nI like it. Do you have corresponding URI spaces for delete, rename, and \nother operations?\n\n-- Jason\n\n"}}
