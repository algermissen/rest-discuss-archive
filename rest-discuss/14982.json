But I have to point out that www.mysite.com is not the same as\n&gt; my backend rest.mysite.com. The www site has no database in it. It is\n&gt; a simple system that just transforms ATOM feeds exactly like you\n&gt; describe. I don&#39;t want the www site to return anything but HTML. If\n&gt; someone wants the ATOM feed, I&#39;ll give them the backend REST resource\n&gt; URL.\n&gt; \n\nIf someone wants the Atom feed, they can find it by looking for a link\nrel=&#39;alternate&#39; with type=&#39;application/atom+xml&#39; (you may also use this\nlink relation to load a source file, instead of rel=&#39;source&#39;).  Browsers\ntend to do this automatically these days, and display an icon for feed\nsubscription.\n\nIf a request comes to www.mysite.com, presumably the default is to\nserve an index.html file.  However, if the request only has Accept:\napplication/atom+xml, you have three options.  First, a 404 response.\nSecond and third, conneg.\n\nYou can serve the Atom source as a 200 response with a Content-Location\nheader pointing to the rest.mysite.com backend.  Or you can respond\nwith a 301 redirect with a Location header pointing to the rest.mysite.\ncom backend.  This &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge on the server&#39;s part does not\nconstitute coupling.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
