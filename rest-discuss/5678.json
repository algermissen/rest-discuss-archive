wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to track bac=\r\nk to its origin the idea to use a shared\n&gt; &#39;intent semantic&#39; between client=\r\n and server along with a pure data\n&gt; submission semantic (&#39;process this&#39;). =\r\nDoes anyone know about\n&gt; additional (earlier) mentionings of this concept b=\r\nesides the\n&gt; following ones?\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP specifies the Expect header:\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.20\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark used int=\r\nent in the former version of RDFForms:\n&gt; http://markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Fo=\r\nrms/rdf-forms-old1.html\n&gt; There he mentions SOAP 1.1&#39;s SOAPAction and SOAP =\r\n1.2&#39;s action\n&gt; attribute as being a means to communicate an intent between =\r\nclient\n&gt; and server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark has also written &quot;Unraveling the Mystery of S=\r\nOAPAction&quot;:\n&gt; http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2331?wlg=3Dyes\n&gt; This essay=\r\n contains the Panel example with the use of an explicit\n&gt; cast to communica=\r\nte intent beyond the generic add() method (makes me\n&gt; wonder of the concept=\r\n of intent originates from the OO paradigma or\n&gt; even from the basic idea o=\r\nf type casting)\n&gt;\n&gt; That is all I know has been written about &#39;intent&#39; in t=\r\nhe broadest\n&gt; sense. Any additional pointers would be apprecieated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Asi=\r\nde:\n&gt; In this same essay Mark mentions that SOAPAction/action-feature\n&gt; act=\r\nually does not behave as he describes (Mark, correct me if I am\n&gt; misrepres=\r\nenting you). Looking at the SOAP specs I found that it\n&gt; refers to routing =\r\nas one possible use and I wonder if that is so\n&gt; different from what one wo=\r\nuld actually use &#39;intent&#39; for?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think a distinction must be made betwe=\r\nen receivers that hold state\n&gt; that is changed by the data submission (rece=\r\nivers the identity of\n&gt; which is important) and receivers that just perform=\r\n a certain kind of\n&gt; processing. I have allways thought of intent as being =\r\nprimarily\n&gt; useful when communicating with the latter ones since intent wou=\r\nld\n&gt; allow (a) receiver discovery by type (intent) and (b) distribution of\n=\r\n&gt; requests across any receiver of the same type (e.g. for load\n&gt; balancing)=\r\n. If I for example want to send an email, I do not really\n&gt; care which SMTP=\r\n server actually sends it.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, maybe the notion of routing (based on in=\r\ntent) is not so different\n&gt; after all?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________=\r\n____________________________________________________\n&gt; _______________\n&gt; Ja=\r\nn Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer\n&gt; http://jalgermissen.com\n&gt; Tugboat =\r\nConsulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;\n&gt; http://www.tugboat=\r\n.de\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
