Indeed, it might not work all the time in \n&gt;&gt; certain situations. If you were behind (in terms of \n&gt;&gt; DNS queries) a very restrictive DNS cache you might \n&gt;&gt; not be able to do dynamic names. \n\nIs this like the &quot;Some routers don&#39;t handle unreserved URL characters\ncorrectly when unencoded, so best to URL encode *everything*&quot; (but in\nreality there&#39;s no problem because those routers are so old that 99.9% of\nthem have died or been upgraded or replaced.) \n\nOr is it a significant enough concern not to ever depend on unknown\nsubdomains being passed through the public internet so the web server can\nhandle them using host headers?  Do you (or does anyone) know for sure on\nthis, or is it a hypothetical problem? \n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
