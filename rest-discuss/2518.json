So REST is some kind of \n&gt; logical extension\n&gt; &gt; of the existing web, incorporating the ideals formed from \n&gt; lessons learned\n&gt; &gt; with the web.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If REST were purely descriptive, this would be an odd \n&gt; discussion.  But we\n&gt; &gt; are attempting to use it prescriptively.  I interpret \n&gt; questions like &quot;does\n&gt; &gt; REST work?&quot; to mean &quot;does REST work prescriptively?&quot;.  I \n&gt; think everyone\n&gt; &gt; else does too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t attempt to use it prescriptively, though I know it probably\n&gt; looks this way.  When that happens, it&#39;s because there is \n&gt; some desirable\n&gt; set of properties that I&#39;m trying to achieve, and I know that they can\n&gt; only reasonably be had with some subset of REST&#39;s constraints.\n\nThat&#39;s a terribly subtle distinction.  There&#39;s no question that REST\n(via the Fielding paper) doesn&#39;t tell you what steps to follow.  In\nthat sense it&#39;s not prescriptive.  But when you talk about &quot;RESTifying&quot;\nsome service, you&#39;re almost certainly following some hidden process\nthat could easily (?) be documented.  InTheDarkPlace documented such a\nprocess here recently.  But we&#39;ll agree in advance that that process\nis not REST.\n\nWhether you call that prescriptive or descriptive -- I don&#39;t care\nwhat the correct word is -- people are using this as a design guide,\napplying it to all sorts of things that didn&#39;t start out as hypertext,\nso in that context &quot;does it work?&quot; seems quite reasonable (to me).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is most defintely *descriptive*.\n\nTechnically, Mark, REST was described in a thesis, but that doesn&#39;t\nmake REST descriptive.  It makes the thesis descriptive.  The thesis\nis careful to draw this very distinction, so I thought it appropriate\nto drag it out.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
