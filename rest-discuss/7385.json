According to [1] (section 3.3), the &#39;@&#39; character is\n&gt; &gt; legal in the URI path and does not require escaping.\n&gt; &gt; [1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t check rfc 2396, but rfc 3986 obsoletes it. Reading from  \n&gt; &quot;Reserved\n&gt; Characters&quot; section[1] it appears that you should percent encode  \n&gt; the &#39;@&#39;\n&gt; character, but I could be misreading. Can anyone on the list with more\n&gt; experience tell me if I&#39;m interpreting it incorrectly, and if so why?\n\nA URI generator should percent-encode reserved characters when they\nare not being used as delimiters, so that other layers that do use\nthem as delimiters can treat them specially without misinterpreting\nnormal data (e.g., a name that just happens to start with @ would\nbe encoded, whereas the delimiter used by Dream would not).\n\nIn other words, Dream is using a reserved character correctly.\nWhether or not @ is the best choice for that reserved character\nis a long story and probably depends on what URIs are allowed\n(some use @ in the path for other things) and whether or not it\ninterfaces with XPath processing (which uses @ for attribute names).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
