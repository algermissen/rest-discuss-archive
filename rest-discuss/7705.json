Not having the parameter value, but having the 1234 determined \nby the server and then the client informed by the 303 response works well.\n\n&gt; Any thoughts on the list? Is the mix of the two perhaps a better way, as in ;\n&gt; \n&gt;    POST / GET http://example.com/item/1234 , returns 404 (note no plural)\n&gt;    POST / GET http://example.com/items (plural for &#39;list&#39; operations)\n\nEither is RESTful, since no particular relationship between \nhttp://example.com/item/1234 and http://example.com/item is entailed. \nHowever it can certainly be guessed at, so it seems better URI design to \nhave one &quot;up the path&quot; from the other, though using the plural in both \ncases may make more sense http://example.com/items identifies the items \nand http://example.com/items/1234 identifies that one of the items \nnumbered 1234.\n\n\n"}}
