For instance, what would  \n&gt; the representation be when the resource creation failed? In your  \n&gt; model, a GET to that resource will continue to return a 202 + status  \n&gt; representation saying that its creation failed, but never a 404.\n\nIf you interpret a 202 to a get as a non-defining response, then when the\nresource does become available that url would return a 200 or a 404. The\nentity body of the 202 response would include the progress of the request. I\ndon&#39;t see why a non-commital answer would preclude switching the status code\nwhen the resource state becomes determined.\n\n&gt; By linking the 202 response to an auxiliary resource (such as the  \n&gt; status) that is GETtable, the client has a clearer indication of what  \n&gt; is going on, and a URI to the resource will be made available to the  \n&gt; client if and only if the server has managed to successfully create a  \n&gt; new resource (or delete a resource for the case of DELETE).\n\nI don&#39;t disagree with the use of an auxiliary resource with its own\ndocument, I am asking if such a general problem as async processing\nresulting in resources in an undetermined state is not better handled at the\nhttp level rather than at the document level.\n\nSeb\n\n\n\n"}}
