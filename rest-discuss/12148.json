This much is true: DELETE does\nnot provide a way for a client to specify multiple resources for\ndeletion in a single request.\n\nHowever, the server *is* free to respond to the deletion of one\nresource by also deleting other related resources. F.ex. if\nan AtomPub client deletes the last entry in a collection, the\nserver may delete the collection along with the entry. (It could\nbe a collection thatâ€™s maintained automatically, based on some\nproperty of entries added by clients to other collections.)\nThis is perfectly legitimate as long as the server takes\nresponsibility for these extra deletions, since the client did\nnot ask for them and therefore cannot be held liable.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
