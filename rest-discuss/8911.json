For XML a couple of extra tags is all you \nreally need.\n\nRelational/SQL databases are a very powerful tool for data management, \nand we can do a lot with them. In fact, they are so powerful and so \nuseful, that people who spend their lives with them tend to forget that \nthere are many data management tasks we can&#39;t do with them and even more \nthings we shouldn&#39;t do with them.\n\nI am reminded of the situation with numerical analysis in physics for \nthe last 50 years. Computers and numerical algorithms have been so \nincredibly good at solving so many previously unsolvable problems that \ntwo generations of physicists have done little but write programs. \nIndeed at the extreme some physicists believe that the universe is \nnothing more than one big computer program, just as at the extreme some \ndatabase practitioners believe that all problems can be reduced to \ntables. However neither belief is true.\n\nThere are solvable problems in physics that cannot be solved by \nnumerical analysis, and there are solvable problems in data management \nthat cannot be solved by SQL. We must be careful not to confuse our \ntools with the problem space. We must be even more careful not to limit \nthe problems we attempt to solve to the problems that are amenable to \nour tool of choice. And we must be especially careful not to do so when \ndesigning new tools for new problems.\n\nJSON is an instance of such myopia. JSON is designed to represent \nserialized JavaScript objects, nothing more. It does not work well when \nextended beyond that domain.\n\nPerhaps the XML world is at fault for this. On the one hand, the XML \ncommunity developed hideous, baroque APIs like DOM that nobody could \nlove. On the other hand, they never successfully explained to most \ndevelopers that XML could do more than serialize objects and database \ntables. So when developers switched to JSON, they never noticed what \nthey were losing in doing so. :-(\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
