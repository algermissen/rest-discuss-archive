Obviously this resource is \nuser-specific; it also has a single URL for all users.  That is, the \nresource is &quot;the list of buckets for the current user&quot;.  In the case of \nS3 the current user is indirectly specified via the Authorization: \nheader.  The book also mentions that an Allow: header could vary \ndepending on the Authorization: header, for example if the current user \nhas the ability to read but not update a resource, you&#39;d see only Allow: \nGET OPTIONS HEAD.\n\nI recall a discussion on this list however where this design (Allow: \nvaries by requesting user) was said to violate the HTTP specification.  \nI cannot now find this discussion however.  So I&#39;ll just throw this open:\n\n(1) Is it fine for a resource&#39;s bits to change per user, if it&#39;s defined \nin a user-relative way?  So, is &quot;Current Location of requesting user&quot; a \nvalid resource retrievable via HTTP?  I think the answer is a \nnoncontroversial yes, but wanted to double check before asking the followup:\n\n(2) Is it allowable for the Allow: header to reflect the metadata about \nwhat operations the requesting user can perform on the resource?\n\n-John\n\n\n"}}
