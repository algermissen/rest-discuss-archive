A form is a user interface.  Today forms are often\n&gt; used as user interfaces to GET and to POST (i.e. filling in an\n&gt; information request as opposed to submitting data). XForms is the\n&gt; replacement for HTML forms. Over time browsers will move to this more\n&gt; functional user interface and yet lose out on the ability to do\n&gt; form-based GET. I see that as a problem.\n\n\nI agree that it would be a problem if this were the case.  But in my\ntime on the HTML WG, including while work on XForms was being done\nthere, it was never presented as a replacement.\n\nIt wouldn&#39;t hurt to double check though.  Why don&#39;t you raise this on\nwww-forms?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
