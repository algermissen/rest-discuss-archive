I can refer to a \nscoped collection using nested resources like this:\n\n   GET /subjects/5     =&gt; biology\n\nThen\n\n   GET /subjects/5/activities\n\nWill return all the activities that cover the subject biology.\n\nNow I&#39;d like to add the subject biology to activity 18 but I don&#39;t \nneed to update any other part of the activity 18 resource.  It might \nbe clear to do this:\n\n   POST /subjects/5/activities/18/belongs_to\n\nA more natural language url form might look like this:\n\n   POST /activities/18/belongs_to/subjects/5\n\nOf course since Activities can have many Subjects and Subjects can \nhave many Activities then using an ORM like ActveRecord there is \neither a join table to connect the two models or a richer has_many \n:through table. A plain join table has no resource manifestation \nother than the relationship between the two resources -- the records \nin the join table have no ids that refer to them specifically.\n\nI&#39;m wondering of there are better ways to model this?\n\n"}}
