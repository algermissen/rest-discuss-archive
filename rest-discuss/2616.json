I don&#39;t know how to model\nthe act of repeating a function (or function series) arbitrarily\nmany times, but I think that a discrete repeat scope = 5 should\nsatisfy most critics.  Of course it&#39;s easy to hack the model to\nlarger scopes.\n\nSorry for not getting these models up sooner, and I&#39;m a bit bogged\ndown with the rewrite of a RESTful specification right now, with\nmanagement drunk of schedule pressures and postponing quality wherever\npossible.\n\nBear with me; I have some of this stuff on paper.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
