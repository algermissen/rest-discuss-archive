The big boys are waking up and \ndiscovering REST, and natur=\r\nally they want to protect all us little \ndevelopers from worrying our prett=\r\ny little heads about nasty things like \nHTTP and XML by creating easy-to-us=\r\ne REST frameworks:\n\nJSR-311 Java API for RESTful Web Services\nhttp://jcp.or=\r\ng/ &lt;http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=3D311&gt; en/jsr/detail?id=3D311\n\nRemember=\r\n, these are the same jokers who gave us servlets and the \nURLConnection cla=\r\nss as well as gems like JAX-RPC and JAX-WS. They still \nseem to believe tha=\r\nt these are actually good specs, and they are \nproposing to tunnel REST ser=\r\nvices through JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web \nServices) endpoints.\n\nThey also=\r\n seem to believe that &quot;building RESTful Web services using the \nJava Platfo=\r\nrm is significantly more complex than building SOAP-based \nservices&quot;. I don=\r\n&#39;t know that this is false, but if it&#39;s true it&#39;s only \nbecause Sun&#39;s HTTP =\r\nAPI were designed by architecture astronauts who \ndidn&#39;t actually understan=\r\nd HTTP. This proposal does not seem to be \naddressing the need for a decent=\r\n HTTP API on either the client or server \nside that actually follows RESTfu=\r\nl principles instead of fighting \nagainst them.\n\nTo give you an idea of the=\r\n background we&#39;re dealing with here, one of \nthe two people who wrote the p=\r\nroposal &quot;represents Sun on the W3C XML \nProtocol and W3C WS-Addressing work=\r\ning groups where he is co-editor of \nthe SOAP 1.2 and WS-Addressing 1.0 spe=\r\ncifications. Marc was \nco-specification lead for JAX-WS 2.0 (the Java API f=\r\nor Web Services) \ndeveloped at the JCP and has also served as Sun&#39;s technic=\r\nal lead and \nalternate board member at the Web Services Interoperability Or=\r\nganization \n(WS-I).&quot;\n\nThe other submitter seems to be a primary instigator =\r\nof the Fast Infoset \neffort to hide XML in binary goop.\n\nThis is like askin=\r\ng Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic \nParty platform.\n\nDo we=\r\n really want to trust these folks to define the official Java spec \nfor RES=\r\nT? Please read the JSR, and send comments to jsr-311-comments@\n&lt;mailto:jsr-=\r\n311-comments%40jcp.org&gt; jcp.org\n\nI hope we can derail this completely, but =\r\nwe probably can&#39;t. If not, are \nthere any JSR members here who might join t=\r\nhe working group and bring \nsome sanity and actual REST experience to the d=\r\nevelopment of the \neventual specification? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we ca=\r\nn at least limit \nthe damage.\n\n-- \n=EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold elharo@me=\r\ntalab. &lt;mailto:elharo%40metalab.unc.edu&gt;\nunc.edu\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just =\r\nPublished!\nhttp://www.cafeaula &lt;http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/&gt;\ni=\r\nt.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.\n&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/=\r\nISBN=3D0596527500/ref=3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA/&gt;\ncom/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D05965275=\r\n00/ref=3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_024F_01C7512B.7E11FC60\r\nContent-Type: application/ms-tnef;\n\tname=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_024F_01C7512B.7E11FC60--\r\n\n"}}
