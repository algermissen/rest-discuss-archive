So you can hypothesize, but your\nhypothecies don&#39;t match that which could be the only realisitic reality.\n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s biggest benefit is that it has been widely deployed but its \n&gt; &gt; complexity (namespaces, schemas, XSLT, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; All of these are opt-in. \n\nThere are not opt-in when a web service that I need to consume requires me\nto use them.  That&#39;s why I said my opinion was that XML with all its baggage\nworks best when you control the development of both the client and the\nserver.\n\n&gt; Although I think well-practiced \n&gt; namespaces (mustIgnore et al) are a huge win. \n\nAnd I think namespaces as implemented in XML are a pox on the web and\nsoftware/development in general. \n\n&gt; Actually XSLT \n&gt; is not even opt-in, it&#39;s completely orthogonal (well, unless \n&gt; you serve transformations to clients as a sort of \n&gt; code-on-demand approach, I suppose - a rather hypothetical scenario).\n\nAgain, you are making my previous point.\n\nNow don&#39;t take this as me saying &quot;Don&#39;t use XML&quot; just take it as me instead\nsaying &quot;Please don&#39;t force me to consume XML as my only option&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t\nadmonish me for choosing to serve JSON.&quot;\n\n&gt; I&#39;m with Stefan here - I seriously fail to see this.\n\nSee my reply to Stefan.\n\n&gt; So don&#39;t. You&#39;re not the first to say that having documents \n&gt; declare their type and thus how to validate them is \n&gt; backwards, nor is anything you say news to anyone who has \n&gt; bought into Schematron.\n\nOkay...\n\n&gt; XML is best used whenever your data is not completely rigidly \n&gt; structured and clients are wildly heterogenous.\n\nHuh?  That&#39;s my argument for when it is worse used, at least with namespaces\nand validation.  If you are arguing that it is best used in contexts where\nnamespaces and validation are not used I&#39;ll agree it&#39;s not harmful but will\nsave that it requires a lot of overhead to download and parse both from all\nthe extra characters and the fact that there are direct-to-object parsers\nare not common.\n\n&gt; (Of course, just because you&#39;re using XML doesn&#39;t \n&gt; automatically mean you&#39;ll end up with a well thought-out \n&gt; vocabulary. Most ad-hoc vocabs are mediocre or worse. That&#39;s \n&gt; hardly XML&#39;s fault.)\n\nIs that the &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people do&quot; argument?\n\n&gt; &gt; Personally I find the verbosity and all the extranious \n&gt; syntax of XML \n&gt; &gt; to be harder to read than JSON, not easier.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/01/03/all-markup-\n&gt; ends-up-looking-like-xml/\n\nI&#39;ll see your URL and raise you one:\nhttp://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d639d908-7fbc-40cd-8e3\n6-e6d48c07f659\nhttp://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=39842a17-781a-45c8-ade\n5-58286909226b\nhttp://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/01/03/45560.aspx\n\nBut back to your URL:\n\nQuoting Dare Obasanjo:\n======\nYou XML folks completely miss the point. JSON is important because it is\nbetter supported in the browser than XML. That&#39;s why it has taken hold.\nArguing that angle brackets, S-expressions and JSON syntax are all\nsemantically equivalent is the height of architecture astronautics[0] and\nCOMPLETELY misses the point. \n======\n\nQuoting David Megginson:\n======\nall modern browsers have support built-in for parsing XML safely, though the\ninterface they present to the programmer (DOM) is low-level and awkward, so\nin practice, you have to install some kind of separate library to simplify\nprocessing.\n...\nI don&#39;t claim that anyone else should have exactly the same experience as\nme, but it is worth noting that this is a pretty heavily subjective area.\n======\n\nQuoting John D. Mitchell: \n======\nWhile the nominal complicatedness is similar, note the clarity differences -\nparticularly in the last, most complicated example. The xml example is\nalmost completely un-scannable and so has to be (slowly, carefully) read.\nThe Lisp is easy/fast to scan. The JSON is somewhere in-between.\n...\nI think you&#39;re helping to prove my point. You&#39;ve been &quot;reading&quot; XML for so\nlong that you think that it&#39;s scannable.\nSeriously, there&#39;s a huge difference between in the ability to carefully\nread something and the ability to glance at it and get it that is, IMHO,\ngrossly underestimated by advocates of &quot;dense&quot; languages. This cost goes up\nas the length and complicatedness of the documents increases.\n======\n\nQuoting Masklinn:\n======\nWow. David, have you at no point considered refactoring your Lisp and JSON\nmarkups? They&#39;re horrible, you&#39;re piling crap on crap it&#39;s idiotic.\n======\n\nQuoting rektide:\n======\nthe thing I like about JSON is that it maps to a object oriented data\nstructure, and the tooling surrounding it is just about\nserial/deserialization. in comparison, the DOM data structure used by XML is\nimmensely frustrating to deal with. multiple text node children hanging off\nelements, content validation before you can .InnerText, theres just a never\nending rigamaroll to do what is ultimately a very very simple task, and i\nfor one do not enjoy writing such verbose kludgtastic code. the data\nstructures built by xml tooling just suck horrendous ass.\n======\n\nQuoting David Megginson again:\n====\nrektide: I think you hit on a major problem with XML in the browser - it&#39;s\nnot XML itself, but the DOM, which is an extremely awkward interface to use.\nPart of that is because DOM has to be able to handle mixed content as well\nas fielded data, but a lot of it is simply the DOM&#39;s design history.\n====\n\nAnd finally quoting Andrzej Taramina who quotes HL Mencken:\n==== \nMight be worth considering &#39;s thoughts on XML vs JSON vs LISP et all:\n&quot;We must accept the other fellow&#39;s religion, but only in the sense and to\nthe extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his\nchildren smart.&quot;\nXML vs JSON vs LISP, that would be the &quot;religion&quot; part.\n====\n\nGotta love the ending of rektide&#39;s quote about xml tooling sucking\nhorrendous ass. &#39;-)\n\nBut I think his point is that all the formats have benefits and XML may have\nsome benefits as complexities grow which I won&#39;t debate.  OTOH, I like to\nminimize complexity in web services as much as possible.\n\nAnyway, gotta love it when someone argues with someone else about that\nperson&#39;s opinion on what is usable for them... &#39;-)  \nBTW, if there is one thing that can really get my hackles up, its when\npeople argue that syntactical differences are just sugar...\n\nAs an aside, in reference to your comment on Messingson&#39;s blog: &quot;I used to\nhate XML. Then I discovered XPath.&quot;  For JSON it&#39;s called jQuery. \nHey, if the XML folks can argue for finding tools that make it easier, why\ncan&#39;t we? &#39;-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
