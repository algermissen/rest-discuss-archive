&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Note that whether to use COPY or not to is completely orthogonal.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Of course a server is free to implement COPY in an atomic way, and to\n&gt; expose that fact in some way.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing we forget about WebDAV is how it is built into things like\n&gt; &gt; winxp&#39; if you try and mount a filesystem and give a fully qualified\n&gt; &gt; host in\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NET USE z: &#92;&#92;people.apache.org&#92;~stevel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; the system will do a PROPFIND on people.apache.org before even trying\n&gt; &gt; the SAMBA level chit chat. You can verify this by setting up a logging\n&gt; &gt; proxy and mounting things. Which means that the OS would like to find\n&gt; &gt; DAV filesystems before SMB servers. As webdav embraces PUT, it means\n&gt; &gt; you get drag-drop putting of resources through the fairly mediocre GUI\n&gt; &gt; that is the winXP explorer shell.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  That may all be true, but I&#39;m not sure how this is relevant here?\n\nwell, given how often we complain about the lack of support for PUT in\nHTTP forms, the fact that every copy of WinXP has PUT support built in\nto the shell might actually be of interest,\n\n"}}
