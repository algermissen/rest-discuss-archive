This is a legitamate URI,\nbut it is essentially a &quot;discovered&quot; property (i.e., resource)\nthat the base resource implementer could not ever have\nanticipated.\n\nIt&#39;s up to the user of the resource to say what that resource &quot;is&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nSimon St. Laurent had this to say recently:\n&quot;For years, writing programs has meant identifying a set of structures and\nwriting code around those structures. Information comes later, and is made\nto conform to those structures. (Non-conformant data is often simply\nrejected.) Working with markup offers developers a different option, though\none that takes some getting used to: applying labels and structure to data,\nperhaps &#39;painting&#39; on the structure, rather than breaking the data into\nstrictly pre-defined pieces.\n\nThis is a large leap to make, and a path rather different from many of the\ndata-binding and data-modeling tools offered for developers wanting to use\nXML. This approach sees the information and the markup as primary, and not\nas a mere serialization of an object, table, or other predefined container.\nThis approach is more open to non-deterministic styles of markup, and\nrequires a different style of working with information. Mapping information\nbetween one set of fixed structures and another is a start, but only a small\nstep.&quot; [1]\n\n[1] http://monasticxml.org/humility.html\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, July 30, 2002 8:47 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Coincidence or correspondance?\n\n\nWarning: abstract theory ahead!\n\nProperties in semantic web languages differ from properties in\nprogramming languages in that they are global. The\nhttp://foo/bar/baz#prop property is the same whether it appears on a\nresource of type &quot;X&quot; or a resource of type &quot;Y&quot;. but different resources\ncan support different subsets of the global set of properties.\n\nMethods in REST differ from methods in programming languages in that\nthey are global. The POST or PROPFIND method are the same whether they\nappear on a resource of type &quot;X&quot; or a resource of type &quot;Y&quot;.\n\nIs this just a coincidence or a revelation of something deep in the\nnature of the web architecture?\n--\nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
