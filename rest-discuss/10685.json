Do you really believe  \n&gt; that, Mark? I think it&#39;s pretty darn clear what the TAG thinks the  \n&gt; software is doing:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Bob if he views the source of the form is assured that the  \n&gt; assigning authority issupporting an entire class of URIs of the  \n&gt; form: http://example.org/cityweather?city=CityName. ... Bob could,  \n&gt; with this assurance, write his ownsoftware to construct and use  \n&gt; such URIs to retrieve weather reports.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The TAG is clearly not suggesting that Bob is merely authorized by  \n&gt; the FORM to write generic FORM-parsing software as you suggest. On  \n&gt; the contrary, It is clearly stating that given the specific  \n&gt; &quot;weather URI&quot; parameters that appear in the FORM, Bob is authorized  \n&gt; to write software that can generate &quot;an entire class of URIs&quot; &quot;to  \n&gt; retrieve weather reports&quot;. In other words the software can use a  \n&gt; URI template.\n\nI don&#39;t see why we should care.  Anyone is &quot;authorized&quot; to write any  \nsoftware.\nAnyone is authorized to perform a GET on any URI.  The server will  \nrespond\nhowever it sees fit.  The document got stuck in the weeds somewhere and\nis struggling to make sense out of nonsense.\n\nDon&#39;t read too much into what is obviously a poor choice of words.\nWhat they meant to say is that some services correspond to a range\n(template) of URIs for which guessing the potential values in that\nrange is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, even if there turns\nout to be no resource for a given guess.  There are no guarantees\non the Web.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
