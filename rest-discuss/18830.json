Doing some \nreading on that, I rather quickly stumbled across articles pointing out \nthat &quot;AtomPub has failed&quot; and &quot;AtomPub is basically dead&quot;, suggesting \nthat everyone else uses JSON based REST services right now, eventually \npointing out that even the Google GData services are considered &quot;legacy&quot; \nand replaced by different approaches right now. On the other hand I \ndon&#39;t really see what could replace Atom or especially AtomPub talking \nabout providing a given data structure, a data and service semantics to \nallow for read/write interactions with a service in a somewhat sane, \nstandard way.\n\nSo to ask: If you were about to start a new RESTful project supposed to \nwork with existing &quot;standard&quot; tools, what kind of data representation \nwould you choose? Would you still go for Atom / AtomPub? Would you \nrather use some kind of JSON+HTTP? Something completely else?\n\nThanks in advance for any input,\nKristian\n\n"}}
