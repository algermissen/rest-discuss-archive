This is a big advantage the heavy web service people have. You \n&gt; right your code and then click a button or add an option to your \n&gt; compile and you get a webservice. You don&#39;t have to know anything \n&gt; about the web! (which is why they&#39;re crap of course... but also why \n&gt; they&#39;re popular). \n\nThat&#39;s true, even if I think that middle path exists, between low-level HTTP\nand high-level object-oriented languages. REST seems to be using an\nintermediary abstraction level that is Web-oriented but also protocol\nneutral (doesn&#39;t restrict communication to HTTP).\n\nWith the Restlet framework, we try to focus on this intermediary level of\nabstraction, even if HTTP/URI are the natural parents. We also support\nprotocols/schemes such as SMTP, FILE and JDBC. In the future, this should\nlet people use automated tools while keeping the core Web concepts in mind\n(Identifier, Resource and Representation), hopefully!\n\nThanks,\nJerome\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
