This  \nis equivalent to saying &quot;there exists&quot;.\n\nNow if you describe that start page you can say one thing clearly:\n\n&lt;https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage&gt; a xxx:StartPage .\n\nin english\n\n&lt;https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage&gt; is a start page.\n\nxxx being some name space where the definition of the class of  \nStartPages can be found.\n\nThe problem is that this start page returns information about the  \nuser that has logged in, and is specific to that session. If you  \nwanted to describe that information you would have to say something like\n\n&lt;https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage&gt; has a representation  \nthat describes Henry, one that describes James, one that descibes  \nJim, etc... But you cannot give those representations URLs (you could  \ngive them some arbitrary URN of course). As a result you cannot mail  \nthis information around to people, you cannot really use it to find  \nout who is who in a project on dev.java.net, etc, etc... Simply put:  \nall of these pages would be much better tied to a specific url.\n\nThe restful way to do this would be for the login page to redirect  \nyou to\n\n&lt;https://developers.java.net/bblfish&gt;\n&lt;https://developers.java.net/jag&gt;,\n&lt;https://developers.java.net/jim&gt;,\netc...\n\ndepending of course on who is logging in. Now you can talk about  \nthose pages clearly using URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers) which  \nare also the URLs at which you can get the information.\n\nIf you want to play in a global information space, make sure your  \nresources can be identified Universally.\n\nHenry\n\n[1] see my recent presentation\n     http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/semantic_web_birds_of_a1\n     or the video available from\n     http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/ \ngoogle_video_introduces_the_semantic\n&gt;\n&gt; On 5/16/07, Henry Story &lt;henry.story@...&gt; wrote:On 16 May  \n&gt; 2007, at 14:56, Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which application are you suggesting is badly architected?\n&gt; &gt; RDF, because it can&#39;t describe something simple like a common start\n&gt; &gt; page?\n&gt;\n&gt; RDF can describe the common start page. It&#39;s just that in order to do\n&gt; so you need a blank node, ie an\n&gt; unnamed resource to describe it. The need for blank nodes suggests a\n&gt; badly architected web application\n&gt; (if you are looking at it from the REST perspective of course).\n&gt; Whenever you have one resource that produced\n&gt; widely varying representations for each user, then it is an\n&gt; indication that there are a number of resources\n&gt; hiding behind that one resource. This is known to be the major\n&gt; criticism of SOAP btw.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Henry\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As an example, try describing a web resource using RDF. If you find\n&gt; &gt; it difficult to do, it&#39;s probably that the application is badly\n&gt; &gt; architected.  So for example on dev.java.net all users have the same\n&gt; &gt; start page url\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;          https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; so what is that page really naming? How is one going to describe  \n&gt; it ?\n&gt; &gt; One needs to describe it using some blank node such as\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       [] :representationOf &lt;StartPage&gt;;\n&gt; &gt;          :ownedBy &lt; http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt;;\n&gt; &gt;          ....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ie, there is no way to refer to the resource uniformly. The same is\n&gt; &gt; true of xmlrpc or soap messages.  Of course the correct way to set\n&gt; &gt; this up would be to give every person their own start page\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     @prefix sioc: &lt;http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns# &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt; https://www.dev.java.net/people/bblfish&gt; a sioc:User ;\n&gt; &gt;                sioc:email &lt;mailto:henry.story@... &gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
