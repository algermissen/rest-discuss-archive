Fielding &lt;fielding@gbiv. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:fielding%40gbiv.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; The ETag *header field* is a response header. The entity-tag value\n&gt;  &gt; contained within that header field may be used in *later* requests\n&gt;  &gt; for cache-related conditionals, like If-None-Match and If-Match.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The entity tag is actually metadata about the internal resource\n&gt;  &gt; mapping on the server -- it does not necessarily reflect anything\n&gt;  &gt; about the content (other than the premise that the value must\n&gt;  &gt; change whenever the content is changed). That is why it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; matter which status code is used or what content is supplied in\n&gt;  &gt; the response message, since the Etag is referring to the mapping\n&gt;  &gt; operation rather than the content of *this* message. Hence, the\n&gt;  &gt; ETag provided in a 201 response must be the entity-tag of the\n&gt;  &gt; mapping result after completing the resource-changing operation.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It is a tricky thing to understand, and the spec does a poor job\n&gt;  &gt; of explaining it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the logic that ETag should be provided with a 201 Created,\n&gt; should one be provided with a 304 Not Modified too?\n\nYes. &lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#status.304&gt;:\n\n&quot;The response MUST include the following header fields:\n\n     * Date, unless its omission is required by Section 14.18.1\n\nIf a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients \nadd their own Date to any response received without one (as already \nspecified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.\n\n     * ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent \nin a 200 response to the same request\n     * Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might \ndiffer from that sent in any previous response for the same variant&quot;\n\n&gt; What about empty ETags?\n&gt; \n&gt; 204 No Content\n&gt; ETag: &quot;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; or:\n&gt; \n&gt; 404 Not Found\n&gt; ETag: &quot;&quot;\n\nIn this case it&#39;s not empty, but consists of two characters. That being \nsaid, I think it&#39;s legal but I really wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some \nrecipients have trouble handling it.\n\nAnyway; it seems to me that a better place for this discussion would be \nthe HTTP working group&#39;s mailing list. In particular, because the topic \nof ETags upon PUT has been discussed over there as well.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
