Does anyone seriously\ndisagree with this statement of mine?\n\nThe REST approach to having a client request the deletion of all members\nof a collection, is for the server to instruct the client to call the\nDELETE method of each member resource in turn. This is possible using\nXforms 1.1, or with XHR, either one of which obeys the HEAS constraint.\nThe case this doesn&#39;t cover, atomic batch-deletion, is a good example\nuse-case for Code on Demand.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
