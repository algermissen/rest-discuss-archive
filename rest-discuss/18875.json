I&#39;m speaking of controls that would be\ndisplayed as plain text, maybe appended at the end of the text\nrepresentation as a tiny domain specific language. Nothing would\nchange to the processing rule of text/plain. But the presence of a\ncertain link relation would allow a user agent to parse the dsl and\nallow a person to activate them. In the context of a command line\ninterface, that could be practical.\n\nHow could a link relation could be add to a text/plain response?\n\nThanks,\n-- Philippe\n\n"}}
