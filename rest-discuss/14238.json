This is contrary to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; idea of the client *discovering* the transition at run time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t *know* this, it&#39;s just that if it isn&#39;t, then it can&#39;t  \n&gt; add\n&gt; &gt; line items.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if the developer does not know it - why does she code it in the\n&gt; first place?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, IOW: how do I know which possibilities to code for?\n&gt;\n&gt; The client developer codes for the behaviors he wants the client to  \n&gt; be able to perform.\n\nSure. But the client developer is not just doing anything that comes  \nto his mind. Instead, he uses descriptions of services (such as  \nAtomPub or OpenSearch) to get a general idea what would make sense to  \ndo! He is not just poking around in the Web trying to get Google to  \nrespond with an audio file to a search.\n\nNote that for human clients this is entirely different because these  \nclient in fact *can* simply react to whatever next state they are put  \nin. The do not have their own state machine. The do not follow an  \noverall goal. The human user does and aaventually is driven by the  \nhypermedia received by the user agent. Machine clients can never be  \nmade that passive with regard to their program flow.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; This was the point Andrew tried to make earlier in the thread:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Dec 17, 2009 at 1:10 AM, wahbedahbe &lt;andrew.wahbe@...&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You are making the mistake of starting with the service. You need to  \n&gt; start with the client... tell me more about this client. What event  \n&gt; causes a search for tickets to occur? Where does the data that goes  \n&gt; into the search parameters come from? Where does the new value for  \n&gt; the status come from? What happens after the status is updated?\n&gt;\n&gt; The hypermedia format drives the client. How can you define your  \n&gt; hypermedia format without first understanding and defining your  \n&gt; client?\n&gt;\n&gt; If the client&#39;s function is to manipulate line items in a purchase  \n&gt; order then the developer needs to code it to do so. If a client&#39;s  \n&gt; function is only to check the shipping address on a purchase order,  \n&gt; then it doesn&#39;t need to know about &quot;transitions&quot; for manipulating  \n&gt; line items and the developer doesn&#39;t need to code such knowledge  \n&gt; into it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I get the feeling that you think REST was supposed to enable a  \n&gt; universal learning client: from one URL the client can learn all  \n&gt; possible behaviors from the representations it receives. No machine  \n&gt; can yet to that. Spiders don&#39;t even come close, even though they are  \n&gt; the most universal machine client agents. The only client that is  \n&gt; such a universal learner is a human being sitting in front of a  \n&gt; browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure where you got your impression of how loose REST was  \n&gt; supposed to be. Roy did say that clients can depend on (be coded  \n&gt; for) media types and standard relations. A client must know these in  \n&gt; advance to interact with a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
