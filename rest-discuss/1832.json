It&#39;s interesting that it&#39;s also \n &gt; in the bag of socket-level modifications.  HTTP is exactly what it always \n &gt; was, but there are extensions happening underneath it in the transport \n &gt; layer.\n &gt; \n &gt; (Aside to Mark: I think that Allan&#39;s comment is not about a set of\n &gt; request/response pairs, but a single pair where the reply is sent in a\n &gt; time frame _completely_ different from the browser timeframe.\n &gt; \n &gt; Aside to Allan: correct me if I&#39;m putting words in your mouth.)\n\nNo, you got it right. The sequence is\n\n  1. Client sends request &quot;A&quot;\n  2. Server receives request &quot;A&quot;\n\n  3. Client does other stuff, including sending more requests\n  4. Server does other stuff, including servicing other requests\n\n  5. Some time later, server has something to say to client\n  6. Server sends what it has to say via response to &quot;A&quot;\n\nThe client did not have to poll. The server had to hang on to the\nstate. But in Marks request/202/poll to server also has to hang on to\nthe same state.\n\nIf the connection breaks, the client and server will each get an error\nbefore step 5. The server should simply drop the state since there&#39;s\nno way to recover w/o the client coming back. The client should go\nback to step 1 if it still wants the channel open.\n\n    Allan\n\n(And it was CRONUS, not CORBUS, I had a brain cramp on that\none.
