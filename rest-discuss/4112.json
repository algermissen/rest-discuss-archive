I think the\ncollective experience with RSS feeds (just to cite an example\nI am familiar with) shows that many software and content\nauthors still have trouble with basic interoperability issues\nlike character encoding and entity escaping.\n\nI would not be comfortable calling this a universal data syntax.\nI still wonder whether such a syntax exists.  Perhaps if it does\nindeed exist, we can do better than XML in a decade or two.\nI sure hope so, but even if we did, we would have oceans of data\nin XML files by then, so we would still need the ability to\naccommodate representations with different syntaxes within our\narchitecture.\n\nI don&#39;t think there is a need to couple REST to representations\nthat use XML as a language syntax.  I regard the fact that REST\ndoesn&#39;t dictate any particular representation syntax as a feature.\n\nWhat benefits would standardising on a single syntax bring?\n\nPS kudos on netkernel; very nice piece of work.\n\n\n"}}
