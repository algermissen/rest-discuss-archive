What is your=\r\n point of view on \n&gt; OpenSearch &quot;application/opensearchdescription+xml&quot; \n&gt; =\r\n(http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1)?\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems =\r\nto fall into your category of a media type that might as\n&gt; well have been c=\r\nonstructed using plain XHTML.\n&gt; \n\nActually, it falls into my category of &quot;t=\r\nhings that aren&#39;t media types.&quot;\nI don&#39;t know why it hasn&#39;t been approved, b=\r\nut you&#39;re right, I think it\nreinvents a whole lotta wheels in describing wh=\r\nat a search interface\nshould look like, without actually being a search int=\r\nerface... the\nwhole approach cries out for re-purposing as RDFa, such that =\r\nit can\nannotate search interfaces across forms languages.  Providing a sear=\r\nch\ninterface for Web queries just isn&#39;t a use case that&#39;s crying out for\nso=\r\nme other solution than HTML -- it&#39;s an IDL, not a self-documenting\nhypertex=\r\nt API.  Bear in mind that I&#39;m saying this in 20/20 hindsight;\nOpenSearch pr=\r\nedates RDFa.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I see one benfit of this media-type: if my browser recogn=\r\nize the\n&gt; media-type it can offer to save the search engine reference and u=\r\nse\n&gt; it for the browser&#39;s search box. But the use of a XHTML microformat\n&gt; =\r\ncould have been used as well.\n&gt;\n\nWhile at the same time, this approach can =\r\nbe taken too far.  But you&#39;re\nright, Opera can magic-wand any form, regardl=\r\ness of purpose, independent\nof media type (limited only by Opera&#39;s understa=\r\nnding of the data types).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One could even argue that ATOM falls into t=\r\nhe same category.\n&gt;\n\nNope -- HTML&#39;s shortcomings in describing collection/m=\r\nember semantics\nrequire a different markup language and processing model to=\r\n solve.  My\ndemo uses application/ x.xbel+xml (yeah, I need to add the &#39;x.&#39;=\r\n), a\ndata type which solves the problems of no collection/member semantics\n=\r\nin HTML, and no valid &quot;list of annotated links&quot; semantics in Atom.  The\nusa=\r\nge is distinct, as well, in that its intent is the exchange of\nbookmarks be=\r\ntween browsers and services, not rendering for display (an\nm2m data type, t=\r\nestable by humans via importing the document into\nbookmarks and looking at =\r\nthe results in the browser chrome), so the\nprocessing model isn&#39;t the same =\r\nas for HTML or Atom.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So ... it seems like any of the accepted *-XML me=\r\ndia-types might as\n&gt; well have been represented using XHTML?\n&gt; \n\nI disagree=\r\n.  SVG for example, does things I&#39;d not want to try in XHTML.\nWith a comple=\r\ntely different processing model.  The markup and processing\nmodel for a for=\r\nms language shouldn&#39;t vary based on the purpose of the\nform (search), that =\r\nmarkup and processing model has nothing to do with\nrepresenting or renderin=\r\ng vector-based images.  Same with VoiceXML/\nCCXML.  These use-cases aren&#39;t =\r\nsolved by using application/xml plus a\nschema; use-cases which are solved t=\r\nhat way are most likely better off\nusing well-defined, common-knowledge typ=\r\nes like HTML and Atom -- they&#39;re\ndata types; media types aren&#39;t meant as da=\r\nta-type identifiers, but as\nprocessing-model identifiers.\n\nI don&#39;t see how =\r\napplication/xslt+xml (XSLT 2+) could be done as\nannotated XHTML, given that=\r\n its processing model is Turing-complete and\nits intent is the transformati=\r\non of text rather than the description of\na hypertext API... but note that =\r\nXSLT may also be embedded within XHTML\nwithout changing the media type, bec=\r\nause handling embedded XSLT is part\nof the application/xhtml+xml processing=\r\n model.  RELAX NG should have a\n+xml media type, given that the processing =\r\nmodel of a schema language\nisn&#39;t otherwise described except by application/=\r\nrelax-ng-compact-syntax.\nMathML is another good example of something where =\r\nthe semantics of the\nmarkup lie outside the capabilities of HTML, even if t=\r\nhe purpose is\nrendering the data for human users.  See also DocBook, which =\r\nhas many\nsimilarities with HTML and indeed some overlapping markup semantic=\r\ns,\nyet has a completely different processing model.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would also appre=\r\nciate some examples of well-applied &quot;special&quot; (less \n&gt; known?) media-types =\r\n- just to get an understanding of when a new\n&gt; media type makes sense?\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nUnfortunately, many of the best examples, like SVG, lack media types at\nthe=\r\n moment, but this will eventually change.  Others, like application/\nmathml=\r\n+xml, represent examples of extending HTML, i.e. may be used with\na host la=\r\nnguage or may be standalone (while XForms requires a host\nlanguage but with=\r\nout a media type).  There aren&#39;t any hard-and-fast\nanswers here, it&#39;s very =\r\nmuch situation-dependent.  But, for my rule of\nthumb, I&#39;d say tell me why i=\r\nt can&#39;t be HTML, first.  Or Atom, or\nanything else.  REST is based on the p=\r\nrinciple of generality, meaning\nyour API probably isn&#39;t a unique snowflake =\r\nrequiring a new processing\nmodel to do something nobody&#39;s ever done before =\r\nin a browser (i.e. an\nHTML-driven search interface), AFAIC.  Or some other =\r\nuser-agent with\ncommodity status in the world-at-large, rather than requiri=\r\nng your own\nspecial user-agent to decipher.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
