Justin has proffered many excellent\n&gt; proposals which I have incorporated. As background, Justin is actively\n&gt; developing something against the diagram (I&#39;ll leave it to Justin to\n&gt; elaborate if he wants to).\n&gt;\n&gt; After quite a bit of effort, we think that the draft of v3 is ready\n&gt; for some peer review by the members of this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; The collective set of changes has resulted in a significantly\n&gt; different diagram (and, I hope, more accurate to the RFC2616 [2]).\n&gt;\n&gt; The Visio document that I use to edit the diagram is published on\n&gt; Google Code [3]. To make review easier (especially if people don&#39;t\n&gt; happen to have a copy of Visio) I have created a PNG [4] in the\n&gt; download section [5].\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean/http-headers-status.html\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\n&gt; [3] http://code.google.com/p/http-headers-status/\n&gt; [4]\n&gt; http://http-headers-status.googlecode.com/files/http-headers-status%20v3%20draft.png\n&gt; [5] http://code.google.com/p/http-headers-status/downloads/list\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
