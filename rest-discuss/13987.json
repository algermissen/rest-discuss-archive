I thought you were talking about not looking\ninside the body for performance reasons.  HTTP is designed so that\nan intermediary doesn&#39;t have to look inside the body (for performance\nreasons), but that is not a constraint of REST and thus it is common\nto have intermediaries that do want to look inside the body.\n\n&gt; I questioned the assertion because it is not uncommon to see\n&gt; gateway proxies mucking about in bodies, rewriting URIs etc.And while\n&gt; this is often criticized for all the obvious reasons, I wasn&#39;t aware\n&gt; of any well-defined rule that was being violated. SIP contains\n&gt; language like &quot;The proxy MUST NOT add to, modify, or remove the\n&gt; message body.&quot; so that sort of proxy behavior would be a violation of\n&gt; the protocol. I assumed that HTTP didn&#39;t contain this sort of language\n&gt; because it was overly restrictive (e.g. if you must resort to\n&gt; something like URI rewriting then you can as long as you are prepared\n&gt; to deal with the costs). Is this not the case?\n\nHTTP does not contain such a restriction because transducing proxies\nand mash-up gateways are considered features.  That is part of the\nREST style.\n\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m curious as to why this couldn&#39;t be a style issue. The\n&gt; closest thing I&#39;ve found to architectural style-like constraints for\n&gt; the SIP architecture is Rosenberg&#39;s Architecture and Design Principles\n&gt; for SIP (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rosenberg-sipping-sip-arch-01 \n&gt; ).\n&gt; It describes the &quot;Proxies are for routing&quot; principle which assigns a\n&gt; specific role to intermediaries -- similar to the roles assigned by\n&gt; the client-server constraint. One might argue that the SIP protocol\n&gt; constraint quoted above is derived from this principle. Is there some\n&gt; reason that an architectural style couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t contain a\n&gt; constraint that implies that intermediaries never modify message\n&gt; bodies?\n\nNo, that is a common constraint.  Not in REST, but certainly in\nother styles of interaction and in much of the design around the\ncore Internet protocols (the end-to-end principle).  However, it\nisn&#39;t quite right to call them intermediaries, at least if you are\nfollowing my definitions of software architecture.  Those are\ncalled connectors.\n\nAn intermediary is a component that is allowed to do intermediation,\nwhich in my opinion implies the ability to change the payload.\n\nSorry for the confusion.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
