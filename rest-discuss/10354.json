Thus implying HATEOS.\n&gt;\n&gt;What I am wondering about is - how does something lke\n&gt;url.com/search?s=temp1 and url.com/search?s=temp2 etc. look like in\n&gt;this graph? Is it a single node or infinites nodes? If it is a single\n&gt;node, then shouldn&#39;t GET always give the same representation?\n&gt;\n&gt;I know this might be a little academic, but it actually popped into my\n&gt;mind while I was reading RESTful Web Services.\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;Devdatta\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
