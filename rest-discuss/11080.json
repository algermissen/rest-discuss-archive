It&#39;s well worth the time=\r\n to understand how \nit works, and how Plan 9 accesses (and controls) resour=\r\nces, both local and remote.\n\n&quot;These systems depend on, advocate, and genera=\r\nlly push to the limit a fruitful idea: to \npresent their resources as files=\r\n in a hierarchical name space. The objects appearing as files \nmay represen=\r\nt stored data, but may also be devices, dynamic information sources, \ninter=\r\nfaces to services, and control points. The approach unifies and provides ba=\r\nsic naming, \nstructuring, and access control mechanisms for all system reso=\r\nurces. A simple underlying \nnetwork protocol, Styx, forms the core of the a=\r\nrchitecture by presenting a common \nlanguage for communication within the s=\r\nystem.&quot;\n\nGoogle it, or start here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P\nor here=\r\n : http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/4th_edition/styx\n\n\n-Don\n\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ivan Bodunov&quot; &lt;ivanbodunov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Many people often treat REST and RESTful HTTP as synonyms. \n&gt; Since these=\r\n are actually different, I was curious about other\n&gt; implementations of RES=\r\nT using different technologies than HTTP. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is Roy Fielding&#39;s &quot;wa=\r\nka&quot; (that is anyway based on HTTP).\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any other (well)known no=\r\nn-HTTP RESTful protocols\n&gt; successfully implemented/used?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Iv=\r\nan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
