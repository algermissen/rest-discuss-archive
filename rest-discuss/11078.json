Since this server makes\n&gt;&gt; some alterations to the document body that was POSTed, I\n&gt;&gt; think a 205 would be more appropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the server creates a new resource then 201 makes sense; otherwise, how\n&gt; will you know the location of the new resource? 205 is more for the case\n&gt; where you have an HTML form that you want to user to keep submitting over\n&gt; and over, with the form being cleared in between each submission. I don&#39;t\n&gt; even know if UAs implement that.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally, the server currently does not return a Location\n&gt;&gt; header. But the server authors are aware of this and are\n&gt;&gt; adding the Location header for both PUT and POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right. You can&#39;t interpret the ETag of a 201 response correctly without the\n&gt; Location header.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Brian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n"}}
