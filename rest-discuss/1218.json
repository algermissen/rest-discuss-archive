Tomorrow is the last\nday for comments on the FCC&#39;s proposal to call the Internet\nan &quot;information service&quot; for the entrenched broadband\ninterests.  Ostensibly, this decision is being made in\npreference over classifying broadband internet as a\n&quot;communications medium,&quot; which would place it under\nregulations like those phone companies are subject to.  It\nis therefore being characterized as a decision for\nderegulation versus regulation.\n\nAnybody who can, PLEASE send in a note saying this is not a\nquestion of whether regulation or deregulation is better\npolicy (this is just a smokescreen) -- it&#39;s a question of\nthe nature of the online medium:  Is it a &quot;content&quot; delivery\nsystem, or a communications medium characterized by its\nfundamental two-way protocols, one which brings profound new\ncapabilities to all citizens?\n\n*Please* send even just a short note to the FCC at\necfs@....\n\nIf you know any other constituencies that would want to put\na word in on this, please let them know.\n\nFrom Dave Farber&#39;s Interesting People list,\nfarber@....\n\nSeth Johnson\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: IP: : Comment on NPRM 02-33\nDate: Thu, 2 May 2002 15:32:22 -0500\nFrom: &quot;David Farber&quot; &lt;dfarber@...&gt;\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: &quot;David S.

I have a Ph.D. in Biology from the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, where I studied human\nspeech.  I spent 12 years, 1985-1998, at AT&T Bell Labs,\nwhere I served as Distinguished Member of Technical Staff. \nToday, I make my living as an independent commentator on\ntelecommunications.  While I serve on numerous advisory\nboards and have numerous clients, I am beholden to no\ncommercial interests.  I am writing as a concerned citizen\nof the United States, and I am writing with hope that recent\ngreat advances in communications technology -- and, more\nimportantly, in network architecture -- will become\navailable to all.\n\nIn my understanding, &quot;access&quot; involves connecting my\ncomputer (and other digital communications devices) to the\nInternet.  &quot;Information&quot; is quite different -- information\nis in the ones and zeros that enter my computer to be\nprocessed by it.  Information can flow into my devices over\na variety of &quot;access&quot; -- over a wire, over a cable, over an\noptical fiber, or through the air (either as radio-frequency\nenergy, or as light-wave energy).  That is, the same\nsequence of ones and zeros can enter my computer by any of\nthese access methods.  So to equate &quot;access&quot; with\n&quot;information&quot;, as does NPRM 02-33, is simply incorrect.\n\nIt was not always so.  The telephone network was developed\nto deliver one kind of information -- the human voice.  It\nwas engineered for voice, and it gave access to voice. \nEverything else that it carried (e.g., touch tones, modem\nsignals, signalling information to set up telephone calls)\nwas either an exception, or an adjunct to voice telephony. \nThe wire that came into the house could not be distinguished\nfrom the service it provided.  It was the same for\ntelevision and radio -- each had its own dedicated\ninfrastructure (be it a wire or a frequency band) to carry a\nspecific type of information.\n\nThe great advance of the Internet was that its fundamental\narchitecture separated &quot;access&quot; from &quot;information&quot;.  Any one\nof the various forms of access to the Internet puts one in\ntouch with an infinite array of information.  Furthermore,\nproviders of this information (information service\nproviders) do not own special infrastructure -- all they\nneed is a server and any of the several methods of Internet\naccess.  As a result, the Internet is wide-open to\ninnovation, and we have applications and services like\nemail, Web browsing (in all its manifestations), ecommerce,\nInternet telephony, streaming audio and video, chat and\ninstant messaging.  \n\nNot a single one of these information (and communications)\nservices was brought to market by a telephone company or a\ntelevision company or a cable operator or a broadcast radio\nnetwork.  No, access is a fundamentally different business\nfrom &quot;information service&quot;.  To equate &quot;broadband access&quot;\nand &quot;information service&quot; -- as NPRM 02-33 proposes -- would\nbe a horrendous step backwards.\n\nWithout separation, &quot;broadband access&quot; as an &quot;information\nservice&quot; is likely to resemble the failed Interactive TV\nexperiments of the early 1990s.  TV-on-speed is not &quot;the\nInternet&quot; -- and vice versa.\n\nDavid I\n-------\n\n\n************      WE HAVE MOVED!      ***************\nNew Snail-Mail Address, effective March 1, 2002:\nisen.com\n112 Orchard Street\nCos Cob CT 06807\nNew phone: 203-661-4798\n*--------------------isen.com----------------------* \nDavid S.
