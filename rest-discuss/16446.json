REST doesn&#39;t _require_ an HTTP response message\nwi=\r\nth a payload (or not, considering HEAD) to have _any_ response headers\nbesi=\r\ndes Status, Content-Type, and one or the other of Content-Length or\n&#39;Transf=\r\ner-Coding: chunked&#39;.\n\nGopher also supports self-descriptive messaging by us=\r\ning media type\nidentifiers.  This holds true for *any* protocol that has a =\r\nconcept of\nresource vs. representation.  If the server doesn&#39;t specify a\npr=\r\nocessing model, the entity is *meaningless* no matter how much other\ncontro=\r\nl data is present, unless clients and intermediaries resort to\nintrospectio=\r\nn -- which clearly violates REST.\n\nSo, yes, the absolutely-beyond-any-shado=\r\nw-of-doubt, most-important\naspect of RESTful self-descriptive messaging, re=\r\ngardless of protocol,\nis the media type identifier, for any response where =\r\nsuch identifier is\nrequired.  This is yet another of those fundamental issu=\r\nes which SHOULD\nNOT require any debate, so yet again, I&#39;m befuddled by the =\r\npushback.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Most xhtml representations on the web are served with a *wro=\r\nng* (not\n&gt; even just opaque!) content-type, and yet that seems to have scal=\r\ned ok.\n&gt; \n\nMost XHTML is served as text/html, which is allowed; what folks =\r\nget\nwrong are the rules for serving XHTML as text/html, detailed in XHTML\n1=\r\n.0 Appendix C.  The text/html identifier triggers a processing model\nthat w=\r\norks for the payload, regardless of its conformity to Appendix C.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
