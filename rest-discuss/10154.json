When I glance at an\nindex of dozens or hundreds of messages, the titles, as given in the\n&quot;Subject&quot; header fields, would be a great place to gauge my interest in\nreading the respective messages. That is, the titles would be a great\nplace to gauge my interest if people bothered to craft the titles to\nmatch the content. People frequently fail to do so, instead writing\ne-mail responses in which the topic wanders but the old title remains\n(excepting minor variations that e-mail user agents introduce). Did I\nmention how unpalatable this failure is when prioritizing one&#39;s reading?\n\nI expect that the overwhelming majority of people who read my\nobservations and recommendations will continue in poor form. The reason\nthat I now write is not to reform humanity. I write to vent my\nfrustration. If, along the way, I manage to influence anybody in a\npositive direction, I&#39;ll consider the influence to be a bonus.\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nEtan Wexler, who recently waded through a rash of messages with\nmisleading titles like &quot;RESTful design for Articles & Tags?&quot; (the\noriginal, reasonably titled message having archival copy\n&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10081&gt;).\n\n\n"}}
