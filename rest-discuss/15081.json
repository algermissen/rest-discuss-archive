The type attributes are only hints anyway, not guarantees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh? What do you mean they are not guarantees? If a link element says type=&quot;application/vnd.package.serviceName+xml&quot;, why would I not use it.. or why would it only be a hint? \n\nBecause the server might change between you looking at the type atribute and your actual request. The server will tell you what the media type of its response is right there, in the response. And you just need to deal with what you get.\n&gt; \n&gt;  It sounds like what you are saying is, if there is no type=&quot;&quot; with it, just make a call to it, and it will return back in the Content-Type of the response the media type. So then use that. Is that right?\n\nWell, of course :-) And even if there is a type attribute it is still the same. A type attribute is just another form of client driven content negotiation that removes the roundtrip you would have with a 300 Multiple Choices response: instead of selecting an alternative from the 300 response&#39;s body the server gives you the alternatives up front.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t quite understand tho.. what call am I making to the service? If for example I get back a service named xxyyzz, I set up my request with that URL, I don&#39;t know the media type, so I dont&#39; set Content-Type or Accept headers, because I simply don&#39;t know yet.\n\nWrong! You know what *you* can handle, right? That is what you put into the Accept header. The Accept header communicates the client&#39;s capabilities, not it&#39;s assumptions.\n\n\n&gt; I can&#39;t possibly know or guess at this point that the media type on the server side is set to handle application/vnd.package.xxyyzz+xml. So when I make a request to the service, it&#39;s going to return back with a media type not supported.\n\nActually, it should return a 406 Not Aceptable.\n\n&gt;  How can a machine/bot figure it out?\n\nAs I said: *you* know what *you* can handle. That is what you tell the server. \n\n&gt;  You say &quot;design your media types...&quot; I don&#39;t quite know what you mean by that.\n\nFor example: when you design a machine2machine shopping system, you need one (or several) media types to serialize the application states. Just as you need Atompub/Atom for blogging and OpenSearch for searching, and HTML for human targetted Web pages.\n\n*All* design activity when you create a REST service is specifying (or extending) media types (and/or link relations).\n\n\n&gt; I think you know Java/Jersey and how you set up a path to a service, and for get/put/delete/post/options, etc you use the annotations on the java methods and so forth. Each service I provide as part of my API would have each method for that service returning with response header of Content-Type set for the media type of that service. I don&#39;t understand tho what you mean by design your media types.\n\nTry this thought experiment: write a machine client to Amazon and design a media type application/shopping+xml that provides the necessary semantics for the machine client to e.g. select from a catalogue, compare prices, compare product features, place an order, cacncel an order, obtain a report on past orders, etc.\n\nSee http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?cat=13 for a more extensive treatment[1]. \n\nJan\n\n\n[1] I hope to soon continue that series, I am just too busy with other things\n\n&gt; Thanks Jan.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
