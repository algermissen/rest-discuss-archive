Back when it was written, RFC \n1808 distinguished between a query and a parameter.  RFC 2396 says this in \nappendix G.2:\n\n&quot;  Extensive testing of current client applications demonstrated that\n   the majority of deployed systems do not use the &quot;;&quot; character to\n   indicate trailing parameter information, and that the presence of a\n   semicolon in a path segment does not affect the relative parsing of\n   that segment.  Therefore, parameters have been removed as a separate\n   component and may now appear in any path segment.  Their influence\n   has been removed from the algorithm for resolving a relative URI\n   reference.  The resolution examples in Appendix C have been modified\n   to reflect this change.   &quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m curious about Matrix URIs [1]. Is anyone using them,\n&gt;and if so, what the benefits?\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m using them in the spirit of RFC 1808, although its only example is the \nFTP protocol&#39;s use of the semicolon to toggle text/binary. I wanted to be \nable to distinguish between a parameter and a query in the semantics of my \nURI allocation scheme.\n\nIt&#39;s a preference, when you see a ? in my URIs it really does indicate a \nquery.  On nytimes.com, ?pagewanted=print is a parameter, despite posing as a \nquery, the semantics aren&#39;t as clear.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve read the TimBL note referenced below but am still\n&gt;not 100% clear on the use of Matrix URIs as opposed\n&gt;to query strings.\n&gt;\n\nRFC 2396 again, sec. 3.3:\n\n&quot;  The path may consist of a sequence of path segments separated by a\n   single slash &quot;/&quot; character.  Within a path segment, the characters\n   &quot;/&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, and &quot;?&quot; are reserved.  Each path segment may include a\n   sequence of parameters, indicated by the semicolon &quot;;&quot; character.\n   The parameters are not significant to the parsing of relative\n   references.    &quot;\n\nCompliant URI parsers recognize the parameter as a reserved character, but \nwon&#39;t treat it any differently than a query string.  If you mix parameters \nand queries in a URI, the parser will break it down into just one array of \nname/value pairs. You can program your server to distinguish between the two.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Thoughts or pointers much appreciated.\n&gt;\n\nI think much of what Tim was writing about ended up being more practical as \npart of the fragment.  The lat/long example is the sort of &quot;parameter&quot; SVG \nimplements in the URI fragment, the client determines what portion of a \nlarger map to display based on lat/long, zoom factor etc. instead of using \nthe fragment in an HTML &quot;named anchor&quot; fashion.\n\nIf you have a bona-fide server-side parameter situation, I&#39;m all for using \nthe semicolon, particularly if you have multiple parameters to set i.e. a \nmatrix.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;L.\n&gt;\n&gt;[1]. http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
