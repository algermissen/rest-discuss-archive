Just recognize that you&#39;re doing this,\nand don&#39;t try to pretend that you&#39;re doing HTTP behind the gateway\nor that will just cause more trouble.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
