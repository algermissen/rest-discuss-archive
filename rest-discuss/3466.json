Their purpose is to \n&gt; represent =\r\ndifferent document expectations.  We should use \n&gt; them that way!\n\nA rich s=\r\net of MIME types is a good thing, but my issue with relying\non them for ext=\r\nracting different types of content from a single\nresource comes down to a c=\r\nouple of points:\n\n1.  How would you even know what content types are availa=\r\nble?  If\n    an indeterminate set of representations were associated with\n =\r\n   a resource, how would you even know what MIME types to chuck at it?\n\n2. =\r\n Different content types may have completely different\n    interfaces.  In =\r\nmy own application I happen to split\n    some types out into &quot;resource-spac=\r\nes&quot; that support \n    different methods: \n\n       /blog/x/y/z  GET only (HT=\r\nML document)\n       /rss/x/y/x   GET only (RSS 2.0 document)\n       /xbel/x=\r\n/y/z  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (XBEL document)\n\n    It wouldn&#39;t feel particul=\r\narly intuitive to have the available\n    methods change based on the Accept=\r\n: header or even a query\n    string.\n\n    I could see using a Accept: heade=\r\nr to distinguish different RSS \n    types from the resources in the /rss &quot;r=\r\nesource-space&quot; above because \n    they are at least clearly different repre=\r\nsentations of a similar \n    underlying type, but a unique URL (a la query =\r\nstring?) should be \n    available too. Perhaps the absence of either in the=\r\n request could \n    result in a 300 Multiple Choices, etc.\n\n"}}
