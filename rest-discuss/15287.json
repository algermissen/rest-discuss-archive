Since my\nrepresentations of choice (e.g. xhtml) have a &#39;class&#39; attribute on a\nlink, I&#39;m thinking of using that and having no [artificial] link\nrelation.  The class attribute is intended to describe the &quot;nature of\nthe content&quot; which seems to fit nicely in my scenario, but since\nthey&#39;re typically used to drive CSS I feel a bit wonky doing so and\nwanted to get some validation.  So, thoughts?\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
