It messes up scalability (adding\nnodes to a cluster) and starts to require &#39;sticky routing&#39; (getting a\nrequest to go to the same physical place as previous requests, in order to\nhave a high &#39;cache hit ratio&#39;) and other tricky designs. Many app servers\nalso have &#39;session replication&#39; which copies transient session data across\nthe cluster - kind of like writing it to a central database, but not really.\n\nI don&#39;t know the driving need for server session data, other than it being\none approach for performance optimization. There may be a real need there -\nespecially for UI based apps - but I&#39;m not very familiar with it.\n\n&gt; Which ones don&#39;t?\n\n\n\n"}}
