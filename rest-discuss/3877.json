It&#39;s an important difference.\n\nIn case it&#39;s the former, &quot;Allow&quot; specifies which methods are\n*implemented*, such as whether or not I choose to implement toString()\non some particular Java object of my own creation.  That toString()\nis even *on* java.lang.Object at all, is what I mean by &quot;meaningful&quot;;\nputting a &quot;walkDog()&quot; method on java.lang.Object would be an example of\n&quot;not meaningful&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know what he means by &quot;Content models&quot;.  RDF maybe?\n&gt; \n&gt; I might have introduced that term into the thread. But yes RDF would \n&gt; be a content model or, a &#39;model of data&#39;. XML itself isn&#39;t, but XML \n&gt; vocabs get you some of the way.\n\nOk, then maybe I agree with that part of his point.\n\nI disagree with his emphasis on schemas.  They are just syntactic\nrules, and normally used in an un-RESTful way (not self-descriptive).\nWhat you need is an architectural property called &quot;partial\nunderstanding&quot;[1] which allows machines to process the portion of a\ndocument that they can, rather than the all-or-nothing approach\ntypically taken in the XML+ schema world.  RDF is very well suited to\nthis, as is TopicMaps.\n\n [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-webarch-extlang#Requirements\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
