Clients _cannot_ assume that a PUT does a complete replacement;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is not the same issue. The question is what the message from the\n&gt; &gt; client means.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.) Must a server obey everything in a client message in order to return 2xx ?\n&gt; &gt; 2.) Do omissions in a client PUT message unset those portions, or do\n&gt; &gt; they mean only update the included elements.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The answer to #1 is: of course not.\n&gt; &gt; The answer to #2 is: they mean &quot;unset&quot;. (simple formula: turn on\n&gt; &gt; generic PUTs in Apache and observe its behavior)\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think you even need to go there with &quot;unset&quot;.  A PUT request\n&gt; requests that the server set the state of the targetted resource to\n&gt; that represented in the message.  If the server does that - as\n&gt; determined by the server - then 2xx.  If not, 4xx/5xx.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Unset&quot; suggests that the message, by leaving stuff out, is requesting\n&gt; that said stuff be explicitly set to something (like a default).  One\n&gt; could specify a media type which did that, but I don&#39;t know of any\n&gt; that do, and would consider it bad practice anyhow (PSVI anyone?).\n&gt;\n&gt; As to Nick&#39;s question, if interoperability depends on concensus rather\n&gt; than protocol, we&#39;re in big trouble.  PUT means what it says in 2616\n&gt; and I&#39;m content to work with that.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, if we&#39;re going to dig any deeper into this, I think examples\n&gt; would be very helpful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
