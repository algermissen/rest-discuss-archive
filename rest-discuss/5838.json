Fielding wrote:\n&gt;&gt; OTOH, a translation service like\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    /convert?format=pdf\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; can simply be a POST of file-upload with the response being the\n&gt;&gt; converted representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, that doesn&#39;t seem very RESTful.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why?  POST is RESTful too, when it is used correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is what confuses me.  My (naive) understanding is that every  \n&gt; URI represents a noun, that is, a resource.  The URL:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert\n&gt;\n&gt; seems like it represents a verb, especially when given parameters:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf\n\nPlaces are nouns, too.  All you are doing is giving the URI of a service\nthat performs stateless conversions.  The GET interface simply tells you\nhow to use the service (e.g., HTML form), there is no other resource\ninvolved, and there is no sustained benefit across multiple invocations\n(no reusable resources other than the service itself).\n\nI hate to quote myself, but in sec 5.2.1.2:\n\n   &quot;REST components perform actions on a resource by using a\n   representation to capture the current or intended state of that\n   resource and transferring that representation between components.&quot;\n\nso what you have defined above is a one-resource RESTful service that\nmerely reflects a different shade of state back to the client.\n\n&gt; or even when given other nouns:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/ \n&gt; get_it_here.html\n\nThat&#39;s a different beast -- it is a gateway, and it would &quot;look&quot;\nmore RESTful simply by choosing a different URI syntax, e.g.\n\n   http://myconverter.com/pdf/http://example.com/get_it_here.html\n\n(naming scripts, including .cgi, and using path components versus\nquery parameters are all equivalent aside from some caching heuristics).\nThe presence of that gateway provides a parallel world of resources\n(hopefully they would have the sense to block their own site\nfrom being included within itself).\n\nI guess you could say that is a more RESTful service than one that\nonly converted the input of forms. [OTOH, I am not entirely convinced\nthat &quot;RESTful&quot; is a meaningful term, since for me REST is a particular\narchitectural style with black&white constraints, whereas I use the\nterm &quot;principled design&quot; for discussion of tradeoffs. *shrug*]\nI guess &quot;more resources&quot; would have to be &quot;more RESTful&quot;.\n\n&gt; So, if I read Roy correctly, the service described by that URL is  \n&gt; -- or at least could be -- RESTful. Does this mean that the belief  \n&gt; &quot;URLs must represent nouns&quot; is a complete myth?  Or is there  \n&gt; something else going on here?\n\nDon&#39;t get carried away. You won&#39;t find a constraint about &quot;nouns&quot;\nanywhere in my dissertation.  It talks about resources, as in\n*re*sources, because that is what we want from a distributed\nhypermedia system (the ability to reuse those information sources\nthrough the provision of links).  Services that are merely end-points\nare allowed within that model, but they aren&#39;t very interesting\nbecause they only amount to one resource.  The really interesting\nservices provide many resources.\n\nNote that this is just another way of restating Reed&#39;s law in\nrelation to Metcalfe&#39;s law.\n\n   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
