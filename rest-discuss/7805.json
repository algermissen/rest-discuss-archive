Have the user observe some property of the system to determine\n&gt; whether to retry themselves. In SCADA this might be to observe a change\n&gt; in voltage before deciding whether or not to retry a circuit-breaker\n&gt; trip. This can be automated as another SCADA concept: &quot;Target state\n&gt; monitoring&quot;. Regardless of the reponse we recieved, did the resource\n&gt; actually reach the state we intended?\n\nI&#39;ve found this approach useful in the past, but with a caveat; if you\nlook for a specific value then that would be an implementation\ndependency.\n\nA technique I&#39;ve used once was to have the client send an HTTP header\nin the POST request which played a role sort of like a client-side\netag with respect to the request body.  The server, upon receiving the\nmessage and updating the state of the resource, would return another\nheader containing a hash of the last days worth of tags (which wasn&#39;t\nmany) on GET requests to that resource so that it could check if *its*\nupdate was applied.\n\nInteresting post...\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
