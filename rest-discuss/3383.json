error\nmessages.\n\ni&#39;ve played with the SetHandler and Action apache directives, putting\nthem in a &lt;Location&gt; such as:\n\n   &lt;Location /test &gt;\n     Action url-dispatch /cgi-bin/handler.pl\n     SetHandler url-dispatch\n   &lt;/Location&gt;\n\nwhat i want is for any URL request for, say, \n\n   http://my.server.com/test/departments\n   http://my.server.com/test/departments/engineering\n   http://my.server.com/test/faculty\n   http://my.server.com/test/faculty/tbsmith\n   http://my.server.com/test/departments/engineering/workingpapers/jan2003\n\n   etc., etc.\n\nthe above urls to all go to the same handler.. which then parses it\nand sends it to the correct sub-script, etc.. i don&#39;t want to have to\nactually have the test directory (or subdirectories) exist.\n\ni have been through the apache docs a ba-zillion times, and looked\nthrough newsgroups, forums, etc etc etc.. looked here and on pauls\nREST pages and the REST wiki.. spent time with altavista/google, even\nscoured computer shelves at barnes & noble.. but i can&#39;t seem to\nfigure out how to do this.. \n\ni don&#39;t want to have to go through the trouble of setting up re-write\nrules (using mod-rewrite).. but is that what people generally do?\n\nor is the SetHandler/Action way the easier way, but i&#39;m just missing\nsomething? .. what am i doing wrong?\n\nalternatively, is there a tutorial / directions on this somewhere?\n\nfinally, what word/term/jargon does one even *use* to refer to this\nphenomenon or technique? i&#39;ve looked stuff up under &quot;dispatcher&quot;, or\n&quot;URL&quot;, or &quot;cgi&quot; or &quot;script&quot;, or even with specific apache terms like\n&quot;SetHandler&quot;.. but is there generally a name for this &quot;technique&quot; so\nthat i can even know how to refer to it or how to look for it?\n\ni&#39;m ashamed to ask such a basic question, but i would be very grateful\nif anyone could point me in the right direction..\n\nthanks.\njeff stern\n\n\n\n"}}
