Bjorg wrote:\n&gt; I have a Host service that is responsible for managing all\n&gt; services/resources in the Dream environment. There are two kinds of\n&gt; interactions I find problematic to map.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first one is blueprint registration. A blueprint is an XML\n&gt; document that tells the host what assembly/library to use and what\n&gt; service definitions it contains. Registering a blueprint is done by\n&gt; sending a blueprint to:\n&gt; POST /host/register\n&gt; \n&gt; The second operation is instantiating a service. In order to\n&gt; instantiate a service, a configuration XML document must be sent to\n&gt; the Host. This is achieved by doing:\n&gt; POST /host/start\n&gt; \n&gt; In both cases, the document sent has &quot;application/xml&quot; as mime type. \n&gt; If another type gets sent, it is converted to &quot;application/xml&quot; if\n&gt; possible (e.g. application/json, text/javascript, text/php, and other\n&gt; supported XML mappings).\n\nI think that both of these cases sound OK on the surface, though may do\nwith some fine tuning. I think when you talk about your behaviour\npattern there can be exteremes in what you do. One would be to put a\nmethod invocation into the content. Another would be to lean towards the\ndirection you seem to be going in these two cases. In fact, I would cast\nthem as two different patterns.\n\nLet&#39;s consider the blueprint case. You want the server to store a\nblueprint, so you give your blueprint to the register resource. This\nactually sounds more like your container pattern. You POST the blueprint\nto the factory resource. The return verb is &quot;Created&quot;, with a location\nheader that points you to the created resource. You could update the\nblueprint with a PUT, and deregister the blueprint by DELETE-ing the\ncreated resource. Your server could be replaced by a range of possible\nblueprint-storage systems, and the client would continue to work. It\nwould just issue its POST to whatever it was configured with.\n\nInstantiation also sounds like your container pattern to me. This time\nyou are posting the state of a new service (which includes\nconfiguration) to a service factory. It would create a resource to\nrepresent the ongoing state of the service. A DELETE would destroy the\nservice, a PUT would change its state.\n\nI suggest that you give some additional thought to:\n* The naming of factory resources. They both mean &quot;create state when\nPOSTed&quot;, and so does every other resource in the architecture. I would\njust call them something like &quot;/blueprints&quot; and &quot;/services&quot;.\n* Your content types. You are currently indicating the file format, but\nnot the kind of information you are transferring in your document. File\nformat is important when multiple encodings of an abstract model are\npermitted, but identifying the kind of information is more important. I\nwould be thinking along the lines of &quot;application/something-blueprint&quot;,\n&quot;application/something-service&quot;. Though, you may need to have a\ndifferent content type for each kind of configuation you have for the\nlatter to really make sense.\n* What happens to the state you transferrred afteer you transfer it. Is\nit accessible via a new resource (Created)? Does it get mapped into the\nfactory resource (OK)? Or, is it swallowed by the factory resource\nleaving no visible handles to work with (No Content)? All three are\nnormally legal, and clients should be written to deal with any one of\nthese being returned.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
