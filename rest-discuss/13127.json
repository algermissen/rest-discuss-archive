If it&#39;s the former, the\n&gt;&gt; case is not necessarily stronger for HTTP conneg - but parties such as\n&gt;&gt; browser vendors and WHATWG should be encouraged to provide the\n&gt;&gt; mechanisms necessary to pursue this alternative, non-conflicting,\n&gt;&gt; approach to content negotiation.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; As far as my understanding of your question goes, you&#39;re trying to define an\n&gt; identifier of a representation as URI of resource, plus verb, plus whatever\n&gt; message headers impact on the selection of the representation.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nNot an &#39;identifier&#39;, as such; just the full state transition (including \ncontrol data) required to select a given representation.\n\n&gt; I make the argument that one shouldn&#39;t try to define such an identifier. The\n&gt; identifier of a resource is enough, and if it is the case that you want to\n&gt; identify a specific representation, then making that representation a\n&gt; resource ought to be enough.\n&gt;   \n\nI understand that a representation can be &#39;made a resource&#39;, although \nthe phrase &#39;treated as if it were&#39; would be more appropriate.\n\nIt&#39;s slightly confusing when you state that an identifier to a resource \nis &#39;enough&#39;, and then immediately contradict this position by \nentertaining &#39;the case that you want to identify a specific representation&#39;.\n\nSo it&#39;s hard, from that, to make sense of whether or not treating a \nrepresentation as a resource &#39;ought to be enough&#39;. This is particularly \napparent given, as I mentioned before, the only significant benefit from \ndoing this is that you get *plain text* hyperlinks to your \nrepresentations - the value of this is questionable if an identifier to \na resource is &#39;enough&#39; in the first place.\n\n&gt; The state transition is the result of dereferencing such identifier, and is\n&gt; dependent on the state of the application. As such, it is of course\n&gt; dependent on the current state the client has, if any, and the current state\n&gt; the server holds.\n&gt;   \n\nIf it is possible for a hyperlink to include control data, then a \nhypermedia driven state transition is more than simply dereferencing an \nhref URI.\n\n&gt; I just don&#39;t see what the conneg of an entity body has to do with the state\n&gt; transition, I see them at different levels in the http layers, and I\n&gt; certainly have modelled it that way in my framework.\n&gt;   \n\n*Representational* State Transfer (?)\n\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
