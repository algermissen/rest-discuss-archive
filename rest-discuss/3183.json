I am going to post a few \nscenerios and what I think the correct behavior should be and would \nlike some help on whether or not I am understanding things correctly.\n\nLets say I have an address book which contains contacts stored using \na server defined ID.  Each contact contains a name, phone number and \nemail address.\n\nAdding a new contact (I belive this is correct):\n\nPOST new contact to /addressbook, server returns 201 along with the \nURI of the new contact.\n\nModify a contact (This is where I need help):\n\nI want to modify only the name for the resource located \nat /addressbook/000001, do I POST the changes to the name or do I \nPUT them.  Also, do I need to PUT the entire record or just the \nchanges?\n\nThanks for the help,\n\nJosh\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
