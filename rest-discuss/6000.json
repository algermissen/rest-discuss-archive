Cookies are all we&#39;ve got for \n&gt; this, and there&#39;s negative energy applied to their use. If the advice is \n&gt; &quot;don&#39;t use cookies&quot;, then what&#39;s going to happen (as it is unavoidable \n&gt; for many applications to require a &#39;session token&#39;) is that either \n&gt; people are going to start doing crazy things with HTTP headers, or \n&gt; putting session state in URLs. Either of those two outcomes are far \n&gt; worse than using cookies, they will lead to a very broken web.\n\nIf you look over here [1], you&#39;ll see talk of &#39;Two Webs&#39;. I can barely \naccept &#39;Web Two&#39;, but &#39;Two Webs&#39; is madness.\n\nIsn&#39;t it obvious that where Microsoft is looking wrong? HTTP is about to \nhave its day in the sun (not that HTTP isn&#39;t already an extremely \nimportant technology, but I think you know what I mean), and people are \nlabelling it as &#39;REST&#39; (thankfully Tim Bray is touting the phrase &#39;web \nstyle&#39;). Then there&#39;s talk of &#39;Two Webs&#39;. Stop!\n\nThe place to fix &#39;sloppy HTML and messed up headers&#39; is not by trying to \nhave &#39;Two Webs&#39;. It&#39;s by having a set of &#39;compliant&#39; resources, and a \nset of &#39;non-compliant but backward compatible resources&#39;. A few \nheuristics on HTTP headers and a little redirection and the problem is \nsolved.\n\nI&#39;m really concerned that as people jump on the &#39;REST&#39; bandwagon that \nthey are going to start doing things with HTTP headers that are \nfundamentally a bad idea. It&#39;s URI which is the awesome part of the web, \nmore so than HTTP. HTTP is just the humble transfer protocol. URI allow \nyou to identify everything in the known universe and GET at it.\n\n[1] \nhttp://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=929a7fd6-1dfc-43f4-a549-d2c9fa873655\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
