But I don&#39;t see\n&gt; why using AtomPub makes any change? I still have to POST a domain\n&gt; specific media type &lt;order&gt;? So having a generic media type like\n&gt; AtomPub doesn&#39;t remove the need for domain specific stuff?\n&gt; \n\nREST is not about distributed objects, it&#39;s about distributed object\ninterfaces.  Domain-specific vocabulary isn&#39;t exposed at the protocol\nlayer, it&#39;s embedded within generic-media-type representations.\n\nThink of anything you&#39;ve ever ordered online.  The interface is HTML,\nnot some domain-specific media type.  Yet somehow this works.  What \nyou POST is really just some name-value pairs.  HTML has loads of\nsemantics for expressing name-value pairs.\n\nWhat HTML lacks is a way of expressing the meaning of a name.  Which is\nwhere RDFa comes in.  The GoodRelations ontology allows decoupled\nclients to determine that a name refers to a part #, and another name\nrefers to the unit price, allowing an agent to comparison-shop between\nmultiple services whose markup varies widely.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
