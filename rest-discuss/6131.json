Just don&#39;t expose the individual variants. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\nUse only the cool-uri. \n&gt; \n\nBut I want to retain access to the alternate re=\r\npresentations.  Also, You can solve the URI-aliasing problem that way, but =\r\nnot the other problem: Setting up content negotiation for two variants resu=\r\nlts in untold numbers of &quot;cache aliases&quot;, one for each ACCEPT header out th=\r\nere. After being written to cache (or a pointer is created) most of these l=\r\nikely LRU-expire before ever getting served from cache, while diluting the =\r\ncache hits (and retention probability) on the representations which match m=\r\nainstream clients. \n\nBy setting cache-control:private on all responses whic=\r\nh don&#39;t set VARY:COOKIE we can limit caches to one copy or pointer for each=\r\n representation, instead of one for each ACCEPT string. This situation gets=\r\n worse when you consider our browser-sorting algorithm actually sets VARY:A=\r\nCCEPT, ACCEPT-ENCODING, USER-AGENT. I think the term for that many possibil=\r\nities is &quot;Sagans and Sagans&quot;. ;-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is where representational coo=\r\nkies come in. After negotiating with a \n&gt;&gt; client, why not &quot;bookmark&quot; the r=\r\nesult? Does the same client which has \n&gt;&gt; undergone negotiation for the /er=\r\nic request have to be subjected to content \n&gt;&gt; negotiation on all subsequen=\r\nt requests for /image resources? Won&#39;t the \n&gt;&gt; result be the same, each tim=\r\ne that client negotiates with the \n&gt;&gt; server? \n&gt; \n&gt;What if it changes it&#39;s =\r\npreferred representation? \n&gt; \n\nThat is a valid question, we&#39;ve experimented=\r\n with setting expire times on the cookies. But, how important is it to hand=\r\nle such an unlikely case? \n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n"}}
