Maybe\n&gt;&gt; I am just not grasping the finer details, but this doesn&#39;t seem like a\n&gt;&gt; valid REST approach.  And to complicate it more, suppose that I had\n&gt;&gt; performed a T-DELETE instead.  Now, the URI returns an Etag of &quot;1&quot; and\n&gt;&gt; the T-URI is no longer mapped.  Again, this does not feel RESTful at \n&gt;&gt; all.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There are many ways to implement transactions (meaning: making several\n&gt; actions seem atomic).  Isolation is not a property of transactions -- it\n&gt; is only a property of workspaces (one implementation of transactions).\n\nAha!  You are correct.  The current description would be correct for the \nconcept of a &quot;workspace&quot;.  And from that perspective, I do think the \napproach given makes sense.\n\n&gt; For example, do you want a wire transfer\n&gt; deposit to fail just because you happen to be using your ATM card\n&gt; at the same time?\n\nSorry, I don&#39;t get the analogy.\n\n&gt; The right thing to do is tell the server\n&gt; what you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation\n&gt; according to the types of resources it is trying to protect.\n\nTrue.  If the server &quot;knew&quot; that the transaction was going to be short, \ndevoid of GETs (at least of updated resources), limited to X number of \nrequests, etc., then the server may instead choose to follow a different \napproach.\n\nHowever, in my prior post, I had a concern that simultaneous access to \nthe same resource via the same URI (where one was outside of a \ntransaction and the other was inside the transaction) didn&#39;t fit my \nunderstanding resource state.  Am I just misunderstanding it all?  For \ninstance, is it enough for a server to return  a response that includes \nsomething like the following headers for a GET request within the \ncontext of the transaction?\n\nVary: X-Transaction-URI\nX-Transaction-URI: http://example.com/t/123\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
