Once we design the back=\r\n end (service) we will be able to just any device we want to communicate wi=\r\nth our systems (IPAD,IPhone,Android,WPF,ect...)\n\nI&#39;m currently reading &quot;RES=\r\nT In Practice&quot; by Oreilly. I&#39;m sure a lot in this group have read the book.=\r\n I just finished chapter 5 &quot;Hypermedia Services&quot; which is arguably one of t=\r\nhe most important and most difficult concepts to understand with REST. I fo=\r\nund myself getting lost while reading the chapter but i kept reading hoping=\r\n by the time i got to the end everything would make sense. Well everything =\r\ndoesn&#39;t. Some concepts are still really really fuzzy. I&#39;m going to reread t=\r\nhe chapter and post questions as i start to get confused (there probably wi=\r\nll be quite a few).\n\nI know one of the first questions i had was on rel lin=\r\nk. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a genera=\r\nl documentation for how to interact with the link provider). The question i=\r\ns what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it something a person is=\r\n suppose to interact with (say to get documentation for new links added to =\r\na specific response) or something code can interact with to determine what =\r\nit needs to do? Unfortunately in the book they don&#39;t give an example of wha=\r\nt a &quot;rel&quot; page would look like. For example the link:\n&lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://r=\r\nelations.restbucks.com/payment&quot;\n      href:=3D&quot;http://restbucks.com/payment=\r\n/1234&quot; /&gt;\n\nIf you typed in &quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot; into yo=\r\nur web browser what would you see? \n\nthanks...\n\n\n"}}
