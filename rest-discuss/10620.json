You can verify this by setting up a logging\n&gt; proxy and mounting things. Which means that the OS would like to find\n&gt; DAV filesystems before SMB servers. As webdav embraces PUT, it means\n&gt; you get drag-drop putting of resources through the fairly mediocre GUI\n&gt; that is the winXP explorer shell.\n\nThat may all be true, but I&#39;m not sure how this is relevant here?\n\nBR, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
