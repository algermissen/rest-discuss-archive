Take a simple\n&gt; example of a customer resource with one or more address sub-resources.\n&gt; We can POST an address representation to the customer resource, PUT on\n&gt; the individual address resources to modify them or DELETE an address\n&gt; resource altogether.  In a particular situations, it may be important\n&gt; to later be able to say why that address was created or why was it\n&gt; modified.  For instance, you may want to find out all the customers\n&gt; that have moved 10 miles away and are still regular customers.  But if\n&gt; you did a simple PUT on the address you won&#39;t know why it was changed\n&gt; - the person might have moved or the previous address might have been\n&gt; incorrect.\n\nIf you want to capture that information, it should be part of the  \nrepresentation you send and not be part of the request meta data. It  \nis domain semantics and not protocol semantics, IMHO.\n\nI agree that it seems a bit misplaced in the payload of a PUT (though  \nif the information was part of the e.g. address itself, why not?). You  \nmight consider using PATCH and make the update comment part of your  \ndiff format or you could use POST in combination woth 303, e.g.\n\nPOST /customer/addresses\n\n&lt;addressChange&gt;\n   &lt;address&gt;...&lt;/address&gt;\n   &lt;reason&gt;....&lt;/reason&gt;\n&lt;/addressChange&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The only way I can think of to handle sending this piece of metadata\n&gt; when performing the operation is to include a custom HTTP header, like\n&gt; X-Reason or something similar that might be assigned specific codes.\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t seem like it makes sense to put it in the body of the PUT\n&gt; because it&#39;s not a part of the resource you are\n&gt; creating/changing/deleting.  Has anybody come across something like\n&gt; this in the past?\n\nThis seems very well known from revision control system updates, e.g.  \ncvs commit MyClass.cpp -m &#39;fixed bug foo&#39;\n\nMaybe WebDAV provides something of this sort already??\n\n\n&gt; Does the custom header sound like a good/bad idea?\n&gt;\n\nIMHO: NO!\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
