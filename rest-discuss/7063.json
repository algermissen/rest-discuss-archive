And please don&#39;t think it is a silly question. I&#39;ve long\n&gt; lamented the fact that desktop applications don&#39;t have a URL for their\n&gt; various states (except for File Manager which has a psuedo-URL, i.e a\n&gt; filepath). Whenever someone has told my they had a bug on my website I ask\n&gt; for the URL. But when they&#39;ve had a bug in a Windows app I wrote, what do I\n&gt; ask for? So it seems that a REST model would be appropriate for a desktop\n&gt; application, and it would also more easily facilitate moving components of\n&gt; the application to a LAN server when there is a need to scale, yes?\n\nNot a silly question at all, I think.\n\nYes, developing a Windows app on top of a RESTful architecture makes\neminent sense. It is simply a (better) version of the &quot;Smart Client&quot;\ndrive from MS that builds desktop apps on top of WS-*.\n\nA couple of extant examples:\n- Windows Live Writer fits the bill, insofar as the chosen blog API is\nRESTful (the Blogger API is nearly RESTful)\n- Outlook. Yes, everything in Outlook is actually a locally rendered\nrepresentation of a server resource using a specialized form engine.\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
