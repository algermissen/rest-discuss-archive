If the resource at a URL has\n&gt; the cache headers appropriately then servers that you do not control\n&gt; and know nothing about can intercept requests and serve responses from\n&gt; a cache rather than having to propagate every request back to the host.\n&gt;   \nSo, it seems to me the key idea of REST is scalability.  The biggest \nfactor in scalability is having resources identifiable by URIs, most of \nwhich stay stable for long enough that they can be cached.  Isolate \nanything which must change frequently into a separate URI, so it will \nhave the least impact on scalability.\n\nNow something like a shopping cart can be identified by a URI, but it \ndoesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;ll be stable for very long.  Or am I mistaken?  \nPerhaps in computer time, a few minutes is an eternity, and you can get \na lot out of caching.\n&gt; I think that many software developers have become hostage to the\n&gt; development frameworks that they utilise. In turn, many frameworks\n&gt; have made session state a fundamental building block of web\n&gt; development because it permits sloppy design. In the pursuit of\n&gt; productivity, framework providers have sought to abstract away the\n&gt; fundamental nature of HTTP and pretend that it is stateful. Why?\n&gt; Because stateless development is harder. A concrete example? These\n&gt; days I develop using the .NET Framework. If you take at ASP.NET &#39;from\n&gt; 15,000 feet&#39; then you can see that the objective of WebForms is to\n&gt; pretend that a web page can be written in the same way that a Windows\n&gt; Forms application can be written. This is simply not so. One is an\n&gt; apple, the other is an orange. No matter how you squint, they aren&#39;t\n&gt; the same. Not all of ASP.NET is evil though: HttpModules and\n&gt; HttpHandlers have allowed developers to write &#39;native HTTP&#39;\n&gt; applications again, where ASP(.OLD) did not (unless you knew how to\n&gt; write ISAPI extensions).\n&gt;   \nIs there something else you prefer to ASP.NET?  Why are you using it if \nyou don&#39;t like it?\n&gt; I think that the URL above is not RESTful because if I browse there\n&gt; then I will receive a different resource than if you browse there. A\n&gt; RESTful URL would be\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/alan.dean\n&gt;\n&gt; The provided credentials would then be used the grant or deny access\n&gt; to the resource of &quot;Alan Dean&#39;s April 2006 Bank Statements&quot;.\n&gt;   \nI see your point.\n&gt; Not necessarily. Part of the drive to federated authentication is\n&gt; prevent the need to every node to store credentials data for\n&gt; authentication purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nWhat is &quot;federated authentication&quot;?  Something sort of like Windows domains?\n&gt; No HTTP Auth is not inherently non-RESTful. It is simply a\n&gt; standardized means of propagating credentials data with a request.\n&gt; Certainly, as indicated above, you can write non-RESTful web sites\n&gt; that use HTTP Auth. Nor is HTTP Auth required for REST. It is simply\n&gt; one means of securing a resource if you choose to do so.\n&gt;   \nGot it.
