I agree with point 1. I would personally lean\n&gt; away from point 2 and 3, but that is in my programmer hat rather than my\n&gt; user hat. If 2 is a means of mass-publishing urls, that is fine. That is\n&gt; just hypermedia. If a human interprets this server-provided document as\n&gt; a form that can be filled out and enters urls into a machine, that is\n&gt; all kosher. If a human encodes the form into a computer program that\n&gt; only uses it for as long as the page says it is valid, that is all good.\n\nIt&#39;s worth noting that no part of the process except for the human \nand/or program constructing the URIs and the server application \nresponding to the need understand the principles upon which they are \nconstructed.\n\nAs far as everything else (browsers, webserver, proxies) are concerned \nthe URIs are strings conforming to certain RFCs and being comparable for \nidentity using a direct string comparison - they are opaque identifiers.\n\n\n"}}
