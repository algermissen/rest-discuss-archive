It \n&gt; would seem to go against the very nature of the web to *not* allow\n&gt; two calls to be made in parallel, regardless of how it was declared.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the example you gave, if the schema of the document that is \n&gt; POST-ed to the &quot;Bank&quot; partner required elements that would be returned \n&gt; from calls to the &quot;Seller&quot; and &quot;Shipper&quot; partners, wouldn&#39;t that be \n&gt; sufficient to, in essense, declare what the required flow would be?\n\nI didn&#39;t really understand their scenario, so can&#39;t respond to the\ndetails of it.  But I&#39;d say that any time a URI is exposed, that it&#39;s\nautomatically a valid state transition.  If it&#39;s exposed alongside\nother URIs, then all of those URIs can be followed concurrently\n(analogous to opening up a new browser window for each).  The point\nI was trying to make was that if there aren&#39;t paths through the\napplication graph which can be followed concurrently, then the URIs\nto that path should not be exposed until the predecessor paths are\ncompleted.\n\nI think some diagrams would help, but I haven&#39;t gotten to that.  Hmm,\nI guess the &quot;dot&quot; stuff I set up for the RESTwiki could help with that.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
