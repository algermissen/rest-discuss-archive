Once I was ready I&#39;d\n&gt; POST a reference to the basket to the checkout URI. Why does this need\n&gt; cookies? - it can all be done if you ensure you &#39;carry&#39; the basket URI\n&gt; around the online shop as you go.\n\nhow do you distinguish between your basket and my basket?  they&#39;re two \nseperate resources, as they should be.  now how do you know which \nbasket to target the POST at (without having it hard-coded in to the \nrepresentation of the item being bought?)?  and how do you do *that* \nwithout having a cookie to tell you who&#39;s logged in, and hence to use \n/customers/semantico/basket/ vis-a-vis /customers/vdm/basket/ ?\n\njust to be clear, while i think this reduces the RESTfulness of an app, \ni think its still better than a totally non-RESTful app, because its \nlimiting the use of cookies to a well-defined area.  same goes for auth.\n\nmaybe there&#39;s a better way, but i have yet to see it.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
