We set up a local Certificate Authority (CA) and gave both the clients and servers signed certificates and then configure the server to validate the clients certificates in addition to the default client check of the servers certificate.\n\nYes, that&#39;s just what I want David.\nDo the client and server have identical certificates? I&#39;d understood\nthat one (classically the server) had a private and public key in the keystore,\nand the client had the public key?\n\n\n\n&gt;  Problems in importing keys usually come down to one of two things: format and a confusion of the difference between a key and a certificate.  There are several formats and several quirky implementations of certificate stores, I&#39;ve always managed to find the right incantation for key format conversion via Google.\n\nI&#39;m currently using openssl to generate the certificate... holding the key :-)\nI&#39;ve selected PKCS12 as the format.\nI&#39;ve heard of, but not yet read of, and other standardised formats, nor\nthat IIS or anything else required another format. Any references please?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Keys are not the equivalent of certificates - a key is just that, a number you use to unlock the encrypted material, a certificate is a document that is signed by some authority to validate the content of the certificate.  In encryption this document contains the key and some sort of identifying information.\n\n\nKey as used in GPG, Certificate as in &#39;signed envelope&#39; round a key?\n\n\nThanks David.\n\nregards\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
