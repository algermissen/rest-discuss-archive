There&#39;s certainly nothing wrong with\n&gt; maintaining a session between user and UI, is there?  Otherwise,\n&gt; the user has to type credentials over and over, which is no good.\n\nBut the user *does* have to type credentials over and over.  Fortunately,\nthe browser is doing the work for him.  Why would a RESTful application care\nwhether the user was &quot;logged in&quot; or &quot;logged out&quot;?  All the server should\ncare about is that the user is authorized.\n\nNow, I do understand the security risk(s) here.  Until the browser is closed\nor the server sends another 401 for the same realm, that browser (or\nwhatever agent) basically has the security clearance of the user.  Since\nthere is no guarantee that the same user will be using that instance of the\nbrowser, there is the possibility for someone else to get into the system\nwith the wrong credentials.  However, I do not believe this is a problem for\nthe server to solve.  Instead, I think it&#39;s important to improve the client.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1) When a browser is sending authentication with each request, prominantly\nprovide a button on the screen labeled &quot;clear authentication&quot; (or some\nsuch).  A user can click on this at any time to force the browser to dump\nthe authentication.\n\n2) When the user leaves the authenticated page/realm, have the browser\nprompt the user as to whether the authentication information should be\ncleared or not.  This way, a user does not have to depend on #1 above or on\nclosing the browser in order to go to another website.\n\n3) Just as you would expect for gaining access to other everyday items,\nrequire the user to authenticate himself to the browser via biometrics, an\naccess card, etc.  In other words, the user-to-browser credentials should\nleave with the user and cause the browser-to-server credentials to be\ncleared immediately.\n\nAgain, I think the &quot;logout&quot;/security problem is not with the server.  We\nshould not be solving it at the server.  The weakness is with the\nbrowser/user-agent and that&#39;s where it should be fixed. imho, of course.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
