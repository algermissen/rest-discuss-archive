With a POST you can\nhave a URI with ?query as well as a body composed of name=value pairs - with\noverlapping names between the URI and body.\n\nPerhaps I&#39;m just confused whether the &#39;resource&#39; is identified ONLY by the\nuri &#39;path&#39; or if it identified by the path+query. (and in html forms you\ncan&#39;t specify whether some inputs are inserted into the uri or into the\nbody)\n\nMike &quot;margarita anyone?&quot; Dierken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
