I got some interesting\n&gt; responses to this.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s my understanding that &quot;on&quot; is a either a\nmeaningless resource or not a resource altogether.\n\n&gt; Another (RESTful?) solution could be to POST to a resource that is\n&gt; responsible for turning a lightbulb on.  For example, POST &#92;lightswitch\n&gt; sending in the light bulb and state (on/off) chosen.\n\nThis sounds better but you don&#39;t create another resource, you just\nupdate the status of the resource &quot;lightswitch&quot;.\nWhy don&#39;t you just PUT a representation of the resource lightswitch to\nupdate it?\n\n\n-- \nLawrence, oluyede.org - neropercaso.it\n&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand\nsomething when his salary depends on not\nunderstanding it&quot; - Upton Sinclair\n\n"}}
