For example, a banking=\r\n service that spits out a JSON format that simply serializes the account an=\r\nd transaction data structures used internally to represent the service&#39;s re=\r\nsources. i.e. if you aren&#39;t targeting a specific &quot;type&quot; of client by transl=\r\nating to that client&#39;s media type are you violating the constraints of REST=\r\n? \n\nI keep comming back to this statement, you really got some thoughts sta=\r\nrting. Thanks.\n\nIt also puts some light on the problems of using a framewor=\r\nk like WCF REST for a REST server: In WCF REST the default representation o=\r\nf an object is it&#39;s standard XML/JSON serialization. It is very easy to jus=\r\nt serialize your internal Data-Transfer-Objects and let that be the represe=\r\nntation. In this case you really design around your own service instead of =\r\nyour clients.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
