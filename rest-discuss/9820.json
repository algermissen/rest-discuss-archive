The existing application\nstores a bunch of information in a in-memory session object (that I\nwant to get rid of).\n\nMy understanding is I have only one option to be RESTful: store the\nstate information needed between the two steps client side (in a\ncookie?).\n\nThe same kind of transaction must be doable with a non-browser user\nagent (I&#39;m developing a Python client at the same time to test logic\nof the service).\n\nI have just read the Richardson&#39;s and Ruby&#39;s book which I find really,\nreally enlightening but I don&#39;t know how to convert this kind of logic\n(REST transactions perhaps?)\n\nCheers\n\n-- \nLawrence, oluyede.org - neropercaso.it\n&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand\nsomething when his salary depends on not\nunderstanding it&quot; - Upton Sinclair\n\n"}}
