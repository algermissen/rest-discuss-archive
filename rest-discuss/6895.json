In the case of leaves, there are\n&gt; billions of &quot;implementations&quot; and also no need to get trees to &quot;adopt&quot;\n&gt; producing them.\n\nNo, you just don&#39;t understand the terminology yet.  You asked a bunch\nof gardeners for help implementing green, or at least an easy-to-read\nguide on doing so.  If you want an implementation guide for leaves,\nthat is a different story.\n\nIf you want to know how to implement an HTTP and URI-based service\nin accordance with REST, then you should search for web architecture\nand things like Apache modular design.  There are plenty of opinions\nout there.  Most of the &quot;simple guides&quot; are just plain wrong, but\nthat&#39;s because they take the &quot;shortest path for the programmer is best&quot;\nmentality of software engineering.  Hence, CGI, servlets, etc.\nGreat for prototypes, lousy in real (scalable) practice.\n\nYes, those guides could be improved -- the W3C webarch document,\nfor example, has a number of good ideas sprinkled around a tangled\ndiscourse of a committee&#39;s long-term agenda.  That document could\nbenefit from a clean sweep driven by a single editorial viewpoint.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s as if TBL had sat around and talked about URIs, HTML, and HTTP  \n&gt; but\n&gt; whenever anyone asked him how to implement it he did his best to  \n&gt; make them\n&gt; feel as if they were beneath him for asking. Instead TBL helped them\n&gt; implement in a standard way so that it would be as universally  \n&gt; compatible as\n&gt; possible. Clearly many people before and since have used  \n&gt; condescension to\n&gt; discuss their ideas but I dare say nobody else in history has seen  \n&gt; the level\n&gt; of success TLB saw based on their ideas, at least not as rapidly. I  \n&gt; see\n&gt; people on this list lament how the industry has taken to SOAP and  \n&gt; not REST\n&gt; and the backhanded jabs at those who use SOAP, but it&#39;s becoming  \n&gt; pretty\n&gt; clear to me at least one good reason why REST has remained still- \n&gt; borne and\n&gt; SOAP has reined supreme.\n\nHuh?  Please, find a clue.  TBL stopped implementing URI, HTML, and\nHTTP back in 1993.  Yes, 1993.  Since then he has spent an enormous\namount of time creating an organization that can, essentially, talk\nabout them, with the hopes of doing something more in the form of\nthe semantic web at some point in the future.\n\nBut perhaps you are right -- maybe I should have shown people how to\ncreate an architecture based on REST, instead of just talking about it.\nUsually, creating a network-based architecture means protocol design,\nlike in RFCs 1808, 1866, 1945, 2068, 2145, 2396, 2616, and 3986.\nMaybe I should have written an extensible client library that could\nshow people how to manipulate the Web programmatically without assuming\na human is at the wheel; like, maybe, libwww-perl and MOMspider.\nMaybe I should have spent more time teaching people how to build\nservice frameworks for scalable (real) Web sites, like Apache httpd.\n\nMaybe I did, and you still have no clue what you are talking about.\nREST is still-born?  Get a life.  You haven&#39;t even figured out what\nthe Web is yet and you want to lecture me on teaching.\n\nNobody on this list laments about SOAP.  SOAP was known to be a bad\nidea in 1999 and, in spite of our comments to that effect, the industry\nstill insisted on proving that for themselves.  That was expected\ngiven the money behind SOAP and is still an ongoing process, but we\ndon&#39;t need to lament it because this list is for discussing REST.\n\n&gt; Tell you what; my venting isn&#39;t going to change your or anyone else&#39;s\n&gt; approach on this list. I&#39;ll still participate to try and learn  \n&gt; more, but I\n&gt; give up on trying to inject any practicality into the discussions.\n\nAll you have injected so far is whining.  If you want a different\napproach, first figure out what people are talking about and then\ntry a new approach yourself.  I don&#39;t understand why you are venting,\nbecause everything we have done so far has succeeded pretty well.\nREST is catching on just fine, without a dime spent on marketing.\nI don&#39;t measure success by the number of people who attend training\ncourses because their boss told them to.  If you want to measure\nsuccess that way, then that&#39;s your problem.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
