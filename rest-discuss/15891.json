Sure, you can whip up an XML language, give it a\nschema, and assign it a media type identifier.  But that doesn&#39;t make\nit a media type, certainly not one that&#39;s of use for driving a REST\nsystem.  What does application/x-cargo+xml tell me that&#39;s any different\nfrom what application/xml tells me?\n\nIs there some definition (and no, XSD doesn&#39;t begin to cut it) of how\nto render and interact with such a document?  If your cargo manifest is\nHTML tables and lists, then block-level vs. inline elements are clearly\nunderstood by anyone looking at your HTTP headers.  Anyone looking at\nthe HTTP headers sees by the media type, how linking is handled -- this\nparticular out-of-band knowledge, is common knowledge.\n\nIf, to make these determinations, I have to look beyond your media type\nidentifier to some other resource to determine what a link is, and\nthere&#39;s nothing to refer to anywhere telling me which elements are\nblock and which are inline, then you&#39;ve missed the point of REST\nentirely -- your out-of-band knowledge isn&#39;t common knowledge, it&#39;s\nproprietary to your system.\n\n(Your system may not have the concerns of laying out the document, but\nstill, your &quot;media type&quot; doesn&#39;t really tell me anything about what\nmethods to use.  An HTML media type tells me lots about how to interact\nusing GET, POST and urlencoded queries before I&#39;ve even looked at the\nmessage body -- this is self-descriptiveness.  The application/xml\nmedia type tells me nothing of the sort, neither does any *+xml type\nthat is functionally no different from application/xml.)\n\nBut, the majority crowd who equate HTTP with REST, will be satisfied to\ncall what you propose RESTful.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
