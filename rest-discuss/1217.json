The current directory is set with previous FTP commands.  \n&gt; So the interpretation of a message depends on previous messages.  \n&gt; That&#39;s stateful.\n\nWould you have any objection to a resource representing a state?\nOr having a state as a property?\n\nLots of interactions are inherently stateful.\nAs in conversations or sessions.  \nBusiness exchanges are usually that way.\nThe interpretation of a message will depend on previous messages.\n\nBut I think the state of a business exchange is actually the state of \na particular business entity, e.g. an Order.  So it can be \nrepresented as the state of an Order resource.\n\nFor example, maybe you can&#39;t change an Order that is in \nthe &quot;fulfilled&quot; state.\nOr for another example, if you want to change an airline ticket that \nis in the &quot;booked&quot; state, it will cost you $75.\n\nThis also refers back to previous messages in this forum about \nresource state maybe being the key to a cleaner &quot;session state&quot; model.\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1037\n\n\n\n"}}
