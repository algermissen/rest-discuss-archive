It seems that an=\r\ny XML identifier is problematic to algorithmically map to a URI.\n\nMy scenar=\r\nio: I have an Artist List structure containing Artist structures with a Nam=\r\ne and an uri reference, ie &lt;ArtistList&gt;&lt;Artist&gt;&lt;Name&gt;Thievery Corp&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;U=\r\nRI&gt;http://www.eslmusic.com/artists/thievery.html&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Artist&gt;&lt;/ArtistList=\r\n&gt;\n\nI want to support getting the entire Artist information, or just a singl=\r\ne field.  We earlier said that making the Artist identifier hierarchical is=\r\n a Good Thing.  This would look like:\n\nGET /ArtistList/Artist/id/xyz.\n\nBut =\r\nin my xml data structure, I specified that the Name structure uniquely iden=\r\ntifies the band in my database.  I end up having 2 primary keys: one if I u=\r\nse URIs, and another if I were to do an XML based query.  If I used the Nam=\r\ne as the key, the URI looks more like\n\n./Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp\n\nIf I =\r\nthen want to get the value of the URI field where the Artist=3DThievery Cor=\r\np, my query might look something like:\n\nGET /ArtistList/Artist/Name/Thiever=\r\ny%20Corp/URI\nor\nGET /ArtistList/Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp?field=3DURI\n\nI =\r\nprefer the former because the URI field is hierarchical within the Artist s=\r\ntructure, it&#39;s just that the darned Name messes up the hierarchy.  I don&#39;t =\r\nwant to use client side identifiers, ie fragment ids such as Artist#Thiever=\r\nyCorp or even Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp#thievery%20CorpURI\n\nSo I then tho=\r\nught in cases where the field being requested was at the same or lower leve=\r\nl than the identifier, I could use the path component to specify the Artist=\r\n, as in\n\nGET /ArtistList/Artist;Name=3DThievery%20Corp/URI\n\nWhich I&#39;d inter=\r\npret as for the Artist who&#39;s name field is thievery corp, get the URI field=\r\n.  I wonder if this is a good way of modelling the query?\n\nI think you shou=\r\nld now have the rough gist of the way that I&#39;m thinking about binding xml s=\r\ntructures to URIs, and this has led to some questions:\n\n1. What is the best=\r\n design, or even the trade-offs to be made across designs, when binding xml=\r\n identifiers to URIs\n\n2. How should requests for a &quot;secondary resource&quot; in =\r\na component be expressed when the secondary resource is at the same level i=\r\nn the xml hierarchy as the xml identifier.\n\nI wasn&#39;t quite sure which way R=\r\noy was saying is the best way given the different examples of http://exampl=\r\ne.com/quotes/${exchange}/${symbol} and  /Artist/id/12345678.   That is, whe=\r\nther the URI for the resource is parameterizable and thus generated by a cl=\r\nient, or whether the identifier is opaque and the client has to do a 2nd pa=\r\nss to get it.  It seems like there&#39;s an important point about naming of res=\r\nources, which is that maybe the xml way of identifying resources doesn&#39;t wo=\r\nrk well with the Web.\n\nThanks again for all your time,\nDave\n\n\n"}}
