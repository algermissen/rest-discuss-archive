For those of you aware\nof Sam Ruby&#39;s Mombo, my program will work in a similar way.  Now, here&#39;s the\nissue...\n\nWhen a request is made for a file that does not yet physically exist,\nmod_rewrite is used to redirect the request through a CGI script.  The\nscript then generates the file and stores it.  Now, what I need to do is\nalso return the contents of the file back to the user.  But!  I do not want\nto deal with all of the headers that Apache would normally return were the\nfile already in place.  So here is my thought:  once the file has been\ncreated, return a 301 (Moved Permanently) response back to the same exact\nrequest URL.  The browser then re-GETs the file and Apache handles the\nrequest without any CGI intervention the second time around.  (All other\nrequests get handled by Apache the first time around.)\n\nAll of you have probably noticed the potential for the good ol&#39; &quot;infinite\nloop&quot; problem, but interestingly, both IE and Mozilla allow such a\nredirection back to the URL that just got the 301 response (and I am\nguessing the other 30x responses do the same).  So, technically this seems\nto work.  However, does anyone see anything &quot;bad&quot; about this approach?  It\nseems to be very simple, clean, and effective, but I thought I would ask...\njust in case...\n\n---\nSeairth (seairth@...)\nLooking: http://www.seairth.com/blog/65\n\n\n"}}
