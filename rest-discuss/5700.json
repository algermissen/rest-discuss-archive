What if someone wants to do an XSLT transform on the P3P\n&gt; policy - shouldn&#39;t it have its own URL.\n\nSure... but content neg can handle that as well.

It&#39;s the metadata querying that content neg is\ngood for.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; As for the favicon,  I never understood why that wasn&#39;t an HTML LINK\n&gt;&gt; type.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is also an HTML LINK, with /favicon.ico as a fallback. I imagine\n&gt; that they thought people wouldn&#39;t want to change every single page on\n&gt; their site.\n\nHmmm... that is a good point. But it&#39;s not done for CSS files (where\nit would be similarly useful) so I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s necessary for\nfavicon personally.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
