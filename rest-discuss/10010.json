The two scenarios that I\nthink are important to describe is:\n1) A machine client that can automate interaction with multiple REST\nservices that support a shared hypermedia schema\n2) The same client continuing to work against a REST service that is\n&quot;evovled&quot; with new functionality.\n\nJohn\n\nOn Dec 14, 2007 7:33 PM, Assaf Arkin &lt;assaf@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On 12/12/07, John D. Heintz &lt;jheintz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please help me explain this stuff better, or just correct what I&#39;ve written.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my blog I called [1] JJ Dubray out for claiming that REST &quot;cannot\n&gt; &gt; efficiently deal with the state changes (content and lifecycle) of a\n&gt; &gt; resource&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In later comments and further posting by JJ the real issue is:\n&gt; &gt;  &quot;what must be shared between a provider and consumer&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So once again, like clock-work my e-mail client decided to reply but\n&gt; not to the list, and I ended up in a private conversation about this\n&gt; with John.  Too long to summarize the entire thread, but here&#39;s the\n&gt; gist of the point I&#39;m trying to make.\n&gt;\n&gt; We know the stuff JJD is talking about works for SOAP with various\n&gt; levels of success, call if 1st generation Web services if you will,\n&gt; now how do we move forward and apply it to REST?  And I&#39;m talking\n&gt; about REST with benefits, not RPC over HTTP, so obviously things will\n&gt; translate differently, you&#39;ll end up designing processes in a\n&gt; different way to take advantage of REST characteristics.  But what\n&gt; would it look like?\n&gt;\n&gt; The key problem here is composition.\n&gt;\n&gt; The simplest use case I could come up with is this.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have a workflow and a task manager.  The workflow pushes tasks to\n&gt; the task manager, people use the task manager to manage and perform\n&gt; these tasks, and the outcomes are fed back to the workflow.\n&gt;\n&gt; The task manager is a resource, so is every task created there, so you\n&gt; can imagine using POST to create tasks, PUT to update them, ETags for\n&gt; caching and conflict resolution, and all other good things.\n&gt;\n&gt; The workflow also has a resource, an outcome, that the task manager\n&gt; updates when the task completes, or deletes if the task is cancelled.\n&gt;\n&gt; So they&#39;re acting as P2P, and I&#39;m picking this as a typical scenario\n&gt; indicative of more complex composition problems we&#39;re seeing out\n&gt; there, but simple enough to wrap my head around it.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have two teams.  Team red is working on the workflow, which does a\n&gt; lot of other things, not interesting for this discussion.  Team blue\n&gt; is working on the task manager.  We&#39;re digging a tunnel from both\n&gt; sides planning to meet in the middle and open it up for traffic.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the minimum shared understanding that both teams need to make\n&gt; it happen?\n&gt;\n&gt; If I&#39;m using tools to help with the design, build test case scenarios,\n&gt; change management in future versions, what artifacts would I need?\n&gt;\n&gt; And what would make the end result compelling over WS-* and beneficial\n&gt; in its usage of REST?\n&gt;\n&gt; Assaf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nJohn D.
