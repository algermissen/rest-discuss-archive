In a state transition \n&gt; &gt; diagram, that would be fairly easy to describe the desired \n&gt; behavior. \n&gt; &gt; In an &#39;action\n&gt; \n&gt; can you please elaborate? \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; oriented&#39; approach, you&#39;d have to special case that to prevent \n&gt; &gt; multiple initializations/etc.\n\nSorry I wasn&#39;t clear.\nI pictured an implementation of &#39;start&#39; that blindly allocated resources,\nstarted processes, etc. \nIf a &#39;start&#39; message were sent twice, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this\nresource allocation and process startup code tried to run a second time.\nAlthough it would be easy to guard against this, if the meaning of the API\nwas &quot;execute that code&quot;, it seems odd that the server would refuse to do\nwhat it advertised as it&#39;s job.\nWith a state transfer, setting the state of a resource to the same value\ntwice is easy to describe and easy to accept multiple redundant messages and\nhonor the externally visible interface.\n\n\n\n"}}
