Are you saying that the server could return *anything*, like for instan=\r\nce the representation of a car or an address book? Or are you allowing the =\r\nclient to assume it is a sales order - without any assumption of the actual=\r\n format it is represented in?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ha, Jorn! You are right on.\n&gt; \n&gt; So,=\r\n I would say, it is fair to argue that:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The client follows a link-r=\r\nel &quot;this-is-the-sales-order&quot; and assumes it will get, well, a sales order -=\r\n in some yet unknown format.\n\nYes\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The client does not need to spec=\r\nify &quot;I want a sales order&quot; in the accept headers (it does so by the URL it =\r\nhas selected). \n\nWell - the user agent has capabilities and some next stuff=\r\n to do (reflecting the intent of the user; e.g. display the content of a fe=\r\ned or embed an image into the currently rendered page or check the price of=\r\n an article in a catalog). The piece of code that does this relies on some =\r\nformat (e.g. an Atom feed document or some catalog document). This has to g=\r\no into the Accept header: &quot;I can do what I am up to, if you send me foo/bar=\r\n&quot;. (And I *cannot* do what I am up to if you send me anything else)\n\n&gt; 3) T=\r\nhe client should specify what general domain-independent format it expects =\r\nusing accept headers. For instance &quot;Accept: application/xml&quot;.\n\nNo! Because =\r\nAccept: application/xml means &quot;I can do what I want to do if you send me an=\r\nything that an XML parser will process&quot;. How can capability negotiation hap=\r\npen correctly if you say: give me any angle brackets? \n\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The server =\r\nreplies with a sales order formated as application/xml.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) The client =\r\nlooks into the XML and switches on something relevant in the XML - for inst=\r\nance the root namespace.\n\nAnd if it cannot handle that XML? You tunneled ap=\r\nplication semantics over HTTP, using HTTP as transport, not transfer. Leadi=\r\nng to a 200 instead of 406 at the protocol level. tricking caches into trea=\r\nting it as a good response . Etc.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) Based on the XML decision in (5)=\r\n the client decides how to decode the XML-formated sales order.\n&gt; \n&gt; All in=\r\n all there is no need for a domain specific media type like application/vnd=\r\n.salesorder+xml.\n\nThen, please, tell me why we have text/html, application/=\r\natom+xml, application/vcard+xml, application/calendar+xml, etc. in the firs=\r\nt place? Is that all unnecessary, wasted effort? Could the same be achieved=\r\n by just saying application/xml?\n\nBTW, tell me whether &lt;html/&gt; is text/html=\r\n or application/xslt+xml - you can&#39;t.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Combine this with statements li=\r\nke &quot;REST is software design on the scale of decades&quot; and &quot;Many of the const=\r\nraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would say tha=\r\nt domain specific media types are short term solutions - a thing like the s=\r\nales order varies on the market/geographical region/politics and ... time, =\r\nmeaning it probably won&#39;t be stable over the decades.\n&gt; \n&gt; Further more - i=\r\nt may feel like bending over and backwards not to use domain specific media=\r\n types. But, well &quot;Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-te=\r\nrm efficiency&quot;, so, yes, it hurts now, but you will be a happy camper in te=\r\nn years :-)\n&gt; \n\nSorry, but this is again pretending there is a problem that=\r\n needs to be solved - but there isn&#39;t.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
