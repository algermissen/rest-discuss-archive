HEAD,\nOPTIONS nice, too).\n- for GET requests, I want to know what media type is preferred\n(combination of looking at Accept header and/or file extension, etc.)\n- for PUT/POST I want to be able to quickly and easily now the\nincoming Content-type\n- an easy way to parse the requested URL (w/ regex or named sections, etc.)\n- the ability to dispatch to a handler function by any combination of the above\n- tools for creating representations in the most common media types:\nHTML (a template language), JSON, Atom, RDF, etc. and serving the\nproper one based on requested type.\n\n"}}
