Costello&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; My colleague responded saying that many (if not most) Web applications\n&gt; today use this paradigm of funneling all requests though a single URL.\n&gt; For example, with CGI applications there is only one URL.  The CGI code\n&gt; delegates the request to the appropriate application.  Likewise, Cold\n&gt; Fusion applications all funnel to the same URL.  He said, &quot;go to amazon,\n&gt; you will see that all URLs funnel through obidos&quot; (I checked, he&#39;s\n&gt; correct).\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0136168221/104-7936033-9823945\n\n&quot;obidos&quot; is an implementation detail. What does it matter to a client\napplication that maybe somewhere in the URI is a trigger that launches a\nCGI or J2EE servlet or whatever?\n\nThe difference with SOAP is that a typical SOAP service would *stop* at\nobdios:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/\n\nAnd then you would specify the rest of the information in SOAP elements\nlike &lt;ISBN&gt;.\n\nThis means that &quot;obdios&quot; goes from being a trick the server uses to keep\ntrack of how to dispatch URIs to something the *client* of the service\nneeds to care about. Now the *client* needs to know to send the ISBN as\nan element. This means that there is no compact syntax (like a URI) for\nthe resource identified. You have to say something like:\n\n&quot;Go to http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/and send a message that looks\nlike this:\n\n&lt;ISBN&gt;0136168221/104-7936033-9823945&lt;/ISBN&gt;&quot;\n\nYou see the difference? With REST I can send someone to the particular\nbook with a single declarative, globally understood statement. With SOAP\nI can only *describe* how to *configure* a SOAP client to send the right\nmessage to get at the information. One is an address. The other is a\nlist of instructions of how to get to a place.\n\n&gt; Three (very naive) questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Are his statements about CGI and Cold Fusion correct?\n\nNo, Amazon is a wonderful example of CGI used right.\n\n&gt; 2. Is it true that the majority of the Web is non-RESTful?\n\nThere is a lot of the Web that violates REST design criteria in one way\nor another. Amazon&#39;s book URIs are not a good example but it would not\ntake long to find some. That is only an indictment of REST if there is a\ngood reason those people did things in a non-RESTful way. i.e. if REST\ndidn&#39;t solve their problems. If it is just the case that they didn&#39;t\n*know* how to use REST right then REST is in the same position as OO\nprogramming when C++ was just beginning to become popular. People used\nOO constructs as structs with methods for years before the paradigm\nstarted to seep in. With no REST books, it is actually amazing how\nRESTful average Web sites are! People rediscovered and reinvented REST\nbefore it was named or documented!\n\nThere is also a lot of the Web that uses REST beautifully.\n\n&gt; 3. Should we (the REST evangelists) be arguing against CGI, Cold Fusion,\n&gt; as well as SOAP?\n\nCGI and cold fusion are implementation techniques. SOAP is a protocol.\nCGI and Cold Fusion can be used to present *any* interface to the client\nyou want. SOAP *defines* the syntax of the messages that the client and\nserver must send. In other words, CGI and Cold Fusion are the languages\nyou speak at home with your kids -- none of my business. SOAP is the\nlanguage you demand I speak in order to communicate with you. That makes\nit my business.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
