Doesn&#39;t change the point, which is\nthat for eight years (and counting, I&#39;m sure there are still legacy\nimplementations) both RFC 2068 and RFC 2616 were official, overlapping\ndefinitions of HTTP. I&#39;m sure if I looked I could find other examples,\nbut I think the onus is on those who claim RFC 2068 became deprecated\nin 1999, to prove that the WebDAV case is some sort of aberration in\nterms of major IETF standards.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A resource can be anything, an IR is limited to documents which may\n&gt; &gt; be dereferenced using HTTP. A person can&#39;t be identified by the\n&gt; &gt; same URI that identifies a document about that person. The person\n&gt; &gt; is a resource, the document is an IR, using the same URI for both\n&gt; &gt; is a collision because they are not the same resource.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My interpretation of httpRange-14, is that if the URI identifies a\n&gt; &gt; person then it MUST NOT return 200 OK, at all, ever. I do not take\n&gt; &gt; this to mean that if a URI identifies a document it MUST NOT return\n&gt; &gt; 303, at all, ever.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that interpretation is not correct. For 200, you simply don&#39;t\n&gt; know.\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re right, but only in the case of hash URIs.  I forgot about that,\ntoo.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; 303 and 404 representations of a requested URI\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; indicate the value of _some other resource_.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Now you&#39;re confusing me, how can a return code be considered a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; representation? It&#39;s teh result of dereferencing, it&#39;s not a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; representation of anything.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re looking at a 503 response page, you&#39;re looking at a\n&gt; &gt; representation of the dereferenced resource. The response code, is\n&gt; &gt; part of the representation. Quoting REST again:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;REST components perform actions on a resource by using a\n&gt; &gt; representation to capture the current or intended state of that\n&gt; &gt; resource and transferring that representation between components. A\n&gt; &gt; representation is a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata\n&gt; &gt; to describe those bytes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A 503 response, is a representation of the state of the dereferenced\n&gt; &gt; resource, i.e. &quot;busy - check back later&quot;. The sequence of bytes\n&gt; &gt; returned in response to the request, is defined as a representation\n&gt; &gt; of the requested resource. The set of temporally varying\n&gt; &gt; representations of the requested resource, temporarily includes a\n&gt; &gt; 503 response in such a case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not convinced.\n&gt; \n&gt; A 503 response is not a representation of the resource you asked for.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may be (as Roy just pointed out on the http mailing list) a \n&gt; representation of an error resource, but that&#39;s it.\n&gt; \n\nLet me re-write my last message a bit, then:  &quot;If you&#39;re looking at a\n503 response page, you&#39;re looking at a representation of some other\nresource...  A 503 response, is a representation of the &#39;busy - check\nback back later&#39; resource.  The sequence of bytes returned in\nresponse to the request, is defined as a representation of the 503\nresource. The 503 response status code indicates the state of the\nrequested resource, i.e. &#39;busy - check back later&#39;.  The client may\nserve a cached representation of the requested resource, even if stale.&quot;\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
