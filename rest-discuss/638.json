As part of the\n&gt; request the sink resubscribes.  (A combined operation will be hard to model in\n&gt; HTTP, but this message is not the place to articulate the problems.)\n\nCan you expand on this?  IMO, it seems trivial to me --- the sink merely requests\nnotification and indicates the sink resource in-band with the GET of the new state,\nala WD-Proxy.\n\n&gt; 4) If the resub in the request fails, the server returns a status code to say\n&gt; so.  So there&#39;s no possibility of losing ticks.\n\nThis may be a bit trickier --- you want to return both the appropriate response to\nthe GET *and* information relating to the notification commitment or lack thereof.\nBut again, IMO, WD-Proxy provides a reasonable starting point.\n\n\n&gt; I think there is a failure to communicate here.  I believe that you are thinking\n&gt; that first the source reports an event; later another event happens that the\n&gt; server needs to report; but there is not a subscription at that moment because\n&gt; the subscription expired after the first notification.  However that situation\n&gt; cannot arise in the idempotent notification model.  INM notifications are all\n&gt; identical.  There is no difference in the semantic content of the first and Nth\n&gt; notifications.  A subscription _does_ expire after the notification is received\n&gt; by the sink, but it doesn&#39;t matter, because all of the content that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; cause notifications to be fired gets picked up anyway when the sink requests the\n&gt; new state.\n\nThis is exactly right.  It&#39;s also the primary difference between the pure\nnotification model and the update model.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
