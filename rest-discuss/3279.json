This\n&gt; &gt; resource creation often requires authentication. HTTP authentication,\n&gt; &gt; which is challenge-response, conflicts with this; if the user POSTs a\n&gt; &gt; relatively large resource entity and the server challenges, the\n&gt; &gt; entity is lost. What to do in this scenario? How are others solving\n&gt; &gt; this problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Lost? Only if the client discards it before reposting with \n&gt; authentication.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it&#39;s a problem keeping a large POST entity around during the \n&gt; challenge-response you could investigate 100 Continue (see RFC 2616 \n&gt; 8.2.3). The client can add an Accept: 100-continue request header and \n&gt; pause before generating and sending the request entity. If the POST is \n&gt; authenticated (or no auth is required) the server will respond with a \n&gt; 100 Continue response and the client can proceed with the request \n&gt; entity. OTOH if auth is required the server will respond with a 401 \n&gt; Unauthorized and client can terminate the request without ever \n&gt; generating or sending the request entity.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that server support for 100 Continue is fairly good. \n&gt; Unfortunately client support is pretty patchy (I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not \n&gt; supported by the standard Java HTTP client) but clients with support do \n&gt; exist. Not sure what the situation is with proxies tho&#39;.\n\nI had hope--100 Continue seemed like an elegant solution--but I don&#39;t\nthink it can be used here. Really, the only valid responses of\n&#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39; is &#39;417 Expectation Failed&#39; and &#39;100 Continue&#39;.\nIt can&#39;t be used for preauthentication.\n\n- itdp\n\n\n"}}
