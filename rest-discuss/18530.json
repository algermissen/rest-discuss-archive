Both you and Ben seem=\r\n to be saying the same thing.. some sort of job queue resource. I probably =\r\nshould have added that all of our API calls other than GETs are async.

You can use these=\r\n idempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodies to th=\r\ne server for processing of all kinds including comparing the data against d=\r\nata on the server, logging for later use, etc.\n\nI often &quot;model&quot; actions suc=\r\nh as &quot;login&quot;, &quot;ticket request&quot;, &quot;queue up a job&quot;, etc. as a &quot;write-record&quot; =\r\npattern. IOW, if you attempt to log into the server, I might log the action=\r\n (date, time, username, other context data) for later audit review. When I =\r\ndo this, it makes good sense to use a POST w/ body to send the data. These =\r\nactions often result in a new &quot;resource&quot; which hold the results of the atte=\r\nmpt (&quot;here&#39;s your ticket&quot;, &quot;you job has been added to the queue&quot;, etc.) and=\r\n sometimes this resource will be updated/refreshed over the life of the job=\r\n, etc.\n\nI think that would fit your scenario just fine. you need not save a=\r\nll the data sent by the user (i.e. password, etc.)\n\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.co=\r\nm/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue,=\r\n Feb 7, 2012 at 14:47, Kevin Duffey &lt;andjarnic@...&lt;mailto:andjarnic@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI am trying to do the best I can for our API n=\r\needs to avoid making some REST calls basically be RPC calls. I can&#39;t explai=\r\nn in detail regarding the company I work for as we&#39;re still in stealth/star=\r\ntup mode so I&#39;ll do the best I can to make sense.\n\nOur API uses HtmlUnit (J=\r\nava) to &quot;scrape&quot; some web sites. Basically we pull down a sites login page,=\r\n try some credentials that the consumer passed to us, and attempt to log a =\r\nuser in. It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not trying to randomly log in t=\r\no sites and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will ask their end u=\r\nsers for credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we&#39;ll attempt to=\r\n validate the credentials are good, sending back a response to the consumer=\r\n that they are good or not. However, as far as I can tell this does not mod=\r\nify a resource, or create a new resource on our server side. It&#39;s basically=\r\n a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating user credentia=\r\nls for different services. The consumer gets the benefit of being able to a=\r\nvoid having to do the page scraping and/or using other service APIs..they j=\r\nust use our one API and specify the service and pass the credentials.\n\nThe =\r\nproblem is.. we cant use GET since you can&#39;t pass a body. I thought of quer=\r\ny params for the creds, but that seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the logica=\r\nl method to use, passing in credentials (possibly other values too) in the =\r\nbody. Only, as I said above, we&#39;re not storing these values, changing any d=\r\nata on our API server side.. we&#39;re merely checking to see if what was sent =\r\nto our API works at the service selected (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I=\r\n guess you could say the boolean flag of whether or not the creds worked ch=\r\nanges..but that&#39;s not really the resource.\n\nSo I am asking you experts.. ho=\r\nw is something like this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve re=\r\nad the past few years, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into =\r\nREST. Essentially if the community was &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax with=\r\n the ease of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of=\r\n the community balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms=\r\n, I am left to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST.\n\nFee=\r\nl free to slap me around a bit if I am completely missing some key points a=\r\nbout using REST. I think I have a pretty good understanding of it, but no d=\r\noubt there is room to learn.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--_000_3DDD0BE655869D4EA506652B3803AEF6C3525820PRISMcaffeineit_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text=\r\n/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n&lt;!--\n.ygrp-photo-ti=\r\ntle\n\t{clear:both;\n\tfont-size:smaller;\n\theight:15px;\n\toverflow:hidden;\n\ttext=\r\n-align:center;\n\twidth:75px}\ndiv.ygrp-photo\n\t{background-color:white;\n\tborde=\r\nr:1px solid black;\n\theight:62px;\n\twidth:62px}\ndiv.photo-title a, div.photo-=\r\ntitle a:active, div.photo-title a:hover, div.photo-title a:visited\n\t{text-d=\r\necoration:none}\ndiv.attach-table div.attach-row\n\t{clear:both}\ndiv.attach-ta=\r\nble div.attach-row div\n\t{float:left}\np\n\t{clear:both;\n\tpadding:15px 0 3px 0;=\r\n\n\toverflow:hidden}\ndiv.ygrp-file\n\t{width:30px}\ndiv.attach-table div.attach-=\r\nrow div div a\n\t{text-decoration:none}\ndiv.attach-table div.attach-row div d=\r\niv span\n\t{font-weight:normal}\ndiv.ygrp-file-title\n\t{font-weight:bold}\n--&gt;\n&lt;=\r\n/style&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot; id=3D&quot;owaParaStyle&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body =\r\nfpstyle=3D&quot;1&quot; ocsi=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;=\r\ncolor: #000000;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Quick two points on=\r\n this:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;ID is already part=\r\n of the application protocl, its&#39; the URI.

You can use =\r\nthese idempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodies\n=\r\n to the server for processing of all kinds including comparing the data aga=\r\ninst data on the server, logging for later use, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;I often &quot;model&quot; actions such as=\r\n &quot;login&quot;, &quot;ticket request&quot;, &quot;queue up a job&quot;,=\r\n etc. as a &quot;write-record&quot; pattern. IOW, if you attempt to log int=\r\no the server, I might log the action (date, time, username, other context\n =\r\ndata) for later audit review. When I do this, it makes good sense to use a =\r\nPOST w/ body to send the data. These actions often result in a new &quot;re=\r\nsource&quot; which hold the results of the attempt (&quot;here&#39;s your ticke=\r\nt&quot;, &quot;you job has been added to the queue&quot;, etc.)\n and someti=\r\nmes this resource will be updated/refreshed over the life of the job, etc.&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;I think that would f=\r\nit your scenario just fine. you need not save all the data sent by the user=\r\n (i.e. password, etc.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sa=\r\nns-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;\nmca&lt;br&gt;\nhttp://amundse=\r\nn.com/blog/&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com&lt;/a&gt;@mamund&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv652993450gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Fe=\r\nb 7, 2012 at 14:47, Kevin Duffey &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:andjarnic@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;andjarnic@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yiv652993450gmail_quote&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex; border-left:1px #ccc solid; padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt; font-family:times new roman,new y=\r\nork,times,serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Hi all,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I am trying to d=\r\no the best I can for our API needs to avoid making some REST calls basicall=\r\ny be RPC calls. I can&#39;t explain in detail regarding the company I work for =\r\nas we&#39;re still in stealth/startup mode so I&#39;ll do the best I can to make se=\r\nnse.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Our API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to &quot;scra=\r\npe&quot; some web sites. Basically we pull down a sites login page, try som=\r\ne credentials that the consumer passed to us, and attempt to log a user in.=\r\n It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not trying to randomly log in to sites\n=\r\n and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will ask their end users fo=\r\nr credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we&#39;ll attempt to valida=\r\nte the credentials are good, sending back a response to the consumer that t=\r\nhey are good or not. However, as\n far as I can tell this does not modify a =\r\nresource, or create a new resource on our server side. It&#39;s basically a pro=\r\nxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating user credentials for=\r\n different services. The consumer gets the benefit of being able\n to avoid =\r\nhaving to do the page scraping and/or using other service APIs..they just u=\r\nse our one API and specify the service and pass the credentials.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The problem is.. we cant use GET since you can&#39;t pa=\r\nss a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but that seems hacky to=\r\n me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in credentials (possib=\r\nly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above,\n we&#39;re not storing=\r\n these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we&#39;re merely chec=\r\nking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service selected (lets=\r\n say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag of wheth=\r\ner or not the\n creds worked changes..but that&#39;s not really the resource.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;So I am asking you experts.. how is something lik=\r\ne this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve read the past few ye=\r\nars, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially =\r\nif the community was &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax\n with the ea=\r\nse of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the co=\r\nmmunity balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am =\r\nleft to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Feel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely=\r\n missing some key points about using REST. I think I have a pretty good und=\r\nerstanding of it, but no doubt there is room to learn.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=\r\n=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16,16,255); margin-left:5px; margin-top:5px; =\r\npadding-left:5px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times=\r\n,serif; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;color:white; clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color:white; clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--_000_3DDD0BE655869D4EA506652B3803AEF6C3525820PRISMcaffeineit_--\r\n\n"}}
