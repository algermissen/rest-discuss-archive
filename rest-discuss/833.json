There is more consistency than you may think.\nThere is both commercial law and a body of common\npractices that differ somewhat by region and\nindustry, but have some common elements everywhere.\n\n2. For electronic commerce, there have been years\nof work on standardization.  I know, standards are\nso nice because there are so many of them.\n\nBut all of the initiatives below are related, as a family of \nstandards where each used and built upon the predecessor:\n\n\n* UNIFORM RULES OF CONDUCT FOR INTERCHANGE OF TRADE DATA BY \nTELETRANSMISSION (UNCID),\nhttp://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/texts/d220_d.htm \n* UN/ECE RECOMMENDATION No.26, THE COMMERCIAL USE OF INTERCHANGE \nAGREEMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE, \nhttp://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/texts/d240_d.htm\n* The Commercial use of Electronic Data Interchange, Section of \nBusiness Law American Bar Association, A report and model trading \npartner agreement,\nhttp://www.abanet.org/buslaw/catalog/5070258.html \n* ISO Open-EDI\nhttp://www.jtc1sc32.org/\nhttp://www.rosettanet.org/\nhttp://www.ebxml.org/\nhttp:/www.ebtwg.org/\n\nI&#39;m not suggested you read all of the above.\nBut here is a concrete example-in-progress:\nhttp://lists.ebtwg.org/archives/ebtwg-bcp/200202/msg00020.html\n\nThat example is supposed to be technology-neutral, but there are a \nlot of P2P EDI assumptions in the group.  My purpose for hanging out \non this list is to figure out what it would mean to RESTify some of \nthis body of work.\n\nHave fun,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
