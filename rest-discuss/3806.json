[...]\n\nIt sounds like by &quot;model&quot; you&#39;re referring to =\r\na primary\nrepresentation for the resource, like the Wiki-text\nrepresentatio=\r\nn as opposed to the HTML rendering of a Wiki topic.\nThis jibes with the dis=\r\ncomfort I expressed about treating the\nHTML rendering as another representa=\r\ntion of the same resource.\n\nA couple of points come to mind:\n\n1. Content ne=\r\ngotiation is confusing, and multiple representations\n   just aren&#39;t used ve=\r\nry often.\n\n2. For PUT to be meaningful, the browser must GET the primary\n  =\r\n representation anyway, for the user to edit.\n\nWe&#39;re still talking about tr=\r\nansferring representations of\nresources, but expressing a preference for a =\r\nsingle\nrepresentation for each resource, with stylesheets or scripts for\nre=\r\nndering.\n\nThe HTML4 spec describes an HTTP header called Link that can\nspec=\r\nify one or more stylesheets appropriate for rendering a\nresource for differ=\r\nent media. I like this idea because it keeps\nthe rendering hints entirely o=\r\nutside of the representation of the\nresource itself, which is what we&#39;ve be=\r\nen talking about.\n\nLink can also give the &quot;global&quot; links that appear at the=\r\n top and\nbottom of every page in a typical Web UI (index, contents, etc.),\n=\r\nthough I don&#39;t think such links are typically displayed by\nexisting browser=\r\ns.\n\nSee &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#h-14.6&gt;.\n(Ther=\r\ne&#39;s a note that Link is not defined by HTTP/1.1.)\n\nJustin\n\n"}}
