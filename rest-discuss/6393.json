Example: a blog entry with a list =\r\nof comments\n&gt;and an &#39;add comment&#39; form at the bottom.\n&gt;\n&gt;2 Multiple resourc=\r\nes\n&gt;A representation may display both that resource and a link to a second\n=\r\n&gt;resource used for editing or appending to the first resource. Example: a\n&gt;=\r\nblog entry with a list of comments and an &#39;add comment&#39; link at the bottom.=\r\n\n&gt;This is an example of &#39;hypertext as the engine of application state&#39;\n&gt;(ha=\r\nteoas)\n&gt;\n&gt;3 Other resources\n&gt;You could also have a third resource with refe=\r\nrences to both the &#39;data&#39;\n&gt;resource and the &#39;editing&#39; resource. The &#39;data&#39; =\r\ncould be included in the\n&gt;client (like an image) or included on the server =\r\n(some sort of\n&gt;server-side-include).\n&gt;\n\nWhat about:\n\n4.  Multiple represent=\r\nations\nWhat if we want the resource to appear inside an edit form, instead =\r\nof having an edit form as part of the resource or linked to the resource.  =\r\nI&#39;m actually using this format:\n\nhttp://example.com/resource;view=3Dedit\n\nT=\r\nhis URL is another representation of the URI http://example.com/resource wi=\r\nth the content of the page in a &lt;textarea&gt;.  It is access-controlled via HT=\r\nTP AUTH, /resource is not.  The PUT goes to /resource upon form submission.=\r\n\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
