I guess\n&gt; the recent TAG meeting brought up some of the differences between Roy\n&gt; Fielding&#39;s idea of REST and the various ways to term is used and misused\n&gt; today.   If anyone would care to suggest alternative terminology or\n&gt; voice support for terms currently in the charter, please do so soon.\n\nwe have had (long and eventually fruitless) discussions around this in \nthe WS-REST workshops. the problem is as follows:\n\n- technically speaking, REST is an architectural style, and we don&#39;t \nwant to refer to just this style, because that would allow us to build \nsomething other than the web, and we don&#39;t want to do that.\n\n- what we usually want to refer to by &quot;REST is&quot; &quot;the web used \ncorrectly&quot;, which means using the basic standards URI and HTTP and the \nsupporting fabric of registered URI schemes, media types, and link \nrelations. but unfortunately, there is no term for that other than &quot;the \nweb used correctly&quot;.\n\nso we (the WS-REST participants) ended up concluding that even though \n&quot;RESTful&quot; is a somehow incorrect name, it is the best we have. for what \nwe really want to say, there is no better name than &quot;the web used \ncorrectly&quot;, and that sounds very awkward. so we continue to say \n&quot;RESTful&quot;, even though i do agree that it is not the best name to use.\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
