Just because\nthey have a\n&gt; Uri doesn&#39;t mean the=\r\ny can be dereferenced, and if they are, what\nwould they\n&gt; return?

It seems if you have\nETags as URIs that could be der=\r\neferenced, then that means you&#39;re\nkeeping around old versions of your resou=\r\nrces to return.  Or I suppose\nyou could 303 old ETags URIs to the latest on=\r\ne, but that requires some\nsort of ETag history.\n\n\n&gt; There&#39;s also mention of=\r\n the possibility of the server doing a merge\non the\n&gt; fly from a put. Isn&#39;t=\r\n this in conflict of the work being put into\n&gt; resurfacing PATCH?\n\nI suppos=\r\ne, but remember, this document was written in 1999.

It makes\n=\r\n&gt; mention that the authors believe that a bug in the design of ETags is\n&gt; t=\r\nhat they are not first class objects.  In this case, first class\n&gt; objects =\r\nmeans making them URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering if anyone else has heard of so=\r\nmething like this or has\n&gt; seen it implemented anywhere?
