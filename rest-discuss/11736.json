Here&#39;s what I wrote back then [1].  \nInterestin=\r\ngly, after a presentation I gave yesterday, somebody  \nsuggested something =\r\nvery similar; Paul Fremantle, who happened to be  \nthere, and myself still =\r\nbelieve this would be worth pursuing.\n\nA while back, Sanjiva Weerawarana pr=\r\noposed (via email) a way to  \ndecentralize media types. I think the proposa=\r\nl was excellent; Dan  \nDiephouse=92s excellent latest blog post [2] reminde=\r\nd me of it again.  \nHere=92s a brief introduction to a possible solution fo=\r\nr =93decentralizing  \nmedia types=94.\n\nThe Problem\nIn a plain HTTP interact=\r\nion, the Content-type and Accept headers carry  \ninformation about the type=\r\n of the data being transmitted and accepted,  \nrespectively. You=92ve seen =\r\nthese media types in numerous examples, e.g.  \na typical request or respons=\r\ne might have a Content-type header with  \nthe value application/xml.\n\nThe p=\r\nroblem with this approach is that media types have to be  \nregistered centr=\r\nally with IANA. This means that while you can invent  \nyour own media types=\r\n, nobody will know about them =97 unless you go  \nthrough the time-consumin=\r\ng process of actually having your media type  \nregistered.\n\nWhat=92s wrong =\r\nwith application/xml? Nothing, really, except that it  \ndoesn=92t tell you =\r\nanything more than that what is being sent is XML:  \nYou don=92t have any w=\r\nay to tell what XML it is unless you actually  \nparse and e.g. look at the =\r\nouter element=92s XML namespace.\n\nThe Solution\nWhat Sanjiva (and his collab=\r\norators, Paul Fremantle, Jonathan Marsh  \nand James Clark) propose is this:=\r\n Define a single new media type,  \napplication/data-format, with a required=\r\n parameter uri. This uri  \npoints to a definition of the data format, like =\r\nthis:\n\napplication/data-format;uri=3Dhttp://mediatypes.example.com/foo/bar\n=\r\n\nThe uri is an HTTP URI that points to an RDDL document, in other  \nwords: =\r\nyou can do an HTTP GET on it and retrieve a documentation of  \nthe data for=\r\nmat that=92s both human-readbable as well as machine- \nprocessable.\n\nMy Opi=\r\nnion\nI think this is an excellent proposal, specifically because it does  \n=\r\nnot rely on a centralized authority, and re-uses the namespacing  \nconcepts=\r\n of the Web. It=92s also fully agnostic towards any specific  \ndata format =\r\n=97 you can use your own binary or text format, something  \nlike JSON or YA=\r\nML, and if you pick XML, you=92re free to use DTDs, RELAX  \nNG schemas, Sch=\r\nematron or even XML Schema to document it. It=92s also  \ngreat in that it a=\r\nllows for clients with different knowledge about any  \nparticular format to=\r\n do their best to handle it. One client might be  \nhard-coded against the c=\r\nomplete string; another might retrieve the  \nRDDL, look for an XSD, and dyn=\r\namically render some fancy visual  \nrepresentation.\n\nI think the concept co=\r\nuld even be extended to allow for querying of  \nsupported media types: You =\r\ncould just do a GET on the resource with an  \naccept header of application/=\r\ndata-format and get back the link to the  \nRDDL (if there is any).\n\nMaybe t=\r\nhere=92s something immediately, obviously wrong with this idea =97  \nbut if=\r\n so, I can=92t see it.
