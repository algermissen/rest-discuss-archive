That\n&gt; URI is perfectly fine, even if what you GET from it differs depending\n&gt; upon who invoked GET, the time of day, etc..  To say otherwise is\n&gt; to prevent me from identifying a whole class of useful resources,\n&gt; such as &quot;The person to my right&quot;, &quot;The colour of the next traffic\n&gt; light up ahead&quot;, etc..\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
