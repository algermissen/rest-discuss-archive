I will point out\nthat most of the time I employ &quot;user-specific&quot; URIs - even when using\na cookie to track the user. I do this via 3xx redirects to maintain\nconsistent (and cache-able) hypermedia documents.\n\nFor example, after establishing the user tracking element (cookie or\nhttp auth), my HTML document might have this link:\n&lt;a href=&quot;/read-mail/&quot;&gt;read my mail&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhen the user activates the link the HTTP request/response will look like this:\n\nREQUEST:\nGET /read-mail/\nCookie: mail-session:&lt;secured-random-value&gt;\n\nRESPONSE\n303 See Other\nLocation /read-mail/&lt;mail-box-id&gt;/\n\nBTW - in the case of cookie-tracking, you also need to guard against\nall the common security problems associated w/ stealing forging cookie\ndata. For that reason, I prefer HTTP Auth in cases like these.\n\nMike Amundsen\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 9:03 AM, Michael Schuerig &lt;michael@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve come to see pretty URLs as part of a resource-oriented system,\n&gt; although this is not strictly true, of course. That I&#39;ve been using\n&gt; Ruby on Rails for several years may have had some influence.\n&gt;\n&gt; For layering sessions on top of stateless HTTP I know of two common\n&gt; ways: cookies and encoding a session ID in each URL. The latter is\n&gt; potentially vulnerable to hijacking and fixation attacks. The former\n&gt; obviously requires cookies and doesn&#39;t allow two parallel sessions in\n&gt; the same browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a way to have my cake and eat it: pretty and public\n&gt; URLs, no cookies or javascript required, and sessions nevertheless. And\n&gt; everything nicely RESTful, of course. I&#39;m rather certain that this is\n&gt; an impossible combination, however, I thought I&#39;d ask before giving up\n&gt; early.\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Michael Schuerig\n&gt; mailto:michael@...\n&gt; http://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
