I guess they&#39;re called\nmembers member resources? :), especially upfront where there&#39;s a\nstandard which can say so.\n\n&gt; I feel I&#39;m misunderstanding something when people say that resources\n&gt; do not and should not have types.\n\nEverything has &quot;type&quot;, of course, but the question is when you know\nwhat that type is and how defined it is. If you just GET an URI and\nreceive text/html back, you&#39;ve got a text document of type &quot;html&quot;\nback, so there&#39;s always type there, but it doesn&#39;t tell me if it&#39;s\nabout travel or geekdom. If I GET on an URI and get\ntext/application+xml, I get a very basic text document of type &quot;xml&quot;.\nWhat people really would like is to GET text/application+xml with some\nextra type identifier, as that generic XML can contain anything. Of\ncourse, that simply means they either don&#39;t get REST, or they are too\nlazy to make proper content-types. (You could also trust the server\nthat the generic XML contains the content-type you asked for, but that\nwould be a bit suicidal ...)\n\nThen there&#39;s the discussion of what the word &quot;type&quot; really means, even\nin information science. I suspect most is of a somewhat taxonomatic\nprescription, IMHO leading to all sorts of weak modeling, but that&#39;s a\ndifferent thread (and mailing-list) :)\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
