It would replace your entire list\n&gt;  of bookmarks with the supplied list. Also, supporting DELETE on that\n&gt;  URI should allow you to delete the entire list en-masse.\n\nIf this were a real implementation and not an example to demonstrate the \nprinciples of REST then I&#39;d implement GET, PUT and DELETE on all \nresources that made sense. Maybe I should include more on this somewhere.\n\n&gt;  Also, why bother to wrap count and update time in their own\n&gt;  micro-schemas? Why not just return the raw answer?\n\nYeh, I thought about this. I wanted to keep the content formats simple \nand consistent, so I stuck with XML throughout the whole example. Maybe \nit&#39;d show off the flexibility of REST and data formats, to have these \ntwo resources return plain text.\n\n&gt;  On approximately\n&gt;  the same subject, IWBN also if there was a way to request a different\n&gt;  return format than XML; RFC822 responses or HTML, perhaps. Or why not\n&gt;  hide the api alongside the current codebase by adding a request\n&gt;  header that would specify the return type as xml instead of the\n&gt;  default html?\n\nThis would be the next step since as Mark baker said &quot;The Web is what \nWeb services are trying to be&quot;, there should be no difference between \nthe resources for the browser or for a machine. However this is beyond \nthe scope of my article.\n\n&gt;  My coupla pennies based on my experience reconciling REST with a\n&gt;  &#39;normal&#39; web interface.\n&gt;\n&gt;  --pj\n\nThanks, Paul.\n\n"}}
