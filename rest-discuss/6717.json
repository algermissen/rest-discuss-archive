Looking at the following example, I \nwould expe=\r\nct a 404 Not Found error if the DELETE targeted a non-\nexistent language re=\r\npresentation even if a default representation has \nbeen created:\n\n    PUT /=\r\nfoo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Language: *\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n    PUT=\r\n /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Language: fr-CA\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n =\r\n   DELETE /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Language: fr-FR\n\n    HTTP/1.1 404 N=\r\not Found\n\nAll well and good.\n\nHowever, when it comes to a GET or HEAD reque=\r\nst then the situation \nseems more muddled. Looking at the following example=\r\n, I would expect \nto see a 200 OK on a GET with Accept-Language (because th=\r\nere is a \ndefault representation available):\n\n    PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n   =\r\n Content-Language: *\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n    PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n =\r\n   Content-Language: fr-CA\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n    GET /foo.rdf HTTP=\r\n/1.1\n    Accept-Language: fr-FR\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nNow for a browser-bas=\r\ned user experience, this is good. But if the \nclient is a robot then the si=\r\ntuation is not as clear. Assuming that \nthe response has the Content-Langua=\r\nge value set, then I suppose that \nthe robot could invalidate the response =\r\nif it is only actually \ninterested in the fr-FR representation. This doesn&#39;=\r\nt really feel \nright to me though.\n\nSo, reading the owners manual at \nhttp:=\r\n//www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.12 , I \nam consider=\r\ning a scenario where a GET or HEAD request that specifies \na Content-Langua=\r\nge will respond with the 404 Not Found explicitly:\n\n    PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1=\r\n.1\n    Content-Language: *\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n    PUT /foo.rdf HTTP=\r\n/1.1\n    Content-Language: fr-CA\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n    GET /foo.rd=\r\nf HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Language: fr-FR\n\n    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n\nThis fe=\r\nels much better to me, but although the HTTP spec does not \nprohibit this (=\r\nContent-Language is an entity header) I cannot find \nany references to any =\r\nimplementation of such behaviour.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlan Dean\n\n\n\n"}}
