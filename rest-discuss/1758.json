For example when a\nresouce needs to represent itself, in XML, using different schema.\n\n&gt; If you access the data with something like these:\n&gt;  SELECT * from view_2 where key = $id\n&gt;  SELECT * from view_3 where key = $id\n&gt;\n&gt; then I think /that/ would be REST &#39;representation&#39; - the resource\n&gt; ID hasn&#39;t changed, only the content returned.\n\nAgreed; I was assuming the use of a surrogate key for entity identity - a\ncommon way of mapping objects to SQL DBMS - rather than the namespace\noperations refered to above.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n"}}
