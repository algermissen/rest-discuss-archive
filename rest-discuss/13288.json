Choosing to\n&gt; have JBoss lead a=\r\nnd own such an effort in a JCP-style way doesn&#39;t\n&gt; inspire me good things e=\r\nither.\n&gt;\n&gt; In addition, the &quot;REST-*&quot; naming is so uninspiring that it must =\r\nhave\n&gt; been suggested by a REST opponent! It reminds me of the attempt to\n&gt;=\r\n describe the JAX-RS API as the &quot;REST API for Java&quot;...\n&gt;\n&gt; REST defines arc=\r\nhitecture principles, not protocols, not media types  \n&gt; and\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even=\r\n mandate the use of HTTP. The term &quot;REST API&quot; is already\n&gt; ambiguous but wi=\r\ndely used as a shortcut for &quot;RESTful [HTTP] API&quot;.  \n&gt; Please\n&gt; don&#39;t add co=\r\nnfusion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI have to agree with J=E9rome in practically every aspect.\n\n&gt; =\r\nIn addition, I think that the idea of &quot;standardizing&quot; such RESTful  \n&gt; HTTP=\r\n\n&gt; APIs at this stage is just wrong and will lead to results similar to\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nWS-*&quot; due to politics and market timing issues.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nMy suggestion would be =\r\nto move this off the JBoss domain, change the  \nname, and invite the commun=\r\nity to define (or rewrite) the charter -  \ni.e. turn this into a best pract=\r\nices site that might spawn  \nstandardization HTTP-related efforts at e.g. I=\r\nETF (where they belong).\n\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t mean that proposing RESTful APIs for=\r\n such problems isn&#39;t\n&gt; useful or necessary. As you know, there are already =\r\nexisting efforts  \n&gt; in\n&gt; those areas and having more attempts at this stag=\r\ne sounds useful. For\n&gt; example, Google recently announced its PubSubHubbub =\r\neffort:\n&gt; http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, let the most pop=\r\nular media types (such as Atom) or RESTful APIs\n&gt; (such as Amazon S3) win a=\r\nnd be leveraged by developers and supported  \n&gt; by\n&gt; tools. Just don&#39;t lead=\r\n people into thinking that there is or even need\n&gt; to be a consensus in the=\r\n REST community on how to define such RESTful\n&gt; APIs, especially when you h=\r\naven&#39;t even consulted it with your plans.\n&gt;\n&gt; My suggestion is that Roy qui=\r\nckly starts and leads an official REST\n&gt; project, maybe at the W3C or at IE=\r\nTF where important things engaging  \n&gt; the\n&gt; REST community could be organi=\r\nzed and decided. I&#39;m afraid otherwise  \n&gt; that\n&gt; such a wonderful adventure=\r\n will get side-tracked or harmed.\n&gt;\nHere I have to disagree - I don&#39;t have =\r\nany idea what an &quot;official REST  \nproject&quot; might be doing.\n\nBest,\nStefan\n\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jerome Louvel\n&gt; --\n&gt; Restlet ~ Founder and Lead develope=\r\nr ~ http://www.restlet.org\n&gt; Noelios Technologies ~ Co-founder ~ http://www=\r\n.noelios.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy T.
