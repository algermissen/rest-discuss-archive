Since each URI represents a resource, the back button means &quot;go\n&gt; back to the previously viewed resource&quot;.  It does not mean &quot;undo  \n&gt; what I\n&gt; just did&quot;.  If that previously viewed resource has changed, then  \n&gt; when I\n&gt; hit the back button, I should see the changed resource.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m only talking about conversational state, not persistent state.  \nBut I stand corrected about the shopping carts. I looked around,  \nincluding at Amazon, and every one I tried was essentially giving me  \nthe user, or my browser, one and only one shopping cart. It was  \npersistent not only when backing up, but also between browser  \nsessions. If I kill the browser then restart and go back, the one and  \nonly one shopping cart&#39;s still there with whatever I had last put in  \nit. The sites are all recognizing me by persistent cookies. So  \nshopping carts seem to be persistent state in practice. I guess when  \nyou put something into a cart, they want to force you to take it out  \nyourself, in the hopes that you&#39;ll eventually buy it.\n\n&gt; Thus it is perfectly reasonable to use a single URI to represent a\n&gt; shopping cart.  Suppose I go through the following views:  Item A  \n&gt; detail\n&gt; --(purchase item A)--&gt; shopping cart --(shop more)--&gt; main shopping  \n&gt; page\n&gt; --(search for item B)--&gt; item B detail --(purchase item B)--&gt; shopping\n&gt; cart.  The shopping cart will show two items: A and B.  Then if I hit\n&gt; the back button 3 times, I should be back at the shopping cart, which\n&gt; would again show items A and B.  (When I navigate there, the browser\n&gt; will contact the server with an If-Modified-Since header, so it will\n&gt; know the cart has been updated, and it has to retrieve the resource.)\n&gt;\nYes, not all the sites that I looked at did that nicely. I sometimes  \nhad to hit reload, because the browser showed the page from the  \nbrowser&#39;s cache when I backed up. So when I backed up, the last thing  \nI put in disappeared, but when I hit reload, it reappeared.\n\nWhen I use the back button, is that a way to view history, or is that  \njust a way to go back to a URI I previously visited? In other words,  \ndo browsers generally obey the caching directives when the user backs  \nup? If back means history, then they wouldn&#39;t need to. If it is  \nrather a way to go to a previously visited URI, then if that page was  \nsent with headers indicating it should be checked again with if- \nmodified-since or if-none-match, then the browser should do that when  \nI back up.\n\n&gt; Your suggestion of representing each state of the shopping cart as a\n&gt; separate resource is not unRESTful.  Some people might even like it.\n&gt; But it is not the only way to do things.  And it does require more\n&gt; storage/sophistication on the part of the server.  In your model, the\n&gt; back button still means &quot;go back to the previously viewed  \n&gt; resource&quot;, but\n&gt; your resource is now a single state of my resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Conceptually, I think most people think of a shopping cart, rather  \n&gt; than\n&gt; the state of a shopping cart, as a resource.  So, I think my (and Bill\n&gt; de la H&#39;s) method is more intuitive.\n&gt;\nI agree with you now (and especially, with Amazon) on that point.  \nShopping carts are persistent state, not conversational state, so  \nthey are inappropriate to use as example of using snapshots rather  \nthan user sessions for maintaining conversational state.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
