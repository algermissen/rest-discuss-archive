The =\r\n&#39;scheme&#39;\n&gt; attribute contains the /collection/ path, while the /document/ p=\r\nath is\n&gt; implicit in the request URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; The server logic is written such =\r\nthat /collection/foo is a stored search\n&gt; for documents containing &lt;categor=\r\ny term=3D&#39;foo&#39;/&gt;. This search is re-\n&gt; executed and given a new Etag as req=\r\nuired by the server, which detects\n&gt; re-tagging in PUT (or PATCH) requests.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Since no resources are being created or deleted in tagging operations,=\r\n\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t use POST or DELETE at all. But this solution is still REST,\n&gt;=\r\n and Atom Protocol (except for the PATCH bit).\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n\n"}}
