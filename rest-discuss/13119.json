Provided the xml or json representation of a\nresource are semantically equivalent (aka contain the same state), I see no\nreason not to use conneg on those. The expectation of an automated user\nagent is not the same as the expectation of a user, and as such I don&#39;t see\nmuch benefit in pushing for separate URIs for different serializations of\nthe same resource state.\n\nAs for choosing multiple media types that are available, provided you\npromote the ones that should be linkable independently (and my definition of\nwhat is desirably independent is based on user expectation), we already have\nthis, with a 300 response to a simple GET on a generic URI. Agent-driven\nconneg is perfectly acceptable but requires separate URIs for each notable\nrepresentation.\n\nAs for the difference between resource and representation, it can be blurry,\nas a resource may have multiple representations, and a representation may be\na resource itself (aka have its own URI).\n\nThe awww:resource is anything important enough to have a URI. When\ndereferencing such URI, the response may be no representation (in which case\nit may be an http URI denoting a thing, for example as used in rdf), one\nrepresentation (there is one representation sent to the client, based on\nConneg or current state of the resource), the resource could be the\nrepresentation (in which case it&#39;s an IR, the resource is the\nrepresentation, in the sense that all properties of the resource can be\ntransferred in the representation), or a list of representations through a\n300 (and then one cannot decipher the kind of resource we&#39;re talking about,\nbut can access individual representations promoted as resources through the\nuris linked in the response).\n\nIt&#39;s not blurred as such, it&#39;s the current landscape of what resources are\nand what URI denotes on the web.\n\nSeb\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mike Kelly [mailto:mike@...]\n&gt; Sent: 22 July 2009 14:41\n&gt; To: Sebastien Lambla\n&gt; Cc: &#39;Dhananjay Nene&#39;; &#39;Rest List&#39;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] HTTP State Transitions\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm.. how about html/rss/atom/json then?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you get sent a link to /resource and don&#39;t want HTML - don&#39;t open it\n&gt; with a browser! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Those kinds of problems could be solved with something equivalent to an\n&gt; &#39;Open With..&#39; menu, which could makes an OPTIONS request to the URI and\n&gt; list installed HTTP clients that accept any of the available\n&gt; Content-Type&#39;s listed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The distinction between representations and resources in your suggested\n&gt; approach seems pretty blurred (assuming the ends of URIs are opaque, of\n&gt; course!).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sebastien Lambla wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The problem comes from this: conneg served on the same URI should be\n&gt; used\n&gt; &gt; when the variation between the multiple representations is not\n&gt; important or\n&gt; &gt; substantial.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If it&#39;s important enough that the returned representation be constant\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; time for you to send a link to that specific representation, that\n&gt; &gt; representation ought to be promoted to its own URI as a separate\n&gt; resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So while conneg used for formatting dates may well be a valid use and\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; not necessitate a separate resource, I&#39;m pretty sure a pdf / html or\n&gt; a jpg /\n&gt; &gt; gif will become quite problematic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Mike Kelly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: 22 July 2009 14:10\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: Dhananjay Nene; Rest List\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] HTTP State Transitions\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is a state transition adequately defined by:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; GET /resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or is it more appropriate to include the entire of the message?\n&gt; i.e.:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; GET /resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Accept: application/pdf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Accept-Language: en-us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; .... etc\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If browsers treated each state as the full HTTP message, bookmarks\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; page refreshes would not &#39;break&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As it stands; if a browser refreshed or bookmarked the latter state,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Accept header would revert back to default (text/html, etc..)\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the only part of the state transition stored is the URI/Verb\n&gt; &gt;&gt; combination.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dhananjay Nene wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure if I am the only one .. but couldn&#39;t really understand the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; question.
