Any thoughts??\n&gt; \n\nFirst thought?  Google ought to know better.  If the desire is to GET\nan image from the server, rotated + or - x degrees, then the proper\nmethod is GET, not an RPC POST.\n\nGET /image.jpg?rot=90\n\nThis GET may be generated using a simple HTML form, and the application/\nx-www-urlencoded media type identifier.  Note that in such case, the\nmedia type identifier isn&#39;t going over the wire; it&#39;s informing the\nclient how to construct a query URL from a form.\n\nThere&#39;s no excuse not to use GET to rotate image.jpg on the server side,\nor PUT to change the state of image.jpg:\n\nPUT /image.jpg\nentity = cached /image.jpg?rot=90 from previous GET\n\nClient fetches desired rotation from server, uses it to overwrite non-\nrotated resource.  It just doesn&#39;t get any simpler than this, certainly\nnowhere near as complicated as Google makes it.\n\nThat&#39;s REST.  Hopefully, the benefit is obvious over RPC:  Caching.\nWhich is why Google ought to know better.  BTW, one of the most common\nmisperceptions I see about REST is that it&#39;s limited to four methods\nwhich map directly to CRUD.\n\nAt least Google recognizes PATCH, but the truth is you can use as many\nstandardized methods you need to model your application interactions,\nwithout resorting to the RPC pattern of tunneling them over POST.\n\n(Added benefit:  using Etag and conditional requests to prevent the\nlost-update problem, which would manifest itself here as rotating the\nimage 180 degrees.  How does Google avoid this?  Not clear from the\nPOST example; obvious using REST.)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
