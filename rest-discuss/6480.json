The others can \n&gt; all validly return 202 codes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Section 9 of RFC2068 specifically mentions returning a 202 for a\n&gt; DELETE request but does not mention 202 as a valid response for either\n&gt; PUT or POST. Since section 9 is about method descriptions I am not\n&gt; taking the omission of 202 as being a definitive statement about it\n&gt; being disallowed.\n\nAgreed. It seems perfectly reasonable to expect that a PUT or POST\nmight be delayed, for any number of reasons, and that a 202 response\nwould be correct, from the description in 10.2.3.\n \n&gt; It all seems quite straight forward but then you get into issues about\n&gt; idempotency. PUT and DELETE are both idempotent (section 9.1.2). I was\n&gt; thinking that any asynchronous request would return a 202 along with a\n&gt; URI for a status monitor resource. I assume this would break the\n&gt; idempotency rule since each invocation would involve the creation of a\n&gt; new resource - the status monitor. \n\nI&#39;m not certain why this would be true -- a status monitor is, in the\nfirst place, optional; a server is by no means required to provide the\nclient with one.\n\nIt would also be possible for a status monitor URL to be just another\nview of the resource, say,\n\nhttp://www.example.com/resource;status\n\nIn that case, the monitor url would be the same for all clients, and\ncould just show the status of any pending requests on the resource.\nAdditional PUT or DELETE requests might change this status view, but\nwouldn&#39;t necessarily be creating additional resources.\n\nFinally, if new status monitors are created on every PUT or DELETE\nrequest, but are deleted as soon as the operation is completed, then\nidempotence is preserved, since the state of the server after several\nrequests is the same as after a single request. The extra side effects\n(of creating status monitors) are temporary.\n\n\nIan Clelland\n&lt;ian@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
