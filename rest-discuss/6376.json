What URL \nshould you hit to get the form to edit the resource.  Say your resource is at:\nhttp://foo.com/entry/1\n\nIf I GET that URL, I&#39;d get a view of the resource in (x)html that&#39;s not \neditable.  How do I get the form to edit it?  REST doesn&#39;t seem to understand \nthe use of forms on the client side to do editing at all.\n\nHow do I RESTfully get a form to create a new &quot;entry&quot;?\n\nScott\n\nJan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt; Scott,\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO forms should either be discovered while the client proceeds  \n&gt; through the application&#39;s state machine or the MIME type that  \n&gt; supports the desired interactions should provide sufficient semantics  \n&gt; so the client knows when to expect the forms (e.g. Atom Publishing  \n&gt; Protocol&#39;s &lt;accept&gt; element)\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep in mind that a form is essentially information provided by the  \n&gt; server to the client about the availability of a certain  \n&gt; (parameterized) state transition within a given application.\n&gt; \n&gt; The MIME type should provide enough semantics to tell client  \n&gt; implementors how to handle a form (and maybe when to expect one) and  \n&gt; the server should then just provide the forms as needed to enable the  \n&gt; application.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; On Aug 5, 2006, at 6:58 PM, Scott Chapman wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If hitting a URL with GET is supposed to give you a view of the  \n&gt;&gt; resource and\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s not a form by default, then how to do you get a &lt;form...&gt; view  \n&gt;&gt; of it for\n&gt;&gt; editing?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The same applies to getting a blank form for creating a new resource.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How are people handling these situations in their RESTful designs?\n&gt;&gt;\n\n"}}
