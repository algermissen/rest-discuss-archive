Wouldn&#39;t it make sense\n&gt; to ask the resource what it is capable of?\n\nThe best way to discover what a resource is capable of is probably to\ntry the thing you need it to do, and see if it succeeds or fails. One of\nthe issues with WDSL and RPC in general is this concept of negotiation\nwith an object or resource before being able to carry on a conversation.\nIt doesn&#39;t yield information a machine can generally make use of. Most\nclients will and should know what they need to do before initiating a\nconvesation. Discovery is mostly about and figuring out who they need to\ndo it with, and primarily comes in the form of preconfigured urls or\ndiscovery via hyperlinks in the representations of other resources.\n\nDoing an OPTIONS on a resource you already know you want to hold a\nconversation with is not as useful in practical REST as it might seem,\nunless perhaps you are a human being trying to debug a faulty\ninteraction.\n\nJerome Louvel &lt;contact@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; Ideally frameworks should dynamically generate alternative\ndescriptions \n&gt; (WADL, HTML, etc.) based on some internal metadata about the\nresources \n&gt; so the burden on developers would be minimal.\n\nREST is a lesscode technology based on solid protocol-level agreements\nbetween client and server, rather than generated code to make up the\ndifference. Tools for generating code to interact with RESTful resources\nare scarce because there is typically very little code to generate. A\ngeneric mechanism just as RESTlet is capable of getting, putting,\nposting and deleting state associated with any resource. Little code\nneeds to be generated: just a url, method, and content provided. A\nseparate library can manage encoding of data into an appropriate content\ntype, and decoding on the other side.\n\nA description of the URLs of a web server could be useful in\nauto-completing and validating the set of urls used as initial\nconfiguration. Such a map should not, however, be used for URL\nConstruction. Any such map will benefit the server much more than the\nclient, and is useful in that environment (eg routes). \n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
