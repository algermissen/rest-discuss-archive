Can anybody think of one; a constraint on the\n&gt;&gt; relationship of architectural elements which does *not* separate any\n&gt;&gt; concerns?\n&gt;\n&gt;Fascinating indeed. Here&#39;s a potential counterexample: a latency\n&gt;constraint. Suppose a protocol coupling two components imposes a\n&gt;severe latency constraint, eg a reply must be received within 50ms.\n&gt;This is more constrained than a protocol without a latency constraint,\n&gt;but the components are now more tightly coupled, eg they must be\n&gt;spatially closer.\n&gt;\n&gt;More generally I have problems with the assertion that more\n&gt;constraints on a protocol means looser coupling of the components\n&gt;coupled by the protocol. If this were true, wouldn&#39;t the massive\n&gt;number of constraints imposed by CORBA and DCOM mean that the\n&gt;components coupled by these architectures were the MOST loosely\n&gt;coupled? Yet no one thinks of such components as loosely coupled.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think the invalid step in Jan&#39;s logic is in assuming that highly\n&gt;constrained protocols can be pervasive. Here&#39;s how I see his logic\n&gt;\n&gt;1. The more components that share common semantics in the protocol\n&gt;that interfaces among them, the more loosely coupled the component are\n&gt;(&quot;because coupling between components is induced by non-pervasive\n&gt;semantics shared between components&quot;). [This I agree with.]\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Therefore, push as much (unshared) component semantics into the\n&gt;(shared) protocol as possible. [The problem with this strategy is that\n&gt;the very act of pushing more semantics into the protocol makes the\n&gt;protocol less generic (aka general purpose), which means that fewer\n&gt;components will use it, which means the shared semantics are now not\n&gt;very pervasive.]\n&gt;\n&gt;In general, I think loose coupling is an incredibly subtle concept,\n&gt;which unfortunately can not be reduced to something as simplistic as\n&gt;&quot;maximize shared constraints&quot;. There is much more of a &quot;balance&quot;\n&gt;required between the degree of constraint and the pervasiveness of\n&gt;such constraints.\n&gt;\n&gt;A concept from economics seems relevant in this context -- Stigler&#39;s\n&gt;general specialties (now known as General Purpose Technologies):\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;This coupling of specialization of function with generalization of\n&gt;capabilities recalls the generalist merchants of the early republic.\n&gt;It is in fact a typical feature of the Smithian process. In his famous\n&gt;analysis of that process, George Stigler (1951, p. 192) referred to\n&gt;what he called &#39;general specialties.&#39; He had in mind activities like\n&gt;railroads, shipping, and banking that can benefit a variety of\n&gt;industries; but contract suppliers are clearly examples in the small ?\n&gt;microcosmic instances of what economists now call general-purpose\n&gt;technologies (Helpman 1998).&quot; &quot;The Vanishing Hand&quot;\n&gt;http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~langlois/Vanishing.html.\n&gt;\n&gt;See Wikipedia for a (too) short entry on GPTs:\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Technology .\n&gt;\n&gt;Thus I would change Jan&#39;s conjecture to: &quot;The more a system is general\n&gt;purpose and broadly adopted, the more the components are loosely coupled.&quot;\n&gt;How many constraints a purpose system should have will be more subtle\n&gt;balance than &quot;as many as possible&quot;, since too many constraints will\n&gt;cause it to be less general and therefore less broadly adopted. The\n&gt;80/20 rule is appropriate here: design protocols in which a small number of\n&gt;constraints can address a large (and diverse) set of needs.\n&gt;\n&gt;My favorite example of the relaxation of constraints causing even looser\n&gt;coupling (besides the Internet and the Web protocols) is the invention of\n&gt;the intermodal shipping container.
