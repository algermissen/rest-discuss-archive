Every piece of meaning that is implicit\n&gt; about a URI (if it were not opaque) is information that can not be\n&gt; easily used for automation by a machine.\n\nSorry, that&#39;s just not true, though it&#39;s a common argument for opacity.  As\nI point out in the write-up,UNIX has a long and profitable history of using\nsynthetic filenames constructed according to particular, explicitly\ndocumented conventions to do just that, i.e. automate certain things.\nConsider construction of names for things in /dev;  consider the fact that\nps on many modern UNIXes is a shell script that operates by constructing\nnames and accessing files according to a particular set of conventions on\n/proc.  What&#39;s more, opacity by itself doesn&#39;t guarantee automation any\nmore than non-opacity breaks it.\n\n&gt; Practically though, as long as there is a fixed amount of non-opaque\n&gt; information that never ever grows, you&#39;re ok because understanding it\n&gt; can be hardcoded in.  But if you want to add stuff over time, then each\n&gt; time you do all the existing agents out there trying to automate stuff,\n&gt; will need upgrading.\n\nThis isn&#39;t true, either --- unless you assume that the grammars and\nsemantics of these names aren&#39;t made explicit.  The whole process can be\nfully automated by providing a generative grammar for names and some\nsemantic description for said names.  Granted that you want to make\neverything as explicit as possible.  But our focus on using markup to\nencode all of this stuff is somewhat historical and cultural.  Upon further\nreflection and investigation, it&#39;s not at all clear that this is preferable\nto using generative grammars for construction of names in semantically-rich\nnamespaces.\n\n&gt; Best to keep the URI opaque, and build the meaning up on the Semantic\n&gt; Web.\n\nYes, that&#39;s the dogma.  But looking at the relative complexity of, say, the\nimplementation of the PS shell script on a UNIX box with /proc and the\nimplementation of  something to grok Semantic Web stuff has me wondering.\nPerhaps giant stringy webs of RDF aren&#39;t the easiest, most useful, or best\nways to get to some of the same functionality.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
