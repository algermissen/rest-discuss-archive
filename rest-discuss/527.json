Can you explain?\n&gt; I think the answer above is that you just know\n&gt; out-of-band the resource to which the subscription\n&gt; refers.\n\nThere is a CGI script that does polling. You call it like this:\n\nhttp://poll.com/poll.cgi?uri=http://www.slashdot.org\n\nNow you get &quot;first post&quot; every time. Except for the double encoding.\nArgh, why can&#39;t URIs contain URIs?\n\nThis is another way of getting a subscription to slashdot rather than\ngoing to the page and asking it how to subscribe to it. The primary\nreason resources can declare themselves watchable and nominate their\nsubscriptions URI is because they can implement something much more\nefficient than polling!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
