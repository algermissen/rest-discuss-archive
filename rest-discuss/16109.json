This year, REST Fest will\nencourage developers who have direct experience building RESTful\napplications for the World Wide Web to share their successes and their\nfrustrations in an informal atmosphere. REST Fest will also maintain a\n&quot;Hack Room&quot; open throughout the two-day event where attendees can get\ntogether and work on any project they like. http://restfest.org\n\nCall for Presenters\nPresenters are encouraged to submit a title, short abstract (250 or\nless), and an indication of the &quot;level&quot; of the talk (beginner,\nintermediate, advanced). &quot;How To...&quot; talks are encouraged as well as\n&quot;How Do I?&quot; talks. In the spirit of the &quot;Unconference&quot; model, all\ntalks are automatically accepted as a &quot;Lightning Talk&quot; (Five Slides in\nFive Minutes). A small number of talks will be chosen as &quot;Selected\nTalks&quot; with a format of 30+ minutes. Break out sessions will be added\nas desired by the attendees. http://restfest2010.eventbrite.com/\n\nWorkshop: Hypermedia Hacking with Mike Amundsen (Sep 17th)\nIn this one-day pre-event workshop, attendees will learn how to\nimplement an alternative to one-off Web APIs by using Hypermedia\nEngines. The all-day session includes a mix of presentation,\ndiscussion, and hands-on implementation. Attendees are encouraged to\nbring laptops and &quot;code-along&quot; with supplied examples throughout the\nday. http://www.restfest.org/schedule/workshop\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n"}}
