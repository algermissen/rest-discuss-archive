Perhaps I implied=\r\n otherwise when I suggested clients might &quot;infer&quot; application state from re=\r\nceived representations: I don&#39;t in fact think that&#39;s necessary of desirable=\r\n. It&#39;s simpler than that. Clients are interested in achieving particular go=\r\nals, and they evaluate received representations of resource state in light =\r\nof those goals; that is, they choose to operate hypermedia controls - links=\r\n or forms - based on their understanding of how the control&#39;s semantic cont=\r\next (ie. link relation value) relates to their current goal. In all this, t=\r\nhe client need not necessarily know it&#39;s participating in a particular prot=\r\nocol, or be aware of the overall state of the distributed application.\n\nIs =\r\nthat in line with what you meant by this being opaque to the client?\n\nian\n\n=\r\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hi Ian,\n&gt; \n&gt; That is an excellent description of state from the server&#39;s =\r\npoint of  \n&gt; view. However, isn&#39;t all this opaque for the client?\n&gt; \n&gt; Subb=\r\nu\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 3, 2009, at 6:16 PM, Ian wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Christian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe state of an order - whether it has zero line items, or five, is  \n&gt; &gt; re=\r\nsource state, not application state. The state of the order as  \n&gt; &gt; held i=\r\nn the http session in your example is resource state, not  \n&gt; &gt; application=\r\n state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A simple - perhaps overly simple - ordering protocol might =\r\nbe  \n&gt; &gt; something like: new order created -&gt; adding line items -&gt; order  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; completed -&gt; payment received -&gt; order dispatched.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the obser=\r\nvable interactions between client and server, this  \n&gt; &gt; protocol is never =\r\nvisible &quot;as such&quot;: it can only be viewed through  \n&gt; &gt; the lens of resource=\r\n state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Over the course of a series of interactions, the &quot;applicati=\r\non&quot; (the  \n&gt; &gt; game being played out between the client and the server) wil=\r\nl be in  \n&gt; &gt; one or other of these states - as viewed from a &quot;God&#39;s eye&quot; p=\r\noint of  \n&gt; &gt; view. Once the application state has progressed to &quot;order  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; completed&quot;, for example, it&#39;s no longer possible to add manipulate  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n resources so as to add new line items; it is, however, possible to  \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nanipulate resources such that the application state transitions to  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;p=\r\nayment received&quot; (the client would do this by submitting a  \n&gt; &gt; representa=\r\ntion of a payment, perhaps).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The client and the server cooperate to=\r\n execute this protocol, but  \n&gt; &gt; they do so by transferring representation=\r\ns of resource state, not  \n&gt; &gt; representations of application state. Applic=\r\nation state is never  \n&gt; &gt; represented &quot;as such&quot;; rather, it&#39;s inferred by =\r\nthe client based on  \n&gt; &gt; on current representations of resource state. If =\r\nthe application is  \n&gt; &gt; in the &quot;order completed&quot; state, the representation=\r\n of the order  \n&gt; &gt; received by the client may very well include a link tha=\r\nt has been  \n&gt; &gt; annotated with the link relation value &quot;payment&quot;. This isn=\r\n&#39;t a  \n&gt; &gt; straightforward representation of application state, however: it=\r\n&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; an &quot;invitation&quot; to the client to transfer a representation of a  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; payment to this linked resource. As a side-effect of transferring  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n this representation, the &quot;application&quot; may transition to &quot;payment  \n&gt; &gt; re=\r\nceived&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s important here is that the server is really only in=\r\nterested  \n&gt; &gt; in maintaining resource state, which includes maintaining th=\r\ne  \n&gt; &gt; integrity of the lifecycles of the resources under its control, and=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; the invariants that hold between resources (if any). The server  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; can&#39;t be sure the client will ever take that step of submitting a  \n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nayment, so why bother holding onto application state? Application  \n&gt; &gt; sta=\r\nte is something that can be reconstructed &quot;after the fact&quot;, by a  \n&gt; &gt; clie=\r\nnt, or omniscient observer, based on the disposition of the  \n&gt; &gt; current s=\r\net of resource representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So the order representation is alwa=\r\nys a representation of resource  \n&gt; &gt; state. Application state, that &quot;snaps=\r\nhot of the instance of  \n&gt; &gt; execution of a protocol&quot;, can only be inferred=\r\n or reconstructed from  \n&gt; &gt; resource state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this is of some h=\r\nelp. Apologies if I&#39;ve confused more than  \n&gt; &gt; clarified; double apologies=\r\n if I&#39;m just talking plain nonsense.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ian\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
