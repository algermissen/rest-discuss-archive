I got some interesting\nresponses to this=\r\n.\n\nAnother (RESTful?) solution could be to POST to a resource that is\nrespo=\r\nnsible for turning a lightbulb on.  For example, POST &#92;lightswitch\nsending =\r\nin the light bulb and state (on/off) chosen.\n\nMy challenge with this second=\r\n solution is that the other verbs will not\nbe used against this resource, i=\r\nn essence this resource is pretty much a\n&quot;POST-only&quot; resource.\n\nIs that ok?=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
