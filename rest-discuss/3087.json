But perhaps you mean \nthat\n&gt; even fan-* can be abstracted as a two-party scenario, which is \npossible\n&gt; since some party (likely third party) has to take responsibility for\n&gt; providing the fan-in or fan-out point.  Have to think on that \none ...\n\nCan you tell me a story about each of those scenarios so I can get in \nin my mind better?  Preferably a business scenario, since that is all \nI would claim, and preferably identifying the participants even if \nhypothetically by class?\n\nAnd just to be clear, I&#39;m not saying that multiple parties are not \ninvolved in some way, just that only two parties need to interact at \na time, and all coordination between more than two parties is done as \nthe internal responsibility of parties with multiple commitments with \nmultiple other parties.\n\nHere&#39;s another version of the hypothesis:\nhttp://www.collaxa.com/news.blog.html#90008925\n&lt;quote&gt;\nTuesday, December 03, 2002\nMulti-Party Business Transactions - UNCEFACT White Papers - multiple\nparties were involved in the whole scenario, but they interacted in\npairs and all coordination between dependent commitments was the\ninternal and private responsibility of only one party. Here are some \nof the reasons why: simplicity, accountability as [who] agreed to do \nexactly what for exactly whom, ...the more parties to a contract, the \nmore parties have to agree on everything, ...economic commitments and \nevents involve two and only two parties, security - need-to-know. \nTrading partners need to know about each other, but they rarely need \nto know what other partners each may have, and in many cases should \nnot know even that others exist. Decoupling to avoid ripples of \nchange - if parties A and B change their procedures, it may not \naffect parties C and D, unless all four parties are bound into the \nsame contract. \n\nCollaxa&#39;s Take: +1. This design pattern also known as a star \ninteraction pattern is very important for building &quot;self healing&quot; and \nadaptable distributed applications: managing exception is easier in a \npair conversations. The same is true for version control.\nPosted 11:32 AM by Edwin Khodabakchian\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
