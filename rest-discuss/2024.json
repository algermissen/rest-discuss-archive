The SOAP juggernaut is mindless. It will\nroll happily towards or away from REST as long as everybody can certify\ntheir products &quot;SOAP Compliant.&quot; There are still many specs in the web\nservices world that are not very REST-y but SOAP is the spec with the\nmost cachet.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Which is all well and good, but a subsequent POST is done to a generic\n&gt; &quot;Reservations&quot;\n&gt; resource, and the &#39;real&#39; resource is referenced using the UUID buried in the\n&gt; posted envelope,\n\nI agree that&#39;s a problem but there is an example in the primer that is a\nlittle better. Look at &quot;Example 13&quot;:\n\nPOST /Reservations?name=John%20Q.%20Public HTTP/1.1\nHost: travelcompany.example.org\nContent-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\nContent-Length: nnnn\n\n&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; ?&gt;\n&lt;env:Envelope xmlns:env=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope&quot; &gt;\n &lt;env:Header&gt;\n ...\n\nIt still uses a UUID inside which it should not. \n\nIt is not too late to submit suggestions to the SOAP Primer. Here are my\ncomments that address the prose more than the examples:\n\n * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2002Jul/0050.html\n\nYou could submit some about the examples. UUIDs do not make much sense\neven from a pure-SOAP anti-REST point of view because HTTP URIs can have\nSOAP messages sent to them but UUIDs cannot. UUIDs only make sense when\nyou realize that SOAP is supposed to be &quot;transport independent&quot; which\nmeans that you cannot depend upon a reliable addressing model. So you\nhave to build your own. You can imagine how great that is for\ninteroperability.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
