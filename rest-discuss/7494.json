But I think you are\ntrying to design a web in which clients learn you rules of hierarchy\nand then navigate your site by synthesizing URL&#39;s by following\nthe rules.\n\nMeanwhile, URIs are supposed to be opaque from the client\nangle, and it should by hypertext that is guiding them along the\npath from one resource to the next.  Have you read up much on\nthese concepts?\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
