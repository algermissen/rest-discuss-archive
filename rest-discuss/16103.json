In def=\r\nence of a better grade than B, how to code the client wasn&#39;t the question, =\r\nthough :P  As creator of a public API (my assumption), I have no little to =\r\nno control over the client implementation (although I think !success will b=\r\necome part of my boilerplate docs).  \n\n\nActually, REST aims to prevent &#39;ser=\r\nvice functionality driven design&#39; and instead forces us to standardize the =\r\npayload (inlcuding link rel) semantics first[1]. In a REStful system you ca=\r\nnnot sit down, discuss some desired functions exposed by a service and then=\r\n provide some service-specific payload semantics. Services can only be desi=\r\ngned around already standardized hypermedia semantics.\n\nThat is the driving=\r\n force that prevents client implementations to be coupled to the sematics o=\r\nf a single service.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1] Even if that will often be an interative p=\r\nrocess, of course.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The best I can do is make the URI opaque, provide=\r\n some variations to get at that URI (link header, form taking the year and =\r\nreturning a location, etc.), and clearly indicate the expected behaviour wh=\r\nen that URI is called.  You&#39;ll notice that in all of the suggestions, inclu=\r\nding Eric&#39;s, you have to communicate to the client creator what behaviour t=\r\no code against.  I think it less important specifically which choice is mad=\r\ne, but rather that such choices are consistent across the API and are commu=\r\nnicated clearly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having said that, using forums like this to debate im=\r\nplementation will hopefully lead us towards some standard approaches to thi=\r\nngs such as boolean responses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Food for thought: \n&gt; \n&gt; I inferred that=\r\n the intent of the exercise was to provide &#39;is leap year&#39; functionality and=\r\n that whether it&#39;s actually backed by PHP&#39;s mcal_is_leap_year() function is=\r\n not that important.  In fulfilling this contract, I really needed to sit d=\r\nown with my customer, Eric.  He didn&#39;t say why he wanted a URI to invoke th=\r\ne function.  What if the rationale to exposing mcal_is_leap_year() is actua=\r\nlly part of an oddball distributed test harness for php?  In that case, it =\r\nmakes perfect sense to expose the function as a resource.  You&#39;d always get=\r\n a 200 if the function is actually available with some sort part of the dat=\r\na in the response indicating true|false.\n&gt; \n&gt; On 05-Aug-2010, at 6:29 AM, J=\r\nan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2010, at 12:16 PM, Eric J.
