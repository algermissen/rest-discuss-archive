Don&#39;t get me wrong, I agree with the finding, due to\nmy understanding of the architecture.  The problem is, if we were to\npoll Web developers we&#39;d find that an overwhelming majority think it&#39;s\nwrong -- due to a lack of understanding of Web architecture.\n\nhttp://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2008/7/5366-web-science/fulltext\n\nTBL raises an interesting point -- Web Design is taught literally\neverywhere; Web architecture and protocols, not so much.  I&#39;m a much\nbetter Web developer for having taken the time to learn the protocols\nand architecture; but it gets exhausting having to explain to folks that\nthey aren&#39;t stupid or dumb, just ignorant, and that&#39;s why their ideas\nare untenable.\n\nParticularly for me -- I&#39;m just not very good at diplomatic politesse,\neven on those (rare) occasions when I do try...  ;-)\n\nMy Uncle studied under Feynman at Cal Tech, and later spent decades\naccrediting University-level Physics courses.  Nowadays, the &quot;Feynman\nLectures on Physics&quot; is the de-facto standard for how introductory\nPhysics is taught (even when some other textbook is used).  What&#39;s\nneeded is something along the lines of &quot;Six Easy Pieces&quot; for inclusion\nin Web Design courses, for a solid grounding in the architectural\nfundamentals of the Web; in an approachable fashion for non-architects,\nas the basis for accreditation requirements.\n\nPerhaps, if Web developers were taught the proper fundamentals of the\narchitecture, there&#39;d be no reason to revisit -14 (along with any\nnumber of other isses I&#39;d thought long-settled).  But I doubt it can\nhappen fast enough to head that off.  As TBL points out, Web evolution\noutpaces the ability to observe it; which makes the fundamentals all\nthe more imperative to keep that evolution from following a crash-and-\nburn path, in the aftermath of which we look back in hindsight and see\nthat it was preventable because the fundamentals were right all along.\n\nAs it stands now, the &quot;throw out HTTP and start over&quot; crowd seems to be\ngaining the upper hand, primarily due to the unpopularity of things\nlike media types, or -14.  This way lies disaster, but what to do about\nit?\n\n-Eric\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics\n\n"}}
