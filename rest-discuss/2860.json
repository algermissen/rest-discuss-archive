Certainly the integration \n&gt; complexity is reduced. But OTOH the effort of reaching agreement on the \n&gt; common interface is increased.\n\nWell, I&#39;m not so sure.  I assume you&#39;re not referring to the\nstandardization portion of the interface, just the decision to use it\nin the first place.\n\nI would say that network effects, one the self-catalyzing point has been\nreached, make it more expensive to not agree than to agree, the same\nway that in 1995/1996, everybody *had* to have a Web site.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d also conjecture that O(N^2) is a wildly pessimistic worst case \n&gt; because in practice not everybody needs to talk to everybody else. You \n&gt; only need O(NlogN) edges in a random graph to get complete \n&gt; connectivity, so O(NlogN) seems like a good guess for the typical, as \n&gt; opposed to the worst, case. FWIW ... not proof, but I&#39;ve seen data from \n&gt; a major (ie. one that hasn&#39;t gone bust yet ;-) B2B exchange which \n&gt; supports this.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; And I also think that multiple interfaces are likely to scale better in \n&gt; the face of growth and change (yup, I realize that this runs completely \n&gt; counter to what _everyone_ else is saying ;-). That&#39;s because changes \n&gt; are liable to be local, hence in the multiple interface case only \n&gt; require local renegotiation and reimplementation; and because new \n&gt; participants only have to reach agreements with the subset of existing \n&gt; participants they actually need to communicate with.\n\nYah, I understand that position, I think.  But I think the Web has shown\nthat these sort of &quot;local islands of closed-worldlyness&quot; are spurious as\nthey succumb to the network effects inherrent in the integration,\nanywhere, anytime approach of the Web.\n\nAs an example of this, I recently wanted to reference a Merriam Webster\ndefinition of a word, but noticed that their primary interface to their\ndictionary was via POST, not GET.  They do have a GET interface, which I\nlater found, but that&#39;s not obvious to people.  So dictionary.com is now\nthe defacto english language dictionary on the Web since its primary\ninterface is GET.  Goodbye M-W.\n\nThat&#39;s not exactly the situation you describe, but I think the basic\nprinciples are the same.\n\nThere&#39;s also the simple maintenance issue that it&#39;s cheaper to update\none interface than two, so if you&#39;ve got a service exposed to the world\nvia HTTP, then you might as well use that even for private agreements.\n\n&gt; OTOH, on the common interface model every change requires global \n&gt; renegotiation and reimplementation; and new particpants either have to \n&gt; get along with what the first-movers already decided on whether or not \n&gt; it&#39;s fully appropriate for them, or alternatively simply not become \n&gt; participants at all (or become participants in something else).\n\nYes, which is why incrementally deployed extensions are an absolutely\nmust.  The Web has no &quot;off&quot; switch.  HTTP, and things like RFC 2774\n(which improved on that), were designed exactly for this.  Waka will\nbe even better, by the looks of it, with built in scoping and\nmandatory extensions, like PEP and SOAP.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
