I think I have a vague sense of what it \n&gt;&gt; is,\n&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at\n&gt;&gt; Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; What it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to \n&gt; monitor\n&gt; or mediate the interaction between two other components. &quot;\n\nWhy it&#39;s important?  Hmm...\n\nThere are several places where it comes into play:\n\n   o efficient intermediaries\n\n     - security across trust boundaries\n\n     Many networks don&#39;t trust each other, or at least don&#39;t trust what\n     is on the other side of a firewall.  As a result, intermediaries are\n     installed to filter traffic.  That is a hard problem for \ngeneral-purpose\n     application protocols, so we need to make it easier in order to make\n     filtering more efficient and gain the trust of firewall admins.\n\n     - extensibility\n\n     Visibility calls for more explicit descriptions within messages, as\n     opposed to relying on external IDLs or XDR-style typing by schema,\n     which in turn makes it easier to extend the functionality later.\n\n     - evolvability\n\n     When intermediaries can understand a request, they can more easily\n     perform or adjust it on behalf of the intended recipient, just as\n     WebTV or cell phone networks can adjust for their clients.\n\n     - performance\n\n     Visibility is necessary for cacheability.\n\n   o understandability\n\n     It is simply easier to build complex systems if you can see and\n     understand the individual interactions.\n\n   o reusability\n\n     People learn by emulation.  That is described somewhat in the \nsection\n     on Java versus Javascript.\n\nThere are probably others.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
