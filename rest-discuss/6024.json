You can&#39;t  \n&gt; send the message persistently so that you know that the send being  \n&gt; ack&#39;d means something.\n&gt; Most messaging systems I&#39;ve worked with that provide reliable or  \n&gt; guaranteed delivery have APIs that look suspiciously like &quot;post&quot;,  \n&gt; and the API is a blocking call - quick, but still blocking.\n\nI think this mixes two things: When a messaging system is used, a  \n&quot;post&quot; to some queue usually means that the message has been enqueued  \nlocally and there&#39;s a guarantee that it will be delivered. The  \n&quot;postmessage()&quot; API is sort of a programming-language level contract  \nbetween the application and the middleware implementation.\n\nWhile you can do an HTTP POST without expecting or relying on a  \nbusiness level reply through a similar API, it will only succeed if  \nyou are connected to the HTTP server on the other side.\n\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n  \n   \n\n\n\n"}}
