Reading those specs correctly is so tricky...\n\n&gt; Perhaps a cut-down \n&gt; form of the blueprint would be more appropriate than one that \n&gt; exposes internal classes and the like.\n\nThat&#39;s what I was enivisoning since they are so closely related.\n\n&gt; On the whole the framework doesn&#39;t look particularly RESTful \n&gt; or non-RESTful. It would be up to a particular blueprint and \n&gt; implementation to conform or not conform to REST principles. \n&gt; If it is designed for interaction with HTTP and allows \n&gt; appropriate access to HTTP headers I don&#39;t see any obvious \n&gt; problems on the surface.\n\nI&#39;m curious; could RESTfulness be more strongly enforced by the framework?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
