It is not.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Some people believe that it is within the bounds of the spec for PUT\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;/robots.txt to merge the new content with the old content.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I do not so believe, but the APP working group (or at least an \n&gt;&gt; apparent\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;majority of their members) do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; /me nods\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;From the subthread discussion with Nick, I think that I understand now\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the basis used to assert that HTTP permits this interpretation of PUT.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What I don&#39;t understand is why it might be considered a good idea to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; apply make PUT ambiguous in that way. Where&#39;s the advantage, I ask\n&gt;&gt; &gt; myself? Why go to all that trouble when you already have an ambiguous\n&gt;&gt; &gt; method, POST, sitting there ready to do your bidding as you see fit...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One reason is that you&#39;re already using POST to mean &quot;add a\n&gt;&gt; sub-resource&quot;; also using it to mean &quot;apply a delta&quot; means that you need\n&gt;&gt; to switch on the MIME type to determine the basic semantics.  And also\n&gt;&gt; you can&#39;t store a delta document as a sub-resource :).\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The action performed by the POST method might not result in a\n&gt; resource that can be identified by a URI.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5\n&gt;\n&gt; The resource|representation semantics of POST are so ambiguous that I\n&gt; sometimes wonder if the name should have been MISC\nRight.  I was thinking specifically about the AtomPub profile of HTTP, \nin which POST on certain URIs has specific semantics; a POST to \nsomething defined as a &quot;collection URI&quot; is supposed to create a new \nsub-resource with its own URI.  However the &quot;collection URI&quot; may also \nrespond to GET with a collection of all the sub-resources in feed \nformat.  PUT isn&#39;t defined for it by AtomPub but if it were defined it \nwould be natural to allow a PUT of an entire collection to replace them \nall at once (for example to ensure consistency). \n\nBut then if you wanted to do a &quot;delta update&quot; of just a subset of the \ncollection with one operation, POST is already spoken for.  You could of \ncourse do a delta update if the MIME type is X and add a sub-resource if \nMIME type is Y.  (AtomPub allows POSTing of arbitrary resource types to \ncreate sub-resources.)\n\n\n\n"}}
