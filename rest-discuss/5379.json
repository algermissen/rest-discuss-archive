I also agree that it is important to not  \nmix the document content (including query strings) with the URI proper.\n\nHowever, at the same time, my understanding is that REST was designed  \nto represent the way the (normal) web already works today.  And the  \nfact of the matter is that there&#39;s *lots* of websites that support  \nthe equivalent of PUT and DELETE operations without actually using  \nthem.  While its nice to think this problem might be solved by new  \nbrowsers, that&#39;s not really a viable option in the short term.\n\nOne option -- which Dimitri is pushing -- is that we simply disallow  \nthose operations.  That is:\n\n* we don&#39;t PUT complete objects; we POST a request asking for an  \nobject to be created/updated (with appropriate versions)\n\n* we don&#39;t DELETE objects; we POST an update to that object flagging  \nit for removal/hiding\n\nI actually like this approach, as I think it does map onto many  \ncurrent application models -- as well as being implemented with  \ncurrent browsers -- and respects the original intent of REST.  I  \nwould certainly encourage people to adopt that approach wherever  \npossible.\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t think it is possible to say *never* do those  \nthing.   In fact, people do them all the time on the web today, and  \nwe&#39;ll never get most of them to move those apps over to RESTful  \nversions if they have to give up important functionality.  And -- at  \nleast if you care about converging REST with the normal web -- i.e.,  \nmaking existing web apps behave in a more RESTful fashion-- we have  \nto do *something*. If so, what is the least obnoxious thing that can  \nbe done?\n\nMy current best guess is that we should define a standard suffix for  \n&quot;decorating&quot; URIs to indicate non-traditional behaviors. My favorite  \ncandidate for the delimeter is &quot;@&quot;, since it is rare to find in HTTP  \nURLs, but easily encoded, a la:\n\nhttp://host/root/uri/%40PUT\n\tusing mime/multipart\nhttp://host/root/uri/%40DELETE\n\twith no body\n\nIs this ugly? Absolutely.  But I honestly can&#39;t think of an easier-to- \nimplement solution that is at least comprehensible, and doesn&#39;t  \nrequire people to give up major portions of their existing technology.\n\nHaving already committed one heresy, let me go a step further. :-)\n\nI know that a URI is intended to be one very specific object, and  \nthat additional processing is supposed to be done by the client.    \nBut in practice, we often want to provide standard variants of a  \ngiven document.  Rather than again overloading that onto the query  \nstring, I think this might be another appropriate use of the &quot;URI  \nsuffix.&quot;\n\nhttp://host/root/uri/%40list\nhttp://host/root/uri/%40table\nhttp://host/root/uri/%40ajax\n\nIs this REST?  No, I&#39;ll admit it is not.  However, I&#39;m trying to be  \nas RESTful as I can given the problem I need to solve.   Is there a  \nbetter way?\n\n-- Ernie P.\n------------\nErnest N.
