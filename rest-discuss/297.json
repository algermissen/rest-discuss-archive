None of the\nintermediaries can reach the endpoint so they just\nping away until they get a connection.  Once they\nget a connection, there is no reason to assume\nthat the server recieve the messages in any\nparticular order.\n\nNote, there is also no mechanism to feedback error\nmessages if delivery fails.  You are so into\nstatus notification, w/r/t terrorist_or_not.com.\nYou seem not to care about delivery failure here.\nSMTP takes care of delivery failure.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
