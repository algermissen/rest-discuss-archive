The latter would map to HTTP POST with a header\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (mandatory, due to deployment issues) declaring that the expected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; role/type of the resource identified by the Request-URI, is that of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; book order processor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But Amazon does not include such a mandatory header in\n&gt; &gt; their POST. Are you saying that Amazon&#39;s service is not RESTful?\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t be suprised. Amazon isn&#39;t that religious (or even particularly\n&gt; well informed) about REST. I&#39;ve only met two or three people that\n&gt; understand - much less care deeply - about REST. I have met people that\n&gt; quickly recognize the value when I explain the basics, though. \n\nI don&#39;t find that particularly surprising Mike.\nFollowing this most recent thread makes grabbing eels look easy.\n\nThere are enough smart people supporting the rest position to make\nit worth exploring, but the &#39;dummies guide&#39; articles are pretty \nthin on the ground?
