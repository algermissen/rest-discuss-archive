Is that it?\n\nHmm, no.  By &quot;message&quot;, I mean the entire HTTP message; request line,\nheaders, and body.\n\nThink about taking an HTTP message, and storing it to disk for 20\nyears.  When you &quot;reconstitute&quot; it at that time, will people still\nknow what it means?  If it used cookies, they won&#39;t, because some\ninformation necessary to understanding it was on the server, and it\nexpired years ago.\n\nCompare it to FTP, if that helps.  If I pickle the (logical) command\n&quot;RETR foo.zip&quot; to disk, and reconstitute it 10 minutes later, nobody\nwill know what it means because they don&#39;t know what the current\ndirectory is, and hence which foo.zip to retrieve.  FTP is a stateful\nprotocol.\n\n&gt; Sorry to be so dense on this.  However, I feel that it is a critical\n&gt; issue that I want to make certain I fully understand as I go out into\n&gt; the world to preach the merits of REST.  /Roger\n\nIt&#39;s definitely a critical issue, as statelessness is so key to\nvisibility and reliability.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
