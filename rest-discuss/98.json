Do you mean that you&#39;re running\nthe URL encoding algorithm over the XML? Or that the XML is an\napproximation of something that really uses ampersands and semicolons?\n\nThe stocks example is not clear on how the service decides when to send\nnotifications. I think something more compelling would be to send a\nnotification when the stock passes a floor or ceiling.\n\nIs there a way to put some prose on each example describing the\napplication?\n\nAt the bottom of the first page of &quot;Store and Forward&quot; you&#39;ve got the\nResponder responding to the Requester. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got a\nconnection to each other, so I think that&#39;s a typo. It should be\nresponding to the Email Service thingee. That&#39;s about where I get lost\nin that whole example. Why do we need store and forward for this\napplication? Here&#39;s where I would use store and forward. My laptop is\ngoing to be off the network so I ask a web service to contact me via a\nstore and forward web service instead of directly. \n\nBut you have the requester (e.g. my laptop) contacting the responder\nthrough a store and forward service. \n\nAs a graphical thing, is it possible to have the thing closest to the\nrequester (end-user) always on the left hand side and the thing closest\nto the real service always on the right?\n\nAnd maybe it would be cool if you could add a &quot;time passes&quot; bubble to\ndifferentiate the asynch parts from the sync parts.\n\nA fundamental part of this is the mail-&gt;HTTP gateway. The important\nthing is that the mail software does the queuing, retry etc. But if the\nHTTP target of the message is offline is there a way for the &quot;Email\nservice&quot; to let the MTA know that it has failed to deliver? I guess I\ndon&#39;t know whether the &quot;email service&quot; is a separate process working\nthrough mail protocols or a milter or a thing pointed to from the\n.forward or ... Whatever it is, it needs to be able to translate HTTP\nfailures into mail delivery failures.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
