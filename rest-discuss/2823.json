Just like Connection.\n\nI replied, quoting from rfc 2068:\n&gt; So, am I misreading the rfc: &quot;Field-names listed in Vary headers are those\n&gt; of request-headers.&quot;.  (Sect 14.3)\n\nAnd Mark responded:\n&gt; Sorry, I meant any *request* header.  But it can be any extension\n&gt; header too, not just those in the HTTP spec, which is what I thought\n&gt; you were talking about.\n\nFinally:\n* yes, I was talking about extension headers. Those seem like a natural\nplace to put authentication credentials if you&#39;re using some non-standard\nscheme\n* I was interpreting &quot;request-headers&quot; as referring specifically to the set\nof headers defined in the production for request-header in Sect 5.3. It\nseems like Mark is saying &quot;request-headers&quot; should mean any header in the\nrequest message? BTW, I&#39;d like this better, cause then you could Vary on\nextension headers. But, then I&#39;d expect the rfc to say something like &quot;any\nrequest header&quot;.\n\nBut, practically, what&#39;s the impact of this? Is an intermediary justified in\nrejecting a response message if it has illegal headers in it? E.g., could a\nfirewall fail to pass thru a response containing a &quot;Vary: foobar&quot; header\n(where foobar is some extension header from the request)? Or could a cache\nignore the unrecognized Vary header fields and return the wrong page to a\nsubsequent request? (Of course, a broken firewall or cache could do anything\n... I&#39;m talking about &quot;correct per the rfc&quot; behavior.)\n\n-Lee\n\n\n\n"}}
