The matter is IMHO because REST isn&#39;t &quot;widely\naccepted&quot;.\n\nLet me elaborate my previous statement... one of the reasons why people\nprefer REST than XML RPC, CORBA, XML Web Services, etc. is because they\nusually don&#39;t need any special library other than just the ability to\n&quot;GET&quot; something (or post something, but this requires more work). In PHP\nit&#39;s very easy:\n\n$contents = file_get_contents(&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;);\n\nThat one line of code will give you the contents of the Google homepage.\nIt is similarly trivial to add a query string, etc. And it&#39;s not that hard\nto URL-encode strings yourself if the underlying library does not provide\nyou with one.\n\nUsing SOAP/Web Services mean that you&#39;ll need a full blown library to be\nable to use it, even for a mere calling one function which returns a\nnumber. In PHP this was a big problem, a library called NuSoap supposed to\n&quot;solve&quot; the problem but its usage was far from trivial.\n\nOne may argue that REST is also successful because it doesn&#39;t try to\nleverage the local programming model into the distributed nature of the\nInternet. I agree with that.\n\nI will have to add that REST is usually much simpler to implement than\nmost of other RPC solutions.\n\nBut why SHARE?\n\nOne thing is because of accessibility. REST is a bit too &quot;strict&quot; for me.\nRESTful services need to treat URLs as resources, and not &quot;remote\nprocedures&quot;. And resources have associated operations, such as GET, PUT,\nPOST, etc. that can be used to manipulate the resources, etc. There&#39;s\nnothing wrong with that.\n\nIn my view, however, handling other than GET/POST (even just HEAD) is not\nalways easy to do, both for the server and for the client. The server\nneeds to be specially configured in order to handle other than GET, POST,\nHEAD, on scripts. And for the client... well even Firefox doesn&#39;t let me\ninput &quot;OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1&quot; to some arbitrary host. If all else fails\ntelnet would be the way to go, but really it&#39;s not that convenient.\n\nFrom the programmatic side, writing a RESTful client is also not so\ntrivial. For other than GET method (even just POST), in PHP you&#39;ll need a\nspecial library such as CURL (this is also available for Perl, etc.). For\nmore exotic languages you may be out of luck and have to use TCP/IP\nsockets directly... really not the way to do it.\n\nSo here&#39;s my take on SHARE:\n- The &quot;official&quot; expansion would be &quot;Simple HTTP API via RPC and Encoded\ndata&quot;. An &quot;empathic&quot; definition would be &quot;Simple HTTP API almost like REST\nbut Easier&quot;. My definition would be &quot;Simple HTTP API that&#39;s Really Easy&quot;.\n- Supports GET, POST, HEAD only. The recommended method is only GET\nthough, for accessibility: You can&#39;t do a POST using a web browser without\nusing forms, and you can&#39;t do a POST using a script without using special\nlibraries, client-side JavaScript such as using XMLHTTP did not support\nPOST until later versions.\n- Has a SHARE Description (SHARED) which basically looks like RSDL I\nproposed before.\n- Has a SHARE interface description which is written in WSDL, I suppose...\nbut I&#39;ll think about it later. It&#39;s just too early.\n- SHARE isn&#39;t REST. It was trying to be REST but since it&#39;s not accepted\nas REST it has to stand on its own knee. ;-)\n- It&#39;ll have a homepage on http://dev.gauldong.net pretty soon :-D\n\nComments are appreciated.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
