I guess it is something like \nhttp://www.kevin.com/display-item.jsp?id=1234. Right? I also guess your REST \nAPI URL is something like http://rest.kevin.com/items/1234. Right?\n\nNow how do you get from the first URL to the second URL? You grap &quot;id=1234&quot; \nfrom the website URL and paste &quot;1234&quot; into the REST API URL template. This \nmeans you have apriori knowledge of your REST API.\n\nOkay, this in itself is not such a big problem. You are just utilizing a \nprepublished official bookmark/template URL.\n\nBut what if your item contains links to other items? or to purchase orders \nfor that item? or to users that bought that item? You know, &quot;hypermedia as \nan engine of application state&quot;. The &quot;orders&quot; REST URLs could look like \nhttp://rest.kevin.com/orders/5678 or \nhttp://rest.kevin.com/items/1234/orders/5678 - it could even be links to \norders placed on amazon.com! The point is, you do not know the URL format. \nYou can only follow the link and grab the resource found at the endpoint.\n\nNow, on http://www.kevin.com/display-item.jsp?id=1234 we want to have nice \nHTML links to the orders placed on the item. We also want to display the \norder information inside www.kevin.com. What are the URLs for these links? \nYou cannot just link to the REST URLs since these do not return HTML, so \nlinking to http://rest.kevin.com/items/1234/orders/5678 or \nhttp://rest.amazon.com/orders/6554 is not an option.\n\nThe only solution I see is to include the complete REST order URL in the web \nURL, and thus we end up with:\n\n   http://www.kevin.com/display-item-orders?order=http%3a%2f%2frest.amazon.com%2forders%2f6554\n\nHopefully this explain why I insist on passing complete URLs around - while \nat the same time I really don&#39;t like it because of the ugly URLs.\n\n/J�rn\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Kevin Duffey&quot; &lt;andjarnic@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jorn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 04, 2010 5:44 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Thoughts about URLs for a REST driven website\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve read the thread you guys got going on. I guess I am not understanding \n&gt; what the problem is. I&#39;ve utilized REST as a sort of MVC for my web site \n&gt; as well. I look at it this way, the REST API that is available beyond the \n&gt; web to anyone who wants to consume it, ALSO allows me to build my own web \n&gt; UI around it. I do this in one of two ways. One is to have a separate \n&gt; &quot;view&quot; tier web front end. I do this with a simple struts/mvc style web \n&gt; app with JSPs for the view of the web site. When a user clicks on a link \n&gt; that is handled by an action, in that action code I make the REST call to \n&gt; the API, and do all the work inside of the action as needed. The other way \n&gt; I might do it, is to deploy the API within my own UI web app archive. When \n&gt; I do this, I utilize prototype to make ajax calls directly to the REST \n&gt; api, specifying headers, method type, etc as needed. It really depends on \n&gt; which way you want to deploy your API and your front end UI.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a little confused on why end users must have some \n&gt; www.mysite.com/peter as their URL? That seems to me that you&#39;re passing \n&gt; the REST API uris up to the end user of your UI. I don&#39;t quite understand \n&gt; why that is needed or wanted. I don&#39;t imagine anyone else using your API \n&gt; from anothter site, or say desktop or mobile client, would somehow use \n&gt; your API URIs within their UI representation of your API. Is there some \n&gt; reason you must incorporate the REST URIs into the front end UI your users \n&gt; would use?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
