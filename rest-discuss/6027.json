Conversational state is [what we knew you&#39;d say]\n\nIn fairness, I have to admit I knew you&#39;d say this. I just wanted you to \nso that I could point out why it&#39;s not really distinct from what you \ndubbed &#39;persistent state&#39;.\n\nCan you see that you are speaking purely in terms of an implementation? \nYou *happen* to have two databases. You call one of them &#39;The Database&#39;, \nand you call the other... well, I&#39;m not sure exactly what you called it, \nbut let&#39;s say it&#39;s called the &#39;state server&#39;.\n\nThe point is that your decision to use one backing store or another is \npurely incidental. You still persist state on the &#39;back side&#39; of your \nweb application&#39;s public interface. From the web&#39;s point of view this is \nentirely transparent.\n\nI don&#39;t think there is really any distinction to be made between \n&#39;conversational state&#39; and &#39;persistent state&#39; from an architectural \npoint of view. Although I concede that the &#39;temporal&#39; and &#39;incidental&#39; \nnature of such state usually makes if of little interest to the \nbusiness, thus not a candidate for inclusion in The Database. (That \nsaid, &#39;Sessions&#39; are first class business concepts in my applications \nfor auditing purposes; they definitely go in The Database.)\n\nI&#39;d add that the labels you&#39;ve elected to use are not as good as \n&#39;transient state&#39; and &#39;business state&#39; respectively. Although the label \nisn&#39;t so important as the intent. &#39;Business state&#39; is often of a \ntransient, conversational nature too, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s &#39;conversation&#39; \nwhich is considered &#39;core business&#39;.\n\nI hope you can see that the single capability of &#39;session token&#39; would \ngive you all the capability you need to key &#39;conversational state&#39;, and \nspecifically I hope you agree that whether you call it a &#39;shopping \nbasket&#39; or a &#39;session&#39; it&#39;s still the same thing (only the label varied, \nnot the pattern). Although, I&#39;m sure you already know this.\n\nYou have been running the argument that putting session context (which \nby your volition is &#39;conversational&#39;, or &#39;transient&#39;) in the URL is a \ngood idea, although I don&#39;t believe that you have yet pleaded a case for \n*why* it&#39;s a good idea.\n\nIn my view, all things which can be derived from the &#39;subject&#39;, \nespecially (though not exclusively) when they are only &#39;conversational&#39;, \n&#39;incidental&#39;, or &#39;transient&#39; from the application&#39;s perspective should \nbe left out of the URL. This makes for &#39;safer&#39; URLs with longer term \nrelevance. That is, URLs which more adequately describe the &#39;object&#39; of \na request (assuming the &#39;subject&#39; is taken to be &#39;session&#39;).\n\nThanks for having the chat. It was good to have the opportunity to try \nand put into words things which have been in my mind for some time now. \nI always find I learn something when I write things down.\n\nRegards,\nJohn Elliot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
