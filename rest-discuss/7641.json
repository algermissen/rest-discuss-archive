If someone were to use this from a public  \nterminal and not clear the history, then the next person along could  \nget the credit card number by looking at the history. Thus I&#39;d lean  \ntowards some other approach, such as POST the credit card number, and  \nredirect to a GET that includes a different &quot;surrogate&quot; number, not  \nthe credit card number, that on the server is mapped to the credit  \ncard account. The user would need to authenticate to be able to see  \nthat page, so even though that surrogate number would be visible in  \nthe browser cache, someone else who came along wouldn&#39;t be able to  \naccess it unless the previous fellow forgot to log out.
