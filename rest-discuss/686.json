I&#39;m not 100% convinced its correct to view the\n&gt; &gt; notification request behavior as a side-effect.  It doesn&#39;t actually impact\n&gt; &gt; the content returned beyond adding a header and *later* producing an effect\n&gt; &gt; that wouldn&#39;t exist otherwise;\n&gt;\n&gt; The server needs to change state to remember the request. That sounds\n&gt; like a side-effect to me.\n\nSure, sure, but there&#39;s side effects and then there&#39;s side effects.  I.e., on some\nstrictly literal level it&#39;s wrong to call even GET &quot;idempotent&quot; since resources\nare actually time-varying streams of different, mutable representations, and GET\ncan indeed (as with counters, etc.) have some kinds of effects.\n\nThink of the subscription in sort of the same sense as incrementing a page hit\ncounter.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
