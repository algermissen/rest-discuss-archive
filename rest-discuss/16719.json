That using generic containers, you\n&gt; may only be able to get domain knowledge through introspection, yet\n&gt; introspection is considered a bad practice, that&#39;s one reason cited\n&gt; why application/xml is not a proper media type to use.\n&gt; \n\nIntrospection to determine sender intent is bad practice -- sender\nintent should be declared by media type.  Semantics of the payload are\nnot.  The media type needs to tell me what kind of processor to use, in\norder to understand the semantics of the payload.  These semantics\ncan&#39;t be understood unless the payload can first be decoded.  But they\nhave no bearing on the sender&#39;s intended processing model.\n\nThere are about a bazillion different uses for HTML, from campaign\ndonations, to banking, to airline reservations, to etc. etc. etc. and\nso on and so forth, all of which share the same processing model.\nDetermining the semantics of the payload is a separate problem -- first\nyou need to know how to decode the payload, and that sender intent is\nwhat a media type is self-descriptive of.\n\nIn many cases, the data type is XHTML 1.0, which may be sent as\ntext/html or as application/xhtml+xml.  If the rules are followed, the\nsemantics of the payload are exactly the same either way, because they\nhave nothing to do with the processing model being HTML vs. XML.  You\ncan use RDFa to annotate any standard element with domain-specific\nvocabulary.  Or microformats, or microdata, or linked RDF, or whatever\nelse comes along -- using any of which has no bearing on media type.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
