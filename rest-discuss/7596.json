There&#39;s no need to have\n&gt;  &gt; your site walk reflected in the breadcrumb,\n&gt; \n&gt; I respectfully state that that is a matter of opinion. Like Jakob Neilsen, I\n&gt; believe that URL is UI[1] and if the URL doesn&#39;t reflect the site structure\n&gt; then they are not &quot;hackable&quot; in the same way and hence not as good of UI.\n\nI don&#39;t disagree with either of those statements, but I don&#39;t understand \n  what your point is either. Countering what I think about good UI \ndesign  for breadcrumbs with what you think is good UI design for URLs \ndoesn&#39;t make sense (to me) since breadcrumbs aren&#39;t URIs and don&#39;t \nnecessarily depend on the URIs construction.\n\nAnyway, the point I&#39;m trying to make is this - there&#39;s no reason to \ndynamically generate the breadcrumb trail based on on the user&#39;s walk \nthrough the site. The follow on point is that URL design need have \nnothing to do with page breadcrumbs. Finally, as an aside, it&#39;s easier \nto arrange caching for pages with &#39;static&#39; breadcrumbs. Everybody wins.\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; there is something to be said for &#39;static&#39; breadcrumbs\n&gt;  &gt; that indicate the site&#39;s IA. This is more important today,\n&gt;  &gt; as many people are dropped straight into a site via a\n&gt;  &gt; search engine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Site&#39;s IA?\n\nInformation Architecture.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
