If atom is also unknown, maybe he is inter=\r\nessted, that it=B4s a valid xml document, too.\n\nThis seems to be just an co=\r\nnvention at the moment or standarized only for xml-based documents [3]. Fur=\r\nthermore, it would imho calm down the debate about generic vs specific medi=\r\na type.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-di=\r\nscuss/message/17665\n[2] http://www.odata.org/developers/protocols/atom-form=\r\nat\n[3] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n\n\n"}}
