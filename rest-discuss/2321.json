The root url will be : http://my.server.com/root\n I think there is some points to consider:\n    * What this url should return: some information about the resource, or a\nlisting of its contents (groups). If a listing is allowed, this raise the\nrecursive issue. Is recursively restful. I thought about these solutions:\n            1.  &lt;root&gt;\n                    some information\n                    &lt;group1 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/group.1&quot; /&gt;\n                    &lt;group2 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/group.2&quot; /&gt;\n                    ...\n                &lt;/root&gt;\n\n            2.a &lt;root&gt;\n                    &lt;group1&gt;\n                        &lt;attribute1a&gt;value&lt;/attribute1a&gt;\n                        &lt;element11 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/element.1.1&quot;/&gt;\n                        ...\n                    &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n                    ...\n                &lt;/root&gt;\n            2.b &lt;root&gt;\n                    &lt;group1 attribute1a=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\n                        &lt;element11 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/element.1.1&quot;/&gt;\n                        ...\n                    &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n                    ...\n                &lt;/root&gt;\n\n            3   &lt;root&gt;\n                    &lt;group1&gt;\n                        &lt;attribute1a&gt;value&lt;/attribute1a&gt;\n                        &lt;element11&gt;\n                            &lt;attribute11a&gt;value&lt;/attribute11a&gt;\n                        &lt;/element11&gt;\n                        ...\n                    &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n                    ...\n                &lt;/root&gt;\n\n    Note that they could be 3.b with attribute values as ``real&quot; xml\nattributes, but this difference (between 2.a and 2.b is an other debate). I\nthink the first solution is the more restful one. But I&#39;d like to be able to\nsave the resources for a local access, and to avoid to have to save\nmultiples files, making links relatives, etc. This explain the 3rd solution\n(the 2nd one is just un hybrid, which is not very useful :) The question is:\nis it correct to make the 3rd solution available at\nhttp://my.server.com/root?recursive=true or\nhttp://my.server.com/root?recursive=2 where recursive=0 is the 1rst solution\nand recursive=1 the second one.\n\n    * The other issue is: what should be the url to groups and elements (and\npossibly attributes).\n        1. http://my.server.com/root/group1/element11\n        2. http://my.server.com/root?group=1&element=11\n        3. without the hierarchy http://my.server.com/root?attribute=11a\ndirectly\n\n    and is an hybrid solution possible (e.g\nhttp://my.server.com/root/group1?element=11, or\nhttp://my.server.com/root/group1/element11?attribute=11a)\n\n    I think that the path form (1) is better for access, since the query one\n(3) is better for search queries.\n\n    To be more concrete, suppose that groups are contacts &#39;groups (which\nattribute is a description), elements are contacts and attributes are mail\naddress, phone number, name and description. The goal is to allow the access\nto coordinates, groups or contacts (e.g a ldap gateway) and to save them to\na single file (see first point) to local access.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
