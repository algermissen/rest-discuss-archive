So,\nwhat I&#39;m about to\nask may have been discussed here before, but please,\nbear with me :-)\n\nLet&#39;s assume that we have a following situation:\n(I&#39;ll write the key terms CAPITALIZED for better\nvisibility, I&#39;m not\nyelling :-) )\n\nThere is a RESTful APPLICATION available on the web\nand a client is\nusing it (human client through web browser, to be\nprecise).\nClient has loaded the home page and therefore client\ncan see the\nREPRESENTATION of the CURRENT STATE of APPLICATION.\nClient can initiate TRANSITION (by means of selecting\none of HYPERMEDIA\nLINKS contained within the REPRESENTATION of the\ncurrent state) of the APPLICATION to another STATE.\nLINK contains (is?)\nURI which identifies one of application&#39;s RESOURCES.\nBy means of that URI and selected OPERATION derived\nfrom UNIFORM\nINTERFACE (GET, PUT, ...) that RESOURCE is being\nmanipulated with, meaning that ANY number of ACTIONS\nare being initiated\n&quot;behind the scenes&quot; on server. Those ACTIONS\nwill bring APPLICATION to NEW STATE and our client\nwill receive the\nREPRESENTATION of some RESOURCE which describes that\nNEW (but now CURRENT) STATE of APPLICATION.\nAnd on we go again, based on new links in that new\nrepresentation.\n\n\nWell, am I getting it right?\n\n\nCheers,\n    Miran\n\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Get the free Yahoo! toolbar and rest assured with the added security of spyware protection.\nhttp://new.toolbar.yahoo.com/toolbar/features/norton/index.php\n\n\n"}}
