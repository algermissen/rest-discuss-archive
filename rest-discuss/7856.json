The question is are the REST community (us) and \nsoftware designers who are prepared to work under the REST style &quot;ready \nfor success&quot;? I&#39;d say no.\n\nif you look at what Fowler has said about OO, that lots of strange \nthings were done in its name, I think will happen around REST. It&#39;s part \nof being adopted. Then again, if it came down to it, good luck \npersuading anyone you know more about OO than him.\n\n\n&gt; it is slightly dangerous to talk about RESTfull toolkits and REST\n&gt; support. I am quite happy for people to say &quot;this one thing is more\n&gt; RESTfull than this other thing&quot;. As long as it is of course.\n\n&quot;Where are the REST toolkits&quot; is one of my favorite quotes of the last \nfew years, partially because it&#39;s so right and so wrong. Perhaps it is \nthe wrong way to think about things, but you could *never* persuade me \nthat there is adequate technical support for building in the REST style \ntoday. Most frameworks are RPC/Gateway driven which results in bad hard \nto maintain web software - you develop in the REST style on most popular \nframeworks and you&#39;ll ship late. That&#39;s without even getting into arcana \nlike rolling your own etags and figuring out where to leave them.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
