Quite a few malware and porn  \nsites have subverted this principle, using inoffensive and unrelated  \nkeywords in URLs to conceal more sinister content, or simply as  \npractical jokes, e.g.\n\n   http://www2.b3ta.com/top-10-cutest-kittens/  (not work safe)\n\nThe real question here is, do you exploit this mechanism, thereby  \nincreasing users&#39; exposure to &quot;readable&quot; URLs and their expectation  \nthat the URL should somehow summarise its content (and therefore their  \nvulnerability to subversion of that expectation), or do you just make  \narbitrary URLs in the ivory tower conceit that &quot;the specification says  \nthat there is no correlation between the form of the URL and its  \ncontent&quot;, which risks firstly alienating users, and secondly them  \nattributing some other, unintended semantics.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n\n"}}
