From my understanding of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these fields, the client is effectively telling the server how to act.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m somewhat inclined to agree with some of this;  If-Mod* and If-Unmod*\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; probably okay because they are describing what they  want in terms\n&gt; &gt; independent of some representation, but the rest presuppose some\n&gt; particular\n&gt; &gt; representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to disagree with this.  Those headers are only cache control hints.\n&gt; They specify ETag values that are compared against the ETag values that\nhad\n&gt; been supplied by the server to represent a version of whatever underlying\n&gt; entity is referenced by the URL.  They aren&#39;t referencing any underlying\n&gt; data in the reponse body (i.e., representation) itself, so the don&#39;t\n&gt; presuppose any representation.\n&gt;\n\nI also disagree - the ETag based headers seem to be defined on resources,\nnot representations.\n\n"}}
