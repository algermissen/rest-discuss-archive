This is\n&gt;: the case for what is commonly referred to as &#39;static content&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hold it.  You&#39;re calling an URI a resource above.  That&#39;s going to\n&gt;cause confusion.  Are you saying that the first URI identifies two\n&gt;resources, namely the one that it identifies directly, and also the one\n&gt;that can be identified directly by the second URI?  First let me get\n&gt;that part straight.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nArrrggg.  I did not call a URI a resource.  I identified a resource by \nusing its name.\nI refuse to go around talking about resources as &#39;the resource \nidentified by http://...&#39;.  It&#39;s a resource and it has a name - when I \ntalk about it, I&#39;ll use its name.  Do you refer to other people as &#39;the \nhuman identified by Fred&#39;, or do you just say Fred.\n\n(Yes, I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;m tired of having to argure the whole way back \nto first principles every time a statement is made.  Sometimes I think \nsome wicked grammar school teacher has exacted her revenge by having \ntaught me an alternate version of the English language - one that seems \nsimilar on the surface, but is different enough to cause me problems any \ntime I try to convey ideas to someone else.  Either that, or I&#39;m some \nkind of strange Italian who can&#39;t communicate without using a whiteboard.)\n\n&gt;If that&#39;s your claim, then I&#39;ll now need to know more about what\n&gt;the phrase &quot;used to produce a representation of&quot; really means.  Do\n&gt;you  mean they share a representation?  Do you mean something\n&gt;which occurs in the server implementation that cannot be observed\n&gt;on the network?  Are you sure this is any form of identification at\n&gt;all, let alone &quot;indirect identification&quot;?  I have no idea, as the phrase\n&gt;&quot;indirect identification&quot; is new to me.\n&gt;\n\nWhen a representation is produced (in order to satisfy a GET, for \ninstance), the bits that comprise it are either dynamically calculated \nat the time the request is made, or retrieved from some other resource(s).\nIn the cases where those bits are retrieved from some other resource, I \nclaim that those other resources are indirectly indentified.\n\nNow perhaps I&#39;ve twisted the definition of &#39;indirect&#39;, but I don&#39;t think \nso.\n\nIf I identify a group of people as &#39;White males&#39;, do I not also also \nindirectly indentify myself by virtue of belonging to that group.\n\n\n&gt;:\n&gt;: Or\n&gt;: Directly identified resource:  http://example.com/pictures/picture1\n&gt;: Indirectly identified resources: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.jpg,\n&gt;:   file://docroot/story/images/picture1.png,\n&gt;: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.gif\n&gt;: where content negotation on the directly identified resource results in\n&gt;: the use of the representation of one of the indirectly identified\n&gt;: resources as the representation of the directly identified resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t really seem any different, except that you&#39;ve introduced\n&gt;content negotiation.  Are you implying that all content negotiation\n&gt;scenarios involve the &quot;indirect identification&quot; phenomenon?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI didn&#39;t intend to imply that its true for ALL content negotiation \n(although it might very well be).  I just saw content negotiation for \nstatic content as a way to illustrate how directly identifiying one \nresource MIGHT result in the indirect identification of other resources.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m concerned  about the quality of the terminology, especially the\n&gt;term &quot;indirect&quot;.  To me, it doesn&#39;t mean indeterminate; it just means\n&gt;that the identification is multi-stage.  In\n&gt;this setting, that implies identifier that points to identifier that\n&gt;points...\n&gt;until something other than a pointer results.\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t understand why you think it means indeterminate.  It&#39;s no more \nindeterminate than the relationship between a resource and its \nrepresentations over time.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;If the phenomenon is something other than that, I&#39;ll bet a better\n&gt;terminology can be found.  Like &quot;selection via association&quot; maybe.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI dont understand what &quot;selection via association&quot; means.\n\nIn my mind, indirect indentification is, in part, a result of resource \ncomposition - resources can be composed of other resources.\n \n--Chuck\n\nPS.  Have you ever had the experience where you&#39;ve said a word over and \nover so many times that it eventually begins to sound like gibberish.  \nWell, when I pronounce the sequence of letters  i-d-e-n-t-i-f-i-e-d, I \nhear only noise.\n\n\n\n"}}
