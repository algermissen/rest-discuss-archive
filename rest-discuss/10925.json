By definition, cookies are\n&gt; a mechanism for associating requests with a session maintained\n&gt; on an origin server.\n\nNo, they are a mechanism for asking the client to send some piece\nof information along with every request it will make to some part\nof a URI space within some timeframe.\n\nThat information need not address a session on the server at all,\nas I showed in my example of using cookies, a server secret and\nHMAC digest to use cookies as a substitute for HTTP Auth.\n\nNote that this in fact requires the server to keep less state\nthan some HTTP Auth methods such as Digest.\n\n&gt; Maybe my premise is wrong and cookies are not a mechanism for\n&gt; associating requests with a session maintained on an origin\n&gt; server. Maybe cookies pass arbitrary information from origin\n&gt; server to user agent and back. If that is so, then the use of\n&gt; cookies still violates the constraint of self-descriptive\n&gt; messages, because cookies are not self-descriptive at all.\n\nSo cookies violate they constraint because they violate the\nconstraint? You have begged the question but not actually given\nany reason for your claim.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
