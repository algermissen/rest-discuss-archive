Say &quot;URL\n&gt; Construction&quot; and the RESTians stick their fingers in their\n&gt; ears and scream &quot;I don’t hear you&quot; while humming very loudly...\n&gt; ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; IOW, the phrase &quot;URL construction&quot; it is a trigger that causes\n&gt; most REST advocates to immediately become defensive rather than\n&gt; to be willing to explore how to achieve both benefits of\n&gt; hypermedia *and* URL construction. It&#39;s kinda similar to the\n&gt; feelings that the phrase &quot;amnesty&quot; evokes in certain people\n&gt; here in the US right now. ;-)\n\nYour harping on this matter and your triumphalist “a-ha! gotcha!”\nresponses are getting tiresome, I have to say. Please quit making\nup controversy that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe matter is very simple: if the URI is constructed according to\npromises published in a resource by the server, then it is\nhypermedia. If the URI is constructed based on a priori client\nknowledge of the server URI space then it is not hypermedia. Fin.\n\n&gt; &gt;If the server communicates a URI template and how it should be\n&gt; &gt;used then it IS hypermedia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your acknowledgement here is begrudging rather than\n&gt; revelational.\n\nNo, his acknowledgement is a Rorschach test. Your interpretation\nof it as begrudged is merely a reflection of your own bias.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s my belief we need to stop being afraid of URI construction\n&gt; as a phrase and instead look for how to achieve most or all of\n&gt; its benefits without causing harm to the REST architecture.\n\nThat’s very simple: if the URI is constructed based on\nhypermedia, then the application is RESTful. If not, it’s not.\n\nI don’t know what we need to talk about, here.\n\n&gt; If RESTians really want to promote the use of the hypermedia\n&gt; constraint they need to catalyze the creation of tools that\n&gt; make it brain-dead easy program hypermedia in a generic sense.\n\nNo doubt.\n\n&gt; &gt;A good test of this is whether it can deal with a change of\n&gt; &gt;URIs in the path, host, scheme and query string portion\n&gt; &gt;(moving information between each of these parts I&#39;d consider a\n&gt; &gt;plus but not a vital necessity).\n&gt; \n&gt; Heh. Any and every REST system will fail that test. After all,\n&gt; how do you change the entry point URL? &#39;-)\n\nNot by changing the code, hopefully. \n\nIn fact, you could make that URI a link in a resource you control,\nin which case the REST client would in fact not need to change\n*at all*.\n\nSee? We could split hairs about the exceptional case of the entry\npoint all day long. :-)\n\nWhat matters is you know what Jon meant; and you do.\n\n&gt; &gt;That it doesn&#39;t directly relate to what people are thinking\n&gt; &gt;about when they think about media types aimed at other uses\n&gt; &gt;(particularly web services) \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s one falicy RESTians often commit; assuming that everyone\n&gt; that is trying to understand REST is steeped in SOAP or RPC.\n&gt; Many web developers (myself included) had never used SOAP or\n&gt; RPC so for us this is unnecessary complication.\n\nI realised this today. The reason I have been harping on the\nhypermedia constraint lately is that it is the only part of REST\nthat I hadn’t already understood. Contrary to those coming from a\nSOAP/WS-* background, I “grew up” with HTTP and it never quite\noccured to me how many more differences between RPC style and\nREST style exist, and more importantly that the REST way of doing\nthings with respect to those differences isn’t necessarily an\nobvious and natural approach.\n\n&gt; Rather than go round and round on this, will you at least agree\n&gt; that most people need more guidance than just being told: &quot;any\n&gt; web page with links and forms is an example?&quot;    \n\nWas anyone seriously saying that this is sufficient guidance?\nI didn’t think anyone was claiming that. Of *course* it’s not\nenough as a send-off for people building apps.\n\n&gt; &gt;Really hypermedia is almost too simple that some people\n&gt; &gt;(focusing on other concerns, especially if their background\n&gt; &gt;makes RPC or other non-RESTful solutions seem more obvious)\n&gt; &gt;can&#39;t change gears.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe the problem for many that can&#39;t change gears is that the\n&gt; debates are too often framed on an abstract &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot;\n&gt; turning it into a religious debate rather than providing\n&gt; examples that illustrate the benefits of REST and that speak\n&gt; for themselves?\n\nI think it is simply a matter of the lessons not having sunk in\nenough. A lot of people are still learning, so they say things\nthat omit or misinterpret large parts of the style, or focus on\nirrelevant or orthogonal issues, etc. Certainly I’ve been\nnoticing a lot of that since I’ve had my lightbulb moment.\n\nBut I think this matter will straighten itself out over time as\nmore people absorb the lessons and apply it in practice, coming\naway with examples from experience.\n\nIt’s just the natural process of adoption.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
