I almost don&#39;t dare to say it, but what if I wanted a \nservice that does some editing actions on an image, like removing red \neyes. Would I _have_ to consider an image as a resource and store it \nbefore requesting the image without red eyes? What I initially wanted to \ndo was a stateless editing request, while I had to change the server&#39;s \nstate (for quite some time) to achieve it.\n\n\nNick Gall schreef:\n&gt;\n&gt; How about compressing the query string with gzip before embedding it \n&gt; in the URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, May 5, 2008 at 4:22 AM, Barbara Van De Keer \n&gt; &lt;Barbara.VanDeKeer@... &lt;mailto:Barbara.VanDeKeer@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;     I&#39;m having trouble mapping the act of &#39;doing a search based on a\n&gt;     complex\n&gt;     query&#39; to a REST service. This query is not simple enough to put\n&gt;     in the\n&gt;     URI (too long, too complex,...)\n&gt;\n&gt;     I&#39;ve been reading through previous messages on this mailing list and\n&gt;     noticed that this issue has been talked about multiple times here,\n&gt;     but I\n&gt;     still haven&#39;t found a solution I&#39;m completely satisfied with.\n&gt;\n&gt;     These are the options I have gone through:\n&gt;\n&gt;     1. GET with a body\n&gt;\n&gt;     Isn&#39;t supported by application servers and proxy&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt;     2. Assume the query, or the result of the query (doesn&#39;t really\n&gt;     matter)\n&gt;     to be a resource by itself, do a POST to create it. The resource\n&gt;     is now\n&gt;     remembered by the server and still accessible through a GET (maybe\n&gt;     only\n&gt;     for a certain time).\n&gt;\n&gt;     I don&#39;t like this option, because I didn&#39;t want to change the\n&gt;     state of\n&gt;     the server, in fact I intrinsically just wanted to do some kind of a\n&gt;     GET, which shouldn&#39;t change the state of the server.\n&gt;\n&gt;     3. Overload POST, don&#39;t change the server&#39;s state by POSTing the query\n&gt;\n&gt;     This is the most practical solution that I can come up with, but it&#39;s\n&gt;     not really REST... The uniform interface is broken since I use POST\n&gt;     already for creating resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I hope this opens the discussion again, I&#39;d really like to find a\n&gt;     RESTful solution to this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Thanks!\n&gt;     Barbara\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nick Gall\n&gt; Phone: +1.781.608.5871\n&gt; AOL IM: Nicholas Gall\n&gt; Yahoo IM: nick_gall_1117\n&gt; MSN IM: (same as email)\n&gt; Google Talk: (same as email)\n&gt; Email: nick.gall AT-SIGN gmail DOT com\n&gt; Weblog: http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/ \n&gt; &lt;http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/&gt;\n&gt; Furl: http://www.furl.net/members/ngall \n&gt; &lt;http://www.furl.net/members/ngall&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n-- \nBarbara Van De Keer\n\nGhent University - IBBT\nFaculty of Engineering\nDepartment of Electronics and Information Systems\nMultimedia Lab\nGaston Crommenlaan 8 bus 201, B-9050 Ledeberg-Ghent, Belgium\n\nt: +32 9 33 14985\nf: +32 9 33 14896\nt secr: +32 9 33 14911\ne: barbara.vandekeer@...\n\nURL: http://multimedialab.elis.ugent.be\n\n"}}
