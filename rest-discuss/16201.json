Especially I =\r\nam\n&gt;&gt; wondering whether it is enough for the user agent to say\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Acce=\r\npt: application/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; or whether the Accept header sh=\r\nould include the user agent\n&gt; capabilities\n&gt;&gt; regarding the individual orde=\r\nr entries, e.g.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Accept: application/orderlist\n&gt; \n&gt; I consider media=\r\n types as syntax, not semantics. If\n&gt; application/orderlist really has diff=\r\nerent syntax than\n&gt; application/atom+xml, then, OK I guess. But it probably=\r\n shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; Instead, the semantics of the resource are described by the @=\r\nrel\n&gt; attribute the user-agent discovered and followed (in combination with=\r\n\n&gt; data and its arrangement in the response, including further links in the=\r\n\n&gt; response). Your resource could just as easily return &quot;text/html&quot; with\n&gt; =\r\nthe same semantics and, if the client understood HTML, could be\n&gt; processed=\r\n meaningfully, in which case the client would emit &quot;Accept:\n&gt; application/a=\r\ntom+xml, text/html&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, the Accept header says, &quot;these ar=\r\ne the representation\n&gt; formats I am prepared to parse for a resource of the=\r\n &#39;new-orders&#39;\n&gt; relation&quot;. A media type of &quot;application/orderlist&quot; *can* be=\r\n used in that\n&gt; way, but couples too tightly, IMO. There are plenty of &quot;lis=\r\nt-y&quot; media\n&gt; types out there already--does a list of orders really differ\n&gt;=\r\n significantly in structure (not just differ in @rel&#39;s) from a list of,\n&gt; s=\r\nay, sale items? Atom has succeeded, IMO, because it is specific in\n&gt; syntax=\r\n (&quot;feed&quot; =3D list of items in order, with some fixed fields) and\n&gt; generic =\r\nin semantics (doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re listing). I wrote Shoji\n&gt; [1] beca=\r\nuse I wanted to hit that sweet spot for a &quot;catalog&quot; syntax\n&gt; (entities and =\r\noverlapping lists of entity URI&#39;s) that was independent of\n&gt; the semantic--=\r\nI wrote it for Etsy procurement, but it could equally be\n&gt; used for represe=\r\nnting scientific lab work.
