I&#39;m all for the former; in none of the cases you mention\nabove is it safe to assume anything like the latter.  In each of these\ncases, you&#39;re referring to a resource in the top-level namespace.  The fact\nthat the URI contains an embedded URI is both coincidental *and* meaningless\nto you --- the URI is opaque, and you can&#39;t assume that it represents a\npipeline construction.\n\n&gt; There are basically only a few ways to compose a service and a GET. You\n&gt; can either do a GET that triggers another GET, or you can do the GET and\n&gt; then feed the data from the get into the service. The former can be done\n&gt; in a declarative, addresable way. The latter cannot.\n\nThis is a bit mom-and-apple-pie;  sure, declarative is great, we all love\ndeclarative.  But the fact that you&#39;re embedding order-dependent procedural\nsemantics in what is otherwise a declarative medium (URI) doesn&#39;t make it\nany more or less declarative than if the pipeline is locally controlled /\nexists in some medium other than a URI.  (Consider:  the pipeline could be\njust as declaratively constructed in some XML form that is interpreted and\nmanaged locally.)\n\nI&#39;m not opposed to pipes, Paul --- I just think it&#39;s important to realize\nthat you need to locally control all the transitions between intermediates,\nrather than assume that some third party will correctly and reliably do that\nfor you.  Consider:  even in the shell case of foo | bar | baz, in fact the\nshell is arranging the connections between them by twiddling file\ndescriptors.  Control isn&#39;t handed down the pipe.\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
