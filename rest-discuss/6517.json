An individual apple\n&gt;may represent the &quot;apples&quot; concept, but this can&#39;t have much to do\n&gt;with REST.  REST representations are bit streams.\n&gt;\n\nThat point about representations is well-taken.  But I also think using \nvarieties of apples is a good way to explain &quot;variant&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;In any event, if REST newbies want to understand resource as a\n&gt;mapping of time to representations, it is probably more intuitive to\n&gt;demonstrate that with www.weather.com.  I don&#39;t think of the weather\n&gt;in my town as a box of anything.  It&#39;s just the weather.  I look again;\n&gt;it has changed.\n&gt;\n\nThe basic concept I am trying to portray is that a resource is a set, in fact \nthat is what Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation calls it:\n\n&quot;[A] resource... maps to a set of entities...&quot;\n\nA friend of mine brought up the notion of XML namespaces, how is that a set. \nWell, a 404 response may not make it a null set, because there still may be a \ndescription of that namespace out there even if the identifier doesn&#39;t locate \nit.  A namespace URI is still a set whose membership function is whatever \ndocument describes that namespace.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;People who need to understand REST are going to be computer\n&gt;scientists.  It is reasonable to expect them to understand mappings\n&gt;whose domain is time and whose range is bit streams.\n&gt;\n\nI couldn&#39;t disagree more.  &quot;What is REST&quot; and related questions are popping \nup more and more frequently amongst lay web developers who are increasingly \nstandards-conscious.  After years spent un-learning a variety of bad habits \n(like table-based layouts instead of CSS) which were once mainstream many of \nus are asking, &quot;OK, enough already, what is the right way?&quot; I know lots of \nnon-computer-scientist types who are experienced application developers using \nPHP and such, who are coming to understand that MVC isn&#39;t the best way, but \nneed practical assistance designing URIs correctly.\n\nHere&#39;s what Sleepycat Software has to say on the issue:\n\n&quot;[S]ites are maturing, becoming more complex and more flexible. This richness \ncomes at a price; the data-model required to represent the dynamic nature of \nthese next generation sites requires a computer science degree. As sites have \ngrown in complexity, the number of programmers able to build the sites has \ndecreased and site construction, infrastructure and maintenance costs have \ngone up.&quot;\n\n[1] http://www.sleepycat.com/newsletters/0502/a14_FebProdPHP.shtml\n\nI disagree that understanding REST should require a degree in Computer \nScience, but the reality described in that ad copy is motivating more \ndevelopers to look at REST for solutions to rein in escalating hosting costs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, if you do decide to pursue this, I hope you will find a way\n&gt;to do it that does not begin by planting the idea that REST somehow\n&gt;condones container-containee inconsistency.  There is really no\n&gt;basis for that.\n&gt;\n\nThis is why I need a re-writer... That&#39;s exactly the notion I&#39;m trying to \ndispel by explaining _why_ &quot;The only thing that is required to be static for \na resource is the semantics of the mapping, since the semantics is what \ndistinguishes one resource from another.&quot;  I just thought &quot;don&#39;t put oranges \nin a box of apples&quot; was oversimplifying...\n\nThis is the real challenge.  I have trouble explaining this to my coder on a \ndaily basis and he does have a degree in Computer Science, just no practical \nexperience of anything but RPC-style development.  I find it helpful to \nabstract the REST concepts with him, too, particularly what is meant by &quot;the \nsemantics of the mapping must be static&quot;.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Walden\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
