Then, using a single POST to the transaction URI, you submit \nthe entire transaction.  A response is returned with each of the \nindividual responses being listed in the same order as to match their \nrespective requests.  Only if all responses are 2xx (or 3xx in some \ncases) do all updated resources get committed.  Otherwise, no updates \nget committed.  In the case of GETs, they would be submitted as \nconditional HEAD requests.  They are considered successful only if they \nget a 304 response.\n\nI suspect there are issues with visibility and other things, but I \nthought this might be an interesting approach.  :)\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
