I understand the basic premise behind re=\r\nl attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact with th=\r\ne link provider).\n\nThe premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the cas=\r\ne of the HTML or Atom media types) to provide information about the meaning=\r\n of the link beyond &#39;this is a link&#39;. If you register your rel name in the =\r\nIANA registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. &#39;next&#39; or &#39;u=\r\np&#39;. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply for=\r\n the matter of making your rel unambiguous.\n\nIf that URI points to a human =\r\nreadable page explaining the relation, then that is even better.\n\nThere is =\r\nno magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in code (=\r\nor configure) what the user agent should do when it sees your link rel valu=\r\ne.\n\n&lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://foo/customerDetails&quot; ... /&gt; is conceptually the sam=\r\ne as &lt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; .../&gt; and also as HTML&#39;s &lt;img src=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;=\r\n or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a =\r\nuser agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to have=\r\n it do something with it.\n\nIOW, your browser downloads that image because i=\r\nt is programmed to do so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedi=\r\na - your user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in=\r\n the way it is programmed (or configured) to do.\n\nNo magic.\n\nThe effect of =\r\nthe hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the obligations you have=\r\n as a client side programmer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come =\r\nacross instead of the one you presume to come across) than it is felt in th=\r\ne aspect of loose coupling.\n\nREST mostly makes explicit that there isn&#39;t an=\r\ny control over the server side in networked systems. REST encourages you to=\r\n deal with that rather than magically solves a problem that cannot be solve=\r\nd. And on top of that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize fo=\r\nr *dealing with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n&gt; The =\r\nquestion is what would you see if you go to the rel link? Is it something a=\r\n person is suppose to interact with (say to get documentation for new links=\r\n added to a specific response) or something code can interact with to deter=\r\nmine what it needs to do? Unfortunately in the book they don&#39;t give an exam=\r\nple of what a &quot;rel&quot; page would look like. For example the link:\n&gt; &lt;link rel=\r\n=3D&quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot;\n&gt; href:=3D&quot;http://restbucks.com=\r\n/payment/1234&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If you typed in &quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/paym=\r\nent&quot; into your web browser what would you see? \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
