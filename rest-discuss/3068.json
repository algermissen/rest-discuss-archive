So, it would be RESTful to have\n&gt; those two URIs for example\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.physicists.org/html/list-of-physicists\n&gt; http://www.physicists.org/xml/list-of-physicists\n&gt;\n&gt; although the representations they return are\n&gt; representations of the same resource (concept) and only differ\n&gt; in the markup language used ?\n\nThose are two different resources.  If a person wishes to identify\nthe XML representation of a concept, an HTML response to that resource\nwould not be a valid representation even though it may have essentially\nthe same content.  If the resource is a concept independent of\nrepresentation format, then its URI must not have any aspect\nthat is specific to the representation format.  Having that aspect\nin the URI (as interpreted by the origin server) implies that the\nresource semantics includes the format.\n\nBTW, for server-contructed URI, there is no effective difference\nbetween query and path info -- both distinguish a resource.  It is\nonly when the URI is client-constructed (as in GET forms or ISINDEX\nor the old server-side image maps) that the client has any way to\ndistinguish the non-query path as a resource, and even then the\nvarious URI with the query info tagged-onto the end identify separate\nresources.\n\nA resource is defined not by its implementation, but by a user&#39;s\nexpectation of results from future actions on that resource.\nIf two URI are expected to respond to GET differently, then they\nmust identify different resources.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
