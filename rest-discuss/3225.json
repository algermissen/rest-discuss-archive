I mean, I\nprefer RSS 1.0 to RSS 2.0, and I think RESTlog would be more useful if you\ndidn&#39;t specify so much about how messages are stored on the server side;\nboth physically and w/r/t to format...\n\nIt might be nice to make a capability discovery URI, like:\n\nhttp://foo.bar/message-types\n\nwhich one could GET and which would return an XML doc (actually, RDF would\nbe ideal for this) describing which formats the RESTlog could understand and\nstore, among other things.\n\nIn other words, RESTlog looks neat, but if I were going to use it for\nprojects, I&#39;d want to store messages not in files on the filesystem but in,\nsay, ZODB (or MySQL), and I&#39;d want to have more flexibility in the sorts of\nmessage types a client could expect to POST.\n\nKendall\n-- \nJazz is only what you are. -- Louis Armstrong\n\n"}}
