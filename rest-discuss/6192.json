I was just having a conversation with my\ncoworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\nhaving to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\nsessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to their\nfriends. Now their friends would jump into their session and potentially\nbe able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click shopping) and\ncause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n\n-- \nTracy R Reed\nhttp://ultraviolet.org\n\n\n\n"}}
