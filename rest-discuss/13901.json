Someone suggested naming things is not so good, but \n&gt; I love doing so somethings to know what am I referring to.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I wanted to present a classification \n&gt; I did two days ago while riding the bus to work. Silly? It may be, but I \n&gt; guess it helps understand where are we standing in terms of REST \n&gt; usability and knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; *API Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually not \n&gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually think \n&gt; REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.\n&gt; /Subcategories:\n&gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This are the ones that think REST is all about \n&gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So their discussions are solely focused \n&gt; on URIs, and their presentations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt;  - *RPCers*. Bad group that think REST is a way to map RPC in disguise \n&gt; using URIs in a web API. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak RPC at all.\n&gt;  - *Exposers*: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that \n&gt; think you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST is an \n&gt; API for exposing things on the web.\n&gt;  - *CRUDers*: Another repeated group. They think REST is a web api for \n&gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Mappers*: This other category may use the API idea, but they actually \n&gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work to be done is to map \n&gt; all that is know used to that new type. Interesting?\n&gt;  - *CRUDers*. Again, the idea is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to \n&gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt;  - *HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n&gt;  - *Exposers*. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, data \n&gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call their systems RESTful.\n&gt; *\n&gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t he reminders of the types. \n&gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n&gt;  - *Standard Haters*: Here you have all those that think Standards are \n&gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you have the freedom to do \n&gt; whatever you like, so they follow REST doing whatever they want.\n&gt;  - *KISS lovers*. This are the ones that like thinks to be simple. And \n&gt; someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things with \n&gt; URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in this group.\n&gt;  - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and someone told them REST \n&gt; is a way to do services without SOAP. So they follow.\n&gt;  - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so they \n&gt; follow REST just because it is cool and all people talk about it. There \n&gt; are some Buzz creators too, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA. No pun \n&gt; intended on REST-*\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the group that knows \n&gt; REST as it actually is and understan ds it. That may be a one person \n&gt; group (yes Roy).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m may not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT \n&gt; saying they are good, at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think? Do you find yourself in any of those groups?\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
