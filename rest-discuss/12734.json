We can in various ways\nbuild behavioral interfaces as data representations. Seb gave good\nexamples using his rel links, another good example would be modelling\na resource as a state machine. These solutions do however offer a\nrather large impedance mismatch with that of our behavioral system\n(often times creating a large language gap as an example).\n\nWhen does this impedance mismatch become appropriate to take on?\n\nGreg\n\n-- \nIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought\nwithout accepting it.\n\n"}}
