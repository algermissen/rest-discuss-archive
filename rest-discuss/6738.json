Roy, you really really ought to review the MetadataInURI finding.  You\nwere on the TAG, it&#39;s about URIs and metadata, you don&#39;t like the first\nsentence, you know everbody..  &#39;nuff said.\n \n2.  There are at least a few obvious questions you didn&#39;t answer, fair\nenough.  The &quot;think for yourself&quot; line is always good advice.  But I want to\npoke a little more at the question of representations of REST and\nversioning. Is REST fully completely captured for all time in your thesis,\nor is your thesis a representation of REST at a point in time?  That is, is\nthe REST resource immutable or mutable?  Obviously your dissertation will\nnot change but I have thought that the dissertation was a capture at a point\nin time.  \n \nCheers,\nDave\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Roy T.
