This is brittle since the serialization techniques rely\n&gt; on a very concise definition of the payload. Anything out of the\n&gt; ordinary causes an exception or error.\n\nIn my view the problem is not that `application/xml` deserialization\nis often rather unforgiving.  (That is an issue, but it&#39;s just an\nimplementation detail.)  The real problem is that media types like\n`application/xml` do describe the semantics at all.  When a request\nclaims to accept `application/xml` what does that really mean? RSS?\nMaybe Atom?  Maybe BPML?  Or perhaps some proprietary inventory xml\nformat?\n\nI think Jan Algermissen was pointing out is that the client should\nprovide a sufficiently precise media type in it&#39;s content type and\naccept header fields that the server, and all the intermediates that\ncare, know what it really needs to function correctly.\n\nXHTML meets this standard not because it has a well defined syntax but\nbecause a great deal of work has gone into describing the semantics of\nwhat its grammar means.  However, using XHTML as a container for\napplication specific data while not utilizing its core semantics seems\nto miss the mark.  If the server could reasonably produce a response\nfor the content type and acceptable media types of a request that\nwould cause the client to not function then the media type is not\nspecific enough.  Using XHTML as a container format puts you in\nexactly that position.\n\n--\nPeter Williamsthat\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
