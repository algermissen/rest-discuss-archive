I learned last week that the  \n&gt;&gt; recommended  alternative is HTTP authentication. But try as I may  \n&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t find a  way to use HTTP auth because of usability (can&#39;t  \n&gt;&gt; give a nice login  page if JavaScript is disabled, hard or  \n&gt;&gt; impossible to do single-sign  on, etc...)\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP authentication has great usability, far better than the forms  \n&gt; and JavaScript web developers splatter on pages to replace the real  \n&gt; authentication dialogs. It&#39;s totally obvious to users how to fill  \n&gt; in this stuff, and browsers can easily recognize and autofill the  \n&gt; dialogs, and even avoid showing them when they&#39;re redundant. In  \n&gt; practice, this always works. What fails repeatedly in the real  \n&gt; world are form and cookie based authentication schemes.\n&gt;\n&gt; What you call &quot;usability&quot; has little to do with usability. Rather  \n&gt; it is the same art-school idiocy that has hobbled the Web ever  \n&gt; since Marc Andreesen added the img tag to HTML in 1993. Designers,  \n&gt; not users but designers, get upset that the username and password  \n&gt; dialog doesn&#39;t fit their site&#39;s carefully constructed look and feel  \n&gt; (one that more often than not doesn&#39;t look like they expect on any  \n&gt; system except their own anyway). Users generally couldn&#39;t care less  \n&gt; about this. They just want to log in, get their work done, and  \n&gt; forget about the whole username/password mess.\n&gt;\nI haven&#39;t done user testing, nor have I experimented with HTTP  \nauthentication, but let me tell you specifically the concerns I have.  \nI welcome corrections to my understanding of HTTP auth. Here&#39;s our  \nlogin form:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/sign_in\n\n1) As we are planning to have a network of sites, I took to calling  \nthe username &quot;Artima ID&quot; just as Yahoo call&#39;s their login a &quot;Yahoo  \nID&quot;, to make it obvious what you&#39;re logging into. &quot;The C++ Source&quot;  \nwill someday be its own website, but to sign in you need to use  your  \nArtima ID. You don&#39;t have a The C++ Source ID. My understanding is I  \nhave no control over what the browser puts as the prompt for the  \nusername. I&#39;m not concerned about looks here, just clarity. As I  \nsaid, I haven&#39;t done user testing, but I&#39;m concerned that once we go  \nto SSO on a network of sites, the inability for me to put &quot;Artima ID&quot;  \nnext to an empty box for the username will cause people to be  \nconfused about what to type there.\n\n2) Also, email addresses are now unique in our database, so if you  \nforget your Artima ID, I&#39;d like to let you use any of the email  \naddresses you attached to your account instead of your Artima ID. And  \nin fact, I may have registration paths where you don&#39;t select an  \nArtima ID, so you may not have an ID even if you have an account. So  \nI may want to say &quot;Artima ID or email address:&quot; next to that empty  \nbox. I think that&#39;s going to be more confusing than just Artima ID,  \nso I&#39;ll have to do some user testing. Maybe I&#39;ll not do it at all, or  \nmaybe I&#39;ll have a little note that explains you can use either one.  \nRegardless, if people are authenticating via the client&#39;s auth  \ndialog, I believe it would be hard for me to explain that.\n\n3) If you forgot your password, I have on the sign in page a &quot;Forgot  \nyour password&quot; link to a way to deal with that problem. Once again,  \nI&#39;m not sure how I can make that option clear using the browser&#39;s  \nHTTP auth dialog. It&#39;s not about looks, but about helping the user  \nsee how to solve this problem.\n\n4). If you don&#39;t have an account yet, I have a &quot;Sign Up&quot; link to a  \npath that allows you to create a new account, to register. Once  \nagain, I&#39;m not sure how to make that path as obvious when using the  \nclient&#39;s HTTP auth dialog. Once again, not about appearance as about  \nmaking it easy for the user to figure out what to do next in this  \ncommon situation.\n\nNow, I haven&#39;t tried this buy my current untested belief is that I  \ncan accomplish all of these things via HTTP auth, in fact can do so  \nwith an identical looking sign in page, if JavaScript is enabled on  \nthe client. Because the JS would catch the submit and use HTTP auth  \nto authenticate. But, doing this means that if JS is not enabled,  \neither I:\n\nA) Don&#39;t allow them to log in. That&#39;s a real usability minus of the  \nsite, and not acceptable to me.\nB) Use the client&#39;s HTTP auth dialog, which although it has all the  \nabove usability minuses, does work. If only a small number of clients  \ndon&#39;t have JS, then this could be seen as a way of gracefully  \ndegrading the usability of the site. I don&#39;t know how many of  \nArtima&#39;s current clients don&#39;t have JS, so it may be that this would  \nbe acceptable. If it is 0.01% of clients, then I may be able to  \nswallow this approach.\nC) Switch over to using cookie auth if JS is not enabled, but cookies  \nare. If cookies aren&#39;t enabled, then degrade to using the client&#39;s  \nHTTP auth dialog.\n\nNot sure how to make all that smooth, but there are other problems.\n\n5) I don&#39;t see a way to do optional authentication. What I can do  \nwith HTTP auth is force them to sign in before doing things that  \nrequire being signed in, like posting to a forum or administration.  \nHowever, what I also want to do is be able to recognize via the  \nrequest whether or not the user is signed in. If not, I don&#39;t want to  \nforce them to sign in, and instead will return a representation for  \nguests. If they are signed in, I want to return a personalized  \nrepresentation of the resource. I can do this kind of personalization  \nwith HTTP auth + cookies, if cookies are enabled, or HTTP auth + URL  \nrewriting, if cookies are disabled. But if I&#39;m using cookies and URL  \nrewriting to get a personalization, why not use the same for  \nauthentication? The security answer to that is that it is easier to  \ndo replay attacks if I use the cookies or URL rewriting for  \nauthentication, so long as it is digest not basic authentication I&#39;m  \nusing.\n\nSo there is a real security reason there, but HTTP auth  has its own  \nbig security problem of not being able to turn off the  \nauthentication, which I&#39;ll talk about more below, and I have  \nworkarounds for the security problems of cookies:\n\ni) Always post the sign in credentials (esp the the pasword) over HTTPS.\nii) Only do personalization and allow non-critical actions based on  \nan earlier authentication. Before any serious thing, ask for their  \npassword again over HTTPS. If they can&#39;t supply it, they can&#39;t  \nproceed. If they do proceed, everything goes over HTTPS.\niii) Periodically ask for the password again anyway, in case someone  \nleft themselves logged in at public internet cafe. (Yahoo does both  \nii and iii.)\n\n6) I want to allow people to log into the entire network a la SSO. I  \ncan do that with cookies and URL rewriting, but it isn&#39;t so easy to  \ndo with HTTP authentication. I think I actually figured out a way to  \ndo it if JS is enabled, but I haven&#39;t tried it and once again, what  \ndo I do if JS is not enabled? Do I degrade by saying you can&#39;t have  \nSSO without JS? Do I degrade by switching to cookies/URL rewriting?\n\n7) Lastly, these sites will each have several people who can do  \nvarious administration roles such as editing, reviewing, moderating.  \nI&#39;m planning on having every administrator come up with a second  \n&quot;admin&quot; password of there own, and forcing them to supply the admin  \npassword before doing any administration, all of which will happen  \nunder HTTPS. This is one area where I&#39;ve considered HTTP auth might  \nfit, because all the administration could take place under /admin, I  \ndon&#39;t care about SSO, I&#39;m not so worried about confusing the user  \nbecause that actually would add to the security. But once again, I  \nwas stopped by the inability to log them off once done.\n\nOK, there are 7 specific usability problems I have with HTTP auth in  \nits current form. I&#39;ll say a bit more about the log off problem in a  \nsubsequent email. One last security concern worth mentioning is that  \nI&#39;m nervous about the inability to determine whether the client  \nsupports digest authentication. I want to avoid ever sending the  \npassword in the clear, and want to minimize the use of HTTPS to just  \nthe places where it is needed. Can I be unworried that if I say I  \nwant digest auth and the client doesn&#39;t have it, that it won&#39;t fall  \nback to basic auth? Probably an unnecessary fear, but one that  \nconcerns me based on some things I read on the web this past week  \nabout how HTTP auth is implemented in some clients. And what do I do  \nif the client doesn&#39;t support digest? Do I degrade by saying you  \ncan&#39;t log in, or by switching to cookies/URL rewriting?\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
