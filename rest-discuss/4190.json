So when you say &quot;REST is\ninterested in stateless servers&quot;, that seems ambiguous to me as the\nnotion of a &quot;server&quot; typically encapsulates the component and the\nconnector.\n\nMark.\n\nOn Thu, Feb 12, 2004 at 10:04:38PM -0500, Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; I think the confusion may arise from the sloppy way in which\n&gt; the word &quot;stateless&quot; is sometimes used.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, REST\n&gt; is interested in stateless servers, i.e., servers shouldn&#39;t be burdened\n&gt; with remembering what clients had said on previous encounters.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you talk about &quot;stateless messages&quot; you&#39;re talking nonsense,\n&gt; strictly speaking.  A message is a collection of bits, and that&#39;s\n&gt; state.  So strict analysis is a dead end.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s likely meant by &quot;stateless message&quot; is really the opposite:\n&gt; that the message capitulates the state of the conversation&#39;s progress\n&gt; so that the server doesn&#39;t need to.\n&gt; \n&gt; A cookie that says &quot;we&#39;re on step 6 of our business process&quot;, in\n&gt; a message designed to take us to step seven, is fine, as it tells the\n&gt; server everything it needs to know to proceed.\n&gt; \n&gt; A cookie that says &quot;I&#39;m session &#39;27htiwydn5&&&#39;, remember me&quot;\n&gt; has the opposite effect.  It&#39;s pointing the server to server-side state\n&gt; stored for the session.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you need to know more than just that there&#39;s a cookie.  The\n&gt; key and underlying issue is whether the server has dedicated\n&gt; storage resources to remembering a conversation.  All else is\n&gt; window dressing.\n&gt; \n&gt; How&#39;m I doin&#39;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;justin_t_sampson&quot; &lt;justin.sampson@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 12, 2004 9:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Re: sessions and infinite URIs\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; : Roy T.

The set of URIs can be reduced to a more natural, finite\n&gt; : &gt; set by inserting the user id instead.

A message\n&gt; : &gt; containing cookie headers is still stateless, assuming that the\n&gt; : &gt; cookie isn&#39;t specified relative to some prior state (which\n&gt; : &gt; would be very weird).\n&gt; : \n&gt; : Really? That&#39;s odd, because reading your dissertation just now\n&gt; : for the definition of statelessness I was about to suppose that\n&gt; : even putting the session key in the URI itself would be\n&gt; : considered stateful according to REST: &quot;communication must be\n&gt; : stateless in nature [...] such that each request from client to\n&gt; : server must contain all of the information necessary to\n&gt; : understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored\n&gt; : context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely\n&gt; : on the client.\n&gt; : \n&gt; : &quot;This constraint induces the properties of visibility,\n&gt; : reliability, and scalability.

Scalability is improved because not having\n&gt; : to store state between requests allows the server component to\n&gt; : quickly free resources, and further simplifies implementation\n&gt; : because the server doesn&#39;t have to manage resource usage across\n&gt; : requests.&quot;\n&gt; : \n&gt; : &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.ht\n&gt; : m#sec_5_1_3&gt;\n&gt; : \n&gt; : The &quot;managing resource usage&quot; problem applies equally to all the\n&gt; : ways we&#39;ve described for managing session state, suggesting that\n&gt; : the fact of the session state itself is &quot;stateful&quot; and therefore\n&gt; : in violation of REST regardless of how the client passes the key\n&gt; : to the server.
