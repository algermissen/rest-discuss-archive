But I meet a\n&gt; &gt; problem when design my (hopefully) restful web service.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My website users can add books or movies to their lists, with some\n&gt; &gt; predefined status (e.g. &quot;have read&quot;, &quot;wish to watch&quot;, etc.) and\n&gt; &gt; comments.  How can I let web service users to get information like\n&gt; &gt; &quot;get all the books Bob wish to read, with his comments&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think the resources in this case are not books, because comments are\n&gt; &gt; not attributes of books.  They are attributes of the &quot;relationship of\n&gt; &gt; Bob and the book&quot;.  Let me call the relationship &quot;collection&quot;.  So I\n&gt; &gt; designed the following URLs and lost:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /users/Bob/collections?cat=book&status=wish\n&gt; &gt; /users/Bob/collections/book/wish\n&gt; &gt; /users/Bob/collections/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; &gt; /collections/user/Bob/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; &gt; /collections?user=Bob&cat=book&status=wish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which one do you consider the most &quot;RESTful&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; URI design is very nice for human users.  And it&#39;s a good opportunity\n&gt; to think about resource design.  But it&#39;s good to remember that REST\n&gt; has no constraints on what your URIs should look like. It&#39;s just an\n&gt; identifier.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, personally I&#39;d go with either your first or your last one,\n&gt; since the resource you&#39;re naming isn&#39;t really part of a hierarchy, so\n&gt; slashes would be misleading to human eyes.  And it would be trivial to\n&gt; provide an html form that constructs such a URI, so you have HATEOAS.\n&gt;\n&gt; The O&#39;Reilly book has a nice section on URI design.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul Winkler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
