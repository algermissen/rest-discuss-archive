I think WebDAV (metadata aside) is a very good\n&gt; example for a REST-ful HTTP extension, it&#39;s deployed and it works.\n\nI do not know enough about WebDAV to argue one way or another on its usage\nof PUT in this manner.  Because existing applications do use PUT in this\nmanner does not change my mind about it.\n\n&gt; How would you do authoring of new resources just with POST?\n\nPOST to the resource&#39;s container.  There is *always* a container.  Of\ncourse, the feature that is lost (at the HTTP) level by using POST instead\nof PUT is the ability to specify what you want the new URI to be once the\nresource is created.  As I have suggested, using the &quot;Location&quot; header would\nallow the same functionality.  However, since Location (as a response\nheader) points to valid URIs, it may be more appropriate to use a different\n(probably new) header to provide the same functionality.\n\nOf course, I would prefer to have a CREATE verb that was responsible for\nresource creation instead of overloading POST (though this isn&#39;t strictly\nadding any more functionality to POST than already exists).  But that isn&#39;t\ngoing to happen any time soon.  :)\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
