However, it does not store the actual data it rather \nexpects the client=\r\n to provide all the data necessary to process the \nrequest. That can be the=\r\n shopping card contents.\n\nMy vision of RESTful shipping cart interation is =\r\nas follows:\n\nClient browses Amazon web site\nUser selects on &quot;add to cart&quot; l=\r\nink\nBuy submits /cart?action=3Dadd&id=3DXXXX\nServer response includes id=3D=\r\nXXXX (it can be XML or checkout URI with \nparameters - /cart?action=3Dcheck=\r\nout?id=3DXXXX)\nUser selects another item\nRequest goes to server as /cart?ac=\r\ntion=3Dadd&id=3DXXXX&id=3DYYYY\nServer responds with /cart?action=3Dcheckout=\r\n?id=3DXXXX&id=3DYYYY\nUser selects &quot;checkout&quot; - client side code submists th=\r\ne &quot;checkout&quot; \nrequest as instructed by server.\n\n\nThere can be many vairatio=\r\nns of this scheme. What&#39;s important to me \nis that each and every request h=\r\nas all the dynamic data. In other \nwords, the session state, sometimes also=\r\n referred as session context.\n\nI deliberatly used ID&#39;s in the example aimin=\r\ng to demonstrate use of \npersistent server side data. To me server may and =\r\noften will have \nconstant data necessary to process requests. That can be i=\r\nnventory \nprices, availability etc. The important distinction, I believe, t=\r\nhat \nserver side data does not change in the course of normal operation.\n\n\n=\r\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jon Hanna &lt;jon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ittay D=\r\nror wrote:\n&gt; &gt; so let&#39;s take the case of the shopping cart. according to th=\r\ne \nabove, \n&gt; &gt; there shouldn&#39;t be any shopping cart resource. as a client, =\r\ni \njust \n&gt; &gt; browse a web site for items i want, then post them all, in one=\r\n \ngo, to \n&gt; &gt; http://example.com/checkout. am i right?\n&gt; \n&gt; A server could =\r\nhave a bunch of shopping carts.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could know that certain authenticat=\r\nion parameters (whether \nRFC2617 \n&gt; username and username/realm/password ha=\r\nsh, or whatever) is needed \nto \n&gt; access the cart.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could know a lot=\r\n of things about how that shopping cart relates \nto \n&gt; other resources.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; None of these things require it to know anything about any state \nheld in=\r\n \n&gt; any webbrowser or other client.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
