I would like to make a counter-point though.\n\nWhile I was a proponent of XML in the early days, I&#39;ve since come to see it\nas more of a harm than good in many cases, especially when namespaces and\nvalidation are incorporated. I think that&#39;s one reason TimBL ended up\nreversing direction on HTML [1].  \n\nIt&#39;s biggest benefit is that it has been widely deployed but its complexity\n(namespaces, schemas, XSLT, etc.) has made for spotty tool support and lack\nof universally practiced approaches.\n\nConsidered from the perspective of the Robustness principle a.ka. Postel&#39;s\nLaw [2], use of (especially validated) XML is less than ideal because it\nputs a burden of conservatism on others. If I have a web service that\nrequires the client validate then after they&#39;ve done that and deployed the\ncode I can&#39;t change the representation that the service serves even if the\nchange would not otherwise affect them. That to me is anathema.  Using XML\nonly seems proper to me when you control development of both ends of the\nclient and server, when any deviance in prior behavior should trigger an\nerror, when every error should be reported immediately to the authority\noverseeing the system, and when the operation of the system should be halted\nuntil the deviation is discovered and corrected.\n\nOkay maybe I&#39;m being a bit extreme in my ideal criteria for XML but I was\ntrying to make a point, and the point is that XML seems (to me) to be best\nused for internal &quot;enterprisy&quot; applications, and even then I question its\nreal benefits.\n\n&gt; something decent and not close looking garbage.\n\nPersonally I find the verbosity and all the extranious syntax of XML to be\nharder to read than JSON, not easier.\n\n&gt; And XML makes it much easier to have your REST services \n\nHow so?  It seems easier to me to process JSON vs. XML, especially in a\nbrowser and in PHP v4.\n\n&gt; operate with the rest of the world as JASON parsers are not ubiquitous.\n\nBut writing a JSON parsers is trival, is it not?  Far easier than writing an\nXML parser for anything other than the most trivial of XML, right?\n\nmike amundsen wrote:\n&gt; I use XML/XSD for much of my server-side validation.  I even \n&gt; has routines that convert non-XSD-friendly mime-types into \n&gt; XML just so i can leverage XSD more easily.\n\nDoesn&#39;t that make you more conservative in what you accept rather than more\nliberal?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\nP.S. BTW, I&#39;m arguing for JSON more as an agnostic just as a religious\nagnostic would argue for a God with an atheist.  But I am arguing against\nXML as a relious atheist would argue against a God with a theist or\notherwise.\n\n[1] http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle\n\n\n"}}
