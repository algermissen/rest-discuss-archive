Each product has a URI that  \nuniquely identifies it. But each URI has a zillion representations  \nbased on who is asking for the resource. Each user sees the same  \nproduct information except that it has recommendations and other links  \nspecific to the user. When I bookmark the page to del.ico.us, or email  \nit to another user, the URI still resolves to the same product, but  \nwith a personalized representation. To me, this is completely RESTful  \nand does not require user-specific URLs.\n\nSubbu\n\nOn Dec 1, 2007, at 1:20 PM, Elliotte Rusty Harold wrote:\n\n&gt; pkeane wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does it follow that personalization can BEST be achieved by having a\n&gt;&gt; cookie that contains the user&#39;s id sit on the browser and used to\n&gt;&gt; construct URLs for XMLHTTPRequests (e.g.,\n&gt;&gt; http://example.com/userdata/{user-id}) that will return data to be\n&gt;&gt; inserted into the page?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Note that I do not want the user-id to be included in the url for  \n&gt;&gt; the page\n&gt;&gt; itself (e.g. http://example.com/home). I am assuming that the login\n&gt;&gt; process, which can use HTTP Auth, will give the server the  \n&gt;&gt; opportunity to\n&gt;&gt; set the cookie at the start of the login &#39;session&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; thoughts?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re breaking REST then. One fundamental principle is that the URI\n&gt; identifies the resource, nothing else. Addressing and authentication  \n&gt; are\n&gt; two separate concerns, and you&#39;re mixing them up. Personalized  \n&gt; resources\n&gt; require personalized URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; The personalized URLs don&#39;t actually have to contain the user name if\n&gt; that bothers you for some reason. However they do have to be unique to\n&gt; the user for whom the data is personalized.\n&gt;\n&gt; It gets a little tricky when, as you describe here, one page contains\n&gt; resources accumulated from multiple URLs, but full REST requires that\n&gt; the page itself still have a unique, identifiable URL. The more you  \n&gt; move\n&gt; away from this the less well the Web will work for you.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
