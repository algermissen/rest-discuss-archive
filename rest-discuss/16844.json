In pure REST I believe my client could repeatedly poll for new\nupdates via a GET, or use a HEAD request to see if it already holds the most\nrecent update.  But, since the updates could be a frequency of 5 per second\nor 5 per hour a high polling overhead would be present.\n\n2. Peer to peer REST.  Another alternative, expressed in the &#39;Re: It&#39;s the\narchitecture, stupid.&#39; thread last month recommended multiple REST servers.\n So my client would &#39;register&#39; for updates by PUTing a URL to a service\nlistener resource at the server.  The server would then POST updates to that\nURL as they arise.  This overcomes the high polling overhead of the first\noption, though it does require a more capable client (one that can host a\nREST server - which a browser can&#39;t).\n\nAm I missing any alternative RESTful approaches to this problem?\n\r\n--001485f4508657a33d0494a0db4f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi all,&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m designing a web-based architecture - and to help future=\r\n adopters/maintainers I&#39;d like to follow REST-principles where possible=\r\n. =A0Hey, let them read the REST guidance rather than some custom-written b=\r\ny me...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m ok with REST as recommended in th=\r\ne Rest Cookbook and Restful Web Services, but have struggled to find a REST=\r\n-compliant strategy for one area:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In my distribute=\r\nd environment I have a host application that provides a list of services. =\r\n=A0Client applications are able to determine which service is of interest, =\r\nand then the client wants to receive updates related to that service.
