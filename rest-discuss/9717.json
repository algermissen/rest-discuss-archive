It does however\n&gt; insulate them from having to understand the form of your urls.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I&#39;m putting this out here for discussion, and not really\n&gt; suggesting you implement it this way. But if anyone out there thinks\n&gt; there&#39;s a good way to do what I&#39;m trying to do, which is to drive the\n&gt; interaction through forms, please jump in.\n\nYeah, not sounding terribly convincing to me.  I do think your described \nsolution is fine, as long as there really isn&#39;t a need for &#39;machine to \nmachine&#39; communication.\n\nActually, let&#39;s discuss this &#39;machine to machine&#39; communication.  I \nthink what you&#39;re actually talking about is &#39;all other forms of \nclient-server interaction for this application other than an HTML page&#39;. \n  I mention this because I get this sense that people think &#39;machine to \nmachine&#39; communication is bad, when in fact, it&#39;s quite good.  The more \nclients, the merrier.\n\nI think once you&#39;ve decided that you&#39;d like to open your &#39;server \napplication&#39; up to more than just the HTML pages you provide, you really \ndo need to describe your REST APIs *somehow* (the urls, and the data \nflowing over the wire).  We&#39;ll obviously never agree on *how*, I&#39;m not \ngoing to go so far as to suggest that&#39;s possible.  :-)\n\nHugh&#39;s right that you can glean some of this information from a \nplain-old HTML form.  Perhaps lightly enhanced via MicroFormats or some \nsuch, a form really could serve as a per-API meta-description of the API \nitself.  Interesting idea.\n\nOn the other hand, pretend that you&#39;ve actually described your APIs \n(URLs and the data that flows through them) in some kind of \nprogram-readable fashion.  From this, it would be easy to dynamically \nbuild a form, in JS on the client.  Is there a difference?\n\n-- \nPatrick Mueller\nhttp://muellerware.org\n\n\n"}}
