Via an XSLT  \n&gt; transform=\r\n, I generate from this a checking function which I call from  \n&gt; my integra=\r\ntion-test harness, once per test.\n\nThe NetBeans JAX-RS plug-in includes som=\r\nething along those lines:\n\nhttp://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/websvc/rest.html#E=\r\nxercise_3\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D_c-CCVy4_Eo\n\nBasically it dynami=\r\ncally generates HTML forms to interact with a service based on a WADL \nfile=\r\n and then parses and displays the output in a variety of formats. Links in =\r\nthe response \ncan be traversed and the test tool will attempt to dynamicall=\r\ny fetch a WADL for each linked \nresource to enable you to walk through the =\r\napplication without needing a pre-cooked \n&quot;uber-WADL&quot; that describes everyt=\r\nhing.\n\nMarc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
