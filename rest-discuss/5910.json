In WebDAV,\n&gt; that&#39;s one single request.\n\nFor larg=\r\ne collections that single request could overwhelm a client, the APP\nuses a =\r\nchained set of Atom Feeds to return all that information, with each\nfeed co=\r\nntaining some subset of collection members and also containing\na link eleme=\r\nnt with the URI of the &#39;next&#39; feed in the chain.\n\n   -joe\n\n--\nJoe Gregorio =\r\n       http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
