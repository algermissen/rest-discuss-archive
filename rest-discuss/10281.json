But I&#39;m instead talking about &quot;standardizing&quot; a meta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approach; IOW a method for traversing web services that 5\n&gt; &gt; years from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now could be built into browsers because it gained\n&gt; &gt; widespread usage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to see a well-known way to publish that they are\n&gt; &gt; &quot;n&quot; number\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of services available, here are their local identifiers, their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; URLs/URI Templates, and here are the content types they\n&gt; &gt; return.  Local\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identifiers might be things like &quot;shopping-cart&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;add-item&quot;, &quot;empty-cart&quot;, and so on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t that the responsibility of HTML?\n&gt;\n&gt; Uh, it can be. But riddle me this; given an abitrary HTML document, how does\n&gt; my client figure out what URL is the &quot;add-item&quot; URL?  Or the &quot;empty-cart&quot;\n&gt; URL?  Or, or, or...?\n\nAnd do what with it?  If your client is able to add an item to an\nAmazon shopping cart, that&#39;s because it&#39;s designed around the Amazon\nshopping cart semantics, part of what it knows is how to find the\nadd-item URL, maybe by CSS selecting it from HTML, running XPath\nagainst XML, navigating the object tree in JSON, etc.  If the client\nis me, I just read the English that shows up on the HTML page.\n\n&gt; HTML (or JSON, or Atom, or, or, or...) are necessary, but not sufficient.\n\nI agree, I just don&#39;t see that as a browser problem.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Things that work _also_ for the enterprise, like PHP or\n&gt; &gt; MySQL, tend to be very cheap.  Things that work _only_ for\n&gt; &gt; the enterprise, like J2EE and Oracle, tend to be more\n&gt; &gt; expensive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Funny you say that, I&#39;ve never done any J2EE or Oracle work, ever.\n&gt; Everything I&#39;ve worked has been lightweight, scripting, and dynamic\n&gt; languages and I drive towards simple, not complex.  Matter of fact, I just\n&gt; gave a presentation on debugging PHP and MySQL at the Atlanta Drupal users\n&gt; group last Tuesday[1], and I&#39;ve been programming exclusively PHP and MySQL\n&gt; for the past six months, experimented with Python+Sqlite, Ruby on Rails, and\n&gt; Powershell for the year prior, and mostly ASP+VBScript+SQL Server for the\n&gt; 10+ years to that. So your assumptions about what I&#39;m advocating are off.\n&gt; :-)\n\nI wasn&#39;t making a person statement on you, and apologize that it came\nacross that way.\n\nI&#39;m making an observation that if you take something like Oracle\nthat&#39;s designed for the enterprise, it ends up being used only in the\nenterprise.  If you take something like MySQL that&#39;s designed to be\nused everywhere, it ends up being used everywhere including the\nenterprise.  It&#39;s not so much inside vs outside, as some people thing,\nbut rather walled vs everywhere.\n\nWearing my enterprise hat, I would strongly favor everywhere\ntechnology even for use inside the enterprise, and one of the reasons\nI&#39;m not particularly big on WS-* these days is because WS-* is walled\ntechnology.\n\n&gt; &gt; What we did is say, the semantics of your task list is that\n&gt; &gt; tasks have certain required and optional values, and certain\n&gt; &gt; state transitions, and preconditions and such, and certain\n&gt; &gt; related resources, and also they&#39;re directly accessible from\n&gt; &gt; your user id.  The semantics of attachments is that they have\n&gt; &gt; certain required and optional values, and certain state\n&gt; &gt; transitions, and so forth, but can exist anywhere in the\n&gt; &gt; cloud and can only be reached from a task.\n&gt;\n&gt; With those paragraphs, you&#39;ve lost me.  I mean I can understand at a high\n&gt; level but I doubt I&#39;d end up with the same implementation you&#39;d mean.  So\n&gt; that I can understand what you are saying I think what I&#39;d need to see are\n&gt; specifics i.e. URLs, URI Templates, and any the representations of content\n&gt; types that provide navigation.\n\n1. Let&#39;s say the URL template for a collection of pending tasks resources is:\n\n{base}/person/{name}/pending\n\nThere&#39;s a few content type descriptions, the XML one will say (abbreviated):\n\n&lt;tasks&gt;\n  &lt;task&gt;\n    . . .\n    &lt;attachments&gt; ... &lt;/attachments&gt;\n  &lt;/task&gt;*\n&lt;/tasks&gt;\n\nSo now you have an entry point that, given an account name, let&#39;s you\nfind all the pending tasks for that person, which returns a list of\ntasks.\n\n2.  Separately it specifies a collection of resources dealing with\nattachments, which doesn&#39;t have a URL template, but has a content type\ndescription, again briefly:\n\n&lt;attachments&gt;\n  &lt;attachment&gt;\n     ...\n     &lt;url&gt; ... &lt;/url&gt;\n  &lt;/attchment&gt;\n&lt;/attachments&gt;\n\nAnd specifies that the attachment element up above (in #1) is a URL to\na resource from that collection, so you know that navigating there\nwill get you the list of attachments for a given task.\n\n3.  Separately it specifies a collection of resources for attachments\nthemselves, and specifies that the url element above (in #2) is a URL\nto a resource from that collection.\n\nSo now you can write a client that given a name can download all the\nattachments for that person&#39;s pending tasks.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://drupal.meetup.com/4/calendar/6779397/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n-- Assaf\n\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n"}}
