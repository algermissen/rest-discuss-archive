At the end of the day, a \n&gt; user is presented with a web page. It&#39;s still a duck.\n\nI beg to differ.  The Web Frameworks landscape is filled with landmines...\n\n&gt; Sure, it may just be ego-gratification, but it&#39;s also\n&gt; about sharing ideas too. Unfortunately, this is\n&gt; apparently something you seem to disagree with. \n\nI have no problem with sharing ideas. But just as Roy Fielding does not\nbelieve it is a good thing for a GET to change state, I do not believe it is\na good thing to have lots of libraries and frameworks offered with what\namounts to arbitrarily differences. I think it should be a best practice to\nhave *consideration* for prior art and not to duplicate prior art if there\nare no obvious benefits.  I think the unnecessary fragmentation of libraries\nand frameworks holds back progress. \n\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with coding to learn and share ideas. But when YAF\n(Yet Another Framework) gets promoted for no obvious benefit with no\ninteroperability with others, that&#39;s when I see harm occuring. As it is the\nnature of the programmer to reinvent the wheel, I think there needs to be\npeople who make this point as a counterbalance, i.e. to say &quot;You really\nshould try not to do this unless it is really needed.&quot;  Please note I&#39;ve\nmade no judgement on whether your project&#39;s differences are really needed as\nI don&#39;t have the expertise to judge the specifics. I&#39;m just calling the\nquestion.\n\nOne of my many planned projects is to write a book on this topic. Or at\nleast a thesis. :)\n\n&gt; I folks\n&gt; like Gavin King didn&#39;t gratify their egos, there wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be Hibernate or EJB3 in its current form. Its the\n&gt; communication and presentation of new ideas that lead up\n&gt; to a pretty decent API. And even though there is a Java\n&gt; Persistence standard, you there are still other options\n&gt; out there.\n\nNothing wrong with sharing ideas, its divergent implementations that start\nto cause the problem.  \n\nOn the flip side, is there anything wrong with discussing your ideas with\npeople who have similar projects so as to attempt to find common ground for\ninteroperability?   \n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\nP.S. I would hope that you&#39;d listen my concerns rather than get defensive,\nthe latter of which doesn&#39;t do either of us any good.\n\n\n"}}
