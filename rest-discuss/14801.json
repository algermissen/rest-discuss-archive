REST is much more that usi=\r\nng HTTP and using Hypermedia as an Engine\nto control State. That means, the=\r\nre are several other constrains. The\nHyperMedia use is just one of the four=\r\n constrains needed to achieve the\nuse of an universal interface.\n\n2. Hyperm=\r\nedia constrain is there because REST was aimed to be a style\nfor systems in=\r\n a networked environment whose main interaction is the\ntransfer of large hy=\r\npermedia documents.  I had thought always that, if\nyou are not into that ki=\r\nnd of system, you should not use REST as it is,\nbut you may use a derivativ=\r\ne.\n\n3. REST is a style, detailed with the reasoning of each constrain, whic=\r\nh\nmeans you can identify which constrains work for your work and use them.\n=\r\nYou may be using then a subset of the style, perfectly fine, and fits\nwith =\r\nyour application. But your application is not, then RESTFull.\n\n4. So, what =\r\nyou see is not only people forgetting about the Hypermedia\nconstrain, but a=\r\nctually using subsets of the style they need. The name\nyou suggest to look =\r\nfor is then not related to the lack of Hypermedia\nthingies, but of an incom=\r\nplete use of REST.\n\nThan brings me to the actual problem that faces what yo=\r\nu are proposing:\nIt may be too many names!\nActually, some may be completely=\r\n new styles aimed to different things.\nI can use representational style of =\r\nresources, without stating the\nworkflow as a State. It may be transactional=\r\n and atomic. It may be the\nRETA.\n\nOr, we can use the State Machine for work=\r\nflow, but using RPC as the step\nunit.  YOu have SMARPC.\n\nWhat about the one=\r\ns that use REST as CRUD, but with resources? CRUDRES\nIf someone is not usin=\r\ng Hypemedias as the state machine supported, it\nmay be they are not using s=\r\ntate machine at all. I have seem apis that\nare more like RPC. So, it is Rep=\r\nresentational, no State, no Transfer,\nbut RPC. RERPC.\n\nAnd what if they hav=\r\ne state machine workflow on server? No Hypermedia.\nThat is the tricky one, =\r\nsince the REST name fits, only that it is not\nintended for hypermedia trans=\r\nfer, but for transactions. RESTX may be the\nname.\netc.\n\nSo, and that is som=\r\nething I was planning to mention in a post when\nhaving some time, we may ac=\r\ntually review the needs of the applications\nand define a style, based on RE=\r\nST, that may fit my app needs, instead of\nforcing the app to support REST j=\r\nust to have that name in the credits. \nWe may find there are less that a do=\r\nzen totally different styles, all\nREST children, but with a name on their o=\r\nwn. With all the rationale on\nhow to use them, it may be a great help for a=\r\nll those that are not quite\nthere yet.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n--- In r=\r\nest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen\n&lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Given that the creation of APIs that ignore the hypermedia constraint\nis=\r\n undeniably an ongoing activity wouldn&#39;t it be nice to give those a\nname in=\r\n order to differentiate them from RESTful APIs?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that it can in =\r\nvarious circumstances be argued to be to have\nHTTP based APIs that define s=\r\nome URI layout and maybe only use generic\nmedia types. It is certainly more=\r\n useful than doing the same API with\nRMI, SOAP or CORBA.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, given=\r\n there is no name for them, they simple become\n&#39;REST-APIs&#39; which obfuscates=\r\n the fact that systems using those APIs will\n*not* have the properties indu=\r\nced by REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we name them, differentiation between the two becomes a=\r\n lot easier.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What I lack is a compelling name that sounds cool enough=\r\n so API owners\ncan still be proud even if they are not (yet) in the REST-Ol=\r\nymp of\nthings :-) ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP-base APIs\n&gt; Fixed-URI-APIs\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Both *not* cool....\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt;\n&gt;  Mail: algerm=\r\nissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.nordsc.c=\r\nom/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
