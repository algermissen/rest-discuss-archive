Possibly not David&#39;s\neither. Not sure who might find it useful.     B^)\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    GET /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;ll still have to generate the URI on the client - why not just use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;/artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson&quot; directly?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because &quot;/artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson&quot; does not exist. It is an\n&gt; unvalidated\n&gt; &gt; URI manufactured by an external User Agent from an entry in a\n&gt; phone book.\n&gt; &gt; The URI on the Origin Server is &quot;/artist/LisaSimpson&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Huh? The original suggestion of /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson is an\n&gt; unvalidated URI manufactured by an external user-agent also. The\n&gt; &quot;?&quot; doesn&#39;t make it special.\n\nWell IMHO it does. At least as far as the design I am proposing.\nThe question mark makes it a query. The query is directed to a URI\nthat expects name/value pairs to be appended to it&#39;s URI by the\nUser Agent. This is very HTML-forms-ish.\n\nThis is a guess.\n\n    GET /artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n\nA wrong guess at that. It should return a 400 error code.\n\nThis is a query.\n\n   GET /find-artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n\nIt may return a redirect to the following URI which does exist,\notherwise it will return a 400 error.\n\n   /artist/LisaSimpson\n\nIt is different from the following query that returns a,\npossibly empty, list of references to artists.\n\n   GET /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n\nI think that the important part is that the client expects\ndifferent results from different URIs.\n/find-artist?... returns a redirect to one artist or an error code\nwhile /artist?... returns a possibly empty list of artists matching\nthe query. The former is used for resolving generated URIs, the\nlatter is used for filtering the available artists.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
