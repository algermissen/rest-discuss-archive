Costello&quot;\n&lt;costello@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many thanks for your replies.  I am still assimilating your\ncomments.\n&gt; A question arose in my mind as I read the comments from Mike and\nJan:\n&gt; To what level should the &quot;rules for constructing resource\nidentifiers&quot; be\n&gt; hidden from clients?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Allow me to elaborate upon this question.\n&gt; Consider these fundamental REST tenets:\n&gt; 1. A Web site is comprised of resources.\n&gt; 2. Each resource has an identifier, i.e., a URL\n&gt; 3. A client uses an identifier to retrieve a resource.  \n&gt; 3.1 Corollary: if a client doesn&#39;t have the identifier then he can&#39;t\nget the\n&gt; resource.\n\n=================================\nYes, but not a problem The client has the URL of _another_ resource\nthat can get the resource he wants. \n\nSo while a URL is often a static page, it also can be a program that\nasks the user questions. In that case the client _must_ know how to\naccess the URL of the program. So what you say is true, but that is no\nbarrier to information access. \n\n[It&#39;s like real life: I may not know how to program in Common Lisp,\nbut if i have a question I know that I can ask Joe Smith (Common Lisp\nguru) for information. He will then ask me questions and give me the \nanswer.]\n\nIOW the client need not know _how_ URLs are constructed, but needs to\nknow the appropriate URL(s) to get information. The client fills out a\nform by describing what he wants, a program on the web server accepts\nthat form and returns an answer. The  program may optionally assign a\nbookmarkable URL to that resource.\n=================================\n\n&gt; 4. &quot;A form is a way to generate a resource identifier based on user\ninput.&quot;\n&gt; [Mike]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jan spoke about the importance of ensuring that clients are\ndecoupled from a\n&gt; Web site.  [Paraphrasing] If a client uses information about how a\nWeb site\n&gt; structures its resources (i.e., the Web site&#39;s domain model) then\nthe client\n&gt; is coupling itself to the Web site - if the Web site reorganizes its\n&gt; resources then the client&#39;s applications will break.  [Jan, have I\n&gt; summarized your argument correctly?]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Isn&#39;t there a paradox here?  On the one hand, identifiers to\nresources must\n&gt; be made available, else clients can&#39;t access the resources.  On the\nother\n&gt; hand too much knowledge of resource identifiers leads to coupling.\n\n=================================\nYes, but remember the definition of a paradox. IOW this is not a\nlogical contradiction. It is a warning to construct sites so they can\nbe changed w/o interrupting the user. \n=================================\n\n&gt; In my original message I proposed that a Web site make visible to\nclients\n&gt; this hierarchical model of resources:\n&gt; Mission\n&gt;     Plan1\n&gt;          ...\n&gt;     Plan2\n&gt;         Aircraft\n&gt;             AA36\n&gt;                 ...\n&gt;             BB06\n&gt;                 Payload\n&gt;                     Bomb1\n&gt;                         ...\n&gt;                     Bomb2\n&gt;                         Fuze5\n&gt;  \n&gt; My intent is that clients can utilize this hierarchical model to\nconstruct\n&gt; resource identifiers - a client can retrieve any resource in this\nhierarchy\n&gt; by simply creating an XPath expression to the desired resource.  For\n&gt; example, to retrieve BB06 in Plan2 the client would construct this\n&gt; identifier:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://[hostname]/mission/plan2/aircraft/BB06\n&gt;  \n&gt; Has this Web site exposed too much of its model?  Have I exposed too\nmuch of\n&gt; the rules for constructing resource identifiers?  Will clients\nbecome\n&gt; dangerously coupled?  \n\n=================================\nIf it is adequate to the users and you don&#39;t change the site, there\nshould be no problems. But see below.\n\n&gt; To what level should the rules for constructing identifiers be\nexposed by a\n&gt; Web site?  To what level should they be hidden?  Is it the purpose\nof forms\n&gt; to shield clients from the rules for constructing identifiers?  \n\nURIs should be opaque. You may want to look at \n&quot;The Opacity Axiom&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque\n\nThe opacity axiom apparently does not apply to the querystring portion\nof a URL.\n\nOne concern with non-opaque URLs (or the non-opaque portion of URLs in\nthe case of querystring variables) is security. E.g., in an intranet,\nupon seeing their employee number in a URL, the first thing employees\nwill do is cut and paste their boss&#39;s or friend&#39;s employee number and\ntry to access info they shouldn&#39;t. Non-opaque URIs seem to promote\ncracking behavior in everyone. \n\nBut many sites have URLs that are (at least partially) not opaque and,\nsince they never change and are securely managed, are very happy. And,\nif there is a change, you can always write server-side code that maps\nthe old URLs to new ones, either transparently or not.\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
