When you look at an example\n\nIn a reply (October 3rd 2006) Roy provided the following example:\n\n&quot;Think of it this way: your browser receives\ntwo messages, one says it is application/quicken and the other says\nit is application/logfile. Both have identical content consisting\nof an invoice. Should your browser assume that both should be\nprocessed as an invoice just because they have the same content?\nWhy should the browser behave any differently if the data format\nhappens to be an instance of XML?&quot;\n\nThis quote implies an orthogonality between media type and XML schema  \nthat is just not applied in existing media type specifications. When  \nviewed this way, media type specifications would need to define a  \nprocessing expectation and reference one or more applicable message  \nschemas.\n\nI like this view because it allows forms like AtomPub&#39;s &lt;accept&gt;  \nelement to be much more expressive: that a resource accepts  \napplication/xhtml+xml does not really reveal much in terms of choosing  \nan appropriate state transition, whereas &lt;accept&gt;application/order&lt;/ \naccept&gt; does. (Assuming that the defined processing expectation is  \n&#39;look at that order and let me know if you will fullfill it or not.\n\nIt would also prevent media type explosion when dealing with more  \ndiverse (enterprise) domain types[1] than found in the HTML-Web world.\n\nOTH this view contradicts the common (AFAIU) understanding that media  \ntypes represent a series of compatible schemas.\n\nClues?\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] Thinking of Account, Party, Product, Contract,... - people often  \nseem to want to make up a media type for each one of them, which is  \nIMHO not the right way to apply media types to the enterprise domain.\n\n\n\nOn Jun 6, 2009, at 8:07 PM, johnzabroski wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen  \n&gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Roy,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in a number of postings you write, that you did not in depth cover  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; topic of media type design in your dissertation.

If he feels he left something important  \n&gt; out of it, why not go back and &quot;complete&quot; it?
