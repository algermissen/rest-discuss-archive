Restrict yourself to the HTTP methods as the verbs for your \n&gt;&gt; webservice, eg:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET     get the resource\n&gt;&gt; POST    create a new resource\n&gt;&gt; PUT     edit the resource\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; This is good advice, and the above seems to be what one would generally \n&gt; expect, more or less. Depending on the application, POST may have \n&gt; alternate semantics and, assuming the client knows where things are \n&gt; supposed to go or owns the URI space (e.g. operations within a users own \n&gt; account area), PUT may be used for resource creation.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DELETE  move the resource\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; What? That&#39;s just crazy. How did DELETE suddenly become MOVE? Would you \n&gt; then need to use POST for DELETE? Seems not so good to me, but if you \n&gt; aren&#39;t willing to support WebDAV methods for namespace operations than \n&gt; this might be acceptable, if slightly unorthodox.\n\nSorry.\n\nI didn&#39;t mean &quot;move&quot; I meant &quot;remove&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m affraid my attention was actually on wallance and grommit&#39;s wrong\ntrousers.\n\n\n\n&gt; This has been, to some extent, a personal crusade of mine -- to get \n&gt; people to realize that REST is more than GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. \n&gt; There are other methods available whendeveloping REST applications \n&gt; within the framework of the Web; MOVE,  COPY and MKCOL for namespace \n&gt; operations, PROPPATCH and PROPFIND for working with resource metadata, \n&gt; LOCK and UNLOCK for managing access to resources, etc.\n\nI strongly disagree that this is the case. I don&#39;t believe WEBDAV\nmethods are necessary or even advisable for REST based apps.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
