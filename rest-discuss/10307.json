It&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gem for file uploading:  The browser &quot;posts&quot; a url (saying &quot;here&#39;s where I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have the images), and the server then: Sends a &quot;get&quot; to that url, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; retrieves a document containing URLs to all of the individual files.  The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; server then simply &quot;gets&quot; each of those files from the urls indicated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (retrieving them from the browser-acting-as-server).  This the REST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; client-server constraint on its head (P2P rest, as you said), but even Roy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; F. hinted at such a &quot;relaxation&quot; being an interesting approach [1].\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very cool. But how often do corporate firewalls block incoming HTTP/Port 80\n&gt; &gt; requests to &quot;unofficial&quot; IP addresses? I thought it was quite common; which\n&gt; &gt; means the technique wouldn&#39;t work for the sizable population accessing the\n&gt; &gt; web from behind corporate firewalls.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know much about how firewalls are typically configured, but one\n&gt; nice thing about the POW extension is that you get to decide which port\n&gt; it&#39;ll run on as part of the configuration, which is fine since you get to\n&gt; tell the server-as-client where to make the request.  It would be ideal if\n&gt; POW only opened the port for the short period of time necessary and then\n&gt; shut down again.\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw Stefano Mazzocchi give a talk at ApacheCon (2006??) about a project\n&gt; at MIT called PiggyBank [0], which also runs a server (Jetty, I believe)\n&gt; in the browser. I wonder what sort of issues they have run into re:\n&gt; firewalls, etc.  I know that the person behind POW was using it to develop\n&gt; a rich, searchable browsing history for the user which is similar, in some\n&gt; general way, to the goals of PiggyBank.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it&#39;s only the browser that talks to PiggyBank,\nso the only ports open are listening on 127.0.0.1.  No inbound, no\nfirewall issues.\n\nYou have to keep in mind two barriers.  One the firewall itself, and\nthose are more common than you think, check your operating system,\nhighly likely that you&#39;re running a firewall.  Second, NAT, your\nmachine is most likely not reachable from the outside world for\nopening new connections.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [0] http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/94/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- Nick\n&gt; &gt;\n\n"}}
