I can even call OPTIONS on the resource first to see \n&gt;&gt; if it allows me to alter the order.  For new orders, GET and PUT can be \n&gt;&gt; returned.  For canceled or shipped orders, just GET is returned.  And at \n&gt;&gt; any time I can GET /orders/new, /orders/canceled, /orders/shipped, etc.  \n&gt;&gt; Trying to alter any of those resources returns 405 Method Not Allowed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, I can see making things like /canceled etc. writable, if your \n&gt;&gt; requirement was to treat an order cancellation as a thing unto itself \n&gt;&gt; (Wall St. probably works that way), and you wanted to allow users to \n&gt;&gt; track a cancellation and allow the business to report easily on \n&gt;&gt; cancellations.  But that doesn&#39;t seem to work here, where an order can \n&gt;&gt; &quot;move itself&quot; into other states, like shipped.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, where did I go off the rails?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; There is nothing wrong with a collection changing in-between\n&gt; GETs. CANCELLED and SHIPPED bins are shared resources and unless a client\n&gt; can have exclusive control over them, it simply has to expect that\n&gt; they may change without its knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; YS.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nThat I understand.  I guess I wasn&#39;t clear.  To restate. \n\nWe have a resource called an order which can be in several states: new, \nshipped, canceled (I&#39;ll ignore the rest).  That gives us at least three \nresource collections /new-orders, /canceled-orders, and /shipped-orders \n(or /orders, /orders/canceled, /orders/shipped or ...).  Stefan \nrecommends that if a user wants to cancel an order they should post the \nURI of the new (open) order to the /canceled-orders resource, and the \nserver &quot;moves&quot; the order from the new bucket to the canceled bucket.  \nWhereas my instinct is to model the order with a status field, GET the \norder, change the status, and PUT it back.  Leaving /canceled-orders and \n/shipped-orders to be read-only, convenience resources.\n\nI can see two reasons for doing it Stefan&#39;s way.  1.  If canceling and \nshipping an shipping an order are unique business processes.  For \ninstance, if it is required that a &quot;cancel order&quot; request be submitted \n(and thus be trackable), and the request itself is a resource, which can \nin turn be approved/disapproved, retrieved, etc.  2.  To support, as \nStefan noted, the ability to locate the various resources/services on \nseparate servers without any backend dependencies (e.g., a database).  \nBoth of these are valid, but neither are automatic.  So my question \nagain, is there anything wrong with my seemingly straightforward means \nof altering the status of an order or is it just another, legitimate, \nway of doing things?\n\n- Pete\n\n"}}
