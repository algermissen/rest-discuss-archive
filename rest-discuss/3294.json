[...]  What do you expect to receive back?  Are you expecting to\n&gt; receive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS\n&gt; response?\n\nI guess that&#39;s the point of OPTIONS, I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;d get\nback.  If it&#39;s a WSDL, there are tools that can parse it directly; if\nit&#39;s a text description, there&#39;s more work to do.  But in any case,\none could ask exactly the same questions about the metadata even if\nit were a separate resource.\n\nGranted, OPTIONS is sort of a dark corner of the web right now, but\nas metadata becomes more important with the advent of web services,\nperhaps it won&#39;t be always be.\n\n&gt; But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,\n&gt; e.g.,\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?\n&gt;\n&gt; Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide\n&gt; metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink\n&gt; to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your\n&gt; company wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF\n&gt; description of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go\n&gt; off and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here&#39;s\n&gt; your URL:\n&gt;\n&gt;      http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata\n\nInstead of having some third party host the metadata - which will inevitably\nget out of synch with the resource who&#39;s metadata it is (the\nOPTIONS method is explicitly non-cacheable for probably just that reason) -\nwhy not just have a link to the resource itself:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts&quot;&gt;Car Parts Web Service&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGoogle would scoop that up even easier.  When you do a search for &quot;Car Parts\nWeb Service&quot;, if enough people have linked to it, it will probably bubble\nup to the top anyway.  In either case, you&#39;ll be lead to the service itself,\nthen you request the OPTIONS and away you go.\n\n&gt; Now you need some way to link your service description back to the parts\n&gt; service.  That&#39;s the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.\n&gt;\n&gt; To recap,\n&gt; - we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate\n&gt; from the resource it is describing.\n\nFrankly, I prefer the metadata to be tightly bound to the resource it\nis describing.\n\n&gt; - we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,\n&gt; i.e., distributed resource description\n\nI think this an interesting point, but I&#39;m not sure that it really matters\nso long as you are able to ultimately locate the resource.  Again, it&#39;s\nfine for others to host the metadata, but they are going to have to be\nresponsible for keeping it in synch and it might be skipped over by a\nnormal search engine that&#39;s more interested in the text (or the\nlinks in Google&#39;s case.)\n\n&gt; - we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its\n&gt; (primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is\n&gt; describing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About\n&gt; HTTP headers, respectively.\n\nOnly if you separate them, which granted, is the case today in most\ncases.\n\n&gt; - we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata\n&gt; resources using standard HTTP GET.\n\nI&#39;m not sure any search engines out there would even parse\nand attempt to understand what the metadata even is.  I think my\nexample above is much more likely to find the service and lead you\nto the metadata.\n\nThis to me is one of the more insightful statements I&#39;ve read in\na while:\n\n&quot;On the other hand, I must say that for me in daily life, Google allows\nall sorts of useful queries that 5 years ago I thought  would\nrequire the widespread adoption of XML and XML-based format standards\n(e.g., for resumes).  Certainly many of the claims/proposals of metadata\nadvocates 5 years ago look a bit shopworn in hindsight now that we\nsee how well Google does by ignoring all (most?) metadata other than the\nlinking patterns.&quot; [1]\n\n&gt; I hope that helps.  /Roger\n\nIt does.  I think your right on the money with having web service discovery\nbe a distributed, search-engine based activity as opposed to the UDDI\napproach. I just think that current technologies already support this\nwithout\nthe need to employ extension headers.\n\n[1] http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200210/msg01625.html\n\n\n"}}
