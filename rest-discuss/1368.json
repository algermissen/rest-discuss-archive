In fact, say\n&gt;  &gt; Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Lynda Hardman and Lloyd Rutledge, the\n&gt;  &gt; primary model for many hypermedia systems is directly applicable to\n&gt;  &gt; the Semantic Web. Hypermedia systems are, basically, structured\n&gt;  &gt; databases (in various media -- audio, video, etc.) with pieces of\n&gt;  &gt; information (called nodes) and links to related pieces of\n&gt;  &gt; information.  These systems typically denote link access points or\n&gt;  &gt; link &quot;anchors&quot; in some manner within a node when it&#39;s displayed on a\n&gt;  &gt; computer screen, such as underlined text displayed within documents\n&gt;  &gt; on the Web. In order to annotate a specific portion of a Web\n&gt;  &gt; resource, it needs an anchoring mechanism, and to establish a\n&gt;  &gt; relationship between the annotation and the target resource, a\n&gt;  &gt; linking model is necessary. Such elements will be paramount in the\n&gt;  &gt; development of the Semantic Web, say the researchers.
