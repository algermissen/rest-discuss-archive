I mean,\n&gt; &gt; what benefit should it actually bringt?\n&gt; \n&gt; You gain a API that has better granularity than simply CRUD. Yes,\n&gt; inevitably, you end up doing pure &quot;atomic&quot; CRUD against, say, a SQL\n&gt; database. But there&#39;s no reason you should be forced to exposed that\n&gt; limited of an API to your clients. You should be able to have higher\n&gt; level interactions with your sever than just raw CRUD, actions that\n&gt; themselves may manifest into sever primitive hits against your data\n&gt; store.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point of the Common Interface isn&#39;t so much to hamstring\n&gt; applications in to a pure CRUD HTTP view of the world, but rather to\n&gt; help ensure you don&#39;t simply run off hog wild creating eleventy\n&gt; zillion new verbs. Taking a constrained, conservative view at the verb\n&gt; layer and how they&#39;re used can make the API easier to use, and more\n&gt; approachable, rather than a wiener dog nest of exceptions and special\n&gt; cases and what ifs. Consistent application of a consistent, common\n&gt; interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re limited solely to CRUD.\n\nWhile our application is highly complex and in pre-REST times was using lots\nof very special RPC methods, I do actually not feel &quot;constrained&quot; by CRUD,\nalso CRUD does not mean that you must have a 1:1 mapping of each request to\nexactly one  database penetration.\n\nExample:\n\nOur software allow to create &quot;inspection orders&quot; from &quot;inspection order\ntemplates&quot;. Such a template or instance contains lots of very deep children\nand thousands of data fields. While one is free to do nearly anything in a\ntemplate, if you want to make an instance from a template, you have to pass\na very complex validation which includes hundreds of rules on a lot of the\nfields in all of the child object. It is one of the most complex algorithms\nI&#39;ve ever seen with thousands of LoC. It includes such a lot of database\nrequests that it must work completely on the server to be fast enough.\n\nIn RPC times, this was done as one bug stored procedure, reading lots of\nrows, and writing lots of rows. All the caller had to do was &quot;CALL\nCreateInspectionFromTemplate(ID)&quot;. What a simple API.\n\nNow we turn it to REST. The server is unchanged: It still calls the same\nSQL. We just added a RESTful layer ontop of it. To execute the (nearly) same\nprocedure, you now will just do:\n\nGET /templates/{id}\nPOST /orders/\n\nThis triggers the stored procedure, runs all the thousands of lines of code,\nand creates the object on the database. What you&#39;ll get back is an URI of\nthe from /order/{id} for the newly created instance (the root of the tree of\nrows created in the database forming the instance created from the\ntemplate), and a validation result (XML, either beeing empty, or containing\na lot of validation faults).\n\nSo CRUD does not mean to create exactly one row, or to not being able to\nexecute highly complex transactions. As you can see, I can execute a complex\nalgorithm running on thousands of database rows, creating even more\nthousands, and thus performance a very complex business task, with a simple\nCRUD operation, without the need for &quot;RPC-like&quot; names or URIs.\n\nTHAT&#39;s why I said, why not doing CRUD? :-)\n\nRegards\nMarkus\n\n\n"}}
