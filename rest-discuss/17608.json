The request=\r\n for the resource was NOT successful.\nYes, the client was able to reach the=\r\n server and the server was able to return a response, so the HTTP communica=\r\ntion was successful. But the request was not. If it was, the client would h=\r\nave bypassed authentication.\n\nIt does not really matter how it works behind=\r\n the scenes. If you&#39;re doing REST, getting a resource without proper authen=\r\ntication should return 401.\n\n&gt; JavaScript is then used to validate the JSON=\r\n to see if it was successful.  I would like to just confirm with you as it =\r\nis difficult finding any material on a web browser using a controller. All =\r\nthe examples and books I have read are clients/browser talking directly to =\r\nthe web services.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t make any difference, as I argued before.\n\n&gt;=\r\n If a client is talking to the web services directly then we will return 40=\r\n1 with a message of validation failed.\n\nWhy would you want to act different=\r\nly?\nWell, you can=85 but then it&#39;s not REST.\n\nCan you clarify the function =\r\nof the controller? Why is it in between, and is this necessary at all?\n\nChe=\r\ners,\n\nRuben\n"}}
