HTTP&#39;s REST replaces the\n&gt; doSomething concept with a &quot;make something so&quot; concept. If you think\n&gt; about it, all doSomething can be modelled this way. Instead of &quot;make\n&gt; this kind of state transition&quot;, just &quot;make your state this&quot;. You have to\n&gt; get into specific examples to see how this works. The first example of\n&gt; starting or stopping a function is the same as setting a running\n&gt; resource to false or true. Do you have more examples in mind? What kind\n&gt; of process would you like to create?\n\nwhat about passing parameters, like &#39;start at date&#39;? or &#39;start at date with X resources&#39;? the first can be modeled by setting &#39;date&#39; to a &#39;schedule&#39; property of the service. but how can the second? \n\nalso, many suggestions, while very good in themselves mean that the rest API is no longer just a gateway to the system&#39;s functionality. it enforces the system to be built in a certain way (like creating &#39;process&#39; resources that can be monitored and canceled). while rest is an excellent approach to API, systems are usually designed by object-oriented, procedural or functional approaches. \n\nwhat i would love to see is a separation of API and model, in the same sense as MVC. i want to construct my system with whatever approach is suitable for me and then be able to provide a restful API to it, without having it break my system model.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The general approach to process creation would either be:\n&gt; POST a representation of the process to a factory resource to create it.\n&gt; PUT a representation of the process to the process resource to change\n&gt; its operation.\n&gt; DELETE the process to destroy it.\n&gt; PUT a false to the process&#39;s &quot;running&quot; resource to suspend it.\n&gt; etc ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n-- \n===================================\nIttay Dror, \nChief architect, \nR&D, Qlusters Inc.\nittayd@...\n+972-3-6081994 Fax: +972-3-6081841\n\nwww.openqrm.org - Data Center Provisioning\n\n"}}
