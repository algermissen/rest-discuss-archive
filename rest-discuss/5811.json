After that timeout, the  \n&gt;&gt; client will clear the authentication for that realm. Each time  \n&gt;&gt; they hit the site and I send back the auth prompt, I can move the  \n&gt;&gt; timeout forward.\n&gt;&gt; 2) Send in a response a directive to clear the authentication at a  \n&gt;&gt; particular realm. This allows me to have a log out button  \n&gt;&gt; integrated in the UI of the site.\n&gt;&gt; 3) Send in the prompt a requirement that the user has to enter the  \n&gt;&gt; credentials again, even if the authentication session hasn&#39;t  \n&gt;&gt; expired, which enables me to make sure the real user didn&#39;t walk  \n&gt;&gt; away and leave the browser logged in at a public terminal before I  \n&gt;&gt; let them do something like look at and edit their personal data.\n&gt;\n&gt; You do realize you don&#39;t have #1-3 now with cookies, right? The  \n&gt; server does not control the client&#39;s behavior. The server can  \n&gt; suggest to the client that it do these things, but it is by no  \n&gt; means guaranteed that it will do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; In practice, today, most existing widely deployed browsers cache  \n&gt; passwords and usernames in such a way that timeouts are essentially  \n&gt; irrelevant. Even if the server times out an authentication cookie,  \n&gt; if I sit down in front of an unlocked screen with an open browser I  \n&gt; can log right back in again. The browser will helpfully fill in the  \n&gt; username and password again.\n&gt;\nYes, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought about browser caching of  \npasswords, but I do realize that passwords can be obtained in any  \nnumber of ways. Having them cached by the browser is one, but people  \noften write them down next to their PCs, enter them into spoofed  \nlogin pages, forget to log out before walking away from a public  \ncomputer, etc. What I at least do have with cookies is a protocol  \nthat allows the server to ask for the session to timeout, be cleared,  \nor have credentials reentered. Either way it is a numbers game. If I  \nask via cookies for the browser to expire the session and only 50% of  \nclients comply, then there&#39;s not much difference between that and  \nHTTP Auth if 50% of the time people close their browsers when they  \nare done. But my expectation is that I&#39;ll do better with cookies  \nbecause I can ask.\n\n&gt; The only control over this is, as it should be, at the client side.  \n&gt; The client can choose not to store the user name and password; and  \n&gt; the client can also choose to securely lock or erase the usernames  \n&gt; and passwords for a site. However the server can&#39;t do this and is  \n&gt; never going to be able to.\n&gt;\nUltimately users are responsible for keeping their password secret.  \nBut many users aren&#39;t very sophisticated about security, and even  \nthough a server can&#39;t control what a client does when the server asks  \n1, 2, or 3, I would prefer that there&#39;s a protocol, because I would  \nexpect it to work most of the time.\n\nCan&#39;t I say autocomplete=off or false in a login form for, example,  \nto prevent the browser from filling in a cached password? It doesn&#39;t  \nmean the client will do it, but if it is part of a widely adopted de  \nfacto or de jura standard, I&#39;d expect most of the time it would work.  \nSame as for cookie timeouts and clearing. In the case of HTTP Auth,  \nthere currently isn&#39;t a way for the server to ask in the protocol  \nthat the client either drop the auth for a realm, time it out, or  \nforce them to reenter their credentials.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s probably some way to implement an ongoing challenge- \n&gt; response system to verify users if you have really high security  \n&gt; needs, but I doubt Artima does. If I recall correctly, it doesn&#39;t  \n&gt; even take credit cards or charge users. What you&#39;ve got is nice  \n&gt; blog host, and the need for user authentication is essentially for  \n&gt; comments and new entries. Secure logouts don&#39;t seem a sine qua non  \n&gt; for such a site.\n&gt;\nWhat we&#39;re building now will have ecommerce, credit cards, online  \nagreement to contracts, that sort of thing.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
