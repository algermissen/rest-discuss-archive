Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; Hello to everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; as we know, the key constraint of REST is\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hypermedia as the engine of application state\n\nI&#39;m not sure it&#39;s meaningful to talk about a single constraint as the \n&quot;key&quot; constraint.\n\nI think HatEoAS is appears particularly important right now because:\n1. It&#39;s the most novel part of REST (almost every other constraint has \nbeen done a lot more in different systems).\n2. It&#39;s the most visually &quot;webby&quot; part of REST, though this is a matter \nof perception as much as anything else.\n3. It&#39;s a constraint that has been relatively neglected in much \ndiscussion of REST and the balance is being redressed by a recent \nre-focusing on it.\n\nHowever, constraints by their very nature either hold or don&#39;t. Even if \nwe consider HatEoAS as the keystone, removal of any other block brings \nthe whole arch tumbling down.\n\nObviously CoD breaks that analogy, but it does so in ways that are \nthemselves well defined in REST.\n\n&gt; So here is my proposal: let’s shorten the awkward part of the\n&gt; phrase, “as the engine of”, to a single word meaning the same\n&gt; thing: “driving”. Now, any rephrasing is not going to put the\n&gt; focus on “hypermedia” quite in the same way as Roy’s phrasing\n&gt; manages to, which is the trade-off; in return, however, we get\n&gt; a term that is much easier to incorporate into sentences:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hypermedia-driven application state\n\nThis also gives us &quot;Hypermedia-driven applications&quot; to describe \napplications whose state is so driven, which is a phrase I have found \nmyself using without actually attempting a coinage.\n\n\n"}}
