Furthermore, it\n&gt; might be as natural and easy to use as WSDL/SOAP is for OO programming\n&gt; (not that I am saying WSDL/SOAP is any good - but it is a good *fit*).\n\nI think what REST provides is an information layer that sits on top of\nobject-orientation, but also on top of relational data models. Just as\nObject-Orientation relies on a functional or modular syntax for the\nspecification of functions within an object, REST typically relies on\nsome lower-level abstraction to implement its resources.\n\nI sometimes wonder if the object/relational mapping problem could be\nsolved by not attempting to interact between the two directly. Each\ncould treat the other as a separate RESTful service and would not know\nwhether it was object-oriented or relational under the resource layer.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n\n"}}
