Me thinks Jeff is straying from the opacity &quot;axiom&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO, the opacity axiom doesn&#39;t mean that URI can&#39;t have semantics in a\n&gt; particular application domain,\n\nIt means just that.  As soon as you assign any meaning to a URI, then\nonly those privy to that meaning are in on your little secrets (like\nappending &quot;/subs&quot; means &quot;subscribers to the URI before /subs&quot;).\nInteroperability means sacrificing private convention for public\nspecification.  So you make the URI-to-URI relationship explicit with\na statement, such as is done with an HTTP header or an RDF statement,\netc..\n\n&gt; it just means that (a) the infrastructure\n&gt; can&#39;t assume anything about those semantics, and (b) they should be confined\n&gt; to the query string.\n\nIt means that too, though even the query string has limits - it&#39;s not\nfully transparent.  For example, you shouldn&#39;t have to know some secret\nquery parameter a priori in order to accomplish something.  It&#39;s on my\ntodo list to write up my opacity investigation, btw.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
