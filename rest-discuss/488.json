Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think any of the existing HTTP methods\n&gt; communicate what notifcation communicates.  I\n&gt; think there are basically 3 messages, all of which\n&gt; have NO message bodies.\n&gt;\n&gt; CREATED /notification/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; (allowing the ability to watch for the creation of\n&gt; certain types of resources)\n&gt;\n&gt; CHANGED /notification/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt;\n&gt; DELETED /notifiation/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; when there will be no more changes\n&gt; and there is now no accessible info about the\n&gt; resource.\n&gt;\n\nI see six possible messages - only some of which might make sense with Web\nREST.\nThey are: create, read, update, delete, add and remove. The last two - add\nand remove - apply to collections.\n\nAt first I thought &#39;create&#39; might only apply to a type-based or class-based\nsystem, but with the Web, you can reference instances outside the scope of\ntheir lifetime (which is wicked cool). So watching for the create of a\nparticular resource does make sense. If you want to do type-based stuff -\nlike watching for a new resource of a certain type - you would model the\ntype as a collection of all instances and look for &#39;add&#39;.\n\nSo... I concur with Alex about notification messages identifying the type of\nchange made - but I would like all six noted here.\nPaul wants only &#39;changed&#39;, but I see little extra cost to identifying the\ntype of change and I do see cost using further messages to identify the type\nof change. I&#39;m thinking of pub/sub with many many listeners - you&#39;d get an\n&#39;implosion&#39; of &#39;was that change a delete or not?&#39; If listeners almost never\ncare or try to find out, then it&#39;s not as big a deal.\nAnother thing, while I&#39;m up here in the ivory tower, since I would like a\nnotification for &#39;read&#39;, that wouldn&#39;t make sense via a &#39;change&#39;\nnotification. (The reason I want a &#39;read&#39; is that when coupled with a\nresponse status of &#39;security error&#39; you can detect security issues and\nstuff. And I know that non-http based modifications don&#39;t have these\nconcepts, but they can be mapped.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
