We touched on this before.\n&gt; What is the &#39;function&#39; of an HTTP PUT?  I.e., which mapping are\n&gt; we interested in?  Clearly, sometimes it&#39;s resource before-and-after\n&gt; state.  At other times it may be more like request-to-response\n&gt; mapping?\n\nYes, I think that&#39;s right.\n\nThe problem here is that these two views clearly aren&#39;t equivalent, and \nare typically in conflict. REST, as I understand it, looks to have a \nmore natural fit with the resource before-and-after state view. So does \nthat mean that REST is in conflict with part of RFC 2616? If it is in \nconflict, is that a problem for REST, or is it the inevitable \nconsequence of an inconsistency in RFC 2616?\n\nFWIW, the interpretation of idempotent sequences of requests isn&#39;t \nmerely a niggling theoretical puzzle: it has direct implications for \nthe implementation of HTTP/1.1 request piplining on the client side. \nHaving built non-caching HTTP/1.1 proxies which support piplining \nacross from downstream clients to upstream origin servers, I can vouch \nfor the fact that the tensions in section 9.1 are a real headache with \nuncomfortable implications for interoperability.\n\nMark (B and N), you&#39;ve done work in a similar area, so you must have run \ninto the same issue: how did you resolve it?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
