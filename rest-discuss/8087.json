I was intimating that the user needs to create a special set of\n&gt; authentication details to give to agents.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Indeed, this is just the model I&#39;m trying to build for OpenID\n&gt; &gt;&gt; authentication with http://prooveme.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I really understand how prooveme.com works; the FAQ did\n&gt; &gt; not really clarify it for me. If you can explain it in this context,\n&gt; &gt; it would be very much appreciated, otherwise I&#39;m happy to do some\n&gt; &gt; reading on my own first.\n&gt;\n&gt; prooveme.com is an OpenID provider based on client certs. You attempt\n&gt; to login to an OpenID site with one of our IDs (or a delegate) and the\n&gt; authentication is done with your certificate.\n&gt;\nSo if I open up an account with prooveme.com, do I get one or more  \nOpenID URIs?\n&gt; But the really clever bit is what we&#39;re working on now: we can let you\n&gt; create more certificates for specific purposes and give them away to\n&gt; other entities.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, if you want to let flikr login to blogger then you create\n&gt; a certificate that allows authentication only to blogger and then you\n&gt; give that certificate to flikr. When you want to stop flikr doing that\n&gt; you can revoke the certificate.\nThis idea - being able to grant access for specific purposes - is  \nvery cool. But for it to work, Flickr would have to have a business  \nrelationshop with prooveme.com, right? Where is the user directory?  \nIs Flickr supposed to have the client public keys in its own store  \nsomewhere?\n\nI&#39;m confused, the reason is probably that I never did client-side  \ncertificate-based authentication in earnest yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; This OpenID multi-access model doesn&#39;t have to use certificates, but\n&gt; it does require your ID and at least one secure token of\n&gt; information. Certificates could be used... usernames and passwords\n&gt; could be used.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, we (the prooveme.com team) have to get flikr to agree to\n&gt; use client certs to authenticate... but we think we&#39;ll be able to do\n&gt; that.\n&gt;\nSo would Flickr have to do something different for prooveme.com than  \nfor someothersecuritysite.com? Or just support standard certificate- \nbased auth?\n&gt; Does that explain it?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is on-topic btw. It&#39;s all part of (quite) RESTfull\n&gt; APIs. It certainly seems a lot better than sticking crypto in a\n&gt; document being pushed around over some crazy WS-* protocol.\n&gt;\n\nI agree - in fact, I think REST-style exposure of resources and verbs  \nis an excellent match for granting privileges, i.e. if some  \nintermediary asks &quot;B has requested the right to PUT to /customers/13.  \nDo you want to allow this?&quot; this is quite a bit more meaningful than  \n&quot;C has asked to POST to /somewebservice; I can&#39;t decrypt the body,  \nthough, so don&#39;t ask for details. Agree?&quot;.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Need a linux/java/python/web hacker?
