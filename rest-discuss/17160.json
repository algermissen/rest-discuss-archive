However, using custom (vendor)\n&gt; media types is clearly acceptable in web architecture and the rest\n&gt; architectural style.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;d say it&#39;s clearly the other way around.  REST is all about\nstandardization.  Those few occasions when Roy has discussed creating a\nnew media type, he always qualifies his example by remarking about the\nimportance of a standardization effort.  Roy has even blogged about his\nprecise definition of standardization as apart from specification.\n\nThe existence of multiple, interoperable, independent implementations\nis required for standardization.  This precludes most of the vnd. tree.\nREST&#39;s uniform interface is the opposite of the creation of media types,\nin any tree, to solve domain- or application-specific problems.  REST\nis all about using generic media types, which, in the absence of any\nstandardization effort, custom media types are the opposite of.\n\nThere is more value in learning why REST is how it is, than in defining\nREST down to be inclusive of custom media types, as REST was never meant\nto include that approach (the only exception being the creation of new,\ngeneric, standardizable types).  You can&#39;t meet the hypertext\nconstraint if your hypertext isn&#39;t part of the uniform interface (has a\nnice, ubiquitous media type everyone&#39;s heard of).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
