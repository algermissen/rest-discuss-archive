That is the essential\ndifference between forcing the server to implement isolation versus\nletting the server figure it out how to implement its own resources.\n\n&gt;&gt; The right thing to do is tell the server\n&gt;&gt; what you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation\n&gt;&gt; according to the types of resources it is trying to protect.\n&gt;\n&gt; True.  If the server &quot;knew&quot; that the transaction was going to be short,\n&gt; devoid of GETs (at least of updated resources), limited to X number of\n&gt; requests, etc., then the server may instead choose to follow a \n&gt; different\n&gt; approach.\n\nA good server isn&#39;t going to support arbitrarily long transactions\nunless the state is held on the client side.\n\n&gt; However, in my prior post, I had a concern that simultaneous access to\n&gt; the same resource via the same URI (where one was outside of a\n&gt; transaction and the other was inside the transaction) didn&#39;t fit my\n&gt; understanding resource state.  Am I just misunderstanding it all?  For\n&gt; instance, is it enough for a server to return  a response that includes\n&gt; something like the following headers for a GET request within the\n&gt; context of the transaction?\n&gt;\n&gt; Vary: X-Transaction-URI\n&gt; X-Transaction-URI: http://example.com/t/123\n\nIf the state of the resource is not isolated, then there is no need.\nIf they are isolated, then all of the within-transaction responses\nwill have to be marked as cache-control private or no-cache.\n\nPlease, never prefix a header with &quot;X-&quot;.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
