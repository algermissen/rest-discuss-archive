The proposed\nspecs are describing an RPC-like system.  What they are not describing\nis an architecture whereby representations of application state are\ntransferred, but rather an architecture made up of procedures invoked\nupon specified URIs.\n\n&quot;If you need to bend the rules of REST to create a simpler design, then\nthat&#39;s the path that should be taken.&quot;\n\nNo, if you&#39;re calling an architecture RESTful, then the only path you\ncan take is to design a Uniform Interface.  Simpler design choices\nabound.  Nowhere does REST state as a goal, simplified application\ndesign.  There are no shortcuts to gaining the benefits of RESTful\narchitecture.  Eschewing the Uniform Interface for a simpler RPC design\nwon&#39;t yield the benefits of REST.\n\nTherefore, calling the result RESTful is misleading at best,\nparticularly if you call it pragmatic -- not following the REST design\npattern can&#39;t be claimed to yield the same results as following the\nREST design pattern.  Pragmatic REST means following REST as closely as\ntechnology allows, not resorting to RPC instead of a Uniform Interface.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
