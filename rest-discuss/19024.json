POST does not have any \nsemantics other than doing something non-safe non-idempotent. while \ncreate fits that pattern, it&#39;s much more specific and not something that \nis in any way defined by HTTP itself.\n\n&gt; All you need to know is that some resource has collection semantics, so you should tell the client that /photos is a collection rather than focussing on the action.\n\nyou&#39;re assuming that by exposing collection semantics this inherently \nmeans you can POST to create. again, that&#39;s not something that HTTP \ntells you. for example, AtomPub says that in order to create, you have \nto POST to an &quot;edit&quot; link, and not just to the collection itself. you \ncould define a media type where the rule would be that you can always \nPOST to a collection&#39;s URI to create a new resource, but that would be \nsemantics defined by that media type, and not by HTTP itself.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
