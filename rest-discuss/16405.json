It&#39;s interesting how, out of all the times that thread&#39;s been\n&gt;&gt;&gt; quoted over the past four years, that post never seems to get\n&gt;&gt;&gt; surfaced...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Why didn&#39;t Roy correct Mark on that, considering how they were both\n&gt;&gt;&gt; active participants in the thread?

I believe he is still correcting the same point.\n&gt;&gt; Mark then asks for clarification:\n&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6600\n&gt;&gt; Which Roy provides:\n&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\n&gt; \n&gt; Funny. IIRC think I had quoted that message very early on in this thread :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Good you dug that up again - I think Roy pretty much makes everything very clear there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately I think we are seeing evidence in this thread of what Roy said here: \n&gt;&gt; &quot;This is one of those gray areas of increasing RESTfulness that\n&gt;&gt;  will doubtless drive some people nuts.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think both sides are making good points but there is no simple black and white answer.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Andrew\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
