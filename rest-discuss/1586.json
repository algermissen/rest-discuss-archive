More specifically, it\nreinforces\n&gt; that we need samples......not just the ones we&#39;re sending around on the\nfly to\n&gt; each other in this mailing list, but real coherent ones that can be\ncompiled and\n&gt; tested by people who discover the approach and need them to achieve &quot;REST\nZen&quot;\n&gt; [1].\n\nNot sure friction is the best word for it, but I am learning from the\ndiscussion and it has helped clarified why I thought a certain way.  More\nsolid examples of real applications would certain be useful!  Would be great\nto see a RPG game implemented in REST.  A kind of REST Zen and the art of\nweb maintenance. 8-)\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
