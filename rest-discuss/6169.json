Caching works properly for everyone.\n&gt; 4) When eharo sends the &lt;http://www.examplestore.com/tshirts/akira&gt; link\n&gt; to johnsmith, johnsmith sees a link to his own shopping cart on the\n&gt; page. He doesn&#39;t see a link to elharo&#39;s page.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s the difference between personalisation and ownership. If it is my\n&gt; url and only applicable to me, it should have my name or anonymous user\n&gt; id lodged in there somewhere. If it is a url that has meaning\n&gt; independant of who is looking at it but is more friendly if it includes\n&gt; data pertaining to myself, then the friendly version is a personalised\n&gt; url.\n\nS&#39;right.\n\nIt&#39;s a difficult balance when to publish which.
