You \n&gt; can retrieve a representation that incorporates many individual objects \n&gt; and/or associations between them and/or other remote objects (for \n&gt; instance, a weather feed that incorporates many individual timestep \n&gt; objects). You can perform multiple operations to manipulate the \n&gt; relationships between these objects, exclude some or add others, and \n&gt; submit a representation of the new state of affairs (or even a \n&gt; representation of the delta) back to the server. There&#39;s nothing \n&gt; &quot;un-object-oriented&quot; about this, but you can clearly see that there are \n&gt; many operations on the objects themselves, yet only two operations on \n&gt; the remote resource. You can design the system effectively to suit the \n&gt; granularity of the domain and the efficiency and timing requirements of \n&gt; the network-dependent operations. Data binding mechanisms like COM take \n&gt; this facility out of your hands.\n\nAh, that&#39;s probably what Josh was referring to [1] with fine vs \ncoarse-grained operations.
