Or\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; did I misunderstand you?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually, half-and-half: there&#39;s no reason not to use the Allow\n&gt; &gt; header, as far as I know, and Vary: Authentication to indicate that\n&gt; &gt; a different user may be allowed to use different methods. For your\n&gt; &gt; &quot;self-documenting&quot; idea, couldn&#39;t scripting could be used to read\n&gt; &gt; the Allow and Vary headers?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that&#39;s based on a misunderstanding. The &quot;Allow&quot; header, and\n&gt; the 405 response code, are *not* about what the current user is\n&gt; allowed to do or not (that&#39;s why we also have 403 Forbidden), but\n&gt; what method names are allowed on a resource in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, very misleading name.\n&gt; \n\nOK, I see...  Thanks for clarifying.  Wondering aloud about 2616bis\nagain, could HTTP be extended one of two ways.  First, if output varies\nby Authentication, no assumption can be made about the Allow header.\nSecond, if a 403 response has an Allow header, clients may infer\n&quot;Method Disallowed for User&quot;.  The argument is, that would be a useful\nself-descriptive message semantic if it could be pulled off in HTTP\nwithout overloading the 405 response.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n"}}
