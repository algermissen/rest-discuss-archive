Now, suppose we&#39;re not happy with RPC and\n&gt; want to move to a more &quot;loosely coupled, document oriented&quot; style.  What\n&gt; do we do?  We simply remove the requirement that the &quot;query&quot; operation\n&gt; appear in the request message.  Voila, instant loosely coupled service!\n&gt; Right?  I claim not, since in removing the operation from the message,\n&gt; the connector semantics - &quot;query&quot; in this case - have not changed!!\n&gt; Therefore, despite this looking very much like state transfer because\n&gt; &quot;on the wire&quot; it&#39;s just document in, document out, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s just\n&gt; non self-descriptive RPC.\n\nMark,\n\nah, I see what you are driving at. You mean that *any* RPC method could that\nway be stuffed into POST and that we would (somehow hidden) reintroduce\nnon-uniformity to the interface.\n\nSomething to consider: you can do this only once per resource (because any\nresource only has a single POST method), which, in a sense, binds the\nPOST specialization to the particular resource (or resource type if you\nconsider RDFForms). I am not sure how relevant this is, but I think it\nhas somethng to do with the expectation a client can make not only\nabout the POST invocation but about the combination about the resource(type)\nand the POST invocation. \n\nJan\n\n"}}
