Right now I&#39;m experimenting with holding up an impossibly\nstrict interpretation of REST to see what happens to my understanding, with apologies\nto all innocent bystanders.\n\nOn this issue of data-accepting resource types, Mark has created the taxonomy in order\nto help us understand the range of possible responses w.r.t. resource creation and so\nforth, but there can be no such thing as &quot;knowing a resource is this type or that&quot;, because\nthe resource is free to handle POST as it sees fit.  In other words, &quot;IdentityPreservingResource&quot;\nmay be what it&#39;s doing sometimes, but it&#39;s not a contract with you.  At least that&#39;s the\nunderstanding I&#39;ve come away with.\n\nI thought the only (minor) slip in your description of the POST where a sub-resource is\ncreated is that you say the client can *request* creation (or expect creation).  You can expect\nwhatever you want, but as I said there&#39;s no contract*.  And you&#39;re not really requesting that\na resource be created.  You&#39;re trusting the wizard (behind the resource curtain) to do the right\nthing.\n\n* I guess you could negotiate a contract like this, but what I meant is that it&#39;s not REST\nor HTTP baseline stuff.\n\nPS - thanks for trying to understand my esoteric ramblings, and yes, every bit does help.\n\nWalden\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: bhaugen32 \n  To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, August 22, 2002 7:36 PM\n  Subject: [rest-discuss] Re: PUT, POST, authorization and purchase orders\n\n\n  Communication is so difficult....8(\n\n  Mark Baker wrote:\n  &gt; On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 09:10:36PM -0000, bhaugen32 wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; The context was &quot;the resource is a container&quot;.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Right.
