IFF the\n&gt; particular representations in question can / should be regarded as\n&gt; &quot;first-class&quot; entities in their own right, distinguishing them from\n&gt; each other via different URI is certainly do-able.\n\nWhen you say &quot;&#39;first-class&#39; entity&quot;, do you mean &quot;resource&quot;?\n\n&gt; I&#39;m playing with this with a current application.  I&#39;ve got a mess of\n&gt; little resources, all of which have various representations.  This goes\n&gt; beyond mere MIME type to functional types;  for example, a given piece\n&gt; of content might also have an &quot;editor&quot; representation which\n&gt; encapsulates the content in a Web-based interface for editing and\n&gt; saving said content.  Hence, I&#39;ve got URIs like:\n&gt;\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=editor-xhtml\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=printable-xhtml\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rss2.0\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=xml-raw\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rdf-factset\n&gt;\n&gt; This allows all of these things to be directly accessed by simply\n&gt; GETting them, rather than having to dip into conneg.  AND it works well\n&gt; for alternate representations that have some associated functionality,\n&gt; beyond just this or that static format.\n\nI use a similar technique with a new blog system I wrote.  In the case of\n&quot;folder&quot; resources, I have the following:\n\n/blog?form=addentry\n/blog?form=addfolder\n/blog?form=editfolder\n\nFor &quot;entry&quot; resources, I have:\n\n/blog/12?form=editentry\n/blog/12?form=trackback\n\nIn each of these cases, a form related to an aspect of the resource is\nreturned.  This would be equivalent to your &quot;?repr=editor-xhtml&quot;, I think.\n\nIndependently, I also allow the folders to be returned as RSS.  In case the\nclient is not using the Accept: header (my blog system supports conneg), you\ncan append the following query to the folder:\n\n/blog?rss=0.91\n/blog?rss=0.92\n/blog?rss=0.93\n/blog?rss=2.0\n\n(depending on which version you want).  I think this would be similar to\nyour &quot;?repr=rss2.0&quot;.  I just use two different query parameters, but is\notherwise the same.  However, I still treat all of these representations as\nthe same resource.  I do not consider them sub-resources or anything like\nthat.  I agree that a form to add a subfolder looks a lot different from an\nrss feed, but who says that a given representation of a resource must convey\nall of that resource?\n\nNow, I do also have conneg support in the places that it can be used.  For\ninstance, submitting a request to a folder with an &quot;Accept: text/xml&quot;, you\nwill get back the RSS2.0 feed.  Now, if I needed to return another xml\nrepresentation which also used &quot;text/xml&quot; as the mime-type, I would probably\nhave to fall back to the query string method.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
