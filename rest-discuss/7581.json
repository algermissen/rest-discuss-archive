But I think this \n&gt; &gt; model is headed towards a queue, where you add work (pointers to \n&gt; &gt; entities) to be done.\n&gt; \n&gt; yes. naturally, i would do it by sending a \n&gt; &#39;&lt;start&gt;http://example.org/openQRM/service/abc123&lt;/start&gt;&#39;  \n&gt; data to the http://example.org/openQRM/actions resource (a \n&gt; queue of actions), or \n&gt; http://example.org/openQRM/service/abc123/actions. but this \n&gt; then seems very RPC\nIt&#39;s not really RPC since the method is &#39;add to resource&#39; or &#39;extend\nresource&#39; and not a custom method.\nIt does border on a message oriented approach that quickly loses the clarity\nof defined methods - a generic &#39;process this&#39; for everything (which I don&#39;t\nlike, but that&#39;s just me).\n\n\n"}}
