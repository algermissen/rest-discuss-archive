It just has to\n&gt; have a clear meaning with respect to a POSTed request entity and a target\n&gt; resource.  Unless the client knows what it means for a request entity to\n&gt; be a subordinate of a target resource it can&#39;t make a request for the\nserver\n&gt; to do make it so.  Either it is making a request for something else, or it\n&gt; is making a request for something random.  The only way for the client to\n&gt; know what it means for a request entity to be subordinate to a particular\n&gt; resource is for it to have a model of what the resource actually is and\n&gt; how another entity can be subordinate to that resource.\n\nWhy does the client need to know anything more than what it POSTs and what\nis returned?  If the request entity of a POST is acceptable by the server,\nthen the client knows that the request entity is subordinate in some fashion\nto that resource.  If the server returns a representation of the resource\nthat client understands, then the client know what the server has told it\nabout that resource.  Beyond that, what does the client need to know?\n\nIn the case of RNA, there was nothing to return. The resource behind the\n&quot;InboxURI&quot; is a black hole.  Stuff only goes in.  The resource has a\nseparate URI which allows all sorts of additional manipulation (if\nauthenticated) like GET and DELETE.  So why would the client that POSTs to\nthe InboxURI need to know anything about the resource?  The client knows\nwhat a request entity with a content-type of\napplication/rna.notification+xml is.  It knows that, upon receiving a 2xx\nresponse, the resource accepted the request entity.\n\n (NOTE: The &quot;separate URI&quot; mentioned above is not specifically defined by\nRNA, only hinted at.  The implementation of that URI is up to the needs of\nthe specification using RNA as the &quot;front end&quot;.  Maybe this has been the\nproblem.  Maybe the spec was not clear enough, specifically that it could\nnot be used as a stand-alone specification.  It needs an additional spec to\nprovide the &quot;other half&quot; of the application.  However, there isn&#39;t\nnecessarily a single &quot;other&quot; spec, which is why it was not included in RNA.)\n\n&gt; If you do insist on using POST then implicitly you are saying that the\n&gt; client can acquire this model from within HTTP itself (without reference\n&gt; to custom resource APIs).  I think the only way HTTP provides for\n&gt; acquiring this model is by the client knowing the content-type of the\n&gt; target resource.\n\nI do not see why content-type would be enough.  For example, what would it\nmean to a client that a resource (as perceived through its representation)\nis an image/jpeg or application/xml?  How does that tell a client whether\nyou can GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE?  I suppose one could certainly define a\ncontent-type with specific HTTP bindings, but that puts unreasonable\nconstraints on how the content-type may be used.  Maybe you are using\n&quot;content-type&quot; in a way different than myself?  My meaning is limited to the\nHTTP content-type header field.\n\n&gt; Alternative question for Seairth: If you do insist on using POST, how does\n&gt; the client know what it means?\n\nWhat is &quot;it&quot;? The POST request?  The server?\n\n&gt; Yet another version of this same question: Can you give an example of how\n&gt; a server could in theory return 200 and still violate the semantics of\nPOST?\n\nIs that question correct?  You seem to be asking me to give an example to\ndisprove myself... I think...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
