Here is an \noutline of what I am trying to do. I have a list of package names (approx \n100), and I would like to allow users to search through these packages by \nproviding a regular expression. Of course the package names that match the \nregex will be returned back to the client. So let me try and walk through how \nmy mind is thinking about the REST way of doing this.\n\nI am looking for a resource name that the client is interested in, so I think \npossibley something like this.\n\nGET http://somehost.org/package/names\n\nThe above would be fine (wouldn&#39;t it?) if I just wanted to get all the \npackages back that where in the entire database, however I want to filter \nthem so I&#39;m thinking that I need to add some sort of parameter(s) to it. This \nis where my thinking breaks down because now I think it starts to look RPC \nstyle. Here is what I come up with\n\nGET http://somehost.org/package/names?like=regex\n\nThe reason I think that looks RPC&#39;ish is because to me it looks like I am \nasking for some sort of operation as opposed to a resource.\n\nAny thoughts/suggestions/opinions are all welcome. Many thanks in advance.\n\n- -- \nSigned,\nHolden Glova\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org\n\niD8DBQE81699+mF116Lw2cQRAmrqAJ94aE9+LSaEE1BNuiEJlCRG4XQEoQCdF8bf\nOkbQ571fD3kb2Jx29z7cZek=\n=u3Bc\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
