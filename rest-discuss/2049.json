I&#39;ll take a look at Xang.\nJust keep in mind that it was written several years ago. The code is split\ninto two parts : a framework and an application. The NTTP and LDAP examples\non www.xmldatasource.com are apps within the framework. The Xang project is\nanother application meant to let people write apps in xml and javascript (or\nany scripting language). The XML file mapped URLs to code snippets to handle\nthe HTTP methods. I&#39;ve included an example below. The URI path was used to\nlocate an xml element that had attributes for the http methods. This\nwouldn&#39;t be realistic for deeply nested paths, but I was working with some\n&#39;virtual DOM&#39; technology at the time which would &#39;hook&#39; the XML DOM and\nexpose arbitrary data sources as DOM nodes, so the addressing would just\ndrift into whatever data source you had a plug-in for. Each node inherited\nbehavior from parent nodes, so you could easily code behavior for large\nnumbers of data elements. Anyway... the virtual DOM technology never really\nmaterialized (that&#39;s an RDBMS joke by the way...) but the framework part of\nthe code was independent and the XML application page part is still useful\nwithout it.\nThere was no support for rendering or data sources. That idea was that with\na virtual DOM, you just pick a stylesheet based on the output format the\nclient requested, and the data sources were linked via code plug-ins.\nWithout a virtual DOM, you have to acquire the data and transform it\nyourself.\n\nAnyway... maybe you can salvage some code or some ideas...\n\n\n\n--sample.xap--\n&lt;root&gt;\n\n &lt;!-- include some common code --&gt;\n&lt;script xml:link=&#39;include&#39; src=&#39;system.script.xml&#39; &gt;  &lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\nfunction listOrders(context,returnTypes,parameters)\n{\n    var doc = context.response.writer;\n    context.response.contentType = &quot;text/xml&quot;;\n    doc.println(&quot;&lt;list&gt;&quot;);\n    doc.println(&quot;&lt;/list&gt;&quot;);\n}\nfunction listPendingOrders(context,returnTypes,parameters)\n{\n    var list;\n    list = DB.getPendingOrders(parameters.get(&quot;accountId&quot;));\n    // stuff...\n}\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- the path-based URI handlers --&gt;\n&lt;tag name=&#39;orders&#39; onGet=&#39;listOrders();&#39; onPost=&#39;addOrder()&#39;&gt;\n    &lt;tag name=&#39;pending&#39; onGet=&#39;listPendingOrders();&#39; /&gt;\n&lt;/tag&gt;\n\n&lt;/root&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
