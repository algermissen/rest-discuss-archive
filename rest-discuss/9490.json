As Mark Nottingham’s recent\nresearch into proxies has shown, implementations of HTTP tend to\nbe largely to entirely compliant as long as you are using the\nwell-beaten path of RFC 2616 and they get progressively less\nconsistent with rarity of use.\n\nThis is consistent with his earlier research about XMLHttpRequest\nimplementations as well as other results, such as some other\nsurvey of browser compliance with the prescribed behaviour upon a\nvariety of redirects under different conditions I have read. All\nof them indicate that the browser-related subset of HTTP is, for\nthe most part, well implemented by everyone; if you go beyond\nthat, hic sunt dracones.\n\nWithout a test suite covering  oddball or uncommon features,\nimplementors are liable to make mistakes with their\nimplementation or just outright punt on them. Thereby\nmaterialises a cycle in which no clients make use of these\nfeatures because they are badly supported by servers, and no\nservers support these features because no clients need them.\n\nTherefore it is true indeed: every HTTP client in existence is\nsuboptimal if not outright broken.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
