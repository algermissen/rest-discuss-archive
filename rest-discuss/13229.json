Is this idea explained somewhere in\nsome detail?  I think of serialization as the &quot;conversion of data to\nbits for transmission&quot; and I&#39;m unfortunately not making the\nconnection.\n\n&gt; I wonder, why is it that it seems so out of fashion for people to support\n&gt; extensible formats that have been well crafted for this,\n\nI&#39;m using XML, an extensible format, but changes still require a new\nschema - a new version - I&#39;m struggling to see how &#39;extensibility&#39;\nobviates my essential problem which is, &#39;client is programmed based on\nknowledge of a particular representation(schema), if the schema\nchanges in an incompatible way, how does the client negotiate for the\nrepresentation it understands&#39;?\n\n&gt; and why versioning\n&gt; creeps back in every couple of hundred messages.\n\nWell, this specifically, and media types in general come up frequently\nfor a few reasons:  1) it&#39;s the least addressed aspect of REST in the\ndissertation (apparently because Roy ran out of time) and 2) once one\ngroks the basics of REST, its apparent that media type\ndesign/negotiation is critically important and important to get right\nand 3) existing explanations on the Internet take a\n&#39;use-existing-media-type&#39; approach that is naive and somewhat\nunhelpful in the complexities that arise when implementing an\narchitecture in a large enterprise.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll attempt what I think may be the root of the problem: object\n&gt; serialization in xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; As long as we design architectures to accommodate restrictive tools, we&#39;re\n&gt; going to have a rough time.\n\nCan you point me to some resource that describes what you are\nreferring to in more concrete detail?  I find statements like this to\nbe too nebulous to truly appreciate.\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n"}}
