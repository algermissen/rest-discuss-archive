So what. You point out in a later message\nthat if you did you would only have to delete it.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve read, however, the POST is supposed to be used for updating not\n&gt; querying, so it seems wrong to use POST in this case.  Is there a better\n\n&gt; way to handle this sort of thing?\n\nIts not so much that you shouldn&#39;t use POST, its that it is preferable\nthat you use GET for &quot;readonly&quot; requests because it is &quot;Safe&quot;, ie. free\nfrom side effects.\n\nIn this case, you are not changing state on the server so you should\nuse GET if you can ... however the parameters for this request are\ntoo complex to put into a URL, so use POST.\n\n       Use GET when you can, use POST when you must.\n\nDonald.\n\n[1] HTTP and REST are not the same thing.\n\n\n"}}
