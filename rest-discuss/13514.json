Unless \n&gt; one representation could be transformed into the other automatically \n&gt; (i.e. when it&#39;s really only a matter of syntax), this is always a \n&gt; judgement call. I think it can be compared to a design decision about \n&gt; whether or not to put some behavior into two classes instead of one in \n&gt; an OO design, or whether to store data in one or two files.\n&gt;\n\nI absolutely agree with this. However, in practice, there is currently \nno choice - even if your judgment is that HTTP conneg is preferential - \nbecause there is no standardised mechanism to provide hyperlinks which \nleverage HTTP conneg.\n\nAdding significance to the type attribute so it is considered advice for \nthe Accept header of the request will open this up and offer the choice, \nand at the same time it will not negatively impact anyone who continues \nto use URI conneg; since they don&#39;t care about the accept header anyway!\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
