We can do that. No one&#39;s asked for it yet.\n\n\n&gt; This idea - being able to grant access for specific purposes - is  \n&gt; very cool. But for it to work, Flickr would have to have a business  \n&gt; relationshop with prooveme.com, right? Where is the user directory?  \n&gt; Is Flickr supposed to have the client public keys in its own store  \n&gt; somewhere?\n\nYes. But we think it would be better if there were a bunch of\nproviders doing what we&#39;re doing (there is already http://certifi.ca\nwho are at least doing certificated OpenID) and then we can invent\nstandard protocols for moving delegate certificates around.\n\nSo, the challenge is to slightly abstract the token to the point where\nit can be passed around but then used in an implementation specific\nway. I think that&#39;s doable and that flikr and blogger and gmail and\nwhoever would support such an extension of OpenID.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m confused, the reason is probably that I never did client-side  \n&gt; certificate-based authentication in earnest yet.\n\nThey are difficult and confusing. But I think this is a model that can\nsolve all these problems of delegated authority. And after it&#39;s setup\npeople can pretty much stop thinking about client certificates and\njust think about delegation.\n\n\n&gt; So would Flickr have to do something different for prooveme.com than  \n&gt; for someothersecuritysite.com? Or just support standard certificate- \n&gt; based auth?\n\nJust support standard certificate based auth. I really think\ncertificates at least should be required from an OpenID provider.\n\n\n&gt; I agree - in fact, I think REST-style exposure of resources and verbs  \n&gt; is an excellent match for granting privileges, i.e. if some  \n&gt; intermediary asks &quot;B has requested the right to PUT to /customers/13.  \n&gt; Do you want to allow this?&quot; this is quite a bit more meaningful than  \n&gt; &quot;C has asked to POST to /somewebservice; I can&#39;t decrypt the body,  \n&gt; though, so don&#39;t ask for details. Agree?&quot;.\n\nYes. Absolutely. And that&#39;s the level we&#39;re talking about.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\n----------------------------------------------------------\nNeed a linux/java/python/web hacker?
