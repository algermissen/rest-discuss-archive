But I don&#39;t see it as a deal-breaker.  \nA client receiving a 410 Gone in response to a DELETE request, with an \nexplicit no-cache directive, must send any subsequent DELETE request.  \nIn the presence of a no-cache directive, an intermediary MUST forward \nthat request.\n\nThe downside to this is, seeing as how a 410 Gone response is cacheable, \nand the most-likely request for such a resource will be GET, the system \nwould not be as scaleable as it might otherwise.  In fact, being able \nto cache a 410 response is a good argument in favor of preferring 410 \nover 404 for resources that have been deleted.\n\nWhich brings me back to requiring If-None-Match on the first DELETE \nusing the existing cache headers, and allowing 410 responses to be \ncached.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
