If you want to be promiscuous, go\nright ahead.  My point is simply to leave\nflexibility for the client to manage the listener\nhowever it wants.  I think the only way to do that\nis to use an explicit NOTIFY method (or methods).\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS My gut also says that NOTIFY really means\nsomething quite distinct from POST.  In\nparticular, POST says something about a resource\nis to be changed in some way.  NOTIFY signals that\nthe change has already happened.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
