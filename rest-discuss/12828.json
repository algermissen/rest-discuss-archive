I cannot determine from the registration RFC if the third dot is valid.\n\nWhat about:\n\napplication/vnd.somebody.procurement.purchaseorder.v13+xml\n\n(I am heading for a media type that bundles some common syntactical features but might use a load of different possible XML root elements. In addition, these are expected to evolve independently, hence the version on the actual type). \n\nAn alternative solution would be to stick the version into a version parameter but I am not able to see the consequences, yet.\n\nThanks for any thoughts.\n\nJan\n\nRegarding the poking: the application would IMHO have a defined behavior for each document type anyhow and be known to do the correct thing for an invoice or order, or?\n\n \n\n\n \nOn Monday, June 08, 2009, at 07:42PM, &quot;Ebenezer Ikonne&quot; &lt;amaeze@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; And this is I think why Roy used application/quicken and not &gt;something like application/order. The media type is not there to say &gt;*what* the message is, but in what application context it would be &gt;understood correctly.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; application/ubl-procurement+xml emphasizes that quite nicely, I think.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;(Mistakenly sent this to Jan directly)\n&gt;\n&gt;But if that application context is large and consumption is not genericized ala the way browsers simply display anything application/xml, then beyond just knowing what a media type represents, a consumer also needs to peek into to it to determine what it contains.  If an order fulfillment service only deals with orders this may not be a problem, but if it also deals with invoices, a client would have to inspect the representation to determine whether an &quot;order&quot; or a &quot;invoice&quot; was returned.  I would think its needs to represent both application context and data.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
