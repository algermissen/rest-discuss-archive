But it is hard to imagine people using the web for any of these\nactivities, literally. Do you have examples of analogous activities that\nwould make sense as web applications?\n\n&gt; I never said that resource-modeling isn&#39;t valuable - on the contrary.  I&#39;m\n&gt; only saying that resource modeling isn&#39;t the *only* valuable way to do\n&gt; things.  RDBMS and SQL is certain useful, but so are spreadsheets and web\n&gt; logs.\n\nI don&#39;t see how spreadsheets or weblogs demand a procedural approach.\nWhat&#39;s wrong with, e.g., PUTting an entry to\n\n  http://myweblog.net/2002-06-17/mcg12\n\nor GETting the value of\n\n  http://mymoney.com/expense_record/D:22\n\nor, for that matter, PUTting something like\n\n  &lt;add&gt;129.95&lt;/add&gt;\n\nto\n\n  http://mymoney.com/expense_record/D:next_row\n\nOr, if being able to PUT to an arbitrary cell in a spreadsheet gives you\nthe willies, POST to the whole spreadsheet and give the server more\ncontrol over exactly where the entry goes.\n\nHow would verbs in URIs simplify this?\n\n&gt; If you are saying REST is not meant to support a procedural model, I will\n&gt; defer that question to the people defined REST and are refining REST.  But\n&gt; if that is true, we will need an alternative architecture for the web to\n&gt; support the procedural programming model.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, if you are saying that large scale network systems should\n&gt; not support procedural programming, I have to ask why you think that is the\n&gt; case?  I for one would still want to be able to program procedurally for\n&gt; large scale network applications as a complement to the resource model.\n\nFor an authoritative answer, I will also defer to the people who defined\nand are refining REST. But my sense is that procedural programs tend to\nbe fragile in a loosely-coupled distributed environment, which is what\nthe Web has been and most people expect Web Services to be.\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
