The response to the POST is instead a redirect to a temporary \nURL containing the response page.  The browser then GETs this response \npage and displays it.  Due to the redirect, the original POST request is \nreplaced by this GET request in the browser history.  Thus, the user can \nuse the back button with impunity, and will just see the result of their \nrequest, with no danger of resubmitting it.\n &gt;\n &gt; That sounds great, but it seems to clash with REST.  What was before \na transitory response to a POST request now becomes a separate resource \navailable via GET.  Will it be cached?  How long must it stay available?\n\n\nI&#39;m forking this as going from POST to GET isn&#39;t a full answer to the \noriginal question.\n\nOn the matter of POST to GET (by 303 See Other) I do it when it seems \nnatural. If the result of the POST operation is to alter a resource \nother than the resource POSTed to, then 303ing to it is perfectly sensible.\n\n\n"}}
