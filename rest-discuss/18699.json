Here is one interpretation:\n\nA &quot;generic c=\r\nlient&quot; is a client that understands the &quot;processing model&quot; of a various med=\r\nia-types. It knows how to 1) parse data, and 2) discover hyper-media contro=\r\nls (affordances) like links and forms. It does not know what the data repre=\r\nsents in more domain specific terms (like sales orders, persons, weather ma=\r\nps and so on).\n\nGeneric clients can only handle generic tasks. Like Google =\r\n- it knows how to 1) parse HTML (and more), and 2) follow links. Thus it ca=\r\nn &quot;understand&quot; the data in a broad generic way and extract words without an=\r\ny domain specific knowledge.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, generic cli=\r\nents can follow a site map, given that it is represented in a standard form=\r\nat with hyper-media controls (this excludes plain XML and JSON). It can dis=\r\ncover all available links and follow them, but given that it is a generic c=\r\nlient it can, not suprisingly, only do generic stuff with it - it knows the=\r\n &quot;HOW to work with this data&quot;, but not the &quot;WHAT is this data anyway&quot;.\n\n&gt; T=\r\nhat brings me to an interesting point: somehow, &quot;following your nose&quot; and &quot;=\r\nspecific media types&quot; have always felt like some kind of contradiction to m=\r\ne.\n\n&gt; So the paradox to me here is:\n&gt; - the more specific a media type (or =\r\nrelation name) is, the better a client can follow its nose\n\nI think it is i=\r\nmportant to avoid mixing media types and relation names. Again, a media-typ=\r\ne defines the &quot;HOW to work with the data&quot; in terms of 1) parsing and 2) dis=\r\ncovering hyper-media controls. Once the hyper-media controls have been loca=\r\nted you can start working with link-rels independently of original media-ty=\r\npe.\n\nThen you can add very specific link-rels, but any client that understa=\r\nnds the underlying media-type will be able to &quot;follow its nose&quot;, no matter =\r\nhow specific or generic the link-rels are - in the end they always represen=\r\nt a named link and nothing more. The name can be very specific but the link=\r\n will always be generic.\n\n&gt; - but if a media type is specific, it can only =\r\nbe consumed by specific agents that have been programmed for that task, so =\r\nin how far are they following their nose?\n\nI assume that by &quot;more specific =\r\nmedia type&quot; you think of media-types that express domain specific semantics=\r\n like &quot;this is a sales order/person/weather map/other&quot;. You don&#39;t need that=\r\n for a client to &quot;follow its nose&quot; - all you need is a generic media-type w=\r\nith well defined hyper-media controls.\n\nWith link-rels the server can show =\r\nthe client how to change its application state, by going from one resource =\r\nto another. It does not matter how the client got those link relations - it=\r\n could be from an extremely domain specific media-type or a very broad one.=\r\n\n\nThe important thing is that the server is in control and the client only =\r\n&quot;follows its nose&quot; - as opposed to be programmed with a specific hard coded=\r\n flow that assumes knowledge of all URLs involved in the steps.\n\n/J=C3=B8rn=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
