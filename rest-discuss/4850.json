Please visit my site:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://dev.gauldong.net/\n&gt;\n&gt; Click on the &quot;Gado-gado&quot; link and see what I have to offer. I joined\n&gt; the REST mailing lists of yahoo groups to discuss this publicly.\n&gt; Hopefully a solution will have already been here. But I&#39;ve searched\n&gt; google for that and have found nothing which is similar to what I&#39;m\n&gt; proposing. I also have searched REST mailing lists archives and found\n&gt; nothing of interest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is rest-explore still active? It seems to have been dead for a very\n&gt; long time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hendy Irawan\n&gt; -- \n&gt; GaulDong - http://www.gauldong.net\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
