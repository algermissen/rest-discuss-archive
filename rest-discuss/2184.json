If you can model your security\n&gt; concerns in terms of principal, method and resource, then you can use\n&gt; the existing security framework in servlet/HTTP.  If Seth becomes\n&gt; a resource instead of a principal, you&#39;re screwed.  If what Seth wants\n&gt; to do to the Store is something that needs more granularity than\n&gt; {GET, PUT, POST, DELETE}, then you&#39;re screwed.  &quot;Screwed&quot; in the\n&gt; sense that you have to write an application. :-)\n\nHehe true, true.  I actually like writing applications like this, so \nit&#39;s a good time.  :)\n\nOne last point about all of this that I would love your feedback on.\n\nLet&#39;s take a simple example of opening a door (the door to the Store for \ninstance).   To open a door, Seth would try to PUT the state of the door \nas OPEN.  The door would then say &quot;Yup, seth can put me in an open state&quot;.\n\nIf the above it true, then the door has to do data validation based on \nrules and permissions.  For only certain people can change the state of \nthe door to open.\n\nSo a security policy would look a little like:\n\nAllow Seth to change Door1&#39;s isOpen property to true.\nDeny Bob to change Door1&#39;s isOpen property to true.\n\nI am controlling access to an object&#39;s properties and its values.\n\nThat way, when I say:\n\nPUT /door1 HTTP/1.0\nWWW-Authentication: seth\n\n&lt;door id=&quot;Door1&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;isOpen&gt;true&lt;/isOpen&gt;\n&lt;/door&gt;\n\nThe authorization filter can easily check if this a valid state, not \nonly for the door, but if Seth can put that door into that state.\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM security_policy\nWHERE actor = &#39;seth&#39; AND              -- from WWW-Authentication\n       object = &#39;Door1&#39; AND            -- from id attr, or rdf:about attr\n       object_prop = &#39;isOpen&#39; AND\n       prop_value = &#39;true&#39;\n\nAll one has to do now is enumerate all properties of the object that is \nbeing PUT (easy to do if RDF) and compare all against a security_policy \ntable which can be fast.\n\nAre we there?  Does this make sense?\n\nfeelin good,\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms050201040808070901060301\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms050201040808070901060301--\r\n\n"}}
