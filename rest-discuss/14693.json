Atom\nFeed documents are particularly well-suited to listing a collection of\nnames and IDs, where each contains or links to, more specific data.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think? Am I just missing the point altogether? Is this all\n&gt; discussed in great depth elsewhere that I couldn&#39;t find (sorry if it\n&gt; is)?\n&gt; \n\nHow you model your data is up to you; to me, it doesn&#39;t sound like\nanything Atom can&#39;t handle.  If you don&#39;t use Atom, then you can at\nleast use standard link relations on your hyperlinks, or @src to refer\nto documents within a collection, or other standard methods of linking\nhypertext documents.\n\nTry modeling your data as Atom first, though.  You may wind up being\npleased with the results you get from using standard media types and\nlink relations.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n"}}
