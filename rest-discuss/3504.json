Use a parametrized URL, like:\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET /getNewNotifications?since=UID\n&gt;\n&gt; where UID is the unique identifier of the last\n&gt; message retrieved, but this seems unRESTful in\n&gt; that this URL is not really opaque (In the\n&gt; Wiki Jeff Bone appears to argue that this is ok,\n&gt; so I am not really sure, but to me it feels\n&gt; unRESTful)\n\nIt is not unRESTful.  Every resource should have a URI.  That is a\nresource, even if it is ephemeral in content.\n\n&gt; 3. Use a single range headers against a single\n&gt; mailbox URL, but that prohibits you from changing\n&gt; the representation of the underlying mailbox.  If\n&gt; we want the server periodically to check\n&gt; availability of actual messages and update on that\n&gt; basis, we can&#39;t use range headers.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Use multipart-byteranges.\n&gt; I think this is the best option, but a. most\n&gt; clients don&#39;t suppport it and b. it verges on\n&gt; specification abuse.\n\nIt also ties the client and server implementations together,\nwhich is definitely contrary to REST.\n\n&gt; A much more useful way to go would be for the HTTP\n&gt; authors not to have used bytes as the only units\n&gt; for range headers.  If HTTP allowed range headers\n&gt; to be specified in application units e.g. records,\n&gt; then this would all be very easy.  Unfortunately,\n&gt; they didn&#39;t and we have HTTP as it currently\n&gt; stands.\n\nSorry, but you are wrong on both accounts. Read section 3.12\nof RFC 2616.  In any case, a range request is not an appropriate\nsolution to this problem because it ties the client and server\nimplementations together.  If you don&#39;t care about that, then\njust use rsync as your protocol.  It is more efficient.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
