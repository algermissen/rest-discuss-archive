For example, if you defined a content-type\n&gt; application/folder-contents (or something) and did a GET on a folder,\n&gt; sending the content of each file in that folder would be reasonable (from\n&gt; some point of view). Things that can go wrong with this is the sending of\n&gt; resources not via their URI - but since each resource can any any number of\n&gt; equivalent URIs I suppose that is okay.\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
