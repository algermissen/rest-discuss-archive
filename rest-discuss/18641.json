Yes if you define RESTFulnes=\r\ns as a badge that certifies you follow the rules. Yes, you can earn that ba=\r\ndge only in your server and forget about the client.\n\nb. NO, if you define =\r\nRESTFulness as the achievement of the expected quality properties you seek =\r\nfor when using REST. And that NO is because the rules are made to achieve a=\r\n way of interaction between the components, and one of those components is =\r\nthe client. \n\nIn other words, client matters.\n\nAs I had been posting here, =\r\none component may not behave by the rules, but if that is free license the =\r\narchitect is aware of and it is reasonable so that the impact will not brea=\r\nk the business goals, that is fine. But if you need a system where clients =\r\nbehave correctly, and you don&#39;t control the clients, then your architecture=\r\n must have controls and policy enforcement to avoid those spoiled clients f=\r\nrom ruining you day. If not, your system will not get to its goal and it wi=\r\nll be a failure, even if your server is made by the REST book. \n\nREST stops=\r\n when it defines the constrains and promises quality properties, but life g=\r\noes on, and the rest of the system is still to be constructed. Having just =\r\none server following REST rules is just one step. And let me clarify this: =\r\nIt should not be part of the server&#39;s job to assure the client is working a=\r\ns it should. It may help, but we can have several layers that can add contr=\r\nols and enforce policies. There is far more in an system than just one serv=\r\ner and one client.\n\nFinally: I feel the discussion confuses an App, with a =\r\nServer, with a System, with a API. When we talk about a server doing its pa=\r\nrt, sounds like we are talking about an API. Is it that? Yes, we can expose=\r\n a REST like API, but then we need a client to consume it. A system is some=\r\nthing far more complex, where all components, including clients, may affect=\r\n other components. Butterfly effect, that is called.\n\nWell, this was not a =\r\nshort and sweet answer, and I feel I&#39;m repeating myself here. But it is tru=\r\nly a more deep discussion than just earning a badge.\n\nCheers\n\nWilliam.\n\n---=\r\n In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nMy point was that this is not a contest of who can earn the REST badge. The=\r\n\n&gt; question I am seeking clarification on is whether or not the RESTfulness=\r\n of\n&gt; a system is confined to the server or not / what defines the scope of=\r\n the\n&gt; system.\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding up until now is that REST really is co=\r\nnfined to how the\n&gt; server is implemented and does not directly include the=\r\n client However I am\n&gt; questioning that understanding. The discertation cle=\r\narly speaks about both\n&gt; client and server components.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my only goal=\r\n is to get more understanding. The result can impact how I\n&gt; speak/educate =\r\nabout REST and also how I build RESTful systems. For example\n&gt; as Mike ment=\r\nioned, you can create opaque uris to prevent the client from\n&gt; coupling to =\r\nthe uri space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent from my Windows Phone\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; From: Steve Klabnik\n&gt; Sent: 3/9/2012 10:46 AM\n&gt; To: Glenn Block\n&gt; Cc=\r\n: William Martinez Pomares; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [re=\r\nst-discuss] Re: Does the client contribute to the\n&gt; RESTfulness of an appli=\r\ncation?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hmm I don&#39;t think the REST &#39;badge&#39; matters at all.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Then why ask if such a system is RESTful? Your question is a more gen=\r\neral\n&gt; systems and architecture question, I guess.
