That&#39;s not a\n&gt;  &gt; technical issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; The developers of the project [1] likely believe that their API is\n&gt; RESTful and they therefore call their API &quot;RESTful&quot;. I try to presume\n&gt; ignorance instead of malice. You&#39;re correct about the issue not being a\n&gt; technical issue. Regardless of whether the issue is the ignorance of the\n&gt; developers, the social dynamics around buzzwords, the lack of managerial\n&gt; will to confront the false labeling, or some combination of the\n&gt; foregoing, the issue is social, not technical.\n\nI said the issue wasn&#39;t technical; thanks for agreeing.\n\nIf this thing is going to use the term REST, I expect it to have \nsomething do with that term, instead of being in opposition to it.\n\n&gt; What would you suggest regarding other, similar falsehoods [2] in\n&gt; related projects?\n\nI have no suggestions for Tapestry.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
