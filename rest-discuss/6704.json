And  \n&gt; I think that the answer is;  it doesn&#39;t.  But it does make your  \n&gt; application lighter, faster, easier to federate, and operate across  \n&gt; multiple trust domains.\n\nFor what its worth (which again, may not be much), I tend to think of  \n&quot;resource-oriented design&quot; (which may or may not be the right term)  \nas more like designing a database schema, rather than than object  \nmodel. It really is a completely different formulation of the  \nproblem, which makes some problems much easier to solve (cf. Amazon&#39;s  \nRESTful vs. SOAPy interfaces), but isn&#39;t necessarily appropriate for  \n*all* problems.\n\nPersonally, I think framing the discussion as Resource-Oriented vs.  \nObject-Oriented is not the best way to look at it, but that is  \nperhaps another discussion.\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\n"}}
