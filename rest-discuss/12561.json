Obviously you can store state on\n&gt; the server on behalf of the client, but the interaction with the server\n&gt; is determined by the client which must know what it is doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s the server&#39;s duty to reject invalid commands down from invalid\n&gt; verbs to invalid queries, state changes, etc.\n\nBut if the logic is in the client, then how could the server know if a \nstate change is good or not? The server wouldn&#39;t know how the client \ncame to its conclusion about the suggested new state, and so cannot \nenforce validaton rules about the new state.\n\n&gt; So I don&#39;t see that &quot;maintenance and security&quot; problem. You always have\n&gt; to validate external input, the web is no different.\n\nThe maintenance issue is that if I put all logic in the client I *have* \nto ensure that all clients are up-to-date, or else I will have clients \nwith different versions accessing the same server, creating all sorts of \ninconsistent state. With the security I will have trouble knowing \nwhether the client sends state changes that are ok from a security \nperspective as I don&#39;t know *how* they arrived at their state changes, \nand I will also have to send more data to the client than I want, \nbecause the logic is done on the client (if it was on the server then \nthe client would only need the minimal data needed to create the \ncommand, which is easier to secure).\n\nNaaah... doesn&#39;t sound very appealing. So again, has anyone used CQS \nwith REST? Or are they incompatible? Will I have to stick with being a \nREST/RPC hybrid?\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
