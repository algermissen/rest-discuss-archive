REST&#39;s hypermedia constraint mandates that the client only relies on the current steady state (think &quot;Web page&quot;) when deciding what to do next.\n&gt; \n&gt; So in the case where a client presupposes the &quot;next&quot; steady state, the hypermedia constraint has been broken?\n\nYes, right.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll need to digest that.  :)\n\n\nYeah - it is irritating. OTH, it is more about making explicit that you simply cannot make such assumptions in a networked system rather than some mysterious magic.\n\nOf course the client code eventually assumes it might find that link and provide code for that case but the approach is different and influences how you think about coding the client.\n\n&gt; What about if I can handle my assumption being incorrect?  Do I get REST points then?\n\nIn a sense, yes. But the code should try to make explicit that from the current steady state the overall goal of the client cannot be persued any further. IWO, that there is no transition available that it would make sense to follow next. If you just do a try...catch I&#39;d not give you credit :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To your point about Amazon and to extend that example, if I wrote a client that knew how to order books following a &quot;predefined&quot; state machine (not wrapped behind some OO classes but trying to use hypermedia explicitly say via curl) and it broke because Amazon added a new page that my client couldn&#39;t handle, then my client is not RESTful because it assumed what a response should/would be.\n\nYes.\n\n\n&gt;  Whereas if my client made zero assumptions (acted like it didn&#39;t know what would be returned even though it indicates its preference) and didn&#39;t ultimately didn&#39;t understand what was returned, it would still be RESTful because it made no assumptions and inspected every response.\n\nYes. Two issues with this:\n\n1. Despite not understanding what was returned, REST emphasizes that there still is communication because you know that you are dealing with a &quot;I do not understand&quot; situation (aka 406 essentially). This is a lot more than &#39;blurb - fail&#39;. In an enterprise context, you could use the 406 response headers and body to directly instruct developers how to bring the client up to date. This is different from doing an error analysis in an OO system.\n\n2. The way you design your media types greatly influences how gracefully your client can react. In fact, I have come to think that the hypermedia constraint issue is probably the primary aspect of machine-targetted media type design (which we still have no public example of, unfortunately).\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I summarizing right?\n&gt; \n&gt; Eb\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Mar 2, 2010 at 7:07 AM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mar 2, 2010, at 12:44 PM, amaeze77 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recent Jan A published a classification for HTTP-based APIs and I have a question (or questions) related to the distinction between HTTP-based Type II and REST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For all I can tell, the biggest difference between these two classifications is that HTTP-based Type II assumes the flow of the state machine and REST does not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Correct. REST&#39;s hypermedia constraint mandates that the client only relies on the current steady state (think &quot;Web page&quot;) when deciding what to do next.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand why the distinction matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because it decouples the server implementation from the client&#39;s expectations. It is the reason why e.g. Amazon can evolve without considering the millions of clients using it. Amazon can even evolve *while* clients are in the middle of a purchase.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve read here that it matters because the server could mix things up and then the client in the hard coded situation would be stuck.\n&gt; \n&gt; It matters because REST aims to free the server from having to consider its clients when it evolves.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d suggest that even in the &quot;REST&quot; scenario, a server could throw a curve ball that will leave the client with no place to go but home.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure. For those cases, REST emphasizes that the client MUST expect such cases and deal with them instead of considering it to be a violation of some agreement. IOW, any 4xx response is still valid from the POV of the constract that governs the communication. It is not a sign of broken communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I think this classification has to more to do with degrees of coupling than it has to do with REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh? REST is essentially about removing any coupling beyond the uniform interface - so that statement does not make sense :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would an automated load tester (client) for a web application that uses hypermedia to traverse the application and execution not be considered RESTful because the state-machine for the application is hard-coded to some degree?\n&gt; \n&gt; Why would it be hard-coded?\n&gt; \n&gt; (Of course you hard-code the knowledge of the media types used, but that is not hard coding the state machine)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like some clarity on this topic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Eb\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
