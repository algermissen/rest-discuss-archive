That&#39;s my point,\n&gt; if privacy becomes &quot;popular&quot; won&#39;t it destroy intermediaries?\n\nCertainly, but if you don&#39;t trust AOL, then disabling their proxy is a feature!\nPrivasec is still proxying your traffic, but you trust them (or you shouldn&#39;t\nbe using them). So privacy concerns should cause traffic to migrate from\nuntrusted to trusted intermediaries. Proxying by a trusted intermediary may\nimprove privacy, since connections can&#39;t be traced directly to your IP, and\nyour traffic is aggregated with that of other users of the proxy.\n\nWhom you should trust is an interesting question. For example, Privasec, nee&#39;\nSafeweb had the CIA as an investor at one point.\n\nJim\n\n=====\nJim Ancona\njim@...                     jancona@...\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
