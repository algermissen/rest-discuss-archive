That is what caused this problem.\n\nI see people doing this as being backed in to a corner, especially\nwhen you see the hoops one has to jump through to issue a PUT/DELETE\nrequest from a HTML page. Its not hard to see how the kind of\ndeveloper who focuses on doing their job rather than reading specs\ncould get bitten by this.\n\nIts embarassing to tell people how great REST/HTTP is, and then have\nto go through a workaround because of HTML. Such as\nPOST-with-a-method-field.\n\n"}}
