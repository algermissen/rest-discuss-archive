You get N entries on each page\n&gt; instead of the entire result set.\n\nOne way to think of large result-sets, especially using query-paramters,\nis &quot;paramaterizing the resource space&quot;.  E.g., one can think of google\nas an interface to &#39;all searched web documents&#39;, that can be\nparamaterized many ways.  The two key ways are:\n\n- &#39;q&#39;: the subset of the space matching given &#39;q&#39;uery string.\n- &#39;start&#39;: an offset within the sub-space to view.\n\nOf course, google seems to use a cookie to record the results-per-page\npreference, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not also in the URL.  That\nis: the cookie serves to conveniently transfer state on the request to\nthe server, which then redirects the user-agent to a &quot;cookieless&quot; URL\nthat contains the same information.\n\nc-&gt;s: GET /guestbook (with cookie: &quot;25 entries per page&quot;)\ns-&gt;c: 302: /guestbook?num=25\nc-&gt;s: GET /guestbook?num=25\n\n\n&gt; &gt; This is a common problem. You need a &#39;blank slate&#39; resource,\n&gt; &gt; which could be a HTML form GETtable somewhere such as\n&gt; &gt; /guestbook/new.\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, I do notice the use of an adjective here... I guess we are\n&gt; qualifying our resource with it.\n\nSome put the form at the bottom of the guestbook HTML, or maybe just a\n&quot;sign the guestbook!&quot; hyperlink to a standalone resource.  I think it&#39;s\nmore important that both approaches can work, because of hypermedia and\nthe shared semantic of HTML (forms) ... and probably the orthogonality\nof HTML to any particular web service.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
