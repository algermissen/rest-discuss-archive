You build the documents according to a recipe you read in a\nspec, and submit them to urls you get by parsing hypertext. By\nagreement we know that you can POST an &lt;entry&gt; document  to the url\ndesignited by rel=something. But on the web you get an HTML form from\nan URL and the form tells you how to form the submission and where to\nPOST it.\n\nSince Roy will jump your shit if you start claiming your own personal\npreferences constitute REST, I just called it less web like, because\nyou could argue that hey, we are following hyperlinks. Parsing HTML\nforms and POSTing to the action urls is more hypertexty than building\npredefined documents, but I didn&#39;t think I needed to pursue that\nargument.\n\nHugh\n\nOn 5/11/07, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Roy T.

Resources\n&gt; &gt; are just one part of the style.  Resources are necessary for REST,\n&gt; &gt; but resources must be allowed to evolve independently from the\n&gt; &gt; clients and the only way that can happen is when the clients are\n&gt; &gt; expecting to be instructed by the next representation received.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, since the XML result returned by the Atom Publishing Protocol does\n&gt; not include hyperlinks with each entry for deleting that entry, or\n&gt; updating it, or inserting a new entry (or some equivalent way of\n&gt; representing the allowable state transitions), then APP is not fully\n&gt; RESTful; since it does not comply with the &quot;Hypermedia as the Engine\n&gt; of Application State&quot; (HEAS) constraint?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I understand how REST works for UA2AA (User Agent to Automated\n&gt; Agent) protocols. Are there any examples of AA2AA (Automated Agent to\n&gt; Automated Agent) REST protocols in production that really do HEAS\n&gt; right? Tim Ewald&#39;s hypothetical example of a flight reservation\n&gt; protocol helped, but it&#39;s a toy example, not a real production example.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
