I joined this group \nbecause I am interested in REST, there seem to be several good ideas \nhere.\n\nI have a webservice that is something like an online civilization \ngame.  Users can conquer land, cities, build things there, explore \nmaps, etc.  How do you design something like that RESTful?  Can \nsomething like that be done?  I am using Python for cgi scripts, \ngenerating HTML with CSS inline (by means of style attributes).  The \nmain thing I don&#39;t understand is how to give a player access to \nhis/her cities, and denying other players access to those cities.  \nHTTPS could be available.  As it is now, the webapplication starts \nwith asking a username+password combo, and as I understand it that \nis already against REST principles?\n\n\n\n"}}
