The\n&gt;&gt; complexities of Irish dialect are interesting, but they&#39;re hardly\n&gt;&gt; relevant to this discussion - what is your point here exactly?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; The point is that the thing that is normative is &quot;law number 3 in gaelic&quot;. \n&gt; Which is a different resource from &quot;law number 3 in english&quot;. The parent \n&gt; resource, the thing you may or may not assign a URI to is &quot;law number 3&quot; and \n&gt; everybody understand what law you talk about. both an english and an irish \n&gt; version (aka representation) of such law exist, but you *care* that they are \n&gt; different, as only one of them is normative.\n&gt;\n&gt; As such they&#39;re not conneged represetnations but two separate resources that \n&gt; happen to be two represetnations of a common thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The point Jon was making is that, if you imply that Accept is needed on top \n&gt; of the URI for such different representations to be accessible, only a UA \n&gt; knowing about HTML 5 (or code *you wrote* to understand the need for Accept) \n&gt; will be able to directly identify both resources distinctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; You not only break the addressability concern, you also break serendipity.\nGET /law/3\nAccept: text/html\nAccept-Language: en\n\nGET /law/3\nAccept: text/plain\nAccept-Language: gd\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html\n\n&quot;Note: [content negotiation] is not called &quot;format negotiation&quot; because the alternate representations may be of the same media type, but use different capabilities of that type, be in different languages, etc.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Well then why bother making the distinction between resource and\n&gt;&gt; representation?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Because some resources are not representations, while some representations \n&gt; are not resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nThat doesn&#39;t sound very uniform.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m suggesting that these can all be achieved using HTTP conneg and\n&gt;&gt; using URIs just as they were intended; to identify resources.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; URIs were intended and are used (in terms of webarch) to identify \n&gt; *anything*.\n\nSure; I could have made it more clear that was how it relates to it&#39;s \nintention wrt REST. Clearly a URI of a SOAP interface is not a resource, \nyet it is a URI.\n\n&gt; That includes resources *things* and representations \n&gt; *documents*.\n&gt;   \n\nrepresentations aren&#39;t documents, they&#39;re formats - documents implies \nthey are something in and of themselves which they are not. From my \nunderstanding a representation is just a specific *way* of representing \na resource - i.e. a representation is nothing without a resource to \nrepresent. So I don&#39;t see how a representation can be compared with a \ndocument.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; This is not possible\n&gt;&gt; presently because there is no mechanism in markup to indicate the\n&gt;&gt; appropriate HTTP conneg headers for a request.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I believe you&#39;re overestimating what conneg was intended for. As a general \n&gt; rule, you conneg representations when no one gives a damn about which one \n&gt; they get.\n&gt;   \n\ner...\n\n&gt; As such, getting a png or a jpg whenever an image is requested depends on \n&gt; the capabilities of the platform. If the user needs to be in control, you \n&gt; 300 or 303 and you use links with properly addressed representations \n&gt; (separate URIs).\n&gt;   \n\nright.. you have to because there is no way in the markup to leverage \nHTTP conneg.. not because it &quot;wasn&#39;t intended for that&quot; or &quot;it doesn&#39;t \nwork&quot;. Don&#39;t be ridiculous.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;   [examples where cachce invalidatioon doesn&#39;t work]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; HATEOAS ?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Not sure I get you.\n&gt;   \n\nNeither am I.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; If the PUT didn&#39;t &#39;go through&#39; them; then they aren&#39;t an intermediary,\n&gt;&gt; are they?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Because your intermediary and my intermediary when talking about proxies \n&gt; will be different, and they do not communicate together.\n&gt;   \n\nOK, so we accept that&#39;s a problem to overcome no matter which way we do \nit. Surely that&#39;s even more incentive to remove the necessity for \nintermediaries to comprehend your application&#39;s specific URI-relationships?\n\nReverse proxy work &#39;out of the box&#39; if URIs and representations were \nused strictly and in conjunction with the appropriate Vary headers in \nresponses. This solely relied upon at the moment because lack of support \nin markup and browsers forces developers to implement URI-based conneg.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n"}}
