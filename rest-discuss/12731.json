My &quot;value add&quot; was simply to turn it into an acronym: HYDEPR\n&gt; (pronounced HIGH-de-pur). (Hey, that&#39;s what analysts do. :-))\n&gt; Here&#39;s how to use it in context: &quot;Perhaps the most important RESTful\n&gt; &#39;uniform interface&#39; constraint is the HYDEPR constraint (formerly known as\n&gt; the HATEOAS constraint).&quot;\n\nI think the phrase &quot;Hypermedia Describes Protocols&quot; is pretty non-intuitive, and\ncertainly doesn&#39;t convey as much as HATEOAS does when expanded. Additionally, I\nthink they&#39;re both about as unpronounceable as each other. Heh.\n\n-- \nNoah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n\n"}}
