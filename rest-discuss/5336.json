In this case, which response\n&gt; code is m=\r\nore appropriate to reflect multiple resources creation? (201\n&gt; Created?)\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; And what if server failed to create some of them (i.e. the phyiscal\n&gt; sto=\r\nrage has full, unableto store last two files). How do we construct\n&gt; a resp=\r\nonse (and resposne code) that reflect such partial failure\n&gt; accurately?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; It&#39;s quite common in real world applications, where a single POST\n&gt; reque=\r\nst triggers multiple resources creation. For example, a new user\n&gt; registra=\r\ntion in web hosting service will trigger several resources\n&gt; (i.e. user pro=\r\nfile & user&#39;s file-system directories) creation as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; How to reflect=\r\n each resource creation status accurately in a single\n&gt; response message?\n\n=\r\nCorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, but shouldn&#39;t a request be atomic?\n\nHence, even if=\r\n a request triggers several creations, shouldn&#39;t the\nrequest be treated lik=\r\ne a unit of work, inside a single transaction?\nSo I&#39;d be tempted to say tha=\r\nt if a sub-part of the request fails, all\nrequests should be rollbacked.\n\nT=\r\nhus, you&#39;d only have 201 created (everything&#39;s been created) or some\nother =\r\nresponse failure if something failed (even if it&#39;s just a part\nof the whole=\r\n request that fails).\n\n\n--\nGuillaume Laforge\nhttp://glaforge.free.fr/blog/g=\r\nroovy\n\n\n\n"}}
