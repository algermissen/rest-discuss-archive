A body could get to taking that\n&gt;personal-like.\n&gt;\n\nSorry about that, again, everyone.  One of these days I will be changing \nmail providers.  Karen, I&#39;d have added you to my whitelist, except I have \nno way of seeing your e-mail address, because Mailsnare pretty much \ndeletes everything from rest-discuss.  If Yahoo didn&#39;t keep deleting me \nas a result, then I&#39;d be able to log in to my Yahoo and see your e-mail \naddress when I use a web browser to read rest-discuss.  So I&#39;m pretty \nmuch stuck with making a wholesale change to my e-mail just because \na couple of mail lists don&#39;t work with it, or not participating here, or \ntrying to participate here and ticking people off.  Darn Internet.\n\nTry sending me an e-mail directly, anyone who does gets on my whitelist.  \nMessages from the list will still bounce and I won&#39;t see them, but it \nwould clear up the problem you mention.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
