Since the\n&gt; resource the PUT is applied to is not changed in your example, the  \n&gt; PUT does not succeed.\n\nIf the resource /had/ changed in my example, it would be incorrect to\nreturn 201. But I don&#39;t believe that the resource changing is the only\ncriterion for success.\n\nI take your point about &quot;the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request\nto some other resource&quot;, although in this case the target resource\ndoesn&#39;t exist yet, it&#39;s not as if we&#39;re overwriting some existing\nresource.\n\nI think this is a weak area of the spec, since the PUT-&gt;201 is exactly what\nyou want to do: have a single request and response that covers the\nentire transaction. In the case of the PUT-&gt;301-&gt;PUT-&gt;201 the\npossibility of resource contention is introduced: multiple clients\nupdating the same resource can lead to arbitrarily long 301 loops. It\nstarts to look less and less stateless, and in any case it will be at least\ntwice as inefficient.\n\nAnyway, perhaps we have our answer as to why browsers are loath to\nintroduce PUT/DELETE functionality in forms - nothing is ever as clear\ncut as you think.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
