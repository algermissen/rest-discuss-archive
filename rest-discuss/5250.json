On what basis is B chosen?\n\n2. Once A and B engage in a communication, how does A determine\n    what operations to call upon B and in what order?\n\nAfter another (not too close) look at CSS- and pi-calculus I  \nunderstand this:\n\nIn process calculi, processes are typed by the sequence of accepting  \nstates, meaning that two processes B1 and B2 can be considered by A  \nto be exchangeable if they allow the same sequences of operations to  \nbe called upon them (bisimulation).\n\nProcess A determines the sequence of operations from its knowledge  \nabout B&#39;s type (which &#39;is&#39; the sequence of operations to be called).\n\nHow does this compare to REST? There is an obvious answer for  \nquestion 2: in a RESTful system, process A discovers the possible  \noperations at runtime by looking at the hypermedia that is passed to  \nA by B (hypermedia as engine of application state).\n\nBut what about 1? In a RESTful system, how does A choose the right B  \nto get done whatever A intends to get done? Do I just use the type  \n(e.g. any process of rdf:type ex:ShoeOrderProcessor will do) of a  \n&#39;service&#39; silently hoping that the typing information is &#39;correct&#39;?\n\nAn interesting case is a human intending to do a Web search. Suppose  \nyou turn to Google by they are currently down; usually you&#39;d turn to  \nyour next favorite search engine. You do so, because you *know* it is  \na service of type &#39;search engine&#39; and not because you make  \nassumptions about the individual operations you will have to go  \nthrough during the search.\n\nIt might even be the case (evolvability benefit ahead) that sequence  \nof operations you  have to perform has changed since your last visit,  \nbut this will not cause a problem, because you will discover the  \nsequence during your search. No expectations will break.\n\nSupposed you have a bookmark folder named &#39;Search Engines&#39; and you  \njust pick the entries until you find a working search engine or one  \nthat returns a satisfying result I&#39;d argue that you are choosing the  \nservices by their type (indicated by the bookmark folder). Your  \nbookmarks are like a registry for services.\n\nIs that how service discovery works in a RESTful networked system?\n\nAnd these come to mind:\nWhat is the role of the clients *intent* concerning discovery and  \ninteraction? What is the relationship between the MIME type and the  \ndiscovery? Are MIME type coordination languages?\n\n\n...just uncooked initial thoughts on this anyway...\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1]http://groups.yahoo.com/group/service-orientated-architecture/ \nmessage/2400\n    (the postings more relevant to this email are towards the end of  \nthe thread)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
