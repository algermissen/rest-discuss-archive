I recently gave a couple of talks on REST vs. WS-*: Facts, Myths\n&gt; and Lies. See:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sanjiva.weerawarana.org/2007/11/rest-vs-ws-facts-myths-and-lies.html\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m sure a few people here will disagree with me on some of my views on\n&gt; REST ;-).\n\nwhy would we do that ? I mean, I know I have some differences between\nus on the value of WSDL, WS-A, and all the WS -callback stuff, but I\nthink even you are starting to suspect that WS-* doesnt work.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be very happy to be educated and also to debate some of the\n&gt; details - comments on my blog are preferred but I&#39;ll be happy to follow up\n&gt; on this list too.\n\nOne of the things I dont think has worked is this hard split between\n&#39;middleware implementor&#39; and end developer. Its something that all the\ncontract-last stacks have tried to do, hide you from the headers, from\nWS-A, etc. And the end users -for a fee- can do that. But then\nsomething goes wrong and they are left trying to sniff SOAP requests\noff the wire with ethereal and make sense of WS-A there and then, or\nthey are left trying to debug a bit of WS-* interop over the phone\nwith an external caller. In SOAP, you can run from XML, but you can&#39;t\nhide. And trying to convince the paying customer that they dont need\nto understand XSD is wishful thinking on everyone&#39;s part. Because you\nwill end up staring at the schemas, or even stepping into the SOAP\nstack to identify why fault information is being lost.\n\nAdmittedly, part of the problem is not SOAP, it is the stacks that try\nand map from Xml to Object and back again. And I&#39;ve encountered REST\ncode this week which does exactly that -its the typica API to talk to\namazon EC2. And just like SOAP Stacks, its brittle against change; the\nmove to java6 is enough to break it as the XSD import code is finding\nambiguity with ##local being in ##any, whereas in java5 it seemingly\nwasnt. But that doesnt say SOAP is good, only that anyone who tries to\nhide from the XML, or anyone who thinks XSD is a good language for\nrepresenting XML document syntax is in trouble, The nice thing about\nREST is you don&#39;t have to do that.\n\nRegarding REST authentication, yes, it varies. Basic auth over https\nworks nicely, other things, well, they are non standard. As I am\nworking with Amazon S3 and EC2 this month, I&#39;m getting fairly\nfamiliiar with their signing stuff, which is very non standard, but\nnice: you sign the headers, including the md5 checksum of the data you\nare about to load; stick it in as an extra query. It may be\nproprietary, but it is common to all the AWS services, S3, EC2 and\nAWS. So you write it once and be done with it, or take a copy that\nworks from someone else. Its a lot easier than implementing\nWS-Security , believe me.\n\nThings we agree on\n\n&quot;Distributed computing is hard no matter what!&quot;\n\nwelcome to the big projects.;\n\n&quot;If writing services, write them so you can offer either a RESTful\ninterface or a WS-* one&quot;\n\nwhy? So you double your document+test+example client+maintenance\nengineering effort? Returning to AWS, their S3 doc is cluttered by all\nthis up-front protocol neutrality, before having 30pages of SOAP you\nhave throw away before you get to the interesting stuff. GET, PUT,\nDELETE. And it is so nice. do a PUT to a host that isnt there, create\na new host. do a GET on a host/bucket that is not there, get a 404+\ntext back.\n\nTry it! You don&#39;t even need a new client, just the browser in front of\nyou : http://hello.sanjiva.s3.amazonaws.com/\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\nx-amz-request-id: 2D4A2D0DFCB1190C\nx-amz-id-2: kFK/F3fWy2UcGCtlndSL1wQvIF2AI0p1oGBvF3frHN5HSMc5aKKk/6WjBoxdOhek\nContent-Type: application/xml\nDate: Fri, 23 Nov 2007 23:12:14 GMT\nConnection: close\nServer: AmazonS3\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;Error&gt;\n&lt;Code&gt;NoSuchBucket&lt;/Code&gt;\n&lt;Message&gt;The specified bucket does not exist&lt;/Message&gt;\n&lt;RequestId&gt;11FFFDAC076F89E8&lt;/RequestId&gt;\n&lt;BucketName&gt;hello.sanjiva/BucketName&gt;\n&lt;HostId&gt;\neKJoiWj1kfzfZNjM3QZw/tqOX4yQtwPhzzO/mXO+MhoaasZI2vc8LgSiStKIMXj0\n&lt;/HostId&gt;\n&lt;/Error&gt;\n\nThere, isnt that nice. Its not perfect, they should have used\nSOAPFault, which is, to me, the only thing that SOAP got almost right.\nI say almost, as the fact that you can only send a SOAPFault with a\n500 error code, not here with a 404, or somewhere else with a 3XX. But\nonce I stop using third party libraries that suffed JAXB grief with\nthe xsd for this error format, move to Xom and XPath, I can handle\nwhat amazon send back.\n\n-steve\n\n\n\n\n&gt;(I&#39;ve been a lurker for a while!)\n\nwelcome\n\n"}}
