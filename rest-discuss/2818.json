When you propose to capture conversational\nstate as a globally addressable resource, you&#39;re promoting it\nto something &quot;higher&quot; than conversational state.  Indeed, you&#39;re\nlikely factoring out the conversation in doing that, maintaining\nonly the points of agreement.\n\nThink: If clients were responsible for *all* application state, then\nthere would be no need for servers.  Please let&#39;s try to keep the\nword &quot;conversational&quot; in there where it belongs.\n\nThanks,\nWalden \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 07, 2002 9:55 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] client-side state (was Re: Security and REST)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In REST, we agree that all state should be kept on the client \n&gt; side.  Now,\n&gt; what is the best way to go about doing that?  I am not \n&gt; necessarily talking\n&gt; about using existing HTTP browser/server technology.  I am \n&gt; talking about\n&gt; creating a ficticious client and server that did this correctly.  Paul\n&gt; mentioned the idea of having a URI-referencable client state \n&gt; that the server\n&gt; could query.  However, what sets the state in the first place \n&gt; (presumably in\n&gt; a RESTful manner)?  Who is responsible for setting the state?  Client?\n&gt; Server? Both?\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
