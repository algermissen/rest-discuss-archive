In defence of a better grade than B, how to code the client wasn=\r\n&#39;t the question, though :P  As creator of a public API (my assumption), I h=\r\nave no little to no control over the client implementation (although I thin=\r\nk !success will become part of my boilerplate docs).  \n\nThe best I can do i=\r\ns make the URI opaque, provide some variations to get at that URI (link hea=\r\nder, form taking the year and returning a location, etc.), and clearly indi=\r\ncate the expected behaviour when that URI is called.  You&#39;ll notice that in=\r\n all of the suggestions, including Eric&#39;s, you have to communicate to the c=\r\nlient creator what behaviour to code against.  I think it less important sp=\r\necifically which choice is made, but rather that such choices are consisten=\r\nt across the API and are communicated clearly.\n\nHaving said that, using for=\r\nums like this to debate implementation will hopefully lead us towards some =\r\nstandard approaches to things such as boolean responses.\n\nFood for thought:=\r\n \n\nI inferred that the intent of the exercise was to provide &#39;is leap year&#39;=\r\n functionality and that whether it&#39;s actually backed by PHP&#39;s mcal_is_leap_=\r\nyear() function is not that important.  In fulfilling this contract, I real=\r\nly needed to sit down with my customer, Eric.  He didn&#39;t say why he wanted =\r\na URI to invoke the function.
