An Atompub server should drive interaction with\n&gt; clients using forms, to indicate to the client what data the server\n&gt; needs, and can accept.\n...\n&gt; A forms pattern would also permit us to evolve the document format\n&gt; safely.\n&gt; The forms here would be Xform models. Basically they are empty XML\n&gt; templates for the client to fill out. They&#39;re not perfect, but good\n&gt; enough for this job, standardized, and XML friendly. You would GET the\n&gt; form from the link rel=&quot;edit&quot; URI.\n\nI&#39;m not sure who you think will interpret this form on the client side.\nYou see, the thing is that the atom document format is already a form. A\nclient has already received the form by being programmed in a particular\nway, and is now submitting the form. It knows what information should be\nplaced in each of the named fields. It knows how to construct the end\ndocument.\n\nOne might argue that the client and server should communicate online\nbefore the client submits data that the server might not accept. In one\nof the examples you mentioned earlier the server might not support the\nfull atom protocol, in that multiple authors may not be supported. As\nsuch, the server might be able to publish a document that indicated a\nsubset of the atom format that is usable. I suggest that while a\ndocument format could be produced to communicate which subset is\nimportant, the cost would likely outweigh the value. Certainly, allowing\nfor additional elements in the form would not be meaningful to a client\nwithout further specificaiton as to what those elements mean. Any\nadditions of this kind would likely require code changes to the client.\n\nIn general, the client should provide the information it has in the form\nof a subset of the atom specification. The server should read and\nunderstand as much as it can of any input documents, filling out missing\nelements (such as id) with default or generated values if necessary. If\nthe server doesn&#39;t understand parts of the document they should be\ndiscarded. Where the server partially understands the input format (for\nexample, supporting only one author) it should have an algorithm for\ndetermining which information it will keep and which it will discard.\nNegotiation of capabilities ahead of time just complicates matters, and\ndoesn&#39;t change the fact that both sides must have new code written for\nthem to support a new feature deployment.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
