Authoring, for\n&gt; example, should always be performed on a specific URI that is\n&gt; dependent on the format, since that allows you to author many\n&gt; different representations for the more generic URI at the same\n&gt; time without having to rely on server gymnastics to understand\n&gt; what resource is being authored.\n\nWhen you PUT the server could use the content-type to decide what\nrepresentation is to be edited. \n\nI don&#39;t understand why you class that as gymnastics.\n\n\nDoing it this way gives the server the chance to say: sorry, that\nrepresentation isn&#39;t supported by me (if the user submitted something\nun-indexable perhaps). \n\n\nOf course, I&#39;d be pretty annoyed if I&#39;d just typed war and peace into\na text box and the server said that.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
