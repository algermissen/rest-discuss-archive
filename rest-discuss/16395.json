To take the IETF viewpoint, for\n&gt; &gt; example, atom is not a standard (only an RFC).\n&gt; \n\nYes, but we&#39;re only interested in how RFC 2616 (and the RFCs it refers\nto) defines &quot;standard&quot; when it comes to media types -- which it defines\nas RFCs, in the case of the &quot;standards tree&quot;.  So it is a fact, that\nwhen using HTTP over the Internet, &quot;standard media type&quot; encompasses\nAtom because it *is* an RFC (well, two RFCs), pointed to by the IANA\nregistry entry for the application/atom+xml identifier.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; FWIW, Roy also defined what he understands standard to mean too[1].\n&gt;\n\nThe context of that weblog entry is only to call out three major\ncorporations for releasing a spec and calling it a &quot;standard&quot; and the\nindustry rags reporting it as such, despite its lack of approval by any\nstandards body -- Roy&#39;s entire point there is that CMIS is an\nindustry-created specification, NOT a standard, unless and until it&#39;s\napproved as an official standard by some standards body.\n\nRegistered media type identifiers support self-descriptive messaging.\nBut only standardized media types, meaning those which have been\napproved by a standards body, support the uniform interface of HTTP on\nthe Internet -- and even then, only those which become ubiquitous\nenough to be at least minimally deployed.  If you&#39;re using an obscure\nstandard, you aren&#39;t getting any of the network-effect benefits of REST\nlike serendipitous re-use and anarchic scalability, which are inherent\nin ubiquitous types.\n\nUnless your system really is a unique snowflake requiring a new media\ntype, REST development is all about refactoring to fit the uniform\ninterface as it exists today.  That way, you hit the sweet spot of the\nWeb that you miss entirely by sending unknown identifiers (registered\nand/or standardized, or not).  Serendipitous re-use and anarchic\nscalability are only available on the HTTP Internet when you use\nwidely-deployed (what I call ubiquitous) types.\n\nIf you create a new media type, you engage in a waiting game to see if\nit&#39;s ever adopted widely enough to gain any appreciable network-effect\nbenefits from intermediaries.  Whereas the re-use of ubiquitous types\ngives you immediate access to those benefits of REST... kinda the point!\n\nIf you really do have a compelling need to create a new media type,\nthen you&#39;re likely not the only one with that problem, so go ahead and\npost a spec and see who responds.  If you&#39;re right not to use existing\nubiquitous types, then the waiting game will be short, and without\nchanging your system it goes from &quot;REST mismatch&quot; to &quot;REST OK&quot; at some\nindeterminate point of uptake (the grey area of &quot;increasing RESTfulness&quot;\nRoy refers to).\n\nIf you&#39;d have been better off adapting your system to ubiquitous types,\nyou&#39;ll know it by the lack of uptake of your media type, and the lack\nof network-effect benefits -- a standard that&#39;s only deployed on your\nsystem and that of your corporate partners will never achieve the\nnetwork-effect benefits of the uniform interface:  serendipitous re-use\nand anarchic scalability.\n\nOnly those ubiquitous, standardized media types with registered\nidentifiers can be *expected* to yield REST&#39;s benefits right off the\nbat.  Straying away from ubiquitous types turns that solid expectation\nof what happens with tried-and-true identifiers, into a total unknown.\nDo you need the benefits of REST today?  Then *don&#39;t* create custom\nmedia types -- instead, refactor your system to leverage known knowns.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; He&#39;s also said that a particular specification need not necessarily be\n&gt; a standard[2].  I know this forum has a tendency towards black and\n&gt; white, but I take it Roy this[3] as our liberty to live in the gray a\n&gt; little:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The degree to which the format chosen is a commonly accepted\n&gt; standard is less important than making sure that the sender and\n&gt; recipient agree to the same thing, and that&#39;s all I meant by an\n&gt; evolving set of standard data types.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nOnce again, Roy is discussing REST in generic terms, while I am\ntranslating that into hard-and-fast rules for instantiating REST over\nthe Internet via HTTP -- like only using IANA-registered types --\nbecause that *is* a pragmatic black-and-white issue in said context.\n\n&quot;Hence, both sender and recipient agree to a common registration\nauthority (the standard) for associating media types with data format\ndescriptions.&quot;\n\nSince, on the Internet, &quot;recipient&quot; could mean anybody, if you&#39;re using\nHTTP then you MUST agree to use IANA.  Otherwise your messages aren&#39;t\nself-descriptive to intermediaries (except those on your intranet).\n\nIf you only care about one class of recipient, say partner\ncorporations, and you don&#39;t care about serendipitous re-use or\nanarchic scalability, then why aren&#39;t you using HTTPS... since you&#39;re\nbasically excluding intermediaries from being much besides dumb\nrouters by sending opaque identifiers over HTTP?  In fact, why bother\nwith REST at all?\n\nYou cannot meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint using opaque\nidentifiers (meaning unregistered, or registered but not pointing to a\nstandard), it isn&#39;t even guaranteed that you&#39;ll meet the constraint\nusing ubiquitous identifiers, when using the Internet via HTTP.\n\nSo the starting point for meeting the self-descriptive messaging\nconstraint using HTTP over the Internet is the IANA registry, beyond\nany shadow of a doubt.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
