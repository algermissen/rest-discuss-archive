It is the meeting of\n&gt; many web services to achieve some business process.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s really a nonsense term. It&#39;s just another form of\n&gt; programming.\n\nExactly, it is entirely procedural.\n\nI think that when you approach the topic of processes from a REST  \nPOV, the processes should become applications (in the REST sense). To  \ncreate a new process instance you POST to the process container and  \nget back the URI of the instance. A GET on that URI will provide you  \nwith some hypermedia that tells you what state transitions are  \npossible from the current state of the process. Depending on who does  \nthe GET the application can present different sets of possible  \ntransitions. That way the application (the process instance) serves  \nas a coordinator for the various process participants.\n\nTrouble ticket systems are a very nice example of that, I think.  \nEvery individual ticket (==process instance) coordinates stakeholders  \nof the incident represented by the ticket.\n\nWhat makes REST so special is that the clients need not know anything  \nabout the application flow (the state machine), they just need to  \nunderstand link semantics. This enables the application to change the  \nstate machine without beaking client code.\n\nWhen you do a purchase at Amazon, you do not memorize the transitions  \nyou did once and do the same transitions every time; you start from  \nthe beginning each time and let the application take you through the  \nstate machine. If it changes from one purchase to the next (e.g. they  \nmight bring in an extra click-here-to-get-a-discount step), you will  \nstill be able to carry out your purchase as desired.\n\nThis form of loose coupling is simply impossible if the client has to  \nknow (aka hard-coded) the call sequence of the API methods.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; But a form of programming that deals with very high level\n&gt; concepts rather than the nitty gritty that programmers usually deal\n&gt; with.\n\n\n"}}
