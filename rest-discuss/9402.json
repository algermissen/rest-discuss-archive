In some cases you don&#39;t want to give away that a  \ncertain resource used to exist (just like you might want to say 404  \nNot found instead of 401 Unauthorized), and in those cases you can  \nDELETE the tombstone to make the appearance that the resource never  \nexisted.\n\nAlso maybe your storage capacity for tombstones is running out, and  \nsome maintenance script can delete very old tombstones. (I guess some  \ndates would be useful to include in the tombstone metadata or document)\n\nWe can assume that it&#39;s not interesting to have tombstones for  \ndeleted tombstones, so a deleted tombstone can give 404 right away.\n\n\n(BTW, one way to avoid saving tombstones is to just use incrementing  \nidentifiers, if your current identifier counter for /foo is 4 and you  \nhave /foo/4, /foo/3 and /foo/1, then a GET /foo/2 can be replied with  \n410 Gone. /foo/5 is 404 Not found, because the identifier counter  \n(typically sequences in a database) is not higher than 4.)\n\n-- \nStian Soiland, myGrid team\nSchool of Computer Science\nThe University of Manchester\nhttp://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ssoiland/\n\n\n\n"}}
