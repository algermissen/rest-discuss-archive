It is\nexpected that four or five parallel sessions will be offered, with\npresentations in each focusing on tools and techniques for the World\nWide Web.  Preferred tracks and presentations will be of interest to a\nwide range of participants working on Web-related development.\n\nPotential topics and tracks may be for a particular area of Web\ndevelopment -- Web Services, Semantic Web, RDF or XML tools, etc. -- or\nfor cross-cutting topics that may be of interest to those in multiple\nareas -- forms, compound document and multimedia integration, so-called\n&quot;rich web apps&quot; making innovative use of Javascript, new developments in\nsearch tools, best and/or advanced practices in Web application\ndevelopment, etc.\n\nSubmissions should be in the form of an abstract of no more than 500\nwords for an individual presentation.  For multiple-presentations or\ntracks, please be sure to indicate the approximate length and how many\npresentations, and include up to a 1/2 page on each planned\npresentation.\n\nSubmissions will be accepted on a rolling basis with a final deadline of\nMarch 25 2005.\n\nThe Developer Day 2005 home page is; http://www2005.org/dday/\nSubmissions should be sent to chair_dev@...\n\n"}}
