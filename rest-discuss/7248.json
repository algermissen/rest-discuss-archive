There was some ranting by\nYaron G a while ago about that attitude -\nhttp://www.goland.org/optimisticconcurrency/\n\nSo to me it seems acceptable to use PUT to update a &#39;latest version&#39;\nresource that happens to be related to other resources that are previous\n(and possibly future) versions of that underlying resource. I wouldn&#39;t allow\nupdates to resources that are the actual versions though - but that&#39;s just\nme, as I don&#39;t want to figure out branching and merging strategies.\n\nSomething like\n PUT /resource\n request.content =&gt; /resource;v1 \n\n PUT /resource\n request.content =&gt; /resource;v2 \n\n POST /resource\n request.content + /resource;v2 =&gt; /resource-a;v3\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Andrzej \n&gt; Jan Taramina\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 13, 2006 5:21 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Versioning and URLs\n&gt; \n&gt; Building on my prior post, has anyone worked through URL \n&gt; design and HTTP methods for situations where you are \n&gt; versioning resources?\n&gt; \n&gt; Typically the versioning would be enforced on the back end, \n&gt; so that you can&#39;t update a resource, only create a new version.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not clear to me whether Put or Post would be the better \n&gt; choice, or whether to allow both and make them identical in \n&gt; the versioning scenario?\n&gt; \n&gt; My thought is that this should be a Post, since a new URL \n&gt; will be created for the new versioned resource and that Put \n&gt; should not be allowed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that the version information should be included \n&gt; in any returned representation of the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts from the group?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thx!\n&gt; \n&gt; Andrzej Jan Taramina\n&gt; Chaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions \n&gt; http://www.chaeron.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
