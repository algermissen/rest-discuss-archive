Usually, if a client does not understand the semantics  \nof a link well enough to immediately know the method, then finding out  \nabout the method is not the primary problem (understanding the link  \nwould be the primary thing to do).\n\nFinding out about support for PUT might make sence because that  \nenables the client to directly infer authorability of the resource.  \nOTH, an Expect: 100-continue header on the PUT request would make the  \nprevious check for PUT unnecessary.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that the HTTP spec for OPTIONS [1] implies that clients can\n&gt; use OPTIONS to determine which methods are allowed [2]. However, I&#39;ve\n&gt; not seen examples of clients doing this at runtime (examples anyone?).\n&gt; So, this can be a dev-time check for some, but then I would treat this\n&gt; as a &quot;hint&quot; rather than a guarantee since the server can change this\n&gt; at some time in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.2\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.7\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Dec 21, 2009 at 09:07, Tim Williams &lt;williamstw@...&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On Mon, Dec 21, 2009 at 12:46 AM, Eric J.

The same goes for application/rss+xml, which only supports  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; GET\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- you&#39;d have to change to, or use conneg to add, application/atom \n&gt;&gt;&gt; +xml\n&gt;&gt;&gt; because that media type supports DELETE (via Atom Protocol).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If you go rogue because HTTP allows you to DELETE your negotiated  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; text/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; html + application/rss+xml resource anyway, then you&#39;re violating  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; uniform interface constraint.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At risk of showing my ignorance, I&#39;m not seeing how this is violating\n&gt;&gt; any constraint.  As I understand it, the uniform interface is defined\n&gt;&gt; as the &#39;contract&#39; between components in the system - independent of\n&gt;&gt; resources or their representation.
