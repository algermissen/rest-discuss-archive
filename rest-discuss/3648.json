I think I have a vague sense of what it is, \n&gt;&gt;but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at \n&gt;&gt;Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to monitor\n&gt;or mediate the interaction between two other components. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that says it all.  Was there something in particular about that\n&gt;definition that you had trouble with?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell, its one of those definitions where my reaction is &quot;OK - now what \ndoes that mean.&quot;  I&#39;m sure its an accurate and succinct definition, its \njust too terse for my small brain.  What are the pros and cons of \nhaving/not having visibility?  How do I determine what or how much an \nintermediary needs to see in order to have &#39;good&#39; visibility?  When is \nsomething not visible?  What does it take to make something visible?\n\n&gt;&gt;Can someone give me an example of why and how visibility is important \n&gt;&gt;(in REST).  I suspect that one of the examples will involve proxies, so \n&gt;&gt;if someone could give an additional example that&#39;d be even better.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Given the definition, providing an example that doesn&#39;t use an\n&gt;intermediary would be tough. 8-).\n&gt;\nOK.  I guess I was hoping someone had an example of an intermediary that \nwasn&#39;t a proxy or a gateway..\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n\n"}}
