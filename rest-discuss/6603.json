What diff does it make if the form came from the form\nprocessing resource or was (for example) a standard invoice form, as\nlong as both client and server can handle it?\n\nWhat I liked about the direction of RDF Forms was that the combination\nof a media type and a form could pretty fully describe not only the\nPOST message but also the result of a GET on the resulting resource.\nIn other words, a 2-way resource type description.\n\n(That&#39;s also the attraction of microformats, of course.)\n\n"}}
