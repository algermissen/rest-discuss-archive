We worked together at Sun, and he&#39;s just a very\npleasant fellow.  But I think he misunderstands important aspects of\nREST and the Web, so I have some concern there.\n\nAnyhow, rather than be critical of this effort, I&#39;ve decided to submit\nmy application to join the EG.  Java definitely needs better APIs for\nthe Web.\n\nI am concerned about the request (section 2) though; it goes on and on\nabout how existing APIs are too &quot;low level&quot; and require a lot of\nknowledge of HTTP, which suggests to me that they&#39;re thinking of\nhiding as much of HTTP as possible; an obvious &quot;protocol independence&quot;\nbias there which will only lead to a crappy API.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
