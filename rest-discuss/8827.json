You&#39;re seeing an output transformation as an \noption, I see it as merely another representation of my resource, not a \nremote function call -- the client is requesting to GET some data from \nthe server -- and this request can easily be fulfilled by an intermediary \nbecause /date&#39;s output is cacheable.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;some systems won&#39;t/can&#39;t cache GETs which contain parameters.\n&gt;But this is more of a flaw with those systems then any flaw in your\n&gt;method.\n&gt;\n\nBut, crucially, the cache component of my server connector handles this \njust fine.  By using XSLTC&#39;s input cache, once any date conversion is \nrequested the algorithm doesn&#39;t need to run for that date again (provided \nthe server stays up).  Once an output transformation has been run, the \nresults are cached in Resin&#39;s HTTP cache.  The only system I can control \nwould scale very, very well because of this, if need be.  Instead of \nrunning the algorithm every time (which would happen in RPC) I&#39;ve created \na cacheable lookup table from the algorithm output.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
