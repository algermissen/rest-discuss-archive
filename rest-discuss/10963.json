The behavior I was\nexpecting is\n&gt; t=\r\nhat the browser follow the Location header after receiving the\nresponse,\n&gt; =\r\nwhich it does not. I just made an assumption regarding the browsers\nexpecte=\r\nd\n&gt; behavior.\n\nI was expecting the same thing just yesterday in fact. Stran=\r\nge to see\nthe exact question I was going to ask on here as the latest threa=\r\nd :-)\n\nOne thing you might consider doing is doing a bit conneg to figure o=\r\nut\nif you talking to an HTML browser and sending them a representation of\nt=\r\nhe resource they just created in the body of the 201 Created\nresponse. In t=\r\nhe HTML you can then use JavaScript to redirect to the\nnewly created resour=\r\nce:\n\nHTTP/1.x 201 Created\nLocation: /ammem/14\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nDa=\r\nte: Fri, 27 Jun 2008 19:06:41 GMT\nServer: CherryPy/3.0.1\nContent-type: text=\r\n/html\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;script language=3D&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;\n      window.lo=\r\ncation =3D &#39;/ammem/14&#39;;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    Created /ammem=\r\n/14 !!\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nI&#39;d be interested to know from others who are mor=\r\ne experienced if this\nis kosher, particularly in an AtomPub implementation.=\r\n\n\n//Ed\n\nps. shout out to eikeon for this straightforward solution :-)\n\n\n"}}
