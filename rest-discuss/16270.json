I have access to a RESTful service that catalogs my \n&gt; friends.\n&gt; It&#39;s at http://yourfriends.example.com . It gives me a way to GET a \n&gt; person\n&gt; document defined by a person.xsd XML schema by linking from a page \n&gt; that lists my\n&gt; friends.

Fortunately, I know \n&gt; of another\n&gt; RESTful web service that does supply addresses for a person. There&#39;s \n&gt; even a link\n&gt; to it in the person XML. The links point to address.xsd documents \n&gt; generally\n&gt; hosted by http://addresses-galore.example.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s some approaches (m namespace is mine, the two above are p and a\n&gt; respectively):\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) I create representation like that shown below in my own new schema\n&gt; person-with-address.xsd\n&gt; &lt;m:person-with-address&gt;\n&gt; &lt;p:person ...&gt;...&lt;/p:person&gt;\n&gt; &lt;m:addresses&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a:address ...&gt;...&lt;/a:address&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/m:addresses&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/m:person-with-address&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) I notice that person.xsd is extensible and so I create my own \n&gt; compliant\n&gt; person.xsd documents like so\n&gt; &lt;p:person ...&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;m:addresses&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a:address ...&gt;...&lt;/a:address&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/m:addresses&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/p:person&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Suppose I take approach #2 and yourfriends.example.com notices and \n&gt; decides to\n&gt; host them. They wish to offer both representations (their original and my\n&gt; extension). Are these representations of the same or different \n&gt; resources? Is it\n&gt; reasonable for them to try to let users choose the thin or fat version \n&gt; of a\n&gt; person using content negotiation? If so, how can you differentiate \n&gt; these by a\n&gt; media type?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any issue here in solution 1 or 2 because I&#39;m constructing an\n&gt; application state as (a client of yourfriends and addresses-galore) \n&gt; that wasn&#39;t\n&gt; hypertext driven?\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n-- \nDaniel &quot;Oscar&quot; Schulte\n\nWoestestrasse 2\n58675 Hemer\n\nTelefon: \t+49 2372 726121\nMobil: \t  +49 176 20646122\nE-Mail:   mail@...\nInternet: http://www.DanielOscarSchulte.de\nICQ: \t    158955358\n\n\r\n--------------010206080604040603080209\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;\n      http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n    Some thought:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Resources are allowed to have different representations, why should\n    they not be allowed to provide different/more details in some\n    representations?
