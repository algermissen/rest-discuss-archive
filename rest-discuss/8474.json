My continued belief (not shared by all) is that the specified\n&gt;  PUT request means state=&quot;off&quot; and there is no temp value.\n\nI was thinking about more about this, and seems like an error, or at\nleast sloppy, to inentionally spec PUT this way, because the meaning\nof the client&#39;s message is not clear. The MS stuff is really a patch\nformat according to the docs. If the document\n\n&lt;foo&gt;\n   &lt;a&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;\n   &lt;c&gt;3&lt;/c&gt;\n&lt;/foo&gt;\n\nis retrieved from http://example.com/bar, it looks like you can update\n/b and /c in two ways.\n\nPUT /bar ...\n&lt;foo&gt;\n   &lt;a&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;c&gt;30&lt;/c&gt;\n&lt;/foo&gt;\n\nor\n\nPUT /bar/a ... 10\nPUT /bar/c ... 30\n\nThere&#39;s a problem here, in that it becomes impossible to clearly\nrequest that an HTTP server save your patch somewhere, in case you\ndon&#39;t want to apply it immediately. To ensure that you don&#39;t get bogus\nchanges inserted in your patch, you need to wrap it, like\n\n&lt;patch&gt;\n &lt;foo&gt;\n   &lt;a&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;c&gt;30&lt;/c&gt;\n &lt;/foo&gt;\n&lt;/patch&gt;\n\nand then the question becomes... why isn&#39;t the patch format like this\nin the first place, and sent using either PATCH or POST?\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
