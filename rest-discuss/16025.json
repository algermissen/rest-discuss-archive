One of\n&gt; the examples cited in the presentation is rotating an image in flicker and the author claims using\n&gt; RPC style is natural and works better than just using REST. Any thoughts??\n\nI dunno, so far the changes they&#39;ve made to &quot;overcome the challenges\nof REST&quot; really appear to be changes to overcome their poor initial\nmodeling of their resources.  The &quot;cool new feature&quot; #1 was described\nby Roy nearly 9 years ago[1] and summarized recently by mamund[2].  So\nfar, unimpressed:)\n\n--tim\n\n[1] - http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-September/004712.html\n[2] - http://www.amundsen.com/examples/fielding-props/\n\n"}}
