Possibly he was merely\ntrying to avoid the assertion that a series of idempotent functions\nis idempotent, as opposed to asserting that there are actual\ncounter-examples to that, as we seem to interpret him.  I dunno.\n\nYour proof reminded me of an analysis I did a couple of years\nago for processing SQL trigger results represented as lists of\ndeletes and inserts for an entire transaction, especially the\ntechnique of looking only at the beginning and the end of each\nsequence.\n\nI suspect that any disagreement about the idempotence of a string\nof idempotent HTTP operations has more to do with the way you\nmight map HTTP operations onto the meaning of &#39;idempotent&#39; than\nwith the particular proof you offered.  We touched on this before.\nWhat is the &#39;function&#39; of an HTTP PUT?  I.e., which mapping are\nwe interested in?  Clearly, sometimes it&#39;s resource before-and-after\nstate.  At other times it may be more like request-to-response\nmapping?\n\nI&#39;m still open to trying an Alloy model, but I have a hunch that\nit won&#39;t provide any more insight into the problem than your proof\nhas already given.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Miles Sabin [mailto:miles@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 04, 2002 3:19 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Idempotent sequences\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote,\n&gt; &gt; Mathews, Walden wrote,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s the trivial proof?

That means that\n&gt;   either there&#39;s something wrong with spelling things out this way (in\n&gt;   which case, what?), or there&#39;s something not quite right with 9.1\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Miles\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
