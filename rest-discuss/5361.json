The value of DATA URIs in \nthis context is that they are more self-describing and less opaque than \nHTTP URIs.\n\nHere is a different implementation of the same idea.  Rather than \ninserting DATA URIs into HTTP URIs, I&#39;m going to do it in two steps.  \nAll I want to do is explain the idea by putting it in a different form, \nthough.\n\nLet&#39;s say there is a resource which needs to be accessed via POST for \npurposes which are application-defined, but that the POST body contents \ndon&#39;t matter -- all the data is in the URI.  Let&#39;s also say that there \nis a hypertext format for describing such an interaction.  \nhttp://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/04/14/rest_in_wsdl is an example of such a \nformat. \n\nI&#39;ll make up an analogous format with the content type foo/bar, and \nstipulate that the user agent knows how to handle the foo/bar type.  An \ninstance of a foo/bar document is:\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1[CRLF]\nHost: example.com[CRLF]\n\nI convert that to RFC 2397 format:\ndata:foo/bar;charset=utf-8,POST%20/%20HTTP/1.1%5BCRLF%5D%0AHost%3A%20example.com%5BCRLF%5D%0A\n\nThen embed the DATA URI in a hypertext document:\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;a \nhref=&quot;data:foo/bar;charset=utf-8,POST%20/%20HTTP/1.1%5BCRLF%5D%0AHost%3A%20example.com%5BCRLF%5D%0A&quot;&gt;POST \naway!&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThe browser knows how to handle foo/bar internally, so it processes the \nDATA URI and performs a POST to example.com/.\n\nThat seems like a pretty useful sort of thing to be able to do, and that \nis the value.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
