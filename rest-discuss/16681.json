Thanks.  MIME syntax could be ditched, but application/atom+xml\n&gt; would still be a self-descriptive identifier by virtue of being in the\n&gt; IANA registry.\n\nmost welcome.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I also can&#39;t square the reference to RFC 2048 with this statement:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The problem is that I can&#39;t say &#39;REST requires media types to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registered&#39; because both Internet media types and the registry\n&gt;&gt;&gt; controlled by IANA are a specific architecture&#39;s instance of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; style\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- they could just as well be replaced by some other mechanism for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; metadata description.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\n&gt;&gt; you missed the start of the sentence ;) &quot;This is one of those gray\n&gt;&gt; areas of increasing RESTfulness that will doubtless drive some people\n&gt;&gt; nuts.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, right!  I forgot that REST-the-style could be implemented via\n&gt; carrier-pigeon network -- the color of the tube holding the payload\n&gt; indicates its spoken language (which is self-descriptive if it&#39;s\n&gt; specced somewhere, what color maps to what language), striping could\n&gt; indicate encryption, while the color of the paper indicates script vs.\n&gt; cursive... specced properly, perfectly RESTful!\n\n&quot;that will doubtless drive some people nuts.&quot; - when the nearest \nuse-case is an eleven year old april fools joke..\n\n&gt; But, that does seem to indicate the wording of 5.2.1.2 is a bit off...\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand that some other protocol may instantiate a different\n&gt;&gt;&gt; form of registry, but how does replacing Internet media types not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; go against the definition of data format in 5.2.1.2?  Should I be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reading 5.2.1.2 as &quot;most commonly known as a media type,&quot; i.e. as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an example and not as a definition?  In which case, should &#39;media\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type&#39; be read as &#39;data type&#39; elsewhere in 5.2.1.2?\n&gt;&gt; If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then what good does it do? your protocol and\n&gt;&gt; the messages sent would be incompatible with the entire deployed\n&gt;&gt; stack of everything we have on the Internet/Web \n&gt;&gt; (clients/servers/agents/intermediaries/caches/apps), how is being \n&gt;&gt; incompatible with pretty much everything RESTful?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; +1, but it may help in understanding the distinction between the style\n&gt; and the implementation, to better decouple the definition of the style\n&gt; from the implementation.\n\ncould be worth doing if it&#39;s practical in any way, maybe somebody needs \nto fork and make &quot;REST Strict&quot; packed full of a load of MUSTs.\n\n&gt; URI still holds true -- as long as the carrier pigeons know how to fly\n&gt; back and forth between routers (pigeon coops), the server (human) who\n&gt; stuffs the paper into the little tube, and the semantics of what that\n&gt; paper represents, may be identified using a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper could have little tear-off tabs with URLs on them, or a form\n&gt; to fill out, which could be sent by appropriate pigeon/tube.  Hypertext\n&gt; constraint, and all...\n\nlost me (~ish) there&#39;s no way I can reply without having to bill \nsomebody for the waste of time :p\n\n&gt;&gt; A shared understanding between clients and servers which support many \n&gt;&gt; protocols already exists, Internet Media Types, this allows message \n&gt;&gt; bodies to move from one protocol to another, and indeed for the\n&gt;&gt; messages bodies / entities being transferred to be usable by apps on\n&gt;&gt; either side. Perhaps it&#39;s not up to the protocol to define a new\n&gt;&gt; (un)-shared understanding, but rather to adopt the existing shared\n&gt;&gt; understanding in order to be RESTful.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On the Internet, certainly.  ;-)  But what about Carrier Pigeon Transfer\n&gt; Protocol over IPoAC?\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549\n&gt; \n&gt; Gray area, indeed!\n\nWell, don&#39;t know about you, but I use the Internet Protocol, for.. well \npretty much everything, and certainly everything I&#39;d apply REST to - so \nno gray(grey!) area for me I&#39;m afraid.\n\nI could consider applying REST to non-internet and every day things, but \nI think the mrs would kill me if I started complaining about dinner not \nbeing self descriptive.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
