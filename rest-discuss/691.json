I previously suggested that there be\na GET, the GET results would be hashed by the client in some well known way, and\nthe hash would be transmitted with the followup POST as a &quot;baseline state.&quot;\nHowever it is hard to lock the GET and POST together, because it is hard to make\na hash that the client and server can both compute independently.  If there has\nto be a hash computed by the client, then the POST can&#39;t precede the GET.  If\nthe hash has to be computed by the server, then the GET has to return it, and\nthat means the watched resource has to be modified to compute and output the\nhash.\n\nThe following sample set of Model-2req transactions is intended to correct these\nproblems.\n\nI propose that the POST precede the GET and the hash be eliminated.  The\nsubscription POST would become effective immediately on reception.  POSTing to\nit would mean &quot;Do what you need to do to know that this resource has changed,\nwhether it&#39;s computing a hash or creating a database trigger.&quot;  Though it is\nassumed that the sink will followup the POST with the GET, it is not necessary\nfrom the perspective of the subscription resource.\n\nEliminating the hash opens the nice optimization that the POST request and GET\nrequest can sometimes be precomputed and stuffed into a single packet without\nwaiting for the POST results to make the round trip.  As a result the efficiency\nproblems of having two separate round trips can sometimes be eliminated.\n\nA sample set of Model-2req transactions:\n\n[HEAD]\n\nCLIENT -&gt; SERVER\n----------------------\nPOST [notifications Request-URI] HTTP/1.1\n[TBD: stuff to say what the callback URI is]\n[TBD: stuff to say what the watched resource is]\n...\n\nSERVER -&gt; CLIENT\n----------------------\n200 OK\n...\n\nCLIENT -&gt; SERVER\n----------------------\nGET [watched resource Request-URI] HTTP/1.1\n...\n\nSERVER -&gt; CLIENT\n----------------------\n200 OK\n...\n\n[time passes]\n\nSOURCE -&gt; SINK\n----------------------\nPUT [callback Request-URI] HTTP/1.1\n...\n\n[goto HEAD]\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
