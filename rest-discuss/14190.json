Letting the client change whatever combination of fields\n&gt; they need to in *one* request (and therefore probably a single\n&gt; database transaction) would seem reasonable to me.\n&gt; \n\nAck!  Failing to make your messages self-descriptive isn&#39;t pragmatic.\nIf I have a distributed hypermedia system, and I want it to gain the\nbenefits of REST, then falling short of REST in the implementation is\nanti-pragmatic because what I&#39;m left with is some other architectural\nstyle that isn&#39;t guaranteed to exhibit the desirable properties I was\nafter when I chose REST to meet them.\n\nConsensus on this list for years, has been that PUT is not used for\npartial updates.  While the server isn&#39;t required to honor everything\nin a PUT, for example a server might not change an atom:id even if it&#39;s\nupdated in a PUT, this is not some loophole that allows PUT to be used\nfor partial updates.\n\nIn a REST system, the only thing that matters regarding methods is that\nthey are used according to their definitions.  PUT has update-by-\nreplacement (or creation) semantics, PATCH has partial-update semantics\nand has been in HTTP 1.1 from the beginning (look at the obsolete RFCs,\nthen the comments by RFC 2616&#39;s authors about how the lack of inclusion\nof PATCH was due to time constraints and lack of implementation, but\nwas not meant to suggest that PATCH had been removed from HTTP), and is\nnow reinforced by its own RFC.\n\nSo, to overlook the method with the required semantics of partial-\nupdate (PATCH) and assign those semantics to PUT which has different\nsemantics entirely, is to use PUT other than what it was intended for.\nThis means that out-of-band information is driving your PUT\ntransaction, and the semantics of the interaction are not visible\nbecause the messaging is not self-descriptive.  Since the semantics of\nPOST are generic, assigning it to cover for PATCH is acceptable.  But\nnot PUT -- doing that is failing to apply the uniform interface\nconstraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
