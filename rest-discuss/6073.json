Apologies, I kinda got\nlost after the 2nd post.\n\nWhat you were saying is that you&#39;d use AJAX against a generic url and\nthe cookie would identify to the url the particular form of content it\nwould take.\n\nSo you might have:\n\n   http://store/nicshopfront\n\nwhich calls:\n\n   http://store/carts/genericcart\n\nwith a cookie in the request to identify the particular cart.\n\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s much wrong with that. Except that it&#39;s not much\ndifferent from simply putting the thing into the uri namespace:\n\n  http://store/carts/specificart1\n\nthen you don&#39;t need the cookie at all (except maybe on the client\nside).\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
