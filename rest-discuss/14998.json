For example, an HTML form wit=\r\nh a bunch of IDs presented in &lt;option&gt; elements in a select control does no=\r\nt violate the hypermedia constraint. IOW, you need not put URIs in the opti=\r\nons just to be RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; This only works because your website behind th=\r\ne form knows how to map IDs from the &lt;option&gt; element to resource URLs on i=\r\nt&#39;s backend REST API. When the user posts the form I assume the result is s=\r\nomething like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;  POST /show-item.aspx?id=3D1234 HTTP/1.1\n&gt; \n&gt; How =\r\ndoes the webserver know how to map &quot;1234&quot; into it&#39;s backend resource http:/=\r\n/rest.mysite.com/items/1234? \n\nEh.....from a form!? It must act as a RESTfu=\r\nl client to the backend RESTful service. Otherwise you would be in portal-l=\r\nand....\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Your website is certainly RESTful on the user facing part. Bu=\r\nt it&#39;s interaction with the backend REST API is not.\n&gt; \n\nThen make it so\n\n&gt;=\r\n Notice that we don&#39;t have this issue when our backend is a database. In th=\r\nat case there is a really tight coupling between the website and the DB - t=\r\nhe website know exactly how to fetch items from the DB using IDs only.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; Likewise, it is ok to have a URI template like /users/{userId} if the =\r\nlink relation defines the meaning of the userId param and if the client dis=\r\ncovers user IDs in received representations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, that might work. Le=\r\nts explore that solution. Assume we have a REST API for searching our items=\r\n. The search API has one official URL that lets us search items by name:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;  http://rest.mysite.com/items?name=3D{name}\n&gt; \n&gt; The search returns an A=\r\nTOM feed with found items (ATOM entries):\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Playsta=\r\ntion&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/=\r\nitems/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/title&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/olditems/123=\r\n4&lt;/link&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Check the &quot;self&quot; links. The resource format is not=\r\n the same for the two items. So I cannot just grab the ID and render HTML a=\r\nnchors with them since the &quot;commodere 64&quot; link would be wrong.\n\nThen the &#39;f=\r\norm&#39; that the backend gave to the service is simply wrong. In your example,=\r\n there are two different construction rules (forms) for different context. =\r\nWhy would you do that? Why not just one form? The server can sort out the o=\r\nld vs new stuff behind the interface.\n\n(Note: your link syntax is wrong. sh=\r\nould be href=3D&quot;&quot;)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to render the search result as an HTML list=\r\n with links to my user facing web:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;li&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;a href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D1234&quot;&gt;Playstation&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/li=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;li&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D=\r\n1234&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice how my two items sud=\r\ndenly have the same user facing URL!\n\nAnd?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now lets add URL template=\r\ns in the result as you suggest. I do not know of such a thing, so I&#39;ll crea=\r\nte my own:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Playstation&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \t&lt;link-template rel=3D&quot;self&quot; param=3D&quot;id&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/items/{id=\r\n}&lt;/link&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/items/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n&lt;entry&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt; \t=\r\n&lt;link-template rel=3D&quot;self&quot; param=3D&quot;id&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/olditems/{i=\r\nd}&lt;/link&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/olditems/1234&lt;/link&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;\n\nYou only need one template, not one per entry. Also I would pu=\r\nt that into some service document and not into the search result.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now=\r\n, having this template information, we can construct resource URLs our self=\r\n. But to do so we must pass the template together with the ID, otherwise ou=\r\nr display-item webpage won&#39;t know how to generate the resource URL.\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n the HTLM becomes:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;li&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysite=\r\n.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D1234&template=3Dhttp://rest.mysite.com/items/{i=\r\nd}&quot;&gt;Playstation&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;li&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysit=\r\ne.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D1234&template=3Dhttp://rest.mysite.com/olditem=\r\ns/{id}&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This works ... but I woul=\r\nd rather just include the real resource URL instead of both the ID and the =\r\ntemplate.\n&gt; \n&gt; So again I must conclude that a consequence of using a REST =\r\nbackend, is that we must pass complete resource URLs around in our website =\r\nURLs. Adhering stricly to a backend REST API means loosing the ability to u=\r\nse short URLs in the user facing frontend.\n\nThere is something wrong in you=\r\nr overall thinking.\n\nYou&#39;d just have the fron Web app that exposes a RESTfu=\r\nl API. It would then interact RESTfully with a RESTful backend. It is simpl=\r\ny &#39;wrong&#39; to relate the URIs of the backend in any way to the URIs of the f=\r\norntend. You do not even have to make use of the same IDs as long as the fr=\r\nontend service keeps its own mapping table.\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
