Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;Speaking just for me; I really don&#39;t care what Rest says here. What&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt;interesting to me is whether this is compliant to RFC2616,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re getting from this...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional\n&gt; information about the response which cannot be placed in the\n&gt; Status-Line. These header fields give information about the server and\n&gt; about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ...to &quot;4xx responses are not allowed to have ETags&quot;, I&#39;m just not seeing\n&gt; that in there at all. A 410 response with an entity body, can obviously\n&gt; have an entity tag. Any entity body, can have an entity tag, according\n&gt; to the spec. It is &quot;information about the response&quot; to the request.\n\nAn entity tag response header gives information about an entity \navailable on the Request-URI. A 404/410 status indicates there are none.\n\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I guess we&#39;ll continue to disagree whether a 404/410 response is a\n&gt;  &gt;representation of a resource. As far as I am concerned, it is not. It&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt;the way how the server states that there is no representation it can\n&gt;  &gt;send, so an ETag on that message is meaningless.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it matter? According to RFC 2616, sec. 7:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Request and Response messages MAY transfer an entity if not otherwise\n&gt; restricted by the request method or response status code.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A 204 response, then, may not have an entity but a 410 response certainly\n&gt; can. If I&#39;m transferring an entity as part of a response, then I can give\n&gt; that entity a tag. The definition of &quot;entity&quot; in sec. 1.3 is:\n\nYes, it carries an entity. But no, the ETag header does not apply to the \nentity being returned, but to the entity available on the server.\n\n&gt; &quot;The information transferred as the payload of a request or response. An\n&gt; entity consists of metainformation in the form of entity-header fields and\n&gt; content in the form of an entity-body, as described in section 7.&quot;\n\nETag is not entity header field but a response header field, so the \ninformation above does not apply (see Section 6.2 vs 7.1).\n\n&gt; My 410 Gone response has a payload, or entity, which consists of both\n&gt; entity-headers (like ETag) and an entity-body (an HTML message). You&#39;re\n&gt; not convincing me this goes against RFC 2616.\n\nMaybe I did now.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
