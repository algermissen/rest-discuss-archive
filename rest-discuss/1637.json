Which so far it isn&#39;t but okay maybe it could\n&gt; be someday.\n&gt; \n\nThe major difference between NOM (CORBA/DCOM/RMI) and DEM (XML based web\nservices) is that the former is designed to encapsulate data and the\nlatter is meant to expose it.  The object model gives me access to the\nmethods, not the data; the document model gives me access to the data,\nnot the methods.\n\nKevin Smathers described the difference very nicely.\n\n  While you can probably think of an OO design more quickly than you can\n  a distributed document design, (and I do agree that any good designer\n  could do so), that view completely neglects what you are trying to get\n  from a loosely coupled design.  Data/method encapsulation is what you\n  are trying to avoid, not what you are trying to acheive.\n\n  That is because you are trying to avoid making assumptions about how\nyour\n  data is going to be used, and encapsulation is the means by which you \n  create those assumptions in the semantics of the methods that modify\nthe\n  data.  Someone providing a MIDI object for example might give it a\nmethod\n  to load data from a stream, play the data to an instrument, and write\nit \n  to disk.\n\n  Since I don&#39;t own a General MIDI keyboard, I would really like to\ntranslate\n  instrument numbers before playing them on my keyboard.  With a\ndocument\n  format it is easy for me to use stream tools like &#39;sed&#39; or &#39;perl&#39; to \n  manipulate the data with minimal coding.  With data encapsulation I \n  wouldn&#39;t be able to actually get at the data except through the\nmethods\n  that the original programmer provided.  If the programmer didn&#39;t\nexpect\n  me to have to modify the Instrument set, then I can&#39;t do it.\n\n  The rule of XML is that I can never even guess all of the uses to\nwhich\n  my data might be put.  Loosely coupled design is about showing data, \n  not data hiding.\n\n_________________________\nAlan Karp\nPrincipal Scientist\nDecision Technology Department\nHewlett-Packard Laboratories MS 1141\n1501 Page Mill Road\nPalo Alto, CA 94304\n(650) 857-3967, fax (650) 857-6278\nhttps://ecardfile.com/id/Alan_Karp\nhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Alan_Karp/\n \n_______________________________________________\ne-lang mailing list\ne-lang@...-os.org\nhttp://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/e-lang\n\n"}}
