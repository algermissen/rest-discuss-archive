For those clients at a browser the XML will be styled \n&gt; into HTML =\r\nvia an XSLT stylesheet.  Suppose that this styling results \n&gt; in an HTML fo=\r\nrm that the user fills in to create a Purchase Order.  \n&gt; After the user fi=\r\nlls in the form he presses &quot;Submit&quot;.  I would like \n&gt; for the Submit action=\r\n to result in kicking off some script which \n&gt; harvests the data in the HTM=\r\nL form, create an XML string from the form \n&gt; data, and then HTTP PUTs the =\r\nXML string back to the resource.\n&gt; That&#39;s where I am stuck.  I know how to =\r\nwrite some Javascript \n&gt; to harvest the form data and create an XML string,=\r\n but I \n&gt; don&#39;t know how to then HTTP PUT the XML string to the \n&gt; resource=\r\n (i.e., server).  Any ideas?  /Roger\n\nHi Roger,\n\n  People are free to corre=\r\nct me here (it&#39;s been a while), but: no browsers\nsupport HTTP PUT. I&#39;ve don=\r\ne it before by writing an applet using a recent\nversion of java and calling=\r\n that from javascript. Essentially you&#39;re using\nthe java.net.HttpURLConnect=\r\nion as an alternate HTTP implementation, because\nit *does* support PUT.\n\nOf=\r\n course, I ended up moving over to POST because hacking the server to\nsuppo=\r\nrt PUT was not allowed... This was a few years ago when we didn&#39;t have a\nni=\r\ncely documented framework from which to argue for such things :)\n\ncheers,\n\n=\r\njames\n\n"}}
