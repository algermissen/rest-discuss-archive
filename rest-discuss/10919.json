I&#39;m not a fervent opponent of \ncookies and JavaScript, indeed, I&#39;m happily using both of them. The \nreason for my original question was not that I have an urgent, very \ncomplicated problem. It&#39;s rather that I already have a working \nsolution, but if possible would like to improve it in some ways.
