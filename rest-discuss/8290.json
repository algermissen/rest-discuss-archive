It&#39;s just that those tools\n&gt; are shipping and functional, instead of existing only in the minds of\n&gt; PDF authors producing vaporware. We call these massive frameworks and\n&gt; tools HTTP clients and servers. It is a big mistake to build new\n&gt; massive frameworks on top of a massive framework if you don&#39;t need to.\n&gt; \n\nI guess I just don&#39;t consider an http server or client library &#39;a\nmassive framework.&#39; On the other hand, with 100+ million public web\nsites, plus supporting servers, proxies, and so on, the entire\ninternet _infrastructure_ is massive. I interpreted Philip&#39;s statement\nas referring to the tools to implement a specific application or site,\nnot the supporting infrastructure below that makes the implementation\npossible.\n\nWith a REST architecture, it has been possible to build out that web\ninfrastructure over time, using whatever tools or frameworks are\nappropriate for each site and it&#39;s content.  Some sites use simple\ntools, some use complex frameworks.  Many started simple and grew over\ntime.  But they all interoperate nicely, with a low cost of entry in\nterms of whats required to get started.  Tools and frameworks are good\nthings, the option to choose the appropriate tool for the job is even\nbetter.  That is a REST advantage.\n\n&gt; Of course, now the software industry will now get to compete with a\n&gt; more clueful bunch of MS HTTP products, instead of the WS-Bogus\n&gt; nonsense you could immediately write off and never think about again.\n&gt; The Astoria stuff may not be the prettiest, but it looks to me like it\n&gt; will *actually work* without an army of consultants, which is a big\n&gt; ch\n\nange.\n&gt; \nThere definitely seems to be a shift to REST from WS-*.  With the\ninternet as a working reference implementation,  I can see why.\n\nmike\n\n-- \nmikeyp@...                                                    http://www.snaplogic.org\n\n"}}
