Their genius was in recoginizing that &quot;content is king&quot; and they&#39;ve got\nthe content - and the poor schmucks trolling for something interesting to do\nwith SOAP would jump on a dressed up GET request and provide them a quick\nmarketing buzz. Can&#39;t wait for the AOL boyz to hand out the free SOAP API to\nretrieve content from their pay-to-play network... imagine where CompuServe\nand Prodigy would be today if they had something like SOAP to affect their\nreach...\n&gt; Google&#39;s Genius?\n&gt; To pick a wire format for which there are dozens of toolkits poised to\ndirectly translate the protocol into readily consumable bits.\nHow many toolkits can do HTTP GET? Correctly? Why would a stream of XML from\na response to a GET be less readily consumable?\n\n&gt; To directly test interop against a small but diverse set of platforms.\nYou don&#39;t need SOAP to do that.\n\n&gt; To provide early access to an undisclosed number of other interested\nparties.\nThey had an HTTP API that provided XML via GET - but you had to pay to play.\nIf they open that one up, you&#39;d get just as many people incorporating it\ninto products as the SOAP API.\n\n&gt; To provide a sample that runs on wide range of operating systems and\ninstruction set architectures.\nUh, so does HTTP?\n\n&gt; To document the wire protocol adequately, including all the optional type\nannotations.\n\n&gt; And to provide sufficient metadata, in the form of WSDL, so that a large\nnumber of developers can be instantly up and running.\nDon&#39;t know how to do that in pure HTTP - that&#39;s a missing piece. Not enough\nto through out the baby with the bathwater though.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Sam Ruby&quot; &lt;rubys@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, April 30, 2002 5:05 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: GoogleAPI is Rest?\n\n\n&gt; If you found that weblog entry interesting, I&#39;m sure that you will enjoy\n&gt; this one:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1351\n&gt;\n&gt; - Sam Ruby\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
