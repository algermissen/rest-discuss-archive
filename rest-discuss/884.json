The web people have this problem where the &quot;file system&quot; is global\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and they want any link to be able to point at any server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is not unique to the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t unique to the Web but it is the fundamental organizational\n&gt; principle of the Web. File systems tend to think first about local data\n&gt; and then about making remote data look like local data.\n\nThis is a generalization about &quot;file systems&quot; that isn&#39;t very useful, Paul.\nDistributed filesystems as well as many local filesytems have as their fundamental\norganizational principle exactly analogous global namespaces.  Failure to recognize\nthis (and don&#39;t feel singled out, Roy F. didn&#39;t recognize this until I encouraged\nhim to take another look at Plan 9) is one of those areas where Web folks are just\nunderinformed about the goals and current state of the art in filesystems.\n\n&gt; Anyhow, at the URI (not markup) level, the web is not a query-centric\n&gt; system it is an address-centric system.\n\nThis is another way of restating the premise, which is that URI are opaque, that\nthey are identifiers rather than semantic names.  I&#39;m not contesting that this is\nthe dogma, I&#39;m questioning its value as dogma.  I&#39;ve thought a lot about this, and\nI can&#39;t think of any good reasons why this should be so.\n\nIf you can tell me one, I&#39;ll be quite interested.\n\n&gt; We find things first and\n&gt; foremost through a domain name and an associated IP address. A decent\n&gt; distributed file system would rather not expose the machine name or IP\n&gt; address for files.\n\nThat depends on the goals of the distributed filesystem.  The two most widely used\n&quot;distributed&quot; filesystems (SMB / CIFS and NFS+autofs) use an exactly analogous\nmachine + path style of naming.\n\n&gt; So URIs should be viewed as more like the\n&gt; book-keeping identifier that the file system uses (inode) and less like\n&gt; the file name.\n\nYes, and that&#39;s damned unfortunate.  It&#39;s also a bit of an inconsistency in the\ngoals and requirements for URI --- we need to figure out whether we want URI to be\nfriendly to humans and their software tools or to be convenient for Web plumbing\nbuilders.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I interacted\nwith a file via inode number.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
