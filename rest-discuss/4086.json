How do you make a MONITOR method that\n&gt; monitored resources would generically know how to handle, given this\n&gt; requirement?\n&gt; \n&gt; Much of REST is geared towards addressing the diversity of state \n&gt; structures that may arise.\n\n\n. . . or you&#39;d just say the monitored resource can send whatever \nrepresentation it pleases (leaving aside content negotiation which \nmight perhaps be part of the original MONITOR request).  But then why \nwould it use POST to send the representation? (And how would it \ngenerically know what kind of POST structure is desired?)\n\nSeth Johnson\n\n\n\n"}}
