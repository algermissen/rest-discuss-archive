You can see my draft design at webjay.org/help/api.  Briefly, I\nhave two interfaces:\n\n* Any post to a container resource is complete.  All potential settings\nthat you might write to are required arguments.\n\n* If you want to set just one element, e.g. the title of an item, you POST\nto a URI that addresses just that element.  (This isn&#39;t in the API doc\njust yet.)\n\nSimple and clean, no messing around with half-complete representations.\n\n- Lucas Gonze\n\nOn Tue, 18 May 2004, Jeff Bone wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; More detail.  This is me getting dogmatic on the basis of some\n&gt; conversation I remember having w/ The Powers ;-) a while back.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assume I&#39;ve got a USER abstraction that is characterized as having the\n&gt; following component data:\n&gt;\n&gt;       id      (ranges over usernames like joebob)\n&gt;       firstName  (a string)\n&gt;       lastName (a string)\n&gt;       ssn (an SSN)\n&gt;       phoneNum (a phone number)\n&gt;\n&gt; and I&#39;m modeling\n&gt;\n&gt;       /Users      (abstraction of all the users known to the system)\n&gt;\n&gt; and\n&gt;\n&gt;       /Users/&lt;user&gt;      (where user is a known id;  this is an abstraction of a\n&gt; given user)\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say that /Users/&lt;user&gt; excepts POST of form variables:\n&gt;\n&gt;       id      (ranges over usernames like joebob)\n&gt;       firstName  (a string)\n&gt;       lastName (a string)\n&gt;       ssn (an SSN)\n&gt;       phoneNum (a phone number)\n&gt;\n&gt; or, looking at it from a psuedo-XML perspective:\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;User ...&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;id&gt;...&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;firstName&gt;...&lt;/firstName&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;lastName&gt;...&lt;/lastName&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;ssn&gt;...&lt;/ssn&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;phoneNum&gt;...&lt;/phoneNum&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/User&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is as follows:  is it reasonable to consider a *partial*\n&gt; representation of a thing such as a User above to *be* a representation\n&gt; of a User?  What are the semantics of the missing elements?\n&gt;\n&gt; My argument --- cribbing earlier arguments with wiser folks than myself\n&gt; --- is that if partial representations are excepted, e.g. if\n&gt; /Users/joebob can take a form just containing elements id and ssn, that\n&gt; you&#39;re in effect not doing literal REpresentational State Transfer ---\n&gt; rather you&#39;re selectively invoking one of a set of polymorphic methods\n&gt; named POST where the size of the set is determined by the total number\n&gt; of permutations of required and optional elements, with dispatch being\n&gt; done by hand over that space.  Worse, some permutations may be legal\n&gt; and unamiguous, while other may be illegal, while others may be legal\n&gt; but ambiguous.  Ugh.  In doing this, you&#39;ve in effect undermined the\n&gt; compositional complexity benefit (the O(n) vs. O(n^2) argument) of\n&gt; RESTlike systems.  Not to mention made the dispatcher / validator&#39;s job\n&gt; combinatorially harder.\n&gt;\n&gt; If, as Lucas says, representational completeness is only for PUT, then\n&gt; we&#39;ve again relegated POST to being a tunnel for arbitrary methods ---\n&gt; we&#39;re just doing the dispatch on value rather than on some discrete\n&gt; selector like method name.  Seems to me, anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; NB, aside:  yes, dispatch on content type of PUT or POSTed\n&gt; representations also muddies the water.  But better that, IMHO, than\n&gt; willy-nilly combinatorial compositional complexity.\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
