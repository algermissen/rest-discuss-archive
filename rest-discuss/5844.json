The obvio=\r\nus reason for why they do this is that there\nis limited support for tweakin=\r\ng request headers in Browserland [3] and\nall too easy (testing via browser,=\r\n etc.) to add stuff to the most\neasily editable data element - the URL. Ano=\r\nther reason why they might\ndo this is if they consider the different data f=\r\normats as separate\nresources.\n\nMy understanding is that Request Headers are=\r\n used for parametrising\nthe request [1] and the Query String is used for pa=\r\nrametrising the\nresource [2]. If this is the case then you cannot put infor=\r\nmation in\nthe Query String that belongs in the Request Header because the Q=\r\nuery\nString in some sense affects the identity of the resource but the\nRequ=\r\nest Headers don&#39;t (this is true if like me you believe that the\ndifferent f=\r\normats are not separate resources).\n\nIs this correct or am I way off?\n\nSand=\r\neep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2=\r\n616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.3\n[2] http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3=\r\n986.html#query\n[3] http://sandeep.shetty.in/2006/04/browserland-http.html\n\n"}}
