Does the payload describe a resource, or does the payload\n&gt;contain server instructions?\n&gt;\n&gt;Can you give me an two examples illustrating the difference? i.e. one\n&gt;payload that describes the resource and the other that contains server\n&gt;instructions? I&#39;m struggling to envision the second.\n&gt;\n\nOf course, because the whole notion of such a ping is a bit backwards.  What \nTechnorati should do, is have people submit their feed URLs, then do a HEAD \nrequest or a conditional GET to determine if any changes have been made.\n\nAnother way, is to make a URI for each subscriber to PUT a new &lt;updated&gt; \nvalue to.  This could be automated and password protected.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What does matter is that state transition remain within the application\n&gt;logic without being transferred between components.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not following this. How would a state transition be transferred between\n&gt;components?\n&gt;\n\nThe Technorati ping isn&#39;t really manipulating a resource using POST, it&#39;s \nsubmitting program logic to an endpoint.  The payload is not a representation \nof any resource (try to GET that URL).  The verb isn&#39;t really POST either, \nfor that matter.  It&#39;s &quot;Call method weblogUpdates.ping with the following \nparameters.&quot;  A remote procedure call involves the transfer of a state \ntransition request, not a representation of a resource.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If &lt;person&gt;bob&lt;/person&gt; is removed from /maryland, the server logic is\n&gt;based on a DIFF between the old and new version when the PUT occurs. The\n&gt;server can take any number of actions based on the fact that there&#39;s a\n&gt;&quot;missing person&quot; in maryland,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not following this either. What do you mean by &quot;the server logic is\n&gt;based on a DIFF&quot; and &quot;the fact there&#39;s a missing person in maryland?&quot;\n&gt;\n\nWell, the server can do anything in response to a PUT.  In this case, it runs \na simple diff() function to see what, if anything, has changed before it does \nthe actual write to the resource.  In the example we&#39;re discussing, the \nresult of the diff() function call will be some indication that the person \n&quot;Bob&quot; has been removed from the place &quot;Maryland.&quot;\n\nSince Bob is no longer in Maryland, the server should also change Bob&#39;s \nlocation to &quot;unspecified.&quot;  In another PUT request, Bob could be added to \nVirginia.  The result of the diff() would show this, and the server could \nchange Bob&#39;s location from &quot;unspecified&quot; to &quot;Virginia.&quot;\n\nIn each case, the request simply updates a resource, it doesn&#39;t tell the \nserver &quot;oh by the way, also change the value of some other resource.&quot;  That \nthere is a consequence of the PUT for some other resource is opaque to the \ntransfer of the representation that triggers it -- that transfer doesn&#39;t \ncontain instructions.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
