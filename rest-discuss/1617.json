BTW:  I&#39;m all for composition of\nWeb-based services, but the venerable pipeline isn&#39;t the right compositional\nmetaphor for the distributed / cross-administrative-domain case.\n\nI&#39;ll stipulate the following:  &quot;static routing&quot; i.e. path-based addressing\nmay well have its appropriate uses, but only in the context where the entire\npath is within a single administrative domain / context and only when the\nentire chain represents a single, synchronous end-to-end interaction.  Let&#39;s\ndrill down, using the following two analogous examples\n\n  http://foo.com/GET=http://bar.com/GET=http://baz.com/stuff\n  rsh foo.com rsh bar.com rsh baz.com cat stuff\n\nThink about all the ways these can break...\n\n(1)  BRITTLE.  As soon as you cross an administrative boundary, you&#39;ve\nrendered your application hopelessly brittle.  You&#39;re entirely at the mercy\nof the downstream hops -wrt- namespace continuity, connectivity,\nenvironment, reporting and management of your failure modes, etc.  What\nhappens if the originating client has connectivity the the third hop, but\nthe second hop does not for some reason?\n\n(2)  FAILURE MODES and SEMANTICS.  What happens if the second &quot;hop&quot; fails?\nThe third &quot;hop?&quot;  What should the client see?  What *can* the client know\nabout those failures?  What are the semantics of chained HTTP responses?\nOne might argue that this is nothing more than the current chained proxy\nscenario, but once you introduce additional filtering / operational\nsemantics in the intermediaries it becomes much more (IMO untenably)\ncomplex.  Proxies work because they&#39;re (more or less) transparent;  the\nentire purpose of the intermediaries in the above is to perform some\nfunction.\n\n(3)  ADMINISTRATIVE / CONFIG COMPLEXITY.  The administrative picture is\nextremely complex.  You are assuming that whatever appropriate\nadministrative relationships, etc. have been established between each\nintermediary and its downstream for any give pipeline.  For example, you\nassume that bar.com knows how to transform the representation it gets from\nbaz.com, as well as any other representation it gets.  That&#39;s not a safe\nassumption;  it will only be true with a priori arrangement / communication\nbetween baz.com and bar.com.  You could automate this by way of schemas,\nRDDL, etc. --- but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s realistic or desirable to embed\n*that* information in URI...\n\nThose comments are really just the tip of the iceberg...  I *will* admit\nthat the problems aren&#39;t as many or as serious in the case of synchronous\nHTTP pipelining as they are in the async case e.g. SOAP Routing.  In the\nlatter, not only have you surrendered all control of reliability, failure\nmodes, etc. but you ALSO have *absolutely* no way of guaranteeing that you\nknow anything at all about the state of your request once it&#39;s handed off to\nthe first hop!\n\nMultilevel pipes just aren&#39;t appropriate in the distributed / cross-domain\ncase.  Much better to maintain local control of your app *and* your failure\nmodes by having pairwise interactions with the services you need to interact\nwith:\n\nNot  \n\n  foo | bar | baz | baf &gt; out\n\nRather\n\n  foo &gt; 1\n  bar &lt; 1 &gt; 2\n  baz &lt; 2 &gt; 3\n  baf &lt; 3 &gt; out\n\nWith the latter, you have visibility to and control the entire execution\nflow and intermediate states, and can accommodate and respond to failures\nand exceptional conditions yourself, rather than relying on someone else to\ndo what needs to be done.\n\nBut all this is just explanatory overkill:  just think\n\n  research!ucbvax!dagobah!td\n\nand *shudder.*\n\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
