When I look at the HTTP spec it says &quot;The PUT method requests that the \nenclosed entity be stored under the    supplied Request-URI.&quot; This seems to be a \nlittle loosy goosy to me, as the entity is a represenation and the Request-URI \nidentifies a resource and so the thing I create (the resource) is logically \ndifferent than one particular representation of it. To illustrate this, suppose \nmy media type allows an optional create-timestamp field and my server supplies \nthe value using its own clock if the resource does not already exist. I might \nwant to allow PUT operations to do updates, but not allow them to include the \ncreate-timestamp. In fact, I might explicitly define in the media type that PUT \nrequests will be rejected if they include the create-timestamp.\n\nI don&#39;t think this violates any requirement for PUT that I can find. \nSpecifically, I don&#39;t think I see anything that requires that a if I put \nrepresentation X to resource Y and follow it by a GET that I have to get back \nthe same representation. In fact, I don&#39;t think anything requires that if I use \nPUT I have to support GET at all, let alone with the same media type, let alone \nwith the same representation provided by PUT. All that I see required is that \nPUT is idempotent and that the enclosed entity be stored under the    supplied \nRequest-URI, which doesn&#39;t seem (to me) to imply that it must be all that is \nstored. I would think that each media type can define the semantics of PUT in \nterms of how resource state is affected.\n\nIf the above create-timestamp is OK, then why not PUT for wholesale partial \nupdates? If I create a car resource with an engine within its state and then I \nPUT a new engine why can I not expect to store this engine under the original \ncar resource, so that a subsequent GET returns the car?\n\nSam Ruby in his blog \nhttp://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/02/15/Embrace-Extend-then-Innovate wrote \n&quot;Having some servers interpret the removal of elements (such as content) as a \nmodification, and others interpret the requests in such a way that elided \nelements are to be left alone is hardly uniform or self-descriptive.&quot; I think \nthis is easily disposed of. It isn&#39;t the server that interprets what to do, it \nshould be defined by the media type. \n\n\nWhat do other people think of PUT for partial updates?\n\n\n"}}
