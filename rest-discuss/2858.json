Certainly the integration\n&gt; complexity is reduced. But OTOH the effort of reaching agreement on the\n&gt; common interface is increased.\n\nWho says agreement has to be reached at all?  Take a look at the world: \n  most real innovation occurs as the result of one or a few persons \ndefining / implementing disruptive technology that has good survival \ncharacteristics.  Once &quot;in the wild,&quot; the masses simply adopt and adapt \nto this technology;  but once in the wild, this technology usually \nevolves slowly if at all.  (HTTP is certainly an example of this.)\n\nVery little if any innovation happens as the result of a \nconsensus-making process.  Progress is driven by unilateral invention, \nand the rest of the world just follows along.  Hence, optimizing a \nsoftware architecture on its ability to minimize consensus-making \nefforts among its users is, IMHO, of little real value --- \n*particularly* if doing so increases the cost of its actual deployment \nand usage in the field.\n\n&gt; For multiple interfaces that&#39;d give us,\n&gt;\n&gt;   O(NlogN)     cost of integration (ie. NlogN implemented interfaces)\n&gt;   O(NlogN)     cost of agreement   (ie. NlogN bilateral agreements)\n&gt;\n&gt; For a common interface it&#39;d give us,\n&gt;\n&gt;   O(N)         cost of integration\n&gt;   O(2^N)       cost of agreement\n\nModification:  need to &quot;weight&quot; these costs.  As mentioned above, I \nbelieve that the top weight is in practice much greater than the bottom \nweight;  lots of effort gets spent on agreement, but most real progress \nhappens by fiat or near-fiat.  (Case study:  rate of RFCs from IETF \nmodulo number of participants at IETF meetings over history;  standards \nevolution through RFCs.)\n\n&gt; Notice that the cost of agreement won&#39;t scale down to the typical case\n&gt; for the common interface in the same way as it does for multiple\n&gt; interfaces, because the common interface still requires global\n&gt; agreement whether or not all parties need to communicate with each\n&gt; other.\n\nIt would be interesting to consider what the far-reaching implications \nare when you start with a bias of &quot;everyone needs to *be able to* talk \nto everyone else&quot; vs. &quot;each party only needs to be able to talk to \ncertain other parties.&quot;  Also interesting:  whether and to what extent \nassumption of a priori knowledge of &quot;co-communicants&quot; has any impact.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, the numbers above generate the exact opposite of the\n&gt; typical &quot;network effect&quot; on the common interface model ... we actually\n&gt; end up with _decreasing_ returns to scale.\n\nOnly if agreement-cost is weighted equal to or greater than \nintegration-cost...\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
