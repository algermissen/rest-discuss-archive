People put \nthings on the web so they are universally accessible, people share \nthings so they can be seen by others, that&#39;s the whole damn point.\n\nThe dissertation and the REST style is truly brilliant, and was applied \nto reality to make something great, that tradition should be the key \nfocus of RESTafarians, there are some brilliant minds here who \nunderstand things well and who can really make a big difference to many \npeople, and the web, at a time when it&#39;s really needed, and when people \nare grokking universality and want to clean up the stateful unrestfulweb \n2.0 crap of the last decade.\n\nBest intentions,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
