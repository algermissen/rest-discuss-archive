The first is its\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HTTP heritage with headers, status codes, etc. (and is under-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; appreciated or misunderstood, hence things like SOAP). The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; second, though, is a design paradigm like OO that prescribes how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; state and transitions are captured in representations that are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; exchanged during the request-response pattern. Tim&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; moment was about the second.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s solely the second.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a hard time accepting this absolute statement.\n\nEr, well, sometimes it is better to have a hard time.  The former\nis web architecture and the latter is REST.\n\n&gt; Most\n&gt; discussions on this list revolve around how to use http methods,\n&gt; status codes, and headers to map REST concepts into HTTP. While REST\n&gt; might be conceptually larger, it is bounded by its HTTP heritage.\n\nBounded?  No way.  It isn&#39;t even 1/3rd of the style.\n\n&gt; While they aren&#39;t the same, they are Siamese twins. In other words,\n&gt; would you give a talk about REST and never mention HTTP and its\n&gt; methods, codes, and headers?\n\nYes, I have, though most of the time I give talks about the evolution\nof web architecture along with REST.\n\nThat said, the purpose of this list (as Mark set it up) is to offer\nboth discussion of the style and implementation advice regarding\nweb architecture.  That&#39;s why there is so much discussion of HTTP.\n\nI think people do a real disservice to the reader when they start\nmixing up architecture and architectural style.  REST, as a style,\nexists independent of the Web&#39;s timeline.  HTTP, in contrast, has to\nbe viewed through the limitations of particular implementations.\nREST wouldn&#39;t be a very good abstraction if its understanding\ndepended on the details of today&#39;s implementations (which are far\nless limited than those of 1997, 1995, and 1993).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
