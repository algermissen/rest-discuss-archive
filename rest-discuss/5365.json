The only place\nwhere the word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I\ncomplain about the opaqueness of cookies. In fact, RESTful\napplications are, at all times, encouraged to use\nhuman-meaningful, hierarchical identifiers in order to maximize\nthe serendipitous use of the information beyond what is\nanticipated by the original application.&quot;    (1SK)\n\n  -- http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3232   \n(1SL)\n\nHere somebody distinguishes between &quot;opaque&quot; and &quot;generic&quot; URLs:\n\n&gt; http://www.webreference.com/html/tutorial2/1.html\n\n\nSeth Johnson\n\n&quot;Dr. Ernie Prabhakar&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Lucas & Jon,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 31, 2005, at 12:55 PM, Lucas Gonze wrote:\n&gt; &gt; As far as I understand it, the point is to use either HTTP or a\n&gt; &gt; hypertext document format when the client and server have to agree\n&gt; &gt; on the terms of an interaction.  An example of doing it with HTTP:\n&gt; &gt; the Accept request header and Content-type response header.  An\n&gt; &gt; example of doing it with hypertext: a host returns an HTML form for\n&gt; &gt; a client to fill in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A big part of the benefit is that RESTful interactions should be\n&gt; &gt; self-documenting.  HTTP URIs are opaque by definition, so when you\n&gt; &gt; move the interaction into the URI the interaction is hidden within\n&gt; &gt; the URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm.  Are we *only* discussing opacity in the context of &quot;data:&quot; URIs?\n&gt; \n&gt; Or is there a general principal that the server-side processing --\n&gt; once its been properly routed -- should not require any knowledge of\n&gt; the actual URI, much less try to parse it?  That is, all processing\n&gt; should operate on the document itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Ernie P.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------\n&gt; Ernest N.
