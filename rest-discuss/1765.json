Obviously there is some subset of the\nrelational world for whom it is practical and feasible to separate SQL\nfrom relational. But the much larger subset spends their day working in\nSQL and need to solve problems in SQL. There are few proposed\nalternatives to SQL and their deployment costs would be massive. So you\nwill not find many programmers outside of the academy who strongly\nseparate theory and practice. The same is true of REST.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
