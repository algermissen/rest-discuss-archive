If something is to return information\n&gt; it should have a URL. Here there is very clearly overlapping of\n&gt; concerns as explained above. What is the url for information for one\n&gt; identity here? I have a large alarm bell ringing when I read sections\n&gt; such as: &quot;Fetch message&quot; and &quot;store message&quot;. Is that not the\n&gt; equivalent of HTTP GET and PUT?\n\n&gt;     -b- query language: SPARQL though not yet finished does\n&gt; everything that is needed here as shown in the example given at [1]\n\nDisclaimer: I&#39;ve looked through the attribute exchange draft, but  \nhaven&#39;t studied it; the following is not, I think, dependent on the  \nfine details.\n\nMy feeling is that SPARQL is not a good fit here, because this might  \nbe a case where a RESTful approach is not ideal.\n\nAttribute exchange is pretty fundamentally a conversation: if I want  \nto get a set of Ignatius&#39;s attributes from you, I have to assure  \nmyself of who you are, but you also have to either (a) assure  \nyourself of who I am, and that I am permitted to get all of  \nIgnatius&#39;s attributes, or (b) I have some other legitimate need to  \nget this information, which fits in with a pre-existing policy:\n\n   me: tell me Ignatius&#39;s age\n   you: why do you want to know?\n   me: I&#39;ll only sell him drink if he&#39;s over 18\n   you: OK: he&#39;s over 18, but I&#39;m not telling you his birthday\n   me: that&#39;ll do\n\nWhen fully general, this turns into a decidedly non-trivial problem.\n\nThe simpler case which seems to be suggested in OpenID docs and the  \nattribute exchange draft, of allowing the (human) OpenID owner to  \nchoose on the fly what attributes are released to a relying party,  \nstill involves a three-way interaction, between the relying party,  \nthe IdP and the human.  Although you can characterise that as a GET  \nwhich might take a long while to be retrieved (when will the user  \ncome back from coffee?), it feels a bit forced to me.  It&#39;s doable,  \nbut it&#39;s not clear how `this is who I am and why I want your  \nbirthday&#39;, or even just `this is who I am&#39;, would be included in the  \nSPARQL request.\n\nThe case which you describe in your (excellent) [1] is, I think, the  \nmost basic case, where all the attributes are available without any  \npolicy at all, and the problem is simply how does one associate  \nIgnatius&#39;s FOAF file with his OpenID.  Now, OpenID is about keeping  \nthings simple, and it might be deemed valuable to keep things  \nprecisely this simple; in that case, a pointer to a FOAF file would  \nindeed be hugely simpler than a new protocol.\n\n&gt; [1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/foaf_openid\n\n\n\nSeparately:\n\n&gt; PS.  Now criticism (1) above is a little tricky perhaps because if\n&gt; the Identity Provider has no say\n&gt; over the OpenId resource, and that is used to point to personal\n&gt; information, then the open id could be describing itself in ways that\n&gt; would be completely unacceptable to the organisation controlling the\n&gt; Identity Provider. So there may be a good reason to have it have some\n&gt; control over the OpenId, or  for one to want to ask it questions\n&gt; regarding the identity of the person associated with that id.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my view what will happen is that in the end all identity providers\n&gt; will have control of their openid they give out. So as Sun gives out\n&gt; http://openid.sun.com/bblfish so visa will give out\n&gt; http://visa.com/iod/1231341 and there will then be my personal openid\n&gt; foaf file, which will link them all together (if I want to).\n\nCan you elaborate on this?  Do you just mean that sun.com might not  \nwant openid.sun.com/bblfish to be able to say &#39;My politics are X&#39;?\n\nMy first reaction to such a prohibition would be that it  \nmisunderstands what (I think) OpenID is clever about.  OpenID avoids  \nsome of X.509&#39;s problems by _not_ making any link between online and  \noffline entities.  So, pace Tim Bray in [a], all an OpenID says is  \nthat its owner is the same person over time; the IdP doesn&#39;t warrant  \nthat the name means anything.  The IdP doesn&#39;t even warrant that the  \nattributes it&#39;s supplying are true, simply that these are honestly  \nwhat the offline human told it to say.\n\nOr am I missing your point?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nNorman\n\n[a] http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/24/OpenID#p-3\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------\nNorman Gray  :  http://nxg.me.uk\neurovotech.org  :  University of Leicester, UK\n\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-5-1001567314\r\nContent-Type: application/pkcs7-signature;\n\tname=smime.p7s\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=smime.p7s\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-5-1001567314--\r\n\n"}}
