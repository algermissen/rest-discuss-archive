REST is a guide.  It\n&gt; helps you understand, in this case, the costs of using POST to do what\n&gt; you&#39;d normally use PUT for.  It doesn&#39;t say &quot;Though must use PUT to do\n&gt; PUT-like things&quot;, nor does anybody here say that, except when the\n&gt; context is doing things perfectly RESTful ... which is very often a\n&gt; great objective to shoot for, but sometimes (though not as often as many\n&gt; would believe) unattainable.\n\nHi Mark,\n\nI am certain that I do not have this all wrong.  My comments here are for\npeople like me who are interested in the work of taking this guide and\nputting it into practice.  Putting it into practice means comments about\nboring things like broken software, which is why I am reporting on my\nexperience with broken software.  In the long run the faction that this\nmakes sense to will use this kind of report to make doing things in a\nRESTful way attainable.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
