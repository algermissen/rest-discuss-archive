I agree!  The\n&gt; &gt; Meta-Location header provides the URL to the service&#39;s authoritative\n&gt; &gt; service description.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of introducing a new header for this, couldn&#39;t you just stick\n&gt; with the standard OPTIONS method? If you have one authoritative bit of\n&gt; metadata that you want to keep in a separate document, respond with\n&gt; a &quot;303 See Other&quot;; and if there are multiple documents, that could turn\n&gt; around an respond with either Content-Type specific documents, and/or\n&gt; for\n&gt; finer grained control, a &quot;300 Multiple Choices.&quot;\n\n&quot;standard OPTIONS method&quot;?  There is no such thing.  Don&#39;t be under the\nillusion that you are using something &quot;that already exists&quot;.  You are\nredefining/adding-to the semantics of the OPTIONS method, i.e., there is\nno server in the world that understands OPTIONS &lt;url&gt; means it should\nreturn the metadata document for a service.   \n\nTo recap:\n\n* Yes, the OPTIONS verb is a viable alternative to the using the \nMeta-Location header.  There are pluses and minuses to each approach.\n*  However, you still need the Meta-About header to solve the problem\nof allowing third parties to add metadata about a resource (see below).\n \n&gt; If a time comes when search engines are able to parse and understand\n&gt; semantically marked up documents, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just have\n&gt; a link to the service right in the document itself instead of\n&gt; introducing\n&gt; a custom header?  \n\n&quot;link to the service right in the document itself&quot; ... You mean mandate\nthat every metadata description document must contain  buried within it\na URL to the service it describes?  Consequently, tools must delve into\n(and understand the semantics of) the metadata description document to\nextract the URL, right?  For example, an aggregator tool which, say,\nwants to collect together the URLs of all metadata descriptions which\nrefer to some vendor&#39;s service must parse through every metadata\ndescription document to extract the URL.  Yikes!  Not very RESTful is\nit?  This would be analogous to forcing caching tools to examine (and\nunderstand) the contents of every message to decide whether it should\ncache the message.  No, this Meta-About URL needs to be in the HTTP\nheader.  /Roger\n\nP.S. RDF engines that do inductive/deductive reasoning are already here.\n\n\n"}}
