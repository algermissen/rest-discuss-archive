Is this something worth\n&gt; pursuing?  Having a well defined set of URIs might be quite useful,\n&gt; especially in a REST context.\n\nIt&#39;s done quite frequently - eg:\n\nhttp://www.example.com/robots.txt\nhttp://www.example.com/favicon.ico\nhttp://www.example.com/w3c/p3p\n\nHowever, it is regarded by some (myself included) as an anti-pattern.\nThere is a TAG issue about it here:\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#siteData-36\nThere is no accepted solution yet.\n\nThe problem is that the web architecture doesn&#39;t have a notion of a\n&quot;web site&quot;.  Assuming that users can put documents at any location is\nunrealistic, many users have only a certain path prefix delegated to\nthem eg: /~user/index.html\n\nIt has a feeling of land grab by standard committee too. I don&#39;t like\nthe idea that the W3C or whoever can suddenly tell me,\nretrospectively, that I can&#39;t put files in certain locations because\nthose locations now have a special meaning.\n\nSome of the proposed solutions that I can remember were:\n\n* Use the MGET method to get metadata about a URL, which could contain\npointers to appropriate locations.\n\n* Use Link headers in response to HEAD or GET.\n\n* Use link constructs in the representation, eg HTML &lt;link&gt; elements.\n\n* A quirky DNS lookup thing, that I&#39;ve forgotten the name of.\n\n-- \nDave\n\n\n"}}
