I think they started assuming either typical EDI\n&gt;&gt;&gt; transport mechanisms or SOAP.)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is the answer mail &lt;http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/ubl-dev/200802/msg00052.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I would not read that answer, and especially the followup, the way you\n&gt; did in your summary.  The responders do not seem to have thought of\n&gt; the issue very deeply, but appear to be to be sympathetic.  They\n&gt; appear to have assumed a message-passing architecture (that is, they\n&gt; do assume a processing intention in that sense), not a REST or\n&gt; resource-oriented architecture.\n\nWell, yes :-) What I wanted back then was to see if there was interest in the UBL community to bring UBL &#39;on the Web&#39;. I did not have a &#39;mission&#39; to actually do that.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I also got the idea that if somebody knew how to define a UBL media\n&gt; type or two, they might like it.\n\nMaybe - OTH, I understood from the response that UBL is not meant to be used without an acompanying agreement tailored towards the communicating partners. I think the position is that UBL itself is not contracturally binding enough to work without such side agreements. But of course I might have completely misunderstood that.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Where did you get &quot;They were not really interested because they said\n&gt; UBL was intended as message payload (paraphrasing) and should not\n&gt; contain &#39;processing intention&#39;&quot;?\n\nIt was the memory of the mail before I had found it in the archive. Not very precise :-)\n\nAre you interested in persuing a UBL (procurement) media type? I lack the knowledge of the real world supply chain to judge whether a general format is suitable for a reasonable percentage of actual requirements.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
