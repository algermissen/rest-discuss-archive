This means creating the REST API first and then only using that for f=\r\netching data to display in the website. This leads to some troubles with UR=\r\nLs for the website - especially how the web URL should identify the REST re=\r\nsources to display.\n\nIn a traditional website there is a tight integration =\r\nto the backend database. This means we can use DB identifiers and readable =\r\nnames in our URLs. Something which most people agree on is good for SEO. Ex=\r\nample: to show Peters blog we use the URL http://www.mysite.com/blogs/peter=\r\n.\n\nBut what happens if the backend is a REST API? Now we cannot just write =\r\n&quot;peter&quot; in the URL since this tells us nothing about how to fetch the &quot;pete=\r\nr&quot; resource. We must instead include the whole URL for the &quot;peter&quot; resource=\r\n. This URL could be http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/peter which would serve an=\r\n ATOM feed for our website to format and display nicely. From this follows =\r\nthat our website URL must include the url encoded &quot;peter&quot; reference. Now ou=\r\nr URL becomes:\n\n  http://www.mysite.com/blogs/http%3a%2f%2frest.mysite.com%=\r\n2ffeeds%2fpeter\n\nThe downside of this is that our web URL becomes SEO unfri=\r\nendly, unreadable and impossible to remember. The upside is that we can now=\r\n display *any* ATOM feed on our website, not just our own feeds, which in t=\r\nurn happens to be both good and bad. It&#39;s bad because evil persons can craf=\r\nt a URL with a reference to an evil hackers ATOM feed and make it look like=\r\n a URL to our site. It&#39;s good because it gives us much more flexibility.\n\nI=\r\n could of course publish a URL template for my ATOM resources, stating that=\r\n &quot;peter&quot; can be mapped to http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/peter. \n\nBut the use=\r\n of URL templates makes link relations in the ATOM feed less usefull. A lin=\r\nk relation must include the complete URL to the related resource. So an ATO=\r\nM related link to &quot;older entries&quot; could be http://rest.mysite.com/feeds/pet=\r\ner?page=3D2. Now we *have* to put this complete reference into our website&#39;=\r\ns URL:\n\n  http://rest.mysite.com/blogs/peter/http%3a%2f%2frest.mysite.com%2=\r\nffeeds%2fpeter%3fpage%3d2\n\nSo our website&#39;s URL becomes more and more obscu=\r\nre if we really don&#39;t want to know anything about the REST API&#39;s url templa=\r\ntes.\n\nHave I missed something? Comments?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n"}}
