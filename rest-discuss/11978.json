Most commonly, this\n&gt; &gt; includes content type and language.\n&gt;\n&gt; Different-language versions are rarely fungible in the way that\n&gt; different-content-type versions are.\n\nSaying that content types are fungible is fallacious. One HTML representation of\na resource may be totally different from another. Web architecture does not\nmandate that resource variants be either fungible or canonical representations.\nEven then, I&#39;m unsure what fungibility would have to do with anything.\n\nA key concept of Webarch is that resources may have multiple representations,\nand that these can be navigated by the UA. By designing a site that ignores this\nprovision totally, you&#39;re missing out on some low-hanging fruit.\n\n&gt; Even then the concept is fraught with leaky abstractions, but at least it\n&gt; remains in the realm of formalisms rather than touching on human culture. All\n&gt; the really painful problems in computing lie at its intersection with culture:\n&gt; scripts/writing systems, languages, datetimes, finance, etc. Humans are\n&gt; holistic and messy.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what this is meant to mean. Are you saying that the split between\nresource and representation is a leaky abstraction? Sure, it&#39;s not perfect, but\nfor the most part it works, and is a core part of Webarch.\n\nProviding two language variants of a resource is no more a profound statement of\nabsolutes than providing two media types. It&#39;s simply a way of advertising\nalternate representations of a single resource using the standard provisions of\nHTTP. I don&#39;t see the problem.\n\n-- \nNoah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n\n"}}
