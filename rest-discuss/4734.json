I have two questions.\n\nRoy T. Fielding wrote:\n&gt; That is why it is more efficient in a true\n&gt; REST-based architecture for there to be a hundred different methods\n&gt; with distinct (non-duplicating), universal semantics, than it is to\n&gt; include method semantics within the body of a POST.  Inspecting message\n&gt; bodies to determine message semantics will always be slower than\n&gt; placing the method up front.\n\nDo you agree that it would be better if human user agents\nsending HTML forms just put the contents of the &lt;form method=&quot;&quot;&gt;\nattribute in the HTTP method field, no matter what the value is?\n\nThat way the server can honour the method or return an error, and\nthere is no more subsetting HTTP; you can use PUT or whatever you\nlike in your HTML form.\n\n&gt; I really should extend the table to include all of the methods that\n&gt; webdav has added, just to show how disastrous it was to create PROP*\n&gt; (duplicating semantics) instead of linking to the set of properties\n&gt; as a separate resource. Maybe someone else has time to add that to the \n&gt; wiki.\n\nIt comes as news to me that PROP* is disastrous. I studied\nWebDAV this week and thought exactly the same thing; these\nproperties could be in a representation, or a seperate\nsubordinate resource.\n\nDo you have this opinion about any of the other methods in\nWebDAV, such as LOCK, UNLOCK, MKCOL? I wondered why one\ncouldn&#39;t just create a lock or collection with POST. I asked\nhow to do Wiki rollback with REST/HTTP here a while back\n(lots of Wiki software uses GET with a verb in the URL) and\none of the suggestions was to use WebDAV COPY and MOVE.\n\nI think I&#39;m having difficulty making a value judgement as to\nwhen one needs a new method in the protocol versus a new\nresource.\n\n=vdm\n\n"}}
