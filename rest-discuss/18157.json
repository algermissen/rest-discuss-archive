The only problem I have with \nit is the development overhead needed for reading out semantic data in M2M \nscenarios. Why? Because there is no standard generic way of embedding \nmachine readable data in HTML. Yes, it is possible to use tables and other \nmarkup elements as you describe. But you will have to handcraft the decoding \non the client side for each and every resource type.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t have to learn some new, undocumented media type by reverse-\nengineering a system&#39;s functionality.\n\nThis is where I do not agree. Yes, the media type is well known, but the \nembedding format is not. Now you need to reverse engineere how the domain \ndata is embedded.\n\nI have the same problem with micro formats: they work nicely with HTML, but \nyou have to write specialized encoders/decoders for each and every format \nout there.\n\nCompare this to a generic serialization format like XML or JSON where \nencoding and decoding comes for free for just about all object formats.\n\nRDFa could be a solution to this, but its triplet semantics requires some \nthinking out of the box for object encoding.\n\nAnd, yes, I am a big fan of tools that helps consumers of my API getting \nstarted without too much overhead. For instance by supplying an XML schema \nthey can use to auto-generate code - the .NET XML serializer has no problem \nignoring unknown elements so the server can evolve without breaking the \nclient.\n\nNow, if it was possible to find a generic and standardized way of embedding \nmachine readable data in HTML such that you could have generic serializers \nas if it was XML, then I would love to use it!\n\n/Jørn\n\n\n"}}
