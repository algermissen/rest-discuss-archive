If you want to specifically accuse someone of handwaving, then\n&gt;  do so.\n\nI was going for more of an &quot;I don&#39;t want to start something&quot; preface,\nand I figured naming names would be more along the things of an &quot;I\nwant to start something... with you, you, and YOU&quot; preface. If I was\nunclear, I do apologize.\n\n&gt;  Use cookies; abstract your login code out of the view so that it can be\n&gt;  reused when some a non-browser client wants to authenticate.\n\nOr even when a smarter browser does, right.\n\n&gt;  If you want to see a system that does cookies + www-authenticate, look\n&gt;  at Zope2/Plone. There&#39;s plenty of implementation in there.\n\nThanks, I&#39;ll look at that.\n\n&gt;  When you do log out, be sure to reset the cookie, clear down any session\n&gt;  state, and redirect the user off the logout. That&#39;s so you don&#39;t get to\n&gt;  log in via the back button. Most frameworks I&#39;ve seem expect you to do\n&gt;  this yourself. Try not to log users out with GET (if you must show a\n&gt;  link, at least trap it and call POST via javascript).\n\nLogin and -out are both POSTs, tentatively. And yeah, if there&#39;s\nJavascript, I shouldn&#39;t have to use cookies (barring any showstopping\n&quot;but then the interface changes too drastically&quot; issues).\n\n&gt;  Live with POST, understand the implications of overloading. Mostly, the\n&gt;  implication is that frameworks (and standards) that derive from the\n&gt;  worldview that everything&#39;s a form or a CGI suck. They are optimized for\n&gt;  you to write stupid code by default. To be clear, that&#39;s a lot of\n&gt;  frameworks, and a lot of specs. If you&#39;ve only ever worked inside such\n&gt;  frameworks and to such standards (eg if your experience is limited to\n&gt;  RPC WS-* stacks and/or Struts action controllers), you might think it&#39;s\n&gt;  fine in the same way Blub programmers think Blub is fine.\n\nI&#39;m more of an &quot;Ah ha, *that&#39;s* what I&#39;ve never liked any of those\nframeworks&quot; person. I could never put a finger on it, until (and now I\ncan&#39;t remember how) I stumbled across a REST article, and hunted down\nmore, and the more I read, the more I went &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s *exactly*\nwhat I&#39;ve been doing - only incompletely and hampered by the feeling\nthat I ought to somehow be being more RPC/MVC/etc.-ish. If that makes\nany sense.\n\n&gt;  You can workaround HTML forms limitations using Javascript:\n\nYes, thanks. I do plan to make use of that at the first opportunity.\n\n"}}
