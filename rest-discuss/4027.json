Some URIs also contain what might be viewed as\nan address involving multiple indirect mappings, and very few URIs\ncontain a directly addressed maping (e.g., file://127.0.0.1/).\n&quot;http&quot; URIs, in particular, have at least one mandatory indirect\nmapping, which makes them capable of referencing any concept.\n\n&gt; Hmm, propably my non-understanding can also be expressed like this:\n&gt; How can an architectural style for distributed systems use object \n&gt; references\n&gt; (here URIs) as object references AND names for abstract concepts?\n\nBecause they are not object references -- they reference resources.\nBTW, it is a style for network-based systems -- &quot;distributed&quot; means\nsomething else.\n\n&gt; [You just cannot reference an asbtract concept directly, you can only \n&gt; refer\n&gt; to it by name.]\n\nYou cannot access an HTTP-based resource directly, either.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
