Indeed the part  \n&gt; focusing on\n&gt; text/uri-list doesn&#39;t mention this purpose. Good separation of  \n&gt; concerns.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m happy if that&#39;s the way one can interpret this:\n\n&quot;Intended usage : Limited Use\nThe text/uri-list media type is intended for use in applications which  \nutilize URIs for replicated resources.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s what it says in the RFC as part of the application to register  \nan official IANA type.\n\n&gt; Of itself, it is a format that encodes a list of zero or more URIs  \n&gt; along\n&gt; with optional comments. If that solves your purposes then I don&#39;t  \n&gt; see a\n&gt; problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would it be better to a) invent a new media type in the vnd tree,  \n&gt; b)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; use text/uri-list beyond its original scope or c) draft a new RFC  \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this?\n&gt;\n&gt; d) Use text/uri-list in what I&#39;m not sure is beyond its original scope\n&gt; at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, my further thought is wondering whether it is suitable for the\n&gt; hypertext document that SHOULD accompany a 301, 302, 303 or 307. The\n&gt; gist of such a note would be a single URI, which it could certainly\n&gt; provide, though there is no semantics for clearly indicating that this\n&gt; URI should now be followed beyond the use of comments.\n&gt;\n\nI think it would be ideal for a 300.\n300, 301 and 302 all require the URI the UA is being redirected to  \ninside a Location header. But RFC 2616 also says &quot;Unless the request  \nmethod was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short  \nhypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).&quot;, I wonder what the  \nuse case for URI(s) instead of URI is, but if it&#39;s to let the client  \nknow about alternative URIs, text/uri-list would be a perfect match  \neven in its constrained usage.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\n"}}
