One part of reliability is disk-backed queuing in case of\ncrashes. I think that&#39;s a software issue, not a protocol issue.\n\nAnother part of reliable messaging as it is normally implemented is\nqueuing. I think that this is probably an orthogonal issue to actual\nreliability.\n\nThe main part is once and only once delivery. This only matters for\nnon-idempotent methods (primarily POST). As far as I know, the only\nprotocol issue (as opposed to software issue) is some form of ID that\nensures that the same thing (e.g. purchase order) is not POSTed twice.\nShould there be a convention for doing it so that it need not be always\ndone at the application level? There must be a reason that HTTP doesn&#39;t\nhave this already.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
