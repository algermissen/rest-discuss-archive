What is the canonical example\n&gt; of a &quot;resource&quot; v. a &quot;representation&quot;? Say I wanted to look up trains\n&gt; from London to North Berwick - is the URL of the query a representation\n&gt; of the timetable resource?\n\nThe timetable is a resource. A URL is never a representation: the\nrepresentation is the stuff that gets sent across the wire: the XML or\nXHTML or whatever. It is what you GET and PUT.\n\nHere&#39;s the radical bit: ideally there would be *no* query in this\nsystem. Let&#39;s say the XML was organized like this:\n\n&lt;routes&gt;\n   &lt;route from=&quot;http://train.com/cities/London&quot; \n\tto=&quot;http://trains.com/cities/NorthBerwick&quot; \n\thref=&quot;http://trains.com/routes/LondonToNorthBerwick&quot;/&gt;\n   \n&lt;/routes&gt;\n\nThen you have the document:\nhttp://trains.com/routes/LondonToNorthBerwick\n\nIt has:\n\n&lt;times&gt;\n  &lt;time&gt;ISODATE1&lt;/time&gt;\n  &lt;time&gt;ISODATE2&lt;/time&gt;\n  &lt;time&gt;ISODATE3&lt;/time&gt;\n  &lt;time&gt;ISODATE4&lt;/time&gt;\n  &lt;time&gt;ISODATE5&lt;/time&gt;\n&lt;/times&gt;\n\nNow you get into this service through the &quot;routes&quot; document above,\nfollow the hyperlink to the &quot;ondonToNorthBerwick&quot; document and find the\ninformation you need. You&#39;ve never done a query and you&#39;ve never had to\nsend complex XML.\n\nWhen you do it this way:\n\n 1. the client&#39;s access to the data is not mediated by any API or\nmessaging interface. This is very much in the XML spirit of &quot;give me the\ndata and I (the client) will figure out what to do with it.\n\n 2. you cannot generate a &quot;bad query&quot; by trying to get from London,\nOntario to North Berwick, Scotland (nor North Berwick Maine to London,\nEngland!). If there is no link for that route then you can&#39;t get there.\n\n 3. the client can discover routes, rather than merely generate them and\ntest whether they exist or not. For instance it could say: &quot;hmmm. I\nnotice a route from London to Glasgow and Glasgow to North Berwick.\nMaybe this is also interesting to my user.&quot;\n\n 4. the standardization of the &quot;routes&quot; format and the &quot;times&quot; format\ncan actually be fairly disconnected. For instance we might use the same\n&quot;times&quot; format for airlines and trains but the &quot;routes&quot; format might be\ndifferent. Or else we could use XML extensibility features to share both\nbut have different details on both.\n\n 5. the server can easily serve these as either dynamic OR static\ndocuments. The performance advantages to the latter should be obvious. \n\n&gt;... That seems simple enough, but what is the\n&gt; representation that I send - one representation of the train route from\n&gt; London to North Berwick, or a combination of representations for the\n&gt; locations of London and North Berwick?\n\nIt&#39;s like asking how you model objects in an OO systems. I guess I would\ntend towards breaking things apart rather than combining them but that&#39;s\njust a very rough rule of thumb. But note that the question is really\nhow you break out the *resources*. Representations just represent\nresources on the wire.\n\n&gt; I like the way that W3C specs come with &quot;this version&quot; and &quot;latest\n&gt; version&quot; links at the top, and I find it frustrasting that I can&#39;t refer\n&gt; to resources in Visual SourceSafe in the same way, so I think I&#39;m making\n&gt; progress...\n\nYep, using hyperlinks like that is very resty. Visual SourceSafe\nprobably has an &quot;API&quot; that allows you to access older versions through\ncode. That&#39;s a very &quot;SOAP-y&quot; way to look at it.\n\n&gt;....\n&gt; &gt;XForms *does* have GET support.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Can XForms understand GET or POST Web Services described in WSDL? I\n&gt; imagine WSDL is a bit short on form layout details, but does XForms have\n&gt; helpful deaults?\n\nXForms does not know anything about WSDL. After all the former is a W3C\nspecification and the latter has only just begun its standardization\nprocess. And anyhow, they are kind of parallel specifications. WSDL is\nused to map the interface to a web site into an interface suitable for\nprogrammers. XForms is used to map it into an interface suitable for\nhumans. There wouldn&#39;t be that much in common between them other than\nthe XML Schema.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe xml-dev list is sponsored by XML.org &lt;http://www.xml.org&gt;, an\ninitiative of OASIS &lt;http://www.oasis-open.org&gt;\n\nThe list archives are at http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe from this list use the subscription\nmanager: &lt;http://lists.xml.org/ob/adm.pl&gt;\n\n"}}
