I&#39;ve tried to express it in a number\nof different forums in a number of different ways, each time with little\nsuccess.  I&#39;m not going to try a bit of humor to see if it helps.\n\nIt is a bit ironic that a set of architectural practices under the title of\n&quot;Representation State Transfer&quot; defines virtually nothing about the way in\nwhich state is to be represented, and instead focuses on how Objects (or\nmore precisely, resources) are to be accessed.\n\nSimilarly, I find it a bit ironic that a protocol originally created as an\nacronym for Simple Object Access Protocol specifies nothing about how an\nobject is to be accessed, but instead focuses pretty much exclusively on\nhow messages are to be represented.  For more details on this subject, see\nhttp://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/01/25/whatObjectDoesSoapAccess.html\n\nIt is very easy to come up with an example where one schema includes links\nand other does not, associate the first with a URL and place the second in\nan envelope and then portray this as a fundamental difference between SOAP\nand REST.  The truth is that HTTP nor SOAP require nor preclude &quot;proper&quot;\nlinks.\n\nSimilarly, one can come up with an example where a resource is identified\nbased on query parameters in a URL and another in which a resource is\nidentified inside the body and portray this too as a fundamental\ndifference.  This too is false as there are a number of SOAP toolkits which\nwill happily dispatch requests based on the URL.  Furthermore, REST is an\narchitectural style - it does not dictate syntax.  See\nhttp://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/002941.html for more on this\ntopic, including the views of Roy Fielding on XML itself.\n\nI will go a step further and indicate that it is possible to architect a\nsystem in accordance to the principles of REST and then implement it using\nSOAP.  In other words, these two are compatible.  I would argue that the\ndeeper issue is that SOAP does little to require such an architectural\nstyle, in fact, most of the examples to date seem to espouse a different\narchitectural style.   I discuss this further in\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1351#Analogy\n\n = = = =\n\n The reason I joined this mailing list, and have persisted, is that it is\nmy hope that some day a paper can be jointly authored which shows both SOAP\nand REST in a positive light, shows the strengths of both, and how they can\nbe used in concert.\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
