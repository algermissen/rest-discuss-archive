I\nwant to allow the end-user to choose whether they want to pass the\nGoogle &quot;key&quot; (essentially a username) as a keyword parameter or as an\nHTTP user name. I think this would be not too tricky except that I need\nto capture the HTTP user name *as* a key and pass that on to Google. The\ncode is just simple CGI for portability. The problem is that I don&#39;t\nthink that Apache is sending me the username, password or anything else\nI can use. In particular I don&#39;t get the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header. Any\nideas?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
