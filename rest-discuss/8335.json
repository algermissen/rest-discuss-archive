A\n&gt; remote call isn&#39;t the same as a local call.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I predict that whatever death may befall SOAP or WS, there will be\n&gt; another architecture attempting to do exactly that.\n\nI don&#39;t like to defend SOAP (especially in this group), but it isn&#39;t  \na RPC mechanism; it has more similarities with messaging. That&#39;s why  \nI always call it XML Messaging. Unfortunately, most of the vendors  \nhave created API&#39;s which completely ignore this messaging paradigm,  \nand indeed offer RPC-like functionality.\n\nI blame the vendors, not the spec.\n\nArjen Poutsma\n\nInterface21\nE: apoutsma@...\nW: www.interface21.com\nB: blog.interface21.com/arjen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
