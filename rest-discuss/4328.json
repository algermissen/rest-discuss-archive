Therefore, if you have\nthe same resource, you have the same function.\n\n&quot;Membership function&quot; is questionable language, IMO.  It does not\nimply a single representation at a single moment in time, so it&#39;s not\nfunctional in the formal sense.  It&#39;s a membership mapping.\n\nWhat the above means is that there exists no formal contract about\nthe objectively observable results of issuing GETs against a URI at\nany given time, or at different times.  Given that, you are in sad shape\ntrying to use REST to shore up the &quot;owl:sameAs&quot; formalism.\n\nThat said, I find Jon Hanna&#39;s example below a shocking development,\nand I wonder what value is added by saying &quot;a sameAs b&quot; when it\nleads to no meaningful expectation of interchange.  Identity Rot\nhas got to be a bad thing for Systems.\n\nWalden\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Jon Hanna&quot; &lt;jon@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;rest-discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 19, 2004 5:06 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Can a resource span across authorities?\n\n\n: &gt; http://some.org/countries/Canada owl:sameAs http://another.org/canada\n: &gt;\n: &gt; is it correct to assume that a GET on either one of them invokes\n: &gt; the same membership function?\n: &gt;\n: &gt; Or in other words: do the semantics of owl:sameAs imply that invocations\n: &gt; of a given HTTP method on any one of the URIs are equivalent?\n:\n: Ooops, I didn&#39;t mean to imply that when this came up on RDF-IG. The RDF\ntriple\n: &lt;http://some.org/countries/Canada&gt; &lt;owl:sameAs&gt;\n&lt;http://another.org/canada&gt; .\n: says that the resource identified by http://some.org/countries/Canada is\nthe\n: same resource identified by http://another.org/canada. However it does not\nsay\n: anything about what happens when you perform a GET operation on that URI,\nOWL\n: doesn&#39;t talk about HTTP operations at all (as someone interested in REST,\n: HTTP, OWL and RDF I&#39;ve looked at creating a vocabuary so that RDF *can*\nsay\n: something about that, but if I succeed I still wouldn&#39;t change the fact\nthat\n: RDF statements are about the resources, not the representations).\n:\n: Now let&#39;s say that a GET on http://some.org/countries/Canada returns this\n: document:\n:\n: &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;\n: &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;\n: &lt;html xml:lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n: &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Canada&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n: &lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada is a wonderful multi-cultural nation that combines many of\nthe\n: benefits that come from North American capitalism with a sense of social\n: justice that results in great health care and a strong govenment support\nfor\n: the arts that has enabled it to produce many of the best films in the\nEnglish\n: language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n:\n: and lets say a GET on http://another.org/canada returns this document:\n: &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;\n: &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;\n: &lt;html xml:lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n: &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Canada&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n: &lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada is such a wishy-washy liberal country that one has hardly\nany\n: personal freedom that the PC-brigade haven&#39;t trampled on. This wimpishness\nis\n: evident in their boring films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n:\n: (For the record, I&#39;d like to point out my great admiriation for Canada&#39;s\n: multi-cultural nation and their film industry in particular).\n:\n: Anyway, both of these GETs return a representation of Canada. They also\nclearly\n: disagree strongly. This is due to three things:\n:\n: 1. On a large distributed system like the web there is no way of getting\nanyone\n: to agree anyway.\n: 2. In the case of human-readable documents like the XHTML examples above a\n: belief in freedom-of-speech (whether total or restricted) would lead us to\n: consider any such mechanism for forcing agreement to be undesirable.\n: 3. People can get stuff wrong (there&#39;s nothing to stop a representation of\n: Canada from claiming that it is the country you enter by crossing the\nsouthern\n: border of Texas, or even that Canada is a type of small brightly-coloured\nfish\n: found in rivers in Central Europe.\n:\n: On the other hand the two representations *could* be identical, or one\ncould\n: reference the other as a source of further information (even in the above\n: examples one could reference the other as a source of mis-information).\n:\n: Of course in RDF we can have two contradictory statements as well, even in\nthe\n: same graph. We would conclude that the graph is invalid and it can&#39;t all\nbe\n: true - just as we would conclude that it isn&#39;t possible for both of the\n: opinions about Canada expressed above are completely true at the same\ntime.\n: Indeed while the obvious use of owl:sameAs is to merge two sources of\ntrusted\n: useful information it can be just as useful to merge two sources of\npotentially\n: useful information, detect that they contradict, and realise that at least\none\n: is incorrect.\n:\n: The closest thing in HTTP to an owl:sameAS is a 301 Moved Permanently\nstatus\n: code, since the semantics of 301 mean that not only can the GET be\nfulfilled by\n: performing it on the new URI, but that this is always the case and all\nfuture\n: uses of the former URI SHOULD use the latter. However this is a bit of a\n: stretch, and in general one shouldn&#39;t expect what RDF says about a\nrelationship\n: between to resources to necessarily be expressable in pure HTTP terms.\n:\n: The only point where RDF and REST (or more strictly, the particular\nRESTful\n: systm which is the web) coincide is that they both use URIs to identify\n: resources. HTTP gives us a way of obtaining or setting representations of\nthose\n: Resources. RDF gives us a syntax for describing those resources, including\n: those where we have no control over the server that will respond to HTTP\n: requests with the given URI. Of course a representation may well be an\nRDF/XML\n: document, but RDF is complementary to HTTP.\n:\n: -- \n: Jon Hanna\n: &lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n: &quot;.it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\n: equipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n:\n:\n:\n:\n: Yahoo!
