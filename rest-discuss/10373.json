Sessions are built right into the core of\nPHP; AFAIK you can’t even compile a PHP binary that doesn’t have\nsession support. Not that it would be much use for anything,\nbecause practically not a single PHP app in existence would run\non such a thing.\n\nThen again, the values I calculate in the templates of my\nCatalyst app start out undefined in every request, and likewise\nwould if I were using Rails, Django or whatever else. The kind of\nshared-nothingness that PHP implements by default exists every\nbit as much in MVC frameworks as it does in PHP.\n\n&gt; the success of PHP (i.e., it is widely deployed) is due, in\n&gt; some degree, to its inherent &quot;web&quot;-ness.\n\nYes, the fact that each page is ultimately a CGI that terminates\nat the end of the request cycle means that PHP apps are\nridiculously stable: there’s no long-running process that can get\nwedged, so you can leave them deployed and unmaintained for years\nand they’ll still work when you come back.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with any sort of RESTfulness. Natively\nPHP leads you toward a style where you structure your URI space\naround operations implemented by scripts which operate on things\nidentified by a database key passed via query parameter. That’s\ncrystal clear RPC style: you put the verb in the URI and use\napp-specific identifiers for your resources. PHP does not\nencourage a resource-oriented design at all.\n\nThe success of PHP as a web platform is in some sense due to\nthe same reason as Excel’s success as a desktop programming\nenvironment.\n\n&gt; Often the database access layer itself can be exposed as a\n&gt; REST/HTTP interface, so that the entire application code is a\n&gt; set of RESTful interfaces that will be consumed -- either by a\n&gt; client or by the code itself.\n\nThat’s an oversimplification, just like using an ORM directly as\nthe model in an MVC app is an oversimplification. It may work,\njust like using an ORM as the model in an MVC app works in a\npinch; but it’s not a particularly good way to go about things.\nThe logic should all be in the model, with the database serving\nas a layer below it; the controller has no other responsibility\nthan to translate from HTTP to your model. If your controller\nmethods are routinely longer than 2 or 3 lines, you’re doing\nsomething wrong.\n\n&gt; All the framework you need for most (MVC) applications is a URL\n&gt; dispatcher, a database layer or ORM, and a templating/\n&gt; presentation layer.\n\nErrm, yes, you’ve just described an MVC framework.\n\n&gt; In PHP, you have PDO, etc. for database layer, Smarty, XSLT, or\n&gt; PHP itself for templating, and you can write a URL dispatcher\n&gt; w/o too much difficulty.\n\nOr you can use a framework and not bother reinventing the URI\ndispatcher wheel yet again.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
