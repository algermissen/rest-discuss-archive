Although\n&gt;I realize that URIs are opaque, I&#39;m trying to have them look reasonable\n&gt;should people see them - the problem I&#39;m having is how to differentiate\n&gt;between &quot;give me a representation of the container&quot;, and &quot;give me a\n&gt;represenation of everything inside the container&quot;, without having the\n&gt;URIs seem very verbose.\n\nYou might find &#39;Resource Modeling and Names&#39; \n(http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/ResourceModelingAndNames) \nof use, particularly the use of a grammar to model a hierarchical \ncollection of resources.\n\nAlso :\n\n&#39;Opacity Myths Debunked&#39; \n(http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/OpacityMythsDebunked)\n&#39;Opacity Reconsidered&#39; \n(http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/OpacityReconsidered)\n&#39;Opacity Reconsidered Reconsidered&#39; \n(http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/OpacityReconsideredReconsidered)\n&#39;Naming Isn&#39;t Navigating&#39; \n(http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/NamingIsntNavigating)\n\nMark Bakers&#39;  &#39;An Investigation into the Opacity Properties of RFC 2396&#39; \n(http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/01/UriOpacityInvestigation/)\n\nand of course the definitive source on REST, Fieldings&#39; dissertation, in \nparticular Section 6.2 &#39;REST Applied to URI&#39; \n(http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2).\n\nThe forces at play here appear to be :\n\nOpacity - the URI should be opaque to all but the implementor\nIdentity - a URI is by definition an identifier of a resource and that \nidentity should be useful as an indicator of the semantics of the resource\nMaintainability - the URI set should be maintainable by the implementor\nReliability - the URI set should remain as unchanged as possible for as \nlong as possible\n\nand (somewhat dubiously)\nDiscovery - it may be useful for clients (both human and machine) to \nutilize the nature and relationship between URIs&#39; to discover other resources\n\nDepending on your situation one or more of these forces might influence the \nend result more than the others. In general it seems best practice not to \nreflect your resource *model* (i.e. relationships) directly in the URI and \nas Paul says in &#39;Common REST mistakes&#39; \n(http://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes/) &quot;In other words, your public API \nshould not depend on the structure of your URIs. Instead there would \ntypically be a single XML file that points to the components of your \nservice. Those components would have hyperlinks that point to other \ncomponents and so forth. Then you can introduce people to your service with \na single URI and you can distribute the actual components across computers \nand domains however you want.&quot;\n\nHTH\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
