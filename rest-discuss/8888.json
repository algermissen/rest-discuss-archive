Say &quot;URL=\r\n Construction&quot;\nand the RESTians stick their fingers in their ears and screa=\r\nm &quot;I don=92t hear\nyou&quot; while humming very loudly...  ;-)\n\nIOW, the phrase &quot;=\r\nURL construction&quot; it is a trigger that causes most REST\nadvocates to immedi=\r\nately become defensive rather than to be willing to\nexplore how to achieve =\r\nboth benefits of hypermedia *and* URL construction.\nIt&#39;s kinda similar to t=\r\nhe feelings that the phrase &quot;amnesty&quot; evokes in\ncertain people here in the =\r\nUS right now. ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m advocating here,  and have been on and off =\r\nas I&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt; had time, is that we should be looking at using &quot;hypermedia \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; AND url construction&quot; instead of having the false dichotomy \n&gt; &gt; of &quot;hyp=\r\nermedia OR url construction.&quot; More specifically, I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; referring to the =\r\n use of URI Templates for servers to convey \n&gt; &gt; their intentions to the cl=\r\nient via hypermedia.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the server communicates a URI template and how=\r\n it should \n&gt; be used then it IS hypermedia.\n\nYour acknowledgement here is =\r\nbegrudging rather than revelational.  It&#39;s my\nbelief we need to stop being =\r\nafraid of URI construction as a phrase and\ninstead look for how to achieve =\r\nmost or all of its benefits without causing\nharm to the REST architecture. =\r\n History has shown that any time there are\nshort term benefits to a path th=\r\nat is perceived to be harmful long term that\npeople will choose &quot;the harmfu=\r\nl path&quot; over and over. Rather than take a\npriestly position of &quot;though shal=\r\nt not&quot; it&#39;s better to find an alternate\nsolution that provides the benefits=\r\n of both paths and relieves people desire\nto take the harmful path.\n\nAnd no=\r\n Jon, I wasn&#39;t using &quot;priestly position&quot; to refer to you specifically.\n:) \n=\r\n\nBTW, one reason people don=92t do hypermedia is that most HTTP components =\r\nthat\ndo a GET just do a GET, they don&#39;t follow redirects and they certainly=\r\n don&#39;t\nparse tag soup documents to find links to follow.  It is usually an =\r\norder of\nmagnitude harder in most languages to program a system using hyper=\r\nmedia than\nit is just to construct the URL and issue a GET.  If RESTians re=\r\nally want to\npromote the use of the hypermedia constraint they need to cata=\r\nlyze the\ncreation of tools that make it brain-dead easy program hypermedia =\r\nin a\ngeneric sense.\n\n&gt; A good test of this is whether it can deal with a ch=\r\nange of \n&gt; URIs in the path, host, scheme and query string portion \n&gt; (movi=\r\nng information between each of these parts I&#39;d consider \n&gt; a plus but not a=\r\n vital necessity).\n\nHeh. Any and every REST system will fail that test.  Af=\r\nter all, how do you\nchange the entry point URL? &#39;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; One of the reasons=\r\n I believe it hasn&#39;t received &quot;enough \n&gt; &gt; attention&quot; is because it&#39;s refer=\r\nence in Roy&#39;s thesis was \n&gt; &gt; fleeting (only one sentence?), and particular=\r\ns of it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; implementation has been nebulous.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed. That concisio=\r\nn isn&#39;t a flaw though, but it does mean \n&gt; that there is a place for more d=\r\niscussion.\n\nUh, that&#39;s my point. In the past I have been told &quot;just read hi=\r\ns thesis,\nit&#39;s all there.&quot;  Heh.\n\n&gt; &gt; Here on the list when someone has ask=\r\ned for examples to \n&gt; &gt; demostrate the hypermedia constraint they have freq=\r\nuently \n&gt; &gt; been dismissively told that &quot;any web page with links is an \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n example.&quot;  While that answer might make the answerers \n&gt; &gt; feel smug, it h=\r\nas not provided acceptable guidance for \n&gt; &gt; people trying to implement the=\r\n constraint for use in \n&gt; &gt; RESTful services not targeting the browser.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Actually, it&#39;s a pretty good example in a lot of ways. \n\nA good example f=\r\nor those who already understand it, that is.\n\n&gt; The one real disservice I t=\r\nhink we do in that example is \n&gt; not saying &quot;with links or forms&quot;.\n\nThere y=\r\nou go again...  &#39;-)\n\n&gt; That it doesn&#39;t directly relate to what people are\n&gt;=\r\n thinking about when they think about media types aimed at\n&gt; other uses (pa=\r\nrticularly web services) \n\nThat&#39;s one falicy RESTians often commit; assumin=\r\ng that everyone that is\ntrying to understand REST is steeped in SOAP or RPC=\r\n.  Many web developers\n(myself included) had never used SOAP or RPC so for =\r\nus this is unnecessary\ncomplication.\n\n&gt; is a point rather than an excuse to=\r\n feel smug - web pages\n&gt; work and are presumably getting something right. I=\r\ngnoring\n&gt; the case of webservices here is a bit like a k=F4an that\n&gt; can br=\r\ning enlightenment. I don&#39;t feel smug when I refer\n&gt; to web pages as an exam=\r\nple of hypermedia, I think &quot;why\n&gt; did it take me so long to get this myself=\r\n?\n \nThe point is that just saying &quot;any web page with links and forms is an\n=\r\nexample&quot;  gives only about 20% of the guidance needed to properly implement=\r\n\na RESTful system. What&#39;s more, must of the open web is not fully RESTful,\n=\r\nbrowser-based sites are often architectured differently than REST-based web=\r\n\nservices because of the lack of PUT and DELETE support in forms and becaus=\r\ne\nof the differing needs a human has vs. a client agent.\n\nIf the answer &quot;an=\r\ny web page with links and forms is an example&quot; gave all the\nguidance needed=\r\n there would be no substantive discussion of specifics on\nthis list, and th=\r\nere are plenty of those. But the asker of the question\nneeds to first know =\r\nthe questions to ask, which often do not follow from\n&quot;any web page with lin=\r\nks and forms is an example.&quot;\n\nRather than go round and round on this, will =\r\nyou at least agree that most\npeople need more guidance than just being told=\r\n: &quot;any web page with links and\nforms is an example?&quot;    \n \n&gt; If people don&#39;=\r\nt get it from that example, I think they may \n&gt; need *lots* of examples. Ad=\r\nding RSS, ATOM, SVG, Google \n&gt; Sitemaps, RDF documents with see. \n\nYes, and=\r\n what is wrong with that?  Alternately, what&#39;s wrong with actually\nexplaini=\r\nng the concepts and constraints with examples?  I&#39;ll credit Joe\nGregorio wi=\r\nth being one of the few that does a good job with that.\n\n&gt; Also and so on m=\r\nay still not \n&gt; be enough.\n\nThat&#39;s a specious argument.\n\n&gt; Really hypermedi=\r\na is almost too simple that some people \n&gt; (focusing on other concerns, esp=\r\necially if their background \n&gt; makes RPC or other non-RESTful solutions see=\r\nm more obvious) \n&gt; can&#39;t change gears.\n\nMaybe the problem for many that can=\r\n&#39;t change gears is that the debates are\ntoo often framed on an abstract &quot;go=\r\nod&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; turning it into a religious\ndebate rather than providing exam=\r\nples that illustrate the benefits of REST\nand that speak for themselves?\n\n-=\r\n- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesigne=\r\ndurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n"}}
