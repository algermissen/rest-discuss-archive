It seems like denying caching on these URLs was  \n&gt; indeed based on a pragmatic reality that much dynamic content didn&#39;t  \n&gt; have valid cache-control headers.  The author of this wiki page,  \n&gt; anyway, seems to think the world has changed since then.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, that still begs a question that bothers me about using  \n&gt; request parameters as part of a resource identifier, especially when  \n&gt; there is more than one identifier.  Do the following URLs specify  \n&gt; the same resource?\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://localhost/mysubresource?foo=bar&baz=bop\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://localhost/mysubresource?baz=bop&foo=bar\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s good point. They do not represent the same resource. If the  \nsever thinks that the resource is indeed the same, it could very well  \nuse the Content-Location header, as in\n\nGET /mysubresource?baz=bop&foo=bar\n\n200 OK\nContent-Location: http://localhost/mysubresource?foo=bar&baz=bop\n\nso that caches can treat both resources the same.\n\n&gt; If they do (and, with my server side programming hat on, every app  \n&gt; *I* have ever written would return identical results), then I sure  \n&gt; hope that a cache would know that too (Squid doesn&#39;t *appear* to  \n&gt; treat these identically, but I haven&#39;t dug through all the code  \n&gt; yet).  To say nothing of the fact that, at the end of the day, I  \n&gt; hope the clients are actually getting such URIs from previous  \n&gt; responses, instead of understanding the syntax.  Request parameters  \n&gt; make client side assumptions like that *awfully* tempting.  I&#39;d  \n&gt; generally prefer something like this instead:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://localhost/myresource/bar/mysubresource/bop\n&gt;\n&gt; or even\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://localhost/foos/bar/bazzes/bop\n\nOf course, that is an option. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t see why one form is  \nbetter than the other for machine clients, and certainly caching is  \nnot the reason.\n\nSubbu\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n"}}
