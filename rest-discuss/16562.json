Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Being RESTful only matters when it&#39;s appropriate to the system, I&#39;m not\n&gt; a purist.\n&gt;\nReally?  They how come it seems like just about every response on this\nand related threads comes back with something to the effect of IANA\nregistration is the *only* way to go if you want to be RESTful?\n\n&gt; If REST is the goal, then all its constraints always matter.\n&gt; If REST on the Web is the goal, then self-descriptiveness requires\n&gt; using the IANA registry to point an identifier at a standard, by\n&gt; definition.\n&gt;\n\nAs someone who responded to a previous point that I&#39;m just arguing over\nsemantics [2], I&#39;m utterly befuddled that you&#39;ve missed the semantics of\nyour own statement. You&#39;re saying two different things.\n\nThat constraints &quot;matter&quot; DOES NOT imply any requirement.  It just\nmeans, well, that they matter.  As someone who has worked for years on\ndeveloping standards at the IETF, W3C, and OASIS, this semantic\nconfusion isn&#39;t even a close call, and the semantics do matter.\n\nHere&#39;s what&#39;s really frustrates me.  I joined this mailing list to\ndiscuss the gaps, the corner cases, the gray areas, the possible areas\nof confusion.  I&#39;m here to have my assumptions challenged.  Instead, I&#39;m\nseeing a large flurry of responses that ignore subtlety, deny different\nways of thinking about the web, and deny the existence of gray areas. \nFor the majority of the traffic, I&#39;m not seeing my assumptions\nchallenged, I&#39;m seeing reality challenged, and that isn&#39;t nearly as\ninteresting.\n\nOn top of that, specifications get it wrong.  Maybe the RFCs are wrong? \nA few years back, I saw someone point out an error in the HTTP\nspecification, almost six years after it was published.  Maybe Roy is\nwrong?  Maybe the W3C is wrong with some of its TAG findings?  How do we\nknow, except to challenge assumptions, and follow those discussions to\ntheir conclusions?  Instead, you seem determined to shut off debate.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; That is not &quot;my&quot; interpretation, and there is no room for &quot;alternate&quot;\n&gt; interpretations, where the Web is concerned.\n&gt;\n\nWell, er, except, there is.  That&#39;s the beauty of the chaos that is the\nweb.  There are about two billion people [1] connected to it, and all of\nthem are entitled to their own interpretations.  If they see a better\nway, let&#39;s welcome them, and learn from them.\n\n&gt; A case may be made (what\n&gt; does &quot;discouraged&quot; mean) for alternate interpretations in other\n&gt; contexts, i.e. intranets or new protocols that aren&#39;t HTTP, but _not_\n&gt; for HTTP over the Internet, i.e. the Web.\n&gt;\n\nAs someone who follows issues surrounding computer security closely, the\ndistinction between intranet/internet is a convenient short-hand, but\ndoesn&#39;t actually exist in practice.  Many &quot;closed&quot; systems send their\ntraffic over the internet, sometimes via VPN, sometimes not, sometimes\nover HTTP, and sometimes not.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Which is why I haven&#39;t allowed all these attempts to identify such\n&gt; exceptions in other contexts, sway me one bit from my assertion that on\n&gt; the Web, REST requires you to use IANA-registered identifiers pointing\n&gt; to approved standards.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m only interested in helping folks with REST development for the\n&gt; &quot;common case of the Web&quot;,\n&gt;\n\nOK. if you&#39;re only interested in that, then why don&#39;t you let the rest\nof us who are interested in other scenarios, actually talk about those\nother scenarios, without barging in and telling us that what we&#39;re doing\nis wrong for a different use-case that you&#39;re interested in?  I&#39;m\nspecifically not interested in your use case, so I&#39;ve actually come to\nconclude that your responses are mostly worth ignoring.  Repeating them\nover and over with respect to your scenario won&#39;t change my mind,\nwhereas addressing my scenarios might.\n\n&gt; and in that context, my advice on this matter\n&gt; is not an opinion,\n&gt;\nReally?  Advice implies opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt; and there&#39;s no rational reason for it to have led to\n&gt; months of nonstop debate based on Google being the same thing as a\n&gt; registry, etc. in an effort to get me to admit that this is not a black-\n&gt; and-white truism.\n&gt;\n\nAgreed - you don&#39;t have to admit to anything.  If you disagree with what\nwe&#39;re saying as it applies to your particular use case, you don&#39;t need\nto keep repeating yourself.  Can you instead ask yourself whether or not\nthe question at hand applies to your use-case, or to a different use\ncase?  Or, if the question posed is unclear on the use-case, ask to\nclarify that, rather than assuming it is your target?  As near as I can\ntell, many people on this list have been trying, nicely, to say that we\nmight mostly agree with your position with respect to your scenario, but\nthat for some of us, our scenarios are not yours.\n\nIf the question on the table applies to a different use case, can you\nplease discuss from that alternate perspective, or simply hold your peace?\n\n-Eric.\n\n[1] http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm\n[2] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/16372\n\n\r\n--------------030805010101030400070902\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;\n      http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body text=&quot;#000000&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;\n    Hi Eric,&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    On 09/10/2010 07:58 AM, Eric J.

Advice implies opinion.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:20100910085819.5c740f20.eric@...&quot;\n      type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=&quot;position: relative;&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-msg&quot;

If you disagree with\n    what we&#39;re saying as it applies to your particular use case, you\n    don&#39;t need to keep repeating yourself.&nbsp; Can you instead ask yourself\n    whether or not the question at hand applies to your use-case, or to\n    a different use case?&nbsp; Or, if the question posed is unclear on the\n    use-case, ask to clarify that, rather than assuming it is your\n    target?&nbsp; As near as I can tell, many people on this list have been\n    trying, nicely, to say that we might mostly agree with your position\n    with respect to your scenario, but that for some of us, our\n    scenarios are not yours.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    If the question on the table applies to a different use case, can\n    you please discuss from that alternate perspective, or simply hold\n    your peace?&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    -Eric.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    [1] &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot;
