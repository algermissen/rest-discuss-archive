Peter Furniss once told me that\nany application-level agreement requires 2 phases, that is, 2PC in\nsome form or other.  You just don&#39;t get Isolation over HTTP, and you\nshouldn&#39;t hold locks over a long-running process dependent on a\nresponse from an unreliable partner.\n\nSo a 2PC client-server interaction might have classical ACID database\ntransactions on the server for each request, but the full client\nexperience would have 2 phases at a higher level.\n\n"}}
