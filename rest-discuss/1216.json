Costello&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am just ramping up on REST.  Please forgive me if my\n&gt; &gt; questions/comments are naive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Roger, detailed discussion should be redirected to the rest-discuss list\n&gt; because people on xml-dev are tired of the repitition that arises from\n&gt; teaching REST to new people as they become interested in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Now consider the case where web sites serve up XML not HTML (I shall\n&gt; &gt; refer to this as XML-REST).  Suppose that the XML is programmatically\n&gt; &gt; processed.  The HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc) provide a nice set of\n&gt; &gt; **access methods** for getting and putting the XML data.  Thus,\n&gt; &gt; **accessibility** is scalable as it is on the order of linear.  However,\n&gt; &gt; **processing** the XML data still needs customized code (just like\n&gt; &gt; machine processing of HTML requires custom code).  I therefore conclude\n&gt; &gt; that XML-REST is no more scalable than SOAP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, this is an important insight. But the linear factor is also\n&gt; important. I believe that it is much easier to standardize XML\n&gt; vocabularies within and between industries than it is to share APIs or\n&gt; messaging interfaces or whatever you want to call them. HTML is merely\n&gt; an extreme example of this. The widespread success of RSS is a second\n&gt; example. (might be interesting to try to understand why RSS is so much\n&gt; more popular on the &quot;public Internet&quot; than is XMLNews...) Obviously\n&gt; &quot;chemical ML&quot; is going to be much less widespread than HTML but I have\n&gt; much more hope that Bayer and 3M would share &quot;chemical ML&quot; than that\n&gt; they would agree on a wire-protocol for describing chemicals. There are\n&gt; a variety of reasons but one reason is that agreeing on a wire-protocol\n&gt; is much closer to agreeing on a *business model* than is agreeing on an\n&gt; XML vocabulary.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How can we make XML-REST scalable?  One solution would be to require\n&gt; &gt; every web site to serve up the same type of XML documents, i.e., have a\n&gt; &gt; universal Schema that all XML documents conform to.  Obviously this is\n&gt; &gt; not a very attractive solution.  The other solution is to have web sites\n&gt; &gt; serve up documents whose meaning can be dynamically &quot;discovered&quot;.  I\n&gt; &gt; believe that RDF is the only XML technology that enables dynamic\n&gt; &gt; understanding of content.  Thus, the cornerstone for a scalable,\n&gt; &gt; machine-processable web services architecture is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. The HTTP access methods - GET, POST, PUT, etc\n&gt; &gt; 2. A dynamically understandable vocabulary, such as RDF.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, this is the approach Mark Baker takes. As I am not (yet?) an RDF\n&gt; &quot;believer&quot; I see it more as a spectrum: as we understand problem domains\n&gt; more and more, we migrate more and more stuff from &quot;the code&quot; into\n&gt; declarative formats that describe the data. RDF fans think that RDF is\n&gt; the declarative &quot;uber-format&quot;. We&#39;ll see. Maybe.\n&gt;\n&gt; If they are wrong, I still expect dozens of declarative languages like\n&gt; XML Query, XSLT etc. to mature into powerful tools for bootstrapping\n&gt; understanding of a vocabulary. (consider for example an XSLT associated\n&gt; with one industry standard purchase order vocabulary that translates it\n&gt; into another PO vocabulary on demand -- easy to model in an\n&gt; industry-neutral way with URIs and XML).\n&gt;\n&gt; One reason I argue against the &quot;standard web services&quot; model because it\n&gt; moves the very first bit of the problem from the domain of declarations\n&gt; into the domain of code. I.e. to even get the data you need to write\n&gt; code. That&#39;s a serious impediment to further exploration down the\n&gt; declarative path. If XML Query turns out to be extremely wonderful and\n&gt; powerful, this fork in the road should come into even greater focus.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
