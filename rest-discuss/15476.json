If Glenn&#39;s team are going to do &quot;R=\r\nEST like they \n&gt;&gt; meant it&quot; to paraphrase Guilherme, I don&#39;t think that JAX=\r\n-RS is the \n&gt;&gt; right way to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that&#39;s just an opinion. Or is ther=\r\ne some technical criticism as well?\n\nIt&#39;s an opinion - I don&#39;t have any car=\r\nefully gathered empirical evidence to back it up. However both WCF and JAX-=\r\nRS avoid hypermedia which is pretty important for RESTful solutions. In oth=\r\ner bits of that email, I pointed out that some JAX-RS compliant frameworks =\r\n(e.g. Jersey) are now experimenting with hypermedia which makes them much m=\r\nore useful if the abstractions come out right.\n\nIn terms of technical criti=\r\nque, I think JAX-RS comes out ahead of WCF because it&#39;s marginally easier t=\r\no TDD with it, and so much more of the framework is above the waterline rat=\r\nher than buried down deep. However at this point both frameworks are simply=\r\n nicer programmatic interfaces atop a Web server, and both short-change cli=\r\nent-side developers (with JAX-RS again being better than WCF).\n\nSince neith=\r\ner has hypermedia support from the start, retrofitting it at this point may=\r\n result in horrid abstractions. That&#39;s why I&#39;m broadly supportive of Glenn&#39;=\r\ns outreach and very supportive of the people behind Restfulie (as well as b=\r\neing encouraged by the steps the Jersey team are taking).\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"}}
