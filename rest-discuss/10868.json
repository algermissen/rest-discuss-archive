The applica=\r\ntion state is in the client.\n&gt; It&#39;s not the same thing as the resource stat=\r\ne on the server (which is\n&gt; how I interpreted your description). The simple=\r\nst way to think about\n&gt; it is as a web of connected resources being a state=\r\n machine. The\n&gt; client navigates the state machine by executing GETs -- the=\r\n current\n&gt; state of the application is determined by the resource represent=\r\nation\n&gt; it is currently &quot;viewing&quot; (it&#39;s actually defined by multiple resour=\r\nce\n&gt; representations at one time, such as images and scripts linked from an=\r\n\n&gt; HTML doc, but let&#39;s ignore that complexity for now). The hyperlinks in\n&gt;=\r\n the representation are the possible transitions through the state machine.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But the state machine has more to it -- the client can change the\n&gt; st=\r\nate machine as well as navigate it. A POST allows a client to add a\n&gt; state=\r\n (and usually navigate to that new state in one step). A PUT\n&gt; allows a cli=\r\nent to change a state and a DELETE lets it remove a state.\n&gt; The changes th=\r\nat a client can make at any time are also governed by\n&gt; the representation =\r\nthat it is currently viewing. This is usually done\n&gt; through forms embedded=\r\n in the representation.\n\nI didn&#39;t get such a different reading from Mike&#39;s =\r\narticle, but I think I have\na different view of the Hypermedia constraint=\r\n=C2=B9 than you do=E2=80=A6\n\nThe client doesn&#39;t only execute GETs to transi=\r\ntion between states, POSTs\ntransition between states just as well.\n\nThe cli=\r\nent doesn&#39;t *change* the state machine, per se =E2=80=A6 it merely transiti=\r\nons\nbetween the states allowed by the server, as described by the hypermedi=\r\na.\nThose transitions might end up mutating the state machine, but that&#39;s no=\r\nt the\nsame as the client mutating the state machine.\n\nLet&#39;s posit a recipe =\r\napp.  One can view recipes, and use a form to create new\nones.  The states =\r\nthen are:\n\n&lt;/&gt;  --GET-&gt; &lt;/recipe/1/&gt;\n    `--GET-&gt; &lt;/recipe/2/&gt;\n    `-POST-&gt;=\r\n &lt;/recipe/&gt; -201-&gt; &lt;/recipe/3&gt;\n\nPOSTing (and this is POST-as-process, which=\r\n is most of the web is, really)\nthe form to /recipe/ doesn&#39;t itself create =\r\n/recipe/3/, instead the server\ncreates a new state in the machine, and tran=\r\nsitions the client to it (via the\nLocation header).\n\nEven in the POST-as-ap=\r\npend case (and for PUT and DELETE), the server is still\ninvolved.  If the o=\r\nriginal form says to the client, &quot;go ahead and PUT\n&lt;/recipe/3/&gt;&quot; (which doe=\r\nsn&#39;t already exist, the PUT would create it), one\ncould consider the PUT no=\r\nt as transitioning to the new state that it created,\nbut instead transition=\r\ning to a now-enabled state that the server advertised.\nThe state /recipe/3/=\r\n exists in the state machine, whether the PUT &quot;creates&quot;\n(&quot;enables&quot;) it or n=\r\not.\n\n&lt;/&gt; -PUT-&gt; &lt;/recipe/3/&gt; -201-&gt; &lt;/recipe/3/&gt;\n\n\n=C2=B9: I think &quot;HATEOAS=\r\n&quot; is a bad name.  &quot;Hypermedia constraint&quot; is more\ndescriptive, and less &quot;HA=\r\nTE&quot;-filled. :)\n\n-- \n...jsled\nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - a=3Djsled; b=3Dasyn=\r\nchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}\n\r\n--=-=-=\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--=-=-=--\r\n\n"}}
