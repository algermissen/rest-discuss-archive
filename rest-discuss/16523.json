Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Yes, because I don&#39;t understand how we can debate the merits of using\n&gt; unregistered identifiers vis-a-vis self-descriptive messaging, when the\n&gt; majority is still insisting that unregistered identifiers are self-\n&gt; descriptive.  I&#39;m not trying to piss you off; just trying to understand\n&gt; your position, specifically:\n\nMy position specifically, is as follows:\n  - Use of non IANA-registered media types on the Web is discouraged\n  - One should (re-)use existing registered media types wherever possible\n  - Creating a new media-type should only be considered when the \nmedia-type is required for a new protocol (and where existing media \ntypes cannot be used) or where the new media-type brings benefits at a \nweb scale not found in another existing registered media-type (such as \nwhen application/exi was introduced for Efficient XML Interchange)\n  - The precise wording around &quot;discouraged&quot; in the HTTP spec is to \nallow new media-types to be tested and used &quot;in the wild&quot; whilst \nconveying that you should re-use existing media types where-ever possible.\n\nMore generally, my preference goes to augmenting existing media types by \nextension, such @data- attributes in HTML, or HTML+RDFa (which keeps the \ntext/html media type).\n\nUnderlying my position is some (perhaps false) reasoning on REST to \nbring my understanding in-line with modern / future web architecture and \nparadigm shifts on the web.\n\nFor instance, where at the time of writing the norm was to have server \nside applications and a &#39;web of documents&#39; then things like multiple \nbrowser contexts were considered (I believe) unrestful - an example of \nthis would be the iframe in a document, because the user agent could not \ncontrol or reassemble it&#39;s own application state, bringing this forward \nto more resent (web 2.0) times the same could be said for XMLHttpRequest \n- however with the advent of advanced user agent implemented APIs \nincluding client side storage it&#39;s become possible to have 100% client \nside applications where the user agent is both an IO layer (http as the \ninterface) and a presentation layer (browser context), and where the \napplication state to be considered is that of the client side \napplication, which is now outside of HTTP and thus REST. Interestingly \nthis positions the web in a data-tier position where data is the \nresources named by URIs which each have a current state, that state is \nrepresented within and transferred via HTTP messages, likewise the state \nof a resource is manipulated with HTTP messages and usage of the HTTP verbs.\n\nBack to the point in hand, this also encourages a more modular approach \nto application coding where, each specific module only needs to \nunderstand part of a message. An analogy may be a user agent processing \na single HTML document, where different parts of said HTML document are \nprocessed and understood by very different modules doing different \ntasks, one may hook in to understand &lt;script&gt;s of a certain type, \nanother may hook in to dereference embedded links, another to \ninstantiate DOM event listeners and so forth. Thus re-using, augmenting \nand extending existing media types (like HTML) makes perfect sense to me \nfrom all angles, including REST and it&#39;s constraints.\n\nThe rest of your reply is important, but with my beliefs as stated, I \ncan&#39;t really debate them with you.\n\nThe only thing I can add that may be of some use, is that I personally \ninvariably think of REST within the context of the current deployed \n(HTTP-based) web and thus everything I say about it is in this context; \nwhereas perhaps some of the replies you have received are REST specific \nleaving out the web context, and thus stand true, if perhaps a little \nirrelevant for the majority of common uses.\n\n&gt;&gt; This issue is orthogonal to the &quot;making up a new media type for every \n&gt;&gt; resource encountered&quot; discussion, that&#39;s a best practise thing I hope\n&gt;&gt; we could discuss.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If we assume that opaque identifiers are somehow self-descriptive, then\n&gt; there&#39;s room to have this debate.  I don&#39;t understand how they can be,\n&gt; so I can&#39;t see the issue as orthogonal, rather than central.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Eric, FACT is that using IANA registered media types on the web is a \n&gt;&gt; SHOULD, using a non registered type is &quot;discouraged&quot; - do we really\n&gt;&gt; need to take this to the TAG and to the IETF http working group and\n&gt;&gt; waste there time with something which is widely understood.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The WebArch document states that we SHOULD send identifiers, but says\n&gt; nothing about whether such identifiers need to be registered.  HTTP\n&gt; says not using IANA is &quot;discouraged&quot; which I think is quite clear;\n&gt; however, judging from the pushback, I disagree that it&#39;s &quot;widely\n&gt; understood&quot; to mean what it says.\n\nAFAICT it (awww) points (heavily) to the (re-)use of Internet Media \nTypes, as in RFC2046, as in IANA registered - I won&#39;t debate this but \nquite sure that if push came to shove both the HTTPbis working group and \nthe TAG would confirm this to be &#39;best-practise&#39; and that it should be \nwidely understood.\n\n&gt;&gt; This issue is orthogonal to the &quot;making up a new media type for every \n&gt;&gt; resource encountered&quot; discussion, that&#39;s a best practise thing I hope\n&gt;&gt; we could discuss.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s exactly the discussion I&#39;ve been trying to have all year.  But\n&gt; we keep coming back to the assumption that application/foo+xml is just\n&gt; as self-descriptive as application/xhtml+xml, on the Web.  I&#39;m not\n&gt; actually _trying_ to get folks upset with me, I just don&#39;t understand\n&gt; how this is seen as an orthogonal concern?\n\nPerhaps it&#39;s not orthogonal, yet an investigation in to the +/- of \ncreating new media types vs re-using existing ones may bring the \ncommunity to a unified understanding and consensus - hopefully aligning \nwith the HTTP spec and web arch pointers.\n\nRegards,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
