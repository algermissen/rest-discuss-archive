And an RDF is not a\n&gt; representation of a resource, but an informational resource about a\n&gt; resource, with its own Uri.\n&gt;\n\nReally?  An RDF document can&#39;t be a representation of a resource?  I\ndon&#39;t see where httpRange-14 or anything else makes such an assertion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence why the Link: header is being\n&gt; reintroduced, with the fallacious argument that it was in the\n&gt; previous http spec and lack of time was the reason for it not being\n&gt; included in 2616. That no one had the time to go over 2616 again and\n&gt; that 2616 doesn&#39;t complement 2068 but supersedes it seems to be\n&gt; conveniently ignored. \n&gt; \n\nFallacious?  How?  The source for this notion is the *authors* of the\nspec.  Who is in a position to call their argument fallacious,\nexactly?  Where are you people getting this notion that RFC 2616\nsupersedes RFC 2068?  I read this:\n\n&quot;This specification defines the protocol referred to as &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;, and\nis an update to RFC 2068.&quot;\n\nHow does an update to a spec, deprecate anything in that spec, unless\nit specifically says &quot;this is deprecated&quot;?  Is there some IETF rule\nwhich says updates to earlier versions of a spec, deprecate anything\nnot carried through to the new version?  I would agree that the Link\nheader wasn&#39;t part of HTTP, if RFC 2616 said that, but it doesn&#39;t:\n\n&quot;The Alternates, Content-Version, Derived-From, Link, URI, Public and\nContent-Base header fields were defined in previous versions of this\nspecification, but not commonly implemented.&quot;\n\nThat says nothing about deprecation or obsolescence.  In fact, it\nexplicitly states that Link was defined in RFC 2068, which taken in the\ncontext of &quot;[this] is an update to RFC 2068&quot; means that there&#39;s nothing\nfallacious whatsoever about the assertion that Link is part of HTTP.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Link in HTML and the XHTML families are still there for that, as well\n&gt; as in ATOM feeds.\n&gt; \n\nOK, but let&#39;s say you have a collection of images, managed with Atom\nProtocol.  Each image has an associated metadata document.  Yeah, you\ncan associate the image with the metadata in the Atom markup, but what\nabout associating the metadata with the image?  Also, how does one link\na raw text file to another document without a Link header?  That&#39;s why\nthe debate is about *uniform* access to metadata, the whole idea is\nto _not_ restrict linking to metadata, to only a select few media types.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So it&#39;s fine to do your conneg on different mimetypes for your\n&gt; resources, *provided* they are different representations of a same\n&gt; resource.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t see that as a requirement of HTTP or REST, or of any pragmatic\nconcern.  Please refer to Roy&#39;s post [1], there is a difference between\nredirected conneg and true conneg.  Whether we&#39;re talking about\nmultiple languages or multiple anything else, a negotiated redirect\nmakes no assertion that the target is part of the set of\nrepresentations for the requested resource.  Quoting REST:\n\n&quot;Depending on the message control data, a given representation may\nindicate the current state of the requested resource, the desired state\nfor the requested resource, or the value of some other resource, such\nas... a representation of some error condition for a response.&quot;\n\nIf we can define a resource as &quot;404 response page&quot; we can serve a\nrepresentation of it anywhere we need to.  In which case, the request\nfor a nonexistent resource returns a representation of some other\nresource, i.e. &quot;404 response page&quot;.  The 404 response message body\nisn&#39;t a representation of the requested resource, but the 404 response\nitself is.\n\nSimilarly, if we request &#39;application/rdf+xml&#39; from a URI which has no\nRDF representation, but is described by an RDF document at some other\nURI, then we can return a 303 representation which indicates the value\nof some other resource -- in this case, its URI.  To my way of\nthinking, it&#39;s better to respond &quot;maybe&quot; (303) rather than &quot;no&quot; (412)\nin such a scenario, if possible.\n\nThe target RDF document is not a representation of the requested\nresource, the 303 redirect is.  The same applies if the target is a CSS\ndocument -- the CSS isn&#39;t a representation of the requested resource,\nthe 303 response is.  303 and 404 representations of a requested URI\nindicate the value of _some other resource_.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Css and Rdf *are not* different representations of a same resource\n&gt; and should *never* share the same url. Use Link: header, and the\n&gt; capabilities of your representation (html and xhtml, atom and others)\n&gt; to link to other documents.\n&gt; \n\nIf the server is issuing a 303 redirect to an RDF document, or even a\nCSS document, then those documents *are not* &quot;sharing the same URL&quot;.\nThe only documents in the set of variant representations sharing an URL\nare those which respond 200 OK.  I agree with you, a CSS document and\nan RDF document can never be representations of the same resource, so\nthey shouldn&#39;t share a URI using true conneg and 200 OK responses.\n\nBut I see no pragmatic, or even theoretical, reason not to use conneg to\n303 redirect to an RDF document.  Yeah, this means you could also use\nconneg and 303 redirects to serve CSS documents.  So?\n\n-Eric\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5857\n\n"}}
