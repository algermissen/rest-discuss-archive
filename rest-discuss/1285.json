This content is potentially served by a set of web servers\nrunning behind a HTTP load balancer.\n\nFor a single server scenario, this seems pretty straightforward, At\nthe client cache I track expected size [from the content-length\nheader], Etag and last-modified. for subsequent requests I populate a\nIf-None-Match header from the etag, a Range & Range-If header if the\nexpected size is not the same as the cached file size, and i send a\nIf-Modified-Since header if i don&#39;t have a Range header [my reading of\nthe use of Range & Range-If lead me to believe to not use\nIf-Modified-Since if i&#39;m using ranges].\n\nMy concern is when i have 2 or more web servers, all running behind a\nload balancer [local director etc], that each server will be assigning\ndifferent etags to the same content (i don&#39;t see anything in the spec\nthat lets me assume different server instances will generate the same\netag for the same content, even for the same versions of HTTP server\nsoftware). This is leading me to think about not using etags, and to\njust use the modified date, but then it doesn&#39;t look like you can do\nranges with modified dates. Its also crossed my mind to use\ncontent-md5, but this doesn&#39;t seem very widely support [if at all].\n\nAny suggestions ?\n\nThanks\nSimon\n\nSaturday, May 18, 2002, 1:50:51 PM, you wrote:\n\n&gt; I think it would be great if you asked the questions here.

I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; looking at using the HTTP/1.1 caching support (Etag, If-Modified-\n&gt;&gt; Since, If-None-Match and If-Range). I have some questions about how\n&gt;&gt; this works when deployed on a cluster of servers with a load\n&gt;&gt; balancer, is this a good place to ask, or can someone recommend a\n&gt;&gt; good list to discuss HTTP caching.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tx\n&gt;&gt; Simon\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
