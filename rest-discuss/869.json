As\n&gt; I point out in the write-up,UNIX has a long and profitable history of using\n&gt; synthetic filenames constructed according to particular, explicitly\n&gt; documented conventions to do just that, i.e. automate certain things.\n\nYou also point out in the article that it doesn&#39;t always work. I&#39;ve\nadded a comment to expand on that to the Wiki.\n\n&gt; Consider construction of names for things in /dev;  consider the fact that\n&gt; ps on many modern UNIXes is a shell script that operates by constructing\n&gt; names and accessing files according to a particular set of conventions on\n&gt; /proc.  What&#39;s more, opacity by itself doesn&#39;t guarantee automation any\n&gt; more than non-opacity breaks it.\n\nA shell script does something like: print /proc/$pid/status\n\nA web script (e.g. XSLT) would do something like &quot;print\ntraverse($pid/status)&quot; The difference is that in the former status is a\nfile name. In the latter it is an element type name. When we have an RDF\nequivalent to shell scripts and xpaths it will be similarly clear using\nRDF.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; This isn&#39;t true, either --- unless you assume that the grammars and\n&gt; semantics of these names aren&#39;t made explicit.  The whole process can be\n&gt; fully automated by providing a generative grammar for names and some\n&gt; semantic description for said names.  \n\nWhy invent something extra when markup works?!?!\n\n&gt; ... Granted that you want to make\n&gt; everything as explicit as possible.  But our focus on using markup to\n&gt; encode all of this stuff is somewhat historical and cultural.  Upon further\n&gt; reflection and investigation, it&#39;s not at all clear that this is preferable\n&gt; to using generative grammars for construction of names in semantically-rich\n&gt; namespaces.\n\nYes it is. The virtue of markup is that it embeds hyperlinks that can go\n*anywhere on the web*. Hierarchical names are necessarily hosted from\nthe same machine (or at least there must be a redirect on the same\nmachine). That&#39;s why the web is different than a file system. (I added\nthis point to the Wiki also)\n\n&gt; &gt; Best to keep the URI opaque, and build the meaning up on the Semantic\n&gt; &gt; Web.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s the dogma.  But looking at the relative complexity of, say, the\n&gt; implementation of the PS shell script on a UNIX box with /proc and the\n&gt; implementation of  something to grok Semantic Web stuff has me wondering.\n&gt; Perhaps giant stringy webs of RDF aren&#39;t the easiest, most useful, or best\n&gt; ways to get to some of the same functionality.\n\nI think you&#39;re reverting to something you&#39;re comfortable with. If you\nuse XPath or an RDF query language you can get the same benefits without\nthe inflexibility of centralization.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
