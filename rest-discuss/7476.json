I take a\n: fairly simple approach in my conversation. If the urls are different we\n: are talking about two different resources. It might happen that they\n: demarcate the same application state, but client&#39;s can&#39;t know that. I\n: would suggest that even server&#39;s don&#39;t really know that. A mapping from\n: URL to representation might be here today but gone after the restructure\n: tomorrow. One of the aliases might become a redirection next week.\n: Severs cannot say with certainty over the long-haul that multiple urls\n: map to the same application state. In that context I am very wary of\n: language that talks about two resources being the &quot;same&quot;, even if the\n: might happen to be equivalent for the forseeable future.\n\nProblem is, without that &quot;Sameness&quot;, there is no notion of identity\nat all, and no resource.  Everything is itself and perhaps something and\neverything else from time to time.*  Who can live in a universe like\nthat?  You can&#39;t convict a murderer, because it was never him; it was\nsomeone else who happened to &quot;demarcate the same state&quot;...\non that particular day.\n\n* Made me think of &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; :-)\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
