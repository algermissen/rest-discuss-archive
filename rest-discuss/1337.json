A woman in the audience made an\nexcellent point:\n\n&quot;In order to counteract all the hype around SOAP, you need to point out\nnot only the differences in REST versus SOAP for today&#39;s Web services,\nbut also the differences in enabling capability in tomorrow&#39;s\nenvironment [e.g., semantic Web].  It would be an easy step from your\nREST examples to RDF and ontology enabling, whereas with SOAP I&#39;m not\nsure what would happen - like with firewalls, how could an inferencer do\nit&#39;s thing if the data is all buried inside?&quot;\n\nShe noted that DAML-S is REST-ful.  This week I will talk to her more\nabout this.\n\n/Roger\n\nP.S. I have added a lot more material to my REST tutorial (including the\nabove comments).  As always, feedback is much appreciate.\n\n\n"}}
