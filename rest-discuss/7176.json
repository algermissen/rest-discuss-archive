I implemented software for an international scale seismic data\ndistribution network.  The only thing that resembled that sort of\n&quot;choreography&quot; was the discovery process for new hubs/stations (data\nsinks and sources); all data included an http URI up front which\nidentified the source.  A GET on that would return an RDF/XML document\ndescribing the capabilities of the service, the available data\nchannels, and the data collection services and what data they\naccepted, etc.. (using RDF Forms)  Then the discoverer could GET the\ndata it wanted, submit its own data for processing, and submit (POST)\nits own document describing its capabilities and/or those of other\nservices it had previously discovered.\n\nMark.\n\nOn 12/2/06, Bob Haugen &lt;bob.haugen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; By C2C I mean computer-to-computer, no humans in the loop.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve discussed it here, but I haven&#39;t heard anybody claim an\n&gt; implementation of much more than receiving a purchase order.\n&gt;\n&gt; A goods order processing procedure might go something like:\n&gt; 1. Buyer: propose offer to buy (e.g. a purchase order)\n&gt; 2. Seller: checks availability\n&gt; 3. Seller: reserves credit\n&gt; 4. Seller: accepts offer (e.g. Amazon&#39;s order confirmation)\n&gt; 5. Seller: ships goods\n&gt; 6. Seller: draws down payment\n&gt; 7. Buyer: receives goods\n&gt; 8: Buyer: confirms receipt\n&gt;\n&gt; I know, that will seem like a stateful conversation which goes against\n&gt; all REST principles, but Paul Prescod and others have sketched out how\n&gt; to do it without violating those principles.\n&gt;\n&gt; Been done to some extent using EDI and ebXML, but those\n&gt; implementations usually cover propose-accept or ship-receive\n&gt; separately, not wholistically (e.g. all 8 steps above).  both of those\n&gt; use messages to endpoints which are not resources in any RESTian\n&gt; sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; WS-BPEL uses half of processes like that as examples, and\n&gt; WS-Choreography uses the whole of processes like that as examples, but\n&gt; I don&#39;t know anybody who has implemented any of those example\n&gt; processes in real life.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
