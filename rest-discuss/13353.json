So far the governance policies seem pretty\n&gt; liberal to me (sin=\r\nce I wrote it).  RHT as a permanent member of the board\n&gt; seems reasonable =\r\nto me considering we started it and will be doing most of\n&gt; the work initia=\r\nlly. *Then again, if its a show stopper it will be removed.\n&gt; *\n\n\nMark Litt=\r\nle (CTO at JBoss, Inc.) chimed\nin&lt;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltac=\r\nloud-devel/2009-September/000142.html&gt;the\nnext morning saying Bill was on v=\r\nacation and making it quite clear\nthat\nno such changes would be necessary:\n=\r\n\nBill&#39;s on vacation this week so he may have a different perspective, but I=\r\n\n&gt; don&#39;t have a problem with the statement as it&#39;s made, i.e., Red Hat havi=\r\nng a\n&gt; permanent position on the board. I&#39;ve been involved with standards f=\r\nor 20+\n&gt; years through OMG, OASIS, W3C, WS-I, GGF, JCP and others. What&#39;s p=\r\nroposed in\n&gt; the whole effort around REST-* is far less Evil Empire and far=\r\n more Benign\n&gt; Coordinator. *If we have problems with the approach in the f=\r\nuture of\n&gt; course we can re-examine it, but at this stage I think it&#39;s fine=\r\n.*\n\n\nThat&#39;s all well and good to say but once Red Hat are burnt into the wo=\r\nodwork\nit can be very difficult (if not impossible) to remove them. What\nju=\r\nstification is there for them enjoying a privileged position over their\ncom=\r\npetitors, and the creator himself for that matter? Bill sees this as\ntheir =\r\nreward for &quot;start[ing] it and [...] doing most of the work initially&quot;\nbut w=\r\nhy not just self-appoint for the interim and then let the community\nvote yo=\r\nu in based on your contributions?\n\nProcedural issues aside I think it&#39;s saf=\r\ne to say that REST-* does not (and\nwill not) enjoy the support of the great=\r\ner community so they should &quot;just\nclose the stupid site down&quot;. There are pl=\r\nenty of safe and effective ways we\ncan promote REST without resorting to go=\r\ning down the WS-* path by creating\nstructures that unfairly reward some par=\r\nticipants at the cost of others. Mark\nBaker&#39;s wiki &lt;http://rest.blueoxen.ne=\r\nt/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage&gt; could do\nwith a shot in the arm in terms of sp=\r\need, branding, etc. (things the REST\nPatterns wiki &lt;http://restpatterns.org=\r\n/&gt; appears to have under control) but\nthese are things we can easily fix (a=\r\nnd should imo). Where we need more\nrigorous standardisation we can use exis=\r\nting process like IETF\nInternet-Drafts (as has been done before for e.g.\nPO=\r\nE&lt;http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-http-poe-00.txt&gt;\n).\n\nAs a poi=\r\nnt of reference, Red Hat are doing similar things in the cloud space\nwith t=\r\nhe recent launch of\nDeltacloud&lt;http://press.redhat.com/2009/09/03/introduci=\r\nng-deltacloud/&gt;.\nA quick look at the libcloud-list\narchives&lt;https://www.red=\r\nhat.com/archives/libcloud-list/2009-July/thread.html&gt;shows\na swarm of @\nred=\r\nhat.com names working together and either completely\nignoring&lt;https://www.r=\r\nedhat.com/archives/libcloud-list/2009-July/msg00028.html&gt;or\ndismissing&lt;http=\r\ns://www.redhat.com/archives/libcloud-list/2009-August/msg00003.html&gt;\ninvita=\r\ntions\nfor external collaboration. That&#39;s not to say that [L]GPL contributio=\r\nns of\nspecs and code aren&#39;t a good thing however they come to be, but nothi=\r\nng I&#39;ve\nseen so far suggests that Red Hat are genuinely interested in worki=\r\nng with\nthe community at large.

Yes, s=\r\nure, that&#39;s not what middleware means\n&gt; for the anal retentive, but I suspe=\r\nct that&#39;s what it means to Red Hat\n&gt; et and enterprise developers throughou=\r\nt the world, a rather large\n&gt; group of people. And I was being a bit tounge=\r\n-in-cheek assessing\n&gt; structures (resources, hierarchies, categories, tags,=\r\n whatever) to\n&gt; *simulate* OO more than anything, and certainly wasn&#39;t sayi=\r\nng\n&gt; middleware=3DOO. Sheesh.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; People whinge a lot that Red H=\r\nat has too much of a bias. Um, computer\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scientists have a bias too, ev=\r\nen people who have no bias have a basic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophical bias, and these =\r\nsemantics *will* affect (as oppose to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mere observatory notions) the wo=\r\nrk that is done. The argument of bias\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is mostly moot (but not complete=\r\nly, of course). I personally get the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feeling that these REST-* moves w=\r\nere genuinly of good nature, the only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; business bias that I can see is =\r\nthat they jumped on an idea and went\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with it. That&#39;s more happening in=\r\n the REST world in a long time, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as such I *really* welcome it.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Would you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked to see a\n&gt; &gt; n=\r\new Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Woul=\r\nd you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a\n&gt; &gt; filet-o-fish =\r\nsandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; WTF is wrong with yo=\r\nu people?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re jumping your gun and seeing opposition and wei=\r\nrd shit\n&gt; where there isn&#39;t any, well, not in my camp, anyway. Let&#39;s change=\r\n the\n&gt; allegory to fit better with my point; Would you welcome it if you we=\r\nnt\n&gt; shopping and realized you had bought the wrong kind of salami?\n&gt;\n&gt; Eh,=\r\n screw the allegories. All I was saying is that even if they are\n&gt; misguide=\r\nd, kicking them in the shin is no good way to convince them\n&gt; otherwise. Al=\r\nl you&#39;re doing is creating enemies, and as much as we all\n&gt; have our bucket=\r\ns of patience with people grasping what REST is all\n&gt; about filled up prett=\r\ny high, don&#39;t let it overflow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why don&#39;t you trademark REST and just be=\r\n done with it? Should be easy\n&gt; to suss out any disputes if you really want=\r\ned to then? You know, just\n&gt; for laughs? Linus did it, and so can you ...\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhemselves up as the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards\n&gt; &gt; organ=\r\nization on a topic for which they not only had NOTHING to\n&gt; &gt; do with creat=\r\ning and know NOTHING about, but for which they\n&gt; &gt; actually sell products t=\r\nhat are the exact opposite of RESTful\n&gt; &gt; architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, I think m=\r\nost people here is in agreement with that. It was a\n&gt; stupid move, especial=\r\nly without some anchoring with hardcore REST\n&gt; people or organisations. Or,=\r\n you know, you.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The organization claims that it will specify REST\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n standards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dictators\n&gt; &gt; in =\r\nthe form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals would be\n&gt; &gt; allowed =\r\n(IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL),\n&gt; &gt; and that Red =\r\nHat would be the only permanent member of the board\n&gt; &gt; to ensure that neve=\r\nr changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill has said they&#39;re open to change it, and no matter how e=\r\nvil you\n&gt; think RH is, anything has to start somewhere. Why not just see it=\r\n as a\n&gt; honest starting point? The truth will be flushed out *extremely* qu=\r\nick\n&gt; if we all jumped on it and made it truly RESTful, no? (Assuming fixin=\r\ng\n&gt; the governing model, of course, which Bill says they are happy to do.\n&gt;=\r\n I don&#39;t know these people, and can only take them at face value)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And=\r\n, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Leads\n&gt; &gt; owning=\r\n the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because\n&gt; &gt; they know dam=\r\nn well that their current market is shrinking: their\n&gt; &gt; entire product arc=\r\nhitecture is based on J2EE, the giant black\n&gt; &gt; hole of Java that is suckin=\r\ng itself into oblivion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t a lot of innovation happen this way, th=\r\nough? (And I&#39;m not\n&gt; stating their two specs are innovative; they&#39;re not)\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; But, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that\n&gt; &gt; is f=\r\nound in my dissertation.

All he is doing is makin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; people like you confused over what is REST and what is not, in\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne hope of making a business out of clambering onto yet\n&gt; &gt; another buzzword=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; People like me confused about REST?

I&#39;ve been involved with standards=\r\n for 20+ years through OMG, OASIS, W3C, WS-I, GGF, JCP and others. What&#39=\r\n;s proposed in the whole effort around REST-* is far less Evil Empire and f=\r\nar more Benign Coordinator. &lt;b&gt;If we have problems with the approach in the=\r\n future of course we can re-examine it, but at this stage I think it&#39;s =\r\nfine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&#39;s all well and g=\r\nood to say but once Red Hat are burnt into the woodwork it can be very diff=\r\nicult (if not impossible) to remove them. What justification is there for t=\r\nhem enjoying a privileged position over their competitors, and the creator =\r\nhimself for that matter? Bill sees this as their reward for &quot;start[ing=\r\n] it and [...] doing most of the work initially&quot; but why not just self=\r\n-appoint for the interim and then let the community vote you in based on yo=\r\nur contributions?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Procedural issues aside I thin=\r\nk it&#39;s safe to say that REST-* does not (and will not) enjoy the suppor=\r\nt of the greater community so they should &quot;j&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;border-collapse:collapse;color:rgb(51, 51=\r\n, 51)&quot;&gt;ust close the stupid site down&quot;. There are plenty of safe and e=\r\nffective ways we can promote REST without resorting to going down the WS-* =\r\npath by creating structures that unfairly reward some participants at the c=\r\nost of others.=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontP=\r\nage&quot;&gt;Mark Baker&#39;s wiki&lt;/a&gt; could do with a shot in the arm in terms of =\r\nspeed, branding, etc. (things the=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://restpatterns.org/&quot;&gt;RE=\r\nST Patterns wiki&lt;/a&gt;=A0appears to have under control) but these are things =\r\nwe can easily fix (and should imo). Where we need more rigorous standardisa=\r\ntion we can use existing process like IETF Internet-Drafts (as has been don=\r\ne before for e.g. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-ht=\r\ntp-poe-00.txt&quot;&gt;POE&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n color=3D&quot;#333333&quot; face=3D&quot;arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-sp=\r\nan&quot; style=3D&quot;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font=\r\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=3D&quot;#333333&quot; face=3D&quot;arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;As a po=\r\nint of reference, Red Hat are doing similar things in the cloud space with =\r\nthe &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://press.redhat.com/2009/09/03/introducing-deltacloud/&quot;&gt;=\r\nrecent launch of Deltacloud&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, sure, that&#39;s not what middleware means&lt;br&gt;\nfor the a=\r\nnal retentive, but I suspect that&#39;s what it means to Red Hat&lt;br&gt;\net and=\r\n enterprise developers throughout the world, a rather large&lt;br&gt;\ngroup of pe=\r\nople. And I was being a bit tounge-in-cheek assessing&lt;br&gt;\nstructures (resou=\r\nrces, hierarchies, categories, tags, whatever) to&lt;br&gt;\n*simulate* OO more th=\r\nan anything, and certainly wasn&#39;t saying&lt;br&gt;\nmiddleware=3DOO.

Um, computer&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scientists have a bias too, even=\r\n people who have no bias have a basic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; philosophical bias, and =\r\nthese semantics *will* affect (as oppose to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; mere observatory n=\r\notions) the work that is done. The argument of bias&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; is mostly =\r\nmoot (but not completely, of course). I personally get the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fee=\r\nling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; business bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; with it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long=\r\n time, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; as such I *really* welcome it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wo=\r\nuld you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked to see a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; new=\r\n Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Would you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; filet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; WTF is wrong with you people?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nI think you&#39;re jump=\r\ning your gun and seeing opposition and weird shit&lt;br&gt;\nwhere there isn&#39;t=\r\n any, well, not in my camp, anyway. Let&#39;s change the&lt;br&gt;\nallegory to fi=\r\nt better with my point; Would you welcome it if you went&lt;br&gt;\nshopping and r=\r\nealized you had bought the wrong kind of salami?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEh, screw the all=\r\negories. All I was saying is that even if they are&lt;br&gt;\nmisguided, kicking t=\r\nhem in the shin is no good way to convince them&lt;br&gt;\notherwise. All you&#39;=\r\nre doing is creating enemies, and as much as we all&lt;br&gt;\nhave our buckets of=\r\n patience with people grasping what REST is all&lt;br&gt;\nabout filled up pretty =\r\nhigh, don&#39;t let it overflow.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhy don&#39;t you trademark REST =\r\nand just be done with it?

Linus did it, and s=\r\no can you ...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unila=\r\nterally decided to set&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves up as the equivalent of Sun with=\r\nin a JCP-like standards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; organization on a topic for which they not=\r\n only had NOTHING to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; do with creating and know NOTHING about, but =\r\nfor which they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; actually sell products that are the exact opposite =\r\nof RESTful&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; architecture.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nYeah, I think most people =\r\nhere is in agreement with that.

Or, you kn=\r\now, you.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=A0The organization claims that it will specify =\r\nREST&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; standards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dict=\r\nators&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals wou=\r\nld be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as B=\r\nDFL),&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the b=\r\noard&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to ensure that never changed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nBill has said th=\r\ney&#39;re open to change it, and no matter how evil you&lt;br&gt;\nthink RH is, an=\r\nything has to start somewhere. Why not just see it as a&lt;br&gt;\nhonest starting=\r\n point? The truth will be flushed out *extremely* quick&lt;br&gt;\nif we all jumpe=\r\nd on it and made it truly RESTful, no? (Assuming fixing&lt;br&gt;\nthe governing m=\r\nodel, of course, which Bill says they are happy to do.&lt;br&gt;\nI don&#39;t know=\r\n these people, and can only take them at face value)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And=\r\n, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Leads&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; o=\r\nwning the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the=\r\ny know damn well that their current market is shrinking: their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ent=\r\nire product architecture is based on J2EE, the giant black&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hole of=\r\n Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nDoesn&#39;t a lo=\r\nt of innovation happen this way, though?
