If the system is document-oriented, then this generic\n&gt;&gt; dialect will need to express common semantics like lists, headings,\n&gt;&gt; title, tabular data, paragraphs and the like.  Which is why HTML\n&gt;&gt; extensibility is such a big issue -- it seems like less work to me to\n&gt;&gt; extend HTML, than it is to start over from scratch with a custom media\n&gt;&gt; type.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you may have seen from my other answers, I am getting more and more \n&gt; convinced about the viability of a pure HTML approach. One of my issues with \n&gt; HTML extensions has been that different vendors would use different \n&gt; extension schemes and that would sort of defeat the idea of having one \n&gt; unified way to serialize data back and forth.\n\nGreat :)\n\n&gt; But now that I start to understand more of RDFa it looks more and more \n&gt; viable to use HTML + RDFa. That would allow the client code to work on \n&gt; generic RDF tripples instead of figuring out all the strange ways to encode \n&gt; a case file, or a purchase order, in HTML. All it requires is that the \n&gt; client implements (downloads) a RDFa preprocessor. Voila - all the \n&gt; difficulties of working with various HTML encodings disappear with one swing \n&gt; of the magic wand :-)\n\nRDFa API, RDF API and JS implementations there of can help you there ;)\n\n&gt; All I need now is a way to mark up forms such that they decouple semantics \n&gt; like &quot;this is the case title&quot; from the query variable names.\n\nPerhaps, perhaps not, why not simply use contenteditable to edit the \ntitle in place, then PUT the entire HTML document back to the server.. \nall these things can be so simple, if you think about it, what&#39;s the \npoint in giving one admin view (an edit article type page) to a client, \nthen taking things in form input, saving them in a database, pulling \nthem back out, and putting them in a template, then trying to sort out \nhttp cacheing etc, when you can simply GET an empty page, type right in \nto it, and PUT it back as a static document? (with optional processing, \naugmentation/annotation on the server side)\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
