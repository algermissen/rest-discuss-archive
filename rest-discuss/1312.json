A\n&gt; client then will create a PO instance document which conforms to\n&gt; the XML Schema, and submit that XML document as the payload of an\n&gt; HTTP POST. \n&gt; Correct?\n\nWalter Perry, leader of the NY XML SIG, has a different view when it \ncomes to interacting with processes. I will do my best try to express \nmy understanding of his views. In Walter&#39;s eyes the most important \nthing for a user to determine is what is a process&#39;s output. If the \noutput is not of use, then the process is not of use. Walter is a \nlittle bit vaguer about how to identify a processes input format, he \nalways says something like &#39;the best way to determine a process&#39;s \ninput is to look at its output&#39; (paraphrased).\n\nPerhaps in this example of a PO, a more interesting approach is for \nthe user to do a GET on a blank PO URI. This could return a PO XML \ninstance with the parts and amounts left blank, but the whole XML \nstructure present. Then the user could fill in the amounts and parts \nrequired and do a POST to the orders URI. This way if the service \nprovider needs to change the PO format in a minor way, the chance of \naffecting the users is less because for each transaction the user \nbegins by doing a GET on the blank PO URI. And if the user is clever \nthey will add their details to the blank order in a way that won&#39;t be \naffected by such minor changes (for example if an extra element is \nadded). (This is my personal interpretation of Walter&#39;s \nmysterious &quot;start with the output&quot;).\n\nWhat does everyone think?\n\nAs for validation, Walter says it is up for the process to \ninstantiate an instance of the data from the input it is given. And \nthe user can determine if their input to the process was adequate if \nthey get meaningful output. So schemata and DTDs are not required.\n\nRegards,\nRobert McKinnon\n\n\n\n"}}
