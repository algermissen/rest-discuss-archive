Costello&quot; wrote:\n&gt; c. I don&#39;t agree with calling it a purchase order on the CompanyA \nside\n&gt; and a sales order on the CompanyB side.  In my business, when a \nclient\n&gt; sends me a purchase order I still call it a purchase order.  How I \ntreat\n&gt; the PO may be different than how the client treats the PO.  But I \nstill\n&gt; call it a PO.\n\nQuestions for Roger and others:\n1. When you place POs with your suppliers, do you call them POs too? \nHow do you differentiate in normal conversation or computer systems \nbetween your POs to your suppliers and POs from your customers?\n2. If you take the POs from your customers into your internal \nbusiness apps, are they still called POs?  \n\nThe larger context for these questions is that I think in all cases \nof business exchanges between trading partners, there is a set of \nmatched resources on each side that have different names but are \nlogically related to the same business commitment or event.\n\nIn other words, each of them could be managed either by a 2-resource \nHOPP configuration or a one-resource config.\n\nOther examples, with 2 resources and (1 resource):\n* Product shipment and receipt (product transfer).\n* Cash disbursement and cash receipt (cash transfer).\n* Accounts Payable and Receivable (claims).\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
