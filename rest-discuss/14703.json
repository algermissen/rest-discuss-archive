That is, perform some other requests using partiluar domain semantics of an accessed service?\n\nFor example, think of a client configuration that would cause the client to allways execute several searches when the home page of an online store is reached that provides OpenSearch forms?\n\njan\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
