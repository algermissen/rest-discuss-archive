I&#39;m fairly certain that the cache is not allowed to update its\n&gt; contents based on that PUT request, since it has no idea whether the PUT\n&gt; will even be accepted by the origin server.\n&gt; \n&gt; What it *is* allowed to do, though, is mark its cached copies as\n&gt; &#39;stale&#39;, so that the next GET request for that resource will cause the\n&gt; cache to query the origin server for the most recent version.\n&gt; \n&gt; This behaviour is only given the strength of &#39;SHOULD&#39;, since not doing\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t weaken the caching semantics in any way. The old version of\n&gt; the resource can still be served until it expires -- just as all of the\n&gt; other caches, which didn&#39;t see the PUT, will be doing.\n\nThat&#39;s exactly my interpretation.\n\n&gt; &gt; If the origin server had changed &quot;&lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;&quot; to\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&lt;number&gt;one&lt;/number&gt;&quot; things could get ugly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If PUT did require the entity to be stored as-is (which we keep\n&gt; &gt; hearing it does) then this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think this section of RFC 2616 has anything to say about whether\n&gt; the server must store the entity as-is.\n\nWell, the first sentence of section 9.6 says;\n\n&quot;The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\nsupplied Request-URI.&quot;\n\nI know some people have a more liberal interpretation of &quot;store&quot; than\nI do, which is fine.  But I think that a significant number think -\nand more importantly, have written software that assumes - that &quot;store&quot;\nmeans, well, &quot;store&quot;. 8-)\n\nI don&#39;t know how much software out there makes this assumption, but\nI&#39;d be willing to bet money that anybody developing software that\ndoesn&#39;t make this assumption, will eventually have problems when it\ndiscovers the other software.\n\nDoesn&#39;t WebDAV + supporting specs assume that PUT = store?
