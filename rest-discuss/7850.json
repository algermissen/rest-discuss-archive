I certainly agree that as a\n&gt; general statement, REST isn&#39;t testable as it is an architectural style\n&gt; ... however ... I think that it is possible to make testable RESTful\n&gt; patterns. There will be more than one pattern, to be sure, but each\n&gt; pattern will be testable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working on EARL test / assertion representations of my own\n&gt; pattern and an engine to exercise EARL instances (hence the diagram I\n&gt; showed the group last month). Having this would permit a web\n&gt; application to claim a &#39;conformance level&#39; to a specific pattern -\n&gt; just as HTML can claim various WCAG conformance levels.\n\nOh! that&#39;s excellent.
