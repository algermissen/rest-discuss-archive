As you  \nmay have seen, the URI gets handled by an intermediary which will  \nunpack the request and execute individual requests. Given this, the  \nactual URI may end up looking like &quot;/batchServer&quot;. If the same server  \nprocessing the batch, then you may just be mapping /Books to some  \nbatch processing component in the server.\n\nSubbu\n\n\nOn Feb 14, 2008, at 5:13 PM, Ebenezer Ikonne wrote:\n\n&gt; I accidentally posted my reply to Subbu.\n&gt;\n&gt; To summarize, I understand the need for POST given that BATCH does not\n&gt; exist.
