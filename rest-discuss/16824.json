Obviously, to compare\n&gt; we need a set of criteria, like abstraction level, domain matching,\n&gt; paradigm matching, etc.\n&gt;\n\nYup.  Actually, I&#39;d be a lot happier if, as a class, these were called\n&quot;HTTP Frameworks&quot; because otherwise, there&#39;s an implication that REST\nis achieved by using the framework.  Without implying anything about\nany framework, RESTlet does indeed directly map REST terminology into\nconfiguration.  But in reality, a RESTful outcome is the least likely\nfor beginners, regardless of framework.  You just can&#39;t abstract away\nhaving to learn REST; once you have learned, you&#39;ll find most frameworks\nworking against you unless their assumptions are congruous with your\nown.\n\nI&#39;d better shut up now, lest I piss off a bunch of people I have a\ngreat deal of respect for, who are involved in such work.  Instead of\ncomparison criteria, I&#39;d suggest devising two or three REST systems\n(doesn&#39;t have to be anything complicated) as reference, basing your\ncomparison on the implementation experience of each reference across\neach target framework.  I&#39;d also suggest the subjective results be\norganized in terms of REST 2.3.4 and 2.3.6, with objective results in\nterms of 2.3.1.1.\n\nI&#39;d really be interested in such results, particularly an everything-\nelse-being-equal performance analysis.  The test methodology could be\nduplicated, and anyone else could run the tests on the same frameworks\nin the future, or newly-introduced frameworks, or as QA if developing a\nframework.  It&#39;d be more work for me to implement the reference systems\nin my not-a-REST-framework, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d gain valuable insight by\ncomparing against the subjective experiences of others implementing the\nsame thing on different frameworks.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
