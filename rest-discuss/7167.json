Buyer: propose offer to buy (e.g. a purchase order)\n2. Seller: checks availability\n3. Seller: reserves credit\n4. Seller: accepts offer (e.g. Amazon&#39;s order confirmation)\n5. Seller: ships goods\n6. Seller: draws down payment\n7. Buyer: receives goods\n8: Buyer: confirms receipt\n\nI know, that will seem like a stateful conversation which goes against\nall REST principles, but Paul Prescod and others have sketched out how\nto do it without violating those principles.\n\nBeen done to some extent using EDI and ebXML, but those\nimplementations usually cover propose-accept or ship-receive\nseparately, not wholistically (e.g. all 8 steps above).  both of those\nuse messages to endpoints which are not resources in any RESTian\nsense.\n\nWS-BPEL uses half of processes like that as examples, and\nWS-Choreography uses the whole of processes like that as examples, but\nI don&#39;t know anybody who has implemented any of those example\nprocesses in real life.\n\n"}}
