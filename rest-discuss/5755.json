Any\ninformation that can be named can be a =\r\nresource: a document or image,\na temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in=\r\n Los Angeles&quot;), a\ncollection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g.=\r\n a person),\nand so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target=\r\n of an\nauthor&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a\nres=\r\nource.&quot;\n\nThe important word there is &quot;concept&quot;. A resource is only a concep=\r\nt\nand a resource identifier (URI) &quot;allows an author to reference the\nconcep=\r\nt&quot;. When you &quot;place a file on your web server&quot; you are actually\nuploading a=\r\n representation that is mapped to the resources &quot;/&quot; and\n&quot;/index.html&quot;. Sure=\r\nly, you can&#39;t upload &quot;a person&quot; which is also a\nvalid resource. Notice I us=\r\ned the word &quot;mapped&quot; there.\n\nNow, the last sentence of para 2 says:\n&quot;The on=\r\nly thing that is required to be static for a resource is the\nsemantics of t=\r\nhe mapping, since the semantics is what distinguishes\none resource from ano=\r\nther.&quot;\n\nThe semantics of the mapping for the &quot;website&quot; is different from th=\r\nat\nof the &quot;websites favicon&quot; and the &quot;websites privacy policy&quot;. Since the\ns=\r\nemantics are different they are different resources! So when you say:\n&quot;We n=\r\now have at least three different formats that can be returned\nwhen making a=\r\n request to http://example.com.&quot;, you are blurring the\ndifference between t=\r\nhe mapping and the semantics of the mapping. The\n&quot;default document&quot; is a ma=\r\npping issue and the &quot;favicon&quot; and &quot;privacy\npolicy&quot; are issues related to th=\r\ne semantics of the mapping.\n\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n[1]=\r\n http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec=\r\n_5_2_1_1\n\n\nOn 3/23/06, Seairth Jacobs &lt;seairth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     =\r\n   I think we all agree that any request for a resource only returns a repr=\r\nesentation of the resource, not the resource itself.  No matter how hard yo=\r\nu try, you only get back representations of the resource.  What muddies thi=\r\ns view is the way in which the web is currently used.  For instance, you pl=\r\nace a file on your web server named index.html and assign it a URI (http://=\r\nexample.com/index.html).  Someone issues a GET request for that URI and get=\r\ns back an identical copy of the resource.  This would lead many to the conc=\r\nlusion that index.html is itself the resource, and since you get exactly th=\r\nat back (byte-wise) in a GET request, the representation is effectively the=\r\n resource itself.  As a result, many conveniently collapse the representati=\r\non and the resource into one (which we know is not possible in REST).\n&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\nWhat makes this worse is that we have some conventions (outdated, in my opi=\r\nnion) that adds to the confusion.  For instance, if you type in http://exam=\r\nple.com, most servers will look for and return a &quot;default document&quot; such as=\r\n index.html.  No, it doesn&#39;t redirect the user to that file.  It doesn&#39;t re=\r\nturn a representation of its own resource, rather it impersonates another r=\r\nesource.  As a result, many consider http://example.com and http://example.=\r\ncom/index.html to be one and the same resource (which it isn&#39;t, or else it =\r\nwould have only one URI).  In fact, it is often worse than that, as http://=\r\nexample.com/ will usually generate the same result as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Another ex=\r\nample is the &quot;.html&quot; on the end of http://example.com/index.html.  Most loo=\r\nk at that and figure that they are getting back the exact contents of a fil=\r\ne on the remote system called index.html.  With this view, the web server i=\r\ns nothing but a file server with a different name.   Further, the web has b=\r\neen a document-driven tool, historically speaking.  The problem is that thi=\r\ns contributes to the lack of strict adherence to the separation of resource=\r\n from representation.\n&gt;\n&gt;  When we talk of a website, it is a resource (we =\r\nhave a URI for it).  No, it is not an html document.  It is not a document =\r\nat all.  It is a resource.   I do not say &quot;hey, check out my website at htt=\r\np://example.com/index.html.&quot;  I say &quot;hey, check out my website at http://ex=\r\nample.com&quot;, because that is the URI.  Now, what should someone expect to ge=\r\nt back when issuing a GET against http://example.com?  Well, first, it depe=\r\nnds on what the requester understands (i.e. what content-types are passed i=\r\nn the Accept: header).  Second, it depends on what content-types the resour=\r\nce can be represented as.  Third, it depends on what constitutes the meanin=\r\ng of &quot;site&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Is the index.html file on the server part of that?  I wou=\r\nld not say say &quot;this page is representing my site&quot;, rather &quot;this is the hom=\r\ne page of my site&quot;.  As a result, it is appropriate for the file to have it=\r\ns own URI (http://example.com/index.html).\n&gt;\n&gt;  Is the icon that one might =\r\nuse to place next to the URI in their bookmarks part of that?  I would not =\r\nsay &quot;this icon represents the links on my site&quot;, rather &quot;this icon represen=\r\nts my site.&quot;  As a result, it is appropriate to be returned via my site URI=\r\n (http://example.com).\n&gt;\n&gt;  Is the privacy policy (p3p) part of that?  I wo=\r\nuld not say &quot;this privacy policy represents the all of the other pages on m=\r\ny site&quot;, rather &quot;this privacy policy represents my site&quot;.  As a result, it =\r\nis appropriate to be returned via my site URI (http://example.com).\n&gt;\n&gt;  Bu=\r\nt does that mean that http://example.com has no html representation?  Maybe=\r\n, maybe not.  If I could come up with an html response that represents my s=\r\nite, then I would return it.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t.  Of course, given our =\r\nhistorical use of the web, not returning an html document (or something sim=\r\nilar) would be problematic.  Hence the popular &quot;default document&quot; approach.=\r\n  Suppose, however, that I do have an html representation of my site (not w=\r\nhatever is in index.html).\n&gt;\n&gt;  We now have at least three different format=\r\ns that can be returned when making a request to http://example.com.  Which =\r\none is returned?  Simply the preferred of those available (likely, the html=\r\n representation).  But it is still just one resource.  Not three resources.=\r\n  Not two resources.  Just one.\n&gt;\n&gt;  And if you are hung up on the fact tha=\r\nt a p3p response does not appear to be similar to an icon or html response,=\r\n think about this:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Suppose we have a resource consisting of the follow=\r\ning letter sequence:  ABCD.  Now, suppose we have three content-types (fict=\r\nional), such that if you do a GET on the URI for this resource for each of =\r\nthe three content types, you get back the following responses:\n&gt;\n&gt;  content=\r\n-type-a: AB\n&gt;  content-type-b: BC\n&gt;  content-type-c: CD\n&gt;\n&gt;  Now, you could=\r\n say that AB and BC look similar.  You can say the same about BC and CD.  B=\r\nut what about AB and CD?  These appear to be discrete representations.  But=\r\n we know that they are all representations of the same resource.  Just beca=\r\nuse they don&#39;t look the same does not mean that they aren&#39;t representations=\r\n of the same resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;  And if you are hung up on the on the question o=\r\nf having two html responses or two icons for the same resource, you can&#39;t. =\r\n Think of the content-type like a filter one might hold up to light.  What =\r\nyou get is all that can be represented through that filter, no more or less=\r\n. The html response is the only html response and the icon is the only icon=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  To sum it all up, content types (and negotiation) can be used in a=\r\n perfectly RESTful manner.   Further, I think it could improve the current =\r\nstate of the web.  However, we are bringing along much baggage, which makes=\r\n this difficult.  It also requires people to take on and embrace the notion=\r\n of resources and representations, which I don&#39;t think many are yet willing=\r\n to do (or are even aware of the possibility).  Whether this is because it =\r\nlooks like too much work, or because it&#39;s too different, or whatever, is as=\r\n good your guess as mine.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Seairth\n\n"}}
