For all these years,\nwe have been =\r\neducated to use cookie and server session management in\nmost of cookbooks a=\r\nnd tutorials. Yet many code libraries are built\nbased on such habits.\n\nI th=\r\nink a good way to answer questions, is to build a simple web app\nbased on w=\r\nhat we understand about REST, and incrementally learn from\nthe experience. =\r\nTry to build a toy first to figure out where&#39;s the\nreal problem that bother=\r\n you, it helps. :-)\n\nIf REST has been published a decade ago, I&#39;m sure toda=\r\ny we will have\nenough frameworks, tutorials and examples to answer all the =\r\nquestions.\nBut hey, for this moment, those are the things we have to build =\r\nup for\nppl in the coming decade. ;-)\n\nOn 12/17/05, Jan Algermissen &lt;jalgerm=\r\nissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 17, 2005, at 6:01 AM, Lyle Kopnic=\r\nky wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Where do I put the &quot;I forgot my password&quot; button?
