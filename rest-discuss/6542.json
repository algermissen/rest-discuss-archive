A membership function is not a set.\nThe value of that function for a given time t is a set.  The resource is\nthe continuity of those values over time, not the value at any given\ninstant in time.\n\nYour analogy starts off on the wrong foot by talking about resources\nin terms of how they might be implemented (a box of apples).\n\nA better framework for an analogy is a double-sided wall of pigeon-hole\nboxes, with doors, a button, and a label per box on each side.  The\nclient side of the wall can only see the labels on their own side.\nThe server side of the wall can only see the labels on their own side.\nWhen the client pushes a button, the button on the opposite side  \nlights up.\nThe server side then opens their door, places something corresponding to\ntheir server-side label in the hole, and closes their door -- causing  \nthe\ncorresponding client-side button to light up. The client then opens the\ndoor, grabs what was placed in the hole, and closes their door.   \nFinally,\nthe client decides whether or not to change the label on their side of\nthe door based on what was received when the button was pushed.  The\nclient has no idea what is behind the door or how the holes get filled.\n\n&quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; are only used here for a directional sense, so\nvariations an be made for writing (e.g., the client could place\nsomething in the hole first and then push the button, or there\ncould be more than one type of button, etc.).\n\nNow you can add apples and oranges to that framework and make an\nanalogy.\n\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
