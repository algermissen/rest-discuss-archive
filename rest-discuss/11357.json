Per-resource URIs were a meme already but\n&gt;  &gt; unsafe GETs were pervasive.\n&gt; \n&gt; POX was not / is not a &#39;standard&#39; in any way that I&#39;m aware of. I was\n&gt; using XML-over-HTTP by POSTing back in 2000/2001. Later, this was\n&gt; classified as POX (by whom, I do not know). Mostly, it was very\n&gt; XML-RPC in implementation style. It wasn&#39;t until TechEd 2002 in\n&gt; Barcelona that I first heard of REST (which, in itself, is very\n&gt; interesting because that was the big coming-out party for the first MS\n&gt; WS-* stack in .NET).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;POX is to WS-*&quot; ... &quot;what Dinosaurs are to Birds&quot; ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
