Searched the list but\ncoul=\r\ndn&#39;t find a concrete answer, so shooting my question here.\n\nFor performance=\r\n reasons, we think that an aggregate request is a good\nidea. For example, l=\r\net&#39;s say a server keeps users and their presence\nstatus. In a typical opera=\r\ntion, the client will request list of users\nand a separate request for thei=\r\nr presence status. Since user/presence\nstatus are separate resources, the c=\r\nlient makes separate requests like \n\nGET /users/&lt;id&gt; and GET /presence/&lt;id&gt;=\r\n\n\nIf I want to express an aggregate operation for retrieving user info\nAND =\r\nthe presence info, how would I express that in the URI?\n\nCreating a composi=\r\nte resource is probably not a good idea as there can\nmany combinations of r=\r\nesources. Any ideas?\n\nthanks,\n\n-rama\n\n\n"}}
