This lets the UA\ndecides if it can process teh link or not.\n\nAccept: tells the server which formats it can process.\n\nIf a UA can&#39;t understand the @type, it probably can&#39;t process it and may\nignore it. If it can, and it issues an Accept header, then surely that type\nwill be in the Accept header anyway.\n\nIf you want to distinctly identify two documents separately, you give them\ntwo URIs. If the difference between the two representations don&#39;t matter to\nthe client (aka there is no significant semantic difference between the two\nformats), then two representations can be served as conneg&#39;d resources.\n\nSeb\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-\n&gt; discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Mike Kelly\n&gt; Sent: 22 September 2009 14:27\n&gt; To: Rest List\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Content negotiation and hypermedia\n&gt; \n&gt; Do we want hypermedia formats like HTML to allow us to advise UAs on\n&gt; appropriate conneg values for a given hyperlink, or is control data\n&gt; intended to be static and isolated away from our hyperlinks?\n&gt; \n&gt; HTML has a type attribute for hyperlink elements such as script, style,\n&gt; anchor - it is used to advise on the media type that should be\n&gt; expected;\n&gt; but it is not, for some reason, intended to affect the Accept header\n&gt; for\n&gt; requests to the corresponding URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to make sense to me that it should, so I filed a bug report.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7697\n&gt; \n&gt; Description:\n&gt; \n&gt; Section: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#hyperlink-\n&gt; elements\n&gt;  &lt;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#hyperlink-\n&gt; elements&gt;\n&gt; The type attribute should ammend the Accept header accordingly. HTTP\n&gt; spec is in\n&gt; accordance with the rules here, in terms of the Accept header being\n&gt; non-authorative. script and style elements already ammend accept header\n&gt; (in\n&gt; firefox) but not for other link elements. This behaviour would be\n&gt; valuable for\n&gt; enabling HTML powered applications which leverage HTTP conneg.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------- /Comment #1 From Ian &#39;Hixie&#39; Hickson &lt;mailto:ian@...&gt;\n&gt; 2009-09-22 11:49:32/ -------\n&gt; \n&gt; Accept should reflect what the UA accepts, not what the page says the\n&gt; server\n&gt; provides.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------- /Comment #2 From Mike Kelly &lt;mailto:mike@...&gt;\n&gt; 2009-09-22 12:48:01/ -------\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian that would appear to be incorrect given that, according to the HTTP\n&gt; spec,\n&gt; the Accept header is simply intended to indicate the appropriate media\n&gt; types\n&gt; for a response to a given request:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media\n&gt; types\n&gt; which are acceptable for the response&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the value of the Accept header should be taken (if specified) from\n&gt; the type\n&gt; attribute for a given hyperlink element - which is presumably why\n&gt; firefox\n&gt; modifies the accept header for the style and script elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; This allows hyperlinks to specific representations that must be\n&gt; negotiated via\n&gt; HTTP content negotiation - as it stands, it is not possible to specify\n&gt; such a\n&gt; link with HTML5.\n&gt; \n&gt; i.e. currently - these links would actually generate identical requests\n&gt; with\n&gt; the same Accept header:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;a type=&#39;application/xml&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in xml&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a type=&#39;application/json&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in json&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If implemented any existing mechanisms which disregard the Accept\n&gt; header would\n&gt; remain unaffected by the change.\n&gt; \n&gt; If no type is specified then default UA Accept header value should be\n&gt; assumed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
