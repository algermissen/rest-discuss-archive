Don&#39;t introduce new\n&gt; methods to deal with &quot;properties&quot;. Instead, interact with a resource (in\n&gt; this case the .htaccess file) that defines those properties. Use a\n&gt; content-type that is understood by this resource to define the\n&gt; properties. Technically you should probably be registering the format of\n&gt; that htaccess file with the iana and making its content an rfc, but that\n&gt; is the only place this approach really falls short.\n\nCan&#39;t say that I like the idea of making an internal structure public,\nsuch as an htaccess file (which is specific to Apache anyway afaik,\nand I&#39;m not using Apache). I have the feeling that there are numerous\nsecurity issues with that. Plus, as you say, there is no registered\nmime type.\n\nThis is why I was investigating the possibility of using the\nmessage/http mime type.\n\n&gt; As for MOVE... well that has been covered. Don&#39;t use it. You have no\n&gt; right to assume that the server you send the MOVE to will be able to\n&gt; operate on the two identified resources simultaneously. It could be a\n&gt; mashup of several different services. MOVE introduces unnecessary\n&gt; coupling, let alone its other failures already noted in this and other\n&gt; threads. Its benefits do not outweigh its problems.\n\nI wasn&#39;t intending to use MOVE, simply trying to identify how to\nrestfully carry out an operation that &quot;looks like a move&quot;, followed by\nestablishing a temporary or permanent redirect as a user-agent\ndecision.\n\nRegards, Alan\n\n"}}
