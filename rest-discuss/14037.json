in the literature: We=\r\nb Oriented Architecture, I haven&#39;t read about it, so I don&#39;t know what it i=\r\ns. \n \nMy PhD is about REST too, more to the Semantic end, however I&#39;m on ki=\r\nnd of a crossroads right now and I&#39;m taking time to re-review and understan=\r\nd the bigger picture. And as my supervisor says, go beyond the buzzwords.  =\r\n \n \nRegards,\n\nAreeb\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;swschilke&quot; &lt;stef=\r\nfen.schilke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear *.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am developing a rest-like archit=\r\necture for my dissertation. Mobile clients shall communicate back and forth=\r\n with the server. I wonder if you could kindly point me out some (academic)=\r\n papers, articles and patterns/best practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition I would be =\r\ninterested in material about WADL and a graphical representation of it - I =\r\nfound one paper but that stops short before the interesting part. Did someo=\r\nne here use various UML diagramms to describe their REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would high=\r\nly appreciate your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards\n&gt; \n&gt; S.W.Schilke\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: speaki=\r\nng of academic - you might be interested in the CfP at www.inc2010.org\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
