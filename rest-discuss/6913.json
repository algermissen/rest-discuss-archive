Fielding wrote:\n\n&gt; Then why is it so hard to accept that an ARCHITECTURAL STYLE\n&gt; cannot itself be implemented, just as there is no implementation\n&gt; of green (only examples)? And that not being implementable in its\n&gt; style form does not mean that an architecture cannot be constructed\n&gt; in such a way as to fit our agreed style? And that being abstract\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean it is worthless to be able to talk about the style,\n&gt; examine its characteristics, debate which ones are &quot;best&quot; for a\n&gt; given application, and generally enjoy learning something that you\n&gt; might not have known last week?\n&gt; \n&gt; We can talk about green, various shades of green, and all the\n&gt; other colors that, when combined, do not come out green. Children\n&gt; have no problem understanding such things, though they might not\n&gt; yet understand the properties of light and vision that make it all\n&gt; work. Software architectural styles are much more complex, which\n&gt; means you need to spend a lot more time thinking about the subject\n&gt; (and drawing experiments) before it finally becomes clear. And\n&gt; at that point you won&#39;t be complaining about abstractions: you&#39;ll\n&gt; start looking for other colors.\n\nAll that needs to be said is that REST is a design style by which \nimplementations can be evaluated and system behaviours can be predicted. \nI can&#39;t evaluate or critique a shade of green via the concept of green, \nnot in any way that isn&#39;t crashingly trivial or tautological. I can \nevaluate a system&#39;s propsed design or post-facto design via the concepts \nof REST in non-trivial ways. I can also use REST to make predictions \nabout how an implementation will behave - and, most important -  if I \ncan induce similar behaviors without resorting to REST, then I know the \nREST theory isn&#39;t entirely adequate as an explanatory tool. Software as \nscience, not witchcraft.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
