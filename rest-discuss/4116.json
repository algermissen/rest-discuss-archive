As a result,\nserver developers can focus on generating correct\ndata and client developers can focus on presenting\nthis data to the user in optimal fashion.  The\nclient/server contract is defined by the\nDTD/Schema for the XML.\n\nIn this world, the XSLT developer should be\ncompletely ignorant of server architecture,\ndepending entirely on the content of the generated\nXML to construct HTML pages.  In particular, the\nXML should supply both href and action attribute\nvalues.  It should also supply the information for\nthe XSLT developer to construct HTML forms to\nquery/post to those action resources.\n\nThe problem is we need to choose a way to present\nthat information.  My suggestion is to use relaxNG\nin the following manner:\n\n &lt;form action=&quot;url&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; src=&quot;schema.rng&quot;/&gt;\n\nOr the relax schema can be the content of the form element.\n\nNote: relaxNG is superior to DTDs in this context\nbecause the XSLT can process it directly.  I\nprefer it to XML schema because it is simpler.\n\nAn issue w/ using an XML specification language\nhere is that you need to use javascript to get\nbrowsers to POST XML and perhaps you don&#39;t want to\npass XML in query strings.  The question is\nwhether these issues loom so large that it is\nworth the complexity of Yet Another Forms\nSpefication System (RDF-Forms, WIDL, X-Forms,\netc).\n\nI&#39;d rather just have the server automatically\ninterpret a name/value posting as\n&lt;POST&gt;&lt;name&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;&lt;name2&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/POST&gt;\netc.  And have the schema/dtd specify which\nnames are valid in what combination and number.\nOr use javascript on the client to do better.\n\nThoughts?\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.
