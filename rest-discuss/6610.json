Multiple\n&gt; ontologies are enclosed in an rdf, and nearly-so for microformats.\n\nThat is an excellent observation and comparision! 100% agreed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The saving grace for micformats may be the rigid control wielded by\n&gt; Tantek to ensure that there is a single namespace for microformats  \n&gt; and a\n&gt; single recognised place where microformats are specified. If the\n&gt; community split there may be more problems, but for now you could  \n&gt; argue\n&gt; that microformats are still describing a single ontology, though one\n&gt; that is described in a modular fashion across multiple documents.\n\nAs long as one can usefully implement client software that has built-in\nawareness of the various microformats the approach is fine. As allways,\ntime will tell what gets adopted and what not. Developers just do face\nthe burdon of tracking that process with implementations (that is not\nso very different with &#39;real&#39; standards, BTW)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Microformats also have an edge over &quot;straight&quot; RESTafarianism. They  \n&gt; have\n&gt; a lot of source information to work from when devloping a standard.  \n&gt; They\n&gt; will only standardise encoding for information already widely  \n&gt; published\n&gt; on the web, and only when several attempts have already been made to\n&gt; define content types for the information. Their process is then to\n&gt; cherry-pick the best fits to examples in the wild.\n\nYes, and their symbiotic relationship with their host-format is next\nto ideal. I wonder if/when Atom becomes a host for them. OTH, maybe\nthe relationship we see now with Atom/APP and Atom extensions is\nconceptually equivalent to the one between HTML and microformats.\nWhile Atom does the heavy work extension developers can focus on\nhitting the 80/20 point with their semantics.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A similar approach may be able to be taken by RESTafarians defining  \n&gt; new\n&gt; content types. Using information available on the web may still be a\n&gt; viable way to collect samples. As to how these would fit with\n&gt; applications that need to use the type, well that would still be\n&gt; something of an unknown.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
