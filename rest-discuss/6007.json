Mainly, caching.  If the\n&gt;  &gt; session has a URI, it can be cached.  If the session key is in a cookie,\n&gt;  &gt; the session cannot be cached.  So, I think the way to do it is something\n&gt;  &gt; like:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; GET http://www.example.com/basket/12/checkout.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I think your proposed URI design is a bad idea. If I were designing this\n&gt; application I would associate &#39;shopping basket&#39; with the &#39;session&#39; and\n&gt; imply it by &#39;session token&#39;. I would not put it in the URL. It&#39;s a bad\n&gt; idea. I can&#39;t think how to explain why in less than 50,000 words though,\n&gt; because it feels like I have to go all the way back to first principles.\n&gt; \n&gt; I admit that if you deny the possibility of &#39;subject&#39; in the HTTP\n&gt; request (i.e. you don&#39;t use a session cookie) that this is the only real\n&gt; thing you can do. However, I disagree that making such denials is a\n&gt; reasonable thing to do.\n\nYou&#39;re overstating your case.\n\nThe main talking point with Bill&#39;s approach is creating a new URI for \neach server-identified state of the basket. That btw, is very like the \nRails /img.png?20060404 idiom that Tim Bray recently blogged about and \nhas been described as &quot;layer mixing&quot;. Layering&#39;s not the problem tho&#39;, \nincoherency is*. IMO the pattern &quot;Assign URIs To Representations&quot; \nresults in protocol gibberish.\n\nThe preferred approach is to ask the basket for its state using GET. \nThat is, the basket needs a URI, but the application doesn&#39;t need a URI \nfor each state of the basket.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n* that the Rails people are doing this for caching purposes is a red \nherring.\n\n"}}
