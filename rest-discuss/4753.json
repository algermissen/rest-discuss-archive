What do you mean by \n&#39;talk to distributed resources&#39;?\n\n&gt;    build me a distributed set of resources (and a client-application\n&gt;that can query/integrate the results from each)   -- and then you&#39;re \n&gt;on to something...I want to send a book to my dad, so I type in part\n&gt;of the title -- ship that to a search-resource on Amazon, \n&gt;get the ISBN number, query my address-book for my dad&#39;s mailing\n&gt;address...push that to the Barnes and Noble web-site order \n&gt;resource...plug in my credit card number and BOOM \n&gt;-- sale pending.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBesides the question wheather your address book is on the Web or not \n(could do this in a bunch of ways) all of what you request can be done \neasily with any scripting labguage that provides an HTTP implementation. \nIt is actually one of the easiest use cases, because it does not involve \nthe need for any form of transaction (there is only one order-request at \nthe end). Given JavaScrips&#39;s emerging capability to issue arbitrary HTTP \nrequests, the whole flow could also be done as a JS function (that&#39;s \npropably worthwhile investigating).\n\nHmm....using RDF (or Topic Maps) as an integration data model you could \npropably fill in an HTML form and hit an &#39;order&#39; button that will \ntriggger the following JS functionality: read title form field and send \nto Amazon to get ISBN -&gt; read &#39;receiver name&#39; field and go to your \naddress book to find address -&gt; integrate both answers (using RDF) and \nexport as B&N&#39;s accepted MIME type for POSTing the order. GET on the 201 \norder-URI response header of the POST and fill in your credit card \nnumber in the received form. POST back to B&N and do an additional \nMONITOR on the order URI, supplying your email address as the \nnotification target.\n\nMakes sense?\n\nJan\n\n&gt;    --erik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
