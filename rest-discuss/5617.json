Each mix is completely specified by two \n&gt; identifiers in a specific order and its representation would \n&gt; be an mp3 file.  Although a URI for each resource could \n&gt; exist, there would be too many combinations to store all \n&gt; possible mixed mp3 files on the origin server simultaneously \n&gt; (and maybe some that would never be requested).  It would \n&gt; therefore necessary to generate them when required in a batch \n&gt; process and cache the most recently requested files on disk \n&gt; for future requests.\n&gt; \n&gt; From the clients perspective I see two possible states of the \n&gt; resource (neglecting errors): &#39;mixing&#39; and &#39;complete&#39;.  I was \n&gt; thinking the simplest approach would be to have a single URI \n&gt; for each combination of mixed audio files. While mixing it \n&gt; would be represented by an XML message indicating an \n&gt; estimated time at which the file can be dereferenced from \n&gt; this same URI. The mp3 would then be made available from this \n&gt; URI when completed and cached.  Does representing different \n&gt; states of a single resource with different MIME types violate REST?\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that the &#39;mixing&#39; and &#39;complete&#39; states are determined \n&gt; indirectly by the clients requests, and the server decides \n&gt; how long they should be cached, I reason that it is only \n&gt; necessary for the client to GET the current representations \n&gt; of this state.  In this case is it reasonable to represent \n&gt; the mixing state with a &#39;202 Accepted&#39;\n&gt; status code to indicate processing is not yet complete, even \n&gt; though the client has not explicitly requested that this \n&gt; process be performed with say POST or PUT?.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts on this or other ways to solve this type of \n&gt; problem in a RESTful manner would be much appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
