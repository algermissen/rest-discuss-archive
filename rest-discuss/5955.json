So, the client periodically sends a POST to the server, which \n&gt;&gt; responds with any pending &quot;reverse request&quot;.  End of connection.  When the \n&gt;&gt; client finishes processing the reverse request, it does another POST to the \n&gt;&gt; server to send the result.  The server either responds with another reverse \n&gt;&gt; request, or indicates there are no more pending reverse requests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m doing it this way because my HTTP server is single-threaded, so I can&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; tie it up with an open socket.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; This is terrible judgement and very fun.  A pox on your kludged-up soul!\n&gt;   \nWell, I don&#39;t see any other way to do it.  Someone say &quot;the firewall is \nthere for a reason&quot;.  Yes, it&#39;s there to keep people from the outside \nfrom getting at machines on the inside.  But with my inverted request \nmechanism, an arbitrary machine from the outside still can&#39;t send a \nrequest to the inside.  A machine from the inside has to contact the \noutside server, to request a request.  So I don&#39;t think I&#39;m violating \nthe spirit of the firewall.\n\nI guess could all be done via some proprietary protocol, instead of \nHTTP.  But why reinvent the wheel?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
