Doing a=\r\n &quot;view source&quot; on that\nURL will show you the raw markup. I have a few more =\r\nexamples based on\nthis proto-media-type, but haven&#39;t published them.\n\nThat =\r\nprototype uses elements based on my Hypermedia Factors[2].\n\nI also publishe=\r\nd a blog post on designing hypermedia types that\ncontains a sample machine-=\r\noriented media type example[3]. This is\nactually an early version of a mach=\r\nine-oriented declarative markup\nthat I&#39;ve not yet published. I think there =\r\nare a few minor things to\nchange and this could be a clean machine-readable=\r\n media-type for a\nwide range of uses. While the example there is expressed =\r\nin XML, the\ngeneral rules used in that example could easily be translated i=\r\nnto\nother data formats including JSON.\n\nI will also mention that Mike Kelly=\r\n has published an example of a\nmachine-readable media-type (Hal) that is wo=\r\nrth reviewing.\n\n[1] http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/examples/doc.xml\n[2] htt=\r\np://amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/\n[3] http://amundsen.com/blog/archives/=\r\n1041\n[4] http://restafari.blogspot.com/2010/06/please-accept-applicationhal=\r\nxml.html\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nO=\r\nn Tue, Jul 20, 2010 at 12:37, Peter &lt;pkeane@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Eric J.
