The program making the predictions is at a fixed location and\nneeds to know the tool uri (identifying the tool data file) and the\nposted prediction parameters. I assume I have re-interprete the POST\nat server level (in my case apache) -  How do I do that best?\n\nWhat I currently do is POST both the tool uri and the  prediction\nparameters to a cgi script at a fixed uri. That does not seem RESTful\nto me, as the uri used to make predictions is not that of the tool.\n\nAny feedback would be very appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
