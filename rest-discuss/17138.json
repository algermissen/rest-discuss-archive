My problem is about tooling. I haven&#39;t seen anything that \nmakes it easy to go from internal representation to HTML+RDFa and back \nagain. That is why basic XML is so tempting - any development platform can \ndo all the tedious and and error prone transformation work for you.\n\nOne of the reasons for turning to REST is simplicity. By adding layers of \nRDFa onto HTML the API becomes more difficult to consume compared to a \nstraight forward XML format. If I present a REST API to my customers that \nmakes it (a lot) more difficult to consume than a SOAP API then I loose some \nof my selling points.\n\nI am probably wrong though - I do not think Fieldings thesis says anything \nabout being simple, but that certainly is part of the percived goodness of \nREST amongst most people.\n\nSorry for exposing my ignorance here, I am just trying to find an \nimplementation that is both RESTful and easy to implement with the proper \ntools.\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Nathan&quot; &lt;nathan@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;J�rn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Rest Discussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 28, 2010 12:45 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Combining HTML and XML?\n\n\n&gt; J�rn Wildt wrote:\n&gt;&gt; But how would the machine readable HTML look like?
