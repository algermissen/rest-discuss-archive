For\nexample:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Allow(philip, GET, resource1)\n&gt;   Allow(administrators, *, *)\n&gt;   Deny (guests, *, POST)\n&gt;   Deny (*.microsoft.com, *, *)  ;-)\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve always taken the approach that permissions are declarative\nrelationships between information and users. The &#39;users&#39; actually could be\nan individual, a group, etc. I generalize that into &#39;principal&#39;. The actual\nstorage, caching, updating, etc. in an implementation is what makes a\nproduct work in any particular setting. You could bind the permissions to\nthe information, or to the user, or in a third &#39;link table&#39; or whatever. The\nprincipal could be a &#39;role&#39; and these could be a fixed list and hardcoded\ninto the application logic - there are a lot of choices on how to implement\npermissions.\n\nOne interesting aspect is that permissions are relationships between\ninformation and users and they &#39;block&#39; messages coming from many sources to\none target, and subscriptions are also relationships between information and\nusers and they &#39;forward&#39; messages from one source to many targets - and the\nforwarded messages are echoes of the operations that hit the permission\n&#39;block&#39;. There&#39;s something important in there somewhere...  permissions and\nsubscriptions are tangled somehow. These are the four foundations of\napplications I enjoy building - information, users, permissions and\nsubscriptions - and they way you manage messages into or out of this system\nmakes it a holistic system.\n\nMike\n\n"}}
