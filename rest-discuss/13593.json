For example:\n&gt; &gt; * REST-style HTTP: Fully complies with REST style architecture in word\n&gt; &gt; and in deed. No transactions. No pessimistic locks. No pub/sub. Fully\n&gt; &gt; stateless and all the rest. May still use features not widely deployed\n&gt; &gt; on the Web.\n&gt; &gt; * Transitional HTTP: Breaks REST constraints in some way, probably by\n&gt; &gt; breaking statelessness of client/server. Very likely they still fit\n&gt; &gt; the Uniform Interface/Contract constraint but pay relatively little\n&gt; &gt; heed to other constraints. These specifications are designed to fit\n&gt; &gt; with existing enterprise use, to allow that use to continue into the\n&gt; &gt; brave new HTTP world, and to allow enterprises to more easily\n&gt; &gt; transition to REST-style HTTP should they find they wish to do so.\n&gt; &gt; * HTTP Integration: Mappings of HTTP semantics into other contexts to\n&gt; &gt; allow services who don&#39;t natively speak HTTP to utilise a simple\n&gt; &gt; gateway to achieve HTTP integration.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This, IMO, does not mean we should change the name of the site or \n&gt; to coin a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new buzzword.  The goal we are striving for is to be RESTful. REST \n&gt; is our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You understand, of course, that this is a subject that the REST camp\n&gt; &gt; are very touchy about :) Roy has stated his preference many times for\n&gt; &gt; new architectural styles to use their own names and not to try and\n&gt; &gt; reuse or redefine REST. Roy has also worked hard for many years to\n&gt; &gt; avoid REST the architectural style being confused with HTTP or the\n&gt; &gt; Web. Calling this REST-* is akin to renaming web services to SOA-* ;)\n&gt; &gt; The backlash you have already seen here I think is similar to what you\n&gt; &gt; could expect from that renaming.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the long run goal of REST-* is to adhere all the REST \n&gt; constraints, but in the short run it may adhere to LESS than all the \n&gt; constraints, why not change the name to RESTless! Actually, the CEO of \n&gt; service-now.com recently introduced this Malapropism \n&gt; &lt;http://www.cio.com/article/448770/Service_now.com_Starts_Up_SOA&gt;(!):\n&gt;\n&gt;     /I//ts CEO&#39;s vision for Service-now.com for the startup&#39;s\n&gt;     underlying architecture was that the software must be &quot;simple,\n&gt;     approachable, configurable, and easy to integrate&quot; and had to be\n&gt;     as &quot;restless and stateless as possible.&quot;/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (FYI,He corrects himself in the comments to the article.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I think RESTless would be a great name for this effort! How much less \n&gt; than REST the style becomes will be up to those contributing to the \n&gt; effort. Since the name itself conveys that the &quot;style&quot; is a relaxation \n&gt; of some of REST&#39;s constraints, Roy et al should not be too offended \n&gt; since he encourages thoughtful experimentation with the relaxation of \n&gt; REST&#39;s constraints.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
