Since a servlet is blocking, a request makes the thread wait. The proposed solutions look to release threads back into the pool and be made available for other requests not to keep it running for a long time.\n\nHow do you, in a RESTful way and using standard load balancing techniques (i.e. those provided by Apache + Tomcat/Jetty), work requests &quot;asynchronously&quot; so that you can release client connections?\n\n+Adolfo\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
