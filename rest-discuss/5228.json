Most REST discussions recommend using HTTP Auth (RFC\n2617), but this solution isn&#39;t ideal because browsers keep the\nauthorization creditials until the browser is closed.  This rules out\nhaving multiple users on the same machine. \n\nIs there a workaround to this?\n\nOr, how terrible is it if I pass the username and password as part of\nthe URI?  Everything is going over SSL, so it&#39;s not a security concern.\n\nThanks, \n-stan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
