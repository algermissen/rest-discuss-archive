It feels\nlike we loop through this periodically on this\nlist but never resolve it generically.  Here are\nthe questions that should be in the FAQ (I don&#39;t\nknow the answers).\n\n1. How do you create a container?\n  Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?\n  Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,\n   a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?\n\n2. How do we add things to the container?\n  Do we rely on directory structure and just do\n   a PUT /collection/item?\n  Do we POST /collection and get back a 201 CREATED?\n\n3. How do we specify the order of items in a collection?\n  If we do this by POSTing to the collection, how\n  do we disambiguate between an add-to-collection\n  POST and an &quot;order-by&quot; POST.\n\n4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?\n  My answer: DELETE /container\n\n5. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and not\n  its contents?\n  My answer: Make it a container of links (see #4)\n\n6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?\n  My answer: Either iterate through the contents\n  and DELETE individually or DELETE the container\n  and then create it again but then see #1\n\nSome people may want to argue that these choices\nare application specific, but to the extent they\nare, it would be useful to know what the standard\nchoices are.   Part of the point of ReST is to\nreduce the amount of prior knowledge you need to\ninteract with any resource.  Standard patterns for\nthese things would be helpful.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

You can implement what\n&gt; you suggested and test it and I&#39;m sure it will work.
