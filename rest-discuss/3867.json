Its tragic flaw is \n&gt; that it did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface \n&gt; to achieve the value it promised.  To be perfectly clear about the problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the state \n&gt; of a resource into a response to a GET request, a client can have \n&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what the content of that response means; it is simply \n&gt; has bits that can mean anything at all.\n\nYes. but the majority of clients don&#39;t need to know what the content \nmeans (for some definition of means). Adding this to a transfer \nprotocol would be an overconstraint. It&#39;s only now, that the web has \ngrown without formal semantics, that we are in the position to \nwonder about whether we should have a tronger semantics. In some \ncases, such as web services I would say yes, a stronger semantic \nunderpinning is useful. Consider that we&#39;ve hade distributed \ncomputing models with decent semantics for longer that either the \nweb  or REST and they have not been been adopted, not even when they \nare really quite good (such as FIPA).\n\nSo, I see no tragic flaw, just an opportunity :)\n\n\n&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses PUT/POST-ed \n&gt; content to change the state of a resource, a client can have ABSOLUTELY \n&gt; NO IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.\n\nSure. But what exactly is the problem? Maybe premature formalization \nis the root of all evil.\n\n\n&gt; Because Roy&#39;s resources are so abstract, access to them has to be \n&gt; mediated by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.  Allowing clients \n&gt; to interact with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then \n&gt; requires that service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to \n&gt; have essentially arbitrary meanings.\n\nWell yes, but to avoid this each method needs a formal semantics and \neach protocol might well need a model theory. Consider KQML. That \nwas far more formal that HTTP, yet it wasn&#39;t formal enough to stop \ninteroperation problems and inter-agent confusion, and that&#39;s \nwithout any commercial incentive to differentiate.\n\n\n&gt; But resources don&#39;t really need to be so abstract and the meanings of \n&gt; HTTP methods don&#39;t need to be so loose.  Programs don&#39;t actually \n&gt; manipulate &quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;non-virtual objects;&quot; they just manipulate \n&gt; bits.  \n\nI think the kind of programs that result from what you are proposing \nwill manipulate symbols first and foremost. Bits would be an \nimplementation detail.\n\n\n&gt; It would be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply \n&gt; a set of bits whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server \n&gt; and whose meaning is determined entirely by agents which interact with \n&gt; this server.  To say otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful \n&gt; difference in effect between having an agent poll a resource and act \n&gt; when it changes and having a server notify an agent to act whenever a \n&gt; resource is changed or to say that there is a meaningful difference \n&gt; between such an agent residing on the HTTP server itself and such an \n&gt; agent residing on another machine across the Internet and interacting \n&gt; via HTTP.\n\nAfter half a decade, I&#39;ve conluded that the best option regarding \nWeb resources is to say as little as possible about them.\n\n\n&gt; PS Bill, I have heard of speech acts, but I don&#39;t know how they apply here.\n\nEach HTTP method can be understood as a speech act or performative \nused by a client to get a server to do something on their behalf. \nThe server may refuse, comply, be silent, or do something completely \nnonsensical. So even after you model everything down the last \ndegree, you still need two agents to intend to communicate \neffectively (ie something like Grice&#39;s maxims) or the ability to \nadapt to deceitful behaviour (ie utility models).\n\nThere isn&#39;t a direct correspondance, no more that CRUD is a direct \ncorrespondance to the REST uniform interface, but I&#39;ve always \nthought of HTTP methods as a poor man speech acts.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n"}}
