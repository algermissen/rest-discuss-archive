I think that some variati=\r\non on a provisional-final\npattern would fit well into a REST architecture.\n=\r\n\nOne quibble:  2-phase commit does not require resource locking. That&#39;s\nonl=\r\ny the ACID rules, and even then, paraphrasing something I think Roy\nFieldin=\r\ng said on this list, how the resource manager protects its\nresources is its=\r\n own business and others won&#39;t know anyway.\n\n"}}
