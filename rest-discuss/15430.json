Note that\n&gt;&gt; the string can be *anythin=\r\ng* that you want, but you checking the\n&gt;&gt; presence of a linked resource:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Not to get all buzzwordy here, but that sounds like a rule based system.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; You have media type behaviors keyed in to the system, somehow, so, for\n=\r\n&gt; example, you know what &quot;buy a product&quot; means in terms of what data\n&gt; gets=\r\n sent to the &quot;buy now&quot; link, and, of course, that the &quot;#buyNnow&quot;\n&gt; link act=\r\nually MEANS &quot;buy now&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once you have those base behaviors specified, th=\r\nen you can write write\n&gt; rules to react to conditions in pursuit of a goal.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Most folks represent those rules statically, as ordered instructions\n&gt;=\r\n in a program. Vs using some kind of rule system that manages to order\n&gt; th=\r\ne rules based on the state of the application. This &quot;rule soup&quot; is\n&gt; (ideal=\r\nly) self organizing, but you typically have to do some kind of\n&gt; chicanery =\r\nthrough state variables to keep rules from firing to soon,\n&gt; or to order th=\r\ne rules when more than one rule has the potential to\n&gt; fire. That&#39;s just a =\r\ntruth when dealing with any rule system.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the key here, the real=\r\n take away, is the underlying\n&gt; infrastructure of dealing with the resource=\r\ns -- of coding the media\n&gt; type and the actions as generic procedures. Whet=\r\nher you use a rule\n&gt; system to infer your workflow or explicitly lay it out=\r\n using code, the\n&gt; underlying relationships coded to the media types are th=\r\ne same.\n&gt;\n&gt; Making that underlying infrastructure, the translating of the m=\r\nedia\n&gt; types and supported operations in to code easier to create would be =\r\na\n&gt; real boon. Such as doing a GET from #itemList, a GET that\n&gt; automatical=\r\nly redirects if it has too. That alone would add a lot of\n&gt; robustness to c=\r\nlient code.\n&gt;\n&gt; For most code, IMHO, having to use a rule engine for logic =\r\nis simply\n&gt; overkill. Sure it can be more flexible, and resistant to change=\r\n, but\n&gt; one issue with that is that the rules were written given basic\n&gt; as=\r\nsumptions. And the premise is that those assumptions won&#39;t change,\n&gt; even i=\r\nf other premises are made on the hosting server. But,\n&gt; historically, many =\r\na system has overloaded an older concept using the\n&gt; same identifiers with =\r\na new concept. And whatever assumption your rule\n&gt; system made upon that co=\r\nncept are now mistaken because it was never\n&gt; told about the new assumption=\r\ns associated with the same identifier as\n&gt; published by the server system.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Simple example is that the server could have changed the data type for\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;buy now&quot; but not changed either the actual schema version (i.e. it&#39;s\n&gt; s=\r\ntill in http://example.com/buynow.xsd, say, just a different\n&gt; buynow.xsd t=\r\nhan the rules were developed for) or the operation (with\n&gt; is still a relat=\r\nion tagged &quot;buyNow&quot;). At a high level this looks the\n&gt; same to your rule sy=\r\nstem, but in truth it could have changed &quot;beneath\n&gt; the feet&quot; of the rule s=\r\nystem, and the once &quot;more robust&quot; rule system\n&gt; is in truth no better than =\r\na hardcoded system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Computers have yet to do well when the creators lie=\r\n to them :). And we\n&gt; creators don&#39;t lie out of malice, simply laziness.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; A rule system is a good idea, I&#39;m just pointing out that there can be\n&gt; a=\r\n lot of issues with one.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
