But why not go the full way?\nWhy not give the client a URL too?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the client-server notion is always a constraint of RESTful\n&gt; services. The server exposes services using URL&#39;s, but the client may\n&gt; not have URL&#39;s.\n\noh, we can fix that. your clients physical possessions may not be on\nthe network, but it doesnt mean they cant have URLs -its just the act\nof talking to the devices themselves that has p\n\n&gt; The request-response MEP is also a constraint for\n&gt; messaging.\n\nConsider Polling. Scales surprisingly well where the request is a GET\nor a HEAD with a etag or if-modified-since, and the endpoint remembers\nto set the expiry time in all responses. Most importantly, it ignores\nfirewalls.\n\nif you rely on Async messaging based protocols then to get through\nfirewalls you either need\n -a relay (e.g. SMTP relays) that provides a structured hole in the firewall\n -public proxy services (E.g. XMPP servers)\nThese are both nice in that they also decouple routing; roaming and\nsometimes offline recipients can still get content. There&#39;s nothing to\nstop you running REST over XMPP, incidentally.\n\nWhen you compare to WS-* messaging, you have WS-Events., WS-Eventing\nand WS-Notification. All of these host a web server on the local\nsystem, to await responses. They don&#39;t go through firewalls and even\nthough WS-Notification drafts always promised that such was possible\n(through the miracle that is WS-A). Certainly I&#39;ve never seen one, and\nI&#39;m the author of one of the few WS-N impls out there. As a result the\nonly way to  interop test my impl against others was to run the tests\non a home server, with a public endpoint for responses. How did I get\nthe results from these test runs back to my office desktop? Atom feed\nof test results -which I can&#39;t help find deeply ironic.\n\nNB, I never fully criticised WS-A in my first posting, here goes\n -tests were only written after the spec went into last call; too late\nfor hard-to-test features to be removed.\n -multiple draft versions out in the field; WS-DM 1.0 actually depends\non two different non-final drafts.\n -nothing in the specs to deal with incoming messages with addresses\nin different versions\n -few/no public EPRs for interop testing (WSO2 are proposing some)\n -outstanding security issues as flagged by Oracle/sun/sonic and others:\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-addressing/2005May/0028.html\n\nthe latter implies I could post a request with a fault to address that\nwould cause the endpoint to post a fault back to the specified\naddress, with the SOAP headers of my choice. That could be, well,\ntroublesome.\n\n-steve\n-steve\n\n"}}
