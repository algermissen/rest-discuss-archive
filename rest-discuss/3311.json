Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I like your version of the format quite a lot.\n&gt; The only thing I&#39;d like to see in it that is\n&gt; missing is some way of finding out what\n&gt; content-types are available via\n&gt; content-negotiation.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that&#39;s necessary, though.  A client should submit to the server\nthe list of content-types that it understands (i.e. &quot;Accept&quot; header) and the\nserver should choose from that list or return an appropriate error response.\nWhat value would it be for a client to get back a list of content-types that\nit didn&#39;t understand?\n\nFurther, I should point out that the format I suggest does allow a server to\nreturn something like:\n\nGET accept: text/html, text/*, */*\nGET accept-encoding: compress, gzip\n\nBasically, just about any request header could be specified.  The example in\nmy original post were just a sampling for demonstration and not the complete\nlist of possibilities.\n\n&gt; Regarding the options header on GET, I like that\n&gt; as a concept, but the practice makes me nervous.\n&gt; I&#39;d like to avoid a proliferation of file formats\n&gt; for this sort of thing.\n\nI don&#39;t understand your concern here.  As it is OPTIONS is woefully\nunderutilized.  It makes sense that in this emerging world of new metadata\nconstructs, esp. wrt web services, the OPTIONS feature could fit the bill\nnicely (at least for some uses).  Regardless of the suggested header, anyone\ncould return any response-entity of any content-type for OPTIONS right now.\nThere is no way we can avoid that.  What the header does is allow a resource\nto indicate that metadata is available via OPTIONS in certain formats.  This\nis more an ability to actively inform the client of OPTIONS abilities than\nit is a method of proliferating multiple content-types when using OPTIONS.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
