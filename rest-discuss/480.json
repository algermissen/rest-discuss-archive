Then the client uses some WebDAV/DeltaV magic to get a diff\n&gt; from the version it has to the version the server has.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the idea of idempotent notifications because it means that the\n&gt; listener could go off the network for seven hours and get &quot;back in sync&quot;\n&gt; on the very first notification it gets, or even before it gets a\n&gt; notification. So for instance if we were in a chat session and I get cut\n&gt; off then my chat client could miss a bunch change notifications but sync\n&gt; up whenever it wanted to. Loose coupling.\n\nSure, but you&#39;re placing an obligation on the server and the network\nto ensure that the notification arrives in order to go do your\n&quot;catching up&quot;.  That&#39;s quite a burden.\n\nAn alternative would be that the client requests a resynch when it\ncomes back online.  This would be done with a GET.  Part of the\nrequest could include the last message id retrieved, and the\nserver could then send all messages on the GET response that\nwould get the client up to date.\n\n&gt; So I would say that if an &quot;event&quot; is important enough that a client\n&gt; wants to know WHAT changed, not just WHEN it changed then the event\n&gt; should be reified in the server as a resource and persist for some\n&gt; number of hours or days, unless deleted.\n\nHow&#39;s that networking adage go?  &quot;Send as much as you can, as soon as\nyou can&quot;.\n\n&gt; As an *optimization*, it may make sense to have message bodies with\n&gt; &quot;diffs&quot;. But if you detected that you had missed one it would be no big\n&gt; deal because you could just sync up.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; Can you describe an application that is better modeled with\n&gt; non-idempotent notifications?\n\nAll of them? 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
