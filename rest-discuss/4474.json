The original suggestion of /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson is an\n&gt; &gt; unvalidated URI manufactured by an external user-agent also. The\n&gt; &gt; &quot;?&quot; doesn&#39;t make it special.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well IMHO it does. At least as far as the design I am proposing.\n&gt; The question mark makes it a query. The query is directed to a URI\n&gt; that expects name/value pairs to be appended to it&#39;s URI by the\n&gt; User Agent. This is very HTML-forms-ish.\n\nAlthough it&#39;s a common approach on servers to route requests to a request\nhandler based on the path portion only, the definition of URI encompasses\nall the text, not just the stuff before the &quot;?&quot;.\nI wouldn&#39;t suggest changing your approach at all, but just wanted to make\nsure you understood the HTTP spec.\n\n&gt; The question mark makes it a query.\nActually, the GET request method makes it a query from the client&#39;s point of\nview.\n\nA client could PUT, POST or DELETE to /artist?name=Lisa%20Simpson just as\neasily as to /artist/LisaSimpson with no observable difference because the\nURI should be treated as being opaque. But I&#39;m probably beating a dead horse\n& I&#39;ll shut up now.\n\n\n"}}
