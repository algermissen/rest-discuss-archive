And the\n&gt;&gt; second. And parts of=\r\n the others too...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, and I didn&#39;t want to say this because its=\r\n going to piss people\n&gt;&gt; here and it is not that my intention, and also bec=\r\nause it&#39;s just my feeling\n&gt;&gt; and I dont have evidence to support it, I susp=\r\nect that it was this &quot;purist&quot;\n&gt;&gt; approach that drove all those auto-denomit=\r\nade REST frameworks to simply\n&gt;&gt; ignore the fundamentals and go with the RE=\r\nST moniker all the same. Because\n&gt;&gt; if what the experts only say is &quot;if you=\r\n don&#39;t apply this then its no REST&quot;\n&gt;&gt; without a sound explanation of the w=\r\nhy&#39;s, they probaly follow the easy path\n&gt;&gt; of applyng what they can, leave =\r\nthe rest, and still call it REST because of\n&gt;&gt; market reasons.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now if=\r\n the experts instead of just repeating that, could come with a\n&gt;&gt; sensible =\r\nexplanation of what each constraint gives, and most important, what\n&gt;&gt; the =\r\nsystem looses for each constraint dropped or relaxed - instead of\n&gt;&gt; immedi=\r\natly say &quot;its not REST, call it other thing&quot; - maybe a effort of\n&gt;&gt; classif=\r\nication like the one &quot;Type I, Type II...&quot; (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m on my\n&gt;&gt; mobile, i=\r\ns hard to google for it) would be generalized enough as to be\n&gt;&gt; accepted b=\r\ny the industry, and we could have a REST Maturity Model (I think\n&gt;&gt; it was =\r\nthat&#39;s called) that inequivocly said that REST Type I is not fully\n&gt;&gt; REST =\r\nbecause misses constraint A,B,C and REST Type II misses constraint X,\n&gt;&gt; an=\r\nd REST Type V, or whatever, does indeed follow all the constraints and\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhus indeed complies with Roy thesis.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And if that was recognalizable a=\r\nnd accepted by the industry maybe\n&gt;&gt; companies will had the honesty of expl=\r\nicitly call their applications to\n&gt;&gt; conform with REST Type I, where everib=\r\nody knew a priori what that means. And\n&gt;&gt; they still have the marketing buz=\r\nzword...  They could even leverage that\n&gt;&gt; marketing tool - mine is more Re=\r\nstfull then yours - or present thenselves as\n&gt;&gt; the good guys - our applica=\r\ntion is REST Type II but we aim to turn it fully\n&gt;&gt; REST in the next months=\r\n and the upgrade will be only a small fee...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Instead, what do we have=\r\n? Confusion!!! Companies claiming its REST,\n&gt;&gt; experts claiming its no, com=\r\npanies not giving a crap to what the experts\n&gt;&gt; say... All this because the=\r\n all-or-nothing, don&#39;t call it REST attitude of\n&gt;&gt; the experts...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don=\r\n&#39;t get me wrong, I do care about REST, I do appreciate the experts, and\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nwhat I&#39;m saying does not have the single purpose of pissing them off as the=\r\ny\n&gt;&gt; probably think it is. I just think more flexibility and clarity or\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ntransparencie will be good for everyone...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But the truth is, it seems=\r\n I&#39;m already hearing, I don&#39;t have years of\n&gt;&gt; rest, I&#39;m trying to redefine=\r\n rest, I&#39;m not willing to learn from what the\n&gt;&gt; experts say, I&#39;m just crit=\r\nicising people who knows what they&#39;re talking\n&gt;&gt; about, I&#39;m not paying my r=\r\nespects to the experts...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But its not, I care, I really care :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n On 20 Jul 2010 23:11, &quot;Will Hartung&quot; &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I =\r\nhear you Antonio.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But a core tenet (IMHO, not being one who &quot;knows wh=\r\nat he&#39;s talking about&quot;)\n&gt;&gt; of REST is the limitations and constraints impos=\r\ned by it, and what, by\n&gt;&gt; assuming those constraints, the system enables yo=\r\nu to do.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s important, perhaps less now than in the past, to keep R=\r\nEST &quot;pure&quot; for\n&gt;&gt; a reason. REST has been horribly muddied. Most feel that =\r\nit&#39;s nothing more\n&gt;&gt; than POX over HTTP, as witnessed by the myriad of &quot;RES=\r\nT&quot; apis that have been\n&gt;&gt; published, but really aren&#39;t.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, the adher=\r\nents have been quite vocal, rightly I think, to try and keep\n&gt;&gt; the term &quot;R=\r\nEST&quot; meaningful, and not lost.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST is not like pornography, in that =\r\n&quot;we know it when we see it&quot;, but\n&gt;&gt; otherwise can&#39;t describe it in detail. =\r\nIt has been described in detail. And\n&gt;&gt; the only way to measure its effecti=\r\nveness, specifically, IMHO, in B2B\n&gt;&gt; systems doing M2M transactions (i.e. =\r\nnot just &quot;browsers&quot; and &quot;the web&quot;), is\n&gt;&gt; to see it practiced as described.=\r\n That&#39;s the only way we can find out if\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s actually usable and useful =\r\n(in that domain).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So constraints are important, and calling out when =\r\ndiscussion drifts from\n&gt;&gt; those constraints is also important. Otherwise, r=\r\neally, it&#39;s just Stuff over\n&gt;&gt; HTTP. And I don&#39;t think we need a dedicated =\r\nlist just for that.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And finally, most here will be the first to admit=\r\n that REST is not the\n&gt;&gt; only architecture, nor should it be the only archi=\r\ntecture. Another reason to\n&gt;&gt; try and &quot;stay pure&quot; with the notions of REST.=\r\n If what is needed for a\n&gt;&gt; specific system does not &quot;work&quot; with the REST i=\r\ndiom, then by all means,\n&gt;&gt; finish your system, but simply don&#39;t call it RE=\r\nST.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt;&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--001485e0b4962165c0048be33dfd\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nYes, I was trying to refer to [1] and [2], and I also had read your [3] bef=\r\nore.

And the seco=\r\nnd. And parts of the others too...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, and I didn&#39;t want to=\r\n say this because its going to piss people here and it is not that my inten=\r\ntion, and also because it&#39;s just my feeling and I dont have evidence to=\r\n support it, I suspect that it was this &quot;purist&quot; approach that dr=\r\nove all those auto-denomitade REST frameworks to simply ignore the fundamen=\r\ntals and go with the REST moniker all the same. Because if what the experts=\r\n only say is &quot;if you don&#39;t apply this then its no REST&quot; witho=\r\nut a sound explanation of the why&#39;s, they probaly follow the easy path =\r\nof applyng what they can, leave the rest, and still call it REST because of=\r\n market reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if the experts instead of just repeating th=\r\nat, could come with a sensible explanation of what each constraint gives, a=\r\nnd most important, what the system looses for each constraint dropped or re=\r\nlaxed - instead of immediatly say &quot;its not REST, call it other thing&q=\r\nuot; - maybe a effort of classification like the one &quot;Type I, Type II.=\r\n..&quot; (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m on my mobile, is hard to google for it) wou=\r\nld be generalized enough as to be accepted by the industry, and we could ha=\r\nve a REST Maturity Model (I think it was that&#39;s called) that inequivocl=\r\ny said that REST Type I is not fully REST because misses constraint A,B,C a=\r\nnd REST Type II misses constraint X, and REST Type V, or whatever, does ind=\r\need follow all the constraints and thus indeed complies with Roy thesis.&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if that was recognalizable and accepted by the industry maybe =\r\ncompanies will had the honesty of explicitly call their applications to con=\r\nform with REST Type I, where everibody knew a priori what that means. And t=\r\nhey still have the marketing buzzword...=A0 They could even leverage that m=\r\narketing tool - mine is more Restfull then yours - or present thenselves as=\r\n the good guys - our application is REST Type II but we aim to turn it full=\r\ny REST in the next months and the upgrade will be only a small fee...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, what do we have? Confusion!!! Companies claiming its REST, e=\r\nxperts claiming its no, companies not giving a crap to what the experts say=\r\n... All this because the all-or-nothing, don&#39;t call it REST attitude of=\r\n the experts...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do care about REST, I =\r\ndo appreciate the experts, and what I&#39;m saying does not have the single=\r\n purpose of pissing them off as they probably think it is. I just think mor=\r\ne flexibility and clarity or transparencie will be good for everyone...&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, it seems I&#39;m already hearing, I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne years of rest, I&#39;m trying to redefine rest, I&#39;m not willing to le=\r\narn from what the=A0 experts say, I&#39;m just criticising people who knows=\r\n what they&#39;re talking about, I&#39;m not paying my respects to the expe=\r\nrts...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But its not, I care, I really care :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote type=\r\n=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;On 20 Jul 2010 23:11, &quot;Will Hartung&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:willh@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;willh@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear you Antonio.=A0&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But a core tenet (IMHO,=\r\n not being one who &quot;knows what he&#39;s talking about&quot;) of REST i=\r\ns the limitations and constraints imposed by it, and what, by assuming thos=\r\ne constraints, the system enables you to do.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nIt&#39;s important, perhaps less now than in the past, to keep REST &quot;p=\r\nure&quot; for a reason. REST has been horribly muddied. Most feel that it&#=\r\n39;s nothing more than POX over HTTP, as witnessed by the myriad of &quot;R=\r\nEST&quot; apis that have been published, but really aren&#39;t.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, the adherents have been quite vocal, rightly I think=\r\n, to try and keep the term &quot;REST&quot; meaningful, and not lost.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;REST is not like pornography, in that &quot;we know it =\r\nwhen we see it&quot;, but otherwise can&#39;t describe it in detail. It has=\r\n been described in detail. And the only way to measure its effectiveness, s=\r\npecifically, IMHO, in B2B systems doing M2M transactions (i.e. not just &qu=\r\not;browsers&quot; and &quot;the web&quot;), is to see it practiced as descr=\r\nibed. That&#39;s the only way we can find out if it&#39;s actually usable a=\r\nnd useful (in that domain).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So constraints ar=\r\ne important, and calling out when discussion drifts from those constraints =\r\nis also important. Otherwise, really, it&#39;s just Stuff over HTTP. And I =\r\ndon&#39;t think we need a dedicated list just for that.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And finally, most here will be the first to admit that REST is n=\r\not the only architecture, nor should it be the only architecture. Another r=\r\neason to try and &quot;stay pure&quot; with the notions of REST. If what is=\r\n needed for a specific system does not &quot;work&quot; with the REST idiom=\r\n, then by all means, finish your system, but simply don&#39;t call it REST.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Hartung&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;(&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:willh@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;willh@mirthcorp=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001485e0b4962165c0048be33dfd--\r\n\n"}}
