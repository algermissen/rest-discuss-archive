You can&#39;t &quot;write\nagainst\na URI&quot;.  You can transfer a representation to a resource behind a name.  The\ngreat thing about resource modeling is the way it parallels people\nmanagement!\nI can give you a hint, but I can&#39;t tell you what to do.\n\nBut if the URI are authoritatively equivalent, then you are addressing the\nsame resource no matter which URI you pick for a given request.  If you\nonly care about which resource you are addressing, then that should answer\nyour question.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
