What does your\n&quot;user&quot; (doesn&#39;t=\r\n have to be human) need to &quot;understand&quot; (in the\nsimplest sense) in order to=\r\n evaluate the alternatives provided\nand submit the appropriate data or sele=\r\nct the appropriate links\nto get it to the next state, and how does the prov=\r\nider of that\nrepresentation express such ideas without natural language?\n\nX=\r\nML is not an answer here -- it could be some application of\nXML which adds =\r\nthe necessary semantics, but just having angle\nbrackets is not enough.
