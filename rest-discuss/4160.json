What this means is that, even if the \nclient lost the original transaction resource&#39;s URI, any action \nperformed on a related resource would give it back again, effectively \nallowing the resource URI to stay fairly opaque.\n\n&gt;Also, any relative URIs inside the representations of those various\n&gt;resources may be thrown off; the server would have to introspect\n&gt;the representations it&#39;s returning and munge any URIs therein\n&gt;itself, and the client would have to be disciplined about only\n&gt;following URIs returned from the server (or built according to\n&gt;rules returned from the server, as for an HTML form submission),\n&gt;and emphatically not constructing URIs itself -- but then that&#39;s\n&gt;just good REST sense, anyway.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think absolute URIs and relative URIs with absolute paths would be the \nproblem.  Relative URIs with relative paths would not be a problem as \nlong as all related resources were accessible from within the \ntransaction.  In other words, until such time as a resource was updated \n(but not committed), doing a GET on &quot;/path/resource&quot; would return no \ndifferent a response than a GET on &quot;/t/123/path/resource&quot; (except for \nthe additional header mentioned above).
