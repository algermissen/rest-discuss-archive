I therefore took this to mean\nthat any other conditional header has no effect when the resource is\nmissing.\n\nThis is simply my interpretation, of course, and would like to hear\nthe opinions of others. If an alternative interpretation gathers a\nconsensus then I will amend the diagram.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\n\nOn 2/1/07, Thierry Boileau &lt;thboileau@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello Alan,\n&gt;\n&gt; First, I have to thank you for your great effort providing this so\n&gt; comprehensive activity diagram. This is really great!\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I have one question about the case where no resource is found,\n&gt; but an &quot;If-match&quot; header has been provided.\n&gt; If I understand your diagram, you expect a 412 status [precondition\n&gt; failed] when no resource exists and if and only if the &quot;If-match&quot;\n&gt; header&#39;s value equals to &quot;*&quot;.\n&gt; I was not sure myself, therefore I&#39;ve checked the HTTP RFC (which is not\n&gt; really clear), and finally posted a mail to the &quot;REST discuss&quot; yahoo groups.\n&gt; It seems that the test is : when no resource exists and if an &quot;If-match&quot;\n&gt; header has been provided (not only &quot;*&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; What are you tinking about?\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Thierry Boileau\n\n"}}
