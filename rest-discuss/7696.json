Probably I&#39;ll use rel tags/URI templates and a \n &gt; howto page to document that you can get at representations in multiple \n &gt; forms.\n\nCan you elaborate on this a bit or point me to a resource that does? I\nassume you mean that the HTML representation will inlude &lt;link&gt;s to\nalternate stuff? I wish browsers exposed that stuff a bit more.\n\n &gt; I know there&#39;s conneg at the HTTP level, but it seems to have miserably, \n &gt; utterly, and completely failed* on the web.\n\nIt&#39;s failed on the people web, but seems to work pretty well for little\nclient to little (or big) servers. AJAX requests for JSON\nrepresentations and the like, command line tools that pull editable\nrepresentations to vim, whatever.\n\nWhen we built the Socialtext REST (sic?) API [1] we debated for quite a\nwhile about content-negotation. Initially I wanted the &quot;user&#39;s web front\nend&quot; to use the same URLs as &quot;api&#39;s front end&quot; and figured something\nlike what you describe would be useful. Compromise eventually settled us\non an api front end that gets used by the interface and we declared\n(very simple) content negotation the way to go, as code was always\ngoing to be there to set the Accept header.\n\nThis of course turned out to be only sort of true. Code is written by\npeople who like to go exploring with their browsers. Library code is\nsometimes written by people who don&#39;t know about the Accept header.\n\nSo now there is an ?accept=&lt;type&gt; parameter accepted by most\nrepresentations. I wonder if it would also be useful to implement\n.&lt;filetype extension&gt;?\n\n\n[1]\nhttps://www.socialtext.net/st-rest-docs/index.cgi?socialtext_rest_documentation\n-- \nChris Dent                      http://burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt\n                              [...]\n\n"}}
