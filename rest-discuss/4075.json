The change in state of the &quot;user&quot; resource is\naccomplished with a POST.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nhttp://foo.com/page/edit/1\nhttp://foo.com/page/delete/1\n\nare representations of the &quot;page with id 1&quot; resource. Is this the right way to\nlook at this??\n\nAll changes in the state of that resource are accomplished with a &lt;FORM\naction=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; for example, saving after you have edited the contents of &quot;page\nwith id 1&quot; or committing a delete of &quot;page with id 1&quot;.\n\n\nIn most web application the logout action is accomplished through a URI which\nlooks something like this:\n\nhttp://foo.com/user/logout\n\nThis URI has the side effect of &quot;logging out&quot; the user and therefore it is\ninconsistent with my assumptions of REST.\n\nHow can this be accomplished so that it makes sense in the current Web\nApplications scenario where users are used to logging out using a URI as\nopposed to a &lt;FORM action=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;?\n\nIt seems that most of the so called webs scripting languages make it look like\nPOST is just a non-transparent way of changing the state of a resource as\nopposed to the transparent GET. So developers tend to use the two\ninterchangeably!\n\nThanks! :)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
