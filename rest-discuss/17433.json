If you don&#39;t like it,\n&gt;&gt; choose a different method.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Which non-safe idempotent method is that?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;However, there is no guarantee that such a state\n&gt;&gt;&gt; change will be observable&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the point in making something that&#39;s non-observable by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; definition visible in the system?\n&gt;&gt; What is the point in building network-based systems, where\n&gt;&gt; such guarantees are impossible?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Not a lot, but let&#39;s be clear; we&#39;re discussing one specific guarantee\n&gt; relating to the &#39;fullness&#39; of a PUT representation - a property that&#39;s\n&gt; apparently impossible to observe on the network anyway, by its very\n&gt; definition. At least that&#39;s what I took by &quot;no guarantee&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; So; if the fullness of a PUT representation is not observable, then\n&gt; what was the benefit of creating that restrictive definition? What\n&gt; infrastructure on the web is actually taking advantage of, or relying\n&gt; on, the fullness of PUT representations?\n\n&quot;no guarantee that such a state change will be observable&quot; is *very* \ndifferent to &quot;impossible to observe&quot;.\n\nThe specification characterizes each method, requires the bare minimum \nto be an effective transfer protocol, and tries not to limit usage. I \npersonally find it quite clear.\n\nCan you think of a good reason why the specification would have to say \n&quot;MUST guarantee that a state change is observable&quot;? Is it to fit in with \nthe notion that a resource has a state indicated by it&#39;s \nrepresentations? a detail which would of course be hidden by the uniform \ninterface. Would every now-valid usage and implementation of HTTP still \nbe valid if that were a MUST?\n\n\n\n"}}
