SOAP Routing\nallows a message to be directed hop by hop from one machine to another.\nRohit Khare has made the case that this is a new mechanism for\nassembling software. Given an existing service you can add encryption,\nor logging or reliable delivery or whatever by routing it.\n\nOne way to do this in HTTP is to POST an HTTP message which has as its\nrepresentation another HTTP message. This feels like it would work but\nit also feels like tunnelling HTTP over HTTP. It isn&#39;t entirely\ncomfortable to me that I might have to POST a GET.\n\nYou can do all of this at the application level, and in fact this has\nbeen done many times. For instance I can encrypt a GET by doing this:\n\nhttp://www.encryptionservice.com/GET=http://www.someotheruri.com\n\nAnd I could then add a translation service like this:\n\nhttp://www.encryptionservice.com/GET=http://www.translate.com/GET=http://www.sometotheruri.com\n\n(assume proper levels of escaping)\n\nBut is it really right to do it all at the application level?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
