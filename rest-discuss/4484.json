Not only can you have two URIs for the same resource,\nyou can&#39;t stop me creating a URI for it too.\n\n&gt; - usually, several representations returned for multiple requests to a\n&gt; single\n&gt;   resource are understood to be mutually exclusive, but in the case described\n&gt; in\n&gt;   (2), the various representations are *combined* to form another one.\n&gt;   Is this RESTful?\n\nThis is what you do in your own head when you read 2 webpages on the same topic\nand combine the knowledge gained.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\nï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
