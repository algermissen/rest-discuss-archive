Or was the thought that\npreferences (per representation changes based on personal choices) breaks\ncaching anyway?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; No matter what device you were using, you would point the site at your\n&gt; consistent preferences-URI.\nThe same URI for each device? This is what I would like, but in practice\nthat doesn&#39;t happen all that often.\n\n&gt; The browser would (at your _request_) send\n&gt; the information to remote servers. Servers would _ask you_ for read\n&gt; and/or write permission to your preferences-URI and the information\n&gt; stored there would tend to be open, textual and in many cases defined\n&gt; independent of any particular application. If you &quot;publish&quot; your\n&gt; favourite sports team, it should be provided to all services _and all of\n&gt; your devices_ unless you specifically override it for some particular\n&gt; application or device.\nWasn&#39;t there several attempts at this &#39;shared preferences&#39; approach? I can&#39;t\nfind any references right now...\n\n"}}
