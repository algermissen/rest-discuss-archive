It&#39;s okay for HTTP to diverge but if the spec doesn&#39;t say clearly \none way or another, then people will just guess. HTTP says basically \n&quot;DELETE means you should delete.&quot;\n\nRoy describes a very mathematical mode for HTTP (resource is a mapping \netc.) and if the HTTP methods were described in those terms it would be \nmuch easier to build interoperable software.\n\nThere are hints that it was politics that prevented this from happening \nthe first time around, but what should we do about it now? Just transmit \nthe true meanings of the methods through mailing lists? Increment HTTP? \nWrite an RFC clarifying? Wait for Roy&#39;s new protocol? I&#39;m being serious \nhere: I think that there is a problem and a variety of solutions and am \nsoliciting opinions on both issues.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
