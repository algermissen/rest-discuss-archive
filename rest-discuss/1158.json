If you want to discuss REST then I think a mailing\nlist is a more productive way to do it. We could make a whole new one if\nyou want an &quot;even ground&quot; or &quot;decentralization&quot; might be an interesting\nplace. So I won&#39;t go through point by point and just try to re-emphasize\nthe central point of my article.\n\nYes, I exaggerated the seriousness of Google&#39;s crime because I&#39;m trying\nto motivate action rather than just dryly analyze. But Google&#39;s &quot;crime&quot;\nis that they deprived the Web of approximately a billion useful XML\nURIs. We could have used those URIs in XInclude, XSLT, XPath, XPointer,\nRDF. And of course we could ALSO have used them in Java, Perl, Python,\nC#, Ruby, ...\n\nURIs are declarative, like SQL. You type them in and declarative data\ncomes back. Just as you can type SQL in a little one-line window and get\nback records, you can type a URI in a little one-line window and get\nback representations of resources. Just as you can integrate tables\nusing joins, you integrate XML/URI-based web services using XInclude and\nRDF.\n\nBefore the relational model (and query language) was widely circulated,\nthe whole concept would have seemed ridiculous to database programmers.\nYou could just use the &quot;API&quot; (surely not the terminology they used back\nthen, but...). You want to integrate two tables...you write some code\nthat iterates over one and the other and correlates them. As long as you\nlike coding glue, and don&#39;t care about scalability, this is a great\nsystem! It took years for people to understand the subtle benefits of a\nsystem that is consistent but also very restrictive.\n\nThat&#39;s where we are today, with Web Services and REST. Precisely because\nthe issues are subtle, we have to yell loud to be heard. \n\nIn particular, the fundamental benefit of publishing through URIs is\ninteroperability:\n\n * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0286.html\n * http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/06/rest.html\n\nUntil there is more than one useful web service on the Internet, it&#39;s\nreally hard to demonstrate interoperability advantages...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
