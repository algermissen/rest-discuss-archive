Do you\n&gt; &gt; still see multiple interpretations?\n&gt; \n&gt; We might be able to construct an example where there&#39;s only one\n&gt; interpretation of a POST example, but that doesn&#39;t suggest that this\n&gt; is a good general solution.  It would require rethinking how schemas\n&gt; are designed.  For example, you wouldn&#39;t want to use &quot;name&quot; elements\n&gt; in multiple places, you&#39;d have to use &quot;purchaserName&quot; and \n&gt; &quot;shipToName&quot;,\n&gt; etc.. rather than using a &quot;purchaser&quot; element which includes a &quot;name&quot;\n&gt; element.  That&#39;s quite a burden to place on schema designers.\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO, the best approach is to separate the concerns of specifying the\n&gt; valid state of resources (XML schema, RDF, etc..), from the ways in\n&gt; which the state is manipulated.\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\n&gt; Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\n&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n&gt; \n\n"}}
