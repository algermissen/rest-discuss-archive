I hope that this email\nwill answer that question.  I also hope that this will either prove or\ndisprove that I understand what Roy Fielding said in the last email to this\ngroup.\n\nYes, you can create a system that can follow *arbitrary *XML or HTML links.\nHowever, REST APIs are being used to build other systems.  Those system\nrequire *specific functionality* from the API at *specific *points in the\ninteraction (a.k.a.the client workspace).  I haven&#39;t seen a working &quot;REST\nAPI&quot; that provides a method to derive ALL of the URLs for that timely\nspecific functionality based on a single entry point.\n\nI&#39;m going to give an example of this with a non-existant, theoretical REST\nAPI from a company called Metflix (not to be confused with any other APIs,\nfor legal reasons).\n\n(Bear with me here, it&#39;s going to take some time to get to the punch line.)\n\nMetflix is a website that has all movies that relate to the Mets football\nfranchise (which of course does not exist, and has no relation to any\ncompany what-so-ever).  You can:\n\n   - login (metflix.com/login),\n   - manage your Queue of Mets movies (/myqueue, as a starting point plus\n   management functionality),\n   - view a list of the latest movies (/movies/),\n   - view information about a Mets movie (/movies/{id}),\n   - search for Mets movies (/search?term={searchTerm}).\n\nOf course there are plenty of other whiz-bang features, but we can limit our\ndiscussion to those :).\n\nThe Metflix website got so successful, that it created a RESTful API so that\nother applications can be built around its services.  The URLS of the\nservice just happen to have the same URLs as the site, but are prefixed by\n&#39;/api&#39;.\n\nI want to build a fancy Flash UI client for that service, that basically\nexposes the same services, but just looks much nicer (Note: their affiliate\nprogram is fantastic... I&#39;ll make a ton of money that way).\n\nMy Flash app requires the user to login, then he or she can manage the\nqueue, search for Mets movies, and consequently view details about movies\nfrom either the queue or the search results.\n\nMy fancy Flash client will POST to &#39;metflix.com/api/login&#39;, and get a 200\nstatus code and an auth token.  Then it will show your queue, (which as you\nremember, is found at &#39;/api/myqueue&#39; and of course the auth token has to be\nused here) in one panel, which has links to the individual movies in the\nqueue, and another panel will show you latest movies (which as you remember\nis found at &#39;/api/movies&#39;) which also has links to movies.  There&#39;s also a\nsearch box that performs a GET to (&#39;/search?term=&#39; + searchbox.text).\n\n(I almost got to the punchline... wait for it)\n\nThe process of linking to invidual movies from the queue, the movie list and\nsearch results is RESTful.  You GET a list of movies (name + link) back, and\ncan click on those links to &quot;transition state&quot; to view the movie details.\n\nThe problem is that for the sake of my specific requirements, I hardcoded\nthe URLs for the queue, the current movie list and the search box.  I didn&#39;t\n&quot;discover&quot; those URLs based on the result of my login request (which happens\nto be my bookmark and entry point to the system).  Notice that I also\nhard-coded the query parameter that needs to be used for my search term.\n\nBased on my (clearly limited) understanding of REST, all of that hardcoding\nof URLs in my Flash UI, which is a client of the Metflix.com, is a violation\nof the HATEOAS/hyptertext constraint.  Based on my (personal, limited)\nobservation, there are no RESTful APIs that implement the hypertext\nconstraint any better.\n\nEven if I did get back URLs, my Flash would still need to find the *current\nvalue *of *a specific URL *for a specific task (like the URL for the &#39;list\nof current movies&#39;, the URL for the &#39;movies in my queue&#39; and the URL and the\nname of the query param of the search form).  The Metflix API needs to\nsomehow provide my client with a set of URLs that I need for my next\npotential logical tasks (my &quot;workspace,&quot; if I understandy Roy Fielding\ncorrectly).  It also needs to assign a means of of identifying how those\nURLs map to a specific functionality that&#39;s different from the URLs\nthemselves.  For example It&#39;s not proper to expect the client to know what\n&#39;/api/movies&#39; is.  The server needs to provide another piece of\nwell-understood information from which my Flash UI can *interpret *that the\nmeaning of the &#39;/api/movies&#39; link is &#39;the current list of movies.&#39;\n\nWebsites, unlike REST APIs, do have a clever method of link\nidentification... It&#39;s the natural language found between and around the &#39;&lt;a\nhref=&quot;..&quot;&gt;&#39; and the &#39;&lt;/a&gt;&#39; tags.  There&#39;s an &quot;interpretation engine&quot; that\ncan understand that natural language, and discover the features of the\npages, with the help of a User Agent (such as a web browser).  (BTW, the\nmore I think about it, the more I apprciate th thought put into HTML and the\nrest of the REST ecosystem).\n\nIs there a clever universal method for identifying ALL appropriate links in\na client of a REST API such that you can start with a given URL/bookmark\n(like login), and not have to hardcode any &quot;workspace&quot; URLs other than the\nfirst?  Is this identification process to complex without a human to\ninterpret the meaning of the links?\n\nTake a look at Craig McLanahan&#39;s first message in this thread... IMHO, it\nhas some important clues to these answers :)\n*\nDarrel*, does that answer the question satisfactorally?\n\n*Roy*, if you&#39;re reading this, did I get it right this time?\n\n-Solomon Duskis\n\r\n--0015175ce1367bff200464573efa\r\nContent-Type: text/html;
