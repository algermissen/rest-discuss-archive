How much of a product is available to promise at a future time? \nFor example, how many blue shoes can I get by tomorrow?\nThe answer is a quantity.\n\n2. Is a specified quantity of a product at a specified time?\nFor example, can I get 100 blue shoes tomorrow?\nThe answer is a boolean.\n\nThis query might be offered to a customer to use before they place an \norder, or it might be used by the order-taking Web resource before \naccepting an order.\n\nIn REST terms, I assume this is a GET with parameters, and the Web \nresource to address is the Product (i.e. BlueShoe).\n\nHow would you say it?\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
