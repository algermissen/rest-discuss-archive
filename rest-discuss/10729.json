Assume the query, or the result of the query (doesn&#39;t really matter)\n&gt; to be a resource by itself, do a POST to create it. The resource is now\n&gt; remembered by the server and still accessible through a GET (maybe only\n&gt; for a certain time).\n\nI have used this approach with good results in several different situations.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like this option, because I didn&#39;t want to change the state of\n&gt; the server, in fact I intrinsically just wanted to do some kind of a\n&gt; GET, which shouldn&#39;t change the state of the server.\n\nI personally don&#39;t a real disadvantage here.  The extra sets of posting \nto create a new query resource before getting it&#39;s results is a bit \nannoying I suppose, but only if these queries are single use.  If the \nclient need to execute the same query repeatedly (which in my experience \n  seems to be more common) it is actually easier for clients once the \nquery is promoted to a first class resource.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://pezra.barelyenough.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
