Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;:\n&gt; Using query parameters is a convenience and does not change any\n&gt; &#39;RESTfulness&#39; of an application. I wish there were more dimensions to our\n&gt; analyses than just the ambigous &#39;RESTfulness&#39;.\n&gt; There are an innumerable number of geographic regions identifiable via a\n&gt; min/max coordinate and it doesn&#39;t matter whether the value are place in path\n&gt; segments or in query terms - the resource identifier encompasses both.\n\nIMO, using query parameters has specific implications and is not just\na matter of convenience. Query parameters are meant for user-driven\noptions and since there is only one query portion in a URI, don&#39;t you\nthink it should be used judiciously?\n\nMore info in a post by Roy:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4100\n\n\nQuoting Yao Heling &lt;yaoheling@...&gt;:\n&gt; In a word, my question can be shortened to: is it\n&gt; restful to use URLs\n&gt; consisting of heaps of Key-Value Pairs?\n\nSince what your working with is not necessarily a hierarchical name\nspace, you should also check out:\nMatrix URIs by Tim Berners-Lee\nhttp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html\n\nI like the idea of using the Path Component rather than the Query\nComponent for reasons mentioned above.\n\nSandeep Shetty\n\n\n\n\n"}}
