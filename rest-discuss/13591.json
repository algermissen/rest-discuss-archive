One of\nthe things that REST does rather effectively is allow for\nserendipitous reuse by reducing the level of cross domain agreement\nrequired for such reuse.  Saying it is up to implementation is really\nsaying a the client and server have to agree before it is ok for a\nclient to store a link.\n\nA general consensus that storing links for reuse at a later time is\npresumptively acceptable would facilitate more serendipitous reuse.\nThe lack of such a consensus means that many uses of any service are\nhighly dodgy until you have tracked down it&#39;s implementer and\nextracted an agreement that you may store links for later reuse.\n\nOf course, this raise the implementation effort required for servers.\nHowever, in an HTTP environment the costs of this are quite\nmanageable.  In my mind it seems well worth the costs in almost all\nsituations.  Particularly when clients exist that are outside of the\ncontrol of the service implementer.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
