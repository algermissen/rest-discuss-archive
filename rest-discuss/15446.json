Specifically it allowed =\r\na client to get less data but also be less &#39;chatty&#39; (reduce total requests)=\r\n.\n\n&gt; Allowing the client to configure which fields are \n&gt; returned sounds l=\r\nike a recipe for cache invalidation \n&gt; headaches galore.\n\nI don&#39;t see why. =\r\nYou could end up with less http cache hits due to more URL variety but that=\r\n is it as far as I see. Anyone care to expand on this more.\n\n&gt; the cost of =\r\nthe request itself dwarfs the cost \n&gt; of the actual payload delivered. \n\nAc=\r\ntually this is also a reason for the optimisation LinkedIn uses and for me =\r\nthis is the number 1 reason when your resource is a ORM/DB. Specifically yo=\r\nu can optimise the ORM/DB access and at the same time reduce the total numb=\r\ner of total requests. For some applications this could be significant. \n\nLi=\r\nnkedIn quote significant savings in bytes shipped. As I see it, if your tra=\r\nffic is big enough then the smaller payload can pay off.  \n\nFor those inter=\r\nested (Java, JAX-RS, Ebean ORM) there is (JSON only) support for this with =\r\nEbean ORM&#39;s JAX-RS integration. It&#39;s early days (first release), currently =\r\nJSON only and only relevant for ORM/DB resources but might be interesting f=\r\nor folks looking for this type of optimisation.  \n \nhttp://www.avaje.org/eb=\r\nean/jaxrs.html\n\n\nCheers, Rob.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Will Ha=\r\nrtung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, May 28, 2010 at 10:28 AM, Robert Brewe=\r\nr &lt;fumanchu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Eric so eloquently put it, REST (and ther=\r\nefore HTTP) is optimized for\n&gt; &gt; large-grain messages.
