You&#39;re referring to the case where the resource has not\n&gt; yet been created, but the server knows its URI in advance, correct?\n\nNope.\n\nOn a 202 response, it is suggested that the body could contain a URI\nthat represented the &quot;future response&quot;.  So you could invoke GET on\nit and it would say &quot;not yet&quot;, &quot;not yet&quot;, &quot;I expect a response soon&quot;,\nand then finally &quot;the recipient got the message&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m suggesting bringing this URI out of the body and putting in the\nLocation header, and defining that the Location header on a 202\nresponse identifies the &quot;future response&quot;.\n\nIf anybody here ever used CORBA, there was an orb that supported\na feature called a &quot;future&quot;, that was basically a place holder for\na response that you could either use a deferred invocation on (DII),\npoll yourself, or do a blocking invocation on.  This is basically\nthe same thing (once you add a router behind the scenes 8-).\n\n&gt; Using\n&gt; Location with Accept\n\ns/Accept/Accepted\n\n&gt; in that case makes sense to me, although in the particular\n&gt; case Mike describes, I can&#39;t see why I wouldn&#39;t just create an &#39;undecided&#39;\n&gt; status resource at the time the business document was received. In that case I\n&gt; would return Created (with a Location).\n\nWell, as I said before, I think it&#39;s more important the &quot;accepted&quot;\nnature of the response be reflected in the response status than the\nfact that any old resource was created as a side effect.  It&#39;s more\nspecific, and quite meaningful to intermediaries.\n\nIn a sense, if 202 did return the &quot;future&quot; in the Location header, then\nyou could consider that there&#39;s an inheritance hierarchy here;\n\n200 &lt;-- 201 &lt;-- 202\n    &lt;-- 203\n    &lt;-- 204\n    &lt;-- 205\n    &lt;-- 206\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
