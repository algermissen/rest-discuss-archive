Imagine when I pass\n&gt; to Joe a URL, and ask him to see my newly-design html home page; but\n&gt; when Joe dereference the URL, he get a P3P document.\n&gt;   \nBut Joe should not have received the P3P document.  You told him it was \na home page, and most people share a common notion of what format a \n&quot;home page&quot; is in.  So he should have asked for an html document.  If \nyou just said, &quot;check out my site at this URI&quot;, then what Joe gets back \nis based on his preferences (e.g. html before xml before pdf before p3p) \nand what representation formats you provide.  If Joe wants to see P3P \nbefore HTML, then that is what he gets.  There is no ambiguity here, as \nlong as it is all of the same resource.\n&gt; If I use URL in this way, I have to pass Joe an extra info: &quot;content\n&gt; type&quot;, along with that URL, to make sure we both see, and able to talk\n&gt; about the &quot;same information [1]&quot;.\n&gt;   \nWe do that now, just that it&#39;s mostly implicit.  In our fairly narrow \nusage of the web, we have implied content types (text, html, image, \netc).  And we all use fairly similar browsers.  And these browsers \naccept a variety of formats.  And, more or less, the format preference \nis pretty much the same across these browsers.  As a result, when you \nand I both pull up the same URI, we are fairly likely to get the same \n&quot;content type&quot; back.  And yes, we could continue this way, making \nout-of-band loose agreements, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that we \nrely on some level of awareness of the &quot;content type&quot; in order to get \nour URIs and end up with something similar.\n\nI realize that I am likely in a minority opinion here.  And I don&#39;t \nthink that content negotiation is a magic bullet or anything.  There are \nright and wrong ways to use it.  I just happen to think that there are \nmore &quot;right&quot; ways than people (many, it seems) are willing to admit.\n\nSeairth\n\r\n--------------020009030105020705020806\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\ntoydi wrote:\n&lt;blockquote\n cite=&quot;mid73ec599d0603201850v673e8fc4s71b50588eba0e90e@...&quot;\n type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;On 3/20/06, Seairth Jacobs &lt;a\n class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:seairth@...&quot;&gt;&lt;seairth@...&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote:\n  &lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have a URI like &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.sample.com&quot;&gt;&quot;http://www.sample.com&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
