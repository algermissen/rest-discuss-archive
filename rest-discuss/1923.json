The problem, said\nBox, is that the intermediaries--that is, the companies that own the routers\nand cables between the client and server--will not allow single transactions\nthat take this long.&quot;\n\nWhat exactly is it about the intermediaries that wouldn&#39;t allow for a long\ntransaction time?\n\n\n\n"}}
