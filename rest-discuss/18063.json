If\n&gt; your partial update is not idempotent, then use PATCH or POST\n&gt; (thereby signaling an intermediary *not* to retry it).\n&gt; \n\nPUT is idempotent because it&#39;s been mapped to replace, which is always\nexpected to be idempotent.  So it doesn&#39;t mean &#39;idempotent&#39; to\nintermediaries per se, it means &#39;replace&#39; which just so happens to be\nreliably idempotent.  HTTP is based on transaction semantics, not\ntransaction characteristics, so it is an error to choose a method based\non characteristic matching rather than generic transaction semantics.\n\nIt&#39;s still overloading PUT to make it also mean &#39;idempotent partial\nupdate&#39; because it maps to a semantic, replace, not idempotency itself.\nChanging PUT to mean update for some resources and partial update for\nothers results in a resource-specific interface, not a generic one.\n\nPATCH is mapped to &#39;partial update&#39; semantics.  Because this interaction\ncannot be interpreted to always, reliably be idempotent, even if some\nindividual PATCH transactions are, the method is not treated as\nidempotent.  REST is a generic interface, not an object-specific one,\nso it isn&#39;t concerned with optimizing for the 0.01% of traffic which\namounts to idempotent partial-updates.  REST is concerned with making\nthe semantics of the transaction unambiguous, i.e. self-descriptive.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
