Once we have bilateral \nagreements we&#39;ve departed from a common interface.\n\nThat said, I completely agree that where _partial_ global agreements are \nalready in effect, then it would almost certainly help to factor them \nout of any bilateral agreement ... eg. we agree on TCP/IP and HTTP, \nXML, maybe REST, so no need to negotiate over them).\n\nBut that&#39;s a fixed, already sunk, cost. The problem is all the stuff \nthat comes _afterwards_.\n\n&gt; The more aspects that are standardized, the easier it is to negotiate\n&gt; the operational interface between trading partners.\n\nThe trouble is that the higher you climb up the semantic ladder the \nharder this stuff becomes.\n\n&gt; Plus, each trading partner usually has many other partners. So unless\n&gt; you want a different interface for each of your trading partners, the\n&gt; forces for uniform interface remain in play, even locally.\n\nThat&#39;s already taken into account in the (admittedly crude) model I \nsuggested ... I&#39;m assuming O(logN) partners each (hence O(NlogN) \ntrading pairs).\n\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, on the common interface model every change requires global\n&gt; &gt; renegotiation and reimplementation;\n&gt;\n&gt; That assumes everything is standardized and mandatory, doesn&#39;t it?\n\nIf it isn&#39;t, then how is it a common interface?\n\n&gt; &gt; And, again FWIW, I&#39;ve seen data from several B2B exchanges that this\n&gt; &gt; last problem is a real one ... they have a tough time signing up\n&gt; &gt; anyone beyond the initial consortia.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s a lot more to the B2B exchanges problems than common\n&gt; interfaces.\n\nOh, sure, I agree with that ;-)\n\n&gt; In fact, the major B2B exchanges I know about are all involved in\n&gt; efforts to create global uniform standards.  (I don&#39;t think interfaces\n&gt; have anything to do with their business problems, by the way, so\n&gt; standards won&#39;t help them either.)\n\nAgreed ... but I take that as evidence that they&#39;re doomed ;-)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
