Finally, if you are squeamish about changing URIs\nin an already-released app, employ a server-side URI redirector to\nkeep stale URIs from killing bookmarks.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n[1] - REST Upside Down (http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/885)\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 2, 2009 at 19:04, scameron02 &lt;scott.cameron@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Jon Hanna &lt;jon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no opaque vs hackable.
