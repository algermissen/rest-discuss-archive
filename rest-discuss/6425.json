What the server *does* provide is a link\n&gt;  labelled &quot;edit&quot; to the form for editing.\n\nIf you want to approach the problem as an HTTP-driven automaton, that&#39;s true.\n\nIf you want to approach the question from a server design perspective,\nthen we can say we know everything about the resource. We know that\nediting the actual &lt;form&gt; markup will have no effect on the target of\nthe form action,  so it&#39;s not really reasonable to claim the form\nconstitutes a &quot;representation&quot; of the wiki page, any more so than\nclaiming the index page of my blog is but one representation of the\nthird entry down. REST isn&#39;t a productive design strategy unless you\naccept the need for source resources, where sending a PUT request will\nactually set the state of the resource. Atom calls the source resource\nthe &quot;edit resource&quot;, which makes the terminology confusing, but it&#39;s\nthe same idea.\n\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
