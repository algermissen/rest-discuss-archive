It sounds intriguing, but I don&#39;t see a lot of \nexamples out there.  I&#39;m wondering how best to handle sessions.  For \nexample, a user logs in via a login page, then works within the context \nof that session, then logs out (or times out).  Could someone give an \nexample what HTTP requests would be involved?\n\nI suppose the session ID would become part of the URL.  Couldn&#39;t that \ncreate a security risk?\n\nWould you embed the session ID as a hidden field in the login page, so \nthat it would get submitted when the user logs in?\n\nThanks!\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
