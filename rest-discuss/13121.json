Provided the xml or json representation of a\n&gt; resource are semantically equivalent (aka contain the same state), I see no\n&gt; reason not to use conneg on those. The expectation of an automated user\n&gt; agent is not the same as the expectation of a user, and as such I don&#39;t see\n&gt; much benefit in pushing for separate URIs for different serializations of\n&gt; the same resource state.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for choosing multiple media types that are available, provided you\n&gt; promote the ones that should be linkable independently (and my definition of\n&gt; what is desirably independent is based on user expectation), we already have\n&gt; this, with a 300 response to a simple GET on a generic URI. Agent-driven\n&gt; conneg is perfectly acceptable but requires separate URIs for each notable\n&gt; representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the difference between resource and representation, it can be blurry,\n&gt; as a resource may have multiple representations, and a representation may be\n&gt; a resource itself (aka have its own URI).\n&gt;\n&gt; The awww:resource is anything important enough to have a URI. When\n&gt; dereferencing such URI, the response may be no representation (in which case\n&gt; it may be an http URI denoting a thing, for example as used in rdf), one\n&gt; representation (there is one representation sent to the client, based on\n&gt; Conneg or current state of the resource), the resource could be the\n&gt; representation (in which case it&#39;s an IR, the resource is the\n&gt; representation, in the sense that all properties of the resource can be\n&gt; transferred in the representation), or a list of representations through a\n&gt; 300 (and then one cannot decipher the kind of resource we&#39;re talking about,\n&gt; but can access individual representations promoted as resources through the\n&gt; uris linked in the response).\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not blurred as such, it&#39;s the current landscape of what resources are\n&gt; and what URI denotes on the web.\n&gt;   \n\nWe&#39;ve discussed this already elsewhere - I understand why you might feel \nthe need to give a representation a URI.\n\nAs you know, I am of the opinion that the costs of taking that approach \n(complications in cache-invalidation/other intermediary mechanisms, \ndegraded uniformity, convoluted messages with Link headers) outweigh the \nbenefit (being able to exchange a plain-text hyperlink directly to a \nspecific representation).\n\nWe&#39;re missing the point a bit here; the purpose of this thread was to \nestablish whether or not a state transition is defined by the whole \nmessage or just the URI/Verb, if the conclusion is the latter - then \nthere is a far stronger case for URI &#39;conneg&#39;. If it&#39;s the former, the \ncase is not necessarily stronger for HTTP conneg - but parties such as \nbrowser vendors and WHATWG should be encouraged to provide the \nmechanisms necessary to pursue this alternative, non-conflicting, \napproach to content negotiation.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
