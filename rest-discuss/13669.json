Thus, it makes perfect sense what Dhananjay mentions about a set of part=\r\nicular &quot;legal&quot; transitions in a given point of time (or state). That set of=\r\n transitions is the one offered by the server to the client (that list or U=\r\nRLs and actions). \n\nStill, that list is inferred by the server at hand from=\r\n the resource&#39;s actual state and metadata, and sent back to client. It is n=\r\never maintained as a state in one particular server. \n\nIn that way, if the =\r\nrules change, the next server that receives a request for legal actions, wi=\r\nll build the list using the new rules, and the client will have an automati=\r\nc, on the spot, application update. That is why knowing the operations out =\r\nof band is not good for app maintainability. And of course, server may need=\r\n those rules too to avoid crazy, out of place clients trying to post illega=\r\nl actions.\n\nCheers again!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n--- In rest-discuss@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Dhananjay Nene &lt;dhananjay.nene@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wonder if refe=\r\nrring to an analogous state machine, one could summarise as\n&gt; follows. The =\r\nclient&#39;s view of an application state is always a set of\n&gt; available transi=\r\ntions from an implicit inferrable state, and the server\n&gt; having conveyed t=\r\nhe appropriate transitions has made unnecessary the need to\n&gt; track the cli=\r\nent state at its end even though both are working off of some\n&gt; ephemeral y=\r\net very relevant application state. Thus at the end of each\n&gt; transiton, th=\r\ne client only knows the available transitions - which the\n&gt; server served. =\r\nThe state itself while inferrable is irrelevant in the\n&gt; context of what th=\r\ne client needs to do next and how the server will satisfy\n&gt; the client&#39;s fu=\r\nture exercised preferences, -  once a transition is complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, =\r\nOct 4, 2009 at 9:09 AM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThanks Ian.

Perhaps I implied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise when I suggested clients might &quot;infe=\r\nr&quot; application state\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from received representations: I don&#39;t in fact t=\r\nhink that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary of desirable. It&#39;s simpler than that. Clients a=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in achieving particular goals, and they evaluate receiv=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; representations of resource state in light of those goals; that is=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they choose to operate hypermedia controls - links or forms - based=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on their understanding of how the control&#39;s semantic context (ie.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; link relation value) relates to their current goal. In all this, the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; client need not necessarily know it&#39;s participating in a particular\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; protocol, or be aware of the overall state of the distributed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appl=\r\nication.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that in line with what you meant by this being opaq=\r\nue to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; client?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ian\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yah=\r\noogroups.com &lt;rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Ian,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That is an excellent des=\r\ncription of state from the server&#39;s point of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; view.

The state of the order as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; held=\r\n in the http session in your example is resource state, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; applica=\r\ntion state.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A simple - perhaps overly simple - ordering pro=\r\ntocol might be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; something like: new order created -&gt; adding line ite=\r\nms -&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; completed -&gt; payment received -&gt; order dispatched.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In the observable interactions between client and server, this\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; protocol is never visible &quot;as such&quot;: it can only be viewed through\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the lens of resource state.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Over the course of a se=\r\nries of interactions, the &quot;application&quot; (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; game being played out =\r\nbetween the client and the server) will be in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one or other of these=\r\n states - as viewed from a &quot;God&#39;s eye&quot; point of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; view. Once the appl=\r\nication state has progressed to &quot;order\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; completed&quot;, for example, it&#39;=\r\ns no longer possible to add manipulate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; resources so as to add new l=\r\nine items; it is, however, possible to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; manipulate resources such th=\r\nat the application state transitions to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;payment received&quot; (the cli=\r\nent would do this by submitting a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; representation of a payment, perh=\r\naps).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The client and the server cooperate to execute this p=\r\nrotocol, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they do so by transferring representations of resource=\r\n state, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; representations of application state. Application state=\r\n is never\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; represented &quot;as such&quot;; rather, it&#39;s inferred by the clien=\r\nt based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on current representations of resource state. If the app=\r\nlication is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the &quot;order completed&quot; state, the representation of t=\r\nhe order\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; received by the client may very well include a link that h=\r\nas been\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; annotated with the link relation value &quot;payment&quot;. This isn&#39;=\r\nt a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; straightforward representation of application state, however: i=\r\nt&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; an &quot;invitation&quot; to the client to transfer a representation of a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; payment to this linked resource. As a side-effect of transferring\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this representation, the &quot;application&quot; may transition to &quot;payment\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; received&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What&#39;s important here is that the server =\r\nis really only interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in maintaining resource state, which incl=\r\nudes maintaining the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; integrity of the lifecycles of the resources u=\r\nnder its control, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the invariants that hold between resources (i=\r\nf any). The server\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can&#39;t be sure the client will ever take that ste=\r\np of submitting a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; payment, so why bother holding onto application s=\r\ntate? Application\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; state is something that can be reconstructed &quot;aft=\r\ner the fact&quot;, by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; client, or omniscient observer, based on the dis=\r\nposition of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; current set of resource representations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So the order representation is always a representation of resource\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; state. Application state, that &quot;snapshot of the instance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; e=\r\nxecution of a protocol&quot;, can only be inferred or reconstructed from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n resource state.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hope this is of some help.
