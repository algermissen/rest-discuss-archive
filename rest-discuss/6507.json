That interface states\n&gt; that all objects have a universally addressable location (the URL);\n&gt; are serializable using a selectable protocol (the content-type or mime\n&gt; type); and implement one or more of a constrained set of methods (GET,\n&gt; POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.).\n\nBut from my point of view it&#39;s a very poor object orientation. A large \n&#39;object&#39; (server) with many &#39;methods&#39; (URLs-methods) returning &#39;structs&#39; \nwithout behaviour (representations).\n\nIf REST is object oriented or follow some other programming paradigm \ndoesn&#39;t say anything if it&#39;s good or bad. However, since COM appears to \nbe more object oriented it ought to be easier to grok for object \norientated programmers, and perhaps even fit better into object oriented \nprogramming languages.\n\n&gt; The constrained-ness of the interface is where REST (and HTTP in\n&gt; particular) win over CORBA and DCOM. Furthermore, HTTP goes to great\n&gt; pains to optimize the common case (the GET method) so as to minimize\n&gt; delivery overhead. That&#39;s why it scales better.\n\nThat&#39;s a very good point! In CORBA/DCOM all operations are equal, for \nREST there ought to be more possibilities for the infrastructure to \noptimize.\n\nCheers,\n  Jonas\n\n\n"}}
