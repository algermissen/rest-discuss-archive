It seems to be the\nset of URIs that are outside of web architecture (because the finding covers\nthose inside) and have representations that are not hypermedia (which is\nkind of funny because by definition such &quot;things&quot; are not in REST).  Seems\nlike a fairly uninteresting set to me.  \n\nYou seem to have your own internal definition of REST that doesn&#39;t map to\none that I&#39;m familiar with.  We&#39;ve established that you think that Roy and\nthe TAG aren&#39;t any kind of authorities wrt REST - because if you did you&#39;d\nknow that Roy would have a &quot;Roy stern comment&quot;(tm) on any W3C TAG finding\nthat contradicted his view of REST and he&#39;s also contributed to that\nfinding.  FWIW, one of the underlying philosophical aspects of REST is that\nresources and their representations change, and that includes REST itself.\nThe spoon is there if we all agree it&#39;s there.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Etan Wexler [mailto:ewexler@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 4:37 PM\n&gt; To: Dave Orchard; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: &quot;Casual Web Services&quot; and Well Designed Urls \n&gt; [rest-discuss]\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave Orchard wrote to rest-discuss:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And so we go on [about] the opaqueness of URIs.  \n&gt; Notwithstanding that \n&gt; &gt; all HTML FORM GETs create URIs on the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote in a previous message to Microformats REST\n&gt; (&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-\n&gt; October/000299.html&gt;):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hypermedia includes rules of construction where the rules \n&gt; find expression in a resource representation of a standard \n&gt; content type and where the content type indicates how to \n&gt; interpret the rules.
