The verb is POST.\n\nAt the protocol level, certainly we are POSTing the purchase order.\n\nBut, at the application level, we are making an offer for a purchase.\n\nTo use Paul&#39;s term, by recasting the offer action into a &quot;purchase order\noffer document&quot;, then you can use the generic verb POST.  In any case, it\nsimply means that we can model the same transaction in both a document/data\nway or a procedural method-call way.  They use different verbs.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
