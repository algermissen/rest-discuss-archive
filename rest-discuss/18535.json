IOW, I set up the server to require\nauth fo=\r\nr the URIs and let things &quot;flow&quot; from there. No special coding\non the brows=\r\ner client at all.\n\nSCRIPTED PRE-AUTH\nOccasionally, I&#39;ll set up a scripted &quot;=\r\npre-auth&quot; on the browser. In\nthis case, I use a small JS lib to handle the =\r\nbase64 encoding and\nprompt the user to provide user/pass locally, encode it=\r\n and stuff it\ninto the headers for ajax calls. I do this on every call, tho=\r\n and that\ncan get tedious.\n\nBASIC AUTH COOKIE HACK\nFinally, (and I&#39;m not re=\r\nally proud of this one....) I sometimes stuff\nthe Base64-encoded Basic Auth=\r\n value as a cookie (sheesh!) and set up\nthe server to peek into the cookie =\r\nspace before throwing a 403 upon\nreceiving an un-auth&#39;ed request. The advan=\r\ntage here is the cookie is\nretained across pages.\n\nThat&#39;s what I do.\n\nmca\nh=\r\nttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.r=\r\ndf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 7, 2012 at 17:30, jason_h_erickson &lt;jason@jasonericks=\r\non.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have a web application that has many web services and an=\r\n AJAX web client as well as some mobile clients. =A0I won&#39;t call them RESTf=\r\nul web services, but I&#39;m trying to get them closer.\n&gt;\n&gt; One problem I have =\r\nis that I am trying to avoid having any application state on the server. =\r\n=A0I have that with the exception of having an authenticated session. =A0No=\r\nthing is stored in the session except for the user&#39;s &quot;Subject&quot; which knows =\r\nwhether or not it is authenticated and who it is authenticated as.\n&gt;\n&gt; But =\r\nI want to get all the way to having no session, but that means I have to au=\r\nthenticate with every request. =A0My mobile clients have no trouble doing t=\r\nhis. =A0(In fact, they do it already.) =A0However, this seems to be rather =\r\ntricky from a browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the ENTIRE application was in one web page, t=\r\nhen you could just store the credentials in memory. =A0However, if you have=\r\n to go from one web page to another, it starts to get hairy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyon=\r\ne on this list have any best practices for avoiding having any session in w=\r\neb applications (Human to Machine) requiring authentication?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
