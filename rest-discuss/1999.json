Or a two-resource \nconfig. I&#39;ve seen both.  Both can work.  Logically, you are correct, \nthere are two sides of a contract.  For orders, they&#39;re often called \npurchase order and sales order. Each trading partner will keep their \nown private copy.  We&#39;re just talking about what&#39;s published in the \nexternal shared space as Web resources, which could be two or one \norder resources.\n\nWho owns it?  I&#39;ve seen a marketplace (Commerce One, Ariba, etc.) and \nalso the dominant trading partner.\n\n&gt; How do each control what can be done to the\n&gt; resource?  What keeps CompanyB from altering the Purchase Order?  \nAnd if\n&gt; they do, how can CompanyA prove this if they don&#39;t even control the \nresource\n&gt; pointed to by the above URI?\n\nCompany A digitally signs the offer, Company B adds their acceptance \nand digitally signs the combination of offer and acceptance.  \nNeedless to say, Company A archives a copy of the combined signed \nresource.\n\n&gt; I am not saying that the single-resource approach is wrong.  I just \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; think I understand it as well as you do...\n\nI&#39;m still working out some of the details in REST, and so am very \ninterested in different people&#39;s approaches.  The most practice I&#39;ve \nseen with this stuff is with:\n(a) two-resource configurations using the EDI mailbox approach, and\n(b) Web form interfaces for small companies selling to large \ncustomers, where the customer posts the PO on an extranet and the \nsupplier accepts or maybe is allowed to negotiate timing, quantity, \nnumber of deliveries, etc.\n\n&gt; &gt; One consequence of having two resources is that their states are\n&gt; &gt; logically connected, that is, you need state-alignment \ntransactions\n&gt; &gt; for subsequent interactions.  (This is not a killer requirement, \nyou\n&gt; &gt; need a protocol for agreement on changes in a single-resource \nmodel,\n&gt; &gt; too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow you here.  What would be considered a &quot;state-\nalignment\n&gt; transaction&quot; here?\n\nIf you have two order resources (PO and Sales Order), they are \nactually two sides of the same contract.  So if you change the state \nof one in some way that changes the contract, the other needs to be \nchanged too, and both parties should agree to and digitally sign the \nchanges.\n\nOffer-Acceptance as practiced by RosettaNet and ebXML is a business \nprotocol for coming to agreement on contract formation and changes in \na two-resource configuration.\n\nIn a state-alignment transaction, the resources begin in state X, the \ninitiator of the transaction requests a change to state Y. If the \nother party agrees, the resource state is changed to Y. If not, or if \nthere is a technical failure, the state remains at X.  No rollback, \nno locking.  Pretty simple.  This is an instance of the HOPP pattern, \nfor Half-Object Plus Protocol, because in this case the two resources \nare actually halves of the same contract.\n\nFor a verbose description of business state alignment transactions, \nsee:\nhttp://www.gefeg.com/tmwg/files/Chapter%209%20PatternsR10.pdf\n\nWe&#39;ve been working out a RESTful Offer-Acceptance protocol on this \nlist.  It&#39;s still missing a couple of features, e.g. time \nconstraints, security and non-repudiation features.  But it&#39;s pretty \nclose.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
