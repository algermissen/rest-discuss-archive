I&#39;m \n&gt; dumbfounded this can get incubated in the ASF.\n\nBill was writing,=\r\n respectively, of the Enterprise Social Messaging\nExperiment (&lt;http://incub=\r\nator.apache.org/esme/&gt;) and the Apache Software\nFoundation (&lt;http://www.apa=\r\nche.org/foundation/&gt;). I&#39;ll leave aside the\nassessment of the ESME API (not=\r\n that I have arguments with Bill&#39;s\nassessment, anyway). I want to address B=\r\nill&#39;s dumbfounding. I understand\nhis feeling, but don&#39;t share it. The time =\r\nfor surprise has passed; just\nglance at the list of projects within the Apa=\r\nche Software Foundation\n(&lt;http://projects.apache.org/indexes/alpha.html&gt;) t=\r\no see what I mean.\n\nI am a lurker\n(&lt;http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it=\r\n-works.html#users&gt;) within the\nApache community, so I don&#39;t claim to know h=\r\now the Apache Software\nFoundation works. I have read &quot;How the ASF works&quot;\n(&lt;=\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html&gt;), a publication of\nthe =\r\nApache Software Foundation. Consider the following passage from &quot;How\nthe AS=\r\nF works&quot;\n(&lt;http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#incubator&gt;):\n=\r\n\n&gt; It must be noted that the incubator (just like the board) does not \n&gt; pe=\r\nrform filtering on the basis of technical issues. This is because \n&gt; the fo=\r\nundation respects and suggests variety of technical approaches. \n&gt; It doesn=\r\n&#39;t fear innovation or even internal confrontation between \n&gt; projects which=\r\n overlap in functionality.\n\nDo I need to comment further?\n\n-- \nPlease do no=\r\nt copy me on public replies.\n\n\n"}}
