Sounds like you=\r\n underestimate the usefulness of the massively\n&gt; distributed architecture c=\r\nalled Internet. :)\n\nInternet became massively useful after 1) distributed n=\r\name resolution\ncalled DNS was invented and 2) search engines became powerfu=\r\nl enough.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Unless we are assuming any REST system is an isolated serve=\r\nr\n&gt;&gt; or server farm, running under single authority, and all potential\n&gt;&gt; u=\r\nsers and clients are aware of it and love to read its documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\ne ambiguity of REST/HTTP is exactly why it *is* so powerful as a concept.\n\n=\r\nAFAIK , REST is not defined as HTTP specific, on the contrary.\n\n&gt; Yes, you =\r\nhave to work a little harder on the application semantics and the\n&gt; glue of=\r\n the ontology layer, but it comes with the amazing bonus of all the\n&gt; goodn=\r\ness of WWW. Surely, we can&#39;t ignore its success? It&#39;s the ease of\n&gt; working=\r\n with it, of setting it up, and the ambigous nature of each request\n&gt; (that=\r\n can be tunneled through anything) and the constraints on them (for\n&gt; cache=\r\nability, etc.) that makes that possible.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t challenge the usefulnes=\r\ns of catch-all POST on network level,\non the contrary.\n\nWhat I do challenge=\r\n is the missing semantic level, which makes\nimpossible to find out what all=\r\n these resources are about. I don&#39;t\nunderstand what&#39;s wrong of admitting HT=\r\nTP is _the_ transport level for\nmyriad of specific applications, defining t=\r\nheir own semantics in the\nHTTP message body payload.  Or do we perceive OSI=\r\n architecture fixed\nin stone once and forever?  Sure it is in the textbooks=\r\n, but not\nalways as positive example. It is often cited that early in the\nI=\r\nnternet history, there were no precise idea what the applications\nwill appe=\r\nar, so why we insist there could be no layer above OSI 7?\n\nComparison with =\r\nWWW is not fair.  There is a single shared semantic\nfor human readable web =\r\npages, and our brains (so far) are way better\nresolving the semantics, comp=\r\nared to software code.\n\n&gt;&gt; Finding resources is critical part of any networ=\r\nk architecture. If I\n&gt;&gt; do not know nothing of Amazon, and there is no any =\r\nsearch engine\n&gt;&gt; available, =C2=A0how I am supposed to find where to buy on=\r\nline books? Even\n&gt;&gt; how I am supposed to know I _could_ buy books online?\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; But why are you raising these what-if questions? Do you have some scenar=\r\nios\n&gt; that you are concretely struggeling with, or are good examples of HTT=\r\nP gone\n&gt; bad? I fear I do not understand &quot;what if there are no search engin=\r\nes&quot;,\n&gt; because there are.\n&gt;\n\nWell, having used Internet before  Altavista, =\r\nGoogle, et al. became\ninto their force, I do remember times when web sites =\r\nwere\nparticipating in &quot;rings&quot;, where each site was happy to include links\nt=\r\no the next one in the ring, thus allowing a new sites to become\nvisible.  A=\r\nnother way to learn about a web site was for somebody to\nshare the link by =\r\nemail, or even offline.  The HATEOAS &quot;follow your\nnose&quot; approach reminds me=\r\n exactly this - no global knowledge, just\nfollow the next step. The power o=\r\nf Internet rose when the web of links\nstarted to be analysed as a whole, no=\r\nt just looking at the next peek.\n\nHowever, web services (not only REST) are=\r\n in the pre-search era, quite\npossible due to common semantics lacking.  Ma=\r\ny be because of something\nelse as well. IMHO only of course.\n\nScenarios - w=\r\nell, couple of, but details are not necessary in the\nscope of this thread. =\r\nBasically, having number of REST services under\ncommon API running in sever=\r\nal places in the world, how do you find if\nthere is a specific piece of inf=\r\normation that could be retrieved from\nany of them, or specific processing c=\r\napability available?  Sure there\nare custom solutions, but from this discus=\r\nsion I gather a generic one\nis hardly of interest.\n\n&gt;&gt; Well, we do roughly =\r\nthe same, each resource describing itself with\n&gt;&gt; RDF, according to a speci=\r\nfic ontology. But I would not say this is the\n&gt;&gt; mainstream approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; D=\r\nepends on where you dip your toe. But even if that was true, does that make=\r\n\n&gt; it wrong?\n\nOf course not.\n\nRegards,\nNina\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex\n\n"}}
