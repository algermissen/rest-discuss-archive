The instructions I give to my team\nare that they should use PUT when they intend to replace some\nserver-side state, and POST when they want to add to the set of\nserver-side state. This effectively amounts to the resource recieving a\nPOST doing what it wants with the submitted data, but attempts to\nexclude method invocations from being included in the data. The content\nshould follow the same rules as content you would use in a PUT and\nlikely use the same content types. In particular, verbs should not\nappear. You wouldn&#39;t PUT a method invocation, thus it makes no more\nsense to POST it.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
