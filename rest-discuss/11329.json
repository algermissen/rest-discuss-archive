And the Uniform Interface constraint (composed of\n&gt; the constraints identification of resources, manipulation of resources\n&gt; through representations, self-descriptive messages, and HATEOAS) also\n&gt; does not rule out centralized link servers.\n&gt;\n&gt; So is this actually an implicit constraint that should be made\n&gt; explicit, or is there some existing constraint in the thesis the\n&gt; clearly forbids centralized link servers.\n&gt;\n\nDon&#39;t confuse architectural constraints (the choices we make as\ndesigners) with environmental constraints (the forces imposed on\nus by context).  The set of REST constraints only includes the former.\n\nREST designs around the fact that centralized link servers do not\nwork across multiple organizations because they are too expensive\nto maintain and create a significant entry-hurdle to deploying\nindependent content.  That doesn&#39;t prevent people from deploying\ntheir own link servers and making use of them on the Web.  For example,\nsee the work on Hyper-G and HyperWave in the 90s.  They claimed that\na p-flood algorithm for distributing link changes was enough to\nhandle the scalability problem, but I never saw an installation of\nHyper-G that was even one-millionth the size of the Web/Intranets.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
