Or conversely, if I have a name that I don&#39;t want \n&gt;to be dereferenced, then I shouldn&#39;t use a URI with a dereferencable \n&gt;scheme.  Personally, I don&#39;t understand the problem - a name is a name. \n&gt; Some will dereference, other will not.\n\nAnd this goes to the heart of my problem with this approach: one of the\nfundamental ideas behind REST is that a URL is transferrable from one medium\nto the next, and no matter where you find it you know (a) it&#39;s a URL and (b)\nyou can use the HTTP verbs against it.\n\nOK, maybe I should qualify that by saying &quot;HTTP URLs&quot; -- maybe that will\nclear this up a bit, since URLs don&#39;t have to have just an HTTP scheme.\n\nNow, having clarified it as HTTP URLs, let&#39;s ask the question again: Why\nwould I ever want a URL *which specifies an HTTP scheme* to never be\ndereferenced? It seems to fly in the face of the philosophy that, given a\nURL, I can at least GET it and probably use the other verbs as well. In\nother words, it seems very REST-less.\n\nI can see a use for non-dereferencable (is that a word?) URI/Ls (even those\nspecifying an HTTP scheme), i.e. as unique names in RDF and such, but why\nwould I ever need such constructs under REST?\n\n&gt;Why isnt a chunk \n&gt;of metadata for a resource just another resource?\n\nBut if it&#39;s a resource, then mustn&#39;t it be available under REST? Maybe I&#39;m\nbarking up the wrong tree here, if so please let me know so I can get it\nright.\n\nThanks,\n-dave\n\n"}}
