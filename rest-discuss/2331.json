Shortly after I joined this list there was a good deal of \ndiscussion of Paul&#39;s WRDL effort ... and as I recall, there was some \nsense that perhaps we should be trying to improve WSDL instead of\nreinventing the wheel ... and then the whole topic seems to have been\nabandoned.\n\nOf course, I realize that there have been a variety of threads that\ntouched on the description/documentation issue, but there has been no\nconcerted effort to tackle it head-on for quite a while. I&#39;m not sure\nwhether that means everyone thinks it&#39;s too early to try to reach\nconsensus, or people just aren&#39;t terribly concerned about it, or what.\nYet it seems to me that being able to say &quot;this is how you get\ninformation about resources&quot; will help REST gain credibility (okay, \nthe critics love it already, but will it play in Peoria?), while \nproviding some valuable guidance for implementors.\n\nI&#39;m not about to suggest that we immediately lurch into a WSDL-like\nstandards-making effort. But might it not be a good idea to have a\nsemi-coherent collection of best practices for service description?\n\nOr have I missed something?\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
