The URIs alone\n&gt; don’t tell me anything about the hypermedia and the expected\n&gt; interactions, so that list of links gives no indication of how\n&gt; RESTful or not the system really is.\n\nI&#39;m well aware of the gensym fallacy, but we&#39;re not computers and we \ndon&#39;t need to play that game here. So I think you know *exactly* what \nI&#39;m demonstrating, but aren&#39;t willing to cede the point - there&#39;s no \ntopic resource in that &quot;API&quot;, and that method space of the &quot;API&quot; might \ngrow unfettered because the http verbs have become second class citizens \nto the programmer (but not the infrastructure or spec aware clients like \ngwa).\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; My point is that putting verbs in URLs doesn&#39;t induce useful\n&gt;  &gt; behaviour. if it did, the more bizarre corners Flickr and\n&gt;  &gt; del.icio.us&#39; APIs wouldn&#39;t exit. You can have a design that\n&gt;  &gt; allows you say incoherent things and result in bugs, like\n&gt;  &gt; having a overly finegrained programming API where users can\n&gt;  &gt; call methods out of order. Without the constraints in place,\n&gt;  &gt; you need lots of discipline win, or heaven forbid, governance.\n&gt; \n&gt; I might have agreed with you some time ago, but now I consider\n&gt; this to be a confusion of cause and effect that may have harmful\n&gt; effects. Telling people to only use nouns in their URIs will make\n&gt; their systems only marginally more RESTful, if that much, and may\n&gt; actively make them *less* RESTful in that it teaches people to\n&gt; focus on the design of URIs and not of their hypermedia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is a recipe for creating REST-RPC hybrids!\n\nI&#39;m not telling people to use nouns - I&#39;m asking people not to couple \nnaming concerns with actions when using http, unless they absolutely \nhave to.\n\n\n&gt; And it is also the explanation for APIs like Flickr’s or\n&gt; del.icio.us’s. They stem from an unhealthy focus on URIs with\n&gt; only incidental attention to representations.\n&gt; \n&gt; The focus should be the exact opposite.\n\nI think it&#39;s simpler. Every case I&#39;ve ever witnessed where someone built \na verb into a URI came down to a programmer that wanted to expose a \nmethod, function or controller because a) the programming environment \ndictated it, b) programmers are not trained to think in terms of \nnetworks or protocols, or some combination of the two.\n\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; What&#39;s most interesting to me is that I think many programmers\n&gt;  &gt; in the field prefer RPC or REST-RPC hybrids.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because they don’t think in terms of hypermedia, and none of the\n&gt; libraries and frameworks we have try to address this at all. \n\nAgain I think it&#39;s simpler. These approaches are prevalent because \nframeworks and specifications design in coupling of names and actions. \nAnything else is fighting the framework, or specification - you have a \njob to do and a time to do it in, why bother working around the library?\n\n\n&gt; So\n&gt; people do not even realise that they are missing the most\n&gt; important part of the puzzle, and even once they do, they have\n&gt; to put in all the work themselves. I know of no libraries that\n&gt; try to model RESTful systems by providing abstractions of the\n&gt; structures of media types and the links and forms in them.\n\nRestlet and Jersey imo are not far away.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
