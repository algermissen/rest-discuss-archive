A specific example that demo=\r\nnstrates would be very welcome. \n&gt; Also, which reliable HTTP solution is co=\r\nnsidered the best and why: POE, HTTPLR, SOA-Rity or Joe Gregorio&#39;s best pra=\r\nctice in Restify Day Trader?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt;\n\nIs HTTP itself viewed =\r\nas unreliable the results of the operation done over HTTP &quot;could&quot; be unreli=\r\nable e.g. server could timeout internally after processing the request half=\r\nway.\n\nI believe the solutions you mention address this type of unreliabilit=\r\ny and not transport unreliability per se.  I could be wrong though.  I don&#39;=\r\nt have experience with any of the solutions to really have an opinion.\n\nEb\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
