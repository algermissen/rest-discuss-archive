My client application application\n&gt; &gt; manipu=\r\nlates &quot;content records&quot; that it identifies by a URN that takes\n&gt; &gt; the form=\r\n of: &quot;mgid:[foo]:[bar]:[baz]:[id]&quot;. To the client, this isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; just an o=\r\npaque string. It understands the concept of foos, bars, etc.\n&gt; &gt; and can ex=\r\ntract them from the URN. (FWIW, these are design decisions\n&gt; &gt; that were ma=\r\nde long ago and I have no control over.) Would it be\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for me=\r\n to put something like this as the starting point\n&gt; &gt; for all clients?\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; http://service.mysite.com/v{version}/mgid/{foo}/{bar}/{baz}/{id}\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then whenever the client accesses the service, it does a GET on\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://service.mysite.com/ , parses the URI template, and carries on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that sound reasonable? I gotten suggestions from some people (wh=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know REST well at all) to POST the URN and respond with the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n correct URI or redirect to it. This, I&#39;m pretty sure, is a really bad\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nidea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Letting the server resolve the URN into a URL would make it easi=\r\ner to\n&gt; change the server and add new functionality without breaking client=\r\ns,\n&gt; so you should look into it.  You can also do that with a GET, possibly=\r\n\n&gt; returning 303 (See Other) with the new URL.\n\nHmmmm....didn&#39;t think about=\r\n using a GET and returning a 303. That&#39;s\nsignificantly more palatable. So i=\r\nf the client has something like\n&quot;mgid:abc:blah:xyx:123&quot;, it could:\n\n  GET /=\r\nv1/content/mgid%3Aabc%3Ablah%3Axyx%3A123\n  Host: service.mysite.com\n\nAnd th=\r\ne server would respond:\n\n  HTTP/1.x 303 See Other\n  Location: http://servic=\r\ne.mysite.com/v1/mgid/abc/blah/xyz/123\n\n\n&gt; Returning a URL template that the=\r\n client then populates doesn&#39;t sound\n&gt; much different from returning a form=\r\n that the client populates, URL\n&gt; templates is just another mechanism and o=\r\nne we&#39;re seeing growing\n&gt; support for in client libraries.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the=\r\n risk here is with developers grabbing the template once,\n&gt; and then hard c=\r\noding it into their client libraries, making it hard to\n&gt; change the servic=\r\ne afterwards (same problem we&#39;re seeing with\n&gt; WSDL/WADL), so I would recom=\r\nmend having the server resolve the URN\n&gt; into a URL.\n\nAfter reading the oth=\r\ner posts in this thread, I get what you see the\nrisk is, but I think it&#39;s v=\r\nery low (especially in my case since this\nis an internal API). A client dev=\r\neloper has some responsibility to\nfollow best practices and all I can do is=\r\n make it easier to follow\nthem and hard(ish) to be tempted otherwise. Tempt=\r\nation is usually a\nfactor of how complex it is and a GET returning a URI te=\r\nmplate is\npretty simple. Though maybe resolving with a GET and a 303 is eve=\r\nn\nsimpler. I&#39;ll probably end up doing both.\n\n\n-Michael\n\n\n"}}
