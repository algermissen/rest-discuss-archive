But, it&#39;s hardly\nintroductory-level.  ;-)  As to Roy&#39;s last point, plenty of people get\nthat wrong, by interpreting it to mean that a service must have a well-\nknown URI as the endpoint through which the service is accessed.  Roy\nactually meant just the opposite.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So your intermediaries won&#39;t understand any custom media type you\n&gt; &gt; create.  Right?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m underevaluating the problems I could\n&gt; encounter with this, can you list some of them, please?\n&gt; \n\nI was just making sure you&#39;re aware of the problem.  If your internal\nintermediaries aren&#39;t &quot;doing&quot; anything with their knowledge of HTML\nmedia types, then there is no problem.  If you&#39;re going over the Web,\nthen the whole point is that you don&#39;t know *what* intermediaries are\ndoing with their knowledge of HTML media types.\n\nWhatever it is they&#39;re doing, transcoding or prefetching or what-have-\nyou, are the sorts of things which make the Web &quot;anarchically scalable&quot;.\nYou don&#39;t get this &quot;serendipitous re-use&quot; unless you&#39;re using ubiquitous\nmedia types.  REST defines a sweet spot of the deployed Web architecture\nthat you miss out on with custom media types.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So it would be RESTful, wouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; May seem strange, but I&#39;d like to recieve an authoritative &quot;YES&quot;: as\n&gt; said, the whole project is a guess that make the coding part quite a\n&gt; secondary part.\n&gt; \n\nThere is no authoritative answer that may be given based on speculative\nmusings.  The best I can do is say it *could* be RESTful.  There are\nplenty of &quot;REST&quot; APIs out there which properly contain all out-of-band\nknowledge within custom media types, however, those custom media types\ndo silly things like assign partial-update semantics to PUT, or\notherwise break various REST constraints.\n\nOnly if you put an actual system on-line, and it allows me to actually\ncurl some request/response pairs, can I give you that answer, even if\nyou&#39;re using standard media types.  REST is a set of interdependent\nconstraints, so it&#39;s impossible to focus on one aspect of a proposed\nsystem and give you the yes-or-no answer you seek.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If we&#39;re talking shades of REST, then it isn&#39;t a violation of the\n&gt; &gt; self- descriptive messaging constraint, because the user agent\n&gt; &gt; understands the media type.  If we&#39;re talking REST/NOT REST, it is\n&gt; &gt; a violation of the self-descriptive messaging constraint, because\n&gt; &gt; intermediaries don&#39;t understand the media type.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to know the disadvantages.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t understand why firewalls and proxies should be interessed\n&gt; about the content they transfer.\n&gt; \n\nIt happens all the time without you even knowing it.  ISPs use caches\nwhich look for (amongst other things) common errors, like HTML scaling\na large image to fit in a Web page, then reformat the image to the\nproper size on-the-fly.  This is one technique of many (including\nprefetching linked-to content), which are marketed together as dialup\n&quot;acceleration&quot; for modem users.\n\nMany smartphones require application/xhtml+xml, so the networks they\nrun on use transcoding gateways and standard libraries like TagSoup or\nHTML Tidy, to reformat text/html on-the-fly.  This was prevalent for\nyears, but is less so, now.  The point is that you can&#39;t know, another\npoint is that this sort of thing can only work with ubiquitous media\ntypes, and another point is that this is why REST says to use standard\nmedia types -- how _else_ are you going to achieve Web scale, if you go\nagainst how the Web scales?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
