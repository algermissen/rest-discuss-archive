Causing the user to re-enter username/password in a\nweb page for each application implicitly is granting that application\naccess. The &#39;shared secret&#39; part of AOLs video service APIs is how they\nverify that application is authentic.\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Nic James Ferrier [mailto:nferrier@...] \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 02, 2007 2:01 PM\n&gt; To: John Panzer\n&gt; Cc: Mike Dierken; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] AOL and REST?\n&gt; \n&gt; John Panzer &lt;jpanzer@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Authentication is a very challenging topic and I think it&#39;s \n&gt; one that \n&gt; &gt; is a going to be a gating factor in deployment of more \n&gt; sophisticated \n&gt; &gt; web services of all kinds.  Note that the most used web \n&gt; services today \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t require authentication, and I think that&#39;s partly \n&gt; because there \n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a really good answer for this right now.  Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see where you&#39;re coming from but I can&#39;t fully agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; RESTfull authentication is possible (I&#39;m doing it... my app \n&gt; will be announced here this week!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, fully secure authentication is simply client certs. \n&gt; Client certs are great, they really work. Ok. They do require \n&gt; a lot of work. But it&#39;s good scalable stuff once it&#39;s done.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n\n"}}
