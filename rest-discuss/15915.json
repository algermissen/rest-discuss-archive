The dual nature of hypertext, as both machine and human\nreadable, is the reason hypertext has turned out to be such a potent\nsolution to the distributed application problem.  The ability to &quot;view\nsource&quot; to introspect the API behind any Web system, is likely the\nmajor factor behind the phenomenal success of the Web.  Even if the user\nis a machine, the development and maintenance of the system is a human\nendeavor.  A hyperbinary system just wouldn&#39;t fit with the REST style.\n\nHTML tables and definition lists have the elements &lt;th&gt; and &lt;dt&gt;, the\ncontents of which are human-readable on screen.  Human sight allows\nfor the visual association of &lt;td&gt; and &lt;dd&gt; elements, when tables and\ndefinition lists are rendered on-screen.  The structure of such markup\nprovides semantics which allow, for example, vision-impaired users to\nmake the same associations between headings and cells -- regardless of\nthe nature of the data (cargo manifest, airline schedule, etc.).\n\nThese elements, and data structures like &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; nested inside of\n&lt;dd&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements, can express m2m relationships as simple as name/\nvalue pairs, to any level of complexity required to model data of almost\nany type -- particularly data that&#39;s inherently tabular/list-ish like a\ncargo manifest -- right up to the set of problems solved by using Atom\nas a container for HTML (resources as members of collections, etc.).\n\nThe human-readable content that appears on-screen may not be suitable\nto generate, say, a name/value pair of the proper syntax for m2m\ninteroperability.  That&#39;s where metadata attributes come in, like @abbr\nor @title, plus those attributes defined by RDFa.  Such metadata\npiggybacks off the natural data structures&#39; semantic markup. I can list\nthe upsides to this all day, without seeing any drawback.\n\nThis way, a human reads that there are &quot;five chaise lounges&quot; on deck,\nwhile a machine reads &quot;class=deckchair, type=chaise, count=5&quot;, from the\n_same_ markup.  When it comes time to maintain the system, all a human\nneeds to do is &quot;view source&quot; to access what amounts to thoroughly-\ncommented m2m code, particularly when linked to a schema and/or an\nontology.  Even without any knowledge of the schema/ontology, the data\nstructures are self-evident due to the markup semantics of the\nubiquitous media type used.\n\nHypertext is, by definition, human-readable.  That REST requires any\nmachine-readable payload used to drive an API to also be human-\nreadable (the hypertext constraint) is a feature, not a bug.  The\nresulting API is self-documenting.  This highly-desirable quality is\nwhat allows the system to be deciphered via &quot;view source&quot;, which is\nthe key enabler of the serendipitous re-use responsible for the Web&#39;s\nexplosive growth.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that I&#39;m really tring to understand your point.\n&gt; \n\nAnd I&#39;m really trying to help you understand REST.  Please don&#39;t\nmistake my bluntness and multiple responses, for impatience or\nbrowbeating.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
