If you think the web is broken, Redmond\n&gt;&gt; has a Silverlight engine to sell you…\n&gt;\n&gt; Heh. You weren&#39;t in the 1.5 hour meeting I had with Chris\n&gt; Wilson where I begged him to consider certain features for\n&gt; HTML5 where his repeated refrain to me was: &quot;No can do. It will\n&gt; cause the web to break for a segment of users and if it even\n&gt; affects as many as 0.1% of users then it’s a non-starter\n&gt; because 0.1% of users would represent such a large number of\n&gt; actual users.&quot;\n\nA MSFT rep staunchly refused something that would bring progress\nto the open web? Colour me an entire rainbow of surprised.\nReally! I would never have thought. (Sure, they have good reasons\nto take that position… sure is convenient that it so happens to\nconflict with progress, though.)\n\nBut how is that relevant? In what possible way would supporting\ndraconically parsed XHTML have broken existing non-XML sites?\n\nRefusing to break existing clients’ stuff relevant is not at all\nincompatible with an interest in preventing the open web from\nevolving in a direction where it works as well or better than any\nproprietary MSFT platform.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
