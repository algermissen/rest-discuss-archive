The latter was\nthought to be rooted in the W3C and academia, the former in\nIBM-Microsoft-Sun and industry.\n\nPart of the debate between services and semantics is a\nreplay of the debate about what makes the Web an interesting\nplace: commerce or content? In the conventional wisdom,\nservices represent the commerce part of the Web, while\nsemantics represent its content.\n\nIt&#39;s been clear for some time that the conventional wisdom\nis wrong.  The idea is that high-level ontologies of web\nresources can be very useful things and, here&#39;s the kicker,\nweb services are just a kind of web resource. Web services\nare resources that allow one to effect some action or change\nin the world, such as the sale of a product or the control\nof a physical device.\n\nThe motivations for creating DAML-S include discovery,\ninvocation, interoperation, composition, verification, and\nmonitoring. A part of the practical cash value of any web\ntechnology labeled &quot;semantic&quot; is that the Web ought to\nprovide something relatively useful in response to vague or\neven cryptic input from the end-user.\n\n------------------------------------\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe to the CANARIE-NEWS list please\nsend e-mail to:\n\nmajordomo@...\n\nIn the body of the e-mail:\n\nsubscribe news\nend\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThese news items and comments are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those  of the CANARIE board or\nmanagement.\n\n-----------------------------\nBill St. Arnaud\nSenior Director Network Projects\nCANARIE Inc\nwww.canarie.ca/~bstarn\n\n\n"}}
