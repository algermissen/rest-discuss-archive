Note that it is not likely that the data within a client&#39;s \nquery form has a URI.  (I also note that the first three examples seem \nto line up pretty well with GET, PUT and POST.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;A lot of the resources I&#39;ve been thinking about are completely useless\n&gt;from a REST perspective; for example urn:isbn:123-456 might identify a\n&gt;resource, namely a book (in the abstract, not any particular copy). And\n&gt;yet, what good is it? Handy for RDF, but it&#39;s not HTTP addressable so \n&gt;there is not much to say about it in a REST context.\n&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s nothing preventing me from POSTing a representation of \nurn:isbn:123-456 to some other resource that is HTTP addressable.  The \nfact that its not HTTP addressable does not prevent it from being used \nas a resource.\n\nI apoligize if I&#39;m beating the proverbial dead horse (take my stick, \nplease!), but...\nI dont understand this desire to pigeonhole resources as only (HTTP) \naddressable things.  One way to look at it is that resources don&#39;t exist \nso they can have names - resources exist so that representations of them \ncan be transferred to or from other resources.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
