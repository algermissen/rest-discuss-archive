Me thinks Jeff is straying from the opacity &quot;axiom&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IMO, the opacity axiom doesn&#39;t mean that URI can&#39;t have semantics in a\n&gt; &gt; particular application domain,\n&gt;\n&gt; It means just that.\n\nCome on.  That&#39;s nice in theory, but it&#39;s just neither true nor desirable in\npractice.  URI *always* (and should!) have some associated semantics in the\nhigher-level application domain in question.  For example, in the following:\n\n    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674000781/\n\nthe part following ASIN/ has the semantics &quot;an ISBN.&quot;  Note that I&#39;m not claiming\nthat Amazon exposes a particularly RESTful resource model, just that modeling\nbooks as resources identified in some collection via ISBNs does not by itself\nviolate opacity or break REST.  A better resource model might be:\n\n    http://www.amazon.com/books/ISBNs/0674000781\n\nThe opacity axiom simply says that the underlying application --- HTTP ---\nshouldn&#39;t ever have to know anything about books.  It doesn&#39;t say that a\nbookselling application shouldn&#39;t model and expose those abstractions through the\nURI space.  Indeed, doing so is a RESTful thing, isn&#39;t it?   It also doesn&#39;t say\nthat a set of book-oriented applications from various developers should not or\ncould not agree on a conventional method of modeling books, collections of books,\netc. as resources.\n\n&gt; As soon as you assign any meaning to a URI, then\n&gt; only those privy to that meaning are in on your little secrets (like\n&gt; appending &quot;/subs&quot; means &quot;subscribers to the URI before /subs&quot;).\n\nAnd this is just fine for &quot;applications&quot; that don&#39;t live at the same level of\ngeneralization as HTTP.  The issue at hand is whether &quot;events&quot;, pub / sub,\nnotifications, etc. constitute a (or several) higher abstraction / application\ndomain(s) like &quot;book-oriented applications&quot; (perhaps lower level than that, but\nhigher level than HTTP per se) or whether they belong at the level of generality\nof HTTP.  My argument is that they belong at a higher level, for several reasons:\n\n  (1)  Use of event notification differs from app domain to app domain\n  (2)  It&#39;s difficult IMO to provide useful notification generalizations\n  (3)  The higher levels of abstraction are more &quot;fungible&quot; in some sense\n tentative  (4)  In general we should be reluctant to extend rather than just use\nHTTP as-is\n\n&gt; It means that too, though even the query string has limits - it&#39;s not\n&gt; fully transparent.  For example, you shouldn&#39;t have to know some secret\n&gt; query parameter a priori in order to accomplish something.\n\nThis is another assertion that is meaningful in a philosophical sense but not in\npractical application.  It depends on what it is you want to accomplish.  For\nexample, of course I&#39;m going to need to know a secret (parameter names or order,\netc.) to accomplish something useful in a particular domain --- such as querying a\nsearch engine.\n\nBottom line, opacity doesn&#39;t IMO literally say that URI shouldn&#39;t have semantics\n*at all.*  It says that those semantics belong outside the realm of HTTP and URI\nas such, and rather belong to and should be interpreted in the context of some\napplication domain.  Defining that context shared by applications in a given\ndomain is the purview of the developers of those applications, and that context\n--- its resource models, conventions, etc. --- do indeed constititute a &quot;shared\nsecret&quot; among the producers and consumers of the functionality in question.  This\ndoesn&#39;t break interface generality either;  it just recognizes that there&#39;s an\nirreducible amount of functionality that should be exposed, and leaves it up to\nthe developer to expose that by leveraging and without breaking the semantics of\nHTTP.\n\nThat&#39;s my current working hypothesis, anyway.  Open to revision.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s on my\n&gt; todo list to write up my opacity investigation, btw.\n\nLooking forward to it.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
