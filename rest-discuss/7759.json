Basically, IE is not a RESTful client. \n\nIt has a javascript engine that can do PUT and DELETE and OPTIONS and\nanything else you like.\n\nThat is a well worn pattern for RESTfull clients.\n\n\n&gt; Having said that, lets assume that my first suggestion is wrong and that you be RESTful on \n&gt; a human facing website. Or application does online banking. All transactions take multiple \n&gt; steps (at a minimum, there is the form, a confirmation and a reciept, although some \n&gt; transaction like a repeating transfer into some external account have multiple form steps). \n&gt; Our architect says that the RESTful approach is to have a unique URL for every step of the \n&gt; transaction, that doing so correctly encodes all the States as resources. I argue that this is \n&gt; not the case for a few reasons:\n&gt; 1) It doesn&#39;t correctly include all the States as error conditions are not considered\n&gt; 2) That its only a coincidence of our implementation (its 5+ years old)  that a user needs \n&gt; to make several trips to the server in order to complete a transaction. We could have just \n&gt; as easily built an AJAXy UI which only makes one call to the server. This seems to me to be \n&gt; an architectural smell. \n&gt; 3) That while it could make sense that one would have a series of resources which \n&gt; transform something (in this case form parameters) into some intermediate state until that \n&gt; something is ready to be POSTed to the &quot;real&quot; resource, it seems a contrivance.\n&gt;\n&gt; By contrast, our current implementation hides all the steps of the transaction behind a \n&gt; single URL that the end user sees. The server code (which could be written as a RESTful \n&gt; client for a RESTful online banking service) that the user most directly interacts with is \n&gt; responsible for determining, based on the information provided, what content to send to \n&gt; the browser, either the reciept or some intermediate form. \n\nYou don&#39;t have to encode all the states AS resources. You have to\nencode the state IN the resources.\n\n\nA common pattern espoused here is the POST, then PUT. It works really\nwell for transactional models.\n\nYou POST to create a transaction resource... and then PUT it&#39;s state\nto it (perhaps repeatedly).\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
