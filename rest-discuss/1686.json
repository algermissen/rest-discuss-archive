We just use an existing library, and \ncut and paste from the sample code that came with the library documentation.\n\nSOAP/XML-RPC/CORBA etc. all come as pre-packaged bundles, both \nphysically and conceptually. You import the library, read +cut+paste the \ndocs, and return a nicely massaged array or whatever. Then you and your \nboss go home, on time, happy.\n\nWith REST, you have to independently research all the pieces and grok \nthe concepts, then find an appropriate library that provides \nGET,POST,PUT etc. e.g. a default PHP install will *probably* only \ninclude GET functionality (unless you build something up from the basic \nsocket functions, or include something like CURL - which doesn&#39;t mention \nREST anywhere in it&#39;s docs). Then you have to parse the page returned, \nwhich might mean having to learn DOM/SAX/REGEXP.\n\nNo, it isn&#39;t really hard (except the &#39;groking REST&#39; part ;), but it \nrequires more time, more initiative and more brave, independent thought \n(explain to your boss why you don&#39;t want to use this &#39;Industry Standard&#39; \nSOAP thing and want to &#39;make up&#39; your own interface)\n\nI&#39;m not trying to get into a debate on the state of the industry/IT \ntraining, just observing human nature as I see it. If people have the \noption of being spoon-fed, they will go for it, regardless of what is on \nthe spoon.\n\nBased on this, the idea of creating a sample &quot;REST Library&quot; might be a \ngood one?\n1, It would theoretically be very simple to implement - just wrappers \nround existing functions (the debate would probably take longer than the \nwriting ;)\n2, It would be a point of focus for all the young whippersnappers like \nmyself who like to see concrete examples\n3, As you have already pointed out Paul, most platforms will have the \ncomponents needed anyway, so after reading the docs, a programmer should \nbe able to implement the concepts, from the tools they already have.\n4, Maybe REST is more of a concept than a specific implementation, but \nthat doesn&#39;t mean that a few provocative demos wouldn&#39;t help inspire the \ntroops.\n5, I find there is nothing like actually building something to show up \nthe potential holes and pitfalls that people might fall into. Very Useful!\n\nJust my two cents. Should I ask for a refund?\n\n    Ed Lucas\n\n\n Paul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt;Bill de hï¿½ra wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;a single vendor set of pseudo-standards (JCP not withstanding)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In fairness, a good amount of the J2EE stuff goes through the JCP. But I\n&gt;&gt;do think that that calling expat+J2EE a REST toolkit is vaguely bogus.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t see the problem. REST is the architecture of the Web and a REST\n&gt;toolkit would be a piece of software that helps you build the mediating\n&gt;layer between your application and the Web. AFAIK, that&#39;s what (e.g.)\n&gt;J2EE and Zope are used for. Now that XML has come along it makes sense\n&gt;to want to extend these things. Just as they had native knowledge of\n&gt;HTML, you might want to give them native knowledge of XML and RDF. And\n&gt;maybe newer toolkits could better enforce best practices. But overall, I\n&gt;see no problem calling any web development platform a REST toolkit. REST\n&gt;is not something new.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
