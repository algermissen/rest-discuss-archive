In this homework, I\nalso stumbled over a few notes entitled &quot;Why HTTP URIs are better than\nURNs&quot; on REST Wiki. Right now I can&#39;t reach this page (hmm...), and I don&#39;t\nremember the arguments.\n\nDoes it really mean that one should use URL for names as well as addresses?\n Wouldn&#39;t it be very confusing if URL gets the meaning of &quot;a web resource,\nor possibly a name, who knows?&quot;. I like the separation of URL for addresses\nand URN for names. The use of meaningless URLs in XML namespaces has shown\nto be confusing. From your point of view, is URN a bad/useless technology?\n\nGustaf\n\n\n\n"}}
