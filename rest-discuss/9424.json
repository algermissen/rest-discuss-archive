I thought I was quite careful to say the opposite. XML most\n&gt;  deifnitely doesn;t do everything, but what it can&#39;t do (with a couple of\n&gt;  interesting if esoteric exceptions) JSON can&#39;t do either.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I remain unimpressed by the claims people make that JSON is easier. I&#39;ve\n&gt;  worked with both, and it doesn&#39;t seem so to me. JSON may be easier than\n&gt;  DOM, but it is not easier than XML.\n\nXML is an incredibly crappy way to write hashtables and arrays. JSON\nis good at that. Lots of people want a way to pass hashtables and\narrays with unicode keys and values, and be able to squeeze unicode\ninto ascii (an undervalued ability of both JSON and XML). It is much\neasier to include Web content in JSON text, because ampersands and\nangle brackets are not syntactically significant. XML&#39;s superficial\nresemblance to HTML ends up hurting it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  The claims of JSON&#39;s superiority seem mostly based on confusing XML with\n&gt;  DOM on the one hand, while refusing to learn what XML actually is.\n&gt;  Developers like to be able to just shove JSON into JavaScript and not\n&gt;  leanr anything new. Of course, evaling JSON as JavaScript doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  actually work, but most developers haven&#39;t noticed that yet.\n\nI don&#39;t think these claims can be seriously answered unless some\nconcrete examples are given.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
