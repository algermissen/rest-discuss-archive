Let&#39;s call that v1.\nI&#39;ve given it the Web Standards treatment.  Let&#39;s call this v2, and\nworry about styling it for visual rendering (h2m) later (or never):\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/mediatypes.htm\n\nThe version has to increment, because @name=&#39;encoding&#39; and @name=&#39;name&#39;\nwon&#39;t interoperate with javascript&#39;s forms object.  I&#39;ve gone with new\nname-value pairs more than I&#39;ve kept the old ones.  There&#39;s no reason\nthe Perl script couldn&#39;t be altered to work with the new, without\ndeprecating the old.\n\nThis has nothing to do with media type.  I&#39;m representing the name-value\npairs and constraining the values in the same format used before.  Or,\nI&#39;m describing (or in this case, versioning) an API -- what does that\nhave to do with creating a new data type for describing APIs?\n\nIANA wants the widest-possible interoperability with browsers (new and\nold), as well as assistive devices of all stripes.  The DOM and\naccessibility APIs for HTML 4.01 are highly polished at this point, so\nI code to them, even if I never care about that when coding to an m2m\nuser-agent.  My markup works just fine when parsed with libxslt, which\nallows HTML input.\n\nGranted, HTML 4.01&#39;s not for everyone, but you just can&#39;t beat it for\nInternet scale.  Besides, forms language is just a bike-shed color.\nThe v2 API is self-documenting, but relies on your understanding the\ncomment.  Xforms can increment that counter and dynamically create as\nmany instances of required/optional parameters needed (as table rows in\nthe model), but these aren&#39;t API differences, they&#39;re annotation\ndifferences.  The name-value pairs don&#39;t change, they&#39;re just\nrepresented differently.  Xforms binds to a model, which I&#39;d represent\nlike so:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/model.xht\n\nNotice how the default text (a required accessibility checkpoint) comes\nfrom the model.  Xforms directly manipulates the model, so when the\napplication-form is complete, the model may be submitted back to the\nserver as application/xhtml+xml using PUT or POST.  When coding an m2m\nclient, I don&#39;t really care about DOMs or accessibility APIs; but I&#39;ve\nfound that accessibility is all about m2m -- so coding to such APIs\nsimplifies my work from one project to the next, rather than inventing\nnew and unproven languages with no thought to things like accessibility\nAPIs, DOMs or progressive rendering.\n\nThere are just too many out-of-the-box benefits to using HTML for me to\nstop recommending it for m2m, unless someone can explain just exactly\nwhat it is I allegedly can&#39;t do with the v2 API when the user is a\nmachine.  Remember, REST doesn&#39;t eliminate the need for a clue, I&#39;m not\nproviding anything I expect you can use for &quot;code generation&quot; or\nanything else enterprisey/Javaish.\n\nBut especially in light of Xforms&#39; ability to turn any data structure I\ncan imagine as XML into a form, and submit an instance to the server as\na payload instead of using absurdly-long query URIs, I just don&#39;t get\nwhat the problem is, unless someone can explain it to me in terms of\nthe example I&#39;ve given here.\n\nAll I&#39;m really trying to do is move some name-value pairs around, and\nthere are plenty of ways to do that in REST using ubiquitous standards.\nMore complex data structures can also be easily modeled; lists embedded\nin tables nested in &lt;dd&gt; and suchlike all work together to achieve the\ngoal of extending limited, standardized semantics across network\nboundaries.  I&#39;d rather stick to this example, since it&#39;s real-world-\nbased and limited to name-value pairs (&lt;dl&gt;s, forms and simple tables).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
