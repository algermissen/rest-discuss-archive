Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Well, so do I.  Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and\n&gt; the registry points to a specification and the specification explains\n&gt; how to process the data according to its intent.  The specification does\n&gt; not need to be a standard (a.k.a., a measure that everyone agrees to).\n&gt; It would help, but most useful standards are defined through use.\n&gt; Whoever starts sending the data first should define the specification\n&gt; according to what is being sent, not try to get everyone to agree\n&gt; first.\n\nThanks for this clarification.\n\nOne point about this is that you can use a registered type such as\napplication/xml but that doesn&#39;t really specify anything about the\ndata does it? Only that it conforms to the simplest syntactic\nconstraints.\n\nThis is a really thorny issue I think. We&#39;ve discussed here many times\nbefore the problem of discoverability of intra-document types (such as\nXML schemas and uformats).\n\n\n&gt; My question about the API was one of practicality.  Given a space that\n&gt; has been extensively explored, why do people choose to abandon the\n&gt; available standards?  \n\n&gt; And the answer was the one I was expecting: the standards are too\n&gt; complex and it seemed better to start with something simple that is\n&gt; a better fit for the immediate need.  There is absolutely nothing\n&gt; wrong with that choice when it is made with eyes wide open.  You\n&gt; never know what will become the next HTML.\n\nYes. It&#39;s one of my hopes that REST will cause some disruption in the\ncontent declaration space   /8-&gt;\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
