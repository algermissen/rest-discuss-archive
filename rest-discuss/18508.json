Improving the evolvability of M2M applications in a\nsignificant way? I think more work is needed to prove this beyond\ndoubt.\n\nIt&#39;s certainly a more convoluted control to build automated agents against.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As an application evolves over time, servers can add/remove inputs at\n&gt; selected points in the user-agent&#39;s interactions w/ the server, too.\n&gt; These decisions can be completely context dependent. For example,\n&gt; selected users (admins) might see diff inputs than others (guests).\n\n\nRight, this is mostly an &#39;aesthetic&#39; thing though, which would have\nlittle/no value to M2M agents. The server side still needs security,\nand agents will still be built against a specific role.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; During certain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does\n&gt; support writes) inputs could simply be removed from forms for a time.\n\n\nIf this was modeled without forms - the client would simply provide\nthe info which can&#39;t be processed but the server can just drop that\nand deal with the bits it can, right ?\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
