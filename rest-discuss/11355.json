But I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; only ever seen it used as &quot;like SOAP, but without the envelope&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. your option 3).\n&gt;\n&gt; The way I remember it used back when it was a positive term\n&gt; (during the first wave of SOAP backlash pre REST awareness),\n&gt; it really did mean more than *just* shedding the envelope, but\n&gt; the rest was fuzzy. Per-resource URIs were a meme already but\n&gt; unsafe GETs were pervasive.\n\nPOX was not / is not a &#39;standard&#39; in any way that I&#39;m aware of. I was\nusing XML-over-HTTP by POSTing back in 2000/2001. Later, this was\nclassified as POX (by whom, I do not know). Mostly, it was very\nXML-RPC in implementation style. It wasn&#39;t until TechEd 2002 in\nBarcelona that I first heard of REST (which, in itself, is very\ninteresting because that was the big coming-out party for the first MS\nWS-* stack in .NET).\n\n&quot;POX is to WS-*&quot; ... &quot;what Dinosaurs are to Birds&quot; ;-)\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
