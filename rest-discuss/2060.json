Costello wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The following question actually has a lot to do with REST, although it\n&gt; &gt; may not seem so.  Once I get my tutorial completed I will show how it\n&gt; &gt; all fits in with REST.  But for now, here&#39;s the question:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to create a REST resource which serves up XML and\nreceives\n&gt; &gt; XML.  For those clients at a browser the XML will be styled into HTML\n&gt; &gt; via an XSLT stylesheet.  Suppose that this styling results in an HTML\n&gt; &gt; form that the user fills in to create a Purchase Order.  After the\nuser\n&gt; &gt; fills in the form he presses &quot;Submit&quot;.  I would like for the Submit\n&gt; &gt; action to result in kicking off some script which harvests the data in\n&gt; &gt; the HTML form, create an XML string from the form data, and then HTTP\n&gt; &gt; PUTs the XML string back to the resource.  That&#39;s where I am stuck.  I\n&gt; &gt; know how to write some Javascript to harvest the form data and create\nan\n&gt; &gt; XML string, but I don&#39;t know how to then HTTP PUT the XML string to\nthe\n&gt; &gt; resource (i.e., server).  Any ideas?  /Roger\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought XForms might have something to say on this -- but after a\n&gt; rather quick look at the spec I can&#39;t see anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/\n&gt;\n&gt; [[\n&gt; XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation\n&gt; of Forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into\n&gt; three parts - data model, instance data, and user interface -\n&gt; it separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives\n&gt; strong typing - reducing the number of round-trips to the\n&gt; server, as well as offering device independence and\n&gt; a reduced need for scripting.\n&gt;\n&gt; XForms is not a free-standing document type, but is intended to\n&gt; be integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML.\n&gt; ]]\n&gt;\n&gt; Guess this doesn&#39;t answer your question Roger, but I&#39;d be interested to\n&gt; hear if anyone here has looked into using XForms, and how it fits with\n&gt; the REST perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Dan\n&gt;\n&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt; Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\n&gt; Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n&gt;\n&gt; iD8DBQE9Tn+uPhXvL3Mij+QRAs9wAJ0bY/0AaOER2bj+USwfDRnGWtrYrwCgqzi5\n&gt; vEzGGuLWf+FltyIYwqPxh5k=\n&gt; =y3d3\n&gt; -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
