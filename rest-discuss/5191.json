However, is it even possible with how browsers are\n&gt; &gt; implemented today.\n&gt; [snip]\n&gt; &gt; Is this a correct interpretation of the Accept header?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. However that doesn&#39;t have to be a bad thing.\n&gt; \nIt is a bad thing.  Let&#39;s say that I am a REST client and I want the\nresource /foo.  The server process cannot distinguish clients based on\nthe MIME type.  Granted the browser is dumb to set the wrong order. \nHowever, it does not solve the problem at hand as that would require a\nnew deployment.\n\n&gt; There is nothing to stop you treating each representation as\n&gt; a resource with a URI. For example, if you have a resource\n&gt; called /foo, have other resources for the representations\n&gt; as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. /foo /foo.html /foo.xml /foo.pdf\n&gt; 2. /foo /foo/html /foo/xml /foo/pdf\n&gt; \nI like this approach, but the problem of how to get the user from /foo\nto /foo.html or /foo/html still exists.  The only way to do an\nintelligent redirect is to look at the User-Agent and then determine\nwhat they really want.  The default for the server would be to\nredirect /foo to /foo.html|/foo/html as a REST client would need coded\nlogic to &quot;fix&quot; the bug.\n\nChristian Gross\n\n\n\n"}}
