But what about when /document/foo is not under your control\n&gt; (i.e., you can&#39;t get/put it)?  This is a similar issue that the\n&gt; activities feed folks are addressing right now.  Likewise, the OAI-ORE\n&gt; effort was all based on creating aggregations of web resources.\n&gt; Brings up interesting issues, I think.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t quite understand the question.  I have to POST to get /document/\nbar?  I approach this as the &quot;mashup&quot; problem.  I have a mishmash of\nremote input, but I want my output in Atom and I want to use my own\ntags.  This is what led me to XML Databases and XQuery.  Most XML DBs\nuse XPATH to locate cells.\n\nSo, create an XML DB cell at /document/bar containing some XQuery code\nthat accesses the remote document and transforms it to Atom, sans\ncategory tags, which are under my site&#39;s control.  I can&#39;t edit the\nremote data, but I can manipulate its metadata as if it were part of my\nmashup site, give it a local comment thread, etc.\n\nEven if I&#39;m making a POST to retrieve remote data, that&#39;s opaque to the\nclient making the GET request on my site, so my API is still REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Your approach (stored search for documents w/ a particular category)\n&gt; gets at something I&#39;ve often said, which it that we need a good\n&gt; standard query mechanism for doing queries with &quot;filter by category&quot;\n&gt; or some such.  I actually like what Google Base specifies in this\n&gt; area.  (I know that opensearch is another effort in this area).\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve been looking at OpenSearch, but haven&#39;t integrated it yet.  Seems\nto make sense for adding to archive feeds, as if they were searches for\n&quot;every post in a given month&quot; etc.  Just add a few elements to my\nexisting Atom output, looks like...\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
