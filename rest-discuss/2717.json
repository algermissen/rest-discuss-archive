Essentially, reverse the roles of client and server.\n&gt; With HTTP, this means putting a port 80 listener on the client and handling\n&gt; PUT or POST.\n\nI actually am considering this for aspects of the system that do not require\nnear real-time notification.  For the real-time stuff though my concern is\nwith\nscalability.  As the number of clients grow, the publisher would end\nup POSTing (synchronously) to large numbers of clients.  Even if I were\nto spin up a bunch of threads to handle this, there could be an intolerable\nlag waiting for responses.\n\nI started to read some of the documentation on the KnowNow.com site, but\nfor some reason I haven&#39;t been able to connect to it for a while,  So\nI may be missing something, but they seemed to indicate that they had\nsome mechanism for doing HTTP POST asynchronously, that is, without\nwaiting for a response.  If true, that seems like an abuse of HTTP. Why\nnot just choose a protocol that is built to be asynchronous?  I&#39;d prefer\nto stick will well supported standards-based tools if possible.\n\nThis seems like a class of problem not well suited for REST - the\nclient-server\naspect of it anyway; I&#39;ll still try to maintain a generic interface, etc.\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n"}}
