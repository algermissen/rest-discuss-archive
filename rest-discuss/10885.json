Other\nmethods are in private use. I do=\r\n not know where you get the notion that\n&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;, and &quot;DELETE&quot; =\r\nare the only methods. After all, you\nsubmitted your question to rest-discus=\r\ns, a forum for discussing the\nRepresentational State Transfer and not much =\r\na forum for discussing\ntricks for dealing with software tools that are brok=\r\nen as designed.\n\n&gt; Example: I want to deactivate a user in a user \n&gt; or emp=\r\nloyee management. With SOAP, RPC or something like that I create a \n&gt; [meth=\r\nod, &quot;deactivate&quot;, and] call it with the user number. How should I model \n&gt; =\r\nthis with REST over HTTP?\n\nWhat is REST over HTTP? It seems that you mean t=\r\nhe use of HTTP in a\nmanner that is as faithful to REST as is possible. Hone=\r\nstly, though, I\nhave a tendency to be wrong when, given wording that is unc=\r\nlear to me, I\npresume what people mean.\n\n&gt; Do I have to GET the full user d=\r\nata (JSON, \n&gt; XML, ...), change the state to &quot;deactivated&quot; and PUT this bac=\r\nk?\n\nThat is a possibility. Roy Fielding would tell you that you could also\n=\r\nsend a request with the method &quot;PATCH&quot;.\n\n&gt; Or should I PUT to the [user&#39;s] =\r\nsub resource /users/1234/status/ the entity \n&gt; &quot;deactivated&quot;?\n\nEven with my=\r\n tendency towards incorrect presumption, I hereby presume\nthat you mean tha=\r\nt you would submit an HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; request for a resource\nrelated to the user=\r\n, where the related resource is the activation status\nof the user and where=\r\n the request has an entity-body that indicates\ndeactivation. I favor such a=\r\nn approach if the user and the activation\nstatus explicitly relate to each =\r\nother via hyperlinks in their\nrepresentations and if the representations ex=\r\nplain or imply, by way of\nthe semantics of the media type of the representa=\r\ntions, the operations\nthat a user agent and its clients must execute to ach=\r\nieve a successful\nresult.\n\n-- \nEtan Wexler.\nPlease do not reply to me when =\r\nreplying to rest-discuss. I read the\nmessages that people send to rest-disc=\r\nuss and I do not want duplicates.\n\n\n"}}
