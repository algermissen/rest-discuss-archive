Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, assigning URIs to variants doesn&#39;t apply to the general case, but it\n&gt; does apply to all other cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI still don&#39;t see any other use cases except the client being able to\ndereference a specific variant or for use with cache. Both of wich are not\nthat important inside a intranet.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; URIs are opaque.  I don&#39;t know how you can tell from just &quot;/A&quot; that it\n&gt; must be a static page?  The answer is that it makes no difference\n&gt; whatsoever to anything I&#39;ve said, whether either of those resources or\n&gt; any other resources I may have tossed out as examples, are static or\n&gt; dynamic.  To a REST connector it&#39;s just a bunch of response bytes, as\n&gt; implementation details are opaque behind the uniform interface.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI know URIs are opaque, I was just pointing to your examples. But my point\nis preciselly that one. If &quot;it&#39;s just a bunch of response bytes&quot;, how can a\nnon-static resource be cached if each time it is dereferenced it will\nprobably have a diferent bunch of bytes? For instance /currentime is allways\ndiferent and so is not cacheable, rigth? What&#39;s the importance then of\nhaving a fixed URI to variants of this resource (if you also consider that\nwe should never allow the client to call specific variants)?\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And also in that example, suppose the client references the /A.html\n&gt; &gt; as a representation of /A, then that manipulation of /A.html has to\n&gt; &gt; be made thru a representation of /A.html, does it make sense to also\n&gt; &gt; assign URI&#39;s to the representation of that representation of /A? I\n&gt; &gt; suppose it depends on the &quot;importance&quot; of those representations?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your terminology is, errr, not so good, so the only chance I have of\n&gt; answering that question is to rewrite it first:\n&gt;\n\nYes, my english is far from good...\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If the user agent dereferences /A and the response is the /A.html\n&gt; variant, then that manipulation of /A.html...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What manipulation of /A.html?  The user agent is dereferencing /A.  The\n&gt; response is a variant with a Content-Location of /A.html, not a\n&gt; Location of /A.html.  There&#39;s only one request-response here, the user\n&gt; agent knows nothing of /A.html because the user agent hasn&#39;t\n&gt; dereferenced /A.html.\n&gt;\n\nOK, I see, the dereferencing of /A.html is made by the server itself, not\nthe user agent, so the user agent never &quot;sees&quot; it?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If the user agent dereferences /A and the response is the /A.html\n&gt; variant, then that manipulation of /A.html has to be made by\n&gt; transferring a representation of /A.html...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t follow.  URIs are opaque, you are deducing an awful lot from\n&gt; some hypothetical example not-really-even-URIs.  The user agent\n&gt; dereferences /A and retrieves instructions on how to render a steady-\n&gt; state, which presents the user with options for transitioning to other\n&gt; application steady-states.\n&gt;\n\nWell, by &quot;manipulation&quot; I was only thinking of GETting it, not to change it.\nI was pointing only that if the variant of /A that we assigned a URI of\n/A.html is a resource on ot&#39;s own that implies that there is also (at least\none)  representation of /A.html that we could wish or not to assign it&#39;s how\nURI, like /A.html.en,  /A.html.pt...\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Does it make sense to also assign URI&#39;s to the variants of the variants\n&gt; of /A?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; None whatsoever.  Why would /A.html have any variants, except for\n&gt; compression?  The entire purpose of assigning URIs to variants is to\n&gt; access them as resources in their own right, tied to a specific media\n&gt; type (which may or may not be expressed as a filename extension), or\n&gt; language, etc.  So the only conneg left to do is compression, if /A.html\n&gt; is dereferenced, which of course is not a given that it will be.\n&gt;\n\nI was thinking about diferent languages for the same resource/variant as my\nprevious example.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless I think to call this &quot;best practice&quot; induces in error\n&gt; &gt; (it did with me) because it&#39;s only applicable to restricted use case.\n&gt; &gt; scenarios.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it applies to every use case except compression, as per the SHOULD\n&gt; in RFC 2616.  Ignoring said SHOULD is a deviation from best practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I&#39;m saying can&#39;t be put any more simply than &quot;assign URIs to your\n&gt; variants, except for compression.&quot;  That&#39;s best practice for the\n&gt; theoretical reason that it&#39;s what RFC 2616 says to do, and for the\n&gt; pragmatic reason that the real-world Web depends on your doing this\n&gt; because that&#39;s how the Web actually works in reality.  Don&#39;t fight it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nWell, that argument of  &quot;that&#39;s how the Web actually works&quot; goes as far as\nit goes. The web actually works with cookies too, that are consensually not\nRESTfull...\n\r\n--0016363b925a4c16b80488c2429e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;As I said, I think I understand the &quot;princi=\r\nple&quot;, but not the necessity of applying it in all situations (except c=\r\nompression).
