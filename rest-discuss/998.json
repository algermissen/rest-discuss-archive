Then the buyer would\n&gt; just DELETE it to cancel the order.\n&gt; \n&gt; If richer cancellation semantics are required, a separate &quot;cancel&quot;\n&gt; document should be used, since I would expect that somebody would\n&gt; want to track that as a separate document.  i.e the buyer POSTs a\n&gt; &quot;cancel order&quot; document which includes a link to the offer resource\n&gt; URI returned on the aforementioned 201 response.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just to indicate more where I am going with this line of inquiry, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; next problem I want to think about is the &quot;counteroffer pending&quot; \n&gt; &gt; response, where the Seller will next make a counteroffer to the \n&gt; &gt; Buyer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does the offer of a counteroffer infer a rejection of the original\n&gt; offer?  I would expect so.  \n\nYes. You understand contract negotiation rules.\n\n&gt; So in that case, the response to the\n&gt; offer document being POSTed could be a rejection document which\n&gt; included a URI to a counteroffer.  Or it could be included inline\n&gt; as part of the rejection.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Where I am trying to go is into the resource model for this \nstuff: \n&gt; &gt; what becomes a Web resource, where?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Everything with identity is a resource.  That doesn&#39;t mean that a\n&gt; representation has to be retrieved with a GET though; it&#39;s fine for \nit\n&gt; to be sent as a request or response, with the Content-Location \nheader\n&gt; included so that the recipient can do a GET later if required.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this case, the initial offer from buyer to seller would be POSTed\n&gt; with a Content-Location header, and the seller *could* invoke GET if\n&gt; they lost their copy 8-) (other cases might have a better use of \nGET).\n\nOk, I am happy with this discussion at this stage.  Thank you very \nmuch. \n\nI am now in the midst of working through this same example with a lot \nmore detail in a couple of ebXML-related work groups.  When they get \ndone, I&#39;ll come back here and see if I can take the various clues and \npropose a RESTful offer-acceptance model that will also satisfy the \nebXML groups.\n\nThen I will invite them to comment.\n\nIn the meantime, I&#39;m still reading most of the list traffic and may \nchip in from the peanut gallery now and then.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
