We keep talking about reach, but  \n&gt; most (if not all?) media types were designed for a specific client.   \n&gt; If not developing an application that is not  &#39;type&#39; of that  \n&gt; original client (say a feed aggregator), I can&#39;t see how the  \n&gt; existing media types (outside of possible html) would not require  \n&gt; some extensions to it (as alluded too by Mike in his examples).  Why  \n&gt; is this extension better than rolling out a new media type if in  \n&gt; both cases, &quot;additional&quot; information needs to be documented?  What  \n&gt; are the practical reasons?  When would a custom media type make sense?\n&gt;\n\nIt is a trade off. You are correctly saying that either way, you need  \nadditional semantics. Using existing types with extensions makes it  \npossible to use existing tools. For example, for debugging. It is a  \nhuge benefit if you can view your HTML+microformats orders in a  \nbrowser to see what is going on or to subscribe to the collection of  \nlatest orders with a feed reader. However, managing extensions is  \nsomewhat difficult because you are constantly dealing with a set of  \nindependent stuff that constitutes some contract but yet has no name.\n\nI like using a profile notion for this kind of &#39;media type  \nsubclassing&#39;. The profile URI provides a nice &#39;handle&#39; for the  \nsemantics established by the set of extensions. You can use a profile  \nfor conneg like this\n\nAccept: text/html;profile=&quot;http://foo-company.org/profiles/simple-order-uf-profile\n\nto tell the server that the client expects a certain &#39;kind of html&#39;.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
