So I thought this would interest you. :-)\n\n---\n\nThere will be a Social Web Camp in Sun Offices in Santa Clara on  \nMonday November 2. It&#39;s is being hosted by SUN Microsystems and  \norganized by Henry Story and Daniel Appelquist of Vodafone, co-chair  \nof the W3C Social Web XG.\n\nImagine a world where everybody could participate easily in a  \ndistributed yet secure social web. In such a world people could place  \ntheir photos, music, or other content on their web site and give  \naccess to some of it to their friends, some to their family, the rest  \nto their colleagues, and some even to the friends of their friends...  \nHow can one do this without requiring every participant to create one  \nlogin for each of their friends site? How does one do this in a  \ndistributed and flexible manner compatible with web architecture? What  \nissues would need to be solved to make this possible?\n\nAll topics related to the Social Web will be covered, in a bar-camp  \nstyle. It will be broad and open to all types of participants. See the  \nsubjects\nup for discussuion on the wiki/registration page:\n\nhttp://barcamp.org/SocialWebCamp-Santa-Clara\n\nWhen: Monday, 2nd of November starting 9:00 am ( up to 5pm )\n\nWhere:\n\tThe Auditorium at Sun&#39;s Campus,\n\t4030 George Sellon Circle\n\tSanta Clara,\n\t95054 California\n\nPlease forward to interested parties, tweet, blog!\n\nHenry Story\n\nSocial Web Architect\nSun Microsystems\t\t\nBlog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish\n\n\n"}}
