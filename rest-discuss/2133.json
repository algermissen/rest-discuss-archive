I notice I&#39;ve misspelled my name, so I want to\n&gt; correct that on the PO.  I could PUT a corrected copy of the whole PO, but what method do\n&gt; I use if I only want to send the name field?  The name is &quot;subordinate&quot; to the PO, but this is\n&gt; not an append type operation, and it happens to be idempotent, too.  If I use an XML PO\n&gt; document with only the name field used, should that be a PUT, or is it always assumed that\n&gt; PUT carries the full state of the addressed resource?\n\nYup, the full state needs to go in a PUT.\n\nYou could negotiate name-changing behaviour such that a POST of a\nrepresentation of a name to the document resulted in the change, but\nthat&#39;s extra work for little benefit, as I see it.\n\nYou could also give the name its own URI, and do a PUT on it, but that\nhas its own problems; that the PO is a contract, and so should be\nself-contained.  In other non-contract cases, this might be ok.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
