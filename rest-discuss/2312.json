I have automated tools \nwhich can automagically generate the REST code given an object&#39;s \nclass. Also note that SOAP services are stateless. By definition they \nare not objects. Resources have states and they expose methods \n(DoGet, DoPut, DoDelete, DoPost, DoTrace, DoOptions) which constitute \nbehavior. After having done a lot of SOAP and REST hacking it&#39;s \nevident to me and my team that REST is far more object oriented than \nSOAP. In REST you work with real objects, in SOAP you&#39;re essentially \nworking with a class that defines arbitrary static methods.\n\n&gt; With RPC, you can&#39;t just take any file system/database/directory \nservice and\n&gt; turn it into an easily used, interoperable network \naccessible &#39;thing&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
