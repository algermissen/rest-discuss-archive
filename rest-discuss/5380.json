And the\n&gt; fact of the matter is that there&#39;s *lots* of websites that support\n&gt; the equivalent of PUT and DELETE operations without actually using\n&gt; them.  While its nice to think this problem might be solved by new\n&gt; browsers, that&#39;s not really a viable option in the short term.\n\nREST is a style of interaction that produces certain properties\nthat we want out of a system.  The Web is an implementation, some\nof which is standardized (the good stuff) and some of which was\nhacked-in by folks who were just trying to make a customer happy.\nWe can&#39;t work around an architecture -- we leave it as soon as\nthe attempt is made.  To work around browser bugs, just fix the\nstupid bugs or use a better browser.\n\nI am amazed by how few people bother to point out Apache httpd\nbugs that interfere with REST, even when they know I can fix them\nonce I know they exist and why they need to change.\n\nThe only reason the browsers haven&#39;t been fixed is because the\npeople who want them fixed haven&#39;t tried.  I&#39;ve been too busy\nand don&#39;t have a machine that will compile Firefox.  If people\nwould spend less time trying to convince Web Services to do what\nthey don&#39;t want to do and more time simply helping Web browser\ndevelopers fix their bugs, maybe we could make some progress.\n\nIf someone here patches Firefox and Ernie applies some peer\npressure on Safari, I am quite certain that I can guilt the\nMSIE developers into fixing it as well.  Just come up with a\nsimple statement of what needs fixing and why.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
