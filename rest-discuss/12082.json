Also in Roy Fielding’s case, which leaves little\nwiggle room for turning this into a matter of consensus.\n\n&gt; But do you agree that there are applications where returning an\n&gt; exhaustive list of potential next state transitions in a\n&gt; representation is just not feasible?  As per my original post,\n&gt; how do you handle applications of this kind?\n\nURI templates or forms (which are basically the same thing).\n\n&gt; It seems to me that in cases like this this there will have to\n&gt; be a deterministic, programmatic method of producing URIs based\n&gt; on some kind of template or documentation or something else.\n\nExactly. But the template must be provided by the server in\nhypermedia, not hardwired into the client on a per-app basis.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
