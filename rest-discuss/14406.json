This markup\nis the state-of-the-art solution to the problem of human-readable and\nmachine-readable tabular data:\n\nhttp://www.ferg.org/section508/accessible_tables.html\n\nThe author is given a choice between different machine-readability\n(accessibility) algorithms.  The chosen algorithm is machine-\ndiscoverable via introspection.  Tabular data for a shopping cart may be\nadditionally marked up using RDFa and the GoodRelations ontology, but\nnone of this should be included in a Resource Model, I don&#39;t think.\n\nAll I know going in, is that I want the most semantically-rich markup I\ncan write to describe the tabular data inherent to a shopping cart\napplication, using a standard media type like application/xhtml+xml or\ntext/html.  But these implementation details aren&#39;t the place to start,\nbecause I haven&#39;t modeled any resources to guide me.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
