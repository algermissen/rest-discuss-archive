This isn&#39;t possible with markup at the moment - you  \n&gt;&gt; have to use the URI for conneg or make use of Javascript - both of  \n&gt;&gt; which are unnecessary if you have this optional Accept attribute.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. But I think this may introduce some peculiarities for web  \n&gt; developers. Consider some cases:\n&gt;\n&gt; a. Bookmarked URIs: Need to use agent-driven negotiation since the  \n&gt; server can&#39;t influence Accept* headers yet.\n&gt;   \n\nIf a bookmark stored the URI and the Accept  headers, would that not be \nsufficient? Is a bookmark not just a stored state? Are request headers \noutside of that state?\n\n&gt; b. Links for which the UA can support server&#39;s recommended Accept*  \n&gt; headers. This is the happy path.\n&gt;   \n\nYes, also, a server doesn&#39;t have to honor the accept header and respond \nwith an appropriate content type - so that case would need to be \naccounted for aswell. This is no different from URI conneg.\n\nThis way, there is also potential for security measures in browsers \nwhereby a response that does not correspond to the Accept header in the \nrequest can be dealt with as suspicious. This is not achievable to the \nsame extent if the conneg is in the URI because there is no standard way \nof doing it in the URI, e.g.:\n\n/page.html\n/page;type=html\n/page?content-type=text/html\n\nThis is a minor point, but a &#39;benefit&#39; of protocol level conneg none the \nless! :)\n\n&gt; c. Links for which the UA can not support server&#39;s recommendations.  \n&gt; This is like case A.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nGenerally speaking, most browsers (HTML reading UAs), will do something \nwith a content type that they don&#39;t support - i.e. retrieve and store \nthe data. I might need my browser to download some content-type it \ndoesn&#39;t support, like mp3 or zip.\n\n\n&gt; Case (b) is where the server can use media-type-free URIs, which can  \n&gt; streamline cache flushing. On that note, the proposal makes sense.\n&gt;   \n\nI don&#39;t think developers will ever be encouraged to use media-type-free \nURIs until browsers and markup support that process.\n\nThanks for your feedback\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
