Easiest thing in the world in HTML, right?\n&gt; [hvw] (You&#39;re violating the semantics of GET. The ground rules ought to be\n&gt; we&#39;re going to play within HTTP. The delete operation is probably\n&gt; idempotent\n&gt; but by any reasonable standard you&#39;re not returning a representation of\n&gt; the\n&gt; resource at &quot;/article/delete.php?id=737&quot;.)\n\nI completely agree with you.\n\nI guess it should be left as an interface-specific decision.\n\nThe reason why I avoided non-GET all the time is because it&#39;s not trivial\nto do so in a non-HTML Form environment, such as in PHP, in old XMLHTTP\n(JavaScript, ActiveX, etc.), in CGI scripts.\n\nIt&#39;s like the &quot;be conservative in what you emit, be liberal in what you\naccept&quot; philosophy. For something to be widely acceptable then you should\ndesign it so it&#39;s supportable by the majority, but of course there are\nalways tradeoff between them, in our case it&#39;s tradeoff between (I guess)\nimplementability and semantic conformance.\n\ne.g. If you want to retrieve data dynamically using JavaScript without\nrefreshing the page, there are at least these choices:\n1. &lt;img&gt;\n2. &lt;script&gt;\n3. &lt;iframe&gt;\n4. DOMDocument.load\n5. XMLHTTPRequest\n\nThe most semantically valid way would be to use XMLHttpRequest, but this\nthing is so new it only works on the latest versions of IE and Mozilla. It\ndoesn&#39;t even work in Opera. This is bad, considering that majority of the\nbrowsers used in this planet is IE 5.0 (http://awstats.gauldong.net).\n\nSo a developer would use iframe, even script, even IMG tags to load a\nscript! Imagine that! That is *SOOO* violation, but believe me it works\n(even in IE 4.0 browsers or maybe older!!) and remote scripting sites are\ndescribing this technique.\n\nAnyway as I have stated before it&#39;s an interface-specific decision... What\nI described here is only my personal reasons why GET is good for\nacceptability and implementability point of view, and I hereby acknowledge\nthat using GET for non-read-only operations are *very* bad in terms of\nsemantics.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
