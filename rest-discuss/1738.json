However, a problem one encounters in a loosely coupled system\n&gt; is tha=\r\nt we don&#39;t always know which push verb to use.  This is why I include\n&gt; the=\r\n PUT operation.  This allows the source to &quot;loosely&quot; send data to the\n&gt; tar=\r\nget.\n&gt; \n&gt; I should also point out that the verbs chosen in GTP are not rela=\r\nted to HTTP\n&gt; verbs in any way, though a few are named the same.\n\nSeairth, =\r\nI don=B9t mean to stir the pot, but what you&#39;ve just described *is*\nsemanti=\r\ncally equivalent to HTTP.  It seems to me that you only differ on the\ndetai=\r\nl and &quot;syntax,&quot; not the high-level semantics.  To wit:\n\nGTP       HTTP\n----=\r\n--    -----\nGET       GET\nDELETE    DELETE\nEDIT      PUT or POST\nADD       =\r\nPUT or POST\nPUT       xxx response code\n\nThe major exception seems to be th=\r\nat you have a notion of a &quot;response\nmethod&quot; indicated by PUT.  I&#39;m not sure=\r\n what that buys you, really.\n\nConsider:  HTTP PUT creates / replaces / upda=\r\ntes the state of a resource\ngiven some data (representation) of the desired=\r\n resource state.  When\nperformed on an enclosing container resource, this c=\r\nan be considered an ADD.\nSimilarly, when performed on any existing resource=\r\n, it&#39;s an EDIT.  Your PUT,\nin the backchannel case, is basically equivalent=\r\n to (a single, nonspecific)\nHTTP response code --- truthfully, it doesn&#39;t s=\r\nerve much purpose at all,\nbecause subsequent information would be needed to=\r\n discern the actual intent\n/ meaning of the resource.\n\nIn general, your mod=\r\nel - as with HTTP applications that use PUT - seems to\nwork with a less abs=\r\ntract notion of resource than i.e. applications that\nencapsulate resource s=\r\ntate behind GET and POST;  with POST-based apps, you\ncan&#39;t ever actually se=\r\nt the state of a resource directly, at best you ask\nthe resource or its con=\r\ntainer to do that for you.  You never GET resource\nstate directly, you mere=\r\nly get a representation.  And that encapsulation is\na good thing.  Your mod=\r\nel is actually weaker than HTTP, because it doesn&#39;t\naccommodate the more ab=\r\nstract application of POST, meaning &quot;feed some\narbitrary data to a resource=\r\n&quot; with the resource itself being responsible for\nthe interpretation.  (If P=\r\nUT is a valid GTP *request* method, then GTP isn&#39;t\nweaker --- it&#39;s semantic=\r\nally equivalent, as originally asserted.)\n\nSimilarly, I&#39;m not sure what ONX=\r\n buys you over XML.  In both cases\n(GTP/HTTP, ONX/XML) the differences seem=\r\n superficial at best.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to dis your effort, but it&#39;s worth aski=\r\nng whether your effort\nwouldn&#39;t be better spent trying to get what you want=\r\n to do done with HTTP\nand XML rather than reinventing them.  We see further=\r\n when we stand on the\nshoulders of giants. :-)\n\n$0.02,\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
