That said, I must confess I need\n&gt; some clarification on a few points (if the group will indulge me):\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Some material on REST seems to reserve POST for &quot;create&quot; and PUT\n&gt; for &quot;update&quot; while others seem to blur the distinction.  Any insight\n&gt; here would be most helpful.\n\nPOST is more general than create, and in fact even PUT can create a\nresource.  &quot;create&quot;, AFAICT, emerged from the desire for some to fit\nthe new &quot;uniform interface&quot; into the concept of &quot;CRUD&quot;, which is well\nunderstood.\n\n&gt; 2) The writings seem to direct one away from using the query string as\n&gt; much as possible.  While it is clear that .../somecgi.pl?action=delete\n&gt; is most unREST-ful I assume .../invoice?id=3224 is OK to refer to\n&gt; particular invoice (for example)?  I&#39;m confused by the apparent\n&gt; alternative URI to do the same thing .../invoice/3224  If the latter\n&gt; is preferable, why is that - especially when this seems to embody\n&gt; &quot;Common REST Mistake #3&quot;?  In short, when does one use the query\n&gt; string versus the .../container/contained notation?\n\nI always opt for hierarchy when that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing, i.e. when the\nlifecycle of the contained is controlled by the container.  But\nsometimes, when I need a browser interface to those resources, and due\nto the limitations of HTML forms, I *also* present a query interface to\nthe contained resources, typically returning a representation which\nincludes the URIs sans query-term.\n\n&gt; 3) Does seems REST assumes the user will create a URI parser from\n&gt; scratch?  The writings seem to call for a &quot;central xml file&quot; to do\n&gt; this.  Do libwww-perl, Waterken, Cocoon, sqlREST enter in here? Could\n&gt; someone comment on this a bit more?\n\nI&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean, but it doesn&#39;t sound like something\nthat&#39;s dictated by REST, nor any architectural style for that matter.\n\n&gt; 4) I&#39;m unclear as how a PUT works.  If we take PUT to mean &quot;update&quot;\n&gt; the resource, does one simply send the updated representation of the\n&gt; resource in a PUT request to the server?\n\nYup.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
