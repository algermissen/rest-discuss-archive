They are customer.ben.com and shop.ben.com. \n\ncustomer.ben.com is =\r\nused to manage the customers details and purchase\nhistory. For example, aft=\r\ner authentication, GETting the URL\ncustomer.ben.com/purchasehistory/ return=\r\ns an XML message containing a\nlist of references to another REST service ca=\r\nlled library.ben.com\n(which  manages the downloads and management of files)=\r\n.\n\nshop.ben.com is used to manage purchase requests and integrates the\npaym=\r\nent service gateway for billing etc;\n\nSo, two REST services: one manages a =\r\ncustomers purchase history, the\nother manages purchases.\n\nWhen a purchase i=\r\ns made using shop.ben.com, shop.ben.com needs to\nupdate the purchase histor=\r\ny of customer.ben.com. My current plan is to\n create a new User Group calle=\r\nd &quot;SERVICE&quot;, and give each REST Service\na username and password. That way, =\r\nthey can use normal REST methods to\nmanipulate each other. For example:\n\nFo=\r\nr shop.ben.com to add a new item to the purchase history of the\ncustomer, s=\r\nhop.ben.com does this:\n\nPOST\nshopuser:password@.../[customer-n=\r\name]/purchase-history/\n&lt;XML-payload-here/&gt;\n\ncustomer.ben.com then authentic=\r\nates shop.ben.com, and allows it to \naccess the script at that address usin=\r\ng that method.\n\nTo allow the customer to download the file after purchasing=\r\n, the\nclient requests:\n\nGET user:password@.../purchase-history=\r\n/\n\nwhich returns a list of items they have purchased. Following the link\nfr=\r\nom one of the items points to:\n\nGET user:password@.../files/file1\n\n=\r\nWhich, in turn, calls:\n\nGET\nlibuser:password@.../[customer-nam=\r\ne]/purchase-history/[file1]\n\nIf the response is &quot;200 OK&quot;, lib.ben.com begin=\r\ns the download. If the\nresponse is &quot;404 Not Found&quot;, we know that the user h=\r\nasn&#39;t purchased\nthe file yet.\n\n\nWhew!\n\nMy question (finally) is, this seems=\r\n to me to be the REST way of\nintegrating different serices. Am I right? My =\r\nmain concern is scaling:\nwill this scale? I need to have the ability to hor=\r\nizontally scale each\nof these seperate services by simply adding another no=\r\nde. \n\nI&#39;ve thought that maybe replacing the overall user-group SERVICE with=\r\n\nspecific user-groups based on specific service types, for example\nLIB-SERV=\r\nICE, CUSTOMER-SERVICE and SHOP-SERVICE, thus allowing me to\ngive each node =\r\na seperate username and password.This would allow me to\ntrack which specifi=\r\nc node connected and performed the transaction.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Ha=\r\ns anyone had any experience in building a\nnetwork using REST to scale like =\r\nthis (aside from, obviously, the\ninternet itself :) )\n\nKinda an open questi=\r\non really: I&#39;ve &quot;got the REST religeon&quot; big-time,\nand want to actually impl=\r\nement something that illustrates the\npossibilities.\n\nI look forward to your=\r\n replies!\n\nCheers,\n\nBen Davies\n\n\n\n\n"}}
