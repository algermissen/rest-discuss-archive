The complex processing goes through a\nlot more changes than the user entry form, so we need to do automated\nregression testing.\n\nWe separated the back-end processing from the resource that saves the\nuser entries.  Then, for testing we save the user entries without any\nprocessing as test suites.  We then copy off the test suites into\narchives so they can be re-used for regression testing.\n\nThen we have a program that takes the test suite entries and runs them\nthrough the back-end processing programs.\n\nWe also save and package correct test results so we can check\nregression test runs against them. Plus we got one algorithmic result\nconsistency checker.\n\nAll of the test suite entry, processing and correctness checking are\ndone by business domain experts collaborating with end users.  And\nthey use the same forms for creating test entries as for normal app\nuse.\n\nMight not work for anybody else, and it&#39;s off the track of xUnit, FIT\nand Selenium, in other words, no ready-made tools. But it works for\nus.\n\n"}}
