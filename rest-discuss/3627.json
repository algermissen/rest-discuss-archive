RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.\nAlthough a system based on REST may use RPC to accomplish the job, REST is\ndifferent from RPC in that it is not an &#39;extensible procedures&#39; type of\napproach. In fact, it is the opposite - &#39;limited set of procedures&#39; is the\ngoal.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. REST is about server holds state is stateless, with SOAP you can do\n&gt;    that, but its not a dogma.\nI&#39;m not sure I understand the grammar of the sentence, but REST isn&#39;t about\none side or the other &#39;holding&#39; state - its about the transfer of whatever\nstate you do have between the components.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. So REST versus SOAP is a meaningless distinction.\nREST is architecture, SOAP is technology. You can build REST based systems\nwith SOAP. But if everybody builds their own unique (non-interoperable) REST\nbased system, then that aggregate larger system becomes unRESTful.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. REST is about resources that you can access by an URI. No\n&gt;    implication that it is better or easier human or machine readable.\nREST is about resources you can identify. Using a URI is the Web way of\ndoing things. An RDBMS has another way of identifying resources that does\nnot use URI (to the extent that an RDBMS has aspects of REST). A particular\nimplementation system would use a protocol to actually access the resource.\nFor example, HTTP as a protocol can be used to access resources that are not\nidentified via the &#39;http&#39; URI scheme.\n\n----example request----\nGET mailto:mdierken@...
