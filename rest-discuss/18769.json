As\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stated in the =\r\narticle, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; developer may need=\r\n to do some extra work to get there. What we are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; looking for is evalua=\r\nting the frameworks in a way that helps the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; framework makers and the u=\r\nsers to identify the needs and solutions. It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is like suggesting a tool=\r\n and testing it in the field for tuning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s quite normal that peo=\r\nple use those levels as ranking. I think it would\n&gt; &gt; make the intention mu=\r\nch clearer if you would create a matrix instead of\n&gt; &gt; using these (maturit=\r\ny) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for routing\n&gt; &gt; and media type=\r\ns whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t d=\r\no that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and 5??\n&gt; &gt; Is it=\r\n then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it&#39;s too late to\n&gt; &gt; ch=\r\nange that as the article has already been published..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Markus Lanthaler\n&gt; &gt; @markuslanthaler\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
