In fact, SQL has\nmany RESTful aspects - it&#39;s a uniform interface for lots of kinds of data\nwith a small number of common verbs.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC? \nThe SQL expression of &quot;WHERE user_id in (&#39;bnewport&#39;,&#39;jackwilson&#39;)&quot; is a\nsingle &quot;resource identifier&quot; which encompasses multiple entities, and you\ncould alternatively phrase that in URI-speak as\n&quot;http://billy.com/people?user_id=bnewport,jackwilson&quot; - the actual\nimplementation of that resource might or might not be accomplished with a\nrelational database and SQL statements.\n\n\n&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records \n&gt; per server interaction and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than \n&gt; I could solve it using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case.\nHTTP deals with resources, so just define your resources to encompass\nmultiple records.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see lots of \n&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol. \n&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\nThrough using a stateless approach, HTTP opened up many more possible\napplications than a &#39;begin, update, commit&#39; style protocol. That is one of\nthe premises of REST as an architectural style. It&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a\nfeature.\nIf you require transactions, then each request in a RESTful system would be\nthe unit of work - an ACID transaction would not cross that request\nboundary. You can do such things as asynchronous replies upon completion of\nthat initial transactional request, but that&#39;s not at all a &#39;begin, update,\ncommit&#39; pattern.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
