The original site would need to check availability\nand respond back to the buyer with problems, which could also cause\nrace conditions and vicious circles.  Not a pretty picture.\n\nIs there a RESTful way to handle this situation?\n\nSomething vaguely like this, but on steroids?\nhttp://wiki.activitystrea.ms/Actions\nhttp://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Action_Links\n\n"}}
