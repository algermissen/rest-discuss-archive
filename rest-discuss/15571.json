AJAX does stand for &quot;Asynchronous Javvascript and XML&quot; doesn&#39;t it?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; How exactly would you say it&#39;s RESTful and not RPC? YOu are basically using zipcheck as a method with ziptext being passed along the query string.\n&gt;  \n\nDoes the user agent need to know about any kind of out-of-band information to do what it is intended to do? All the user agent does in Mike&#39;s example is to properly react on received hypermedia - there is no RPC involved.\n\nBeware that all that matters with regard to REST is the interaction between the components that constitute an application (user agent, origin server, intermediaries, data elements). IOW, REST as an architectural style constrains the architectire in which these components and data elements exist and interact. Whatever the user of the user agent thinks or understands is completely out of scope.\n\nUI-based user agents are somewhat misleading when learning REST because we take them and their behavior for granted. The servcer side seems to realize the application but in fact, the user agent component (the browser) plays an equally important part.\n\nConsider how the browser understands (by implementing HTML) how to construct the appropriate request when the user activates (submits) a form. It does so on the basis of standardized hypermedia semantics, not based on knowing some instruction specific to the server it currently interacts with. The former is REST, the latter would be RPC.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 10:18 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; REST places no restrictions on UI behavior including responsiveness or interactivity. \n&gt; \n&gt; I start many REST/HTTP talks w/ a very simple example app to illustrate this very point:\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/examples/zipcheck/\n&gt; \n&gt; Instant user feedback w/o AJAX (or RPC).\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Jun 7, 2010 at 00:51, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You really think people are going to say &quot;Woo hoo I am using HTTP Type 1&quot; ? :-)\n&gt;  \n&gt; REST sounds cool...that&#39;s why they like it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On your second point, I am not sure. That makes the argument that RPC over HTTP is absolutely bad. Even though I can see the value that a RESTful style provides, I don&#39;t see why a person building an AJAX style application who uses RPC over HTTP as a means to improve responsiveness is in itself a bad thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I personally worked on quite a few RPC over HTTP style AJAX apps where the goal was improving responsiveness in the application and to offer a rich client type experience in a brower. Yes it dishonors hypermedia constraints (we didn&#39;t even know what those were), but it worked and made paying customers pretty happy that they had a more interactive / responsive UI. That was the primary goal and the benefit. I don&#39;t think we were deluded into any other benefits.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you see that as &quot;wrong&quot;?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Personally I feel like calling that REST is wrong, in the way calling some that is not an implementation of MVC, MVC.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 9:04 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Glenn,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 7, 2010, at 12:10 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Darrel and I were chatting and we started to discuss the problem of using &quot;RPC over HTTP&#39; to mean &quot;REST&quot;. The result of that conversation seemed to be that the problem is the usage of the term &#39;REST&#39; in that nothing about RPC over HTTP is RESTful in nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think one of the big problems in this area is the lack of proper names for all the various abuses of REST. Having names helps to differentiate. I created a classification of mis-uses a while back: http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My argument, the fact that folks want to use HTTP as a pure transport for loose XML/JSON in itself is not a problem asd long as one has proper expectations about the pros/cons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but the problem being the end of the sentence: &quot;as long as one has proper expectations&quot;. I seriously doubt that a significant number of people understand the trade offs (if they did, they would just do true REST because the gains outweigh (IMHO small) the additional effort).\n&gt; \n&gt; While there might not be a problem if you understand what you are doing, it also makes no real sense to do it (it is not really justifiable).\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That led me to think of a new term to represent the &quot;RPC over HTTP&quot; movement and which is along the spirit of the whole &quot;No SQL&quot; mantra.  &quot;No SOAP&quot; - the meaning of which is &quot;Not Only SOAP&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LIke it or hate it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Glenn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt;  Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
