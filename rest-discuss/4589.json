Thanks, Hugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; What sort of &quot;client&quot; application could you be talking about, other \n&gt; than some thin-client - like a web-browser or directory explorer - which\n&gt; doesn&#39;t expect to be doing any processing?  I wouldn&#39;t expect to be \n&gt; able to point at some arbitrary resource and get anything done.\n\nWell, not anything, at least not yet.  But in the context of what REST&#39;s\nconstraints alone enable, you can, for example, get data from all\nresources (at least those that answer GET, which is practically all of\nthem).  wget and curl are examples of (largely) RESTful clients, as are\nspiders, proxies, etc..\n\n&gt; What you&#39;ve outlined seems to go way beyond what Fielding defines\n&gt; &quot;substitutability&quot; to be.\n\nI don&#39;t think so.\n\n&gt; &gt; But at least the architectural\n&gt; &gt; ideal has been identified, which permits one to more easily see the\n&gt; &gt; tradeoffs being made with alternate solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; You seem to be saying that any client-side application that is\n&gt; hard-coded\n&gt; to process a specific response ideally should use a new method.\n\nTo be self-descriptive by describing its expectations in the message,\nyes.\n\n&gt;  How is\n&gt; this any different from RPC then?\n\nIt&#39;s not.  Erm, well, it&#39;s actually *worse* than RPC; it&#39;s non\nself-descriptive RPC.  That was my point when I responded to Roy saying\nthat it&#39;s a slippery slope towards services specific interfaces, even\nif previous information gathered from the server told a client something\nabout the service which provided this expectation, and even if the\nclient&#39;s resultant message had this expectation marked a mandatory\nextension.  I believe that such communication should be constrained to\ninforming the client of *extended* expectations, not entirely new\nnon-uniform semantics.\n\nFWIW, I&#39;ve spent an unhealthy amount of time pondering, specifying[2],\nand implementing[3], the intricacies of this exact issue over the past\nthree or so years, so I&#39;m fairly confident I&#39;m on solid ground.  Then\nagain, Roy&#39;s ripped me a new one on more than one occasion. 8-) ... in\nfact, what lead me to begin my investigation was one such ripping[4].\n8-)\n\n [1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/\n [2] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/\n [3] http://www.nanometrics.ca/images/PDF%20files/Taurus2.pdf\n [4] http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-September/004712.html\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
