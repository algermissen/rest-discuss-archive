Fielding wrote:\n&gt; I might write another book some day, assuming I ever get in the  \n&gt; swing of\n&gt; writing on a regular basis (and ignoring email). I doubt that I would\n&gt; call it a REST book, though it would contain REST. I am sure the\n&gt; publisher would try to market it that way anyway.\n\nSo this is perhaps a good (if dangerous :-) time to ask what Roy and  \nthe rest of you (no pun intended) think of Leonard&#39;s new book proposal:\n\nhttp://www.crummy.com/2006/11/03/1\n&gt; I got the idea for a REST book when I started seriously trying to  \n&gt; figure out what was and wasn&#39;t REST. I noticed that though certain  \n&gt; best practices showed up repeatedly in REST folklore, they never  \n&gt; really progressed beyond that point. I decided to write a book that  \n&gt; would set down the folklore and hopefully create some new canon,  \n&gt; some common ground.\nhttp://www.crummy.com/writing/REST-Web-Services/\n\n&gt; This is the book that puts the &quot;web&quot; back into &quot;web services&quot;. You  \n&gt; can design a web service that uses HTTP, XHTML, and URIs. You just  \n&gt; need to understand REST, the architecture of the web. REST Web  \n&gt; Services gives you the tools you need to argue for sensible web  \n&gt; services, and the strategies and code you need to create them.\nLeonard is may be overly-self-congratulatory (perhaps with deliberate  \nirony), but it sounds like there is a lot of demand for such a  \nthing.  Whether there is a &quot;need&quot; for this book in particular is  \nperhaps a more difficult question. :-)\n\nStill, Leonard is actively soliciting feedback, so this is a chance  \nfor y&#39;all to put your money where your mouth is...\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\n"}}
