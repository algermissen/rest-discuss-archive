The controller of resource can say:\n\n  nicferrier can READ this resource\n\n  jonnydepp can READ and WRITE this resource \n\n  keiraknightley can READ, WRITE and FLOUNCE with this resource\n\nThis obviously requires authentication.\n\nBut there&#39;s also the possibility that you could say:\n\n  EVERYONE can READ this resource\n\n\nBecause this is more complex than normal authentication I&#39;m\nconsidering using 403 (Forbidden) instead of 401 to signal resource\naccess failure.\n\nWhat are people&#39;s reactions to that?\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
