It is particularly incompatible with\n    Alex&gt; PUT/POST because the server has no way to tell the client\n    Alex&gt; what types may be PUT/POST and REST provides no way to\n    Alex&gt; understand what was meant when a client does so.\n\nA GET with Content-Type rest/content-types can solve this perhaps?\n\nA server can always accepts content types it understands and issue a\n4xx when it doesn&#39;t of course.\n\n\nI&#39;m afraid that meta modeling doesn&#39;t solve any problem. The next\nproblem is usually the meta meta model of that. And the meta meta meta\nmodel of that.\n\n-- \nRegards,\n\nBerend. (-:\n\n\n"}}
