In fact, all\nwell-formed URI are identical except inasmuch as dereferencing different\nones yields different representations.  By this reasoning, http://12345\nwould be just as good, because the &quot;information&quot; carried in the hierarchical\npart cannot be considered in interpreting the URI (except by the server that\nhas that very interpretation as its primary function.)  Now, nobody believes\nall that, but that&#39;s the literal interpretation of the various axioms, etc.\n\nModerate answer:  They&#39;re equivalent, use whichever one tickles your fancy.\n\nRadical answer --- my own opinion.  Wherever there&#39;s hierarchy in your\nresource model, it should be reflected in your URIs.  If &quot;something&quot; is (a)\na container for items, (b) an object of interest in its own right, and if\nitems are objects of interest in their own rights that are contained by\n&quot;something,&quot; then the strictly hierarchical form is preferable.\n\nIn addition, it&#39;s worth noting that overuse of query strings to convey what\ncould be represented as hierarchical structure causes proxies / caches and\nother intermediaries or agents to do more work or, at worst, to fail\nentirely.  It should be possible to compare URIs for determination of\nequivalence (something that proxies, crawlers, and the like do all the time)\nby a simple lexical test.  Use of nonordinal keyword-based query strings\nmesses this up;  it&#39;s impossible to determine the difference (or lack\nthereof) of\n\nhttp://server.com/container?item=itemname&color=red\nhttp://server.com/container?color=red&item=itemname\n\nWithout requiring the proxy etc. to interpret the query string;  and indeed,\nit&#39;s not possible for proxies to do that reliably, because the resource\nimplementation could either require ordinality or not, and there&#39;s no way to\ntell.  The safest thing for the proxy etc. to do is ignore all URIs with\nquery strings and, indeed, some have in the past;  .: use query strings\nsparingly if at all, and if you do try to discriminate based on only a\nsingle property / param / value.\n\nJb\n\n\n\n"}}
