Now, provided that both hosts have access to a chunk of \n&gt; shared memory, a cookie containing an index / key into this shared \n&gt; memory space can be set on a client machine. This shared memory space \n&gt; could be anything from a simple file on a network filesystem to a full \n&gt; blown, linda-like tuplespace. In any case, the data indexed by the \n&gt; clients&#39; cookie may indicate whether a user has logged in or any number \n&gt; of other related bits such as user preferences, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a number of variations on the above scheme, depending on the \n&gt; technologies used, but the basic idea remains the same. A more elegant \n&gt; appproach would be to have this shared memory space itself be a web \n&gt; server, exposing this functionality as a service via a RESTful \n&gt; interface. Actaully, the use of cookies turns out to be more of a \n&gt; hinderance than anything else, as it limits the usefulness of the \n&gt; approach to hosts within the same domain. Using dynamically constructed \n&gt; URLs, the above technique can be applied /across domains/, provided the \n&gt; necessary prior arrangements are made between the respective domain \n&gt; administrators.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, ultimately, this isn&#39;t really about single sign-on across different \n&gt; hosts in the same domain, or even across hosts in different domains, as \n&gt; much as it is about coordination patterns among distributed actors.\n\nI wrote a RESTfull SSO mechanism (based on OASIS&#39; SSO stuff) for\nThomson plc. If it would be of any use I could give the details here.\n\nI was thinking of submitting it to OASIS as an appedix to their spec.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
