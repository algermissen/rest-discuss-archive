Pragmatically, everything I mention about the\nease of developing an=\r\nd maintaining a system built around standard Web\nmedia types applies just a=\r\ns much for intranets as it does on the Web,\neven if REST only requires it f=\r\nor the Web.  Common sense must prevail.\n\nYou&#39;re right, sending it outside t=\r\nhe house will require using XSLT or\nsomesuch to convert it to an appropriat=\r\ne media type for the Web.  And\nyeah, it&#39;s a tradeoff.  Routine tradeoffs li=\r\nke having to write and\nmaintain a script or some XSLT are hardly limited to=\r\n REST development,\nthough, so you&#39;re off-topic.  The tradeoffs of violating=\r\n a REST\nconstraint by *not* transforming an in-house media type for use ove=\r\nr\nthe Web, is what matters here.\n\nIt is a feature of the style that a gatew=\r\nay can perform such a task,\nso that it won&#39;t impact on the in-house system.=\r\n  Which would be\nenough of a benefit to completely moot the issue of having=\r\n to maintain\nan XSLT stylesheet.  Discussing such implementation details ca=\r\nn only\nserve to cloud the issue, since we only care about what passes betwe=\r\nen\nconnectors, not how it&#39;s derived.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
