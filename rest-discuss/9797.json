Instead of a\n(Java) API call you&#39;d be making HTTP calls only.\n\n- John\n\n&gt;  to cache http responses, so that I\n&gt; could ask the local cache for a URL and it would return me the cached\n&gt; version if there were no reason to get something fresh from the web, or\n&gt; go out and get something on the web. It would be nice if it knew\n&gt; everything about HTTP redirects.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would also like to be able to browse the cache easily for debugging\n&gt; purposes. I would like to be able to pull up a window of of cache\n&gt; history, find the last request made, and be able to trace all the\n&gt; request that were made as part of a request.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is important to be able to browse the message exchanges easily so as\n&gt; to make it easy to debug all of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Henry\n&gt; \n&gt; Home page: http://bblfish.net/\n&gt; Sun Blog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/\n&gt; Foaf name: http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
