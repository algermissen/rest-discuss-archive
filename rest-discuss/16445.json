But I think it&#39;s fair to say that self-descriptive representation =\r\nformats are not unimportant as they yield key benefits (again see 5.1.2 -- =\r\nbut they&#39;re important for data encapsulation and evolvability).\n\nWhile a lo=\r\nt of xhtml is served as text/html instead of application/xhtml+xml, I don&#39;t=\r\n think that discounts the value of the IANA registry. HTML and XHTML have p=\r\nretty much the same semantics just different syntax. And the entire industr=\r\ny is aware that the two are often confused and code is written to cope with=\r\n this. You couldn&#39;t serve XHTML as application/foo and expect things to alw=\r\nays work even with the amount of content sniffing that goes on. (Well I sup=\r\npose I haven&#39;t tried but I certainly wouldn&#39;t have high hopes...)\n\nIt gets =\r\nback to the key requirement being that the client, server and intermediarie=\r\ns are all able to understand each other. If you want to ensure the broadest=\r\n interoperability across the entire web, then ya, you pretty much have to g=\r\no with IANA registered standards. If your &quot;system&quot; is a smaller community o=\r\nn the open web then you are likely supplementing the IANA registry with ano=\r\nther &quot;registry&quot; of sorts specific to the community (e.g. a site that define=\r\ns some yet-to-be-standardized formats that the community agrees on). It all=\r\n depends on the scope of your system.\n\nAndrew\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Sep 5, 2010 at 7:19 PM, E=\r\nric J.
