I am arguing about how to\ndesign RESTful applications.\n\n&gt; My rule of thumb is that the thing has multiple resources behind it if\n&gt; you have to invent a new addressing scheme to talk about the things, and\n&gt; you start embedding those addresses in XML documents or passing them\n&gt; around as parameters to APIs etc.\n\nA username is an identifier that exists in an address space\nseparate from the URI address space.\n\n&gt; &gt; As for the original example, if the application is designed\n&gt; &gt; without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to\n&gt; &gt; even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign\n&gt; &gt; travel is overrated anyways.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would presume that every city has its own URL and the only question is\n&gt; whether every user is allowed to see every city or whether they get an\n&gt; authorization complaint.\n\nYou can only make this presumption if there is an established and\nadhered to convention that it is RESTless to do otherwise. Are you\nready to declare so?\n\n&gt; &gt; 1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Great.\n\nI was very surprised to read that Roy does not agree with us. See:\n\nOn Friday 04 July 2003 12:13, Roy T. Fielding wrote:\n&gt; REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.\n\nRoy, are you saying that the &quot;must&quot; is a &quot;should&quot;? I used\n&quot;should&quot;, not &quot;must&quot;. If you wish to even further weaken the\nconstraint, I think you should provide clear and objective\nguidance on when an important resource need not have an\nidentifier. If you have already done so, please provide a link.\n\nOn Thursday 03 July 2003 18:40, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; &gt; 2. A user-specific resource is an important resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Great.\n\nIf you accept points 1 and 2, the argument is made. Points 3 to 5\nsimply draw out the consequences of 1 and 2. Given points 1 and 2,\nit is RESTless to not give a user-specific resource a URI.\n\n&gt; &gt; 3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific\n&gt; &gt; resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP auth can be used to do two things. One is to disallow access to a\n&gt; resource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let&#39;s say I send you a\n&gt; URL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect\n&gt; example). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a\n&gt; preference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a\n&gt; usability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for\n&gt; it and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.\n\nAgain, I am not arguing against container URLs. I am arguing\nagainst the absence of user-specific URLs.\n\nI am also not arguing that Slashdot should actually implement a\nuser-specific URL for its home page. I am only arguing that it is\nRESTless for Slashdot to not do so. In this case, it is likely\nthat this RESTless design will have no negative consequences.\nThis result will not always be the same. The more &quot;important&quot; the\nresource, the more likely it is that RESTless design will have\nnegative consequences. RESTless design of a less &quot;important&quot;\nresource may go unnoticed.\n\nI suspect that RESTless design is more of a problem in a web\nservice than in a web site. A web site may have many appearance\nvariation resources that are not present in a web service.\n\nClear rules help us identify potential design problems and avert\nthem. This is the basis for engineering. You seem to be taking the\nstance that a feel-good &quot;anything goes&quot; ruleset should be used.\nThis leaves REST without a real model or way of evaluating\ndesigns.\n\nIt is OK to call things RESTless and still use them. However, if\nyou are unable to correctly categorize designs, you reduce your\nability to improve your designs. Let&#39;s drop the squeamishness\naround calling things RESTless.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
