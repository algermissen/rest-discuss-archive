I would\n&gt; be interested in knowing how to do it myself.\n\nI don&#39;t think redirecting is necessary. It leads to lots of\ncopynpaste mod_rewrite code in your .htaccess, in my experience.\n\nTaking &quot;/bio.cgi/whatever&quot; as an example, anything after the\n&quot;/bio.cgi&quot; will be in PATH_INFO. Note that that includes the\nleading slash character.\n\nI suggest using a PATH_INFO state machine (or a nasty\nif-then-else if you must) to figure out which\nfunction/object/controller/whatever to process the request with.\n\nIf you want, you can still use a single mod_rewrite directive\nto clean up the path to the cgi script. I have (trivial)\nmod_rewrite code that does this, but its on another machine\nwhich I don&#39;t have access to as I right this. Mail me if you\nwant it.\n\nIt would rewrite\n/bio/pred-2/test-1\nto\n/bio.cgi/pred-2/test-1\n\nAn bio.cgi process would then see a PATH_INFO of /pred-2/test-1 .\n\n"}}
