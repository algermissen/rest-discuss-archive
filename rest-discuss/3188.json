This way, when a range is\n&gt; complete, it is allocated a permanent uri; until then it is returned as\n&gt; a collection of singletons.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; To mark an order seen, the client does a DELETE on the uri acquired from\n&gt; /new-orders.\nI while ago there was some discussion about acknowledging messages or\nmarking a resource as being processed in some way - there was a comparison\nbetween DELETE and POST with a body of &#39;status=seen&#39;. I think the end result\nwas that if there are multiple status values (ready, locked, finished, etc.)\nthen you would POST the status (or PUT to a more detailed URI). If the\nexistence of the resource is all the indication needed, then DELETE probably\nwill work fine. Since you have two distinct URIs for &#39;new-orders&#39; and\n&#39;acknowledged orders&#39; - deleting the one resource merely removes the\nrelationship that the order is &#39;new&#39; (or however you want to think of it)\nrather than deleting the order itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
