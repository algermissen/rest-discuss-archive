I think Atom is great for what it is built for \n(syndication), but I&#39;m not convinced it is a good format for web \nservices.  The way people are suggesting to use it in a web services \nenvironment is *way* to much like SOAP.  Especially in this case, where \nheaders would work just fine.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
