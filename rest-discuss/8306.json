The one that returns\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; 200+text/html when the far end 401s on you. The one that caches stuff\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; for weeks, even when the TTL is seconds. The one that caches an\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; incomplete download and serves up to other callers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Errmmmm... isn&#39;t this true of SOAP as well?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A proxy that was that badly implemented (and I agree that some proxies\n&gt; &gt; ARE that badly implemented) would fek up a SOAP call as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not in the good old days when all SOAP calls ran over POST.\n&gt;\n\nWhich is, IMO, the only way to run SOAP. two-way synchronous\noperations, not WS-A-addressed one-way calls that aren&#39;t even allowed\nto let you know you just tried to post ill-formed XML.\n\nThere is a least one GET-related bug in classic Axis1.x. The\nhappyaxis.jsp page is designed to perform passive system diagnostics.\nAlthough originally meant to for loadbalancing routers to use, it has\nbecome the normal way to check that Axis is installed. Indeed, a\nsearch for &quot;Axis Happiness Page&quot; will show you the internals of many\naxis installations out there.\n\nIts a JSP page, and is designed to be (a) entirely standalone and (b)\neasily extensible by users. So there are variations for things like\napache muse and other SOAP-based services.\n\nBut, the little JSP page doesnt set the cache expiry info. So while it\nworks well for dev systems on the local net, if you go live with\nsomething beyond the firewall, or if you are trying to do interop\ntests against remote systems, checking for happyaxis only shows you if\nthe proxy server has, at some point in the past, been publishing a\nstatus page.\n\nnow we have a proxy server that caches things for a couple of days,\nand if the server at the far end is not there, it serves up the old\nstuff without any warning that the content is really, really out of\ndate. Which makes checking the base happyaxis.jsp page useless, unless\nyou tack on some random query string at the end, which is what I ended\nup doing:\nhttp://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smartfrog/trunk/core/components/deployapi/build.xml?view=markup\n\nAnd do you know who it was that left the cache-expiry headers out the\nJSP page? It was me. So now I am suffering because I forgot to add it\nfour years ago, and the JSP page and derivatives are out in the wild\nand I have to test against them.\n\nI dont think the ?WSDL pages set cache expiry information either. Oops.\n\nSummary: even if SOAP over POST itself doesnt have proxy cache\nproblems, the other bits of the stack can do it. And, because the\npeople writing SOAP stacks tend to live in the SOAP world rather than\nthe depths of HTTP, they tend to forget about some of the details of\nlayers underneath, like the effect of proxies.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
