Perhaps even more application \n&gt; neutral than HTTP itself, since SOAP is little more than a framework for \n&gt; an XML envelope with completely open ended XML header processing. It is \n&gt; extremely application neutral. The problem is, interface designers take \n&gt; the incredibly generic SOAP format and put an incredibly application \n&gt; specific XML payload inside it. That&#39;s like stepping of a neutrality \n&gt; cliff -- from extremely generic to extremely specific in one step.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course the same can happen (and does happen) with Atom entities or \n&gt; even with representations returned by HTTP itself. But it seems to us \n&gt; that interface designers in the REST &quot;camp&quot; seem to better understand \n&gt; the importance of reusing existing representations for new applications, \n&gt; not custom designing representations for each new application. An \n&gt; example of this is the RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a \n&gt; transport protocol, but rather an &quot;application protocol&quot;, albeit a VERY \n&gt; application neutral one. What we haven&#39;t seen yet, even from the REST \n&gt; &quot;camp&quot; is much in the way of fairly generic ATOM entities to go inside \n&gt; the ATOM &quot;envelope&quot;. Many REST examples using ATOM step off the same cliff.\n\nI think the problem is, you&#39;ve tacked on a constraint without describing \nwhat it induces/constrains. With an architecture hat on I would want it \ndescribed operationally so I can understand what benefits it brings and \nwhat the costs are, instead of having it defined in terms of of \ndesirable outcomes or failings in other models (both serious problems \nwith descriptions of SOA). I would want it called something like \n&quot;REST+N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; stands for application neutrality instead of making \nup terms like WOA.\n\nBut at a guess it sounds like you&#39;re looking for content technologies \nlike RDF/OWL, or even KIF/FIPACL, which can be generically evaluated, as \nopposed to enveloping formats, which can be generically parsed. If \nthat&#39;s the case, I can see how it can layer on a REST based system.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
