Still not self-descriptive?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re talking about self-descriptiveness and visibility and giving an\n&gt; example which fails to state a media type, or assumes application/xml.\n&gt; Do you not see where this might be confusing to folks trying to learn\n&gt; REST?\n\nI didn&#39;t leave it out on purpose. I corrected myself. It is not that\nbig of a deal.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is self-descriptive to an extent: it&#39;s a non-safe request to the\n&gt;&gt; cart resource to process the message in some way, it&#39;s a\n&gt;&gt; cache-invalidating request.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Self-descriptive fundamentally means that you&#39;ve declared a media type\n&gt; such that intermediaries can determine how to decipher the payload.\n\nYes, I forgot to include a Content-Type header, we&#39;ve established that now.\n\nThe payload (request body) is one part of an HTTP request message,\nthere&#39;s also all the headers. GET requests don&#39;t have a payload or a\nContent-Type and they&#39;re self-descriptive.\n\n&gt; You can&#39;t just hand-wave your way around this requirement by stating\n&gt; that it somehow isn&#39;t required for self-descriptiveness, that other\n&gt; factors are enough.\n\nYes, I forgot to include a Content-Type header, we&#39;ve established that now.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want to argue for superior self-descriptiveness, you need to\n&gt;&gt; explain why the additional visibility you are creating will enable\n&gt;&gt; otherwise-impossible intermediary mechanisms. Otherwise you should be\n&gt;&gt; arguing some other system property than self-descriptiveness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what &quot;superior&quot; means, I&#39;m making an argument for the\n&gt; basics here, and I have no idea what &quot;other&quot; system property this would\n&gt; fall under.  I&#39;m not creating &quot;additional&quot; visibility here, just\n&gt; stating the basic requirement for visibility.  If an intermediary can&#39;t\n&gt; determine how to process the payload, then anything else it can deduce\n&gt; about the message (cache-invalidating, non-safe, etc.) is useful, how?\n\nwell, for example, a cache that knows the request is\ncache-invalidating and if it receives a success response from the\norigin server the cache knows that it should purge on that URI.\n\nOr a a security proxy that throttles write requests for clients can\nincrement its count for that client.\n\nOr the request could include an If-Match header so that a cache knows\nit&#39;s stale and respond with a 412 without having to hit the origin\nserver.\n\nNone of those intermediary mechanisms require the payload to be\nprocessed, in fact processing the payload for those purposes would be\nentirely redundant and incredibly inefficient.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It seems to me like there is not a clear enough definition of\n&gt;&gt; &quot;self-descriptive&quot; and/or visibility. And this results in it being\n&gt;&gt; used as a go-to argument for anyone that prefers a long winded,\n&gt;&gt; verbose design approach. Which is a shame.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is, but apparently you don&#39;t much care for it, instead making\n&gt; semantic arguments about what else self-descriptive might mean, which\n&gt; seems to be your go-to argument for cutting corners on REST&#39;s\n&gt; constraints.  The rest of us have long since achieved consensus on the\n&gt; meanings of Roy&#39;s terminology.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/specialization\n\nThat post is irrelevant. Please just share relevant quotes/links which\nactually clarify the terminology in question.\n\nCheers,\nM\n\n"}}
