Analyzing the URL moves\n&gt; &gt; away from treating hypermedia as the engine of application\n&gt; &gt; state.  That said, it appears that opacity isn&#39;t so much a\n&gt; &gt; principle of REST as it&#39;s an original principle of the web that\n&gt; &gt; Fielding didn&#39;t really care to integrate so much.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it is just that people are different from machines,\n&gt; servers are different from clients, and TimBL used the word\n&gt; &quot;Axiom&quot; to mean architectural constraint.  In order to understand\n&gt; TimBL&#39;s design notes, you have to know about the context in which\n&gt; he is writing a response.  In this case, various thoughts were\n&gt; recorded as the &quot;Opacity Axiom&quot; in response to a discussion about\n&gt; client behavior and the perceived need for URNs.  It has long\n&gt; since been taken out of context and abused in various ways.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, keep in mind that TimBL&#39;s design note was written two\n&gt; years after Henrik and I worked out the important bits of what\n&gt; would become the HTTP object model, later re-named REST to get\n&gt; away from OOM terms, about 18 months after we had similar\n&gt; discussions at MIT with TimBL and the rest of the W3C team, and\n&gt; more than a year after HTTP/1.0 was finished and HTTP/1.1 proposed.\n&gt; So, saying it was something that I &quot;didn&#39;t really care to\n&gt; integrate so much&quot; is missing the mark by quite a bit -- he is\n&gt; trying to describe our model to people who did not understand it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The opacity principle, as actually used on the Web, refers only\n&gt; to the machine interpretation of request processing as being\n&gt; dependent on control data (e.g., hypertext anchors and message\n&gt; field names) rather than on metadata appearing within the URI.\n&gt; It is the same reason why we distinguish media types from data\n&gt; formats -- the fact that a string of bytes looks like angle tags\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean we want to process it as HTML.  Ignoring any\n&gt; semantically significant data in a URI allows operations on a\n&gt; resource to be orthogonal to identification of the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST does include the opacity axiom in the original sense of\n&gt; that phrase.  I did not use it by name in REST because it isn&#39;t\n&gt; a principle at all -- opacity is just a name TimBL used for the\n&gt; set of constraints around URI processing by clients (a byproduct\n&gt; of the constraints that you will find in REST).  The principle\n&gt; involved is orthogonal design.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Opacity of URI&quot; only applies to clients and, even then, only to\n&gt; those parts of the URI that are not defined by relevant standards.\n&gt; Origin servers, for example, have the choice of interpreting a\n&gt; URI as being opaque or as a structure that defines how the server\n&gt; maps the URI to a representation of the resource.  Cool URIs will\n&gt; often make a transition from being originally interpreted as\n&gt; structure by the server and then later treated as an opaque\n&gt; string (perhaps because the server implementation has changed\n&gt; and the owner wants the old URI to persist).  The server can make\n&gt; that transition because clients are required to act like they\n&gt; are ignorant of the server-private structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clients are allowed to treat a URI as being structured\n&gt; if that structure is defined by standard (e.g., scheme and\n&gt; authority in &quot;http&quot;) or if the server tells the client how its\n&gt; URI is structured.  For example, both GET-based FORM actions and\n&gt; server-side image map processing compose the URI from a\n&gt; server-provided base and a user-supplied suffix constructed\n&gt; according to an algorithm defined by a standard media type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note, however, that some people have taken the mere title of\n&gt; &quot;opacity&quot; and assumed that it meant URIs should not have\n&gt; meaningful construction at all.  TimBL&#39;s axiom doesn&#39;t say\n&gt; that and neither does REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy T.
