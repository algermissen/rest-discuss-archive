HTML, XML and CSS are \n&gt; really only related to REST in that they can point to other \n&gt; resources and be rendered incrementally.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a lot in them that also helps make the web interoperable.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s also true of DOM and JS though in practice that&#39;s \n&gt; where the hard bits are for interoperability.\n&gt; \n&gt; We already have quite a lot of interoperability at the \n&gt; network layer outside of HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never had interoperability problems with FTP, SMTP or \n&gt; POP due to clients and servers differing in OS, and they \n&gt; aren&#39;t RESTful.\n\nI get the impression you are related to that genie on The X Files where\neveryone who made a wish got the letter of what they asked for but not the\nspirit.  The Genie kept saying &quot;Well, you didn&#39;t specify...&quot;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interoperability on desktop apps is not great just as SOAP \n&gt; webservice \n&gt; &gt; interoperability is not great.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think one could make something that departed from REST the \n&gt; same way that SOAP did and was just as interoperable. \n&gt; Actually, just get rid of all the SOAP stacks except one and \n&gt; you might do so.\n\nIt&#39;s hard to debate a hypothetical...\n\n&gt; It would still suck, but for reasons other than \n&gt; interoperability. All the systems doing it would suck in the \n&gt; same way, and so be interoperable.\n\nAll systems suck.  Some just suck less. :)\n\n&gt; &gt; Using REST principles applied judiciously to the desktop \n&gt; &gt; could bring the same interoperability we see on the web \n&gt; &gt; to the desktop.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve got a great hammer there, but that isn&#39;t a nail.\n\nI like to think that it is more like a chisel [1].  &#39;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, I&#39;m always, always, always pining for some way to \n&gt; go back to \n&gt; &gt; a particular (course grained) point in an application.  Having that \n&gt; &gt; point available in an LRL (Local Resource Locator) would be \n&gt; wonderful, \n&gt; &gt; just like having a path I can copy and paste from Windows \n&gt; Explorer to \n&gt; &gt; file open dialogs is wonderful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve actually done this in desktop apps. This isn&#39;t REST though.\n\nI didn&#39;t say it was REST.  I said REST would provide the functionality that\nwould be equivalent.\n\n&gt; &gt; Thirdly it could unify the desktop and the web and \n&gt; eliminate the (in \n&gt; &gt; the future more and more) arbitrary distinction between local and \n&gt; &gt; Internet.\n&gt; \n&gt; The distinctions are not arbitrary. The biggest reason for \n&gt; people believing the infamous Fallacies of Distributed \n&gt; Computing[1] is that they don&#39;t apply locally. A serious \n&gt; advantage in dealing with HTTP verbs on URIs-as-nouns over \n&gt; RPC models is RPC models make the very non-arbitrary \n&gt; distinction between local and Internet appear arbitrary.\n\nFallacies of Distributed Computing do not necessarily imply an inverse\nequivalence of Fallacies of Local Computing. \n\nYour fallacy here is assuming that when y= func(x) that x= func(y).\n\n&gt; REST is designed to deal with precisely the situations those \n&gt; fallacies lead people to ignore.\n\nWhich doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be used locally.\n\n&gt; If you really need to get rid of the distinction between the \n&gt; local and the networked just build it networked and run it on \n&gt; a webserver on localhost - \n\nThat&#39;s wasn&#39;t the need, it was a happy by-product.\n\n&gt; but realise that that is a sacrifice of adopting REST in \n&gt; situations where its benefits \n&gt; aren&#39;t as directly applicable made for the gains in terms of \n&gt; it being seemless with the rest of the web, rather than a \n&gt; direct boon to the desktop.\n\nJust because every benefit is not applicable doesn&#39;t invalidate all\nbenefits.\n\n&gt; &gt; The path in the title bar is analogous to the URL that one can save \n&gt; &gt; and/or copy from one context and paste into another.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. I don&#39;t see how this is REST though.\n\nAs above, I used it as an ANALOGY. Not as an specific example.\n\n&gt; There is no client-server. \n\nWrong.  You yourself should know it does not take an Internet connection to\nestablish the roles of client and of server.  One component calling another\nin the same EXE can comprise the roles of client-server.\n\nAdd +1.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s no stateless connection (indeed, no connection). \n&gt; There is no cache. \n&gt; There is no uniform interface. \n&gt; There is no layered system. \n\nThere is no reason there can&#39;t be, and for these I&#39;m arguing that there\nshould be.  ESPECIALLY the uniform interface.\n\nAdd +4\n\n&gt; Code-on-demand isn&#39;t even applicable as a concept (you already have all\nthe code).\n\nTake your argument here to the limit and we&#39;d all be handcoding\nparameterless assembler. This is an architecture concept and does not\nrequire the seperation of Internet for it to be applicable.\n\nAdd +1\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 out of 7 constraints met.\n&gt; \n\nRevised: 6 out of 6 constraints met (you miscounted, at least in your list.)\n\n&gt; Of the data elements:\n&gt; Resource: Closest thing is the files. Lets give you that one \n&gt; rather than argue - 1 data element.\n\nA resource is a resource.  Why obscure with files?\n\n&gt; URI: Yep, can even be a real URI (&quot;file:///...&quot;)\n\nA &quot;real&quot; URI?  When is a URI not real?\n\n&gt; Represetation: This is a big one where your argument falls \n&gt; down. \n\nWhy?  \n\n&gt; Okay, if you have an NTFS file system you can have \n&gt; different streams in a file and sort of kludge it that way, \n&gt; but you can&#39;t get to that easily through what&#39;s put in front \n&gt; of you. On balance; no.\n\nYou&#39;ve made tons of assumptions in your arguments against, assumptions which\nI did not make.  \n\nMaybe I should clarify. I was not referring to building the O/S using REST\n(why reinvent that wheel?)  I was referring to using REST to build the\nthings that people are constantly building;  applications.\n\n&gt; Representaiton metadata: No distinction between rep, res and \n&gt; ctrl Resource metadata: No distinction rep, res and ctrl \n&gt; Control metadata: No distionction rep, res and ctrl\n\nOnly because of your faulty assumptions.\n\n&gt; 2 out of 6 at a push. 1 out of 6 really as talking about \n&gt; files as resources is okay, but talking about resources as \n&gt; files is not only wrong but dangerously so (since it&#39;s common \n&gt; mistake).\n\nRevised: 6 out of 6.\n\n&gt; Connectors:\n&gt; I can&#39;t even find a force analogy for most of them. Let&#39;s say \n&gt; explorer is a client, the file system a server and leave it \n&gt; at 2 out of 5.\n&gt; \n&gt; Components:\n&gt; 2 out of 4 for the same reason.\n\nI don&#39;t follow you here at all.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarity to REST therefore is (0/7) * (2/6) * (2/5) * (2/4) = 0%\n\nI can&#39;t fully correct until I understand the last two:\n\nSimilarity to REST therefore is (6/6) * (6/6) * (?/5) * (?/4) = ??%\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n[1]\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer#Tools_used_in_conjunction_with_hammers\n\nP.S.
