Bookmarking  \n&gt; takes a dynamically generated bookmark and effectively makes it  \n&gt; static -- at least it&#39;s static (persisted) on the client side. As  \n&gt; more and more clients bookmark more and more of the URIs they  \n&gt; receive, the more they are incrementally &quot;fixing&quot; the original URI  \n&gt; space.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence my point: encouraging promiscuous bookmarking of (deep) links  \n&gt; seems to be at odds with REST&#39;s desire to minimize &quot;entry point&quot;  \n&gt; URIs. Do you see the tension as well, or am I missing something  \n&gt; that resolves the tension?\n\nWhy do you think that there is a desire in REST to minimize the\nnumber of entry points?\n\n&gt; Devdatta makes the excellent point earlier in the thread about &quot;how  \n&gt; blogs require you to permalink instead of the page you are  \n&gt; viewing.&quot; It seems that perhaps there is an implicit REST  \n&gt; constraint that is beginning to become more explicit. Roughly, REST  \n&gt; distinguishes two types of URIs:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;entry point&quot; type URIs, which may be bookmarked indefinitely.  \n&gt; These are Cool URIs.\n&gt; &quot;transitional&quot; type URIs, which may not be bookmarked indefinitely.  \n&gt; These are unCool URIs. I call then &quot;transitional&quot; given that their  \n&gt; role is typically to enable transition to the next state.\n\nNo.  There are some crappy web applications that expose what you would\ncall a transitional (partial web state) URI to the client because\nthey are badly written to expose an old terminal screen interface\nas intermediate HTML forms, but I would not call such a system RESTful.\nThose URIs are not identifying resources.\n\nPermalinks provide a URI to the article resource that is independent\nof its current representation (usually, the representation of some feed,\nwhich is not the same resource and hence requires the provision of a\npermalink URI for people to bookmark).  It is just hypertext and has\nthe same role in REST as the list of summaries that Google returns\nin response to a search.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not wedded to the names (you could call them internal/ \n&gt; external), but I do think this distinction between types of URIs is  \n&gt; an important aspect of REST that, so far, has not been clearly  \n&gt; outlined. It certainly seems to be in play in the permathread  \n&gt; debates regarding whether &quot;URIs should be RESTful or not&quot; (and  \n&gt; whether that designation is even a meaningful one). I also think  \n&gt; the distinction is a bit at odds with the common understanding of  \n&gt; URIs on the Web that ANY URIshould be a bookmarkable URI, ie that  \n&gt; ALL URIs should strive to be Cool.\n\nI won&#39;t repeat my opinion about opaque URIs.  If there is a\ntension between the desire to bookmark and the fact that REST\nencourages folks to break up an application into a state\nmachine of reusable resource states, then I would consider it to be\nmore like sexual tension.  Just because you have it doesn&#39;t mean\nit is bad, and one way to improve things is to make the more\nimportant resource links look sexier than the less important ones.\n\n   http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/augment-132082.htm#11J\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a pretty major change in Web architectural thinking  \n&gt; (or at least emphasis) to now say (effectively) that a significant  \n&gt; class of URIs should NOT be cool, ie one should NOT expect them to  \n&gt; be useable indefinitely. In a way, this harks all the way back to  \n&gt; Parnas&#39;s admonition that we hide information that is likely to  \n&gt; change. Using modern web-speak, REST seems to admonish us to &quot;hide&quot;  \n&gt; the URIs that are likely to change (unCool URIs) and &quot;expose&quot; only  \n&gt; those URIs that are likely to stay the same (Cool URIs). But  \n&gt; nothing I&#39;ve seen in the desciptions of Web Architecture (eg  \n&gt; AWWWv1) remotely suggests that some URIs should effectively be  \n&gt; hidden, or per my previous point, not bookmarked. If anything, Web  \n&gt; Architecture descriptions at least imply that all URIs SHOULD be  \n&gt; &quot;exposed&quot; and bookmarkable.\n\n&quot;All important resources should be identifiable by URI.&quot;\n\nI think you should look at each of those words in turn and\nconsider why they were chosen.  That particular quote is from\n\n    http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2002/01-uriMediaType-9\nand\n    http://www.w3.org/2002/04/22-tag-summary\n\nbut it was also in the first drafts of the TAG&#39;s webarch.  That\nprinciple was not new -- I remember TimBL mentioning it during his\nkeynote in Geneva, May 1994, and it dates from Engelbart&#39;s work:\n\n   http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/augment-132082.htm#11K\n\nwhich in turn influenced my design when HTTP/1.0 needed finishing.\nBy definition, working on improving the Web Project meant increasing\nthe number of Web-accessible resources.\n\nHere is a more recent variation on the same theme that I just ran\nacross while doing a search:\n\nhttp://derivadow.com/2007/12/28/web-design-20-its-all-about-the- \nresource-and-its-url/\n\nOther things that might be worth keeping in mind is that REST is\ndesigned for reuse, not just use.  The notion that anyone has control\nover a successful application&#39;s reuse is pure fantasy, as described in\n\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/mid/E6416F61-E40C-4DE6-8B7A-D8A94EE8537B@...&gt;\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
