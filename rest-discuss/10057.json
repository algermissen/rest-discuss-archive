On the other hand you can of  \ncourse send entire representations to create or update a resource.\n\nI wonder about what&#39;s allowed regarding partial updates. For example,  \n&quot;mark this message as read&quot; in the traditional way of thinking may  \nsend an Ajax call to /messages/mark_as_read/{id}, which is RPC-like.  \nYou can as well send just a password and password confirmation to  \nreset the credentials of a user resource that has 15 additional  \nattributes you don&#39;t send.\n\nIn general I would like to have a REST pattern for sending a *subset*  \nof attributes to be updated if that fits the REST paradigm, or else to  \nbe certain it doesn&#39;t.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
