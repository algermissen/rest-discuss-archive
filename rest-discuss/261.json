The problem is\n&gt; we&#39;ve learned to think about it one way and now we must learn to think\n&gt; about it another. If you taught someone REST and you taught them sockets\n&gt; and asked them to invent an email system I think they would find it\n&gt; easier to do it using HTTP and REST.\n\nThe more comparable example is if you asked them\nto set up an asynchronous peer to peer\nmessaging system (aka email). Would they choose\nHTTP or SMTP?\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; The idea is that security checkpoints send front\n&gt; &gt; and side views of individuals to some server and\n&gt; &gt; the server sends back information about whether\n&gt; &gt; the person looks like a known terrorist in the\n&gt; &gt; database.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; If you want a web interface then you can use a POST form.\n\nSee my reply to MB.  This is not modeling the\napplication in terms of resources.  It is RPC.\n\nReturning a URL and then asking the client to\nwatch the new URL seems like a lot of overhead and\nwaste.\n\n&gt; The client may also want an asyncronous notification of when this status\n&gt; resource changes. In the interests of layering and distribution of\n&gt; processing, I would think of this as a completely unrelated part of the\n&gt; system. Some clients could poll. Others could ask for a notification.\n&gt; Maybe the resource for status and for the final result should be\n&gt; separate...I can&#39;t see big tradeoffs one way or the other off the top of\n&gt; my head.\n\nGood argument, but the polling is ugly.  A\ncallback system is much nicer and much ligher on\nsystem resources!\n\n&gt; Conventions for asyncronous notification are here:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * http://www.prescod.net/HTTP_event_conventions.html\n\nOk.  So that is another new protocol.  It is not\nreal life HTTP.  It also seems no better than just\nsending a reply-to in the first place.\n\n&gt; Anyhow, that&#39;s how I would model it. Notice how I try to think about the\n&gt; web interface at each step.\n\nI am doing the same thing.  The whole point of\nMIME-RPC is to model the web interface.  Which\nuses MIME rather than SOAP or XML-RPC.\n\n&gt; As these pictures are large, you might want to consider allowing users\n&gt; to submit some kind of a hash to check if the picture is already on the\n&gt; site.\n\nAgain, the pictures are taken at the client site\nso the server won&#39;t have copies.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
