However, it is my rememberance that URIs no longer have\npractical length limits and that people should not design interfaces\nas if they did.\n\nSo, why not just serialize the XML using the XML syntax in, e.g.,\nUTF-8, and then escape any characters that need to be escaped for\nthe URI encoding?\n\nI mean, we can probably do better than this, e.g., with a dictionary\nof namespace URIs, element names and attribute names that would yield\na more compact representation of the XML instance data (all of which\nreminds me of binary XML), but why bother?  Is&#39;t it good enough to do\nthis in the simplest manner possible so that we can move forward?\n\n-bryan\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Orchard&quot; &lt;orchard@p...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; I think one of the hardest parts of coming up with a &quot;uriencoded-\nxml&quot; format is dealing with those pesky QNames.  I wrote a while ago \nabout this \nhttp://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2004/04/29/binding_qnames_to_uris.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;ve almost gotten to the point of thinking that it&#39;s just simply \nto awful to binding lexical QNames or NS decls to URIs for binding \npotentially many qnames to URIs.  The approach of specifying that the \nns decl is part of the &quot;algorithm&quot; allows for I think a pretty common \ncase, the authority creating the resources can specify the ns name \ndecls ahead of time.  In this case, the creator of the Author \nresources not surprisingly owns the Author namespace names.  A prefix \nis not required for the default namespace, and a prefix is required \nfor using ns decls outside the default ns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; There is a big downside in that the xml fragments are no-longer \nself-describing as they are missing their ns decls in-line.  If \nsomebody changes the namespace name but not the ns prefix, things \ncould get pretty hairy.  And distributed extensibility wouldn&#39;t be \nsupported as a client that knew about a davens:extension that was \nunknown to the service wouldn&#39;t be able to send the extension they \nknow about but wasn&#39;t in the algorithm.  I suppose it could be \npossible to say that extensions can be sent in ugly lexical form as \nthat is the &quot;hard but possible&quot; case in the &quot;make simple things \nsimple and hard things possible&quot; algorithm.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In retrospect, I&#39;m becoming convinced that marrying XML sans \nnamespace tree structures to the URI tree and query structure works \nfine, but marrying XML namespaced tree structures to URIs has been \nalmost useless by the decision to make ns names absolute URIs.  In \norder to map some kind of xml to URIs, we have to adopt some kind of \nconstraints, like &quot;ns decls are implicit&quot;, to make it usable.  One \nthing I am curious about is whether people see much need for mapping \nmixed ns xml into URIs, or if most of the scenarios involved single \nns..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: thompsonbry [mailto:thompsonbry@s...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 2004 4:51 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Re: Re-using information fields for queries \nin REST\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds very relevant to how XForms could use GET.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am assuming that we want the stronger constraint of \n&gt; bookmarkability, right?
