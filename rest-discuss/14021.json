If you want to encrypt the payload, fine. Headers are still enough i=\r\nnfo to manage all in-the-middle needs.\n\nBut then, does it make the message =\r\nnon self-descriptive? What is the meaning of that? I think it is not the id=\r\nea of a message anyone can read and know exactly what is happening. Let&#39;s s=\r\nee: to me, it makes no sense to think someone, that does not know anything =\r\nabout you app, nor anything about your business, may take any message in ti=\r\nme, and completely know all the app history, what is the app state, what is=\r\n it going on, and how will it end. \n\nSO, we can assume people that finds a =\r\nmessage, may know what it is if it knows a little about the business. It ma=\r\ny actually know what&#39;s up with the app if it knows the app. But if the one =\r\nthat finds the message is one of the intended intermediaries, it should kno=\r\nw what is going on, and should know how to act at the event. In SOAP world =\r\nthere are elements to indicate intermediaries if they should process, pass =\r\nor need to understand about the message, without knowing the payload. And i=\r\nt makes sense (a little).\n\nSo, in your example, the actual fact that Willia=\r\nm does not know what is happening in the message with a form encoded data d=\r\noes not break any REST rule, if William is not part of your app. And if Wil=\r\nliam is, it may actually need to know something in the HTTP headers to proc=\r\ness, without even looking at payload. And if William needs to process the p=\r\nayload, it will be actually expecting that format, don&#39;t you think?\n\nThe pr=\r\noblem we often find in REST, is that it was designed for networked systems,=\r\n with large grained hypermedia transfer apps. That is a domain, a clearly d=\r\nefined one, with media types created for it. Sometimes, you need a new medi=\r\na type, and if you dare to use your own, some people may jump and say that =\r\nis out-of-band information,  forcing you to use types not suitable for you =\r\napp. Or maybe, your app is not suitable for REST. It may be out-of-band in =\r\nthat domain, but not in yours. Probably that is a discussion someday, someo=\r\nne may start: Do you want to follow REST or the Web Implementation? Interes=\r\nting.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan=\r\n Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On thing that keeps bugging m=\r\ne....\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose I have an order accepting resource /order-processor-a an=\r\nd the  \n&gt; client has discovered that it accepts application/order+xml (assu=\r\nming  \n&gt; the type being a standard type).

In fact, is any general media type (e.g. tex=\r\nt/uri-list) a  \n&gt; violation of the message self descriptiveness constraint?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
