Which is their problem,\nthey think that anything being PUT should _be_ the entity. Not a\nrepresentation of the entity; that is clearly mad.\n\nIn fairness to them they are saying &quot;we don&#39;t know of any other\ntoolkit that does what you want to do so why should we&quot;\n\nI think that&#39;s a bit stupid but at least they&#39;re not trying to argue\nwith me about the nature of PUT.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
