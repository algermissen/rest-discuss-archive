So\n&gt; &quot;Basic&quot; is always routed to the icky dialog implementation. You would\n&gt; probably want to make up a scheme name, like &quot;BasicNoDialog&quot;, that is\nMaking up new names within a network protocol to work around\nyesterday&#39;s implementation of one applications UI is double plus\nungood.\nChange &quot;is always&quot; to &quot;was previously&quot; and you&#39;ve got a better approach.\n\nI&#39;m all for going into Mozilla source and making changes - I had tried\nto do that a while ago. I became concerned when I saw the WHAT-WG\napproach for &#39;event sources&#39; and went into sketching out a different\napproach and got the source code, but got stuck in trying to make it\ncompile and run. Then got distracted. The WHAT-WG (well, the only\nvocal person involved) didn&#39;t really respond to this and spun out\nsomewhere else for a while so I dropped it.\n\nSee http://www.dierken.com/xmlrouter/events/\nand\nhttp://www.dierken.com/xmlrouter/events/chat.html?topic=rest-discuss\n\n"}}
