If not, the simplest / most RESTful solution may\n&gt; simply be to allow the party behind the firewall to run a regular HTTP\n&gt; server, allow that &quot;blocked&quot; party to establish a tunnel (HTTP,\npresumably)\n&gt; to the third party, and subsequently adopt all of the port 80 traffic to\n&gt; that intermediary or, better, by engaging in a RESTful protocol *adopt* a\n&gt; portion of the intermediary&#39;s HTTP namespace.  Requests to the\nintermediary\n&gt; are then funneled down the backchannel to the client, where they are\nlocally\n&gt; dispatched onto the local HTTP server, and responses channeled back along\n&gt; the reverse path.\nYes! I want the behind-the-firewall node to &#39;adopt/mount&#39; a namespace hosted\nby the intermediary.\nRequests - after the &#39;mount&#39; operation - would then flow down the connection\nto the firewalled node. 99% of this technology already exists. The\nfirewalled node can attach the connection to existing HTTP/MIME parsers and\ndispatch accordingly - run some JSP or ASP or whatever.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This portion is a lot like mounting a filesystem from one server on\nanother\n&gt; server then subsequently mounting the filesystem from the second server on\n&gt; some client for access --- except it deals directly with the\ndirectionality\n&gt; problem of HTTP.\nYes! Since REST (in my opinion) has fundamental directionality associated\nwith resources (the resource is always the &#39;server&#39;) in order to grow the\nWeb by the next factor of 10,000x we need to enable more machines -\ndesktops, etc. This is a lot more attractive at solving real world problems\nthan the PedanticWeb.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hence Paul&#39;s suggestion -\n&gt; &gt; separate who /initiates/ the networking from the /direction/ of\nmessages. I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have a problem with the protocol for behind-the-firewall access\nbeing\n&gt; &gt; non-HTTP or at least non-sanctioned HTTP clone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually I do, but only in that I see it proliferating protocols and code\n&gt; where it&#39;s strictly speaking neither optimal or necessary.\n&gt;\nIf it&#39;s not necessary, I wouldn&#39;t do it either. I envision HTTP requests\nflowing down the connection and responses flowing back up in exactly the\nsame fashion as non-firewalled node - only there is an out-of-phase mark\nwhen the two machines switch roles. This may confuse intermediaries, but\nwith Lucas&#39; upgrade header, this may be legal.\n\n\n\n"}}
