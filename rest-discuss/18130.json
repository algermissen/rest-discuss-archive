The main goal for me\nwas to ma=\r\nke this API accessible to developers without requiring\nthem to read a lot o=\r\nf documentation before getting started.\n\nSpecifically, this meant:\n\n  (a) e=\r\nnsure that all resources can be reached via links\n  (b) no need to learn ho=\r\nw to construct URIs\n  (c) explorable with an ordinary web browser\n  (d) HTM=\r\nL representations with built-in documentation\n  (e) ability for developer t=\r\no see &#39;link information&#39; on demand\n  (f) all resources and relationships ar=\r\ne discoverable\n\nYou can have a look for yourself if you go here:\n\n  https:/=\r\n/beta.vcider.com\n\nLogin as user &quot;testuser&quot; with password &quot;testuser&quot;. What y=\r\nou see is\nour UI for the management and control of software defined (virtua=\r\nl)\nnetworks. There are a few nodes and networks all setup, so you can\nsee w=\r\nhat this looks like in the UI. But since you are there for the\nAPI, you can=\r\n either go to the API documentation:\n\n  https://beta.vcider.com/api/\n\nOr yo=\r\nu can go straight to the API itself: \n\n  https://beta.vcider.com/api/root/\n=\r\n\nIf you follow the last link (after you have logged in), you can see\nthe HT=\r\nML representation of the API root resource, which contains\nlinks to more in=\r\nformation.\n\nA few things to try:\n\n  * Click on &#39;show as JSON&#39; to see the sa=\r\nme in plain JSON.\n  * Click on &#39;show linkinfo&#39; to see what you can do with =\r\nthe links.\n  * Click on the nodes list and then click on &#39;show related&#39;.\n\nT=\r\nhe ability to show related information (the last point) is a\nconcession to =\r\nthe realities of client programming: Let&#39;s say the\nclient needs to display =\r\nan overview table of all the nodes in the\nsystem. For that, the client norm=\r\nally gets the list of all nodes\n(each entry in the list being a URI) and th=\r\nen accesses each URI\nto get information about the particular resource. This=\r\n means the\nclient possibly needs to issue lots of requests. When you click\n=\r\non &#39;show related&#39; (which results in the addition of a query string\nparamete=\r\nr to the URI), you actually get a &#39;preview&#39; of the referenced\nresources rig=\r\nht in your list, so you will typically get all the\ninformation you need wit=\r\nh just a single request.\n\nThere are also some areas where I know I still ha=\r\nve work to do:\n\n  * Caching and the relevant headers are not handled at thi=\r\ns point.\n  * The content type is just plain &quot;application/json&quot;.\n\nA note abo=\r\nut authentication in case you are interested: If you log\nin via the web sit=\r\ne, you are authenticated with the web-site&#39;s\nsession (those sessions are pa=\r\nrt of the underlying MVC anyway). But\nfor programmatic clients, you use a d=\r\nifferent approach, not based\non sessions. You use special API credentials, =\r\nwhich an account holder\ncan create (look under &#39;Settings&#39;). The client then=\r\n calculates a\nmessage signature for each request. You can read more about h=\r\now\nthis is done here: https://beta.vcider.com/api3/\n\nWe also wrote a low-le=\r\nvel and high-level client in Python, in case\nyou are interested in seeing a=\r\nn example client implementation. You\ncan find it on GitHub here: https://gi=\r\nthub.com/vCider/API\n\nAnyway, you guys know REST and I would love to hear yo=\r\nur feedback\non my attempt to design an API, which makes it easy for develop=\r\ners\nto get started by being &#39;human readable&#39;.\n\nThank you very much for any =\r\nfeedback...\n\nJuergen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
