When I POST an HTTP message of that media\n&gt; type to an HTTP server it seems reasonable to interprete this\n&gt; request as an intent to order something.\n\nonly if you somehow know that the resource you are POSTing to\nprocesses orders. RFC 2616 is quite clear on this matter, I\nthink:\n\n    The actual function performed by the POST method is\n    determined by the server and is usually dependent on the\n    Request-URI.\n\n&gt; The request is self-describing and its meaning is independent\n&gt; of the receiver. Especially does the self-descriptiveness\n&gt; protect me as a sender from changes of the receiver, changes\n&gt; that could otherwise assign a different meaning to my request.\n\n“Self-describing” means that you don’t need any data outside of\nthe full request in order to understand the request; it doesn’t\nmean you can actually know what the server is going to with it\nunless the server has made a particular promise to you.\n\n&gt; But what if I POST the order to an APP server as media (not\n&gt; using the enrtry envelope) thus basically asking for the same\n&gt; thing as above? Isn&#39;t the meaning of the request actually the\n&gt; placement of an order (see above) and not the request for\n&gt; storing my angle brackets order?\n\nNo. In AtomPP, the server makes a promise to you, by way of the\nservice document, that POST requests to particular URIs will be\ninterpreted as storage requests and processed in a particular\nmanner. And that’s what the server subsequently does.\n\n&gt; The &#39;201 Created&#39; I am likely to see in both cases isn&#39;t\n&gt; helping  much, to check the cients expectations.\n\nI quote from RFC 2616 again:\n\n    The action performed by the POST method might not result in a\n    resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case,\n    either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate\n    response status, depending on whether or not the response\n    includes an entity that describes the result.\n\n&gt; Maybe this seems far-fetched, but if it the receiver side\n&gt; actually *is* capable of affecting the meaning of my request,\n&gt; then I could send my orders in application/xml right away,\n&gt; effectively using HTTP as transport as opposed to transfer (to\n&gt; achieve coordination of peers).\n\nThe receiver is not affecting the meaning of your request because\nyour request does not have such finely specified semantics in the\nfirst place. POST is POST and means “process this somehow”;\nadding a particular media type into the mix does not make it mean\nanything more specific.\n\nRFC 2616 is definite on the matter: what the POST means depends\non the URI of the resource you are requesting. You need to know\nbeforehand how that resource will process your request, and this\nhappens by way of a promise the server makes, which it describes\nto you using a suitable hypermedia format.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
