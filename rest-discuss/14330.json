My way is visible=\r\n,\n&gt; because batch deletion occurs as separate DELETE requests to each\n&gt; mem=\r\nber resource.\n\nIt seems to me this isn&#39;t a &quot;REST mismatch&quot; so much as a mis=\r\nmatch\nbetween your desires and what APP gives you.  I don&#39;t know APP well,\n=\r\nbut it seems that the real problem is that APP doesn&#39;t expose the\ncollectio=\r\nn at the level of granularity that you desire.  When I read\nyour paragraph =\r\nabove, I see three &quot;resources&quot; (collection, contents,\nand collection+conten=\r\nts).  If you want them to be able to be DELETEd\nindependently, you&#39;ll need =\r\nto craft their exposure individually.  I\ndon&#39;t know, other than the fact th=\r\nat you&#39;re fighting with a protocol\non top of HTTP, it doesn&#39;t seem a lot di=\r\nfferent than any other\nREST-resource problem that might be fixed by changin=\r\ng the resources\nexposed, even if that means moving away from APP.\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
