As\n&gt; stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the\n&gt; developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we are\n&gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the\n&gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It\n&gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning.\n\nIt&#39;s quite normal that people use those levels as ranking. I think it would\nmake the intention much clearer if you would create a matrix instead of\nusing these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has support for routing\nand media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/semantics support.\n\nYou can&#39;t do that that easily with levels. Framework X is on level 3 and 5??\nIs it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? But maybe it&#39;s too late to\nchange that as the article has already been published..\n\n\n\n--\nMarkus Lanthaler\n@markuslanthaler\n\n\n"}}
