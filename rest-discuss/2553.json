Partial updates is very non-RESTful. Even if a user just\n&gt; wants to update their email address they should still have to upload\n&gt; all their other information. Remember, you&#39;re transferring resources\n&gt; not resource fragments or resource parameters. Your idea of using\n&gt; POST for partial updates seems a bit too RPC-like and it&#39;d only\n&gt; complicate most systems. Also in general you don&#39;t want to send fine-\n&gt; grained messages such as &#39;change my email address&#39;. The SOAP people\n&gt; are just discovering this [see\n&gt; http://www.fawcette.com/xmlmag/2002_06/magazine/departments/endtag/]\n&gt; but it&#39;s one of the fundamental tenets of REST.\n\nWould it be acceptible to ask the server for a URI that represented the part\nof the resource you want to update and treat it as if it&#39;s a true resource?\n\n&gt; Also, as a last note, there&#39;s nothing that says the user has to\n&gt; upload the entire resource when using PUT or that the server is not\n&gt; allowed to perform processing on the PUT entity body. The server\n&gt; still has final say over what is actually PUT&#39;ed to the URL.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I agree with that.  From the rfc:\n\n    &quot;If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the\n    enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version\n    of the one residing on the origin server.&quot;\n\nNow, I realize that it says &quot;SHOULD&quot; and not &quot;MUST&quot;.  But that&#39;s still\nsaying that using PUT in any other way is strongly discouraged.\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
