Updating one price\nupdates the other. But they are NOT the same resource.\n&gt; Why is it irrelevant? It seems to make more sense for users, caches, and\n&gt; other intermediaries if representations of the same resource are addressed\n&gt; from the same resource identifier. If the &#39;underneath&#39; is less ambiguously\n&gt; mapped to the interface that has to be a good thing, and therefore a\n&gt; relevant consideration.\n&gt;\n\nThe point of REST is that caches, users etc. dont CARE about what is\nunderneath at the server and only talk to the interface. This\ndecoupling gives most of the interesting properties that REST has.\n\nRegards\ndevdatta\n\n\n2008/11/22 Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt;:\n&gt; dev wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I simply don&#39;t agree that they need to be separate resources because\n&gt;&gt;&gt; they aren&#39;t separate resources.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; resources are interface level entities .. what is underneath at the\n&gt;&gt; server .- whether they are the same or not is irrelevant.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why is it irrelevant?
