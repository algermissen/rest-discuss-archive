(IMHO of course).\n&gt; \n&gt; i will take two examples where i have had to use cookies as keys to \n&gt; server-side session state:\n&gt; 1. shopping cart.\n&gt; 2. authentication.\n&gt; \n&gt; it seems to me that early web/REST people may have thought shopping \n&gt; carts would be handled as client side state, and be all posted to an \n&gt; /orders resource or whatever at the end.  however this isn&#39;t the \n&gt; reality of how client UAs work.  the state needs to be stored on the \n&gt; server because there isn&#39;t any standard way of doing it on the client.  \n\nBut having state on the server is surely fine with REST?\n\n&gt; you can&#39;t do this without a session, otherwise, what URI does the &#39;buy \n&gt; this item&#39; POST operate on?\n\nIf you create a &#39;basket&#39; resource for my shopping on the server, the\nI&#39;d imagine POST-ing new items into the basket. Once I was ready I&#39;d\nPOST a reference to the basket to the checkout URI. Why does this need\ncookies? - it can all be done if you ensure you &#39;carry&#39; the basket URI\naround the online shop as you go.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication\n&gt; &gt; mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\n&gt; &gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http\n&gt; &gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\n&gt; &gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\n&gt; &gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n&gt; \n&gt; i think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; as mentioned by others, user agents need to display the entity returned \n&gt; by the server.  i would say they also need to supply &#39;log out&#39; UI and \n&gt; make the current authentication status highly visible and obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; -vincent\n\n\n"}}
