Users can only interact with the=A0API=A0if th=\r\ney=92ve got an account. Let=92s say authorization happens overHTTP=A0Basic.=\r\n\n&gt; Given that, would you use URIs like=A0/photos=A0and=A0/photos/{id}=A0(as=\r\n a photo list and photo detail resource, respectively)? What=92s weird abou=\r\nt those URIs is that=A0my=A0/photos=A0is a different list of photos than=A0=\r\nyour=A0/photos=A0=97 in other words, the resource represented depends on th=\r\ne information in theAuthorization=A0header.\n&gt; It seems like URIs like=A0/pe=\r\nople/{my-uid}/photos=A0and=A0/people/{my-uid}/photos/{photo-id}=A0are more =\r\n=93pure.=94 But now that=92s weird because only one single user ever has ac=\r\ncess to a given=A0URI=A0(e.g only user #7 gets to access the entire space u=\r\nnder=A0/people/7). And the information in the=A0URI=A0is redundant with the=\r\n information in the=A0Authorization=A0header.\n&gt; I guess the question comes =\r\ndown to whether=A0HTTP=A0headers =93should=94 be allowed to determine the r=\r\nesource=A0returned.\n&gt; So which would you use?=A0Why?\n\nI&#39;d say I&#39;d favour us=\r\ning what he calls the &#39;pure&#39; approach, but I&#39;m no\nexpert and wanted to cros=\r\ns check with you folks.\n\nThanks,\nSidu.\nhttp://c42.in\n\n"}}
