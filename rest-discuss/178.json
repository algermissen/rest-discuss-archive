It couldn&#39;t just be passed-through as most\n&gt; intermediaries do, it would have to be cracked open and processed\n&gt; on each hop.\n\nI think I understand - since the requests and responses are the way\nintermediaries understand the resource system (the Web) and maintain useful\nstate about them (deleted, created, etc.) if the requests and responses\naren&#39;t right there at the top, then they would pass through intermediaries,\nbut the intermediaries would be blind to the information and not able to\ncurrently reflect the state of the resourc system (no cache updates, etc.)\n\nI hadn&#39;t gone to that extent, and while I agree with you, I&#39;m more\ninterested in providing functionality to firewalled nodes than in preserving\nthe public state of the resource system, mainly because I don&#39;t think the\nresources are that public, and also the traffic probably would pass through\na special gateway and beyond that the requests & responses would be at the\ntop of the stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
