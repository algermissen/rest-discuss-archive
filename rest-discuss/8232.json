Am I missing something?\n&gt; I cannot conceive of any arrangement of resources in which the\n&gt; GET count would benefit from resources, regardless of whether\n&gt; X == Y or X =/= Y.\n\nI think Chuck was just trying to push to the edge the reasoning about\nwhat is &quot;RESTfull&quot; with a resource modifying itself.\n\nThe example he comes up with of course is a really common one. It&#39;s a\nsequence basically as used for web counting.\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very RESTfull, but I don&#39;t really have\na problem with it as a web counter either. REST, to me, is about\nscalability and I think I could scale a webcounter built like this\nwithout having to pay a fortune in hardware (compared to hit rate that\nis).\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
