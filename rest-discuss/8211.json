I do use the commons http client\n&gt; (just downloaded and integrated the v3.1 rc1 library this afternoon)\n&gt; So it seems that there are two projects dealing with an HTTP Client - one in\n&gt; &#39;commons&#39; and one in &#39;jakarta&#39;. The &#39;jakarta&#39; one (v4) is intended to take\n&gt; over for the &#39;commons&#39; ( v3.1). I assume this issue affects both of those\n&gt; code bases.\n\nI think so.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Providing Java a very standards compliant as well as full featured\n&gt; components for HTTP from the Open Source community is very important but I\n&gt; don&#39;t know that the particular hosting project - whether it&#39;s the Apache\n&gt; &#39;Web Service&#39; project or something else - is that important. I&#39;m suprised\n&gt; that the amount of activity is a factor at all - support for HTTP should be\n&gt; relatively stable. Maybe some work on alternate approaches (non-blocking IO\n&gt; for example) being the kind of activity I would expect.\n\nheh, take a look at how much Java5 and 6 have adapted to support\ncookies and proxies out the box -and note that the automatic proxy\nstuff is broken on linux, and works well enough on windows to stop\noracle JDBC drivers working (which tells you about JDBC over HTTP).\nThere&#39;s work to be done there, still.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I can chime in on the discussion over there, but without a suggested landing\n&gt; spot for the code I&#39;m not sure what value I could add.\n\nIt can certainly go in to Apache WS, who will be glad for it, but it\nwould clearly benefit from more grateful users on the mailing list\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
