More generally, if the resource state space is bigger =\r\nthan the representation state space, this doesn&#39;t speak to the issue. If th=\r\ne intention is to specifically forbid PUT on such resources, I suggest maki=\r\nng this explicit. If not, I don&#39;t see how we can ever expect a single repre=\r\nsentation to fully replace the resource state. The server should be free to=\r\n gap fill this state, and the most obvious thing to do is to leave it alone=\r\n. Indeed, the next sentence seems to imply you only require resetting resou=\r\nrce state expressable in the representation.\n\n&quot;A successful PUT of a given =\r\nrepresentation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same target reso=\r\nurce will result in an equivalent representation being returned in a 200 (O=\r\nK) response.&quot;\n\nI gave an example of a resource that produced two representa=\r\ntions, one in pure text another as SVG with a drawing and a caption matchin=\r\ng the text. If I use PUT of the text to change the caption while rememberin=\r\ng the drawing, I&#39;m doing a partial update via PUT that complies with the le=\r\ntter and spirit of this sentence, am I not?\n\nAlso, who defines &quot;equivalent&quot;=\r\n here? If I as a media type author or server owner get to define this, I ca=\r\nn milk interesting equivalence relations quite a long way. \n\n--- In rest-di=\r\nscuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Roy T.
