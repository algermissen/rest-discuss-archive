I think I basically have the same\nquesti=\r\non myself and would like to know if this approach might be\nconsidered Un-RE=\r\nSTful?\n\nTo add another example, I&#39;m looking at building a RESTful mortgage\n=\r\napplication system; its resources might look something like this:\n\nApplicat=\r\nion\n--Applicants\n----Applicant\n------Address\n------EmploymentHistory\n------=\r\nFinancialHistory\n--PropertyDetails\n----Address\netc...\n\nI can see two ways t=\r\nhat our customers may want to use the system:\n\n1) Navigate through the reso=\r\nurces, following each link, adding more\nand more information as they go.\n\no=\r\nr\n\n2) Send all the data in one go. Or as much as they have available,\nperha=\r\nps returning later to navigate through and fill in the gaps.\n\nTo accommodat=\r\ne both scenarios a POST to /Application could examine the\namount of data th=\r\nat was sent and create a varying number of child\nresources accordingly.\n\nI =\r\nfeel like it &quot;smells a bit&quot; because a GET to /Application would\nreturn a di=\r\nfferent (i.e. shorter) representation than that which can\nbe POSTed back.\n\n=\r\nDoes anyone consider this kind of approach to be Un-RESTful?   If so,\nwhy, =\r\nand any suggestions on how it can be made more RESTful?\n\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ernst, Matthias&quot;\n&lt;matthias.ernst@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; one of the cornerstones of RESTful design is the concept of\n&gt; hierarchy=\r\n and containment - such as POST in the sense of &quot;insert new\nchild&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm trying to make use of this for the configuration of a hierarchical\n&gt; serv=\r\nice container about as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /container  :  answer a representa=\r\ntion of the container&#39;s\nconfiguration (port, max threads, ...) including li=\r\nnks to all services\n&gt; PUT /container :   reconfigure the container\n&gt; \n&gt; POS=\r\nT /container:   add service\n&gt; GET /container/{service}:  answer service con=\r\nfiguration\n&gt; PUT /container/{service}:  add/reconfigure service\n&gt; DELETE /c=\r\nontainer/{service}: remove service\n&gt; \n&gt; So far so good. However, I&#39;m unsure=\r\n about the significance of the\nservice configuration links in the container=\r\n resource. PUTting to the\ncontainer resource with fewer service links, shou=\r\nld that indicate the\ndeletion of a service? Or should I ignore those?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAlso, I&#39;d like to GET/PUT the _entire_ configuration (container +\nservices)=\r\n in one representation, i.e. one that contains the service\nconfigurations i=\r\nn the container configuration instead of links.\n&gt; PUTting that representati=\r\non to /container would then also create,\nreconfigure or delete services.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; How would you represent that? A different URI? A different\nMIME-Type? GE=\r\nT /container with accept:\napplication/entireconfiguration+xml vs\napplicatio=\r\nn/containerconfiguration+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; Or I could use the same mime type but mak=\r\ne the child representations\noptional in the schema: GET /container always i=\r\nncludes the service\nconfigurations including their individual links, embedd=\r\ned in a\n&lt;services&gt; element. PUTting a representation that does not include\n=\r\nsaid &lt;services&gt; element would only update the container resource.\nIncluding=\r\n the &lt;services&gt; element would indicate that I want to\nconfigure all service=\r\ns at once, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that make sense to you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
