Well, there \n&gt; is an HTML representation available, primarily so Yahoo! can insert ads \n&gt; into the post.  But I don&#39;t see XML containing any &#39;information&#39; of any \n&gt; value here.\n\nBut try marking it, or any other narrative structure, up in JSON. \nAccount for mixed content, repetition, recursive nesting, and all the \nother structures we find in real human writing. JSON becomes an \nillegible mess at best. XML doesn&#39;t blink. (at least unless overlap \nrears its head).\n\n&gt; When I open my web browser, I&#39;m typically seeing markup (HTML, usually \n&gt; not XML) which is used primarily for visual rendering.  It seems fairly \n&gt; rare when you find any web content for which the markup contains \n&gt; semantic value.  Microformats are a great counter-example, but are still \n&gt; not widely adopted.  I was hoping you&#39;d provide more examples like \n&gt; Microformats.\n\nSo? XML can do this. JSON can&#39;t. Try converting HTML to JSON and XHTML \nsome time. See which one is easier to work with.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Most of the world&#39;s information is *not* in relational databases. It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; not in databases of any kind. It&#39;s locked up in books, Word documents,\n&gt;&gt; PowerPoint presentation (well, I suppose most of those are technically\n&gt;&gt; information-free :-) ) and so on. You get the idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see how XML helps here; if you want to mine this data, you need \n&gt; a natural language understanding engine.  Do you really think there&#39;s \n&gt; much semantic markup used in existing word and powerpoint documents?\n\nMore than you&#39;d think, but regardless XML can handle this and JSON can&#39;t.\n\n&gt; However, I&#39;m not convinced that XML is the be-all, end-all story for \n&gt; structuring information; in many cases, data can in fact be reduced to \n&gt; simple data structures; in those cases, I&#39;ll claim that there are \n&gt; easier-to-parse, easier-to-read, easier-to-map-to-progLangs and smaller \n&gt; renderings of that information.\n\n\nIt&#39;s not the be-all, end-all solution; but you make it clear yous till \ndon&#39;t get it. The problem is most definitely not &quot;structuring \ninformation&quot;. The problem is understanding information in its \nunstructured reality. XML is less structured than JSON; and that makes \nit more powerful, more useful, and more faithful to reality.\n\nI still think ultimately we need to come to grips with truly \nunstructured information, and XML doesn&#39;t do that; but it is further \nalong in that direction than JSON is.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
