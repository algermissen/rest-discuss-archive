This link points to the list of additional =\r\nproperties for that resource (at the URL &quot;{additional-properties}&quot;).\n\n2) Th=\r\ne URL &quot;{additional-properties}&quot; returns a list of key/value properties for =\r\nreading.\n\n3) For each key/value in the list there will be links for a) edit=\r\ning the value of the key, and 2) deleting the key.\n\n3a) Editing is as simpl=\r\ne as PUTing a new value to the URL.\n\n3b) Deleting a key is as simple as a H=\r\nTTP DELETE of the URL.\n\n4) The list also contains a link for adding new pro=\r\nperties.\n\nWhat would be a suitable (simple) media-type for this?\n\nI am cons=\r\nidering ATOM (which is nice for lists), but that seems like quite a bit of =\r\noverkill. HTML might also be useful (but does not support PUT, but POST wou=\r\nld be okay too). A home-grown application/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility=\r\n.\n\nWhat would you guys do?\n\nThanks, J=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
