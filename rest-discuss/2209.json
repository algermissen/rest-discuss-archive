If no action when due,\nthe proposal is void.\n\n&gt;     b. take your contract proposal and publish it \n&gt;        as a resource to be modified collaboratively \n&gt;        until both sides are ready to sign it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The contract I assert does not exist is the contract \n&gt; to recognize another  contract and host it.  \n\nWe&#39;ve discussed two models:\n1. one resource, which one party hosts, and\n2. two resources, which must be kept in sync.\n\n(In real life, there will always be two copies,\nbut in the first model, only one has a URI.)\n\n&gt; And in business, this is also the case, is it not?\n\nThe contract for negotiating contracts \nmust be negotiated first.  \nFortunately, such things are being developed\nby standards orgs.\nUnfortunately, none are RESTful (so far).\n\nBut after having worked on some of the non-RESTful\napproaches, I think the REST principle that \neverything important be a resource with its own URI \nwould solve a lot of currently unsolved problems.\n(That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, by the way.)\n\nCan REST can solve all the conversational\nprotocol problems? Don&#39;t know for sure.\nI think so.  Can&#39;t prove it yet.\n\nP.S. In case it wasn&#39;t clear, when I wrote that \nit is possible to have POST create sub-resource, \n* I didn&#39;t mean that POST cannot also be used\nin other ways, and\n* I meant that a &quot;sub-resource&quot;  or &quot;subordinate resource&quot; \nis a real resource with its own URI, just hyperlinked \nto its container.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
