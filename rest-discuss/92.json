The difference isn&#39;t in &quot;something&quot; or &quot;something final&quot; --- it&#39;s in\n&gt;&gt; vs. &gt;, aka POST vs. PUT.  Let me restate the sloppy example in a clearer\nfashion:\n\nPOST is like        echo &quot;something&quot; &gt;&gt; foo\nPUT is like          echo &quot;something&quot; &gt; foo\n\nRepeated POSTS of the same content are not necessarily idempotent;  repeated\nPUTs are.  The semantic differences are in the methods, with no additional need\nfor status codes embedded in the message, different resources, etc.  The\nsemantics of POST are that the state of the resource (i.e., progress of the\ntransaction) is updated, while PUT implies that the state of the resource is\nreplaced.  It&#39;s appropriate to view *replacement* of the resource state as the\nfinalization of the transaction.\n\n&gt; One thought would be to make both the &#39;intermediate status&#39; and the\n&gt; &#39;response&#39; both URI addressable.\n\nWhy not simply have content POSTED to the &quot;progress-of-the-transaction&quot; resource\nindicate intermediate changes of state, while the first content successfully PUT\nto the resource indicates the completion of the interaction?  I may be missing\nsomething really obvious, but I still don&#39;t think you need anything new, here.\nI think POST and PUT to the same resource are sufficient.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
