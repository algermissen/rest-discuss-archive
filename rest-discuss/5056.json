RDF Forms is used in a manner similar to an HTML form in that\n&gt;    they are obtained at &quot;runtime&quot; in order to construct an actual\n&gt;    request at a particular URI.  WRDL on the other hand, \n&gt;    (while still obtainable using a GET) is more geared towards \n&gt;    declaring the entire service interface before hand.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Actually then, they could be used together.\n&gt; \n&gt;    If both were used to describe a particular service, the \n&gt;    WRDL would be declared to return an RDF Form with the GET,\n&gt;    and presumably the WRDL would also declare the same type\n&gt;    of representation/document that the RDF Form would \n&gt;    construct for a POST and GET query string.  In that regard\n&gt;    there would be some overlap.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Are these statements accurate?\n\nI suppose there&#39;s some ambiguity, but I see them as doing pretty much\nthe same thing.  If you made the value of WRDL&#39;s &quot;representations&quot;\nattribute, media types, then I think we&#39;d be declaring almost exactly\nthe same thing.  RDF Forms just goes a bit more abstract using class\nnames to suggest operational semantics, whereas WRDL uses the operations\nthemselves.\n\n&gt; 2. With WRDL it is possible to specify multiple possible \n&gt;    document types that could be submitted with POST.\n&gt;   \n&gt;    Is it possible to declare an RDF Form that allows multiple\n&gt;    document types?  E.g., the ability to submit a Book or a\n&gt;    CD representation to an Order resource?\n\nYup, just specify multiple acceptedMediaType triples.\n\n&gt; 3. Is there a way to define a PUT operation in RDF Forms?\n\nIt was in there initially (as a Replaceable class), but I removed it,\nfiguring that PUT wasn&#39;t parameterizable so didn&#39;t need it (i.e. it&#39;s\nuse was implicit).  I&#39;ve recently thought about adding it back in to\nsupport declaring the accepted media types.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
