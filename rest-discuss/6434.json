Which is their problem,\n&gt; they think that anything being PUT should _be_ the entity. Not a\n&gt; representation of the entity; that is clearly mad.\n\nDemonstrably so I&#39;d say. Which of course offers a solution - demonstrate it.\n\nClearest case is that a resource which cont-neg selection of \nrepresentations would be put into an ambiguous state if updating one \nrepresentation didn&#39;t update all the others (not to say a PUT should \n*always* update all representations - since sometimes the server \napplication doesn&#39;t have the wherewithal to determine how the rest \nshould be updated).\n\n"}}
