To clarify, I was saying that you can&#39;t get a list of resources from a\n&gt; server and expect that list to contain the URI for the resource you are\n&gt; about to create. I want to PUT a comment to a discussion group - what URI\n&gt; should I use? \n\nYou want to POST a message to a discussion group? Use POST! It can\nreturn a URI. Is there a hitch I don&#39;t see?\n\n&gt; It seems that PUT should only be used for update and not create - you still\n&gt; have to have the server determine the URI and use a multi-step operation or\n&gt; a different method. \n\nIn general I would agree with that, but there is a subtlety. In some\nsituations (particularly content management) the client owns the\nnamespace and the server just puts things where the client asks.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
