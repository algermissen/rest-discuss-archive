And Eric and \nMike hits exactly where it hurts :-) See \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18127:\n\nMike&gt; each time a dev\n&gt; spits out custom XML or JSON serializations of internal objects, a\n&gt; &quot;new media type&quot; is born (and i think someone kicks a cat, too).\n&gt;\nEric&gt; Yeah, that would be me...\n\nWhich leaves me with that feeling of &quot;yes, I am not ignorant, I hear what \nyou are saying, but apparently I am blind for the alternatives&quot;. There are \nendless numbers of different domains out there: we can fit it all into HTML \nfor humans to read (the web has proven that already), but I cannot see how \nwe can make clients for M2M interaction without hardwiring domain knowledge \ninto them?\n\nAs Paul states it &quot;The web is not recompiled every morning - yet it works!&quot;. \nSure! But we do not recompile it because humans are so good at adopting to \nwhatever they see on a screen. But for a M2M system to work it surely must \nbe recompiled in order to understand new or changed semantics of the domain \nit works with. Yes, it can be built such that new features are ignored by \nold clients and that is certainly worth striving for - but new clients are \nneeded for new semantics.\n\n/J�rn\n\n\n"}}
