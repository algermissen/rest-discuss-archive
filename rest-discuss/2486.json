They shine the beam into \na detector, which translates the beam&#39;s &#39;entangled&#39; photons into a \nradio signal, beam /that/ across the room, and use it to reconstruct \nthe &#39;original&#39; beam.  Problem is, the original beam is destroyed in \nthe process.  I personally think this is a little bogus, because it \nisn&#39;t the original beam that comes out the other end, just a &#39;copy&#39;.\n\nI thought this was great at describing the way you can&#39;t get a \nresource, only a representation.  But it&#39;s WRONG.\n\nI thought of internet-connected fridges and air-conditioners\n\nGET www.my-airconditioner.net/bedroom/temperature HTTP/1.1\n\n-&gt;  24 degrees C\n\nPOST www.my-airconditioner.net/bedroom/temperature HTTP/1.1\nContent-type: text/xml\n\n&lt;new-temperature&gt;19&lt;/new-temperature&gt;\n\n-&gt; 200 OK\n(a bit more comfortable)\n\nDoes that make my air conditioner a resource?  I really couldn&#39;t \ntell.  So I went to the source, and read 5.2.2.1-2 of Roy&#39;s \ndissertation over and over.  And got confused.\n\n&lt;quote&gt;Any information that can be named can be a resource: a \ndocument or image, a temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los \nAngeles&quot;), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object \n(e.g. a person), and so on&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nThat means it is possible that the air conditioner /could be/ a \nresource, by Roy&#39;s use of the word &#39;can&#39;, and inclusion of non-\nvirtual objects. No?\n\n&lt;quote&gt;In other words, any concept that might be the target of an \nauthor&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a \nresource&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nWhat?  That means my air conditioner isn&#39;t a resource, because I \ncan&#39;t reference it through hypertext (HTTP).  It does have a \ntemperature function, however, that I can reference.  Does the \npresence of the temperature function as part of the air conditioner \nmake the air conditioner a resource?\n\n&lt;quote&gt;A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not \nthe entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in \ntime  More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership \nfunction M&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(t), which for time t maps to a set of \nentities, or values, which are equivalent. The values in the set may \nbe resource representations and/or resource identifiers&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nAh, the resource is nothing I can ever get my hands on.  The resource \nis the &#39;concept&#39; that maps to reporting/changing temperature in my \nbedroom (and/or humidity, if my air conditioner was fancy enough).  \nSo the air conditioner itself, the physical, plastic reality of the \nthing, is not a resource.  But by the act of mapping some of its \nfunctions as URIs, it becomes conceptually a resource, providing \nrepresentations of its functions.  Additionally, the functions of \ntemperature and humidity, though subordinate to the air conditioner, \nbecause they are both concepts that map to one or more \nrepresentations (change temperature, report temperature).\n\nSo now I see it is /both/.  It is the act of performing the mapping \nthat makes a resource, in the context of REST.  This makes my PUT \nabove a representation, but not a resource, because I am not defining \nthe mapping, I am using it.\n\nIn a similar vein, just because I can identify my air conditioner, \ndoesn&#39;t mean that it has identity /in the context of REST/.  It is \nonly the representations of its functions that it provides as URIs \nthat have any identity /in the context of REST/.\n\nI keep repeating that about context, because I keep losing it in the \ndiscussion.\n\nHowever, at this moment, I am basking in extraordinary clarity. I can \nsee a way ahead to do something practical.\n\n1) Define a resource, conceptually\n2) Define representations of that resource\n3) Map one URI to each representation - two representations being \nequivalent at some time does not confuse the issue, they are \nrepresentations I have chosen to present.\n4) Give the URIs to others to play with  :-)\n\n\nA note:\nReading RFC 2068 Section 9.6 on PUT, I see a lot of stuff about \nPUTting resources, not representations.  I think this means to me, in \nthe light of what is above, that put /creates/ resources while, ie \nthe conceptual mapping of some thing/function, and its associated \nrepresentations.  A PUT to\n\nhttp://www.myairconditioner.net/time\n\nmay add a &#39;time&#39; component (also a resource in its own right, in lieu \nof the fact that it provides one or more representations) that allows \nme to GET the time, or POST a time if it&#39;s wrong.  This is seen to \nhave a dual purpose: while the conceptual framework of the air \nconditioner (a resource) is /modified/ by the PUT, the conceptual \nframework of the time functions (also a resource) is /created/.\n\nRoy says I can&#39;t GET the time functions that I just PUT, though, \nbecause you can&#39;t GET resources.  I can, however, GET a \nrepresentation which seems to me like a fine compromise - the RFC \nsays nothing about GETting back what you put, so that&#39;s OK (an indeed \nnecessary by definition of a resource).\n\nIn a Java/Tomcat context, this also means that I am PUTting Java \nclass files the place I specify, creating a new &#39;context&#39; in my \nserver configuration file, and running the manager program to start \nthat context up within the Tomcat container.  I don&#39;t see any problem \nwith this except in regards to security.\n\nMichael\n\n\n\n"}}
