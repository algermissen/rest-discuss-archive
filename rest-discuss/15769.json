They seem to be similar to Jan&#39;s, so I&#39;ll watch to see they emerge as the consensus. They certainly seem reasonable.\n\nI&#39;m not attached to BPMN in particular, but then the question is what else is there? This standard is well tooled in terms of GUIs for building the actual documents. I don&#39;t have personal knowledge of the difficulties of consuming this (or other standards) to runtime environments, but there are workflow engines, both COTS and open source, that try to do it. However, most have a SOAP bent (sometimes BPEL) for orchestrating service calls once you get to the runtime. I don&#39;t think the hard part here is SOAP vs REST, but the inherent difficulty in trying to express how to map data elements from the process instance representation to and from what the orchestrated endpoints use. One thought is to code these with either XSLT or javascript that can be delivered as RESTful resources.\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Alan Dean &lt;alan.dean@...&gt;\n\n4) Workflow Orchestration\n\nI don&#39;t have a canned answer to this. I&#39;m not aware of a RESTful business process protocol (though I certainly think that we need one) and whilst I am not familiar with BPMN, I note that it&#39;s wikipedia entry lists &quot;ambiguity and confusion in sharing BPMN models&quot; as a weakness [vi] which doesn&#39;t bode well for it&#39;s RESTfulness, I suspect (alongside &quot;converting BPMN models to executable environments&quot;).\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
