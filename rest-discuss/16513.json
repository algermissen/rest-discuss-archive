Where does it say that tho=\r\nse &#39;x&#39; types can\n&gt; not be registered elsewere, namelly by the parties that =\r\nagreed on\n&gt; then, thus fullfilling that registered aspect of self-descriptn=\r\ness?\n&gt; \n\nIt doesn&#39;t.  But if you care one whit about anybody else, particul=\r\narly\nan intermediary (or Google), re-using your content (like, to pre-cache=\r\n\nDNS lookups, or store it in cache) on the Web, then the only registry\nanyb=\r\nody and everybody agrees on is IANA, which by virtue of not listing\nthem, d=\r\neclares them to be &quot;experimental&quot; as opposed to &quot;standardized,&quot;\nthus render=\r\ning them non-self-descriptive.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; No it&#39;s not, because application/xml i=\r\ns a IANA registered type, and so\n&gt; intermediaries can know about i&#39;s securi=\r\nty level, they can cache it,\n&gt; they can do a lot of things with it that the=\r\ny normally do. They don&#39;t\n&gt; know their processing model and so they can&#39;t p=\r\nrefetch links and the\n&gt; like? True, but that&#39;s the trade-off that Roy also =\r\ntalked about. Do\n&gt; you want quotes about this?\n&gt; \n\nThe unRESTfulness of app=\r\nlication/xml is an established fact within this\ncommunity, which has been s=\r\nubject to plenty of debate, with the final\nword on the subject coming from =\r\nRoy.  If anything, this is off-topic to\nthis thread.  My every assertion is=\r\nn&#39;t based on some whim.  Registered\nand ubiquitous, yes, but my demo&#39;s conn=\r\neg result of serving application/\nxhtml+xml to any browser it can is RESTfu=\r\nl, while its serving\napplication/xml to IE is indisputably a REST mismatch,=\r\n no matter how\npragmatic it is for me to do so.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, being unregist=\r\nered in IANA like the x-types doesent imply they\n&gt; cannot be registered els=\r\newhere, namelly by the interested parties that\n&gt; agreed on their definition=\r\n.\n&gt; \n\nBut if you&#39;re expecting it to scale on the deployed infrastructure of=\r\n\nthe Web, you&#39;re in for a rude awakening -- nobody else will ever be an\nint=\r\nerested party, making your API library-based, not network-based, as\ndiscuss=\r\ned in REST Chapter 6.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; No, what is critical to the style is that inter=\r\nested parties determine\n&gt; precisely what the intended processing model is -=\r\n that *can or can\n&gt; not* be anybody.\n&gt; \n\nIf your goal is to scale on the de=\r\nployed infrastructure of the Web,\nthen you must assume that *everybody* is =\r\na potential participant, which\nis what is meant by serendipitous re-use and=\r\n anarchic scalability -- if\nyou make it possible for random folks to ramp y=\r\nour system up to Internet\nscale by using ubiquitous identifiers, they will =\r\ndo just that, and you\ndon&#39;t even have to ask...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=A0If the goal of you=\r\nr system is to scale on the Web, then any\n&gt; &gt; intermediary must be able to =\r\ndeduce precisely the intended\n&gt; &gt; processing model, without needing to look=\r\n beyond the IANA registry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you really believe that intermediaries l=\r\nook up the IANA registry\n&gt; every time they see a media type they don&#39;t alre=\r\nady know?\n&gt;\n\nDo you really believe that any sysadmin at Google, or responsi=\r\nble for\nsome intermediary&#39;s configuration at some ISP, is going to spend on=\r\ne\nsecond of their time searching for the meaning of experimental, opaque\nid=\r\nentifiers, rather than just excluding those types wholesale?\n\nThe only thin=\r\ng looking anything up in the IANA registry is people, and\nthose people don&#39;=\r\nt even have time to do that -- rather, they just\nconfigure for the limited =\r\nnumber of ubiquitous types whose well-known\nprocessing models account for 1=\r\n00% of the traffic they care to cache or\notherwise interact with.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;=\r\ns  say I register a type application/gatosapato+xml where I\n&gt; defined &lt;miau=\r\n&gt; to indicate a hipermedia transition. Do you think\n&gt; that  when a intermed=\r\niarie sees that it will prefetch the target of\n&gt; &lt;miau&gt;?\n&gt; \n\nNo, I think th=\r\nat&#39;s the *last* thing you can expect them to do.  The\nmost you can expect i=\r\ns to be treated as application/xml, which in\npractice means that, *if* an i=\r\nntermediary bothers with it at all\n(beyond caching, which will be reliable)=\r\n, it will either determine to\ntreat it as HTML or, if that doesn&#39;t work, co=\r\nnsider links to be\nXInclude, rdf:about, or XLink.  Is that really your proc=\r\nessing model?\nThen how would any intermediary determine that &lt;miau&gt; has any=\r\nthing to\ndo with linking?\n\nBetter, from the sysadmin-at-large-on-the-Web re=\r\nality of things, to\nsimply ignore your content, if not block it as an attem=\r\npt at tunneling,\nparticularly on PUT or POST.  Although, anything ending +x=\r\nml will\nprobably cache OK, but caching is hardly the be-all and end-all of =\r\nwhat\nWeb intermediaries do these days.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If not, what is the diference b=\r\netween a IANA registered\n&gt; application/gatosapato+xml and a IANA unregister=\r\ned - but registered at\n&gt; Gatos&Sapatos.com with the agreement of all partie=\r\ns interested in\n&gt; Gatos and in Sapatos - whose identifier is\n&gt; application/=\r\nx-gatosapato+xml?\n&gt; \n\nThat still comes down to the goals of your system.  I=\r\nf you expect\nGoogle or anyone else to re-use your content in a serendipitou=\r\ns fashion\naimed at anarchic scalability, you&#39;ll need to stick with ubiquito=\r\nus\nidentifiers, because it&#39;s unlikely to occur otherwise.  You can at\nleast=\r\n meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint by registering an\nidentifie=\r\nr, but the one you propose is unlikely to be approved (its\nsyntax is that o=\r\nf the standards tree), the correct syntax would be\napplication/vnd.gatosapa=\r\nto+xml, which has a very low bar for approval.\n\nIf you only care about cach=\r\ning, that would be good enough.  But if you\nwant your links understood as l=\r\ninks, you&#39;ll need to stick to well-known\nprocessing models, unless you expe=\r\nct your vnd. type to be adopted\nwidely enough to ever be more than a blip o=\r\nn the radar.  Again, my\ncontext is the Web, not your intranet/extranet -- i=\r\nf the only consumer\nthat you care about is a partner corporation, then you =\r\nshould be using\nHTTPS to traverse the Internet, which makes IANA irrelevant=\r\n to your\nneeds.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
