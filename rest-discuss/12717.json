Why 10 at all? Why not 5 or 20, etc. Since one of the\npoints of the idiom is that the client is not supposed to generate\nthese links like hand, there needs to be some mechanism for the\nservice to provide those link for the client.\n\nNow, this can be done several ways. One, is simply that there will be\nno service that can give you the link to, say, page 73. However, there\nwill be services that can let you step your way, and zero in on the\npage. You could say &quot;here&#39;s all of the pages, in blocks of 100&quot;\n(1-100, 101-200, 201-300...). Use on of those links and you can get\nlist of pages in the 10s (201-210, 211-220), and finally, those block\nwill give you the 201, 202, 203, etc. pages.\n\nSo, there is an algorithm to walk the links without necessarily giving\nthe algorithm to the client. You present it as workflow.\n\nMy point here is that this concept can be extended to other services\nbesides paging, like what was suggested here.\n\nAs I said, I&#39;m new here, and new to thinking in this mode, so I may be\nutterly off base. Opinions appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n\n"}}
