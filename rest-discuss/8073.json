I never head of anybody\n&gt;&gt; directly criticizing what he was doing; maybe it was\n&gt;&gt; because it was an insanely useful integration, despite\n&gt;&gt; the means.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually read a lot of bitching about it (though I can&#39;t quickly dig up\n&gt; the links), but the bitching seemed to be about principle while offering no\n&gt; tagible alternative solution, and ignoring the pragmatism of Jon&#39;s design\n&gt; and more importantly the minimal downsides if it broke. \n\nI&#39;m all for utilitarian computing.\n\n&gt; On that latter it\n&gt; seems to me the magnitude of problem created by violating URI Opacity is\n&gt; proportional to the amount of deployed code that utilizies the violation. In\n&gt; Jon&#39;s Amazon scrape it was in one place on his server, which he could\n&gt; quickly fix assuming Amazon did not eliminate the ISBN from the URL, and he\n&gt; could probably devise a creative fix even if they did eliminate the ISBN\n&gt; from the URL.\n\nGood point, never thought of it as &quot;deployed only once&quot;.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
