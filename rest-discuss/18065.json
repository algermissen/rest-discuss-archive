There\nexist generic client-server interactions, which may be found to overlap\nin any number of Internet protocols:  create, update, replace, delete,\nretrieve, patch, copy, move, lock, unlock and more.  Self-descriptive\nmessaging is based on unambiguously defining the semantics of the\ntransaction via standard methods, not mapping methods to characteristics\nshared between subsets of these generic transaction semantics -- what&#39;s\nstandardized about that?!?\n\nIf I just know a method maps to &#39;idempotency&#39;, how do I know if it&#39;s a\npartial or a full update?  On the principle of generality, what\nexisting protocols are you basing the definition of methods as\ntransaction characteristics?  HTTP re-uses generic methods common (if\nnamed differently) across myriad protocols -- hence the ability to\ninterface with other protocols, which is lost if the definition of PUT\nis based on the characteristic of idempotency and no longer resembles\nthe creation/update semantics assigned to PUT (or similar) by other\nprotocols.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If the objective of self-descriptiveness is the facilitation of\n&gt; intermediate processing, and you are claiming a web-wide requirement\n&gt; for creation/replace semantics, then by inference we should have\n&gt; examples of standard web infrastructure (i.e. intermediary\n&gt; mechanisms/protocols) that depend on this exact semantic.. what are\n&gt; they?\n&gt; \n\nI could never have predicted half of the intermediary optimizations\napplied to GET, why would I attempt to do so for PUT which accounts for\nan infinitesimal amount of traffic by comparison?  Just because there&#39;s\nno motivation to optimize PUT isn&#39;t reason to change its meaning due to\nthe lack.  Instead of strawman arguments about objectives, I suggest\nyou re-read Roy&#39;s thesis, for the rationale behind self-descriptiveness.\n\nYou conveniently leave out compatibility with other protocols, when\nsuggesting the entire paradigm of HTTP be changed such that methods are\nno longer mapped to transaction semantics, but to shared characteristics\nof these transactions -- so I believe the burden is on you to falsify\nRoy&#39;s thesis, not me to account for intermediary optimizations of PUT\nwhich nobody has thought of, or more likely, that I&#39;m simply not aware\nof (like with GET).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
