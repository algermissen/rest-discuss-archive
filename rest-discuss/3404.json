My understanding is that 401 allows you to\n&gt; *authenticate*, not *log in*.  &quot;Logging in&quot; implies maintaining some form\nof\n&gt; server-side session state, which is a big REST no-no (at least as I\n&gt; understand it).\n\nI think, if I understand this discussion, what&#39;s wanted is a protocol\nbetween user and UA, in which login session does exist, such that\nthe UA knows when to stop sending the credentials to the server.\nThat would constitute a logout.  There&#39;s certainly nothing wrong with\nmaintaining a session between user and UI, is there?  Otherwise,\nthe user has to type credentials over and over, which is no good.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
