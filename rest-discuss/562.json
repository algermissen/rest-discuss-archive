The only question is\n&gt; whether the spec should be explicit about that or just depend on common\n&gt; sense. I&#39;m in favour of being explicit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next question is whether to hard-code a method. My sense is that you\n&gt; don&#39;t buy much by doing so. 99% of all services will use PUT or POST\n&gt; depending on whether the change is relative to the previous state fo the\n&gt; resource or absolute (Mark Baker&#39;s idea...stock price change versus new\n&gt; stock price).\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving open the option of other methods doesn&#39;t seem to have much\n&gt; interoperability cost to me. People will only use it when they think\n&gt; that their subscribers will understand it. And it &quot;feels&quot; to me like it\n&gt; might allow some kinds of coordination where I say: &quot;this thing is going\n&gt; to change in the future. I want that change to trigger a DELETE over\n&gt; here and a LOCK over there and ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course authentication issues get weird because now the publisher is\n&gt; standing in for you...so this might not work really in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
