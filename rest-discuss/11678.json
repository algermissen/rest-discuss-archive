That never caught on though, and I expect\n&gt; rest-beginne=\r\nrs would see a similar fate.\n\nNormally I would think 2 forums would be coun=\r\nter-productive but as\nsomeone whose been monitoring this forum for a few mo=\r\nnths (maybe more)\nI&#39;m really not sure its content that&#39;s written for people=\r\n who are\nrelatively new to REST.\n\nPerhaps the beginner/advanced discussions=\r\n can sit happily in one forum\nbut my worry is that any beginner (or interme=\r\ndiate) discussions would\nprobably just end up mired in discussions of detai=\r\nls.\n\nThe very detailed oriented discussions would probably be fine but from=\r\n\nwhat I&#39;ve seen there is a lack of consistently good REST content out\nthere=\r\n on the Web. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong, I would at least say that it&#39;s\ndifficult to=\r\n identify the good content and furthermore some of the\nbest content isn&#39;t r=\r\neally written to be accessible to those who\nhaven&#39;t been using REST for qui=\r\nte some time. So getting to the point\nwhere you can actually get value from=\r\n the discussions you guys are\nhaving is pretty difficult.\n\nI&#39;m sure the sam=\r\ne is true for other forums, but I&#39;ve found that in\ngeneral they find a happ=\r\ny balance (often helped by having\nauthoritative detailed resources that beg=\r\ninners can be pointed at).\n\nPersonally I&#39;m sold on many of the ideas of RES=\r\nT and I find the\napproach very interesting, so I want to move on to having =\r\ndiscussions\nof topics like resource/mime type design but I&#39;m not sure this =\r\nforum\nis really setup for that.\n\n- Colin\n\n\n"}}
