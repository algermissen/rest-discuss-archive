The\n&gt; task of an ops engineer is to quickly come up with daily charts\n&gt; showing requests/day for books and CDs, by sifting through access\n&gt; logs. It is easy to implement this when the URIs used for these\n&gt; types of resources have stable patterns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say, you now want to run all CD sales (POST requests) through\n&gt; a bigger box. URI patterns rule again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both these are solvable based on media types, but when I design my\n&gt; application such that some key factors are reflected in URIs (and a\n&gt; few known media types), I get much more mileage out of the HTTP\n&gt; toolstack. If I start folding these into an elaborate media type\n&gt; scheme, I will be fighting with the toolstack to get it to work for\n&gt; me. In the long run, it may even cost more to maintain such a\n&gt; system.\n\nI am a fan of domain specific media types.  However, i have never\nimplemented a system that had just one URL and figured every thing out\nfrom the mime type, which seems like what you are arguing against.\nEvery resource (each CD or book in your example) would have it&#39;s own\nURI so routing and reporting on a per-resource basis is still straight\nforward.\n\nIf the service implementer chooses to implement the service is such a\nway that *it* can infer information about the requests from the URI\nthat is great. (I do it all the time.)  But clients and intermediates\noutside of the service implementer&#39;s control should never be expected\nto understand such implications.\n\n&gt; In other words, media types (along with URIs, content encodings,\n&gt; charset params etc.) keep representation visible to the protocol and\n&gt; the toolstack. But that does not necessarily follow that media types\n&gt; must be used to determine whether an incoming XML document is a book\n&gt; or a CD. There are other (simpler) ways to determine such things.\n\nMedia types don&#39;t just tell you the syntax (XML flavor, etc) of the\nrepresentation, they also indicate the semantics.\n\nEven if a service chooses to have a separate URI for every\nrepresentation media types would still be useful.  An exclusively atom\nclient that makes a request, with &#39;Accept: application/atom+xml&#39;,\nagainst an HTML only blog resource should get redirected to the atom\nrepresentation resource.  (Or perhaps a &#39;406 Not Acceptable&#39; response\nwith a &#39;alternate&#39; link header pointing to the atom representation\nresource.)  Using domain specific media types allows that such\nbehavior, while a generic media type approach precludes it.\n\nUsing both URIs and media types in concert allows clients to\ncontinuously operate on constantly evolving services, and services to\nevolve quite aggressively without breaking existing clients.\n\nPeter\n\n"}}
