For two arbitrary URIs, I don&#39;t believe \n&gt; there&#39;s any way to determine whether they identify the same \n&gt; resource or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, for a specific resource identified by two or more \n&gt; URIs, I would \n&gt; think that it might be possible to determine equivalence of \n&gt; URIs.  The \n&gt; rules for making that determination would, however, only be valid for \n&gt; that specific resource and would probably require detailed \n&gt; knowledge of \n&gt; the resource for which URI equivalence was being tested.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm.  Having said all that, I&#39;m beginning to think the best \n&gt; you may be \n&gt; able to do is to determine non-equivalence.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Chuck\n\nDeterminations may be an individual thing.  For instance, I may\nhave determined that for my own use, Stop & Shop is equivalent to\nShop Rite.  However, other shoppers would not agree, nor would\nthe managements of these two different concerns.\n\nIf you&#39;re talking about some kind of authoritative determination\nof equivalence among URI&#39;s, you have to appeal to the author, just\nas you have to when you want to know the &quot;real meaning&quot; of a work\nof art.  The naming authority picks the meanings and the symbols.\nWhen you interact with a resource, you are playing by the author&#39;s\nrules; period.\n\nSO:\n\nIf you repeatedly GET two URIs and get back identical bit streams,\nthat does not make for authoritative equivalence.\n\nIf you repeatedly GET two URIs and get back utterly different bit\nstreams, nor does that make for authoritative unequivalence.\n\nThe equivalence of two URIs should mean one and only one thing:\nthat they may be used interchangeably with the guarantee that substitution\nof one for the other yields the exact same result as no substitution.\n\nOne should also ponder whether it would ever be wise to have two\nURI that are equivalent by design.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
