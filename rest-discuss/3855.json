Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, the echo/atom API work is in fact what\n&gt; &gt; started me thinking about MoST.  My point is that\n&gt; &gt; we should not need an Atom API and a RSS API and a\n&gt; &gt; Wiki API and a RNA/Notification API and a Foo API.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you are saying that I should be able to have an uber-client that would\n&gt; know how to act with *any* resource merely be examing its schema?\n\nI am saying that if YOU know the schema of the\nresource that should be all you need to have have\na client interacts with it using HTTP.  You\nshouldn&#39;t need an API in addition to the schema.\n\n&gt; &gt; If servers exposed the underlying data model in a\n&gt; &gt; consistent syntactic format, e.g. XML then the\n&gt; &gt; only API you would need is the API for\n&gt; &gt; manipulating that syntactic model.  The meaning of\n&gt; &gt; changes to the model would be defined entirely by\n&gt; &gt; the XML schema.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this mean that the client is then in total control of the resource or\n&gt; does the server still do its own checks to ensure resource integrity?\n\nNo.  It just means that the semantics of\nGET/PUT/POST/DELETE are well defined.  The server\nis resposible for maintaining the integrity of the\ndata model.  Authentication and authorization are\northogonal.\n\n&gt; &gt; So, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to\n&gt; &gt; RSS2 to RNA to ...., the API shouldn&#39;t change.\n&gt; &gt; Its always be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE against XML node\n&gt; &gt; ids and you know that this is the API because the\n&gt; &gt; content-type is text/XML!\n&gt;\n&gt; Whoa!  What does RNA have to do with Pie/RSS?  If that&#39;s what you think RNA\n&gt; is about, you have totally missed the point behind RNA.  Sure, some facets\n&gt; of blog systems (not RSS/Pie) could be implemented with RNA (which is what\n&gt; my http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49 post was hinting at, though not\n&gt; very successfuly).  But, to my knowledge, RNA is not interchangable with\n&gt; *any* other specification I am aware of, regardless of how exposed you make\n&gt; the data model.\n\nMy point is that you should not need anything\nbeyond an XML schema to define the API.  If RNA\ninboxes and addressbooks are enough for your app,\ngreat.  If you need the stuff in echo or RSS thats\nfine too.  Regardless, the documentation of the\nschema should be enough to define the API.\n\n&gt; &gt; My objection to ReST is precisely that:\n&gt; &gt; 1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes\n&gt; &gt; without out-of-band communication\n&gt;\n&gt; True, but there is also no way to use any part of the web without at least\n&gt; an initial amount of out-of-band communication.  And there have been\n&gt; proposals such as Roger Costello&#39;s (et al.) Meta-Location header to help\n&gt; expose information such as this.  It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s a start...\n\nI mean per URI out-of-band data.\n\nWith MoST, given a URI, you can GET a resource and\nknow what the resulting content-type, schema, and\ndata actually mean.  ReST &quot;Representations&quot; mean\nthat the returned content-type, schema, and data\nhave no meaning without out-of-band documentation\ngiving mapping that result back to the state of\nsome hidden model.\n\nWith MoST, given the results of a GET, you know\nhow to manipulate it using POST/PUT/DELETE.  With\nReST you need a whole additional set of\ndocumentation explaining how each of these\noperations affects the state of the hidden model.\n\nThe meta-location header is an admission of the\nfailure of ReST to deliver the\nvisibility/interoperability it promises.\nMeta-location is an admision that you have to\nassociate new interface semantics with each URI,\nand that all ReST gives you is the guarantee that\nthe interface will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE\nas verb *names* and that GET will be idempotent.\nThats pretty weak.\n\n&gt; &gt; 2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent\n&gt; &gt; *meaning* accross URI so API documentation ends up\n&gt; &gt; being extensive.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you mean by no consistent meaning?  Regardless of the application\n&gt; used, I know the meaning of a GET.  I may not know what the results mean,\n&gt; but I certainly know what the request means.  The same is pretty much true\n&gt; for the other methods as well.  Now, I agree that they don&#39;t necessarily\n&gt; have consistent implementation across URIs (e.g. some support only GET while\n&gt; others support GET and PUT), but that&#39;s what an API (or RI or whatever) and\n&gt; the HTTP 405 response is for (plus Allowed header).\n\nWhat does it mean to know the meaning of GET if\nyou don&#39;t know what the results mean?  What does\nit mean to know the meaning of POST if you have no\nidea what you can POST and have no idea of the\neffect of doing so?\n\n&gt; &gt; You have 13 pages of documentation simply to\n&gt; &gt; update an XML document with a well defined schema.\n&gt; &gt; You are clearly a smart person. You should find it\n&gt; &gt; frustrating to be spending your time writing such\n&gt; &gt; a document and your should find it even more\n&gt; &gt; frustrating to think about the number of\n&gt; &gt; programmers who have to spend time reading and\n&gt; &gt; understanding that document for your time\n&gt; &gt; investment to pay-off.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not define a computer-processable schema\n&gt; language for RESTful interfaces?  Then, you\n&gt; could just generate the appropriate wrapper code\n&gt; at the push of a button based on such a schema.\n\nBecause RPC is bad.  See Sec 6.5.2 of Roy&#39;s Thesis:\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nWhat makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources\nusing a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost\nas well as by the machines that originate services. The result is an application that allows\nfor layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the information origin, which\nis very useful for an Internet-scale, multi-organization, anarchically scalable\ninformation system. RPC mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not\nnetwork-based applications.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_2\n\nMy complaint about ReST is that if fails to\ndeliver on the promise of HTTP that Roy so\neloquently articulates here.  Interfaces are no\nlonger generic but are instead URI specific.\n\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t a MoSTful schema basically provide the\n&gt; same thing?\n\nNo.  MoST provides much more.  MoST delivers on\nwhat ReST only promises, &quot;generic interfaces with\nstandard semantics that can be interpreted by\nintermediaries almost as well as&quot; end-points as\nwell as end-points that can that can interact with\na resource with resorting to ANY out of band\ndocumentation about it.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
