It just uses well  \nestablished technologies (HTTP, X509, RDF) in a novel way.\n\nA very simple, early implementation is described here:\n\n\thttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/foaf_ssl_a_first_implementation\n\nEssentially it works by creating client side self signed certificates  \nthat are linked to a web resource, that can return an RDF  \nrepresentation containing info about the public key of the certificate  \n( other representations should be GRDDLable ).\n\n\tThere are huge numbers of ways of using this, and exploring this. It  \nworks with Firefox and Safari out of the box. What other browsers does  \nit work with? Can it help eliminate the need for identifying cookies,  \nand so for javascript security holes dependent on cookies?\n\n\tHenry\n\n\nHome page: http://bblfish.net/\n\n\n"}}
