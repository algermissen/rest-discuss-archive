In essence, it is a bit like defining a base class or a virtual\nclass.  Regarding the hiding of data in OOP, I actually think even that has\nsimilarities, per below.\n\nDan, Jeff, I can definitely see the similarities in the discussion between\nOOP vs. REST and OOP vs. generative communication ala Linda.  However, let\nme try to reframe this discussion.\n\nI&#39;ve always viewed objects in OOP as both data and active agent.  That is\nwhy I really see such commonality between URIs and objects.  URI&#39;s are\nresources, not necessarily data.  Treating all URIs as data is certainly\nuseful, but so is treating them as active agents.\n\nThus, I don&#39;t actually think OOP itself encourages hiding of data per se,\nrather that is an artifact of distributed object systems like CORBA or\nSOAP-RPC.  In OOP systems such as C++, the result of a call returns objects\nwhich are fully addressable.  This is not so in CORBA or SOAP-RPC since the\nresults are not addressable objects, but pure data that fall completely\noutside of the namespace.\n\nHistorically, one of the biggest issues of distributed programming is that\nit is difficult to pass by reference.  Thus, you have to pass the entire\ndata from one addressing space to another (thus RPCs).  If we think of the\nURI naming system as an universal addressing space - we are in essence\ncreating the ability to pass by reference - isn&#39;t that what a link is, after\nall?\n\nIt should be possible to build a full-blown distributed OOP system that is\nbased on the internet URI addressing space.  Issues like object persistence\nand cost of access will need to be resolved, but I don&#39;t think there are\ninsurmountable obstacles.  I believe the resulting system would be not only\nRESTful, but present a more familiar model of programming for developers.\n\n//Joe\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dan Brickley [mailto:danbri@...]\nSent: Monday, May 27, 2002 9:58 PM\nTo: Jeff Bone\nCc: Mark Baker; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST-OO?\n\n\nOn Mon, 27 May 2002, Jeff Bone wrote:\n\n&gt; On 5/26/02 10:17 PM, &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wow, awesome post.  I too agree that the OO nature of REST is quite\n&gt; &gt; interesting.  A REST component basically does all the things you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; expect of an object; has identity, encapsulated behaviour, supports\n&gt; &gt; inheritance through a type system such as RDF.  Generic interfaces\n&gt; &gt; are also a feature of component based OO systems, such as Java Beans.\n&gt; &gt; The only thing REST doesn&#39;t do from an OO POV is hide data.\n&gt;\n&gt; IMO, the problem -w- REST v.
