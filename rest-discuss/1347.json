I too agree that the OO nature of REST is quite\n&gt; &gt; interesting.  A REST component basically does all the things you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; expect of an object; has identity, encapsulated behaviour, supports\n&gt; &gt; inheritance through a type system such as RDF.  Generic interfaces\n&gt; &gt; are also a feature of component based OO systems, such as Java Beans.\n&gt; &gt; The only thing REST doesn&#39;t do from an OO POV is hide data.\n&gt;\n&gt; IMO, the problem -w- REST v. OOP is identical to the problem which has long\n&gt; plagued me [1] -w- OOP v. generative communication ala Linda.  This is not\n&gt; to say that REST and generative communication are identical or directly\n&gt; analogous, but IMO they bear many interesting similarities...\n\nYes, I came to this view too... various links hoarded in...\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2000Mar/0055.html\n\nBTW I ran into an old WWW4 paper on WWW Meets Linda that was quite\ninteresting, http://www.w3.org/Conferences/WWW4/Papers/174/ and based\naround actual implementation (a Perl Linda).\n\nDan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Jb\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]\n&gt; http://groups.google.com/groups?q=linda+oop+jguy&hl=en&lr=&selm=1220%40jethr\n&gt; o.Corp.Sun.COM&rnum=1\n\n\n"}}
