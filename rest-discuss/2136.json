See the latest Servlet spec, or pick up\nJason Hunter&#39;s O&#39;Reilly book on the subject.\n\nYour application still needs to *authorize* users after they&#39;ve been HTTP\nauthenticated.  And your application needs to apply whatever filters to the\ncontent to &quot;authorize&quot; that as well.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nWalden Mathews\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seth Ladd [mailto:seth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 21, 2002 10:06 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Security in a REST world?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; We are developing a REST system using straight HTTP and RDF.  \n&gt; We have n \n&gt; clients (both machine and humans) GETting and PUTting RDF into the \n&gt; system via HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; The question is, are there any security frameworks for a HTTP world \n&gt; where the URI is opaque?  By that I mean, if the URI is virtual and \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have enough information in it to answer authorization \n&gt; questions, \n&gt; how would I go about securing my application?\n&gt; \n&gt; Since that is, obviously, a huge question, I&#39;ll try to add some \n&gt; requirements.  Hopefully they are REST generic, as we are \n&gt; trying to stay \n&gt; within HTTP and REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; The interface into the system is HTTP, so our methods are \n&gt; PUT, GET, and \n&gt; DELETE.  We then have users, and the objects they are PUT, GET, and \n&gt; DELETE.  Using Apache as an example, I can control who can \n&gt; access what \n&gt; URIs via GET.  That&#39;s fine if GET was the only method /and/ \n&gt; if the URIs \n&gt; are physical.  In our case, we can PUT and DELETE, plus the \n&gt; URIs point \n&gt; to virtual resources (constructed from data in a database).\n&gt; \n&gt; We need to construct policies that have:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Actor\n&gt; - Method\n&gt; - URI\n&gt; - Content Filter\n&gt; \n&gt; Where:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Actor is the person (or machine) performing the HTTP call\n&gt; - Method is GET, PUT, or DELETE\n&gt; - URI is the (regexp?) pattern of the URI\n&gt; - Content Filter is a collection of filters that can validate the \n&gt; content (body) of the HTTP call.  For instance, we need to \n&gt; allow Frank \n&gt; to PUT to /service/stuff/* ONLY documents that pass validations (like \n&gt; validate on an XML Schema or DAML+OIL schema)\n&gt; \n&gt; What we&#39;ve found is that simple Actor+Method+URI policies \n&gt; aren&#39;t enough. \n&gt;   We need to validate the incoming body of the HTTP request as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, are there frameworks out there that do this sort of \n&gt; thing?  I looked \n&gt; at Apache and it doesn&#39;t seem to offer this type of control.  Our \n&gt; application is written in Java and Servlets, and the servlet \n&gt; environment \n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have those types of controls, either.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any experience with this type of security system would be greatly \n&gt; appreciated!  I&#39;ll post a summary of useful information.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; Seth\n&gt; \n\n"}}
