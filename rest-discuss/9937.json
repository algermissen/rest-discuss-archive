Each product has a URI  \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; uniquely identifies it. But each URI has a zillion representations\n&gt;&gt; based on who is asking for the resource. Each user sees the same\n&gt;&gt; product information except that it has recommendations and other  \n&gt;&gt; links\n&gt;&gt; specific to the user. When I bookmark the page to del.ico.us, or  \n&gt;&gt; email\n&gt;&gt; it to another user, the URI still resolves to the same product, but\n&gt;&gt; with a personalized representation. To me, this is completely RESTful\n&gt;&gt; and does not require user-specific URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; OTOH, it really hampers cacheability.  This can be mitigated with ajax\n&gt; (heavily cache the common stuff, serve all the personalized stuff via\n&gt; xhr and then you can cache each of those as a separate resource too).\n&gt; If you want personalization for non-javascript clients, make sure you\n&gt; set appropriate etags.\n&gt;\n\nDoes it? Personalization is an important aspect of the web today, and  \ncompanies have been building personalized sites successfully within  \nthe purview of HTTP. Downloading personalized data over XHR does  \nimprove cacheability of the rest of the page, but then again, the  \npersonalized data is not &quot;public&quot; cacheable.\n\nSubbu \n\n"}}
