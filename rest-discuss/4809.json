And by resource, I\nstrictly mean the set of URIs used (and where &#39;URI&#39; is defined to include\nthe query terms), not the fuzzy concepts behind the URIs.\n\nThis difference is a temporary state of affairs, until Web browsers grow up.\nBut other user-agents don&#39;t have this problem. For example media players can\nuse the full REST approach for things such as editing playlists, doing\ndecent caching, etc. without worrying about HTML pages and a user&#39;s\npage-by-page workflow. It&#39;s the Web v2.0\n\n&gt; An alternative would be to include a link with a query string parameter\n&gt; like &quot;?mode=edit&quot; but that doesn&#39;t strike me as being very REST-ful,\neither.\nThis is mostly RESTful. Just don&#39;t mistake &#39;mode&#39; to mean &#39;method&#39;. You\nmight want to use &#39;mode=author&#39; and &#39;mode=reader&#39; or some noun-based word.\n\n"}}
