Now, when someone clicks one of the results, I&#39;d like to put into the page &#39;next&#39; and &#39;prev&#39; links (similar to what you have in bugzilla for example).\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, one (bad) way of doing this, is keeping a state in the server that says the user is doing a search, and render the page with the links according to that state. This is bad because the user my get to the page in other ways (bookmarks, search something else and go back etc.), which will mean the &#39;back&#39; and &#39;prev&#39; links may be corrupted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another way is to make the links to the search results contain the fact that they originated from a search, with all search query data (maybe encoded in some way, e.g., serialized). \n\nYes. The latter is the correct way, at least if you want this system to\nscale. There&#39;s no need to encode the query data (aprt from URL\nencoding), just specify it as query parameters.\n\n&gt; This means two things: (a) the url to the resource contains data outside of the scope of the resource, (b) the returned representation contains information that is not part of the resource.\n\nNot really, no. When you say &quot;resource&quot;, you seem to be implying that\nthere is a one-to-one mapping between resources and results. However,\nwithin this system you&#39;re designing a resource also contains information\nabout the context it was located in, so it&#39;s not the same as a result.\nThe resource is simply the thing that is pointed to by the URL,\nincluding all this query context data.\n\n&gt; Is it OK to say that the search result contains urls which are not the resources themselves, but &quot;meta resources&quot; that wrap the real resource and add information?:\n\nNot quite, see above. The search result will return both context data\nand results. These can be combined to form URLs that reference resources\nthat combine both the context data and the result.\n\n&gt; also, when returning HTML, &#39;prev&#39; and &#39;next&#39; are embedded in the resource representation (somewhere between giving its name and other information). is it OK?\n\nYes.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
