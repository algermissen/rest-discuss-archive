Believe or not, I don&#39;t care abo=\r\nut your inflated ego, but I do\ncare about some useful answers that you and =\r\nothers on this list most\nof the provide. The reason I ask the questions I a=\r\nsk is because if I\nwant to implement something I have to justify to my boss=\r\nes why I want\nto do it. And I can&#39;t just say &quot;because someone told me &#39;just=\r\n do it&#39;&quot;\nor &quot;because that&#39;s how the web works&quot;... I have to prove they are\n=\r\nworth money and/or time even if in the future.I think in the real\nworld thi=\r\ns is understandable, as money and time are scarce resources.\n\nAbout all the=\r\n fuss you&#39;ve made about my example of cookies, I wasn&#39;t\ntalking about cooki=\r\nes &quot;per se&quot; but only as a example that your\nargument of &quot;that&#39;s because how=\r\n web works&quot; isn&#39;t a argument at all, or\nbetter, it&#39;s a argument for those w=\r\nho have no clear arguments...\n\nFinally, I&#39;m learning REST ok, with or witho=\r\nut your answers, and again\nI don&#39;t care about your inflated ego that makes =\r\nyou see yourself as a\n&quot;professor&quot; that is so kind that is willing to share =\r\n12 years of\nexperience (!) with us the poor ignorant guys... I can say the =\r\nsame\nthing, if you don&#39;t want to answer my questions without that tone of\np=\r\naternalism and arrogance, please don&#39;t. It&#39;s you that are wasting my\ntime a=\r\nnd patience.\n\nNow for the technical questions that should be what we should=\r\n talk\nabout, the rest of this thread shows clearly that I&#39;m not the only on=\r\ne\nwho doesn&#39;t follow your expertise so clearly as you think it is. And\nther=\r\ne was no evidence whatsoever that a variant should be a\nidentifiable resour=\r\nce on it&#39;s own for cases other than cache (or the\nserver-side developer dec=\r\nides to do so for business reasons). So I&#39;m\ngoing to look for answers elsew=\r\nhere, because &quot;it&#39;s just the way it is&quot;\nor &quot;because that&#39;s how the web work=\r\ns&quot;, even if they are true\nstatements, can&#39;t serve as justification to imple=\r\nment something.\n\nAnd please, I also think there&#39;s no point in continuing to=\r\n read your\nconfusing opinions, so I&#39;m also done here... Maybe when you come=\r\n down\nfrom your high horse I can learn some things more from your answers,\n=\r\nas actually had happened before.\n\n\n2010/6/12 Eric J.

Just\n&gt;&gt; some more notes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It pushes my buttons whe=\r\nn your reply comes so fast that it took you\n&gt; more time to write it, than y=\r\nou spent reading my reply. =A0I am trying to\n&gt; impart of the wisdom I&#39;ve ac=\r\ncumulated through a dozen years of\n&gt; experience with conneg and REST (back =\r\nthen REST was called HTTP Request\n&gt; Object). =A0I am not trying to trick yo=\r\nu into doing something that isn&#39;t\n&gt; in your best interests, I&#39;m pointing ou=\r\nt a best practice that is in\n&gt; your best interests, because it&#39;s also a RES=\r\nT constraint.\n&gt;\n&gt; How difficult is it to understand that there is one excep=\r\ntion to the\n&gt; SHOULD, and that&#39;s compression? =A0You can keep asking me abo=\r\nut every\n&gt; possible exception out there, but it won&#39;t change my answer -- i=\r\nt will\n&gt; only annoy the crap out of me. =A0If these possible exceptions are=\r\nn&#39;t\n&gt; compression, my answer remains &quot;no.&quot; =A0Seriously, how much more conc=\r\nisely\n&gt; and unequivocally can I state my position?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So, assig=\r\nning URIs to variants doesn&#39;t apply to the general case,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but it does a=\r\npply to all other cases.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I still don&#39;t see any other use cases e=\r\nxcept the client being able to\n&gt;&gt; dereference a specific variant or for use=\r\n with cache. Both of wich\n&gt;&gt; are not that important inside a intranet.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; If the intranet context (or anything else) was a valid exception to the\n=\r\n&gt; SHOULD, then I wouldn&#39;t be saying until I&#39;m blue in the face that the\n&gt; o=\r\nnly valid exception to the SHOULD is compression.\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides, this is not =\r\nintranet-discuss, this is rest-discuss. =A0I refuse\n&gt; to tailor my answers =\r\nto the specific needs of those whose systems do\n&gt; not need REST&#39;s primary b=\r\nenefit of anarchic scalability over the real-\n&gt; world Web. =A0That intranet=\r\ns have nowhere near the scaling requirements\n&gt; of Web systems, is simply no=\r\nt relevant to any discussion of REST, nor\n&gt; is it a reason not to implement=\r\n REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I&#39;ve learned from doing this for a dozen years, is that you=\r\nr life\n&gt; gets infinitely easier when dealing with conneg, if variants are\n&gt;=\r\n assigned their own URIs. =A0If for no other reason than to be able to\n&gt; te=\r\nst and maintain the system properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why develop any architecture, part=\r\nicularly a REST architecture, to be\n&gt; incompatible with caching just becaus=\r\ne it isn&#39;t an immediate need?\n&gt; Have you not been paying attention to anyth=\r\ning I write about how REST\n&gt; is a goal for the long-term evolution of a sys=\r\ntem rather than a solution\n&gt; for its immediate needs?\n&gt;\n&gt; If it turns out a=\r\nfter you&#39;ve deployed an intranet system, that caching\n&gt; indeed would be nic=\r\ne, wouldn&#39;t it make a lot more sense to have followed\n&gt; the Identification =\r\nof Resources constraint in the first place, such\n&gt; that you can just drop s=\r\nquid in where and as needed, instead of\n&gt; requiring a fully-coupled caching=\r\n solution like cache channels?\n&gt;\n&gt; Following REST from the get-go prevents =\r\nyou from painting yourself into\n&gt; the corner like that. =A0One benefit of t=\r\nhe Identification of Resources\n&gt; constraint is caching. =A0That does not me=\r\nan that because you don&#39;t care\n&gt; about caching today, you can just ignore t=\r\nhat constraint. =A0OTOH, by\n&gt; applying that constraint, your system can evo=\r\nlve in a scalable fashion\n&gt; over the long term. =A0Why bend over backwards =\r\nto avoid that, for the\n&gt; sake of not minting some URIs? =A0Your position ma=\r\nkes no sense to me.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; URIs are opaque. =A0I don&#39;t know how you=\r\n can tell from just &quot;/A&quot; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it must be a static page? =A0The answer =\r\nis that it makes no difference\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whatsoever to anything I&#39;ve said, wheth=\r\ner either of those resources\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or any other resources I may have tossed =\r\nout as examples, are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; static or dynamic. =A0To a REST connector it&#39;s ju=\r\nst a bunch of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; response bytes, as implementation details are opaque beh=\r\nind the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; uniform interface.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know URIs are opaque, I was ju=\r\nst pointing to your examples. But my\n&gt;&gt; point is preciselly that one. If &quot;i=\r\nt&#39;s just a bunch of response\n&gt;&gt; bytes&quot;, how can a non-static resource be ca=\r\nched if each time it is\n&gt;&gt; dereferenced it will probably have a diferent bu=\r\nnch of bytes?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Look at the demo I posted. =A0The URIs you dereference=\r\n are just stubs\n&gt; whose content (metadata) rarely changes. =A0All steady-st=\r\nates are rendered\n&gt; using client-side XSLT to include other resources. =A0T=\r\nhose other\n&gt; resources have different cache optimizations according to thei=\r\nr\n&gt; nature. =A0The caching of the initial representation is not coupled to\n=\r\n&gt; the caching of any resource making up the steady-state. =A0It just calls\n=\r\n&gt; an XSLT transformation.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is no different than any HTML page which=\r\n calls an external CSS\n&gt; file. =A0Updating the CSS has absolutely no effect=\r\n on the freshness of\n&gt; any representation linking to the CSS. =A0When my sy=\r\nstem is fleshed out,\n&gt; it will implement XHR to update the number of replie=\r\ns in a thread,\n&gt; wherever that information is needed. =A0That way, those pa=\r\nges dynamically\n&gt; update, without affecting the caching of the representati=\r\non which calls\n&gt; that XHR.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are scraping the bottom of the barrel no=\r\nw, looking for edge cases\n&gt; and exceptions. =A0Why? =A0The answer remains a=\r\nssign URIs to variants, and\n&gt; architect your way around these issues you br=\r\ning up, such that they\n&gt; don&#39;t matter. =A0Nothing you mention is a showstop=\r\nper, I doubt you will\n&gt; ever come up with anything that is or which shows b=\r\nest practice to be\n&gt; inherently flawed, nor will you convince me that the I=\r\ndentification of\n&gt; Resources constraint may be safely ignored in the intran=\r\net context...\n&gt;\n&gt; Just as you will not prove to me that glass is a solid. =\r\n=A0You need to\n&gt; learn why this is the way it is, instead of desperately se=\r\neking cases\n&gt; you think might disprove this, and confusing the rest of the =\r\nclass\n&gt; while bugging your professor, who has already been incredibly patie=\r\nnt\n&gt; in pointing out time and again that the *only* exception here is\n&gt; com=\r\npression. =A0Especially since just minting the damn URIs is so simple\n&gt; and=\r\n has no downside.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For instance /currentime is allways diferent and =\r\nso is not cacheable,\n&gt;&gt; rigth? What&#39;s the importance then of having a fixed=\r\n URI to variants\n&gt;&gt; of this resource (if you also consider that we should n=\r\never allow the\n&gt;&gt; client to call specific variants)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If /currentime =\r\nis a negotiated resource, then assigning URIs to its\n&gt; variants, aside from=\r\n following the spec and applying the Identification\n&gt; of Resources constrai=\r\nnt, makes it one heckuva lot easier to curl the\n&gt; variants for testing, ind=\r\nependent of the conneg mechanism. =A0I can&#39;t\n&gt; imagine how much harder you&#39;=\r\nre making it to develop and maintain a\n&gt; system by only being able to acces=\r\ns variants by using curl with Accept\n&gt; headers.\n&gt;\n&gt; This was the first thin=\r\ng I figured out a dozen years ago, when I\n&gt; started using conneg, and it&#39;s =\r\nheld true ever since -- trying to\n&gt; develop a conneg system without assigni=\r\nng URIs to variants is a\n&gt; thousand times more difficult than just minting =\r\nthe damn URIs. =A0So\n&gt; please, just follow the spec and apply the REST cons=\r\ntraint. =A0It&#39;s so\n&gt; much easier than flogging a horse that&#39;s been dead sin=\r\nce the last\n&gt; millenium, when this debate was SETTLED.\n&gt;\n&gt; Find all the edg=\r\ne cases you want, where you wouldn&#39;t want to cache or\n&gt; directly dereferenc=\r\ne variants. =A0How does this override the SHOULD or\n&gt; the Identification of=\r\n Resources constraint? =A0As I&#39;ve said a million\n&gt; times now, the exception=\r\n to assigning URIs to variants is compression,\n&gt; not your desire to avoid a=\r\npplying a REST constraint or following RFC\n&gt; 2616, for reasons which still =\r\nelude me entirely -- there&#39;s no downside\n&gt; to assigning URIs to variants, s=\r\no why are you looking so hard for\n&gt; exceptions to this best practice? =A0I =\r\nalready told you _the_ exception:\n&gt; compression.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And als=\r\no in that example, suppose the client references\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the /A.html as a re=\r\npresentation of /A, then that manipulation\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of /A.html has to be made=\r\n thru a representation of /A.html, does\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it make sense to also assign=\r\n URI&#39;s to the representation of that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; representation of /A? I suppose=\r\n it depends on the &quot;importance&quot; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; those representations?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Your terminology is, errr, not so good, so the only chance I have of=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; answering that question is to rewrite it first:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, my en=\r\nglish is far from good...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your grasp of REST terminology is a separa=\r\nte issue from your grasp of\n&gt; English. =A0I could care less about your gras=\r\np of English.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;If the user agent dereferences /A and the res=\r\nponse is the /A.html\n&gt;&gt; &gt; variant, then that manipulation of /A.html...&quot;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What manipulation of /A.html? =A0The user agent is dereferencing /A=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The response is a variant with a Content-Location of /A.html, not a\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Location of /A.html. =A0There&#39;s only one request-response here, the\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; user agent knows nothing of /A.html because the user agent hasn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\nereferenced /A.html.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OK, I see, the dereferencing of /A.html is =\r\nmade by the server itself,\n&gt;&gt; not the user agent, so the user agent never &quot;=\r\nsees&quot; it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The server isn&#39;t dereferencing anything. =A0Perhaps /A.htm=\r\nl is an actual\n&gt; file on the filesystem of the origin server, perhaps not, =\r\nit does not\n&gt; matter. =A0The server is responding to a request for /A with =\r\nwhatever\n&gt; response code, headers and entity the system&#39;s coding tells it t=\r\no. =A0One\n&gt; of those headers contains a URI which other components may use =\r\nin order\n&gt; to distinguish between variants -- it&#39;s just a label.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;If the user agent dereferences /A and the response is the /A.html\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; variant, then that manipulation of /A.html has to be made by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; transfe=\r\nrring a representation of /A.html...&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t follow. =A0URIs are=\r\n opaque, you are deducing an awful lot from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some hypothetical example =\r\nnot-really-even-URIs. =A0The user agent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dereferences /A and retrieves =\r\ninstructions on how to render a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; steady- state, which presents the user=\r\n with options for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; transitioning to other application steady-states.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, by &quot;manipulation&quot; I was only thinking of GETting it, not to\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; change it. I was pointing only that if the variant of /A that we\n&gt;&gt; assi=\r\ngned a URI of /A.html is a resource on ot&#39;s own that implies that\n&gt;&gt; there =\r\nis also (at least one) =A0representation of /A.html that we could\n&gt;&gt; wish o=\r\nr not to assign it&#39;s how URI, like /A.html.en, =A0/A.html.pt...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No! =\r\n=A0Absolutely not! =A0The appearance of a URI in a Content-Location\n&gt; heade=\r\nr is just a label. =A0It implies nothing, you can make no assertions\n&gt; base=\r\nd on its presence, it doesn&#39;t even imply that you can dereference\n&gt; /A.html=\r\n let alone say anything about the number of representations of\n&gt; /A.html, a=\r\nnd it certainly doesn&#39;t imply some additional negotiation\n&gt; layer -- which,=\r\n if you were using transparent conneg, is actually a 506\n&gt; Variant Also Neg=\r\notiates error as per RFC 2295.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there were different languages to neg=\r\notiate, and each language\n&gt; varies in possible media types, then the system=\r\n would compute the\n&gt; language, then the media type, then send a response to=\r\n &#39;GET /A&#39; with the\n&gt; appropriate headers including Content-Location, whose =\r\nURI says nothing\n&gt; about anything since it&#39;s just labelling a variant for t=\r\nhe purpose of\n&gt; distinguishing it from other variants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stop making this=\r\n impossible for yourself to ever comprehend. =A0If you\n&gt; have a resource /A=\r\n which varies by media type and language, then you\n&gt; have a set of variants=\r\n to which you can assign URIs. =A0You don&#39;t take\n&gt; the variants of each lan=\r\nguage and make them negotiable URIs based on\n&gt; media type, that leads the u=\r\nser agent around in a circle. =A0Just give a\n&gt; different URI to each varian=\r\nt -- pretend those URIs are random\n&gt; gobbledygook with no apparent relation=\r\n to one another (i.e. opaque).\n&gt; They&#39;re just labels, not a Location where =\r\nthe user agent needs to\n&gt; conduct further content negotiation.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Does it make sense to also assign URI&#39;s to the variants of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; var=\r\niants of /A?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; None whatsoever. =A0Why would /A.html have any vari=\r\nants, except for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; compression? =A0The entire purpose of assigning URIs =\r\nto variants is to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; access them as resources in their own right, tied to=\r\n a specific\n&gt;&gt; &gt; media type (which may or may not be expressed as a filenam=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extension), or language, etc. =A0So the only conneg left to do is\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; compression, if /A.html is dereferenced, which of course is not a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; g=\r\niven that it will be.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about diferent languages fo=\r\nr the same resource/variant\n&gt;&gt; as my previous example.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The answer do=\r\nes not change based on the number of different headers\n&gt; you&#39;re considering=\r\n for the negotiation. =A0Resource /A has a set of\n&gt; variants, it doesn&#39;t ma=\r\ntter whether they&#39;re by media type, language, or\n&gt; both media type and lang=\r\nuage, or compressed, or not compressed, the\n&gt; result is a set of variants f=\r\nor /A which need URIs assigned to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; What you&#39;re saying, is that you=\r\n were thinking that the user agent would\n&gt; dereference the Content-Location=\r\n URI to conduct further negotiation.\n&gt; No! =A0This would never happen, beca=\r\nuse Content-Location is not an\n&gt; instruction to dereference anything. =A0Th=\r\nat&#39;s what Location does. =A0So\n&gt; if /A.html were negotiable, how would the =\r\nuser agent ever know about\n&gt; it? =A0The negotiated resource is /A , because=\r\n I said that my example /A\n&gt; is a negotiated resource. =A0How you can assum=\r\ne that means more\n&gt; negotiation would occur at /A.html because it&#39;s in Cont=\r\nent-Location,\n&gt; when Content-Location is just a label containing an opaque =\r\nURI, escapes\n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re making this a million times more difficult th=\r\nan it would be if\n&gt; you could just accept for a fact, that it&#39;s best practi=\r\nce to assign\n&gt; URIs to your variants... =A0Trying to escape that reality is=\r\n leading you\n&gt; into some incredibly convoluted hypotheticals, whose rebutta=\r\nls are only\n&gt; making yourself and others more confused. =A0Why can&#39;t you ju=\r\nst assign\n&gt; URIs to your variants, and learn from the experience why it&#39;s d=\r\nesirable?\n&gt;\n&gt; Surely that would be more productive than convoluted theoreti=\r\ncal debate\n&gt; seeking for exceptions using edge-case examples, which will on=\r\nly serve\n&gt; to ensure that you never learn REST?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nev=\r\nertheless I think to call this &quot;best practice&quot; induces in error\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (it =\r\ndid with me) because it&#39;s only applicable to restricted use\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; case. sc=\r\nenarios.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No, it applies to every use case except compressi=\r\non, as per the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; SHOULD in RFC 2616. =A0Ignoring said SHOULD is a deviat=\r\nion from best\n&gt;&gt; &gt; practice.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m saying can&#39;t be put any mor=\r\ne simply than &quot;assign URIs to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your variants, except for compression.&quot; =\r\n=A0That&#39;s best practice for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the theoretical reason that it&#39;s what RFC =\r\n2616 says to do, and for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the pragmatic reason that the real-world Web =\r\ndepends on your doing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this because that&#39;s how the Web actually works i=\r\nn reality. =A0Don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fight it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, that argument of =A0&quot;th=\r\nat&#39;s how the Web actually works&quot; goes as\n&gt;&gt; far as it goes. The web actuall=\r\ny works with cookies too, that are\n&gt;&gt; consensually not RESTfull...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nigh.\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy&#39;s thesis clearly explains that cookies are a REST mismatch, as=\r\n most\n&gt; commonly used (although there are uses of cookies which don&#39;t amoun=\r\nt to\n&gt; storing application state, which aren&#39;t REST mismatches). =A0Are you=\r\n\n&gt; seriously trying to rebut the explanation of a constraint, by comparing\n=\r\n&gt; that constraint to a known REST mismatch?\n&gt;\n&gt; Given the congruent develop=\r\nment of REST and the Web, the way conneg\n&gt; works on the real-world Web is b=\r\noth the basis for, and the expression\n&gt; of, the Identification of Resources=\r\n constraint. =A0This is a constraint,\n&gt; not a mismatch. =A0Resorting to bri=\r\nnging up cookies is something I can&#39;t\n&gt; take seriously.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have done eve=\r\nrything I can in this thread to explain that the SHOULD\n&gt; requirement for a=\r\nssigning URIs to variants works on the real-world Web,\n&gt; because that aspec=\r\nt of the real-world Web is behaving according to the\n&gt; constraints of REST.=\r\n =A0Your response to that is that cookies are a REST\n&gt; mismatch?\n&gt;\n&gt; What d=\r\noes that even mean, except that there&#39;s really no point in\n&gt; furthering thi=\r\ns discussion with you, because you&#39;ll apparently stop at\n&gt; nothing, no matt=\r\ner how patently absurd, in an effort to dispute what\n&gt; I&#39;m saying? =A0I&#39;m d=\r\none here, as there&#39;s obviously no point in continuing.\n&gt; Come back when you=\r\n&#39;ve decided that you want to learn REST instead of\n&gt; wasting my time.\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\nEric\n&gt;\n\n"}}
