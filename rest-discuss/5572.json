In this case I have specified a height or 30000 feet.\n\nIt occurs to me that the path part works particularly well for\nanything that&#39;s worth naming individually. While every point in\nspace could be considered a meaningful resource, not every point\nis really worth naming. Also notice that we&#39;re starting to deal\nwith *approximate* values here. The most useful thing to do when\ngiven a pair of approximate coordinates might be to produce a list\nof things worth naming approximately at or near those coordinates.\nIn this case, putting the coordinates in the query string makes\nperfect sense, with the response then actually naming interesting\nsites such as...\n\n== User-Agent ==\nGET http://.../universe/milkyway/sol/earth/?lat=90.0&long=12.0\n== Server ==\n200\n\nhttp://.../universe/milkyway/sol/earth/whitehouse (1000 miles)\nhttp://.../universe/milkyway/sol/earth/kremlin (10000 miles)\nhttp://.../universe/milkyway/sol/earth/tajmahal (15000 miles)\n== end ==\n\nBut of course if the application really wants to name every point\nin space, any of the above syntaxes is fine.\n\n(I waffle about the trailing slash; it&#39;s really just an aesthetic\nthing, but it gives some suggestion of a resource being a\ncollection, and it does make relative URIs more convenient.)\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
