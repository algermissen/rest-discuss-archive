This gets \n&gt; arbitrarily complex.  REST doesn&#39;t look like it was made to do a full mapping \n&gt; of URL&#39;s to SQL.\n\nI&#39;m affraid my answer is typically confucian: as far as it needs to go.\n\nREST is an application architectural style. You need to do what is\nright for the application. Don&#39;t try and make a perfect SQL to\nresources mapping just because it would be a perfect mapping. Instead,\nlook at what the applications need are and then design the\nimplementation with REST.\n\n\nQ: How many roads must a man walk down?\nA: 42\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
