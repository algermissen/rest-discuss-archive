Where do you draw the line between \ngeneric and specifi=\r\nc such that your type is not meaningless but nor \nis is it so specific as t=\r\no limit re-use?\n\nAnd on a related note what strategies have people employed=\r\n when \ndefining data formats to make them extensible? Judicious use of &#39;any=\r\n&#39; \nand &#39;choice&#39; elements in XSDs lead to a horrible mess (IMHO). Are \npeopl=\r\ne generally using Relax NG and Schematron to define data \nstructures? Of co=\r\nurse this assumes that people are using XML ...\n\nI&#39;d be extremely intereste=\r\nd to hear any and all opinions on the \nsubject(s).\n\nCheers,\nPhil\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
