That means that a single malicious client -&gt; Amazon \nrequest could result in multiple Amazon -&gt; victim requests. IOW Amazon \nexecuting the stylesheet could act as an amplifier (cp. smurf/fraggle). \nNot to mention the fact that Amazon has a much fatter pipe than your \naverage script kiddie.\n\n&gt; You could have done the same with Babelfish. I&#39;m not going to bug\n&gt; Amazon about this issue until I understand the danger myself.\n&gt; Babelfish has been doing GETs-on-my-behalf for several years.\n\nI don&#39;t think you can persuade Babelfish to do multiple GETs on your \nbehalf with just one GET of your own. If there&#39;s no amplification \nthere&#39;s much less danger.\n\n&gt; I can see how the feature could be very useful for combinign multiple\n&gt; information sources.\n\nOf course it&#39;s useful. But it&#39;s a sharp tool: use with care.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
