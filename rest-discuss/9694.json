In fact it seems that your research has been surprisingly limited -\nthe vast majority of RDF/semweb usage is in a RESTful context. I and\nmany other semweb folk tend not to use the term &quot;web services&quot; for REST\nsystems which could perhaps explain your perception if you searched for\nsemantic web services or something similar. \n\nIan\n\n"}}
