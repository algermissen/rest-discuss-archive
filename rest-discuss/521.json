What are you trying to\naccomplish?\n\n&gt; &gt; Re content negotiation, do you mean:\n&gt; &gt; Content-type: multipart/alternative\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t know what you mean. Can IMAP do content-negotiation so that I can\n&gt; ask for a particular message in different content-types depending on the\n&gt; client?\n\nThat is the purpose of multipart/alternative.  See\nRFC2046 sec. 5.1.4:\n\n  Systems should recognize that the content of the\n  various parts are interchangeable. Systems\n  should choose the &quot;best&quot; type based on the local\n  environment and references, in some cases even\n  through user interaction\n\n&gt; Anyhow, what makes IMAP particularly weak compared to HTTP is that it\n&gt; isn&#39;t designed to allow the server to do arbitrary computation in the\n&gt; generation of responses. It accepts data and moves data but it can&#39;t\n&gt; generate it without warping the protocol.\n\nI don&#39;t think so.  Pick an application that works\nbetter for HTTP than IMAP.  Its just that most\nimplementations are designed for actual mailboxes.\n\nNothing prevents a server from virtualizing\n&quot;mailboxes&quot;\n\nArguably IMAP is nicer in that it more clearly\ndifferentiates between update and query!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ODBC/SQL is also nice from the perspective you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give.  The problem is that it does not specify a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way of passing the types of objects!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also not very well geared for large scale, loosely coupled computing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why?\n&gt;\n&gt; Exposing your relational database schema to the world is not good\n&gt; encapsulation!\n\nNothing stops you from exposing a view of your\nschema rather than your underlying schema.  If you\ndo end up exposing your schema, you can always\nexpose a view later when you change it.\n\nSince there is a pretty direct mapping between\nresources and objects in table, I am not really\nsure what you are arguing here.\n\n&gt; &gt; I think it is the main benefit of the protocol and\n&gt; &gt; the big problem with most RPC protocols.  They\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t provide a standard way of representing\n&gt; &gt; all types.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ll have to agree to disagree. The list of MIME types are part of the\n&gt; Internet. Any protocol can easily adopt the relevant ones.\n\nBut they don&#39;t.  In particular, XML-RPC does not\nuse MIME content types.  Niether does RMI or\nCorba.  SOAP sort-of uses them in the SOAP with\nattachments spec, but it is really an\nafterthought.\n\nThe reason why HTTP and SMTP have been so\nsuccesful in letting people talk to one another is\nMIME.  No non-MIME transport protocol has been\nparticularly successful.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
