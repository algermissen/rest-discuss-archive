I really must not be grasping what you are saying about REST vs\n&gt; MoST. It seems to me that MoST is just an additional layer above ReST, but\n&gt; you appearently believe the two architectures are dissimilar.\n\nBased on other emails in the thread, I suspect Alex would agree\nthat MoST is a further constraining of REST. Alex&#39;s arguments\nabout MoST being different from REST seem to be comparing MoST\nconstraints to the absence of constraints in REST, not to\nexpressed constraints in REST.\n\n&gt; When you get\n&gt; a working model of this MoST approach up, I would certainly like to see\n&gt; more.\n\nI think the main impetus for MoST is the desire to have a more\nconstrained model for representations than just &quot;a representation\nof a resource at time t&quot;. The web-calculus uses a more narrowly\ndefined model and defines its generic interface in terms of this\nmodel. I suspect the web-calculus satisfies the desires expressed\nin this thread about MoST.\n\nAlex, have you studied the web-calculus to see if it provides the\nfunctionality you are looking for?\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
