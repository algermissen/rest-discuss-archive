Basically, IE is not a RESTful client. \n\nFirstly, the most popular modern browsers allow for the full use of all \nHTTP methods in AJAX (a few bugs aside).\n\nSecondly, I don&#39;t think being restricted to GET and POST means a client \nisn&#39;t RESTful, it&#39;s just restricted in terms of what RESTful features it \ncan use. In certain cases this is appropriate (it makes sense for some \nclients to be deliberately restricted to GET only - if they are meant to \nonly have a read-only view on the resources in question). As such I&#39;d \nsay that GET and POST can be enough for a fully RESTful application, but \nnot enough for all fully RESTful applications.\n\n&gt; Having said that, lets assume that my first suggestion is wrong and that you be RESTful on \n&gt; a human facing website. Or application does online banking. All transactions take multiple \n&gt; steps (at a minimum, there is the form, a confirmation and a reciept, although some \n&gt; transaction like a repeating transfer into some external account have multiple form steps). \n&gt; Our architect says that the RESTful approach is to have a unique URL for every step of the \n&gt; transaction, that doing so correctly encodes all the States as resources. I argue that this is \n&gt; not the case for a few reasons:\n[snip]\nI think you are both potentially describing RESTful applications, and \npotentially not (if other matters not stated break the constraints). \nWhich of you is describing the better RESTful application is another matter.\n\nIn terms of both your questions here I get the sense that you are saying \n&quot;there is a RESTful way of doing things&quot;. It&#39;s more accurate to say \n&quot;some ways of doing things are RESTful, because they don&#39;t break the \nconstraints of REST&quot;.\n\nIn particular, something being RESTful doesn&#39;t mean it takes full \nadvantage of what REST offers, but rather it doesn&#39;t try to take \nadvantage of something REST doesn&#39;t offer.\n\nMore importantly, as big a fan of REST as I am, something being RESTful \ndoesn&#39;t automatically mean it doesn&#39;t suck. The not-sucking constraint \nis both more important than any constraint in REST and often harder to \nmeet :)\n\n\n"}}
