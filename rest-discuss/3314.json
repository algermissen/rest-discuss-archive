You could certainly just send the &quot;Accept&quot; header.  But this\nrequires you to have to initiate a call to OPTIONS just to see if there is a\ncontent-type you can handle (i.e. get a valid response or an error).  The\nadvantage of the options header is that it allows a resource to actively\ninform the client of those content-types that it can return.  This can avoid\nadditional roundtrips to the server.  Also, since OPTIONS does not seem to\nbe used all that much right now, this is a simple way to start telling\nclients that OPTIONS *is* being used for a given resource.  The lack of the\nheader is not an indication that OPTIONS is available for the resource\n(which is no different than things are now).  But an explicit statement of\nOPTIONS can have advantages.  Wrt the Google example I gave earlier, they\nwould not have to make two requests to every resource when only a very small\npercentage (e.g. &lt; .0000001%) would return a useful response to the OPTIONS\nrequest.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;S.

Why not just send an accept\n&gt; header with an OPTIONS request?

Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I like your version of the format quite a lot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing I&#39;d like to see in it that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missing is some way of finding out what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; content-types are available via\n&gt; &gt; &gt; content-negotiation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s necessary, though.  A client should submit to the\nserver\n&gt; &gt; the list of content-types that it understands (i.e. &quot;Accept&quot; header) and\nthe\n&gt; &gt; server should choose from that list or return an appropriate error\nresponse.\n&gt; &gt; What value would it be for a client to get back a list of content-types\nthat\n&gt; &gt; it didn&#39;t understand?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, I should point out that the format I suggest does allow a\nserver to\n&gt; &gt; return something like:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GET accept: text/html, text/*, */*\n&gt; &gt; GET accept-encoding: compress, gzip\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Basically, just about any request header could be specified.  The\nexample in\n&gt; &gt; my original post were just a sampling for demonstration and not the\ncomplete\n&gt; &gt; list of possibilities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the options header on GET, I like that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a concept, but the practice makes me nervous.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to avoid a proliferation of file formats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for this sort of thing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand your concern here.  As it is OPTIONS is woefully\n&gt; &gt; underutilized.  It makes sense that in this emerging world of new\nmetadata\n&gt; &gt; constructs, esp. wrt web services, the OPTIONS feature could fit the\nbill\n&gt; &gt; nicely (at least for some uses).  Regardless of the suggested header,\nanyone\n&gt; &gt; could return any response-entity of any content-type for OPTIONS right\nnow.\n&gt; &gt; There is no way we can avoid that.  What the header does is allow a\nresource\n&gt; &gt; to indicate that metadata is available via OPTIONS in certain formats.\nThis\n&gt; &gt; is more an ability to actively inform the client of OPTIONS abilities\nthan\n&gt; &gt; it is a method of proliferating multiple content-types when using\nOPTIONS.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
