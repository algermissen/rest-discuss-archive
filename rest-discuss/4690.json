I have to do so because I&#39;m studying what are the\n&gt;  differencies between implementig such a problem using PVM libraries\n&gt;  (in a local network) vs. using a RESTful way (in a potential\n&gt;  world-wide network).\n\nI am not sure that there are any conceptual differences at all. In both\ncases you have a single application (the calculation) and you need to\nrun all portions of the parallelized algorithm or your computation isn&#39;t\ndone. The only issue about distributing a calculation is speed (or maybe storage)\nand in both cases your calculation will just depend on the time needed for each\nportion to finish. I have no idea what problem would be solved by using REST,\ntherefore I have no idea what the comparision would reveal.\n\nBut maybe I am misunderstanding your point. If so, please try to explain.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  My questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt;         - I cannot use CGI, fastCGI or servlet. I need a method\n&gt;  or a library in C that allow me to bind, on the server side,\n&gt;  (name of the resource requested, method to handle it), just as a\n&gt;  xml-rpc-like way (e.g. the &quot;method registry&quot; used in xmlrpc-c server\n&gt;  library).\n&gt;  Can someone suggest me what library/method to use?\n\nYou could either write a server for the HTTP subset you need yourself\nor write an Apache module in C.\n\nI am not sure, but maybe libwww includes a server library also.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;         - What do you think about my search topic? Can someone\n&gt;  suggest me something on how can I expand it?\n\nWhy don&#39;t you compare WS-* vs. REST Web Services, with a special\nreserach on scalability and performance (&#39;Why does REST beat RPC when it\ncomes to large scale?&#39;) or on network effect issues (e.g. Why RPC style\ncannot take advantage) or on why document based data integration is\neasier than API based integration.\n\nDunno if that&#39;s within you subject at all, but maybe it gives you\nsome ideas.\n\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help would be very appreciated.\n&gt; Luke.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
