And it&#39;s\nfar from an abuse.  The part after the &quot;//&quot; is an authority, and a\npublic key is a perfectly valid authority.\n\nWhen you decentralize, you do sacrifice some advantages of\ncentralization, granted.  But I&#39;d personally be willing to make the\n&quot;rent a DNS address&quot; versus &quot;own a public key&quot; tradeoff if I could.\nAlso, nothing prevents Verisign from trying to push PKI here and\nsuggesting that all key holders need them as a CA.  Naming is as\nmuch a trust issue as it is anything else.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
