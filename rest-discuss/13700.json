So for one thing, there is no way to progressivel=\r\ny reserve items as you find them. (or maybe you can reserve them but then y=\r\nou can&#39;t say &#39;buy everything I reserved&#39;). Still this doesnt make transacti=\r\non-like behaviours impossible. It just necessitates that the transaction is=\r\n specified in one go.\n\nWell, the state of the order could be maintained on =\r\nthe server but\nthen transferred to the client for a &quot;Verify&quot; step, and then=\r\n submitted\nback to the server as the final step so that the server only use=\r\ns that\nstate in the message rather than the state it had been maintaining.\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However I fear this per-user resource thing is much more restrictive t=\r\nhan that. If I have a user account on a service, is that a per-user resourc=\r\ne? What if I want to add some preferences to the account? In the worst case=\r\n I can see, should the entire registration be repeated at every request? Is=\r\n restful design therefore completely at odds with having services that stor=\r\ne user profiles and allow the users to store things in that profile? So for=\r\n example an amazon S3-like service is impossible as storing your files in t=\r\nhe service is state,\n\nIt depends on what that state is and how its used in =\r\nmessages.  See above.\n\n&gt; and deleting a directory doesn&#39;t give details abou=\r\nt the files but only a pointer to the directory to be deleted.\n\nDepends wha=\r\nt the intent of the message is.  If it&#39;s to delete the\ndirectory independen=\r\nt of what&#39;s in it, then DELETE on that directory\ncaptures it.  If it&#39;s only=\r\n to delete some files in the directory but\nnot others, then you&#39;ll need mul=\r\ntiple messages.  If it&#39;s to delete the\ndirectory but only if the directory =\r\nis in some known state, then\nDELETE + If-Match would be required.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
