With Jabber and most other P2P\n&gt; systems, I can &quot;log on&quot; as me anywhere in the world and messages are\n&gt; forwarded to me. That&#39;s because there is an always-on intermediary that\n&gt; stands in for me. The lack of these intermediaries is a big problem for\n&gt; HTTP-based P2P and is the second major reason (beyond firewalls) that\n&gt; HTTP is not seen as much of a P2P solution.\nThen we will build them.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it probably doesn&#39;t make that much sense to connect to a true &quot;data\n&gt; server&quot; and wait for it to send you messages. I&#39;m not going to open a\n&gt; connection to Google and Slashdot and a dozen Weblogs and just sit\n&gt; there.\nNever said it would.\n\n&gt; More likely I have a single trusted intermediary with a single\n&gt; socket open for me.\nEventually, you could choose from many, and with dynamic DNS have your URI&#39;s\nmapped back to whatever IP and device you are using. But initially, a single\none is fine. Like the way Hotmail is a single trusted intermediary.\n\n&gt; It either polls those other sites or accepts notifications for me.\nIt won&#39;t poll those other sites or accept notifications. It accepts\nrequests, and the client provides responses. Just like every other part of\nthe Web. If the request is a POST that is a notification, sure.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It needs to do the message redirecting for me and it might as well have\n&gt; store and forward and presence capabilities at the same time.\nYou are correct sir.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Getting the trusted intermediaries out there and available involves a\n&gt; little bit of a bootstrapping problem.\nYep.\n\n\n"}}
