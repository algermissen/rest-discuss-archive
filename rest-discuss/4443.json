For any particular artist you want to retrieve:\n&gt;       - name\n&gt;       - eye color\n&gt;       - style\n&gt;       - web site\n&gt;       - everything (ie. all of the above)\n&gt;\n&gt;    This is a set of information that you wish to be able to address\n&gt;    individually or collectively.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. You want to run queries on the set of artists:\n&gt;       - artists with green eyes\n&gt;       - rap singers\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. You want to have arbitraty lists of artists:\n&gt;       - artists I like\n&gt;       - artists currently on tour\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, so that&#39;s not what you want but it will do to demonstrate the\nfollowing\n&gt; points.\n&gt;\n&gt; a) It doesn&#39;t matter how you reference your artists as the url is opaque.\n&gt;    Consequently you can keep it simple.\n&gt;         GET /artist/LisaSimpson\n&gt;\n&gt;    The URI could be /artist/12345678. The ONLY difference between this and\n&gt;    /artist/LisaSimpson is that the latter is easier for a human to\nremember.\n&gt;\n&gt;    This might return some xml like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;artist&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;name      id=&quot;/artist/LisaSimpson/name&quot;&gt;Lisa Simpson&lt;/name&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;eye-color id=&quot;./eye-color&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/eye-color&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;style     id=&quot;LisaSimpson/style&quot;&gt;Blues&lt;/style&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;web-site  id=&quot;./web-site&quot;\n&gt; href=&quot;http://www.thesimpsons.com/lisa-simpson&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/artist&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    I have mixed various forms of relative URI for demonstration purposes.\n&gt; Which one\n&gt;    you use doesn&#39;t really matter but you would probably choose one and\nstick\n&gt; with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; b)  Each property within the artist record has its own relative URI which\n&gt; you can dereference.\n&gt;     This means that the User Agent does not manufacture URIs. They are\n&gt; always provided by\n&gt;     the Origin Server.\n&gt;\n&gt;     The relative URI id=&quot;./eye-color&quot;&quot; resolves to:\n&gt;          GET /artist/LisaSimpson/eye-color\n&gt;\n&gt;     This might return the following xml:\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;eye-color artist=&quot;..&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/eye-color&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Note that it is possible to get back to the artist from here. I&#39;m not\n&gt; suggesting that you\n&gt;     have to do that, just pointing out that it is possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; c)  The entry can be created using a HTTP POST to the artist uri.\n&gt;\n&gt;       POST /artist\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;artist&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;name&gt;Bart Simpson&lt;/name&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;eye-color&gt;Blue&lt;/eye-color&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;style&gt;Rap&lt;/style&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;web-site&gt;http://www.thesimpsons.com/bart-simpson&lt;/web-site&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/artist&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     The same could be done using HTML form encoding.\n&gt;\n&gt;     The artist can be deleted like this.\n&gt;\n&gt;     DELETE /artist/BartSimpson\n&gt;\n&gt; d)  You can query on existing attributes of the artist.\n&gt;\n&gt;     GET /artist?eye-color=Blue\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;artistlist&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;artistref href=&quot;/artist/LisaSimpson&quot;&gt;Lisa Simpson&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;artistref href=&quot;/artist/Madonna&quot;&gt;Madonna&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/artistlist&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     GET /artist?name=Lisa%20Simpson\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;artistlist&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;artistref href=&quot;/artist/LisaSimpson&quot;&gt;Lisa Simpson&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/artistlist&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     These queries can be generated by an HTML Form. The query part\n&gt;     of a URL is not opaque to the User Agent. The client is expected\n&gt;     to provide query parameters for use in searches.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Note that the http path, before the query, is still opaque.\n&gt;     It could be /artist or /search or /cgi-bin/artistquery.cgi.\n&gt;     However, I believe that the prefered restful practice is to direct\n&gt;     the query to the collection URL, /artist in this case, and map this\n&gt;     to the search utility, typically by an entry in the htaccess file.\n&gt;\n&gt; e)  You can have arbitrary lists of artists.\n&gt;\n&gt;     GET /artistlists/my-favorites\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;artistlist title=&quot;My favorite artists&quot;&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;artistref id=&quot;./LisaSimpson&quot; href=&quot;/artist/LisaSimpson&quot;&gt;Lisa\n&gt; Simpson&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;artistref id=&quot;./BartSimpson&quot; href=&quot;/artist/BartSimpson&quot;&gt;Bart\n&gt; Simpson&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/artistlist&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Note that each item in the list has its own URI.\n&gt;\n&gt;     An entry in this list can be deleted like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;     DELETE /artistlists/my-favorites/BartSimpson\n&gt;\n&gt;     An entry can be added to this list like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;     POST /artistlists/my-favorites\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;artistref href&quot;/artist/BartSimpson&quot;&gt;Bart Simpson&lt;/artistref&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Points of note\n&gt; --------------\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.  URIs are always generated by the origin server.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  The client only calculates a URI in two circumstances:\n&gt;      a) it converts relative URIs, generated by the origin server,\n&gt;         into absolute URIs\n&gt;      b) it may add query parameters to the end of a search\n&gt;         URI provided by the origin server.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3.  All xml elements that can be addressed individually are provided\n&gt;     with a relative URI by the origin server.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this approach is restful, but I have thought that before and been\n&gt; wrong.\n&gt; I have not seen it suggested before, however, I have not trolled the\narchive\n&gt; so I\n&gt; cannot be certain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although I have not attempted it, it should be possible to process all the\n&gt; xml above into HTML using a suitable transform or style sheet.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you find this interesting and maybe even helpful.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Donald.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: David Orchard [mailto:orchard@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, 3 June 2004 9:33 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Identifiers: higher precedence than other\n&gt; &gt; fields?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was further thinking about modeling of identifiers in xml\n&gt; &gt; versus URIs and the use of them in relation to other fields for\n&gt; &gt; queries.  It seems that any XML identifier is problematic to\n&gt; &gt; algorithmically map to a URI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My scenario: I have an Artist List structure containing Artist\n&gt; &gt; structures with a Name and an uri reference, ie\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ArtistList&gt;&lt;Artist&gt;&lt;Name&gt;Thievery\n&gt; &gt; Corp&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;URI&gt;http://www.eslmusic.com/artists/thievery.html&lt;/URI\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/Artist&gt;&lt;/ArtistList&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to support getting the entire Artist information, or just\n&gt; &gt; a single field.  We earlier said that making the Artist\n&gt; &gt; identifier hierarchical is a Good Thing.  This would look like:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GET /ArtistList/Artist/id/xyz.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But in my xml data structure, I specified that the Name structure\n&gt; &gt; uniquely identifies the band in my database.  I end up having 2\n&gt; &gt; primary keys: one if I use URIs, and another if I were to do an\n&gt; &gt; XML based query.  If I used the Name as the key, the URI looks more like\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ./Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I then want to get the value of the URI field where the\n&gt; &gt; Artist=Thievery Corp, my query might look something like:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GET /ArtistList/Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp/URI\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; GET /ArtistList/Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp?field=URI\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I prefer the former because the URI field is hierarchical within\n&gt; &gt; the Artist structure, it&#39;s just that the darned Name messes up\n&gt; &gt; the hierarchy.  I don&#39;t want to use client side identifiers, ie\n&gt; &gt; fragment ids such as Artist#ThieveryCorp or even\n&gt; &gt; Artist/Name/Thievery%20Corp#thievery%20CorpURI\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I then thought in cases where the field being requested was at\n&gt; &gt; the same or lower level than the identifier, I could use the path\n&gt; &gt; component to specify the Artist, as in\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GET /ArtistList/Artist;Name=Thievery%20Corp/URI\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which I&#39;d interpret as for the Artist who&#39;s name field is\n&gt; &gt; thievery corp, get the URI field.  I wonder if this is a good way\n&gt; &gt; of modelling the query?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think you should now have the rough gist of the way that I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; thinking about binding xml structures to URIs, and this has led\n&gt; &gt; to some questions:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. What is the best design, or even the trade-offs to be made\n&gt; &gt; across designs, when binding xml identifiers to URIs\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. How should requests for a &quot;secondary resource&quot; in a component\n&gt; &gt; be expressed when the secondary resource is at the same level in\n&gt; &gt; the xml hierarchy as the xml identifier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t quite sure which way Roy was saying is the best way\n&gt; &gt; given the different examples of\n&gt; http://example.com/quotes/${exchange}/${symbol} and  /Artist/id/12345678.\n&gt; That is, whether the URI for the resource is parameterizable and thus\n&gt; generated by a client, or whether the identifier is opaque and the client\n&gt; has to do a 2nd pass to get it.  It seems like there&#39;s an important point\n&gt; about naming of resources, which is that maybe the xml way of identifying\n&gt; resources doesn&#39;t work well with the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again for all your time,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
