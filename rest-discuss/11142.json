I judge protocols on their\n&gt;&gt; merit. If a protocol i=\r\ns the best solution for the use cases it\n&gt;&gt; was designed for, it will surfa=\r\nce to the top. But I won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; recommend unnecessary complexity to promote a=\r\n spec.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the long term, that does more harm than good. I&#39;m actually\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; surprised that we&#39;re not looking at the WS-* agenda games as a\n&gt;&gt; lesson=\r\n learned. I&#39;m not convinced the answer is more politics,\n&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m very wo=\r\nrried about cargo culting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s our job to recommend the best technol=\r\nogy we know is\n&gt;&gt; sufficient to solve the problem at hand. And sometimes th=\r\nat\n&gt;&gt; means saying &quot;No. Not for this use case. Use your head, use\n&gt;&gt; [that]=\r\n instead.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hammering is something WS-* has suffered from, and I&#39;d hat=\r\ne to\n&gt;&gt; see the same happen to REST, because once the false claims turn\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ninto broken promises, all that&#39;s left is backlash, and backlash\n&gt;&gt; has a wa=\r\ny of diminishing the value of even the best\n&gt;&gt; technologies.\n&gt;\n&gt; You seem t=\r\no have lost the plot. Do you accept that having fewer,\n&gt; more generically u=\r\nseful media types is good REST design? Is that\n&gt; for political reasons, too=\r\n? If you find it acceptable, why do you\n&gt; accept the technical reasoning th=\r\nere but characterise it as\n&gt; despicable politics in protocols?\n\nHaving fewe=\r\nr, more generically useful [...] is a good design practice.\n It has to be w=\r\neighed against other design practices, but it&#39;s a good\ndesign practice to w=\r\neigh against.\n\nI&#39;m rephrasing it to avoid it being a strawman question. Tha=\r\nt also\napplies to what goes inside the Atom envelope, and it also applies t=\r\no\nthe combination of Atom and its content, but it&#39;s never the only good\ndes=\r\nign practice.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m seeing too many people enveloping everything they s=\r\nend with\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub, for no reason other than it&#39;s AtomPub, so it might be\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; good, right? I see people who don&#39;t bother to learn REST, they\n&gt;&gt; just e=\r\nnvelope with AtomPub =97 enveloping is easy, architecture\n&gt;&gt; style is hard.=\r\n They&#39;re not even using it right, but they marked\n&gt;&gt; the checkbox, and yes,=\r\n there&#39;s one case involving wrapping RPC\n&gt;&gt; calls inside AtomPub.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So =\r\nwhen the time comes and we get to see SOAP passing over the\n&gt;&gt; wire, except=\r\n the envelope is called AtomPub, would we stand\n&gt;&gt; back and smile and think=\r\n to ourselves &quot;mission accomplished&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub is a good solution, jus=\r\nt not the best solution to every\n&gt;&gt; problem. Using it like a hammer would b=\r\ne worse than not using\n&gt;&gt; it enough, possibly the worst thing that could ha=\r\nppen to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP has been suffering from a massive case of hammering fo=\r\nr a\n&gt; decade.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We need to teach developers how to engineer the right so=\r\nlution,\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the only way they could rise to the problem, not help\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthem cargo cult the next shiny spec or the next best whatever.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;=\r\nt see enough of that, and quite frankly it saddens me and\n&gt;&gt; in some way ev=\r\nen scares me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cargo cult happens. You cannot stop it. All you can do is=\r\n design\n&gt; for surviving it. The technologies that succeed in the long term\n=\r\n&gt; are those that have been so designed. People are morons; this is\n&gt; not a =\r\nbug.[1]\n\nIf you&#39;re saying AtomPub is the better cargo culting protocol ...\n=\r\nmaybe.  It&#39;s a great protocol, so why not.  But that&#39;s not my point.\n\nIf so=\r\nmeone comes to me and says &quot;I need to update a blog post&quot;, I&#39;m\ngoing to sta=\r\nrt by asking them if they know how to discover it&#39;s\neditURI.  And if the an=\r\nswer is yes, if they know how to extract that\nform.  And if the answer is y=\r\nes, if they know how to perform the\naction specified there.  And if the ans=\r\nwer is yes, in the span of a\nfew minutes, they just learned: a) more REST t=\r\nhan a day&#39;s reading will\nteach you, b) how to find and use APIs that alread=\r\ny exist, c) how to\nuse the simplest tool.\n\nI hold these lessons as more imp=\r\nortant than any protocol, no matter\nhow wonderful and great.  We should alw=\r\nays be teaching people how to\nfish.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]: http://diveintomark.or=\r\ng/archives/2004/08/16/specs\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;htt=\r\np://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
