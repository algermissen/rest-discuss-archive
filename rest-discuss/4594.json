Roy&#39;s right that\n&gt; declaring it with a mandatory extension would alleviate the problem of\n&gt; resources processing the request when they shouldn&#39;t, but IMO the\n&gt; request still needs to have uniform semantics in order to be RESTful.\n\nWe&#39;ve had this kind of discussion before, Mark.  You have invented\na constraint that does not exist in either the Web or my dissertation,\nand are saying it defines RESTful.  Sorry, you simply cannot say that.\nYou can say that REST + Mark&#39;s constraint is a better design, but\nyou can&#39;t say that REST contains a restriction unless it actually\nappeared in my dissertation (because REST is the name given to the\narchitectural style described there, not some general philosophy\nof design that changes over time). Otherwise, you&#39;ll drive me insane.\n\nThe expectation in REST is defined by the user agent&#39;s current\napplication state, which comes from the current set of representations\nthat created that state (e.g., the current Web page), the type\nof user agent being used, and the specific configuration for\nthat user.  Browsers know how to traverse Web pages because HTML\nand URIs tell them how to do so.  Browsers will know how to\ntraverse super-duper-query resources because the representation type\nthat links to those resources, along with URIs, will presumably tell\nthem how to do so in the same way that &lt;img src=&quot;..&quot;&gt; tells them\nhow to process in-line images.\n\nIn any case, 201 with a Location header field is a generic response\nthat doesn&#39;t require any special expectation to process.  Retrieving\nthat URI using a GET will give the browser a representation of the\nnewly identified resource (it might even have multiple representations\nthat are negotiated via Accept).  Assuming that there isn&#39;t any special\nmetadata provided along with that resource, the only one who will\nknow that it represents the query results of the previous POST is\nthe user, which is fine because nobody else needs to know!\nEveryone else just thinks of it as a new resource.\n\nIt is still REST because all of REST&#39;s constraints are being obeyed:\nthe application state remains on the browser, the messages are\nself-descriptive and stateless, and the representations (eventually)\nhave standardized media types.  Using POST does have the drawback\nthat external caching is not possible for the initial query, but\nsuch things are rarely cached right now anyway.  In any case,\nlack of GET-based caching does not mean it is less RESTful --\nit only means that it is less efficient.\n\nREST is, first and foremost, a way to understand and communicate\nthe properties of the Web circa 1999 or so.  It could not do so\nif it somehow excluded things like HTML forms and POST.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
