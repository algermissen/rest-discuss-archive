Generally you want to enable some form of strictness but\nalso enable people to actually do things with the rather lame tools that\nexist in the world. So anywhere you think you want to use a header, you\nmight also want to enable a way to dork it into the URI (query string,\nwhatever). API key, accept header, and method are good candidates.\n\nAccept makes it easy to request other representations from the browser,\nuseful for debugging and exploring. Method is useful for situations like\nSafari&#39;s lack of PUT and DELETE support in XMLHttpRequest.\n\nI&#39;ve worked with accept and method, but not API key. We&#39;ve chosen to\ndo basic auth and cookie handling but are hearing requests for keys so\nwe may go that way too.\n\n-- \nChris Dent                      http://burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt\n                              [...]\n\n"}}
