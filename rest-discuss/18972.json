Still not self-descriptive?\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re talking about self-descriptiveness and visibility and giving an\nexample which fails to state a media type, or assumes application/xml.\nDo you not see where this might be confusing to folks trying to learn\nREST?  While there are no &quot;degrees&quot; it&#39;s fundamental that a media type\nbe declared, registered, and suitable for a hypertext-driven API.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It is self-descriptive to an extent: it&#39;s a non-safe request to the\n&gt; cart resource to process the message in some way, it&#39;s a\n&gt; cache-invalidating request.\n&gt; \n\nSelf-descriptive fundamentally means that you&#39;ve declared a media type\nsuch that intermediaries can determine how to decipher the payload.\nYou can&#39;t just hand-wave your way around this requirement by stating\nthat it somehow isn&#39;t required for self-descriptiveness, that other\nfactors are enough.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to argue for superior self-descriptiveness, you need to\n&gt; explain why the additional visibility you are creating will enable\n&gt; otherwise-impossible intermediary mechanisms. Otherwise you should be\n&gt; arguing some other system property than self-descriptiveness.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t know what &quot;superior&quot; means, I&#39;m making an argument for the\nbasics here, and I have no idea what &quot;other&quot; system property this would\nfall under.  I&#39;m not creating &quot;additional&quot; visibility here, just\nstating the basic requirement for visibility.  If an intermediary can&#39;t\ndetermine how to process the payload, then anything else it can deduce\nabout the message (cache-invalidating, non-safe, etc.) is useful, how?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me like there is not a clear enough definition of\n&gt; &quot;self-descriptive&quot; and/or visibility. And this results in it being\n&gt; used as a go-to argument for anyone that prefers a long winded,\n&gt; verbose design approach. Which is a shame.\n&gt; \n\nThere is, but apparently you don&#39;t much care for it, instead making\nsemantic arguments about what else self-descriptive might mean, which\nseems to be your go-to argument for cutting corners on REST&#39;s\nconstraints.  The rest of us have long since achieved consensus on the\nmeanings of Roy&#39;s terminology.\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/specialization\n\nYou can&#39;t just redefine &quot;visibility&quot; to mean what you want it to mean,\nas I&#39;ve repeatedly tried telling you.  Your response is always\npersonal, i.e. my &quot;shameful long-winded verbose design approach&quot; and\nyour previous comments about how *you* prefer systems that actually\nwork. Well, I like systems that work, too, which is not mutually\nexclusive of implementing REST&#39;s constraints as you continually infer\nin your posts.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
