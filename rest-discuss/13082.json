HTTP  \nserver=\r\ns are not databases that blindly store the data. Using PUT to  \nupdate the =\r\nmutable parts of a resource is perfectly okay. At least, I  \ndon&#39;t see anyt=\r\nhing that breaks HTTP.\n\nSubbu\n\n\nOn Jul 2, 2009, at 8:01 AM, Sam Johnston wr=\r\note:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt; Typically you would express the overall writeability o=\r\nf a resource  \n&gt; via OPTIONS (e.g. if you can only GET it&#39;s read only), but=\r\n if you&#39;ve  \n&gt; got, say, a template driven website and you only want the bo=\r\ndy to be  \n&gt; updated then that&#39;s something different.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would almost ce=\r\nrtainly NOT be using PUT for this, rather accepting  \n&gt; POSTs of just the m=\r\nidifiable data (perhaps in HTML forms or some XML- \n&gt; based format). If you=\r\n were to use XML then a GET (with the  \n&gt; appropriate Accept: header) could=\r\n return just the parts which are  \n&gt; modifiable by the client. Optionally y=\r\nou could add information to  \n&gt; the URL about whether the client wants just=\r\n the writeable elements  \n&gt; or the whole lot, or even markup the elements a=\r\ns writable (or not).\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope that helps,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sam\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jul 1, 2009=\r\n at 9:42 PM, Jim Edwards-Hewitt  \n&gt; &lt;jimeh@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, ever=\r\nyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a newbie here (though not to REST in general), and the list  =\r\n\n&gt; archives have been a great help in clarifying my understanding of a  \n&gt; =\r\nlot of REST concepts and suggesting good design elements. I have one  \n&gt; pa=\r\nrt of my design right now where I&#39;m unsure what a good RESTful  \n&gt; approach=\r\n would be.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some =\r\nparts  \n&gt; that clients are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like a=\r\nn  \n&gt; uncommon case; I would think that navigation links, for example,  \n&gt; =\r\nwould typically not be modifiable in a PUT.) So is it better to:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Req=\r\nuire clients to submit all the read-only parts unmodified in a  \n&gt; PUT, and=\r\n respond with an error code if they are absent or altered?\n&gt; 2. Take advant=\r\nage of the leniency allowed in a server&#39;s  \n&gt; implementation of PUT to igno=\r\nre the read-only elements (or their  \n&gt; absence)?\n&gt; 3. Separate read-only e=\r\nlements into a sub-resource that only  \n&gt; supports GET? (This may not be fe=\r\nasible for resources which must be  \n&gt; created as a whole.)\n&gt;\n&gt; or somethin=\r\ng else?\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, there are some elements that are modifiable or not depe=\r\nnding  \n&gt; on the privileges held by the (authenticated) user. I would think=\r\n  \n&gt; this would be expressed by a difference in the representation  \n&gt; retu=\r\nrned to the client, but what should that difference be? (My  \n&gt; representat=\r\nions are XML documents, if there isn&#39;t a more general  \n&gt; solution.)\n&gt;\n&gt; An=\r\nd in a broader sense, I&#39;d like the client to know which elements  \n&gt; of the=\r\n resource the user can modify, for presentation purposes. Is  \n&gt; there a ge=\r\nnerally accepted way to do this, perhaps with form  \n&gt; templates or XForms?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be interested in any comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m  \n=\r\n&gt; just looking at it from the wrong angle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n\n"}}
