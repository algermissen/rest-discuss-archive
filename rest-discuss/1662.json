The mindset which makes REST evangelism\ndifficult is that of &quot;protocol independence.&quot; This is a sort of trendy\nbuzzword today. Unfortunately it is in competition with actually\nachieving interoperability. REST concentrates first and foremost on\ninteroperability.\n\nNevertheless, if you want to understand what they did &quot;wrong&quot; from a\nREST point of view, this list of &quot;REST mistakes&quot; might be a start: \n\nhttp://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes\n\n&gt; This paper , http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DL/0205071 , indicates the\n&gt; direction in which this protocol is heading. The establishment of a\n&gt; separate architecture for proxies and caching doesn&#39;t seem to make\n&gt; sense to me at all.\n\nAgreed! If they did HTTP right they wouldn&#39;t need that! \n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
