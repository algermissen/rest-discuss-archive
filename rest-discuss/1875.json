Jeff Bezos was there. All week I\nresisted introducing myself because I figured what was the point, he\nwould not be interested in seemingly tiny details like REST v. SOAP. But\nthen when I met the Amazon implementors they said that they *had*\ndiscussed the issue with Jeff! Doh!\n\nI did a webex web presentation for a huge publishing conglomerate and\nthey are very interested in REST. Also, I can&#39;t remember if I forwarded\nthe URL for the CIO of the State of Utah?\n\n http://www.windley.com/2002/07/03.html\n\nThe current SOAP specification says that the Google model was bad form\nso it should only be a matter of time before we can count them as REST-y\nalso.\n\nI am also working with Laird Popkin of the ICE consortium. Even before I\ntold him about REST they had been thinking about an HTTP-GET modality\nfor ICE to allow RSS-like usage modes.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
