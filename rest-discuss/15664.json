If this resource is not found (e.g. because it has been del=\r\neted before) a 404 will be returned.\n\nNow I wonder which status code should=\r\n be returned if the resource\n/mySets/{set}\nis not found.\nAlso a 404? A 400?=\r\n\n\nI&#39;m not so happy about a 404 because it lacks some semantics - the DELETE=\r\n on the subresource (or subsubresource) /mySets/{set}/{item} implies that /=\r\nmySets/{set} exists. If this is not given it might indicate a conflict or t=\r\nhat the client is wrong in some way.\n\nWhile looking for appropriate respons=\r\ne codes based on their name 409 (Conflict), 410 (Gone) or 412 (Precondition=\r\n Failed) sound interesting (see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616=\r\n-sec10.html#sec10.4 )) but their semantics does not match really.\n\nMy curre=\r\nnt choice would be to return 400 (Bad Request), but this has also different=\r\n semantics.\n\nDo you have suggestions how to handle this?\n\nThanx && cheers,\n=\r\nMartin\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
