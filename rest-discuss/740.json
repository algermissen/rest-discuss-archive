The entity format is specified by\n&gt;    the media type given in the Content-Type header field.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are the resource characteristics?  Is that the mime type of the\n&gt; resource created?  Does this mean that the mime type of the resource\n&gt; created goes in the Content-Type response header?\n\nHere&#39;s how I interpret it: when you create an entity you need to return\na reference to the entity not just in the header but also in the body\n(e.g. an HTML page that says &quot;click here to see your post&quot; or an XML\npage that has a URI attribute). In order for the client to select among\nthe potentially numerous URIs for the object, you should describe the\nreason that there are multiple URIs and the advantages of each.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
