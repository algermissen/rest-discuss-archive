My experiences with SOAP API&#39;s on the Microsoft\nplatform were that if you sneezed on the server API that defined the\ncontract you had to recompile and redeploy the clients.  And then\nthere is versioning.  In the WCF world versioning is a potential\nnightmare, with changing URLs, XML namespaces on service contracts,\nmessage contracts and data contracts.\n\nI believe that REST&#39;s use of hypermedia and conneg make maintenance,\ndeployment and versioning much easier, which translates to lower costs\nto the business in the maintenance phase of an application.\n\nDarrel\n\nOn Wed, Aug 26, 2009 at 4:55 PM, Justin\nCormack&lt;justin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to collect business rather than technical cases for REST/\n&gt; resource oriented rather than &quot;service oriented&quot; architectures.
