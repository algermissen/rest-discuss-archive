GData uses the [resource]/batch template.  Is this pretty\n&gt; much a standard?\n\nI would say, No. Mainly because it is SOAPy and violates the ground  \nrules. There were some interesting posts put forth by James Snell (not  \nsure if he is on this thread). In particular, check this out:\n\nhttp://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=886\n\nThis uses an unspecified BATCH verb. There are other similar ideas  \naround, and I am not aware of any consensus on this problem yet.\n\nSubbu\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
