[...]\n\nIndeed, I&#39;ll note that there is nothing in the HTTP spec which\nprohibits returning a body in the response to a DELETE request. So,\nalthough somewhat unorthodox wrt how one usually considers DELETE, it\nwould seem tht returning the head of the queue in the DELETE response\nwould address this issue rather elegantly.\n\n&gt; The ideal solution would be one method. Somethng like &quot;TAKE&quot;,\n&gt; i.e. &quot;IN&quot; using Linda terms.\n\nAgreed. It has been noted on this list before that there aree some\nsimilarities between Linda tuplespaces (or blackboard systems) and\nREST. I would argue that the HTTP protocol stack (including the\nextended methods deeinfed by the WebDAV working group) /is/ a\ncoordination language...\n\n&gt; [...] Maybe WebDAV should be used. [...]\n\nThis would be most appropriate, especially if the above approach using\nDELETE is not acceptable for some reason. Using a sequence of LOCK &gt;\nGET &gt; DELETE would provide the desired atomic behavior that is needed.\nin this situation.\n\nAs an aside, I&#39;ve been somewhat dismayed by the lack of discussion on\nthis list regarding the use of WebDAV methods to address the needs of\nRESTful applications. There has been a great deal of discussion on how\nto do WebDAVish things with straight HTTP, where the semantics of a\ngiven WebDAV method would fit the requirements. The result is\nfrequently a solution that feels contrived... Anyway, I&#39;ve said enough\nfor now.\n\nComments both welcomed and encouraged on any of the above.\n\n\nRegards,\nElias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
