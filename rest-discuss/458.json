I.e., the\nperson doing this thing today is the same person who did it yesterday.  In\norder to prove that continuity, all that&#39;s needed is a persistent secret that\nonly the principal in question knows, which can be used in a zero-knowledge\nfashion.  This can easily be done with 2 parties and relatively mild crypto.\n\nTying that in any useful way to the &quot;real world&quot; notion of identities is\nprobably unnecessary for most or all applications, and often undesirable.\nAnd that tying is the only reason for a trust relationship with a third-party\nauthentication / cert agent.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
