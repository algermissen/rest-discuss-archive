In order to manage this \n&gt; context, the coordinator associates it with writes done by each client. \n&gt; In a sense, this context a sum of client state. Further, my \n&gt; understanding is that, the most efficient way to manage this transaction \n&gt; context is by keeping the client-server protocol &quot;connection oriented&quot;. \n&gt; So, when you implement 2PC over a connection-less protocol, how is that \n&gt; context managed, other than by treating it as resource state?\n&gt; \n&gt; Subbu\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 4, 2009, at 1:01 AM, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Oct 2, 2009, at 3:40 PM, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, somebody will have to explain to me why (or if) the Reservation\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example I gave breaks the stateless constraint of REST.  Where I think\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Well - under the disguise of a &quot;transaction&quot;, the server is \n&gt;&gt;&gt; maintaining per-client state.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no per-client state.  A Reservation is interesting to a \n&gt;&gt; Travel Agent, a Customer, and to an Airline.  A credit or debit is \n&gt;&gt; interesting to a Credit Card Account and to the Merchant (and to Visa \n&gt;&gt; and Mastercard).Again, &quot;fulfilled&quot; for a reservation and \n&gt;&gt; &quot;posted/settled&quot; for a credit or debit are valid non-session-based \n&gt;&gt; states.  The fact that these states have a different representation (a \n&gt;&gt; tx-document) shouldn&#39;t matter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In stead of answering your question directly, let me ask you whether \n&gt;&gt;&gt; have you examined the scalability characteristics of your proposed \n&gt;&gt;&gt; design.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Integration scenarios many times require coordination between many \n&gt;&gt; actors.  It should be irrelevant if the client delegates this \n&gt;&gt; coordination to a different service.  All a transaction manager does \n&gt;&gt; is guarantee that something happens, which is hard to implement many \n&gt;&gt; times on a per-application basis.  This is why transaction managers \n&gt;&gt; exist.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It may be worthwhile to start from basics, apply each constraint one \n&gt;&gt;&gt; by one, and whether your approach benefits. The discussion around the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of resources needed, media types, link rels, link headers vs \n&gt;&gt;&gt; link elements in some XML format are implementation details. So far, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; this post does not make a case of why an transactional application \n&gt;&gt;&gt; should be built the way you propose.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, the way is interesting because the actors being coordinated can \n&gt;&gt; negotiate with the transaction manager on the exact protocol.  For \n&gt;&gt; example, the reservation resource is posted with a &quot;transaction&quot; link. \n&gt;&gt; The reservation service can GET that link with an Accept header of the \n&gt;&gt; preferred transaction formats it desires to interact with.  If the \n&gt;&gt; reservation service does not know how to interact with the transaction \n&gt;&gt; representation, it can barf at reservation creation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt;&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
