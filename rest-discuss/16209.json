Especia=\r\nlly I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wondering whether it is enough for the user agent to say\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Accept: application/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or whether the Ac=\r\ncept header should include the user agent\n&gt; &gt; capabilities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regarding t=\r\nhe individual order entries, e.g.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Accept: application/orderlist\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I consider media types as syntax, not semantics. If\n&gt; &gt; application=\r\n/orderlist really has different syntax than\n&gt; &gt; application/atom+xml, then,=\r\n OK I guess. But it probably shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt; Instead, the semantics of the r=\r\nesource are described by the @rel\n&gt; &gt; attribute the user-agent discovered a=\r\nnd followed (in combination\nwith\n&gt; &gt; data and its arrangement in the respon=\r\nse, including further links in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; response). Your resource could jus=\r\nt as easily return &quot;text/html&quot;\nwith\n&gt; &gt; the same semantics and, if the clie=\r\nnt understood HTML, could be\n&gt; &gt; processed meaningfully, in which case the =\r\nclient would emit &quot;Accept:\n&gt; &gt; application/atom+xml, text/html&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The q=\r\nuestion is whether Accept: text/html is indeed sufficient. Is it\n&gt; true tha=\r\nt the user agent can persue its implemented goal of compiling\na\n&gt; list of a=\r\nll newly ordered items from any HTML document?\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose the server prov=\r\nides both, application/order and text/html as\n&gt; representations of the list=\r\n of new orders. When a user agent comes\n&gt; along that says Accept: text/html=\r\n the server can freely assume\nbrowser-\n&gt; like capabilities of the user agen=\r\nt (any HTML will do; even an &lt;ul&gt;\n&gt; with items referring to scanned PNGs of=\r\n the orders). IOW, the owner of\n&gt; the server is free to change the implemen=\r\ntation for text/html as long\n&gt; as a) the resource semantics remain stable (=\r\nlist of new orders) and\n&gt; valid HTML is returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; How would the user a=\r\ngent implementation deal with HTML? Special\n&gt; syntactic assumptions are not=\r\n allowed (because of Accept: text/html)\nor\n&gt; would mean a hidden coupling. =\r\nHow would a user agent distinguish\n&gt; between an HTML it does not understand=\r\n but that contains orders (e.g.\n&gt; the list of scanned order images) and an =\r\nempty list of orders that is\n&gt; augmented with some HTML it does not (and ne=\r\ned not) understand?\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO that is impossible and hence Accept: text/html=\r\n does not cut it.\n\nI think all that demonstrates is that HTML is too generi=\r\nc to be useful\nfor your particular task, not that all media types require &quot;=\r\nspecial\nsyntactic assumptions&quot; (whether implicit or explicit). The fact tha=\r\nt you\ncan make a &quot;list&quot; in HTML using any of a hundred types of tags doesn&#39;=\r\nt\nmean Atom, for example, also suffers from the same inappropriateness to\ny=\r\nour task.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n\n"}}
