Also, SOAP&#39;s message model allows me to qualify queries \nthrough use of transport-neutral headers. For example, I may not have \nHTTP-based access to your machine, yet I may still want to send a \nSOAP request (over Jabber perhaps) that queries something on your \nbox. By adopting the SOAP messaging model, I can express any number \nof aspects of my query (e.g., signatures, privacy requirements, \nidempotency, cache control) using fairly rich XML-based \nheaders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nIs this true? I don&#39;t see anything in the spec which says that a HTTP \nGET request is not allowed to have an entity body (and therefore \ncontain XML documents or anything).\n\nPlease comment.\n\n- inthedarkplace\n\n\n"}}
