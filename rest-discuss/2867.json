SMTP.  DNS.  POP.  IMAP.  HTTP.  Etc., \netc., etc.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (HTTP is certainly an example of this.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it almost certainly _isn&#39;t_ an example of this. Take a look\n&gt; through the HTTP WG archives and think how long it took for HTTP/1.1 to\n&gt; be widely implemented and deployed.\n\nExactly.  This is an example of slow evolution once out &quot;in the wild&quot; \n--- slowness caused by the consensus-making effort.  But the adoption \ncurve had already been mostly ascended at that point.\n\n&gt;&gt; Very little if any innovation happens as the result of a\n&gt;&gt; consensus-making process.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed ... but we&#39;re not talking about innovation here, we&#39;re talking\n&gt; about the adoption of common interfaces. Anyone with a bright idea can\n&gt; strike out on their own, but it takes a different (and often more\n&gt; expensive) kind of effort to get everyone else to follow.\n\nThat&#39;s true.  My point is that in the best examples of rapid adoption \nof technology that we&#39;ve got to work with --- the Web, for instance --- \nthe &quot;common interface&quot; that drives initial adoption is *not* the result \nof a consensus-building effort, but rather a unilateral innovation.\n\n&gt;&gt; Progress is driven by unilateral invention, and the rest of the world\n&gt;&gt; just follows along.\n&gt;\n&gt; I admire your optimism, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t share it.\n\nActually, I don&#39;t see that as optimism at all --- more like something \nbetween pragmatism and fatalism.  It would be great if it were the case \nthat technological progress (wrt network protocols, for example) could \nbe driven farther and faster by cooperative groups.  Unf., there&#39;s \nalmost a reverse scaling factor;  the more heads get thrown at a \nproblem, the less progress is made.  I wouldn&#39;t call that realization \n&quot;optimism&quot; --- it relies on gestalt to drive things forward.\n\nAnd this isn&#39;t a philosophical position I particularly like, either.  \nOTOH, look around:  in the protocol and &quot;killer app&quot; worlds, you can \nclearly identify in every instance a small number of individuals who \ndrove initial adoption and deployment.\n\n&gt; Also note that continuous unilateral innovation is _disruptive_ of\n&gt; existing standards ... a good thing IMO, and one which I think supports\n&gt; my argument.\n\nI think we&#39;re arguing two different things, here.  I&#39;m arguing about \nhow technological innovation and proliferation happens, you&#39;re talking \nabout how technology incrementally evolves.\n\n&gt; Umm ... big-Oh means I _don&#39;t_ need to weight anything.\n\nActually, you&#39;re using big-Oh to measure dimensionless scalar \nquantities.  What I&#39;m saying is that you assume that you&#39;re using the \n*same* dimensionless scalar in both cases, and that&#39;s not a safe \nassumption.\n\n&gt; As I said, I only have a conjecture and some anecdotal evidence. It&#39;d \n&gt; be\n&gt; very interesting to see some serious research work done on this.\n\nIf I ever manage to hit it big again, and manage to get out of the \nmarket with the shirt on my back, I&#39;d like to do some &quot;serious&quot; \nresearch work on this.\n\n:-)\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
