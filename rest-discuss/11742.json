Here&#39;s what I wrote back then [1].\n&gt; Interestingly, after a =\r\npresentation I gave yesterday, somebody\n&gt; suggested something very similar;=\r\n Paul Fremantle, who happened to be\n&gt; there, and myself still believe this =\r\nwould be worth pursuing.\n&gt;\n&gt; A while back, Sanjiva Weerawarana proposed (vi=\r\na email) a way to\n&gt; decentralize media types. I think the proposal was exce=\r\nllent; Dan\n&gt; Diephouse=92s excellent latest blog post [2] reminded me of it=\r\n again.\n&gt; Here=92s a brief introduction to a possible solution for =93decen=\r\ntralizing\n&gt; media types=94.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Problem\n&gt; In a plain HTTP interaction, =\r\nthe Content-type and Accept headers carry\n&gt; information about the type of t=\r\nhe data being transmitted and accepted,\n&gt; respectively. You=92ve seen these=\r\n media types in numerous examples, e.g.\n&gt; a typical request or response mig=\r\nht have a Content-type header with\n&gt; the value application/xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; The pro=\r\nblem with this approach is that media types have to be\n&gt; registered central=\r\nly with IANA. This means that while you can invent\n&gt; your own media types, =\r\nnobody will know about them =97 unless you go\n&gt; through the time-consuming =\r\nprocess of actually having your media type\n&gt; registered.\n&gt;\n&gt; What=92s wrong=\r\n with application/xml? Nothing, really, except that it\n&gt; doesn=92t tell you=\r\n anything more than that what is being sent is XML:\n&gt; You don=92t have any =\r\nway to tell what XML it is unless you actually\n&gt; parse and e.g. look at the=\r\n outer element=92s XML namespace.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Solution\n&gt; What Sanjiva (and his =\r\ncollaborators, Paul Fremantle, Jonathan Marsh\n&gt; and James Clark) propose is=\r\n this: Define a single new media type,\n&gt; application/data-format, with a re=\r\nquired parameter uri. This uri\n&gt; points to a definition of the data format,=\r\n like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; application/data-format;uri=3Dhttp://mediatypes.example.com=\r\n/foo/bar\n&gt;\n&gt; The uri is an HTTP URI that points to an RDDL document, in oth=\r\ner\n&gt; words: you can do an HTTP GET on it and retrieve a documentation of\n&gt; =\r\nthe data format that=92s both human-readbable as well as machine-\n&gt; process=\r\nable.\n&gt;\n&gt; My Opinion\n&gt; I think this is an excellent proposal, specifically =\r\nbecause it does\n&gt; not rely on a centralized authority, and re-uses the name=\r\nspacing\n&gt; concepts of the Web. It=92s also fully agnostic towards any speci=\r\nfic\n&gt; data format =97 you can use your own binary or text format, something=\r\n\n&gt; like JSON or YAML, and if you pick XML, you=92re free to use DTDs, RELAX=\r\n\n&gt; NG schemas, Schematron or even XML Schema to document it. It=92s also\n&gt; =\r\ngreat in that it allows for clients with different knowledge about any\n&gt; pa=\r\nrticular format to do their best to handle it. One client might be\n&gt; hard-c=\r\noded against the complete string; another might retrieve the\n&gt; RDDL, look f=\r\nor an XSD, and dynamically render some fancy visual\n&gt; representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n think the concept could even be extended to allow for querying of\n&gt; suppor=\r\nted media types: You could just do a GET on the resource with an\n&gt; accept h=\r\neader of application/data-format and get back the link to the\n&gt; RDDL (if th=\r\nere is any).\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe there=92s something immediately, obviously wrong wit=\r\nh this idea =97\n&gt; but if so, I can=92t see it.
