It looks to me like a\n &gt; resource identifier path is equivalent to the &#39;model&#39;\n &gt; in an MVC architecture. I think the &#39;view&#39; or\n &gt; &#39;controller&#39; settings should go in the query.\n\n\nI like the analogy.\n\nHowever, wouldn&#39;t it be more appropriate to consider HTTP (and its \nverbs) as the &#39;controller&#39;..?\n\nThe MVC model doesn&#39;t really answer the question though.. because it&#39;s \nnot immediately clear if &#39;pagination&#39; would be a function of the Model \n(after all, &#39;page number&#39; and &#39;page size&#39; modify the actual dataset, \nwhile &#39;sort column&#39; and &#39;sort order&#39; merely modify the presentation of \nthe dataset) or the View. My gut feeling is that I&#39;d lump pagination in \nthe Model, therefore the URI, per your analogy. However, &#39;presentation \ntier&#39; things, like style, or document format, are clearly View \nfeatures.. so would this be the preferred URI:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/?format=html-4.01&style=green\n\nOr perhaps this would be better (it&#39;s a proper hierarchy in the path)\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/10/1/?sort-column=1&sort-order=desc&format=html-4.01&style=green\n(/10 requests a restriction on the number of items per page, and /1 \nrepresents the page number to return. It seems natural to have the \npage-size first in this case, as the omission of a page number from the \nURI would allow the &#39;default page&#39;, i.e. page one, to be returned.)\n\nAs an aside, I think I&#39;m beginning to form the opinion that the &#39;MVC&#39; \npattern is not an &#39;application wide&#39; pattern... it seems to pop up \ninside various &#39;layers&#39;.\n\n &gt; But what do I know? I only answered to keep the thread\n &gt; going, and see what reaction I provoked, not because I\n &gt; have any expertise.\n\n\nThanks. Hopefully we&#39;ll get a few more opinions! :)\n\nJohn.\n\n"}}
