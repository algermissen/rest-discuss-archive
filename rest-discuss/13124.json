If it&#39;s the former, the\n&gt;&gt; case is not necessarily stronger for HTTP conneg - but parties such as\n&gt;&gt; browser vendors and WHATWG should be encouraged to provide the\n&gt;&gt; mechanisms necessary to pursue this alternative, non-conflicting,\n&gt;&gt; approach to content negotiation.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; As far as my understanding of your question goes, you&#39;re trying to define an\n&gt; identifier of a representation as URI of resource, plus verb, plus whatever\n&gt; message headers impact on the selection of the representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I make the argument that one shouldn&#39;t try to define such an identifier. The\n&gt; identifier of a resource is enough, and if it is the case that you want to\n&gt; identify a specific representation, then making that representation a\n&gt; resource ought to be enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; The state transition is the result of dereferencing such identifier, and is\n&gt; dependent on the state of the application. As such, it is of course\n&gt; dependent on the current state the client has, if any, and the current state\n&gt; the server holds.\n&gt;\n&gt; I just don&#39;t see what the conneg of an entity body has to do with the state\n&gt; transition, I see them at different levels in the http layers, and I\n&gt; certainly have modelled it that way in my framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I just don&#39;t get what problem you&#39;re trying to solve here.\n&gt;   \n\nI could be wrong - but I was under the impression that a hyperlink can \nbe more than just a URI.\n\n\n"}}
