Just like real life (Sorry for the delay=\r\n in replying, I was\nout for dinner&lt;g&gt;).\n\nIt&#39;s pretty rare that a Web applic=\r\nation can be implemented in a way\nsuch that each resource is reachable via =\r\none _and only one_ URI and\nthose resources exist at the one URI forever.\n\nE=\r\nxamples are: any app that moves items from &quot;active&quot; to &quot;archive&quot; or\n&quot;draft&quot;=\r\n to &quot;publish&quot;; uses work-in-progress style processing where the\n&quot;same data&quot;=\r\n moves from one place to another over it&#39;s meaningful\nlifetime. You can mit=\r\nigate some of this through the use of\nContent-Location headers and or redir=\r\nect responses, but not all the\ntime, and it&#39;s not always necessary or advis=\r\nable.\n\nAnd yes, these types of patterns can have negative effects of caches=\r\n.\nThat&#39;s where there are control data (headers) to better manage those\nthin=\r\ngs including ETag & Last-Modified in cases where accurate\nresponses are mor=\r\ne important than low-latency responses.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\n=\r\nOn Wed, May 19, 2010 at 17:19, Morten &lt;mortench2004@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- =\r\nDen ons 19/5/10 skrev mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; According to yo=\r\nur scheme, the same resources would be available\n&gt; as part of the result at=\r\n many URLs f.x.\n&gt;\n&gt; /documents/mike\n&gt; /mike/documents\n&gt; /documents/may21001=\r\n0\n&gt;\n&gt; or exactly at:\n&gt; /documents/mike/docid12345\n&gt; /mike/documents/docid12=\r\n345\n&gt; /documents/may210010/docid12345\n&gt;\n&gt; But that would mean that there wo=\r\nuld be no 1-1 mapping between logical resources and URL&#39;s + the URLs would =\r\nbe transient so what you could find today would not necessarily be found to=\r\nmorrow + caching would not work as good as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is also a di=\r\nscussion &quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1622085/how-to-obtain-rest-res=\r\nource-with-different-finder-methods&quot; about this.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like the comment by =\r\n=A0Will Hartun &quot;Having a unique name is important for cache coherency in a =\r\nREST architecture.
