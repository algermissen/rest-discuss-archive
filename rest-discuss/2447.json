Doesn&#39;t that effectively\n&gt;&gt;&gt;cripple the resource, upsetting the expectations of other clients?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The server is free to reject the PUT request with something like:\n&gt;&gt;    406 Not Acceptable\n&gt;&gt;    409 Conflict\n&gt;&gt;    415 Unsupported Media Type\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Also, some readings of 2616 woud say that on a PUT, there&#39;s no \n&gt;&gt;transforming a representation to the existing resource type.   You&#39;re \n&gt;&gt;just storing the representation as is.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In that case, does the PUTted representation become the resource at that\n&gt;URI? \n&gt;\nYes.\n\n&gt;If not, the implications are scary.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So do you disallow certain types of representations from being PUT or \n&gt;&gt;&gt;POSTed? That certainly seems like a practical response to the problem.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But I would think that in a very large proportion of cases, you&#39;d have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to prohibit any type but the original type of the resource--in which\n&gt;&gt;&gt;case the distinction between resource and representation seems rather\n&gt;&gt;&gt;academic.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Dont confuse a resource with the entity that backs the resource.  A \n&gt;&gt;resource is a logical construct - a concept.  A resource may be backed \n&gt;&gt;by a document, and the bytes that comprise that document may correspond \n&gt;&gt;exactly to the representation of the resource, but the resource and the \n&gt;&gt;representation are never the same thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m aware of the distinction, but I&#39;m questioning whether it has any\n&gt;practical value in cases where there is no transformation.\n&gt;\nI guess I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re getting at.  What do you \nmean by &quot;there is no transformation&quot;?  I don&#39;t think you can (or should) \nsay that a resource is transformed into a representation - that might \nimply many things that probably aren&#39;t true.  It might be better to say \nthat a resource generates a representation.\n\nThe only entity that knows whether there is &quot;no transformation&quot; is the \nresource&#39;s implementation.  No other entity has any way to make that \ndetermination - nor do I see any value in trying to do so.  When you \nrequest a representation of a resource, why do you care how that \nrepresentation was generated?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
