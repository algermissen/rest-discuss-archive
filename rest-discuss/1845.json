Although\n&gt; I realize that URIs are opaque, I&#39;m trying to have them look reasonable\n&gt; should people see them - the problem I&#39;m having is how to differentiate\n&gt; between &quot;give me a representation of the container&quot;, and &quot;give me a\n&gt; represenation of everything inside the container&quot;, without having the\n&gt; URIs seem very verbose.\n&gt; ...\n\nI&#39;m trying to understand what the difference between a container&#39;s\nrepresentation, and the container&#39;s representation of its subcontainers, is.  I\nthought they would be the same thing.  But perhaps this approach doesn&#39;t fit\nyour situation well.  Or maybe the container resource should support both?\n\nOne thing I try to remember is that a URI could point to an entity that doesn&#39;t\nphysically exist.  In other words, upon receiving a GET request, the server\ncould determine that the URI is logical and maps (in some way only known to the\nserver) to a physical one.\n\nSo you might initially do a GET /foo, which returns a representation of the\nserver&#39;s physical container resource /foo that indicates the relative URI\n&#39;containers&#39; would return a list of /foo sub-container representations.  Then,\nyou could do a GET /foo/containers and go from there.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
