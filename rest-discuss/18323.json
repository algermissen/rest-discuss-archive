If these types are visible on the network then we can=\r\n (in theory) have transparent/invisible intermediates that transform back-a=\r\nnd-forth when communicating with the other business. Just as we can transfo=\r\nrm images.\n\nThe same could of course be done on the clients instead of insi=\r\nde the network - but Opera Mini do not do that for good reasons.\n\nUsing net=\r\nwork visible media-types opens up for use cases that we cannot imagine righ=\r\nt now.
