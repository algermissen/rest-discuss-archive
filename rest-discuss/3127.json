I&#39;m fairly certain that the cache is not allowed to update its\ncontents based on that PUT request, since it has no idea whether the PUT\nwill even be accepted by the origin server.\n\nWhat it *is* allowed to do, though, is mark its cached copies as\n&#39;stale&#39;, so that the next GET request for that resource will cause the\ncache to query the origin server for the most recent version.\n\nThis behaviour is only given the strength of &#39;SHOULD&#39;, since not doing\nit doesn&#39;t weaken the caching semantics in any way. The old version of\nthe resource can still be served until it expires -- just as all of the\nother caches, which didn&#39;t see the PUT, will be doing.\n\n\n&gt; If the origin server had changed &quot;&lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;&quot; to\n&gt; &quot;&lt;number&gt;one&lt;/number&gt;&quot; things could get ugly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If PUT did require the entity to be stored as-is (which we keep\n&gt; hearing it does) then this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.\n\nI don&#39;t think this section of RFC 2616 has anything to say about whether\nthe server must store the entity as-is. If the server modifies the entity\nwhen it receives it, then the cache should retrieve the modified version\nwhen it revalidates.\n\nThe existence of caching, though, does mean that you can&#39;t assume that a\nGET issued immediately after a PUT will return the recently-PUT entity.\nIt could legitimately return with any non-expired version of the entity\npreviously served by the origin server.\n\n\nIan Clelland\n&lt;ian@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
