And it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; far from an abuse.  The part after the &quot;//&quot; is an authority, and a\n&gt; &gt; public key is a perfectly valid authority.\n&gt; \n&gt; How is this less of an abuse than using email\n&gt; address?  distobj@... is also an authorty...\n\nI didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just tied to DNS too (MX records or A\nrecords, doesn&#39;t matter), so has the same icky dependancy.  You can\nonly rent those names, not own them.\n\n&gt; Ok, but onces you invoke a CA you are talking\n&gt; about something different:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://[rohit&#39;s CA id]/adam\n&gt; \n&gt; The CA then certifies a particular public key as\n&gt; being under the control of the entity represented\n&gt; by this ID.  To me this all sounds like DNS with\n&gt; SSL certificates.\n\nWell, sorta.  I&#39;m not saying that a CA is required, only that Verisign\ncould play it this way (I wonder if they knew what they were getting\ninto when they acquired Netsol?).  Plus, though a CA centralizes one\npart of the system (trust), you still *own* your key.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
