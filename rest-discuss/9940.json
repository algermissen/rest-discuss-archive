Certainly the example I saw recently of an\n&gt;  image search application, which requires an image as an examplar to base\n&gt;  a search on, seems to fall into this category. Is this a reasonable answer?\n\nIndeed, my answer to most of these things is that if you hit some\nlimit like that within REST, you&#39;re doing something wrong. It may be\nthat there *are* certain limits to things, but they are good hints ;\nif it looks wrong, or can&#39;t be done the way you want it, or it&#39;s a bit\nkludgy, or hackish, then, well, you&#39;re doing it wrong.\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
