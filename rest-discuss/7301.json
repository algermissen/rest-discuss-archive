The Blueprint file &quot;feels&quot; like it&#39;s too ti=\r\nghtly bound to the\nclass and\n&gt; might be better if it were more loosly bound=\r\n allowing a lot more\n&gt; flexibility. My caveat is that this is just my subje=\r\nctive impression\nand I\n&gt; may be misinterpretting.\n\nYou are quite right.  Fo=\r\nr now, the blueprint&#39;s primary use is to\ndescribe how to map the instance m=\r\nethods to URIs.  Should the format\noutgrow this initial use, then I&#39;d certa=\r\ninly need to revise it to\ncreate greater separation in concerns: one for sp=\r\necifying the service\ndefinition and another for the binding.\n\n \n&gt; 2.) Given=\r\n how so many people evidently misunderstand REST principles\n(this\n&gt; from wh=\r\nat others on REST-discuss have told me recently) I think the\n&gt; &quot;verb/method=\r\n&quot; syntax might confuse people that don&#39;t yet understand\nREST.\n&gt; May I propo=\r\nse, assuming similar syntax w/o incorporating any of my\ncomments\n&gt; from #1:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;      &lt;feature&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;signature&gt;answer/&lt;/signature&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;=\r\nHttpMethod&gt;GET&lt;/HttpMethod&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;InstanceMethod&gt;GetAnswer&lt;/InstanceM=\r\nethod&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;/feature&gt;\n\nWow, that&#39;s going to be hard for me! :)  I starte=\r\nd using the term\n&#39;verb&#39; for HTTP methods way back.  I think it was Henrik t=\r\nhat\nintroduced me to it.  Also, I like keeping two distinct vocabularies\nar=\r\nound: blueprint vs. class, service vs. instance, verb+signature vs.\nmethod.=\r\n  It reduces confusion when talking about both concepts\nsimultaneously.\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n 3.) I was confused by your use of &quot;@&quot; for &quot;@config&quot; and &quot;@inspect.&quot;\n May I=\r\n\n&gt; ask why you chose to use them instead of just &quot;config&quot; and &quot;inspect?&quot;\n&gt; =\r\nAccording to RFC 3986, the &quot;@&quot; sign is a reserved character [1]  in\na URL\n&gt;=\r\n and thus it&#39;s not really a good idea to use them because them much\nbe URL\n=\r\n&gt; encoded, and they might even conflict with potential future usage.\n\nAh ye=\r\ns, the ugly &#39;@&#39; prefix. It&#39;s to avoid naming clashes between\nbuilt-in and c=\r\nustom URIs.  Maybe we should have used &#39;.&#39;. \n\n\n&gt; Again, I&#39;m not a REST expe=\r\nrt (yet :) so I look forward to the others\nhere\n&gt; weighing in on both of ou=\r\nr comments.\n\nSame here.  I really appreciate any and all feedback.  Thanks.=\r\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n- Steve\n\n\n"}}
