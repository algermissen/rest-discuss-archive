I think the example you\n&gt; used was a travel site where your itinerary and ticket were resources\n&gt; with URIs so you could return to them and take subsequent actions.\n\nAs you know (but others may not) I said that you probably don&#39;t really\nneed a concept of &quot;session&quot; at all.\n\n&gt; How far do you think this idea could be pushed?\n\nHard to say. I think that the whole web services world needs to figure\nout what is going to happen with transactions (or should clients just\nunroll actions?). If real transactions end up being necessary for web\nservices then I guess a transaction is a kind of session...\n\n&gt; What are the drawbacks?\n\nIf you can&#39;t use a session ID to refer to a large body of shared context\nthen you may end up sending more information in each message to\nestablish context. Also resource cleanup typically will not happen\nautomatically when a &quot;session ends&quot; as it might in a stateful protocol.\nNo matter what model you use, resource cleanup is a nasty issue.\n\n&gt; Could it eliminate cookies and other session-management kludges?\n\nIMO, cookies arise because web clients are not web servers and are not\nguaranteed to have any &quot;writable&quot; resource space. Cookies are not very\ngood if you don&#39;t trust the servers you talk to (as you should not).\nObviously there are privacy problems but also it seems clear that they\ncould be used for a nasty denial of service -- except that they are\nrestricted from being very large or numerous. So the standard way to\nprevent the DOS is to apply arbitrary limitations that restrict their\nutility. So I don&#39;t see the cookie solution as really scaling up to the\nweb services world.\n\nWhat should happen, from a privacy and security point of view, (if not\nfrom a usability point of view) is that &quot;client-side&quot; state should be\nstored in files with URIs. Access should be granted or not explicitly.\nThe contents should be transparent. I am amazed how many sites force\ncookies on me and when I turn them off the site&#39;s performance does not\ndegrade at all. The cookie seems not to provide any advantage to me, the\nuser, only to the marketers trying to track my progress through the\nsite.\n\nIn some ways Hailstorm was on the right track. You don&#39;t want to store\nstate on a particular client device -- especially implicitly! I do not\nbelieve that browsers even give me an option of &quot;exporting my cookies&quot;\nso obviously no important state can be stored in them.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m also thinking of &quot;conversation ID&quot; and other tags in message-\n&gt; oriented SOAP that are addressed to hidden resources.\n\nI personally don&#39;t see the value in the reifying the &quot;conversation&quot;.\nIt&#39;s just a short-cut that allows one message to rely on some state\nimplicitly sent through a previous message. Just like cookies, it ties\nthe whole conversation to a single device which may prevent\nmodularization. Perhaps I&#39;m missing some hidden advantage...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
