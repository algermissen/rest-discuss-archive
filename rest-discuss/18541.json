The goal of my thesis is the development of a graphical\n&gt; modeling=\r\n language for resource-oriented (aka RESTful) applications\n&gt; following crit=\r\neria defined by Daniel Moody [1].\n&gt; Part of this development is also the ev=\r\naluation of the new language I\n&gt; have developed regarding these criteria.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; I would therefore like to ask you for your support by taking the\n&gt; quest=\r\nionnaire I have devised to do that evaluation. Filling out the\n&gt; questionna=\r\nire will take about 20 minutes. It is available online under\n&gt; the followin=\r\ng URL:\n&gt; http://bit.ly/visualRest\n&gt;\n&gt; As a small &quot;thank you&quot; for filling ou=\r\nt the questionnaire, you also\n&gt; have the chance to win one of three books a=\r\nfterwards (details can be\n&gt; found under the aforementioned URL).\n&gt;\n&gt; The qu=\r\nestionnaire is online and ready to take input starting today\n&gt; (February 7t=\r\nh) and will be closed on February 20th.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really appreciate your =\r\nhelp and am looking forward to your\n&gt; answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you and best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Oliver van Porten\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Ya=\r\nhoo!
