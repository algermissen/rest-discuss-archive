Not just the ones that are valid now, but all of those\nthat might ever be valid.\n\nIn contrast, if you design the system such that negotiated URIs\ncannot be authored (they redirect using 300 instead), then the\nclient doesn&#39;t need to know in advance how the resource is\nimplemented.  If the server receives an XML replacement for a\nnegotiated URI, it can redirect to the media-specific URI for XML.\nIf the server receives the same for a non-negotiated URI, it can\nsimply replace the current representation and respond with 200.\n\nThat way, the client gets informed of the URIs for the other\nspecific resources that it might need to author or delete.\n\nNote that there is yet another resource in effect here, and\nthat is the one that tells the server how to map each resource\nto a set of representations.  That can be authored as well\nif we give it a URI of its own.\n\n&gt; Doing it this way gives the server the chance to say: sorry, that\n&gt; representation isn&#39;t supported by me (if the user submitted something\n&gt; un-indexable perhaps).\n\nWhy would anyone want such a feature?\n\n&gt; Of course, I&#39;d be pretty annoyed if I&#39;d just typed war and peace into\n&gt; a text box and the server said that.\n\nI&#39;d be pretty annoyed by the text box. ;-)  HTML forms are not a\ngood editing environment and HTTP certainly isn&#39;t limited to them.\nMS Word writes directly to web folders which is just another\nHTTP client library (with bugs).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
