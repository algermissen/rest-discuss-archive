The labels then change to REST and\nSOAP, representing the evolution of the two viewpoints (My assertion is\nif you&#39;re an HTML & Web App person, REST seems natural. Similarly, if\nyou&#39;re used to DCOM, CORBA, etc. SOAP seems fine & dandy). The circles\nthen move to overlap partially, and a question-mark appear in the\noverlap area. This represents the point of intersection of the 2 models,\nwhich is also one of the pain points. I don&#39;t believe this is a\ncoincidence. The thesis for my talk is that this area of intersection\n(called RESTful SOAP) is actually a good thing, as it provides an\nopportunity for SOAP to learn valuable architectural lessons from REST,\nand an opportunity for REST to benefit from SOAP&#39;s widespread acceptance\namong corporate developers.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chuck Hinson [mailto:cmhinson@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 23, 2002 9:49 AM\n&gt; To: Peter Drayton\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful SOAP presentation\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Any chance of converting powerpoint to html so those of us without \n&gt; powerpoint can look at the slides too.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Drayton wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;At the recent Web Services DevCon I did a talk on REST & \n&gt; SOAP, and how\n&gt; &gt;they can be combined in a RESTful manner. The slides are at \n&gt; [1] - I&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt;interested in any feedback this group has to help me improve \n&gt; the talk. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks especially to all the participants in this group \n&gt; (which I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt;lurking in for ages now :-)) for helping to shape my \n&gt; thinking on REST &\n&gt; &gt;SOAP. I&#39;m hoping that RESTful SOAP will start to gain \n&gt; traction as people\n&gt; &gt;figure out that REST & SOAP can be complimentary and that RESTian\n&gt; &gt;thinking contains some important ideas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--Peter\n&gt; &gt;http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog\n&gt; &gt;http://staff.develop.com/peterd\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;[1] http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2002/10/22.html#a362\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
