Problem is that I don&#39;t know how to create a &quot;common\nunderstandi=\r\nng of the payloads passed between&quot; client and server and my\nmind tends to g=\r\no to the &quot;how can the server successfully export its\nprivate objects in a w=\r\nay that clients can see and use them&quot;.  Need help\nunderstanding this concep=\r\nt further.\n\nMy current thought process (please correct):\n\nI would like to r=\r\neturn a list of entities from a search.  Atom could\nprovide the list, but a=\r\nn agent will not understand my content payload\nwithout some a priori knowle=\r\ndge.\n\nLets say I have an entity &quot;Person&quot; with 3 elements: &quot;name&quot;, &quot;address&quot;=\r\n,\nand  &quot;age&quot; with associated data types String, String, Int.  In the past,\n=\r\nI would have created a schema that described this entity and passed this\nin=\r\nformation inside a Collection element.  But this seems to cause\nproblems do=\r\nwn the line.  If I change this concept to something like:\n\n&lt;items&gt;\n   &lt;item=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://example.com/5612315623156&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;data name=3D&quot;name&quot;&gt;Roy&lt;/d=\r\nata&gt;\n     &lt;data name=3D&quot;address&quot;&gt;12 Foobar St&lt;/data&gt;\n     &lt;data name=3D&quot;age=\r\n&quot;&gt;31&lt;/data&gt;\n   &lt;/item&gt;\n...\n\nGiven I would be using a generic media type ...=\r\n\nHow does the agent know it is a Person type?\nHow does the agent know what =\r\n&quot;name&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, or &quot;age&quot; mean?\n\nWould I provide a namespace to the schem=\r\na describing this entity?  A\nlink relation?  I don&#39;t want to create &quot;Object=\r\n-Based Media Type ROT&quot; by\ncreating &quot;application/myperson+xml&quot;.  I feel like=\r\n I am missing something\nhere.
