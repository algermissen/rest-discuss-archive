I asked the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; question to determine the affected scope in hopes of identifying\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alternate methods to address the real concerns.  But if I am only\n&gt;&gt;&gt; allowed to view as an abstraction, I won&#39;t be able to consider\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tangible alternate solutions.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Could you elaborate on those &quot;benefits to have multiple\n&gt;&gt; URL&#39;s&quot;? I&#39;m curious what they are.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can give you one easy example, but the other I&#39;m still  \n&gt; researching and\n&gt; will require more background. I plan to cover them on the WDUI Blog \n&gt; [1] when\n&gt; I have the research complete and I have published enough pre-requisite\n&gt; material.\n&gt;\n&gt; But in a nutshell, for the one example the benefits are URL  \n&gt; structure that\n&gt; models the website&#39;s structure and contributing to a more usable  \n&gt; website and\n&gt; more directly usable URL structure.  Hierarchies are wonder  \n&gt; structuring\n&gt; mechanisms for helping humans conceptualize and navigate complex  \n&gt; and/or\n&gt; large amounts of information. However, there are few true  \n&gt; hierarchies; most\n&gt; are just presented as hierarchies to help humans conceptualize.  \n&gt; Heirachy&#39;s\n&gt; can provide websites with a useful organizational structure along with\n&gt; easy-to-navigate URLs so users can see the URLs as they navigate,  \n&gt; and hack\n&gt; to go up and guess to go down or across. Multiple URLs are needed  \n&gt; to reach\n&gt; the same location with the only difference at the root node being the\n&gt; breadcrumbs.\n&gt;\nI think I understand. Design is about making tradeoffs, and there are  \nseveral of them here. First of all, as I think you&#39;ve pointed out you  \ncould have all of your various hierarchies to navigate down, but at  \nthe end when you get to the endpoint, you could redirect to a  \ncanonical form. If you don&#39;t have canonical URIs, then you need not  \njolt the user by that redirect at the end, which may be a usability  \nplus, but you may make it harder to find the page via search engines,  \nwhich is a usability minus (and probably a business minus for your  \nwebsite).  It is also a caching minus, because the cache won&#39;t know  \nit already has something that came via a different URI. That can be a  \nusability minus in the form of slower perceived response time, and a  \nbusiness minus in terms of higher bandwidth costs. As a result, I&#39;d  \nprobably lean towards having canonical URIs.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
