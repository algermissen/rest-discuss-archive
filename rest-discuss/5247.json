I want my friend\nJim to have your email address, so I forward him the last mail you sent me.\nUnfortunately that mail contains the ViewCVS url with the crown jewels. If\nthe resource were protected by username/password, Jim could not access it.\nAs a resource owner, I would want to at least require a deliberate,\nmalicious action, to compromise my resource -- not a casual one, like\ncopying a link.\n\n\nI appreciate the simplicity of this scheme, and it&#39;s probably appropriate\nwhere the crown jewels aren&#39;t involved!\n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
