If you need to make\nthat sort of change I think a new media type would be in order.  That\nway the server can continue to provide both varieties of\nrepresentations.  Or it can explicitly inform the client that it no\nlonger supports the older variety via a 406 (Not Acceptable) response.\n\n&gt; I was wondering if there are good guidelines/tools my clients can use so\n&gt; that it can handle that type of change. I was looking recently at WADL and\n&gt; it does offer a good solution to changing URLs and request parameters. I was\n&gt; wondering if there is a good tool to anticipate changing representations as\n&gt; well.\n\nUsing XPath or JSONPath (or any approach that will similarly ignore\nany non-required parts of the representations) to extract the needed\ndata will insulate the client from many of the common ways\nrepresentations evolve.  But even that will require the server side\ndevelopers be disciplined enough not to introduce breaking changes in\nexisting media types.\n\nClients should be resilient to the addition of new information to\nrepresentations.  But there is not much a client can do if the server\nis going to suddenly remove, or change the way it encodes, existing\ninformation.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
