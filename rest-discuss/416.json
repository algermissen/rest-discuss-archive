I think not.\n\n&gt; There is a whole section in the\n&gt; RFC on Retry.  HTTP does not define a retry\n&gt; policy.\n\nIt *doesn&#39;t have to.*  And btw, RFC821 *does not contain the word &quot;retry&quot; **AT ALL.***  RFC1869,\nthe service extensions, doesn&#39;t either.  Get your facts straight.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure.  I bought into the zen of loose\n&gt; coupling in REST.  I am hoping you will see the\n&gt; bonus in asynch.  I think the two are very\n&gt; complimentary.\n\nDude!  You don&#39;t have to sell me on asynch, I&#39;m totally sold --- over five years ago I was trying\nto explain to everybody that would listen that global-scale event notifications were indeed the\nnext big thing.  That was the WHOLE PREMISE behind my last company, Activerse!  (Lesson learned:\nsell applications, not infrastructure.)  What you&#39;re failing to sell me on is the idea that HTTP\napplications don&#39;t need to communicate asynchronously (in-the-large, i.e. in a macro sense) over\nHTTP.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
