Now, suppose we&#39;re not happy with RPC and\n&gt; &gt; want to move to a more &quot;loosely coupled, document oriented&quot; style.  What\n&gt; &gt; do we do?  We simply remove the requirement that the &quot;query&quot; operation\n&gt; &gt; appear in the request message.  Voila, instant loosely coupled service!\n&gt; &gt; Right?  I claim not, since in removing the operation from the message,\n&gt; &gt; the connector semantics - &quot;query&quot; in this case - have not changed!!\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, despite this looking very much like state transfer because\n&gt; &gt; &quot;on the wire&quot; it&#39;s just document in, document out, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s just\n&gt; &gt; non self-descriptive RPC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark,\n&gt; \n&gt; ah, I see what you are driving at. You mean that *any* RPC method could that\n&gt; way be stuffed into POST and that we would (somehow hidden) reintroduce\n&gt; non-uniformity to the interface.\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt; Something to consider: you can do this only once per resource (because any\n&gt; resource only has a single POST method), which, in a sense, binds the\n&gt; POST specialization to the particular resource (or resource type if you\n&gt; consider RDFForms). I am not sure how relevant this is, but I think it\n&gt; has somethng to do with the expectation a client can make not only\n&gt; about the POST invocation but about the combination about the resource(type)\n&gt; and the POST invocation. \n\nBingo.  That&#39;s exactly how I see it.\n\nI&#39;m still prepared to be shown the light by Roy, since, well, he&#39;s da\nman.  But unlike in our previous exchanges, this time I did my homework.\n8-)\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
