If you are going to change a bunch of values \nthen you should do that in a batch rather than sending just the email \naddress and then just the person&#39;s name and then, etc.\n\nBut if ALL you want to do is change the email address, I see nothing \nwrong with doing that.\n\n&gt; ... The SOAP people \n&gt; are just discovering this [see \n&gt; http://www.fawcette.com/xmlmag/2002_06/magazine/departments/endtag/] \n&gt; but it&#39;s one of the fundamental tenets of REST.\n\nThanks for sending this on. I just wrote about it on my intermittently \nmaintained Weblog:\n\nhttp://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1032124150\n\n&gt; ... \n&gt; Also, as a last note, there&#39;s nothing that says the user has to \n&gt; upload the entire resource when using PUT or that the server is not \n&gt; allowed to perform processing on the PUT entity body. The server \n&gt; still has final say over what is actually PUT&#39;ed to the URL.\n\nI believe there is some debate on this issue. It could stand \nclarification in a future version of HTTP or something like that.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
