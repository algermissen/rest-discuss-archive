There&#39;s nothing wrong with defining a resource\nwhich is personalized based on authentication credentials.  Whatever\nURI you map to this resource must always map to this resource, IOW its\nmeaning must not change over time.  Forget HTTP for a minute...\n\nImagine a resource defined as &quot;your local weather forecast&quot; based on\nprotocol-layer geolocation.  The resource itself is dynamic, but the\nmapping to its URI isn&#39;t -- the URI always means the same thing, even\nthough the content is constantly updated, and different users get\ndifferent results (imagine loading that resource in a mobile device\nwhile driving cross-country).\n\nThose results may vary even further by login credentials, imagine the\nlocal weather service with different payment plans where premium users\nget more of something.  I could mint like a gazillion URIs to account\nfor all that, or I could inform intermediaries of what&#39;s going on.  In\nHTTP with experimental geolocation support, the header which makes it\nrun off of one URI would be &quot;Vary: Authorization, Geolocation&quot;.\n\nUnauthenticated, or basic service level customers, receive publicly-\ncached representations; premium users get a cacheable redirect to their\naccount (OK, more than one URI, but not infinitely more), which is\nprivately cacheable and issues an authentication challenge.  If a\npremium user isn&#39;t logged in, they&#39;ll get the basic service.  If they\nare logged in, they&#39;ll still load the same publicly-cached data as any\nuser in the same area.\n\nAny way you slice it, every user is retrieving a representation of the\nsame resource.  Regardless of the dissimilarities in content, they&#39;re\nstill equivalents, since every user gets exactly what they expect and\nwhat they paid for when they dereference the URI -- the local weather\nforecast for their current location.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking of a use case in this example where user1 may be given\n&gt; access to the tasks of user2. In that case, the server can provide a\n&gt; link to user1 that may look like this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;user2tasks&quot; href=&quot;/users/2/tasks&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it still possible to design this scenario without having a unique\n&gt; URI to identify a users task collection resource?\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;ve fallen right into the trap of thinking about REST in terms of URI\nallocation-scheme design.  By first deciding to personalize the URLs\ninstead of personalizing the representations, you now have a problem\nyou wouldn&#39;t have otherwise had.  Design in terms of resources, *then*\nassign URIs to those resources.  Most importantly, think of auth as a\nserver configuration problem, not a hypertext problem...\n\nYou&#39;re saying you have a resource, and you want to restrict access to a\ngroup containing two users.  My response is, why are you trying to do\nthis with URIs and hypertext?  Use the protocol layer, and you will\nhave the flexibility to redefine users/groups/privileges on a whim,\nwithout changing anyone&#39;s login, or having to cache-expire the hypertext\nto push new links and URIs out to clients (or set up redirects for the\nnow-obsolete API).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
