It\n&gt;&gt; simply stores a way to reference the back end cart which can be\n&gt;&gt; accessed with the HTTP verbs.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; One could argue that a cart /is/ a session.  In fact, for a shopping \n&gt; application, that&#39;s pretty much what I consider the session to consist \n&gt; of.  Therefore, the reference to the back end cart is a session key.\n\nOne could only argue that by changing the semantics of the words.\n\nThe cart is not a session it&#39;s a resource storing state. Otherwise\nevery thing that stores state is a session.\n\nA session is an object (normally) subsidiary to authentication details\nthat exists orthogonal to resources in a webapp.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; But that wouldn&#39;t change the cacheability of any of the resources\n&gt;&gt; either (even though the cookie would be different for every person\n&gt;&gt; requesting all the resources) because only the client side would read\n&gt;&gt; the cookie. In effect the cookie wouldn&#39;t need to be communicated to\n&gt;&gt; the server at all because the server wouldn&#39;t be using it.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Interesting.  Use a cookie completely on the client side.  Don&#39;t send it \n&gt; to the server.  I like that.  But I do wonder how to gracefully degrade \n&gt; on clients without JavaScript.\n\nAye. That is difficult.\n\nBut even the text based browsers are getting javascript these days.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
