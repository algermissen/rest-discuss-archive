Authorization is a domain problem, not necessarily an\narchitectural (at the level that REST is sitting at least) issue.\n\nThe only real area where there is any potential crossover is simply\nthat two clients may well get two different representations for the\nsame resource. For example, the Purchaser of a product might be able\nto see item, quantity and price on a Order, but a Shipper, may well\nsimply be able to see item and quantity.\n\nBut as long as the roles are consistent, this isn&#39;t a problem. There&#39;s\nnothing wrong with a Shipper having &quot;read only&quot;, and a &quot;limited&quot; view\nof a resource compared to another role.\n\nYou can see, though, that a REST system is pretty much ambivalent to\nthe roles and their effects, and beyond being able to identify users,\nactual processing and limitations of roles are done at the domain\nlevel.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
