All that said, I think the presentation\n&gt; does a nice job of describing REST&#39;s real benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; -peter keane\n&gt; daseproject.org\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 5 Nov 2007, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; I recently presented on REST vs. SOA at a BeJUG (Belgian Java User\n&gt;  &gt; Group) event - I&#39;d appreciate your comments/corrections:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/11/04/rest_talk_at_bejug_video.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/11/04/rest_talk_at_bejug_video.html&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Slides are available online, too:\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/10/09/rest_vs_soa_presentation.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/10/09/rest_vs_soa_presentation.html&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Stefan\n&gt;  &gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
