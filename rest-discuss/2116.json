Also, SOAP&#39;s message model allows me to qualify queries \n&gt; through use of transport-neutral headers. For example, I may not have \n&gt; HTTP-based access to your machine, yet I may still want to send a \n&gt; SOAP request (over Jabber perhaps) that queries something on your \n&gt; box. By adopting the SOAP messaging model, I can express any number \n&gt; of aspects of my query (e.g., signatures, privacy requirements, \n&gt; idempotency, cache control) using fairly rich XML-based \n&gt; headers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this true? I don&#39;t see anything in the spec which says that a HTTP \n&gt; GET request is not allowed to have an entity body (and therefore \n&gt; contain XML documents or anything).\n\nIt&#39;s a feature, not a bug, that identifying information should go in\nthe URI.  There&#39;s a large cost for not doing so, in that you can&#39;t hand\nthe identifier around to other people.\n\nSo while it might be cool to use XML like this to identify me;\n\n  &lt;person&gt;Mark Baker&lt;/person&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s no deployed way to actually turn that into information about me\nover a network.
