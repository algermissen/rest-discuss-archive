Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt;\r\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Google proposes RPC style APIs over REST\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=266460716\r\n\r\n&quot;Peter&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; XHTML+RDFa is a real rabbit hole (for RESTful systems specifically)\n&gt; as far as I am concerned -- that&#39;s not the way we&#39;ll build the\n&gt; RESTful web out (same goes for RDF).  HTML5 as a move *away* from XML\n&gt; is significant (I realize there is a serialization in XHTML, but\n&gt; that&#39;s an also-ran).\n&gt;\n\nIt is a shame that HTML5 is speccing imperative solutions to problems\nthat XSLT solves with declarative code; that all the major browsers\nfinally, as of this year, handle XSLT 1 competently seems to have\nhappened despite themselves.  Had this state of affairs come about\nearlier, the HTML5 conversation would be totally different; as it is, I\nwish it would slow down and consider the advantages of hypertext over\nblackbox code.\n\nRegardless of serialization, HTML5 won&#39;t be changing my architectural\npattern one whit.  XSLT support in browsers isn&#39;t going away any time\nsoon.  When the time comes, I don&#39;t even need to change the logic\nwithin the XSLT, only the actual output markup.  Same goes with\nsupporting mobile devices, client or server can generate some sort of\ntiny app with XSLT, in fact Xforms has come out of nowhere to start\nlooking like a viable mobile markup, and I&#39;m a big fan of Xforms.\n\nI don&#39;t see REST becoming less relevant as mobile proliferates or the\nWeb evolves towards being more m2m.  I guess I&#39;ll keep talking until\nI&#39;m blue in the face about it, but there&#39;s no sweeter way to\ncommunicate a distributed interface to a human than Xforms, which of\ncourse is perfectly viable as an m2m format (in an XML world), and the\nhypertext constraint is all about communicating a Uniform Interface to\nboth, which I see as an absolute necessity -- humans will (hopefully)\nalways develop and maintain the code.\n\n(Although I note that Asimov&#39;s First Law of Robotics was the first one\nto go down to &quot;pragmatism,&quot; as robotics nowadays is driven not by the\nmanufacturing sector, but by the human-killing sector.  We ought to\nknow better than to let them network, but as long as it&#39;s inevitable we\nshould give them human-readable interfaces, rather than binary ones, so\nthey can&#39;t lock us out for our own &quot;protection&quot;...)\n\nXHTML+RDFa is the most viable answer at the present time.  At such time\nas something better comes along, ditching the old in favor of the new\non my system involves editing some XSLT, then modernizing the CSS/JS to\nkeep up with the new markup.  REST is a long-term solution; in this\ninstance, keeping up with the future is precisely the goal of my use of\nREST.  Not that I&#39;m planning on it for a really long time, but the\nbackend data format is just as decoupled and easy to replace, without\nneeding to re-think the architecture, as the front-end data format.\n\nSo we&#39;ll see.  I hope my business partner doesn&#39;t read your post.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
