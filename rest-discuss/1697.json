A big=\r\n beast.\n\n\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t include IIOP (from Corba) or RMI (from Java) - \n&gt; op=\r\ntional & usually available but not required in J2EE.\n\nYep, but the interop =\r\nstandard for EJB is RMI-IIOP, not RMI; historically\nthat was invented to ke=\r\nep the CORBA crowd happy. And it&#39;s essence is\nsynchronous, RPC and pass by =\r\nvalue. I honestly don&#39;t know how well the\nstubs and skeletons thing fits wi=\r\nth REST, but otherwise RMI-IIOP doesn&#39;t\nstrike me as a RESTful protocol.\n\n =\r\n\n&gt; JAAS is probably just as \n&gt; core - I just don&#39;t happen to have any exper=\r\nience with it.\n\nJAAS looks nice, it does much the same for authentication a=\r\nnd\nauthorization that JNDI does for directories and JDBC does for\ndatasourc=\r\nes. Clients can declare controls impendent of implementations.\nI wanted to =\r\nuse it an upcoming project, but I didn&#39;t think there was\ntime for me to pic=\r\nk it up properly.\n\nBill de h=D3ra\n\n..\nPropylon\nwww.propylon.com \n\n  \n\n\n\n"}}
