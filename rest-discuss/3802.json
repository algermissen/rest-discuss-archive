Somehow, &quot;API&quot; doesn&#39;t seem right.  I would\n&gt; &gt; think something like\n&gt;\n&gt; An API provides an interface without which the code/library/service cannot\n&gt; be used. However a RESTful interface uses hypertext as the engine of\n&gt; application state (so the set of possible transitions is documented in the\n&gt; instance data, not in some external interface definition) with a small set\n&gt; of known verbs. So it seems to me that no such term is necessary, aside\n&gt; from &quot;RESTful interface&quot; (RI?).\n\nBut the document schemas are a prerequisite.

Perhaps the\nreplacement for API is AL (Application Language).\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
