I\nunderstand JSR as a means to standardiz=\r\ne something existent into the\nJava platform. But there is no ecosystem of c=\r\nompeting\nsoftware-that-lends-to-the-REST-architectural-style-TM in Java in =\r\nthe\nfirst place. These guys should open a java.net project, gain some\npopul=\r\narity and come back in two years.\n\nAlas, real damage will happen when someo=\r\nne tries to include this into\nJ2SE. JSRs as such do not necessarily mean to=\r\no much.\n\nJerome Louvel is slated to go on the EG and - to my recollection -=\r\n is\nthe only one who&#39;s building a REST-oriented framework in Java and who\nI=\r\n&#39;ve seen active in this community. Jerome, maybe you can comment.\n\nWill sen=\r\nd similar comments to that address.\n\nThanks for bringing this up\nMatthias\n\n=\r\n-- \nmatthias.ernst@...\nsoftware architect\n+49.40.32 55 87.503\n \n\n=\r\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailt=\r\no:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Elliotte Harold\n&gt; Sent: Wednes=\r\nday, February 14, 2007 3:56 PM\n&gt; To: REST Discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss]=\r\n Sun proposes to apply Web service \n&gt; standardization principles to REST\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It had to happen sooner or later. The big boys are waking up and \n&gt; disc=\r\novering REST, and naturally they want to protect all us little \n&gt; developer=\r\ns from worrying our pretty little heads about nasty \n&gt; things like \n&gt; HTTP =\r\nand XML by creating easy-to-use REST frameworks:\n&gt; \n&gt; JSR-311 Java API for =\r\nRESTful Web Services\n&gt; http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=3D311\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember,=\r\n these are the same jokers who gave us servlets and the \n&gt; URLConnection cl=\r\nass as well as gems like JAX-RPC and JAX-WS. \n&gt; They still \n&gt; seem to belie=\r\nve that these are actually good specs, and they are \n&gt; proposing to tunnel =\r\nREST services through JAX-WS (Java API \n&gt; for XML Web \n&gt; Services) endpoint=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also seem to believe that &quot;building RESTful Web services \n&gt; us=\r\ning the \n&gt; Java Platform is significantly more complex than building SOAP-b=\r\nased \n&gt; services&quot;. I don&#39;t know that this is false, but  if it&#39;s true \n&gt; it=\r\n&#39;s only \n&gt; because Sun&#39;s HTTP API were designed by architecture astronauts =\r\nwho \n&gt; didn&#39;t actually understand HTTP. This proposal does not seem to be \n=\r\n&gt; addressing the need for a decent HTTP API on either the \n&gt; client or serv=\r\ner \n&gt; side that actually follows RESTful principles instead of fighting \n&gt; =\r\nagainst them.\n&gt; \n&gt; To give you an idea of the background we&#39;re dealing with=\r\n here, one of \n&gt; the two people who wrote the proposal &quot;represents Sun on t=\r\nhe W3C XML \n&gt; Protocol and W3C WS-Addressing working groups where he is \n&gt; =\r\nco-editor of \n&gt; the SOAP 1.2 and WS-Addressing 1.0 specifications. Marc was=\r\n \n&gt; co-specification lead for JAX-WS 2.0 (the Java API for Web Services) \n&gt;=\r\n developed at the JCP and has also served as Sun&#39;s technical lead and \n&gt; al=\r\nternate board member at the Web Services Interoperability \n&gt; Organization \n=\r\n&gt; (WS-I).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The other submitter seems to be a primary instigator of the=\r\n \n&gt; Fast Infoset \n&gt; effort to hide XML in binary goop.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like as=\r\nking Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic \n&gt; Party platform.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Do we really want to trust these folks to define the official \n&gt; Java s=\r\npec \n&gt; for REST? Please read the JSR, and send comments to \n&gt; jsr-311-comme=\r\nnts@...\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope we can derail this completely, but we probably can&#39;=\r\nt. \n&gt; If not, are \n&gt; there any JSR members here who might join the working =\r\ngroup and bring \n&gt; some sanity and actual REST experience to the developmen=\r\nt of the \n&gt; eventual specification? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we can at \n&gt;=\r\n least limit \n&gt; the damage.\n\n"}}
