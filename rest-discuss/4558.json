But no, I have the same\nissue with either, a) expecting the query results in the POST response,\nand b) expecting the query results in a GET on the returned Location\nURI.  The issue is not the mechanism, it&#39;s the additional expectation,\nsince it&#39;s not one that can be met by other resources and therefore\nneither uniform nor RESTful.  Said another way, I couldn&#39;t POST a query\ndocument to any old resource and expect it to understand that I expect\nback the results, nor could I assume that anything I got back from an\narbitrary resource was the results of the query document being processed\nas a query.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
