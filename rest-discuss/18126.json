The\n&gt;&gt; importance of media types (data!) is evidence of this vital aspect of\n&gt;&gt; implementing distributed systems.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Many developers I encounter continue to focus primarily on the\n&gt;&gt; components of the system rather than the data passed between them. It\n&gt;&gt; is understandable since most education, software tooling, and\n&gt;&gt; valuation within the developer community continues to place components\n&gt;&gt; above the data these components process.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. It also echoes one of the rules stated in the Basics of unix\n&gt; philosophy as stated by Eric S. Raymond:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can\n&gt; be stupid and robust\n&gt; (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2878263).\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think that media types are very central to REST. But one\n&gt; problem today is that, apart from XHTML and Atom, there are few\n&gt; *general* and data-oriented mediatypes with good hyperlink support.\n&gt; There are some interesting efforts that have been mentioned on this\n&gt; mailing list, but it seems many are looking for a JSON-based or\n&gt; JSON-style alternative to XHTML and Atom.\n&gt;\n&gt; Today a colleague of mine and I discussed an approach where JSON could\n&gt; be syntactically be extended with a new value &quot;hyperlink&quot; with support\n&gt; for the basic hyperlink attributes (href, type, method and rel).\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time, the last thing we need is an overproliferation of\n&gt; overspecified and custom mediatypes.
