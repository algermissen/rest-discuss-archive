Here you are using it to specify \n&gt; a different resource, which is the purpose of the URL, not the Accept \n&gt; header.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose you could argue that an icon is a representation of your \n&gt; site, and so is the home page.  But that would be a tenuous \n&gt; comparison.  I could see using it to deliver a .wml version of your \n&gt; page, or a .pdf version, or maybe even a .png image of the page.  But \n&gt; an icon does not contain the same information.\nSure it does.  It&#39;s just that icons hold a very limited amount of \ninformation, so you tend to condense your meaning a bit more.  Just \nbecause it can&#39;t hold the same amount of detail does not mean its not \nthe same information.\n&gt; Suppose you had two icons for your site - one of which was supposed to \n&gt; be used in the address bar, the other in the bookmark list.  How would \n&gt; you distinguish between them?  Or suppose someone wanted a .png \n&gt; representation of your icon, instead of the .ico representation?  \n&gt; Normally they&#39;d use the Accept header to specify, but if the Accept \n&gt; header must be .ico, there&#39;s no room for using it to indicate I want a \n&gt; .png.\nYou are arguing that content negotiation fails because you want to use \nit to dictate how the returned representation will be used on the client \nsystem.  I don&#39;t think anyone has argued that content negotiation is a \nsolution for that problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I fail to see how a .p3p file could possibly be a representation \n&gt; of your site.  It&#39;s a policy - a separate resource from the site, or \n&gt; the home page.  It&#39;s an extreme stretch of the Accept header to use it \n&gt; in this way.\nIt may or may not be.  The policy is a site policy.  The robots.txt file \nis a policy as well.  Again, it&#39;s a site policy.  If someone wants to \nknow my site, these are just as much my &quot;site&quot; as an html response is.\n\nSeairth\n\r\n--------------090607090407020904080800\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\nLyle Kopnicky wrote:\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid4421A9F8.5070503@...&quot; type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\nNic wrote:\n  &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid87acbimgq2.fsf@...&quot; type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;One way to handle this is by embedding a link in each HTML page to point \nto the appropriate favicon.ico, just like we&#39;d link to an external \nstylesheet.  \n    &lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;!----&gt;\nThough one could just as easily say that a request:\n\n  GET &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n  accept: icon\n  &lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\nIt seems to me the Accept header is meant to allow for an alternate\nrepresentation of the same resource.&nbsp; Here you are using it to specify\na different resource, which is the purpose of the URL, not the Accept\nheader.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nI suppose you could argue that an icon is a representation of your\nsite, and so is the home page.&nbsp; But that would be a tenuous\ncomparison.&nbsp; I could see using it to deliver a .wml version of your\npage, or a .pdf version, or maybe even a .png image of the page.&nbsp; But\nan icon does not contain the same information.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nSure it does.&nbsp; It&#39;s just that icons hold a very limited amount of\ninformation, so you tend to condense your meaning a bit more.&nbsp; Just\nbecause it can&#39;t hold the same amount of detail does not mean its not\nthe same information.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid4421A9F8.5070503@...&quot; type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;Suppose\nyou had two icons for your site - one of which was supposed to\nbe used in the address bar, the other in the bookmark list.&nbsp; How would\nyou distinguish between them?&nbsp; Or suppose someone wanted a .png\nrepresentation of your icon, instead of the .ico representation?&nbsp;\nNormally they&#39;d use the Accept header to specify, but if the Accept\nheader must be .ico, there&#39;s no room for using it to indicate I want a\n.png.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nYou are arguing that content negotiation fails because you want to use\nit to dictate how the returned representation will be used on the\nclient system.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think anyone has argued that content\nnegotiation is a solution for that problem.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid4421A9F8.5070503@...&quot; type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, I fail to see how a .p3p file could possibly be a representation\nof your site.&nbsp; It&#39;s a policy - a separate resource from the site, or\nthe home page.&nbsp; It&#39;s an extreme stretch of the Accept header to use it\nin this way.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nIt may or may not be.&nbsp; The policy is a site policy.&nbsp; The robots.txt\nfile is a policy as well.&nbsp; Again, it&#39;s a site policy.&nbsp; If someone wants\nto know my site, these are just as much my &quot;site&quot; as an html response\nis.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSeairth&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------090607090407020904080800--\r\n\n"}}
