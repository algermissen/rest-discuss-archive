One should not mess with an OGC spec,\nand here I&#39;m using\nWMS as an example to solicit opinions on how to\ntransform like\ninterfaces to RESTful ones if possible. \n\nThe Web Mapping Services and Web Features Services of\nOGC will probably\nremain what they are for some time, but from the\nRequest for Technology\nof OWS2 on opengis.net, they&#39;re also exploring the\nbenefits of REST\narchtectures. As I have similar research interests,\nI&#39;d like to know\nwhether there are more improvements to the above\ninterface to make it\nrestful.\n\nIn a word, my question can be shortened to: is it\nrestful to use URLs\nconsisting of heaps of Key-Value Pairs? Josh&#39;s\nsuggestion of using\nhypermedia has actually been implemented by WMS\nclients. In addition, if\nmy memory serves me right, OGC&#39;s Web Mapping Service\nalso allow an XML\nencoding of request parameters, and the WMS client\ncomposes an xml file\nand send it to the WMS server using POST, which is\ndefinately not REST\nIMHO. In the xml encoding case, can one make it\nrestful? \n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nJoseph H. Yao\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nCheck out the new Yahoo!
