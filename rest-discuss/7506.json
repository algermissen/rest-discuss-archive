As long as things\n&gt; are explicitly defined (by spec, by the server, or otherwise), agents\n&gt; can and do make use of information embedded in the URI.\n\nThat&#39;s problematic if the place it is explicitly defined is somewhere \nother than the hypermedia the client has received.\n\nThat said, I see nothing wrong in making guesswork on the part of a user \nmore likely to work as they expect. Guesswork is a way that humans will \nalways try to explore something and it&#39;s good UI to react to such \nguesses in a way they would expect.\n\nIt&#39;s a foolish user though that can&#39;t tell the difference between a \nguess they tried and &quot;the way things are meant to be&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
