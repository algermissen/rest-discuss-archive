Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m still confused. I fail to see how you can claim idempotence with\n&gt;  &gt;this setup. I think that&#39;s what all this comes down to. In the system\n&gt;  &gt;you are describing, 2 deletes to the exact same resource URI do two\n&gt;  &gt;different things.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&quot;Methods can also have the property of &quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside\n&gt;  &gt; from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical\n&gt;  &gt; requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,\n&gt;  &gt; PUT and DELETE share this property.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;In the end you don&#39;t have to listen to anyone. You are free to do as\n&gt;  &gt;you wish. Obviously there are those that disagree with your view of\n&gt;  &gt;things. It is of course your prerogative to decide who is in error.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no problem discussing the issue, within the confines of my own\n&gt; example. I see your point, but I define &quot;identical request&quot; to mean\n&gt; a combination of factors being identical. For instance, issuing a\n&gt; DELETE request to one of my 410 Gone resources will result in a 400\n\n...I&#39;d make that more specific, such as 409 or 403...\n\n&gt; Bad Request result every single time that identical request is\n&gt; repeated. However, if you add a conditional If-Match to that DELETE\n&gt; request, in other words after you&#39;ve *modified* the request from before,\n&gt; you get a different result.\n\nHmm, are you saying that you allow the DELETE on the &quot;gone&quot; resource to \nsucceed if it carries an If-Match? That seems to be a weird approach, as \nthe 404/410 condition indicates &quot;nothing is there&quot;, so any kind of \nIf-Match IMHO should cause a 412 on that resource.\n\n &gt; ..\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
