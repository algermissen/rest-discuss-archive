Any \n&gt;*thing*,  period, can have an identifier\n\nThis is a meaningless statement. As soon as you&#39;ve stated **that \nthing** you&#39;ve identified it. \n\nWhat you might be asking is whether there are concepts and \nabstractions which cannot be universally and uniquely addressed. \nMost likely there are. For example, it makes sense for a specific \nperson to have a URI but you can&#39;t really assign a URI to the \nconcept of &#39;people&#39;. (And if you do, it&#39;s guaranteed not everybody \nwill agree that your URI addresses the &#39;people&#39; resource since \neverybody has different notions of what the &#39;people&#39; resource might \nconstitute). Or can you assign URIs to emotions like &#39;happy&#39; \nand &#39;jealous&#39;? Again you can, but these URIs no longer have the same \nedge of universality as a URI that addresses yahoo&#39;s webpage or your \nmailbox.\n\nThe point is resources aren&#39;t meant to be super-historical entities \nthough there are many people who believe such super-historical \nentities exist. The word &#39;identity&#39; implies a certain physicality \nand concreteness which jives well with REST because ultimately it \ncomes down to executing methods against objects that exist on a \nnetwork. \n\nAnyways I doubt anybody is really mislead by the &quot;with identity&quot; \npart unless they&#39;ve already worked into a confusing, never-ending \nspiral of tautology and assumption while trying to decide what \nconstitutes a resource.\n\n- itdp\n\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Miles Sabin &lt;miles@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mark Baker wrote,\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Sep 09, 2002 at 05:38:04PM +0100, Miles Sabin wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Baker wrote,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Sep 09, 2002 at 08:47:13AM +0100, Miles Sabin wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * If having a URI isn&#39;t the criterion of resource-hood, \nthen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is?

But of course, anything \nwith\n&gt; &gt; identity can have a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, but what&#39;s the point of the the &quot;with identity&quot;? Any \n*thing*, \n&gt; period, can have an identifier: &quot;with identity&quot; is completely \nredundant \n&gt; as you&#39;ve just agreed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The RFC 2396 text is misleading, because it suggests that the \npotential \n&gt; resources are a *proper* subset of the set of things, the proper \nsubset \n&gt; which has identity as opposed to the subset which doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s \nclose \n&gt; to gibberish IMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Miles\n\n\n"}}
