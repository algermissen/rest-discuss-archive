You can&#39;t have one and not the other; they come together.\n&gt; I strongly agree with Roger&#39;s point.\n\nAgain, as I replied to Mike, I think we&#39;re talking about different levels of\nabstraction regarding &quot;nouns&quot; and &quot;verbs&quot;.\n\nAt the protocol level of abstractions, we can say that end points are nouns\nand the protocol is the verb.  At this level, there is no question that a\nsmall well-defined set of verbs will optimize the network effect.\n\nTake the phone system as an example (a prime network effect system).\nTelephony devices are the nouns and there is one main verb - &quot;to call&quot;.\nFrom this perspective, the many-noun-to-few-verbs ratio is desirable.\n\nHowever, from a telephony application perspective, there is no reason to\nprevent people from modeling a telephony end-point as an action.  For\nexample, we &quot;page&quot; a person by calling a pager.  To some people it is a more\nnatural way to think about the actual &quot;action&quot; of paging someone as opposed\nto &quot;calling&quot; a paging device.  I don&#39;t see a problem with abstracting the\nphone number to a &quot;paging&quot; action as opposed to a paging device.\n\nLet&#39;s take a look at the sentence again:\n\n&gt; 3. As a corollary to (2) use nouns in the logical URI, not verbs. \n&gt; Resources are &quot;things&quot; not &quot;actions&quot;.\n\nURIs are like phone numbers - both are universal addressing schemes.  All\nI&#39;m saying is that we shouldn&#39;t arbitrarily discourage people from modeling\n&quot;actions&quot; as resources for those applications that makes sense.\n\nBuying a book is a clearly an action.  You can abstract the URI into a noun\nby calling it a &quot;purchase transaction record&quot;, but to the end user pushing\nthe &quot;buy&quot; button, it is still an action.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
