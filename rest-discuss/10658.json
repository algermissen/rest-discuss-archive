However, in other languages, such as Objective-C,  \nthe instance construction process has two parts: allocation, then  \ninitialization.  I&#39;m personally a fan of the latter as it removes the  \nspecial case of the &quot;constructor&quot; concept.  The less moving parts, the  \nbetter, imho.\n\nNow, for REST services, there is a bit of a problem it appears.\n1) create a new service A\n2) send a initialization message\n3) send regular messages\n\nClearly, this stateful.  If a regular message arrives before the  \ninitialization message (or, gasp, during), things don&#39;t work as  \nexpected.\n\nNow, in case you think this is trivial, let&#39;s assume that during  \ninitialization of service A, other services need to be created and  \nthey need to interact with service A during initialization.  In other  \nwords, service A needs to be reachable before initialization has  \ncompleted.\n\nThoughts?  Thanks.\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
