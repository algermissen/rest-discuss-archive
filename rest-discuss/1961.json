From there I read more on MDA [2], [3] and\nadditional papers by Carlson [4] as well as the OMG&#39;s release of the EDOCS\n(Enterprise Distributed Object Computing) UML profile [5] which, as is\nmentioned below is undergoing a platform specific mapping (PSM) to Web\nServices. This got my interest and I wondered if it might be worth looking\ninto further from the perspective of using a REST approach as a PSM. So\nbefore I get too carried away I thought I would ask for the groups input on \nthis,\nhas anyone with a deeper understanding of MDA/EDOC/etc had thoughts\nalong these lines?\n\nRobert\n\nPS Sometimes I wish Fielding had coined a name other than REST, as it makes\nGoogle searching somewhat more difficult!\n\n[1] http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/sdm0202f/ (registration required) or\nthe Feb, Apr, May Jun 2002 issues of SD\n\n[2] MDA home page - http://www.omg.org/mda\n\n[3] Model Driven Architecture - A Technical Perspective -\nhttp://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ormsc/01-07-01.pdf\n\n[4] http://www.xmlmodeling.com/articles/\n\n[5] http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/02-02-05.pdf (The UML Profile for\nEDOC is used to build PIMs (Platform Independent  Model) of enterprise\napplications. It defines representations for entities, events, process,\nrelationships, patterns, and an Enterprise Collaboration Architecture. As a\nPIM profile, it needs mappings to platform-specific profiles. A mapping to\nWeb Services is underway now; additional mappings will follow. )\n\n\n"}}
