With IDLs, the\ncategories allowed in the PATCH would be listed in a schema, and that\nschema would need to be updated when the list of categories changes.\n\nWhy not just give the current list in-band as part of a hypertext\ncontrol?  IDLs add whole layers of indirection which simply aren&#39;t\nneeded when hypertext controls are used instead.  REST is about\ndeclaring to generic user-agents what state transitions are possible,\nnot what application-specific user-agents may infer from out-of-band\nunderstanding of the application flow.\n\nIOW, I&#39;m turning your question back on you -- I&#39;ve never seen an IDL\nthat can describe the hypertext-driven APIs I write.  That&#39;s my\ncontext, but I try to keep an open mind, so all anyone has to do to\nconvince me that I&#39;m being nonsensical or dogmatic in my opposition to\nIDLs is show me what I&#39;m missing by giving a counter-example of what an\nAPI would look like which allows an Atom Entry to be PUT-edited or\nPATCH-tagged without relying on out-of-band inferences (i.e. rel=&#39;edit&#39;\nmeans PUT, and rel=&#39;some URI&#39; means PATCH) specific to the application\nor the domain (as opposed to generic).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
