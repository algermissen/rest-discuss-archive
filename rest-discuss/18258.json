New elements can be added which do not\nbreak existing clients. In the same way this documentation is\ndescribing the response. As the system evolves that format can evolve\nwithout breaking existing clients.\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\nFrom: Jan Algermissen\nSent: 12/30/2011 1:03 AM\nTo: Glenn Block\nCc: Mike Kelly; Paul Cohen; Erik Mogensen; REST-Discuss Discussion\nGroup; craigmcc@...\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] The &quot;new media types are evil&quot; meme\n\nOn Dec 30, 2011, at 3:35 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; If the link relation is documented / registered, where is the harm if it says in the documentation these are supported media types (not necessarily being the exclusive set) and this is how the data will look for those types?\n\nCoupling. The server might change and send something different than\nyou expect. In order to facilitate fragmented change of system\ncomponents REST deliberately rules out such coupling. If clients and\nservers were coupled around such expectations, how could a server ever\nchange without informing all clients?\n\nConneg is the mechanism that allows for capability negotiation at\nruntime (instead of at design time with the inevitable coupling) and\nbesides that the burden really is on the client to deal with *any*\nresponse in a sensible way. IOW, you cannot expect the server to\nbehave in a certain, application specific way. HTTP *is* the\napplication protocol already.

Incidentally, a capability I&#39;m looking work into HAL is\n&gt; something equivalent to ESI - for that very reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; couple of relevant quotes from the dissertation:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be\n&gt; self-descriptive&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Within REST, intermediary components can actively transform the\n&gt; content of messages because the messages are self-descriptive and\n&gt; their semantics are visible to intermediaries&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n"}}
