Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You make a good point that a PUT or a POST can set an expiration date for\n&gt; a resource, in which case it switches from 2xx to 4xx without a DELETE,\n&gt; but in my case I see no reason to add complexity when I simply want a\n&gt; DELETE to change a resource&#39;s status from 200 to 410.  The debate here is\n&gt; about changing a resource&#39;s status from 410 to 404 using HTTP.\n\nSee, that&#39;s the part that seems weird to me: how can you delete\nsomething that doesn&#39;t exist? Maybe it would help if you explained (or\nrefreshed my memory) what the distinction is.\n\nI&#39;m also not sure the codes are right, the more I look at them.\nDoesn&#39;t 410 imply that the resource once existed, where 404 is more\nvague? If so, then wouldn&#39;t 410 mean &quot;It was definitely here, but all\nI find now is a zero-byte file&quot; where 404 would mean &quot;I can&#39;t find any\ntrace now, or at least none I&#39;m willing to admit to the likes of you&quot;?\n\nAnd re your trashcan parallel: that&#39;s perhaps not a good analogy,\nsince trashcan files are intact in every way except for being flagged\nas deleteable. I&#39;m not sure of the exact details at the filesystem\nlevel, but based on its behavior I&#39;d say that&#39;s more analogous to a\nresource having a &quot;deleted&quot; property (or perhaps a &quot;trashcan&quot;\nlocation, with its original location still stored somehow&quot;) but for\nwhich HTTP (the &quot;filesystem&quot; level) replies with a 2xx-level response\n(since you can, in Windows at least, muck about with files in the\ntrashcan to a certain level), and your client (a la Windows (not\nInternet) Explorer) simply agrees that that location is &quot;special.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t know if that&#39;s applicable to your situation, but that&#39;s how\nI&#39;d do a two-step delete (the PUT and DELETE I mentioned initially).\n\n"}}
