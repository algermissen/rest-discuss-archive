But preferring \n&gt; HTTP link headers over links in your hypermedia format seems backwards \n&gt; to me. It goes against the established practice of the Web doesn&#39;t it?\n\nI don&#39;t think the link header &#39;goes against&#39; HTTP. It is an extension, \nthough.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Pulling the links out of the hypermedia and into the protocol headers \n&gt; makes it harder to use your hypermedia format with other protocols and \n&gt; is in conflict with some of the design principles of the web, \n&gt; exemplified by URI, no?\n&gt; \n\nAs above,I don&#39;t think the link header is in conflict with HTTP or URI.\n\nIf the link header is used to represent relationships from one resource \nto another, this should make messages more self descriptive which in \nturn makes layering (i.e. intermediaries) more powerful. That&#39;s a good \nthing for RESTful HTTP, I think.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
