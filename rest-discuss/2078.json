I know now that this can be\n&gt; problematic when doing application resource modelling.\n\nAgreed.  That&#39;s exactly the trap I was trying not to fall into.  Luckily \nwe moved away from queues just recently.  The Client now pull exactly \nthe data they need.\n\n\n&gt; You state that the problem with sending events separately is &quot;since then I\n&gt; can&#39;t always know the two events are related.&quot;\n&gt; How do you know the events are related anyway? Model that as a resource and\n&gt; you may make some progress.\n\nYes, and I think we finally modeled it as a resource.  That was the \nhardest part: taking two resources that were well known, whose state \nchanges we are interested in, and asking &quot;What is the resource that \nresults from this change?&quot;  It&#39;s an odd looking resource because it ties \ntogether two other resources, but it can stand on its own.  Because of \nthis we think it works well.\n\nI&#39;d love to post a synopsis once we finalize our spec.\n\nThanks for your help!\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
