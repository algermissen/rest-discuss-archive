It is really not doing things  \nright, I think.\n\nHere are some of the faults I found with it (see comment in [1]):\n\n(1) It ties the identity provider to the identity. The nice thing  \nabout OpenId, is that it separates the role of the identity provider  \nand the identity. This allows one to have an id (I could use http:// \nbblfish.net/) and change identity provider over time, as I change job  \nfor example, or even have a number of different ones at the same  \ntime. The OpenId attribute exchange is overloading the identity  \nprovider (which is really an identity verifier) functionality  \nrelating to identity description.\n\n(2) It does not feel RESTful. If something is to return information  \nit should have a URL. Here there is very clearly overlapping of  \nconcerns as explained above. What is the url for information for one  \nidentity here? I have a large alarm bell ringing when I read sections  \nsuch as: &quot;Fetch message&quot; and &quot;store message&quot;. Is that not the  \nequivalent of HTTP GET and PUT?\n\n(3) duplicating effort. This spec is inventing a metadata format, a  \nquery language and storage API, which is a lot of work. These things  \nhave been done before:\n\n    -a- metadata framework: as shown above RDF does this very well  \nalready. It has a very powerful semantics, has gone through years of  \nreview by some of the best thinkers in the world, is extensible, self  \ndescribing, etc, etc... having to learn another special  convention  \nas proposed here, is one more unnecessary piece of work.\n\n    -b- query language: SPARQL though not yet finished does  \neverything that is needed here as shown in the example given at [1]\n\n    -c- storage: this could be done using a number of well known  \ntechnologies, such as ftp, scp, Atom Protocol, or even WebDav. AtomP  \nand WebDav are even nicely RESTful.\n\nIt kind of shows I think how one has to be careful not to accept the  \nwork of one group as good of the bat, just because they did excellent  \nwork before hand. Am I being unjust?\n\nHenry\n\nPS.  Now criticism (1) above is a little tricky perhaps because if  \nthe Identity Provider has no say\nover the OpenId resource, and that is used to point to personal  \ninformation, then the open id could be describing itself in ways that  \nwould be completely unacceptable to the organisation controlling the  \nIdentity Provider. So there may be a good reason to have it have some  \ncontrol over the OpenId, or  for one to want to ask it questions  \nregarding the identity of the person associated with that id.\n\nIn my view what will happen is that in the end all identity providers  \nwill have control of their openid they give out. So as Sun gives out  \nhttp://openid.sun.com/bblfish so visa will give out\nhttp://visa.com/iod/1231341 and there will then be my personal openid  \nfoaf file, which will link them all together (if I want to).\n\n\n\n[1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/foaf_openid\n[2] http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0-05.html\n\n\nHome page: http://bblfish.net/\nSun Blog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/\nFoaf name: http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me\n\n\n\n\n"}}
