However, as part of the project we will be\nintegrating query services and metadata stores produced by independent\nteams. One of the teams is successfully using SQL over ODBC as their\ncurrent query interface, and they&#39;re wondering what impact moving to a\nresource-oriented approach will have. This is an enterprise/intranet\nproject, so we have more-or-less complete control over the\ninter-process interfaces. However, as a design goal we want to be able\nto bring new types and instances of stores and query services online\nwith minimal effort, which is one reason why I favour a uniform\nabstraction like REST.\n\nThe other candidate area for a RESTful interaction is between the\nrich-client (Flex) UI and the presentation tier. Here the comparison\nwould be against something like Flex Data Services.\n\nRegards,\nIan\n\n"}}
