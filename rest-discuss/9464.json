You then replied as if to \ncontradict that statement:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;HTTP is a protocol for REST applications.\n&gt;\n\nWhich sounds to me like you are arguing that RFC 2616 defines the term, \n&quot;REST application&quot; when in reality it makes no mention of REST, or \nuniform interfaces, or anything else.  This implied to me that your \nmeaning was that any implementation of HTTP that doesn&#39;t violate RFC \n2616 is automatically a REST application.  If that was not your \nmeaning, then I apologize for misinterpreting your words.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;What were you trying to argue, again? You have not said a single\n&gt;thing that contradicts anything I said.\n&gt;\n\nI might ask you the same question, if your response to my assertion that \nHTTP doesn&#39;t define REST singles out that statement for rebuttal -- when \nyou could just as easily ask me to clarify my meaning.  If anyone is \nstill confused, when I say HTTP is not REST I mean that RFC 2616 doesn&#39;t \nbegin to describe an architectural style because it&#39;s only a protocol.\n\nFor example, XML-RPC doesn&#39;t violate RFC 2616 but it does break the \nconstraints of the REST architectural style.  Ergo, HTTP is not REST, as \nHTTP allows many things to be done which go directly against REST, and \nit is not possible to infer anything about REST from reading RFC 2616.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;You are talking about a universal interface, not just a uniform\n&gt;interface.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m sorry, but I do not find the word &quot;universal&quot; in the definition of \nREST given in Chapter 5.  The only reference I see is in 4.1:\n\n&quot;The challenge was to build a system that would provide a universally \nconsistent interface to this structured information, available on as \nmany platforms as possible, and incrementally deployable as new people \nand organizations joined the project.&quot;\n\nThis implies to me that the Uniform Interface constraint meets the \ndesign goal of a universal interface.  All snide remarks aside, what \ndo _you_ see as the difference between &quot;generic interface&quot;, &quot;universal \ninterface&quot; and &quot;uniform interface&quot;?\n\nI see those terms as interchangeable and define them all to mean the \nsame thing as &quot;REST connector&quot;.  A REST connector is a network API \nwhere the semantics of each interaction uniformly fit a universal \ninterface model so long as the semantics of the methods used are \nkept generic.  We can debate semantics for the rest of the year, I \nstill say to meet this constraint PUT must be given the same meaning \nin HTTP as STOR has in FTP but I will stand on my two earlier \nexplanations for why this must be so, and not repeat myself here.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
