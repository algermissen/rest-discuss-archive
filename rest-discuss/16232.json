No. And for good reason. They do not want clients\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to start making assumptions beyond text/html.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wait a minute, yes, they do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have a pointer where Amzon describes that syntactical\n&gt; &#39;promise&#39;? I could not find it. Would be interesting to see what\n&gt; exactly they write.\n&gt; \n\nWhere did I say they&#39;d made such a promise?  The fact is, all the big\nplayers are heavily invested in their existing text/html systems, which\nare utterly incomprehensible.  This incomprehensibility has a workaround\nby embedding metadata.  Things are moving towards standardizing that\nmetadata, for the explicit reason of making it more harvestable:\n\nhttp://ebusiness-unibw.org/pipermail/goodrelations/2010-January/000175.html\n\nWhere is it documented, besides embedded in their crap markup?  I don&#39;t\nknow.  But I do know, the big players are trying to expose this\ninformation, like what the price is and how to buy the item, such that\nit becomes searchable.  They are not doing this by ditching text/html,\nthey are doing this by adopting standardized domain-specific metadata\nvocabularies within their existing text/html.\n\n&lt;span class=&#39;price&#39;&gt;$11.99&lt;/span&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s some real-world Amazon markup.  If they didn&#39;t want to expose\nthis as the price of an item, they wouldn&#39;t tag it like this next to a\nlink to follow to purchase the item.  If this is how they&#39;ve decided to\nexpose price, then they can change their markup as often as they like\n-- provided the API exposed by the metadata stays the same.\n\nIf that span were just meant for style, then why not class=&#39;xyzzy&#39; to\nkeep user agents from making the assumption that it&#39;s an item price?\nThe reason it&#39;s class=&#39;price&#39; is to encourage that assumption.  No,\nthat isn&#39;t RDFa + GR like O&#39;Reilly or BestBuy, but it is metadata\nembedded in existing text/html for no reason but machine readability.\n\nAmazon can get away with making others transform their metadata to GR.\nBut there are few who can, the rest are adopting standards like RDFa +\nGR -- which have nothing to do with how the site looks, although I&#39;ve\nfound that adopting standardized metadata makes CSS easier to maintain.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
