Changing the state of a resource is done with PUT.\n\n9.5 POST    The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the\n   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed\n   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:\n       - Annotation of existing resources;\n\n9.6 PUT    The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\n   supplied Request-URI.\n\nAgain, it&#39;s src &gt;&gt; dest versus src &gt; dest.\n\nGiven that a sub can be a fairly complex object, including parameters like\ndeltas vs. whole objects, permissions, etc, it seems to me that most state\nchanges will affect only a subset of parameters.  If we were to use PUT it\nshould be like:\n\nPUT /subs/resource/permissions/a+w\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
