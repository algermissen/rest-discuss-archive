What return code would teh server use and does it make\n&gt; sense to send the order rejection document as the body of the\n&gt; (error-)response?\n\nThat&#39;s tricky, in the general sense.\n\nThe business protocol here (above the application protocol) is called\nOffer-Acceptance.\n\nSo what the client submits is (business-technically) an Offer To Buy.\nThe response could be acceptance or rejection or maybe a\ncounter-offer.  If the seller accepts, buyer and seller have a\ncontract.\n\nThere is a logical distinction between the offer and the response:  in\nUBL, for example, the offer is just called Order and the response is\ncalled OrderResponse.  They are different documents, and I think\ndeserve to be different resources in a RESTful app. See\nhttp://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.0/UBL-2.0.html\n\nThe interaction could be asynchronous.  In other words, the HTTP\nresponse to the initial request could just be an acknowledgement, and\nthe response to the offer to buy could come later.  Or in the case of\na counter-offer (for example, the seller could only partially fulfill\nthe order), the buyer and seller might exchange several documents.\n\nSo the answer to the question about the order rejection document is\n&quot;it depends&quot;.  Sometimes the seller might be able to respond\nimmediately (as the HTTP response), sometimes not.  At any rate, you\nmight want to think of the both order and response as resources.\n\n"}}
