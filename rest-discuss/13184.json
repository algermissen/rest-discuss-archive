It has the following  \n&gt; protocol:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /profiles - returns a list of user profiles\n&gt; POST /profiles - adds a new user profile\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /profiles/{userid} - gets the user profile of the specified user\n&gt; PUT /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile (non-browser)\n&gt; POST /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile (browser)\n&gt;\n&gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like it to work such that when a user does a GET\n&gt; /profiles/{userid}, the html representation that is returned either\n&gt; contains a link to a form to be used to edit the profile data, or\n&gt; directly contains the form for editing. For the former the form could\n&gt; be located at /profiles/{userid}?editform. In both cases, the form\n&gt; would be POSTed to /profiles/{userid}\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel strongly about either option and expect usability\n&gt; requirements or implementation details to guide me here (though I am\n&gt; interested in opinions if somebody thinks there&#39;s a better way).\n&gt;\n&gt; My real question has to do with providing a mechanism to create new\n&gt; users. I&#39;m really not sure what a good pattern for this might be. I\n&gt; can think of three possiblities:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. GET /profiles/newuser to get the form, and POST to /profiles\n&gt; This one kind of messes with the implied namespace of\n&gt; /profiles/{userid} in the newuser isnt really a userid\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. GET /profiles/ to get the form and POST to /profiles\n&gt; I think this is too subtle a distinction and probably has the\n&gt; collection semantics wrong\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. GET /profiles?newuser and POST to /profiles\n&gt; I dont have any real objection to this one at this point.\n&gt;\n&gt; Option 3 seems like a winner, but I&#39;m curious as to what other options\n&gt; there might be.
