But then, adding me=\r\nthods that *have* visibility adds some serious capabilities to HTTP. E.g. G=\r\nET&#39;s semantics allow for caching and it is also very helpful that we know t=\r\nhat GET is safe - we can call it any number of times.\n\nYou could do updates=\r\n with POST, but then, full updates have the inherent property of being idem=\r\npotent so it makes sense to define a method for that, leveraging the idempo=\r\ntency to the protocol level. Same for DELETE. For example, no a cache can m=\r\nark copies it has of a response as stale upon a corresponding response to a=\r\n PUT. PUT&#39;s idempotency is also a win over just using POST.\n\nIf the interac=\r\ntions you design match the semantics of PUT, use it (for its added visibili=\r\nty), if they do not match, just use POST.\n\nRedefining PUT to mean &#39;partial =\r\nupdate without idempotency&#39; is no win because  &#39;partial update without idem=\r\npotency&#39; does not give an intermediary any visibility. You could just use P=\r\nOST in the first place.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; but Jan&#39;s answer got a=\r\nuto-accepted.
