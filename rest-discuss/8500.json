It&#39;s just that in order to do\n&gt;     so you need a blank node, ie an\n&gt;     unnamed resource to describe it. \n\nSo... blank nodes are a placeholder for causal names? That would be seem \nto be so, since many people think URIs are proper names, and this \nthinking is clearly influencing web architectural decisions (cf, the \ndebacle around http-range and &quot;information resources&quot;).\n\nIt&#39;s this kind of axiom bake in that makes me quite nervous about the \nsemantic web. Assuming that a URL which requires a blank node is bad \ndesign, is an assumption that one theory of names counts more than \nanother. Anyone familiar with the modern philosphy will know that naming \ntheory remains *contentious*. Bad design then is a leap, not an \nimplication. Even though I agree with you on the design issue here, it \ngive me indigestion to use naming theory to support it.\n\nWhy, just today, a colleague and I were talking about syndication in the \ncontext of a folder system. In that case, there was a folder called \n&#39;health&#39; and it has a few direct child folders. All these folders have \nURLs. The Atom feed for the &#39;health&#39; URL only shows changes to the \nfolder&#39;s direct children.\n\nQ: should that feed show changes to child content further down, ie \nshould the feed scope work transitively?\n\nA: in this case yes, but in general for folder such structures, it \ndepends on the what the &#39;childof&#39; relationship means. For example all \ncategories are held in a root &#39;map&#39; folder, but the relationship between \nit and its categories does not necessarily mean all category changes \nshould show up in the map feed. Whereas the intent of the authors when \nthey created the &#39;health&#39; folder was that all children were to do with \nhealth, hence the health feed should show all changes.\n\nGive it 20 years of bake in. When the web&#39;s Wittgenstein turns up, the \nundoing create an entire industry.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
