You can \n&gt; PUT a message somewhere else and then updating the index.  You can add an \n&gt; entry to the index for a URL that does not currently resolve.  In contrast, \n&gt; the only way to add a message to a container is...to add a message to a \n&gt; container, making the message subordinate to the container.  Indexes don&#39;t \n&gt; imply subordination.  Containership does.\n\nWhat in a container representation, has you stated, imply that it is a\ncontainer is the content type. In your example, I know that I can POST a\nmime/rfc822 because the inbox is message/delivery. But your doc is one\nline because the documentation of these content-type has already been\ndone. Someone can&#39;t use your message system without reading all the mime\nstuff... quite long!...\nIf I state somewhere that the index format used in a system IS a\ncontainer, then you can not say that nothing is imply any more, and it&#39;s\nagain juste one line (as long as &quot;container&quot; is supposed known, i.e. you\ndon&#39;t need to describe a container behaviour, which is not so\nobvious...). That is what I mean by &quot;super-types&quot;. a message/digest IS a\ncontainer, an RSS feed IS a container, a directory index IS a\ncontainer... \n\n\n"}}
