But the most of the web today won&#39;t be taking\nadvantage of this for a long time. \n\nHTML5 won&#39;t be taken advantage of for a very long time, so how is this a\ncritcism?\n\n&gt;&gt; Again, I don&#39;t disagree about loose-coupling, but the technique serves\njust a tiny tiny fraction. Also consider the amount of JS code out there\nthat knows how to construct URIs from form params and other inputs. That\nwon&#39;t be migrating to use templates anytime soon.\n\nIf URI Templates are added I can see them be immediately incorporated into\nCMS like Drupal, WordPress and Joomla (I use the former two so I&#39;ll add it\nif nobody else does) and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and CakePHP.\nMost (all?) of those frameworks use clean URLs but can&#39;t use forms w/o using\nJavascript and URI templates would be a cleaner and simplier approach that\nit would be crazy for people NOT to use it. \n\nI for one will blog about it and promote if via Twitter and expect others\nlike dret and Jerome (and probably Mark) will do the same.\n\n&gt;&gt; Same as above. Those services/servers can very well allow form-encoded\ndata. I would argue that, doing so is better since it would let them work\nwith existing browsers and JS libraries.\n\nSo your only argument against is someone would need to create a URI Template\nlibrary and then they would need to use it? Just how hard is it to find and\nuse another library? \n\nWith that argument there should be no planning for HTML5 because &quot;existing\nlibraries&quot; don&#39;t work with HTML5, right?\n\n@dret&gt;&gt; i think the main question is whether HTML should look beyond\nservices designed specifically for backing forms, or not. it certainly could\nwithout harming backwards-compatibility, and one could also argue that this\nwould actually promote the design and implementation of services with more\nwell-designed RESTful APIs than form-encoded data. seen this way, such a\nfeature would be a pretty smart way of slowly improving the state of how\nservices are provided on the web.\n\nWell said.\n\n-Mike Schinkel \nhttp://mikeschinkel.com\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Subbu Allamaraju [mailto:subbu@...] \nSent: Saturday, November 01, 2008 1:56 PM\nTo: Erik Wilde\nCc: Mike Schinkel; &#39;Mark Nottingham&#39;; &#39;Ian Hickson&#39;; &#39;Jerome Louvel&#39;;\nwhatwg@...; uri@...; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] RE: [whatwg] Proposing URI Templates for\nWebForms 2.0\n\n\nOn Nov 1, 2008, at 10:01 AM, Erik Wilde wrote:\n\n&gt; Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I see the use cases, but what is the server gaining with this \n&gt;&gt; flexibility?

Those services/servers can very well allow form-encoded data.\nI would argue that, doing so is better since it would let them work with\nexisting browsers and JS libraries.\n\nSincerely,\nSubbu\n----\nhttp://www.subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
