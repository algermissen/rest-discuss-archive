Unfortunately, it&#39;s\nintended to be displayed only when a login attempt fails.\n\nIn truth, the dialog box bothers me less and less.  I think the browser\nmakers could dress it up a bit, making it look more like a feature of the\nbrowser instead of a out-of-place dumpy dialog box.\n\nAs for the &#39;logout&#39; bit, I think this gets back to some of the theories\nbehind REST itself.  My understanding is that 401 allows you to\n*authenticate*, not *log in*.  &quot;Logging in&quot; implies maintaining some form of\nserver-side session state, which is a big REST no-no (at least as I\nunderstand it).  In this view, it makes sense that there would not be a\ncorresponding &quot;logout&quot; ability.  I think that treating 401 as &quot;login&quot;\ninstead of &quot;authentication&quot; has been one of it&#39;s biggest barriers to it\nbeing more widely accepted.  I have to admit that I had the same\nissues/problems early on.  However, now that I have the correct mindset, I\nfind it to be the correct way to go.\n\nIt seems to me that if you have a RESTful application that you are\ndemonstrating (i.e. no server-side session state), when someone asked &quot;how\ndo you log on?&quot;, you could say something like &quot;You don&#39;t need to log on or\nlog off.  That&#39;s the old way of doing things.  Now, you only have to\nauthenticate yourself. That&#39;s it.&quot;  Sure, you might get a few people asking\n&quot;what&#39;s the difference?&quot;, but this would give you the opportunity to\nenlighten them.  :)\n\n[1] http://rfc.net/rfc2616.html#s10.4.2\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
