If I want to create a new customer instance, I could POST a representation of that customer to the collection resource. The server returns a &quot;201 created&quot; and the URI of the new customer instance, maybe &#39;/customers/1234&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now let&#39;s say I need to update this particular customer entity with new information. I could PUT the new description to the instance URI or I could POST it. Since &#39;/customers/1234&#39; is not a collection resource there is no ambiguity about what I want: Update this particular customer instance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a problem with that approach?\n\nNo. If the semantics of the resource are appropriately defined you can use POST to update the resource state.\n\nWhat you loose is visibility because no intermediary is able to see that there is actually an update going on.\n\nThere are also issues with idempotency because the user agent (if programmed in a sane way) will reject re-POSTing despite the user knowing that the update is actually idempotent.\n\nSee also: http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; Wikipedia&#39;s helpful article about REST says that a POST in that particular case should mean &quot;Treat the addressed member as a collection in its own right and create a new entry in it.&quot; But - at least in my case - if I would ever have to have a collection within the customer, I would have given it its own URI, such as &#39;/customers/1234/contacts&#39;. Therefore, it&#39;s clear from the context that the customer entity itself is not a collection and never will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, is there any particular danger in interpreting PUT and POST in the same way in this particular instance? \n&gt; \n&gt; Or maybe a bit broader: Is there a problem with taking the context into account when looking at the meaning of PUT and POST?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
