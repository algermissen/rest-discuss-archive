DELETE is more transparent to\nintermediaries, which means cache invalidation is automatic, letting you do\nplenty of interesting scenarios by intercepting http messages. POST is more\nubiquituous and can be alright in some circumstances.\n\nAs long as the client understand the semantic of a link (aka knows that the\none saying _delete customer_ is the one that means, well, deleting a\ncustomer), it can simply follow that link. Then it&#39;s just a matter of\nletting the client use whatever verb the server instructed it to use to\nperform the operation.\n\nSeb\n\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of oliver.riches@...\nSent: 21 September 2009 16:01\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Re: REST exposing supported operations...\n\nThanks Jan I will look Atom, you&#39;re info has been very helpful...\n\nI&#39;m starting to think the use of a DELETE operation is not as common as it\nappears it might be - because you can POST a resource that happen to\nencapsulate the operation - &#39;order cancelation&#39; resource posted to cancel an\norder in a booking system...\n\n\nOllie Riches\nRBS Global Banking & Markets\nOffice: +44 203 361 4071   \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jan Algermissen [mailto:algermissen1971@...] \nSent: 21 September 2009 15:55\nTo: RICHES, Oliver, GBM\nCc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: REST exposing supported operations...\n\n\nOn Sep 21, 2009, at 4:15 PM, oliver.riches@... wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; Think differently: a client understands the semantics of the links it \n&gt;&gt; encounters in representations it receives from the &gt;server and \n&gt;&gt; follows the appropriate links to proceed through the (Web-) \n&gt;&gt; application.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is really not different than you making a purchase at Amazon, \n&gt;&gt; except that in the machine to machine case the client code needs to \n&gt;&gt; be aware of the link semantics, e.g. where to POST an order.\n&gt;\n&gt; I just don&#39;t get this...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;am not interested in how the end-user uses the links I&#39;ve provide in \n&gt; my XML&#92;JSON representation of a resource - I don&#39;t have anything to do \n&gt; with presentation I just provide links to access resources and not the \n&gt; operation that is acceptable.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I don&#39;t understand how they know what they can do...\n\nTake a look at the Atom Publishing Protocol specification[1] as an example.\nThe specification of mediatypes and link semantics tell the client\nimplementor what to look for in responses and what HTTP calls to make on\nwhich resources.\n\nIf the media type you are using does not have the necessary semantics (e.g.\napplication/xml or application/json do not, while application/ atomsrv does)\nyou cannot convey the necessary semantics to the client.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; plus when I delete an order from Amazon is it doing a http DELETE \n&gt; operation with the link directly or is it doing a http POST on a \n&gt; button action which is then interpreted as a http DELETE on the server \n&gt; and forward to the service...\n&gt;\n\nThe use of POST partly has to do with browser capabilities and with the\ncollaboration style. Canceling an order is more than just deleting the order\nresource.
