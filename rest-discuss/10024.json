SimpleDB is underwhelming. I wouldn&#39;t commit to using it as my only\n&gt; datastore. Whoever owns your database owns you, as they say, usually\n&gt; in relation to DB2. The fact that you can&#39;t use mysql or postgres on\n&gt; EC2 is a limitation of their architecture (And the fact that the sole\n&gt; persistence model of EC2 is S3). I&#39;m not convinced that simpleDB is\n&gt; the solution. I&#39;d rather something that adopted GData.\n\nI don&#39;t see Amazon offering SimpleDB as a replacement for general  \npurpose relational databases. The press loved to say that it is going  \nto take on Oracle et al last week, but that is not the case.\n\nThe key use cases I see are:\n\n- Read-most\n- Simpler structures without needing referential integrity\n- Semi-structured, i.e. items don&#39;t need to have the same set of  \nattributes\n\nFor these cases, SimpleDB may be able to offer more affordable and  \n*scalable* storage without having to employ armies of DBAs. Of course,  \nenterprises won&#39;t touch SimpleDB. But if I am running a startup with  \nsome imagination to scale, I might consider it.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
