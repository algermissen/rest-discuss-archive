I have \n&gt; a feeling there&#39;s a mismatch between my semantics and the community&#39;s.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve seen it said over and over again that passing session IDs \n&gt; (typically in a cookie) is generally considered unRESTful. I&#39;ve also \n&gt; seen it said over and over again that passing credentials along with \n&gt; every request is considered very RESTful.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The reasonings are unclear to me, though. Considering the \n&gt; &quot;statelessness&quot; principle of REST, if I think of a RESTful architecture \n&gt; as one in which every request passes all the information needed for the \n&gt; server to fulfill the request, then I don&#39;t see how passing session IDs \n&gt; (for instance) in requests violates that principle.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; To me, a session ID is a simple alphanumeric string. Authentication \n&gt; credentials are (typically expressed as) a simple alphanumeric string. \n&gt; Both strings persist on the client. Both strings are received by the \n&gt; server and are compared to information held on the server in order to \n&gt; make decisions on the server about how to process the request, and thus \n&gt; the content of the strings can dramatically affect the server&#39;s response \n&gt; to the request.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; When approached from this way, I lose the meaning behind the \n&gt; distinction. What am I misunderstanding?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is your cookie passing all the application state it needs to pass or is \n&gt; some of that state held by the server, such that your request could not \n&gt; be load balanced between multiple servers?\n&gt; \n\nDigest authentication has the problem of not being able to be load \nbalanced between multiple servers (the server has to keep track of \nnonces), right?\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
