All\ncommunication involves the transfer of information. The HTTP verbs put\nthis feature of the communication front and centre by collapsing all of\nthe possible methods in the world down to a small set that transfer\ninformation. Instead of saying {theService, &quot;startService&quot;}, we say\n{&quot;http://example.com/services/theService/running&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;, text/plain\n&quot;true&quot;}. This message contains the same information, but puts the\nrequest into a canonical form. It uses a standard method to transfer the\nstate and a standard content type to format the information.\n\nUsing standard methods and content types has architectural implications\nthat are not obvious when you write a single server or client/server\npair. Consider the possibility that the author of the client doesn&#39;t\nwant to write software just for your service. Consider the possibility\nthat they want it to work for a thousand service providers. By phrasing\nthe request in terms of standard methods and content types we increase\nthe likelyhood that the request will be understood by many service\nproviders.\n\nOnce I have written a client that works with your service, I can make it\nwork with other services just by providing a different url. In fact,\ndepending on the semantics of my client I could even point it at\ncompletely different kinds of functions. I could turn a lightbulb on and\noff. I could interact with a building automation system.\n\nUsing standard methods and content types also assits intermediataries\nsuch as proxies in determining how to handle requests correctly. For\nexample, I might bar all PUT access to http://example.com/services not\nowned by the user... but might still allow GET access or might allow GET\naccess to a different class of user. If we were not using standard\nmethods or if we were hiding actions away in urls it would be more\ndifficult to craft these kinds of rules.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n\n"}}
