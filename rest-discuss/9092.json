AtomPP seems to me to\n&gt; be more of a well-defined conduit for implementing services\n&gt; than anything that would help identify specific services, but I\n&gt; haven&#39;t been following it closely enough to know for sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; So at the risk of having an opinion based on ignorance, I&#39;d say\n&gt; that AtomPP would be a great base but we still need to be able\n&gt; to define Webful APIs for specific services, i.e.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;application/atomserv+xml/events&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Event&quot;s here would still be vetted by a working group\n&gt; somewhere and still need to be registered with IANA.\n&gt; \n&gt; How does that sit with you?\n\nNot sure. I appreciate the concern, but I’m coming to different\nconclusions.\n\nLooking at `application/atomsvc+xml` tells a client where to look\nfor links, and what they mean (well mostly; there may be\nextension elements and link relationships it doesn’t know about,\nbut that’s fine). And generic clients for AtomPP are certainly\ngoing to be written. (Going to? Have been.)\n\nWhat specific use case the AtomPP server in question is designed\nfor should hopefully not matter – not to the point of needing a\nnew media type anyway. If it differs that much, it won’t be\nAtomPP anymore and should be designed from scratch.\n\n(If it doesn’t differ that much, then describing the difference\nwithin the document, such as by using the feature extension,\nwould be enough; intermediaries, f.ex., wouldn’t be affected by\nthe specific use case.)\n\nAnd I do fully expect we will see other generic REST-based\nprotocols, mostly non-overlapping in the class of target use\ncases. That is fine and I consider it a sign of a healthy\necosystem. From another part of my message that you quoted:\n\n&gt; &gt; We need a middle ground: a small variety of somewhat generic\n&gt; &gt; media types that can be used for a wide variety of things.\n&gt; &gt; Individual services can then use one of them, and clients can\n&gt; &gt; then be implemented as glue on top of a library.\n\nI think our difference in view is that you see AtomPP as ruling\nthe market, possibly? My expectation is that it will see strong\nadoption, and maybe even capture a majority of the pie (a big\nmaybe here), however I don’t think it will take all. Therefore\nI’m not that worried.\n\nWhat might be useful is to have payload media types for common\napplications, for reuse across REST-based protocols. But that is\nsomething I think will happen naturally in a non-coordinated\nfashion anyway.\n\nFor now I just want to watch AtomPP and see how things shake out.\nREST outside the browser hasn’t really been done in anger on the\nopen web yet, and I have little faith in our collective ability\nto anticipate what will work and what not so much.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
