Show me a single example that has been=\r\n deliberately designed  unRESTful on the basis of design principles.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n think that last statement is demonstrably provable to be false. To make a =\r\nweb API purely RESTful takes more effort on the part of the client and some=\r\n who have published web APIs have on purpose chosen not to require that eff=\r\nort. I can&#39;t point to specific APIs at this moment but I know I&#39;ve read pos=\r\nts from others on various other web API-related lists such as API Craft say=\r\ning that pure REST makes it harder than they want for people to succeed at =\r\nusing their web API.\n\nIt is true that REST achieves much of its decoupling =\r\nby moving responsibilities to the client and it is also true that it requir=\r\nes more work on the client side compared to hard coding a bunch of URIs.\n\nH=\r\nowever, the client developer also benefits from not being bothered with hav=\r\ning to follow API updates *at all* (aside from long-term deprecation period=\r\ns). It is a matter of trade off and I don;t think that the average client d=\r\neveloper/owner would not understand what the flexibility buys them.\n\nAs alw=\r\nays, REST is great for leveraging homogeneity and we should ease client dev=\r\neloper&#39;s live by working much more intensly on things like JSON-Home[1]. Op=\r\nen source libs for these things should make arguments regarding client-deve=\r\nloper ease irrelevant.\n\nBesides, the same people that talk about client-dev=\r\neloper ease vs. REST today where the ones that sold you WS-* yesterday. I m=\r\nean, what is a little form processing compared to getting a SOAP stack up a=\r\nn running :-)\n\nIMHO, it is much more a matter of eductaion than a matter of=\r\n developer ease.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Of course if they then call their web API RESTf=\r\nul they are in the wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Further, and this (only) a slight tangent bu=\r\nt the more I learn about pure REST the more I come to believe that the focu=\r\ns on hypermedia constraint it a red herring when an application-specific me=\r\ndia type is not used.\n\nWell, yes. Of course.\n\n&gt; AFAICT very promoting hyper=\r\nmedia make the explicit point that hypermedia does not bring the benefits o=\r\nf REST without a dedicated media type.\n\nYes, because generic media types on=\r\nly shove the problem up a layer - into out of band knowledge.\n\n&gt; By itself =\r\nhypermedia just adds complexity; with a dedicated media-type a client can b=\r\ne built that &quot;knows&quot; what do with the links found in the media type\n\nExactl=\r\ny. User agents *implement* media type specifications. And they offer users =\r\nto activate controls to proceed from one steady state to the next through *=\r\ntheir* application.\n\n\n&gt; but I see (almost?) nobody advocating this besides =\r\nsome cryptic comments from Roy on his blog almost 5 years ago.\n\nI do and ot=\r\nhers, too. I also apply specific media types in real world projects with gr=\r\neat satisfaction and no pain on neither side.\n\nIt&#39;s just that its very diff=\r\nicult to argue about (and it&#39;s all there in the archives and on Roy&#39;s blog =\r\n:-) anyhow) but much easier to demonstrate with a real problem at hand.\n\nIt=\r\n&#39;s also pretty straight forward, actually. I have never understood the relu=\r\nctance people have to put they semantics they need done in a media type - r=\r\night where REST wants them to be. &lt;shrug/&gt;\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Mike\n\n\n[1] http://t=\r\nools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home\n"}}
