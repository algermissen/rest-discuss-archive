For exam=\r\nple: search, pick item, buy - the only way  \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; can code that is by =\r\nexpecting, for example, buying to be available\n&gt;&gt; from the application stat=\r\ne &#39;viewing item&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please re-consider my media-type/goal approach. The m=\r\nachine client  \n&gt; should not be driven by expectations of the flow, it shou=\r\nld not  \n&gt; assume search+pick+buy is the one and only sequence. It should n=\r\not  \n&gt; have a set of actions - it should have a set of goals. Achieving  \n&gt;=\r\n those goals is then dependent on the returned ressources.\n\nYes, good POV. =\r\nI&#39;ve thought along these lines for quite some time, but  \nrecent coding exp=\r\nerience has just led me to believe that you cannot  \nget around assumptions=\r\n of when to do what. You say the machine client  \n&quot;should have a set of goa=\r\nls&quot;. True. But it also has to know the  \npartial ordering of the goals and =\r\nit has to know that buying comes  \nafter picking the item. I just do not se=\r\ne how you could code the  \nclient without (at some point in some form) maki=\r\nng the assumptions I  \nam talking about.\n\nTry it. Write some pseudo code an=\r\nd show me how you get away with not  \ncoupling the server to the client&#39;s e=\r\nxpectation that it will  \n(definitely) be able to execute the &quot;buy&quot; goal fr=\r\nom the application  \nstate &quot;viewing the item&quot;.\n\nThe client is not &quot;driven b=\r\ny expectations of the flow&quot; but it must  \ndrive the interaction (not be dri=\r\nven by it). The client is an  \nindependent program (not a user agent prepro=\r\ncessing received  \nrepresentations for a human user).\n\nAnother way to say i=\r\nt is that client and server are coupled by the  \npartial ordering of the go=\r\nals of their collaboration. And this partial  \nordering coupling effectivel=\r\ny means that the client does not only  \ndiscover the state machine at runti=\r\nme but makes assumptions about it  \nat design time.\n\n\n&gt; This means the serv=\r\ner gets to decide the current state, not the  \n&gt; client. The current state =\r\nis defined by the media-type/goal  \n&gt; combination and the client only contr=\r\nols one of them.\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;controls one of them&quot;?\n\n\n&gt; Lets assu=\r\nme our client knows the new &quot;terrorist check&quot; media type.  \n&gt; It has browse=\r\nd to an item and so the current state is:  \n&gt; mediatype=3Ditem, goal=3Dbuy.=\r\n\n\nBut how does it know that it makes sense to actually have the goal of  \nb=\r\nuying at this point?\n(Assuming the buy goal availability means assuming som=\r\nething about the  \navailable state transitions).\n\n\n&gt; The client decides the=\r\n next step by looking for the &quot;buy&quot; relation -  \n&gt; but the server decides t=\r\nhe next state by returning a media type of  \n&gt; it&#39;s own choice. The next st=\r\nate might be mediatype=3D&quot;terrorist check&quot;  \n&gt; or mediatype=3D&quot;order&quot; plus =\r\ngoal=3D&quot;buy&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, yes, ultimately the machine client must be pre-confi=\r\ngured with  \n&gt; a knowledge of how to reach it&#39;s current goal given any of t=\r\nhe media- \n&gt; types returned. But it should not be pre-configured with any  =\r\n\n&gt; assumptions about the exact workflow - the server decides the  \n&gt; workfl=\r\now, whereas the client decides the goals.\n\nYes, I agree comepletely. I just=\r\n fugured that it basically amountsto  \nthe same thing :-) What is the diffe=\r\nrence between &#39;exact workflow&#39; and  \n&#39;decide the goals&#39;. I argue: there is =\r\nno difference with regard to the  \ninduced coupling. It means knowing the s=\r\ntate machine at design time.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Some Amazon items may require terrorist-=\r\nchecks, but some may not.  \n&gt; Some items may require an approval of a kind,=\r\n some may not - it all  \n&gt; depends on the current ressource type, not an ex=\r\npectation of a  \n&gt; precise workflow. This plus content negotiation makes it=\r\n possible to  \n&gt; evolve the service as long you accept to teach your client=\r\n how to  \n&gt; handle new ressource types (and that is actually RESTful).\n\nDo =\r\nyou think that it is ok for the server to break a previously  \nestablished =\r\ncontract because the client can adapt by re-configuring/re- \nprograming it?=\r\n (Which is what I think you are saying above).\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
