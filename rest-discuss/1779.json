If you use a basic lock file approach, either the file is there or not\nand assuming that delete actually does delete the lock file and not simply\nremove the mapping link (so that you end up with a multitude of unlinked old\nlock file versions somewhere in your file system) then all is well.\n\n\nRobert\n\n\n&gt;Jb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
