All of the REST constraints exist \n&gt; &gt;&gt; for a reason. The first thing you should do is determine \n&gt; &gt;&gt; what that reason is, and then see if it still applies to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the system being designed. Use the old noggin -- that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the point.\n...\n&gt; As someone who has achieve great notoriety for your disseration\n&gt; regarding REST, I bet you find it frustrating to have so many people\n&gt; &quot;intrepret&quot; you work and then apply the quality of gospel to their\n&gt; interpretation?  Sheesh; politics, religion, and technical\n&gt; recommendations; they&#39;re all the same! ;)   \n\nBut beware as a newcomer to REST that what you see as religious dogma\nmay in fact be based soundly in ideas that you haven&#39;t come to grasp\nwith, yet. The constraints of REST exist for specific reasons. I have\nseen many people come through this list arguing about whether one thing\nwas more restful than another, when both were RESTful and the one being\ntouted as &quot;more&quot; RESTful was also sillier. However, to assume that there\nis no opacity constraint at all or to assume that new content types\nshould be devised for each new service on the Internet would also be\nfaulty.\n\nConstraints do exist for specific reasons, and those reasons should be\nthought out and understood before reacting too badly against them. REST\nis about building an information architecture that scales to the size of\nthe Internet, both at a technical and a social level. It is about\ncreating a practical web of semantics. If it isn&#39;t your goal to\nparticipate in such a web not all of the constraints will apply. However\nkeeping those constraints and the reasons for them in mind will help you\nif you ever find yourself needing to participate.\n\nI&#39;ll have a crack at some of this (with apologies to Roy).\n\n&gt;         A resource does not change.\n\nA resource is like an object, and a url is like a pointer to that\nobject. If I have the same pointer, it will be the same object at the\nother end of that pointer. Over time the state of that object may\nchange, so when I GET it i&#39;ll retreive different results. It still means\nthe same thing.\n\n&gt;         What does change are the perceptions of the users of a\n&gt;         resource.\n&gt;         The semantic web assumes a world that does not change its own\n&gt;         perceptions.\n\nI&#39;ll leave this one to Roy :)\n\n&gt;         The reason is independent evolution of components. (The reason\n&gt;         for what?)\n\nI believe you&#39;ll find that this is the reason for URL opacity. If I\nassume without being told that particular URL constructions exist, then\nI may be forcing the same web site provider over time or different web\nsite providers at the same time to construct their URI spaces the same\nway. This limits evolution of the noun-space. If I follow hyperlinks or\nfill out server-provided forms to discover the urls of particular\nresources then different servers or the same server over time have\ngreater opportunity to evolve differently.\n\n&gt;         And hypermedia is a defined term (Can you {point to a}\n&gt;         definition? I&#39;m trying to understand what point you were\n&gt;         trying to make by including this statement.)\n\nHypermedia is data (media) plus hyperlinks. I think it is reasonable to\nconsider forms and other devices that clients can use to construct urls\n(hyperlinks) are part of hypermedia.\n\nIdeally, hypermedia would be used whenever a resource is being\ndiscovered. Obviously you have to start somewhere, but by finding\nhyperlinks in Location headers and documents and by filling out\nserver-provided forms to locate more resources you should be able to get\nfrom point A to point B with a minimum of hassle. It is contingent on\nthe service provider to ensure that navagability is considered. There\nshould be a map on someone&#39;s whiteboard somewhere showing which\nresources a client is expected to find by out of band means, and how\nthey get to everything they need to find from that point.\n\nConsider the Web. You start from a home page plus bookmarks, and\nnavigate out from there. You will often use a search engine form to\nconstruct a search url. When you go to that url you will hopefully find\nresources that are of use to you. Machines can follow similar patterns.\nThey start at a particular resource, then use the semantics attached to\nparticular hyperlinks to determine where to go next. URL templating of\nthe kind specified in [1] can be used as a machine-readable forms\ntechnology. Particular resources can represent searches.\n\nSee also:\nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BenjaminsRESTTutorial\nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RESTfulDesign\n\nBenjamin.\n[1]\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.txt\n\n\n\n"}}
