Fielding wrote:\n: &gt; I might write another book some day, assuming I ever get in the swing \n: &gt; of writing on a regular basis (and ignoring email). I doubt that I \n: &gt; would call it a REST book, though it would contain REST. I am sure the \n: &gt; publisher would try to market it that way anyway.\n: \n: So this is perhaps a good (if dangerous :-) time to ask what Roy and the\n: rest of you (no pun intended) think of Leonard&#39;s new book proposal:\n: \n: http://www.crummy.com/2006/11/03/1\n: &gt; I got the idea for a REST book when I started seriously trying to \n: &gt; figure out what was and wasn&#39;t REST. I noticed that though certain \n: &gt; best practices showed up repeatedly in REST folklore, they never \n: &gt; really progressed beyond that point. I decided to write a book that \n: &gt; would set down the folklore and hopefully create some new canon, some \n: &gt; common ground.\n: http://www.crummy.com/writing/REST-Web-Services/\n: \n: &gt; This is the book that puts the &quot;web&quot; back into &quot;web services&quot;. You can \n: &gt; design a web service that uses HTTP, XHTML, and URIs. You just need to \n: &gt; understand REST, the architecture of the web. REST Web Services gives \n: &gt; you the tools you need to argue for sensible web services, and the \n: &gt; strategies and code you need to create them.\n: Leonard is may be overly-self-congratulatory (perhaps with deliberate\n: irony), but it sounds like there is a lot of demand for such a thing.\n: Whether there is a &quot;need&quot; for this book in particular is perhaps a more\n: difficult question. :-)\n: \n: Still, Leonard is actively soliciting feedback, so this is a chance for\n: y&#39;all to put your money where your mouth is...\n: \n: -- Ernie P.\n: \n: \n: \n: __________ NOD32 1.1857 (20061107) Information __________\n: \n: This message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\n: http://www.eset.com\n: \n:\n\n"}}
