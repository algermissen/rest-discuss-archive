This is because\n&gt;      &gt;&gt; the foundation respects and suggests variety of technical\n&gt;     approaches.\n&gt;      &gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t fear innovation or even internal confrontation between\n&gt;      &gt;&gt; projects which overlap in functionality.\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; Do I need to comment further?\n&gt; \n&gt;     The point is this - why is the API called RESTful? That&#39;s not a\n&gt;     technical issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If I had a dollar for every project/person who thinks REST is short for \n&gt; RPC over HTTP (now with 100% more Verbs!) ...\n\nWhat do you think will happen if the ASF is asked to remoniker that page \nto say an &quot;RPC API&quot; ?\n\n\n&gt; The point of incubation is to create a self-governing community around \n&gt; the project, and that includes a place to discuss these things, \n&gt; specifically the ESME dev mailing list.  If the original developers \n&gt; didn&#39;t know REST well enough, here&#39;s the chance of get involved and \n&gt; sprinkle some REST goodness there.\n\nI get more done posting criticism here or on a weblog. I don&#39;t want to \ngo around fixing broken APIs, but I would like them to be named for what \nthey are.  It&#39;s not as though the ASF community doesn&#39;t have members who \n  can do this.\n\n\n&gt; It&#39;s also possible this is the odor of corporate branding applied to the \n&gt; project in its pre-Apache days.  Incubation is the chance to shed \n&gt; the corporate/proprietary mentality and grow into an open \n&gt; source/community.  If you can&#39;t do that, you don&#39;t graduate, so when \n&gt; voting to accept a project for incubation, it&#39;s about the possibility of \n&gt; it becoming an Apache project, less so about the raw materials.\n\nAll right and true, but beside the point.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
