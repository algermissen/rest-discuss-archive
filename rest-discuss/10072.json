Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; [2007-12-24 23:25]:\n&gt; What Aristotle may have been referring to is the ability of a server\n&gt; to take one state update (via PUT) and reflect that update in\n&gt; various ways on later GET.  That is because there is no correlation\n&gt; in HTTP between a PUT and any subsequent GET other than that\n&gt; described by the server itself (via etags).  For example, if you do\n&gt; a PUT of a diff in context (diff -C3) format, it is reasonable for\n&gt; the server to later supply a different representation of that same\n&gt; diff in the uniform (diff -u) format (assuming anyone ever bothers\n&gt; to register the media types).\n\nThat is related (in both cases, the key is that PUT does not mean\nbyte-for-byte storage), but is not quite what I was referring to.\n\nAn example of what I was thinking of is when a client PUTs a\nrepresentation that cannot, due to the format used, describe the\nentire state of the resource. In that case, the server has to\nfill in the rest of the state somehow, and it may or may not use\nprevious resource state to do so.\n\nAlso, there may be aspects of resource state that the server does\nnot allow clients to modify, ever. An obvious example of the\nlatter would be the app:edited element in an Entry stored by an\nAtompub server. But itâ€™s easy to imagine a variation of this\nelement that contains not a datetime, but an edit counter. The\nnew value of this counter after a PUT would then obviously be\nbased on its previous value and would not be based on anything\nthat the client included in its request.\n\nSo there are various legitimate ways in which new resource state\nmay derive from previous resource state.\n\nHowever, in no such scenario are the semantics of PUT affected.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
