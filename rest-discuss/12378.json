Atom Protocol leaves the deletion of\n&gt; &gt; collections undefined, which means it could go either way.  Since\n&gt; &gt; members can belong to multiple collections, it seems wiser to me, to\n&gt; &gt; not delete individual members when a collection is deleted.  Unless\n&gt; &gt; my application logic constrains resources to only be members of one\n&gt; &gt; collection.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still talking past each other :).   My question was not about\n&gt; AtomPub, but about REST; if one were defining an AtomPub-like\n&gt; protocol using the REST architectural style, and decided to define\n&gt; DELETE in this way, would it be a violation of REST&#39;s uniform\n&gt; interface constraint?  My opinion is no, it&#39;s fine.\n&gt; \n\nThen take out the sentence about AtomPub, the answer still stands.  I\ndon&#39;t know why the expected behavior of a DELETE request on a URI would\never consider side effects on other resources.  The expectation is that\nthe requested URI is deleted, nothing else.\n\nTrying my earlier explanation another way, let&#39;s say that I have\nassigned the DELETE method to delete one and only one resource, be it\nmember or collection.  Now, I want my API to also allow the deletion of\na collection to mean delete all members of the collection.\n\nTo maintain a uniform, generic interface, I would hijack FTP&#39;s MDELETE\nmethod to mean delete all members of a named collection.  It&#39;s only\nallowed on collections, not members.  I now have the expected behavior\nof DELETE along with its visibility to intermediaries, without muddling\nits semantics to also sometimes mean bulk delete.\n\nAs to MDELETE, in a REST API as opposed to FTP, it would only accept\nthe target URI, not a list of URIs.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
