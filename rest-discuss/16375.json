TM already has all\n&gt; the=\r\n concepts key to REST incorporated into the language.\n\nNot sure I can agree=\r\n with that statement. First, I suspect what you&#39;re\ntalking about here is th=\r\ne TM Data Model and various implementations of\nit, and while it&#39;s true that=\r\n there are smaller core ontologies and\nimplementation wrappers that people =\r\nhave created which makes a\nperfectly RESTful TM world, the TM standards the=\r\nmselves don&#39;t hold\nmuch RESTness in them. Having said that, I and a few oth=\r\ners have\nindividually all create various RESTful interfaces to integrate wi=\r\nth\nthe TM paradigms, and they kick ass! The trouble is that you also need\nt=\r\no understand basic identity management and ontology work in order to\nmake m=\r\nuch sense of the TM world, although I don&#39;t think a little\neducation is muc=\r\nh to ask when the solution to all your problems are\noffered. :)\n\n&gt; The prob=\r\nlems I see with it are:\n&gt; * Its XML serialization is VERY verbose (there is=\r\n a more terse text serialization though).\n\nThere&#39;s more compact XML version=\r\n like TM/XML and CXTM, as well as\nTM/JSON, plus various notation languages =\r\nlike LTM, and they could all\nbe very fast to serialize (especially TM/JSON =\r\nis interesting as it\nalso leverages more common web architectural concepts)=\r\n.\n\n&gt; * I&#39;m not sure how many FOSS libraries there are for it (TM is a stand=\r\nard for many governments so I think there are some that are well written).\n=\r\n\nThere&#39;s a small forest of them, from big and complex (like Ontopia) or\nsim=\r\nple (TinyTIM) Java, down to Python, Ruby, and PHP (embedded, or\nLAMP, or so=\r\nmewhere in the middle). Heck, there&#39;s even one in XSLT. :)\n\n&gt; But I know th=\r\nat I could use it to build a (nearly) arbitrarily complex self-coding syste=\r\nm from it (at least within the bounds of the types of systems we build with=\r\n REST constraints) Thoughts?\n\nYes, yes, and yes. I have various forms of on=\r\ntologies that embedded\nall of REST, and you can use that to even create sel=\r\nf-assembled\nsystems. The possibilities are endless, but require a bit of me=\r\nntal\neffort.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n--\n=A0Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alch=\r\nemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n--- http://shelter.nu/blog/ ------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n------------------ http://www.google.com=\r\n/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n\n"}}
