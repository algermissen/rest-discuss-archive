[1]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What are you even talking about? =\r\n=A0HTML media types have always been\n&gt; machine-readable. =A0There is no hum=\r\nan involved, correct me if I&#39;m wrong,\n&gt; in Google&#39;s index of the Web. =A0Th=\r\ne very fact that alternate browsing\n&gt; devices can guide the blind through a=\r\nn HTML table, proves the machine-\n&gt; readability of the media types I mentio=\r\nn. =A0That&#39;s not even taking RDFa\n&gt; into consideration.\n\nI was referring to=\r\n that vision of m2m of the future, where no need of\ndirect human consuption=\r\n in a structured way, like it is now using\nbrowsers, will be necessary. It =\r\nstill will be possible, but not\nnecessary. (Other ways, non structured ones=\r\n, will certainly appear has\nis characteristic of &quot;pervasive computing&quot;). On=\r\ne of the\ncharacteristics of XML as it is presented in the ref.(2) is that X=\r\nML\nshould be human rleadable, even if its purpose is for m2m consumption.\nI=\r\n think this will also answer the nasty remarks below where you refer\nblind =\r\npeople.\n\nAnd this vision its not mine, is from TB-L, that I used thinking y=\r\nou\nwould consider him &quot;authoritative&quot; and someone who knows what is\ntalking=\r\n about.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; How on Earth do you read that reference, and decide that it m=\r\neans HTML\n&gt; should only be written for machines?\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t =A0understand w=\r\nhere I meant that, if I meant something on those\nlines (and i do not) it wi=\r\nll be the opposite.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HTML is as much as structuring text as it is abo=\r\nut presentation\n&gt;&gt; (although the tendency and recommendation is to use CSS =\r\nfor that, but\n&gt;&gt; nevertheless the markup is there).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, HTML can be=\r\n misused for presentation. =A0How does that change the\n&gt; fact that, properl=\r\ny used, it&#39;s about structuring data? =A0Not just text,\n&gt; data. =A0Since 200=\r\n4, all my markup is based on structuring data and\n&gt; documents logically, se=\r\nparate from their presentation, all of which may\n&gt; be found in external CSS=\r\n documents.\n&gt;\n&gt; How on Earth does pointing out that it&#39;s *possible* to mix =\r\nstructure\n&gt; and presentation, begin to make what I&#39;m saying wrong? =A0Is it=\r\n possible\n&gt; for you to tone down the argumentativeness of, well, _all_ your=\r\n posts?\n&gt;\n\nCan be misused? HTML was created for that, and the fact that at =\r\nsome\npoint it was *recommended* that part of formatting will be better done=\r\n\nseparaly, does not make that false. Its like saying it is a misuse to\nwrit=\r\ne in paper since now we have word processors to do it...\n\nWhat I was saying=\r\n is that albeit HTML can be used to m2m comunication,\nthere are better, mor=\r\ne specialized tools to do it.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, if my main goal is not to make\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n a website but to allow services to access my data in a =A0&quot;machines\n&gt;&gt; tal=\r\nking to machines&quot; way,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Who says the main goal of a REST system is ma=\r\nking a website? =A0What a\n&gt; REST system *is*, is a distributed hypertext ap=\r\nplication. =A0A user,\n&gt; could be human or machine, is attempting to perform=\r\n a task, using an\n&gt; interface transferred over the network. =A0The main goa=\r\nl of a REST system\n&gt; is to provide a hypertext application interface over t=\r\nhe network.\n&gt;\n\nAnd where did I said that the main goal was that? Cmon, I&#39;m =\r\nnot *that*\nstupid, or my english is very bad or you misread what I say,\nint=\r\nentionally or not.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; why should I care about &lt;b&gt;bolds&lt;/&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;ita=\r\nlics&lt;/i&gt;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is yet another question for the sake of being argumen=\r\ntative, isn&#39;t\n&gt; it? =A0Inline markup has nothing to do with the structure I=\r\n was speaking\n&gt; of, which comes from block-level markup. =A0If your data do=\r\nesn&#39;t include\n&gt; natural language which may contain emphasized passages, the=\r\nn,\n&gt; *obviously*, these tags are irrelevant to your system.\n\nFunny how late=\r\nr on you contradict that. But again or I don&#39;t know how\nto explain myself o=\r\nr you understand things the way it suites you. You\nonce again took the tree=\r\ns as the forest. I and B are trees, HTML is\nthe forest.\n\nSo once again, why=\r\n should I use a general purpose markup language that\nwas designed to struct=\r\nure *and* format general data, when I can use\nXML that was designed &quot;as a s=\r\net of rules for encoding  documents in\nmachine-readable form&quot;,&quot;widely used =\r\nfor the  representation of\narbitrary data structures&quot;? Is this definition w=\r\nrong?\n\nI know what you say, HTML is ubiquious, etc... But isn&#39;t XML ubiquos=\r\n\nas well? In HTML you already have meaning like TD and TR. And what?\nYou ha=\r\nve a table. Don&#39;t you have to define if that table is a table of\npotatos or=\r\n apples or whatever? Don&#39;t you have to give a specific\nmeaning to the gener=\r\nal meaning of table? So why don&#39;t you do it in\nXML?\n\nThe only advantage in =\r\nusing a HTML table is that it renders in\nbrowsers as a table. Formatting...=\r\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A cargo manifest is still just tables and lists, structurally. =A0Sam=\r\ne\n&gt; with genetic data. =A0Or flight reservations. =A0Or concert tickets. =\r\n=A0Or\n&gt; anything else you can think about interacting with over the Web -- =\r\nyou\n&gt; can model it using ubiquitous media types. =A0BTW, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; aren&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; automatically presentational. =A0Semantically, &lt;em&gt;USS Constitution&lt;/em&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; is improper -- ship names are marked up with &lt;i&gt;, so if the cargo\n&gt; mani=\r\nfest has anything to do with maritime shipping, then yeah, you need\n&gt; to ca=\r\nre about &lt;i&gt;. =A0Or re-invent that wheel in your custom media type.\n&gt;\n\nYou =\r\ncontradict what you said, but that&#39;s not important. Nor unusual.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why=\r\n should I care about accessibility at all? That is\n&gt;&gt; a problem for web des=\r\nigners to deal, not to a &quot;data provider&quot; service\n&gt;&gt; designer...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;=\r\nre right. =A0Why shouldn&#39;t the ability to see be a prerequisite for\n&gt; devel=\r\noping and maintaining your system? =A0After all, it&#39;s not like\n&gt; there&#39;s an=\r\ny solution out there to the problem of communicating text to\n&gt; the blind...=\r\n =A0I don&#39;t know about you, but that sounds mighty\n&gt; discriminatory to me.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t care if your system is targeted to machine users. =A0You don&#39;t\n=\r\n&gt; have a bunch of Cylons developing it, do you? =A0No? =A0You&#39;re using\n&gt; hu=\r\nmans? =A0Yeah, I thought so. =A0How on Earth is a human going to develop,\n&gt;=\r\n let alone debug, a hypertext interface that&#39;s only machine readable?\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\no, as it turns out, humans will have to use your hypertext after all...\n&gt; w=\r\nhich is also the basis of the Web&#39;s success. =A0How will another entity\n&gt; i=\r\nnteroperate with, or re-use, your system if their humans can&#39;t access\n&gt; you=\r\nr interface? =A0Again, the reason for choosing HTML as your hypertext\n&gt; for=\r\n driving the application, is because the option is there for\n&gt; accessibilit=\r\ny.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fine, you don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass. =A0But what if, next month, your b=\r\noss\n&gt; does? =A0Perhaps as the result of an anti-discrimination in the workp=\r\nlace\n&gt; lawsuit, since you&#39;re excluding the blind from a job that only invol=\r\nves\n&gt; reading and manipulating text... =A0Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just add=\r\n in\n&gt; the accessibility markup to your existing HTML, than have to re-inven=\r\nt\n&gt; that wheel for your custom media type?\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s the part where you are=\r\n just being nasty, isn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So why not put the focus on XML, that &quot;=\r\nis a set of rules for encoding\n&gt;&gt; documents in machine-readable form&quot;,&quot;wide=\r\nly used for the\n&gt;&gt; representation of arbitrary data structures&quot; [2]?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Oh, good grief. =A0Do I honestly have to type (X)HTML every time? =A0Isn&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; it obvious when I say &quot;HTML media types&quot; that I&#39;m referring to\n&gt; text/ht=\r\nml _and_ application/xhtml+xml? =A0Nitpicking semantics is, again,\n&gt; argume=\r\nntative.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why use HTML that &quot;tells you how data should look&quot; instead=\r\n of XML that\n&gt;&gt; &quot;tells you what it means&quot;, that &quot;applies context to the dat=\r\na&quot;, and\n&gt;&gt; &quot;separates data content from data presentation&quot;[3]?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Becau=\r\nse HTML doesn&#39;t tell you how data should look, you&#39;re making false\n&gt; assump=\r\ntions.\n&gt;\n\nNot me then, I  was just quoting... But I already commented about=\r\n this.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn&#39;t you agree that REST is much more than a glorified wa=\r\ny of\n&gt;&gt; making web sites?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. =A0But your habit of asking questions=\r\n in that form tempts me to\n&gt; argue against it to the bitter end. =A0A telep=\r\nhony system that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; involve HTML or browsers can be RESTful, and if =\r\nit is, a data-view\n&gt; analysis of it will look exactly like the data-view an=\r\nalysis of a\n&gt; website. =A0This holds true for any REST system.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So I=\r\n would say: ... Create your own Media-Type. Create hundreds,\n&gt;&gt; thousands o=\r\nf new Media-Types. Don&#39;t wait for some organization to\n&gt;&gt; define then from =\r\nthe top-down. Do it yourself from the ground-up and\n&gt;&gt; encourage others to =\r\ndo the same.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, you would -- you&#39;re always arguing against the im=\r\nportance of some\n&gt; aspect of REST or another. =A0This is absolutely, unequi=\r\nvocally NOT the\n&gt; REST style, and represents an utter failure to grasp the =\r\nnotion of a\n&gt; media type. =A0Look, HTML 5 will use the same media type as H=\r\nTML 4, and\n&gt; HTML 3, and HTML 2, and HTML before that. =A0HTML 5 will be us=\r\ned to do\n&gt; all the same complicated things, like airline reservations, over=\r\n the\n&gt; Web, using the same media type that&#39;s always been used.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is =\r\nthe point of REST, folks. =A0If you&#39;re putting a hypertext\n&gt; interface out =\r\non the Web for human consumption, then it does not matter\n&gt; what the nature=\r\n of your data is, you can create an HTML interface. =A0The\n&gt; worst possible=\r\n thing you can do, is go about minting new media types\n&gt; for each resource =\r\ntype you create.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you do that, then I expect the JPEG images in each =\r\nimage gallery you\n&gt; create, to have unique media types too, entirely defeat=\r\ning the purpose\n&gt; and, most critically, breaking the self-descriptive messa=\r\nging\n&gt; constraint. =A0REST is based on the principle of generality here, wh=\r\nich\n&gt; is why it says, clearly in black-and-white, to re-use _standard_ medi=\r\na\n&gt; types. =A0That it also says the set of such types is evolving, is not\n&gt;=\r\n some loophole for the creation of thousands of new media types every\n&gt; mon=\r\nth, not one of which will EVER become a standard. =A0NOT REST!!!\n&gt;\n\nWell, J=\r\nan and others already commented on that, I think. And better\nthan I could. =\r\nLots of  people who knowledge at least as respectable as\nyours don&#39;t agree =\r\nwith you. Instead of just showting NOT REST maybe\nyou should add &quot;in my not=\r\nhing humble opinion&quot;.\n\nIts late and I&#39;m tired, but I don&#39;t want to finish w=\r\nithout saying that\nI  do enjoy debating with you, and I  think to debate is=\r\n a good way of\nlearning, and in any way I  feel any disrespect for you as i=\r\nt was\nimplied elsewhere.\n\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n"}}
