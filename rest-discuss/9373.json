I can do whatever I want with the origin \nserver, but REST constrains the behavior of the _connector_ that \norigin server uses to communicate with the outside world.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;(I didnâ€™t simply say â€œprior existence of the deleted resourceâ€\n&gt;because you insist that a URI and a resource are not the same\n&gt;thing.)\n&gt;\n\nBut they aren&#39;t the same thing.  A resource is a conceptual mapping, \nwhich may have one or more identifiers at a given point in time.  \nThe resource is still &quot;a thing&quot; even if one of its identifiers \nrefers to &quot;the thing of the day&quot;, because the URLs are each \na separate identifier.  Even if their semantics identify the same \nresource at a given moment, the &quot;thing of the day&quot; URL is not \nthe same thing as &quot;a thing&quot;.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
