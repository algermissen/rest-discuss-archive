However, that still leads to the question another post=\r\ner had made.. it&#39;s not guaranteed that a consumer of the api will always wo=\r\nrk. If anything it will ignore rel=3D&quot;&quot; values that it was not written to h=\r\nandle. So if the API evolves to include new rel=3D&quot;&quot; types, then only new c=\r\nonsumers that know about those ahead of time will know what they mean and w=\r\nhether or not they should follow the href link or not. That is what I think=\r\n is confusing to many. More so, I can provide my own non-known custom XML c=\r\nhunk back, complete with atom:link or my own link format, with rel/href/typ=\r\ne attributes just as well as xhtml can with an &lt;a&gt; link. So even if an API =\r\nuses XHTML as the media type, the &lt;a&gt; links (anchors) are not going to guar=\r\nantee any client consuming that api that they will evolve with additional r=\r\nel=3D&quot;&quot;\n types. Probably more important is that they should not break. If t=\r\nhe API keeps all the existing links, but adds new ones, then only new consu=\r\nmers that are written with the knowledge of the new API version/links, will=\r\n make use of them.\n\nHence why, still, I am having a hard time with the idea=\r\n of using xhtml as a response type for my data elements over just my own cu=\r\nstom xml format with links embedded in it.\n\nHere is my underlying concern. =\r\nA while ago, on this forum or maybe it was the Jersey forum..can&#39;t remember=\r\n, a few people were asking something about if their API would be considered=\r\n a true RESTful aPI. Roy and some others said &quot;nope&quot; because it didn&#39;t foll=\r\now the HATEOAS principal to some degree. My concern is, not just for me but=\r\n anyone that is working on some sort of API that they hope will catch on an=\r\nd provide business to them, that someone like Roy or other well known figur=\r\ne comes along and writes a blog about their service and says it&#39;s not RESTf=\r\nul. Somehow, that&#39;s like Steve Jobs saying Java is bad and now a crap load =\r\nof apple people think Java is bad. Hopefully not many with our technical kn=\r\nowledge will read something like that and just assume a given API being blo=\r\ngged about is no good now.. because it&#39;s not 100% RESTful according to Roy =\r\nor some others. But as much as I can, I want to provide what the knowledgea=\r\nble folks replying to this thread,\n and others like Roy and such, to look a=\r\nt any API I produce and say &quot;that is truly RESTful.&quot;.=C2=A0 So, at least fo=\r\nr me, that is why I am messing around with this on the side, making a toy b=\r\nid site, trying to see if I can provide a truly RESTful api that clients ca=\r\nn consume, evolve without breaking clients, and follows HATEOAS.
