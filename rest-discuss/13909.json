To make matters worse, you&#39;re in the Solutions\n&gt; Architecture side of the business and so you have no real authority to\n&gt; dictate a precise solution - these are &#39;information engineers&#39; after\n&gt; all, who need room to flex their creativity.  You are, however,\n&gt; allowed to define the solution architecture by way of  &quot;constraints&quot;\n&gt; on their solution.  These &quot;constraints&quot; take the form of:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) All the information must be together.\n&gt; 2) There must be a Table of Content.\n&gt; 3) All information must have a reference back to the original source.\n&gt;\n&gt; You have done this so often though, that you and these engineers have\n&gt; agreed that these constraints can be grouped together and referenced\n&gt; by a simple name, its architectural style name, instead of enumerating\n&gt; each one every time.  This is beneficial because you know that certain\n&gt; constraints, when grouped together, evoke certain properties that are\n&gt; commonly desired by your customer.  This allows you to quickly match\n&gt; up your customer&#39;s needs with some starting constraints.  Now, you&#39;ve\n&gt; previously agreed that constraints 1+2+3 above will be referred to as\n&gt; the Compilation Architectural Style.\n&gt;\n&gt; It turns out that the constraints of the Compilation Style are a good\n&gt; starting point but they don&#39;t evoke all the properties that your\n&gt; customer really wants.  They want something that&#39;s lightweight because\n&gt; they travel, they want something that&#39;s easily readable, and they also\n&gt; want something that doesn&#39;t require electricity/technology.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you begin with an instance of the Compilation Architectural Style\n&gt; and add some concrete constraints to get you from &quot;style&quot; to a real\n&gt; architecture and evoke some properties specifically desired by your\n&gt; customer.  Namely, you add the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; A) Compilation Architectural Style\n&gt;  - evokes all properties known by the style\n&gt; B) Information must be on paper\n&gt;  - evokes lack-of-technology property\n&gt; C) Information must be printed in Times New Roman\n&gt;  - evokes readability property\n&gt; D) Must be in a thin plastic binder\n&gt;  - evokes lightweight property\n&gt;\n&gt; So, you pass along the customer order and your solution architecture\n&gt; to the engineers.  Because you&#39;ve chosen to define your solution\n&gt; architecture in terms of &quot;constraints that evoke properties,&quot; you&#39;re\n&gt; able to objectively reason about them.  So, when the engineers come\n&gt; back and say that they&#39;d prefer Helvetica because, being sans-serif,\n&gt; it would save on toner cost, you can reason about how changing this\n&gt; constraint might effective your overall solution architecture.  In\n&gt; this case, that level of font-specificity was simply you trying to\n&gt; flex some control where you have none, so you acquiesce.  Likewise,\n&gt; the engineers come back and ask that you change constraint D to\n&gt; heavy-weight paper since it&#39;d be a bit lighter - you, again, agree\n&gt; that it still evokes your desired property.\n&gt;\n&gt; You deliver your solution, which makes your customer happy.  But then\n&gt; you realize that you ought to capitalize on your latest back and forth\n&gt; with the information engineers.  So, you go to the engineers and agree\n&gt; to call constraints B+C+D the Paperback Architectural Style.  In\n&gt; future requests like the original, this allows you to simply refer to\n&gt; a hybrid (Compilation Architectural Style + Paperback Architectural\n&gt; Style) solution architecture and know that the desired properties will\n&gt; be evoked.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
