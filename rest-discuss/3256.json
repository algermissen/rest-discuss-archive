GET is &quot;idempotent&quot;\nin a trivial way, because it is also &quot;safe&quot; (no side effects).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This is similar to the earlier question (last year) about Google&#39;s 1000 \n&gt; hit daily restriction, but I was wondering if anyone could offer their\n&gt; opinion on this flavour of the question...\n\nSo, is your concern that the GET on a one-retrieval-only resource is\nnot safe because it causes a state change?  I think the answer to that\ndepends on whether the client uses GET intending to unmap the\nresource.  If it&#39;s purely a server-side effect, then the semantics of GET\nare left intact.  That&#39;d be my interpretation, given the info you\npresented.\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n"}}
