So I use 2 now. 3 seems to come up very often when\n&gt; &gt; using RDF, and appears to be a namespace URI hack to generate URIs with\n&gt; &gt; fragment IDs from namespace qualified names. I haven&#39;t seen examples of\n&gt; &gt; the rest.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Tim Berners-Lee and Roy Fielding disagree on what is appropriate\n&gt; between 1. and 3. IIRC, Basically Tim&#39;s position is that &quot;1&quot; identifies\n&gt; the HTTP resource (the W3C&#39;s web page) and &quot;3&quot; identifies the &quot;logical\n&gt; concept&quot; (the W3C). I believe that Fielding thinks that 1. identifies\n&gt; the logical concept and it is up to the identifying context to be\n&gt; explicit whether it is talking about a resource or a representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to agree with Vincent that there is no reason in Web architecture\n&gt; to prefer 2. to 1. I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt to &quot;hint&quot; that the resource\n&gt; is a container. But if it isn&#39;t then it is especially annoying that it\n&gt; is difficult to leave off the slash in most web servers.\n\nI think the issue here is that 1 and 2 may identify *different* resources.\n\nWebDAV says that collections should be identified with trailing &quot;/&quot;, but\nthat a server should basically treat the same URI without slash as\nidentifying the same resource. But that&#39;s just WebDAV :-)\n\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n\n"}}
