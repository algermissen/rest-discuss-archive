I don&#39;t see a clear winner.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s inaccurate. First, Content-Range is known to be ignored by\n&gt; *origin servers*. \n\nAgain, not relevant to a discussion about new extensions to be \nimplemented by servers on an opt-in basis with a discovery mechanism.\n\n&gt; Second, I wonder how many proxies block PATCH, but\n&gt; not PUT. I know there are several that explicitly block PROPFIND, etc.\n\nAny proxy that blocks PUT also blocks AtomPub of course (my main use case).\n\n&gt; because Microsoft security bugs. There are also several that block\n&gt; everything except for GET, POST, and HEAD. If you really want to\n&gt; tunnel around obnoxious proxies, just add an X-No-Really: header to\n&gt; POST requests. This would work on TMobile USA, for instance, but PUT\n&gt; with Content-Range would not. Or use HTTPS, which is impervious to\n&gt; proxies.\n\nI suspect all of these solutions will likely be using HTTPS anyway.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several choices that don&#39;t require broken standards.\n&gt; Transparency is a good thing. There is a trade-off, in that cheap and\n&gt; obvious request routing is more prone to proxy meddling on insecure\n&gt; channels. Who desperately needs to deploy insecure PUT requests on a\n&gt; massive scale?\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
