Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; My thoughts on REST are that one aspect implies &#39;lots of nouns, few\n&gt; verbs&#39;.\n&gt; When applied to HTTP, this means each URI would reasonably support\n&gt; GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.  If the system accepted changes to availability\nvia\n&gt; HTTP, then a PUT to the URI might make sense - in this example,\n&gt; &#39;availability&#39; is a very synthesized entity and it probably doesn&#39;t\nmake\n&gt; sense.\n&gt; \n\nThis is one concept I keep trying to get my head wrapped around.  I&#39;ve\nbeen developing and using ORBs for a while, so I always leap to a very\nRPCish view.  I see this as one of the main differences between RPC and\nREST: RPC&#39;s whole reason for existing is to define NEW verbs, REST\nlimits them so that the underlying architecture can use the verbs\nintelligently when doing things like security and caching.  I have to\nkeep reminding myself that URIs do not identify methods or groups of\nmethods, they identify resources.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Something I&#39;m still thinking about is how a client acquires the URI to\n&gt; begin\n&gt; with. Either of these two approaches could return the same data, so\nthey\n&gt; are\n&gt; equivalent from that point of view - but is one easier to use from the\n&gt; client? This gets into the &quot;hyperlink .vs. generative&quot; argument. I\nlike\n&gt; the\n&gt; hyperlink approach because it has the promise of a client talking to\nthese\n&gt; two different styles of URIs without knowing or caring - more loose\n&gt; coupling. But I like the generative approach because the client may\nhave a\n&gt; fragment of information that is not part of the name/location of the\n&gt; hyperlink that has the URI, but is actually part of the value of the\nURI.\n&gt; \n\nThis is an interesting topic.  When it comes to the underlying\ncomponents in a RESTful system, the URI are opaque.  The servers,\nproxies and gateways don&#39;t care what the internal format of the URIs\nare, but the system you build on top of it could care about the details.\nHaving the client be able to work with the format of the URI might make\nfor a more powerful system.  If the system has a resource for returning\na product catalog, e.g.:\n\n&lt;products&gt;\n  &lt;product name=&quot;http://www.myinventory.foo/product/blueshoe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;product name=&quot;http://www.myinventory.foo/product/redshoe&quot;&gt;\n  ... etc ...\n&lt;/products&gt;\n\nIn that case it would be reasonable for the client to do a GET on the\nname URI and receive a product information document.  PUT/POST/DELETE\ncould also be used for modifying/deleting the product information.\n\nThe client could then also use these same product names in the query\npart of the availability URIs, as I explained earlier, like this:\nhttp://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity?product=http://www\n.myi\nnventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow\n\nIn the earlier suggestion where the following URI was used:\nhttp://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/?when=tomorro\nw\nThe &quot;blueshoe&quot; product would be known by two names by the client, the\nURI and the name &quot;blueshoe&quot;.  \n\nI guess my point is that since we already have a way of naming things in\na REST system (i.e. URIs), why not use it for every name in the system?\nThis was one of the points made in Paul Prescod&#39;s xml.com article about\na RESTful version of UDDI; why use GUIDs when you already have URIs?\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n"}}
