Unless\n&gt; the server generates a random key in a hidden field on the 202 form,\n&gt; which would effectively prevent such tunneling as a DELETE would be\n&gt; required to initiate the process.  Am I missing something else?\n&gt; \n\nRFC 2616 (10.2.3) has this to say about 202 Accepted:\n\n&quot;The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of\nthe request&#39;s current status and either a pointer to a status monitor\nor some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be\nfulfilled.&quot;\n\nThe server can be set up to expire the DELETE &quot;key&quot; after a desired\ninterval.  The message content of the 202 response can indicate, &quot;You\nhave {countdown timer} minutes to confirm deletion, otherwise this\naction will be cancelled.&quot;  The user can now estimate that their DELETE\nwill happen immediately upon clicking &quot;confirm&quot;.  The &quot;current status&quot;\nof the request is quite clearly described as, &quot;in limbo.&quot;\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
