If the business process defines acknowledgement or status\n&gt; documents\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that have &#39;accepted&#39;, &#39;rejected&#39; and &#39;undecided&#39; values, then this would\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine I think (retrieving the status document tells you if it was actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approved). If the business document set doesn&#39;t define &#39;undecided&#39; values\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then the Location header might need to reference a resource that does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet exist - and when it does exist the values within would specify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;accepted&#39; or &#39;rejected&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be legitimate to return &quot;Created&quot; with a Location header in\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; case. After all, you did create a resource--the status document you\n&gt; describe\n&gt; &gt; above.\n&gt; \n&gt; Except that then you lose the &quot;Accepted&quot; bit, which is really the most\n&gt; important one.\n\nI think I get it now. You&#39;re referring to the case where the resource has not\nyet been created, but the server knows its URI in advance, correct? Using\nLocation with Accept in that case makes sense to me, although in the particular\ncase Mike describes, I can&#39;t see why I wouldn&#39;t just create an &#39;undecided&#39;\nstatus resource at the time the business document was received. In that case I\nwould return Created (with a Location).\n\nJim\n\n=====\nJim Ancona\njim@...                     jancona@...\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTry FREE Yahoo!
