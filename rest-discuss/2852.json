Certainly the integration \ncomplexity is reduced. But OTOH the effort of reaching agreement on the \ncommon interface is increased.\n\nJust to spell this out a bit more, with multiple point-to-point \ninterfaces only two parties need to agree on any particular interface, \nwhereas all N have to agree on the common interface. I&#39;d conjecture \nthat the cost of reaching agreement is exponential in the number of \nparties to the agreement. That gives us O(N^2)*O(2^2) (ie. just O(N^2)) \ncost for agreement in the multiple interface case (O(N^2) pairs each \nhaving to reach an independent bilateral agreement) vs. O(2^N) cost for \nagreement in the common interface case.\n\nI&#39;d also conjecture that O(N^2) is a wildly pessimistic worst case \nbecause in practice not everybody needs to talk to everybody else. You \nonly need O(NlogN) edges in a random graph to get complete \nconnectivity, so O(NlogN) seems like a good guess for the typical, as \nopposed to the worst, case. FWIW ... not proof, but I&#39;ve seen data from \na major (ie. one that hasn&#39;t gone bust yet ;-) B2B exchange which \nsupports this.\n\nFor multiple interfaces that&#39;d give us,\n\n  O(NlogN)     cost of integration (ie. NlogN implemented interfaces)\n  O(NlogN)     cost of agreement   (ie. NlogN bilateral agreements)\n\nFor a common interface it&#39;d give us,\n\n  O(N)         cost of integration\n  O(2^N)       cost of agreement\n\nNotice that the cost of agreement won&#39;t scale down to the typical case \nfor the common interface in the same way as it does for multiple \ninterfaces, because the common interface still requires global \nagreement whether or not all parties need to communicate with each \nother.\n\nI guess that you know as well as I do that agreements are fraught, \nmessy, political and expensive. I take that as a hint that reducing \nthat element of the _total_ cost is likely to be a win.\n\nAnd I also think that multiple interfaces are likely to scale better in \nthe face of growth and change (yup, I realize that this runs completely \ncounter to what _everyone_ else is saying ;-). That&#39;s because changes \nare liable to be local, hence in the multiple interface case only \nrequire local renegotiation and reimplementation; and because new \nparticipants only have to reach agreements with the subset of existing \nparticipants they actually need to communicate with.\n\nOTOH, on the common interface model every change requires global \nrenegotiation and reimplementation; and new particpants either have to \nget along with what the first-movers already decided on whether or not \nit&#39;s fully appropriate for them, or alternatively simply not become \nparticipants at all (or become participants in something else). And, \nagain FWIW, I&#39;ve seen data from several B2B exchanges that this last \nproblem is a real one ... they have a tough time signing up anyone \nbeyond the initial consortia.\n\nInterestingly, the numbers above generate the exact opposite of the \ntypical &quot;network effect&quot; on the common interface model ... we actually \nend up with _decreasing_ returns to scale.\n\nThoughts?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
