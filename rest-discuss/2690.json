E.g., if I say\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  DELETE /Bob?appendage=right_arm HTTP/1.1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Is Bob just practicing his writing skills, or are we all left scratching\n&gt;&gt;our heads and saying, &quot;Where&#39;d Bob get to?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I ask because of the somewhat tricky language in 2396, Section 3.4;\n&gt;&gt;   The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by\n&gt;&gt;   the resource.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Note, &quot;to be interpreted by the resource.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;IMO, that&#39;s just unfortunate language.  As Roy said, DELETE means\n&gt;roughly &quot;remove any representations for this resource&quot;, so in that\n&gt;case - if I understand your intent - it would probably remove any\n&gt;pictures, or data, of/about his right arm.\n&gt;\n&gt;In other words, query parameters don&#39;t matter.\n&gt;\nSo, is it fair to say that for any URL x (that is, a URL of any form - \nqurey string or no), DELETE(x) deletes/removes/unmaps the same \nrepresentation that GET(x) would have returned?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n\n"}}
