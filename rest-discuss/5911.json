A few comments inline:\n\n\n &gt; ...\n&gt; HTML and to some extent HTTP support the concept of &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot;\n&gt; links. These specify relationships between the current resource and some\n&gt; other resource or resources, and are typically returned from the GET of\n&gt; the resource. These other resources can be substantially &quot;about&quot; the\n&gt; resource you are currently viewing, or vice versa. That fulfils any\n&gt; &quot;meta-&quot; requirement on data. Appropriate link types[1] can be used to\n&gt; describe the relationship between the resources. Alternatively, a piece\n&gt; of RDF or other data could be used to find the &quot;metadata&quot; for a\n&gt; particular resource. The metadata itself can be returned as any\n&gt; appropriate representation.\n&gt; ...\n\nUsing Link headers (such as in HEAD/GET) looks promising, but it doesn&#39;t \n  scale well. If a server needs to return Link headers for each piece of \nmeta data it has, the set of response headers would quickly grow. \nFurthermore, there&#39;s a potential performance problem because it may be \nexpensive to compute whether a certain property exists -- note that \nwe&#39;re talking about GET, an operation you certainly want to optimize.\n\nSo I really have my doubts about any approach where the client can&#39;t \nspecify which properties it is interested in...\n\n&gt; WebDAV attempts to wrap up discovery of these other resources and\n&gt; mechanisms for retrieving and them deep inside the HTTP protocol. While\n&gt; this may be a practial way of sidestepping the development of discovery\n&gt; and representation techniques, it limits the applicability and\n&gt; extensibility of the solution. It appears the authors of the\n&gt; specification were not able to wait for that development to take place.\n&gt; There is some justification to proceeding on the basis WebDAV did, given\n&gt; that the practical application of this metadata discover on the web is\n&gt; still an immature technology base at best today. Still, it is an\n&gt; incomplete solution and one that should not be held too far aloft as an\n&gt; example to others. It violates the Roy&#39;s principle that every resource\n&gt; needs an identifier. Metadata is data, which needs a resource, which\n&gt; needs an identifier. WebDAV replaces the use of an identifier with the\n&gt; use of additional verbs. That&#39;s a no-no.\n&gt; ...\n\n...as a matter of fact, that one is particularly easy to fix. There&#39;s \nnothing that prevents WebDAV properties from having URIs, and to be \naccessible through GET/PUT/DELETE.\n\nThere are at least two simple approaches that come to mind immediately:\n\n1) In a PROPFIND response, let the server return a Content-Location \nheader specifiying a URI where the same information get be retrieved \nfrom using GET, such as in:\n\nC: PROPFIND /xyz HTTP/1.1\n    Host: example.com\n    Depth: 0\n    Content-Type: application/xml\n\n    &lt;propfind xmlns=&quot;DAV:&quot;&gt;&lt;prop&gt;&lt;owner/&gt;&lt;/prop&gt;&lt;/propfind&gt;\n\nS: 207 Multistatus\n    Content-Type: application/xml\n    Content-Location: http://example.com/xyz;owner\n\n    ...\n\n\nThe beauty of this is that a server could assign URIs to certain set of \nfrequently queried property set and have that cached. Of course that \nwould need some more thought to ensure this works well with PUT....\n\nOr alternatively,\n\n2) In the response, let the server specify alternate URLs for each \nproperty that may have a separate URI, such as in...:\n\n&lt;D:prop xmlns:D=&quot;DAV:&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;D:comment D:content-location=&quot;...&quot;&gt;julian&lt;/D:comment&gt;\n&lt;/D:prop&gt;\n\n\nSo, the problem of the properties (or some properties) not being \nfirst-class web citizens could be simply solved. The presence of \nPROPFIND and PROPPATCH do not prevent that.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
