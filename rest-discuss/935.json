Part of your problem statement is to disallow me\n&gt; &gt; from using one of the two tools under discussion. &quot;How would you solve\n&gt; &gt; this problem in Java without using Java.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The above Java example *is* ridiculous --- it&#39;s a problem that would never occur in real life.  The\n&gt; example I&#39;ve offered is something that might easily occur --- consider densely packed regularly named\n&gt; namespaces full of opaque media objects without links between them.\n\nNow you&#39;ve given me a problem statement: &quot;How would you handle densely\npacked regularly named namespaces full of opaqaue media objects without\nlinks between them.&quot; Fine. By saying &quot;between them&quot; you&#39;ve opened the\ndoor for me to add hypertext that links the documents externally. In\nother words I&#39;m now allowed to use the tool I&#39;m supposed to compare.\n\nI&#39;m presuming I have control over the server because otherwise I can&#39;t\nsolve this using either a regular naming convention or a hypertext\nsolution. If the graphics use random names and are not linked somehow\nthen the robot is screwed either way.\n\nSo given that I control the server, I can simply write a CGI that\ngenerates an index document that creates links to the opaque objects a\nla images.google.com. If there is a reason to want to get indexes just\nof subsets of them then my CGI would do that too (c.f.\nimages.google.com). If the files are reliably named then this CGI should\ntake about an hour to write. As the service provider I can trivially\ninclude images in the set that are not physically stored on the server\nbecause the URIs can point anywhere on the Web.\n\nNow if I am JUST the spider writer and I have no opportunity to\nco-ordinate with the service creator then I may be reduced to hacking.\nI&#39;m trying to get information out that the service provider did not give\nme explicit access to. Guessing predictable filenames might be an okay\nhacking technique in some circumstances. Poking around for a hypertext\nindex might be another good technique in some circumstances. I could\nalso try to see if there was an FTP interface or perhaps a known\nsecurity hole I could exploit. ;)\n\n&gt; I&#39;m denying you your tool because, in some cases, your tool doesn&#39;t work, or because it&#39;s more work to\n&gt; make your tool work than to make other tools work.  Hammer, nails, etc.\n\nNow that you&#39;ve stated the problem as a problem, I&#39;ve applied my hammer\nand as far as I can see it works fine.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
