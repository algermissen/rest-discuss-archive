I&#39;ve been following this REST vs. &quot;document style&quot;\n&gt;     Taisuke&gt; SOAP debate (I assume RPC style is dead on both sides),\n&gt;     Taisuke&gt; and I&#39;m starting to think one of the advantages of REST\n&gt;     Taisuke&gt; is that you can actually create a hybrid web service that\n&gt;     Taisuke&gt; both human and machine can handle.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. RPC is not dead, REST and SOAP are forms of RPC.\n\nHe said &quot;document style&quot; SOAP, which is a reference to the interaction\nstyle described in the SOAP 1.2 specs.  SOAP 1.1 is RPC.  SOAP 1.2 is\na bunch of things.  REST is not a form of RPC.\n\n&gt; 2. REST is about server holds state is stateless, with SOAP you can do\n&gt;    that, but its not a dogma.\n\nREST is an architectural style that is only present when all of its\nconstraints are met.  SOAP is a protocol.\n\n&gt; 3. So REST versus SOAP is a meaningless distinction.\n\nYes, but he wasn&#39;t talking about SOAP.  He was talking about one of\nthe interaction styles described by the SOAP specifications.\n\n&gt; 4. REST is about resources that you can access by an URI. No\n&gt;    implication that it is better or easier human or machine readable.\n\nHaving the URI makes it possible for both human and machine-driven\ninteraction.  He is right -- that is one of the advantages of REST-style\napplications, and it is used every day in the form of bookmarks.\nHowever, the document-style interactions in SOAP 1.2 do allow for\nthe server to provide a URI, so the advantage only exists over those\nSOAP 1.2 resources that are poorly implemented (i.e., all of them).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
