Perhaps you can clarify.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS I am in the bay area for the next week.  I&#39;d love to meet up for coffee\nand talk about this stuff in person if you have the time.\n\n\nOn Thu, 11 Sep 2003, Tyler Close wrote:\n\n&gt; Waterken Inc. recently presented the web-calculus to HP Labs in\n&gt; Palo Alto, California. The talk explains how the web-calculus is\n&gt; derived from existing REST theory, and highlights the advantages\n&gt; of this design. The presentation generated much positive\n&gt; discussion, especially amongst HP Lab&#39;s web services group.\n&gt;\n&gt; HP Labs provided wonderful A/V support, including a video of the\n&gt; presentation. The presentation video and the slides are available\n&gt; for download from the Waterken Inc. site. See:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/HP2003/\n&gt;\n&gt; The presentation is really the first work that explains the\n&gt; functionality benefits that come from using the web-calculus. In\n&gt; explaining these benefits, the presentation also serves as a good\n&gt; primer on REST. I encourage everyone to download and view the\n&gt; video.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to everyone at HP Labs who made the presentation possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
