On the other hand, if you&#39;re\n&gt; running on a manager server, Rails and J2EE have a lot more\n&gt; capabilities than PHP.\n&gt; \nI would be curious to know what the &quot;lot more capabilities&quot; are\nthat Rails and J2EE have over PHP. While I would agree that in many\ncircumstances Rails or J2EE might be a better choice, the whole idea of\nREST (as oppossed to, say, WS-*) is that there are a small, well-defined\nset of &quot;capabilites&quot; required to share in the full richness of what the\nweb has to offer. I have seen on more than one occassion a J2EE project\nfail due to development overhead (design complexity, over-engineering,\netc.) only to have a well-thought-out PHP application save the day.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the &quot;simple and clean is good&quot; aesthetic that Rails\ninjected into this arena, I worry when folks think that Rails has some\ncorner on simple MVC/Front Controller-&gt;ORM-&gt;templating code. And when\nbooks like &quot;Advanced Rails&quot; and &quot;The Rails Way&quot; appear, I have to wonder\nif we are once again trying to abstract away the core &quot;principles&quot; of\nHTTP and good application design. A coder who &quot;knows&quot; Rails but doesn&#39;t\nreally know what&#39;s happening underneath is worrisome. To my taste\n(although I confess I have only dabbled with it), Rails seems to have a\nbit too much magic and rails-ishness going on.\n\t\t\nI use a simple ORM based on an IBM Developer Works article [0] that in\na few dozen lines of PHP, gives me all the object-relational mapping I\nneed, and I know EXACTLY how it works (and can subclass it accordingly).\n\nI am not the world&#39;s hugest fan of PHP -- I prefer Perl myself and am\nconstantly amazed at the community surrounding Python (though I have\nnot yet had the pleasure of deploying a Python web application). I just\nthink that discussions of &quot;what&#39;s the best programming language for\nweb application development&quot; are quite often asking the wrong questions.\nWhen debates about batch capabilities in the AtomPub discussions came\nup, I was charmed by a Roy Fielding post where he mentioned that he&#39;d\nlikely reach for &quot;a shell script and curl&quot; when faced with the task of\nposting 10,000 entries. It just got me thinking -- the language, to a\nlarge extent, just doesn&#39;t matter. Do what&#39;s simple & practical.\n\n--peter keane\n\n[0] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/os-php-flexobj/\n[1] http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg01117.html\n\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t say one is more Web than the other.  And I wouldn&#39;t say\n&gt; shared hosting is a better model for the Web.
