When you want to change t=\r\nhe state of a resource,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you manipulate that resource -- you don&#39;t as=\r\nsign the operation to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some other URL. The proper way of doing this i=\r\ns what you started\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with, as myself and others told you. But you are =\r\nmore concerned\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with calling what you&#39;re doing REST by playing semant=\r\nics with the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; terminology, than you are with learning REST -- this is=\r\n my opinion\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from dealing with you on rest-discuss, and observing you=\r\nr responses\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to others on rest-discuss.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you want,=\r\n I can send you hundreds of other emails I&#39;ve sent that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you can use to=\r\n discredit me. One particularly juicy one I sent a few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; years ago is wh=\r\nere I described REST as &quot;pretty&quot; URLs. Ping me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; offline if you&#39;re inter=\r\nested.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not interested in discrediting you. I dredged up this=\r\n thread\n&gt;&gt; because you&#39;re still making the same fundamental mistake to this=\r\n day --\n&gt;&gt; not because I&#39;m looking to embarass you. Everyone here but Roy h=\r\nas\n&gt;&gt; posted stuff that they&#39;re embarassed by, in retrospect, after learnin=\r\ng\n&gt;&gt; better, I&#39;m sure.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been very polite in pointing out that you=\r\nr solutions are RPC, not\n&gt;&gt; REST, in an effort to help you learn -- because=\r\n it was obvious you\n&gt;&gt; needed some help. Your response was argumentative an=\r\nd defensive, so I\n&gt;&gt; let this thread drop, figuring it didn&#39;t matter that y=\r\nou weren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; interested in learning from your mistakes. Well, my attitude =\r\nthere\n&gt;&gt; changed with the introduction of REST-*. Now it does matter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n I&#39;m here to learn what I don&#39;t know, and teach what I do know. Is your\n&gt;&gt; =\r\npurpose here only to sow unREST? Your other message this morning seems\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\no indicate that you&#39;re going to go on calling what you do REST,\n&gt;&gt; whether =\r\nit is or not. Bumping this thread is a precursor to my\n&gt;&gt; response to that =\r\nother post, precipitated by that other post.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Seriously though,=\r\n considering the plethora of different responses to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this thread, a lot=\r\n of people are performing similar thought exercises.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there =\r\ncertainly is a lot of confusion out there surrounding REST.\n&gt;&gt; The fact tha=\r\nt some people agreed with your approach doesn&#39;t amount to\n&gt;&gt; some sort of c=\r\nonsensus. REST isn&#39;t so abstract that there&#39;s no wrong\n&gt;&gt; answer. If you&#39;re=\r\n here to learn, then you need to accept (and question)\n&gt;&gt; what you&#39;re being=\r\n told, not keep insisting that you&#39;re right.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree w/ Eric. In case=\r\n it&#39;s of some use, I find this particuicularly useful:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://rajith.2r=\r\nlabs.com/2007/11/14/the-value-of-principled-design-rest-is-just-one-example=\r\n/\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is a *specific* set of constraints -- just because some alternat=\r\ne\n&gt; approach is good or useful or practical does *not* mean it is still\n&gt; R=\r\nEST, and you simply should go around calling RPC interactions\n\n(obviously, =\r\nshould be:  &quot;you simply should *not* go around calling RPC\ninteractions RES=\r\nT.)\n\n&gt; &quot;REST-*.&quot; =C2=A0In addition, REST is imbued with &quot;principled design&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; (illustrated perfectly by Subbu & Eric&#39;s exchange on this thread) --\n&gt; b=\r\nalancing specific constraints with specific resulting\n&gt; characteristics. =\r\n=C2=A0That&#39;s what makes REST and the community around it\n&gt; so compelling to=\r\n me. It also makes it particularly difficult to\n&gt; &quot;market,&quot; which is what t=\r\nhe REST-* effort seems to be about.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- peter keane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\no, providing a link to a resource doesn&#39;t make that resource\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; RESTful=\r\n. Pretend I&#39;ve just posted a link to a butt-ugly URL that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously =\r\nhas nothing to do with REST. Following the link to get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to that butt-=\r\nugly non-RESTful URL doesn&#39;t make that URL RESTful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Well c=\r\nonsider a different scenario that I had posted earlier. You\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are modeli=\r\nng a data cache. Adding and retrieving data and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; representations from t=\r\nhe cache is pretty easy to model restfully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But consider the act of pu=\r\nrging a cache or running some kind of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; eviction policy. While purging a=\r\n cache changes the state of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cache, it is in and of itself *not* st=\r\nate of the cache. Pure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; operations do exist within applications.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sure they do. But in REST, these operations are abstracted to fit the\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Uniform Interface, not turned into an endpoint for RPC operations. My\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n assessment of your character would improve considerably if you could\n&gt;&gt; ac=\r\ncept that just because a URI is linked to, doesn&#39;t make it a REST\n&gt;&gt; resour=\r\nce. This is a fundamental truth, not a matter open for debate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Futhermore, if links can&#39;t be mechanisms to modify the state of a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; res=\r\nource, you&#39;ve pretty much discounted half of the Web itself. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guarant=\r\nee you 90% of Web applications out there that are accepting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any kind o=\r\nf input are receiving that input via a Form and through an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; action URL.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who said links can&#39;t be such a mechanism? Also, who said that 9=\r\n0% of\n&gt;&gt; Web applications are RESTful? Or that using HTML forms is unRESTfu=\r\nl?\n&gt;&gt; Why is your response to my magnanimous assistance, to put words in my=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; mouth as a means of arguing against what I have to say instead of\n&gt;&gt; tr=\r\nying to learn from it, or asking me to elaborate? You&#39;re the noob,\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m t=\r\nhe guy who&#39;s been learning and applying REST for 11 years. You\n&gt;&gt; might con=\r\nsider the possibility that I actually know a good deal about\n&gt;&gt; what I&#39;m ta=\r\nlking about. Folks might be more comfortable with REST-* if\n&gt;&gt; you were to =\r\nshow an interest in accepting the help you&#39;ve been offered\n&gt;&gt; here, instead=\r\n of turning every issue into some semantic explanation of\n&gt;&gt; why your way i=\r\ns right.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I perform a GET against a URI, and receive =\r\na representation with a\n&gt;&gt; form allowing various parts of the resource to b=\r\ne changed, change some\n&gt;&gt; data, and submit the form as a POST to the same U=\r\nRI, then I&#39;ve just\n&gt;&gt; modified the state of a resource, driven by hypermedi=\r\na, by transferring\n&gt;&gt; a representation of the resource I received back to t=\r\nhe server. The\n&gt;&gt; submitted data may be sent either as an entity of some me=\r\ndia-type, or\n&gt;&gt; as a query string of name-value pairs as &#39;application/x-www=\r\n-form-\n&gt;&gt; urlencoded&#39;. Perfectly RESTful, nothing wrong with query strings\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; despite what many people say.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, if that POST contains no conten=\r\nt and/or is directed at some other\n&gt;&gt; resource instead of the one I did a G=\r\nET on, then it may well be\n&gt;&gt; hypermedia-driven, but it isn&#39;t REST, as REST=\r\n has more constraints than\n&gt;&gt; just HEAS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Eric\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n\n"}}
