Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=112610298\r\n\r\nI am having a debate with a colleague.  I am arguing that when SOAP is\nused you POST to the SOAP server, and it then looks inside the SOAP\nmessage to determine which application to delegate to.  Thus, when you\ninvoke a Web service the URI is to the SOAP server, not to the target\napplication (i.e., resource).  For example, if a company has deployed\nthree Web services then despite which Web service a client wishes to\ninvoke, the URI will always be the same, for example:\n\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/soap/server\n\nWhat differs, of course, is the contents of the SOAP message.  I argue\nthat this hiding of the identity of the target resource in the SOAP\nmessage is a disadvantage of SOAP (one of the key disadvantages of\nSOAP).  \n\nMy colleague argues that this is not true.  He says that a client can\nprovide the URI directly to the target Web service (resource), for\nexample:\n\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/parts\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/part/00345\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/purchase-order\n\nHe claims that he has done this using WebLogic. Here&#39;s a quote from him: \n\n&quot;We were able to have 2 web services on the same machines with different\nURI, using WebLogic.\n\nI haven&#39;t used WebLogic, so I can&#39;t verify his statement. \n\nCan someone settle this debate please?  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
