So, for\n&gt; &gt; example, sending an email message with SMTP is RESTful (except for the\n&gt; &gt; stateful SMTP preamble of HELO, RCPT FROM, MAIL TO exchanges).\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh? That&#39;s a pretty big exception; how much of a typical SMTP\n&gt; protocol conversation is left?\n\nWell, picture using SMTP via an HTTP gateway; what&#39;s RESTful is the\nHTTP/SMTP layer, not the SMTP/SMTP one, since the SMTP details of HELO,\nRCPT, etc.. are hidden to the clients of the gateway.\n\nFWIW, this is basically how FTP support is built into browsers; the\nuser on clicks a link (GET), yet several FTP commands are sent as a\nresult.\n\n&gt; This got my attention because I am in interested in integrating URIs\n&gt; with email, as seen in Backpack and Jotspot, and other wikis that let\n&gt; you send email to a page. I wonder whether its appropriate to use an\n&gt; SMTP address of\n&gt; \n&gt; $path@$hostname\n&gt; \n&gt; given the URI\n&gt; \n&gt; http://$hostname/$path/\n&gt; \n&gt; (escaped appropriately of course)\n\nSure.  You&#39;ll lose some of the benefit of the http URI, since, for\nexample, the mailto scheme isn&#39;t hierarchical.  But yah, that sounds\nlike a good idea to me.\n\n&gt; Does this qualify as &#39;asynchronous REST&#39;? I&#39;m imagining treating that\n&gt; whole SMTP message as a POST to the resource identified by the SMTP\n&gt; address (http://$hostname/$path/ above).\n\nYup, exactly.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
