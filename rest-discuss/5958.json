The session state remains the same, unless it&#39;s \nexplicitly changed, too.\n&gt;  will always return  \n&gt; the same representation.\nWell, according to Fielding:\n&gt; &quot;5.1.3 Stateless\n&gt;\n&gt; We next add a constraint to the client-server interaction:\n&gt; communication must be stateless in nature, as in the\n&gt; client-stateless-server (CSS) style of Section 3.4.3 (Figure 5-3),\n&gt; such that each request from client to server must contain all of the\n&gt; information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take\n&gt; advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is\n&gt; therefore kept entirely on the client.&quot;\nHe says &quot;each request from client to server must must contain all of the \ninformation necessary to understand the request.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t say that \ninformation must be in the URI.  It could be in a header, e.g. an \nAccept-* header, or a Cookie header, or even in the body of the request, \nright?\n&gt;    That is, it should always be possible for  \n&gt; the client to explicitly Represent what State a Request is relying upon.\n&gt;   \nI&#39;m not sure what that means.  Any representation could represent any \nstate.  So the number &quot;1&quot; could represent... anything.\n&gt; That may not be entirely accurate, but hopefully that points you in  \n&gt; the right direction (or else someone will redirect me).\n&gt;   \nThanks, but I still think there are some hidden assumptions I&#39;m missing....\n\n-- \n\nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
