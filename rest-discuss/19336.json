Some of\n&gt; the fields are basic flags and others are lists=\r\n of items that could be\n&gt; empty or up to as many as 100.  There isn&#39;t reall=\r\ny any hierarchy to the\n&gt; data or any value to expose them as resources indi=\r\nvidually.  Providing\n&gt; the data in a POST would work but then the concern i=\r\ns we need to store\n&gt; the output of the formula, which also contains a good =\r\namount of fields,\n&gt; on the server in order to respond to the future GET.  \n=\r\n\nWhich future GET? Why not just POST the query and consume the result? Yes,=\r\n you loose visibility and thus cacheability of the result, but given the my=\r\nriad of parameters reasonable cache hit ratio seems unlikely anyhow.\n\nSo, e=\r\nither I am missing the point, or you should just\n\nPOST /service/calculator\n=\r\nContent-Type: application/vnd.foo.reimbursement (or whatever)\n\n&lt;calc-params=\r\n&gt;\n ...\n&lt;/calc-params&gt;\n\n200 Ok\nContent-Type: application/vnd.foo.reimburseme=\r\nnt\n\n&lt;calc-result&gt;\n ...\n&lt;/calc-result&gt;\n\nand be done. Add boxes at will to sc=\r\nale. It&#39;s ok, to just use POST.\n\nIf you need caching, because the result wi=\r\nll be re-used, you could store the result (as a static file, maybe), assign=\r\n it a URI and tell the client (and caches on the way) about it:\n\n\n200 Ok\nCo=\r\nntent-Type: application/vnd.foo.reimbursement\nContent-Location: http://stat=\r\nic.foo.org/calculation-resuts/7qjy6s\nLocation: http://static.foo.org/calcul=\r\nation-resuts/7qjy6s\n\n&lt;calc-result&gt;\n ...\n&lt;/calc-result&gt;\n\nThat way, you could=\r\n share the static resource with other &#39;users&#39; and use a phalanx of caches (=\r\nreplicated using a standard cache protocol) to serve up the result in the f=\r\nuture.  \n\n----\n\nIn the end, you are right though. Keeping the result on the=\r\n server creates server side state - but this is ok, if you assign it a URI.=\r\n And yes, you essentially need to distribute that across all servers in ord=\r\ner to scale. This is a normal situation, such as with accounts of new users=\r\n or uploaded photos to Flickr.\n\nOne way to deal with that is caches that re=\r\nplicate, another is trading the &#39;C&#39; of the CAP theorem for the &#39;A&#39;, use a N=\r\noSQL DB in the backend and deal with the (occasional if at all) lack of con=\r\nsistency.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; We are eventually\n&gt; going to feed this=\r\n service into a larger application and would like to\n&gt; be able to scale as =\r\nwe get large amounts of data fed through.  If the\n&gt; result data is stored i=\r\nn memory, we would lose the ability to scale out,\n&gt; and in essence would ma=\r\nke the system not &quot;stateless&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; My developers think that using SOAP so =\r\nthat the result of formula can be\n&gt; returned in one transaction is the best=\r\n way to solve this problem.  I\n&gt; believe in REST but I don&#39;t&#39; know if addin=\r\ng a database to hold the\n&gt; result data outweighs the benefits or if using a=\r\n overloaded POST is\n&gt; better than the SOAP solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-di=\r\nscuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen  wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; And if you really hav=\r\ne to:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On 22.04.2013, at 20:56, &quot;scott vernon&quot; vern33nova@... wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; so where would we store the intermediate data\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Build up the s=\r\ntate on the client.
