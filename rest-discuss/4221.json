This makes a lot\n&gt; of sense to me as a programmer. Query strings are used to define\n&gt; &#39;virtual resources&#39; so what you&#39;re saying here, I think, is delete the\n&gt; result of the query &#39;GET /list/42?customer=9&#39;. Now that I think about\n&gt; this strategy of operating on query strings is very powerful. This\n&gt; provides a mean for doing mass deletions eg &#39;DELETE\n&gt; /list/42?nameLike=smi%&#39; and for doing mass updates.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the tip.\n&gt; - Buko Obele\n&gt; \n\nThis was more or less the question I posed earlier\nregarding using URLs with queries as the target of\nrequests other than get.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4098\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4131\n\nI assume that Roy&#39;s answer applies here also.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4100\n\nI would be interested in hearing a reply to Mark\nThompson&#39;s question,\n   &quot;...is path parameterisation considered harmful&quot;\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4115\n\nand if its not harmful, how should it be used?\nAs Justin Sampson pointed out ...\n\n&quot;Tim Berners-Lee wrote a tiny bit about how it might be used:\n\n    &lt;http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#matrix&gt;&quot;\n\n\nCan anyone comment further?\n\nDonald.\n\n  \n\n"}}
