There should really be a REST IRC channel...\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 29, 2002, at 01:24  PM, Paul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt; Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The operation is semantically identical to PUT, so why use POST?\n&gt;&gt; There&#39;s idempotence issues too, of course; a script author\n&gt;&gt; expects overwrite, so they should get it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that PUT is the right thing semantically. The only reason I\n&gt; consider POST is because if a person designs a web service without\n&gt; specifically taking into a account either REST or XSLT that service is\n&gt; likely to accept POST, not PUT. PUT isn&#39;t supported by either HTML or\n&gt; WSDL, so the GET/POST have become a popular pair!\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose I would still end up going over to the PUT side because if\n&gt; XSLT will just ignore the result of the POST then it will be\n&gt; incompatible with may POST-based services anyhow.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
