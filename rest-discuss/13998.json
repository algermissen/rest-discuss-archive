Clearly, such descriptions are contrary=\r\n to REST&#39;s  \n&gt; evolvability goals because any prescriptive information abou=\r\nt the  \n&gt; server limits its desired evolvability.\n&gt; \n&gt; While this is fine w=\r\nhen the client has human or human-like  \n&gt; capabilities to mediate between =\r\nthe overall client&#39;s intentions (e.g.  \n&gt; &#39;buying a book&#39;) and the actual r=\r\nuntime-discovered state machine of  \n&gt; the application, problems do arise w=\r\nhen the communication model is  \n&gt; applied to machine to machine interactio=\r\nns. Especially when REST is  \n&gt; applied in an enterprise context where budg=\r\nets and legal issues are at  \n&gt; stake.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that an overall =\r\ngoal like &#39;buying a book&#39; must assume  \n&gt; the availability of certain media=\r\n types, extensions, links, etc. and  \n&gt; certain available state transitions=\r\n at certain points in the overall  \n&gt; interaction. Without such assumptions=\r\n it would be impossible to come  \n&gt; up with client side code that performs =\r\nthe overall goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; With human clients the situation is actually quite t=\r\nhe same but less  \n&gt; visible because the human user is sort of in permanent=\r\n browsing mode,  \n&gt; walking the Web, discovering new things, etc. When unde=\r\nrlying  \n&gt; expectations fail (Ooops, where did that 1-Click link go?)  \n&gt; c=\r\nompensating action can be taken. For example: call the hotline or  \n&gt; chang=\r\ne the online shop.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can put some amount of flexibility into a machi=\r\nne client, but it  \n&gt; is inevitable that at some point assumptions end up i=\r\nn a place (source  \n&gt; code, configuration) that will cause runtime failure =\r\nwhen the  \n&gt; assumptions about the server turn out to be wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; This i=\r\ns not so much of a problem in contexts, where budget and legal  \n&gt; issues a=\r\nre of minor importance (e.g. when I do some fun-coding to  \n&gt; interact with=\r\n Amazon&#39;s APIs) but as soon as you pay serious amounts  \n&gt; for the use of a=\r\nn API or when liability issues are involved things are  \n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n\nT=\r\nhere are a lot of assumptions here about the limitations of machine to mach=\r\nine RESTful interaction. I have never seen any proof of these limitations. =\r\nIt just seems that because the general REST community can&#39;t figure out how =\r\nto design good media types for machine to machine interaction, the consensu=\r\ns is that it isn&#39;t possible.\n\nThe thing is that I work in an industry where=\r\n a media type for machine to machine, RESTful interaction has been availabl=\r\ne for years. Many client implementations are commercially available and all=\r\n sorts of applications have been written by 3rd parties *after* the media t=\r\nype was designed, and the clients were built and sold. The clients are comp=\r\nletely decoupled from the services because the services didn&#39;t exist when t=\r\nhe clients were written. That is the way the web is; that is how REST is su=\r\npposed to work.\n\nThe media type I&#39;m talking about is CCXML: http://www.w3.o=\r\nrg/TR/ccxml/\nThe industry I&#39;m talking about is telecom -- where 5 9s are ex=\r\npected otherwise you get sued for millions. So I have a hard time buying in=\r\nto these sorts of arguments when it seems that I&#39;ve been working with a cou=\r\nnter example for years.\n\nI&#39;ve been encouraging folks on this list to look a=\r\nt CCXML for a long time, but as far as I know I haven&#39;t convinced anyone to=\r\n spend the time. Hey -- maybe CCXML isn&#39;t RESTful after all; it certainly h=\r\nas a different flavor than most of the media types coming from the REST com=\r\nmunity. I&#39;d love to get all of your feedback; maybe I&#39;m missing something. =\r\nBut if it isn&#39;t then perhaps the as yet to be formally defined style behind=\r\n CCXML is a good alternative to REST for machine to machine interaction. It=\r\n certainly seems to have many of the properties most readers of this list a=\r\nre looking for.\n\nAnyways, I encourage you to take a look at CCXML. I think =\r\nit will be worth your time, and I think that the discussions that might ens=\r\nue will be very valuable.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
