There is also a part that let you build the url structure and\nmethod handlers in xml and script, but that might not be what you are\nlooking for (but xml and script do make for easy visual communication).\n\nI also have some examples of a servlet using that approach to expose LDAP\nand NNTP through simple URIs and as XML.\nhttp://www.xmldatasource.com:7779/xds/ldap2xml/db.debian.org/ou=users/\n\nThere is also a project to do a &#39;canonical HTTP API for JMS&#39; on sourceforge\n(java & servlet based):\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/destiny/\n\nSomething I haven&#39;t done but would like to is to write an HTTP client\nlibrary in Java that is an application API rather than a protocol API -\nrather than talking about headers and stuff, talk about resources,\nrepresentations, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
