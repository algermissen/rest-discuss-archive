If you need a FORM to edit a resource then you can have the server\n&gt;&gt;    supply a FORM as part of the representation of the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you mean here that I&#39;d get back say two div&#39;s, one for viewing the \n&gt; resource, and one for editing it and I&#39;d use CSS/Javascript to turn on the one \n&gt; I want? \n\nThat is certainly one way.\n\nYou don&#39;t NEED to turn the FORM off either.\n\nI have an accounting system that I wrote RESTfully. There is a url:\n\n   /account/\n\nwhich displays all the accounts in summary form (their balance for\nrecent years).\n\nIt also displays a FORM for creating a new account. If an account is\ncreated it is a subsidiary of the /account/ url; eg:\n\n  /account/26\n\nis a particular account.\n\n\n&gt; Or do you have in mind some way of telling the server which one you\n&gt; want it to give you but not changing the URL?\n\nYou can do it that way as well. Just add a parameter, say editform, to\nthe url, eg:\n\n   http://server/someresource?editform\n\nThere are other options as well:\n\n- you could provide an editform by some content negotiation rule (your\n  resources are always XML and your edit form is always HTML, say\n\n- or by having a Javascript function construct an edit form on some\n  signal from the user.\n\n\nThe point is that REST really doesn&#39;t cover this. REST is about the\ninteractions between resources and representations and how you get\nfrom one to the other. It&#39;s not about the specific of how you create\ndata in some form.\n\nYou might want to look at what the microformat people are doing:\n\n  http://microformats.org\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
