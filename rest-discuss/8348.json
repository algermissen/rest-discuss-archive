In particular, it is very useful when the UA\nis *not* a browser. This is often the case in an enterprise\nenvironment where you are exposing services for integration purposes,\ni.e. I am using it instead of WS-* in the enterprise. I am willing to\nbe corrected, but I get the sense that many on this list are targeting\nbrowsers over the web - a quite different proposition.\n\nFor me, the critical aspect of a content-negotiation implementation is\nto have a representation format that is the superset of all\ninformation about the resource (both data and metadata). I typically\nuse RDF for this purpose. Then, if an alternate representation format\nis requested, the task is simply to cut down the data to the subset\nrequired for the alternate representation.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
