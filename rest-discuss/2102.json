The\n&gt; HTTP GET method allows a client to cleanly retrieve an XML document.\n&gt; The HTTP PUT method allows the client to cleanly send an XML document to\n&gt; the server.\nThe operation is not &#39;send&#39; - it is &#39;set&#39;. The server doesn&#39;t have as much\nfreedom to choose how to handle the request. The constraint is that a GET\nwill return a representation of the resource that should be the same state\nas what was PUT.\n\n&gt; The HTTP POST method, however, requires name/value pairs in\n&gt; the payload.\nNot true. POST supports Content-Type. I&#39;ve used it to post xml for years.\n\n&gt; A client could submit an XML document using a name/value\n&gt; pair, where the value is an XML document.  However, that doesn&#39;t seem\n&gt; very clean.  In an XML-based Web I just want to exchange XML documents.\nIf it is still the &#39;Web&#39;, then you want to access and control resources.\nExchanging documents is one use of the Web.\n\n&gt; The payload is clean - just an XML document.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to (boldly) assert that the name/value pair style is a\n&gt; remnant of HTML and is not suitable for an XML-based world!  Thus, I\n&gt; propose that in The New Web that HTTP POST be dropped.\nRe-examine the meaning of POST and PUT - I think you will find that their\nmeanings are necessary:\n GET = get\n PUT = set\n POST = add\n DELETE = remove\n\nThese are &#39;generic&#39; - they apply to all resources - but that does not mean\nthey are &#39;ambiguous&#39; or open to wildly different server interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
