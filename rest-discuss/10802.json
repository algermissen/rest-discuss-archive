The HTTP RFC says that DELETE is to delete the resource at\n&gt; the URI said. Popping is deleting the topmost uri. Allowing Deletes\n&gt; directly on elements would be wrong as that would allow you to delete\n&gt; any element( unless you hack through a solution in which every\n&gt; resource checks whether it is the topmost resource before getting\n&gt; deleted).\n\nIt would be very helpful to envision how this GET/DELETE scheme would\nactually work.\n\nSo two clients make a GET request to /top, do they both get to see the\nsame element?  That would be a pick, but if both deleted /top, the\nstack would be two elements short, and only one was ever seen.\n\nOr each GET is a different element and somehow the DELETE is\ncorrelated to that GET.  Where is that state conveyed?\n\nAssaf\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Delete the TOP just does that .. delete the current top. How does it\n&gt; matter if after that another element becomes the top?\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, there might be arguments against what I just said , but the\n&gt; increase in coupling caused by any other solution imho makes for an\n&gt; overwhelming choice for this option.\n&gt;\n&gt; In short, I like the OPs solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
