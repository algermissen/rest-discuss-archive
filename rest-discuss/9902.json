that way, it works for any public pages in your app.\nbut i can see how you might use it to start the login process, etc...\n\nkaren:\nyes, if you plan on creating resources that *depend* on the preference\ndata, they will not bookmark well. however, the resource that responds\nto the /user/current/ request can also return anonymous information.\nthis would make the pages &#39;work&#39; for bookmarked content, but possibly\ncontain different data.\n\nfor example, if i try to bookmark  my home page (that includes\nuser/current/ data via ajax) and share that with pals (&quot;look at what&#39;s\nin my shopping cart!&quot;). but that&#39;s the same if i tried to share a\ndirect link to my cart with my pals, too.\n\nthe key is to be sure to *not* do what JoAnn.com does - make *public\ncontent* dependent on the current user, right?\n\nmca\n\n\nOn 12/2/07, Karen &lt;karen.cravens@...&gt;

JoAnn.com, a pretty major player in the sewing/craft industry, hands\n&gt; out URLs that include a session ID.  If I had a nickel for every time\n&gt; someone had enthusiastically posted an URL in a craftblog, referring\n&gt; readers to this page or a variant thereof:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.joann.com/joann/common/session_expire_error.jsp;jsessionid=U0VRVRT1ITB0YP4SY5NFAFR50LD3KUPU\n&gt;\n&gt; ... I would be a rich person. (And go to that link, and notice where\n&gt; the &quot;click here&quot; takes you. Obviously the inclusion of the sessionid\n&gt; is *not* the only problem going on there. Yikes. Can you *get* more\n&gt; annoying than that?)\n&gt;\n&gt; But I digress.  The inability to share links was the main reason I\n&gt; keep user-specific URLs an absolute minimum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
