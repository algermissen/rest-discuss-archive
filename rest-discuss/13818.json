There should be hypermedia telling you  \nwhich type to send (e.g. =\r\na form).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is: how the client knows what parameters it sho=\r\nuld  \n&gt; submit to the server to create a new resource ?\n\nThe allowed parame=\r\nters should be in the hypermedia spec (that is: in  \nprose). Just stating t=\r\nhem in a from (as you do it with HTML) is not  \nenough, since the client im=\r\nplementation has to &#39;know&#39; the meaning.  \nThat means, the parameter must be=\r\n known at implementation time and  \nthat means it must be in a spec.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; is it a &quot;previous knowledge&quot; ?\n\nIn the sense of what I say above - yes.\n\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of AtomPub, there is a generic type used to create  \n&gt; reso=\r\nurces.. it is always the same type navigating between the client  \n&gt; and th=\r\ne server..\n\nWhich type?\n\n\n&gt; but in case I want to use different types, how =\r\nto inform the client  \n&gt; about the form contents ?\n\nAtomPub provides the &lt;a=\r\nccept&gt; element for this purpose.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * I am in this learning curve here, s=\r\no please understand and help if  \n&gt; I am just getting out of the curve :)\n\n=\r\nKeep reading and posting to verify your understanding. REST is  \nactually v=\r\nery simple - it just takes so much time have that sudden  \nshift in your br=\r\nain. The good thing is that you really notice it when  \nyou indeed make suc=\r\nh a twist.\n\nI find it helpful to think about how you would implement a clie=\r\nnt for  \nAmazon. Think what the client would need to understand from the  \n=\r\nhypertext received from Amazon and what that implies for the media  \ntypes =\r\nthat would have to be defined to make Amazon non-human  \nconsumable. And av=\r\noid  lotsof fixed URIs and semantic URIs (those that  \nlead to hardcoding i=\r\nn the client the URI construction process).\n\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n---=\r\n-----------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@acm.=\r\norg\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.co=\r\nm\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
