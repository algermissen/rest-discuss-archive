But if you don&#39;t drill down to see those ways, it doesn&#39;t seem like\n&gt; much at 50,000 feet.\n\nThe benefits of well-designed URIs is a different matter to the benefits \nof canonical URIs. Indeed one reason for having canonical URIs is to \nmerge the benefits of a well-designed URI and a URI whose structure is \nforced upon you by other criteria or artefacts of implementation by \nhaving one permanently redirect to the canonical one.\n\n&gt; 5.) Further, the URI Opacity concern is related to *machines*, not humans\n&gt; because humans have an error correcting mechanism called intelligence.  If\n&gt; they go to the &quot;/cart/&quot; URL and it displays information about wheelbarrows\n&gt; instead of a shopping cart, the human can figure it out and continue\n&gt; looking. The machine is yet to be capable until programmed in advance for\n&gt; that problem.\n\nNo, the opacity concern is related to humans because if they phone and \ncomplain that they got information about wheelbarrows when they should \nhave gotten a shopping cart I&#39;m going to want to hit someone (not \nreally, I get far worse calls than that, but they do make me want to hit \nsomeone). This is because humans have an error-generating mechanism \ncalled stupidity.\n\nResponding reasonably to guesswork is great. I strive to design URI \nschemes as intuitively as I can. But I will delete any bug report about \nguessed URIs not working unless its very definitely marked as a \nsuggested enhancement.\n\n\n"}}
