And without HTML\nedit mode as a compelling use case for a PUT command, the case for it\nlost mindshare. It probably never occurred to anybody that it would be\nneeded in HTML &lt;form method=&#39;&#39;&gt; for things like Wiki.\n\nSo, PUT support began and ended with TimBL and the W3C. Nowadays the\nbest hope is things like the Mozile Mozilla plug-in, which is actually\nquite promising, but needs development.\n\nhttp://mozile.mozdev.org/\n\nMost of the innovation was about things like &lt;blink&gt;, &lt;marquee&gt;, Java\napplets and proprietary DHTML. There was nothing about other RESTful\nissues such as:\n\n- a graceful way to maintain client-side state, like a per-site shopping\ncart,\n- authentication,\n- good support for PKI.\n\nI could go on but I don&#39;t mean to flog a dead horse. Firefox/Mozilla is\nthe last great hope in my opinion. Camino makes me wish Apple had rowed\nin behind them with Safari.\n\n"}}
