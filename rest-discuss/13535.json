That would be RPC.\nThe Sample URI does=\r\n not actually represent RPC. If you write:\n/del/person/{id} and del is a ve=\r\nrb telling the server to delete, then you are using RPC. If you write:\n/app=\r\n/person/{id}?method=3Dcreate then you are using RPC. Got it?\n\n&gt; Is that tru=\r\ne? for what they (people on that thread) say, the client should be unaware =\r\nof the URL&#39;s, kinda &quot;spidering&quot; the API through its linked resoruce rather =\r\nthan directly making the calls to an specific URL. \n\nAnd here comes the sec=\r\nond one. URIs are a way to reference a resource, a name that is actually us=\r\ned by the SERVER! Yes, URIs are meaningless to the client. A person may be =\r\nreferenced as /app/person/{id} or as /app/{person_id}. Amazon was used as a=\r\nn example in this thread, well that is a perfect example. Server can change=\r\n the the URI whenever it wants, and the URI may contain semantics for the s=\r\nerver, but not for the client. Clients that use templates to create their U=\r\nRIs I may say are not totally RESTfull.\nClients do not need to compose URIs=\r\n, they need to discover them in the payload, which content and type are neg=\r\notiated, and then use the HTTP semantics to operate against them.\nBe carefu=\r\nl with semantics, many people think that the content (Hypermedia) you got s=\r\nhould tell you the operations. That is under discussion, and I had some ide=\r\nas still not very mature about the case.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If this is the case..  Shall=\r\n we rather say that there&#39;s no RESTful API&#39;s but RESTful clients of a parti=\r\ncular API?\n\nThere is not such things as RESTFull clients. REST is a style f=\r\nor networked app&#39;s architectures. The API boom, to me, is just a way to get=\r\n the REST name on top of a non-REST architecture, just by saying &quot;Ok, I kno=\r\nw my app is built upon a SOA style, but I&#39;ve just created a REST API...&quot; wh=\r\nen they only mean they exposed the app to web using fixed URIs. See the poi=\r\nnt?\n&gt; \n&gt; Why many people (like myself, in the case that things stated above=\r\n are true) have such a misconception of REST?\n&gt;\n\nGood question. I once wrot=\r\ne that the regular developer was so tired of SOAP web services, that when s=\r\nomeone reading the REST dissertation tried to explain it using a back and f=\r\north interchange of URIs as an example, everybody though REST was as easy a=\r\ns defining URIs. REST is NOT easy, and not thought as a replacement for SOA=\r\nP services, and it is NOT suitable for all Apps in the web. \nThe URI guys, =\r\nI put them into a category named &quot;URI Jugglers&quot; in the thread \nhttp://tech.=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/13422 \nThere are other types, y=\r\nou can go and check how do you see REST, to see if you fit in one. No one r=\r\nead it or no one wanted to write in which category they fit, or if they act=\r\nually think one of the categories is right. \n\nSaludos!\n\nWilliam Martinez Po=\r\nmares\nhttp://acoscomp.com/wblog\n\n\n"}}
