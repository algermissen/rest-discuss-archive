For us this means creating some tests which  \n&gt; exercise particular workflows that a service supports (decision  \n&gt; points are advertised through different rel values ins links).\n&gt;\n&gt; By programming a client with some goal and rules towards reaching  \n&gt; that goal, we can then let it loose against a service and watch as  \n&gt; it drives towards a conclusion.\n\nAre you testing whether the client can actually reach the intended goal?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s been nice for us (and has demonstrated the value of  \n&gt; hypermedia for describing business protocols) has been that we wrote  \n&gt; one set of tests per service (typically in Java) whereas for  \n&gt; illustrative purposes the book has multiple implementations of each  \n&gt; service (Java and .NET typically).\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve used both custom media types and common media types  \n&gt; (especially Atom) for our services and in either case our black box  \n&gt; tests have worked, providing both positive assertions that services  \n&gt; work, and have uncovered bugs in our differing implementations.\n\nHmm, sorry, I think I made a mistake by saying &quot;black box testing&quot;,  \nwhich you (rightly) took as implementation testing.\n\nWhat I intended to ask was whether a RESTful service could ever  \nproduce a response that could be considered &#39;wrong&#39;.\n\nExcluding server crashes and bugs like sending ill formed XML etc.\n\nJan\n\nP.S. The implicit theme being &#39;a RESTful service can never send a  \nwrong response because the client must expect to be sent anything&#39;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
