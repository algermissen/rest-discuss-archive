My intent was to include\n&gt; : the possibility of content negotiation in my question. A more  \n&gt; pointed\n&gt; : question, then, would be: By Roy&#39;s definition of resource as  \n&gt; mapping,\n&gt; : is it true that:\n&gt; :\n&gt; : http://www.artima.com/articles\n&gt; : and\n&gt; : http://www.artimal.com/articles?p=4\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Must at any time t return the same representation given the same\n&gt; : request headers to refer to the same resource?\n&gt; :\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve locked out all variation by that approach, then\n&gt; the answer should be yes.  But I don&#39;t know for sure that content\n&gt; negotiation is deterministic.\n&gt;\n&gt; A safer way to go is to pretend that you have the all-powerful client\n&gt; that is able to fetch all possible representations from both URI at  \n&gt; all\n&gt; times.  Then for all times t, the set of reps from each URI must\n&gt; match.  That&#39;s as precise as I can say it without resorting to\n&gt; formalisms.\n&gt;\nOK. Thanks for the explanation.\n\nI think this is the definition from Roy&#39;s thesis:\n\nMore precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership  \nfunction MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or  \nvalues, which are equivalent. The values in the set may be resource  \nrepresentations and/or resource identifiers. A resource can map to  \nthe empty set, which allows references to be made to a concept before  \nany realization of that concept exists -- a notion that was foreign  \nto most hypertext systems prior to the Web [61]. Some resources are  \nstatic in the sense that, when examined at any time after their  \ncreation, they always correspond to the same value set. Others have a  \nhigh degree of variance in their value over time. The only thing that  \nis required to be static for a resource is the semantics of the  \nmapping, since the semantics is what distinguishes one resource from  \nanother.\n\nSo at any time t, the values in the set must be the same for any two  \nURIs that claim to reference the same resource. Therefore page four  \nand page one of my articles list are two different resources as the  \nterm resource is used in REST. And therefore I think that given  \nSteve&#39;s &quot;REST for the rest of us&quot; article is attempting to explain  \nREST, he should perhaps not say things like:\n\nGET \t/resource \tRetrieve the entire resource.  Query parameters may  \nbe available to retrieve only parts of the resource.\n\nFor lack of a better term, and since &quot;resource,&quot; &quot;entity&quot; and  \n&quot;representation&quot; are taken, I might call the conceptual thing an  \n&quot;object&quot; and its query-param-accessed variations &quot;views.&quot; /articles  \nrefers to a conceptual collection of articles object at Artima, and  \nyou can get different views of that object by adding query  \nparameters, such as /articles?p=4 or /articles?t=java. Each one of  \nthose views is a different resource in REST terms.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
