It doesn&#39;t sound idempotent the way I read it.\n\nThe reference to outbox made me think of Pauls description of the REST\nimplementation of email (http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/), so I&#39;m\nassuming something like the following:\n\n  A &#39;GET /myqueue&#39; transfers a representation of the queue resource.  This\nwould have a list of URIs identifying each queue entry e.g.\n\n&lt;queue&gt;\n    &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/1&#39;/&gt;\n    &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/2&#39;/&gt;\n     ...\n    &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/n&#39;/&gt;\n&lt;/queue&gt;\n\nA GET on a queue entry (&#39;myqueue/2&#39;) returns reference to a queue entry, the\ncontents of which would depend on how restrictive the queue needs to be,\ne.g. if it is ok for others to discover the end message then it would return\nsomething like:\n\n&lt;queue_entry message_href=&#39;/uri/to/real/message&#39;/&gt;\n\nbut if you want one and only one consumer to discover the message it might\nreturn an empty entry and only return the message URI on a successful DELETE.\n\nA DELETE on a queue entry does the obvious and removes the message from the\nqueue, returning the queue entry or message URI as a description of the\nresult, unless of  course someone else has pulled the entry from the queue,\nin which case it returns the appropriate status code (404?)\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
