We can in various ways\n=\r\n&gt; build behavioral interfaces as data representations. Seb gave good\n&gt; exam=\r\nples using his rel links, another good example would be modelling\n&gt; a resou=\r\nrce as a state machine. These solutions do however offer a\n&gt; rather large i=\r\nmpedance mismatch with that of our behavioral system\n&gt; (often times creatin=\r\ng a large language gap as an example).\n&gt; \n&gt; When does this impedance mismat=\r\nch become appropriate to take on?\n&gt; \n&gt; Greg\n\nSo, the first step is to recog=\r\nnize this is not at all a REST question.  Put it to you this way, at what p=\r\noint does it make more sense to write things declaratively than imperativel=\r\ny?\n\nWith declarative, you are saying &quot;be&quot;; with imperative, you are saying =\r\n&quot;do&quot;.\n\nThis is a pretty huge consequence.  In order to be, you need to answ=\r\ner what.  In order to do, you need to answer how.  If you can make the leap=\r\n from do to be, then &lt;s&gt;do&lt;/s&gt; be it.  For one, I think you can reason abou=\r\nt reliability of your systems much easier if everything is declarative.  Mo=\r\nst software problems are related to poorly configured software, in part bec=\r\nause we often don&#39;t know what our settings do, or we can&#39;t easily understan=\r\nd how our production environments differ from development environments.\n\nFo=\r\nr me, the value of a declarative system is that my CEO can query and drill-=\r\ndown into any aspect of my system&#39;s design.  There are no blackboxes; just =\r\nmathematical reasoning.\n\nI also think &quot;modeling a resource as a state machi=\r\nne&quot; is an oversimplification.  There are many ways to implement a state mac=\r\nhine, not all of them correct from a decoupling standpoint.  Moreover, mode=\r\nling programs as Finite State Automata is not easy, however once done corre=\r\nctly the end result is highly robust software that correctly reuses itself.=\r\n  You can very easily stick guards everywhere in your state machine and the=\r\nn say, &quot;Look at this state machine I built&quot;, and &quot;mommy might stick it on t=\r\nhe fridge&quot;, but you&#39;ve just littered your architecture with termites eager =\r\nto decay every arch.\n\nA state machine without guards is effectively a decla=\r\nrative solution, by the way.  Provided, of course, that the state machines =\r\nit cooperates with are designed the same way.  Pat Helland actually has a C=\r\nIDR paper that sort of addresses such a theme: Can we really continue build=\r\ning reliable components out of unreliable ones?  He uses a quick sand metap=\r\nhor, and doesn&#39;t deal directly with object state machines, but the lesson a=\r\npplies regardless.\n\n\n"}}
