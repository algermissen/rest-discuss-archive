Mike Dierken; Bruce.Durling@...;\nrest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Is REST CRUD?\n\n\nBTW, I&#39;ve been thinking more about this, and there definitely some\nsimilarities between REST&#39;s generic interface and the generic interface\nof other systems, but there are some important differences too,\nespecially with SQL/CRUD and other data manipulation languages.  The\nmost important one, IMO is about &quot;POST&quot;, and that while it can be used\nfor insertion/creation, it&#39;s really a very generic method for &quot;accept\nthis data&quot;, which can be used to implement everything (except GET - PUT\nand DELETE can be negotiated).\n\nThis is pretty different than SQL INSERT or CRUD &quot;CREATE&quot;, since both\nare explicit operations where the invoker has explicit a priori\nknowledge of the state of the resource after a successful invocation.\nWith POST, that knowledge has to be negotiated.\n\nJust something to keep in mind.\n\nMB\n\n\n"}}
