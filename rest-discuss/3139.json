But I think that a significant number think -\n&gt; and more importantly, have written software that assumes - that &quot;store&quot;\n&gt; means, well, &quot;store&quot;. 8-)\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how much software out there makes this assumption, but\n&gt; I&#39;d be willing to bet money that anybody developing software that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make this assumption, will eventually have problems when it\n&gt; discovers the other software.\n&gt;\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t WebDAV + supporting specs assume that PUT = store?  Julian?\n\nRFC2518 is very silent about PUT - it completely relies on the HTTP\ndefinition.\n\nAlmost all real-world WebDAV implementations although use WebDAV as some\nsort of filesystem replacement. So they assume that the entity sent with PUT\nindeed is stored octet-per-octet, and that you can retrieve it exactly as\nwritten with GET.\n\nWhich doesn&#39;t mean that I can think that you can or should rely on it. One\nserver (I think either Slide/Tamino or Oracle) allows WebDAV access to an\nunderlying XML store, and at least for XML-wellformed entities it is *not*\ngoing to store the XML serialization, but the XML infoset in some internal\nformat. This means, that you aren&#39;t going to round-trip things like\nattribute quoting (quote vs apostrophe and so on...).\n\nAnother use case would be a server that filters content that is PUT to\nextract metadata (for storage as WebDAV properties). For instance, servers\nmay extract author information from Word or HTML files. So the submitted\nentity is indeed stored (as octet stream), but the server automatically adds\nmetadata that wasn&#39;t explicit in the request.\n\nWebDAV&#39;s interaction with conneg/variant handling currently is completely\nunderspecified. Indeed I just tried Apache 2.0.43 with moddav enabled on the\nroot and got very strange results when trying to create a new resource named\n&quot;index.html&quot; (Apache crashing when using index.html as Destination for a\nMOVE command). :-)  So obviously this needs work.\n\nJulian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n"}}
