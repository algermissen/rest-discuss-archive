Languages are us=\r\nually defined as a syntax with a  \nsemantics. What is needed is to disassoc=\r\niate the\nsyntax from the semantics. If we keep the semantics stable, as we =\r\ndo  \nby choosing to work with URIs (which are universal names -  names  \nna=\r\nme things), we can change the syntax and allow a natural selection  \nof syn=\r\ntaxes. JSON with a good mapping could be an interesting syntax.  \nBut in fa=\r\nct JSON is only half way there. Let us look at an example  \nfrom the JSON w=\r\nikipedia page:\n\n{\n     &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;,\n     &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Smith&quot;,\n     =\r\n&quot;address&quot;: {\n         &quot;streetAddress&quot;: &quot;21 2nd Street&quot;,\n         &quot;city&quot;: &quot;N=\r\new York&quot;,\n         &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NY&quot;,\n         &quot;postalCode&quot;: 10021\n     },\n    =\r\n &quot;phoneNumbers&quot;: [\n         &quot;212 732-1234&quot;,\n         &quot;646 123-4567&quot;\n     ]\n=\r\n}\n\n(Now reading the spec, it says that an &quot;object is an unordered set of  \n=\r\nname-value pairs&quot;. That means it cannot be a hash map since a hash  \nmap fo=\r\nrces only single keys, and there is no restriction there on  \nsingle keys. =\r\nSeems to me that if you map that into an object in a  \nsimplistic way, you =\r\nare going to loose data.)\n\nNow the problem it seems to me with JSON is that=\r\n it both has a  \nbeginning of a semantics, it has types for true, false, an=\r\nd numbers,  \nand at the same time it does not have enough. The spec is comp=\r\nletely  \nat the syntactic level.  The semantics it has come from  it being =\r\nso  \nclosely tied to JavaScript, which has a procedural semantics. Number  =\r\n\nrefer to numbers because that&#39;s the way JavaScript will interpret them.\n\nA=\r\ns I mention elsewhere, the other problem is the lack of identity of  \nthing=\r\ns. &quot;firstName&quot; is a relation relating to what we can clearly see  \nto be a =\r\nPerson object to the string &quot;John&quot;. What if somewhere else I  \nfind a frenc=\r\nh site that has &quot;prenom&quot; and &quot;nom&quot; instead. How can I say  \nthat these two =\r\nwords refer to the same relation? I can&#39;t really  \nbecause there is so much=\r\n that is underspecified.\n\nIn fact the more I look at the example the more I=\r\n notice the same  \nprovincialism that lead to all the problems with xmlrpc =\r\n[1] such as  \nthat XML-RPC not defining a time zone for dates. When working=\r\n on the  \ninternet you have to think globally, or else you are still stuck =\r\nin  \nclient-server mode of thinking. Just as the xmlrpc folk never seemed  =\r\n\nto have realized that the world may have more than one time zone, so  \nit =\r\nis clear that JSON was not designed with the thought that data  \nwould be t=\r\nraveling in a global space with no context (you know on the  \nweb you can l=\r\nink any two resources together, so you don&#39;t know ahead  \nof time where peo=\r\nple are going to come from, and how they are going  \nto mesh up the data). =\r\nThis should not be surprising because  \njavascript is a scripting language =\r\nthat is meant to only work within  \na page. Other provincialisms of the exa=\r\nmple above is to assume that a  \npost code is a number. Clearly they have n=\r\never lived in the UK! Or to  \ngive phone numbers out without a country pref=\r\nix! Oh my god! people on  \nthe internet may find this information from anot=\r\nher country? Well  \nshould they not know that the US prefix is +1? Yeah! I =\r\nwas in Prague  \nrecently and the people there assumed everywhere that you k=\r\nnew not  \njust the country prefix, but what the local Prague prefix was mea=\r\nn to  \nbe. You want to book a hotel in Prague from another country? You mus=\r\nt  \nbe crazy.\n\nLet me rewrite the above example in the Turtle subset of N3,=\r\n and also  \ngive the person a name:\n\n@prefix : &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;=\r\n .\n@prefix contact: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#&gt; .\n\n&lt;http:=\r\n//eg.com/joe#p&gt;\n    a :Person;\n    :firstName &quot;John&quot;;\n    :family_name &quot;Smi=\r\nth&quot;;\n    contact:home [\n          contact:address [\n               contact:=\r\ncity &quot;New York&quot;;\n               contact:country &quot;New York&quot;;\n               =\r\ncontact:postalCode &quot;10021&quot;;\n               contact:street &quot;21 2nd Street&quot;;\n=\r\n          ]\n    ];\n    foaf:phone &lt;tel:+1-212-732-1234&gt;, &lt;tel:+1-646-123-45=\r\n67&gt;;\n.\n\nNow this may require a little learning curve - but frankly not that=\r\n  \nmuch - to understand. But it has the following advantages:\n\n1. you can k=\r\nnow what any of the terms mean by clicking on them  \n(append the prefix to =\r\nthe name) and do a GET\n2. you can make statements of equality between relat=\r\nions and things,  \nsuch as\n    :firstname =3D frenchfoaf:prenom .\n3. you ca=\r\nn infer things from the above, such as that\n    &lt;http://eg.com/joe#p&gt; a :Ag=\r\nent .\n4. you can mix vocabularies from different namespaces as above, just =\r\n \nas in Java you can mix classes developed by\ndifferent organisations.  The=\r\nre does not even seem to be the notion  \nof a namespace in JSON, so how wou=\r\nld you reuse the work of others?\n5. you can split the data about something =\r\nin pieces. So you can put  \nyour information about &lt;http://eg.com/joe#p&gt; at=\r\n the &quot;http://eg.com/ \njoe&quot; URL, in a restful way, and other people can talk=\r\n about him at  \ntheir URL.  I could for example add the following to my foa=\r\nf file:\n  &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt; :knows &lt;http://eg.com/ =\r\n\njoe#p&gt; .\n  You can&#39;t do that in a standard way in JSON because it does not=\r\n  \nhave a URI as a base type (weird for a language that wants to be a  \nweb=\r\n language, to miss the core element of the web! yet it has true,  \nfalse an=\r\nd numbers!)\n\nNow that does not mean JSON can&#39;t be made to work right, as th=\r\ne  \nSPARQL JSON result set serialisation does [2]. But it does not do the  =\r\n\nright thing by default. A bit like languages before Java that did not  \nha=\r\nve unicode support by default. You could do the right thing if you  \nknew a=\r\n lot. But most people just got into bad habits instead.\n\nHenry\n\n[1] &quot;Some o=\r\nf the many limitations of the MetaWeblog API&quot;:\n      http://bblfish.net/blo=\r\ng/page7.html#2005/06/20/22-28-18-208\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-js=\r\non-res/\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If hash maps in my language can only\n&gt; &gt; have unique keys,=\r\n I want a format that enforces this constraint\n&gt; &gt; at the parser level, so =\r\nthat ill-formed messages are defined out\n&gt; &gt; of existence, freeing me from =\r\never having to deal with them at a\n&gt; &gt; higher level in the application.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Serialized formats that restrict what you can say are a liability.\n&gt;\n&gt; XML=\r\n usually lets you express what the data actually is, without too  \n&gt; many\n&gt;=\r\n contortions (at least until overlap rears its head).
