And I&#39;d\nuse the resource created from the first page to update using\nsubsequent pages.\n\nDoes that make sense?  On the backend, I assume I&#39;d insert the data\nfrom the first page into the database and update the records using\nsubsequent pages.\n\nAm I close?  Does anyone have any pointers?\n\n-- \nGreg Akins\n\nhttp://www.pghcodingdojo.org\nhttp://pittjug.dev.java.net\n\n"}}
