I\n&gt; &gt; mean seriously, what is there to get? How can an *entire  \n&gt; industry* not\n&gt; &gt; get REST until Q406 or thereabouts? I don&#39;t buy it. I think the  \n&gt; wheels\n&gt; &gt; are falling off the WS industry wagon, and SOA will be next. We&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; witnessing one of those once a decade industry re-alignments.\n&gt;\n&gt; I often think that REST can be difficult for people to understand\n&gt; because it&#39;s so simple.\n&gt; ... we need something with an actual name\n&gt; before they can even dare to belief in it. Similarly, in other aspects\n&gt; of the web we have &quot;Web2.0&quot; which, as far as I can see, is the radical\n&gt; notion that the technology we&#39;ve all been using for over 15 years  \n&gt; might\n&gt; actually work and maybe we should just use it rather than trying to  \n&gt; win\n&gt; the glory of being the person who fixes it.\n\nAh very well put sir.\n\n--Toby\n\n\n"}}
