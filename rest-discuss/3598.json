Fielding&quot; \n&lt;fielding@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We could attempt to model REST\n&gt; as a shared-memory-by-message-passing system, but don&#39;t because that\n&gt; model tries to maintain distributed consistency.  REST just says \nthat\n&gt; there is no consistency -- only representations that indicate state\n&gt; at some point in the past and an implicit grant of use for some time\n&gt; into the future.\n\nWhat do you think of the attempts of Paul Prescod and others to cast \nstate-transition models into RESTful hyperlinked resources?\n\nFor example,\nhttp://www.prescod.net/rest/state_transition.html \n\nFor another example, many if not most business dealings require \nexplioit agreements between trading partners, which is a form of \nconsistency.  \n\nA common business protocol for contracts (of which orders are a \nsubtype) is Offer-Acceptance, which we have tried to RESTify several \ntimes on this list.\n\nOne way to do it, I think following Paul&#39;s proposals, would be to \ncreate separate hyperlinked resources for Offer, Response (Acceptance \nor Rejection) and Order.\n\nIf the Offer resource exists, and is not already hyperlinked to a \nResponse, then the counter-party can post an Acceptance to the Offer \nresource.\n\nIf an Acceptance is posted, then an Order resource will be created, \nhyperlinked to the Offer and Acceptance.\n\nDoes this kind of interaction seem acceptably RESTful to you?  The \ninterpretation of a message is dependent on the state of the resource \nto which it is posted, and to which it refers, in addition to the \ncontents of the message itself.  (But nothing else.)\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
