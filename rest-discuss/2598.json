The &#39;filter to certain dates&#39; is an operation\n&gt; &gt; upon that local data - and that filter would need the same input data as\na\n&gt; &gt; client-composed URI (namely &#39;asof&#39; and the date\n&gt; &gt; syntax/value-space/meaning/whatever).\n&gt;\n&gt; But\n&gt;\n&gt;   a) the filter allows subtyping and remapping so that can be extended\n&gt; in a purely declarative way to handle sites that rename their &quot;asof&quot; to\n&gt; &quot;asofdate&quot;. If those sites publish the renaming as RDF, I won&#39;t have to\n&gt; touch my client application to have it work with this new data\n&gt; representation.\nIf the filtering algorithm has access to subtyping and remapping, then a\ndeclarative format for creating the URI with query parameters can also have\naccess to the same sort of functionality. The site publishes the renaming\nand the client doesn&#39;t have to be adjusted.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;   b) the filter knows the complete scope of the information available to\n&gt; it. That&#39;s &quot;extra information&quot; that you don&#39;t get when all you can do is\n&gt; guess and query.\nIf the data set is reasonably large, it will probably be chunked & so it\ndoesn&#39;t know the complete scope of information. That scope is implied and\nnot explicit. Unless the representation of that resource says &#39;this is a\nportion of available information and there are more bits here and here&#39;.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; The same re-application probably would not work with composed URIs out\nof\n&gt; &gt; the box. But if you&#39;ve got content-manipulation approaches (arch forms,\nname\n&gt; &gt; mapping, etc.) executed on the client, then I supposed that same slot\ncould\n&gt; &gt; be filled with mappings of the declarative rules for generating URIs\nalso.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe. Nevertheless, if the resource you provide are enumerable then a\n&gt; legitimate question for a client application to ask is &quot;how do I\n&gt; enumerate them.&quot; You can&#39;t predict whether this will be important to\n&gt; some client or not. So I advise that if the resources are enumerable and\n&gt; if you have the development where-with-all, you should expose an\n&gt; interface that allows enumeration perhaps alongside one that allows\n&gt; queries as an optimization.\nNow we&#39;re talking... I&#39;m all for discovery via enumeration, but I want to\nexplore what reasonable approaches are when enumeration is not practical.\n\n\n"}}
