The portion of websites which compress HTML, JS and\nCSS documents is sufficiently large that this technology is supported\nin most browsers (more than other HTTP clients) and most webservers.\nOf course, handling HTTP compression requires by-the-book Content\nNegotiation, to such an extent that intermediaries can store compressed\nHTTP responses, yet also unzip them on-the-fly to serve clients that\ndon&#39;t support gzip -- without having to store two versions or pass the\nrequest on to an origin server.\n\nSo it&#39;s always a bit shocking to read a browser developer claim that\nconneg just doesn&#39;t get used much, when it&#39;s actually widely and\nsuccessfully deployed to great effect.  Even if most webmasters whose\nsites employ compression, have absolutely no clue about it.  Without\nbeing able to send compressed text files to clients effectively,\nwouldn&#39;t the Web require at least 50% more bandwidth than it does now?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
