Specifically, I&#39;=\r\nm working in a standards body (the ZigBee Alliance) that has classically us=\r\ned a binary protocol that does not really adhere to any true architectural =\r\ndesign (IMHO).  I&#39;ve been engaged in work that started in ZigBee and has no=\r\nw moved to IEEE (2030.5) that (attempts to) rigidly stick to a RESTful HTTP=\r\n design.  One request that has come up is to port toggle switch capability =\r\nto this standard.  Home automation manufacturers have actually implemented =\r\ntoggle switches this way in the past (see http://zigbee.org/Products/ByStan=\r\ndard/ZigBeeHomeAutomation.aspx).\n&gt; \n&gt; So, in short, I myself am not manufac=\r\nturing a specific toggle switch, but rather have been working in a standard=\r\ns body where others have requested the inclusion of toggle switch functiona=\r\nlity.  We also have some use cases for a simple button press, which I see a=\r\ns a similar problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Robby\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Nick Gall nick.gall@g=\r\nmail.com&lt;mailto:nick.gall@...&gt; [rest-discuss]&quot; &lt;rest-discuss-noreply@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss-noreply@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: N=\r\nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&lt;mailto:nick.gall@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wednesda=\r\ny, July 9, 2014 at 11:14 AM\n&gt; Cc: Rest List &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;m=\r\nailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful =\r\nToggle\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Robby, I&#39;d like to know more about the real world need fo=\r\nr such an API. Sure, mechanical light switches DID work this way, but do ho=\r\nme automation systems really offer a &quot;toggle&quot;? I&#39;m trying to imagine why I =\r\nwould ever want to simply change the state of the lighting in my room, with=\r\nout caring if the result was lights on or lights off. I can&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; So are =\r\nyou programming a home automation system? If so, do you really need toggle,=\r\n given my observation above?\n&gt; \n&gt; Or is this just a hypothetical question a=\r\nbout the generic behavior of toggle and how it maps to REST? If so, then it=\r\n kind of feels like the perennial, &quot;Can REST do THIS?&quot; questions that skept=\r\nics of REST would lob from time to time in the good old REST v WS-STAR WARS=\r\n days. It kind of reminds me of the old chestnut, &quot;How can I do two-phase c=\r\nommit in REST?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Or is your need for toggle behavior truly needed in so=\r\nme other actual domain? If so, could you please tell us a bit more about th=\r\ne domain and it&#39;s REAL need for toggle behavior. With such context in mind,=\r\n we can perhaps help you better map it into a RESTful API.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt; \n&gt; Nick Gall\n&gt; Phone: +1.781.325.8370\n&gt; Other Contact Info: htt=\r\np://bit.ly/nickgall\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Jul 8, 2014 at 5:28 PM, &#39;Simpson, Robby=\r\n (GE Energy Management)&#39; robby.simpson@...&lt;mailto:robby.simpson@...&gt; =\r\n[rest-discuss] &lt;rest-discuss-noreply@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss-no=\r\nreply@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been scratching my head o=\r\nver this one for a while and am hoping I can\n&gt; get some help.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Imagi=\r\nne a light switch with one simple resource: /state , where state can\n&gt; be &quot;=\r\nOn&quot; or &quot;Off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One can PUT to /state , changing /state to either &quot;On=\r\n&quot; or &quot;Off.&quot;\n&gt; Similarly, a GET to /state will tell you if the light is curr=\r\nently &quot;On&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Where I&#39;m struggling is with a safe &quot;Toggle&quot;=\r\n mechanism.  That is, if\n&gt; /state is &quot;On&quot;, change it to &quot;Off&quot; and vice vers=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that one solution would be to simply perform a GET =\r\non /state\n&gt; and then PUT the opposite.  However, I am concerned with both t=\r\nhe overhead\n&gt; and latency this entails as well as the potential for a race =\r\ncondition\n&gt; (what if /state changes between the GET and the PUT?).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAny solution I&#39;ve looked at thus far seems to violate RESTful principles,\n&gt;=\r\n particularly regarding idempotency.  In short, can one safely toggle?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Robby\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Posted by: &quot;Simpson, Robby (GE Energy Management)&quot; &lt;=\r\nrobby.simpson@...&lt;mailto:robby.simpson@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo Grou=\r\nps Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
