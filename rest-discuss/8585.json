Granted, it&#39;s\nhard to program without such understanding, but there&#39;s really nothing about\nthe PUT status=on that a-priori conveys that the operation will be async.\nIn RPC systems there are patterns of async. behavior that are present in the\ninterface that are tip offs to the underlying nature of the command.  \n\nAs Steve hinted at, turning something like a light &quot;on&quot; is typically a\nsynchronous notion.  So setting a device to &quot;on&quot; might be construed the same\nway without having something in the initial contract to indicate that.\n\nI&#39;m having some trouble coming up with words that in the REST style, convey\na-priori asynchronous behavior.\n\n\n"}}
