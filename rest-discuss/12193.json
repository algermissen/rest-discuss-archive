I hope that this email\n&gt; will answer that quest=\r\nion.  I also hope that this will either prove or\n&gt; disprove that I understa=\r\nnd what Roy Fielding said in the last email to this\n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you =\r\ncan create a system that can follow *arbitrary *XML or HTML links.\n&gt; Howeve=\r\nr, REST APIs are being used to build other systems.  Those system\n&gt; require=\r\n *specific functionality* from the API at *specific *points in the\n&gt; intera=\r\nction (a.k.a.the client workspace).  I haven&#39;t seen a working &quot;REST\n&gt; API&quot; =\r\nthat provides a method to derive ALL of the URLs for that timely\n&gt; specific=\r\n functionality based on a single entry point.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to give an exa=\r\nmple of this with a non-existant, theoretical REST\n&gt; API from a company cal=\r\nled Metflix (not to be confused with any other APIs,\n&gt; for legal reasons).\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (Bear with me here, it&#39;s going to take some time to get to the punch l=\r\nine.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Metflix is a website that has all movies that relate to the Mets=\r\n football\n&gt; franchise (which of course does not exist, and has no relation =\r\nto any\n&gt; company what-so-ever).  You can:\n&gt; \n&gt;    - login (metflix.com/logi=\r\nn),\n&gt;    - manage your Queue of Mets movies (/myqueue, as a starting point =\r\nplus\n&gt;    management functionality),\n&gt;    - view a list of the latest movie=\r\ns (/movies/),\n&gt;    - view information about a Mets movie (/movies/{id}),\n&gt; =\r\n   - search for Mets movies (/search?term=3D{searchTerm}).\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course t=\r\nhere are plenty of other whiz-bang features, but we can limit our\n&gt; discuss=\r\nion to those :).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Metflix website got so successful, that it create=\r\nd a RESTful API so that\n&gt; other applications can be built around its servic=\r\nes.  The URLS of the\n&gt; service just happen to have the same URLs as the sit=\r\ne, but are prefixed by\n&gt; &#39;/api&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to build a fancy Flash UI clie=\r\nnt for that service, that basically\n&gt; exposes the same services, but just l=\r\nooks much nicer (Note: their affiliate\n&gt; program is fantastic... I&#39;ll make =\r\na ton of money that way).\n&gt; \n&gt; My Flash app requires the user to login, the=\r\nn he or she can manage the\n&gt; queue, search for Mets movies, and consequentl=\r\ny view details about movies\n&gt; from either the queue or the search results.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; My fancy Flash client will POST to &#39;metflix.com/api/login&#39;, and get a =\r\n200\n&gt; status code and an auth token.  Then it will show your queue, (which =\r\nas you\n&gt; remember, is found at &#39;/api/myqueue&#39; and of course the auth token =\r\nhas to be\n&gt; used here) in one panel, which has links to the individual movi=\r\nes in the\n&gt; queue, and another panel will show you latest movies (which as =\r\nyou remember\n&gt; is found at &#39;/api/movies&#39;) which also has links to movies.  =\r\nThere&#39;s also a\n&gt; search box that performs a GET to (&#39;/search?term=3D&#39; + sea=\r\nrchbox.text).\n&gt; \n&gt; (I almost got to the punchline... wait for it)\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nprocess of linking to invidual movies from the queue, the movie list and\n&gt; =\r\nsearch results is RESTful.  You GET a list of movies (name + link) back, an=\r\nd\n&gt; can click on those links to &quot;transition state&quot; to view the movie detail=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that for the sake of my specific requirements, I har=\r\ndcoded\n&gt; the URLs for the queue, the current movie list and the search box.=\r\n  I didn&#39;t\n&gt; &quot;discover&quot; those URLs based on the result of my login request =\r\n(which happens\n&gt; to be my bookmark and entry point to the system).  Notice =\r\nthat I also\n&gt; hard-coded the query parameter that needs to be used for my s=\r\nearch term.\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on my (clearly limited) understanding of REST, all o=\r\nf that hardcoding\n&gt; of URLs in my Flash UI, which is a client of the Metfli=\r\nx.com, is a violation\n&gt; of the HATEOAS/hyptertext constraint.  Based on my =\r\n(personal, limited)\n&gt; observation, there are no RESTful APIs that implement=\r\n the hypertext\n&gt; constraint any better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if I did get back URLs, m=\r\ny Flash would still need to find the *current\n&gt; value *of *a specific URL *=\r\nfor a specific task (like the URL for the &#39;list\n&gt; of current movies&#39;, the U=\r\nRL for the &#39;movies in my queue&#39; and the URL and the\n&gt; name of the query par=\r\nam of the search form).  The Metflix API needs to\n&gt; somehow provide my clie=\r\nnt with a set of URLs that I need for my next\n&gt; potential logical tasks (my=\r\n &quot;workspace,&quot; if I understandy Roy Fielding\n&gt; correctly).  It also needs to=\r\n assign a means of of identifying how those\n&gt; URLs map to a specific functi=\r\nonality that&#39;s different from the URLs\n&gt; themselves.  For example It&#39;s not =\r\nproper to expect the client to know what\n&gt; &#39;/api/movies&#39; is.  The server ne=\r\neds to provide another piece of\n&gt; well-understood information from which my=\r\n Flash UI can *interpret *that the\n&gt; meaning of the &#39;/api/movies&#39; link is &#39;=\r\nthe current list of movies.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Websites, unlike REST APIs, do have a cle=\r\nver method of link\n&gt; identification... It&#39;s the natural language found betw=\r\neen and around the &#39;&lt;a\n&gt; href=3D&quot;..&quot;&gt;&#39; and the &#39;&lt;/a&gt;&#39; tags.  There&#39;s an &quot;in=\r\nterpretation engine&quot; that\n&gt; can understand that natural language, and disco=\r\nver the features of the\n&gt; pages, with the help of a User Agent (such as a w=\r\neb browser).  (BTW, the\n&gt; more I think about it, the more I apprciate th th=\r\nought put into HTML and the\n&gt; rest of the REST ecosystem).\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a =\r\nclever universal method for identifying ALL appropriate links in\n&gt; a client=\r\n of a REST API such that you can start with a given URL/bookmark\n&gt; (like lo=\r\ngin), and not have to hardcode any &quot;workspace&quot; URLs other than the\n&gt; first?=\r\n  Is this identification process to complex without a human to\n&gt; interpret =\r\nthe meaning of the links?\n&gt; \n&gt; Take a look at Craig McLanahan&#39;s first messa=\r\nge in this thread... IMHO, it\n&gt; has some important clues to these answers :=\r\n)\n&gt; *\n&gt; Darrel*, does that answer the question satisfactorally?\n&gt; \n&gt; *Roy*,=\r\n if you&#39;re reading this, did I get it right this time?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Solomon Duskis=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nAre you expecting that a client should &quot;guess&quot; the next state transitio=\r\nn out of the blue?  I&#39;m not sure this is possible.  Some knowledge has to b=\r\ne provided (I think) out of band that explains &quot;relationships&quot; in some way =\r\nsuch that a client can be programmed to traverse the state transitions.  Th=\r\ne key (in my opinion) is that the out of band information are not URIs but =\r\nrather &quot;identifiers&quot; for relationships e.g. Atom uses &quot;rel&quot; to indicate rel=\r\nationships and basically monikers like &quot;self&quot; have meaning within the proto=\r\ncol.\n\nEb\n\n\n"}}
