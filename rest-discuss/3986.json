IMHO,\nabstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\nare\nsubject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\nwords:\nsubject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\npart\nof the architecture itself).\n\nCan anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\ninclude\nc) ?\n\nThe second question I have is related to the question what the\nsemantics of a resource are.  Roy&#39;s dissertation says:\n\n&quot;REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the\n semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather\n than the value corresponding to those semantics at the\n time the reference is created.&quot;\n\nTo me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the\nsemantics of resources.  What is the precise meaning of &#39;author&#39; here?\nAuthor of a &#39;document&#39; that uses a particular URI or the author that\nsomhow &#39;brings into being&#39; a particular resource?\n\nThanks,\n\nJan\n\n[1]\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                &lt;algermissen@...&gt;\nConsultant & Programmer\n\nhttp://www.topicmapping.com\nhttp://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
