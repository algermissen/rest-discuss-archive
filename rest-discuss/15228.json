I hat=\r\ne the whole monopoly more\nthan most people and that&#39;s why I&#39;m publishing ev=\r\nerything on my blog\nfirst. Since this problem won&#39;t be going away any time =\r\nsoon -- maybe\nwe can just ignore it and work with what we have? Excellent b=\r\nlog posts\nare being published, there are several people active on the Web t=\r\nhat\nare currently working at universities and do have access to that\nmateri=\r\nal, the WWW conference proceedings are available for free\nonline, and so on=\r\n.\n\nSo, just collecting and organizing available material/references in\nsome=\r\n way is something you think would be useful to you and others? I\ndefinitely=\r\n think that it&#39;s valuable, both on it&#39;s own and as a first\nstep towards som=\r\nething more. It could also be something that wouldn&#39;t\nrequire as much an ef=\r\nfort as organizing the terminology, coming up\nwith models and other stuff I=\r\n mentioned, so more people would\npotentially chip in and not loose half of =\r\nthe next year over it.\n\nLastly, I think that a lot depends on coordination =\r\nof activities -- no\ncoordination/planning =3D nothing happens. This is the =\r\nhardest part and\nwhere I see the least people volunteering. What do you thi=\r\nnk?\n\nIvan\n\nOn Tue, Apr 13, 2010 at 02:38, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; First, thanks to you, Ivan, for writing that blog post and for you=\r\nr\n&gt; work to chronicle REST activities on the Web. I think you make several\n=\r\n&gt; very good points. It&#39;s true that, after ten years, there is still not\n&gt; m=\r\nuch accessible material on this very important architectural style.\n&gt;\n&gt; One=\r\n of the problems I see is that some very good scholarship on\n&gt; architectura=\r\nl styles is bottled up behind IEEE and ACM pay walls. This\n&gt; makes it more =\r\ndifficult to build a large collection of information\n&gt; from which others ca=\r\nn easily draw.\n&gt;\n&gt; My own feeling is that, at this point in time, collectin=\r\ng as many of\n&gt; the varied and disparate links, references, and examples as =\r\npossible\n&gt; and offering them in a targeted search would go a long way to ex=\r\nposing\n&gt; a general theme and common ground that has developed around Roy&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; initial work over the years. =C2=A0That includes making rest-discuss and\n=\r\n&gt; other email archives (HTTP, etc.) searchable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think that many =\r\npeople active on this list are type to keep\n&gt; themselves quite busy. I see =\r\nvery few folks here volunteering to take\n&gt; up new tasks. That&#39;s a bummer si=\r\nnce so many on this list have been\n&gt; here quite a while and have so much to=\r\n offer the general community and\n&gt; probably would offer their time if we co=\r\nuld come up with ways to make\n&gt; it easy to contribute regularly.\n&gt;\n&gt; I, too=\r\n, admit I&#39;m pretty tied up. But I&#39;m ready to offer assistance\n&gt; where possi=\r\nble.\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Apr 10, 2010 at =\r\n08:59, Ivan =C5=BDu=C5=BEak &lt;izuzak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hey all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A f=\r\new days ago I wrote a blog post on why I think understanding REST\n&gt;&gt; is har=\r\nd and what we can and *should* do about it -\n&gt;&gt; http://wp.me/poYaf-34. Sinc=\r\ne a lot of what I wrote was inspired by\n&gt;&gt; following this group and since t=\r\nhis group is the most relevant (only?)\n&gt;&gt; place for discussing REST - I&#39;d l=\r\nike to know what you think. Short\n&gt;&gt; version (since the post is really long=\r\n):\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Although there&#39;s a lot of great blog posts, papers and mailing lis=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; discussions, the current material on REST is a mess which makes REST\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; hard to understand and confusing to discuss:\n&gt;&gt; * there is no agreed upon=\r\n and widely used terminology, but a lot of\n&gt;&gt; unexplained and overlapping t=\r\nerms,\n&gt;&gt; * discussions are fragmented all over the web and often unnecessar=\r\nily\n&gt;&gt; repeat previous discussions,\n&gt;&gt; * there are no (formal or semi-forma=\r\nl) models of (important) concepts.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Therefore, I think people involved=\r\n in and enthusiastic about REST\n&gt;&gt; (mostly people on this group) should:\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n 1. Agree that there is a problem worth fixing =E2=80=93 do we think that w=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; can create a better, clearer and more systematized way of\n&gt;&gt; understan=\r\nding and discussing about REST?\n&gt;&gt; 2. Express interest in fixing it =E2=80=\r\n=93 is this something people want to\n&gt;&gt; contribute their time to?\n&gt;&gt; 3. Agr=\r\nee on how to fix it =E2=80=93 what should be our output (a RESTopedia, a\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n document, video tutorials) and how would we all contribute to and\n&gt;&gt; moder=\r\nate the process?\n&gt;&gt; 4. Do it =E2=80=93 spend time discussing and developing=\r\n the output.\n&gt;&gt; 5. Eat our dogfood =E2=80=93 use whatever we produce. If we=\r\n don=E2=80=99t use the\n&gt;&gt; terminology and models we agree upon, the the mes=\r\ns has only gotten\n&gt;&gt; bigger.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Ivan (hoping that all of this=\r\n doesn&#39;t sound as babbling of an\n&gt;&gt; overeagerly naive megalomaniac)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
