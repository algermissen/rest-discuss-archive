If the system breaks, it won&#39;t\nfunction properly until it isn&#39;t broken anymore.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The client cannot make that need visible the server, or to\n&gt; intermediates.\n&gt;\n\nWhy would it need to?  Application-specific media types are not part of\nthe REST style, and for good reason.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It has to ask for `text/html` and hope that the server\n&gt; always sends goodrelations meta-data and that no intermediates strip\n&gt; what might seem to be superfluous bloat from the returned\n&gt; representation.  (The html spec does not require that goodrelations\n&gt; meta-data be included so stripping the meta-data is, strictly\n&gt; speaking, not wrong.)\n&gt; \n\nOr application/xhtml+xml, or application/atom+xml, or whatever other\nmedia type happens to be hosting the domain-specific vocabulary.  The\nhost media type is what&#39;s negotiated, not the domain-specific\nvocabulary contained within.\n\nDo you have any real-world examples to point to, of this actually\nhappening in practice?  If metadata were stripped by intermediaries\nthat didn&#39;t understand it, nobody&#39;s CSS would work, because all the\nsuperfluous &lt;span&gt; and @class bloat would be removed.  This argument\nsounds like FUD to me.\n\nGR isn&#39;t part of HTML, but the attributes it relies on, are.  I&#39;ve\nnever heard of such stripping.  Comments, yes, once upon a time, but\nthat stopped because so many web sites rely on comments to work\nproperly, like &lt;!-- main content --&gt; &lt;!-- /main content --&gt;.  HTML says\nunknown elements and attributes may be _ignored_.  It does not say that\nthey may be _removed_.  If there&#39;s some edge case where this happens,\nI&#39;m simply not going to concern myself with it.\n\nOnce again, I&#39;m befuddled at the pushback here.  Why is it that Roy\ngets no pushback when he says this, yet if I repeat it, it&#39;s subject to\ndebate as if it&#39;s something I just came up with, all by myself?  I&#39;ll\nlet you folks convince Roy, then I&#39;ll let Roy convince me.  Until then,\nyour argument lies with Roy, not me.\n\nI&#39;m simply basing my answers on the established facts of REST, not\nphilosophizing about how it might be better if we ignore the\nrequirement for standardized media types and embedded domain-specific\nvocabularies in favor of application-specific media types.  Such an\narchitecture wouldn&#39;t be REST and would have no working model to point\nto as proof of the style, as REST has with the Web.\n\nSo I&#39;ll be sticking with REST and the Web as they exist today, and\nembedding my domain-specific metadata within ubiquitous media types,\nbecause I know this is what works, and I know for a fact that to do so\nis to follow the REST style.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In practice, i know that rdfa works almost all the time.  But it does\n&gt; have some weaknesses.  For example, if some other ontology comes along\n&gt; to replace/compete with goodrelations, the server has to serve\n&gt; annotation for both of those ontologies all the time.  Or choose to\n&gt; break a subset of the clients it might otherwise support.  It cannot\n&gt; return one or the other depending on the need of the client.  Hiding\n&gt; this dependency also makes implementing intermediates that can convert\n&gt; between these two ontologies far more difficult.\n&gt; \n\nSo you&#39;re saying that if I change my API, then clients coded to a prior\nversion of the API will break?  Agreed.  Where doesn&#39;t that hold true,\nthough, and why should REST be any different?  REST has nothing to do\nwith negotiating between versions of an API.\n\nAs a system developer, I don&#39;t care about the needs of the client.  The\nclient needs to care about how the system is built.  If you want your\nclient to understand my domain-specific vocabulary, then your client\nmust understand my domain-specific vocabulary.  If a client doesn&#39;t,\nthen it can still render the ubiquitous media type based on well-known\nrules.  This is loose coupling.  Relying on clients to have knowledge\nof application-specific media types, or fail, is tight coupling.\n\nWhy would an intermediary need to convert from one domain-specific\nvocabulary to another?  All intermediaries need to know is the media\ntype.  If I want to offer my domain-specific vocabulary in some other\nform, then I provide a GRDDL link to glean it from its existing form.\nIf I see some service on the Web that I want to integrate with my\nsystem, but it uses a different domain-specific vocabulary, then I can\nalways use a SPARQL service to convert it.\n\nThe reason this works, is due to the ubiquity of the host media types.\nNot *despite* the ubiquity of the host media types.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Media types describe the semantics and syntax of representations.  I\n&gt; think that html with embedded goodrelations meta-data has a should\n&gt; constitute a new media type.  It has a similar syntax to html but with\n&gt; different semantics.  Doing so would make the message much more self\n&gt; descriptive.\n&gt; \n\nMedia types describe how to process a payload.  Self-descriptive\nmessaging has nothing to do with understanding payload content.  It\nonly has to do with understanding the nature of the messaging.  At the\nprotocol level, there is no need to expose that RDFa or GR is being\nused.  The only need is to inform clients that do grok RDFa, that they\nmay scan the payload for RDFa, by informing them that a media type is\nbeing used that supports RDFa, which does not require the string &#39;rdfa&#39;\nto appear in the media type -- it&#39;s a given in HTML media types.\n\nReferring once again to REST:\n\n&quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\nefficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\nrather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n\nYou&#39;re either willing to make this tradeoff in pursuit of REST, or you\naren&#39;t actually following REST.\n\nNon-standardized forms which _are_ specific to an application&#39;s needs\nare a REST violation, and no amount of arguing this point with me, as\nopposed to Roy, will change that fact, because it isn&#39;t about me, and\nthere&#39;s nothing open to alternate interpretation in that thesis quote.\n\nREST is not about assigning media types to every possible application-\nspecific need.  I don&#39;t know how much more clear Roy&#39;s thesis could\nhave been, that this is not the REST style.\n\nTake a look at the direction the Web is evolving.  Do we see any\nproliferation of application-specific media types?  No, the big sites\nare moving towards embedding domain-specific vocabulary inside\nubiquitous media types (apparently, whether some folks here like it or\nnot).  There are hundreds of examples besides BestBuy or Amazon or\nO&#39;Reilly.\n\nREST explains exactly why this is the case, and argues specifically\nagainst addressing this problem by defining media types for every\npossible domain-specific vocabulary.  Such a solution is _not_ the REST\nstyle, and I can&#39;t say that emphatically enough, or often enough, or\naccurately-to-the-thesis enough.  This is a case where the evolution of\nthe Web isn&#39;t so much following REST, as predicted by it.\n\nIt&#39;s well worth all the time it takes to understand this.  Suggesting,\nor giving a +1 to a suggestion, that what we really need is application-\nspecific media types, is coming right out and saying that REST is B.S.,\na position I cannot condone, because there&#39;s simply no proof of it.\n\nOnce more:\n\n&quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\nefficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\nrather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n\nEnough said?  This is a fact.  I&#39;m merely the messenger.  Please, don&#39;t\nshoot the messenger.  RDFa + GR is a prime example of exactly the sort\nof thing that has no business being assigned its own media type in a\nREST architecture.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
