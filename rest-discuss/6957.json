I thought\n&gt;I heard that to be RESTful you needed to PUT/POST an entire representation,\n&gt;not just part of it. So using fragments would theoretically not give you the\n&gt;entire resource and thus be non RESTful?\n&gt;\n\nA representation of a fragment of a resource is a resource in its own right.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Also on the web isn&#39;t a fragment just a bookmark (a pointer) as opposed to a\n&gt;portion of a resource where the URI sans fragment points to the entire\n&gt;resource? If so, wouldn&#39;t that make it invalid it use a fragment to get at\n&gt;just a small part of a resource? And don&#39;t clients process fragments as\n&gt;opposed to servers too?\n&gt;\n\nSemantics rears its ugly head again.  A fragment of a resource is just that, \na fragment of a resource.  Don&#39;t confuse that with a *URI fragment*, which is \na client-side implementation and opaque to the server, i.e. not part of the \nHTTP request.  User-agents may render a resource differently based on the \nvalue of the URI fragment, in HTML they are bookmarks but they are used \ndifferently in other media types so you really can&#39;t generalize a URI \nfragment as synonymous with a resource fragment.\n\nIf I implement XPATH on the server to break out a nodeset from a larger \ndocument and assign it an URL as I have described in this example, the \nresulting resource is a fragment of the original resource, this has \nabsolutely nothing to do with any fragment identifiers within the document \nbecause the XPATH I gave in this example was clearly based on &lt;element&gt; names \nnot id=&#39;attributes&#39;, and nothing to do with URI fragments since clearly there \nwere none presented in the examples I gave.\n\nSo yes, you&#39;re right, there is such a thing as URI fragment identifiers and \nthey are indeed client-side.  But we aren&#39;t talking about them at all in \nthis example.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
