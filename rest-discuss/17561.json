Users can only interact \n&gt; &gt; with the API if they’ve got an account. Let’s say authorization happens \n&gt; &gt; overHTTP Basic. Given that, would you use URIs \n&gt; &gt; like /photos and /photos/{id} (as a photo list and photo detail resource, \n&gt; &gt; respectively)? What’s weird about those URIs is that my /photos is a \n&gt; &gt; different list of photos than your /photos — in other words, the resource \n&gt; &gt; represented depends on the information in theAuthorization header. It seems \n&gt; &gt; like URIs \n&gt; &gt; like /people/{my-uid}/photos and /people/{my-uid}/photos/{photo-id} are more \n&gt; &gt; “pure.” But now that’s weird because only one single user ever has access to \n&gt; &gt; a given URI (e.g only user #7 gets to access the entire space \n&gt; &gt; under /people/7). \n\n...this doesn&#39;t have to be true, of course. You could implement access control \nusing ACLs, for instance, and so you would not be restricting access based on \nURLs. \n\nHow you design URIs and how you implement access control are two separate \nconsiderations. Sometimes I find that restricting access based on the URL is \nsuitable, but often I find that&#39;s just too crude, and you have to move to a \ndifferent model of access control, e.g., ACLs.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m sure the folks on this list would say, the structure of the URL is \nirrelevant, it&#39;s the hypermedia (links, forms etc.) that get you there that are \nimportant.\n\nCheers,\n\nAlistair\n\n&gt; &gt; And the information in the URI is redundant with the information in \n&gt; &gt; the Authorization header. I guess the question comes down to \n&gt; &gt; whether HTTP headers “should” be allowed to determine the resource returned. \n&gt; &gt; So which would you use? Why?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say I&#39;d favour using what he calls the &#39;pure&#39; approach, but I&#39;m no\n&gt; expert and wanted to cross check with you folks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sidu.\n&gt; http://c42.in\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
