Sampson&quot; &lt;justin@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Actually not -- 401 is really the unauthenticated response, and\n&gt; 403 is really the unauthorized response. The HTTP spec doesn&#39;t use\n&gt; the terminology correctly. Notice that the header required with\n&gt; the 401 response is WWW-Authenticate and the corresponding request\n&gt; header is Authorization -- the terminology is inconsistent even\n&gt; within one mechanism. So ignore it. :)\n\nThis is a good point and resolves the issue for me (unless someone who\nwas involved in the spec can explain this inconsistency).\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that browsers (at least some) will display the\n&gt; content of a 401 response if there&#39;s no WWW-Authenticate header,\n&gt; so sometimes I do that, though it violates the spec, and it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t support Basic auth, just custom form/cookie auth. That&#39;s\n&gt; all ugly and non-standard but seems to work. Sometimes I do the\n&gt; same thing using 403, though, in contradiction to what I wrote in\n&gt; the first paragraph above.\n\nBut the point of using 401 is that it is discoverable. We all know\nwhat the spec&#39;d behaviour is and can act accordingly.\n\nA command like client, for example, could query my service and supply\na username and password if it gets a 401. But if I send it a 403 the\nclient has to be specifically coded with knowledge of my service.\n\nShame. Still, if the W3C are working on it at least a start has been\nmade.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
