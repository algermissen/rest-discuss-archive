For \n&gt; example, should it only impact resources that are either i) named by the \n&gt; request or ii) returned by the response? Is the key that the *primary* \n&gt; effect must be on the resource named by the POST?\n\nAny side effects are allowable with POST. GET is what shouldn&#39;t have \nside effects, aside from the trivial (e.g. updating a hit counter), Now \nin general side effects are a bad design, irrespective of REST \nprinciples, so try to avoid them where possible.\n\n&gt; Otherwise, how is &quot;side effects with POST&quot; any different than &quot;tunneling \n&gt; RPC through POST&quot;?\n\nThe problem with tunneling RPC through POST is something completely \ndifferent. It gives every service a unique interface and makes proxies \nand firewalls very hard to implement. REST is about many nouns and four \nverbs. RPC is usually about many verbs and just a few nouns (int, \nstring, double, etc.).\n\nThere is one side-effect related problem with POST-tunneling, though \nit&#39;s the reverse. Since RPC solutions use POST for everything, even \nside-effect free, safe operations can&#39;t be cached, bookmarked, repeated, \nand so forth. REST separates safe and idempotent operations from \nnon-safe and non-idempotent ones. RPC doesn&#39;t. :-(\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
