REST defines the response to a request as \na representation of a resource, even if that representation is an error \nmessage, or no conceptual mapping to that resource has been defined.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, that&#39;s Rest, not HTTP. I don&#39;t think it will work well to defend a\n&gt;funny design using HTTP&#39;s 404/410 distinction with definitions from\n&gt;Rest. Unless you can demonstrate the equivalent of 404/410 in Rest, of\n&gt;course.\n&gt;\n\nYou require a 410 response to indicate a permanent condition, but I \nthink that means you&#39;re the one who needs to defend his &quot;funny&quot; position \non that issue, not me.\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;demonstrate the equivalent of 404/410 in REST&quot;?  \nIf I wish to indicate that a resource is unavailable, either permanently \nor temporarily, and my distributed hypermedia application uses HTTP as \nits protocol, then the definitions of the 400, 403, 404 and 410 response \ncodes are used exactly as they are unambiguously described in RFC 2616, \nat my discretion as the application developer provided that such use \ndoesn&#39;t break the Uniform Interface constraint of REST.\n\nIn terms of a generic REST connector, if my protocol were FTP then I \nwould use 4yz as the response to the same request, if that&#39;s what \nyou&#39;re after?  Or 5yz if the request is not to be repeated.  But, \n404 and 410 each map to 4yz &quot;transient negative completion reply&quot; not \n5yz &quot;permanent negative completion reply&quot; in RFC 765.  HTTP&#39;s 400 and \n403 responses map to 5yz &quot;permanent negative completion reply&quot; in FTP.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;re saying &quot;clearly&quot; here, so you can surely quote the spec where it\n&gt;supports that? (I&#39;m not completely opposed to that view, but I sure do\n&gt;not think that RFC2616 is &quot;clear&quot; about that :-).\n&gt;\n\n&quot;It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as \n&#39;gone&#39; or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the \ndiscretion of the server owner.&quot; (RFC 2616, 10.4.11)\n\nMeaning it is up to my discretion to change a 410 response to a 404 \nresponse, or even PUT back what used to be there at some point in the \nfuture and respond 200 OK again.  Clients must not assume that 4yz \nindicates a permanent condition in FTP, or 404 or 410 in HTTP.  The \nonly thing a client should do, if it has link-editing capability, is \ndelete links to the 410 resource -- whatever that means, perhaps the \nbrowser should delete a bookmark if it responds 410?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The point of 410 is to tell the client that there was a representation,\n&gt;but it is gone forever. How can you say the client can make no\n&gt;assumptions in this case, like the fact that retrying on the same URI\n&gt;later is useless?\n&gt;\n\nBecause the standards say the client can&#39;t make that assumption -- just \nbecause retrying the same request again and again for a year yields the \nsame result is no reason to assume the resource won&#39;t be re-established \nthe next day, simply because RFC 2616 leaves that up to the discretion \nof the server owner.  The 413 response explicitly means &quot;do not retry&quot; \nunless there is a Retry-After header.  Other than that, only the 403 \ncomes with the expectation of permanence, other &quot;permanent&quot; conditions \nallow for the request to be modified and retried -- 404 and 410 do not \nindicate that the request must be modified as they are &quot;transient&quot; \nconditions.  If you need the equivalence of FTP&#39;s 5yz semantics in HTTP \nthen use a 403 response.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
