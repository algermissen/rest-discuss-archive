I have put a few\n&gt; years thought into this. While I know that what I am\n&gt; about to say works directly against deep assumptions of\n&gt; current semantic web proponents, I believe it is grounded\n&gt; in reality. I also believe that we need to face these\n&gt; issues and come up with some good answers in order to\n&gt; actually achieve the semantic web.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt; \n\nFrom someone who just started exploring core web technologies and the\nsemantic web mid-2006 but having since immersed myself into learning these\nthings, I agree with the overall theme of your message though I dared not\nsay it prior till now.  (A point of note: I cannot definitely state\nagreement with every point you made because I honestly still don&#39;t have the\nbackground to fully appreciate all points.)\n\nHowever, since looking at the all the core web technologies I&#39;ve seen an\nelegance in many and a painfulness in others. The former have seen adoption\nlike a snowball with critical mass left to roll down a hill whereas others\nseem to have had the efforts of Sisyphus trying to roll the boulder up the\nmountain only to them always roll back down the hill.  URLs, HTTP, HTML,\nRSS, and microformats have seemed to be the former, RDF and in many ways XML\nand XHTML the latter.  \n\nI still can&#39;t put my finger on exactly why I feel the way I do about each of\nthose technologies, but I think it has to do with the general\napproachability of the former, and the lack thereof for the latter.\n\nFWIW.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
