But I don&#39;t think &quot;transaction resources&quot; that Bill is  \ndescribing are similar to credit card authorizations or purchase  \norders. The example that Bill outlined involves transient per client  \nstate. Marking such state as permanent resources is certainly  \npossible, but towards what end?

Where I think\n&gt;\n&gt; Well - under the disguise of a &quot;transaction&quot;, the server is  \n&gt; maintaining per-client state. In stead of answering your question  \n&gt; directly, let me ask you whether have you examined the scalability  \n&gt; characteristics of your proposed design.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may be worthwhile to start from basics, apply each constraint one  \n&gt; by one, and whether your approach benefits. The discussion around  \n&gt; the kind of resources needed, media types, link rels, link headers  \n&gt; vs link elements in some XML format are implementation details. So  \n&gt; far, this post does not make a case of why an transactional  \n&gt; application should be built the way you propose.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a minor point. There is no such thing as a &quot;sub-resource&quot;.  \n&gt; That term may be part of the mental model of some developers, but it  \n&gt; has no consequence to the protocol.\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bediako George\n&gt; Partner - Lucid Technics, LLC\n&gt; Think Clearly, Think Lucid\n&gt; www.lucidtechnics.com\n&gt; (p) 202.683.7486 (f) 703.563.6279\n\n\n"}}
