I&#39;m encouraged by what I have seen. The routing\nDSL is now oriented toward creating multi-verb resources, there seems to be good\nsupport for content negotiation, and I believe they&#39;re experimenting with\nbest-practices for making forms more RESTful using XmlHttpRequest with\nfall-backs for legacy browsers.\n\nI was able to hack Rails&#39; front-end stuff to be RESTful enough for my needs a\nlong time ago and just haven&#39;t had a chance to migrate to the new stuff on\nedge. The 1.2 release is nearing and I expect we&#39;ll see the first real \nwave of documentation on REST related enhancements included; it seems to be\none of the major additions for this release.\n\nI&#39;ve also been planning on putting an article together on how well Rails,\nDjango, and TurboGears support concepts that ought to be provided by a modern\nhigh-level HTTP framework. For an idea of what I&#39;d like to look at\nspecifically, see the section &quot;To Hell With Bad Web Frameworks&quot; in:\n\nhttp://naeblis.cx/articles/2005/04/22/on-http-abuse\n\nI&#39;d like to elaborate on each of the bullets and try to evaluate how well\neach of the aforementioned frameworks stack up.\n\nI&#39;ve had good conversations specifically related to REST and HTTP with both \nDavid Hansson (Rails) and Adrian Holovaty (Django). In general, I feel pretty \ngood about the direction and leadership behind each of these environments, even \nif the current state of these implementations aren&#39;t quite up to snuff.\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n"}}
