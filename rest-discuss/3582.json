Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n&gt; The question here is whether the availability of\n&gt; HTTP resources are dependent or independent on\n&gt; resources higher than them in the HTTP URI path\n&gt; hierarchy.  e.g. whether:\n&gt;\n&gt;   DELETE /parent\n&gt;\n&gt; implies anything about how the server should then\n&gt; respond to:\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET /parent/child\n\n/parent is not an ancestor resource.  /parent/ is.\n\n&gt; RFC2396 says:\n&gt;   URI that are hierarchical in nature use the\n&gt;   slash &quot;/&quot; character for separating\n&gt;   hierarchical components. For some file systems,\n&gt;   a &quot;/&quot; character (used to denote the hierarchical\n&gt;   structure of a URI) is the delimiter used to\n&gt;   construct a file name hierarchy, and thus the URI\n&gt;   path will look similar to a file pathname.\n&gt;   This does NOT imply that the resource is a file\n&gt;   or that the URI maps to an actual filesystem pathname.\n&gt;\n&gt; So the semantics of the hierarchical relationship\n&gt; are dependent on the scheme (or perhaps even the\n&gt; implementation) and are not specified by RFC2396.\n\nNo, the slash character is not dependent on the scheme.  It is not\nallowed to appear in any URI that does not treat the slash as being a\nhierarchical separator.  That includes &quot;http&quot; URIs.\n\n&gt; RFC 2616 (HTTP), says:\n&gt;\n&gt;   As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource\n&gt;   Identifiers are simply formatted strings which\n&gt;   identify--via name, location, or any other\n&gt;   characteristic--a resource.\n\nwhich says nothing about this discussion.\n\n&gt; Since RFC2616 makes no specific reference to\n&gt; resource hierarchies or containers, this language\n&gt; would imply that hierarchy means very little in\n&gt; HTTP and therefore the default assumption for HTTP\n&gt; should be Resource Independence.\n\nHuh?  HTTP is dependent on RFC 2396.  Every restriction in 2396\nis an absolute requirement on 2616.\n\n&gt; Roy argues that it is the Implementor&#39;s Choice;\n&gt; that resource dependence is up to the implementor.\n\nNo, I did not.  What I said was that making assumptions about the\nimplementation is strictly not allowed in REST.  Therefore, much\nof what you were arguing simply does not apply.\n\n&gt; If the resource is defined as a container of\n&gt; addressable elements, DELETEing the resource would\n&gt; DELETE its contents.  OTOH, if the resource is\n&gt; defined to be a collection, DELETEing the resource\n&gt; would affect only those applications that view the\n&gt; other resources as a collection.\n\nNo, that is completely confused.  The method defines what the user\nagent intends in regards to the identifier name space.  How the server\naccomplishes that is none of the user agent&#39;s business.  DELETE&#39;ing\na hierarchical ancestor is a request to delete the entire name space.\nThere is no other choice.  The only issue is whether a server should\nrequire that the child name space be empty before allowing the DELETE\nto succeed, and that choice is left to the server.  The client must\nbe prepared to handle a 4xx response.  The server cannot respond with\na 2xx response unless the entire name space is deleted.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
