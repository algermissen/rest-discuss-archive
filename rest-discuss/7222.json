For non-human clients, I see a mismatch  \n&gt; between the &quot;hypermedia as engine of application state&quot; model and the  \n&gt; traditional (sequential) way clients would actually carry out their  \n&gt; tasks.\n&gt;\n&gt; IOW, if clients are implemented as a sequence of HTTP requests, the  \n&gt; whole idea of the servers being able to change the state machine at  \n&gt; runtime breaks.\n\nYes. I&#39;ve always thought this was just analagous to dynamic language\ncontracts. They are what the program says they are in the\ndocumentation... if the server side changes them then the contract is\nbroken and the code has to be remade.\n\nLet&#39;s be honest, this problem isn&#39;t just about REST, it&#39;s the old\nversioning of APIs problem and is the same in just about everything\nwith a disconnect between client and server. With typed languages\n(including WS-*) there&#39;s a type checking stage that can tell you the\ncontract changed before code runs. But no more than that. It&#39;s still\nbroken.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
