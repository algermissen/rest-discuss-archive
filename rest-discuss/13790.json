The documents could contain info geared toward\nhumans and machine=\r\ns.\n\nIn fact, I&#39;ve been toying with some document format that could be used\n=\r\nby HTTP clients to generate a test-able UI (similar to the way SOAP\nclients=\r\n use WSDL) and, right now, my favorite format for this work is\nXHTML. It ha=\r\ns both link (A) and FORM elements already defined. Using\nXPATH or other too=\r\nls, any HTTP client could render this information as\neither inputs for huma=\r\nns or for a scripted machine client.\n\nI&#39;ve used this w/ a common browser th=\r\nat depends on a script library to\nsupport scanning for link relations and s=\r\nupporting PUT and DELETE as\nwell as GET and POST. But I&#39;ve not created any =\r\nother client (desktop,\nnon-browser variety). My examples are quite limited =\r\nand aimed at a\nsingle applications space, not a general tool.\n\nmca\nhttp://a=\r\nmundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Oct 10, 2009 at 20:57, Jan Vincent &lt;jvliwanag=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I see, thanks for those who&#39;ve pitched in.

What do we expect as inputs a=\r\nnd\n&gt; outputs for this client and what steps it should take. Moreover, how\n&gt;=\r\n do we express these instructions to the client? I&#39;d sure hate to code\n&gt; ev=\r\nerything manually. A DSL might make sense here.

I was wondering if such might =\r\nbe applied to work\n&gt;&gt;&gt; similarly to computers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My favorite go-to exam=\r\nple along these lines is credit card entry for\n&gt;&gt; purchases. =A0If you as a=\r\n human see a form with a heading including the\n&gt;&gt; words &quot;credit card&quot;, and =\r\nan input for a number, expiration date and\n&gt;&gt; (in\n&gt;&gt; &quot;v2&quot; of the form) a CC=\r\nV code =85 you know what to do. =A0If it asks for\n&gt;&gt; something different, y=\r\nou&#39;d be as stuck as a computer would be.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem is that versioni=\r\nng step =85 when CCV codes were introduced,\n&gt;&gt; sites could add explanatory =\r\ntext and a picture to help describe the\n&gt;&gt; new\n&gt;&gt; concept. =A0It&#39;s that lev=\r\nel of teaching that&#39;s hard to reproduce for an\n&gt;&gt; automated client; it&#39;s pr=\r\nobably the point the engineer gets involved\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; patches the code to s=\r\nupport the new field, probably by interpreting\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; same explanatory t=\r\next + picture from a trace of the recent failures of\n&gt;&gt; the automated clien=\r\nt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there a &#39;smart&#39; way for a generic RE=\r\nST client to figure out the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; meanings of the hypermedia without explicit=\r\n specifications?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the level you&#39;re thinking of, I don&#39;t believe so,=\r\n no. =A0Given\n&gt;&gt; there&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; no inherent meaning in any of this stuff, every=\r\nthing must be specified\n&gt;&gt; somehow.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; ...jsled\n&gt;&gt; http://asynchro=\r\nnous.org/ - a=3Djsled; b=3Dasynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan Vincent=\r\n Liwanag\n&gt; jvliwanag@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
