Is that right?\n\nIts not what I meant.  If you have trouble defining the semantics\nof the uniform HTTP interface with your URI, thats a good sign you\ncould use a better URI.\n\nI was drawing an analogy with Unix.  The Unix &#39;rm&#39; (remove) command\ngives you enough rope to hang yourself.  You can say &#39;rm /&#39;, which\nmeans delete every single file on the system, and rm will go right\nahead.  No &#39;are you sure&#39; message.\n\nA DELETE implementation which operates on query parameters in this\nway offers similar power.  I think its worth it though.\n\n&gt; Buko suggests that\n&gt;\n&gt;  /customers/lists/42/customers/9\n&gt;\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t answer to a GET (i.e., it isn&#39;t a resource). I thought of it \n&gt; as\n&gt; an alias for the resource /customers/9; thus, GET should return a\n&gt; Content-Location header pointing to the canonical resource URI.\n\nWhenever I find myself thinking about aliases or redirects, its\ngenerally time to invent a new resource type (cf. &#39;entry&#39; or\n&#39;membership&#39; resources).  I have to yet to encounter a situation\nwhere redirects worked better in a &#39;green field&#39; system.\n\n&gt; But the partial URI\n&gt;\n&gt;  /customers/lists/42/customers\n&gt;\n&gt; is unclear. I have an expectation that the URI should yield some\n&gt; reasonable response to GET at each level of hierarchy. This level\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to add any value.\n\nThe hierarchical property is not something mandated by REST per se,\nbut I do find its absence to be a decent &#39;bad smell&#39;; a warning that\nthere is probably a better alternative.  My best RESTful designs have\nresponded to GET at most levels of the URI hierarchy.\n\n&gt; Your suggestion doesn&#39;t have the extraneous level:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; C: DELETE /customers/lists/42/5\n&gt;&gt; S: 200 OK\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I imagine GET responding with a representation of the customer\n&gt; resource and the Content-Location header:\n&gt;\n&gt; C: GET /customers/lists/42/1\n&gt; S: 200 OK\n&gt;     Content-Location: /customers/2\n&gt;     &lt;customer data here...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What was your thought on the GET response?\n\nI didn&#39;t want to change the simple syntax of the representation so\nthat it would be easy to compare my suggestions with those already\noffered.\n\nBut I would use something based on XML as Walden suggested.  Nothing\nfancy:\n\nS: 200 OK\n    &lt;entry key=&#39;1&#39; href=&#39;/customers/2&#39;/&gt;\n\nYou can &#39;join&#39; on this, and pull in data from /customers/2 if you&#39;re\ngenerating a representation for a human-oriented user agent.\n\n\n"}}
