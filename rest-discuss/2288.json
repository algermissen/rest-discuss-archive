I think a lot of the current discussion focuses on &quot;how to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RPC in REST&quot; rather than &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yep.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree, and as an enthusiastic REST newbie, it&#39;s the cases where REST has\n&gt; a clear advantage that I would like to hear about.\n\nNo matter what side of the debate they are on, almost everyone agrees\nthat REST is better for read-only or read-mostly applications. RPC and\n&quot;messaging&quot; people sometime to argue that REST is *limited* to these\napplications  but I think it is more accurate to say that it takes more\nimagination and skill to understand how REST is also better for\nread-write applications. ;)\n\nI&#39;ve also never heard anyone dispute that REST is better for\napplications that depend upon address-keyed metadata like RSS, RDF or\nTopic Maps (to play to your biases).\n\nREST is pretty obviously better for content-management style\napplications.\n\nREST has clear advantages when the human implementors of systems are not\ncoordinated. i.e. when you can&#39;t upgrade the participants all at the\nsame time.\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
