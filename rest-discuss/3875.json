I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re \n&gt; ideal or optimal (how would we know?).\n\nThey&#39;re optimal in the sense that they are meaningful (though perhaps\nnot &quot;implemented&quot;) with every resource.  You&#39;d know that they weren&#39;t\nif there existed a single resource for which any of the methods were\nnot meaningful.\n\nI sometimes liken this to java.lang.Object, for illustrative purposes.\nIf it included a method which didn&#39;t make sense to all objects, then\nnot all objects could extend it.\n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s fine for HTTP&#39;s interface to be used in a manner which is more\n&gt; &gt; specific than HTTP defines, if the two parties agree.  But when Roy\n&gt; &gt; talks about the difficulty of extension, what I think he means is that\n&gt; &gt; on the wilds of the Web, private agreements like that are problematic\n&gt; &gt; because they&#39;re not visible and require out-of-band agreement.  To be\n&gt; &gt; RESTful requires ensuring messages are self-descriptive and therefore\n&gt; &gt; declare any &quot;extended intentions&quot; (but unfortunately, HTTP 1.1 doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; support doing that).\n&gt; \n&gt; In work we call these &#39;bilateral exchanges&#39;. They have immediate \n&gt; utility and are attractive for that, but the costs rise as more \n&gt; parties want to communicate, yada yada.\n&gt; \n&gt; The hardest part is getting the first three parties to agree to \n&gt; uniformity. The fourth party always thinks it&#39;s a no-brainer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect the problem Alex really wants to fix is pinning down \n&gt; content models for exchanges of representations and not HTTP \n&gt; methods, which are fine. That&#39;s work that can be tackled outside \n&gt; HTTP entirely, I&#39;m not sure about REST. It&#39;s also a main beef of \n&gt; mine with SOAP/WSDL. All that effort and we&#39;re not really any closer \n&gt; to having solid content models - I wish FIPA would get some \n&gt; marketing dollars behind it :)\n\nI don&#39;t know what he means by &quot;Content models&quot;.  RDF maybe?\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
