I would want to test this in quite a few environments before  \nrelying on it for a production system.  Even with significant testing,  \nI&#39;d be nervous if I used it for general consumption.\n\nYou might also find that client libraries (e.g. XHR) will not send a  \nbody with a GET request.  That was my experience with a recent  \nimplementation of XHR in IE.  Unless you feel like rolling your own  \nHTTP library (eww), this could be problematic.\n-----\nDavid Sidlinger\ndavid.sidlinger@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
