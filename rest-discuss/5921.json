Otherwise, I&#39;m not sure that the entry URI  \n&gt; approach is very useful. Has anyone had success with this other than  \n&gt; on the domain home URL?\n\nBased on my experience with the Restlet tutorial page at \nhttp://www.restlet.org/tutorial I initially had three versions: HTML, \nPDF and Word referenced from the home page. Each one was also \naddressable by a more specific URI, for example \nhttp://www.restlet.org/tutorial.pdf Content negotiation is available on \nall resources of my site, based on the files available and on their \nextensions: PDF, HTML, DOC map to the correct media type, EN and FR map \nto the correct language, etc. In addition, media type and language \nextensions can be combined.\n\nOne problem I had was that I didn&#39;t test all the links with Internet \nExplorer as I&#39;m using Firefox... Unfortunately, IE gives a higher \npriority to Word media type than to HTML! See IE accept header: \n&quot;image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, \napplication/x-shockwave-flash, application/vnd.ms-excel, \napplication/msword, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, */*&quot;\n\nTo me the best practice seems to be:\n1) Use cool URIs (aka entry URI, aka permalink) wherever possible, \nespecially for entry pages like home pages\n2) When a cool URI is requested, be very careful about the pretended \npreferences of the user agent (see issue with IE) and try to return the \nbest representation available, generally in HTML.\n3) In the cool representation, add links in a prominent place allowing \nthe user to reach alternate representations. Based on the current \nlanguage, add links to alternate formats available in this language. \nAlso add links to alternate languages for the HTML format.\n4) If a user follows a more specific URI (aka target URI), then also add \na link back to the cool URI (aka permalink).\n\nThe expected results are:\n1) If cool URIs are correctly implemented, they should return a \nsatisfying representation in &quot;80%&quot; of cases without requiring additional \naction from the user. Also, bookmarks will point to the cool URI.\n2) As more specific URIs are available, users are not limited by their \nuser agent preferences and can easily select the best representation for \nthem, which can change depending on the context as Bill explained. Users \ncan also bookmark these specific URIs.\n3) Finally, in the 20% of cases where the user selected a specific URI, \nhe always has the cool URI/permalink available if he wants to share the \nURI with other users.\n\n-- \nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n"}}
