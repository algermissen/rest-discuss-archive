From the HTTP  \n&gt; spec I read &quot;Th=\r\ne Accept request-header field can be used to specify  \n&gt; certain media type=\r\ns which are acceptable for the response.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it mean it&#39;s not recomme=\r\nnded to adapt the content a priori. For  \n&gt; example, I have two resources:\n=\r\n&gt; \t=95 an XML document that references an image\n&gt; \t=95 the image in multipl=\r\ne formats (jpeg, png, gif)\n&gt; For different reasons (e.g. caching), I would =\r\nlike to have static  \n&gt; URLs for the images. Therefore, the type of image t=\r\no return to the  \n&gt; client should be decided when the client request the XM=\r\nL document to  \n&gt; point to the correct image type.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it acceptable to =\r\nspecify the list of supported image formats  \n&gt; during the first request (X=\r\nML document fetch)? Do you see any reason  \n&gt; I should not do that?\n&gt;\n\nYou =\r\ncan certainly use different URIs for each format, but doing so can  \nbreak =\r\ncaching. When you use the Accept header to determine which  \nformat to retu=\r\nrn, you can let caches know what you used the Accept  \nheader to determine =\r\nthe representation by returning the header &quot;Vary:  \nAccept&quot; in the response=\r\n. Based on this, caches can maintain multiple  \nrepresentations (one for ea=\r\nch format) against the same URI for the  \nresource. Caches will also be abl=\r\ne to flush all these representations  \nwhen a client does a PUT to that URI=\r\n. But when you use multiple URIs,  \none for each format, caches will not be=\r\n able to do so. Please refer to  \nthe archives as this topic was discussed =\r\nat length a couple of months  \nago (sorry - don&#39;t have the link handy).\n\nSu=\r\nbbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
