My current web service encapsulates an \napplication=\r\n that is wired with Spring.\n\nIn my web service usage, the intent is to pass=\r\n around the query and \nresponse in the form of xml along with other string =\r\nquery parameters.\n\nCurrently my web service is exposed through Soap.\nI rece=\r\nntly came across that one of Soap limitations is that the data \nelement siz=\r\ne in the xml document is 32K (I am not sure if it is true \nyet, I appreciat=\r\ne your input here).\nTo avoid this restriction, I started exploring Rest. \nI=\r\nt looks like Rest is an architectural style and has the following \nmain adv=\r\nantages over SOAP:\n- it does not need development tools\n-the url of the res=\r\nources can be internally mapped to the changed \nservice&#39;s api.\n-usage of ht=\r\ntp get\n-usage of nouns in uri and there is no need for ? in the uri. \n\nBut =\r\nI intent to expose my web service both thru SOAP and Rest.\n\nCurrently my SO=\r\nAP based web service is running in a web container \nand I want to add Rest =\r\nversion of the web service.\n\nWhat I am not clear is how to implement Rest a=\r\nnd i have the \nfollowing questions:\n\n1) does Rest based web sevice invlove =\r\nsimplying exposing an xml \ndocument that has the uris for different resourc=\r\nes to the web \nservice clients and return the queried data in xml form?\n\n2)=\r\n I do not see the need for the mvc pattern to be implemented here \nas my se=\r\nrvice is not a true web application.\n\n3) I do not see the need to use Restl=\r\net Frame Work since my intent \nis to use the web container ONLY to support =\r\nSoap based web service. \nAlso I do not want to embed the overhead of router=\r\ns and resources \nand servletconvertor.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nAlso an example cod=\r\ne of the Rest based web service is appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your=\r\n valuable input, time and interest. \n\n\n\n"}}
