The \n&gt; average developer would probably appreciate and understand \n&gt; these simple rules and patterns a lot more easily than an \n&gt; Architectural Style. As long as the author is clear that \n&gt; these patterns are not defined by REST and that there are \n&gt; other ways to build RESTful interfaces then I think its fine.\nI agree - after I sent my comments I thought that maybe the page wasn&#39;t a\ntutorial on REST, so much as how that particular framework does things. But\nthere are portions that are not server framework specific - like the\ndescription of a second DELETE request failing. Describing those correctly\ndoesn&#39;t hurt.\n\n\n\n"}}
