I&#39;m going to dig into it a bit more.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Agreed.  Unfortunately Atom and RSS are not always the best types for\n&gt; conveying representation of a resource.  I&#39;m not sure I agree with\n&gt; the need to share schemas of represenation with clients - what if the\n&gt; type is JSON or something else?  Then I couldn&#39;t use a schema.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\n\nTrue, some formats are better at self-description than others.\nMime-types like JPEG, etc. are fully described and well understood by\nclients. HTML is also well understood (if loose). XML really has\nalmost nothing. Niether does JSON in the way to description. some\nbasic rules and that&#39;s all.  Atom, however, is very well described.\n\nI have worked up an Atom representation for the TaskList example this\nweek. Right now, I am working on a JSON representation.  I hope to\nhave them added to the sample over the next few days.\n\nMCA\n\n"}}
