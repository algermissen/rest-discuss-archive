This isn&#39;t a DELETE operation since I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; destroy the &#39;b&#39; I just want to remove it from &#39;a&#39;.\n\nGive the membership of b within a a unique key (probably 1,2,3..\nif your collection is a list), so you end up with a URL like /a/1\nwhich you can DELETE without affecting b.  Other methods\n(GET/PUT/POST etc.) on /a/1 can be redirected to the appropriate\ntarget URL.\n\n&gt; One obvious\n&gt; solution would be to POST something like a &#39;remove-b url=&quot;...&quot;&#39;\n&gt; document to the &#39;a&#39; resource but this seems like a kludge. What then,\n&gt; is the best way to model this operation RESTfully?\n\nIf you are using HTML forms, which don&#39;t support DELETE or PUT,\nI reckon it is OK to use POST, and include a hidden parameter\n&quot;method=DELETE&quot; or similar in the submitted form.  The server\ncan pre-process this and do the Right Thing.\n\n(This is just my opinion, others will chime in if what I&#39;m saying\nis bogus.)\n\n\n"}}
