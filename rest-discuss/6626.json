I&#39;m puzzled about how to present what it is they&#39;re going to\n&gt; PUT/DELETE. Don&#39;t yet see an action here.\n\nThat would depend on what was being deleted.  It could be a button\non the browser frame for &quot;delete this resource&quot;, or it could be an\nicon next to each entry on a page that looks like a folder tree, or\nit could be a button on the bottom of a scrollable list of URI\nreferences, or it could be a button next to the edit link on a blog\nentry.  I am sure there are other URIs that could be deleted, so\nbasically anything for which the client has a URI could be a\npotential target for a DELETE, though it would only be presented\nas such when appropriate or when the current page requests it in the\nform of an &lt;input method=&quot;DELETE&quot;&gt; (or something like it).\n\nLikewise for PUT.  Every MS application has the same icon for\n&quot;Save to disk&quot; -- we should have one for &quot;Save to Web&quot; too.\n\n&gt;&gt; Nothing specific off-hand.  All you need to logout of an HTTP session\n&gt;&gt; is a UI for telling the browser to stop sending its cached  \n&gt;&gt; credential,\n&gt;&gt; which was obvious to everyone except the browser developers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh... you mean stop sending HTTP authentication credentials (I was\n&gt; thinking cookies). Yah, we need an HTML widget for that. Firefox\n&gt; already has that functionality exposed in chrome. I&#39;ll see if I can\n&gt; get that implemented... I can do the backend, but I might need help to\n&gt; implement the widget.\n\nYep, there&#39;s nothing we can do about cookie auth aside from removing\nthe reasons to use it.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
