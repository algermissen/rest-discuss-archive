The goal of my the=\r\nsis is the development of a graphical\n&gt; modeling language for resource-orie=\r\nnted (aka RESTful) applications\n&gt; following criteria defined by Daniel Mood=\r\ny [1].\n&gt; Part of this development is also the evaluation of the new languag=\r\ne I\n&gt; have developed regarding these criteria.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would therefore like t=\r\no ask you for your support by taking the\n&gt; questionnaire I have devised to =\r\ndo that evaluation. Filling out the\n&gt; questionnaire will take about 20 minu=\r\ntes. It is available online under\n&gt; the following URL:\n&gt; http://bit.ly/visu=\r\nalRest\n&gt;\n&gt; As a small &quot;thank you&quot; for filling out the questionnaire, you al=\r\nso\n&gt; have the chance to win one of three books afterwards (details can be\n&gt;=\r\n found under the aforementioned URL).\n&gt;\n&gt; The questionnaire is online and r=\r\neady to take input starting today\n&gt; (February 7th) and will be closed on Fe=\r\nbruary 20th.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really appreciate your help and am looking forward=\r\n to your\n&gt; answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you and best regards,\n&gt; Oliver van Porten\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
