For one thing it would be impossible to bookmark the page.\n\nI have often wondered what Range headers could be used for at the\napplication level. The only practical use I can think of is to get the\ntail of a resource that is constantly being extended. Kind of a\n&#39;tail -f&#39; over the internet.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Elias Sinderson [mailto:elias@...]\nSent: Wednesday, 16 March 2005 12:33 PM\nTo: Donald Strong\nCc: John Elliot; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] URIs and &#39;pagination&#39;\n\n\nDonald Strong wrote:\n\n&gt;[...] Now if you have more than one thing and many of them are two large to\nbe displayed in their entirety, perhaps because they are potentially large\nlists, then you might provide a generic way of pagenating them using\nstandard parameters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nThere is a generic mechanism specified for HTTP/1.1 in the form of\nvarious request / response headers. Specifically, I refer to the\nAccept-Ranges, Content-Range, If-Range and Range headers. I responded as\nmuch to John off list but hadn&#39;t the time to reference the spec for a\ndefinitive answer. There are  some difficulties in that clients and\nservers aren&#39;t required to support these features, however all of the\nissues I&#39;ve considered can be addressed with redirects, proxies, etc.\n\n&gt;[...] once you have decided on content how do you lock it into the URI?\nSegment parameters perhaps? Others will have\n&gt;opinions on this.\n&gt;   /my-app/my-thing;content=pdf\n&gt;\n&gt;\nMy preference is to *not* encode content type in the URI at all. Again,\nHTTP provides several Accept headers for this purpose and, also again,\nthere are some difficulties associated with this approach due to the\nfractured implementation landscape that one can work around if there is\na desire to be &#39;pure&#39; about it.\n\n&gt;But then there is the slicing up into pages which does not fit into content\nnegotiation. If you use the analogy of a query is like asking a question of\na resource then the question is &quot;can I see the first 10 of your items\nplease&quot;.\n&gt;   /my-app/my-thing?range=1-10\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI mentioned the various Range headers above, and I should not that\nHTTP/1.1 only specifies *byte* ranges, although the mechanism is\nextensible and pagination seem like a reasonable addition - at least for\n*some* applications.\n\n&gt;I notice that the way it is done on the rest-discuss web site is [...] This\nseems a reasonably neat and understandable way of doing it. It defines\nanother set of resources, each of which is a list of messages. This\neffectively moves one parameter from the query side to the path side of the\nURI.\n&gt;There is no &#39;one way suits all&#39; in this, but I hope the suggestions above\nare a help.\n&gt;\nIn the context of pagination, this approach requires storing each page\nas a separate resource, analogous to the way email messages are\nrepresented in the example. This may be a reasonable approach, depending\non the application, but potentially leads to other content and version\nmanagement issues. ... I agree that there is no one solution as Donald\nmentions, but will vary by the application and, to a lesser extent, the\nfeature sets supported by the client(s) and server(s).\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\n\n"}}
