Cookies represent p=\r\nieces of application state that are stored with the client, and they get se=\r\nnt on every request (where domains apply). Why isn&#39;t that RESTful?\n&gt;   \nWel=\r\nl, this is what REST gurus [1] are telling us:\n\n    /*&quot;The Trouble with Coo=\r\nkies*\n    A web service that sends HTTP cookies violates the principle of\n =\r\n   statelessness. In fact, it usually violates statelessness twice. It\n    =\r\nmoves application state onto the server even though it belongs on\n    the c=\r\nlient, and it stops clients from being in charge of their own\n    applicati=\r\non state.&quot;\n    ...\n    OK, so cookies shouldn&#39;t contain session IDs: that&#39;s=\r\n just an excuse\n    to keep application state on the server. What about coo=\r\nkies that\n    really do contain application state? What if you serialize th=\r\ne\n    actual session hash and send it as a cookie, instead of just sending\n=\r\n    a reference to a hash on the server?\n    This can be RESTful, but it&#39;s =\r\nusually not. The cookie standard says\n    that the client can get rid of a =\r\ncookie when it expires, or when the\n    client terminates. This is a pretty=\r\n big restriction on the client&#39;s\n    control over application state. If you=\r\n make 10 web requests and\n    suddenly the server sends you a cookie, you h=\r\nave to start sending\n    this cookie with your future requests. You can&#39;t m=\r\nake those 10\n    precookie requests unless you quit and start over. To use =\r\na web\n    browser analogy, your &quot;Back&quot; button is broken. You can&#39;t put the\n=\r\n    application in any of the states it was in before you got the cookie.\n =\r\n   ...\n    The only RESTful use of cookies is one where the client is in ch=\r\narge\n    of the cookie value. The server can suggest values for a cookie\n  =\r\n  using the Set-Cookie header, just like it can suggest links the\n    clien=\r\nt might want to follow, but the client chooses what cookie to\n    send just=\r\n as it chooses what links to follow. In some browser-based\n    applications=\r\n, cookies are created by the client and never sent to\n    the server. The c=\r\nookie is just a convenient container for\n    application state, which makes=\r\n its way to the server in\n    representations and URIs. That&#39;s a very RESTf=\r\nul use of cookies.&quot;\n\n    /\n\nI hope the authors don&#39;t mind the long citation=\r\n .\n\nBest regards,\nNina\n\n[1] Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby, RESTful Web Se=\r\nrvices, O&#39;Reilly\n2007, p.252\n\n&gt; (Noting that some cookies may contain more =\r\ninteresting information than JSESSIONID, for example. I agree with an under=\r\nstand the general assessment that server-side session storage is not RESTfu=\r\nl).\n&gt;\n&gt; Jon\n&gt; ........\n&gt; Jon Moore\n&gt; Comcast Interactive Media\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----=\r\n-Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Ni=\r\nna Jeliazkova\n&gt; Sent: Thu 10/8/2009 10:53 AM\n&gt; To: Subbu Allamaraju\n&gt; Cc: j=\r\neliazkova.nina@...; Rest List\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] compositi=\r\non of REST services\n&gt;  \n&gt; Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Learning how to a=\r\nuthenticate is no different from leaning about the\n&gt;&gt; media types and forma=\r\nts.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mean to undermine the difficulty here, but the problem do=\r\nes\n&gt;&gt; not change just because a URI belongs to a server different from the\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; one that served the representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; The difficulty=\r\n is not in the authentication itself, but with the\n&gt; federated authenticati=\r\non/authorization, encompassing multiple servers.\n&gt; Otherwise, it is pretty =\r\neasy to protect each resource with arbitrary\n&gt; kind of available authentica=\r\ntion scheme and ask the client to provide\n&gt; credentials on each POST.
