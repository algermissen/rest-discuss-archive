We&#39;re (hopefully) going to have a collection of many services in multiple domains and we&#39;ll be expected to have a standard &#39;template&#39; for defining/documenting a service. I&#39;m curious if anyone in an &quot;enterprise&quot; situation has run into that and has any advice.\n\ndefinitely not off-topic! this is a problem that a lot of people are \nstruggling with (including us right now). at times, there is some \ngeneral pushback to &quot;describe&quot; things because that might encourage \ndevelopers to hardcode things, especially things such as URI patterns \nthat they shouldn&#39;t hardcode. so &quot;descriptions&quot; putting URI patterns on \ntop always look a little unfortunate, in the end these things probably \nhave been designed for generating the server side, and not so much for \nguiding client-side developers. but in the end, if you have services, \nyou want internal/external people to find them, in particular if you&#39;re \nserious about SOA and have a lot of them [1].\n\nthere have been individual efforts to come up with a language, off the \ntop of my head in addition to WADL i can list our own approach ReLL [2], \nRESTdesc [3], and SA-REST [4]. they all take a little different \napproaches and all of them have been discussed controversially. in the \nend, the main question is what you need the registry for, and what \nthings you cannot so by runtime discovery. we&#39;re currently struggling \nwith that, too, and i am pretty confident that we want to have some \ndeveloper resources made accessible somewhere, such as \ntools/examples/contacts/schemas. in the end, my guess is it comes down \nto documenting representations and link relations, and this can be done \nby namespacing all these things and then using a mechanism for \ndescribing namespaces [5]. i think there still is room in this space for \nsomething to become established and easily usable so that it is useful \nacross SOA domains, but as long as things are (services to their \ndescriptions) linked, it&#39;s nicely RESTful even if everybody does what \nfits their needs best.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n[1] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3101876\n[2] http://dret.net/netdret/publications#ala10a\n[3] http://restdesc.org/\n[4] http://www.w3.org/Submission/SA-REST/\n[5] http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil06h\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
