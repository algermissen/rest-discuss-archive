I&#39;m getting a 404 at\n&gt; http://www.searchalert.net/searchalert/users/activate.jsp. I&#39;m looking\n&gt; forward to seeing what you have here.\nThe server went bonkers the other day (the router is having fits) but it\nshould be resolved now.\nI&#39;ll find out what&#39;s up with that 404...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But I actually had a couple of comments and questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; Comments:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Have you considered allowing people to register blog accounts?\nYes. I want to incorporate multiple source types (google web, google news,\nblogdex, amazon products, ebay listings, etc.) and multiple destination\ntypes (html mail, xml mail, pager, http POST, etc.).\n\n&gt; The idea is that you get a story of interest based on a user&#39;s\nsubscriptions, dress\n&gt; the story up in RSS syntax, then POST it to the users registered URL via\n&gt; RESTLog.\n&gt;\n&gt; A person&#39;s weblog could be getting automatically updated:  InstaBlog.\nYeah - I&#39;ll take a look at the various blogging apis. I&#39;d probably use\nGoogle news as the source, or actually just provide a checkbox list of\nsources and let the user decide. Power to the people, and all that.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Is there anyway to have the pure XML returned by from Google on your\n&gt; return mailed to the registered account?\nI&#39;m actually doing scraping with regular expressions. The XML from Google\nrequires a developer ID (which I have) but is limited to 1000 per day.\nIf you register as an affiliate, I currently provide a template for the mail\nnotification body - you can make it whatever XML you want. The mail\ncontent-type header still says &#39;text/html&#39; but I can add a choice for that.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. If 2 is possible, it would be nice to have a registered XSLT stylesheet\n&gt; processing instruction glued on the top.\nYou can edit the template to add that if you like.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Is it possible to register for digest (i.e., newspaper :)) format?\n&gt; Given enough stories, that match the subscription and a little HTML window\ndressing,\n&gt; each morning there could be a newspaper waiting for you on you doorstop\n(email account.)\nSomeday... that adds more processing and state & I haven&#39;t gone there yet.\nHmm... maybe it&#39;s not that hard... add a column for each delivery mode and\nset the value based on whether it&#39;s been delivered... code another agent...\nhmm... time for a new pot of coffee...\n\nI&#39;m in the mode of finding users/customers & then I&#39;ll prioritize features.\nI&#39;d like the system to get rich and flexible enough to build this newspaper\ntype system without my code knowing too much about the use it will be put\nto.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Question:\n&gt;\n&gt; How are you handling Google on your end?\n&gt; Do you use the SOAP API? How do you deal with the 1000 hits/day issue?\nNo, I just do an HTTP GET and use regular expressions. Until I want more\nmetadata I&#39;ll keep it at that. When I move to the richer API, I&#39;ll have to\ntalk to Google & do something. I&quot;m hoping to get some users first...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\nThank you! Keep the ideas coming.\n\n"}}
