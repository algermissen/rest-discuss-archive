Some resources are hit c=\r\nounters that increment every time a client GETs them. Most web servers log =\r\nevery incoming request to a log file. These are side effects: the server st=\r\nate, and even the resource state, is changing in response to a GET request.=\r\n But the client didn&#39;t ask for the side effects, and it&#39;s not responsible f=\r\nor them. A client should never make a GET or HEAD request just for the side=\r\n effects, and the side effects should never be so big that the client might=\r\n wish it hadn&#39;t made the request.&quot;\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t think GETting a con=\r\nfirmation page is too much of an abuse of GET. And email confirmation is al=\r\nready mixing HTTP semantics with SMTP. But that&#39;s just my opinion.\n\n-L\n--- =\r\nIn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Felipe Ga=EF=BF=BDcho &lt;fgaucho@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt; \n&gt; my first email here...\n&gt; \n&gt; question: I have a registra=\r\ntion flow that includes the following steps:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) client send a POST wit=\r\nh the new user&#39;s data.\n&gt; 2) the server sends an email to the new user conta=\r\nining  a &quot;Confirmation URL&quot;\n&gt; 3) the user clicks on the URL, confirming his=\r\n registration request...\n&gt; \n&gt; So far so good, the basics of a registration =\r\nuse case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the question:\n&gt; \n&gt; The URL in the email should be a GET,=\r\n right ?
