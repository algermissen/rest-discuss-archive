Somehow a physical thermometer changes a byte in RAM or on disk and\ninforms a piece of software that it has done so.\n\n2. There is Web gateway software that exposes this byte as a resource: \n\n * http://www.weather.com/90210/temperature : &quot;5&quot;\n\n3. The Web gateway software tells anyone who has registered to watch\nthat URL that it has been changed.\n\n4. If they want the new value, they can GET it. Or they could have\nregistered that they want inline values earlier. The notification\nprobably looks like this:\n\nPOST www.mymicroserver.com/mysubscriptions/23123\nTarget-URI: http://www.weather.com/90210/temperature\nHTTP-method: PUT\n\n(maybe message body here, maybe not)\n\n 5. There is another URI. It *represents* the subscription. If the\nclient just wants to let the subscription peter out, it can ignore that\nURI. If it wants to actively manage it then it needs to work with the\nsubscription URI.\n\n&gt; This is getting too complicated.\n&gt; Do you have any HTTP event systems to play with? Doing it with real working\n&gt; code is much much more educational.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you don&#39;t, go and grab KnowNow&#39;s event router and bang out some\n&gt; javascript listeners.\n\nI can&#39;t see any connection point between what we&#39;ve been talking about\nand what they have implemented. They have a &quot;do_method&quot; thingee that\nseems basically RPC-ish. The payload is a header? They have explicit\nevent routing? It seems to be inherently peer-to-peer whereas HTTP&#39;s\nunderlying model is client/server. Overall, it seems much more\ncomplicated than what I was thinking of.\n\nMost important, I can&#39;t figure out how to do what I want to do which is\nask to be notified when a web resource changes its value. As far as I\ncan tell, the &quot;gateway&quot; would have to publish to the &quot;topic&quot;. Merely\nchanging a resource is not sufficient to trigger a message. But maybe I\nmisunderstand that part.\n\n&gt; If you are into Java servlets, check out\n&gt; http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/destiny/ - i&#39;ll see if I can get it\n&gt; running somewhere public next week.\n\nI&#39;m not really sure that we should use a message queuing paradigm as a\nstarting point. I think that an HTTP API for JMS would turn quite\ndifferent than a notifications mechanism for the Web.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
