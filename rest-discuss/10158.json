My usual interpretation is that creating an\norder is different from submitting an order.\n\nAn order is an offer to buy.  It usually goes through a business\nprotocol called Offer-Acceptance (Google for it).\n\nSubmit order usually means submit the offer to the seller to see if it\nis accepted or not.\n\nSo for example you might create an order and save it as a resource\nwithout submitting it for acceptance.  Maybe even change it before\nsubmitting it, since changing it after acceptance means another\noffer-acceptance protocol for the changes.\n\nBut Stefan&#39;s case appears to be a design for the seller&#39;s internal\nsystem, where creating an order may mean it already has been submitted\nby the customer and accepted by the seller.\n\nOr maybe I&#39;m wrong...\n\n"}}
