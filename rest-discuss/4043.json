This is\n: &gt;: the case for what is commonly referred to as &#39;static content&#39;.\n: &gt;\n: &gt;Hold it.  You&#39;re calling an URI a resource above.  That&#39;s going to\n: &gt;cause confusion.  Are you saying that the first URI identifies two\n: &gt;resources, namely the one that it identifies directly, and also the one\n: &gt;that can be identified directly by the second URI?  First let me get\n: &gt;that part straight.\n: &gt;\n: &gt;\n: Arrrggg.  I did not call a URI a resource.  I identified a resource by\n: using its name.\n: I refuse to go around talking about resources as &#39;the resource\n: identified by http://...&#39;.  It&#39;s a resource and it has a name - when I\n: talk about it, I&#39;ll use its name.  Do you refer to other people as &#39;the\n: human identified by Fred&#39;, or do you just say Fred.\n\nChuck (does that answer your last question?), ordinarily I&#39;d agree\nwith you, but you&#39;re talking about a system now in which a URI\nidentifies more than one resource, and that caused me a problem\nin trying to understand what you wrote.  So sorry.\n\n:\n: (Yes, I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;m tired of having to argure the whole way back\n: to first principles every time a statement is made.  Sometimes I think\n: some wicked grammar school teacher has exacted her revenge by having\n: taught me an alternate version of the English language - one that seems\n: similar on the surface, but is different enough to cause me problems any\n: time I try to convey ideas to someone else.  Either that, or I&#39;m some\n: kind of strange Italian who can&#39;t communicate without using a whiteboard.)\n:\n: &gt;If that&#39;s your claim, then I&#39;ll now need to know more about what\n: &gt;the phrase &quot;used to produce a representation of&quot; really means.  Do\n: &gt;you  mean they share a representation?  Do you mean something\n: &gt;which occurs in the server implementation that cannot be observed\n: &gt;on the network?  Are you sure this is any form of identification at\n: &gt;all, let alone &quot;indirect identification&quot;?  I have no idea, as the phrase\n: &gt;&quot;indirect identification&quot; is new to me.\n: &gt;\n:\n: When a representation is produced (in order to satisfy a GET, for\n: instance), the bits that comprise it are either dynamically calculated\n: at the time the request is made, or retrieved from some other resource(s).\n: In the cases where those bits are retrieved from some other resource, I\n: claim that those other resources are indirectly indentified.\n\nI don&#39;t follow the language there, sorry.  You could always argue\nthat the representation produced is &quot;retrieved from some other resource&quot;,\nwhether it was calculated dynamically or not.  I&#39;m looking for significant\ndistinctions to understand &quot;indirect identification&quot; and not finding them.\nThat&#39;s my frustration with this thread.\n\n:\n: Now perhaps I&#39;ve twisted the definition of &#39;indirect&#39;, but I don&#39;t think\n: so.\n:\n: If I identify a group of people as &#39;White males&#39;, do I not also also\n: indirectly indentify myself by virtue of belonging to that group.\n\nYou&#39;re definitely twisting the definition of &quot;identify&quot; here, because\nidentifying that group *does not* identify you, in the sense that it does\nnot make you *definitively recognizable* among the group.  It&#39;s not\nthat it&#39;s indirect (i.e., via some intermediate means), it&#39;s that it&#39;s in-\ndeterminate:  &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a group of white guys.  Which one is Chuck?&quot;\n\n:\n:\n: &gt;:\n: &gt;: Or\n: &gt;: Directly identified resource:  http://example.com/pictures/picture1\n: &gt;: Indirectly identified resources:\nfile://docroot/story/images/picture1.jpg,\n: &gt;:   file://docroot/story/images/picture1.png,\n: &gt;: file://docroot/story/images/picture1.gif\n: &gt;: where content negotation on the directly identified resource results in\n: &gt;: the use of the representation of one of the indirectly identified\n: &gt;: resources as the representation of the directly identified resource.\n: &gt;\n: &gt;That doesn&#39;t really seem any different, except that you&#39;ve introduced\n: &gt;content negotiation.  Are you implying that all content negotiation\n: &gt;scenarios involve the &quot;indirect identification&quot; phenomenon?\n: &gt;\n: &gt;\n: &gt;\n: I didn&#39;t intend to imply that its true for ALL content negotiation\n: (although it might very well be).  I just saw content negotiation for\n: static content as a way to illustrate how directly identifiying one\n: resource MIGHT result in the indirect identification of other resources.\n\nThat&#39;s interesting, because I think it&#39;s true that identifying a resource\nis a means of indirectly identifying a *representation* (in the sense that\none and only one will be dished up per GET [identified], and the\nrepresentation is\nnot the thing you directly identified, but was available through an\nintermediate mapping [indirect]).  It&#39;s also true that REST does not\nguarantee\ndeterministic identification of a representation via its resource: if there\nare two, you might get either one.\n\n:\n: &gt;I&#39;m concerned  about the quality of the terminology, especially the\n: &gt;term &quot;indirect&quot;.  To me, it doesn&#39;t mean indeterminate; it just means\n: &gt;that the identification is multi-stage.  In\n: &gt;this setting, that implies identifier that points to identifier that\n: &gt;points...\n: &gt;until something other than a pointer results.\n: &gt;\n: I don&#39;t understand why you think it means indeterminate.  It&#39;s no more\n: indeterminate than the relationship between a resource and its\n: representations over time.\n\nI was guessing; indirection does lay some of the groundwork for\npossible indeterminism.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re totally unrelated.\n:\n: &gt;\n: &gt;If the phenomenon is something other than that, I&#39;ll bet a better\n: &gt;terminology can be found.  Like &quot;selection via association&quot; maybe.\n: &gt;\n: &gt;\n: I dont understand what &quot;selection via association&quot; means.\n\nWell, I think Roy was explaining that sometimes hypetext authors\nmake reference to a resource that&#39;s not quite what they mean, but\nit&#39;s associated with the intended meaning, and it&#39;s close in meaning,\nand it&#39;s close at hand.  So they select it.  That would be selection\nby association, wouldn&#39;t it?\n\n:\n: In my mind, indirect indentification is, in part, a result of resource\n: composition - resources can be composed of other resources.\n\nWhat an interesting statement!  What would that look like?  I\nvisualize it as the union of two or more resource mappings.  How\nabout you?\n\n:\n: --Chuck\n:\n: PS.  Have you ever had the experience where you&#39;ve said a word over and\n: over so many times that it eventually begins to sound like gibberish.\n: Well, when I pronounce the sequence of letters  i-d-e-n-t-i-f-i-e-d, I\n: hear only noise.\n\nWhen I do it, I hear a sequence of letters.  Are you pronouncing the\ndashes, by any chance?  :-)\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
