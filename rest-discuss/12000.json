The POST is to a URI. We can argue whether the word &quot;mover&quot;\n&gt;    is a verb or noun, but that is opaque as far as the protocol\n&gt;    is concerned.\n\nBy that token you need only one URI and only POST. Err, wait…\n\n&gt; 2. The fact that the representation refers to other resources\n&gt;    does not break the uniform interface.\n\nYou aren’t talking about anything I said. Since I suggested\nsending one of the URIs in the entity body myself, I don’t know\nwhat argument you think I was making.\n\n&gt; 3. Intermediaries do not need to parse the request to route it.\n&gt;    The media type, if a proper one is used, will indicate what\n&gt;    representation is being exchanged.\n\nWe had the media type proliferation argument in another thread.\n\n&gt; 4. Caches will not be able to flush, and that is true for any\n&gt;    operation that spawns multiple resources resources. The\n&gt;    solution by Stefan, by you, and the one I posted have the\n&gt;    same characteristic. That&#39;s why we have invalidation\n&gt;    caching.\n\nThe solutions that POST to one of the nodes will fail to\ninvalidate the other; the solution you proposed will fail to\ninvalidate *any* of them.\n\n&gt; I could change the URI to the source or target node in this\n&gt; specific example, but once we extend this example to include,\n&gt; say, ten nodes instead of two\n\nSeems like architecture astronautics. One specific problem was\ngiven. I see no reason to care about how the proposed solution\ngeneralises to a problem I don’t have – since any solution to\neither problem is going to be a compromise anyway.\n\n(But in fact it generalises no worse. You simply POST more than\none source URI to the target URI. It only breaks down once you\nposit that there can be more than one target URI, but *that*\nproblem is *so* much more complex (how do you specify which\ntarget takes which entries from which source?) that I say YAGNI\nuntil it crops up.)\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
