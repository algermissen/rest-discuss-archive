Here are some off-the-top (hopefully not over-the-top ;-)\nthoughts about these issues...\n\n(1)  Side-effects.  I&#39;m not 100% convinced its correct to view the\nnotification request behavior as a side-effect.  It doesn&#39;t actually impact\nthe content returned beyond adding a header and *later* producing an effect\nthat wouldn&#39;t exist otherwise;  a proxy doesn&#39;t necessarily have visibility\nto the latter, so it&#39;s not clear that it&#39;s side-effecting from the proxy&#39;s\npoint-of-view.  Determination of idempotency -wrt- heavers vs. content is a\nbit ambiguous.\n\n(2) Note that WD-Proxy was originally intended to allow proxies to request\ninvalidation notifications from origin servers.  Given that the requesting\nparty identifies themselves inline with distinct headers, this is a bit of a\ngrey area.  Also note that, while inlining multiple requests is clearly\nhandled, there&#39;s no mechanism for allowing proxies to request upstream\nproxies to generate invalidations based on their own receipt of\nnotifications, i.e. not clear whether / how to handle notification fan-out.\nThese are all valid areas for further discussion.\n\n(3) It should be possible to force the request through the proxy from the\nsubscriber end of things through the use of other proxy directive headers in\ncombination...  right?\n\nIt does make me a bit uneasy, but I&#39;m not sure why or how to weight the pros\nand cons.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n\nPaul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it is appropriate for us to have GET have the side-effect\n&gt; of registering a notification. What if a cache intercepts the method?\n&gt; What if a server just doesn&#39;t understand the header at all? It won&#39;t\n&gt; announce that.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
