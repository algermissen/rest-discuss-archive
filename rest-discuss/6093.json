Suppose my HTTP server is a robot, and I want to tell it \n&gt; to ring the doorbell.  What verb would apply?  What&#39;s the resource - the \n&gt; robot?  It&#39;s arm?  Or the doorbell?  \n\nI am working on a system with something similar. Precisely, you can ask \nthe server to initiate a communication with external sensors, and, say, \ndownload and store the sensor state.\n\nThat would be a typical RPC call: download-sensor-state(sensor-id)\n\nOnce downloaded, you can access the latest (or prior) sensor state using \na RESTful HTTP-GET. Use of other verbs on a sensor state resource, when \nallowed, would have the corresponding effect. For example, PUT is \nusually allowed for data that has missing parts, or corrupted data that \nmust be fudged after the download.\n\nBut I ended threating the &quot;download-sensor-state&quot; as a resource as well, \nand manipulate it in a RESTful manner (or at least, I think it is RESTful):\n\n  POST sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId\n\nThis creates a request to download the state of a sensor. The request is \na resource. The URI of this new resource may be\n\n  sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId/requestId\n\nThe following verbs on these may be supported:\n\n  GET returns the request status: in progress, cancelled, completed, \nresult code\n\n  PUT may be used to modify the executing request: change the status to \ncancel.\n\n  DELETE would delete old requests not required anymore.\n\nI am not sure if this is &quot;tir� par les cheveux&quot; (hum... &quot;pulled by the \nhair&quot;, a common expression in French Canadian ;), i.e. I do not know if \nthis is extending REST / HTTP in an area that it should not belong to. \nBut it makes issuing download requests very easy for the client...\n\n--\nClaude\n\nSuppose I want to tell it to wait\n&gt; until the toast pops up, then put it on a plate.  What&#39;s the verb for \n&gt; that?  All these sorts of things are easy to cover with RPC, or OO-type \n&gt; predicates, where you can make up verbs at will.  Is REST just not \n&gt; suited to these sorts of situations?\n&gt; \n\n"}}
