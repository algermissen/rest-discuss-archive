Fielding&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Please look up indirect in a dictionary.  That is what I mean.\n&gt; I hate ontology questions from SW land -- they are a total\n&gt; waste of time.\n\nI completely agree. I tried to keep the &#39;meaning&#39; stuff out of this\ndiscussion as much as I could - sorry if that wasn&#39;t clear.\n\nI am asking all these question for pure practical reasons (see below).\n\nWhat I did not understand was that on the one hand REST says that the\nnaming authority decides what the resource is that a given URI identifies\nand that on the other hand people on this list said that the user of\na URI (the link maker) decides what resource it identifies.\n\nThen I understood you to say that\n\n- a URI (directly) identifies the one resource that the naming authority\n  decides it to identify.\n\n- a URI (may) **indirectly** identify other resources depending on the\n  intention of the URI-user (the link-maker)\n\n\nI haven&#39;t seen the idea of URIs indirectly identifying resources used in\nthe context of REST before, that&#39;s why I asked what you (or REST) mean by\nit.\n\n\nThe practical problem I have is this:\n\nThe moment a user agent sends a request to the origin server, any &#39;indirection\ninformation&#39; is lost due to REST&#39;s unique addressing context. Certainly,\nthe origin server &#39;knows&#39; what resource the URI (directly) identifies because\nthat is controlled by the naming authority. But all intermediaries have no way\nof seeing/accessing any information about indirection in identification.\n\nI read about the idea (thanks Mark!) that intermediaries can provide\ninformation about the resources that the URIs identify they see in requests\n&#39;running through&#39; them and weave that information into the representation\nreturned to the user agent. It was then that I understood the advantages of\na unique addressing context, because the intermediary knows that a given\nURI unambiguously identifies a single resource.\n\nGiven the idea of &#39;indirect identification&#39; the question arises, how\nintermediaries can usefully enhance representations with information they\nobtained, for example, from an RDF document.\n\nI like the collaboration idea, which seems to come down to the possibility\nthat many *indirect* identifications can affect/alter a naming authority&#39;s\ndecision about the *direct* identification. Wonder how intermediaries can\ncontribute to this process.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
