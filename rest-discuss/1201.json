It should be killed.\n&gt; \n&gt; You mean that RDF should not be XML-expressible at all? Use\n&gt; s-expressions? Or do you mean you dislike all of the weird\n&gt; minimizations?\n\nI dislike that the triple structure of the RDF model is being\nshoehorned into a tree based syntax.  It&#39;s unnatural, and it\nshows.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard talk of adorning schemas with the information necessary to\n&gt; &gt; construct RDF.  I like this in theory, though I fear for the practical\n&gt; &gt; implications; primarily, additional network round-trips.\n&gt; \n&gt; The relationship between documents and schemas will typically be many to\n&gt; one so you can do a lot of caching of schemas. Sophisticated RDF use is\n&gt; already dependent on schemas (RDF schemas) to get subclassing and\n&gt; inferencing information, isn&#39;t it?\n\nYes, but RDF Schema is so general that it will likely be a built-in\nfor all processors.  The same can&#39;t be said of vCard-in-XML, or\nDocbook, etc..\n\nThat&#39;s the issue, I believe.  Schemas can indeed be cached, but that\nyou&#39;d need to get them in the first place is what hurts.\n\n&gt; &gt; For now, that&#39;s clearly true.  As more RDF features are integrated into\n&gt; &gt; tools, the cost of doing this will come down.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see it as a tools cost but as a readability cost. Sprinkling all\n&gt; of that RDF junk through my document is, imo, as unacceptable as\n&gt; sprinkling SOAP voodoo into my messages. I guess it boils down to: I\n&gt; think you optimize the XML for readability and processability *as XML*\n&gt; and then figure out how to get the benefits of protocols and metadata\n&gt; engines etc. You think that RDF is primary and that XML is just a\n&gt; container for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But if that&#39;s true then RDF should use an optimized-for-RDF syntax, not\n&gt; XML at all.\n\nMostly, yes.  Sometimes you need the additional value that XML adds;\nUnicode, xml:lang, xml:space, xml:base, etc..\n\nFrom a purely REST POV, I want to use content negotiation to retrieve\nRDF (N3, but XML if that&#39;s required) representations of resources.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
