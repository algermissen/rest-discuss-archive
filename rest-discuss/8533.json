What is named  \n&#39;Server&#39; there looks more like\na user agent to me. As in\n\n$ua = new LWP::UserAgent();\n$res = $ua-&gt;get( $uri );\n\nor any client side library (e.g. an APP/Atom specific one).\n\nThe coupling you talk about seems to me to be the coupling between  \nthe code that uses the library and the media type the library is  \nimplemented for.\n\nDoes that help in any way?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; but\n&gt; I suspect that letting developers pretend that servers are in the same\n&gt; address space as the client code results in problems; for example, the\n&gt; Server class can be supplied by the server owner leading to tight API\n&gt; coupling, despite documents travelling over HTTP . That said, I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure what the sensible alternatives are, but I think the problems are\n&gt; independent of how you design your web application, ie, cool URLs  \n&gt; won&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily help.\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
