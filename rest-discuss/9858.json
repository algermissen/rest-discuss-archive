There&#39;s only one instance where\n&gt; cookies seem to be necessary, that is for shoppers who come to the\n&gt; website and haven&#39;t identified themselves. So you give them a cookie and\n&gt; you track what they&#39;re doing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some suggested solutions:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Client should cache this:\n&gt;    - It might be too much you want to cache at the client\n&gt;    - We don&#39;t have such a tool yet, perhaps Google Gears in the future?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. URL rewriting: works, but somewhat annoying to make it work, either\n&gt;    you need to rewrite most if not all the urls in your output, or you\n&gt;    use relative urls and have a prefix which is a uuid or so, so you can\n&gt;    track unique visitors.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But there might be another solution, if JavaScript is enabled:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Create a unique id on the client (or the server can hand out one).\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Use this unique id with XmlHttpRequest as the user name in\n&gt;    authenticating the user. Empty password would suffice.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. The server should handle those kinds of logins by creating a new\n&gt;    account with that id.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. If you login to the domain, i.e. &quot;/&quot;, every request will contain the\n&gt;    authentication header. You could actually authenticate the requests\n&gt;    or not, that doesn&#39;t matter. The browser sends the username anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you do this, you can track a not yet logged in user perfectly\n&gt; fine. No url rewriting needed. No cookies needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Drawbacks: need JavaScript.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Let me know your thoughts,\n&gt;\n&gt; Berend de Boer\n&gt;\n\n"}}
