I guess I am not understanding \n&gt; what the problem is. I&#39;ve utilized REST as a sort of MVC for my web site \n&gt; as well. I look at it this way, the REST API that is available beyond the \n&gt; web to anyone who wants to consume it, ALSO allows me to build my own web \n&gt; UI around it. I do this in one of two ways. One is to have a separate \n&gt; &quot;view&quot; tier web front end. I do this with a simple struts/mvc style web \n&gt; app with JSPs for the view of the web site. When a user clicks on a link \n&gt; that is handled by an action, in that action code I make the REST call to \n&gt; the API, and do all the work inside of the action as needed. The other way \n&gt; I might do it, is to deploy the API within my own UI web app archive. When \n&gt; I do this, I utilize prototype to make ajax calls directly to the REST \n&gt; api, specifying headers, method type, etc as needed. It really depends on \n&gt; which way you want to deploy your API and your front end UI.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a little confused on why end users must have some \n&gt; www.mysite.com/peter as their URL? That seems to me that you&#39;re passing \n&gt; the REST API uris up to the end user of your UI. I don&#39;t quite understand \n&gt; why that is needed or wanted. I don&#39;t imagine anyone else using your API \n&gt; from anothter site, or say desktop or mobile client, would somehow use \n&gt; your API URIs within their UI representation of your API. Is there some \n&gt; reason you must incorporate the REST URIs into the front end UI your users \n&gt; would use?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
