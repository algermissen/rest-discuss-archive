There isn&#39;t a way in RDF to say t=\r\nwo resources \n&gt; denote the same\n&gt; thing (DAML maybe). It&#39;s been a while sin=\r\nce I looked at the Model\n&gt; Theory, so I could be wrong there... What you co=\r\nuld do with \n&gt; it is merge\n&gt; graphs and from there determine if two URIs ar=\r\ne likely as not pointing\n&gt; at the same thing, possibly by swapping one URI =\r\nfor another in a graph\n&gt; and seeing if the entailments remain the same or j=\r\nust counting up how\n&gt; many property values the things have in common. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; this troubles me.  sometimes i struggle to see how the \n&gt; &gt; semantic web=\r\n can work without it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think of how tricky the semantics of object equa=\r\nlity can get in Java.\n&gt; I&#39;d be disinclined to bake in resource equality at =\r\nthe RDF level.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill de h=D3ra \n&gt; --\n&gt; Propylon\n&gt; www.propylon.com \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
