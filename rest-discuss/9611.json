(Is there any light visible in the tunnel on that?) I&#39;ve  \n&gt; been\n&gt; looking at work-arounds.\n\nThis seems to come up quite often.  I fail to understand what\npeople are complaining about.  Javascript running within a browser\ncontext is inherently untrusted.  Untrusted scripts should not be\nallowed to perform unsafe actions without user intervention, period.\nThe only reason POST is allowed (and only to the host where the\nscript came from, hopefully) is because there is no other method\nfor sending payload-driven safe queries.\n\nIt&#39;s like the farm kids I met once in Germany, who thought they\ncould trick us suburban visitors into pissing on an electric fence.\nI don&#39;t know what they were trying to say to convince us it would\nbe okay (not having much grasp of the language at age 12), but it\nsure didn&#39;t take much imagination to figure out the right answer.\n\nInstead of railing against the browser developers for their common\nsense restriction, we should be designing a framework under which\na browser can know which methods are allowed silently, which methods\nare allowed with user confirmation, and which methods are not allowed\nat all.  Then the framework can be defined with configurable defaults\nfor browser context versus extension context, and with the ability\nto override those defaults under certain conditions.  If someone\ntakes the time to do all that, just as other people previously took\nthe time to define security contexts for applets and related things,\nthen I am sure the browser vendors will be happy to standardize\non one security framework for XHR.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
