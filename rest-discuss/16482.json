It is XML, which is standard, but it is also a certain=\r\n\n&gt; schema which is ... well what is it?\n&gt; \n\nWell, first, application/vnd.ab=\r\nc+xml isn&#39;t a media type, it&#39;s a media\ntype *identifier*.  XBEL is a standa=\r\nrd media type, but XBEL has no\nregistered identifier, so serving XBEL isn&#39;t=\r\n self-descriptive.\n\nI don&#39;t have enough context to answer your question.  I=\r\ns this type\nbeing used on an intranet, where the IANA registry is irrelevan=\r\nt, and\nit&#39;s agreed to by all parties to the transaction?  Then there&#39;s no R=\r\nEST\nmismatch.  You can serve XBEL self-descriptively on an intranet, by\nass=\r\nigning it an identifier that everyone on that intranet agrees to.\n\nIf the c=\r\nontext is HTTP over the Internet, where only the IANA registry\nis defined, =\r\napplication/vnd.abc+xml can&#39;t be considered self-descriptive\nbecause it doe=\r\nsn&#39;t point to anything, since no registry entry exists.\n\nRFC 3023 says host=\r\ns MAY decide to fall back to application/xml as a\nprocessing model, but you=\r\n can&#39;t bank on this behavior, and the whole\npoint of self-descriptiveness i=\r\ns that the origin server is specifying\nthe processing model with no such am=\r\nbiguity in the first place.\n\nUnless and until application/vnd.abc+xml has a=\r\nn entry in IANA which\npoints to a spec, it will not be self-descriptive usi=\r\nng HTTP over the\nInternet, any more than my using application/xbel+xml (not=\r\n registered)\nover the Web is self-descriptive (it isn&#39;t).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
