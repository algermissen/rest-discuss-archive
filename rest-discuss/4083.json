MONITOR simply means: &quot;POST a notification to the Reply-To URL\nif the state changes&quot;. I think of this notification as being a representation\nof the new state.\n\n&gt; How would\n&gt; you describe the state transition (or transfer) that occurs in response\n&gt; to a MONITOR request?  \n\nThis is beyond my REST-knowledge I think. Is it necessary that this is\ndoable? All I am sure of is that the response to MONITOR will be\na &quot;201 Created&quot; with a Location header identifying the monitor.\n\n\nMaybe I don&#39;t understand.\n\nHmm...all I want is to experiment and contribute some code that is\neasy to deploy. So far I can see some very interesting consequences of\na MONITOR method, among them the possibility to turn servers into feeds\nand direct them all to a single &#39;consumer&#39;-resource that can do all kinds\nof interesting combinations.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; : In the risk of asking something I should actually now, what does\n&gt; : &quot;incremental development&quot; mean in the REST context?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nothing special for REST, just the idea of enhancing the\n&gt; system in functional increments.  But as I think about it more,\n&gt; maybe me concern is really in the area of backward compatibility\n&gt; with already implemented resources.\n\nBut isn&#39;t a simple 405 (501?) enough to tell a client that\nMONITOR isn&#39;t implemented? This works fine with PUT and DELETE\nand the other HTTP/1.1 methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really need an aswer to my question above, or I don&#39;t know\n&gt; what I&#39;m talking about.\n\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
