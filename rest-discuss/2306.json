Is submitting a &quot;transfer order&quot; an RPC \n&gt; (because the\n&gt; meaning is embedded in the message)? Well let&#39;s just say we \n&gt; can move it\n&gt; pretty far to the REST side of the spectrum if we:\n&gt; \n&gt;  * make the order addressable so that it can be referred to by anyone,\n&gt; anytime\n&gt;  * describe the transfer order in an XML or RDF schema, in as \n&gt; rich a way\n&gt; as possible\n&gt;  * make the URI for &quot;submit transfer order for this account&quot; \n&gt; a hyperlink\n&gt; from the account object\n&gt;  * separate the URI for &quot;submit transfer order&quot; from the URIs for &quot;pay\n&gt; bills from this account&quot; and &quot;get information about this account&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;withdraw money from this account&quot;\n&gt;  * if transfer orders can be removed, updated or read, use \n&gt; standard HTTP\n&gt; methods to do so\n&gt;  * make a GET on the URI for &quot;submit transfer order&quot; return something\n&gt; that lists the current orders and perhaps describes what will happen\n&gt; when new orders are submitted (prose or machine readable?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully these will help someone.\n\nOne of the (beneficial?) side effects of approaching a Control Frame\nproblem from the perspective of an Information Frame is that the\ncontrol process inherits the property of self-annotation.  I think of it\nthis way.  If you use Quicken to record your bank transactions after\nthey&#39;ve gone through, you are just building an information system.  If you\nuse Quicken to record your bank transactions *before* they go through\ninstead of after, you&#39;re still dealing with the same information, but\nyou&#39;re using it both to effect the work and to record it.  An augmented\ninformation system serves as a control system.  The examples that look\nthe most unabashedly like RPC are the ones in which we don&#39;t care if\nrecords are kept of the actions or not.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
