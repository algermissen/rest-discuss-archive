The URI structure should clearly identify resources\nb. Clients should be able to traverse from one resource to another. By  \ntraversing, I don&#39;t mean hyper-linking. For instance, if a user Bob  \nhas books and cds, it  is easy to identify Bob&#39;s books (/bob/books)  \nfrom Joe&#39;s books (/joe/books) as via URIs that uniquely identify those  \nresources.\n\nCall it esthetics, but a clean URI structure can compensate for long  \nparagraphs describing the resource structure.\n\n&gt; My website users can add books or movies to their lists, with some\n&gt; predefined status (e.g. &quot;have read&quot;, &quot;wish to watch&quot;, etc.) and\n&gt; comments.  How can I let web service users to get information like\n&gt; &quot;get all the books Bob wish to read, with his comments&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the resources in this case are not books, because comments are\n&gt; not attributes of books.  They are attributes of the &quot;relationship of\n&gt; Bob and the book&quot;.  Let me call the relationship &quot;collection&quot;.  So I\n\nIf I understand the use case correctly, one goal is to represent a  \nuser&#39;s comments on a given book. Right? If so, how about the following:\n\n/books/{book}/comments/{user}\n\nA request to this URI could very well point the client to a comment / \ncomments/{comment} (via the Content-Location header).\n\nto identify the comments on a {book} made by a given {user}.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n/users/{user}/{status}/comments/{book}\n\nto point the client to the same comment /comments/{comment}.\n\n\n&gt; designed the following URLs and lost:\n&gt;\n&gt; /users/Bob/collections?cat=book&status=wish\n\n/users/{user}/books/{status} -&gt; to return a collection of books\n/users/{user}/books/{status}/books/{book} -&gt; to point the client to a  \nbook /books/{book}\n\n&gt; /users/Bob/collections/book/wish\n\n\n&gt; /users/Bob/collections/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; /collections/user/Bob/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; /collections?user=Bob&cat=book&status=wish\n&gt;\n&gt; Which one do you consider the most &quot;RESTful&quot;?  I am completely lost.\n&gt; And I can not even judge to use &quot;users&quot; or &quot;user&quot; in the URLs.  Anyone\n&gt; give me a hint?  Thanks!\n\nBoth are.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
