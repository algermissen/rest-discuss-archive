You are merely \n&gt; transferring the state of objects.  Leave it up to the handler of the \n&gt; resource to do something smart with it.  It&#39;s only the client&#39;s job to \n&gt; manipulate that object&#39;s state and PUT it back.\n\nI don&#39;t think calling methods and transferring state are necessarily\nmutually exclusive.  Calling a method is a perfectly fine way to transfer\nstate.  If we define a URI for turning the lamp on, the &quot;on&quot; method\ntransfers to the client the state of success-on or failure-off.  It is\nreally no different than POSTing &quot;on&quot; to the lamp&#39;s &quot;on-or-off&quot; property.\n\nI certainly agree that transferring state is a must for REST and have URIs\nfor all important noun resources is a very good thing.  However, to the\nextent that loose coupling is respected, having verb URIs (*not* RPC) to\nrepresent important actions that are stable and meaningful can also be\nuseful as long as the state modeling and transfer is maintained.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
