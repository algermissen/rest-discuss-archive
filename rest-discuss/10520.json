Or did I\n&gt; &gt; misunderstand you?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, half-and-half: there&#39;s no reason not to use the Allow\n&gt; header, as far as I know, and Vary: Authentication to indicate that a\n&gt; different user may be allowed to use different methods. For your\n&gt; &quot;self-documenting&quot; idea, couldn&#39;t scripting could be used to read the\n&gt; Allow and Vary headers?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nYes, of course - although this would only make it available to  \nscripts, not to the casual browser user. So one would probably end up  \ndoing both.\n\n&gt; For what I suggested could go in an Accept response header, current\n&gt; practice is to use hypermedia, you have Atom Protocol on your side as\n&gt; well. So we do agree there, I&#39;m just wondering why Accept can&#39;t be a\n&gt; response header in 2616bis, nothing to do with your article. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nGood question :-)\n\n\n&gt; Still, why no luv for OPTIONS? I ask because I&#39;m currently considering\n&gt; some novel uses for OPTIONS, like say, to return an XForms interface\n&gt; [1], which in the example allows me to POST a new entry to my weblog  \n&gt; if\n&gt; you use your imagination. Works best with X-smiles, imagine an\n&gt; &#39;options&#39; button on the address bar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s no particular reason I didn&#39;t include, except for a lack of  \nfirst-hand experience in using it.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n"}}
