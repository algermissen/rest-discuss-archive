Look at these\n&gt; two URIs:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.googl=\r\ne.com/search?q=3DREST\n&gt;    http://www.google.com/search?q=3DThis+is+spinal+=\r\ntap\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think you&#39;d consider google.com one big resource.\n\ngoogle.c=\r\nom is the naming authority and /search is the resource. You\ndon&#39;t have to t=\r\nhink of /search as one big resource that contains these\nsmall resources spe=\r\ncified via a Query String. You can think of it as a\nresource that gives you=\r\n some way of getting to other resources by\nproviding &quot;identifying informati=\r\non&quot; [1] in the Query String.\n\nNote that both the URI&#39;s (including the query=\r\n mark and the query\nstring after it) you mentioned *are used to identify* q=\r\nuasi-static [2]\nresources which can be cached till the next time google upd=\r\nates its\nindex.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think trying to squeeze all request headers\n&gt; u=\r\nnder the label of &quot;parametrising the request&quot;\n&gt; is really correct (think of=\r\n  Cache-Control:\n&gt; and Connection:). There *are* request headers, such as A=\r\nccept:,\n&gt; but I wouldn&#39;t refer to them\n&gt; as &quot;parametrising the request&quot; as =\r\nmuch as\n&gt; &quot;parametrising the respresentation&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m not giving it that labe=\r\nl, the spec is:\n&quot;These (request-header) fields act as request modifiers,&quot; [=\r\n3]\n\nAccording to the spec [4]:\n&quot;Accept headers can be used to indicate that=\r\n the *request is\nspecifically limited* to a small set of desired types, as =\r\nin the case\nof a request for an in-line image.&quot;\n\nSo the Accept header *is* =\r\na request modifier.\n\nAlso, Cache-Control [5] and Connection [6] are both ge=\r\nneral-header\nfields and not request-header fields.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; If this is the cas=\r\ne then you cannot put information in\n&gt; &gt; the Query String that belongs in t=\r\nhe Request Header because the Query\n&gt; &gt; String in some sense affects the id=\r\nentity of the resource but the\n&gt; &gt; Request Headers don&#39;t (this is true if l=\r\nike me you believe that the\n&gt; &gt; different formats are not separate resource=\r\ns).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you do have a resource that does some form\n&gt; of content negotiat=\r\nion, which is what we&#39;re talking\n&gt; about here, it is still useful to have U=\r\nRIs for\n&gt; particular representations:\n\n\nI agree but only in the case of rea=\r\nctive (agent-driven) negotiation [7].\n\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shett=\r\ny.in/\n\n\n[1] http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html#query\n[2] ht=\r\ntp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#Query\n[3] http://www.w3.org/Protoc=\r\nols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.3\n[4] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc261=\r\n6/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1\n[5] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc261=\r\n6-sec14.html#sec14.9\n[6] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.=\r\nhtml#sec14.10\n[7] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evalua=\r\ntion.htm#sec_6_3_2_7\n\n"}}
