What kind of data size do you expect to\n&gt; &gt; encounter?\n&gt;\n&gt; This was actually a hypothetical example (you might think of a digital\nlibrary\n&gt; that would also offer things like &#39;view a list of all authors and their\npublications&#39;).\n&gt; I am thinking at a very large scale where &#39;chunking&#39; would definitely be a\nneccessity.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  What kind of clients do you wish to interact with?\n&gt;\n&gt; Browsers (in which case I would return HTML) but also non-human clients\nlike\n&gt; other services for example.\n\nPersonally, I strongly believe that the resource models you end up with are\ndifferent for the &#39;visual web&#39; and the &#39;automatable web&#39;. It is easier to do\nstrong information architecture on the &#39;automatable web&#39; approach -\nhyperlinking .vs. client-aware query terms, chunking, etc. The &#39;visual web&#39;\nis a whole different ball game & existing browsers have lots of limitations\n(no PUT, no DELETE, etc. unless you do scripting with client components like\nMS&#39;s XMLHttpRequest).\nI think that you probably could have a REST/HTTP layer for pure information\naccess and a UI/HTTP layer for browser and user experience concerns. Limited\ndeployments probably would optimize away the REST information layer and go\nwith straight SQL access - probably faster & more skill/tool support, but\nnot as scalable/shareable. Just my opinions though.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
