These are RDF vocabularies that define constraints on\n&gt; &gt; resources and their relationships, rather than doing it on syntax.\n&gt;\n&gt; As was pointed out to me on www-ws-desc@..., those two aren&#39;t\n&gt; really comparable.  I have never used DTDs/XML Schemas (all my XML\n&gt; has been RDF for 2+ years), and just failed to recognize that an\n&gt; XML Schema constrains the relationship between elements in a document\n&gt; scope, not a global scope.\n&gt;\n&gt; In RDF/OWL, there&#39;s no way to say &quot;in this document, Person has to\n&gt; have an Age&quot;; there&#39;s only a way to say &quot;People have one age&quot;, which\n&gt; says nothing about what any particular document might say.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, what you find when you switch to RDF is that you don&#39;t\n&gt; need to say &quot;in this document ...&quot;.
