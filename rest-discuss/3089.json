So the GET gets fanned out to every party that I have any \nassets\n&gt; with, and then responses then fan-in back.  The parties there would \nbe\n&gt; me, the parties holding my assets, plus an intermediary party who \ncan\n&gt; aggregate that information (optionally - it could just be software \nunder\n&gt; my control, or software that one of the other parties uses).\n\nWhere in that scenario do multiple parties actually interact?\nI read:\n* you interact with intermediary\n* intermediary interacts with each asset-holder individually\n* none of the asset-holders needs to even know about the others\n* intermediary coordinates (sums) results\nWhat am I missing?\n\n&gt; That&#39;s a bit of a weak fan-in example, since it&#39;s plain-vanilla\n&gt; responses to a GET request (at least after the intermediary).  But \nyou\n&gt; could imagine responses being disconnected (via explicit correlation\n&gt; rather than implicit correlation via the connection) from requests.\n\nHow would this change the situation so that more than two parties \nwould need to interact at a time?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
