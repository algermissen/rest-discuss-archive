Compare:\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThe key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any\ninformation that can be named can be a resource: a document or image,\na temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a\ncollection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person),\nand so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an\nauthor&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a\nresource. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not\nthe entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in\ntime.\n&quot;&quot;&quot; [1]\n\nwith\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nIt is important to understand that using URIs, it is possible to\nidentify both a thing (which may exist outside of the Web) and a Web\ndocument describing the thing. For example the person Alice is\ndescribed on her homepage. Bob may not like the look of the homepage,\nbut fancy the person Alice. So two URIs are needed, one for Alice, one\nfor the homepage or a RDF document describing Alice. The question is\nwhere to draw the line between the case where either is possible and\nthe case where only descriptions are available.\n&quot;&quot;&quot; [2]\n\nI guess the closing of httpRange-14 by the TAG was a resolution to\nthis difference [3]. But I still find the REST style, where URIs\nunambiguously identify Resources and not Representations fits my brain\nbetter. W3C&#39;s Cool URIs for the Semantic Web splits the world of\nresources into Documents [4] and Real World Objects [5]. This sounds\nok-ish in theory, but it really hasn&#39;t worked out all that well in the\npractice of web publishing [6].\n\nThe key problem for me is that when semweb folks talk about\n&quot;documents&quot; I can&#39;t help but hear &quot;representations&quot;. For example, when\nI&#39;m publishing something on the web with a web framework like\nRubyOnRails or whatever, I have a model of something, say a User, and\na URL route like /user/:id, and some controller code that goes and\nfetches that model instance and delivers up some HTML for the user\nusing a template. Every time I do something like this it just isn&#39;t\nfeasible for me to think, hmmm is this URL identifying a real world\nobject? Is the database record for the User an Information Resource?\nOr is my database record about a Real World Thing or a Document?\nShould I really have two URL paths here, one for the Document about\nthe User and one for the User themself? Should I use a # in that URI,\nor use the 303 redirect to indicate it is the Real World Object?\n\nYAGNI\n\nI&#39;ve found it easier to look at the World Wide Web through REST\ncolored glasses where my URLs identify Resources, and my Server\ndelivers up Representations of them. And yet, RDF remains a nice data\nmodel (with a few decent Representations) for describing web graphs,\nand it has rdf:type for explicitly documenting the nature of the\nResource.\n\n//Ed\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#distinguishing\n[3] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI2\n[4] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#oldweb\n[5] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#id-resources\n[6] http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#semweb\n\n"}}
