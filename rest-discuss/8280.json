This contains the inp=\r\nut\nparameters of the test, the type of test ect. A test can be executed,\nan=\r\nd after the test has finished you get a test report.\n\nI think of the follow=\r\ning REST model:\n\nResources: TestRecipe / TestReport\n\nTo put a test recipe:\n=\r\nPUT http://Roger/Tests/TestRecipe \nwith &lt;testrecipe&gt; as XML document. The U=\r\nRI of the test recipe is returned.\nWith GET http://Roger/Tests/TestRecipe y=\r\nou will get all available test\nrecipes.\n\nThe problem i have is to run a tes=\r\nt recipe. A test recipe can be\nstarted multiple times.\nPOST http://Roger/Te=\r\nsts/TestRecipe/TestRecipe12?cmd=3Drun\nThis will start a test run and the UR=\r\nI of the TestReport is returned.\n\nWithin the TestReport the URI of the corr=\r\nesponding TestRecipe is put.\nThe test results can be viewed by:\nGET http://=\r\nRoger/Tests/TestReport/TestReport12\nHowever should this last resource be cr=\r\neated right after creating the\nrun of the test recipe? The test report is a=\r\nvailable only after the\ntest is ready!\n\nLove to hear your comments!\n\nRoger =\r\nvd Kimmenade\n\n\n\n\n"}}
