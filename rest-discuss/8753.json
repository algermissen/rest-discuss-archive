HTTP, content-types, etc. Basically:  \n&gt; REST.  IMHO,\n&gt; anyway. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Interoperability on desktop apps is not great just as SOAP webservice\n&gt; interoperability is not great.  Using REST principles applied  \n&gt; judiciously to\n&gt; the desktop could bring the same interoperability we see on the web  \n&gt; to the\n&gt; desktop.  Secondly, I&#39;m always, always, always pining for some way  \n&gt; to go\n&gt; back to a particular (course grained) point in an application.   \n&gt; Having that\n&gt; point available in an LRL (Local Resource Locator) would be  \n&gt; wonderful, just\n&gt; like having a path I can copy and paste from Windows Explorer to  \n&gt; file open\n&gt; dialogs is wonderful.  Thirdly it could unify the desktop and the  \n&gt; web and\n&gt; eliminate the (in the future more and more) arbitrary distinction  \n&gt; between\n&gt; local and Internet.\n\nA primary issue here is one of loose vs. strong coupling. In a  \ndesktop scenario it is feasible and acceptable to have strong  \ncoupling, because you have a much narrower domain of artifacts and  \nmore control over how those artifacts can behave. In a network  \nenvironment you have heterogeneous systems with different  \narchitectures and approaches, so loose coupling is much more likely  \nto succeed.\n\nPeople have used distributed technologies to build desktop  \napplications in the past. For example, there&#39;s the CORBA  \ninfrastructure in GNOME, the now defunct Berlin project, and the  \nvarious bus- and queue-based inter-application messaging frameworks  \nin BSD, Solaris, etc. Those technologies, however, are still used in  \na very fine-grained, strongly coupled manner.\n\nI do agree with you that there are lessons to be learned from the  \ninteroperability measures and standardisation that has developed in  \nthe web space. If all filesystems were able to store MIME content- \ntype and other metadata, it would simplify building cross-platform  \napplications. I&#39;m less sure about your concept of bookmarks for  \nentire application state identified by &quot;LRLs&quot; or the general  \napplicability of REST principles to desktop applications.\n\n"}}
