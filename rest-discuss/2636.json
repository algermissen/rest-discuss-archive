The functions\n&gt; f, g and h are\n&gt; &gt; all idempotent: they satisfy the constraint\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     fun(fun(x)) = fun(x) for all x mapped by fun (plug f, g and h in for\n&gt; &#39;fun&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; When you have nested functions - what does that mean? Is it the return\ndata\n&gt; of one function is the input to another function, or is it the function\n&gt; applied to the total state of the system after applying the function to\nthe\n&gt; total state of the system (where its initial conditions are identified by\n&gt; &#39;x&#39;)?\n\nYou have to make that interpretation yourself.  Idempotent is a mathematical\nproperty of homogeneous binary relations.  You decide what&#39;s related to what\nwhen you do HTTP message exchange.  Defined as way above.\n\nMy answer is that you are relating pre-state to post-state of the resource,\nalso\nbadly known as the &quot;side-effect&quot; thing.  The response code is not the same\ntype\nas the resource state, so there&#39;s no homogeneity available there.\n\nWalden (truly so low on battery I must now shut down)\n\n\n"}}
