It focuses almost entirely on machine to\n&gt; machine interaction within the context of IT assets of a single enterprise.\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t deal much with browsers or mashups and it even spends a\n&gt; significant amount of time addressing issues like transactions and pub/sub.\n&gt; Perhaps for some the very fact that Thomas Erl&#39;s name is on the cover well\n&gt; push some buttons :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Nevertheless we collectively and I in particular have worked hard not to\n&gt; compromise on REST principles and constraints while still making the\n&gt; content accessible to SOA people and the general population. Within this\n&gt; context of heavy machine to machine interaction we deal with defining a\n&gt; uniform interface to cover an inventory of services within a particular\n&gt; enterprise, and how that should relate to service contracts and to broader\n&gt; standardisation efforts. We look to move past SOA&#39;s traditional limit of\n&gt; increasing intrinsic interoperability only within a given inventory and\n&gt; instead look for standard methods and media types to increase\n&gt; interoperability to more massive scales.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have sought to keep hypermedia core to the practice of building\n&gt; inventories of services and their related customers and to minimise\n&gt; coupling while also being explicit about why we do this. We have sought to\n&gt; drive a hard line on the stateless constraint and what that means to the\n&gt; aforementioned patterns of transactions (promoting compensating over\n&gt; atomic) and pub/sub (promoting cached polling and delta encoding).\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of you have already seen the material in various stages of completion\n&gt; as have many SOA guys. Over the last six months or so the manuscript\n&gt; changed significantly as we worked that feedback into the finished product.\n&gt;\n&gt; No book is perfect, but I hope this one will end up bringing the REST and\n&gt; SOA worlds together in a closer understanding without compromising one iota\n&gt; of what is important to each. I&#39;m confident that despite the unfamiliar\n&gt; wording, context and audience that the book is written to be applied to\n&gt; that at its heart is a true application of REST constraints and to every\n&gt; possible extent a true application of the years of experience the REST\n&gt; community has developed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The book is available in ebook and hard cover:\n&gt; Amazon - http://amzn.com/0137012519\n&gt; Barnes and Noble -\n&gt; http://search.barnesandnoble.com/SOA-with-REST/Thomas-Erl/e/9780137012510(seriously?
