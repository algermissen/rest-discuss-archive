I can&#39;t \nsay &quot;Seth is striking an ogre&quot; because that is up to the DM (or, the \nserver&#39;s logic) to determine the outcome of &quot;Seth is attacking an ogre&quot;. \n  In fact, in rollplaying, this is pretty much what would happen.\n\nAnyway, the state I am in is Attacking.  If the URI \nhttp://example.org/world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99 points to Seth \n(The Mighty), then I might PUT myself there, therefor updating my state:\n\nPUT /world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99 HTTP/1.0\nContent-Type: application/rpg-character+xml\n\n&lt;character&gt;\n    &lt;!-- what is Seth doing now?  could be walking, talking, etc --&gt;\n    &lt;performing&gt;\n       &lt;attack using=&quot;sword&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;against xlink:href=&quot;http://world-o-hacks/region27/ogre/33553&quot;\n                   xmlns:xlink=&quot;whatever-it-is&quot; /&gt;\n       &lt;/attack&gt;\n    &lt;/performing&gt;\n&lt;/character\n\nWhat&#39;s nice about that is the server can send back a representation of \nboth my character AND the ogre.  I would look into the representation of \nthe ogre to see if damage had been done, if it is fleeing, etc.\n\nIt&#39;s all about state transfer.  Kinda cool.\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
