People are just starting to unders=\r\ntand\nREST, how could someone choose atompub when he doesn&#39;t understand\nREST=\r\n?\n\nI&#39;m starting to work on a side project that make uses of APP. I also\nnot=\r\niced that it wasn&#39;t trendy. But when I realize\nthe reasons were that nobody=\r\n cares about interoperability and\nhypermedia driven application state,\nthen=\r\n my fear disappeared because I care. XML may be less trendy than\nJSON, that=\r\n was I used to think. But I found my trend: XQuery in the\nbackend and a nat=\r\nive XML database, storing my feeds as-is.\n\nI felt that working with APP cou=\r\nld be a good knowledge investment.\nThat was a decision that came from my he=\r\nart first. I recognized\nsomething strong in it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nOn Tue, May 29=\r\n, 2012 at 9:23 AM, Kristian Rink &lt;kawazu428@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Folks;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am at the moment into trying to choose a data format / representatio=\r\nn\n&gt; to use for building a RESTful web service which should allow for readin=\r\ng\n&gt; and writing resources, which should be accessible using &quot;standard&quot; tool=\r\ns\n&gt; as well as using a dedicated programming API and which should as much a=\r\ns\n&gt; somewhat possible rely upon existing open standards.\n&gt;\n&gt; After doing so=\r\nme reading, I came across Atom and APP as it seems in many\n&gt; possible ways =\r\nprovide sane and stable solutions for problems at hand\n&gt; (including things =\r\nlike &quot;workspaces&quot;, &quot;feeds&quot;, &quot;entries&quot;, dealing with\n&gt; service and category =\r\ndescriptions, dealing with textual and binary\n&gt; content, dealing with exten=\r\nsibility and stuff like OpenSearch and the\n&gt; like).\n&gt;\n&gt; In many ways, so fa=\r\nr it seems the perfect match, however it right now\n&gt; (at least for me) suff=\r\ners from a particular shortcoming: I am not really\n&gt; sure whether it&#39;s a te=\r\nchnology or a standard to &quot;last&quot;. Doing some\n&gt; reading on that, I rather qu=\r\nickly stumbled across articles pointing out\n&gt; that &quot;AtomPub has failed&quot; and=\r\n &quot;AtomPub is basically dead&quot;, suggesting\n&gt; that everyone else uses JSON bas=\r\ned REST services right now, eventually\n&gt; pointing out that even the Google =\r\nGData services are considered &quot;legacy&quot;\n&gt; and replaced by different approach=\r\nes right now. On the other hand I\n&gt; don&#39;t really see what could replace Ato=\r\nm or especially AtomPub talking\n&gt; about providing a given data structure, a=\r\n data and service semantics to\n&gt; allow for read/write interactions with a s=\r\nervice in a somewhat sane,\n&gt; standard way.\n&gt;\n&gt; So to ask: If you were about=\r\n to start a new RESTful project supposed to\n&gt; work with existing &quot;standard&quot;=\r\n tools, what kind of data representation\n&gt; would you choose? Would you stil=\r\nl go for Atom / AtomPub? Would you\n&gt; rather use some kind of JSON+HTTP? Som=\r\nething completely else?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any input,\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
