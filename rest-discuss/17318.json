However, the question is still: do we really \n&gt; need it? Since not even &quot;all components of the deployed Web obey\n&gt; every constraint present in&quot; the REST architectural design.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ll probably write a more detailed response over the weekend.  In\nshort, REST is an idealized model of distributed hypertext system\nbehavior.  Think of it like a dog-breeding standard.  Sure, a Malamute\nis a dog, but not if it has blue eyes...\n\nThe important bit, excerpted from Chapter 6, all-caps mine:\n\n&quot;\nThe name &#39;Representational State Transfer&#39; is intended to evoke an\nimage of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a network of web\npages (a virtual state-machine), where the user progresses through the\napplication by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in the\nnext page (representing the next state of the application) being\ntransferred to the user and rendered for their use.\n\nREST is not intended to capture all possible uses of the Web protocol\nstandards. There are applications of HTTP and URI that do not match the\napplication model of a distributed hypermedia system. The important\npoint, however, is that REST DOES CAPTURE _ALL_ OF THOSE ASPECTS OF A\nDISTRIBUTED HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM THAT ARE CONSIDERED CENTRAL to the\nbehavioral and performance requirements of the Web, such that\noptimizing behavior within the model will result in optimum behavior\nwithin the deployed Web architecture.\n&quot;\n\nREST is not a result, it&#39;s a tool, which is why nobody gets an answer\nwhen asked for a link to a RESTful service -- that&#39;s like asking for an\nexample of the perfectly-conforming Malamute.  All I can tell you about\nany individual Malamute, is where it meets or deviates from the various\npoints of breed.  Or whether it&#39;s so far off as to make it a Beagle,\nwhich is still HTTP... erm, uhhh... I mean, a dog.\n\nYou can hook any sort of dog to a sled, but if you want dogs with the\nproper size, weight, eye pigmentation, coat characteristics and so\nforth such that it can reliably perform the task over the long-term in\n40-below weather, then you&#39;ll need a dog that&#39;s been bred for those\nadvantages.  (Huskies are bred to slightly different dog-sledding needs,\nmaking a tradeoff on eye pigmentation acceptable.)\n\nYou can pull a dogsled with Huskies, you just can&#39;t call them Malamutes,\nis the equivalent of &quot;HTTP != REST&quot;.  No Malamute is representative of\nthat standard, it&#39;s just a guideline -- all Malamutes are merely\nimplementations of that standard.  Same thing here.  I often use Google\nas an example, describing what it gets right and wrong in terms of REST,\nbut I don&#39;t hold it up as an example *of* REST.\n\nBut, aren&#39;t Huskies just as good at pulling sleds as Malamutes?  Depends\non the application.  Malamutes aren&#39;t used by top Iditarod racers, but\nif you need to deliver vaccine to Nome, you&#39;ll want Balto...\n\nhttp://www.worldmals.com/history.htm\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
