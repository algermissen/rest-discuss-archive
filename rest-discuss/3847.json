If the state was transferred such that it was &quot;processed&quot;, then\n&gt; it&#39;s a success.  One can, I believe, quite reasonably define &quot;processed&quot;\n&gt; to include determining whether an XML document was well-formed or not\n&gt; ... if that meets your needs.\n\nSure, in that case your resource is just an XML parser, not an\napplication that consumes well-formed and perhaps valid XML.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because it&#39;s an error.  An error response describes the specifics of\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except to do a logical &quot;Back&quot;; as far as the state of the application\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never\nhappened.\n[snip]\n&gt; No, you got it, that&#39;s what I meant.  &quot;Back&quot; from the &quot;400 page&quot;, so to\n&gt; speak.\n\nOkay, then the application still has the same means for proceeding\nthrough the application that it did before the error.  Should be no\nproblem in terms of state machine.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ah, thanks.  So it would seem the part of 2616 that says 400 is about\n&gt; &gt; syntax error specifically kind of violates that class/subclass thing,\nsince\n&gt; &gt; other 4xx responses are not about syntax.  Season to taste?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dunno, you&#39;ll have to ask the editors.\n\nOkay.  Editors?\n\n--Walden\n\n\n\n"}}
