So if you follow a link relation &#39;user&#39; and you get back a\n&gt; representation of a resource that includes the property &#39;age&#39; - you\n&gt; know the meaning of that property is &#39;the age of this user (resource)&#39;\n&gt; because the user rel has documentation which tells you that.\n\nWe have recently been going through this discussion on another mailing list \nand, yes, I agree with you that this approach works for a lot of \napplications. But for some uses link-rels just ain&#39;t enough - and Linked \nData seems to be one of them. I am no expert at LD but I believe I \nunderstand the triple &lt;subject, predicate, object&gt; conecpt - which is very \nmuch similar to link-rels &lt;origin-resource, relation, target-resource&gt;.\n\nIn HAL&#39;s world view a relation tells not only HOW a resource is related to \nanother - it also tells WHAT the other resource is. But some relations do \nnot work like this.\n\nTake the link-rel or predicate &quot;likes&quot;, meaning the subject X likes the \nobject Y, or in HAL/REST - resource X has a &quot;likes&quot; relation to resource Y. \nWhat does that tell about Y? Nothing. The Y resource can be a dog, a movie, \na place - anything - a client following &quot;likes&quot; won&#39;t have a clue about the \ntype of resource in the other end, and a property called &quot;Age&quot; could refer \nto just about anything.\n\n&gt; buf if you\n&gt; desperately felt the need to have your HAL representations explicitly\n&gt; typed so that they can &#39;stand on their own&#39; and not require a\n&gt; preceding link relation, then you could use a profile link to do this\n&gt; job (a la dret&#39;s ongoing work). I think that&#39;s a poor design decision,\n&gt; but it is perfectly possible.\n\nYes. It is perfectly possible and solves the problem above. But it is not \nfair to call it a poor design decision - there are certain use cases that \nrequires it - Linked Data seems to be one of them.\n\nThe conflict seems to stem from two different view points: data as plain \nmessages in a well known interaction versus data as typed resources taking \npart of the semantic web.\n\n/J�rn\n\n\n"}}
