Why is this now allowed?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not saying that is not allowed. I&#39;m just saying it is a bad idea.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Ok, that was nearly equal for me in this case.\n&gt; Why is it a bad idea to represent a right as resource, and the absence \n&gt; of a right with the absence of the resource?\n\nIt has to do with HATEOAS. The representation you obtain and maintain on \nthe client can guide it as to what it can do with that resource. This \nrepresentation could also be cached (either internally or via proxies). \nIt seems harder to be consistent in modelling the application state by \ninterpreting the meaning of a non-existing resource. How would you even \nknow it&#39;s a resource that models an access-right otherwise?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBruno.\n\n"}}
