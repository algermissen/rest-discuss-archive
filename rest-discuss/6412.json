The /resource;view=3Ded=\r\nit and /resource;view=3Dprint representations are, for all intents and purp=\r\noses, separate resources which are considered separate from /resource.  Wha=\r\nt is needed is a means to describe the relationship of both /resource;view=\r\n=3Dedit and /resource;view=3Dprint to be the same as /resource, removing th=\r\ne ambiguity (and thus the negative effects) of the URI alias.\n\nThis is easy=\r\n enough to do from a pragmatic standpoint by adding this line to the &lt;head&gt;=\r\n of ;view=3Dedit and ;view=3Dprint:\n\n&lt;meta name=3D&quot;ROBOTS&quot; content=3D&quot;NOIND=\r\nEX,NOFOLLOW&quot;/&gt;\n\nA legitimate search engine, i.e. Google, would otherwise re=\r\nturn /resource, /resource;view=3Dprint *and* /resource;view=3Dedit in the r=\r\nesults for a search which hits on /resource.  This keeps us from running af=\r\noul of the duplicate removal algorithms and getting &quot;scored down&quot; for SEO s=\r\nhenanigans with our intended aliases.  This is also done for the ;view=3Dpr=\r\nint representation.\n\nUnfortunately, this solution is lacking from a semanti=\r\nc standpoint.  I&#39;ve not yet delved into RDFa, but I hear I can describe URI=\r\n (1) to be the &quot;same as&quot; URI (2) to remove any ambiguity caused by the URI =\r\nalias.\n\nSo by doing both of these things, our edit-form and print-page &quot;int=\r\nended aliases&quot; do no harm.  This is why I suggest the term &quot;pseudo-resource=\r\n&quot; for the common use cases of edit forms and print pages.\n\n(1) http://examp=\r\nle.com/resource;view=3Dxhtml\n(2) http://example.com/resource;view=3Dhtml\n\nT=\r\nhese are meant as representations only, not as individual resources.  They =\r\ncould just as easily be resource.xhtml and resource.html, either way we hav=\r\ne an alias problem since each representation is, for all intents and purpos=\r\nes, separate resources which are separate from /resource.\n\nBut, this is onl=\r\ny true if (1) and (2) respond with a 200 OK!  My implementation 303-redirec=\r\nts (1) and (2) (and also ;view=3Dtext, come to think of it) to /resource th=\r\nereby removing the ambiguity and negating the alias.  Since (1) and (2) may=\r\n not be dereferenced they are only URIs not URLs, as per:\n\nhttp://www.w3.or=\r\ng/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14\n\nAlthough I&#39;m afraid the group may agre=\r\ne that I&#39;ve gotten that wrong somehow, I haven&#39;t gone mad yet, Mark.  ;-)\n\n=\r\nUnder my scheme, spiders only index the /resources on the system not the al=\r\niases, and always index the text-only version (my preference not to allow i=\r\nmage indexing).  A user following a search-result link never gets the ;view=\r\n=3Dedit page, but always gets content-negotiated into the (most) proper rep=\r\nresentation for their client.\n\nI&#39;ve also toyed with having /resource;view=\r\n=3Dedit 303-redirect to /resource.  This works, but it lacks the ability to=\r\n &quot;back out of&quot; (except by following a link) which isn&#39;t important for toggl=\r\ning between XHTML/HTML (which assumes the user knows what they&#39;re doing).  =\r\nFrom a usability perspective, I&#39;d prefer the ability to back out of the ;vi=\r\new=3Dprint and ;view=3Dedit options by either using the back function on th=\r\ne client or shortening the URL, in addition to being able to click a breadc=\r\nrumb link.\n\nThe only way I know of to make that work, is to allow those two=\r\n aliases to respond 200 OK and mitigate the effects.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;-----Original=\r\n Message-----\n&gt;From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, Aug=\r\nust 6, 2006 07:14 PM\n&gt;To: &#39;Joe Gregorio&#39;\n&gt;Cc: &#39;Scott Chapman&#39;, rest-discuss=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] How to GET a &lt;form&gt; for editi=\r\nng in RESTful design?\n&gt;\n&gt;On 8/6/06, Joe Gregorio &lt;joe.gregorio@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;&gt; On 8/5/06, Scott Chapman &lt;scott_list@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n If hitting a URL with GET is supposed to give you a view of the resource a=\r\nnd\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  it&#39;s not a form by default, then how to do you get a &lt;form...&gt; vie=\r\nw of it for\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  editing?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no restriction on the number of U=\r\nRIs that may refer to\n&gt;&gt; a resouce.\n&gt;\n&gt;Right.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Think, for example, o=\r\nf a wiki. where the &#39;view&#39; URI may be\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   http://www.intertwingly.net/w=\r\niki/pie/PaceSecurityConsiderations\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and the &#39;edit&#39; URI may be\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   =\r\nhttp://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/PaceSecurityConsiderations?action=3Ded=\r\nit\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These are two URIs that point to the same resource, just supplying=\r\n different\n&gt;&gt; representations.\n&gt;\n&gt;That way lies madness, IMO.\n&gt;\n&gt;The repres=\r\nentations returned from those two URIs are consistently\n&gt;different, which t=\r\nells us they identify different resources.
