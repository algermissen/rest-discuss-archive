Does it make the interface &quot;application neutral&quot;? Not  \nnecessarily. The application that is processing a representation needs  \nto know what the representation is about - i.e. it needs to know the  \nspecifics. Even in the case of Atom, the application needs to know  \nabout the content&#39;s media type, and any extensions used.\n\nIt may however, allow some domain-specific layered software do some  \nuseful stuff without understanding all the pieces of the  \nrepresentation. This is very similar to how SOAP intermediaries may be  \nable to process some SOAP headers. For instance, someone vendor using  \nXML representations with some common elements/attributes, so that  \ntheir gateway-level software can do some generic things.\n\n&gt; SOAP is indeed application neutral. Perhaps even more application  \n&gt; neutral than HTTP itself, since SOAP is little more than a framework  \n&gt; for an XML envelope with completely open ended XML header  \n&gt; processing. It is extremely application neutral. The problem is,  \n&gt; interface designers take the incredibly generic SOAP format and put  \n&gt; an incredibly application specific XML payload inside it. That&#39;s  \n&gt; like stepping of a neutrality cliff -- from extremely generic to  \n&gt; extremely specific in one step.\n\nHow else should they do it? If applications need to do &quot;real&quot; stuff,  \nthey need to exchange &quot;specifics&quot;. Why is this like stepping off a  \ncliff?\n\n&gt; Of course the same can happen (and does happen) with Atom entities  \n&gt; or even with representations returned by HTTP itself. But it seems  \n&gt; to us that interface designers in the REST &quot;camp&quot; seem to better  \n&gt; understand the importance of reusing existing representations for  \n&gt; new applications, not custom designing\n\nIt depends. Even the GData examples you cited do indeed have very  \nspecific representations wrapped inside a generic media types. That  \ndoes not make those architecture any more generic than, say, an  \napplication using &quot;foo/bar&quot; media type.\n\n&gt; representations for each new application. An example of this is the  \n&gt; RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a transport protocol, but  \n&gt; rather an &quot;application protocol&quot;, albeit a VERY application neutral  \n&gt; one. What we haven&#39;t seen yet, even from the REST &quot;camp&quot; is much in  \n&gt; the way of fairly generic ATOM entities to go\n\nI am really confused by this. By adding a &quot;fifth constraint&quot; I thought  \nthis report is agreeing with the other four constraints, and hence  \nthat HTTP is an application protocol. Not so? How does WOA treat HTTP?  \nAs an application protocol or as a transport protocol?\n\n&gt;  inside the ATOM &quot;envelope&quot;. Many REST examples using ATOM step off  \n&gt; the same cliff.\n\nCould you give an example please? How would you build an app that does  \nnot fall of this cliff.\n\nSincerely,\nSubbu\n\n"}}
