One article I found (on this very list)\n&gt; suggests using GET and POST makes more sense for untrusted (browser)\n&gt; clients. If this is the case, then how does one define in a POST that\n&gt; it is actually a DELETE or PUT?\n\nDefining a POST that updates a resource is straight forward. If it happens\nto\nreplace every property of the resource then it is equivalent to a PUT.\nUsing POST is a lot more flexible than PUT because:\n      - you don&#39;t have to replace everything\n      - you can submit a change that impacts more than one resource.\nWith a PUT you must submit the entire state of the resource (at least that\nseems to be the consensus) but with a POST you may only submit\nthose properties/attributes/state that you wish to change.\n\nAs far as implementing DELETE in terms of POST, consider\ndo you really want your customers deleting data from your site?\nAn alternative is to allow the customer to change the state of the\nresource so that it is ... retired, closed, inactive or terminated.\nAt that point you could make the resource read-only (GET)\nand purge the resource at a later time, perhaps after it has been\narchived. It is a lot easier to implement this than to implement\nthe kind of authorisation neccessary to verify which resources\na customer can or cannot DELETE.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\nNational Australia Bank Ltd - ABN 12 004 044 937\nThis email may contain confidential information.
