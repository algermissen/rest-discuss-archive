Intermediaries cache a\npublic representation for the case of no Authorization header.\n\nThe system is expected to have far more random traffic than logged-in\ntraffic, so this is where I care the most about cache hit ratio without\nthe latency induced by must-revalidate.  My fallback method would be to\nset a short-expire cookie indicating user role, and Vary: Cookie.  The \nrepresentations themselves don&#39;t have to be secure, but of course PUT,\nPOST, PATCH and DELETE requests are restricted by Authorization header.\n\n-Eric\n\n&quot;Eric J.

They are role-based.  User role determines the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; available state transitions in the representation, excluding the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interface to methods not allowed for their role.  All variants are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same media type, but cache-control remains set to public.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conneg only varies on the Authorization header, media type doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enter into the equation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I replied before, this is not negotiation. This is\n&gt; &gt; authentication. In authentication schemes like digest and OAuth,\n&gt; &gt; Authorization headers are based on nonces, and hence varying by\n&gt; &gt; Authorization header (with CC: public) leads to poor cache hit\n&gt; &gt; ratio. So, I am curious to see how well this worked with shared\n&gt; &gt; caches.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It didn&#39;t work at all, at first.  However, if the intermediary is\n&gt; instructed that it must-revalidate, it makes a HEAD request to the\n&gt; origin server, the response from which has a Content-Location header\n&gt; containing an URL.  If that resource is cached, the intermediary\n&gt; serves it to the requesting client.  This is negotiation based on\n&gt; authentication, which comes with the tradeoff of requiring must-\n&gt; revalidate.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n\n"}}
