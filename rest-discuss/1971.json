Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; As I was thinking about whether long-lived transactions can be done with\n&gt; HTTP or not - from that message with DonB&#39;s comments - I thought of some\n&gt; ideas that may help communicate the ideas behind REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; A business protocol - like sending and receiving purchase orders and\n&gt; invoices - looks like a really simple thing to do with HTTP. You\njust send\n&gt; the purchase order in a request and get the purchase order\nacknowledgement\n&gt; in the response. The problem with this is that the idea that you are\nsending\n&gt; documents with HTTP is incorrect. A /messaging/ protocol would be\n&gt; appropriate to send documents with. For HTTP, what you are sending are\n&gt; messages /about a resource/.\n&gt; A business protocol is an abstract conceptual thing - with concepts like\n&gt; purchase order, invoice, etc. Resources are also abstract conceptual\n&gt; things - they can represent anything, even things /before/ they actually\n&gt; &#39;exist&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you use HTTP to implement business protocols, the messages you send\n&gt; will be about resources that you and your partners have agreed are\nnecessary\n&gt; in order to conduct business. The HTTP message will be /about/ a\npurchase\n&gt; order, it won&#39;t /be/ a purchase order.\n&gt; For example, a business protocol may specify that a PO has a PO-ACK to\n&gt; confirm its receipt and an Invoice to request payment (ignoring the\n&gt; role-dependent document naming issues). Rather than describe who\nsends what\n&gt; and when, an HTTP based business protocol would describe what\ndocuments (and\n&gt; other pieces) are resources and who is responsible for creating them and\n&gt; what operations are legal at certain points in the transaction. With\nthis\n&gt; approach the resource can have an identifier regardless of how many\nmessages\n&gt; have been exchanged and the resource can &#39;exist&#39; independent of the\nexchange\n&gt; of content.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, a big partner could pre-allocate a range of document\nIDs for\n&gt; their small partners and over time these would be echoed back to the big\n&gt; partner - the resource identifier exists and is valid to talk about and\n&gt; message about independent of any exchange of content.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a growing sense that systems built on REST principles tend to not\n&gt; look like document messaging systems - you tend to interact with\ndocuments,\n&gt; rather than send and receive documents (where &#39;document&#39; is a higher\nlevel\n&gt; concept like purchase order, etc.).\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway... just some thoughts.\n\n\n"}}
