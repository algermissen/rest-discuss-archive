The correction of the\nerror may mean that all of the costs for each downstream transaction\nand inventory resource are now also incorrect, so the server\nautomatically propagates the effect of the change on all of those\ndownstream resources.  The initiating user message was\nself-descriptive in its effect on the initial transaction, but the\ninitiating user may not understand the full downstream effects of the\nchange.  But they would be disappointed if the profit on the sale of\nthe end product was incorrect.\n\nThis is all RESTful, because the initiating message was\nself-descriptive and the downstream side-effects follow logically if\nthe user understands accounting logic.\n\n"}}
