Nonetheless, I see a lot of businesses obfuscating\n&gt; URIs or creating them for each (business) transaction, presumably so\n&gt; that people can&#39;t easily remember or share them. How much they really\n&gt; benefit from that practice I can&#39;t say, but it seems to be considered a\n&gt; good idea.\n\nWell I did say that the download URI and license URI would usually be\nseparate. By license URI I meant a license key that makes the download\nwork. That key could be at a URI that only lasts for ten minutes. You\ncould have a red flag go up if it detects multiple downloads from\ndifferent IP addresses. But in the end you can only make it marginally\nharder to share the data.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
