Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;less\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;mapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,\n&gt;&gt;since I needed additional things like edit windows and\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;/client?uri={uri}\n&gt;&gt;    Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation\n&gt;&gt;    {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The\n&gt;&gt;    &quot;/{id}/access&quot; URI would be the &quot;main&quot; URI, which would return\n&gt;&gt;    the entry page, main menu, etc.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;[snip]\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value\n&gt;&gt;of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}\n&gt;&gt;        returns the main menu options\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;[snip]\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, it occurs to me that there are a few  design problems here...\n&gt;\n&gt;First, suppose I had an RNA address of http://example.com/rna/seairth and\n&gt;the client software was at http://example.com/rnaclient.  According to the\n&gt;above stuff, the &#39;entry-point&#39; would be:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://example.com/rnaclient?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/access\n&gt;\n&gt;Frankly, this isn&#39;t very user-friendly.  First, the URL is way to long to\n&gt;have to type in.  Second, it requires me to know/remember the URI of my\n&gt;&quot;access&quot; resource.  \n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure I would worry too much about the URI being too long.  No \nmatter what the length, the user will probably just bookmark it anyway.\n\nIf your client software has the same host as your RNA address and your \naccess URIs are always the same except for the id part (seairth above), \nthen I could easily see where you have a default page at \nhttp://example.com/rnaclient that asks you for your id (seairth in this \ncase) and then fowards/redirects you to the appropriate page using the \nURI above.  Once there, the user shouldn&#39;t have to type any URIs - he \nshould be able to click his way anywhere else he needs to go.  And given \none URI, the server should be able to generate content containing \nappropriately formed URIs for that user.\n\n\n&gt;So what would be some solutions?  So far, I have thought\n&gt;of the following (along with their limitations):\n&gt;\n&gt;1) The client could have a &quot;default&quot; URI, but this would only be useful\n&gt;where a particular copy of the client was being used by one person only.\n&gt;\n\nThis isnt a whole lot different than the way mail clients work right \nnow.  Each user has a separate copy of the client configured with their \nmail server info.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;2) Instead, one could use just the RNA Address\n&gt;(http://example.com/rna/seairth) and the client would auto-append the\n&gt;&quot;access&quot; bit.  If the server returned a 404, it could then try other\n&gt;possibilities, effectively hunting for the interface.  This solution is not\n&gt;very flexible, since all it would take is a particular inplementation to\n&gt;change the path slightly (e.g. &quot;client-access&quot;) in order for the client to\n&gt;fail discovery.\n&gt;\n\nWhy bother with the hunting part?  For the sake of interop, just require \nthat the access page is the rna address with /access appended. Once \nenough implementations do it that way, any implementation that does it \ndifferently will be considered broken.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3) If no uri is given, show a simple form requesting the appropriate access\n&gt;URI.  Once given, store as a cookie to auto-fill the textbox in future.\n&gt;Problems: not portable, still requires knowledge of access URI, etc.\n&gt;\n\nUggh.  Plenty of other options.  Let&#39;s drop this one.\n\n&gt;4) Double up the access URI and the RNA address.  Since the only purpose of\n&gt;the access URI is to return an xml document, it would be possible to use\n&gt;conneg on a GET of the RNA Address.  This way, a user would only have to\n&gt;know their own RNA Address (which they would anyhow).  This could be coupled\n&gt;with #3 above, where the coookie bit would only be a convenience.  The down\n&gt;side is that I&#39;m not too crazy about overloading the RNA Address like this\n&gt;(purely from a technical POV; I think end-users would be oblivious and\n&gt;therefore fine with it).\n&gt;\n\nWhat&#39;s the hangup.  Actually, the only problems I can think of are \nsemantic, not technical - in one case the URI identifies a user, in the \nother, the URI identifies the user&#39;s access page.  Given recent \ndiscussion on the TAG list, this might not be the &#39;purest&#39; way to do \nthings, but it sure seems practical.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;5) Move the client to be under the RNA Address, effectively replacing the\n&gt;&quot;access URI&quot;.  Through conneg, it would still be possible to return the\n&gt;original XML document from the client URI so that &quot;thick&quot; clients could\n&gt;still have access.  The main advantage here is that the URI would be\n&gt;memorable (e.g. http://example.com/rna/seairth/client).  However, it seems\n&gt;somewhat like overkill to pass entire URIs in the query string, esp. since\n&gt;it would be unlikely that you would use the client to access any RNA address\n&gt;other than the one it was under.  On the other hand, I could be wrong here.\n&gt;For instance, this would allow one to customize the look-and-feel of the\n&gt;client program, then access other RNA Addresses while continuing to keep\n&gt;that look-and-feel.  When accessing another site, you would have to use\n&gt;something akin to the original syntax (e.g.\n&gt;http://example.com/rna/seairth/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob), but\n&gt;it&#39;s probably fine at that point.\n&gt;\n\nWhy not http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob \nwhen you&#39;re on a different server?\n\nWhy does bob need to know about seairth (or seairth&#39;s rna address)?\n\nI think any of the above would probably work out just fine (although I \nreally dont like 3).\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
