The root url will be : http://my.server.com/root\n&gt;  I think there is some points to consider:\n&gt;     * What this url should return: some information about the resource, or\na\n&gt; listing of its contents (groups). If a listing is allowed, this raise the\n&gt; recursive issue. Is recursively restful. I thought about these solutions:\n&gt;             1.  &lt;root&gt;\n&gt;                     some information\n&gt;                     &lt;group1 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/group.1&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;                     &lt;group2 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/group.2&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;                     ...\n&gt;                 &lt;/root&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             2.a &lt;root&gt;\n&gt;                     &lt;group1&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;attribute1a&gt;value&lt;/attribute1a&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;element11 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/element.1.1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;                         ...\n&gt;                     &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n&gt;                     ...\n&gt;                 &lt;/root&gt;\n&gt;             2.b &lt;root&gt;\n&gt;                     &lt;group1 attribute1a=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;element11 xlink:href=&quot;url/to/element.1.1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;                         ...\n&gt;                     &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n&gt;                     ...\n&gt;                 &lt;/root&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             3   &lt;root&gt;\n&gt;                     &lt;group1&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;attribute1a&gt;value&lt;/attribute1a&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;element11&gt;\n&gt;                             &lt;attribute11a&gt;value&lt;/attribute11a&gt;\n&gt;                         &lt;/element11&gt;\n&gt;                         ...\n&gt;                     &lt;group2&gt;...&lt;/group2&gt;\n&gt;                     ...\n&gt;                 &lt;/root&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Note that they could be 3.b with attribute values as ``real&quot; xml\n&gt; attributes, but this difference (between 2.a and 2.b is an other debate).\nI\n&gt; think the first solution is the more restful one. But I&#39;d like to be able\nto\n&gt; save the resources for a local access, and to avoid to have to save\n&gt; multiples files, making links relatives, etc. This explain the 3rd\nsolution\n&gt; (the 2nd one is just un hybrid, which is not very useful :) The question\nis:\n&gt; is it correct to make the 3rd solution available at\n&gt; http://my.server.com/root?recursive=true or\n&gt; http://my.server.com/root?recursive=2 where recursive=0 is the 1rst\nsolution\n&gt; and recursive=1 the second one.\n&gt;\n&gt;     * The other issue is: what should be the url to groups and elements\n(and\n&gt; possibly attributes).\n&gt;         1. http://my.server.com/root/group1/element11\n&gt;         2. http://my.server.com/root?group=1&element=11\n&gt;         3. without the hierarchy http://my.server.com/root?attribute=11a\n&gt; directly\n&gt;\n&gt;     and is an hybrid solution possible (e.g\n&gt; http://my.server.com/root/group1?element=11, or\n&gt; http://my.server.com/root/group1/element11?attribute=11a)\n&gt;\n&gt;     I think that the path form (1) is better for access, since the query\none\n&gt; (3) is better for search queries.\n&gt;\n&gt;     To be more concrete, suppose that groups are contacts &#39;groups (which\n&gt; attribute is a description), elements are contacts and attributes are mail\n&gt; address, phone number, name and description. The goal is to allow the\naccess\n&gt; to coordinates, groups or contacts (e.g a ldap gateway) and to save them\nto\n&gt; a single file (see first point) to local access.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
