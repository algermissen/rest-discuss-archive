If I understa=\r\nnd\n&gt; your proposal correctly, you are updating the real accounts before\n&gt; c=\r\nommitting, and then reversing the updates upon rollback.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you update=\r\n the real accounts before commit, what if somebody\n&gt; withdraws the money fr=\r\nom account 55 before rollback (between steps 3\n&gt; and 4)?\n&gt; \n&gt; (One example =\r\nof the many potential problems with &quot;compensation&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;undo&quot; rollbacks.)\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe an interim withdrawal is unlikely in a quick account transfer\n&gt; =\r\nscenario, but how about an order offer-acceptance transaction?  If the\n&gt; re=\r\nal order is created before acceptance without any sign of\n&gt; provisionality,=\r\n it will look to the fulfillment systems like an\n&gt; accepted order, and the =\r\nfulfillment system may trigger pick, pack and\n&gt; ship.\n\nBased on what I wrot=\r\ne your assumption is correct but it isn&#39;t what I\nwas thinking. I&#39;m guilty o=\r\nf making an assumption, sorry.\nThe actual resources would not be updated un=\r\ntil the transaction is\ncommitted,  The reason I suggested an alternative to=\r\n the books example\nis that the structure of the URI implied that only certa=\r\nin operations\ncan be transactional i.e. ones defined as transactional by th=\r\ne service\ndeveloper, like account Transfers \nI prefer to think that every o=\r\nperation can be part of a transaction\n\nOn seconds thoughts using the URI ma=\r\ny be better with some slight\nmodification.\n1) Create transaction\nPOST /tran=\r\nsactions/\nThe Response returns the URI of the transaction\n/transactions/{tr=\r\nansactionID}\n\n2) Perform any operations to included in the transaction \nOPE=\r\nRATION /transactions/{transactionID}/{Resource URL}\n\nCommit and roll back w=\r\nould be as before.\n\nThis allows any operation on any resource to be part of=\r\n the transaction.\n\n\nEoin - http://www.eoinprout.com/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
