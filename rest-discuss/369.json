They&#39;ll prefer tunelling to security-paranoid design\nanyhow! There could actually be a business model in setting up secure\nevent handlers that do the equivalent of spam and virus filtering. The\nclient would open up a single connection to that service and thus have a\ntrusted client and a trusted filtering intermediary. Rather than\nignoring security it could be a virtue of the new model. Through bridges\nto napster, kazaa, etc., you could get generic peer-to-peer connectivity\nintermediated by someone who cares about and thinks about security.\n\nAs I said in another note, if I&#39;m going to bed for the night I feel\nsafer knowing that I&#39;m &quot;disconnected&quot; from the incoming Web than knowing\nthat I am using a protocol that is ostensibly designed to be easy to\nsecure. No matter how easy it is to secure someone may screw up so I&#39;d\nrather just tunnel to the &quot;event Web&quot; and withdraw when I&#39;m done with\nit.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I am curious whether you know who coined the term\n&quot;resource modelling.&quot;\n\nI think it is great. REST is the overall web architectural style but\nresource modelling is what individual application creators do in order\nto take advantage of the architecture. It is a discipline like object\noriented modelling. It will eventually have its own terminology and\ntextual/graphical notations.\n\nPerhaps it was coined by Mike D?\n\n * http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/003204.html\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
