POX is simply a way to represent a  \n&gt;&gt; resource, right?\n&gt;&gt; A resource might be text, might be HTML markup, might be plain old  \n&gt;&gt; XML, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; A lot of people use that term to denote RPC over XML over HTTP.  The\n&gt; URL is the operation you&#39;re invoking, XML is the payload, and\n&gt; everything is carried using POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assaf\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think of REST as a method of exposing those text, HTML, or POX  \n&gt;&gt; resources.\n&gt;&gt; So it&#39;s not really REST vs POX.  It&#39;s REST+POX, REST+HTML, etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In your colleagues&#39; industry they may be able to leverage their  \n&gt;&gt; existing POX\n&gt;&gt; payloads in a RESTful manner through sensible URL&#39;s, stateless  \n&gt;&gt; execution,\n&gt;&gt; etc.\n&gt;&gt; In the process of doing so, they may decide to rationalize their POX\n&gt;&gt; payloads\n&gt;&gt; into more resource-centric representations of their data.  Or they  \n&gt;&gt; may find\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; their POX payloads are already resource-centric and they just want to\n&gt;&gt; beautify their access patterns.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Kevin\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Sean Kennedy\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 29, 2008 8:24 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: Rest Discussion Group\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] REST vs POX\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Folks,\n&gt;&gt;      I work in academia and was recently talking to some former  \n&gt;&gt; industry\n&gt;&gt; colleagues (financial people). I asked them how they implemented  \n&gt;&gt; SOA and\n&gt;&gt; they said POX. They didnt know must about REST (something I intend to\n&gt;&gt; rectify!). They didnt like SOAP because there was too much XML  \n&gt;&gt; involved and\n&gt;&gt; they dont use WSDL because &quot;we know where the service is&quot;. However,  \n&gt;&gt; I found\n&gt;&gt; it difficult to argue the point of the advantages of REST versus  \n&gt;&gt; POX...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sean.\n\n\n"}}
