The concern is that someone might go to a library and \n&gt; che=\r\nck their bank balance and forget to shutdown the browser, \n&gt; allowing anoth=\r\ner person to come along and continue to use the \n&gt; credentials provided by =\r\nthe first user.  A time-out at least \n&gt; limits their exposure.\n\nTimeouts ar=\r\ne also used to mange server load; which wouldn&#39;t be a problem\nwith systems =\r\nthat didn&#39;t use server sided sessions - then again there&#39;s\na lot of sites o=\r\nn the web that use sessions. And timeouts aren&#39;t even\nsufficient in some ca=\r\nses. In a non-GET scenario, it&#39;s possible to have a\nbrowser resubmit a logi=\r\nn page simply by refreshing what looks like a\ndifferent page or hitting the=\r\n back button *after* you logout (and your\nsession is closed on the server).=\r\n This can happen easily enough with\ncontroller type architectures (consider=\r\ned best practice in servlets/jsp\nland), where you GET a login page, POST th=\r\ne login and are redirected\nbehind the scenes to an inbox page; if you POST =\r\nlogout and refresh\n(POST) the inbox page, chances are be logged back in (or=\r\n maybe someone\nelse will log you back). I like the idea of stateless server=\r\ns and client\nsided session management, but you&#39;d need to throw out a lot of=\r\n sites and\nbrowsers to see that realized. \n\nBill de h=D3ra \n--\nPropylon\nwww=\r\n.propylon.com \n\n \n\n\n"}}
