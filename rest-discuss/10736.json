The abstract of RFC 2616\n(&lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt&gt;) reads, in part, as\nfollows.\n\n&#39;The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol\n[...] which can be used for many tasks [...] through extension of its\nrequest methods, error codes and headers [...]. [...] This specification\ndefines the protocol referred to as &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;.&#39;\n\nIf RFC 2616 is definitive on HTTP/1.1, then any method that is not\nspecified in RFC 2616 is not part of HTTP/1.1 and is not conformant with\nHTTP/1.1. Sure, the methods &quot;SEARCH&quot; and &quot;REPORT&quot; are part of the larger\nfamily of HTTP, as the abstract implies. Sure, these methods are often\nin messages whose HTTP-Version is &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;. If you take the stand that\nRFC 2616 is not definitive on HTTP/1.1, I won&#39;t censor you or dislike\nyou or speak ill of you behind your back. I&#39;ll just disagree.\n\nIn any case, none of this matters regarding Representational State\nTransfer, which has no constraint on which specifications define which\nprotocol features.\n\n-- \nEtan Wexler.\n\n\n"}}
