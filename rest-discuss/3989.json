Suppose you know I&#39;ve\nbeen renovating my house for the last 4 years, and you&#39;re interested\nin that project.\n\nSuppose I (the author) assign a URI as an identifier of the concept\n&quot;Walden&#39;s house renovation&quot;, and give you that URI.\n\nSuppose that you use a browser or whatever to deference that URI\nperiodically over a span of several years.  Suppose that each time\nyou do so, you retrieve a different &quot;document&quot; in response, each one\nrepresenting at the time of dereferencing the project under study.\n\nNote that if each document so served required its own URI, then\nthere would be no identity at the level of my project, only identity\nof documents representing it.  That would not serve your interest in\nmy project as well as having an identifier that targets the project\ndirectly.\n\nAs the &quot;author&quot;, I assign the URI, and then manage the implementation\nsuch that the representations all support a &quot;sameness&quot; of subject.  Roy\nuses the word &quot;semantic&quot; there.\n\nRegards,\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &lt;jalgermissen@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, October 01, 2003 9:32 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] REST&#39;s Definition of Resource\n\n\n:\n: Hello--\n:\n: I have some questions regarding REST&#39;s definition[1] of resource:\n:\n: REST (re-)defines resource to be an abstraction not only of a)\n: information\n: resources (e.g. Web pages) but also of a) services and b) abstract\n: concepts.\n: While I see a clear reason for the neccessity of b) for REST to be an\n: architecture suitable for distributed systems I cannot see a reason for\n: c). IMHO,\n: abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\n: are\n: subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\n: words:\n: subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\n: part\n: of the architecture itself).\n:\n: Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\n: include\n: c) ?\n:\n: The second question I have is related to the question what the\n: semantics of a resource are.  Roy&#39;s dissertation says:\n:\n: &quot;REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the\n:  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather\n:  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the\n:  time the reference is created.&quot;\n:\n: To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the\n: semantics of resources.  What is the precise meaning of &#39;author&#39; here?\n: Author of a &#39;document&#39; that uses a particular URI or the author that\n: somhow &#39;brings into being&#39; a particular resource?\n:\n: Thanks,\n:\n: Jan\n:\n: [1]\n: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2\n:\n:\n: -- \n: Jan Algermissen                &lt;algermissen@...&gt;\n: Consultant & Programmer\n:\n: http://www.topicmapping.com\n: http://www.gooseworks.org\n:\n:\n: To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n: rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n:\n:\n:\n: Your use of Yahoo!
