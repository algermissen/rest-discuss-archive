You can see that thru\nthe summary descriptions of RESTEasy and Restlets. The designers of these\nframeworks are taking for granted that integration-thru-protocol has been\nmostly achieved via HTTP. They are attempting to simplify - not standardize\n- the building of HTTP based applications using the design guidelines of\nREST.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Mike Schinkel\nSent: Monday, February 26, 2007 10:18 PM\nTo: &#39;Nic James Ferrier&#39;\nCc: &#39;damnhandy2000&#39;; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] RE: New REST framework for Java\n\nNic James Ferrier wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Mike Schinkel&quot; &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt;writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have no problem with sharing ideas. But just as Roy Fielding does \n&gt; &gt; not believe it is a good thing for a GET to change state, I do not \n&gt; &gt; believe it is a good thing to have lots of libraries and frameworks \n&gt; &gt; offered with what amounts to arbitrarily differences. I think it \n&gt; &gt; should be a best practice to have *consideration* for prior art and \n&gt; &gt; not to duplicate prior art if there are no obvious benefits.  I \n&gt; &gt; think the unnecessary fragmentation of libraries and frameworks \n&gt; &gt; holds back progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; The trouble is, we&#39;re in the early days of REST frameworks. You expect \n&gt; to see some proliferation before consolidation.\n&gt; \n&gt; The market (in it&#39;s abstract sense rather than it&#39;s specific monetary \n&gt; form) will sort it out.\n\nYou are probably completely right.  \n\nIt&#39;s just I&#39;ve been through so damn many of these cycles and seen so many\nerrors already that I&#39;m hoping we can follow Otto von Bismarck&#39;s lead, not\nGeorge W.
