Transactions over HTTP should be optional,\ndiscoverable, negotiable, based on optimistic commits, and (in the\ncase of failures) use compenstating requests as a way to reverse\nprevious work.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\n\nand\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\nWhat is described here is a transaction service interface (TSI) that\nclients and servers can choose to implement in ways all parties can\nagree upon. This is the way media-types are currenly handled and TSIs\ncould be defined, documented, and registered in much the same way.\nThis includes the possibility of registering a media-type that matches\nthe TSI implementation. True to the archetictural style of the HTTP\nprotocol, this approach proposes a &quot;uniform interface&quot; for handling\nunits of work over HTTP.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n"}}
