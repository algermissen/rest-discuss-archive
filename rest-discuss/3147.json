In response to criticism\n&gt; [3], I am looking for constructive suggestions as to how to make this\n&gt; interface more compatible with REST.\n\nI agree with you that this interface is REST compatible, but because the\nnature of the information is very transient I believe you won&#39;t see a lot of\nthe benefits of REST. This is just my opinion though.\nI think there is a spectrum of capabilities that designers can add to\nsystems to get the most bang for the buck. At the low end of the spectrum\nyou might be &#39;compatible&#39;, but not really full featured - the tree isn&#39;t big\nenough to hang a lot of fruit on.\nIf you add more features to your validator service you might begin seeing\nmore possibilities - but just to do this one thing, its fine as it is.\n\nThings to add:\n1. persistence\nIf the service remembered the POSTed data, then the service could provide a\nURI that can be used to announce to the world the shameful RSS that was sent\nto it.\n\n2. links\nIf the client wanted to expose the prospective data as a Resource (requiring\nan &#39;origin server&#39; in REST speak), then the validation service only needs to\nbe given a URI - and perhaps it could be implemented via GET. This is\nanalagous to a file system utility that validates an XML file - like command\npiping in Unix, except with URIs and the Web.\nIt would be interesting to create an extreme example of technology abuse by\nhaving a client take the transient data, open a port to receive HTTP\nrequests on, send the URI to the service, respond to the GET with the\ntransient data, and then close the port. Kind of like creating a temp file\nto pipe to a file-only aware command line utility.\n\n3. response status\nThe client detects HTTP response status of 500 and above - is this for\ndetecting service failure or for detecting invalid RSS? I think that the\nservice should successfully report validation completion via a 2xx status\nand use response content to describe the validity of the POSTed content.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
