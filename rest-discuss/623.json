A notification is not a way of pushing resources from\n&gt; source to sink.  Anything that is about pushing resources from source to sink is\n&gt; an update.\n\nIt also means that we can completely separate\nsubscription from notification.  NOTIFY is simply\na method telling a server that a resource is out\nof date.  The server may or may not know or care\nto resolve the situation.\n\nA client might also request that a server NOTIFY\nanother SERVER under various conditions (a\nsubscription), but that is a separate protocol.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
