It wasn&#39;t designed.\nHowever it was improved based on a keen eye, but this is why I suggested\npeople work on actual implementations that can be evaluated against the\nexpectations. The key expectation here is that there is only one consumer.\nThe next most important part is that the message should be lost in the face\nof a failed consumer.\n\nBuild something or describe something, then measure it against this and\nwe&#39;ll start seeing progress.\n\n\nAs for xmlrouter, that&#39;s just a little project I poke at occasionally which\nwas an offshoot of my work at KnowNow many ages ago. If anybody knows erlang\nand has some spare time and would like to change the world, give me call.\n\nMike\n\n \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: jheintz@...

I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about a primitive operation that supports readers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One writer alone could drive hundreds of readers. Just to pick an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example: one writer pushes positive integers and many \n&gt; readers check \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for prime numbers. Not a very useful example on it&#39;s own, \n&gt; but that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; single writer could drive many, many readers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This thread (and the reliable messaging proposals for REST) have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed many issues (like network failures. Perhaps ordered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; messaging isn&#39;t covered already.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if a single generalized primitive operation is good \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to address this issue. This seems like a more variable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem than &quot;many writers&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the things I&#39;ve been thinging about is how to re-implement \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the EIP patterns in RESTful systems, like Competing Consumers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems like a tough problem without another method. I haven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; found a really good example of what to base that on \n&gt; though. Reading \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the GFS paper I realized that the append operation on GFS files \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supports many writers, but GFS doesn&#39;t have an operation for many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; readers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John Heintz\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 6/13/07, Mike Dierken &lt;dierken@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outside of MOM I don&#39;t know of any generalized support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for many readers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You mean, many readers (of a single resource/message) \n&gt; but only one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consumer/processor of that one resource?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John D.
