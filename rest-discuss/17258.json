By generalizing from documents to /anything/, the resources and their relationships (via their representations), are potentially a lot more open to direct machine processing.\n&gt;\n\nI thought this was already done via the redefinition from UDI to URI.\n\n&gt; There may well also be some more useful infrastructure subsystem bits (akin to those described by Fielding in his thesis) enabled by RESTful HTTP + semweb tech. For example, an RDF store (server- or client-side) is essentially a cache of a little chunk of the Web of Data. A SPARQL endpoint offers an efficient mode of access to that cache. Going one step further, a generic intelligent linked data proxy could be composed this way.\n&gt;\n\nThanks for bringing up the &quot;triple stores are caches&quot;-idea and its \ngeneralization &quot;generic intelligent linked data proxy&quot; (&quot;triple stores \nare intermediaries&quot;; triples stores in the sense of a whole system alï¿½ \nVirtuoso). To avoid Linked Data tapping in the same &quot;data silo&quot; pitfall \n(cf. [1]). That means, we should be interested in closing the \ninformation flow life cycle by bringing back information changes to \ntheir origin information services. There is/was a &quot;pushback&quot; initiative \non the ESW wiki[2], which investigated some thoughts into this \ndirection. However, this initiative seems to be fell asleep somehow. One \nresult, I concluded also from the findings of this initiative again, is \nthe problem of tackling the heterogeneity of origin non-Semantic-Web \ninformation services. So descriptions of such information services can \nmaybe help (see a starting point [3]), because the integration of \ninformation services general on the Web is a crucial mission.\n\n&gt; Going off-topic a little, I reckon the parts needed for a really useful, compelling and *interesting* Web of data include:\n&gt;\n&gt; * improved linkage between data sets, to facilitate easier discovery\n&gt; * refactoring of traditional data-based activities to use (just-in-time) linked data\n&gt; * new user interface paradigms to work with linked data\n&gt; * a lot more imagination!\n\n+1 ;)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n\n[1] \nhttp://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2009/08/distribution-and-the-semantic-web.html\n[2] http://esw.w3.org/PushBackDataToLegacySources\n[3] \nhttp://infoserviceonto.smiy.org/2010/11/25/on-resources-information-resources-and-documents/\n\n"}}
