Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I want clients:\n&gt; 1. to be able to rertrieve the entire folder\n&gt; 2. to be able to retreive only messages that have\n&gt;    been added to the folder without retrieving\n&gt;    already received messages whose representations\n&gt;    have changed\nSo for #2 you want &#39;all messages I haven&#39;t seen&#39;, regardless whether there\nare messages that have been seen and modified (with updated URL to\nattachments)? I thought you /did/ want to see messages that have changed,\neven though they are old messages.\n\n\n&gt; My proposed solution is to return\n&gt; multipart/byteranges as a response to queries with\n&gt; etags.\nIt seems like you are trying to use a single logical resource to do both\nthese tasks, and it may be much easier if you use two or more resources.\n\nI don&#39;t know if it is &#39;correct&#39; to use the same URI but different ETags to\nachieve different representations. Perhaps it is, and this might be an\nelegant way of doing it.\n\n&gt; I suppose I could also return any diff\n&gt; format, but I&#39;m not aware of one that is\n&gt; particularly better suited to this problem than\n&gt; multipart/byteranges.\nLike I said, binary deltas bother me - I&#39;d go with record based deltas,\nrather than byte index based.\nYou may run into problems with versioning between client and server. The\nbyte range for older version may not be compatible with newer versions,\nwhereas record based is easier to consume.\n\n\n"}}
