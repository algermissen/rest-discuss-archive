Some of the salient points:\n\n&quot;RFC 2396 fails spectacularly as a definition of &quot;resource&quot;. It&#39;s wrong to \ncommend a definition which doesn&#39;t provide any traction (a property, or \ncondition, or state) by which one might distinguish between its \n*definiendum*, the thing being defined, in this case, resource, and \nanything else at all. &quot;\n\n&quot;At least two things follow from this criticism. First, it doesn&#39;t seem to \nmake much practical difference that RFC 2396 and the APW rely on a weird \ndefinition of &quot;resource&quot;. Second, in the problem domain of Web \nspecifications and standards, the conceptual boundaries between &quot;resource&quot;, \n&quot;identity&quot;, &quot;identifier&quot;, and &quot;representation&quot; are gerrymandered, \nconstantly shifting, and provisional at best.&quot;\n\n&quot;According to the APW (more accurately, to my reading of an early draft of \nthe APW), a URI identifies one and only one *resource*, unambiguously, and \nthe fragment identifier part of an absolute URI reference identifies some \npart of the *representation* of that resource. In effect, URIs have two \nnamespaces: one which points to entities with the shared information space \nof the Web, another which points inside the representational space of the \nstate of a Web resource. If URIs identify one and only resource, is there a \nparallel expectation that fragment identifiers identity one and only part \n(for lack of a more general word) of a representation? Should we extend the \nURI persistence practice to fragment identifiers, too? Do &quot;cool&quot; fragment \nidentifiers change? &quot;\n\n&quot;I take the cash value of the URI-Resource unambiguity principle above to \nmean that the representations of the state of a resource retrieved by, say, \nsuccessive HTTP GET&#39;s of the same URI are representations of the state of \nthe *same* resource, no matter how different that state may be.&quot;\n\n\nIn this light, PUT becomes &quot;setting the *representation* of the state of \nthe resource&quot;, DELETE &quot;removing the *representation* of  the state of the \nresource&quot; and POST is &quot;supplying a new *representation* of an as yet \nunidentified resource&quot; or more broadly &quot;supplying a *representation* of \nsome state that may be of interest (directly or indirectly) to the resource \nor at least that the resource can do something with other than setting, \ndeleting or retrieving a representation of the state of itself&quot; !\n\nRobert\n\n[1] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/deviant.html\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\n\n\n"}}
