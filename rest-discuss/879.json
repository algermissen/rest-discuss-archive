My\n&gt; interpretation of REST suggests that in order to PUT to a container,\n&gt; you have to replace the entire state of the container.  So saying\n&gt; &quot;PUT &lt;40000&gt;&quot; to that URI is a mismatch.  It should be &quot;PUT &lt;40000,\n&gt; 40000,40000,40000 ...&gt;&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t see a requirement that the &#39;new&#39; state of a collection have the same\nnumber of application specific records. The collection can be malleable in\nthat it can take a single value and apply it to many managed items - which\nis exactly what that SQL statement does. It doesn&#39;t nuke the records, it\nupdates the values from a single input value. The input value to the SQL\nstatement is not a temp table to be copied - it is a &#39;representation&#39; not a\n&#39;resource&#39;. Of course if PUT requires a &#39;resource&#39; as input, then you&#39;re\nhosed.\n\nIf the collection is defined to be a &#39;view&#39; (as I think DanC said in the IRC\nlog) the reading and writing don&#39;t have to be one-to-one. Of course,\nwrite-back is a bitch for any one-to-many or many-to-one mapping. (as RoyF\nwill find out at his new day job)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
