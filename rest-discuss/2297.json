The APIs look \n&gt; suspiciously alike.\n\nI would say the semantics of the tuples, I would say. I am not sure where\nalong the &quot;stateful&quot; &quot;not stateful&quot; constinuum tuples fall, though. Could\none make sense of a tuple, all on its own? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s\nnecessarily the case. Could one design a tuple format that was\nself-describing (ie, not stateful)? I think so.\n\nS.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; - itdp\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@y..., Paul Prescod &lt;paul@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sam Hunting wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well? What are some use cases where REST should not be used? \n&gt; Since I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d \n&gt; like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know if my use cases falls into this category!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To be honest, probably not. ;) ;(\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s why I say that: REST has its own kind of interaction model, \n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; as tuple spaces do. I think that putting one on top of the other \n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; degrade the benefits of both. It is a little like putting objects \n&gt; in a\n&gt; &gt; relational databases or relations in an object database etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of \n&gt; any)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be very illuminating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds like \n&gt; religious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enthusiasm to me....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that REST is not appropriate for first person shooters \n&gt; (as an\n&gt; &gt; example). Performance would be a huge problem in trying to maintain\n&gt; &gt; REST&#39;s statelessness. Realtime 3D video games cannot even afford to \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &quot;stateless enough&quot; to meet their own security requirements (that&#39;s \n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; the send extra information before it is needed and that informatio \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; used by cheater software).\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
