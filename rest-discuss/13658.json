Where I think\n&gt; \n&gt; Well - under the disguise of a &quot;transaction&quot;, the server is maintaining \n&gt; per-client state.\n\nThere is no per-client state.  A Reservation is interesting to a Travel \nAgent, a Customer, and to an Airline.  A credit or debit is interesting \nto a Credit Card Account and to the Merchant (and to Visa and \nMastercard).Again, &quot;fulfilled&quot; for a reservation and &quot;posted/settled&quot; \nfor a credit or debit are valid non-session-based states.  The fact that \nthese states have a different representation (a tx-document) shouldn&#39;t \nmatter.\n\n\n\n&gt; In stead of answering your question directly, let me \n&gt; ask you whether have you examined the scalability characteristics of \n&gt; your proposed design.\n&gt; \n\nIntegration scenarios many times require coordination between many \nactors.  It should be irrelevant if the client delegates this \ncoordination to a different service.  All a transaction manager does is \nguarantee that something happens, which is hard to implement many times \non a per-application basis.  This is why transaction managers exist.\n\n\n&gt; It may be worthwhile to start from basics, apply each constraint one by \n&gt; one, and whether your approach benefits. The discussion around the kind \n&gt; of resources needed, media types, link rels, link headers vs link \n&gt; elements in some XML format are implementation details. So far, this \n&gt; post does not make a case of why an transactional application should be \n&gt; built the way you propose.\n&gt; \n\nWell, the way is interesting because the actors being coordinated can \nnegotiate with the transaction manager on the exact protocol.  For \nexample, the reservation resource is posted with a &quot;transaction&quot; link. \nThe reservation service can GET that link with an Accept header of the \npreferred transaction formats it desires to interact with.  If the \nreservation service does not know how to interact with the transaction \nrepresentation, it can barf at reservation creation.\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
