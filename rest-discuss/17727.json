So any URI sche=\r\nme would do. For instance http://hostname/organization?id=3D1234 (replace 1=\r\n234 with any ID of your organization resources)\n\nWhat you need is links in =\r\nyour representation. Assume you have a top-organizational unit at the well-=\r\nknown URI http://hostname/organization (no id supplied). At this URI you ge=\r\nt HTML describing that particular organizational unit. Included in the HTML=\r\n you also get links to the related units:\n\n  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://hostname/org=\r\nanization?id=3D5&quot; rel=3D&quot;child&quot;&gt;Unit X&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://hostname/org=\r\nanization?id=3D12&quot; rel=3D&quot;child&quot;&gt;Unit Y&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNow you can let your client br=\r\nowse through your organization chart by following links.\n\nYou can also incl=\r\nude standard HTML forms for searching for units. Here you can have a text i=\r\nnput where someone can enter the organizational path to a unit, and get a U=\r\nRI back that points to the exact unit.\n\nNo need for special URI schemes :-)=\r\n\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;since the taxonomy is subject to change depending on how the or=\r\nganization\n&gt; wants to use the resources how does one design resource uri to=\r\n accommodate\n&gt; the change. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; i am at a loss here. i must confess i spe=\r\nnd very little time &quot;designing\n&gt; URIs.&quot; second, it&#39;s not clear to me how on=\r\ne would &quot;design resource uri to\n&gt; accommodate [the] change.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; it&#39;s also=\r\n not clear to me if you are approaching URIs from the client\n&gt; perspective =\r\n(where URIs should be treated as opaque) or from the server\n&gt; perspective (=\r\nwhere URIs are identifiers that usually power routing code in\n&gt; order to lo=\r\ncate the proper function/content within  private server\n&gt; components and da=\r\nta storage).\n&gt; \n&gt; hopefully someone else on the list can contribute to this=\r\n topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://twitter.com@mamund\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #RESTFest 2011 - Aug 18-20\n&gt; http://r=\r\nestfest.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Sep 6, 2011 at 01:01, Dilip Krishnan &lt;dilip.kri=\r\nshnan@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; seems like your comments are shifting from caching =\r\nand authentication\n&gt; &gt; issues to authorization issues. this stuff is outsid=\r\ne the boundaries of\n&gt; &gt; Fielding&#39;s REST model, but still (to me) interestin=\r\ng. i&#39;ll focus on those\n&gt; &gt; items for now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Guilty as charged :) =\r\n=85 just trying to get all the problems related to\n&gt; &gt; single uri&#39;s having =\r\nmultiple representations and a special case includes\n&gt; &gt; authz as well.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; If i understand your Q here, you&#39;re asking about how servers can map\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; authorization details to content once the request&#39;s identify has been\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; established. I usually employ a rather simple authorization model: the UR=\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; alone. I usually map URIs to protocol actions (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE=\r\n, etc.)\n&gt; &gt; and apply that &quot;permission&quot; to a user identify (or group of the=\r\nm).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; May be it calls for a different thread of discussion but my=\r\n question wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; about how the authorization can be implemented but mor=\r\ne related to uri\n&gt; &gt; design. For example we could have sales by region or s=\r\nales by business\n&gt; &gt; unit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i.e. /cpg/us/tx/sales for cpg sales in u=\r\ns tx\n&gt; &gt; or /us/tx/cpg for cpg sales in us tx\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So my question was, s=\r\nince the taxonomy is subject to change depending on\n&gt; &gt; how the organizatio=\r\nn wants to use the resources how does one design resource\n&gt; &gt; uri to accomm=\r\nodate the change. I believe these should be hypermedia driven\n&gt; &gt; to shield=\r\n the client from changing taxonomies=85 but the convenience and\n&gt; &gt; pragmat=\r\nism of human readable uri&#39;s is compelling from a pragmatic\n&gt; &gt; perspective.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While it is helpful to use URIs that make applying authZ rules eas=\r\ny, that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; a server-side convenience that clients need not know about. O=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; implementation detail side, applying a regexp to a URI works quit=\r\ne well  for\n&gt; &gt; me when checking authZ details. This works with a wide rang=\r\ne of URIs,\n&gt; &gt; whether they have easily discernible patterns or not. keepin=\r\ng the authZ\n&gt; &gt; de-coupled from the actual content *and* using an algorithm=\r\n for checking the\n&gt; &gt; identifiers (URIs) means future modifications to the =\r\n URI name space have a\n&gt; &gt; limited impact on the overall system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =85 which is similar to what we do, but I was wondering if there are othe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; ways people are solving this problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dilip=\r\n Krishnan\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dilip.krishnan@...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
