The URI in a\nPOST request identifies the resourc=\r\ne that will handle the enclosed\nentity. That resource might be a data-accep=\r\nting process, a gateway to\nsome other protocol, or a separate entity that a=\r\nccepts annotations. In\ncontrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the en=\r\ntity enclosed with\nthe request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended=\r\n and the\nserver MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resourc=\r\ne.\nIf the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI,\nit=\r\n MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY\nthen make=\r\n its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the\nrequest.&quot;\n\nAnd t=\r\nhen I was enlightened :)\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n[1] htt=\r\np://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6\n\n\n\nOn 5/5/06, Dav=\r\ne Pawson &lt;dave.pawson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2004/=\r\n12/01/restful-web.html\n&gt; Joe says\n&gt;\n&gt; So if you want to create a new resour=\r\nce, use POST. ..... To update a\n&gt; current resource, use PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The wiki=\r\n says\n&gt;\n&gt; Roughly, PUT means &quot;create&quot; or &quot;replace&quot;, POST means &quot;insert&quot;,\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark Baker,  http://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-=\r\nstate-model-01.txt\n&gt; says\n&gt; POST changes the state relative to the current =\r\n   state,\n&gt; and\n&gt; use the PUT method to explicitly set the state\n&gt;    of th=\r\ne resource to the state represented in the body of the\n&gt;    invocation.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Confusing?
