However, to make claims that failure to use on=\r\nly\n&gt; IANA-registered media-types when implementing a solution that uses the=\r\n\n&gt; HTTP protocol is a &quot;clear-cut violation&quot; of REST is false.\n&gt; \n\nThat is n=\r\not my position.  Please don&#39;t separate my point from its\ncontext -- using H=\r\nTTP over the Internet, i.e. the Web.  If you&#39;re using\nthe Web, there are _n=\r\no_ alternate registries to consider, only IANA.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) In the HTTP spec, t=\r\nhere simply is no requirement that media-types\n&gt; MUST, SHOULD, or even MAY =\r\n(using the language of RFC documents) be\n&gt; registered before they are used.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nHTTP !=3D REST.  HTTP doesn&#39;t require the Content-Type header be sent a=\r\nt\nall -- REST does, to meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint --\nan=\r\nd Roy&#39;s mime-respect w3c note considers it best practice for origin\nservers=\r\n to omit Content-Type when it isn&#39;t definitively known.\n\nHere&#39;s what RFC 26=\r\n16 does say about media type identifier registration:\n\n&quot;Media-type values a=\r\nre registered with the Internet Assigned Number\nAuthority (IANA).  The medi=\r\na type registration process is outlined in\nRFC 1590.  Use of non-registered=\r\n media types is discouraged.&quot;\n\nWhile it&#39;s valid to point out that &quot;discoura=\r\nged&quot; is nonnormative RFC\nlanguage, it&#39;s also valid for me to point out that=\r\n encouraging folks to\ndo exactly as HTTP discourages while dismissing the n=\r\notion that doing\nso has consequences, is bad advice.  It&#39;s also valid for m=\r\ne to point\nout that the language, &quot;ARE REGISTERED WITH IANA,&quot; is unambiguou=\r\ns.\n\nI tend to believe I&#39;m right about this, since my advice is to do\nexactl=\r\ny what HTTP defines an RFC process to govern and encourages folks\nto use.  =\r\nIs there some other, non-theoretical registry in common use on\nthe Web that=\r\n I&#39;m not aware of?  Or some other RFC which extends 2616 to\ndefine an alter=\r\nnate registry?  Or is your position that it&#39;s a bug for\nHTTP not to say, &quot;M=\r\nAY be registered with IANA&quot;?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Fielding&#39;s dissertation lists a number=\r\n of constraints that identify\n&gt; the REST style. Using only media types that=\r\n have been pre-registered\n&gt; with the IANA is not among them.\n&gt; \n\nSelf-descr=\r\niptive messaging is one of the four sub-constraints which\nmake up the unifo=\r\nrm interface constraint:\n\n&quot;In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple=\r\n architectural\nconstraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. =\r\nREST is\ndefined by four interface constraints: identification of resources;=\r\n\nmanipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive\nmessag=\r\nes; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.&quot;\n\nSo I don&#39;t see ho=\r\nw anyone can arrive at a uniform interface unless\ntheir messaging is self-d=\r\nescriptive, which Roy defines as:\n\n&quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is=\r\n registered and the registry\npoints to a specification and the specificatio=\r\nn explains how to process\nthe data according to its intent.&quot;\n\nIs there some=\r\n sort of hulu y&#39;all are dancing around that constraint?\nNobody has provided=\r\n a rational explanation as to how unregistered\nidentifiers, over the Web fo=\r\nr which only the IANA registry is defined,\nconstitutes self-descriptiveness=\r\n.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, =A0this continued focus on some _proof_ that there is a\n&gt; _=\r\nrequirement_ to do so is (to me) a waste of time and a distraction.\n&gt;\n\nHow =\r\nis it any more of a time-wasting distraction than discussing, say,\nthe hype=\r\nrmedia constraint?  I&#39;m waiting for rational proof that this\n*isn&#39;t* a requ=\r\nirement, none has been forthcoming.  The fact that this\nshouldn&#39;t be contro=\r\nversial at all is what keeps me going.  Just provide\nrational proof that it=\r\n&#39;s OK to disregard the self-descriptive messaging\nconstraint and call the r=\r\nesults REST and I&#39;ll shutup...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be far more interesting (to me=\r\n, at least) to discuss the\n&gt; _reason_ behind the advantages of media-type r=\r\negistries for\n&gt; distributed network applications. That is a discussion I&#39;d =\r\nbe more\n&gt; than willing to join.\n&gt; \n\nWe already discussed that at length in =\r\nthis thread.  My terminology is\n&quot;collisions&quot; of media type identifiers.  If=\r\n domain A publishes a spec\nwith the identifier of application/vnd.orders+xm=\r\nl, and domain B\npublishes a different spec with the identifier of applicati=\r\non/vnd.orders\n+xml, and domain C re-uses that identifier, how does anyone o=\r\nperating\nan intermediary on the Web know to which spec domain C is referrin=\r\ng?\n\nIf the answer is to introspect the content and make the determination\nb=\r\ny looking at the schema, then that&#39;s a wrong answer, because that is\nnot wh=\r\nat is meant by self-descriptive messaging.  If the answer is to\nuse search =\r\nservices and some sort of opaque metric to determine whether\ndomain A&#39;s or =\r\ndomain B&#39;s spec is the most popular, then that&#39;s a wrong\nanswer, because se=\r\nlf-descriptive messaging is meant as a solution to\nthat exact problem, also=\r\n.\n\nOTOH, using a registry avoids such collisions, by explicitly\nassociating=\r\n identifiers with data types.  There&#39;s still plenty of room\nfor error in se=\r\nlecting the appropriate identifier, but using opaque\nidentifiers that aren&#39;=\r\nt in IANA over the Web _obviously_ doesn&#39;t even\nbegin to be self-descriptiv=\r\ne, by definition, because it forces either\nintrospection or googling to det=\r\nermine the processing model for the\npayload.\n\nAs with Gopher, or any other =\r\nprotocol with a resource/representation\ndichotomy, being able to associate =\r\nan identifier with a processing\nmodel is the primary requirement of self-de=\r\nscriptiveness.  In order to\ndo this on a publicly-deployed infrastructure l=\r\nike the Web is going to\nrequire some sort of registry to avoid collisions, =\r\nso the constraint\nonly makes sense to me, as does HTTP&#39;s &quot;encouragement&quot; to=\r\n use IANA.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
