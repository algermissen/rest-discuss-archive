Having a \n&gt; specialised message format would breach this constraint by \n&gt; coupling client and server. To avoid this fate, &#39;agnostic&#39; \n&gt; MIME types are required - that is to say, MIME types that can \n&gt; be used generally for the type of application functionality.\n\nFair enough.  As I think through it it seems that REST services may not have\nthe same issues with content negotiation as the open web. In the case of the\nlatter the user is given a URL but can&#39;t get the type they want because\ntheir browser is configured to prioritize another type higher and they don&#39;t\nknow how to get around it.  Or worse, one user sends another a URL and they\nsee different things but the sender is unaware that will happen.  \n\nWeb services strike me as maybe not having those same issues.\n\n&gt; If you were to say &quot;RESTful applications must use this \n&gt; specific MIME type&quot; then I believe that you run the very real \n&gt; risk of &quot;satisfying nobody by trying to please everybody&quot;.\n\nSee the other email I sent that crossed in the email that (I think)\nclarifies my thoughts on that.\n\n&gt; Better to establish a pattern for RESTful MIME types, and \n&gt; then provide formats on as as-needed basis that adhere to \n&gt; that pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, another constraint of REST as set out by Roy is \n&gt; that the client stores session state and that &quot;each request \n&gt; from client to server must contain all the information \n&gt; necessary to understand the request, and cannot take \n&gt; advantage of any stored context on the server.&quot; This begs for \n&gt; a MIME type pattern, imho.\n\nAgreed +1\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s say that a RESTful MIME type for e-commerce baskets had \n&gt; been devised. The client can discover if the server supports \n&gt; said MIME type by simply pinging the server with:\n&gt; \n&gt; -&gt;\n&gt; GET /\n&gt; Accept: application/basket\n&gt; \n&gt; If the server does not support the basket MIME type, it \n&gt; simply responds:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-\n&gt; 406 Not Acceptable\n&gt; \n&gt; If the server does support the basket MIME type, then it \n&gt; could return an empty basket, laden with the hyperlinks to \n&gt; the basket URI-space on the server:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; Content-Type: application/basket\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;basket xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;product href=&quot;/fruit&quot;&gt;Fruit&lt;/product&gt; &lt;/basket&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps illuminate what my thoughts are.\n\nWoohoo!
