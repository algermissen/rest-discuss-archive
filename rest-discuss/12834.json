If an order is accepted, work begins, or\n&gt;&gt; goods are shipped.  I&#39;ve seen it happen in EDI environments with no\n&gt;&gt; transactional controls, and it&#39;s expensive to undo.  Much better to\n&gt;&gt; mark it provisional and only start work once the transaction commits.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, here we go again ;-) Just remember: one size does not fit all ;-)\n\nMy opinion remains the same, but maybe I can explain it better now (or not).\n\nI think at the protocol level (the interactions between coordinator\nand participants) one size can and will fit at least most.\n\nAt the implementation level, e.g. the internal workings of the\nparticipants, many variations will happen.\n\nFor example, I think the same basic coordinator-participant\ninteractions can happen for compensation or provisional-final\npatterns.  The participant can handle the two phases differently.\nDifferent participants in the same transaction can handle them\ndifferently.\n\nBut the value of keeping the interaction protocol uniform is the same\nas the uniform interface constraint in ReST.\n\nI&#39;m not saying it has to be that way, nor that exceptions won&#39;t exist,\njust that a single simple RESTful transaction protocol will get a lot\nmore takeup than a group of battling protocols.\n\nI think another place we disagree is that is partly why I think the\nearlier transaction standardization efforts went into a hole and never\nfound their way out.  Too many variations, too many arcane theoretical\narguments (some of which I participated in, and would like to get\nthose months of my life back...)\n\n"}}
