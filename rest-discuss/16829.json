In REST, implementation details like\nOOP are hidden behind the interface, not exposed to the world.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re more likely, imprecisely, referring to folks that use a\n&gt; JavaBean to XML serialization instead of, for example, ROME for Atom\n&gt; representations - but I&#39;m trying to guess what part confuses you.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not confused.  Stating repeatedly that I *am* confused, is an ad-\nhominem argument.  If you want to enlighten me, that isn&#39;t how to go\nabout it.  I can&#39;t imagine what an object would look like, which\nserializes into an HTML form.  Yeah, you can serialize objects into\nAtom, butt-ugly Atom; but that isn&#39;t the REST paradigm where the\nrepresentation is an interface to the object, not the object itself.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It doesn&#39;t describe an anti-pattern - its simply factually describes\n&gt; how an Object-Oriented language (like Java) does these things.  You\n&gt; seem pretty opinionated on Java frameworks but yet don&#39;t come across\n&gt; as a Java programmer?\n&gt; \n\nNo, I don&#39;t know Java.  But that&#39;s irrelevant to the point I&#39;m making,\nwhich is that JAX-RS contains terminology which has everything to do\nwith Java and nothing to do with REST.  Personally, Java cost my\nproject years, and was a mistake to pursue -- I am not an enterprise.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
