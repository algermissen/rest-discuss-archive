When I said &quot;easy&quot; I meant consist=\r\nent/standard. I acknowledge the\nfact that this is not easy given our curren=\r\nt situation especially in\nBrowersland. I thought I made that clear when I s=\r\naid: &quot;I know what you\nmean especially from an usability perspective given t=\r\nhe current state\nof affairs...&quot;\n\nBut nothing stops us from changing this wh=\r\nen we are designing REST\nbased services.\n\n&gt; In both examples you give, I be=\r\nlieve users want to be able to chose\n&gt; between representations. Most users =\r\ndon&#39;t understand request headers,\n&gt; or how to set their preferences.\n\nAnd t=\r\nhey (users not HTTP clients) shouldn&#39;t have to.\n\nI think there are two ways=\r\n to provide users with the ability to\nparamaterize the request:\n\n1. If ther=\r\ne was someway for the server to tell the client that this\nresource is also =\r\navailable in these other formats then the clients\ncould make this informati=\r\non available to the user using an appropriate\nUI widget. The user in turn w=\r\nould click on the format/language he is\ninterested in using the widget and =\r\nthe client would send a request to\nthe server parameterized by the users ch=\r\noice.\n\nExample:\n\nGET /interview-with-foo\nContent-Type: text/html\nAlt-Conten=\r\nt-Types: application/pdf\n\n\n2. Another way we could let the user parameteriz=\r\ne the request is if we\ncould provide the same info in an attribute of the a=\r\nnchor tag. The\nclient could again make this information available to the us=\r\ner using\nan appropriate UI widget and allow the user to paramaterize the\nre=\r\nquest with a &quot;click&quot; like you want.\n\nExample:\n&lt;a alt-content-type=3D&quot;applic=\r\nation/pdf&quot; href=3D&quot;..\n\nIf I get the time I might try to implement Firefox e=\r\nxtensions for\nthese. But do you guys think this would be the right way to d=\r\no it? The\nonly problems that I can think of is with caches.\n\n\nSandeep Shett=\r\ny\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in\n\n"}}
