See all the voluminous literature on REST vs \n&gt; SOA(P) to back you up on this.\n\nIndeed. In order to teach my grandmother to suck eggs I&#39;ll have a\nlittle rant on the subject if I may. \n\nI am hacking on the python SOAP/WSDL stuff right now and it&#39;s a\nshining example of why that paradigm is so appalling.\n\nProgrammers like SOAP/WSDL because they are told by the tool makers\nthat they can trivially publish and consume their code as webservices\nwithout changing the way they write code.\n\nBut it&#39;s *so* not true. As soon as you want to do something a little\nbit unusual (in my case get at the ws from python) all sorts of things\nstart to break.\n\nProgrammers need to learn you don&#39;t get anything for nothing and that\nit&#39;s better to be honest with your customers and your boss and do the\nthing correctly in the first place.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
