If the server don&#39;t understand multipart/byteranges, it\n&gt; will say 406 Not Acceptable.\n\nIf the server accepts any MIME type for the resource at that URI,\nthen it will try to store the patch as the content of the\nresource. If arbitrary media types are not acceptable, the PUT\nwill probably be rejected. That’s what PUT means.\n\n&gt; It has already been agreed that since all representations\n&gt; are/can be partial on GET, so would representations that are\n&gt; uploaded with PUT often be partial.\n\nSure, but it’s a red herring here. The fact that a client can’t\nfill in all aspects of the resource with a single representation\ndoesn’t mean that it *intends* the missing aspects to be filled\nin from the previous state of the resource; it merely gives the\nserver licence to fill them in appropriately, probably by setting\nthem to some default state, although deriving from some previous\nstate of the resource is also legal.\n\nThe difference between PUT and PATCH is that with the latter, the\nclient is explicitly requesting that the previous state of the\nresource be taken into account, and that the entity body it sends\nis not a (possible) rendition of the resource, but a rendition of\nthe differences between the previous state of the resource and\nthe intended new state.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
