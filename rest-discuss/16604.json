Or, you re-\ndefine self-descriptive to suit your whim...  We&#39;re debating the REST\nconstraint.  HTTP has no self-descriptiveness constraint and neither\ndoes Web architecture.  They define the IANA registry as the only means\nto be self-descriptive, as REST requires.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Its media type is &quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;. There is no entry\n&gt; for this at IANA. There is no IETF RFC for Flash (that I could find).\n&gt; \n\nWhich is but one reason it isn&#39;t RESTful.  I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s\nubiquitous on the Web, so are stateful cookies, it doesn&#39;t make it REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet, somehow, Google can index this media, my browser can load it, and\n&gt; wget can fetch it over HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nNo, your browser can use the identifier to load an extension to read\nit, as with PDF, but this is a library-based API where Flash is\nconcerned.  I&#39;ve never heard of anyone claiming Flash is RESTful before.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you go to the URL in the RFC, it redirects you to a different page\n&gt; that does not contain the PDF specification. Rather it documents the\n&gt; changes Adobe has done to the official ISO PDF specification. The ISO\n&gt; specification is not available on the web, it apparently must be\n&gt; purchased.\n&gt; \n\nISO is an IANA-sanctioned standards body, regardless of the fact that\nthey charge a fee -- you still followed your nose from an identifier to\na spec, without having to decipher the browser&#39;s PDF plugin in order to\ndetermine shared understanding.  That&#39;s the difference between being\nnetwork-based and library-based.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Given all that, Google can index this media, my browser can deliver\n&gt; them, and wget can fetch these.\n&gt; \n\nThe key distinction being that, as a network-based API, this can be\ndone RESTfully with PDF, but not with Flash, which is library-based.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The first application is REST.\n&gt; \n\nIt might be, there are other constraints.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The second application is not REST.\n&gt; \n\nIt can&#39;t be, self-descriptive = registered, and it isn&#39;t registered.\nThat makes it a library-based API, not a network-based API.  Refute the\nnormative definition, don&#39;t just say I&#39;m wrong for following it.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; All here agree to the need to specification, and documentation.\n&gt; \n\nNo.  In REST, participants must agree to a registry which contains the\nmapping from identifier to documentation.  A decision not to use a\nregistry (application/x-shockwave-flash) at all, is a decision not to\nuse REST.  The mapping of application/x-shockwave-flash to *any*\ndocument must be assumed, or deduced via introspection, or searched for,\nwhich is incongruous with declaring an identifier which self-\ndescriptively points to a processing model via registry lookup with no\nambiguity.  It&#39;s a library-based API.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If I were to publish endpoints to a REST system, and a supporting\n&gt; document describing the endpoints and the media types involved, I feel\n&gt; that as long as those specification are openly available, whether from\n&gt; IANAs servers, a published RFC, Adobe, or my own web server, then\n&gt; those media types are descriptive enough to meet the spirit and letter\n&gt; of what the REST style and architecture require. If someone wishes to\n&gt; use my system and the required media types, all of the information is\n&gt; available to them.\n&gt; \n\nThat standpoint requires a non-normative definition of self-descriptive\nwhich doesn&#39;t require registration.  If you want to seriously take that\nposition, you need to falsify the constraint which requires\nregistration.  Because what matters to REST, is that the mapping can be\nunambiguously determined from a registry entry.  It is not the media\ntype that needs to be self-descriptive, it&#39;s the identifier.\n\nXBEL has no identifier.  Creating an identifier for it is easy -- just\nuse one. But, if it isn&#39;t registered, that isn&#39;t self-descriptive, by\nthe normative definition of the term -- there is solid reasoning for\nthis, if you don&#39;t like it, then refute that reasoning with a rational\ncounter-argument, please.  Library-based APIs have nothing to do with\nthe &quot;spirit and intent&quot; of REST, they&#39;re just the opposite.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, that&#39;s my pitch. I completely appreciate the motivations and\n&gt; spirit from which your discussions come from. I am simply going to\n&gt; have to disagree with you on the pedantry with which you apply to this\n&gt; specific point of the REST style.\n&gt; \n\nYou can&#39;t reject my position like that by redefining self-descriptive\nto mean whatever you need it to mean, thesis be damned -- that&#39;s just\nwrong, and it&#39;s unhelpful to anyone&#39;s understanding of REST not to\npoint that out.  Self-descriptive = registered; on the Web, registry =\nIANA.  Refute the definitions, rather than ignoring them with an\nad-hominem argument -- that&#39;s worse than being pedantic.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
