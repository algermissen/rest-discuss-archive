If\nyou want DELETE to delete a collection and all its members, then\ndeleting members directly should be disallowed.  This would be a\nuniform interface, but not, IMO, a generic one.\n\nOr, don&#39;t allow DELETE on a collection resource, unless its members\nhave already been deleted.  Or, use DELETE in a generic-interface\nfashion and assign some other method (EXPUNGE, MDELETE, BDELETE, RMD)\nthe task of deleting all members when a collection is deleted.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To maintain a uniform, generic interface, I would hijack FTP&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; MDELETE method to mean delete all members of a named collection.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s only allowed on collections, not members.  I now have the\n&gt; &gt; expected behavior of DELETE along with its visibility to\n&gt; &gt; intermediaries, without muddling its semantics to also sometimes\n&gt; &gt; mean bulk delete.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As to MDELETE, in a REST API as opposed to FTP, it would only accept\n&gt; &gt; the target URI, not a list of URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that this would be perfectly RESTful.  It would also be\n&gt; RESTful to define a class of resources (identified via a MIME type of\n&gt; course) that aggregated other resources, and which guaranteed that\n&gt; they would go away when the primary resource goes away.  (This might\n&gt; or might not be a good design -- it&#39;s hard to argue in the abstract\n&gt; -- but it wouldn&#39;t violate REST.)\n&gt; \n\nI disagree about using media types to change method semantics for a\nclass of resources -- the goal is &quot;a consistent set of semantics for\nall resources&quot;.  Media types aren&#39;t meant as contracts.  The protocol\ndefines the method semantics for all media types; in HTTP, DELETE isn&#39;t\nguaranteed even if the response indicates success, regardless of media\ntype or API design.\n\nIf an API defines MDELETE to delete all members of a collection, then\nthe MDELETE method should be restricted to only those resources where\nit makes sense.  Say, for example, a &#39;trashcan&#39; resource would &#39;Allow:\nGET, POST, MDELETE&#39; but would respond &#39;405 Method Not Allowed&#39; to a\nDELETE request.\n\nAn archive collection used as the basis of site navigation, i.e. \n/weblog/2009/april, would &#39;Allow: GET, POST&#39; while a collection that&#39;s\na stored search for a tag would &#39;Allow: GET, DELETE&#39;, while a temporary\narchive created for the purpose of batch deletion would &#39;Allow: GET,\nDELETE, MDELETE&#39; where members are first removed via MDELETE, then the\ncollection resource itself is removed via DELETE.\n\n(If a DELETE is tried on the last resource class before its members\nhave been either DELETEd or MDELETEd, the response would be 409\nConflict.)\n\nThose different classes of collection resource have the same method\nsemantics regardless of media type, which could be all the same, or\ndifferent for each class, doesn&#39;t matter -- it&#39;s orthogonal to the\nprotocol behavior of such an API.  What methods may be applied to what\nresources is defined in documentation, and made visible through OPTIONS\nrequests and HEAS, not media types.\n\nParticularly since those collection resources may already have multiple\nmedia types, say &#39;text/html&#39; and &#39;application/xhtml+xml&#39; and\n&#39;application/atom+xml&#39; configured with content negotiation.  To single\nsome of those out as MDELETE-able collections by adding a parameter is\nsomething I&#39;ve seen suggested often, but it&#39;s really overloading the\npurpose of media types and making for much trickier implementation than\nOPTIONS + Allow.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
