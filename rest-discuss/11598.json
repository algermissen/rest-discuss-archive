Instead, one can augment the Atom definition to\n&gt;&gt; convey the extra information.\n&gt;\n&gt; * Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; [2008-11-13 20:45]:\n&gt;&gt; Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a. If the data is mostly content like HTML, use atom:content\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to carry that HTML, and then extend the atom:entry element\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with additional metadata. An example of such metadata could\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be location info.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; b. If the data is not content-like, use the entry like a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; payload format with atom:content containing the data.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; c. Add foreign markup extensions under atom:entry.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a dangerous path. One of the problems with RSS that led\n&gt; to the Atom effort is that it has no facilities for transporting\n&gt; any data other than textual content, so everything gets shoved\n&gt; into extension elements, so every application needs to extend RSS\n&gt; in its own private new way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Atom was meant to break away from that mess, not reintroduce it.\n&gt; That&#39;s what the addition of @type to atom:content and the careful\n&gt; deliberation about the content model in general was all about.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would suggest strongly that Atom should only be augmented with\n&gt; extension elements for protocol purposes, as in AtomPub. The data\n&gt; contained in an entry should remain largely intact when detached\n&gt; from the envelope. This pretty much necessitates the use of\n&gt; atom:content.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, Steve, you are very correct to say that introducing a new\n&gt; hypermedia media type is costly (at least if you mean to do it on\n&gt; a non-local level). But I think you are drawing the wrong\n&gt; conclusion from it.\n\nAristotle-\n\nAlthough I agree in principle, I have found in practice (and perhaps\nmy situation is unique, but I doubt it....), that the most\nstraightforward way to add what are essential arbitrary key-value\npairs to an atom entry was to use the simple extension mechanism under\natom:entry.  I had been using a XHTML (xoxo) in atom:content, but it\nadded what felt like needless work on both end of the wire (which I\ncontrol, and yes, it makes these extensions useless to other systems\nthat do not know about it).  Ultimately, I simply decided to do what\nGoogle did with their spreadsheets feeds, as I assume that&#39;ll be the\nmost widely implemented example of abitrary key-value pairs (column\nname =&gt; cell value) in Atom.\n\ne.g.:\n&lt;entry xmlns:gsx=&quot;http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006/extended&quot;&gt;\n...\n    &lt;gsx:type&gt;Question&lt;/gsx:type&gt;\n    &lt;gsx:eid&gt;abcde&lt;/gsx:eid&gt;\n    &lt;gsx:name&gt;John smith&lt;/gsx:name&gt;\n    &lt;gsx:text&gt;how big is the ocean?&lt;/gsx:text&gt;\n&lt;/entry&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve been tempted to go ahead and use the same namespace as Google,\nbut haven&#39;t yet.  We do quite a lot of interaction with data from\nGoogle Spreadsheets anyway, and that might make sense.\n\nI&#39;d be curious to know you or anyone&#39;s thoughts on the wisdom (or lack\ntheir of) of Google&#39;s approach.\n\n--peter keane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of diminishing the role of atom:content and finding a\n&gt; way to auxiliary facilities of Atom fit the data, the right way\n&gt; of dealing with the problem would be to find a way to make one\n&gt; of the range of available hypermedia media types fit the data. I\n&gt; think people dismiss XHTML far too easily because they consider\n&gt; it somehow presentational, f.ex., or not structured enough,\n&gt; whatever that may mean. RDF has an inexplicably bad reputation,\n&gt; as well. There are a lot of good existing choices once you get\n&gt; over the idea that your domain is a unique and precious\n&gt; snowflake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
