Your client\n&gt; &gt; may not know or cannot use one protoco=\r\nl, or you resource semantics are a\n&gt; &gt; perfect fit for one particular proto=\r\ncol, any other combination of protocols\n&gt; &gt; may require mapping. Thus, you =\r\ncreate one resource definition for one\n&gt; &gt; protocol,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  No, no, I di=\r\nd nothing of that. The resources (that are all instances of a\n&gt; single Reso=\r\nurce) know nothing about any protocol. I did no such thing\n&gt; as&quot;create one =\r\nresource definition for one protocol&quot;. The only &quot;protocol&quot; the\n&gt; resource k=\r\nnows about it&#39;s my architecture or application specific protocol\n&gt; that hap=\r\npens to follow HTTP protocol (GET...) but *only* for convenience. I\n&gt; could=\r\n define that also as FETCH, ATACK, KILL, or something like XPTA, XPTB,\n&gt; XP=\r\nTC.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and the create adapters for other clients using other protoco=\r\nls.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I also did no such thing as &quot;create adapters for other client=\r\ns using other\n&gt; protocols&quot;. I created Server-Side Connectors, that are a ar=\r\nchitecture\n&gt; component, that are independent of one another, for each proto=\r\ncol supoorted.\n&gt; I did *not* create a adaptor to adapt JMS to HTTP for inst=\r\nance. All the\n&gt; connectors are at the same level, the HTTP one is at the sa=\r\nme level as the\n&gt; JMS one. They don&#39;t communicate with each other, they don=\r\n;t even know each\n&gt; other exists. Each one communicate only with the Resour=\r\nce. I could drop the\n&gt; HTTP connector and the application will continue to =\r\nwork only with JMS, for\n&gt; example.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is a great idea, but be clea=\r\nr on a couple of things:\n&gt; &gt; 1. The REST API ends in the main protocol. The=\r\n adapter layer is not part of\n&gt; &gt; API. The direct clients of the REST api a=\r\nre the adapters.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; As exposed I don&#39;t have a main protocol and I don&#39;t =\r\nhave adapters, I have\n&gt; connectors  that are a architecture component and s=\r\no are part of the\n&gt; Architecture. I don&#39;t quite understand what you mean &quot;T=\r\nhe REST API ends in\n&gt; the main protocol.&quot; - but then again I don;t even kno=\r\nw the exact meaning of\n&gt; REST API :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. You may be introducing much =\r\nimpedance mismatch since the protocol\n&gt; &gt; semantics are sooo different. Or =\r\nyou are just tweaking the semantics of the\n&gt; &gt; secondary protocol to mean s=\r\nomething different, which is possible but may\n&gt; &gt; not be as good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhere is no secondary protocol, so all protocols made the same kind of\n&gt; &quot;ad=\r\naptation&quot; between the transport protocol interface and my application\n&gt; int=\r\nerface... Not only the Verb but the headers, parameters and other data\n&gt; an=\r\nd metadata in the message.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this clarifies, but this should be pro=\r\nbably another thread?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
