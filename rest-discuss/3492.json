Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@v...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a general matter, would you want to PUT a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MSWord6 document and GET a MSWord7 document?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not if I couldn&#39;t read it with MSWord6.  Any of the items listed\n&gt; &gt; above all fall under &quot;can I use the GET version exactly like I use\n&gt; &gt; the PUT version?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure why everybody thinks PUT is so limited and worse, why\n&gt; everybody thinks that GET must return _exactly_ what was previously\n&gt; PUT&#39;ted. Again, like all the HTTP verbs, the server gets to\n&gt; **_interpret_** the body of the PUT request however it wants. It does\n&gt; not have to be a byte-for-byte copy (particularly since this reduces\n&gt; the server to just a plain old fileserver). Further, the body of a PUT\n&gt; is a _representation_ of a resource and representations are logical\n&gt; constructs which can be serialized to many different byte format and\n&gt; encoding schemes. \n\nDoes this imply, then, that whenever a client issues a successful PUT\nrequest, that the client should immediately perform a GET of that\nrequest (or whatever uri was given in a Location header) if it wants to\ndo any further processing of that resource?\n\n(I seem to remember some discussion of this a couple of months back, but\nI don&#39;t think it was ever resolved)\n\n\n&gt; Also, I really don&#39;t think PUT should be used for resource creation.\n&gt; This is not only because PUT is idempotent and resource creation is\n&gt; usually a violent process full of side effects that it&#39;s not\n&gt; idempotent. Further, it&#39;s been my experience, that using PUT in this\n&gt; way just leads to all types of ambiguity and sutle bugs because\n&gt; neither the server or the client really know what&#39;s going on and it&#39;s\n&gt; always unclear whether a resource is being created or simply updated.  \n\nThat is why there is a difference between a 201 Created status code and\na 200 OK.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;m all for using PUT to create resources, and creating\nenvironments where that sort of thing _is_ idempotent. After all, that\nis how it is supposed to be.\n\n\n(2 cents later)\n\nIan Clelland\n&lt;ian@...&gt;\n\n"}}
