As for\nthis entry, I feel that some of the observations are either over-simplified\nor plain wrong.  It&#39;s hard to agree with all of the blogger&#39;s conclusions\nwhen it&#39;s based on somewhat flimsy arguments.\n\nHowever, I do agree with the basic theme of the blog.  Using URIs and\ndocuments to form a digital identity makes more sense than going the MS\nPassport way.  At one level this is a description of the Web itself.  I have\na URI (http://www.seairth.com) which identifies documents which start to\ngive a rough idea of who I am.  This is true also for\nhttp://www.microsoft.com and http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/.\n\n\nAlso, for those who are not aware of it, Thawte as the Web of Trust[1],\nwhich is a a bottom-up certificate authority (CA) system.  Using SSL and the\nWOT, a certain portion of this bottom-up REST-oriented digital identity\nproblem could be solved.  I&#39;m not saying this is the solution to all of the\nproblems, just that there *are* others out there already attacking the\nproblem in a similar manner.\n\n[1] http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/wot/index.html\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
