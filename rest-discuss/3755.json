The server returns an HTTP\n&gt; &gt; Authentication challenge...\n&gt;\n&gt; I am the &quot;OP&quot; and I am surprised how my original question turned\n&gt; into this long conversation :-)\n\nYeah, that tends to happen here.  :)\n\n&gt; I was just asking how to solve a CGI programming problem with Python\n&gt; in a RESTful way!\n&gt;\n&gt; I can not do HTTP authentication from a Python CGI script, can I?  I\n&gt; tried to look for examples or to figure it out but I have been\n&gt; unsuccessful.  And then somebody explained to me that HTTP auth. is\n&gt; not used by banks etc. on the internet, because it is not secure\n&gt; enough.  For my civilization like game HTTP auth. could be secure\n&gt; enough, but oh well, I don&#39;t know how to implement it from a CGI\n&gt; script anyway.\n\nAssuming that all banks use HTTPS, HTTP Auth no less secure than the use of\na session cookie.  The main reason that it&#39;s not used (I suspect) is that\nthe banks cannot control the look of the dialog box.  Another possbility is\nthat banks (wrongly) believe that HTTP Auth is less secure because it passes\nplaintext user/pwd in every request.  But this is no less true of passing\nthe user/pwd from an HTML form.  The security is in the use of HTTPS.\nCertainly, using HTTP Digest Auth (as opposed to Basic) would protect the\npassword, but the extra measure is pointless if using HTTPS.\n\nOne advantage to HTTP Auth (as opposed to an HTML form) is that you can\npotentially access any resource in a collection directly instead of going to\na single &quot;entrypoint&quot;.  As to whether you can handle HTTP Basic or Digest\nAuth through Python CGI, I don&#39;t really know.  If you have access to all of\nthe HTTP request headers, then I&#39;d think you should be able to manually\nimplement it.  Though it may be necessary to be running a SAPI module\ninstead of a CGI program...\n\n&gt; So I was thinking about setting up the &quot;login&quot; page with HTTPS and\n&gt; this then calls a CGI script generating a &quot;sessionID&quot; passed along\n&gt; with HIDDEN HTML FORM parameters on every next page, and then all\n&gt; the next pages don&#39;t need SSL.  The nice thing for me is then that I\n&gt; don&#39;t have to change source code when the SSL part is turned on\n&gt; later.  I can develop it using Apache on my laptop (without SSL).\n&gt; Or is there a more RESTful way to do it?\n\nThis technique would be no better than using a session cookie, in my\nopinion, and a whole lot more work (how would you handle GET requests?).\nPlacing the sessionID in the URL&#39;s query string would be another way to go.\nOf course, there are a good number of opinions go around about what is the\nright or wrong way of doing this and it is a far from settled topic.\n\nAs for the original topic, could you give a slightly more detailed example\nwho can and cannot access cities, what access is allowed in those cases, and\nhow you are currently doing it (or planning on doing it)?\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
