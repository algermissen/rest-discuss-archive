YMMV.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve found it&#39;s a valuable means to explain REST to people with an\n&gt; RPC/Web services background: in a WS-* scenario, you have a fixed\n&gt; number of &quot;endpoint&quot; URLs, a variable number of data formats, and a\n&gt; variable number of interfaces. In REST, you have n resource URLs, n\n&gt; data formats, and a fixed number (i.e., 1) interface. It just helps\n&gt; to explain that there is nothing you can express using a WS/RPC\n&gt; approach that you can&#39;t express with a RESTful architecture as well -\n&gt; you just vary two of three parameters in both cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m aware of the fact that it&#39;s not really correct (as resource URLs\n&gt; are not supposed to identify &quot;command processors&quot;), but it serves its\n&gt; purpose.\n\nSomething similar. I find to get things going, you can tell people that \nresources are just like objects, but they have tightly controlled \ninterfaces. That&#39;s because you don&#39;t know who your callers are going to \nbe, and you have little say in when they upgrade, so revving the API \nlater on is tough. Then I tell them what&#39;s wrong by design with many \nexposed web systems and frameworks today is that they put all the \nobjects behind manager and controller classes, which inevitably \nintroduces problems. People with a grasp of OOAD or domain specific \nmodeling can follow that argument.\n\nThe hard bit then is persuading people not to pretend the client and \nserver code are in the same address space when it comes to programming \nor you&#39;ll unintentionally couple the client and server. [As a result \npart of me thinks that JSR311 not necessarily providing a client API is \na good thing.] But this is just repeating Steve Loughran&#39;s point that \nlots of people do not wanting to do distributed programming, when you \nget right down to it.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
