And isn&#39;t this about where we left off lo those\nmany years ago?\n\n(By the way, I&#39;m not actually pushing BTP here, only the\nprovisional-final model for RESTful transactions, which I think could\nbe a lot simpler than BTP.  And I do think it is not only possible but\nsometimes necessary to do something that would look a lot like\ntransactions in a RESTful environment.)\n\n&gt; The compensating transaction model in the reference Bill sent round is what\n&gt; you&#39;re looking for I think (cf atoms in BTP).\n\nI don&#39;t see much detail about compensation in the reference Bill sent,\nunless I missed something.\n\nIt says:\n&lt;excerpt&gt;\nThe two proposals are:\n   1. classic transactions obeying ACID properties;\n   2. compensation based transactions avoiding the need to lock\nresources for extended periods of time.\n\nApproach 1 is discussed in depth whilst the second will be covered in\na subsequent wiki.\n&lt;/excerpt&gt;\n\nMy understand of compensation is that it is a do-undo model, where the\nparticipants actually do the work in Phase 1, and then undo it in\nPhase 2 if the transaction aborts.\n\nProvisional-Final is a do provisionally, and then do finally model,\nwhere the participants do the work provisionally in Phase 1, and then\nfinalize it (or cancel it) in Phase 2.\n\nIn an protocol sense, I think the decision of which of those\napproaches to use could be left up to the participants, but if we&#39;re\ntalking Java implementation details, we probably need to make the\napproaches explicit.\n\nI&#39;m familiar with problems in compensation from working in fast-paced\nmanufacturing environments.  If an order is accepted, work begins, or\ngoods are shipped.  I&#39;ve seen it happen in EDI environments with no\ntransactional controls, and it&#39;s expensive to undo.  Much better to\nmark it provisional and only start work once the transaction commits.\n\n"}}
