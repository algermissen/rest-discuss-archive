URIs are how you\n&gt; identify resources in a REST/HTTP system. It is per=\r\nfectly reasonable\n&gt; for clients want/need to store references so some resou=\r\nrces. A\n&gt; clients that does so needs to understand redirections when\n&gt; dere=\r\nferencing stored URIs, though.\n\nI didn&#39;t say it was unRESTful.
