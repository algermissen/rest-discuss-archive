How would this prevent your =\r\napproach from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; working?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There exists a separation of c=\r\noncerns between client and server in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Web architecture and in REST. =A0=\r\nAnother example is URI fragments.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0Your question could just as easil=\r\ny be, &quot;Why can&#39;t we change the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Web such that clients send URI fragment=\r\ns to servers?&quot; =A0Because all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; existing content was written based on th=\r\ne layered-system\n&gt;&gt; &gt; constraint, when it comes to things like URI fragment=\r\ns and @type.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0When you change the semantics of existing markup, the =\r\nexisting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; markup (and there&#39;s an awful lot of it on the Web) can&#39;t be\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; expected _not_ to break because of that paradigm shift, can it?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Aside from what would break, changing @type introduces a coupling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; b=\r\netween client and server which goes against the layered-system\n&gt;&gt; &gt; constra=\r\nint. =A0Solving problems by violating REST constraints is not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how I op=\r\nerate. =A0Building coupled systems, or being forced to build\n&gt;&gt; &gt; coupled s=\r\nystems if this change is forced through, is what I seek to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried to follow this thread as best I can, but I don&#39;t see the\n&gt;&gt; co=\r\nupling. =A0I thought the @type was simply a hint from the server to\n&gt;&gt; the =\r\nclient about what representation is available at the other end.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;=\r\nre exactly right. =A0I&#39;m saying that changing the semantics of @type\n&gt; from=\r\n annotation to instruction, introduces coupling.\n\nAh, I missed the distinct=\r\nion, thanks.  I don&#39;t see how its necessarily\nharmful though.  I mean, if I=\r\n&#39;ve got two representations of a given\nresource and I give you links to bot=\r\nh - it seems to me the result will\nbe the same whether you used a @type att=\r\nribute to populate your Accept\nheader or used your own quality-based Accept=\r\n header.  For example, if\nI give you a link to &lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot; type=3D&quot;text=\r\n/html&quot; - wouldn&#39;t the\nresult would be the same whether it&#39;s a hint or instr=\r\nuctive?\n\n&gt;&gt; The server could have:\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a rel=3Dnext type=3Dtext/html href=\r\n=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Search Me&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a rel=3Dnext type=3Dapplication/atom+xml href=3D=\r\n&quot;...&quot;&gt;Search Me&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, it would be more RESTful for a representat=\r\nion to use as rel=3D\n&gt; &#39;next&#39; the same media type as itself. =A0Then, make =\r\na list of rel=3D\n&gt; &#39;alternate&#39; links for each negotiated representation,\n\nI=\r\n think either of these lives within the constraints of REST - it\nseems more=\r\n of a discussion about good media type design than\nRESTfulness to me.  The =\r\nlink relations aren&#39;t exclusive though, so\nperhaps:\n\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;next&quot; type=\r\n=3D&quot;text/html&quot; href=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Search Me&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;next alternate&quot; type=3D=\r\n&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; href=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Search Me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&gt; ...  with separate\n&gt; U=\r\nRIs, and give their @types, so you&#39;re responding with the most optimal\n&gt; re=\r\npresentation first, then allowing the user agent to recover, instead\n&gt; of m=\r\naking the user agent pre-negotiate rel=3D&#39;next&#39;.\n\nWhy separate URIs?  If it=\r\n weren&#39;t for some UAs having mostly static\nAccept headers, my preference wo=\r\nuld firmly be for the same URI and the\n@type only used as a hint for the UA=\r\n to perhaps adjust Accept header.\nYou&#39;re saying this for practical reasons =\r\nof UA behavior?\n\n&gt;&gt; In this case, @type is simply used as link selection cr=\r\niteria in\n&gt;&gt; concert with @rel. =A0The URI may or may not be exactly the sa=\r\nme.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly. =A0Although in practice, where the URI is the same for =\r\na list of\n&gt; alternates, user agents won&#39;t see it that way. =A0For example, =\r\nbrowsers\n&gt; have no problem displaying a feed icon in the presence of a link=\r\n rel=3D\n&gt; &#39;alternate&#39; with type=3D&#39;application/atom+xml&#39;, provided that the=\r\n href\n&gt; isn&#39;t the same as the request URI for the current application state=\r\n.\n\nDidn&#39;t know that, I was more thinking of the static Accept header\nlimita=\r\ntion of UAs not this, but that&#39;s interesting.\n\n&gt; So assigning URIs to varia=\r\nnts not only clears things up for caches, but\n&gt; for browsers as well.\n\nJust=\r\n when I thought I got it.  It seems to me, we should promote\nfixing the UAs=\r\n rather than assigning URIs to each representation.  On\nthis list, sometime=\r\ns it&#39;s tough for me to determine whether folks are\narguing a particular pos=\r\nition because of the merits of the idea or\nbecause of the practical conditi=\r\nons of existing, running software in\nthe wild.  In this case, on a practica=\r\nl note, I agree that this is\nwhat we&#39;re stuck with but would you agree that=\r\n the ideal is to fix the\nsource (e.g. UAs)?  That&#39;s my interpretation of se=\r\nction 5.2.1.1 too:\n\n&quot;This abstract definition of a resource enables key fea=\r\ntures of the\nWeb architecture. First, it provides generality by encompassin=\r\ng many\nsources of information without artificially distinguishing them by\nt=\r\nype or implementation. Second, it allows late binding of the\nreference to a=\r\n representation, enabling content negotiation to take\nplace based on charac=\r\nteristics of the request. Finally, it allows an\nauthor to reference the con=\r\ncept rather than some singular\nrepresentation of that concept, thus removin=\r\ng the need to change all\nexisting links whenever the representation changes=\r\n (assuming the\nauthor used the right identifier).&quot;\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n"}}
