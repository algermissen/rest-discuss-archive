There are no blackb=\r\noxes;\n&gt; &gt; just mathematical reasoning.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure I want to touch t=\r\nhis one with a 30 foot pole but ...\n\n\nAt this point, I am just sort of foll=\r\nowing the discussion.\n\nI am a little in awe.  I can&#39;t even comprehend where=\r\n it&#39;s going or where it&#39;s coming from.\n\nI guess nobody bothers to wonder th=\r\nat.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s interesting and all, but I&#39;m specifically try=\r\ning to tell you, &quot;Are you asking the right questions?&quot;  And it looks like t=\r\nhe replies you are getting don&#39;t care whether you are asking the right ques=\r\ntions.  Instead, they want to discuss REST, which is only fair, considering=\r\n your audience is here to discuss REST.\n\nSo your audience is here for REST,=\r\n but you are starting this thread in essence to ask a more general question=\r\n (IMHO).\n\n\n&gt; Do CEO&#39;s need access to *any* aspect of the system or those wi=\r\nth\n&gt; business value? More often than not what your CEO is interested in is\n=\r\n&gt; not your transactional objects but roll ups etc and analysis performed\n&gt; =\r\nupon them. I understand the argument for OLAP but using this as an\n&gt; argume=\r\nnt for REST seems to me to be like using the fact that they\n&gt; where skates =\r\nas an argument for why I should watch tennis.\n\n\nFirst off, I _wish_ tennis =\r\nplayers had to wear skates, but Rafael Nadal would protest if his edge on c=\r\nlay was taken away. :)\n\nSecond, the only argument I use for REST is continu=\r\nous deployment.  Hypermedia naturally models this.  All the other stuff abo=\r\nut REST is simply a checklist of &quot;Are we programming with our pants down?&quot; =\r\nthings Roy Fielding came up with to ensure we buckle our pants around our w=\r\naist.\n\nAbout my CEO: he used to be a nuclear reactor engineer in the Navy. =\r\n This might surprise you, but our non-technical people have influenced the =\r\narchitecture where I work just as much as the technical people.  In fact, s=\r\nome of our best design decisions were pushed by non-programmers.  The techn=\r\nical people still built the infrastructure, but the non-technical people po=\r\ninted out some silly inefficiencies in the way we were doing certain things=\r\n.  The way we do multi-tenancy, for instance, was pushed by a former market=\r\ning guy.\n\nSometimes people who don&#39;t do tech for a living can have a better=\r\n understanding of a deep, technical subject area than the tech guy.  Ever h=\r\neard of Con Kolivas?  He is the guy who has basically revolutionized the de=\r\nsign of operating system schedulers, with his Staircase Deadline scheduler.=\r\n  Know what he does for a living?  Anesthesiologist.  He actually wrote bet=\r\nter C code than a professional, highly trained C programmer, _without_ _kno=\r\nwing_ _C_.  I am serious.\n\nMy major point here is that your push back that =\r\n&quot;this is what a CEO should be doing&quot; is fuzzy thinking.   Being wrong is ac=\r\nceptable, so long as your thinking is concrete.  You could be right, even, =\r\nbut not with the line of reasoning you provided.\n\n\n&gt; Beyond that for a tran=\r\nsactional system there is still a &quot;black box&quot; in\n&gt; terms of how data affect=\r\ns other data. Consider an example of a\n&gt; resource that tells me sales for t=\r\nhe day and a resource that accepts\n&gt; sales. There is a direct link between =\r\nthese two that may or may not be\n&gt; exposed.\n\n\nWell, you can use a complex e=\r\nvent processor to define a virtual event.  However, I don&#39;t think that is t=\r\nhe real money sink effecting most Fortune 500 companies today.  I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne nearly enough experience to say for sure, but I read a piece today off Mi=\r\nchael Feathers&#39; twitter (thanks to Colin Jack retweeting it) about American=\r\n Airlines.  http://dustincurtis.com/dear_dustin_curtis.html  That letter pr=\r\netty much exemplifies the sort of process problems that seem to swarm large=\r\n institutions.  Whenever my consultant friends describe their latest &quot;work =\r\nof art&quot; they&#39;re brought in to &quot;restore&quot;, it sounds a lot like AA-style prob=\r\nlems.  And you know what?  I feel for that guy at AA.  I would never sugges=\r\nt software as the solution, since its a technical solution for a non-techni=\r\ncal problem.  However, there is a reason why companies like iRise make ENOR=\r\nMOUS profits helping people improve their technical workflow between the so=\r\nrt of 200 person division with multiple sub departments like at AA.\n\n\n\n&gt; BT=\r\nW the solutions I use are fairly far from imperative. Currently I am\n&gt; usin=\r\ng what would be categorized as MEST (yes there can be argument if\n&gt; MEST is=\r\n just the new buzzword for messaging). I have lately been using\n&gt; resources=\r\n on my read side and messaging on my transactional side. I\n&gt; have attempted=\r\n at using REST more completely but am running into the\n&gt; fact that it just =\r\ndoesn&#39;t seem to make any sense whatsoever in a\n&gt; complex transactional situ=\r\nation.\n\n\nOk, you are &quot;far from imperative&quot;, but are you completely self-des=\r\ncribing and referentially transparent?  It sounds to me like you want this =\r\nin your system, but are struggling with how?\n\nIn the example you give above=\r\n, you are talking solely in terms of physical implementation characteristic=\r\ns.  Even an OLAP cube is an implementation detail!  When we&#39;re talking at t=\r\nhis level, be clear that _today_ what most companies do is have _human tech=\r\nnical people_ do the work of _compilers_.  Choosing to analyze things with =\r\na cube is an implementation detail that really ought to be solved by a comp=\r\niler.\n\nYou also sort of sidestepped my comment on using guards.  A guard is=\r\n in its essence an imperative construct, because it effectively defines WHE=\r\nN something should occur... rather than simply THAT something should occur.=\r\n  Again, hard distinction between &quot;do&quot; and &quot;be&quot;.  Once you have something t=\r\nhat simply &quot;is&quot;, you have basically decoupled syntax from semantics as much=\r\n as possible.\n\n\n"}}
