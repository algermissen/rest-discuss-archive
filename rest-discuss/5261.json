However HTTP\nhas one thing MOMs don&#39;t have, and that is a standardized wire protocol. If\nyou don&#39;t have a widely adopted wire protocol, then you won&#39;t interoperate\nwith many others, and the value of designing using REST constraints is\nlower.\n\nXMPP + queues could change that.\n\nYou could say that SOAP/WS got the wire protocol standardized, but omitted\nthe application constraints. REST over MOM gets the application constraints,\nbut has the wire protocol interop problem. \n\nREST constraints over XMPP/queues/pubsub?
