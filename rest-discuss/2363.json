You shouldn&#39;t need to timeout if you&#39;re\ndoing things statelessly, because the server doesn&#39;t have to remember\nanything; all you need to know about authorization is in the request.\n\n&gt; &gt; What if you had a personal proxy which refreshed URIs for you, as\n&gt; &gt; personal proxies are allowed to do?  If you&#39;ve got a bunch of queries,\n&gt; &gt; each with their own URI, this proxy may use up a sizable amount of\n&gt; \n&gt; Yikes.  Well that certainly changes things...  But, what if the resources\n&gt; were marked &quot;no-cache&quot;?\n\nThat&#39;s worse!  It will mean that more GETs will have to happen, because\nthe responses from the old ones aren&#39;t any good any longer. 8-O\n\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback,\n\nNo problem.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
