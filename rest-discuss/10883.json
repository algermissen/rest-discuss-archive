It would mean the\n&gt; request is accepted, but to be done later on, not that it\n&gt; requires further intervention.\n\nOh. You are right. I hadn’t thought that through. 202 implies\nthat the server may later successfully perform the requested\noperation on its own, which is not what it would really mean\nin Eric’s confirmation protocol really. What he wants to say\nis “I won’t fulfill that request unless you prove to me that\nyou meant it.”\n\n&gt; There isn&#39;t a good mapping for this. 403 Forbidden (which I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen used for terms and conditions) comes to mind as an option,\n&gt; or maybe 409 with instructions.\n\nBased on my phrasing above, 403 is in fact the right status code,\nthough it cannot convey the precise meaning. 409 requires a lot\nof squiting to make it work in this case.\n\n(I have used 403 in place of 401 for sending back an auth form\nin the body in cases where HTTP Auth was not acceptable, btw.)\n\nThanks for your reply!\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
