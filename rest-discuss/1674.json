As ISO says, you&#39;re not just \nexchanging data, you&#39;re making business commitments.\n\nRohit Khare had an interesting diagram in his recent Soap Routing \nslide show where he added two layers on top the application protocol:\nLayer 8 - Economic (which is where business commitments cd go)\nLayer 9 - Political.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
