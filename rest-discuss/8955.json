So I clicked on http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html to\nread more and, perhaps not surprisingly, found that it&#39;s pretty broken\nREST.\n\nAdding a message to the queue seems fine... they give as an example\na queue at http://www.acme.com/queue/orders/input and you can add a\nnew message in the queue by POSTing to that URL. Fine.\n\nConsuming a message from the queue, though, seems problematic.\nThey allow either GET or DELETE on the *same* URL to pop a message\nfrom the queue.\n\nThey are aware that this is wrong:\n&quot;Note that strict REST requires that GET be a read only operation; so\nstrictly speaking we should not use GET to allow folks to consume\nmessages. Though we allow this as it simplifies HTTP/DHTML/Ajax\nintegration somewhat.&quot;\n\n... but they don&#39;t seem to understand *how* wrong it is:\n\n* it&#39;s not REST that says GET is a read-only operation; it&#39;s HTTP.  So\ntheir HTTP implementation is broken. Sadly seems to be pretty common.\n\n* DELETE on a URL representing a queue means you want to delete the\n  entire queue, not a single message!\n\nThe reason I&#39;m writing to this list is that I thought it was an\ninteresting case and I couldn&#39;t immediately think of better solution.\nHas anybody thought of a good way to model a queue?\n\nYou could of course do a GET on the queue, returning a list of\navailable messages, then DELETE one of those - but that leads to\nconcurrency problems.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
