What is Coke?  Not=\r\n Pepsi!\n\nWith that idea, I give you the REST taste test, by giving you the =\r\nchance to taste a recently proposed &quot;thin server&quot; architecture and tell me =\r\nif it tastes like REST to you:\n\nhttp://z-bo.tumblr.com/post/246854981/what-=\r\nis-sofea-what-is-soui\n\n\nPlease note that it might be months before I post h=\r\nere again.
