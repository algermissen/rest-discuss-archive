Authentication is usually achieved in HTTP/1.1 using headers and is\n&gt; thus superficially similar to the content-negotiation case. So you\n&gt; could filter content based on user and still claim RESTfulness.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some more subtle issues regarding authentication that Roy\n&gt; discusses in the REST paper but this answer still looks correct to me.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s incorrect (apart from the username@ in the URI), but there\nare advantages to some of the other approaches. I focused a lot on caching in\nmy answer to this thread (which included the above approach and some others and\ntried to weigh them up) because caching is a bit of a hobbyhorse for me and a\nbig part of why I personally like REST as a practical solution. My answer was\nhardly comprehensive and I&#39;m sure that more advantages and disadvantages for\neach of the approaches, and indeed other viable approaches, can be found.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
