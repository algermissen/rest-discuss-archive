For example, PUT-ing:\n\n  &lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;\n\nwill be retrieved usin=\r\ng GET as:\n\n  &lt;test/&gt;\n\nI know this issue has come up several times on this\nl=\r\nist, but it is interesting to see that one major vendor\nat least has interp=\r\nreted the semantics of PUT in a data-centric\nway as opposed to a document-c=\r\nentric way.  I tend to agree\nwith their approach as it makes PUT much more =\r\nuseful.\n\nStill, is Tamino wrong?  Why?\n\n- Jeff\n\n"}}
