Do you think of\nit symbolically (the glyph) or numerically?  If you need to explain\nto someone the algorithm for calculating the area of a circle, how\ndo you do that?  Those are all representations.\n\n&gt; While POSTing to &#39;presidential democracy&#39; IMHO *obviously* makes\n&gt; no sense I also have serious problems with the idea of GETing a\n&gt; representation of the state of &#39;presidential democracy&#39;.\n\nThen don&#39;t provide one.  There is no requirement that all resources\nhave representations.\n\n&gt; So, why does REST (&quot;REpresentational State Transfer&quot;!) include the\n&gt; notion of abstract concepts in the definition of resource?\n\nBecause they are resources.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
