If we can agree that there will be a need for  \n&gt;&gt; multiple\n&gt;&gt; protocols then that&#39;s a good start.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the most part, I don&#39;t.  I think one generic protocol will be most\n&gt; useful, although I can believe that outliers will happen.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; At the implementation level, e.g. the internal workings of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; participants, many variations will happen.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Agreed. But mixing and matching implementations that obey different\n&gt;&gt; protocols can cause problems, so the basic assumptions under which  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; participant works, e.g., do/undo, provisional/final, would still  \n&gt;&gt; need to be\n&gt;&gt; available in meta-data for instance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why does the coordinator need to care whether a given participant is\n&gt; using do/undo or provisional/final?\n\nIf you believe that different signals mean different things even if  \nthey have the same name then it does matter. Failure of prepare is  \ndifferent to failure of &quot;do&quot;, especially during recovery if you have a  \npresumed-abort protocol. Flick that over to presumed-commit or  \npresumed-nothing, then it really does make a difference. If I  \nimplement a participant under one set of assumptions and mix that with  \nothers, then the coordinator really does need to know (so does the  \nparticipant to be honest.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And it certainly is not any business of any other participant&#39;s.\n\nDifferent participants don&#39;t need to know about each other and that&#39;s  \nnot what I meant. But the contract between the coordinator and  \nparticipant should be clear.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, I think the same basic coordinator-participant\n&gt;&gt;&gt; interactions can happen for compensation or provisional-final\n&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns.  The participant can handle the two phases differently.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Only if the participant knows the &quot;type&quot; of transaction in which it  \n&gt;&gt; has been\n&gt;&gt; enlisted. For instance, enlisting a strictly ACID-based participant  \n&gt;&gt; in a\n&gt;&gt; compensating transaction is not necessarily the most efficient  \n&gt;&gt; thing to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think ACID rules work on the open Web, so I would leave those\n&gt; participants out of a RESTful transaction protocol by design.\n\nLast time I looked HTTP was being used quite a bit in the corporate  \nfirewall. Now it can be argued that maybe we should leave those  \ninteractions to WS-*, but I know that a few people would really like  \nto see that work done over REST too.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Did you ever take a look at the WS-CAF BP protocol :-) ? The  \n&gt;&gt; genesis of that\n&gt;&gt; is very close to what you are outlining, though of course it may  \n&gt;&gt; not have\n&gt;&gt; been as clearly articulated back then.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did, fairly deeply, back in the day, but remember it as more\n&gt; complicated than it should be for REST, I think.  Could look again if\n&gt; it comes back to life in RESTful guise.\n\nI blame SOAP for that ;-)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BTP is too complicated for REST, too.\n\nDefinitely. As are a host of other protocols.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I liked Peter Furniss&#39;s dirt simple abstract protocol sketch, will try\n&gt; to find it again and post it.\n\nI have it too somewhere.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;months&quot;? Did you come in towards the end ;-) ? I measure it in  \n&gt;&gt; years!\n&gt;\n&gt; 2001-2002, but I did not spend all of those two years in arguments.\n\nWell I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be repeated.\n\nAnyway, got to run to an 8 hour meeting :-(\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
