It isn&#39;t\n&gt; the case that any protocol with generic interfaces is equal to any other\n&gt; one. The one that is deployed is (all else equal) MUCH BETTER because of\n&gt; the interoperability you get out of using it.\n\nSure, I understand that.  And if HTTP is truly RESTful, then I think it is a\ngood thing to make such a statement.  However, what I was saying was that it\nseems like REST and HTTP are\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ... I know that REST is a methodology and HTTP is an\n&gt; &gt; implementation.  I also know that a lot of people say that HTTP is an\n&gt; &gt; example of REST.  But that&#39;s where the relationship stops for me.  HTTP\n(in\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s original incarnation, as I understand it) had a very simple\npurpose:\n&gt; &gt; provide a simple technique to allow researchers to share their works\nwith\n&gt; &gt; other researchers.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what does it matter what HTTP was intended to do 12 years ago. HTTP\n&gt; has evolved quite a bit if you look at the specifications. There is\n&gt; nothing in those specifications that is specific to some particular\n&gt; problem domain.\n\nI agree that HTTP has taken on a lot more over the years. However, it seems\nto me that HTTP 1.1 contains a lot of features that are not necessarily\nRESTful (e.g. persistant connections). In other words, I think that there is\na subset of HTTP 1.1 that is definitely RESTful.  However, HTTP 1.1\naltogether does not seem quite as RESTful.  To claim that &quot;HTTP is an\nexample of REST&quot; implies (esp. to those who do not understand REST but do\nunderstand HTTP) that HTTP and REST are a one-to-one relationship, which I\ndo not believe to be the case.  Earlier versions of HTTP were more RESTful.\nThe very fact that Fielding used HTTP as an example of REST shows that at\none point in the past REST and HTTP *were* one-to-one related.\n\nAnother way to look at this HTTP/REST thing is:  if HTTP is the only\nimplementation of REST that the REST-minded community will discuss, then why\ndo we even have REST in the first place?  REST is only useful as a concept\nthat could be generally applied.  Otherwise, it may as well be called &quot;HTTP\nGuidelines&quot;.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
