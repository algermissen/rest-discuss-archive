It is important to understand that the rel is=\r\n the relation the resource\n&gt;&gt; identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the ac=\r\ntual resource/uri/document.\n&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote othe=\r\nr information, like saying\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to u=\r\nse the link&#39;s URI with a POST\n&gt;&gt; to create something.

It is t=\r\nhen up to the client (the client intent) to follow\n&gt; this rel (using an imp=\r\nlicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of\n&gt; the &#39;order&#39;-like thi=\r\nng (as rendered in a specific media-type).\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; su=\r\nch as &#39;http://relations.example.com/new&#39; to\n&gt; (unreasonably) convey that th=\r\ne user agent can POST an item of the type\n&gt; communicated by it&#39;s current co=\r\nntext. This is the problem, I don&#39;t need to\n&gt; &#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that =\r\nit can POST at a specific URI, because the\n&gt; available HTTP methods tell me=\r\n what I can do with the resource. What I need\n&gt; to do is examine the permit=\r\nted methods (either by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39;\n&gt; header, or an OPTIONS re=\r\nquest) AND not try to convey the permutations of\n&gt; method in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Does that make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot;\n&gt; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!\n&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:\n&gt;&gt; 1. Links rep=\r\nresent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that\n&gt;&gt; you can us=\r\nually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are\n&gt;&gt; lots of =\r\nquestions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual\n&gt;&gt; resource=\r\n (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What is this link referring to? What\n&gt;&gt; other oper=\r\nations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query\n&gt;&gt; parameters =\r\nto it? What media type will it return? What media type may it\n&gt;&gt; expect if =\r\nI can issue a POST?, etc...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more inform=\r\nation about a link. I denotes a\n&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation th=\r\ne link has with the current\n&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, th=\r\nat is your current resources\n&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel=3D&quot;next&quot; =\r\nwill hint that following that\n&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the =\r\nbook.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation t=\r\nhe resource\n&gt;&gt; identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual resource/u=\r\nri/document.\n&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, =\r\nlike saying\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s U=\r\nRI with a POST\n&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it =\r\nis a bad\n&gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in=\r\n your client. If you are\n&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; wil=\r\nl tell you the links points\n&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that informa=\r\ntion, you can start asking\n&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a c=\r\nomment to it using POST\n&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much o=\r\nf this interaction is\n&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may n=\r\not need to be statically\n&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), et=\r\nc.\n&gt;&gt; Plus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the r=\r\nel\n&gt;&gt; may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). Wi=\r\nth\n&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some=\r\n other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor and image are special links\n&gt;&gt; that have a s=\r\ntandard meaning and established processing. If you found an\n&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag yo=\r\nu automatically know that link is referring to an image, and\n&gt;&gt; if you are =\r\nin HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch\n&gt;&gt; that imag=\r\ne with a GET and display it based on context and additional\n&gt;&gt; attributes. =\r\nAll that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world\n&gt;&gt; knows it. S=\r\no, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have\n&gt;&gt; it clear=\r\n they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attribute\n&gt;&gt; will t=\r\nell you everything.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt;&gt; --- In rest-dis=\r\ncuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know =\r\none of the first questions i had was on rel link.
