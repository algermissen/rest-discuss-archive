The maintainer must recompile\nwith -DSECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION. There are security vulnerablilties\nassociated with this patch:\n\nsystem users\nAll information is passed from the web server to the CGI script via\nenvironment variables. Users on the system may examine the environment of a\nspawned script and extract the authentication credentials for that were\npassed to the script.\nscript authors\nAny script author may get the authentication credentials for a user in any\nrealm on the server. This means you have to trust all script authors to be\nresoponsible with user credentials. If\nThese patches are for a system where there are no untrusted users but there\nmay be unstrusted scripts. The patch allows the administrator to defer\nauthentication to scripts on a per-directory basis. On systems with remote\nauthoring, ie no untrusted users with shell access, but untrusted users able\nto insert scripts of their choosing into the resource tree. It would\nprobably be prudent to disable Options in .htaccess files (AllowOverride\nNone).\n\nStatus\nThis patch is not submitted to apache as it has not been tested. It is\nunlikely to be incorporated if it is submitted as it marginally increases\nthe ease of introducing a security hole (editing httpd.conf or .htaccess\ninstead of recompiling apache).\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, April 19, 2002 12:54 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Capturing HTTP userid in CGI\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to make a passthrough app that will restify the Google API. I\n&gt; want to allow the end-user to choose whether they want to pass the\n&gt; Google &quot;key&quot; (essentially a username) as a keyword parameter or as an\n&gt; HTTP user name. I think this would be not too tricky except that I need\n&gt; to capture the HTTP user name *as* a key and pass that on to Google. The\n&gt; code is just simple CGI for portability. The problem is that I don&#39;t\n&gt; think that Apache is sending me the username, password or anything else\n&gt; I can use. In particular I don&#39;t get the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header. Any\n&gt; ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
