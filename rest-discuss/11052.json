I also do some caching in my business/dao layers.\n\nHow would the =\r\n&quot;REST cache&quot; be any different? I&#39;m imagining a &quot;service\nlayer caching&quot; here=\r\n, sort of like: (I use tomcat/java/jersey btw)\n\n1) Client requests resource=\r\n &quot;/users&quot;\n2) The service layer will be intercepted (AOP, or a filter) perha=\r\nps by\nmy caching service and check the last-modified date for the &quot;/users&quot;\n=\r\nresource. So I would have an entry in a hashtable like {&quot;/users&quot;,\n10/23/08 =\r\n14:25, [john, mary, bob]}\n3) I compare the dates and either return [john, m=\r\nary, bob] or a\nResponseObject with the not-modified header.\n\nThe only diffe=\r\nrence here from a tradicional (ehcache, oscache) cache\nis the date based ca=\r\nching. Something like this? What other\nalternatives are there? \n\nI know som=\r\nething about Etags, expiration header and other specifics of\nthe HTTP proto=\r\ncol. I&#39;m talking about the caching &quot;framework&quot; really.\n\n\n\n"}}
