Going to the URL doesn&#39;t validate the address (i.e. no side\neffects to the GET), but that&#39;s the only way to get the form and thus\nthe URL to which the registration gets POSTed to.\n\nThat said, I admit to sort-of overloading the GET in my registration,\nbecause it&#39;s Lazy. It&#39;s awfully hard to get Lazy Registration and REST\nto cooperate (at least, when the client is a human-operated vanilla\nbrowser, and you have to involve email).\n\n"}}
