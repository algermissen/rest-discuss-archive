How does JSON make life better?\n&gt; \n&gt; JSON is a self-d=\r\nescriptive data representation.  It supports all the \n&gt; basic, atomic build=\r\ning blocks of data: booleans, numbers, strings.  And \n&gt; provides composite =\r\nstructures of arrays and maps.  Maps can also be \n&gt; viewed as &#39;objects&#39;, wh=\r\nere they keys of the map are the properties of \n&gt; the object; in fact, that=\r\n&#39;s exactly how JavaScript treats them.\n&gt; \n&gt; XML is great for documents.  Wh=\r\nich are hard to map into data; you have \n&gt; to actually think about how to d=\r\no it right.  Attributes or\nsub-elements? \n&gt;   Explicit list structures, or =\r\njust multiple elements to represent a\nlist?\n&gt; \n&gt; JSON is great for data.  W=\r\nhich is easy to map into data.\n&gt; \n\nActually I meant to send the question to=\r\n the list (darn web\ninterface), so thanks for forwarding the response.\n\nI&#39;m=\r\n sorry, but my mind is too stuborn to see the difference between\nthe two.  =\r\nAre you saying that JSON is better b/c it encodes the type\nof a value (e.g.=\r\n bool, numbe, string) in its representation?  Isn&#39;t\nthere otherwise a 1-to-=\r\n1 mapping b/w JSON and XML?\n\nOne thing that always bugged me about objects =\r\nwas that I couldn&#39;t\nencapsualte sub-properties without resorting to other o=\r\nbjects.  For\ninstance, doing something like:\n    doc.settings.alignment =3D=\r\n &quot;left&quot;;\n\nHere, I would need to have a &#39;doc&#39; object and a &#39;settings&#39; object=\r\n that\ncontains a reference to &quot;left&quot;.  This bugs me because the &#39;settings&#39;\n=\r\nkind of object might not be useful anywhere else (I realize that in\nthis ex=\r\nample that might not be the case, but let&#39;s stick with it for\nargument sake=\r\n).\n\nIn XML, I don&#39;t have this limitation.  Instead, I can say\n    doc[setti=\r\nngs/alignment] =3D &quot;left&quot;;\nIt&#39;s all part of one object (or document; frankl=\r\ny, I don&#39;t see the\ndifference between the two anymore, except that the latt=\r\ner seems to be\nan evolution of the former).\n\nCould you give a concrete exam=\r\nple of where JSON makes life better?\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
