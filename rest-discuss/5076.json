I&#39;d like to\nknow what people here think of this scheme:\n\n   POST /transaction\n   =&gt; /transaction/xxx\n\n   POST /transaction/xxx\n   &lt;item1/&gt;\n   =&gt; /transaction/xxx/item1\n\n   POST /transaction/xxx\n   &lt;item2/&gt;\n   =&gt; /transaction/xxx/item2\n   \n   POST /transaction/xxx\n   &lt;item3/&gt;\n   =&gt; /transaction/xxx/item3\n\nTo commit the transaction:\n\n   GET /transaction/xxx\n   =&gt; &lt;xxx&gt;\n        &lt;item1/&gt;\n        &lt;item2/&gt;\n        &lt;item3/&gt;\n      &lt;/xxx&gt;\n\n   PUT /transaction/xxx \n   &lt;xxx&gt;\n      &lt;item1/&gt;\n      &lt;item2/&gt;\n      &lt;item3/&gt;\n   &lt;/xxx&gt;\n\nIt seems to me this would work as well as anything done with an RPC\nclient.\n\nI think that the point about this is that it only *models*\ntransactions with REST, there&#39;s no change to the way REST is done.\n\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d be interested to hear what people think about it.\n\n\n\nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk\n\n"}}
