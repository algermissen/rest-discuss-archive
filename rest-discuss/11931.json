Indeed the part focusing on \ntext/uri-list doesn&#39;t mention this purpose. Good separation of concerns.\n\nOf itself, it is a format that encodes a list of zero or more URIs along \nwith optional comments. If that solves your purposes then I don&#39;t see a \nproblem.\n\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; would it be better to a) invent a new media type in the vnd tree, b)\n&gt;&gt; use text/uri-list beyond its original scope or c) draft a new RFC for\n&gt;&gt; this?\n\nd) Use text/uri-list in what I&#39;m not sure is beyond its original scope \nat all.\n\nNow, my further thought is wondering whether it is suitable for the \nhypertext document that SHOULD accompany a 301, 302, 303 or 307. The \ngist of such a note would be a single URI, which it could certainly \nprovide, though there is no semantics for clearly indicating that this \nURI should now be followed beyond the use of comments.\n\n\n"}}
