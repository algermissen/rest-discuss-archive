Either through a prose\n&gt;document or perhaps through a design-time specification like WSDL. The\n&gt;same holds for REST. What REST changes is that it separates the globally\n&gt;standardized stuff (methods, URIs) from the must-be-negotiated stuff\n&gt;(representations) which simplifies the negotiations and improves partial\n&gt;understanding. For instance if you define a &quot;UserLandUserML&quot; you&#39;ll find\n&gt;you can much more easily reuse that across different content management\n&gt;systems and parts of the UserLand API than the &quot;RegisterUserLandUser&quot;\n&gt;operation.\n\nThis is one area where I see SOAP as having an advantage - you don&#39;t need to invent a ???ML (where ??? is your representation/resource space) with the associated problems of deciding how and when do I use XSD, RELAX-NG, DTD&#39;s, RDF, DAML, Schematron, ... or do I wait for a standard from the relevant standards body in my domain and if so what do I do in the interim. There is a lot of appeal to the hard-pressed people in the trenches to running a few wizards and presto a nice standards compliant Web interface springs into existence.\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
