So, it seems\n&gt; like the right thing is to have /Subscriptions return different content\n&gt; (representations) depending on user.\n\nThere&#39;s a tradeoff, of course.  It&#39;s my understanding that many\ncaches can&#39;t handle this type of use very well (though maybe it&#39;s\nimproved).\n\n&gt; Or at least as long as the user credentials are explicitly contained in\n&gt; the request. Right? Don&#39;t play magic games with cookies containing\n&gt; session ids. Which, I think, for HTTP says that you have to use the\n&gt; Authorization header in the request, and the response would have a Vary:\n&gt; Authorization header.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; Which makes me think ... Can someone run the argument for why cookies\n&gt; are evil by me again, please? How does the client end up holding more\n&gt; state in a cookie than it does to fill in an Authorization header? In\n\nThe client ends up holding *less* state; state that it would\nnormally have, such as id/password, are held on the server and\nthe client is just given a &quot;receipt&quot; for them.  The server is\nholding state on the client&#39;s behalf.  That&#39;s the problem.\n\n&gt; But, is there some hard technical reason that makes limiting the range\n&gt; of Vary a requirement? I.e., if you allowed Vary response to indicate\n&gt; any header in the request (extension headers as well as request headers)\n\nVary can name any header, even extension ones.  Just like Connection.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.  Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca             http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
