The RDF model can be\n&gt; serialized into many syntaxes to make in-line integration easier.\n\nYes, that&#39;s of course true. Here is why I think of it as in-line versus\nout-of-line: I am an XML person and I think that syntax matters. One of\nmy complaints about SOAP is that it (and XLink, for that matter) is that\nit introduces a foreign syntax into XML vocabularies and thus makes them\nharder to teach and learn. That impacts their adoption characteristics.\n\nOut-of-line, I can stand RDF&#39;s syntax because that is really what it is\noptimized for: pointing into resources and making assertions about them.\nBut inline, I can hardly imagine ever doing this:\n\n&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;\n  &lt;rdf:Description about=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;s:Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/s:Creator&gt;\n  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n\nRather than:\n\n&lt;Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/Creator&gt;\n\nI think that this sort of disagreement was behind the RSS conflict and\nbranch.\n\nLikely the right way to merge the worlds is to have a sort of RDF\nstylesheet which maps from XML into the RDF model. I would associate\nthat with my document through a processing instruction. I believe the\nFourThought guys were working on such a technique.\n\n&gt; What RDF provides is a generalized assertion model.  That means that an\n&gt; RDF client can build up an understanding of a piece of representational\n&gt; state in an incremental manner, rather than the all-or-nothing approach\n&gt; of XML, where you either do or do not understand a schema.\n\nThat&#39;s certainly valuable but in my personal opinion, most XML users\nwill not be willing to pay the price of designing their vocabularies\nspecifically for RDF compatibility.  For instance I much prefer the\nsyntax of the real WSDL to the one outlined here:\n\n * http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-rdf/\n\nFor one thing, the idea of making one of the top-most elements &quot;rdf:RDF&quot;\nrather goes against the design of almost every XML schema language I&#39;ve\never seen.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
