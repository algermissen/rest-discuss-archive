The only reason\n&gt; Roy&gt; POST is allowed (and only to the host where the script came\n&gt; Roy&gt; from, hopefully) is because there is no other method for\n&gt; Roy&gt; sending payload-driven safe queries.\n&gt;\n&gt; So how is sending DELETE over POST any safer than just allowing  \n&gt; DELETE?\n\nNot at all -- it is simply that someone needed POST in spite of the\nknown security hole that was created by enabling it, and that point\nof view has prevailed.  The same can&#39;t be said for DELETE.  It is\nreally easy to define a rational security model for all of these\nmethods -- the hard part is getting all of the browser vendors to\nimplement one model.\n\n&gt; Roy&gt; Instead of railing against the browser developers for their\n&gt; Roy&gt; common sense restriction\n&gt;\n&gt; The point is not that they restrict it, but that the implementations\n&gt; don&#39;t fully support the HTTP standard. None of them restricts DELETE\n&gt; or PUT in anyway.\n\nUmm, I remember discussion from 1994 that was specifically about\nrestricting methods in HTML.  Why each browser chose to not implement\ncertain things is a mystery, but they were certainly aware of the\nmethods at that time.  IIRC, they simply had no agreed UI for indicating\nthe distinction when the action is selected.  Somebody has to define\nthat for them before any such behavior can be standardized.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
