The characteristics of resources vary so greatly, that I \n&gt; don&#39;t see that there would be any way to establish any kind \n&gt; of generic \n&gt; guarantee that would hold across all resources.  I&#39;m sure \n&gt; that for set \n&gt; of simple cases you might be able to guarantee some sort of byte-wise \n&gt; equivalence, but I don&#39;t see that happening across all types \n&gt; of resources.\n\nThat&#39;s the way I see it, too.  If not for the variable characteristics,\nguaranteed by the designed-in indirection between names and resource\nand between resources and their representations, you could make some\nclaims about repeatable results with different URIs.  But the variability\nis designed in, so you can&#39;t.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
