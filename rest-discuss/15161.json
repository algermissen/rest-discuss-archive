Haven&#39;t read =\r\nit in deep, just over read, and I see first that we try the API as a normal=\r\n RPC API to begin with. Then we go into defining what we need, for instance=\r\n a data structure, that is not more that a resource actual representation. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; All that is fine for me, but I feel it needs the mapping explanation.=\r\n Since I come from the architectural side, I would start by defining why we=\r\n need the API, and how the API is RESTFull in the REST sense. Then I may co=\r\nme with this regular API and explain what changes should I make to create a=\r\n RESTFull one. Then I explain what the resources would be (a data dictionar=\r\ny fits fine), and then the possible representations (structure) and then et=\r\nc. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is more work, I know, and probably a developer wants to have =\r\nthe code to just copy paste, but if we intend to teach about REST I would s=\r\nuggest to include the what (concept) and then the how (in dev terms).
