I also can&#39;t find\nanything that suggests that a 200 response is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps DELETE is just under-defined?  Are there other examples\nthat demonstrate this issue that don&#39;t use DELETE?  Conditional PUTs\nmaybe?  Dunno.\n\n&gt; Does your client stack implement request piplining? If it does, there&#39;s \n&gt; presumably somewhere where a decision has to be made about whether to \n&gt; pipeline a request immediately or wait for pending responses to arrive. \n&gt; I played cautious and only allowed piplining for GET and then only if \n&gt; the only pending responses were for GETs.\n\nWe only block on non-idempotent methods (POST).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
