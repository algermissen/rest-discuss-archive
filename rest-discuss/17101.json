So if this is too generic I\n&gt; &gt; will read up more and come back.\n&gt; It is a big, open question, but I&#39;ll try to push you in the right\n&gt; direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am trying to understand how REST and metadata initiatives are\n&gt; &gt; related to each other. Why do you need Dublin Core/XMP etc. ? Are\n&gt; &gt; these microformats ?\n&gt; \n&gt; On the surface, there is no direct connection except the Web\n&gt; architecture. REST is an architectural style for managing information\n&gt; resources.  It has very little standard metadata associated with it\n&gt; other than that it inherits from HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dublin Core is a framework for describing publication metadata. It\n&gt; was produced by a bunch of librarians through the OCLC in Dublin, OH.\n&gt; It originally started around the Warwick Framework but was recast as\n&gt; the poster child for RDF along the way. Dublin Core is mostly used to\n&gt; describe authorship, subject designation, publication dates, etc. It\n&gt; is actually a more complicated framework that supports\n&gt; interoperability across metadata profiles, but for your purposes\n&gt; here, it is an RDF vocabulary for describing resources with standard\n&gt; metadata terms (dc:title, dc:subject, dc:creator, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be used either directly as RDF:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://bosatsu.net/index.html http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator\n&gt; http://purl.org/net/bsletten  \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a simple fact or &quot;triple&quot;  connecting a document to an\n&gt; author, indicated by a 303 non-network-addressable resource through\n&gt; the Dublin Core creator relationship). RDF statements follow a\n&gt; subject - predicate - value relationship but can have many different\n&gt; serializations. In this case, both the subject and the relationship\n&gt; are global and resolvable:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator\n&gt; \n&gt; This can resolve both human-readable and machine-processable versions\n&gt; of the relationship. The data model allows you to use relationships\n&gt; from other vocabularies so it makes it very easy to accumulate data\n&gt; from the Web. People are now starting to weave RDF into XHTML, HTML,\n&gt; SVG, ODF, etc., generating it on the fly, exposing it natively as\n&gt; part of the Linked Data Project (http://linkedata.org).\n&gt; \n&gt; There are technologies that build on RDF such as SKOS and OWL to\n&gt; allow you to organize the terms and resources in new and interesting\n&gt; ways. You can then start to do certain types of inference over the\n&gt; data organized this way. One of the exciting parts is that you can\n&gt; organize other people&#39;s data the way you want to see it relatively\n&gt; easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; RDF and microformats serve similar goals (to describe documents and\n&gt; resources) but they have much different scopes. RDF has a data model\n&gt; associated with it and is largely intended to support global\n&gt; references and relationships. Microformats are intended to be simple,\n&gt; developer-friendly ways of encoding certain domains (events, people,\n&gt; reviews, organizations, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The good news is that it is easy to convert Microformats into a form\n&gt; that can be used with RDF so it is all good metadata.\n&gt; \n&gt; XMP is based on an older version of RDF and was intended as a way of\n&gt; allowing Adobe&#39;s various partners to contribute tools in a\n&gt; document-processing framework and allowing them all to annotate a\n&gt; document, image, etc. with metadata (camera information, filters\n&gt; applied, etc.) It isn&#39;t super-wildly used but I think the adoption of\n&gt; RDFa by ODF is going to help spur interest here again.\n&gt; \n&gt; The excellent &quot;RESTful Web Services Cookbook&quot; and &quot;REST in Practice&quot;\n&gt; books touch upon the relationship between REST and Semantic Web\n&gt; technologies like RDF, but I am taking a much deeper dive in a book I\n&gt; am writing for Addison-Wesley called &quot;Resource-Oriented\n&gt; Architectures : Building Webs of Data&quot;.\n\n"}}
