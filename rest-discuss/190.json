That&#39;s nice in theory, but it&#39;s just neither true nor desirable in\n&gt; practice.  URI *always* (and should!) have some associated semantics in the\n&gt; higher-level application domain in question.  For example, in the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674000781/\n&gt; \n&gt; the part following ASIN/ has the semantics &quot;an ISBN.&quot;  Note that I&#39;m not claiming\n&gt; that Amazon exposes a particularly RESTful resource model, just that modeling\n&gt; books as resources identified in some collection via ISBNs does not by itself\n&gt; violate opacity or break REST.  A better resource model might be:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.amazon.com/books/ISBNs/0674000781\n&gt; \n&gt; The opacity axiom simply says that the underlying application --- HTTP ---\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t ever have to know anything about books.  It doesn&#39;t say that a\n&gt; bookselling application shouldn&#39;t model and expose those abstractions through the\n&gt; URI space.  Indeed, doing so is a RESTful thing, isn&#39;t it?   It also doesn&#39;t say\n&gt; that a set of book-oriented applications from various developers should not or\n&gt; could not agree on a conventional method of modeling books, collections of books,\n&gt; etc. as resources.\n\nHmm, maybe I was unclear on what you meant by &quot;application domain&quot;.\nObviously each resource publisher can have their own conventions.\nWhat I thought you were saying was that Amazon and B&N had to have\nsimilar looking URIs.  That would be a Bad Thing.\n\n&gt; &gt; As soon as you assign any meaning to a URI, then\n&gt; &gt; only those privy to that meaning are in on your little secrets (like\n&gt; &gt; appending &quot;/subs&quot; means &quot;subscribers to the URI before /subs&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; And this is just fine for &quot;applications&quot; that don&#39;t live at the same level of\n&gt; generalization as HTTP.  The issue at hand is whether &quot;events&quot;, pub / sub,\n&gt; notifications, etc. constitute a (or several) higher abstraction / application\n&gt; domain(s) like &quot;book-oriented applications&quot; (perhaps lower level than that, but\n&gt; higher level than HTTP per se) or whether they belong at the level of generality\n&gt; of HTTP.  My argument is that they belong at a higher level, for several reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt;   (1)  Use of event notification differs from app domain to app domain\n\nJust like how retrieving a picture of a book is different than\nretrieving an HTML page of me? 8-)\n\n&gt;   (2)  It&#39;s difficult IMO to provide useful notification generalizations\n&gt;   (3)  The higher levels of abstraction are more &quot;fungible&quot; in some sense\n&gt;  tentative  (4)  In general we should be reluctant to extend rather than just use\n&gt; HTTP as-is\n\nOr just make sure &quot;WATCH&quot; is as generic as GET.  Uh oh, I&#39;ve said\ntoo much. 8-)\n\n&gt; Bottom line, opacity doesn&#39;t IMO literally say that URI shouldn&#39;t have semantics\n&gt; *at all.*  It says that those semantics belong outside the realm of HTTP and URI\n&gt; as such, and rather belong to and should be interpreted in the context of some\n&gt; application domain.\n\nI couldn&#39;t disagree more.  URIs should be as opaque as possible, so that\nany information about them and their relationships can be made explicit\nwithin the HTTP application model.  If I can&#39;t do a GET on a URI to find\nout about its relationships with other resources, then that information\nisn&#39;t on the Web, and that&#39;s naughty.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s my current working hypothesis, anyway.  Open to revision.\n\nGood to hear. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
