They seem to /beg/ for a simple URI and http access\n&gt; mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe we can convince MarkB to do that like he did with some xml-rpc\n&gt; interfaces.\n\nI have this thing against registries, unless they&#39;re anything more than\na list of URI like dmoz.org.  The Web is so decentralized, that keeping\nmetadata separate from data is just a maintenance and security nightmare\nwaiting to happen.\n\nSo I can&#39;t really see any value in trying to RESTify ebxml.\n\nI also can&#39;t see trying to convince a set of companies that plan to make\nmoney off a centralized model, that a decentralized model is the best\nway to go.  So I&#39;m not really into evangelizing REST to them either.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
