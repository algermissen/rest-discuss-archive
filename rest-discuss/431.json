I&#39;m very much still ramping up on REST, which I see as a minor\nmeme competing for mindshare among the big honkin meme of &quot;XML Web\nServices&quot;, SOAP, etc.  Web Services as a whole suffer from (IMO) a lack\nof down-to-earth-appeal.  What are Web Services going to do for me?  In\nwhat way is the _programmability_ of the web going to change my life/the\nway I do business?  A very small fraction of the world is visionary\nabout WS and &quot;gets it&quot;, and those are the people being heard right now. \nMost of the rest of us are somewhat puzzled and baffled by the acronym\nsoup, the _complexity_ of the solution.\n\nNow, REST is intriguing to me for a very simple reason -- it&#39;s\ntechnologically already there.  The part that&#39;s left to do is purely a\nmatter of coming up with the bright idea, setting up the social\nagreement, schemas, partnerships, etc.  So REST, inasmuch as it relates\nto Web Services, can leapfrog the SOAP meme by very quickly retrofitting\nexisting technology and _demonstrating_ _real_ applications.  \n\nMy suggestion: a new page on the Wiki called RealWorldApplications,\nwhich provides people pointers to the Meerkats, Magi, KnowKnow, Zope?\nand the like, and discussions of how they are RESTful.  Preferably a\ncompact REST-oriented description of the app would save the readers some\ndigging on corporate sites =).  Most importantly, describing how the\nRESTful nature is an asset.  For something like Zope, I think it&#39;s\nrelatively easy to get the benefit of the addressability-through-URLs of\nobjects.  For Magi, it&#39;s not at all obvious without taking a lot of time\nto dig in.  I&#39;d appreciate some pointers.\n\nSide question: how does one put Unicode characters in URLs?\n\n--david ascher\n\n"}}
