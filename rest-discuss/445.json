SMTP provides a nice way\n&gt; of failing over when a machine goes down (or is\n&gt; too busy).  Do you think the variety of ugly HTTP\n&gt; load balancing schemes are better?\n\nIrrelevant.  The issue here is that SMTP routing behavior is defined and\nconfigured by an out-of-band mechanism, DNS --- that&#39;s bad enough by\nitself, and made worse still by some of the unpleasant specifics of DNS\nand its use.  DNS is (still) relatively rigid, non-dynamic,\nunidirectional, slow-changing, and brittle.  (Indeed, you can think of\nDHCP as a response in part to DNS&#39;s unidirectional and slow-changing /\ndifficult-to-change characteristics.)  SMTP&#39;s correct behavior\nunfortunately depends on correct DNS configuration, availability, etc;\nDNS is a thorn in the side of SMTP, and at the same time SMTP support\nhas long been a conceptual and architectural tumor growing on / in DNS.\nSMTP inherits a lot of its bletcherousness from its intimate and\nunseemly relationship with DNS, and IMO that alone is a good enough\nreason to begin thinking about its replacement.  The dependency is a Bad\nThing (tm) any way you look at it.\n\nThis was all fine in a world of tens to hundreds of hosts and tens to\nhundreds of thousands of users, with smart, technical guys running the\nshow administratively, where &quot;churn&quot; was minimal because most of the\nfolks involved were academics who didn&#39;t &quot;move around a lot.&quot;  The\nassumptions are no longer valid --- we live in a world with tens of\nmillions of hosts, hundreds of millions of users, increasing\nephemerality of connection, high rates of user&lt;-&gt;host and topological\nchurn.\n\nClay Shirky and many others have noted that DNS is collapsing under its\nown weight and architectural limitations.  Alex, I agree with you that\nthe Web needs its own naming and routing mechanisms --- but we\n*certainly* shouldn&#39;t base our solutions on the very same fallacious\nassumptions that created the problems in the first place!\n\njb\n\nPS - I have in the past floated the idea (the &quot;metaweb&quot;) of using\nverifiable naming and HTTP&#39;s own 3xx response as a routing primitive in\ncombination to make the Web self-naming and self-routing, independent of\nDNS and free from many of its current, unpleasant and unnecessary\nadministrative constraints.  This is probably do-able with minimal\nimpact on the existing Web architecture.  There&#39;s a large amount of\ncurrent work going on along these lines relative to distributed\nfilesystems, filesharing, p2p and decentralized systems.  It would be\nnice to see a principled design for such functionality available for\ngeneral use within the Web community.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
