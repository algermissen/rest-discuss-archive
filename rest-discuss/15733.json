Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Which leads us back to REST. =A0The claim that a representation is =\r\na\n&gt; resource is wrong, of course. =A0The common advice to treat variants as=\r\n\n&gt; resources in their own right, should really be &quot;treat variants also as\n&gt;=\r\n representations of another resource&quot; but that&#39;s more confusing to say.\n\nI =\r\nthink what you are saying is something like the following.  For a\nresource =\r\nR1 with more than one member there must exist some other\nresources whose me=\r\nmberships are {e in R1,e acceptable to a specific\nsubset of clients} such t=\r\nhat every member of R1 is the sole member of\none of these other resources.\n=\r\n\nThis proposition does not follow from any of the constraints.  Nor is\nit c=\r\novered explicitly in the dissertation.  It is also not required,\nat least i=\r\nn principle, to achieve any of the desired qualities of a\nREST style archit=\r\necture.\n\nGiven a resource R=3D{E1,E2}, if there was no resource R2 =3D {one=\r\n e in R,\ne acceptable clients to which E1 is acceptable} no REST constraint=\r\ns\nare violated unless you have a preexisting notion that R2 must exist.\nThe=\r\n constraint violation you keep bring up is dependent on the\nassertion that =\r\nthe resource in question exists.  IOW, it seems your\nargument is, the resou=\r\nrce R2 must exist because it does not then you\nhave failed to identify the =\r\nresource R2.\n\nThe above seems complicated to point of absurdity.  One the o=\r\nther\nhand, when approaching the question of when variant should be\nresource=\r\ns for application stand point it becomes quite simple.  If a\nvariant is ind=\r\nividually useful in the application or implementation\ndomain, is should be =\r\nmodeled as a resource in its own right.\n\n\nCircling back to content-location=\r\n in the conneg context.  I read the\nRFC as allowing variants to be identifi=\r\ned in the content-location\nheader if the variants have separate locations. =\r\n I do not read it to\nmean that all variants *should* have locations.\n\nHandl=\r\ning conneg by redirecting to the appropriate resource would have\nsignifican=\r\nt caching benefits.  However, i think that using etags would\nresult in bett=\r\ner cache behavior than content location for resources\nwith multiple represe=\r\nntations.  A cache can form more expressive\nconditional requests using If-N=\r\none-Match than it can with\nIf-Modified-Since when multiple representations =\r\nare in play.  There\nwould be certainly be no problem with providing both if=\r\n you wanted to,\nthough.\n\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
