REST says\n&gt; nothing of &quot;data&quot;, nor should it because it&#39;s hidden (if I understand\n&gt; what is meant by &quot;data&quot; - basically, the state in some raw form).\n\nMark N. believes (and without looking it up, I would guess he&#39;s right)\nthat the semantics of PUT are that an immediately following GET should\nreturn the same representation that was just PUT. Whereas POST has no\nsuch semantic. So when they say &quot;data&quot; they mean a representation that\nis appropriate for GETing.\n\n&gt; I also don&#39;t know what John means by &quot;The appropriate pair for REST\n&gt; is GET/POST&quot;.  Why &quot;pair&quot;?  Why restrict one&#39;s self to two methods\n&gt; for coordination when three is needed?\n\nYou claim that three is needed (why not four) but the web more or less\ngets by with two today!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
