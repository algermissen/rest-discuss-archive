(I.e.: it may be that this is an apples\n&gt; and elephants comparison, but there may be many conversational contexts\n&gt; in which it useful to compare, contrast, or consider similarities\n&gt; between apples and elephants.)  I&#39;ve found it particularly instructive\n&gt; to compare REST to programming language paradigms, and here&#39;s why:\n\nI didn&#39;t mean to imply that (when it comes to REST) what Paul says, goes.\nThat was just my way of saying that I thought that particular comment of his\nwas both true and useful. Saying that REST is (or is not) OO and that makes\nit good (or bad) are the types of comments that I don&#39;t think could ever be\nuniversally true or useful.\n\n&gt; All of these things are mechanisms for decomposing functionality into\n&gt; discrete pieces and then building up programs by &quot;plugging&quot; these pieces\n&gt; together and letting them talk to each other.  The abstract model of how\n&gt; you do this is what defines a given style, and whether that is embodied\n&gt; in a programming language or a distributed system design is, at some\n&gt; level, irrelevant.  You can usefully talk about (some of) the\n&gt; characteristics of one model or the other independent of its specific\n&gt; instantiation.\n\nBut what I think that you&#39;re missing is that REST can be abstracted away\nbehind an OO API, a procedural one, a functional one (using monads), and\nprobably even others. The REST architectural style is orthogonal to whatever\nprogramming paradigm you prefer to develop in.\n\n&gt; Anyway, I happen to have found the process of such consideration\n&gt; instructive in understanding REST.  Your (or Paul&#39;s, etc.) mileage may\n&gt; vary, but before you jump the gun, consider the following sentence:\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;OOP is to CORBA as ??? is to the Web.&quot;\n\nOOP and CORBA are not related exlusively to all other programming paradigms\nor architectural styles. It&#39;s just as possible to develop a monolithic\nprocedural API using CORBA as it is an object oriented one. The same goes\nfor REST.\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
