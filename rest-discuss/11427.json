FYI I lost patience with the\nstandard process a while back because it seemed that no matter my input I\nwas always told &quot;no.&quot;  Since I only found frustration, I gave up. \n\nI&#39;m participating again because Ian included me on a follow email on this\nissue and because I really do want to see URI Templates become part of\nHTML5.  That said, I really have no idea how to go about getting things\naccepted I think because I look for what could be and it seems most\nstandards people only want to see what already is?\n\nIf it takes untold hours of time to debate and to provide exhaustive\nsupporting evidence I guess I&#39;ll have to give up on the hope for this since\nI really do need to use my time to make a living and no one is paying me for\nmy time to participate here.\n\nIf you can guide me as to how to efficently get something accepted, I&#39;m all\nears!\n\n&gt;&gt; I suspect you meant to say when that person *isn&#39;t* in control of the\nserver.\n\nYes, thanks for catching my error.\n\n&gt;&gt; If so, I&#39;ve never been very swayed by the notion that people publishing\non geocities (or twitter or whatever else is the free hosting / republishing\nprovider of the moment is) should be able to make a fully-functional Web app\nusing nothing but HTML and sticky tape; see previous discussions about the\ncross-site access control mechanism.\n\nFirst, not asking for a fully-functional web app, just for the ability to\nincorporate usable forms into an HTML fragment where Javascript is not\nallowed.\n\nSecond, hasn&#39;t it been obvious with the explosion of social media that over\ntime the vast majority of content published on the web will be published by\npeople using a server they do not control?  Forums, Blog hosting, Facebook,\nLinkedIn, etc. etc. etc.  \n\nFrankly it was over the lack of appreciation for social media&#39;s use of HTML\nthat I gave up on participating in the HTML5 WG. My guess is that within ten\nyears &gt;90% of HTML on the web will be published on social media services\n(including self hosted open-source apps) yet the participants in the HTML5\nWG seemed to only consider HTML published by people in control of the server\n(i.e. my &quot;&lt;10%&quot;) were the only valid users.\n\nHonestly, there really should be a focus on making sure the HTML can work in\n&quot;fragment-mode&quot; (i.e. where someone provides a fragment of HTML that is\nincorporated within other HTML.)  That calls the question of the need for a\n&lt;fragment&gt; element that can contain malformed HTML w/o breaking the\ncontaining HTML, but that&#39;s another subject...\n\nBTW, don&#39;t you think the geocities reference is a bit of a low blow? ;)\n\n&gt;&gt; Plenty of performance-sensitive sites use redirects to implement various\nfunctions, and they&#39;re good enough despite their two round trips. Perfect,\nno, but good enough.\n\nPlenty do but more do not, and many people on forums, blog posts and mailing\nlists recommend to others not to do so because of the performance cost. The\ncost of round trips has been used as a reason against certain web\narchitectures such as in discussions of ROBOTS.TXT and 303.\n\nMost notably people who write about web performance optimization who happen\nto work for your employer recommend against doing so:\n\nhttp://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#redirects\nhttp://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Using &quot;filling a hole in the architecture&quot; as a justification for doing\nsomething gives me the screaming heebee-jeebees, and I suspect that this\nattitude is why you&#39;re getting a fairly cold shoulder from implementers.\nShow them the real market need that you&#39;re filling and I imagine you&#39;ll get\na lot more of their attention.\n\n&quot;heebee-jeebees?&quot;  Srsly?\n\nI&#39;ve been trying to, but you are dismissing my needs as unimportant. I\nreally don&#39;t know how to put it in terms that you guys appreciate.\n\n&gt;&gt; I wasn&#39;t suggesting a plug-in for the cases you were talking about, but\nrather in general, if you have running code and demonstrated pain, asking to\nput something into a standard is a lot more reasonable.\n\nWhat about the case where I don&#39;t have running code because we can&#39;t\ncurrently do it?  I am trying to empower uses where people simply can&#39;t do\nthings  right now.\n\nThe irony is that if TBL had gotten this kind of resistance when he tried to\nlaunch the web it never would have happened because he couldn&#39;t demonstrate\nan existing use-case (Oh wait a minute, he DID get this kind of resistance\nfrom the IETF, and it almost killed the web stillborne.  Thank god it\ndidn&#39;t.)\n\nBTW, the only person I&#39;ve gotten resistance from on this besides Hixie is\nyou... :)\n\n&gt;&gt; That is certainly how people often try to misuse standards, yes. Just\nbecause something is a standard doesn&#39;t make it implemented or successful.\n\nOh I agree with that, not that it is relevant here...\n\n&gt;&gt; Try what I did with hinclude...\n&gt;&gt; Oh, wait, I already did that...\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you don&#39;t get the leverage...\n\nTypically when I advocate for things like this it is rarely because I want\nit for something I need to implement, it&#39;s because I believe that it could\nimprove things on a broad scale. Frequently people will say &quot;But you can\nimplement it yourself by doing &#39;x&#39;&quot; which totally misses the point.\n\nBut that misses the point; the most compelling use-cases are for where\nJavascript isn&#39;t available!\n\n&gt;&gt; The point is that you can&#39;t force a good idea on the market with a\nstandard; people have to want to use it.\n\nI&#39;ll agree with you completely there about not implementing something people\nwouldn&#39;t use. \n\nWhat I&#39;m having trouble with is that the benefits to using this are so\nobvious to me that I&#39;m having trouble understanding why they are not obvious\nto others. Using a templated URL structure vs query parameters makes URLs so\nmuch cleaner looking and understandable that I can&#39;t imagine people wouldn&#39;t\nflock to using this, if available.\n\nSo would it help if I could show you numerous examples where people are\nusing Javascript to accomplish this with forms? Would that be the &quot;pain&quot; you\nare looking for?\n\nThat said, what about the pain of not being able to crawl forms that use\nJavascript for this? Isn&#39;t that a compelling use case?\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve said about as much as I can about this without starting to babble\nabout standards theory, so I think I&#39;ll stop now.\n\nAs an aside, I&#39;d be interested in any reference you have that I can read up\non &quot;standard&#39;s theory.&quot;\n\n-Mike Schinkel \nhttp://mikeschinkel.com\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mark Nottingham [mailto:mnot@...] \nSent: Saturday, November 01, 2008 5:51 AM\nTo: Mike Schinkel\nCc: &#39;Ian Hickson&#39;; &#39;Jerome Louvel&#39;; whatwg@...; &#39;URI&#39;; &#39;REST\nDiscuss&#39;\nSubject: Re: [whatwg] Proposing URI Templates for WebForms 2.0\n\n*sigh* we seem to be talking past each other... despite appearances, I\nactually think this is a pretty good idea; I just am concerned about how\nyou&#39;re going about getting it accepted.\n\nOn 01/11/2008, at 8:16 PM, Mike Schinkel wrote:\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham&gt;&gt;Sorry, but no.

Your suggestion that the \n&gt; solution is to write a browser plug-in is about like suggesting I just \n&gt; pound sand although it is a bit less insulting. :-)\n\nI wasn&#39;t suggesting a plug-in for the cases you were talking about, but\nrather in general, if you have running code and demonstrated pain, asking to\nput something into a standard is a lot more reasonable.\n\n\n&gt; No one will use the syntax until enough people have the plugin, and \n&gt; nobody will install the plugin unless enough people are using the \n&gt; syntax; it&#39;s a catch-22. This type of thing is where standards are \n&gt; needed in advance.\n\nThat is certainly how people often try to misuse standards, yes. Just\nbecause something is a standard doesn&#39;t make it implemented or successful.\n\nTry what I did with hinclude &lt;http://www.mnot.net/javascript/hinclude/\n &gt;; write a javascript library to handle a declarative syntax, and have it\ngracefully degrade once the browsers handle it natively. If the markup is\ndeclarative, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in HTML5 or not, you still can cater\nto unintended uses.\n\nOh, wait, I already did that:\n&lt;http://www.mnot.net/javascript/template_form.js\n &gt;.\n\nSure, you don&#39;t get the leverage of having it in a mature standard, but if\nit&#39;s truly a good idea, you&#39;ll be able to convince people to use it without\nthat. The point is that you can&#39;t force a good idea on the market with a\nstandard; people have to want to use it.
