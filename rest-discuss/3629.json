I&#39;ve been following this REST vs. &quot;document style&quot; SOAP\n&gt;&gt; debate (I assume RPC style is dead on both sides), and I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; starting to think one of the advantages of REST is that you can\n&gt;&gt; actually create a hybrid web service that both human and machine\n&gt;&gt; can handle.\n&gt;&gt; [snip]\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a partial answer of the partial question I understood. Tell\n&gt; me if that&#39;s not the question.\n\nWell, it was more of an thought experiment on how to support\nuser&#39;s information activity by utilizing &quot;for machine&quot; WS, so\nI did not have specific model like B2C or B2B in my mind.\n\nI&#39;m using the word &quot;for-human WS&quot; as the current Web as it is\ntoday, and &quot;for-machine WS&quot; as an upcoming part of the Web\nwhere machines can do information processing. And I came to\nthink that hybrid, complementary use of these two will result\nin a synergy that brings better web experience. And from this\npoint of view, RESTfullness of a service does seems to matter,\nbecause in this case, &quot;for machine&quot; WS is actually part of\nexisting &quot;for human&quot; WS infrastructure (which is, RESTful).\n\n&gt; &quot;for person&quot; WS is similar to B2C (business to consumer). The\n&gt;  promise of WS to B2C may come much more in future, because of (1)\n&gt;  smaller market segmet, (2) lower utility, and (3) lack of clarity in\n&gt;  what it could solve in reality (remember, WS is not fully evolved).\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;for machine&quot; WS is similar to EDI, EAI or B2B (automated or\n&gt;  semi-automated to a large extent). The current era we are living in\n&gt;  WS (REST vs SOAP), I think, is about this mechanization of internet\n&gt;  (aka, Internet ver 2.0).\n\nYes, I agree current WS activity focuses more on B2B-like environment.\nIn such environment, machine-to-machine interoperation is the top\npriority, and humans are usually not in the scope of the problem.\n\nHowever, I disagree that human/machine hybrid style B2C (I&#39;m not\nsure if this is anything that we call B2C) has a lower utility.\nHuman is the ultimate target of productivity improvement, and so\nIMHO this is not anything less useful than B2B thing. But yes, it&#39;s\nprobably true that it has smaller market in capitalization value.\n\n-- \nTaisuke Yamada &lt;tai@...&gt;\nInternet Initiative Japan Inc., Technical Planning Division\n\n"}}
