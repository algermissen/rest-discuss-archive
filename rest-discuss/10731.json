So? I&#39;m a little confused. Should I just say\n&gt;&gt; that this part of my application doesn&#39;t fit the REST assumptions, so\n&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t even make sense talking about it? Or does it make sense to\n&gt;&gt; consider it under a different light?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It fits in just fine.  POST your draft to the real URL for your\n&gt; document instead of using PUT.  Clean up the submitted HTML in  \n&gt; whatever\n&gt; way the server would if the method were PUT.  You can return the  \n&gt; result\n&gt; at the real URL for your document, but with &#39;.draft&#39; appended, or\n&gt; &#39;/draft&#39;, whatever floats your boat.  Nothing like RPC.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n\n\n"}}
