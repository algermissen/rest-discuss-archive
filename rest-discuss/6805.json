I don&#39;t think this simplistic\n&gt; conversion could be fully functional. There would be warts and\n&gt; problematic non-equivalence. An RPC model manages state,\n&gt; identifiers, factories, and various other patterns differently from\n&gt; REST. But if we could eliminate the &quot;noise&quot; in the differences\n&gt; automatically, what we&#39;d be left with are the nuggets that really\n&gt; matter. And casual experimenters with REST would quickly get some\n&gt; key benefits -- no more stateful sessions, looser coupling between\n&gt; two ends of a comm pipe, and an end to the proliferation of methods\n&gt; and structures that have to be versioned.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does something like this already exist? If no, is it because I&#39;m\n&gt; being bone-headed? If I&#39;m not crazy, is anybody interested in\n&gt; collaborating on such a tool?\n\nI don&#39;t believe it&#39;s practical.  Taking an arbitrary RPC system and\nputting it on the Web is a very difficult task.  But more than\n&quot;difficult&quot;, it&#39;s *design*, and machines aren&#39;t very good at design.\nFor example, the URIs the tool would generate (e.g. if it found a\ngetFoo() method) would suck, because there&#39;s typically no way (and\ndefinitely no general way) to identify resources and their naming\nstructure via RPC interfaces (you&#39;re actually better off going\nstraight to the data).  As another example, the granularity of data\naccess normally needs to be designed, IME; getFoo() and getBar() on\nthe same object might be better off as two URIs, or as a single URI\nwhich returns both kinds of data (ala\n&lt;root&gt;&lt;Foo&gt;foo&lt;/Foo&gt;&lt;Bar&gt;bar&lt;/Bar&gt;&lt;/root&gt;).  There&#39;s many many other\nconsiderations.\n\nAs with any process though, you could certainly automate it.  But it\nwould be a *very* complex tool, requiring an exhorbitant amount of\nuser input ... which you&#39;d need a Web architect for, which kinda\ndefeats the purpose of the tool.\n\nBesides, if it worked, it would steal a good chunk of my business;\nthat makes it evil 8-)\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
