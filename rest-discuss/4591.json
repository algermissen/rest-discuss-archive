A connector presents an abstract interface for\n&gt; component communication, the generality of which enables substitutability:\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; if\n&gt; the users&#39; only access to the system is via an abstract interface, the\n&gt; IMPLEMENTATION can be replaced without impacting the users.\n\nWell, implementation substitution will result in a different application\nwhich should &quot;impact the users&quot;, but I suspect you just misspoke there.\n\n&gt; Now, resources can change over time but the semantics of the conceptual mapping\n&gt; to a set of entities is required to be static, since the semantics is what\n&gt; distinguishes one resource from another.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From what I understand, you guys are confusing the semantics of a request (as\n&gt; indicated by standard methods and media types) with the semantics of the\n&gt; mapping to a set of entities that is a resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think, this is what Roy meant in an earlier mail when he said:\n&gt; &quot;The interface is substitutable. Resources are not substitutable. Nobody has an\n&gt; expectation that you can replace one resource with a different resource and\n&gt; have continuation of semantics.&quot;\n\nRight, that&#39;s what I assumed he meant.  Like I said above, you&#39;ve\ncomposed a new application; &quot;different stuff happens&quot;, so to speak.\n\n&gt; In the case of performing a query over POST, the semantics of the request and\n&gt; therefore of the interaction between the components are uniform because nothing\n&gt; in the response control data was non-uniform and completely covered in REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that REST does not say anything about resource expectations being uniform,\n&gt; it just talks constrains connector/component interfaces.\n\nOf course.\n\n&gt; So when you say:\n&gt; &quot;If you write a client application that presumes the resource returned in the\n&gt; Location header is a query result, and attempt to do further processing based\n&gt; on that presumption, your client will fail against arbitrary resources.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; What you guys are talking about is the semantics of the mapping to a set of\n&gt; entities that is a resource and not the semantics of the interface.\n\nNope, we&#39;re definitely talking about the interface, and specifically a\nnuance of POST semantics.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s like saying that if I expect a java applet from a GET request to a\n&gt; specific resource I should expect a java applet at any other arbitrary\n&gt; resource!\n\nYes, that would be very silly!\n\n&gt; What am I missing?\n\nHopefully that&#39;s explained in one of my other messages on this subject.\nI&#39;m not sure I could do a better job at explaining it by trying again.\n\n&gt; Mark: I am not a fan of SOA!\n\nMy mistake!
