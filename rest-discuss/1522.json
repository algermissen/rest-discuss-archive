As I mentioned before, I have a\n&gt; pre-developed set of resource types, namely methods, components, topics, queues,\n&gt; etc that are published in a node&#39;s hierarchical namespace.  \n\nI guess the basic question is whether you *need* method objects. A\nREST-purist view would be that you should use methods as an\nimplementation technique to implement a resource view of the world.\nSince I don&#39;t know what method objects you have, I can&#39;t\nresource-decompose them. But in most cases you will want an action to\nhave a side-effect that creates a resource+URI, and you will want the\nnewly created resource to be in some container. So you can instead use a\nPOST on the container.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; HTTP PUT - instead of getting a pre-existing resource like the one above, it\n&gt; allows you to effectively copy a resource in its current state to another node.\n&gt; You are effectively publishing it on the destination node.\n\nIt&#39;s not clear to me how you can copy a method. After all, the real\nmethod is the programming code behind it. And that code will depend on a\ncomplex network of other state. So PUT-ting to a method resource doesn&#39;t\nmake much sense to me.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
