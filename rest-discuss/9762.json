In other words:\n\n&quot;I am wrestling with how to manipulate the many-to-many associations\nbetween two resources when these associations are not properties of the\noriginal resources and are implicitly created when the original\nresources are created.&quot;\n\nAm I correct?\n\n&gt; For me[,] getting the uri form right relates to how I model the objects and express this modeling as RESTful resources.\n\nThe URIs that you expose and the methods that your origin server permits\non the corresponding resources are your model. Whatever you do behind\nthe curtain to implement that model is your private business. You can\nlet the latter rule the former, but why would you?\n\n&gt; In this thread I&#39;m working out a model for [RESTful] access to an element of my domain that I didn&#39;t see any existing design patterns for.\n\nIn this thread you&#39;ve gotten the suggestion to expose the associations\nas resources. Let me advance another suggestion, albeit one that I\nprefer less than I prefer exposing the associations as resources.\nSuppose that you have\nsubject 5, &lt;http://www.example/subject-5&gt;;\nsubject 20, &lt;http://www.example/subject-20&gt;;\nactivity 18, &lt;http://www.example/activity-18&gt;;\na list of activities related to subject 5,\n&lt;http://www.example/subject-5/activities&gt;;\na list of activities related to subject 20,\n&lt;http://www.example/subject-20/activities&gt;;\na list of subjects related to activity 18,\n&lt;http://www.example/activity-18/subjects&gt;.\nSuppose that you have a user agent which has RESTfully discovered\nthe subjects,\nthe activity,\nthe lists,\nthe relationship between subject 5 and its list of activities,\nthe relationship between subject 20 and its list of activities,\nthe relationship between activity 18 and its list of subjects.\nSuppose that the representations of the subjects and of the activity\nhave an expiration date that allows the relationships to hold throughout\nthe examples to come.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nGET http://www.example/subject-5/activities HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:00 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\nIn the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent discovers that subject 5\nhas no related activities.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nGET http://www.example/subject-20/activities HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:01 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\nIn the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent discovers that subject 20\nhas no related activities.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nGET http://www.example/activity-18/subjects HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:02 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\nIn the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent discovers that activity\n18 has no related subjects.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nPOST http://www.example/subject-5/activities HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 32\n\nhttp://www.example/activity-18\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:03 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Location: http://www.example/subject-5/activities\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 32\n\nhttp://www.example/activity-18\n\nIn the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent adds activity 18 to the\nlist of activities that relate to subject 5.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nGET http://www.example/activity-18/subjects HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:04 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 30\n\nhttp://www.example/subject-5\n\nEureka! In the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent discovers that\nactivity 18 relates to subject 5. What the user agent does not know and\ndoes not need to know is that the origin server amended a list of\nsubjects in reaction to an amendment to a list of activities.\n\nConsider the following HTTP exchange between the user agent and the\norigin server listening on TCP port 80 of Internet host www.example.\n\nPOST http://www.example/activity-18/subjects HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 31\n\nhttp://www.example/subject-20\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:00:05 GMT\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, TRACE\nContent-Location: http://www.example/activity-18/subjects\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 61\n\nhttp://www.example/subject-5\nhttp://www.example/subject-20\n\nIn the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent adds subject 20 to the\nlist of subjects that relate to activity 18.\n\nCan you guess what comes next?

In the foregoing HTTP exchange, the user agent discovers\nthat subject 20 relates to activity 18. What the user agent does not\nknow and does not need to know is that the origin server amended a list\nof activities in reaction to an amendment to a list of subjects.\n\nBefore listing the exchanges, I wrote that I prefer exposing the\nassociations as resources. One reason for my preference is the ease of\ndenying (removing, ending, ...) an association when the association is\naddressable. In the scenario that I prefer, denying an association\nrequires nothing more than a &quot;DELETE&quot; request. This operation is O(1);\nrepeating this operation is clean and easy. In the scenario that I\nelaborated, denying an association requires a &quot;PUT&quot; request to submit a\nlist which excludes the indication of the target association. The\noperation is O(n) and involves race conditions, causing undue headache\nfor all parties.\n\n-- \nEtan Wexler.\n\n\n"}}
