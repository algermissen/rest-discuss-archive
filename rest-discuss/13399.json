Say, I want to clear my shopping cart, so I delete it.\n&gt; However, when I GET it later on, it simply says that it&#39;s empty\n&gt; rather than it doesn&#39;t exist.\n\nNo. Don’t overload the meaning of verbs to use them for\n“something similar”. DELETE has narrow semamtics; if your use\ndoes not preserve them, then you should not be using DELETE.\n\n&gt; The reason why I don&#39;t use PUT is that I don&#39;t want to allow\n&gt; direct modification as a result of some assertion to the state\n&gt; of the resource other than clearing it.\n\nThere is no reason you have to accept all PUTs. HTTP is not\na filesystem. Off the top of my head I would say you could\nimplement this as a PUT that returns 409 for (at least\nsemantically) non-empty bodies (except the ones that would be\nno-ops, possibly).\n\n----\n\nAll in all it sounds to me like you are trying to model your\nproblem in a way that goes somewhat against the grain of HTTP.\nWhat is it you are actually trying to do?\n\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
