NOTIFY is &quot;touch.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; No because NOTIFY may result in a change in the\n&gt; thing being notified.  Touch simply causes the\n&gt; date to change.\n\nAnd that&#39;s specifically what WD-Proxy&#39;s NOTIFY does --- though in fact\nit&#39;s sort of the reverse of touch.  Proxy A has a cached version of\n/bar from origin server www.foo.com.  When /bar changes, the origin\nserver www.foo.com sends a message to Proxy A:\n\nwww.foo.com -&gt; Proxy A\n-----------------------------\nNOTIFY http://www.foo.com/bar HTTP/1.1\n\nthereby invalidating your copy.  (&quot;You&quot; being Proxy A.)  Admittedly it\ndoesn&#39;t actually change the modification time of your copy;  rather, it\nlets you know that the actual resource on the origin server has been\nmodified since your original GET request.\n\n&gt; E.g. Suppose I go to a web site and think that\n&gt; a binary is out of date with respect to the\n&gt; source. I NOTIFY on the URL of the binary and the\n&gt; server may retrieve the source and recompile IF\n&gt; the source is more recent than the binary.\n\nI think you misundertand the NOTIFY pattern;  re-read the WD-Proxy\nspec.  You don&#39;t NOTIFY a resource on an origin server, you GET that\nresource with appropriate headers and then the origin server generates\na NOTIFY to you, &quot;touching&quot; your cached representation to tell you it&#39;s\nbeen modified on the origin server.\n\nAt any rate, the semantics of NOTIFY are entirely related to relative\nmodification times, similar to &quot;touch,&quot; not anything nearly as complex\nas make&#39;s dependencies and refreshing.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
