It seems natural that you would want to identify a resource and tell\n&gt; it to take an action.  Some examples:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on\n&gt;    http://www.google.com/search?topic=&quot;juice-machines&quot;\n\nYou&#39;ve identified two resources - what part tells it to take an action? and\nwhat action does it take?\n\nhttp://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on could test whether the unit was\non or not. It could toggle the power. It could set the power on, lots of\nthings.\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?topic=&quot;juice-machines&quot; - what is it you are\nsearching for within the &#39;juice-machines&#39; topic? Or does it return\ntrue/false if the topic exists?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Verb-oriented URLs are very program-friendly.  For example, a program\n&gt; to control devices in my house might look like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/connect-to-central-computer\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/adjust-temp?value=68\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/stereo/on\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/stereo/play-cd?cd=Timeless-Serenity\nWhat verb is this? It seems more like a &#39;closure&#39; - binding action and data\ninto a single opaque &#39;invokable&#39; object.\nIt looks more like these URI are reflections of procedural instructions.\nThey look to be dependent on the correct sequence to operate correctly. Can\nyou adjust the temp before visiting the &#39;on&#39; URL? Having sequence dependency\nis an issue in networked apps regardless of what paradigm you are taking.\n\n&gt;\nFor me it is more program friendly to have something like:\n home.server = &quot;http://www.my-home.org/&quot;;\n home.put(&quot;air-conditioning/power,&quot;on&quot;);\n home.put(&quot;air-conditioning/temp&quot;,&quot;68&quot;);\n home.put(&quot;stereo/power&quot;,&quot;on&quot;);\n home.put(&quot;stereo/current-album&quot;,&quot;Timeless-Serenity&quot;);\n\nIf you wanted api based access, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to define objects with\nnamed properties where each property maps to a URI. You could then have the\nclient do something like:\n home.airConditioner.power = &quot;on&quot;;\n home.airConditioner.temp = &quot;68&quot;;\n home.stereo.power = &quot;on&quot;;\n home.stereo.album = &quot;Timeless-Serenity&quot;;\n\nThe benefit would be that you could also query the current values with the\nsame object/property structures.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t do the &#39;connect-to-central-computer&#39; because I wouldn&#39;t trust\nthat my-home.org would maintain that connection, or that it wouldn&#39;t crash,\netc.\n\n\n&gt; 3. Unilaterally prohibiting functions as URI-accessible makes the Web\n&gt; less friendly and useable, as I will need to contort things to get\n&gt; around this constraint.  Imagine doing the above using just nouns.\nI always do - its easy, very simple and powerful.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Note the last element, &lt;AddToCart href=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;.  The URL in the href\n&gt; attribute:\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://parts-depot.com/parts/00345/add-to-cart\n&gt;\n&gt; clearly contains a verb, add-to-cart.\nI thought it clearly contained the verb &quot;parts&quot;. Or maybe it was verb 345. I\nforget.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a couple of thoughts about this design:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. If the HTTP method for the above URL is GET then it is violating the\n&gt; principle that all GETs should be side-effect free.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. One of the principles of REST is that the client should maintain\n&gt; his/her own state.  The server should not do so.  The above approach has\n&gt; the server maintaining state about the client.\nYes - it looks like the add-to-cart URI doesn&#39;t know which shopping cart to\nadd that part to. It&#39;d be easier to have the client explicity ask for a\nshopping cart and repeatedly add (POST) part references to it. You&#39;d get\ninto the non-idempotent issue though - if you POST twice, did you really\nmean to add two items or was it a transmission problem? It&#39;s probably better\nto just transfer a complete representation of the clients PO.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s an alternative solution.  The client creates a Purchase Order\n&gt; (PO) which identifies the parts he/she is interested in purchasing.\n&gt; When the client finds a part that he/she is interested in, the client\n&gt; will add that part number to the PO.  When the client is ready he/she\n&gt; submits the PO.  Some things to note:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. The PO represents the &quot;shopping cart&quot;.\n&gt; 2. The PO is composed on the client side, not the server side.\n&gt;\n&gt; This second design seems to be more in the spirit of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those are the two ways that I see for implementing the purchase parts\n&gt; Web service.  Are there other (better) ways?  Any comments?  /Roger\nThe server can maintain the PO and the client can incrementally update this.\nProvide a unique identifier for it & things will be fine (other than more\nmessages being exchanged & idempotency issues).\n\nHaving the client accumulate a single PO with multiple line items probably\nmakes more sense if you can code the client yourself though. Not all\nfinancial systems make it easy to update POs directly.\n\n\n\n"}}
