RWS-RMS (Resource Model Space) describes what \nresources a webservice exposes and RWS-IL (Interface Language). You \ncan have many webservices each with their own RWS-RMS document \n(explaining where their resources are located) but sharing the same \nRWS-IL document explaining what you can do to thos resources.\n\nI&#39;ve spent the last 2 weeks tackling this problem of describing \nwebservices and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem that should be solved \ncompletely just yet. Reasons:\n\n1) There&#39;s still no elegant way to describe an XML document&#39;s \nstructure. I consider XML-Schema unusable and there&#39;s zero tool \nsupport for RELAX-NG. I&#39;ve been investigating schematron which looks \nsomewhat simpler but convoluted.\n\n2) There are several issues with auto-proxy generation and REST, \nparticularly: should it be done at all? I&#39;ve been thinking a lot \nabout it this. PaulPrescod has mentioned part of the value of REST is \nthat it forces developers to acknowledge the network and deal with \nthe kind-of-low-level-stuff like response codes. I think he may be \nright to an extent but I&#39;m not sure.\n\nBetween 1 and 2 it&#39;s hard to make much progress. For now, I&#39;d agree \nwith Roger: the best way to describe your webservice in a truly \nmeaningful manner that will be accessible to the greatest number of \npeople is to use HTML and document it.\n\n- itdp\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Matt Gushee &lt;mgushee@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi, all--\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering what people are thinking about the best ways to \ndescribe\n&gt; RESTful Web Services to clients and/or people, and how to access \nthose\n&gt; descriptions. Shortly after I joined this list there was a good \ndeal of \n&gt; discussion of Paul&#39;s WRDL effort ... and as I recall, there was \nsome \n&gt; sense that perhaps we should be trying to improve WSDL instead of\n&gt; reinventing the wheel ... and then the whole topic seems to have \nbeen\n&gt; abandoned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, I realize that there have been a variety of threads that\n&gt; touched on the description/documentation issue, but there has been \nno\n&gt; concerted effort to tackle it head-on for quite a while. I&#39;m not \nsure\n&gt; whether that means everyone thinks it&#39;s too early to try to reach\n&gt; consensus, or people just aren&#39;t terribly concerned about it, or \nwhat.\n&gt; Yet it seems to me that being able to say &quot;this is how you get\n&gt; information about resources&quot; will help REST gain credibility (okay, \n&gt; the critics love it already, but will it play in Peoria?), while \n&gt; providing some valuable guidance for implementors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not about to suggest that we immediately lurch into a WSDL-like\n&gt; standards-making effort. But might it not be a good idea to have a\n&gt; semi-coherent collection of best practices for service description?\n&gt; \n&gt; Or have I missed something?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Matt Gushee\n&gt; Englewood, Colorado, USA\n&gt; mgushee@h...\n&gt; http://www.havenrock.com/\n\n\n"}}
