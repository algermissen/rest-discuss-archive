Whether or not his intended resource is, in fact, the one\nidentified by the URI (by means of the owner maintaining the mapping)\nis unknown to that link-maker.\n\nIt gets worse: over time, if the majority of link-makers have a \ndifferent\nopinion about the nature of the resource being identified than the \nowner,\nthey might change the owner&#39;s opinion as well.  [oh, you mention that \nlater]\n\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen the idea of URIs indirectly identifying resources used \n&gt; in\n&gt; the context of REST before, that&#39;s why I asked what you (or REST) mean \n&gt; by\n&gt; it.\n\nHmm, well, from my point of view, the idea that &quot;http&quot; URIs are ever\nused to directly identify anything is a bit absurd.  The interface is\nthere to hide the nature of what is behind it, and it cannot do that\nvery well if the clients have to know what it is.\n\n&gt; The practical problem I have is this:\n&gt;\n&gt; The moment a user agent sends a request to the origin server, any \n&gt; &#39;indirection\n&gt; information&#39; is lost due to REST&#39;s unique addressing context. \n&gt; Certainly,\n&gt; the origin server &#39;knows&#39; what resource the URI (directly) identifies \n&gt; because\n&gt; that is controlled by the naming authority. But all intermediaries \n&gt; have no way\n&gt; of seeing/accessing any information about indirection in \n&gt; identification.\n\nThe server doesn&#39;t know either -- it relies on the human maintainer to \nknow\nwell enough to set up the correct mechanism for the mapping.\n\n&gt; I read about the idea (thanks Mark!) that intermediaries can provide\n&gt; information about the resources that the URIs identify they see in \n&gt; requests\n&gt; &#39;running through&#39; them and weave that information into the \n&gt; representation\n&gt; returned to the user agent. It was then that I understood the \n&gt; advantages of\n&gt; a unique addressing context, because the intermediary knows that a \n&gt; given\n&gt; URI unambiguously identifies a single resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Given the idea of &#39;indirect identification&#39; the question arises, how\n&gt; intermediaries can usefully enhance representations with information \n&gt; they\n&gt; obtained, for example, from an RDF document.\n\nThey can only state what they know, and that very carefully.  Just like\nreal life, an intermediary must either state only what it has observed\nin the past, or state its predictions on the future in terms that make\nclear they are only guesses based on past observations.\n\n&gt; I like the collaboration idea, which seems to come down to the \n&gt; possibility\n&gt; that many *indirect* identifications can affect/alter a naming \n&gt; authority&#39;s\n&gt; decision about the *direct* identification. Wonder how intermediaries \n&gt; can\n&gt; contribute to this process.\n\nThat is one of the main weaknesses of HTTP -- there is no way for a\nproxy to distinguish between authoritative responses and ones that\nit cooked up on its own.\n\nI&#39;ll be in England this week, so no more from me on this thread.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
