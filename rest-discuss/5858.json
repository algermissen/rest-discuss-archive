You can&#39;t just  \n&gt; replace one with the other. It does matter to the user which one you  \n&gt; give them, and what they want depends on the situation. The server  \n&gt; needs to negotiate with the *user*, not the user agent, to figure out  \n&gt; what representation they want in each specific situation. For non- \n&gt; commodities, I believe the best way to do that is to give them a  \n&gt; different URI for each, because then the user can express his or her  \n&gt; wishes with a click.\n\nI think all the issue here is mainly due to browser limitations, as they\ndoesn&#39;t allow the user to easily swith conneg preferences. The more I\nread discussions or I am involved in service design, the more I think\nabout making a Firefox extention displaying some info about the\navailable conneg on the page (Accept / Vary header ?) and providing some\nmenu of field to change settings for the current page only. Some\nextentions already display Header fields, but I&#39;m not aware of a\n&quot;switcher&quot; extention, except the ones allowing to fully customize\nheader, which is not so user friendly.\n\nAn other approach to your PDF problem could be the browser set\nautomaticaly the Accept header to &quot;application/postscript,\napplication/pdf, text/html;q=0.8,text/*;q=0.5;*/*;q=0.1&quot; and reGET the\npage when clicking on &quot;print&quot;.\n\nFor the &quot;send link&quot; and bookmark issue, you can always send a redirect\nbased on conneg, if each version has is own uri.\n\n"}}
