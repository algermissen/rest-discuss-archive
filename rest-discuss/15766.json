The usual (and orthogonal to REST-or-not) answer is that you rather do those things with compensations anyway. 2PC is an illusion.\n&gt;\n\nCompensation is 2PC.  And often does not work.\n\nThere is no solution for distributed agreement between more than 2\nparticipants that does not take at least 2 phases, altho they may be\ndisguised by clever naming (e.g.. &quot;compensation&quot;).\n\nI quit working on solutions for this problem on this list when Roy\nruled out RESTful transactions, and so will not belabor the issue more\nnow.\n\n"}}
