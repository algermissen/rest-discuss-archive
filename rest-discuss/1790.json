Perhaps you could talk about that a bit?\n\nI was mostly refering to RDF being used by DAML+OIL.  I want to use \nDAML+OIL to help describe what the XML is marking up.  That way, as our \nschemas evolve, my code can remain flexible in handling the XML.  My \ncode would be written to understand DAML+OIL classes, instead of raw \nXML.  It&#39;s an attempt to get away from hardcoding our application for \nparticular schemas.  I want the application to understand problem \ndomains, not particular object hierarchies.\n\n\n&gt; Make sure instances of some schema embed a reference to an immutable copy of\n&gt; their schema.  It also helps to have named, declarative descriptions of\n&gt; transformations between schema versions that can be referenced...  In XML,\n&gt; for instance, this could perhaps be an XSLT that transforms XML schemas.\n\nIn an all XML world, XSLT helps greatly to move me from schema to \nschema, especially when the data document references a schema version. \nUnfortunately, we&#39;re bound to C++ and its available libraries for these \nthings seem to be sparse.\n\nBut in a perfect world.... :)\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
