PUT and DELETE are both\nfunctions whose ranges consists of a single element.  The range of DELETE is\nthe &quot;unmapped&quot; resource, while the range of the function PUTX, where &#39;X&#39; is\ndesignated end-state, is obviously just X.  And GET is just an identity:\nGET(x)=x (in the side-effect sense).  These relations don&#39;t even require the\nterm f(f(x)) to describe them.\n\nThe very notion of &quot;sequences of idempotent functions&quot; is peculiar because\nit is void of any idempotence test cases.  In other words, to construct a\n&quot;sequence&quot; like g(f) you rule out f(f).\n\nCertainly we can rework the model to correctly represent the behaviors of\nGET, PUT and DELETE.  When we do, I&#39;m predicting that your assumption and\nproof will be reinforced.  But I thought it would be interesting to show how\ncompositions on idempotent functions worked in the abstract.  At least we\nhave some idea of where Roy was coming from.\n\nIn other words, the spec addresses idempotence as a property of interest to\nclients.  Extension to HTTP may want to include other idempotent methods\nwhich are less constrained than the present ones, and for which Roy&#39;s caveat\nwould apply.\n\nAlloy is available to the public at http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/, and\nthere&#39;s also a yahoo group for it: alloy-discuss.\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Miles Sabin\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSent: 9/21/2002 2:14 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Roy was right\n\nWalden Mathews wrote,\n&gt; Ok, you&#39;ll find attached the pdf file generated by Alloy.  The\n&gt; functions f, g and h are all idempotent: they satisfy the constraint\n&gt;\n&gt;     fun(fun(x)) = fun(x) for all x mapped by fun (plug f, g and h in\n&gt; for &#39;fun&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; The analyzer was asked to generate a counterexample to the claim that\n&gt; there is no x such that f(g(h(f(g(h(x))))))) = f(g(h(x))), and it\n&gt; found one.  The reason it&#39;s not intuitive is that we need at least 6\n&gt; nodes for this condition to occur.\n\nFascinating! Good stuff ...\n\nThat said, this doesn&#39;t actually settle the issue. The problem is that \nGET, PUT and DELETE are more constrained than f, g and h in your model. \nFor example, a function modelling GET should never generate a state \ntransition ... and all of the fn&#39;s in your counter-example violate that \nconstraint.\n\nPUT and DELETE are, I think, also more constrained, in that,\n\n  PUT /foo\n  DELETE /foo\n\nis equivalent to,\n\n  DELETE /foo\n\nand,\n\n  DELETE /foo\n  PUT /foo\n\nis equivalent to,\n\n  PUT /foo\n\nand again, all of the fn&#39;s in your counter-example violate those \nconstraints too.\n\nAll three of these constraints played an essential role in my proof, so \nit&#39;d help either if you could produce a new model which respects them, \nor if we could provide a rationale for why it&#39;s OK to violate them.\n\nBTW, is Alloy publicly available? Having seen the results I&#39;d be \ninterested in playing with it.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
