It *is* useful to you because it is *effectively* idempotent.\nBecause you probably don&#39;t do anywhere near 1000 hits per day. If you\nneeded to do somewhere between 500-1500 hits per day, you would probably\noffer Google money for a service that would allow you to get back to\n&quot;effective idempotence.&quot; After all, a service that regularly craps out on\nyou sometime in the afternoon is hardly something you can trust and build\nimportant applications on.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
