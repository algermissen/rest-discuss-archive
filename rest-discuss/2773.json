This will cause a URL to be generated of the format\n&gt; &gt; ?col1=on&col3=on&col7=on\n&gt; &gt; This URI identifies a resource which is that particular permutation \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; column names. This can be easily rendered into HTML\n&gt; &gt; Of course, using a FORM literally might not be the most chrome \n&gt; looking UI,\n&gt; &gt; so let your script kiddies go nuts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the parameters that you&#39;re passing are always of the same &#39;type&#39; \n&gt; (a column, here), I&#39;d be inclined to put all selected columns in the \n&gt; one parameter:\n&gt; \n&gt; /viewer?columns=foo,bar,bob,harriet\n&gt; \n&gt; You can also rewrite your links that update the view:\n&gt; \n&gt; heres a link in your control pane that selects the column called foo:\n&gt; /viewdb?columns=foo\n&gt; this one assumes you have no columns already selected.\n&gt; \n&gt; when you update the view pane, you also update the control pane\n&gt; so that all of the links are rewritten.  Here&#39;s the href for \n&gt; selected a column called bar, with the foo column already selected\n&gt; /viewer?columns=foo,bar\n&gt; another column called bob has a href like so:\n&gt; /viewer?columns=foo,bob\n&gt; \n&gt; this way also means that you don&#39;t need to maintain state in a\n&gt; session variable, which some of the people around here consider a\n&gt; bad thing.  Using it or not, however, depends on whether you want to\n&gt; maintain a user&#39;s view across browser sessions, as Mike mentions \n&gt; below (although as this is entirely a GET scenario, you could\n&gt; provide a link that bookmarks a particular view, keeping your 256 \n&gt; byte limit in mind.  Your parent frameset would of course have to \n&gt; process that URL to create the control and view panes...)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; b) use persistent data on the server to maintain state\n&gt; &gt; If this information should be long-lived, have the server maintain \n&gt; a URI\n&gt; &gt; that doesn&#39;t change and is unique for that user (in the same sense \n&gt; that a\n&gt; &gt; session variable is unique to a user). When the left hand panel \n&gt; POSTs data\n&gt; &gt; to that URI, keep updating the selected columns and return a \n&gt; representation\n&gt; &gt; of the table with the users current set of selected columns.\n&gt; &gt; This is nice if the purpose of the app is to later use that \n&gt; selected &#39;db\n&gt; &gt; view&#39; in some way - perhaps to modify attributes (like &#39;max rows&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; something), as well as this approach makes that &#39;db view&#39; an \n&gt; identifable\n&gt; &gt; concept so you could do something like &#39;show me db #2 with view #27&#39;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; mike\n&gt; \n\n"}}
