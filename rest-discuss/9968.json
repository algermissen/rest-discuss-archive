wrote:\n&gt; IMO, personalization changes the answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; For instance, take Amazon&#39;s product pages. Each product has a URI that\n&gt; uniquely identifies it. But each URI has a zillion representations\n&gt; based on who is asking for the resource. Each user sees the same\n&gt; product information except that it has recommendations and other links\n&gt; specific to the user. When I bookmark the page to del.ico.us, or email\n&gt; it to another user, the URI still resolves to the same product, but\n&gt; with a personalized representation. To me, this is completely RESTful\n&gt; and does not require user-specific URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 1, 2007, at 1:20 PM, Elliotte Rusty Harold wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pkeane wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does it follow that personalization can BEST be achieved by having a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cookie that contains the user&#39;s id sit on the browser and used to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; construct URLs for XMLHTTPRequests (e.g.,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://example.com/userdata/{user-id}) that will return data to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; inserted into the page?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Note that I do not want the user-id to be included in the url for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the page\n&gt; &gt;&gt; itself (e.g. http://example.com/home). I am assuming that the login\n&gt; &gt;&gt; process, which can use HTTP Auth, will give the server the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; opportunity to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; set the cookie at the start of the login &#39;session&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re breaking REST then. One fundamental principle is that the URI\n&gt; &gt; identifies the resource, nothing else. Addressing and authentication\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; two separate concerns, and you&#39;re mixing them up. Personalized\n&gt; &gt; resources\n&gt; &gt; require personalized URLs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The personalized URLs don&#39;t actually have to contain the user name if\n&gt; &gt; that bothers you for some reason. However they do have to be unique to\n&gt; &gt; the user for whom the data is personalized.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It gets a little tricky when, as you describe here, one page contains\n&gt; &gt; resources accumulated from multiple URLs, but full REST requires that\n&gt; &gt; the page itself still have a unique, identifiable URL. The more you\n&gt; &gt; move\n&gt; &gt; away from this the less well the Web will work for you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; &gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
