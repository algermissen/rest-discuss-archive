This does not mean that in HTTP, a file must be replaced in\n&gt;&gt; the filesystem, a la WebDAV.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, I&#39;ll repeat it once more: PUT in WebDAV has exactly the same\n&gt; semantics as in HTTP. That is, WebDAV does not change the definition of\n&gt; PUT. PUT is what RFC2616 says it is, nothing else.\n&gt;\n\nYou&#39;ve lost me again, Julian.  You are saying I am wrong about what, \nnow?  Did I somewhere make a claim that WebDAV&#39;s use of PUT has \nsemantics other than replace?  Are you saying that somehow, the \nsemantics of a WebDAV PUT are different from the semantics of an FTP \nSTOR?  Where have I claimed that an HTTP PUT should have different \nsemantics than a WebDAV PUT?  Your point eludes me here.\n\nHTTP PUT == WebDAV PUT == FTP STOR == replacement semantics.  Not \nmerge semantics!  This is the essence of a Uniform Interface, is \nit not?\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
