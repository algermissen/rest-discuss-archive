An \nextended version of the same talk would /only/ introduce the WEB and \nbasic HTTP methods in limited examples; probably not include such \ndetails as status codes and headers to avoid muddying the waters.\n\nHaving given this talk (or similar) a couple of times, I can vouch for \nthe effectiveness of communicating the essential aspects of the style \nwithout (much) reference to implementation. In one instance, I used \nCREATE, READ, WRITE and REMOVE in place of POST, GET, PUT and DELETE to \ngreat success. It was clear, of course, to several members of the \naudience what was going on.\n\n\n- Elias\n\n"}}
