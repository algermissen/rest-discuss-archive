Now I think a URI doesn&#39;t exist &quot;per se&quot; (or \nexisting &quot;per se&quot; it points to nowhere, identifies nothing, for me is \nthe same as &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; in the sense it doesn&#39;t have a representation) \nso when I said &quot;delete the URI&quot; I should have said &quot;disassociate the URI \nfrom the resource&quot; to be accurate.\n\nEbenezer Ikonne wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not miss that.  I&#39;m just saying that I don&#39;t believe a DELETE \n&gt; &quot;deletes&quot; a URI as one could infer from your original statement.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/6/26 Ant�nio Mota &lt;amsmota@... &lt;mailto:amsmota@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been following all the thread, but the\n&gt;     question here was using\n&gt;     a DELETE  in a way that a subsequent GET would return a 200.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Ebenezer Ikonne wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &gt; I&#39;m not trying to argue in favour of one interpretation or\n&gt;         the other,\n&gt;         &gt; but for me feels &quot;strange&quot; a DELETE that deletes the\n&gt;         resource and not\n&gt;         &gt; it&#39;s URI. What is worth a URI without representation? What\n&gt;         does it\n&gt;         &gt; identifies?\n&gt;\n&gt;         It may feel &quot;strange&quot; like pineapple slices as a pizza topping\n&gt;         does to me, but it&#39;s not wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;         The URI is the &quot;pointer&quot; to the resource, not the resource\n&gt;         itself. Issuing a DELETE should remove the resource\n&gt;         (technically not the URI) and a GET to the resource using that\n&gt;         URI should return a 404 (although I could see a use case for 410).\n&gt;\n&gt;         Having said all this, I wouldn&#39;t use DELETE.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Eb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
