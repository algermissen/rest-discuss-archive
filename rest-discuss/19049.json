Bowman wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t know your requirements, but I&#39;d wait until the desired feature\n&gt; (Atom serialized as JSON) actually exists before implementing it, rather\n&gt; than trying to hit a moving target.  Once application/atom+json is\n&gt; nailed down, it&#39;s easy enough to add in support to please client\n&gt; developers, without the extra complexity of supporting legacy code.\n&gt; Client developers can then remove their transformation layer, and change\n&gt; their Accept: header to request atom+json instead of atom+xml.\n\nis there an ongoing activity for this? afaict, many people want to use \natom&#39;s model in JSON, and many create custom mappings. the problem with \na standard is that atom is fairly tightly narrowed to XML, in particular \nwhen you look at its extension model, and it seems to me the two \nfundamental options you have are both not that appealing (which i think \nis why we do not have atom in JSON yet):\n\n- leave out the complicated XMLy parts and end up with something that is \nonly a subset of atom&#39;s model and thus cannot represent all possible \natom+xml documents. not good.\n\n- map everything to JSON and end up with sometimes horrible JSON, in \nparticular when people use extensions and these extensions contain XML \nmarkup. not good.\n\ni am just curious (because you recommended to &quot;wait&quot;) how you think this \ndilemma will be solved, and whether you know about an activity where \npeople are actively working on a solution.\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
