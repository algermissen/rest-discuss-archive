I think our computers will need all \nthe help they can get.\n\n&gt; I see a parallel between this subject and the subject of &#39;reliable\n&gt; messaging&#39;\n&gt; as the substrate for reliable applications.  Do you see my analogy\n&gt; clearly, or should I elaborate?\n\nYes I think there is a parallel,\nbut please do elaborate, because\nassumptions aren&#39;t working very well\nin this arena.\n\n\n"}}
