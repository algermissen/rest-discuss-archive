In other threads, I&#39;ve seen reference to the idea of \nresources having multiple representations, but the examples always \nseem to assume that the choice of representation to serve is based on \nthe type of user agent or some other kind of http header information.\nWhile this makes sense to me when I&#39;m able to write my own user agent \nand set whatever headers I want, it doesnt help much when I have to \nuse a browser as my UA.\n\nSo my question is, is it reasonable to encode information in the URL \nthat indicates the desired representation?\n\nFor example, a GET of http://server.com/users/userid would return\na page listing the attributes of the user identified by userid.  I \ncall this the &#39;default&#39; view for this resource.  I also have the need\nfor an &#39;edit&#39; view.  The edit view is similar to the default view \nexcept that it is presented as a form so as to allow the values of the \nattributes to be edited (and then submitted for update).\n\nThat I want to submit the update as a POST to \nhttp://server.com/users/userid seems obvious.  However its not so \nobvious to me that a GET of http://server.com/users/userid?mode=edit \nis the way to implement my edit view.\n\nI&#39;m not sure why I have a problem with this.  A colleague suggested I \nmight feel better about it if I was more consistent:\n\nFor the default view:\nhttp://server.com/users/userid?mode=view\n\nFor the edit view:\nhttp://server.com/users/userid?mode=edit\n\nThis doesnt seem much better.  I can&#39;t really say why - except to say \nthat it feels wrong to be embedding that kind of information in the \nURL.  Then again, maybe I&#39;m making a mountain out of a mole-hill.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
