(that is what you&#39;re\n&gt; saying, right? i mean, you should be able to dereference all links)\n\nthe assumption for &#39;describedby&#39; is that when you follow the link, you \nfind a description resource. there is no such thing as &#39;automatic link \nfollowing&#39;, but the link relation can tell you what typical interactions \nlook like. for &#39;describedby&#39;, it&#39;s following the link. for &#39;profile&#39;, \nit&#39;s comparing the link target to known identifiers. maybe reading \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#profiles helps?\n\n&gt; This description makes me think that although describedby is not very\n&gt; specific, it can be very well used to point out what type of constraints\n&gt; this resource/media-type abides (e.g. json schema) - while you could\n&gt; very well have only a literal description in plain text.\n\nyes, it could. and there&#39;s always some leeway in deciding how generic a \nlink relation should be (you want some level of reusability, but also \nsome level of defined semantics). you could use &#39;describedby&#39; to link to \nschemas/types, like you say, and we&#39;re actually having an internal \ndiscussion whether we&#39;d like to use describedby for exactly that purpose \nor not, but there&#39;s no single correct answer here.\n\n&gt; #3 when you say &quot; the intention is not that clients should follow that\n&gt; link; the semantics are in the identifier itself&quot;, I guess you refer to\n&gt; both a link with rel=profile (in the Link header or in the payload), and\n&gt; to the profile param of a media-type ?\n\ni refer to wherever that link relation is used.\n\n&gt; I can understand that as a param to a media-type, it acts as an\n&gt; identifier, just like the media-type itself &quot;application/json&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;application/vnd.andrei+json&quot;\n&gt; but as a link, it has to be &quot;deference-able&quot;, so that the client can\n&gt; follow it. Otherwise, and maybe I am wrong, but it is not a link anymore.\n\na link establishes a (typed) relationship between two identified \nresources. whether the URIs can/should be dereferenced or not is a \nseparate issue.\n\n&gt; #4 &quot;resource follows additional conventions&quot;\n&gt; If I have a media-type &quot;application/vnd.andrei+json&quot; - which under\n&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-media-type-suffix-regs-04\n&gt; means that it has JSON syntax, and some additional semantics of\n&gt; &quot;vnd.andrei&quot;. Accepting such a media-type means that the client is\n&gt; already aware of such syntax and semantics, so pointing the client to\n&gt; &quot;additional conventions&quot; is not really the term here. Instead I would\n&gt; say that this link (may it be describeby or profile) is a description of\n&gt; those conventions which are already shared between server and client\n&gt; i.e. a json schema of application/vnd.andrei+json\n\nif you have a media type and that&#39;s all you need, then you don&#39;t need \nprofiles. if you have a media type that has some openness to it and you \nwant a way how to communicate about how this openness is used, then \nmaybe profiles can be useful for you. again, consider HTML&#39;s example.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
