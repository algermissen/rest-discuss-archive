However, to  \n&gt; put them\n&gt; into the mix while the machine is running is a bit more complex;  \n&gt; there needs\n&gt; to be something more compelling (there&#39;s that word again) to drive  \n&gt; adoption.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you help me understand the comment on why &quot;putting them into the  \n&gt; mix\n&gt; while the machine is running is a bit more complex?&quot;  I guess I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand either &quot;while the machine is running&quot; part and why it is  \n&gt; more\n&gt; complex.  What about it is more complex.\n\nBecause you&#39;re not introducing your idea to a new proposal that will  \nsucceed or fail on its own merits; you&#39;re trying to get it into one of  \nthe most widely-used formats in the world. As such, the barrier to  \nentry is higher; it has to be, or every idea that seems to be good  \nwould get in, and HTML5 would be even more incomprehensible than it is  \nnow.\n\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham&gt;&gt; If you can find cases where someone can reuse that\n&gt; template in an unintended way -- e.g., a search engine, a client doing\n&gt; automated things, a non-traditional browser, an intermediary -- I  \n&gt; think it&#39;d\n&gt; go a long way towards this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully the 3 examples I gave in my ealier email presents relevent  \n&gt; cases?\n\nSorry, but no. Each of those, as Ian says, can be implemented with a  \nvery simple server-side script. Yes, it&#39;s true that this requires  \nsomebody to write the script, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a big enough  \nwin to justify new core syntax in HTML if there isn&#39;t a constituency  \nfor it beating down the door.\n\nTo be clear, I&#39;m somewhat playing devils&#39; advocate here; I don&#39;t have  \nany particular problem per se with your proposal, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m  \nwary of putting things into standards unless we&#39;re sure we need them.  \nI don&#39;t (yet) hear people beating down Ian&#39;s door to include this, so  \nit makes me suspicious.\n\nOTOH I just saw a message from Paul P go by, so maybe this little  \ndialogue will help whip up the masses.\n\n*ahem*\n\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham&gt;&gt; And, if you can come up with those cases, why not  \n&gt; define\n&gt; it as an extension (since it needs to be largely backwards-compatible\n&gt; anyway)?\n&gt;\n&gt; What exactly is an HTML5 extension?  Can you provide a link that  \n&gt; explains\n&gt; this?  I can&#39;t comment as to if it would be an acceptable substitute  \n&gt; until I\n&gt; know more...\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark Nottingham&gt;&gt; If it takes off, you can have the satisfaction of  \n&gt; seeing\n&gt; it incorporated into HTML6...\n&gt;\n&gt; Please PLEASE don&#39;t make us wait until 2032 or so for this! ;-)\n\n\nI&#39;m not the person to ask that, but frankly if you want the  \nfunctionality, go ahead and write the software, publish the site,  \nrelease the browser plug-in; the standards will follow if the minds do.\n\nCheers,\n\n\n--\nMark Nottingham     http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
