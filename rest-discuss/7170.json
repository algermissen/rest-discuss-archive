POST is not a\n&gt; &quot;do it&quot; verb. Do It is a command, although generalized to\n&gt; the max.\n&gt;\n&gt; POST says &quot;here is some information; you know best what\n&gt; to do (or not to do) with it&quot;.\nHmm...that is what I thought I said. Anyhow: agreed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; That may seem degenerate, from a command orientation,\n&gt; i.e., where the client has a clue about what operation should\n&gt; be performed. Sometimes though, the client may be\n&gt; handling a piece of opaque data that only the server knows\n&gt; what to do with.\n&gt;\n&gt; In some context, a client may be POSTing a piece of data\n&gt; which it understands perfectly well, but simply does not\n&gt; know what should be done with it on the server side. For\n&gt; example, in a blackboard architecture, an agent pulls down\n&gt; a piece of an overall problem, solves it, and posts back\n&gt; the solution. The client does not know how to integrate its\n&gt; solution with the overall one, so POST is as specific an\n&gt; instruction as it can give. Perhaps its solution does not fit\n&gt; with the overall emergent strategy, and will simply be\n&gt; discarded. Either way.\nYes, ok. But how does what Isaid contradict what you said?\nSorry for being so unclear.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; PS - don&#39;t say &#39;semantic&#39;. Please.\nThen, what should I use??

My view is that POST, by totally generalizing\n&gt; : operation semantics, moves all the emphasis on abstract resource\n&gt; : behaviour or capability. It moves all the semantics into the client\n&gt; : making a choice for exactly that resource that behaves as desired\n&gt; : upon POST. Thus, binding is on resource &#39;type&#39; (e.g. &#39;order\n&gt; : processor&#39;) as opposed to method semantics.
