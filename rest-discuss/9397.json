And Jon, I&#39;d argue there&#39;s nothing wrong\nwith it, especially since I said the move-to-trashcan (a/k/a &quot;mark for\ndeletion&quot;) should probably be done with a PUT... there was never a\ndouble-DELETE issue there. *My* web server, at least, isn&#39;t so very\nfar from a file system. But though I&#39;m a Perl programmer, I haven&#39;t\nmessed with Parrot, so I could be wrong...\n\nAlso, Eric, your trusty hamblocker... er, spamblocker has bounced the\nGmail invite I sent you, but I think they&#39;re unnecessary these days\nanyway. It&#39;d solve most of your (well, our) list-related problems.\n\n"}}
