I&#39;ve seen one solution posted to\n=\r\nthis list, by Jean-Michel Hiver, however it is outdated as his code\ndoesn&#39;t=\r\n work with the latest Apache + mod_perl, and he doesn&#39;t\nclearly indicate th=\r\ne limitations against all modern browsers. And I\nprefer to use Digest authe=\r\nntication instead of Basic.\n\nAs I had a need for this myself, I&#39;ve taken th=\r\ne plunge and done a\nreally exhaustive examination of doing authentication w=\r\nithout\ncookies. Including being able to do the following:\n\n  1. Optional au=\r\nthentication or personalisation: provide extra\n     features for authentica=\r\ntion users, but also show the url to\n     non-authenticated users.\n\n  2. Us=\r\ners can log off (that&#39;s the hard bit).\n\n  3. Customizable login screens.\n\n =\r\n 4. Discussion of a possible implementation of being logged out after\n     =\r\na certain period.\n\n\nThe long discussion starts here:\n\n  http://www.pobox.co=\r\nm/~berend/rest/authentication.html\n\n\nSample website is here:\n\n  http://www.=\r\npobox.com/~berend/rest/site/\n\n\nI really appreciate any comments. It is extr=\r\na-ordinary easy to make a\nmistake here and think something works where it a=\r\nctually doesn&#39;t. I\ntried to be very lucid and give samples that don&#39;t requi=\r\nre any perl or\nmod_perl skills, so hopefully they are portable to other web=\r\n servers\nthan Apache as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
