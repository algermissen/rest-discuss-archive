If you can do this you save\n&gt; yourself a lot of work, particularly when the system evolves.\n\nI think I understand what you&#39;re trying to say here, but you are\nmisusing the term &#39;coupling&#39;.\n\nI think you&#39;re saying that many processing tasks can be\naccomplished without using an OOP environment, and that doing so\ncan often be a good design. I agree. In fact, I designed the\nWaterken Webizer &lt;http://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/&gt; based on this\npremise.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting to note that the XML interface used by the\nWebizer is the same as that used by the XML to Java mapping. This\nproperty comes from the fact that the XML interface is designed to\nbe loosely coupled to the AST.\n\nMany people seem to misunderstand what &#39;coupling&#39; is. A piece of\ncode, or data, is coupled to something if it uses that something.\nThe coupling is &#39;loose&#39; if there are many possible substitutes for\nthat something. Otherwise, the coupling is tight.\n\nWhen I demonstrate an XML to Java binding for an interface, I am\ndemonstrating loose coupling. The interface is loosely coupled to\nthe AST used to represent it. The examples in the Waterken Message\nTutorial &lt;http://www.waterken.com/dev/Message/Tutorial/&gt; show\nautomated transformation between the XML AST and the Java AST.\nThese ASTs have become substitutes for each other.  That&#39;s loose\ncoupling.\n\nThe flipside of this argument is that not having an XML to Java\nbinding is a demonstration of tight coupling. The interface is\ntightly coupled to the XML AST, because there are no substitutes\nfor the XML AST.\n\nTaking this argument further, I claim that data represented in the\nWaterken Doc Model &lt;http://www.waterken.com/dev/Doc/Model/&gt; is\nmore loosely coupled than the XML documents used in Josh&#39;s\nexamples. This loose coupling comes from the fact that the Doc\nModel was designed to support mapping between many different ASTs.\nThis makes it easy to build mappings into a wide variety of\nexecution environments.\n\nTake a look at the grammar for the Doc Model:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Doc/Model/#Grammar\n\nNotice how simple this grammar is compared to the XML infoset,\nJava Serialization Streams, etc. This simplicity creates loose\ncoupling by making it possible to represent the data using any AST\nwhose grammar is a superset of the Doc Model grammar. The\ncomplexity of the XML infoset grammar precludes this kind of\nmapping.\n\nIn general, I&#39;ve read a lot of nonsense about &#39;coupling&#39;. I hope\nthis email gives people an objective basis on which to reason\nabout coupling. When people claim loose coupling, ask them to list\nthe available substitutes. When people accuse tight coupling, show\nthem the list of available substitutes.\n\nTyler\n\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security.\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
