Indeed, it might not work all the time in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain situations. If you were behind (in terms of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DNS queries) a very restrictive DNS cache you might \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not be able to do dynamic names. \n\nAs I understand it, you&#39;re discussing the ability to wildcard subdomain \nnames, so the I can say *.anconafamily.com resolves to a particular IP \naddress. (If that&#39;s not the case, please ignore this message!) I \nunderstand that a particular DNS server implementation might not provide \nthat functionality. What I don&#39;t get is how an intermediate cache could \nbreak it. I would think that the wildcarding would be invisible from the \ncache&#39;s perspective. Can you fill me in on what I&#39;m missing?\n\nThanks,\n\nJim\n\n\n\n"}}
