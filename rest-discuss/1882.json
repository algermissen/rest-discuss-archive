In fact, it is *essential* to the Web architecture that URI\n&gt; support at least two other kinds of semantics, namely:\n&gt; \n&gt; * It must be possible to compare URI for equivalence (proxies, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; * It must be possible to construct a URI from another complete URI and\n&gt;     a relative URI.\n\nIMO, a web toolkit that properly supports the web/REST model would\nprovide a URI object with the following three methods:\n\nuri.dereference(method, headers, representation)\nuri.compare()\nuri.create(base, relative, query_params)\n\nIf *applications* stick to those three methods then you will not\naccidentally treat XML as HTML by sniffing the file extension, you will\nnot accidentally infer hierarchical relationships that don&#39;t exist, you\nwill not accidentally treat a .jsp as code rather than data, you will\nnot accidentally make code that works with HTTP but not HTTPS (or any\nother REST-compliant protocol) etc.\n\nIf your client or intermediary application only deals with URIs through\nthese methods then IMO, that application properly treats URIs as opaque.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
