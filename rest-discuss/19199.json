Bowman&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Making informed decisions about which constraints to apply, is making\n&gt; use of REST as a tool for long-term development.  It may not be\n&gt; feasible to apply all the constraints initially, if REST is truly what\n&gt; your system needs.  In which case your system design can account for\n&gt; this, becoming more RESTful over time, instead of painting yourself\n&gt; into a corner where the system needs re-architecting rather than\n&gt; implementing another constraint as an extension.\n&gt; \n\nThis is why Roy&#39;s thesis is an invaluable tool, at least for me anyway\nas I&#39;ve been at this since &#39;93 and had a front-row seat at the\ntransition from the old Web to HTTP 1.1 -- Roy&#39;s experience applying\nhis concepts to a system I was familiar with is included in his thesis,\nwhich helped me to incrementally apply REST to my own work as I gained\nunderstanding of it.  Now, I can confidently design systems today which\nmay be easily extended to be fully RESTful tomorrow.\n\nSo I really don&#39;t stress about the unRESTful aspects of my systems,\nthey&#39;re &quot;by design&quot; and will continue to work themselves out over time.\nWhich is exactly what you want from an architectural style, particularly\nfor the Web.  Successful websites tend to grow users over time, and it\nain&#39;t easy to chuck one system for another.  What&#39;s needed is a system\nwhich uses progressively less resources per user, as usage increases.\n\n(Just check out the shoddy uptime records of certain big boys on the\nblock to see how badly this desirable property is needed, and note that\nthey don&#39;t begin to implement REST.)\n\nUsing REST as a tool enables the development of such systems by allowing\nthe architect to chart a steady course, deciding which constraints (like\nidentification of resources) are crucial to get right from the get-go,\nand which may be put off until they satisfy a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nFor example, most popular CMS software defaults to no-cache.  But this\ndoesn&#39;t really matter until you&#39;re starting to bump into the transfer\nlimits of your hosting plan, at which time you can implement caching,\nafter having some time to test the setup first. You can then fine-tune\nyour cache settings over time, and later integrate with a CDN.  This is\nusually done ad-hoc, what I&#39;m saying is that knowledge of REST can make\nthis go smoothly rather than being a comedy of errors (quite common).\n\nIf your system doesn&#39;t grow to need it, then you can probably do without\nall the added development expense (plus complexity driving up long-term\nmaintenance costs) of implementing non-native caching on that CMS. REST\nis your friend when it comes to planning for and managing these expenses\nand complexities vis-a-vis your cashflow.  Budgeting for ho-hum websites\nis easy; successful websites are another story entirely, where knowledge\nof REST as a tool can be your competitive edge in funding growth from\ncashflow instead of debt or outside capital while turning a profit --\ninstead of piling up red ink on wasteful infrastructure.\n\nYeah, I know.  That just isn&#39;t how things are done on the Web!  :-D\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
