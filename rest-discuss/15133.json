He said:&quot;my take: REST and WS-* are the main choices fo=\r\nr an SOA, so REST news is under SOA (where SOA !=3D WS-*, but holistic arch=\r\n choice)&quot;. \nThat is interesting, since it is the first time I see it that w=\r\nay.\n\nSorry, I&#39;m more academic than practical, still being pragmatic. That m=\r\neans I do differentiate both concepts based on the concepts rather that jus=\r\nt how things are done in a de facto way.\n\nSince my evil part is on, please =\r\nexcuse me if the following analysis sounds like breaking your logic. (It is=\r\n clearly trying to do so but for academic purposes.)\n\nAny reader can jump t=\r\no the summary part, if not compelled to read much blah, blah :D\n\nOk. First =\r\nthe style concept. At any time, when building system, you have the architec=\r\nture (the real thing, the instance) of the work already done (meaning, the =\r\nfirst line of code starts creating an architecture). You can also have your=\r\n architecture design, which is the architecture-to-be, which many Agile peo=\r\nple confuse with the architecture itself. And you can have a style, which i=\r\ns the set of architectural element types, relations and principles that, if=\r\n you follow them, will give some benefits after some trade of. You can even=\r\n have several styles, applied together to form a bigger one.\n\nSo, from your=\r\n take, there is also the &quot;high-level approach to an organization&#39;s IT holis=\r\ntically&quot;, which, if I understand correctly, is the actual &quot;way of doing thi=\r\nngs&quot; for the complete IT department. That means all individual systems shou=\r\nld be created and integrated that way, following those rule and generic goa=\r\nls. That is of course not the architecture of one system, but the organizat=\r\nion of all systems as a whole. A system of systems? At the end all that is =\r\nan organizations of elements and interactions, where an element can be a co=\r\nmplete system by itself. To me that fits the architecture definition, just =\r\nin a higher level. And as such, we can talk about an underlying style. See,=\r\n no difference to me if I tweak a little bit.\n\nThe other part is also inter=\r\nesting. REST is indeed an architectural style that may be a great fit for s=\r\nome &quot;way of doing things&quot;, but not for all. It is specific to a particular =\r\ntype of system, with particular needs in transfer, with a particular workfl=\r\now technique.\nFrom your take, that style is the best to achieve the &quot;way of=\r\n doing things&quot;. Good. From mine, that is a style used to implement another =\r\nstyle. Humm.\n\nFinally, the concept of SOA as a WS-* style. You are right ab=\r\nout how other people see it. Let me tell you how do I see it to be clear. S=\r\nOA is an architectural style that uses a component called Service, which be=\r\nhaves like a business service metaphor. There are other components as well,=\r\n and interactions defined (using documents as data elements and messaging a=\r\ns a transport). The idea of this style is to get the architecture as close =\r\nto business as it can.\n\nNow, we have the Web Services Architecture, WSA, an=\r\nd that is an standard, and that is not SOA. The WSA has also components bas=\r\ned on services that live in the web (that restriction is very important!). =\r\nIt defines some standards like the WSDL and SOAP (worst choice ever!), with=\r\n a resource view and all. \n\nNow, I know that in practice, a service in WSA =\r\nis not more that a decorated RPC, that people believes SOA is WS-*, that pe=\r\nople like &quot;REST&quot; because they can use URLS and HTTP to create services (man=\r\ny times just RPC) without SOAP. This is what this kind of discussions tries=\r\n to clarify.\n\nSo, there is a difference, SOA is a style with architectural =\r\nelements and interactions based on business and the service metaphor, with =\r\nunderlying messaging transport and documents as data elements, while REST i=\r\ns a mashup of styles based on the resource concept as data element, optimiz=\r\ned for large hypermedia transfers on top of a networked system, with an sta=\r\nte machine based workflow. Humm.\n\nIn Summary: \nYour take is SOA is not an a=\r\nrchitectural style but a &quot;high-level approach to an organization&#39;s IT holis=\r\ntically&quot; (&quot;way of doing things&quot;) for the whole IT department, and that the =\r\nbest style to do that is REST. From that, I take that either: SOA is servic=\r\ne oriented and thus REST is then a style base on services or to create serv=\r\nices, or SOA is not Service related anymore, and REST is the underlying con=\r\ncept.\n\nMy gut feeling is the first one is the one people accept the most. I=\r\n&#39;ve been asking around, outside this forum, and you see that REST is a syno=\r\nnym of service to many. \n\nYep. I am complicated, I know. But it is interest=\r\ning to compare how people see from outside and from inside. Your take at In=\r\nfoQ is very interesting, but from my outsider point of view you were just p=\r\nublishing REST under SOA because REST is to create services. That is why I =\r\nasked, and now I see I was wrong. Still, there are many out there with the =\r\nsame point of view of mine.\n\nNext question would be: Should we change that =\r\nperception? If no one writes about SOA anymore, but only about REST, should=\r\n we think about renaming SOA channel to REST channel? Is REST community int=\r\nerested in keeping this view of REST under SOA?\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez.=\r\n  \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Apr 2, 2010, at 1:08 AM, William Martinez Pomares wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The question is still the same.

I happened to be InfoQ&#39;s SOA lead editor for a long time,=\r\n and I personally define SOA to be a high-level approach to an organization=\r\n&#39;s IT holistically, not as an architectural style. I&#39;ve personally found RE=\r\nST to be the most compelling architectural style, and RESTful HTTP as the m=\r\nost useful technology stack, to achieve those high-level goals (much more s=\r\no than SOAP/WSDL/WS-* and whatever you&#39;d like to call the architectural sty=\r\nle it embodies, if you happen to believe that it actually does so). Only if=\r\n you define SOA (as I believe Roy and many other REST folks do) as the unna=\r\nmed architectural style underlying WSDL, SOAP & Co., this seems a conflict.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the more interesting experiences I had at InfoQ (I&#39;m no longer=\r\n the lead editor and only loosely associated) was that it got harder and ha=\r\nrder to find anyone willing to write a useful technical article that was no=\r\nt REST-related. Of course this may have been selection bias, but I really t=\r\nried =85 but at some point 90% of the people I respected from the WS-* side=\r\n of things had become RESTafarians.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
