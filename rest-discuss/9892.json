I am assuming that the login \n&gt; process, which can use HTTP Auth, will give the server the opportunity to \n&gt; set the cookie at the start of the login &#39;session&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; thoughts?\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re breaking REST then. One fundamental principle is that the URI \nidentifies the resource, nothing else. Addressing and authentication are \ntwo separate concerns, and you&#39;re mixing them up. Personalized resources \nrequire personalized URLs.\n\nThe personalized URLs don&#39;t actually have to contain the user name if \nthat bothers you for some reason. However they do have to be unique to \nthe user for whom the data is personalized.\n\nIt gets a little tricky when, as you describe here, one page contains \nresources accumulated from multiple URLs, but full REST requires that \nthe page itself still have a unique, identifiable URL. The more you move \naway from this the less well the Web will work for you.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
