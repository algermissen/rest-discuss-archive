That *is* the contract between client and server.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Link relation definitions, while not a media type, are conceptually similar. If the client understands them (IOW has been programmed to understand them) the client can meaningfully react on those links. Otherwise they are just links (which is not at all bad for something like a crawler).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
