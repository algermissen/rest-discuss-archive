Somehow, &quot;API&quot; doesn&#39;t seem right.\n&gt;&gt; I would think something like\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     HTTPAI = HTTP Application Interface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     ARI = Application Representation Interface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     ASI = Application State Interface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     RRI = Resource Representation Interface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     RHI = REST-HTTP Interface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or something along those lines would be more appropriate... Is\n&gt;&gt; there such a term already? If not, any thoughts on what a good\n&gt;&gt; one would be?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt;&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; This e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
