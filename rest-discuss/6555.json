All of the constraints are designed to moderate the effects\n&gt; of a changing environment over time, enable independent evolution,\n&gt; and reduce latency.  All of the benefits from REST-based design can\n&gt; only be seen when a system is exposed to change over time.\n\n&lt;snip/&gt;\n\n\n....  However, as I was saying, a resource is not a\n&gt; box of apples.  It isn&#39;t even close.  At most you could say that a\n&gt; resource is a store where you can expect to buy apples.  At least then\n&gt; the student will understand the value of it being a resource: a source\n&gt; of future representations, not a specific set of representations at\n&gt; any given instant in time.\n\nI think I get that. Continuing this example,\nalthough the store has apples today, it may not have any tomorrow.\nThe representation available from the resource changes over time\nin the same way that a web page content changes over time and hence\nthe web page is a resource.\n  Is that along the right lines?\n\nregards\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
