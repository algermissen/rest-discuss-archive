We just made the slight shortcut that have the URLs look like\n&gt;/resourc=\r\ne;edit. For the pure text-only version, I&#39;d recommend using\n&gt;mime types in =\r\nform of extensions, say /resource.txt. The ; part can\n&gt;then be reserved for=\r\n multiple representations of the same logical\n&gt;resources within the same mi=\r\nme type.\n&gt;\n\nActually, the text-only version is still HTML markup, and so is=\r\n the print version.  That&#39;s the problem I ran into, there are multiple repr=\r\nesentations of the same resource with &#39;text/html&#39; and multiple representati=\r\nons of the same resource with &#39;application/xhtml&#39;.\n\nFor example, file.txt c=\r\nould be HTML or even XML, this is too ambiguous IMO.  Same goes for an .(x)=\r\nhtm(l) extension.  This was a major factor which led to my decision to aban=\r\ndon filename extensions except for images, script and CSS.\n\nWith two except=\r\nions, .atom and .pdf.  The reason I went with .pdf instead of /resource;vie=\r\nw=3Dpdf was primarily because the latter form doesn&#39;t indicate to the clien=\r\nt what filename to use if the resource is saved, which is desirable behavio=\r\nr likely expected by a site visitor.  Both .atom and .pdf are unambiguous e=\r\nxtensions which can only relate to one MIME type.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
