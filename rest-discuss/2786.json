So &quot;CREATE&quot; isn&#39;t a REST method, because I don&#39;t know what\nit would mean to invoke that on a URI identifying a stock quote.\n\nThis is a severe constraint on *form*, but does not in any way constrain\n*function*. i.e. every problem has a solution with a system built with\nthis constraint in mind.\n\n&gt; While HTTP is RESTful, not all things RESTful are HTTP.\n\nThat&#39;s true, but largely irrelevant today; it&#39;s all we&#39;ve got that is.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.
