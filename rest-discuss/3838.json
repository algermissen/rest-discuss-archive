I don&#39;t see why WebDAV would be a special case here,\n&gt;&gt; so that sounds wrong too.\n\n&gt; Could you please explain why you think this is wrong?\n\nI just don&#39;t think that it is a WebDAV specific problem, so I would\nexpect WebDAV to use whatever status would be appropriate for any\nother HTTP application.\n\nI tend to favour 400, but it looks as if 422 was invented for WebDAV\nbecause it was decided that 400 couldn&#39;t be used to report errors that\nweren&#39;t strictly syntactic?\n\n\n-- \nDave\n\n\n"}}
