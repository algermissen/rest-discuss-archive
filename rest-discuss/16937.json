Styles can improve reliability by\n&gt; avoiding single points of failure, enabling redundancy, allowing\n&gt; monitoring, or reducing the scope of failure to a recoverable action.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nSometimes, &quot;reducing the scope of failure to a recoverable action&quot; just\nmeans letting a 404 error occur.  Off-topic but along the same lines,\nis the failure I discovered today with a website I did for a law firm.\nThere are six types of business entity one may incorporate in my State.\nEach one is covered by a non-sequential section of the statutes, so it\ntook me a while just to discover how to link to them, which I did using\nthe Lexis-Nexis Michie service.  The branding goal, is that a potential\nclient of my customer can see from the language of the relevant\nstatutes, why they need the services of an attorney.\n\nThe branding goal was not, a year after the links were created, for\nthem to now point to unrelated nonsense.  Thanks, Lexis-Nexis, for\nchanging the Michie service&#39;s interface in a way that failed to alert\nme via the link-checker I regularly run.  I came across this by chance,\nbut guess what I&#39;ll be doing with the rest of my day today?  I&#39;d rather\npotential clients of my customer see errors, which gives me a chance to\nimmediately fix them, than nonsense I have no way of knowing about\nuntil the complaints start coming in from my customer.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe that the broken link (or,\nthe whole concept of user-based error recovery, if you prefer) was\ntruly one of the great leaps forward of the 20th century.  I&#39;d rather\nhave no answer, rather than a wrong answer for the sake of having *an*\nanswer (allegedly to keep users from being confused).  In REST,\nchanging the interface should update automatically without breaking\nanything, Michie obviously isn&#39;t REST because Lexis-Nexis versioned the\ninterface in a way that broke all links relying on it, in a non-obvious\nfashion.\n\nNote to Apple, Lexis-Nexis:  Coupling bad.  Decoupling good!\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
