But what about scaleability,\n&gt; performance, security, transactional stuff (atomicity, integrity,\n&gt; durability, etc.)?\n\nThe hypothesis is that all constraints are expressible as a separation\nof concerns, and therefore that all architectural properties derive\nfrom some form of loose coupling.\n\n&gt; And in terms of tradeoffs, you may see constraints intended\n&gt; to induce some of the latter (above) interfering with the former,\n&gt; right?  Think of schema denormalization, for example.\n\nSure.  Any constraint has tradeoffs, just as any separation of concerns does.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
