Internal APIs tend \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to be more fine-grained and have a richer feature set than their \n&gt;&gt;&gt; external counterparts.  Those fine-grained APIs are more prone to \n&gt;&gt;&gt; change over time.  HATEOAS is meant help manage those kinds of changes .\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I disagree.  HATEOAS helps humans manage change pretty well on the \n&gt;&gt; web.   I&#39;m very skeptical it can do the same for machine clients, for \n&gt;&gt; reasons stated in an earlier thread.  Still, that doesn&#39;t mean its not \n&gt;&gt; useful. Its just not as useful for machine clients as it is for humans.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know I stated this in an earlier thread, but combining links \n&gt;&gt; (HATEOAS), conneg, custom versioned media types, and XML schema is the \n&gt;&gt; most interesting for me.  Then, you can have validated, guaranteed, \n&gt;&gt; versioned interactions with your services.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Hi Bill,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there benefits of using custom versioned media types instead of \n&gt; using a combination of standard media types and a custom version header?\n&gt; \n\nMy thoughts are all theory, no practice but, IMO custom versioned media \ntypes are better because they follow an existing standard.  Others have \nwarned against the explosion of custom media types.  I&#39;m not sure how \nyou can avoid it if you want validation and to leverage conneg.\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
