My\nsupporting evidence is a little stronger [1] [2].  I&#39;m more than open to\nconsidering other perspectives, but counter opinions without any supporting\nevidence seem so troll-like its hard to take them as anything else.\n\n&gt; When I want to share a resource with a colleague, I am more \n&gt; apt to tell him the string I googled on, and then refer to \n&gt; the nth entry in the list than I am to cite the URL.  \n\nHmm. I&#39;d rather give a colleague an exact identifier than a vague notion.\nAfter all, I thought that was the whole point of URLs. Similary, when I have\nfriends over who don&#39;t know where I live, I give them my exact address\nrather they tell them to go to &quot;midtown atlanta and drive around looking for\na condo&quot;...\n\nI have an idea, maybe we should suggest to TimBL that he change RDF to just\nrequire a link to a Google search rather than requiring all those peskly\nlittle URIs; it would resolve so many pedantic little nuance debates.\nWhadaya think, he&#39;ll go for it?\n\n&gt; if we&#39;re in speaking range.  Other than that, I cut and paste \n&gt; URI into emails and IM messages.\n\nLet&#39;s hope they are not too important, because if they are long they&#39;ll\nbreak and your recipient might not be able to find them (just as I recently\ncouldn&#39;t find [3] because email ate the link).  But then I was forgetting\nthat you are not &quot;in sales,&quot; I guess it&#39;s unimportant for you to communicate\nsuch things reliably?\n\n&gt; And it&#39;s been a long long time since I used lipstick to write \n&gt; a URL on a party napkin.\n\nThat&#39;s a rather strange writing utensil for a male, wouldn&#39;t you say?  Maybe\nyour choice of lipstick for writing is what is retarding your use of the\nhand written word?\n\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just me.\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure it is.  Actually, it seems your main goal is to be contrary;\nI dunno. Maybe that&#39;s just you.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\nP.S.
