The example is \ndebatable as is the number of 100 possible actions/transitions. The \ngeneral problem exists notwithstanding.\n\n&gt; Practically speaking, wouldn&#39;t you (for the sake of the user) have to\n&gt; significantly constrain the UI?\n\nI don&#39;t think so, although my concern is not really with the details of \nUI design. Just consider: Over the course of a session with the \napplication, a member of the Academy looks at the details of 20 movies. \nFinally, he hits the right one. Huge production, huge cast. He decides \nthat one of them is going to receive the award for Best Actor in a \nSupporting Role and starts dragging the little Oscar icon across the \nscreen.\n\nThe client application doesn&#39;t know anything of semantic relevance about \nawards. Those business rules are left to the server. And it is only the \nserver who knows that the award, by now in mid-flight across the screen, \ndoes not apply to directors, cutters, or female actors.\n\nIn another, similar case, the guy starts dragging the Best Picture Oscar \ntowards a list of movies from various years. For all but the current \nyear this Oscar has already been awarded, only movies from the current \nyear are eligible to receive it. Again, that&#39;s nothing the client knows \nanything about and the server knows everything.\n\nNow, as phony as the example is, the interaction itself is completely \nreasonable. And my question, I think, is really simple: How do I ask the \nserver which drop targets are possible while keeping in line with \nRESTful principles.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
