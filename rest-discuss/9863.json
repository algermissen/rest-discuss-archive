In both cases you&#39;re\n&gt; exchanging personalised messages.\n\nCorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, but *should* the response vary on the auth\nrequest headers?  I thought those were only supposed to determine\nwhether or not the page was served, not what the content thereof was.\n\nSo a shopping cart, for instance, would still have to have a unique\nURL per user. And rightly so... perhaps the customer&#39;s assigned sales\nrep should be allowed to see his cart. Perhaps wholesale customers are\npermitted to see parts of the catalog retail customers aren&#39;t, so are\nauthorized for more product pages (but changing the price on a product\npage based on the authentication of the user, would be a no-no).\n\n"}}
