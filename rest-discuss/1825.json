I&#39;d rather see the connection opened by the client & the roles\n&gt; &gt; reversed via a magic command - how about a new HTTP method of &#39;LISTEN&#39;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Aaaargh!\n&gt;\n&gt; Seriously:  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE are all *clearly* about the resource\n&gt; named.  I.e., if they&#39;re the verbs, the named resources is the *direct\n&gt; object*, not the *subject.*  What resource exactly does a &quot;LISTEN&quot; apply\nto?\n&gt; And if you tell me it&#39;s a way to subscribe to events from the named\n&gt; resource, how is that different from GET?  And if you tell me it&#39;s because\n&gt; those events are asynchronously delivered, potentially to some other\n&gt; resource named in the original request, how does that differ from i.e. The\n&gt; HTTP Events proposal and similar / related proposals?\n\nOk... a GET probably would work with an &#39;upgrade&#39; header - I&#39;m just looking\nfor some way to signal the role reversal that seems to be needed to assist\nfirewalled nodes.\n\n"}}
