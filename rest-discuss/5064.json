That actually has a chance of working because the developers who \n: have to use the web service are from an external company, have no SOAP \n: experience, and have a bit of influence in how things get done.\n: \n: &gt; You will probably still lose\n: &gt; the battle, but it beats arguing religion hands down.\n: \n: Thanks for the confidence boost! :-)\n: \n: Here&#39;s the chain of influence that I&#39;m working against.\n: \n: 1. My client has large investment in software from a major GIS[1] vendor.\n: \n: 2. This vendor has released a new &quot;enterprise platform&quot; product which is \n: &quot;web service enabled&quot;. In reality, nothing in that product itself \n: provides web services. You have to use Visual Studio, Apache Axis or \n: equivalent to create the SOAP bindings.\n: \n: 3. Sales and technical people from the vendor are talking up web \n: services acronyms (SOAP, WSDL and UDDI) without actually knowing much \n: about them except that they are &quot;industry standards&quot; for \n: &quot;interoperability&quot; (the vendor is pushing the open and interop line \n: lately). When challenged, especially on UDDI, all I got was blank looks \n: and responses summarised by &quot;it&#39;s the latest thing&quot; and &quot;everyone is \n: doing it&quot;.\n: \n: 4. The software developer likes to learn new things that are good for \n: their resume and which the tools make easy to *deliver*. They understand \n: how to call a procedure, so SOAP is the &quot;natural&quot; choice. I suggested \n: HTTP GET early on and was ignored.\n: \n: To win this battle I have to break the dependency on Visual Studio and \n: get them to think about good design. That&#39;s going to be difficult.\n: \n: Andrew\n: \n: [1] Geographic Information System\n: \n: \n: \n: \n: Yahoo!
