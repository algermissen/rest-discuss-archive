Please clarify...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Clarification: the question mark means I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; referring to anything existing like the APP (which I haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; delved deeply into just yet), just the general case for MOVE.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Entry is a resource, part of entry&#39;s representation includes\n&gt; &gt; the feed&#39;s identification. Server gets the entry PUT back to\n&gt; &gt; it, sees that the difference is the feed, and so it moves it.\n&gt; &gt; Internally it may be nothing like just changing a &quot;feed&quot;\n&gt; &gt; field in an &quot;entries&quot; table, but as far as the client is\n&gt; &gt; concerned, that&#39;s what you want to change about the resource,\n&gt; &gt; so that&#39;s what it looks like.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s other ways to move things that still don&#39;t require a\n&gt; &gt; MOVE action to be created. If all else fails, DELETE from the\n&gt; &gt; old, POST to the new.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, there are a few problems with that.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) AFAICT, there is no feed information in the entry. Thus, APP\n&gt; would need to add that. Too late.\n\nIt’s called atom:source.\n\n&gt; 2) Even if it were there, APP would need to define what it\n&gt; means to edit it for clients to be able to rely on it.\n\nTrue, but I don’t see its absence in the spec as discouragement.\nAtompub is intentionally silent on many issues simply because we\ndon’t know which particular designs will work best in practice.\nExperimentation and adaption is much of the point of Atompub –\nit’s a reasonable baseline so apps with congruent problem domains\ndon’t need to reinvent the wheel. But it’s not a turnkey solution\nin any use case other than the simplest of CMSs.\n\n&gt; 3) And even then, it&#39;s not really clear how this would work for\n&gt; entries that are supposed to appear in multiple feeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you&#39;d end up with lots of additional specification text to\n&gt; define a functionality that is already defined in a separate\n&gt; related standards track IETF spec.\n\nNote that I don’t disagree with this. A MOVE method would be\nvaluable anyway. I just wanted to set a few points right about\nAtompub.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
