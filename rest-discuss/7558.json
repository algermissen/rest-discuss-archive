It takes \ntime for the bad actors to be weeded out, but the time does pass.\n\nWhen I started working with HTML it seemed like forever before people \ncould use forms reliably. When I started working with CSS, it seemed \nlike anything beyond a font tag would never be possible. When I started \nworking with XML, I despaired of using XSLT on public facing web sites. \nAll these are now reasonably reliable today; even if most developers \nstill assume it&#39;s 1999 and that none of these things work.
