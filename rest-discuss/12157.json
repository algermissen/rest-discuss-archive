In\nbatching, each command is or can be independent of the oth=\r\ner. As such,\nthey fail or succeed individually.\n\n&gt; I see two scenarios: fir=\r\nst scenario, the client supports pipelining\n&gt; and knows that it wants to gr=\r\noup requests together, and use\n&gt; pipelining to &quot;batch&quot; the requests togethe=\r\nr. Second scenario, the\n&gt; client doesn&#39;t support pipelining and simply send=\r\ns its requests\n&gt; sequencially. Third and last scenario, the client has no i=\r\ndea that\n&gt; pipelining is used by the server to process several requests as =\r\na\n&gt; unit, and still pipelines them.\n\nHTTP pipelining uses the same connecti=\r\non to service multiple\nrequests. It takes both ends to do pipeline. If the =\r\nclient has no idea\nthat the server supports pipeline, then there is no pipe=\r\nlining. So the\nthird scenario above is not plausible.\n\n&gt; I fail to see how =\r\nthe client would be implacted by the decision made by the server to process=\r\n all those requests as a batch, provided it is simply expecting individual =\r\nresponses &quot;as usual&quot;. I see http say a cleint SHOULD NOT use this for non-i=\r\ndempotent requests, but PUT and DELETE can be made idempotent.\n&gt; The only c=\r\nontentious point I see is network failure, but in the case where the cleint=\r\n is in the middle of a batch of requests without pipelining, it hasn&#39;t rece=\r\nived responses and hasn&#39;t as such had confirmation of any action being take=\r\nn. Provided the server waits until all the responses have been sent to &quot;com=\r\nmit&quot; those batches, the client would be in a safe place at any time.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Any comments / rebuttal would be greatly appreciated.\n\nDepending on HTT=\r\nP pipelining to define atomic transaction boundary is\na custom behaviour. T=\r\nhe client has to know about that a priori.\n\nThe server can&#39;t conclusively k=\r\nnow within a reasonable time if all the\nresponses have been received by the=\r\n client. The server, of course, can\ndefine a timeout limit so it can discar=\r\nd the transaction, but does the\ndata requirement allow for holding dirty da=\r\nta that long?\n\nYS.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________=\r\n_____________________________\n&gt; Love Hotmail?=C2=A0 Check out the new servi=\r\nces from Windows Live! \n&gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/132630768/direct/01/\n=\r\n\n"}}
