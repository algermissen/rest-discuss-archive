Contrast those to APP, which\n&gt; was consciously developed according to the style (mostly without\n&gt; need of my participation).\n\nWhat is &quot;APP&quot;?\n\n\n&gt; ....Roy  [who still remembers people saying publicly that any serious\n&gt;            standardization of the Web should be based on IIOP, not HTTP]\n&gt;\n\nDon&#39;t worry.
