It is an identifier of \na\n&gt; &gt; representation of a resource.  The representation may or may not \nbe\n&gt; &gt; identical to the resource itself.\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure the URI identifies the resource, not a \nrepresentation.\n&gt; Representations are transient things - unless you explicitly make \nthe\n&gt; representation a resource in its own right - but that gets \nfractally complex\n&gt; (representations of a representation of a resource, etc.).\n&gt;\n\nFrom the w3c&#39;s introduction to HTML:\n\n  &quot;Every resource available on the Web -- HTML document, image,\n  video clip, program, etc. -- has an address that may be encoded\n  by a Universal Resource Identifier, or &quot;URI&quot;...\n  Some URIs refer to a location within a resource. This kind of URI\n  ends with &quot;#&quot; followed by an anchor identifier (called the fragment\n  identifier). For instance, here is a URI pointing to an anchor\n  named section_2:\n\n  http://somesite.com/html/top.html#section_2&quot;\n\nSo a URI can identify a resource, or it can identify a fragment of a \nresource.  Just because you can identify something as a fragment of\nsomething else using URIs doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that what you&#39;re \nidentifying is a resource.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For instance, suppose we have a purchase order resource on the \nserver.  It\n&gt; &gt; has a representation identified by URI1.  At the same time, \nsuppose we\n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; have another representation of the PO identified by URI2.\n&gt; There would then be two resources. &#39;The PO&#39; would be URI1, and &#39;The \nPO\n&gt; headers&#39; would be URI2. The data returned by URI2 also happens to be\n&gt; available within the data returned by URI1.\n&gt; \n&gt; This gets into what I call &#39;overlapping resources&#39; (a possibly poor \nterm,\n&gt; but it works for me..) I think of URI2 as a &#39;synthetic resource&#39; or \na\n&gt; &#39;derived resource&#39;. Operations like DELETE might not actually do \nanything -\n&gt; either indicated by &#39;not implemented&#39; or some other response - or \nthey\n&gt; might, its up to the application to decide.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my opinions though.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t consider URI2 a resource at all.  Why not define it as \na &#39;fragment&#39;.  We&#39;re used to seeing browsers retrieving a resource \nand then scrolling to the fragment we require - this doesn&#39;t \nnecessarily have to be the case.  If the fragment is truly such, and \nwe have specified only requiring the fragment using &#39;#fragment&#39; why \ndo we need the whole reource?  Why can&#39;t we just retrieve the \nfragment, keeping in mind that it is only that?\n\nIt&#39;s a matter of granularity, and I agree with S. Mike here, in so \nfar as it becomes &#39;fractally complex&#39; to start defining fragments of \nresources as resources in themselves - this behaviour begs the \nquestion of &#39;where does it end?&#39;  Individual paragraphs?  Words?  \nIt&#39;s not as facetious as it would seem - the words in a resource are \nsignificant to a client such as Google who wants to index your \nresource and they become processable &#39;fragments&#39; in that context.\n\nI&#39;ve never seen it done before, but imagine POSTing, PUTting or \nDELETE-ing to a fragment URI...  If the resource in question is \nrepresented as XML, each node (or perhaps child or sibling element) \nwould by definition be an &#39;addressable&#39; fragment that removes the \nneed to pass around whole resources - especially significant when a \nresource contains a long history of modifications/operations/etc.  \nI&#39;m recalling the legal issues raised here a few days ago, and the \nneed to share documents such as contracts whole - defining part of a \ncontract as a separate resource removes the context, but defining \nthat same part as a fragment seems to me to naturally imply that the \ncontext exists without needing to pass around the whole thing every \ntime someone wants to reference/alter a clause (&quot;You requested part \nof the resource, let it be on your head if you misunderstand the \ncontext&quot;).\n\nI suppose it all boils down to a resource being defined as something \nthat can be conceived of as being &#39;discrete&#39; or &#39;atomic&#39;.  (IMHO)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
