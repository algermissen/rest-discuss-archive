For normal introspection purpose, it seems recommended\n&gt; to use OPTIONS to get Allow header with changing the application\n&gt; state. \n\nAllow MUST be exposed with a 405.\n\nA PUT request MAY send an ALLOW. If it is then the server should\nrespond with ALLOW saying what method it has agreed to allow.\n\nBut 2616 doesn&#39;t say anything about not sending it at any other time.\n\n\n&gt; I was also thinking of URIs with dynamics segments, URIs with query strings\n&gt; not encoded like HTML Forms (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), URIs using\n&gt; matrix-style encoding for parameters, etc.\n\nYou can expose those through links. But URIs should be opaque yada\nyada.\n\n\n&gt; Personally, I prefer to rely on WADL rather than HTML Forms to provide such\n&gt; metadata. It&#39;s easier to process, allows any HTTP method (HTML Form are\n&gt; currently limited) and supports more URI formatting styles.\n\nHTML FORM as a microformat is not limited in what it can describe.\n\nWhich is what a ws cares about.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
