Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I disagree. If I were designing a REST system to deal with leasing\n&gt; contracts, the first thing I would do is research whether or not there\n&gt; exists a standard for representing leasing contracts. Upon finding\n&gt; none, my options as a REST developer are to re-use an existing media\n&gt; type by extending it to handle the specifics of a lease-contract\n&gt; representation, or create a new media type.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I do create a new media type, I wouldn&#39;t call the result RESTful\n&gt; unless and until that media type is standardized. I would simply use\n&gt; XHTML as the media type. If the client number is important\n&gt; information, then I would identify it as such using RDFa or a\n&gt; microformat approach, i.e. assign @id=&#39;client_number&#39; thereby giving\n&gt; clients the ability to glean a client number from any XHTML\n&gt; representation of a lease contract.\n\nIf everything is XHTML, how do you know what kind of representation\nthat the service wants? Sure, XHTML.\n\nSo &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;This is my Lease for the White Van. It&#39;s 4\nweeks.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;, is that a valid Lease for your system?\n\n&gt; Clients that aren&#39;t interested in\n&gt; the client number will gracefully degrade, displaying a human-readable\n&gt; document.\n\ncurl or Firefox may degrade gracefully, that python script someone\nwrote will go &quot;Uh, what&#39;s this&quot; and likely abort. No degradation there\nat all.\n\n&gt; Whereas, if I create a new media type, I&#39;d be reinventing a whole bunch\n&gt; of different wheels -- headings, paragraphs, boldface, italics, links,\n&gt; link relations, HTTP methods and the whole #!. Clients that don&#39;t\n&gt; understand this new markup language will ignore the markup they don&#39;t\n&gt; recognize and display the representation as a big puddle of text.\n\nMy point is that XHTML simply isn&#39;t specific enough and doesn&#39;t offer\nenough clarity to a client as to what it is seeing and what to expect.\nYou could make a &quot;smart&quot; client that goes crawling through payload\nlooking for its markers and microformats. That&#39;s fine, but when you\nsay your client accepts &quot;XHTML&quot;, it&#39;s a bit misleading, because it\nwants XHTML that&#39;s properly formatted, with proper embed extension\nvocabularies or microformats. Otherwise, it&#39;s just gibberish to the\nclient.\n\nYou&#39;re still defining your own formats, payloads, and semantics, but\nnow it just has a catch all media type of XHTML, oh, and it renders in\na browser. Just because it&#39;s in XHTML doesn&#39;t make it any more\ninteroperable. I can&#39;t write a shopping client that &quot;just works&quot; with\nAmazon and Best Buy, and they both use HTML.\n\n&gt; My rule of thumb remains: Don&#39;t create a new media type, when the\n&gt; technology exists to extend any number of existing media types to solve\n&gt; the problem. Creating media types is hard, hard work -- if done\n&gt; properly.\n\nIf you&#39;re extending a data type and not changing the semantics, then\nthat&#39;s a fine idea. If you are changing the semantics, then telling\nfolks it&#39;s a application/xyz+xml when that&#39;s half truth, or perhaps\neven wrong (depending on the kind extension) doesn&#39;t really help\nanyone, does it? Publishing atom feeds where the bulk of your\ninformation is in your own namespace, is that really helpful? Is that\nreally using &quot;atom&quot; then? Maybe if you&#39;re leveraging some other atom\ntool suite to publish the atom and your extensions, then ok. But then\nyou&#39;re using atom as a wrapper to the real meat, which is your actual\ndata -- which isn&#39;t atom at all.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
