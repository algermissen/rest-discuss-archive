The \n&gt;&gt;particular instance I am thinking of is when a resource supports web \n&gt;&gt;service access and web browser access. In the former and XML based \n&gt;&gt;representation would be used while in the latter the resource would be \n&gt;&gt;represented as HTML\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Content negotiation.\n&gt;\n&gt;If the client sends\n&gt;\n&gt;   Accepts: text/html \n&gt;\n&gt;then it&#39;s a browser but if it sends just \n&gt;\n&gt;   Accepts: text/xml\n&gt;\n&gt;then it&#39;s a webservice call.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I might even use the Mime-headers in the request that such as\n&gt;&gt;USER_AGENT or CLIENT_ACCEPTS, although personally don&#39;t think this\n&gt;&gt;would be right way to do it for a number of reasons.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Why not?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nic\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell mainly because a lot of browsers aren&#39;t well behaved and I have \nseen things like text/* or even * in the Accepts header, otherwise I \nwould agree this would an ideal way of figuring out the representations \nto send.\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
