And why do you see less  \n&gt; clearly? I think the &#39;GET representation of device state&#39; is among  \n&gt; the more natural examples..?\n\nThe operation behind this URL is an acquisition process in a sense that \nit does not return a device state. It tells the system to contact the \ndevice to obtain its state but it does not return the state. Another URL \nis available to retrieve (parts of) the state. The operation described \nin the example here (i.e. DownloadDeviceData) does not return any data \nother than a result indicating if the acquisition was succesful or\nnot.\n\nThis is similar to an operation on a weblog API that would simply \n&quot;publish&quot; a draft version of a post. You would have POSTed a new entry \nas a draft, and later on, you would issue a command to publish your \nentry. I guess my URL could support this:\n\n  http://server/publication/ID as POST would publish?\n  http://server/publication/ID as GET would be same as POST?\n  http://server/publication/ID as DELETE would unpublish?\n  http://server/publication/ID as PUT would re-publish?\n\nSimilarly, in the acquisition context, I could do:\n\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as POST would acquire data\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as GET would be same as POST\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as PUT: not applicable\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as DELETE: not applicable\n\n--\n\nClaude\n\nPS: Jan, I mistakenly sent my first reply to you only.
