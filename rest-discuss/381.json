See:\n&gt; http://www.nightmare.com/~rushing/copython/index.html\n&gt; and\n&gt; http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/medusa.html\n\nPython 2.2 adds explicit support for generators with the introduction of the\nyield statement.  [1]  A generator looks like and is similar to a function,\nwith some important differences;  it is similar in many ways to the concept of\na monad from functional languages.  They are sort of anti-idempotent:  a\ngenerator reifies a potentially infinite stream as a function upon which\nsucessive calls which yield sucessive values from the stream.  This is a great\nlanguage-level feature that makes modeling and using infinite streams much,\nmuch easier.  The same kind of thing can be achieved with explicit\ncontinuations / coroutines, but IMO generators are much simpler and more\nintuitive.  They&#39;re also a good step towards unifying a number of related\nconcepts, namely functions, streams, and objects.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n[1] http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/pep-0255.html\n\n\n\n"}}
