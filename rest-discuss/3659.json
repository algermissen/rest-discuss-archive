I would say that any RESTful interaction has at\nleast some (large) amount of visibility.  &quot;At least&quot;, because for any\ngiven use of it in a &quot;RESTful app&quot;, one can probably find additional\nconstraints (even unintended ones) that induce additional properties,\nsome of which may yield improved visibility.  For example, an HTML\nknowledgeable HTTP intermediary has greater visibility into an\ninteraction between two components exchanging HTML with HTTP, than it\ndoes with those same components exchanging SVG.\n\nWhat&#39;s really going on here, IMO, is that the app I described can be\nviewed as its own system, while remaining a subsystem of the Web.  So if\nyou created an architectural style which described this subsystem, you\nwould likely include all of REST&#39;s constraints, but have an additional\nconstraint called &quot;Common data format and language&quot;, or some such.  This\nconstraint is what induces the additional visibility in this app beyond\nwhat REST, by itself, provides.\n\nBut visibility isn&#39;t special, of course.  Any architectural property\nworks the same way.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
