However, I don&#39;t see a way to avoid that,=\r\n without either a) using another data model with exactly the same problem, =\r\nor b) prohibiting any structured information.\n&gt;&gt; AIUI you&#39;re suggesting (b)=\r\n. Looking through the current list of hints, we already have quite a few th=\r\nat need structure. Can you suggest how to convey the information without us=\r\ning structured data?\n&gt; \n&gt; i think there are three possibilities:\n&gt; \n&gt; - pic=\r\nk a generic format (such as JSON) as allow anything it allows. this makes t=\r\nhings great for JSON and not so great for non-JSON.\n\nYep, this is where we&#39;=\r\nre at.\n\n\n&gt; - be structure agnostic (hints are strings) and then hints will =\r\nprobably define their own mappings into string-based structures (using rege=\r\nxes and usual patterns such as whitespace- or comma-separated lists). this =\r\nmight be bad because then parsing a hint&#39;s value needs to be done on a per-=\r\nhint basis.\n\nI&#39;m -1 on this; it hasn&#39;t worked out so well for HTTP headers =\r\n(and in fact a significant number of people are agitating to just define ne=\r\nw headers in JSON) nor for media type parameters.\n\n\n&gt; - pick a small set of=\r\n structures allowed such as the ones i suggested above (single values, valu=\r\ne lists, and maybe lists of key/value pairs) and require that any hint is d=\r\nefined in terms of this more restricted model. this maps better to many for=\r\nmats, but you&#39;re stuck with the choices you make.\n&gt; \n&gt; so my suggestion is =\r\nnot so much your (b) but my (c) ;-) fwiw, it seems that thew current draft =\r\nuses overly complicated structures, for example, &quot;formats&quot; maybe just could=\r\n be an array of formats?\n\nCould you spell out an example?\n\n\n&gt; it&#39;s clearly =\r\na trade-off between allowing arbitrarily structured hints (in which case yo=\r\nu need some generic metamodel) or predefining the kinds of structures that =\r\nhints can use (in which case you can remove the dependency on a particular =\r\ngeneric metamodel). i am still trying to understand how that problem has be=\r\nen solved in similar cases. i assume this is not the first (proposed) IANA =\r\nregistry that has to deal with this tradeoff; does anybody have pointers to=\r\n this has been handled in similar cases?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks and cheers,\n\n\nCheers,\n=\r\n\n--\nMark Nottingham   http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
