(Implied message correlation via a socket connection\n&gt; was a great enabling simplification, but adding more complexity will\n&gt; increase capability)\n\nI could imagine a non-opaque message identifier that when used opaquely,\nidentified message equivalence, but could also be used to correlate\nmessages as part of a single transaction.  Or perhaps do that as two\nseparate opaque URIs so that the transaction the message each had their\nown URI.  Haven&#39;t thought it through.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
