If=\r\n the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entit=\r\ny SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the ori=\r\ngin server.&#39; (Section 9.6, RF2616)\n\n&#39;...the URI in a PUT request identifies=\r\n the entity enclosed with the request&#39; (Section 9.6, RF2616)\n\nI&#39;ll explain =\r\nwhy I see it this way. \n\nFirstly the reference to &#39;enclosed entity&#39; is key =\r\nin my opinion. From a data modelling perspective entity refers to something=\r\n atomic comprising one or more attributes. Whilst this is far from a strong=\r\n argument in the 2616 context - falling back to a general survey of definit=\r\nions there is a general trend towards this definition of entity as:\n\n&#39;An en=\r\ntity is something that exists separately from other things and has a clear =\r\nidentity of its own.&#39; (example from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity)\n\nS=\r\no  the reference to an enclosed-entity within the PUT verb semantics leads =\r\nme to a strong belief that PUT should convey an atomic representation which=\r\n will then be regarded by the server as the &#39;replacement&#39; for any prior rep=\r\nresentations. This alone means to me that partial PUT, or PUT conveying an =\r\narbitrary subset of attributes (whoever much I may wish that to be embraced=\r\n by 2616) is not compliant with the albeit terse, &#39;2616 specification&#39;.\n\nIn=\r\n reality I too have a strong tendency to look to optimise what may be a hea=\r\nvy overhead in conveying large amounts of information for what may be a sin=\r\ngle attribute modification in my resource representation between my clients=\r\n and server.\n\nThat said I regard my own willingness to optimise and add mor=\r\ne intelligence to my own implementation of the PUT (modify) interaction as =\r\nmy own overlay or deviation from the base specification in RFC2616. In such=\r\n cases, the merits of adopting this approach have to consider the likelihoo=\r\nd of breaking assumptions between my clients and intermediaries about what =\r\nis being conveyed by PUT.\n\nThe most interesting clause, the one referring t=\r\no:\n\n&#39;HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an orig=\r\nin server.&#39; (Section 9.6, RFC2616)\n\nIn my opinion this clause does mean tha=\r\nt so long as you ensure that the PUT is compliant to the specification (i.e=\r\n. atomic replacement), then the server is open to doing funky stuff with pr=\r\nevious representation versions, or even deriving the extent of the delta&#39;s =\r\nbetween versions of the resource. \n\nHowever that still does not open the do=\r\nor to conveying partial resource representations between the client and the=\r\n server and I don&#39;t believe conveying a partial does actually satisfy these=\r\n constraints as per your statement about satisfying all constraints. \n\n\n\n--=\r\n- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bryan_w_taylor&quot; &lt;bryan_w_taylor@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Craig McClanahan &lt;craigmcc@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Given that HTTP PATCH[1] has b=\r\neen a released IETF standard for over a year\n&gt; &gt; now, and it specifically a=\r\nddresses the partial update use case, why are we\n&gt; &gt; still wasting both ban=\r\ndwidth and intellectual bits talking about using PUT\n&gt; &gt; for partial update=\r\ns?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Craig\n&gt; \n&gt; My question that started the thread was whether or n=\r\not it is OK to use PUT for partial updates. The fact that another verb can =\r\nbe used for partial updates is irrelevent. That was already true with POST =\r\nanyway. When you ask if something is legal per the spec, you don&#39;t get to a=\r\ndd additional constraints on the design of solutions by requiring them to s=\r\nolve the problem a way you like. A good spec should unambiguously define wh=\r\nat is and isn&#39;t compliant. If somebody comes along and implements a design =\r\nthat uses these verbs in a way nobody thought of, the only question is whet=\r\nher you can find black letters in the text of the spec that you can circle =\r\nin a red pen to defend the assertion that &quot;you didn&#39;t comply with this&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Lore is that PUT cannot be a partial update, but no one has answered my =\r\nchallenge to point to the text of the spec to support this lore.  Nothing i=\r\nn RFC 2616 backs up the contention that the server must forget all previous=\r\n state, in fact to the contrary, the spec says &quot;HTTP/1.1 does not define ho=\r\nw a PUT method affects the state of an origin server&quot;. It&#39;s required to be =\r\nidempotent and to support the vague notion that &quot;the enclosed entity be sto=\r\nred under the supplied Request-URI.&quot; To my reading, partial updates can sat=\r\nisfy all the constraints that are actually documented in the spec. \n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n very well may be that the community that produced HTTP 1.1 did not have pa=\r\nrtial updates in mind when they wrote the spec. This is irrelevant to the q=\r\nuestion of whether the text of the spec forbids it or not. \n&gt; \n&gt; As to why =\r\nnot use PATCH, I don&#39;t object if others don&#39;t want use it. I choose not to =\r\nfor a variety of reasons, which can be summarized as it&#39;s too exotic for me=\r\n to expect of my clients. A client which supports only a subset methods exp=\r\nlicitly given by RFC 2616 will not understand PATCH, and I believe this is =\r\ntrue of most of my clients. I also think I can solve the problem without it=\r\n, by using POST, using PUT with refinements, or using PUT with partial upda=\r\ntes.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
