POST is\n&gt; &quot;everything that doesn&#39;t make sense as GET&quot;. In part, that&#39;s\n&gt; why I think\n&gt; that WebDAV is a good partner for HTTP in REST systems. When someone\n&gt; asks: &quot;what&#39;s the practical consequence of using POST for\n&gt; DELETE&quot; we can\n&gt; answer: &quot;you break compatibility with Windows Explorer and MS\n&gt; Office.&quot;\n&gt; Some people will not care but others will.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a perfect world, we would all use tools like &quot;wget&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;wput&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;wdelete&quot;, &quot;wpost&quot; every day. But really, outside of\n&gt; WebDAV, we only use\n&gt; &quot;wget&quot;.\n\nI know that the proper semantic use of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE is \ncentral to REST, but unfortunately a lot of us have to work in the \nimperfect world of HTML where GET and POST are much better supported \nthan the other two.\n\nFor me, the beauty of REST is the promise that I can architect a \nsingle, uniform, XML-based back-end infrastructure that can then be \ndisplayed and manipulated by a virtually unlimited set of client \ninterfaces. But if I have to build this interface to depend on PUT \nand DELETE, then I have to somehow translate GET and POST requests \nfrom &quot;down-level&quot; clients (i.e. HTML, VoiceXML, WAP, etc.) to \ntheir &quot;proper&quot; equivalents.\n\nXML and XSLT do a great job of solving the &quot;one source, many formats&quot; \nproblem, but if I can&#39;t write my back-end processing to the lowest \ncommon denominator (i.e. GET and POST), I lose a lot of the ground I \ngained on the transformation side.\n\nAny thoughts? Am I missing something?\n\n\n"}}
