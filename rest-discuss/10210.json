Especially if the number of people wiriting clients is small and\ncontrolled. \n\nBut even your service is public, if it is important that the URL be able to\nchange then make that clear in no uncertain terms in the docs and in\nUPPERCASE comments in any representations returned.  And if you are\nparanoid, literally change the URL every time with a validatation parameter\nso that anyone who did hard code quickly learns better and no time is given\nto allow hardcoded clients time is build up.\n\nOr IMO best of all, just document it and commit to the URL format just as\nGoogle have done with their Chart service, for example. Yes I know, that\nviolates the HATEOAS requirement but I personally don&#39;t think being a\nfundamentalist in all things is such a good idea; some times it is better\njust to put a stake in the ground. If *everything* were meta, we&#39;d never get\nanything done.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
