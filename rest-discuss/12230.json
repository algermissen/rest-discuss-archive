Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s use Atom as an example, here. The application developer could\n&gt; have the server interpret the deletion of a collection, as a request to\n&gt; delete all member resources in that collection. A user could then\n&gt; create a collection, like any other, for the purpose of deleting it and\n&gt; whatever entries it references.\n&gt;\n&gt; The tradeoff in such a configuration, is eliminating the ability to\n&gt; delete a collection *without* deleting its member resources. Ask\n&gt; yourself if any reduction in API functionality is acceptable, for the\n&gt; purpose of optimizing DELETE -- a method whose traffic doesn&#39;t amount\n&gt; to a very big slice of the overall network-traffic pie to begin with.\n\nFrom RFC2616:\n\n&quot;The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity\nenclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by\nthe Request-URI in the Request-Line&quot;\n\nThe resources that are in a collection are called subordinate resources,\nwhich can be understood as a requirement that the super-resource\n(collection) be present. In any case there is no clear requirement that\nsub-resources outlive their super-resources. Unless I am missing something,\ncollection deletion could be in a sense transactional.\n\nRegards,\nAlexandros\n\r\n--001636c5bb134dc5ed046568c38c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi Eric,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wed, Mar 18, 2009 at 10:23 AM, Eric J.
