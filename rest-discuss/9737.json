Why do you\nthink =\r\nthat you wouldn&#39;t want to send that request?\n\n&gt; What I was looking for was =\r\na way of specifying the association \n&gt; without having to update the activit=\r\ny 18 resource itself.\n\nIf you want to specify an association between &quot;/subj=\r\nects/5&quot; and\n&quot;/activities/18&quot; without making a request upon &quot;/activities/18&quot;=\r\n, you\nhave good options. If you want to specify an association between\n&quot;/su=\r\nbjects/5&quot; and &quot;/activities/18&quot; without affecting &quot;/activities/18&quot;\n, I&#39;d wan=\r\nt to know why you harbor such a goal.\n\n&gt; If I treat the association itself =\r\nas a resource I could do something\nlike this:\n&gt; \n&gt;   POST /subject_activity=\r\n_association\n&gt; \n&gt; and in the body specify subject 5 and activity 18 (with i=\r\nds or urls).\n\nYou could do something like this:\n\nPUT /subject_activity_asso=\r\nciation/5,18\nHost: www.example\nContent-Type: text/uri-list; charset=3DUTF-8=\r\n\nContent-Length: 65\n\nhttp://www.example/subjects/5\nhttp://www.example/activ=\r\nities/18\n\n&gt; When making an association between two resources where the \n&gt; r=\r\nelationship is many-to-many a common implementation might be to \n&gt; just use=\r\n a join table with each row holding just two values: the \n&gt; ids of the two =\r\nrelated resources. At least with this implementation\n&gt; the association does=\r\nn&#39;t really have much of an independent \n&gt; existence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brainstorming ...=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps if [we] separate association declarations from the join \n&gt; ta=\r\nble implementation and treat them as a separate resource ... ?\n\nWhy should =\r\nyou let the implementation exert such influence on the\npublic interface? Ex=\r\npose the URIs that you want and concoct some\nreasonably speedy implementati=\r\non to prop them up. \n\n&gt; In this case if I started from scratch and created =\r\n3 activities and \n&gt; 3 subjects and didn&#39;t create any associations between t=\r\nhese two \n&gt; types of resources I might also need to create association \n&gt; d=\r\neclaration resources with the following values:\n&gt; \n&gt;  activity subject asso=\r\nciated\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt;   1        1       false\n&gt;   2   =\r\n     1       false\n&gt;   3        1       false\n&gt;   2        2       false\n&gt; =\r\n  3        2       false\n&gt;   3        3       false\n\nI would automate the w=\r\norks so that, by default, activities and\nsubjects do not associate.\n\n&gt; In t=\r\nhis implementation there is always a resource that relates any \n&gt; activity =\r\nto any subject and it&#39;s value is true or false.\n\nI would convey the semanti=\r\nc in the Status-Code in HTTP. If the\nrelationship exists, a &quot;GET&quot; request u=\r\npon the corresponding URI\nprompts a Status-Code of &quot;200&quot;. If the relationsh=\r\nip does not exist, a\n&quot;GET&quot; request upon the corresponding URI prompts a Sta=\r\ntus-Code of\n&quot;404&quot;. Using the Status-Code to convey the fundamental semantic=\r\n allows\nthe entity-body to bear hypertext, such as links to the members of =\r\nthe\nassociation.\n\n&gt; This implies that Restfully the only operations would b=\r\ne GET and \n&gt; PUT.\n\nREST doesn&#39;t enumerate the set of uniform operations, no=\r\nr does REST\nspecify how to name any of the uniform operations. HTTP/1.1 isn=\r\n&#39;t the\nfinal RESTful protocol, and won&#39;t be the best when Waka takes over.\n=\r\n\n-- \nEtan Wexler.\n\n\n"}}
