All three? \n\nA permalink to the content, as viewed by the server-side.\n\n&gt; &gt; The data from that resource might be available \n&gt; &gt; elsewhere, but it still has a one true home that can be used \n&gt; &gt; as its identifier. The other resources that refer to the same \n&gt; &gt; state should normally include a link to this permanent home.\n&gt; I agree with that point,... except. Not I really do, that had been my\n&gt; conclusion. But as I look at this example I created, how does one\n&gt; decide\n&gt; which is canonical? And since each has different breadcrumbs, they are\n&gt; arguably different, depending on the use-case for the person\n&gt; bookmarking.\n\nThe server side can decide what is canonical. We are blessed these days\nwith the example of the blogosphere, where the canonical url differs\nfrom site to site. Each uses some balance between the needs of the\nservice provider and the needs of the service consumers.\n\nThe client can still bookmark whichever they like, but the server only\nguarantees the ongoing existence of the url of its choosing. If the\nclient wants to refer to the content in a permanent way, it should refer\nto it via the permanent link. Even if the server&#39;s guarantee is present\non all three urls, the server is still free to provide a &quot;preferred&quot; url\nit suggests be used in these references.\n\n&gt; &gt; They aren&#39;t the same resource. They are three different resources\n&gt; &gt; that demarcate the same state :)\nMichael Walter wrote:\n&gt; Why aren&#39;t they the same resource?\n\nYes, I was only half-joking. Perhaps cyclically, they are different\nresources because they have different urls. They are identified\ndifferently, so the server is permitted to change their content\nindependently. Only the server knows they demarcate the same state as\neach other and will always have the same representations as each other.\nClients are not normally permitted to associate them as equivalent\nresource, though the server is permitted to provide assurances they they\nare the same through mechanisms such as owl:sameAs.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
