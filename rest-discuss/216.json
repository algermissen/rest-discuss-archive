The rest of\nyou geeks are probably more concerned with substance over style so I\ndoubt I&#39;ll get much uptake on this suggestion. Nevertheless...it&#39;s worth\na try.\n\nFrankly, I think the name &quot;REpresentational State Transfer&quot; sucks. Maybe\nwhen I get more REST-Zen I&#39;ll think that the core idea in the web\narchitecture is the transfer of state representations but right now I\nthink that&#39;s just one issue, along with unified naming conventions,\ngeneric methods, standardization of content types, client-side\nscripting, etc. The whole architecture has no single clear defining\ncharacteristic so I don&#39;t think it should be named after a particular\none. \n\nOkay, REST isn&#39;t going away but maybe we can have a different name when\nthe style is applied to so-called &quot;Web services&quot;. I propose World Wide\nWeb Architectural Style : WWWAS\n\nUsing the full form of &quot;the Web&quot; may get people thinking back to roots.\nIt is not an English word so a single essay will score easily in Google.\nWWWAS would individuate itself (informally) from REST over a while by\nadopting standardized XML formats that apply to web services problems.\nOr maybe WWWAS is REST+XML and everything XML allows.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
