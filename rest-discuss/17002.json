A media type should expresses a\nparticular meaning for the data. For example, in text/html there is a\nmeaning defined for &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot;: It&#39;s a link you can follow!\n\nBut in application/xml? Just looking at that media type tells me nothing\nat all really. I might have an XML dialect where &lt;foo&gt; means one thing,\nyou might have one where &lt;foo&gt; means something completely different.\nJust application/xml doesn&#39;t tell the client anything about how to\ninterpret the data.\n\nIf you use application/xml then you still cannot point to a separate\ndefinition of the type&#39;s meaning (for example in the IANA registry).\nOnly YOUR clients will know what to do with the data.
