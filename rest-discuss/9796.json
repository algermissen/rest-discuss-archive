As the original POST cont=\r\nains the  \nURI of the order to be moved it can be made idempotent (assuming=\r\n the  \nserver knows both the old and new URI).\n\nOn Nov 9, 2007, at 7:11 AM,=\r\n Patrick Mueller wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is one of the big stumbling points=\r\n for people trying to\n&gt; jump onto the REST bandwagon.
