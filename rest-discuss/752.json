However, the business process would actually work better if \nit was treated like a Web resource, for example an order resource, \nwhere all of the subsequent POSTs such as shipments, payments, etc. \nbecame sub-resources. Amazon puts your order on a Web page where you \ncan track its status. B2B ecommerce is sometimes not so nice. \n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
