That is, a situation where it would be nice to\n&gt; do e.g.:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET http://x/1?GET=http://y/2?GET=http://z/3\n&gt;\n&gt; That is, a situation where it would be useful to pass the results of\n&gt; GETting z/3 as input to y/2 to be transformed, and then passing the\n&gt; results of that as input to x/1 and getting the result of that\n&gt; transformation.  And it&#39;s necessary to do this strictly via a URI, that\n&gt; is,\n&gt;\n&gt; http://x/1?GET=http://y/2?GET=http://z/3\n&gt;\n&gt; or somesuch is the name of this pipelined transformation result.\n&gt; Various folks around here have advocated this in the past, so I need\n&gt; some advice:  the above won&#39;t work since the ? delimited parts of the\n&gt; query string will be interpreted as separate parameters for x/1.  An\n&gt; alternative syntax for this might be:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://x/1/GET=http://y/2/GET=http://z/3\n&gt;\n&gt; ...but it seems like getting e.g. Apache to do the right thing in this\n&gt; case might be tricky.  It&#39;s particularly difficult since any of the\n&gt; sub-URI may themselves have query strings --- the part I&#39;m calling z/3\n&gt; in fact has a horrendously long query string of its own that shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be interpreted by x or y (it&#39;s a bugzilla query, fyi.)  Anybody have\n&gt; any suggestions on how to set things up here?  Something to do with\n&gt; mod_rewrite?  Examples --- particularly Python code--- much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW --- A colleague up at work wrote a MoinMoin processor that allows\n&gt; you to embed dot code directly into a Wiki page and have it generate /\n&gt; render the described graph, if anybody&#39;s interested.  Also have a piece\n&gt; of Python code I wrote that turns wiki-style tables plus a &quot;map&quot;\n&gt; datastructure into a dot graph description...  if anybody&#39;s interested,\n&gt; give me a holler.  When we get the RESTWiki back up, we should install\n&gt; this stuff there --- tres useful.  We use our Wiki up at work to\n&gt; coordinate all development specification and planning activities, and a\n&gt; lot of this stuff is the trivial fruit of some work to integrate Wiki\n&gt; and bugzilla and automate various dev planning processes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
