My bad!\n\n \n&gt; | C: GET /lists/42/3\n&gt; | S: 200 OK\n&gt; |    /customers/5\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, if you can identify specific elements of the collection, why not just\n&gt; DELETE /lists/42/5  ?\n\nI was looking at it from a HTML FORM perspective. DELETE /lists/42/5 would be\nthe right way to do it I guess in situations where the DELETE method is\nsupported.\n\nSee: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4244\n \n \n&gt; Three ways jump out:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1/ full-representation approach\n&gt; C: PUT /list/42\n&gt; C: &lt;appList&gt;\n&gt; C:  &lt;!-- full list w/o deleted-element --&gt;\n&gt; C: &lt;/appList&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 2/ efficiency-influenced approach\n&gt;    [using RFC 3229, as Mark Baker pointed out in\n&gt;     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4207]\n&gt; C: PUT /list/42\n&gt; C: &lt;delta representing &quot;[del] /customer/9&quot;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 3/ paramaterized resource delete\n&gt; C: DELETE /list/42?customerId=/customer/5\n&gt; \n&gt; I like this better than just &quot;id=5&quot; because &quot;/customer/5&quot; should be opaque\n&gt; to the client... it shouldn&#39;t be able to parse &#39;5&#39; out of it.\n\n\nWhy not just have DELETE /list/42?customerId=5 which is saying &quot;DELETE the item\nbelonging to customerID=5 from /list/42&quot;? Why the &quot;/customer/5&quot; instead of just\na &quot;5&quot;?\n\n\nThe next question is a doubt that I&#39;ve had for a while:\nSee: http://drupal.org/node/view/5816\n\nAccording to RFC 2396, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, Page\n14, section 3.4,\n--\nWithin a query component, the characters &quot;;&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;&&quot;, &quot;=&quot;,\n&quot;+&quot;,\n&quot;,&quot;, and &quot;$&quot; are reserved.\n--\n\nWhich means that the &quot;/&quot; character when it appears in the Query Component has\nto\nbe escaped. Right?\n\nSan.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
