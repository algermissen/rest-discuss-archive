But I&#39;m kind of puzzled, at least:\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you do with your garden-variety &quot;Email this&quot; link?\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not changing stored server state, it&#39;s just... well, it&#39;s just\n&gt; emailing this (where &quot;this&quot; is a stored mailing-list post, on the\n&gt; assumption that the requesting, logged-in subscriber didn&#39;t get it or\n&gt; accidentally deleted it, and wants to have another copy). I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; it&#39;s an imaginary resource with only a POST function (you can&#39;t GET\n&gt; anything that will meaningfully tell you it&#39;s already been sent or\n&gt; not), but that seems wrong somehow.\n\nREST isn&#39;t something to be religious about... it&#39;s a set of guidelines\n(ARRR!!) for doing webapps.\n\nThe &quot;email this...&quot; is a classic gateway case, but it also has almost\nno implications.\n\nAs long as your interactions with a resource are safe and idempotent\nthen it&#39;s ok to use GET... and surely:\n\n    GET /emailthis?address=karen@...\n\nwould be safe and idempotent would it not?\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
