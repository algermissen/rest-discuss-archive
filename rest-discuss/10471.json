Probably we require the username and email-address of the\n&gt;  user to perform this operation.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So what is the best URL for such functionality?\n&gt;\n&gt;  S.th. like POST /users/{username}/generatepassword with the\n&gt;  email-address somewhere in the body, and the newly generated password in\n&gt;  the response body?\n\nThat&#39;s a good question ;). The intent is to rest the password (i.e.\nremove the current password and generate a new one). generatepassword\nimplies a RPC style of interaction. I see two solutions that I&#39;m\nuncomfortable with: POST /users/{username}/password or DELETE\n/users/{username}/password, both returning 200 with the new password\nin the response body. Both mean to remove the current password and\ncreate a new one. POST is used to create things with URI different\nfrom the request URI (i.e. we POST /resources and the created resource\ncan be accessed from /resource/XXX), but the entity we are sending\n(i.e. email) is unrelated to the created resource (i.e. password).\nDELETE is weird because deleted things should be removed, but nothing\nin its semantics forbids the server to create a new password and\nreturn it. I would go with POST, but I&#39;m not satisfied with this\nchoice.\n\n&gt;  We also want to provide update-password via\n&gt;  POST /users/{username}/password, with oldPassword, newPassword in the\n&gt;  request body. As we have already a password resource, would it be better\n&gt;  then to use POST .../password/generate to generate a new password for\n&gt;  the user?\n\nYou&#39;re replacing a resource state, so you can just PUT\n/users/{username}/password, sending the new password in the body. You\ndon&#39;t need to send the old password as you already have the\nauthorization header with the credentials in the request (the usual\nRESTful way is to just use basic authentication).\n\n&gt;  Or, completely different, would it be better to use s.th. like\n&gt;  POST /pwdgenerator/users/username (with the email address in the body)?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanx for suggestions in advance,\n&gt;  cheers,\n&gt;  Martin\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel Yokomizo.\n\n"}}
