I&#39;ve been struggling with trying to apply REST to a project of mine,  \na decentralized P2P payment system using only IOUs passed between friends  \nin a social network:\n\nhttp://ripple.sourceforge.net/\n\nThe payment network is made up of nodes living on http servers.  I can see  \nhow REST would be appropriate for a client API to a node on the network --  \nto allow users to perform actions through their node, to allow ecommerce  \nsites to access the network, etc.  But I&#39;m having trouble seeing how a  \nRESTful approach might improve the protocol for communications between  \nnodes.\n\nSome issues I&#39;ve come across:\n\n* Identifying distributed objects with resolvable URIs is problematic  \nsince it seems to want to locate them on a single node, when in reality  \nthey live on several nodes.  Giving them several identifiers seems  \ninelegant.\n* Nodes must be able to move to different servers, and if there are URI  \nidentifiers for resources on a node that must be resolvable, then there  \nmust a mechanism for changing those identifiers when a node moves.  This  \ncould cause problems with historical audit information backed up on  \noffline machines, unless two identifiers are stored.  A node could move  \nmany times, so many identifiers may be needed for each resource.\n* Only fully-functional nodes may communicate with other nodes as nodes.   \nScalability in terms of third-party access to partial node functionality  \n(the main benefit of giving all resources a URI?) is not an issue.  For  \nsimplicity and security, all access to the network must be through one&#39;s  \nown node.\n\nI&#39;m a big fan of the REST philosophy, and I&#39;d like to take advantage of it  \nwherever appropriate.  In this case however, REST seems to me like  \ncomplicated overkill compared to simple XML messaging.  I don&#39;t have a lot  \nof experience with RESTful applications, so I&#39;d like to know if others  \nagree with me, or if there&#39;s something I&#39;m really not getting here.\n\nHere is a link to the beginnings of a RESTful version of inter-node  \ncommunications:\n\nhttp://ripple.sourceforge.net/resources.xml.txt\n\nAnd here is a link to a fairly complete XML messaging version:\n\nhttp://ripple.sourceforge.net/messages.xml.txt\n\nMuch more background information is available at the project home page.\n\nThanks,\nRyan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
