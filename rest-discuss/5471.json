The \n&gt; second is a query.  Specifically, over the parts &quot;space&quot; \n&gt; matching the criteria part-id=00345.  While these two \n&gt; examples might refer to the same resource, they are different things.\nNot true. Both are resource identifiers. They are not different things. \nThe representation returned is independent of how the URI is formated.\nWhether a representation is a list of results is immaterial - client apps\nshould learn about that via the context of the URI and/or\ncontent-negotiation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; More practically, they may be implemented differently; while \n&gt; a method operation (GET) on a resource (/parts/00345) is \n&gt; pretty clear, a query might very well return a description of \n&gt; the query-results in the resource-space being queried over... \n&gt; something like...\nThe &#39;query&#39; just identifies a logical resource - an app could just as easily\nPUT or DELETE that resource as the other one.\n\n\n\n"}}
