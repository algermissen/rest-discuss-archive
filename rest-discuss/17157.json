Http has that\n&gt; under control.  Even when used with novel media types the interface is\n&gt; still uniform.  Resources are still identified, resources are still\n&gt; manipulated through representations, the messages are still\n&gt; self-descriptive, and (assuming the media-type is well defined)\n&gt; hypermedia is still the engine of application state.  The uniform\n&gt; interface section[1] is completely silent on how ubiquitous support of\n&gt; representations needs to be.\n\n?? - from the uniform interface section:\n&quot;...information is transferred in a standardized form rather than one \nwhich is specific to an application&#39;s needs. The REST interface is \ndesigned to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, \noptimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an interface \nthat is not optimal for other forms of architectural interaction...&quot;\n\nThis seems pretty clear to me, and far from silent.. standardized forms \noptimized for the common case of the web and not for specific \napplication&#39;s needs.\n\n&gt; I fail so see how &quot;separation of concerns, scalability and independent\n&gt; evolvability&quot; come into play regarding this particular design\n&gt; decision.  The client and server concerns are still separate; custom\n&gt; media types are just cachable as any other media type; custom media\n&gt; types do not, innately, damage the evolvability of the system.  In\n&gt; fact, custom media types are just yet another &quot;downloadable\n&gt; feature-engine&quot; that help &quot;provide for a diverse set of\n&gt; functionality&quot;.[2]\n\n&quot;downloadable feature-engine&quot; and &quot;provide for a diverse set of \nfunctionality&quot; is related to optional code-on-demand constraint, \nspecifically &quot;downloadable feature-engine&quot;s such as java, flash player etc.\n\nagain to quote directly from the section you reference:\n\n&quot;a representation that consists of instructions in the standard data \nformat of an encapsulated rendering engine (e.g., Java [45]).&quot;\n\n*standard* data format, even when using a downloadable feature engine \nsuch as Java.\n\n&gt;&gt; Peter, sorry but the last thing I&#39;m going to do is encourage J�rn, or\n&gt;&gt; anybody here, to go and invent a &quot;custom (vendor) media type&quot; for use on the\n&gt;&gt; internet without mentioning the massive caveat that only they will\n&gt;&gt; understand it - the terms &quot;Universal&quot; and &quot;Custom (Vendor)&quot; are far from\n&gt;&gt; complementary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who said anything about encouraging the use of custom media types?  I\n&gt; am merely pointing out the statement &quot;XML and JSON certainly aren&#39;t\n&gt; RESTful&quot; is false.  It might not be a good idea in J�rn situation, but\n&gt; in some situations it is.\n\nwhich situations? can you show me an example?\n\nps: you may find it beneficial to read Roy&#39;s comments (#31 and #32) here:\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-753\n\nwhich covers both XML/JSON and features such quotes as &quot;When \nrepresentations are provided in hypertext form with typed relations \n(using microformats of HTML, RDF in N3 or XML, or even SVG), then \nautomated agents can traverse these applications almost as well as any \nhuman.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll probably black-list myself from the rest community with this next\n&gt;&gt; comment, but can this whole culture of run to a custom media type whenever\n&gt;&gt; things get tricky and label it as RESTful and &quot;a good thing&quot; culture please\n&gt;&gt; just stop, it&#39;s a new year ahead, it&#39;s painfully obvious that it /doesn&#39;t/\n&gt;&gt; work (in reality) and that it ensures the REST community is small and\n&gt;&gt; massively misunderstood by almost everybody because it detaches from even\n&gt;&gt; the simplest logic and reality. People put things on the web so they are\n&gt;&gt; universally accessible, people share things so they can be seen by others,\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the whole damn point.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with your argument is that custom media types *do* work\n&gt; (in reality).  They work on the corporate network.  They work on the\n&gt; public internet.  They work in a box with a fox.  I know they work\n&gt; from personal experience.\n\nDepends how you define &quot;work&quot; I guess, sure you can make them work for \nyou, optimized for a specific application, but then as we know that&#39;s \nexactly what the uniform interface is /not/ optimized for, so how that \ncan be classed is RESTful is beyond me!\n\n&gt; Custom media types might be inferior to you preferred approach.  If\n&gt; you believe that to be true please argue that.  Not that using custom\n&gt; media types is unrestful.\n\nI believe it to be true, and that it&#39;s a fact that using custom media \ntypes is unrestful - however I also believe that the uniform interface \ntogether with the media type registry do allow custom media types to \nwork, as in, custom/vendor precludes universal, universal includes \ncustom/vendor.\n\n&gt; [1]: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5\n&gt; [2]: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1\n\nSame references...\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
