Some caches save =\r\nthe response headers and content in their entirety for each combination of =\r\n(relevant) request headers it encounters, when there&#39;s a VARY header.  Othe=\r\nrs will recognize the response headers and content as an object, with a var=\r\niety of pointers to it for different request-header combinations.\n\nEither w=\r\nay, a cache is going to somehow store any combination of headers the VARY d=\r\nirective tells it are relevant, as a discrete object.  If no other request =\r\nheaders match this discrete object it&#39;s going to the &quot;top of the list&quot; LRU-=\r\nwise (or LFUDA or GDSF).  They all react to VARY by creating more objects a=\r\ns if they were discrete representations, not by setting up pointer tables.\n=\r\n\nIf you know of a cache which works differently, let me know.  In my resear=\r\nch I failed to encounter any cache which would preserve a non-used header c=\r\nombination for as long as the resource itself is cached, or because other r=\r\nesponses matching different request headers for the same URI are still reta=\r\nined.\n\nYou seem to be playing devil&#39;s advocate with the entire notion of a =\r\ncache alias, but I assure you that none of my assumptions, including any wh=\r\nich are incorrect, are &quot;off the cuff&quot;.  :-)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;What if it changes it&#39;s p=\r\nreferred representation? \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is a valid question, we&#39;ve experi=\r\nmented with setting expire\n&gt;&gt; times on the cookies. But, how important is i=\r\nt to handle such an\n&gt;&gt; unlikely case? \n&gt;\n&gt;How unlikely is it? \n&gt;\n&gt;Have you =\r\nmeasured the unlikliness?\n&gt;\n\nUh, no, but isn&#39;t the onus on you on this one?=\r\n  Meaning, can you actually name an example of a case where a client would =\r\nalter its ACCEPT headers in a way which would run afoul of my example?  The=\r\n changes we typically make would affect language preferences, not the q-val=\r\nue Opera assigns to &#39;image/jpeg&#39; or &#39;application/xhtml+xml&#39; or any other va=\r\nlue relevant to my example.\n\nWhile some people are savvy enough to change t=\r\nheir UA settings, and Opera even provides a drop-down box on your UI if you=\r\n want to alter your UA string, surely this is a small number, and surely th=\r\ne number who would set their image q-values differently from the browser de=\r\nfault is miniscule.  Do you honestly think this amounts to even a measurabl=\r\ne unlikeliness figure, let alone one which would invalidate my assumptions?=\r\n\n\nWell, you did ask &quot;what if&quot;, and the answer to that is &quot;so they get the w=\r\nrong representation big deal&quot; because if it looks no different than the one=\r\n they received before, where is the harm, assuming this would ever even hap=\r\npen?  If this possibility does worry anyone, just expire the cookies and th=\r\nis remotely-possible situation becomes temporary, not permanent.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
