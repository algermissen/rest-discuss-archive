The URI in a\n&gt;   POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed\n&gt;   entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway\n&gt;   to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts\n&gt;   annotations.  In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the\n&gt;   entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI\n&gt;   is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to\n&gt;   some other resource.  If the server desires that the request be\n&gt;   applied to a different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently)\n&gt;   response; the user agent MAY then make its own decision regarding\n&gt;   whether or not to redirect the request.\n\nAnd this, BTW, is why (I think) PUT&#39;s semantics can&#39;t be replaced\nwith POST-with-connneg.\n\nIt&#39;s conceivable that a resource will accept POSTs of media type\nfoo/bar, but also return representations of media type foo/bar upon\nGET. Therefore, it&#39;s necessary to have an operation that allows one\nto change the representations returned as opposed to submitting a\nrepresentation for processing.\n\nThis is admittedly far-fetched (I have difficulty coming up with an\nexample), but IMHO that&#39;s mostly because of the limitations of\nbrowsers, not the concept of a resource.\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
