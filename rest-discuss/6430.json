But the code uses an\nHTML FORM convention to describe the entity; eg:\n\n  param1: value1\n  param2: value2\n\nthe entity is NOT a list of values. But the list of values contains\nall the information needed to represent the entity (in other words,\nit&#39;s that data, just in a different format).\n\nI was trying to process the PUT request with the toolkit&#39;s standard\nFORM processing tools. But it turns out those tools (in this\nparticular toolkit) limit FORM processing to only reqyests where the\nmethod is POST.\n\n\nI supplied a patch to the devs of the toolkit but they rejected it\nsaying that they did not consider it correct PUT behaviour. They would\nconsider it again however if I can point to another toolkit allowing\nPUT to process FORM values.\n\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure this is a legitimate thing to do. Anybody else here\nhave an opinion?\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
