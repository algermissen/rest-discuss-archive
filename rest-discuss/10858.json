Any feed=\r\nback welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; There=92s be a container resource, a pointer to the top o=\r\nf the\n&gt; stack, and individual elements, as outlined. For the purposes of\n&gt; =\r\nillustration let=92s assume we put the container at `/stack`, the\n&gt; pointer=\r\n to top of stack at `/stack/top`, and elements at\n&gt; `/stack/{num}`, where `=\r\nnum` increases monotonically in the\n&gt; interest of idempotency (ie. no two e=\r\nlements are ever assigned\n&gt; the same number).\n&gt;\n&gt; `GET /stack` --&gt; `200 OK`=\r\n, Content:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;stack top=3D&quot;/stack/top&quot; self=3D&quot;/stack&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;elt pos=3D&quot;0&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;/stack/10&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- top of stack --&gt;\n&gt; &lt;elt pos=3D&quot;1&quot; href=3D&quot;/stack/=\r\n8&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;elt pos=3D&quot;2&quot; href=3D&quot;/stack/7&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/stack&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting, so le=\r\nt=92s see.\n&gt;\n&gt; `GET /queue/top` --&gt; `303 See Other /queue/10`\n&gt;\n&gt; Aha; well=\r\n, we knew what the top of stack is.\n&gt;\n&gt; `POST /queue` --&gt; `201 Created /que=\r\nue/15`\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; `GET /queue/top` --&gt; `303 See Other /queue/15`\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Yeap, as expected.\n&gt;\n&gt; `DELETE /queue/15` --&gt; `204 No Content`\n&gt;\n&gt; Hm, so =\r\nI can delete any element I want? Isn=92t this a stack?\n&gt;\n&gt; `DELETE /queue/7=\r\n` --&gt; `409 Conflict`\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh; no I can=92t. It=92s a stack, and deleting ele=\r\nments from\n&gt; elsewhere than the top would conflict with the state of the\n&gt; =\r\nsystem.\n&gt;\n&gt; `DELETE /queue/top` --&gt; `403 Forbidden`\n&gt;\n&gt; So I can=92t delete=\r\n the top-of-stack pointer. Handling this request\n&gt; in this fashion is actua=\r\nlly important. Making it respond 2xx, but\n&gt; actually deleting a resource *o=\r\nther* than `/stack/top` *but not*\n&gt; `/stack/top` itself is broken. (It woul=\r\nd be fine to delete\n&gt; another resource *and* `/stack/top`, however.) It vio=\r\nlates the\n&gt; semantics of `DELETE`. This means that intermediaries, f.ex.,\n&gt;=\r\n which do not know the particulars of the stack protocol after\n&gt; all, will =\r\nget the wrong impression about what actually happened.\n&gt; Don=92t do that.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; In any case the most important part here is actually the design\n&gt; of the=\r\n resource you `GET` from `/stack`: that is where the\n&gt; hypermedia happens. =\r\nHypermedia is the cornerstone of REST: the\n&gt; format design needs to make al=\r\nl parts of the service explicit via\n&gt; links. The URI design particulars are=\r\n actually irrelevant; what\n&gt; matters is where in the document the link is f=\r\nound. This is the\n&gt; basis for how to communicate to the client how it can i=\r\nnteract\n&gt; with resources linked by `elt` elements as opposed to the one\n&gt; l=\r\ninked by the `top` attribute as opposed to the one linked by the\n&gt; `self` a=\r\nttribute. Given a spec of these semantics, every link\n&gt; could point to a co=\r\nmpletely different host, each with a\n&gt; completely different URI structure =\r\n=96 and as long as that\n&gt; conglomerate adhered to the semantics promised to=\r\n clients by the\n&gt; specification of the stack document format, to the client=\r\n it\n&gt; would all look just the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; This means, f.ex., that the client =\r\nactually knew ahead of time\n&gt; that it couldn=92t successfully `DELETE /stac=\r\nk/7`, because there is\n&gt; no other conclusion to draw from the given documen=\r\nt based on the\n&gt; semantics of the format.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is hypermedia. URI desig=\r\nn is orthogonal to hypermedia.\n&gt; Therefore, URI design is not part of REST =\r\n(although it=92s\n&gt; undeniably a good thing; it=92s just good because of rea=\r\nsons\n&gt; other than REST).\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --  \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http=\r\n://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
