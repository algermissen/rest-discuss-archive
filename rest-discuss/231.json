Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thats because we are talking about using HTTP to\n&gt; implement something that isn&#39;t the domain of HTTP.\n&gt; HTTP was designed to be a synchronous,\n&gt; client/server, connectionless protocol.  It was\n&gt; designed to let clients request/update resources\n&gt; from a server simply and easily.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was not designed for asynch, p2p, chat, or\n&gt; distributed computation.  When using HTTP for any\n&gt; of these things we are simply designing a new\n&gt; protocol on top of a set of HTTP primitives.  It\n&gt; is far from clear that the optimal design for an\n&gt; asynch protocol is to ride on top of HTTP.\n\nI&#39;m talking also about designing resource-centric systems. I see problems in\n&#39;consistent/correct&#39; use of HTTP in those cases also.\n\n"}}
