The hypertext instance is an instance of a\ndocument type defined by a schema. It is demonstrably possible to drive\npopups from schemas -- Visual Studio.NET does this already. The primary\nreason that WRDL has stalled is because I haven&#39;t figured out a way to\npreserve the extensive processing that these environments already\nprovide and add the tiny extra bit you need to view URI-bearing elements\nas hyperlinks rather than end-nodes. But even without the extra juice of\nWRDL one can do hyperlink-following processing using WSDL.\n\nclass PurchaseOrder extends WebServiceProxy{\n   // this class was generated from the WSDL\n   ...\n   AnyURI rec;\n}\n\nclass CustomerRecord extends WebServiceProxy{\n   // this class was generated from the WSDL\n   ...\n}\n\n\npo = new PurchaseOrder(&quot;http://....some...url&quot;)\ncustomer = new CustomerRecord(po.rec);\n\nNow you&#39;ll get all of the popups on the customer object.\n\nThe only inconvenient thing here is that I&#39;ve had to *tell the system*\nthat the AnyURI is really a CustomerRecord as opposed to having it\nfigure out from the schema. Arguably this degrades type safety (but then\nthe type safety was always an illusion because you can&#39;t control the\ntype of data returned by the other system).\n\nI&#39;m not 100% sure if this addresses the gist of your concern because I\ndon&#39;t see how pattern-based identifiers would help. The question is\nwhether you have the information you need available at design time or\nnot. With pattern-based systems you presumably have some regular\nexpression language or something. With XML you have schemas.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
