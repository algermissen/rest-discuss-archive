We are having a miscommunication.\nThe scenario I am describing is one in which the\nclient has some intermediary that takes care of\nlistening for notification messages (that hosts\nlisteners).  So the listener is owned by the\nclient not by the &quot;subscribable entity.&quot;\n\nI imagine a workflow that looks something like\nthis:\n\n1. client PUTS listener at\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n\n2. client PUTS another listener at\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n\n3. client requests notifications on http://foo.com\n   to be deliverd to the subscription1 URL.\n\n4. client requests notifications on http://goo.com\n   to be delivered to the subscription2 URL.\n\n5. intermediary.com recieved NOTIFY messages at\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n\n    in all of these cases intermediary responds\n    with non 40x status codes\n\n6. client requests changes by e.g.\n     http://intermediarty.com/getLogs?user=client\n\n7. client decides that foo.com info is really\n   important and would like to be sent a page\n   when foo.com changes.  Client issues a POST\n   to\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n\n8. client is no longer interested in goo.com and\n   does\n   DELETE http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n\n9. intermdiary recieves another NOTIFY message at\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n   and now responds with a 404 Not Found.\n\n10 the notification server sees that there is now\nno listener and deletes the subscription for\n     http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n\nDo you see why a separate listener manager makes\nno sense?\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
