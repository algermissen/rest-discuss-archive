This is just the underlying data model; you can express it=\r\n in a document however makes sense.\n\n&gt; personally, i would feel more comfor=\r\ntable with having a registry that is of equal value to people regardless of=\r\n their implementation language\n\nYou&#39;re using &quot;language&quot; quite loosely here.=\r\n \n\n&gt; , but then again that means that the registry itself must define a &quot;mi=\r\nni-language&quot; of its own.\n\n-1. Defining Yet Another Data Model as a politica=\r\nl solution to avoid picking an existing one is sub-optimal at best.\n\nCheers=\r\n,\n\n\n--\nMark Nottingham   http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
