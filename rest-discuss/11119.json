For example, say I had this resource:\n\n/team/cubs\n\nI&#39;d like to represent the resulting resource as HTML, JSON, CSV,  \netc....  The easiest way would be to append a &quot;view&quot; query string value:\n\n/team/cubs?view=csv\n/team/cubs?view=json\n....\n\nAnother option would be to rely on the request HTTP headers sent from  \nthe client.  I like this approach from an athestic pov, since it  \ndoesn&#39;t muck up the URLs.  But it places a big dependency on the  \nclients being able to correctly set the right headers.  Also, some  \nheaders could have more than one value, so you get into situations  \nwhere ordering must be figured out.  So it seems like the query string  \napproach is the most deterministic and also the least complex.\n\nAnybody else have other options?\n\nThanks,\nGriffin Caprio\nhttp://blog.1530technologies.com\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/\n\n"}}
