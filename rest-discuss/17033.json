Howe=\r\nver, that still leads to the question another poster had\n&gt; made.. it&#39;s not =\r\nguaranteed that a consumer of the api will always work. If\n&gt; anything it wi=\r\nll ignore rel=3D&quot;&quot; values that it was not written to handle. So\n&gt; if the AP=\r\nI evolves to include new rel=3D&quot;&quot; types, then only new consumers that\n&gt; kno=\r\nw about those ahead of time will know what they mean and whether or not\n&gt; t=\r\nhey should follow the href link or not. That is what I think is confusing\n&gt;=\r\n to many. More so, I can provide my own non-known custom XML chunk back,\n&gt; =\r\ncomplete with atom:link or my own link format, with rel/href/type attribute=\r\ns\n&gt; just as well as xhtml can with an &lt;a&gt; link. So even if an API uses XHTM=\r\nL as\n&gt; the media type, the &lt;a&gt; links (anchors) are not going to guarantee a=\r\nny\n&gt; client consuming that api that they will evolve with additional rel=3D=\r\n&quot;&quot;\n&gt; types. Probably more important is that they should not break. If the A=\r\nPI\n&gt; keeps all the existing links, but adds new ones, then only new consume=\r\nrs\n&gt; that are written with the knowledge of the new API version/links, will=\r\n make\n&gt; use of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence why, still, I am having a hard time with the=\r\n idea of using xhtml as a\n&gt; response type for my data elements over just my=\r\n own custom xml format with\n&gt; links embedded in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is my underlyi=\r\nng concern. A while ago, on this forum or maybe it was\n&gt; the Jersey forum..=\r\ncan&#39;t remember, a few people were asking something about\n&gt; if their API wou=\r\nld be considered a true RESTful aPI. Roy and some others\n&gt; said &quot;nope&quot; beca=\r\nuse it didn&#39;t follow the HATEOAS principal to some degree.\n&gt; My concern is,=\r\n not just for me but anyone that is working on some sort of\n&gt; API that they=\r\n hope will catch on and provide business to them, that someone\n&gt; like Roy o=\r\nr other well known figure comes along and writes a blog about\n&gt; their servi=\r\nce and says it&#39;s not RESTful. Somehow, that&#39;s like Steve Jobs\n&gt; saying Java=\r\n is bad and now a crap load of apple people think Java is bad.\n&gt; Hopefully =\r\nnot many with our technical knowledge will read something like\n&gt; that and j=\r\nust assume a given API being blogged about is no good now..\n&gt; because it&#39;s =\r\nnot 100% RESTful according to Roy or some others.

So, at least for me, that is why I am messing\n&gt; around w=\r\nith this on the side, making a toy bid site, trying to see if I can\n&gt; provi=\r\nde a truly RESTful api that clients can consume, evolve without\n&gt; breaking =\r\nclients, and follows HATEOAS.

However, that rel cannot be used in&lt;br&gt;\na representation of a resour=\r\nce that (conceptually) contains multiple&lt;br&gt;\npeople (eg, a search result re=\r\nsource). That means an automaton client&lt;br&gt;\nthat wants to find all the acqu=\r\naintances of people with a particular&lt;br&gt;\nfirst name will have a very diffi=\r\ncult time doing so. At the very&lt;br&gt;\nleast it will require an extra request =\r\nper person in the result set.&lt;br&gt;\nLink relations are occasionally useful bu=\r\nt they are by no means an m2m&lt;br&gt;\nsilver bullet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeter&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://barelyenough.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;barelyenough.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;Scott Banwart&lt;br&gt;Inte=\r\ngration Strategy Partner&lt;br&gt;800-718-4990 (Toll Free)&lt;br&gt;440-399-3311 (Offic=\r\ne)&lt;br&gt;330-671-9286 (Mobile)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.stonedonut.com/&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.stonedonut.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\r\n--0016e657b150281ffd0496870abc--\r\n\n"}}
