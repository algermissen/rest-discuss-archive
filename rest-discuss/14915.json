It seems to work reliably in the\nfour most popular browsers.  Code is here:\n  http://www.vsecurity.com/download/tools/fbha-poc_0.1.zip\n\nThis work was inspired by the work I did previously on the\ndifficulties of securing cookies and some of the benefits of HTTP\ndigest authentication:\n  http://www.vsecurity.com/download/papers/WeaningTheWebOffOfSessionCookies.pdf\n  http://www.vsecurity.com/download/papers/HTTPDigestIntegrity.pdf\n\nThanks,\ntim\n\n"}}
