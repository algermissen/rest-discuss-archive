Is that even close to the truth?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Donald.\n\nBTW, Donald, sorry to have taken so long to post a response, your \nmessage ended up in my spam bin somehow.  Not speaking for other folks, \nbut I think you did a fine job of summarizing.  My only caveat is that \nsending diffs around / processing them is useful when there&#39;s a LOT of \ndata of a relatively opaque form, but the cost is clarity and \nsimplicity;  in smaller cases (such as the example) and perhaps most \napplications of document-oriented XML messaging in general --- I&#39;m not \nsure the benefit is worth the cost.  But that&#39;s more a subjective style \nthing than anything else.\n\nAlso NB:  per the If-Match:  entity tags?  Full-on versioning of every \nreified resource seems onerous.  Don&#39;t know if that was implied or not, \nbut a hash or randomly generated token per version or date of last mod \nor transaction sequence number or any number of other tokens could be \nused as entity tags w/ the same effect.  IMHO, versioning per se is a \nrather centralized and brittle mechanism --- particularly for an \napplication like preventing simple update collisions.  And IMHO, given \nall the additional semantics of versioning per se, if you&#39;re going that \nroute you might as well completely reify the whole version tree in \nURIspace.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
