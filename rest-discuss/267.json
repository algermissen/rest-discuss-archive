This is\na workaround for the lack of sockets in\njavascript.  And is much less efficient than a\nstraight socket conection would be.\n\nIf you are talking about the knownow event\nrouters, it sounds like they are implementing\nlistservs.  If they are sending out 10k concurrent\nemail messages, that is very nice.  If they are\nsending out only 100-1000 concurrent messages and\njust claim a max of 10k listeners, that is\nincredibly unimpressive.\n\nEither way, this has little to do with persistent\nGET and the merits of HTTP for presence\napplications.  The main point is that HTTP is\nsuboptimal for this application (but you may need\nit if the client is a web browser).\n\n&gt; &gt; Again, that may be, but since you also have to\n&gt; &gt; write a custom client, I don&#39;t see the bonus of\n&gt; &gt; HTTP here.\n&gt; I wrote a buddy list/IM clone in just HTML & JavaScript - sure it was\n&gt; &#39;custom&#39;, but I can now give it away to 10K script kiddies to innovate with.\n&gt; Change graphics, chat with their thermometers, etc.\n&gt; The bonus is that the client is just like 10 million other clients, with a\n&gt; large support staff - all are different dynamically loaded modules within\n&gt; the WebApp called WWW.\n\nYeah. Me too.  How many chat clients can your web\nserver support?  According to (1), a typical test\nApache server can handle ~250 requests per second.\nAssuming your clients poll once per second, you\nmax out at 250 simulatenous clients.  That sucks!\nEven if your server could handle higher capacity\nthe bandwidth of handling large numbers of pings\nwill also eventually overwhelm you.\n\nAlternatively, you could also document a\nmore scalable protocol like Jabber, IRC, or Kazaa,\ngive away the source, get the same hackers to\nwork on it, and perhaps get bought by AOL!\n\n-Alex-\n\n(1) http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/benchmarks.html\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
