Does this mean \n&gt; we&#39;re going \n&gt; &gt; to see lots of incompatible REST architecture implementations?\n&gt; \n&gt; I certainly hope so. Only by trying a lot of different things \n&gt; can we see what works.\n\nVariety for variety&#39;s sake is NOT good, IMO.  That&#39;s why I asked what was\nthe difference.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, I see no particular reason to standardize on the server. \n&gt; The interface between clients and servers is standard, but \n&gt; not the interfaces by which servers communicate on their own system.\n\nHave you ever looked at Python&#39;s WSGI?\n\n&gt; If we bless one true architecture for serving REST, we will \n&gt; ultimately harm interoperability since we&#39;ll almost certainly \n&gt; bake assumptions into our code that are only true of that one \n&gt; local framework.\n\nI don&#39;t see how a significant number of arbitrarily different\nimplementations can ever help interoperability. I can only see how it can\nharm it.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m not saying there can be only one (unless you are an\nimmortal, but I digress...)  What I am saying is that a bunch of\nimplementations whose difference are based purely on arbitrary happenstance\nis nothing more than ego-gratification for the developers and not at all\ngood for evolving interoperable solutions.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
