Certainly the example I saw recently of an\n&gt; &gt; image search application, which requires an image as an examplar  \n&gt; to base\n&gt; &gt; a search on, seems to fall into this category. Is this a  \n&gt; reasonable answer?\n&gt;\n&gt; Indeed, my answer to most of these things is that if you hit some\n&gt; limit like that within REST, you&#39;re doing something wrong. It may be\n&gt; that there *are* certain limits to things, but they are good hints ;\n&gt; if it looks wrong, or can&#39;t be done the way you want it, or it&#39;s a bit\n&gt; kludgy, or hackish, then, well, you&#39;re doing it wrong.\n&gt;\n\nNevertheless, can anyone fluent in HTTP explain whether a BODY in a  \nGET request is actually disallowed by the spec?
