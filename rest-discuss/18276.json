Something that certainly won&#39;t work!\n\nI totally agree that switching on domain specific information / capabilities \nin the media type feels intuitive, makes life easier, and makes HTTP work \nwith you instead of against you. But I am having a seriously hard time \ndeciding on whether or not to do it - what do I gain and, more interesting, \nwhat do I loose?\n\nSo, if we mint new media types - when and for what purpose should we do \nthat? Lets talk about e-procurement again. In this domain we have orders and \nbills. What media types should we have?\n\nShould we have only one media type (like Webber&#39;s \napplication/vnd.restbucks+xml in \nhttp://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/):\n\n  application/e-procurement+xml\n\nor many media types:\n\n  application/e-procurement.order+xml\n  application/e-procurement.bill+xml\n  application/e-procurement.person+xml\n\nAs we extend the application we are probably going to need stuff like \ninventory, reservation, bank account, money transfer and so on. If each of \nthese are going to get their own media type then we end up with the known \n&quot;over proliferation of media types&quot; as opposed to sticking to a few well \nknown media formats.\n\nBut, to argue against my previous post - this is an e-procurement REST API - \nmeaning &quot;this is one specific instance of the REST architecture&quot;. It happens \nto work with HTTP which has many more media types, but for this specific \nREST instance (e-procurement) we actually don&#39;t have that many media types.\n\nIf this is a valid interpretation of REST as an achitecture, and \ne-procurement as an instance of it, then the &quot;over proliferation of media \ntypes&quot; is a non-problem - there won&#39;t be that many media types per API / \ninstance of REST.\n\nDo I sound scizophrenic? Probably. I feel so. Like running around in \ncircles. Need sleep ...\n\n/J�rn \n\n\n"}}
