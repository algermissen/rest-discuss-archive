So\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s existing protection from the sort of stuff you&#39;re asking \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; (fraud, etc..).\n&gt; \n&gt; This is an important point for business.\n&gt; But are you taking full advantage of REST when you think about it?\n\nI think so.\n\n&gt; Business exchanges are conversations.\n\nRight, but REST based business interactions are stateless.  Those two\nthings are not at odds, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting.\n\n&gt; If you think of each message as a speech act, \n&gt; probably related to other speech acts in the same conversation,\n&gt; then each speech act is an important resource deserving a URI.\n\nHmm, I&#39;m not so sure.\n\nConsider this &quot;conversation&quot;;\n\n&quot;Hi Bob&quot;\n- &quot;Hi Mark&quot;\n&quot;How&#39;s the wife?&quot;\n- &quot;Good&quot;\n\nThat conversation is stateful.  The last &quot;Good&quot; message doesn&#39;t say\nwhat is good.  You need the context of at least part of the conversation\nin order to understand what it means.  A stateless version of that\nconversation would be;\n\n&quot;Hi Bob&quot;\n- &quot;Hi Mark&quot;\n&quot;How is Bob&#39;s wife?&quot;\n- &quot;Bob&#39;s wife is good&quot;\n\nIt sounds a bit odd, but that&#39;s how I&#39;d do RESTful conversations.\n\n&gt; If you combine:\n&gt; * state-alignment transactions so that each party agrees on each \n&gt; important business milestone, e.g. commitment and fulfillment of \n&gt; commitment\n&gt; * business rules that are also published with URIs\n&gt; * digital signatures \n&gt; * canonical representations of the whole ball of wax\n&gt; - then you got something that you could take into court,\n&gt; but you probably won&#39;t need to.\n\nIn the stateless case, you could just take the offending message to\ncourt and leave everything else behind, because its meaning is\nindependant of any conversation it may have been sent in.\n\n&gt; -Bob Haugen\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. I think a lot of the current discussion focuses on &quot;how to do \n&gt; RPC in REST&quot; rather than &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear \n&gt; advantage&quot;.\n\nYep.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
