The state of the order\n&gt; &gt; as held in the http session in your example is resource state, not  \n&gt; &gt; application state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A simple - perhaps overly simple - ordering protocol might be  \n&gt; &gt; something like: new order created -&gt; adding line items -&gt; order  \n&gt; &gt; completed -&gt; payment received -&gt; order dispatched.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the observable interactions between client and server, this  \n&gt; &gt; protocol is never visible &quot;as such&quot;: it can only be viewed through  \n&gt; &gt; the lens of resource state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Over the course of a series of interactions, the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;application&quot; (the game being played out between the client and the\n&gt; &gt; server) will be in one or other of these states - as viewed from a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;God&#39;s eye&quot; point of view. Once the application state has\n&gt; &gt; progressed to &quot;order completed&quot;, for example, it&#39;s no longer\n&gt; &gt; possible to add manipulate resources so as to add new line items;\n&gt; &gt; it is, however, possible to manipulate resources such that the\n&gt; &gt; application state transitions to &quot;payment received&quot; (the client\n&gt; &gt; would do this by submitting a representation of a payment, perhaps).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The client and the server cooperate to execute this protocol, but  \n&gt; &gt; they do so by transferring representations of resource state, not  \n&gt; &gt; representations of application state. Application state is never  \n&gt; &gt; represented &quot;as such&quot;; rather, it&#39;s inferred by the client based\n&gt; &gt; on on current representations of resource state. If the application\n&gt; &gt; is in the &quot;order completed&quot; state, the representation of the order  \n&gt; &gt; received by the client may very well include a link that has been  \n&gt; &gt; annotated with the link relation value &quot;payment&quot;. This isn&#39;t a  \n&gt; &gt; straightforward representation of application state, however: it&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; an &quot;invitation&quot; to the client to transfer a representation of a  \n&gt; &gt; payment to this linked resource. As a side-effect of transferring  \n&gt; &gt; this representation, the &quot;application&quot; may transition to &quot;payment  \n&gt; &gt; received&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s important here is that the server is really only interested  \n&gt; &gt; in maintaining resource state, which includes maintaining the  \n&gt; &gt; integrity of the lifecycles of the resources under its control,\n&gt; &gt; and the invariants that hold between resources (if any). The\n&gt; &gt; server can&#39;t be sure the client will ever take that step of\n&gt; &gt; submitting a payment, so why bother holding onto application state?\n&gt; &gt; Application state is something that can be reconstructed &quot;after the\n&gt; &gt; fact&quot;, by a client, or omniscient observer, based on the\n&gt; &gt; disposition of the current set of resource representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So the order representation is always a representation of resource  \n&gt; &gt; state. Application state, that &quot;snapshot of the instance of  \n&gt; &gt; execution of a protocol&quot;, can only be inferred or reconstructed\n&gt; &gt; from resource state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this is of some help. Apologies if I&#39;ve confused more than  \n&gt; &gt; clarified; double apologies if I&#39;m just talking plain nonsense.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Kristian Nordal  \n&gt; &gt; &lt;kristian.nordal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Oct 2, 2009, at 10:55 PM, Ian wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mark Baker &lt;distobj@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Oct 2, 2009 at 4:56 AM, Kristian Nordal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;kristian.nordal@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also struggling with the difference between application\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; server state (which I assume is the same as &quot;resource state&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can someone point me to a good definition of &quot;application\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s literally the *state* of the *application*.  If you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your bank balance, that&#39;s a different state than if you were\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preparing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to submit a bill payment, and once you&#39;ve submitted the payment,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;re in yet another state in the application state machine.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Just to add to Mark&#39;s definition, and put it in the context of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;application&quot; and &quot;application protocol&quot;: if we think of an\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; application as being computer behavior that achieves a particular\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; goal, we can describe an application protocol as the specification\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the legitimate interactions necessary to realize that behavior,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and application state as a snapshot of the instance of execution\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of an application protocol.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for the definitions. I&#39;m still a bit confused though, so I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt; going to try to use an example:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Let&#39;s say we have an client/ua that is filling out an order (order\n&gt; &gt;&gt; + line items). In a traditional web application, the order would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be in the http session, and we would add/remove line items to that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; order, and finally place the order. In that case I clearly see\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that we are talking about application state that is placed on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; server. The server keeps track of it, and it&#39;s literally the state\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the client/ application.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But if we were to store and address the order like any other  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; resource,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would that change the nature of the state? It would simply be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; another way of storing the same state, but nevertheless it would be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;resources&quot; with the same properties induced by the stateless\n&gt; &gt;&gt; constraint (visibility, reliability, and salability) - given that  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were stored in the a way that make that possible. To me, this looks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like exactly the same kind of state (application state), simply  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; stored/\n&gt; &gt;&gt; modeled differently. But in that case I don&#39;t see how or if it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; violates the stateless constraint.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you say that the order in this example is always a &quot;snapshot\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the instance execution of an application protocol&quot;, and that it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will always be application state - no matter how it&#39;s modeled? And\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by placing it on the server it would be in violation of the REST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; principles, even though the stateless constraint is dealt with?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kristian\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
