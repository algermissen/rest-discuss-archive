Actually, I don&#39;t think e=\r\nither that REST=3D&quot;easy services creation&quot; idea is good, so I&#39;m with you to=\r\ntally. On the contrary, I feel that idea is carving into developers that ju=\r\nmp right into &quot;REST&quot; after reading a couple of blogs, and then find out the=\r\ny didn&#39;t got REST at all.\n\n2. Making SOAP Services (Read RPC) is the easies=\r\nt thing to do. Making them work together is another issue. Making real Web =\r\nServices (using documents and messaging) is a pain in your little finger si=\r\nnce there is not top down approach. Your system may be a fit for WSA, or a =\r\nfit for SOA (slightly different benefits and requirements), but the impleme=\r\nntation side is failing terribly.\n\n3. The &quot;actual&quot; idea is not the &quot;popular=\r\n&quot; idea, right? It is the Idea we need to pursue to become popular. Agree to=\r\ntally that is not the easy one to understand, apply and identify as the bes=\r\nt to use.  \n\n4. &quot;SOA&#39;s verbiage&quot; you mention is not actually from SOA, but =\r\nsadly those concepts were made popular by SOA and from there people get con=\r\nfused.  Governance and contracts came from the business world, the first on=\r\ne to increase the interest of business people to invest on the technology (=\r\nyep, a worm to catch the fish) and the second one came from WSA. Interopera=\r\nbility and loose coupling came from OO world, and thus created the illusion=\r\n that SOA was a OO system in disguise. Actually, many SOA implementations o=\r\nut there are Distributed OO in disguise. A pity, since Pure SOA has nothing=\r\n to do with it.  \n\n5. Totally agree with your point to maintainability! We =\r\nneed to make that clear and loud. (Just don&#39;t call them sinners).\n\n6. Same,=\r\n I agree about the descendants part. Still, the SOA idea is different from =\r\nImplementation. I&#39;ll be naive enough to think the SOA and Services idea wer=\r\ne born pure, and when implementation started, tool vendors took what they h=\r\nave at that time (SOAP as the next Corba/Dcom generation, and Message queue=\r\ns) and did some rebranding to get to sell SOA tools! So, I still think we c=\r\nan save the pure ideals of SOA (but not with REST, which is a different kin=\r\nd of beast).\n\nNow, question, what should we do about it?\n\nThanks again, Stu=\r\nart.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Stua=\r\nrt Charlton &lt;stuartcharlton@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To answer your questions:=\r\n\n&gt; - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to equate REST with &quot;easy services crea=\r\ntion&quot;.    I&#39;d be more inclined if people equated specifics like &quot;Atom/Atomp=\r\nub&quot; or &quot;OData&quot; with &quot;easy DATA services creation&quot;, personally.     \n&gt; \n&gt; En=\r\nterprises should keep building SOAP web services if they are happy with RPC=\r\n or messaging systems, and can force their vendors to make it &quot;easier&quot;.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; - The actual *idea* for REST is not &quot;easy services creation&quot; -- it is &quot;la=\r\nrge-scale information sharing & manipulation&quot;.   It is for interoperability=\r\n at very-large scale, a &quot;system of systems&quot; architecture: http://www.infoed=\r\n.com/Open/PAPERS/systems.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; As such, it is not necessarily &quot;easy&quot; to =\r\napply to all situations, it requires knowledge & experience (like most thin=\r\ngs).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Explaining REST as an architectural style works for some, but m=\r\nore likely there&#39;s also a need to explain REST in the context of SOA&#39;s verb=\r\niage (e.g. governance, interoperability, loose coupling, contracts).\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n- Probably there will need to be more mainstream books and tooling for the =\r\nlay-developer, that gets into *how* the development experience is different=\r\n.   Unfortunately, that&#39;s a moving target.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some comments:\n&gt; \n&gt; The gen=\r\neral trend among the SOA crowd has been to equate REST with &quot;Plain XML over=\r\n HTTP&quot;, and to this day, it remains the popular understanding in most enter=\r\nprises.    Most don&#39;t really understand the key features (URIs and hyperlin=\r\nks), though I have had some exposure that some are beginning to explore dee=\r\nper once they dig into Atom & Atompub.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with using REST as =\r\n&quot;easy services creation&quot;, is that you may be committing greater sins to you=\r\nr maintainability than using WSDL & SOAP if you don&#39;t use HTTP & URIs prope=\r\nrly (e.g. performing state changes with GET, using a single URI as an &quot;endp=\r\noint&quot;, including application-specific methods in the XML body, etc. )    At=\r\n least with SOAP & WSDL there is tooling & infrastructure for governing the=\r\n little interoperability you do get with it.    With REST, the tooling & wr=\r\nitten literature is still very young, and the vast majority of developers a=\r\nre never going to read Roy&#39;s thesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of the problem is that the W=\r\neb Architecture and REST are very different ways to think about distributed=\r\n systems design, whereas SOAP-style SOA services are an evolutionary descen=\r\ndent of (depending who you talk to) distributed objects ala CORBA/COM, or m=\r\nessage queues ala MQ or TIBCO, which have a much longer history in some peo=\r\nple&#39;s minds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Stu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________=\r\n_____\n&gt; From: William Martinez Pomares &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wed, March 31, 2010 6:25:48 PM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-disc=\r\nuss] What do you think about REST being a synonym of Service creation techn=\r\nique?\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Hello all.\n&gt; I got the newsletter from InfoQ this week, and=\r\n suddenly I noticed something that has been there since long, but till now =\r\nI didn&#39;t realize it.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the SOA channel articles and news, there were =\r\nonly one of each. One article about the REST maturity levels, and one news =\r\nitem about REST security. Oh my...\n&gt; I thought there was some mistake, that=\r\n those two items belong to the REST channel, and then I realized that there=\r\n was no REST channel in InfoQ!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, I had a quick twitter chat with R=\r\nyan Sloboyan, Editor from InfoQ. It seems, REST is seen just as a way to cr=\r\neate services, opposite to SOAP / WS-* lineage. Ryan told me there is alway=\r\ns a possibility to create a REST only channel, but he thinks that will be a=\r\n narrow one, with not so many readers. The expectation is then REST readers=\r\n will come just to learn how to create easy services nos using SOAP.\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\now, Jack Vaughan from SearchSOA was in a fireside chat with me, at the Java=\r\n Symposium from TheServerSide, where I was to talk about REST apis, and the=\r\nir real meaning. He told me his idea of REST was similar to that one of the=\r\n new way of doing services for SOA. We got a full room, and I asked if some=\r\none as ever read Roy&#39;s dissertation. None, and some with faces of &quot;who the =\r\nhell is that Roy guy?&quot;. The question of how many thought REST was a new way=\r\n of doing services yield to several hands up. Also the one about REST as an=\r\n HTTP driven RPC.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, all in all, it seems the idea of REST as an Easy=\r\n Services Creation technique is strong, even influenced in the InfoQ catego=\r\nrization of articles and news.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some of you do post on InfoQ, an=\r\nd are even editors. \n&gt; What are your thoughts? Do you think it is good to k=\r\neep that idea?\n&gt; Do you think that is actually the idea? \n&gt; What do you thi=\r\nnk of posting REST as an architectural style?\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to hear your opin=\r\nions, since I feel that would be an interesting discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; William Ma=\r\nrtinez Pomares.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       ___________________________________=\r\n_______________________________\n&gt; Connect with friends from any web browser=\r\n - no download required.
