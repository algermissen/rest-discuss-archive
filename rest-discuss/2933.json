One of my favourite catch phrases is that\nJabber isn&#39;t just IM - it has a whole lot more to offer a lot of varied\ngroups/requirements - I believe that this is one of those areas (REST)\nthat should be looked at to see if there is some kind of &quot;fit&quot;.\n\nCheers.\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2002 at 09:36:43AM -0800, S.
