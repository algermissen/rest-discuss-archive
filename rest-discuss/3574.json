Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=4849001\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: shop2it\r\n\r\nThe question here is whether the availability of\nHTTP resources are dependent or independent on\nresources higher than them in the HTTP URI path\nhierarchy.  e.g. whether:\n\n  DELETE /parent\n\nimplies anything about how the server should then\nrespond to:\n\n  GET /parent/child\n\nRFC2396 says:\n  URI that are hierarchical in nature use the\n  slash &quot;/&quot; character for separating\n  hierarchical components. For some file systems,\n  a &quot;/&quot; character (used to denote the hierarchical\n  structure of a URI) is the delimiter used to\n  construct a file name hierarchy, and thus the URI\n  path will look similar to a file pathname.\n  This does NOT imply that the resource is a file\n  or that the URI maps to an actual filesystem pathname.\n\nSo the semantics of the hierarchical relationship\nare dependent on the scheme (or perhaps even the\nimplementation) and are not specified by RFC2396.\n\nRFC 2616 (HTTP), says:\n\n  As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource\n  Identifiers are simply formatted strings which\n  identify--via name, location, or any other\n  characteristic--a resource.\n\nSince RFC2616 makes no specific reference to\nresource hierarchies or containers, this language\nwould imply that hierarchy means very little in\nHTTP and therefore the default assumption for HTTP\nshould be Resource Independence.\n\nRoy argues that it is the Implementor&#39;s Choice;\nthat resource dependence is up to the implementor.\nIf the resource is defined as a container of\naddressable elements, DELETEing the resource would\nDELETE its contents.  OTOH, if the resource is\ndefined to be a collection, DELETEing the resource\nwould affect only those applications that view the\nother resources as a collection.\n\nThe problem with Implementor&#39;s Choice is that no\nRFC specifies that being higher in the path\nhierarchy of an HTTP URL implies either a\ncollection or container relationship with the\nthose lower down.  As such, any implementation of\nresource dependence is really an imeplementation\nwith large non-standard side-effects.\n\nSo, given that a major REST design principle is to\nmake the effects of all methods as predictable as\npossible, HTTP-REST applications SHOLD implement\nresource independence rather than resource\ndependence.\n\nNote: Resource independence does not prohibit an\napplication from prohibiting deletes until some\nother set of resources are deleted.  It only\nprohibits non-standard side-effects associated\nwith allowing a DELETE to succeed.\n\nNote 2: A further syntactic argument against\nResource Dependence is that the side effects of a\nDELETE with a query string become extremely\nunpredictable, but I think such an argument is\nunnessary given the above.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
