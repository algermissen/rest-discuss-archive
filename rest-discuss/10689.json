This makes writing agents more in line with =\r\nstandard modes of\n&gt; &gt; thinking about software design and implementation, e.=\r\ng. to accomplish a\n&gt; &gt; task, you make calls to functions with known paramet=\r\ners in an order\n&gt; &gt; determined by the caller to trigger state transitions a=\r\nnd/or receive\n&gt; &gt; some expected output.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, it may be that many peop=\r\nle use URI templates as a shortcut for\n&gt; using hypermedia but there *are* v=\r\nalid uses of URI templates that do\n&gt; not entail cheating.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example,=\r\n in the application on which I work tracks time series\n&gt; data for a large n=\r\number of metrics.  Each metric is a resource, as is\n&gt; the observations for =\r\nthose metrics.  Many (non-browser) agents need all \n&gt; the observations from=\r\n specific time frames to perform their work.  To\n&gt; facilitate this we have =\r\nprovided a &quot;link&quot; in the metric\n&gt; representations to any time based subset =\r\nof the observations for that\n&gt; metric using a template. For example,\n&gt; \n&gt; h=\r\nttp://foo.example/metrics/232/observations?start=3D{start_time}&end=3D{end_=\r\ntime}\n&gt; \n&gt; This works quite well for us, and I cannot think of any other ap=\r\nproach\n&gt; that would be as efficient and simple.  It is worth noting that we=\r\n do\n&gt; not guarantee that URL will exist in the future.  Rather, we guarante=\r\ne\n&gt; that there will be a URL template in the metric representations that\n&gt; =\r\nyou can substitute `start_time` and `end_time` into and use get the\n&gt; set o=\r\nf observation in that time frame.\n\nHi Peter,\n\n=EF=BB=BFSo, are you saying t=\r\nhat you embed the template in the representation\nfor\nhttp://foo.example/met=\r\nrics/232?  If so, why wouldn&#39;t you just put a 2\nfield form there instead?  =\r\nI agree that it means you don&#39;t have the\nability to just make one request. =\r\n If the template&#39;s in the resource\nanyway, I would see the form as being le=\r\nss work to ensure you were\nconstructing the correct URIs because the repres=\r\nentation+form would do\nit for you automatically.\n\nCheers,\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S=\r\n.
