But since HEAD is meant to return HTTP headers, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem logical to try and return that type of metadata in a\n&gt; header.\n&gt;\n&gt; That being said, what is the RESTful way, if there is one, to serve\n&gt; up request / response formats?\n\nSounds like a job for the OPTIONS method. I&#39;ve been noodling with the  \nidea of returning a WADL snippet in the response to an OPTIONS  \nmethod. Essentially you&#39;d return a resource element that describes  \nthe supported methods and representation formats. Need to think about  \nit some more but would be interested in folks thoughts about this  \napproach.\n\nMarc.\n\n---\nMarc Hadley &lt;marc.hadley at sun.com&gt;\nCTO Office, Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n\n"}}
