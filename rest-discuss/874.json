Let&#39;s say you want to move a resource.\n\nThis indicates a limited view of filesystems.  In a hypothetical semantic\nfilesystem, the operation is conceptually similar operation to what you do on\nthe Web.  With rich names, names are queries.  &quot;Moving&quot; a file isn&#39;t\nnecessarily a valid concept in current filesystem research;  rather, you\nannotate or fiddle with the properties of a file such that the pathname\n(query) that is used to access it is different.\n\n&gt; On\n&gt; Unix, you use a symlink, but you are restricted to file systems that\n&gt; have been mounted.\n\nNot necessarily.  Various research systems have proposed symbolic links that\ncan be remote and are resolved only at access time.\n\n&gt; In a standard OS address space you need to account\n&gt; for the indirection in advance and you can only redirect to objects in\n&gt; the same address space.\n\nAgain, there are distributed filesystems with global, multi-rooted\nnamespaces.\n\n&gt; On the Web, you can account for the indirection\n&gt; in advance by indirecting *through markup*\n\nAnd again, this is preferable...  why?  As opposed, say, to direct\nmanipulation of properties and metadata?  And how, really, is that different,\nanyway?\n\n&gt; and you can redirect to any\n&gt; resource anywhere. You can also account for redirection after the fact\n&gt; using HTTP status codes but this is quite inefficient and will probably\n&gt; break some client software.\n\nNone of this is novel.\n\njb\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
