The later  \n&gt; could be confusing to client application developers.\n\nI agree with (a) to a certain extent as it does extend ever so slightly the\ncurrent definition. B however would seem to work fine: a 202&#39;s entity may\ncontain a body with a representation that is not the representation\nretrieved from the resource identified by the uri, specifically because\nthat&#39;s what the rfc defines the entity body as being. I agree however that\nsuch confusion would need to be cleared.\n \n&gt; For instance, take a purchase order that needs to go through some  \n&gt; backend processing (may be even manual) to get created completely.  \n&gt; This could be modeled as a regular 200 OK but keep changing relevant  \n&gt; parts of the representation to reflect its current status. There is no  \n&gt; need for a 202 here.\n\nI completely agree and it depends on the semantics of the resource. An order\nresource certainly gets created when you start adding items to it. The\ninteresting case of a backup in that sense is that the backup may or may not\nbe created successfully. You could simply split those two entities, with the\nbackup entry and the backup data being two different resources, with the\nbackup entry being created on demand and the backup data being eventually\ncreated later, updating the backup entry. But in that case, the backup data\nwill only get assigned, and as such only exist for the client, if and when\nthe process has been completed.\n\nAs I highlighted in the other thread, the issue here is not about creating\nthe backup entry resource itself, that problem is easily solved. The\nquestion simply bogs down to the following question: Can you assign a URI\nfor a resource that has not been realised yet and may not be.\n\nIf a sidekick resource always needs to be created to support giving progress\non a long-running realisation of a resource, maybe it is the case that an\nacknowledgement that such resource exists but is in an undefined state, with\nan entity being returned to define when it may become available (or be\nprocessed), is a good candidate for reuse at the http, rather than the app,\nlevel. And 202 seems to be fitting well enough. But of course it could be\nsolved with Link headers and a custom definition of the rel, with\nhuman-readable or machine-readable content returned on the original 202 and\nthe sidekick resource, etc.\n\nI&#39;m not sure they&#39;re more or less rest however. If a client has only\nknowledge of http, the 202 solution will work because no polling would be\nautomatic and the various requests would still function. The solution still\nrequires to process the entity body (or the link header) to discover the\nlink from the initial 202 response, which you would have to understand\nanyway. The further 202 on GET for a client not aware would essentially\ndisplay the entity saying &quot;Estimated finish time in 5 minutes&quot;. Using a 200\non GET on the sidekick resource would do exactly the same thing. The main\ndifference here would be that the status resource would eventually have to\nlet you know where the resource can be found, and because the resource exist\nas a whole, it should have this in the entity being returned. Then comes the\nquestion of the value of keeping around a second resource to describe the\nstatus when the process has completed. Because you gave that first uri,\nyou&#39;ll have to define when you expire it, and probably keep it around for as\nlong as the resource itself exists.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
