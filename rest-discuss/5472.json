The \n&gt;&gt;second is a query.  Specifically, over the parts &quot;space&quot; \n&gt;&gt;matching the criteria part-id=00345.  While these two \n&gt;&gt;examples might refer to the same resource, they are different things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not true. Both are resource identifiers. They are not different things. \n&gt; The representation returned is independent of how the URI is formated.\n&gt; Whether a representation is a list of results is immaterial - client apps\n&gt; should learn about that via the context of the URI and/or\n&gt; content-negotiation.\n\nI disagree. YOU know that these two URL identify the same resource\nbecause you can &quot;analyse&quot; and understand them. Since URI are opaque for\nthe client, these two URI are different, and can therefore identify\ndifferent resources.\n\nMoreover, according to the &quot;opaqueness&quot;, a user can&#39;t guess the URI\n/parts/00345, and MUST access it through a hyperlink, whereas\nparts?part-id=00345 can be created by a form, which provides the\n&quot;semantic&quot; of the link, and so how to construct it.\n\n"}}
