At this same time, Amazon gets a \ncredit charge authorization from the credit card handler, which \nshould be but isn&#39;t usually a Web resource.\n\nIn stage 2, the Web resources include documentation that Amazon \nshipped the book, maybe a shipment tracking ID that could link to a \nUPS Web resource representing the package in transit, and (should be, \nbut isn&#39;t) a Web resource representing the credit card charge.\n\nSo there are no &quot;actions&quot; except GETting, PUTting or POSTing Web \nresources.  The resources themselves represent commitments or \ndocumentation of actions taken in the meat world.\n\nEven electronic funds transfer does not actually transfer money, it&#39;s \njust bits - money of account.  Relevant Web resources would include \nAccounts and Transfer documents.\n\nAlmost anything in business has already been represented by a \ndocument, which could become a Web resource.\n\nDownloading electronic goods is an action.  Is there a common method?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
