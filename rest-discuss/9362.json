It&#39;s entirely up to the\nserver to move, remove, copy or do whatever else it fancies on the\nDELETE-ed resource as long as client can no longer GET it using the\nsame URL.\n\nThe semantic of DELETE is still the same in Aristotle&#39;s example: the\nresources is no longer accessible under that URL. DELETE in his\nexample effectively deletes the resource identified by the URL such\nthat you can&#39;t get it anymore with subsequent GET.\n\nTo dictate what actually must be done by the server on the DELETE-ed\nresource is not reasonable because then one can demand that a DELETE\nmust mean hard delete as in destruction of information, which may\nrequire judicious use of thermite on the server.\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
