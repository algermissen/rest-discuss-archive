It\n&gt; certainly seems to encourage people to lump all of their code in one\n&gt; resource, resulting in abominations like\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.example.com/scripts/thingy.asp?page=/templates/marketing/fluff.\n&gt; html\n\nThe problem isn&#39;t ASP, it&#39;s IIS. It doesn&#39;t have any convenient means of\ndoing URL rewriting the way that Apache does which is extremely unfortunate.\n\nBy the way, I&#39;ve been working on generating code for C# (and the other .NET\nlanguages) for RESTful-like web services. I started using Paul&#39;s WRDL as the\nspecification language but have since simplified it so that it&#39;s easier for\none person (me) to tackle. I might be able to release some working examples\npretty soon if anybody&#39;s interested.\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
