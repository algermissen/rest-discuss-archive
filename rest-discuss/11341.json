If the  \nserver recognizes the posted person, he does not create a new  \nresource, but rather performs a PUT. It would be desirable to inform  \nthe client that no new resource was created by sending a different  \nresponse code than 201, but which one?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRobert Cerny\nrobert_cerny@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
