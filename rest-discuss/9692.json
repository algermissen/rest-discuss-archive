Much of the research I have read on the\nSemantic Web is abo=\r\nut extending the standard SOAP WS-* stack. This\nincludes WSMO and OWL-S amo=\r\nngst others.\n\nMy opinion is that one could create the Semantic Web with RES=\r\nTful Web\nServices by just adding semantic annotations to existing Web pages=\r\n.\nThis is an oversimplification I know, but I can&#39;t help feeling\nfrustrated=\r\n about all the effort that are spent on OWL-S and WSMO etc.\n\nInitiatives su=\r\nch as OWL-S and WSMO has got to be dead ends, I cannot\nimagine how anyone w=\r\nould create a service for accessing even 20% of\nthe information being avail=\r\nable on the Web today. Adding some semantic\ntags to regular Web pages howev=\r\ner, that one can cope with.\n\nRDF is after all, called Resource Description =\r\nFramework, not\nComplicated Web Service Description Framework ;)\n\nDo you agr=\r\nee? \n\n\n"}}
