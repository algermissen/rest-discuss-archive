If\n&gt; anyone has anything I would be interested. I started writing some\n&gt; thoughts at the link below, as a first pass based on some recent\n&gt; experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://blog.technologyofcontent.com/2009/08/the-resource-oriented-enterprise/\n\nMany of the business reasons for applying REST are the same as those\nfor applying SOA. REST, in a way, is SOA on steroids.\n\nIn Principles of Service Design, Thomas Erl describes seven SOA\nobjectives and eight SOA principles. The objectives are as follows:\nIncreased Intrinsic Interoperability\n* Made better with a uniform interface - Interoperability stops being\nan &quot;easy to plug together at design time&quot; thing to &quot;easy to plug\ntogether at run-time&quot;\nIncreased Federation\n* This is not an explicit target of REST, to get everyone using the\nsame service. However, it is compatible with REST. It also occurs in\npractice on the Web through market forces.\n* While SOA emphasises reuse of services, REST emphasises reuse of\ncomponents (including services), media types, and connectors.\nIncreased Vendor Diversity Options\n* More or less the same for SOA and REST, however REST is probably\nstill less mature in the enterprise space. Time will change this.\nIncreased Business and Technology Alignment\n* ie, we build services that the business wants, and can change in\npace with business objectives\n* Again REST doesn&#39;t particularly target specific valuable services,\nbut is compatible with the notion\n* REST is more capable of incremental upgrade than a classical SOA,\nespecially &quot;dynamic evolution&quot;.\nIncreased ROI\n* Classically realised in SOA by reuse of services, which again is\ncompatible with REST\n* Again, a uniform interface produces wins on this front when compared\nto classical SOA\nIncreased Organizational Agility\n* Classically realised by being able to build new applications quickly\nby reusing existing services\n* Again, compatible with REST and again a uniform interface produces\nimproved performance\nReduced IT Burden\n* Few legacy systems doing more means less maintenance and related\nsupport activities - again compatible with REST.\n* REST makes maintenance easier with its focus on dynamic evolvability\n\nBy my count REST provides benefits towards at least four of these\nbusiness objectives over a classical SOA, and when combined with some\nof the principles of SOA I would only count Increased Vendor Diversity\noptions as a potential weakness from a business perspective. I don&#39;t\nthink you need to make an argument against SOA to make an argument for\nREST. REST is a natural candidate for the next generation of SOA, or\nat least for being part of the mix.\n\nTo my mind, there is a significant amount of common ground between the\nprinciples and business objectives of SOA and the desirable properties\nand constraints of REST. Both provide guidance in areas the other\noverlooks. For example, REST provides ample guidance on the design of\ninterfaces between components. SOA provides ample guidance on how to\nconstruct an inventory of services that produce value for a business.\nThey occasionally talk across purposes and practices on the ground\ndiffer significantly, however I think the two can work together\nsurprisingly well[1].\n\nBenjamin.\n[1] http://soabooks.com/book.asp?book=soa_rest&page=overview\n\n"}}
