URI of\n&gt; the collection you&#39;re querying. This collection then returns a\n&gt; redirect to a results resource that it has set up for you.\n\nYou can just as well return a redirect for GETs, no?\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be interested in the opinions of this list on whether it is\n&gt; OK to optimise away this round-trip, by putting the results in\n&gt; the POST response and also putting the opaque URI in the\n&gt; Content-Location header. Unsavvy clients would redirect to the\n&gt; Location, savvy clients would note the\n&gt; Location/Content-Location for future accesses, but take the\n&gt; body directly, for now.\n\nYou mean you put the body of the redirect target URI in the\nredirect response body, and add a Content-Location with the same\nvalue as the Location header?\n\nIf so, I guess that is in fact a clever idea. I just don’t know\nif *any* client at all is going to be smart enough to catch this\nsort of equivalence.\n\nI’m also unsure about how this plays with the question of headers\nbelonging to the redirect vs. to the resource at the target URI.\nIt might be unavoidable for clients that are smart enough to\nstill issue a HEAD or conditional GET for the redirect target to\nensure correctness of the resource metadata they have stored. If\nthat turns out to be true then you gain nothing because it’s two\nroundtrips anyhow.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
