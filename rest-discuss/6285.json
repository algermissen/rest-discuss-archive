It&#39;s currently a one to one.\nWe could set up the cert and check it by phone as a one off,\nthen add it to the client keystore.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; At a high level I guess the overall view doesn&#39;t change\n&gt; &gt; but the code must change.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking for an explanation of what changes.\n&gt;\n&gt; In each case:\n&gt; 1. the client has a backend store of trusted certificates used by the\n&gt; HTTP connection mechanism\n&gt; 2. the client has a configured trust authorisation interface\nI don&#39;t understand this one Chris?\n\n\n\n&gt; 3. the client accepts the certificate\n\nThen uses it to PUT content to the server I guess.\nMakes sense.\nThanks\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For 3, see e.g. http://javaalmanac.com/egs/javax.net.ssl/TrustAll.html\n\nThanks again Chris.\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
