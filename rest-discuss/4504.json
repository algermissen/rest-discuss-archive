Suppose an RDF document is\n&gt; &#39;running through&#39; an intermediary which intends to augment the\n&gt; representation with data about many of the resources referenced,\n&gt; e.g. getting human readable labels or whatever from some\n&gt; HTTP service.\n\nIt sounds to me like the intermediary is a resource\nitself, with a dependancy on the resource of which\nthe RDF document is a representation.\n\nSo, you can just GET the intermediary.\n\n&gt; My suggestion would be to specify the group (what do the\n&gt; resources have in common that makes you want to retrieve\n&gt; them in batch?), create a resource for it and then GET the\n&gt; resource:\n\nI would have a tough time thinking of a situation that\ncouldn&#39;t be handled this way.\n\nCome to think of it, the set of IDs you&#39;re passing to\ngetMumbles probably has a resource somewhere at the essence\nof its reason for being.  This corresponds to Jan&#39;s &#39;group&#39;\nresources, i.e. you can just GET them.  Where is the caller\nof getMumbles getting its mumbleIds parameter from?  Is\nthere a resource there waiting to have a URI assigned to it?\n\nI like the idea of POSTing queries and turning them in to\nresources, because you can attach metadata to them.\ne.g. referrers and agents and in turn usage of the query.\nThis could be useful when you&#39;re contemplating change (to\nschemas, e.g.).  &quot;What is this change going to break?&quot;\n\n"}}
