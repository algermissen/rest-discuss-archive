You&#39;re just trying to tar the idea through\n&gt; proximity to bad ideas.\n\nSigh.  Paul, you&#39;re getting the independent threads of this conversation tangled --- not suprising,\ngiven your Webby proclivities.  ;-)  The point I was making re: the registry is that some\ninstallation mechanisms dispense with this indirection entirely, creating self-contained\ninstallations / configurations rather than interacting with settings in the registry / environment /\nwhat-have-you.  This isn&#39;t a bad idea, it&#39;s a good idea --- and it&#39;s one of the motivating ideas\nbehind .NET, behind the ROX desktop, behind some aspects of how NeXT / OS X package software, etc.\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s put it this way. Opaque names and non-opaque names can both be\n&gt; redirected and relocated equally easily. *BUT* if the authoritative,\n&gt; official way to navigate from one name to another is through name\n&gt; similarlity relationships rather than through hypertext relationships\n&gt; then it becomes impossible for two related names to be directly served\n&gt; off of unrelated servers in a domain-name based system.\n\nNot at all --- this appears to be an overgeneralization.  In order for this to make sense, you need\nto describe specifically what the relationship between the two names is and why this relationship\nprevents being served from unrelated servers.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
