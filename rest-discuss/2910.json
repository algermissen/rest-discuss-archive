I can only presume that this is a major\n&gt; reason that so few reusable XML-RPC abstract service\n&gt; types have arisen...or perhaps it is the lack of a\n&gt; service description language. I&#39;m not sure.\n\nSince Dave Winer says my advocating REST means I don&#39;t\nactively develop software, I&#39;m not sure if my opinion\nis valid ;-), but in my experience the quality and\nconsistency of source code and design on the XML-RPC\nsite is poor....it&#39;s as if someone threw a mish-mash\nof hyperlinks onto a single page so they could brag\nthat it was implemented in 19 different languages. \nThis, in addition to my dislike for both Dave *and*\nhis opinion, have led me to the conclusion that he&#39;s\njust not worth my time.  In fact, Dave and the XML-RPC\nsite have served as a great example of who *not* to be\nand what *not* to do.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
