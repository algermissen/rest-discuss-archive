IMO, the Developer&#39;s Key has an explicit impact \non how the idea of a &quot;safe method&quot; should be interpreted.\n\nInterpreting safety this strictly, in this context, would seem to \nrender an entire class of Web Services essentially un-GETable.  \nIt would seem to reinforce the perception that REST is only good \nfor mostly public data.\n\nGiven your comments, do you see Xoomle as broken?  \n\nHow is this really any different from any web site that \ndoes session time-outs?  In that case, is the fact that\nthe session time-out clock is reset when following a link\nconsidered an action of &quot;unexpected significance?&quot;  This \nis almost a mirror image of the Google hit counter: in one \ncase following a link has the implicit effect of keeping \nthe session alive; in the other, it is slowly eating it away.  \nBut in both cases the user &quot;did not request the side-effects&quot; \nexplicitly.\n\nIt seems to me that Google is demonstrating the beginnings of\na Pay-per-Use business model, that other public Web Services \nmay need to adopt in order to generate income.  I expect that \nin the future, Google will be selling Keys, say $100 per billion \nqueries (or something like that) :)\n\n\n\n"}}
