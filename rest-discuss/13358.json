As I said above, this is a community effort. It&#39;s meant  \nto be open.

Red Hat is  \ncommitted to working with open source communities.\n\nThanks for bringing that to my attention.\n\nMark.\n\n\nOn 18 Sep 2009, at 12:14, Sam Johnston wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Alexander,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m 100% with Roy on this one.\n&gt;\n&gt; I pointed out a week or two ago that something was fishy with the  \n&gt; REST-* governance, with a view to having it changed so myself and  \n&gt; others could get involved:\n&gt;\n&gt; FWIW REST-* sounds like something I could get behind but to be  \n&gt; completely candid (as always) I&#39;m disappointed to see similar  \n&gt; governance shenanigans to those that undermined the WS-I: &quot;Red Hat,  \n&gt; as the founder of REST-*, gets a permanent seat on the board. All  \n&gt; other board members must be elected by the overall membership once a  \n&gt; year&quot;. If it&#39;s not too late then please reconsider this position.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill Burke (Chief Architect at JBoss, Inc. last I checked) said  \n&gt; they&#39;d consider changes if it was a showstopper:\n&gt;\n&gt; What should it be changed to?  So far the governance policies seem  \n&gt; pretty liberal to me (since I wrote it).  RHT as a permanent member  \n&gt; of the board seems reasonable to me considering we started it and  \n&gt; will be doing most of the work initially. Then again, if its a show  \n&gt; stopper it will be removed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark Little (CTO at JBoss, Inc.) chimed in the next morning saying  \n&gt; Bill was on vacation and making it quite clear that no such changes  \n&gt; would be necessary:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill&#39;s on vacation this week so he may have a different perspective,  \n&gt; but I don&#39;t have a problem with the statement as it&#39;s made, i.e.,  \n&gt; Red Hat having a permanent position on the board. I&#39;ve been involved  \n&gt; with standards for 20+ years through OMG, OASIS, W3C, WS-I, GGF, JCP  \n&gt; and others. What&#39;s proposed in the whole effort around REST-* is far  \n&gt; less Evil Empire and far more Benign Coordinator. If we have  \n&gt; problems with the approach in the future of course we can re-examine  \n&gt; it, but at this stage I think it&#39;s fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all well and good to say but once Red Hat are burnt into the  \n&gt; woodwork it can be very difficult (if not impossible) to remove  \n&gt; them. What justification is there for them enjoying a privileged  \n&gt; position over their competitors, and the creator himself for that  \n&gt; matter? Bill sees this as their reward for &quot;start[ing] it and [...]  \n&gt; doing most of the work initially&quot; but why not just self-appoint for  \n&gt; the interim and then let the community vote you in based on your  \n&gt; contributions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Procedural issues aside I think it&#39;s safe to say that REST-* does  \n&gt; not (and will not) enjoy the support of the greater community so  \n&gt; they should &quot;just close the stupid site down&quot;. There are plenty of  \n&gt; safe and effective ways we can promote REST without resorting to  \n&gt; going down the WS-* path by creating structures that unfairly reward  \n&gt; some participants at the cost of others. Mark Baker&#39;s wiki could do  \n&gt; with a shot in the arm in terms of speed, branding, etc. (things the  \n&gt; REST Patterns wiki appears to have under control) but these are  \n&gt; things we can easily fix (and should imo). Where we need more  \n&gt; rigorous standardisation we can use existing process like IETF  \n&gt; Internet-Drafts (as has been done before for e.g. POE).\n&gt;\n&gt; As a point of reference, Red Hat are doing similar things in the  \n&gt; cloud space with the recent launch of Deltacloud. A quick look at  \n&gt; the libcloud-list archives shows a swarm of @... names  \n&gt; working together and either completely ignoring or dismissing  \n&gt; invitations for external collaboration. That&#39;s not to say that  \n&gt; [L]GPL contributions of specs and code aren&#39;t a good thing however  \n&gt; they come to be, but nothing I&#39;ve seen so far suggests that Red Hat  \n&gt; are genuinely interested in working with the community at large.  \n&gt; It&#39;s up to them to prove me wrong first.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sam\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Sep 18, 2009 at 7:00 AM, Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.johannesen@... \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; G`day Roy,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Sep 18, 2009 at 13:33, Roy T.

And to point out that\n&gt; semantics, albeit small and puny and carries great significance, is\n&gt; easy to get wrong. People do it all the time, in technical terms as in\n&gt; other walks of life.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, that&#39;s not what middleware means (it certainly isn&#39;t tied to  \n&gt; OO).\n&gt;\n&gt; I said &quot;traditional middleware&quot;, as in whatever ilk sprung out of the\n&gt; enterprisey world, mostly. Yes, sure, that&#39;s not what middleware means\n&gt; for the anal retentive, but I suspect that&#39;s what it means to Red Hat\n&gt; et and enterprise developers throughout the world, a rather large\n&gt; group of people. And I was being a bit tounge-in-cheek assessing\n&gt; structures (resources, hierarchies, categories, tags, whatever) to\n&gt; *simulate* OO more than anything, and certainly wasn&#39;t saying\n&gt; middleware=OO. Sheesh.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; People whinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias. Um,  \n&gt; computer\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scientists have a bias too, even people who have no bias have a  \n&gt; basic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophical bias, and these semantics *will* affect (as oppose to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mere observatory notions) the work that is done. The argument of  \n&gt; bias\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is mostly moot (but not completely, of course). I personally get  \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feeling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the  \n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; business bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and  \n&gt; went\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time,  \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as such I *really* welcome it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked to see a\n&gt; &gt; new Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a\n&gt; &gt; filet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; WTF is wrong with you people?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re jumping your gun and seeing opposition and weird shit\n&gt; where there isn&#39;t any, well, not in my camp, anyway. Let&#39;s change the\n&gt; allegory to fit better with my point; Would you welcome it if you went\n&gt; shopping and realized you had bought the wrong kind of salami?\n&gt;\n&gt; Eh, screw the allegories. All I was saying is that even if they are\n&gt; misguided, kicking them in the shin is no good way to convince them\n&gt; otherwise. All you&#39;re doing is creating enemies, and as much as we all\n&gt; have our buckets of patience with people grasping what REST is all\n&gt; about filled up pretty high, don&#39;t let it overflow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why don&#39;t you trademark REST and just be done with it? Should be easy\n&gt; to suss out any disputes if you really wanted to then? You know, just\n&gt; for laughs? Linus did it, and so can you ...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set\n&gt; &gt; themselves up as the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards\n&gt; &gt; organization on a topic for which they not only had NOTHING to\n&gt; &gt; do with creating and know NOTHING about, but for which they\n&gt; &gt; actually sell products that are the exact opposite of RESTful\n&gt; &gt; architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, I think most people here is in agreement with that. It was a\n&gt; stupid move, especially without some anchoring with hardcore REST\n&gt; people or organisations. Or, you know, you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The organization claims that it will specify REST\n&gt; &gt; standards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dictators\n&gt; &gt; in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals would be\n&gt; &gt; allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL),\n&gt; &gt; and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the board\n&gt; &gt; to ensure that never changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill has said they&#39;re open to change it, and no matter how evil you\n&gt; think RH is, anything has to start somewhere. Why not just see it as a\n&gt; honest starting point? The truth will be flushed out *extremely* quick\n&gt; if we all jumped on it and made it truly RESTful, no? (Assuming fixing\n&gt; the governing model, of course, which Bill says they are happy to do.\n&gt; I don&#39;t know these people, and can only take them at face value)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Leads\n&gt; &gt; owning the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because\n&gt; &gt; they know damn well that their current market is shrinking: their\n&gt; &gt; entire product architecture is based on J2EE, the giant black\n&gt; &gt; hole of Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t a lot of innovation happen this way, though? (And I&#39;m not\n&gt; stating their two specs are innovative; they&#39;re not)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that\n&gt; &gt; is found in my dissertation.  This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; AssHat version of REST\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, yes, unless others get involved. They&#39;ve thrown out the\n&gt; invitation to us, too. Join it, and make sure it doesn&#39;t end up as\n&gt; AssHatMiddleWare(TM) or something.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bill Burke is not evangelizing REST throughout the Java world.\n&gt; &gt; What he is evangelizing is the same old architectures that he\n&gt; &gt; evangelized as J2EE and WS-* -- the only difference is that now\n&gt; &gt; he starts off calling them REST.  All he is doing is making\n&gt; &gt; people like you confused over what is REST and what is not, in\n&gt; &gt; the hope of making a business out of clambering onto yet\n&gt; &gt; another buzzword.\n&gt;\n&gt; People like me confused about REST? I&#39;m a RESTafarian of over 5 years,\n&gt; so no, that&#39;s not it. I think you&#39;re mistaking my meeker approach to\n&gt; this hubbub as an embracing their ways. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just saying,\n&gt; don&#39;t be a jerk even if you think they are jerks. The RESTafarian\n&gt; movement needs less jerking off, and more stability and acceptance,\n&gt; especially in the enterprise area (IMHO). If this could be tweaked\n&gt; into such a channel, then I&#39;m all for it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, I see no reason to appreciate that nonsense.  Not in the least.\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t care if it was an &quot;honest mistake&quot; or a deliberate attempt\n&gt; &gt; at fraud -- the result is the same.  Only a complete idiot would\n&gt; &gt; participate in such a forum.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, ouch, and ouch, indeed.

Red Hat is committed to working wi=\r\nth open source communities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for bringing th=\r\nat to my attention.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 18 Sep 2009, at 12:14, Sam Johnston wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-interchange-newline&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;App=\r\nle-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); fon=\r\nt-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: n=\r\normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; or=\r\nphans: 2; text-align: auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-s=\r\npace: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spaci=\r\nng: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-=\r\neffect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0p=\r\nx; &quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexander,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m 100% with Roy on this o=\r\nne.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/deltacloud-devel/2009-S=\r\neptember/000138.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple=\r\n-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;a week or two ago that something was fishy w=\r\nith the REST-* governance, with a view to having it changed so myself and o=\r\nthers could get involved:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gma=\r\nil_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; =\r\nmargin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204=\r\n, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex; &quot;&gt;FWIW REST-* sounds l=\r\nike something I could get behind but to be completely&nbsp;candid (as alway=\r\ns) I&#39;m disappointed to see similar&nbsp;governance shenanigans&nbsp;to thos=\r\ne that undermined the&nbsp;WS-I: &quot;Red&nbsp;Hat, as the founder of REST-*, g=\r\nets a permanent seat on the board.

Yes, sure, that&#39;s not what middleware means&lt;br&gt;=\r\nfor the anal retentive, but I suspect that&#39;s what it means to Red Hat&lt;br&gt;et=\r\n and enterprise developers throughout the world, a rather large&lt;br&gt;group of=\r\n people. And I was being a bit tounge-in-cheek assessing&lt;br&gt;structures (res=\r\nources, hierarchies, categories, tags, whatever) to&lt;br&gt;*simulate* OO more t=\r\nhan anything, and certainly wasn&#39;t saying&lt;br&gt;middleware=3DOO.

The argument of bias&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; is mostly moot (but no=\r\nt completely, of course). I personally get the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; feeling that the=\r\nse REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; business=\r\n bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; wi=\r\nth it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; as such I *really* welcome it.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Would you welcome it if =\r\nyou went to a car dealer, asked to see a&lt;br&gt;&gt; new Camaro, and he insiste=\r\nd on showing you a Winnebago instead?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Would you welcome it =\r\nif you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a&lt;br&gt;&gt; filet-o-fish sandwich, and=\r\n they gave you a Big Mac instead?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; WTF is wrong with you peo=\r\nple?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think you&#39;re jumping your gun and seeing opposition and=\r\n weird shit&lt;br&gt;where there isn&#39;t any, well, not in my camp, anyway.

All I was saying is that even if they are&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;misguided, kicking them in the shin is no good way to convince them&lt;br&gt;o=\r\ntherwise. All you&#39;re doing is creating enemies, and as much as we all&lt;br&gt;ha=\r\nve our buckets of patience with people grasping what REST is all&lt;br&gt;about f=\r\nilled up pretty high, don&#39;t let it overflow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why don&#39;t you trademark=\r\n REST and just be done with it? Should be easy&lt;br&gt;to suss out any disputes =\r\nif you really wanted to then? You know, just&lt;br&gt;for laughs? Linus did it, a=\r\nnd so can you ...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) uni=\r\nlaterally decided to set&lt;br&gt;&gt; themselves up as the equivalent of Sun wit=\r\nhin a JCP-like standards&lt;br&gt;&gt; organization on a topic for which they not=\r\n only had NOTHING to&lt;br&gt;&gt; do with creating and know NOTHING about, but f=\r\nor which they&lt;br&gt;&gt; actually sell products that are the exact opposite of=\r\n RESTful&lt;br&gt;&gt; architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yeah, I think most people here =\r\nis in agreement with that. It was a&lt;br&gt;stupid move, especially without some=\r\n anchoring with hardcore REST&lt;br&gt;people or organisations. Or, you know, you=\r\n.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The organization claims that it will specify REST&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; standards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dictators&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals would be&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL),&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the board&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; to ensure that never changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Bill has said they&#39;re open to=\r\n change it, and no matter how evil you&lt;br&gt;think RH is, anything has to star=\r\nt somewhere. Why not just see it as a&lt;br&gt;honest starting point? The truth w=\r\nill be flushed out *extremely* quick&lt;br&gt;if we all jumped on it and made it =\r\ntruly RESTful, no? (Assuming fixing&lt;br&gt;the governing model, of course, whic=\r\nh Bill says they are happy to do.&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know these people, and can onl=\r\ny take them at face value)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; And, guess what -- the organiza=\r\ntion starts with a couple Spec Leads&lt;br&gt;&gt; owning the topics that JBoss w=\r\nants to SELL YOU as REST, because&lt;br&gt;&gt; they know damn well that their cu=\r\nrrent market is shrinking: their&lt;br&gt;&gt; entire product architecture is bas=\r\ned on J2EE, the giant black&lt;br&gt;&gt; hole of Java that is sucking itself int=\r\no oblivion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Doesn&#39;t a lot of innovation happen this way, thoug=\r\nh? (And I&#39;m not&lt;br&gt;stating their two specs are innovative; they&#39;re not)&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; But, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; is found in my dissertation. &nbsp;This will be the new, &quot;Pragmati=\r\nc&quot;,&lt;br&gt;&gt; AssHat version of REST&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well, yes, unless others ge=\r\nt involved. They&#39;ve thrown out the&lt;br&gt;invitation to us, too.

I&#39;m a RESTafarian of over =\r\n5 years,&lt;br&gt;so no, that&#39;s not it. I think you&#39;re mistaking my meeker approa=\r\nch to&lt;br&gt;this hubbub as an embracing their ways. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just saying,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;don&#39;t be a jerk even if you think they are jerks. The RESTafarian&lt;br&gt;mov=\r\nement needs less jerking off, and more stability and acceptance,&lt;br&gt;especia=\r\nlly in the enterprise area (IMHO). If this could be tweaked&lt;br&gt;into such a =\r\nchannel, then I&#39;m all for it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; No, I see no reason to appre=\r\nciate that nonsense. &nbsp;Not in the least.&lt;br&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t care if it was=\r\n an &quot;honest mistake&quot; or a deliberate attempt&lt;br&gt;&gt; at fraud -- the result=\r\n is the same. &nbsp;Only a complete idiot would&lt;br&gt;&gt; participate in such=\r\n a forum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well, ouch, and ouch, indeed. So &quot;honest mistake&quot; is=\r\n unforgivable and&lt;br&gt;unworkable in your world?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nAlex&lt;br&gt;--&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project Wr=\r\nangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps&lt;br&gt;---&lt;span=\r\n class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://shelter.nu/=\r\nblog/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://shelter.nu/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-co=\r\nnverted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;----------------------------------------------&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;------------------&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/alexander.johannesen&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/profiles/alexander.johannesen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;A=\r\npple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both; =\r\npadding-top: 15px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 3px; padding-left: 0=\r\npx; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden; &quot;&gt;&lt;br class=3D&quot;webkit-block-pla=\r\nceholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both; =\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div width=\r\n=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both; &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquot=\r\ne&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-27-94082874--\r\n\n"}}
