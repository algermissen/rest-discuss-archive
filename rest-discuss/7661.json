However, I&#39;m a little\n&gt; surprised at the amount of effort I&#39;m having to expend to get people to\n&gt; consider the question at all. The trouble people are going to evade it\n&gt; suggests to me that this is a very uncomfortable point for a lot of\n&gt; folks, and maybe the REST model (or at least HTTP) has some trouble here.\n\nAs I understand your question, you are purely concerned with shoulder-surfing.\n\nIf so, then your issue is technically with the browser rather than\nRESTful architecture.\n\n&gt; So far I think the two or three folks who&#39;ve actually addressed the\n&gt; question square on have come down in favor of using POST despite the\n&gt; safety of the operation.\n\nThere seems to be a general consensus across the thread that the\nhigh-level solution is to encode the sensitive data string on the\nquerystring.\n\nThis this can be achieved in a number of ways:\n1. POST the value(s) and the server redirects the browser to a URI\nwith the encoded value(s)\n2. Encode the value(s) in the browser, either with local javascript or\nvia a an AJAX server call, and then update the html hrefs using the\nDOM.\n\nDon&#39;t forget the third alternative:\n3. Redesign the web application to avoid the need to use sensitive\nvalue(s) on a GET.\n\nRegards, Alan Dean\n\n"}}
