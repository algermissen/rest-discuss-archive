The flexibility afforded HTTP methods through various headers \nmakes this sort of formulation somewhat difficult but, I believe, not \nimpossible. My approach essentially boils down to treating HTTP as a \ncoordination language, similar to those of Linda-like tuplespaces, and \nthen applying techniques developed within the coordination languages \ncommunity over the last 20+ years since Linda was introduced.\n\nWhile not wanting to lay all my cards down on the table right now, I do \nfeel that I&#39;ve made some progress in this area and look forward to \ndiscussing my research with a broader community. That being said, and \nsince Mark already announced it on another list, I&#39;ll be presenting a \nlighter version of my advancement talk this coming Thursday in Palo Alto:\n&lt;http://www.commerce.net/events/?post=/2006/04/131600.a684eceee76fc522773286a895bc8436.html&gt;\nIf you&#39;re in the Bay Area, you might be interested in stopping by to see \nwhat all the fuss is about.  :-)\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\n"}}
