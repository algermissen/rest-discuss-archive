The reasons are quite simple. Where data is\n&gt; being entered, updated, deleted, actively managed, ..., you need to be able\n&gt; to express access control policies (because not all data are public), and\n&gt; you need to be able to say who has responsibility for doing what on what data\n&gt; (because people need to be able to collaborate and coordinate their work).\n\nWeb-Access-Control[1] is still an issue that have to be tackled. \nHowever, also there is some progress to establish it on the data level, \ni.e. WebID[2] or more coarse-grained CORS[3].\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, if you told me to break down those boundaries, merge all the data, and\n&gt; let someone query it (say, with SPARQL), right now I&#39;d run a mile, because\n&gt; I can&#39;t see how you could do that and still respect access controls. Maybe\n&gt; someone has done some clever work building access control policies into a\n&gt; SPARQL query engine, that would be interesting.\n\nI guess, nobody expect from you to &quot;merge all the data&quot; and no common \nhuman agent is interested in having all data e.g., I want only \nadditional stuff that related . With SPARQL 1.1 the SERVICE operator \nshould be introduced to enable federated queries across SPARQL services \n(that can also be describe, see [4]). Of course, we need to get to run \nsuch systems efficiently. I&#39;m also able to combine Web-Access-Control \nwith federated queries e.g., an example from Virtuoso [5] for protected \nSPARQL endpoint access. Again, under the overall and universal \npre-condition of an acceptable performance. I guess, the developments of \nhardware that can process such tasks efficiently are promising and quite \nfaster than in the past, or?\n\n&gt; Anyway, I just thought it was interesting that sometimes you want to melt\n&gt; down all the boundaries and see your data as one big open-ended graph, and\n&gt; sometimes you want to see your data as (er, information?) resources with\n&gt; concrete representations and well defined boundaries.\n\nGood statement! Although, what I see and what I can get are two \ndifferent things, or? I guess, a user would be more exited about &quot;open \ndoors&quot; rather then &quot;closed rooms&quot;. The starting point might be still \n&quot;give me man app for that&quot;. However, this app should be one with \n(literally) &quot;open doors&quot;. Whether the user would be delegated seamlessly \n(!) to another app (e.g. change from facebook to youtube) or the task \ne.g., an exploration, would be continue inside this app (e.g. playing \nback the youtube video inside facebook) shouldn&#39;t really matter \n(somehow). What counts is the overall user experience, or? I tend to \nsay, that today an &quot;app delegation&quot; isn&#39;t always such seemless.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n\n[1] http://esw.w3.org/WebAccessControl\n[2] http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/charter\n[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/\n[4] http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/\n[5] http://ods.openlinksw.com/wiki/main/Main/VirtSPARQLSSL\n\n"}}
