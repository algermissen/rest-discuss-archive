I read, in your message from 02\n&gt;Jul 2007 11:49:46:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the filesize is greater than zero bytes and the DELETE is\n&gt;&gt; unconditional, the response is 409 Conflict with a message body\n&gt;&gt; “Unconditional DELETE request detected.”\n&gt;\n&gt;Which indicated to me that if the client tries to DELETE a resource\n&gt;without supplying the If-Match header, the DELETE will fail.\n&gt;\n\nRight, that&#39;s when I was using an If-None-Match on the first DELETE, \nAristotle suggested using an If-Match on the second DELETE instead, \nand that is exactly the change I made.  I should note that I&#39;m a bit \nembarrassed for not catching that myself.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
