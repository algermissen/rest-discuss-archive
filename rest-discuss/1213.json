A problem I always have\nremembering that the two URI are two completely separate resources (from the\npoint of view of clients &#39;outside the interface&#39;) even though they look\nsimilar.\nThe full list could just as easily have been\n GET http://somehost.org/package/names?all\nor\n GET http://somehost.org/package/allnames\nor whatever.\n\nSomething to remember is that even though http://somehost.org/package/names\nis part of both URI, that doesn&#39;t make it &#39;the one resource&#39;.\nThe second URI (with the query terms) is not &#39;the one resource&#39; plus\nparameters - it is a separate resource. You may have a singular data source\nwithin your implementation (like a database) but outside your interface you\nexpose things as separate resources.\nKind of like creating a view in a database - which makes a query look like a\ntable.\n\nSo a more illustrative example (not that you should change your URIs) to\nshow that they are separate resources might be\n GET http://somehost.org/package/allnames\n GET http://somehost.org/package/names?like=regex\n\n\n\n\n"}}
