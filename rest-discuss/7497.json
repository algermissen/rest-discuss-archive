People may  \n: use the URI to glean information about the information architecture  \n: of the site. Jakob Nielsen talks about this topic here:\n: \n: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html\n\nWebarch [1] is pretty clear on the topic, though.  Agents should\nnot infer properties from the URI, and &quot;agents&quot; means both people\nand machines.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-opacity\n\n: \n: In observing my own behavior while using other people&#39;s web sites, I  \n: noticed I occasionally find myself hacking off pieces of a URI in the  \n: hopes of finding something conceptually higher up in the hierarchy.  \n: It usually didn&#39;t work, but I tried. I did not add things to URIs,  \n: but I did try to subtract things. I want URI hacking that to always  \n: work at the websites whose URIs and information architecture I  \n: design. Where I depart from Mike&#39;s approach is that I would still  \n: pick one hierarchy from his many possibilities, and have one  \n: canonical URI for each resource.\n\nWhy design to such a limited audience?  Why not improve the\nrepresentations (i.e., linking) instead?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
