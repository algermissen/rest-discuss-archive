Or so we&#39;re t=\r\nold.. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; The forms offer insight in to what the server is expecting for=\r\n a particular\n&gt; operation.\n&gt;\n&gt; The interface will evolve in both directions=\r\n. On the server side, in the\n&gt; number and variety of links that it publishe=\r\ns as the client navigates.\n&gt; Whether a client can actually recognize and su=\r\npport the new links is not\n&gt; really relevant. The clients (especially machi=\r\nne clients) will remain\n&gt; steadfast in their interpretation of the represen=\r\ntation until a &quot;breaking&quot;\n&gt; event happens.\n&gt;\n&gt; This breaking event is eithe=\r\nr some underlying, foundation failure (i.e. the\n&gt; format has changed beyond=\r\n recognition for the client), or its imposed\n&gt; externally upon the client b=\r\ny the clients controller (for example the want\n&gt; to now support some of thi=\r\ns new functionality).\n&gt;\n&gt; Through inspection, a client can look at the reso=\r\nurce representation and\n&gt; determine what links are supported by the server,=\r\n and match that list to the\n&gt; understanding of the client, as in which of t=\r\nhose links it knows how to\n&gt; follow based on their rels.\n&gt;\n&gt; From an input =\r\nperspective, the FORM publishes the information that the\n&gt; server wants to =\r\nknow. The process for the client is the same. The client\n&gt; will have to evo=\r\nlve in order to handle any new form fields just like it\n&gt; would have to evo=\r\nlve to handle any new links that it discovers.=A0 But the\n&gt; client will con=\r\ntinue to process the &quot;old way&quot; until the breaking event\n&gt; occurs.\n\ni.e. in =\r\nthis respect, forms achieve the same thing as link relations\nbut in a more =\r\ncomplicated way?\n\n&gt; In a space of several servers, using compatible represe=\r\nntations, the use of\n&gt; the form can be used to allow, for example, a more s=\r\nophisticated client to\n&gt; interact with a less sophisticated server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Con=\r\nsider the case of a purchasing agent wanting to forward credit card\n&gt; infor=\r\nmation. A modern server would likely want not just the normal CC info\n&gt; (nu=\r\nmber, name, exp date) but also that magic code on the back of the card.\n&gt; A=\r\nn older server may not require that extra code.\n&gt;\n&gt; A client that is capabl=\r\ne and aware of that code would see that an older\n&gt; server is simply not ask=\r\ning for this information and will there for not\n&gt; provide it rather than ju=\r\nst cramming it down the servers throat &quot;because\n&gt; they all do this&quot;.\n\nThe p=\r\nroblem with this is that it can be handled trivially on the\nserver side (by=\r\n ignoring irrelevant parts of the client request), in\ncontrast to the compl=\r\nexity introduced on the client side by requiring\nthem to incorporate dynami=\r\nc form interaction to their work flow.\n\nMost people want to make life as ea=\r\nsy as possible for their clients.\nIf there&#39;s a means to an ends resulting i=\r\nn less complexity for clients\nit&#39;s very likely that will get picked - and r=\r\nightly so.\n\n&gt; In the end, the client needs to understand how to interpret w=\r\nhat it sees in\n&gt; the payloads, and well as how to populate the forms that a=\r\nre requested by\n&gt; the servers. The advantage of the forms is that it lets t=\r\nhe servers be\n&gt; reasonably explicit as to what it wants without having to r=\r\nely on the client\n&gt; simply &quot;knowing&quot;. With friendly clients and servers, th=\r\nis makes the both\n&gt; ends of the interface much more evolutionary, and uses =\r\nin band information\n&gt; to manage this to boot.\n\nI disagree that the result i=\r\ns much more evolutionary. Afaict, omitting\nand renaming the data produced b=\r\ny clients at run time is the extent of\nthe additional capabilities forms in=\r\ntroduce. As I said above, I&#39;m\nunconvinced that the cost of adding significa=\r\nnt additional\nrequirements to interact with your application outweigh the b=\r\nenefits -\nparticularly given that the benefits seem to be at best marginal,=\r\n and\nat worst non-existent.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
