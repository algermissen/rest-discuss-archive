It depends on who you \nwant to do business with, and what they already have implemented, if \nanything.  If you&#39;re trading in a particular vertical industry, you \nshould look around for industry standards.  Just Google &quot;industryName \nXML&quot;.\n\nxCBL is a reasonable default choice today.  The global standards \nsituation is murky.  \n\nYou might watch UBL, which is sort-of the next generation xCBL, but I \ndon&#39;t think they have any documents ready yet:\nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/\nOr UN/CEFACT&#39;s eBTWG Core Components project, the successor the the \nebXML Core Components group, but they don&#39;t have any documents ready \nyet either:\nhttp://www.ebtwg.org/projects/core.html\n\nThere have been signs of convergence between UBL and UN/CEFACT Core \nComponents and ANSI X12, but as far as I know, it hasn&#39;t happened yet \nand there are plenty of counter-indications, too.\n\nOne thing I learned from working with standards orgs is that they are \nalmost (?) as competitive as software vendors.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
