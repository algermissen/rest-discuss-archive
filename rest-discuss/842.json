If I understand your proposal correctly, you would always\n&gt; make acceptance a substantive response, which works fine for me.\nWhen there is a substantive business document, I would always want a\nfirst-class resource (uri, etc.).\nThere is probably always going to be a business document for full acceptance\nof a business request - correct me if I&#39;m wrong.\nThe initial submission ack might not have a substantive business document\ndefined.\n\nIf we POST a biz doc and return an &#39;Accepted&#39; status to indicate that the\ndocument was transferred but not yet processed,\nI&#39;m not sure about returning a Location header (the http rfc doesn&#39;t mention\nit - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.3 ).\nThe existence of a document might imply business acceptance - which is not\ncorrect. If the business process defines acknowledgement or status documents\nthat have &#39;accepted&#39;, &#39;rejected&#39; and &#39;undecided&#39; values, then this would be\nfine I think (retrieving the status document tells you if it was actually\napproved). If the business document set doesn&#39;t define &#39;undecided&#39; values\nthen the Location header might need to reference a resource that does not\nyet exist - and when it does exist the values within would specify\n&#39;accepted&#39; or &#39;rejected&#39;.\n\nIf a Location header isn&#39;t returned immediately, there is no defined way to\nget the status - which is why I added the Reply-To header in the original\nPOST. A later PUT from the server would have the equivalent of a response\nwith a &#39;created&#39; status and a Location header. In the example I used &quot;200\nsuccess&quot; and it probably should be &quot;201 Created&quot; with a Location header,\neven if the URI was returned as a header in the initial Accepted response.\n\n\n\n"}}
