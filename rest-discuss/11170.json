The URIs alone\ndon=E2=80=99t te=\r\nll me anything about the hypermedia and the expected\ninteractions, so that =\r\nlist of links gives no indication of how\nRESTful or not the system really i=\r\ns.\n\n&gt; My point is that putting verbs in URLs doesn&#39;t induce useful\n&gt; behavi=\r\nour. if it did, the more bizarre corners Flickr and\n&gt; del.icio.us&#39; APIs wou=\r\nldn&#39;t exit. You can have a design that\n&gt; allows you say incoherent things a=\r\nnd result in bugs, like\n&gt; having a overly finegrained programming API where=\r\n users can\n&gt; call methods out of order. Without the constraints in place,\n&gt;=\r\n you need lots of discipline win, or heaven forbid, governance.\n\nI might ha=\r\nve agreed with you some time ago, but now I consider\nthis to be a confusion=\r\n of cause and effect that may have harmful\neffects. Telling people to only =\r\nuse nouns in their URIs will make\ntheir systems only marginally more RESTfu=\r\nl, if that much, and may\nactively make them *less* RESTful in that it teach=\r\nes people to\nfocus on the design of URIs and not of their hypermedia.\n\nWhic=\r\nh is a recipe for creating REST-RPC hybrids!\n\nAnd it is also the explanatio=\r\nn for APIs like Flickr=E2=80=99s or\ndel.icio.us=E2=80=99s. They stem from a=\r\nn unhealthy focus on URIs with\nonly incidental attention to representations=\r\n.\n\nThe focus should be the exact opposite.\n\n&gt; What&#39;s most interesting to me=\r\n is that I think many programmers\n&gt; in the field prefer RPC or REST-RPC hyb=\r\nrids.\n\nBecause they don=E2=80=99t think in terms of hypermedia, and none of=\r\n the\nlibraries and frameworks we have try to address this at all. So\npeople=\r\n do not even realise that they are missing the most\nimportant part of the p=\r\nuzzle, and even once they do, they have\nto put in all the work themselves. =\r\nI know of no libraries that\ntry to model RESTful systems by providing abstr=\r\nactions of the\nstructures of media types and the links and forms in them.\n\n=\r\nThe continuation-based web frameworks are actually closer to such\nan ideal =\r\nthan the Rails/Django/Catalyst class.\n\n\n* Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.j=\r\nohannesen@...&gt; [2008-08-09 10:45]:\n&gt; On Sat, Aug 9, 2008 at 00:48, Ar=\r\nistotle Pagaltzis &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; http://example.org/foo-coll=\r\nection/create # and\n&gt; &gt; http://example.org/foo-collection/bar-item/edit\n&gt; .=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; What you GET from\n&gt; &gt; them is an HTML form that POSTs or PUTs to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; http://example.org/foo-collection # or\n&gt; &gt; http://example.org/foo-coll=\r\nection/bar-item\n&gt; \n&gt; But why do this at all? Just a GET on\n&gt; http://example=\r\n.org/foo-collection should provide you with a\n&gt; number of forms that do dif=\r\nferent things, including the one you\n&gt; have at http://example.org/foo-colle=\r\nction/create. It should\n&gt; provide you with content-types (one for the UI, o=\r\nne for your\n&gt; app, another for some other function, etc.) you need.\n\nBecaus=\r\ne browsers need many different views at this collection,\nof which the creat=\r\nion POST form is just one, and they don=E2=80=99t do\nuseful conneg. And UI =\r\ndesign demands putting the views on\nseparate screens. If I used Javascript =\r\nheavily, I could put all\nthe screens in a single representation and use JS =\r\nto flip the\nscreens, but that strikes me as, err, suboptimal design, not\nle=\r\nast because it requires Javascript for a very basic aspect of\nthe functiona=\r\nlity. Another problem is that *of course*, you *do*\nwant to be able to link=\r\n directly to a particular screen;\nengineer for serendipity and all that.\n\nS=\r\no whatever I do I=E2=80=99ll end up with different URIs for the various\nscr=\r\neens, and at that point it=E2=80=99s technically indistinguishable\nfrom the=\r\n discussion about how explicit URIs for content-\nnegotiable forms of repres=\r\nentations should look. I could just as\nwell call those `foo-collection.crea=\r\nte` and `bar-item.edit` for\nall it matters.\n\n&gt; &gt; Looking for verbs in URIs =\r\n(and avoiding them) is useful as a\n&gt; &gt; way of getting used to thinking in R=\r\nEST terms, but it&#39;s not\n&gt; &gt; essential or inherent to REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is tru=\r\ne, although I think they&#39;re evil in the sense that\n&gt; it makes your resource=\r\ns mimic RPC which only leads to the dark\n&gt; side.\n\nJust how does it mimic RP=\r\nC? Can you point to any REST constraint\nthat my design violates?\n\nAs a ment=\r\nal exercise, consider that substituting random strings\nfor each URI (like `=\r\nhttp://example.org/aslsdlllixpa1dkj3` and\n`http://example.org/xysdlapowpq9w=\r\nkhjxq`) would not change the app\nin any way. It would be more laborious for=\r\n the server to mint\nsuch URIs but as far as the browser=E2=80=99s interacti=\r\non with the server\nis concerned, and as far as the sequence of screens the =\r\nuser sees\nand interacts with, nothing at all would change. The only\ndiffere=\r\nnce would be the contents of various `href`s. You could\neven use a differen=\r\nt, randomly chosen host name for each link,\nas long as all those servers co=\r\noperate properly. In what way does\nthis strike you as RPC?\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAr=\r\nistotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
