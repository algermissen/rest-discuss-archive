So I think it\n&gt; &gt; worthwhile to tell them to try it first before they do\n&gt; &gt; anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; And in the case where it is a good fit, there is then a need to\n&gt; again define the interacts for each use-case (beyond the\n&gt; nomimal case of &quot;publish.&quot;)\n\nSure, but they’ll have to define those anyway. Atompub just takes\ncare of predefining the lower-level machinery so it doesn’t have\nto be reinvented over and over by everyone who has similar needs.\n\n&gt; One thing I dislike about AtomPub, and I know I&#39;m probably in\n&gt; the minority here, is it requires special tools to interact\n&gt; with vs. just having a browser,\n\nWait, first you’re telling me you don’t like one-size-fits-all\nadvocacy for Atompub, then you tell me we should just shoehorn\nall apps into the browser? :-)\n\nMe, I hope that Atompub uptake is strong enough that we’ll see\nbrowsers expand to support everything required that one day we\nshall, in fact, be able to interact with many Atompub services\nwith just a browser. (In fact, with XMLHttpRequest you already\ncan. Several people are working on such Atompub clients.)\n\nI don’t mean just Atompub support here, btw; I mean general\nsupport for more of HTTP (like methods other than GET and POST –\nwhat a concept!), and markup languages like HTML5 that allow\nusers to actually exploit this expanded support.\n\n&gt; it requires web services be created in addition to web pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d really advocate for exposing webservices as a default case\n&gt; via semantic HTML instead of AtomPub\n\nHow is that different? A WordPress blog has a public face and an\nadmin area. Isn’t it really kind of incidental what kind of\ncontent types get exchanged on which half of the service?\n\nThe important point is that no approach will remove this\npublic-vs-editable segregation for most apps.\n\nAnd semantic HTML, uhm, good luck repairing HTML-as-she-is-spoke\nsufficiently that it becomes machine-consumable, in a reasonable\ntimeframe. Not that I wouldn’t like that myself, but, while we\nmay all gaze at the stars, we’re still down here in this gutter.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
