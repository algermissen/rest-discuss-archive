This can\nbe done for custom-designed media types[1] designed for a single\napplication domain and for existing (domain-agnostic) media types that\nsupport adding semantic meaning using &quot;decorators&quot; (@id, @name, @class,\n@rel)[2].\n\nThe advantage of this approach (for the work I do) is that both servers and\nclients can use he same document; even work on development efforts\nindependently, asynchronously. This works no matter the\nOS/Platform/Framework, etc. This approach also supports extending the\nimplementation to support changes in the domain model w/ relatively little\nadditional effort since adding new features is often done by adding\nnew representations of data in the existing media type (i.e. no changes in\nthe media type). And when changes in the media type are required, it can\nalmost always be done w/o breaking any existing implementations (client or\nserver).\n\nThe downside of this approach is that both client and server need to\nunderstand enough of the application protocol (HTTP) to be able to\nimplement successful components based on media type documentation. This\nkind of work is not &quot;automatically&quot; supported in any framework I know of\ntoday. That means some of the early work on a project takes more effort\nthan just pointing an editor at a known URI and waiting for that editor to\ngenerate connector code for a set of exposed URIs w/ arguments.\n\nI cover the details of this approach in a recently released book[3].\n\n[1] http://amundsen.com/media-types/maze/\n[2] http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/profiles/\n[3] http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 1, 2011 at 11:26, Erik Wilde &lt;dret@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; hello carlos.\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2011-11-30 21:08 , Carlos Eberhardt wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is anyone using something like WADL for service definition\n&gt; documentation?
