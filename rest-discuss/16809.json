A web services is business functionality that is exposed through a unifor=\r\nm interface.\n2. A RESTFul WS is a web services that is implemented followin=\r\ng the REST constrains, aiming (I hope) to get the REST benefits (Not all WS=\r\n apply)\n\nThat said, I feel your question assumes a RESTful WS is an artifac=\r\nt, like a server or middleware, that uses HTTP (Jax-RS perhaps?). Or even w=\r\norse, a web service may be some method called by HTTP means.\n\nWell, not, it=\r\n is not. It is something far more complex. The Skeleton you mention is actu=\r\nally a set of resources, not something outside REST but part of the system.=\r\n Apache server is not more than a name for a web server that is a server in=\r\n the REST sense. If getting a web page (which is a resource&#39;s representatio=\r\nn with links to other resources) is the first step for a WS, then it is par=\r\nt of that WS. In other words, a WS is that sequence of steps, operations, f=\r\nlow that uses all HTTP operations on server and resources to achieve the go=\r\nal you are seeking. Under that abstraction, the question of whether the res=\r\nource is served by Apache or by a JAX-RS implementation makes no sense. See=\r\n?   \n\nHope this clarifies a little.\n\nRegards.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n--=\r\n- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;photogspassion&quot; &lt;artyyeo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; As you all know, most Web 2.0 pages are quite dynamic in nature. After a =\r\nskeleton webpage is loaded, AJAX kicks in to get customized info and they s=\r\ntart injecting live data into the page asynchronously and dynamically. Hope=\r\nfully, the AJAX calls are talking to RESTful WS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Question: In a RESTfu=\r\nl system, who/what will be serving those initial base skeleton webpages (wh=\r\nich may include HTML, JS scripts, locations to grab CSS, etc)? Is the same =\r\nJAXB-RS server also serving these skeleton webpages? If not, would it be wi=\r\nse to use Apache to serve these webpages while the WS themselves are servic=\r\ned by RESTful WS?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
