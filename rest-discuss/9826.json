The filter criteria cannot be specified as part of the\n&gt; URI as it is a fairly complex object that needs to get into the request\n&gt; body.  So my request-line will be GET &#92;data with the filter criteria\n&gt; coming in via the entity body. However, from various sources, I gathered\n&gt; that it is not recommended to send data as part of the entity body when\n&gt; using GET, DELETE and so on. However, I could not find this mentioned\n&gt; explicitly in the HTTP standard.\n\nThe spec permits it, but you could conceivably run into problems with\ndeployed software and SDKs which don&#39;t.  AFAIK, the possibility for\nits use in the wild is completely untested.\n\n&gt; If that is correct, then would it be\n&gt; advisable to model the Filter as a resource to which I POST my criteria\n&gt; and it then gives back the result set? The request-line then would be\n&gt; something like POST &#92;filter with the filter criteria coming in via the\n&gt; entity body.\n\nYup.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
