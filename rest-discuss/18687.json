I think I will go with the &quot;fielding=\r\n&quot; properties approach - using x-www-form-urlencoded for the payload.\n\nAt fi=\r\nrst I though Mike was suggesting the client should be hard coded to know th=\r\nat it could add &quot;;props&quot; to all URLs, which is not exactly in line with his=\r\n work on hypermedia APIs ...\n\nThen I saw Fielding&#39;s comment: &quot;Note that the=\r\n entire URI prefix is determined by the origin server, so the properties mi=\r\nght even be on a different server than the resource.&quot; and figured that the =\r\nserver has to supply the exact link. Much better :-)\n\nSo, for now it become=\r\ns:\n\n1) Some resources in the system contains a link with the rel-type &quot;addi=\r\ntional-properties&quot;. This link points to the list of additional properties f=\r\nor that resource (at the URL &quot;{additional-properties}&quot;).\n \n2) The URL &quot;{add=\r\nitional-properties}&quot; returns a list of key/value properties for reading. Th=\r\nat &quot;list&quot; is represented with x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\n3) The whole set of p=\r\nroperties for one resource can be updated by PUTing a set of values (using =\r\nform-urlencoded again) to the &quot;{additional-properties}&quot; URL.\n\n4) The whole =\r\nset of properties for one resource can be delete by DELETing the &quot;{addition=\r\nal-properties}&quot; URL.\n\n5) It is not possible to update a single key/value pa=\r\nir by itself. Neither is that required in out current use cases (which allo=\r\nws a user to edit the whole set of values at once).\n\nThanks, J=C3=B8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
