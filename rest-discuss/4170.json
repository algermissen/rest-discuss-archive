Alexander Jacobson&quot; wrote:\n&gt; Note, I don&#39;t know how you implement\n&gt; PREPARE over the internet as it requires servers\n&gt; to allow long running locks, so perhaps you allow\n&gt; only COMMIT (and assume optimistic concurrency).\n\nSeveral patterns have been implemented by my employer for 2-phase \noutcome protocols (including PREPARE) that do not require long-\nrunning locks.  \n\nFor example:\n\nDo-Compensate:  Do the work in the active phase, Compensate (undo) \nupon ABORT, COMMIT is a no-op.\n\nValidate-Do: Validate that you *could* do the work in the active \nphase, Do the work upon COMMIT, ABORT is a no-op.\n\nProvisional-Do:  Do the work in the active phase but mark it \nprovisional.  Upon COMMIT, make it official.  Upon ABORT, undo the \nprovisional work, delete it, or mark it canceled.\n\nWhich pattern to use depends on context.  For example, Do-Compensate \nis no good for purchase orders.  You don&#39;t want them to be fulfilled \nif they are going to be aborted.\n\n\n\n"}}
