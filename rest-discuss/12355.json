Indeed that w=\r\nould be a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bizarre state of affairs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That depends. I see two case=\r\ns which I&#39;ll try to illustrate by (dumb)\n&gt;&gt; analogies:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1. Road signs =\r\n- I delete a road sign, the towns which it references do\n&gt;&gt; not get deleted=\r\n themselves *.\n&gt;&gt; 2. Boxes of chocolates - if I delete a box of chocolates,=\r\n I expect the\n&gt;&gt; chocolates themselves to be destroyed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So it&#39;s reall=\r\ny up to the semantics of the resource I want to delete, no?\n&gt;\n&gt; It could we=\r\nll be, but now your clients have to know about different types of\n&gt; resourc=\r\nes and how to map URLs to semantics, which is a different\n&gt; architecture st=\r\nyle than REST.\n&gt; If you treat all resources uniformly, since everyone under=\r\nstands DELETE to\n&gt; affect a single resource, the only thing getting deleted=\r\n is that single\n&gt; resource.\n\nIf I&#39;m using a REST application based on HATEO=\r\nAS, where the server\ngave me the URI of the collection, and an OPTIONS call=\r\n to that URI\nsays it responds to DELETE, I think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable =\r\nfor a\nclient to believe in what the server is declaring.  Whether the\nresou=\r\nrce being deleted is, in fact, a collection of other resources is\nnot relev=\r\nant.\n\n&gt; The last set of semantics is the hypermedia, where you have a large=\r\nr\n&gt; vocabulary to communicate more intents. You can differentiate between h=\r\nide,\n&gt; delete and archive, deal with individual items and collections, etc.=\r\n\n&gt; In my experience, it&#39;s best to never let the hypermedia alter the protoc=\r\nol\n&gt; semantics, so only ever use DELETE to remove a single resource.\n\nUnix =\r\nshells have essentially always let you have your choice about\ndeleting subd=\r\nirectories:\n\n* &quot;rmdir foo&quot; -- delete subdirectory foo, but only if it is em=\r\npty.\n\n* &quot;rm -rf foo&quot; -- delete subdirectory foo and all of its (potentially=\r\n\nnested) contents.\n\nBoth operations are semantically useful for this contex=\r\nt in different\nuse cases.  Clearly the second is a &quot;nice to have&quot; because y=\r\nou can\nimplement recursive loops to accomplish the same purpose, but if the=\r\n\nclient knows what it wants to do (delete this resource, whatever that\nhapp=\r\nens to mean), and the server gives the client a URI to the\ncollection that =\r\naccepts DELETE, it should darn well do the deed if it\nis asked to.\n\n&gt; Assaf=\r\n\n\nCraig\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jim\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * Offer not applicable to Slough.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
