For instance, an admin-level user will have options\n&gt; to modify a resource that a normal user won&#39;t have available... or\n\nThis is what I refer to earlier as &quot;limited-view&quot;. I contrasted this to\n&quot;full-view-with-errors&quot; which is where you give all users all the controls and\nthen shout at them if they press the wrong one. These are the names given to\nthose patterns in\n&lt;http://www.joeyoder.com/papers/patterns/Security/appsec.pdf&gt;.\n\nMy point being that it&#39;s perfectly possible for a client to use either pattern\nwhether the web service it uses presents all the relevant information in one\nresponse or many.\n\n&gt; what about something like user-definable formatting prefs? I like my\n&gt; /datetime resource formatted differently than you do, so my display of\n&gt; this data is different than yours, based on us having different logins.\n\nIn a case where it is necessary to deliver a human-readable representation\ndirectly from the server (i.e. web sites) then this can be a tricky issue. In\nthe example of dates we have a choice of either customising the representation\nper user, or of using a format that is unambiguous even when it is less than\nideal (e.g. &quot;2004-04-05&quot;, &quot;5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April, 2004&quot; and &quot;April 5, 2004&quot;\nare all unambiguous, 04/05/2004 and 05/04/2004 are useless[1]). There are quite\na few issues either way.\n\nIn the case of a REST service where the server is sending data then one would\njust send the data in an appropriate format for the machine (in the case of\ndates we would use one of the profiles of ISO 8601 common on the web) and\npresenting this to any user can become the client&#39;s job (which is in a much\nbetter position to reliably determine locale settings than the server).\n\nI&#39;m less dogmatic about per-user representations in the case of stylesheets\nprecisely because they deal with such issues although a user-stylesheet\nmechanism could better deal with this. However I try to put any per-user-agent\nhacks into the CSS alone when it comes to websites.\n\n&gt; Well, I see the issue as basically resource-specific gradations between\n&gt; &#39;full access&#39; and &#39;401 Unauthorized&#39;. The extremes are clearly allowed;\n&gt; why not the middle?\n\nAuthorised and unauthorised are concepts understood by the system. The rest of\nthe system (caching, firewalls) can understand them. An admin looking at the\ntraffic can understand them. Providing partial access through allowing full or\nno access to related resources is merely expressing this gradiated security in\na way the system understands. It&#39;s also similar to how other authorisation for\nfile-based, RDBMS-based and other systems works (either you can read or you\ncan&#39;t, either you can write or you can&#39;t, etc) and hence concepts of\nauthorisation that developers are used to building and security people are used\nto auditing.\n\n[1] An aside on this issue. I have an article on my site about date formats and\nthe web, focusing mainly on the behind-the-scene formats. Referrer logs\nindicate that there are a large number of people looking to use mm/dd/yyyy with\nXML Schemata, and a roughly equal number of people looking to use dd/mm/yyyy.\nAmusingly the words &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;more common&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; appear in the query\nstrings from both groups.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
