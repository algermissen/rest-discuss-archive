You do not get any other methods as the uniform set (the HTTP methods in the case of using HTTP as an architecture)\n\nWithout any intention to be rude, I suggest you take a while to read through some of the REST material out on the Web (the REST wiki at http://rest.blueoxen.net is a good starting point as is Paul&#39;s site at http://prescod.com/rest ). This will help in future discussions.\n\n\n&gt;Should I use &#39;POST&#39; with a &#39;method=build&#39; parameter to the &#39;plan&#39; URI?\n\nNo, this is about the worst from a REST POV as it is hidden RPC.\n\nThink along these lines:\n\nProvide a means for clients to pick a resource that behaves the way they are interested in (some hypermedia the clients come accross could declare a resource as a BuildingManager) and then use POST to submit the building plan.\n\nPOST /BuildingManager\nContent-Type: application/blueprint          &lt;-- this type is fictous; it would need to be standardized within the realm of your system\n\n&lt;blueprint&gt;\n  &lt;wall location=&quot;....&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/blueprint&gt;\n\n\nIOW, in a RESTful system clients late-bind to resources based on runtime-declared abstract bahavior of those resources and they communicate via a fixed set of methods.\n\nHTH,\n\nJan \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Ittay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
