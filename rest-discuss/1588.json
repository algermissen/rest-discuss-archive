What I&#39;m getting at is this: I can imagine that if/when REST\nreally catches on, this topic will be a very popular one, since people (like\nmyself) seem to have such a tendency to regress back to a procedural approach.\n\nIn your last message, you mentioned that you re-read some of the dissertation\nand can&#39;t find any references to methods/objects.  I&#39;ve been re-reading it too.\nOne thing I noticed was that in REST you have resources, and then you have\nrepresentations of resources that are transferred between components.\n\nOne type of component is a gateway (aka reverse proxy).  This is just like CGI.\nWhich is the source of many &quot;verb&quot; based designs on the web.  The implication I\nget in this section of the document (sect 5.2.3) is that while representations\nof resources are transferred to user agents directly from the origin server,\nmethod invocation is encapsulated away from the origin server and behind a\ngateway.  Do you get that implication as well?\n\nI&#39;ll keep reading and see if I can find something that more explicitly clarifies\nit.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
