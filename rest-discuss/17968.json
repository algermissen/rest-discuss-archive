However, my\n&gt; clients are purpose-built programs whose developers will be given\n&gt; some informations out of band.\n&gt;\n\nSurely this information can be written down and linked to in-band?\nHard-coded clients aren&#39;t such a bad thing if, at least, the shared\nunderstandings are linked to (as opposed to baked-in / out-of-band).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So my main question is what you labeled as &quot;question [1]&quot;: what is\n&gt; the best way to embed such an URI template in XHTML.\n&gt; \n\nOK, I think I see what you&#39;re after, this is rough but ought to make\neverybody happy (except that it&#39;s bad HTML5), and is what is meant by a\nself-documenting API...\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/stooges.txt\n\n...because the code is simpler than prosaic documentation, even though\nthe URIs are hypothetical and the XSLT, nonexistent.  Obviously, either\nXSLT or Javascript can be used to generate a UI from that information,\nwith the option of output in XHTML (whole pages) or JSON (snippets).\n\nUsing URI templates as an outright replacement for links and forms in\nXHTML, decouples both the choice of forms language and the method of\nURI generation.  The resulting XHTML (relying on pre-HTML5 &lt;object&gt;\nsyntax in more ways than one) is svelte, and reduces the need to look\ndeeper into the code to figure out how to build URLs in a way that&#39;s\nuniform across approaches / coding-language choices.\n\nRDFa is used to declare that the in-scope (domain-specific) vocabulary\nrepresents nicknames of people, the terms and meanings of the out-of-\nscope (shared understanding) vocabulary are left to the externally-\nlinked document.  The link is what counts, but @valuetype gives us the\nsemantics needed to do name-value expansion for a template passed in\n@data, a nice repurposing of obsolete code IMNSHO.\n\nNo, you don&#39;t have to use the XSLT (or JS), or use the service in a\nbrowser, but that option not only makes it easier for others to learn\nyour service (particularly if your markup is valid and accessible), it\nalso provides the opportunity to delimit which options from the shared\nvocabulary aren&#39;t supported locally (graying out a list item); the\nbenefit of XSLT/XForms over JS here is one of declarative code vs. code-\non-demand (visibility).\n\nI basically just had my aha moment for URI templates in XHTML, as it\nmoves UI design choices (like forms language) to another layer.\nInteresting!\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
