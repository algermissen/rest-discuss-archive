It is to me.\n&gt; My clearest idea is that a POST &#39;updates&#39; an existant resource\n&gt; a PUT &#39;creates&#39; a new one.\n\nNo, other way round.\n\nrfc2616 says this about POST:\n\n   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the\n   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.\n\nA sub-ordinate resource meaning that if you POST to:\n\n  /someresource\n\nyou might create:\n\n  /someresource/1\n\nor:\n\n  /someresource/2\n\nThe response to the POST can contain a pointer to the new resource. In\nthis case the return value should be 201 (Created).\n\n\nrfc2616 says this about PUT:\n\n   The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\n   supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already\n   existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a\n   modified version of the one residing on the origin server. \n\nAnd here&#39;s the important part when comparing with POST:\n\n   If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that\n   URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting\n   user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that\n   URI.\n\nSo either can create a resource. But POST is more explicit.\n\n\n&gt; Any clarification please? Simple English , not RTFM :-)\n\nThere is no REST manual   /8-&gt;\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
