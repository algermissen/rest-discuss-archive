The entity format is specified by the media type\n&gt;given in the Content- Type header field. Depending upon the format\n&gt;and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most\n&gt;appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this\n&gt;specification does not define any standard for such automatic\n&gt;selection.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Are there any specifications or applications that do define such\n&gt;behaviour? I have an application that needs to return a list of\n&gt;redirection URIs. If there is an existing practice for doing this,\n&gt;I&#39;ll follow that rather than define something new.\n&gt;\n&gt;For the curious, an httpsy redirectory needs to be able to return\n&gt;at least two redirection URLs: one for outside the NAT clients and\n&gt;one for inside the NAT clients.
