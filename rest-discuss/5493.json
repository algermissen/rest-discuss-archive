My impression is that  \n&gt; HTTP DELETE (at least in a REST world) should only operate on a  \n&gt; single resource.   Is that an accurate interpretation?\n\nDistinguishing between http://example.com/parts/00345 and\nhttp://example.com/parts?part-id=00345 as a named object and a named\nquery has some interesting consequences. I think the question of DELETE\nis one of them. If we successfully DELETE the former resource we can\nexpect that further requests to the resource will return 404 or 410,\nhowever it is never possible to delete a query. Only the records matched\ncan be deleted. We would expect it to continue returning 200 with an\nempty result set, or perhaps 204. A query might also come back with a\ndifferent representation to the representation of the actual resource.\nIf the implicit assumption of every query is that it may match multiple\nrecords, it may then require a containing structure for those records to\nbe encoded into its response.\n\nIt seems that queries should not be used as object identifiers, because\nthe two are genuinely different concepts. Queries are still good for\nGETs, especially those that originate from form entry. REST operations\nmay still apply to queries in the same sense as their SQL parallels\napply to record subsets, however using a query part may signal to\nimplementors that a query is in use. Queries would obviously behave\ndifferently to explicit object identifier URIs.\n\nOverall, I think I like this approach.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
