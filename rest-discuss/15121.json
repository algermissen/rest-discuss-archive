I&#39;d be more inclined if people equated s=\r\npecifics like &quot;Atom/Atompub&quot; or &quot;OData&quot; with &quot;easy DATA services creation&quot;,=\r\n personally.     \n\nEnterprises should keep building SOAP web services if th=\r\ney are happy with RPC or messaging systems, and can force their vendors to =\r\nmake it &quot;easier&quot;.\n\n- The actual *idea* for REST is not &quot;easy services creat=\r\nion&quot; -- it is &quot;large-scale information sharing & manipulation&quot;.   It is for=\r\n interoperability at very-large scale, a &quot;system of systems&quot; architecture: =\r\nhttp://www.infoed.com/Open/PAPERS/systems.htm\n\nAs such, it is not necessari=\r\nly &quot;easy&quot; to apply to all situations, it requires knowledge & experience (l=\r\nike most things).\n\n- Explaining REST as an architectural style works for so=\r\nme, but more likely there&#39;s also a need to explain REST in the context of S=\r\nOA&#39;s verbiage (e.g. governance, interoperability, loose coupling, contracts=\r\n).\n \n- Probably there will need to be more mainstream books and tooling for=\r\n the lay-developer, that gets into *how* the development experience is diff=\r\nerent.   Unfortunately, that&#39;s a moving target.\n\nSome comments:\n\nThe genera=\r\nl trend among the SOA crowd has been to equate REST with &quot;Plain XML over HT=\r\nTP&quot;, and to this day, it remains the popular understanding in most enterpri=\r\nses.    Most don&#39;t really understand the key features (URIs and hyperlinks)=\r\n, though I have had some exposure that some are beginning to explore deeper=\r\n once they dig into Atom & Atompub.\n\nThe problem with using REST as &quot;easy s=\r\nervices creation&quot;, is that you may be committing greater sins to your maint=\r\nainability than using WSDL & SOAP if you don&#39;t use HTTP & URIs properly (e.=\r\ng. performing state changes with GET, using a single URI as an &quot;endpoint&quot;, =\r\nincluding application-specific methods in the XML body, etc. )    At least =\r\nwith SOAP & WSDL there is tooling & infrastructure for governing the little=\r\n interoperability you do get with it.    With REST, the tooling & written l=\r\niterature is still very young, and the vast majority of developers are neve=\r\nr going to read Roy&#39;s thesis.\n\nPart of the problem is that the Web Architec=\r\nture and REST are very different ways to think about distributed systems de=\r\nsign, whereas SOAP-style SOA services are an evolutionary descendent of (de=\r\npending who you talk to) distributed objects ala CORBA/COM, or message queu=\r\nes ala MQ or TIBCO, which have a much longer history in some people&#39;s minds=\r\n.\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: William Martinez =\r\nPomares &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wed=\r\n, March 31, 2010 6:25:48 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] What do you think about=\r\n REST being a synonym of Service creation technique?\n\n  \nHello all.\nI got t=\r\nhe newsletter from InfoQ this week, and suddenly I noticed something that h=\r\nas been there since long, but till now I didn&#39;t realize it.\n\nIn the SOA cha=\r\nnnel articles and news, there were only one of each.
