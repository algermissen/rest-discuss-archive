Adding stuff to HTML doesn&#39;t seem like the right thing to do\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why an authentication response couldn&#39;t have an\n&gt; entity associated with it, either in the response body or referenced\n&gt; via some content-location like header.\nFundamentally, the user-agent (browser, spider, utility, etc.) is\nresponsible for placing the correct bits in the authentication header(s).\nDisplaying the entity associated with an authentication challenge is nice,\nbut without indicating that user input is meant as protocol-level\nauthentication, then the user-agent will not be able to manage that. That is\nwhy adding stuff to HTML is necessary.\n\nThe alternative approach is that the server controls the lifetime of\nauthentication information - essentially cookie based.\nAdding things to the protocol to support control over authentication\nlifetime might be an approach that gives application authors control, but\nprovides visibility to user-agents (and intermediaries). The kinds of things\nI&#39;m thinking about are responses indicating &#39;forget auth for this realm&#39; and\n&#39;remember this auth-token for this realm&#39;. Cookies are a generalized form of\nthis, but you lose the visibility that there is security information in\nthere.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
