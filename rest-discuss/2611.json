To take \none of your examples, files systems,\n\n  $ touch foo\n  $ rm foo\n  $ rm foo\n  rm: cannot remove `foo&#39;: No such file or directory\n  $\n\nThere&#39;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with this behaviour.\n\nrm is idempotent, but, nb., from the point of view of the effect on the \nfilesystem, *not* from the point of view of the response displayed to \nthe invoker,\n\n* WRT the filesystem, the effect of n+1 rm&#39;s is the same as the effect\n  of n.\n\n* WRT the response displayed to the invoker, the effect of the first rm\n  is different from the second and subsequent rm&#39;s.\n\nThe gist of my earlier postings is that I believe that RFC 2616 \nequivocates between a view of idempotence, similar to the one above, \ndefined soley in terms of effects on servers/resources, and one that \nappeals to sameness of results as seen by the client. It&#39;s this \nequivocation which I think is wrong, not idempotent DELETEs.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
