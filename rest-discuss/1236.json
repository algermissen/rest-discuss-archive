One is cookies, the other is URL munging.\nIn the latter, all interactions can be done via HTTP GET, and there is\nlittle or no assumptions made about the capabilities of the client.  Some\nwould - based on this description alone - declare such a solution RESTful.\nThe reality is that such an approach uses URL to identify not just\nresources, but also comingles in the concept of context.\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
