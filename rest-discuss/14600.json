The\n&gt;&gt; client asks for data in JSON-format from the server using a RESTful URL\n&gt;&gt; structure, and present it in the UI. All is well.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;RESTful URL structure&quot;?\n\nA URL structure that represents resources that can return state and \nperform actions on them.\n\n&gt;&gt; In my situation, where the client just gets\n&gt;&gt; JSON-data, it seems to me that I have to extend my usage of JSON so that\n&gt;&gt; I can get both the data to view, and a list of what actions the client\n&gt;&gt; is allowed to perform, and then enable/disable UI elements accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; You should include Authentication information with the request and\n&gt; determine on that basis what JSON to return. The JSON should drive the\n&gt; UI with regard to the available actions (==next possible transitions in\n&gt; the application by the user through your UI).\n\nThat was the idea. I was just curious how others have formatted their \nJSON (if anyone has done it at all) to include such action info.\n\n&gt;&gt; Something like this would be sent from the server:\n&gt;&gt; {&quot;commands&quot;:[&quot;cmd1&quot;,&quot;cmd2],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}}\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, maybe - if you think of &#39;cmd&#39; in terms of &#39;next transition&#39;. If\n&gt; you UI reacts on the cmds received that would be good.\n\nThat&#39;s the idea. We could also replace &quot;cmd1&quot; with URL&#39;s instead, so \nthat the client doesn&#39;t have to generate URL&#39;s, but then we need more \ninfo to be sent, similar to &lt;a&gt;&#39;s (rel+href attributes).\n\n&gt;&gt; With the above I can both get the data I need to show, and know what the\n&gt;&gt; user is allowed to do with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that is ok, if you context prevents simpler solutions (e.g. use\n&gt; HTML+browser in the first place).\n\nYeah, that is not an option. We need the more powerful UI features of \nSwing, and also want to be able to connect to several servers at once in \nthe UI.\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
