What data are you storing in them and why\n&gt;&gt;&gt; does that data not deserve to be a named first class resource?\n&gt;&gt; When I have a *user* interface where some resources need authenticated\n&gt;&gt; access, then I need some kind of session, don&#39;t I?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not necessarily.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to be purely RESTful, you&#39;d strive to use HTTP authentication for\n&gt; such things, but practically that&#39;s tough.  Often, frameworks/tools use a\n&gt; cookie to represent a transient auth token.\n&gt; \n&gt; But even the latter is slightly different from having a stateful session.\n&gt; The general use-case of a session is the server-side software keeping an\n&gt; object &quot;around&quot; in the user&#39;s session such that some subsequent request&#39;s\n&gt; handling can get at that object without needing to &quot;carry&quot; it through the\n&gt; intervening pages/requests.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is *that* session state that REST eschews.\n\nI agree entirely. Although I&#39;d also prefer authentication mechanisms \nbased on WWW-Authenticate (and related headers), sometimes, it&#39;s \npractically impossible, hence the use of a cookie to maintain an \nauthenticated session (using a cookie being by far better than using a \nsession id in a URI parameter).\n\nI think this doesn&#39;t contradict the stateless interactions principle of \nREST, as long as the session is only used for authentication purposes. \nIn my opinion, authentication should be considered as orthogonal to the \nfunction of the application.\nIn fact, I think most secure authentication mechanisms maintain some \nform of state during a set of interactions with the client. If that&#39;s of \ninterest, I tried to make a list of HTTP authentication mechanisms a \ncouple of days ago, looking at this with Restlet in mind (*).\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBruno.\n\n\n(*) \nhttp://blog.distributedmatter.net/post/2008/06/09/HTTP-authentication-mechanisms-and-how-they-could-work-in-Restlet\n\n\n"}}
