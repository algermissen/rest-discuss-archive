Quick adoption that is.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a bit =\r\nof a stretch to say pure SOA has nothing to do with OO; \nDidn&#39;t mean really=\r\n that. I actually mean what you said: SOA concepts  were created somewhere =\r\nelse. Governance and Contracts are pure business ones, although OO may have=\r\n used the contract metaphor in some languages, the concept is not from ther=\r\ne, as OO didn&#39;t have it originally. It became a core concept in WSA.\nI mean=\r\nt to say SOA is different from Distributed OO. May share some concepts, but=\r\n try to get them in a different way. \nYou know, that is actually another di=\r\nscussion in the SOA forums. How much a Service reassembles an Object, if th=\r\nere is any difference in properties, etc. That is off-topic in this forum, =\r\nI guess, but my take is SOA and OO share quality properties, but they diffe=\r\nr in the core metaphor.\n\nNice discussion!\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com, Stuart Charlton &lt;stuartcharlton@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Com=\r\nments inline\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent from my iPad\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2010-04-06, at 6:21 AM, &quot;Willia=\r\nm Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Making SOAP Services (Re=\r\nad RPC) is the easiest thing to do. Making them work together is another is=\r\nsue. Making real Web Services (using documents and messaging) is a pain in =\r\nyour little finger since there is not top down approach. Your system may be=\r\n a fit for WSA, or a fit for SOA (slightly different benefits and requireme=\r\nnts), but the implementation side is failing terribly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to belie=\r\nve this is because &quot;real services&quot; are a concept created by SOA consultants=\r\n (I was one of them, sorry).... it is hard for vendors to apply to their pr=\r\noducts.   \n&gt; \n&gt; That and my sense is that the adoption of WS technology pea=\r\nked in the WSDL 1.1 days, doing &quot;just enough&quot; for most cases that the truly=\r\n advanced cases with WS-AT or WS-RM only have relatively small investments =\r\nbehind them.   There needs to be $$$ to drive vendors to improve these stac=\r\nks, and it&#39;s clearly not there to the extent they had hoped.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. &quot;SOA=\r\n&#39;s verbiage&quot; you mention is not actually from SOA, but sadly those concepts=\r\n were made popular by SOA and from there people get confused. Governance an=\r\nd contracts came from the business world, the first one to increase the int=\r\nerest of business people to invest on the technology (yep, a worm to catch =\r\nthe fish) and the second one came from WSA. Interoperability and loose coup=\r\nling came from OO world, and thus created the illusion that SOA was a OO sy=\r\nstem in disguise. Actually, many SOA implementations out there are Distribu=\r\nted OO in disguise. A pity, since Pure SOA has nothing to do with it. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n It&#39;s a bit of a stretch to say pure SOA has nothing to do with OO; design =\r\nby contract was a big innovation in a couple OO languages, as were many of =\r\nthe tenants such as separation of interface from implementation, compositio=\r\nn,  etc.  SOA eschews object state and identity, which is ironic, because t=\r\nhat&#39;s exactly what REST embraces, if you look at it through an object-orien=\r\nted lens. \n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, again speaking from my former life as a SOA cons=\r\nultant with BEA, things like governance and contracts weren&#39;t just sell job=\r\ns, they were an attempt to separate and save the valuable ideas in SOA from=\r\n the atrocities of the WSA...\n&gt; \n&gt; My broader point is that REST as an arch=\r\nitectural style to enable SOA has been an idea I have heard and supported d=\r\nating back to 2003 or so... the problem is that the REST community has limi=\r\nted interest in SOA, and the SOA community thinks in different terms from a=\r\nrchitectural constraints and styles.   So if there is going to be bridge bu=\r\nilding, there has to be some terminology agreement, but I haven&#39;t really se=\r\nen much effort there for several years.   After the W3C workshop on the &quot;We=\r\nb of Services&quot;, agreement was declared, but the reality was that most advoc=\r\nates moved on from bridge-building and stayed in their own world.   \n&gt; \n&gt; 6=\r\n. Same, I agree about the descendants part. Still, the SOA idea is differen=\r\nt from Implementation. I&#39;ll be naive enough to think the SOA and Services i=\r\ndea were born pure, and when implementation started, tool vendors took what=\r\n they have at that time (SOAP as the next Corba/Dcom generation, and Messag=\r\ne queues) and did some rebranding to get to sell SOA tools! So, I still thi=\r\nnk we can save the pure ideals of SOA (but not with REST, which is a differ=\r\nent kind of beast).\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, question, what should we do about it?\n&gt; \n&gt; We=\r\nll, it&#39;s not clear what can be done.  Enterprises clearly don&#39;t have money =\r\nto replace yet another generation of middleware, so there&#39;s little incentiv=\r\ne for investment to learn or adopt a different approach (by customers or ve=\r\nndors).  Most of the REST improvements and understandings are happening on =\r\nthe Web and in consulting engagements, not by traditional vendors and their=\r\n patrons.  That may change, but it will require some economic shifts and/or=\r\n killer product breakthroughs.   Cloud computing, for example, seems to be =\r\nvery REST-infected, for better or worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stu\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n     __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
