GET is a safe method, meaning the server can&#39;t swear in\n&gt; court later that the client actually wanted to renew their session, but\n&gt; the server is free to revoke the session at any time if it wants to\n&gt; anyway. It is just noticing that the session is still in use and making\n&gt; an internal decision to keep it active.\n\nI am dealing with sessions in this case, but I&#39;m making them RESTful\nby treating them as resources, and that brings up the interesting\npoint of temporary resources. What happens when you GET a temporary\nresource that&#39;s expired, but you can get back through invocation? A\n410 means its gone, 404 means it&#39;s not found, 304 not modified, and so\nforth; there seems to be nothing that says &quot;yes, it&#39;s still there, but\nyou need to ask pretty to get it back&quot;.\n\nCurrently I&#39;m just going to let the sessions exsist until asked to be\nremoved, and have the timeout information inside the XML of the GET\noperation and let applications decide if they&#39;re &quot;allowed&quot; to use the\ninfo within, as I can&#39;t seem to find a RESTful mechanism to use.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, you should perhaps be thinking about what this\n&gt; session is for. REST tends to discourage sessions in general. Without\n&gt; looking at your specific use case I wouldn&#39;t like to comment too\n&gt; harshly, but a session can often be avoided.\n\nThese session objects can be created by anyone, from browsers to\napplications to services, and is a temporary property store with\ntimestamps. They are anonymous, and there is no dependancy on\napplication logic, so it&#39;s up to the apps to use them properly, for\nexample a browser needs to get a session, use it with cookies, and\ncheck the timeout from time to time, or a cron service uses the\nsession for various cleaning jobs, etc.\n\nNever mind that they are sessions. think of them as temporary\nresources that after a time become unavailable (but not gone), and you\ncan ask to get them back.\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchymist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
