The\n&gt; client is coded to repeatedly do this until the goal is rea=\r\nched or the\n&gt; client determines the goal will never be reached.\n\nYes. And s=\r\ntill, there is the general knowledge that it makes sense to  \ncode this &#39;lo=\r\noking for that goal&#39; in the first place. This is the  \nassumption I am talk=\r\ning about. This is the contract (for example  \nestablished by RFC 5023 for =\r\nAtomPub servers).\n\nBut would one make that contract very visible in a media=\r\n type spec  \neveryone would shout out loud: &quot;Nah, you must not do that beca=\r\nuse you  \nought to discover that information at runtime&quot;).\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Dec 21, 2009 at 06:46, Jan Alge=\r\nrmissen &lt;algermissen1971@... \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Dec 21, 2009, at 12:3=\r\n4 PM, Jorn Wildt wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the enterprise people want to develop cl=\r\nients and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; services in parallel, shich rules out client design by inspe=\r\ncting  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; runtime behavior of a service.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember thi=\r\ns being mentioned by you earlier on.
