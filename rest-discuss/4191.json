I&#39;ve\n&gt; never actually grokked the purpose of RDF before.\n&gt; Thank you.\n\nHey, great.  I love doing that.\n\n&gt; So my current understanding is that\n&gt; DTD/Schema/RelaxNG are ways to describe what XML\n&gt; elements an application produces/consumes, RDF is\n&gt; a way to describe the meaning of those elements,\n&gt; and namespaces are a way to identify them.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, you want to use RDF to replace\n&gt; DTD/Schema/RelaxNG and I&#39;m not seeing how that\n&gt; works.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, how can we use RDF to say that we\n&gt; require/produce a name, an age, and a list of\n&gt; phone numbers?\n\nYou&#39;d use RDF Schema and/or OWL, or perhaps even stuff further up (e.g.\nrules language).  These are RDF vocabularies that define constraints on\nresources and their relationships, rather than doing it on syntax.\n\nFor example, see;\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-guide-20040210/#simpleCardinality\n\n&gt; Perhaps RDF-forms is an answer.  But it seems\n&gt; less expressive than DTDs/RelaxNG/Schema.\n\nI don&#39;t think RDF Forms plays much of a role there.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
