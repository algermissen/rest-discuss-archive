Certainly there are lot=\r\ns of existing\n(even open source) tools for monitoring servers (web, data, f=\r\nile,\netc.) that you  can use. If the &quot;monitoring&quot; is more about the actual\n=\r\nuse of your published end-points (who is online, what&#39;s you\ntransaction thr=\r\noughput, queue lengths, wait-times, etc.)  then you can\nget some of that da=\r\nta from the server logs (see above). But you will\nprobably need to add some=\r\n details to your HTTP/REST endpoint code that\nupdates stand-alone custom st=\r\nats. Not a big deal, really. In our\nenvironment (Windows/IIS) we have the a=\r\nbility to create performance\ncounters that do just that.\n\nHope this helps.\n=\r\n\nMCA\nOn Jan 27, 2008 4:33 PM, Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n  Hi again:\n&gt;\n&gt; Friday I had a big discussion with my team, and I *almost* =\r\nconvince my team\n&gt; leader of the merits of a &quot;REST-only&quot; solution - 3) belo=\r\nw.
