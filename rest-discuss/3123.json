For example, Content-alternatives could \ninclude &#39;application/rss+xml&#39; to indicate\n&gt; the RSS feed. It could also return &#39;application/wsil+xml&#39;[1] \nor &#39;application/rsd+xml&#39;[2]\n&gt; to describe available web services (modulo some politically correct \ndefinition of &#39;web service&#39;).\n&gt; This would allow multiple competing formats for web service and \nmeta-data identification\n&gt; to be developed and deployed.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-\nwsilspec.html\n&gt; [2] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\n\nWhat you propose is actually very close to what we are doing only \nremoved one step.  We didn&#39;t want to overload the semantics of the \nservice URL because of the confusion that could happen when the \ncontent type of the service and the content type of the meta data are \nthe same.\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
