It seems to me that, some times, this term gets stretched\n&gt; wildly to imply a broader concept or philosophy. It is nothing more\n&gt; than an indirection to communicate possible state transitions, and\n&gt; requires clients to *fully* understand the syntax and semantics of\n&gt; each transition. Is that a big deal? May be, or may be not. It just\n&gt; depends on the application.\nI did. Maybe you forgot to write the &quot;for any transition that the client \nwants to follow&quot; part?\n\nNevertheless, I think it&#39;s important to stress the point I mentioned \nwhen talking about HATEOAS, because, imho, it&#39;s one of the big \nadvantages of using a Restfull style.\n\n\nSubbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt; Please read it again.

It just\n&gt;&gt;&gt; depends on the application.\n&gt;&gt; That is not completely accurate, a client can understand *only* a \n&gt;&gt; sub-set of those transitions. That&#39;s what make HATEOAS so effective \n&gt;&gt; in decoupling clients, your server can extend the services it \n&gt;&gt; provides at any point without breaking the existing clients, that \n&gt;&gt; will continue to work as they were, without  the new functionalities \n&gt;&gt; of course. But new clients can be built that use those new \n&gt;&gt; capabilities and they can coexist with the older clients without a \n&gt;&gt; problem. Actually, it&#39;s a little bit like OSGi, but in a different \n&gt;&gt; context, of course...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
