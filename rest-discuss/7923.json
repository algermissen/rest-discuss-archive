(presume you\ncan make them all unique, if you can&#39;t then add in a counter).\nThe idea is that there is nothing to store. If a PUT is attempted at\na URI with a time stamp that is too old then just reject it. No need to\nstore anything since the time stamp is in the URI.\n\nDon&#39;t trust your clients? Add a hash that verifies the time stamp+counter:\n\n  http://example.org/temporary/{timestamp}+{counter}+{hash}/\n\nOnce a PUT is successful you can redirect to the right &#39;final&#39; URI.\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
