I read the entire thread. I get it now about media-type.. \n=\r\n&gt; at least for the most part. I am still not sure if I should create a \n&gt; s=\r\ningle media-type for our particular application or not.. or how you \n&gt; dete=\r\nrmine if you should or not. Partly, the confusion lies with the \n&gt; number o=\r\nf posts I&#39;ve seen about &quot;you should register your media-types \n&gt; with IANA =\r\nto help build it up&quot;. \n\nThe idea isn&#39;t to &quot;build up&quot; the IANA registry. The=\r\n idea is that there is always a well understood way to know what a message =\r\nmeans and where to find the associated spec. The IANA isn&#39;t a &quot;service API&quot;=\r\n either; user agents don&#39;t consult it in an automated way as they run. It i=\r\ns better to think of it more as a dictionary for developers who code the su=\r\npport for the formats into their programs.\n\nAnother way to contrast it is t=\r\nhat SOAP+UDDI is about encouraging and supporting the proliferation of form=\r\nats while REST and the IANA registry is about managing it or even restricti=\r\nng it. The more formats there are, the harder it is for general interoperab=\r\nility.\n\nKeep in mind that REST is designed for the scale of the web -- if y=\r\nou are not planning to operate at that scale (or even a reasonable fraction=\r\n of that scale) then some of the principles will seem a bit strange.\n\nThink=\r\n of it this way: imagine that the services you are writing need to work wit=\r\nh many millions of individual machines that you don&#39;t have access to becaus=\r\ne they are located in many different organizations or even in people&#39;s home=\r\ns. Are you going to:\n(a) cook up your own format and hope that somehow soft=\r\nware that supports that format gets onto all of the target machines; or\n(b)=\r\n try and use a format that software on those machines already understand?\n\n=\r\nProbably (b). If there is no suitable format for the use case, then you may=\r\n have to create a new format. But you&#39;d likely want to get input and agreem=\r\nent from potential implementors and experts in the domain you are targeting=\r\n so that the format gets adopted and onto the target machines. You also wan=\r\nt to make sure that the spec can easily be found and when machines communic=\r\nate using the format, that it can be easily identified with a media type. T=\r\nhat&#39;s why you standardize your format and register a media type for it.\n\nNo=\r\nw if you&#39;re saying: &quot;Hold on! Millions of machines? Different organizations=\r\n? I just need to be able to talk to the server that Bob, who sits 2 cubes o=\r\nver, is building&quot; then maybe REST isn&#39;t what you need. That doesn&#39;t mean yo=\r\nu can&#39;t use many if not most of its principles and leave others out. Just b=\r\ne careful about calling it REST (well at least on this list ;-).\n\nAndrew\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
