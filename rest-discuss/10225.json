Can&#39;t tell anything else.\n\nGoogle doesn&#39;t come along and say &quot;hmmm, that part of the hierarchy\nlooks like an integer - let&#39;s go increment it!&quot;.\n\nSure, we humans do - but the google spider doesn&#39;t (so far as I know).\n\nIndeed, even specialised spiders that target blogs don&#39;t exhibit this behaviour.\n\nTherefore, I regard any given URI string as being practically opaque\nfrom the perspective of a robot.\n\nThis is *not* to say that I don&#39;t like &#39;pretty&#39;, &#39;hackable&#39; or\nhuman-readable URIs. I sure do. Well-formedness is a very attractive\ntrait in server-side URI generation.\n\nI simply say that within the existing web specifications we cannot a\nproduce generally interpretive robot, only one that treats the URIs of\ntoday as opaque and follows links of these opaque URIs.\n\nDoes this mean that I am against the client discovering the server URI\ngeneration &#39;recipe&#39;? No.\n\nI am not against formulating a publication mechanism for URI recipes,\nif the server wants to publish them. I&#39;m simply saying that there\nisn&#39;t a specified way of doing this currently.\n\nIt is an outstanding task.\n\nThis, I assume, is why Joe Gregorio has published his draft proposal\nand why the WHATWG is considering the issue.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
