It&#39;s kind\n&gt; of the point right? You have a resource or some collection of\n&gt; resources that you want updated. The most flexible way of supporting\n&gt; update would be to support multiple media types on input.\n\nI think there is a difference between offering multiple  \nrepresentations of a resource via GET and updating the same resource  \nvia a POST/PUT. With POST/PUT, you are creating/changing the resource  \nitself, not just creating/changing a &quot;representation&quot; of the resource.  \nGiven this, there is reason to offer a symmetry between GET and POST/ \nPUT. That is, if a GET is capable of returning application/json,  \napplication/xml and text/html, it does not imply that a POST or PUT  \nshould support processing creation/update of the resource with the  \npayload expressed via the same media types. You may instead decide to  \nsupport application/x-www-form-urlencoded if the clientele is browsers.\n\nThe approach you state below may be specific to your clientele, but I  \ndon&#39;t think that is the general pattern.\n\nSubbu\n\n&gt; In the systems I&#39;ve worked with (primarily wikis[1]), we&#39;ll accept\n&gt; wikitext, HTML, JSON packages that include wikitext or HTML along with\n&gt; some metadata. We&#39;ve explored Atom and various (other) XML packagings\n&gt; too, but have not solidified those as we don&#39;t yet have the use case.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the server side we store the incoming representation (after some\n&gt; translation) to our canonical storage representation, wikitext, and\n&gt; then make it available in a variety of outgoing representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; On input we look at the Content-Type header. If we don&#39;t support a\n&gt; particular type, we send a 415. Ideally we&#39;d respond with the types we\n&gt; do support but we didn&#39;t get around to that.\n&gt;\n&gt; For output we look at the accept header. We don&#39;t do full content-\n&gt; negotiation with the header: we hope the client to send a single type\n&gt; that they accept, not multiples from which we&#39;ll pick the one we like\n&gt; best. We try with that latter bit but it never comes out as happy as\n&gt; we&#39;d like, so in our own client code we always just accept one thing\n&gt; and one thing only.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our thinking in all this is that for our style of API--which is purely\n&gt; a data mover, not something we expect to use as a human UI (although\n&gt; it works just great that way if you are happy not having a bunch of UI\n&gt; furniture)--we want the URIs for the resources to really be the place\n&gt; where things happen: for any entity its URL is the place where you GET\n&gt; it, you PUT it and you DELETE it, for any collection its URL is the\n&gt; place where you GET it and you POST to it. We don&#39;t bother providing\n&gt; forms output or support for CGI form content-types input. If we did\n&gt; want to have a resource which was the editor for other resources, then\n&gt; we might, but at this point we expect the client side to make its own\n&gt; editor.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] Socialtext REST API docs: https://www.socialtext.net/st-rest-docs/index.cgi\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\n&gt; or I&#39;ll remove your commit bit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
