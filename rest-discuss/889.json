The two most widely used\n&gt; &quot;distributed&quot; filesystems (SMB / CIFS and NFS+autofs) use an exactly analogous\n&gt; machine + path style of naming.\n\nYou are constantly moving the goal posts. You talk about the design\ndecisions in Plan9 or ReiserFS and then when I point out that the Web\nisn&#39;t quite like them you point out that the Web has some features in\ncommon with SMB/CIFS. We&#39;ll go in circles forever that way.\n\nYes, if you take the union of all features of all file systems and pick\nand choose then you may get something that looks like the Web. But if\nyou want to claim that the Web should learn from the design decisions\nmade in file systems then you have to choose one or two logically\nsimilar file systems and demonstrate that the problem domain is similar.\n\nI&#39;ve not noticed that SMB/CIFS use semantically meaningful names much\nother than lpt1: so I don&#39;t see how they are relevant to your argument.\nIn fact, the Windows operating system encourages application designers\nto dereference names through the registry and ignore the actual file\nnames. So we dereference through markup. They dereference through a\nbinary database that constantly gets corrupted. Both use opaque\nidentifiers.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
