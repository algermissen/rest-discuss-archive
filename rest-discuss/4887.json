The syntax is much better IMHO than previous WSDL versions, as\nused in ATOM&#39;s RESTful (I think) API:\n\nhttp://atomenabled.org/developers/api/AtomAPI.wsdl\n\nBack to the Artist WSDL, what disappoints me was that it doesn&#39;t separate\nthe interface(s) from the service... which is something that I want. I\nprefer examples than reading the bulk of WSDL 2.0 Draft... So that example\ncombined with some reading into WSDL 2.0 specs maybe will shed some light\nto me.\n\nIf all is well than I hope it&#39;s not necessary to invent yet another\nproprietary schema.\n\nAbout REST, it seems than now WSDL 2.0 kind of &quot;supports&quot; REST services.\nWith WS-Transfer it seems REST services are completely WSDL-able. But I\nhaven&#39;t delved deep into this. If it&#39;s true, then you folks already got\nyour personalized REST Description Language without much effort, the WSDL\nguys at Microsoft et al did the rough jobs for you. :-) I hope you\nappreciate their efforts.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
