As long as the bits you want\nare sent across the network when you do an HTTP GET then the information\nis &quot;on the web&quot; and an appropriate fragment identifier *could be worked\nout* either globally or for a particular application. That means that it\nis no longer a protocol issue, it is an application software issue. A\nWeb protocol has a responsibility to turn an address into bits and the\nrest is up to the client.\n\n&gt; If we assume that&#39;s the case (PDF is another format that can be\n&gt; substituted for the purposes of this discussion if it&#39;s not), one can put\n&gt; a slide on the Web by making its parent slideshow available at a URI. I&#39;d\n&gt; say that a reasonable interpretation of &quot;on the Web&quot; is &quot;available on the\n&gt; Web&quot;; certainly more accurate than &quot;addressable on the Web.&quot;\n\nLet&#39;s presume that&#39;s true. What if I give you a URI to Java applet that\nimplements the telnet or SSH protocols? Can I now declare that my\n/etc/passwd is &quot;on the web&quot; because all you need to do is send the right\ncommands (machine name, username, password, cat /etc/passwd) to the Java\napplet? In my opinion, that definition is too vague to be useful. Using\nURI-addressability as the definition is crisp and helpful. If there\nexists a URI that addresses a resource that returns a representation\nthat contains the bits then those bits are on the Web. Otherwise, not.\n\n&gt; Addressability is a very important aspect of the Web, but let&#39;s not\n&gt; confuse it with availability. Remember that resources are abstract, while\n&gt; representations are concrete; when you use a URI reference, you&#39;re\n&gt; identifying something concrete in the representation, not in the resource.\n\nI agree but don&#39;t understand the relevance.\n\n&gt; &gt; No. At some point you are no longer interested in sending messages to\n&gt; &gt; objects and I would say that that&#39;s the point you stop decomposing. It\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a judgement call. If you need to address something in a network\n&gt; &gt; transaction then the thing needs a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Determining your level of interest in something isn&#39;t a judgement call?\n\nMy point is that there is a simple rule of thumb for determining whether\nyou&#39;ve got the granularity right or not. If you need to send a message\nto something then that thing should have an address. This issue is not\none that is particularly confusing in (e.g.) object oriented programming\nand it shouldn&#39;t be in networking either.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Could you describe how to do this in any web service environments you\n&gt; &gt; are familiar with? Remember that an important requirement is that new\n&gt; &gt; resources will be created all of the time with no human interaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it was noted before that this information is available in most\n&gt; environments; it&#39;s more a question of whether people will use it, and\n&gt; whether they&#39;ll be encouraged to use it. I&#39;m somewhat hopeful that\n&gt; progress can be made here.\n\nI may have missed this note. \n\nHere&#39;s what I remember: A few weeks ago Sam Ruby pointed me to a few\nAxis documents that I couldn&#39;t interpret. \n\nYesterday, Mike Dierken said: &quot;my guess is that it is pretty easy to\nroute HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a URI pattern&quot; and &quot;If you\ndid route this way - via common HTTP URI based handling - then the SOAP\nreceiver probably won&#39;t be coded to know the HTTP URI - the info would\nhave to be replicated within the SOAP body.&quot;\n\nWhich in my mind defeats the whole purpose. The SOAP elements are still\nthe canonical address for the referenced object, not the URI. The URI is\nmore or less ignored.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
