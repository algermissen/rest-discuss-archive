These are defined within the scope of\n&gt; particular specifications. There is always pressure to extend these\n&gt; specifications in a flexible way. HTTP header names are generally\n&gt; extended arbitrarily by those doing experiments. The same can also be\n&gt; true of HTML elements and extension mechanisms have been proposed for\n&gt; both. If we look generically at the very wide space of all such\n&gt; metadata attribute names, we find something in which the dictionary\n&gt; would be so large that ad hoc arbitrary extension would be just as\n&gt; chaotic as central registration would be stifling.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Metadata.html\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s that last bit there that&#39;s important.  A central registry may\n&gt; indeed stifle innovation; however, ad-hoc extension defeats the goal of\n&gt; generic interoperability.  You can&#39;t expect method=FOO to interoperate\n&gt; any better than if you use foo:// as your URI scheme or &#39;foo&#39; as an\n&gt; identifier, unless they&#39;re registered, and no distributed registry\n&gt; mechanism has yet been defined for anything with any bearing on self-\n&gt; descriptiveness.\n&gt;\n&gt; More from Tim:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; There is an open question as to what the process should be for\n&gt; formulating new URI schemes, but it is clear that to allow unfettered\n&gt; proliferation would be a serious mistake. In almost all other areas,\n&gt; proliferation of new designs is welcomed and the Web can be used as a\n&gt; distributed registry of them, but not for the case of URI schemes.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Clearly, there&#39;s some friction between Tim&#39;s view and Roy&#39;s view.  The\n&gt; question is whether it&#39;s appropriate to use the Web as a distributed\n&gt; registry for media type identifiers.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve offered any\n&gt; opinion on that (beyond Google not being a registry); I&#39;ve only pointed\n&gt; out that there is no definition in any of the specs which supports\n&gt; anything other than the IANA registry for media type identifiers,\n&gt; therefore only IANA-registered identifiers (which point to a spec, not\n&gt; a 404) may be considered self-descriptive on the Web today.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, here&#39;s the problem with allowing ad-hoc extensibility:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; The introduction of any other method apart from GET which has no\n&gt; side-effects and is simply a function of the URI is also incorrect,\n&gt; because the results of such an operation effectively form a separate\n&gt; address space, which violates the universality.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html\n&gt;\n&gt; A distributed registry for HTTP methods would allow FOO to have the\n&gt; same semantics as GET, just as a distributed registry for identifiers\n&gt; would allow application/foo+xml to identify the same processing model\n&gt; as application/xhtml+xml -- which defeats the goal of generic\n&gt; interoperability by splitting the identifier namespace.  While media\n&gt; types may have multiple identifiers, each processing model has a\n&gt; one-to-one mapping to an identifier in the IANA standards tree, which I\n&gt; see as the benefit of a central registry.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For backwards compatibility, the absence of a URI would indicate an\n&gt; &gt; implicit link to the IANA, i.e. thus application/sparql-query would\n&gt; &gt; implicitly link to\n&gt; &gt; http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/#sparql-query\n&gt; &gt; (although the IANA website would probably need a tweak to support\n&gt; &gt; this cleanly and redirect to the actual doc; so\n&gt; &gt; http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/sparql-query\n&gt; &gt; could be used)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This thought has also occurred to Tim:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; In HTTP, the format of data is defined by a &quot;MIME type&quot;. This formally\n&gt; refers to a central registry kept by IANA. However, architecturally\n&gt; this is an unnecessary central point of control, and there is no reason\n&gt; why the Web itself should not be used as a repository for new types.\n&gt; Indeed, a transition plan, in which unqualified MIME types are taken as\n&gt; relative URIs within a standard reference URI in an online MIME\n&gt; registry, would allow migration of MIME types to become first class\n&gt; objects.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, sure, nobody is saying the IANA registry is the best solution --\n&gt; just that it&#39;s the only *existing* solution (no &quot;transition plan&quot;\n&gt; exists).  So, how are you going to make this change?  HTTP re-uses\n&gt; MIME.  It&#39;s understood that this is sub-optimal for HTTP:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; The problem with MIME syntax is that it assumes the transport is\n&gt; lossy, deliberately corrupting things like line breaks and content\n&gt; lengths. The syntax is therefore verbose and inefficient for any system\n&gt; not based on a lossy transport, which makes it inappropriate for HTTP.\n&gt; Since HTTP/1.1 has the capability to support deployment of incompatible\n&gt; protocols, retaining the MIME syntax won&#39;t be necessary for the next\n&gt; major version of HTTP, even though it will likely continue to use the\n&gt; many standardized protocol elements for representation metadata.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; (Representation metadata includes media type identifier, btw.)\n&gt;\n&gt; So, are you suggesting that HTTP be changed/replaced, or that MIME be\n&gt; changed?  Changing MIME to allow some other registry mechanism isn&#39;t\n&gt; just a change to HTTP, but a fundamental change to the Internet.  My\n&gt; point remains that absent some successor to the IANA registry, there is\n&gt; no other way to meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint on the\n&gt; Web and *expect* widespread interoperability, not that IANA is the\n&gt; best-and-only alternative end-of-story -- just the current reality.\n&gt;\n&gt; What transition plan are you anti-IANA-registry folks proposing?  Or do\n&gt; we just use Google as a registry without any transition plan or formal\n&gt; declaration anywhere in the specs allowing that as an option?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\r\n--0015175caa24aa99d90490e8d39d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nEric,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bear in mind that my proposition is not the same a=\r\ns arbitrarily defining a new HTTP method or URI scheme, so I&#39;m not sure=\r\n that the arguments are the same.

The syntax is therefore verbose and ineffici=\r\nent for any system&lt;br&gt;\nnot based on a lossy transport, which makes it inapp=\r\nropriate for HTTP.&lt;br&gt;\nSince HTTP/1.1 has the capability to support deploym=\r\nent of incompatible&lt;br&gt;\nprotocols, retaining the MIME syntax won&#39;t be n=\r\necessary for the next&lt;br&gt;\nmajor version of HTTP, even though it will likely=\r\n continue to use the&lt;br&gt;\nmany standardized protocol elements for representa=\r\ntion metadata.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~field=\r\ning/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.ics.uci.=\r\nedu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(Representation=\r\n metadata includes media type identifier, btw.)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo, are you sugges=\r\nting that HTTP be changed/replaced, or that MIME be&lt;br&gt;\nchanged? =C2=A0Chan=\r\nging MIME to allow some other registry mechanism isn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\njust a chang=\r\ne to HTTP, but a fundamental change to the Internet. =C2=A0My&lt;br&gt;\npoint rem=\r\nains that absent some successor to the IANA registry, there is&lt;br&gt;\nno other=\r\n way to meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint on the&lt;br&gt;\nWeb and *=\r\nexpect* widespread interoperability, not that IANA is the&lt;br&gt;\nbest-and-only=\r\n alternative end-of-story -- just the current reality.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhat transi=\r\ntion plan are you anti-IANA-registry folks proposing? =C2=A0Or do&lt;br&gt;\nwe ju=\r\nst use Google as a registry without any transition plan or formal&lt;br&gt;\ndecla=\r\nration anywhere in the specs allowing that as an option?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#888888&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n-Eric&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0015175caa24aa99d90490e8d39d--\r\n\n"}}
