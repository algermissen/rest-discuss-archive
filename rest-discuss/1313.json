Costello wrote:\n\n&gt;. Doing an HTTP POST the REST way....\n&gt;My understanding is that an XML Schema (or DTD) would be created by\n&gt;Parts Depot, Inc which defines the format that the PO must take.  A\n&gt;client then will create a PO instance document which conforms to the XML\n&gt;Schema, and submit that XML document as the payload of an HTTP POST. \n&gt;Correct?  With a SOAP implementation of this service the only difference\n&gt;would be that the XML document would be wrapped within a SOAP envelope\n&gt;(and there may be a SOAP header).  Is this a correct assessment of the\n&gt;differences between REST and SOAP for this service?  \n\nMy (newly acquired) understanding agrees with this assessment :-/\n\n&gt;Is the ability to\n&gt;add headers in SOAP going to be an advantage over REST in this\n&gt;scenario?\n\nThere has been some discussion on this topic on the list with the consensus being that Http headers are the equivalent.\n\n&gt;Distinguishing characteristics of REST?...\n&gt;May I conclude that in\n&gt;a REST-ful system you would not use URLs with query strings? \n\nIt is my understanding that a query string is valid if used as an optimization to a query-less URI mechanism, i.e. if in your scenario http://www.parts-depot.com/part/00345 is traversable/find-able via http://www.parts-depot.com/part/ which returns an XML list of all the available parts that includes links to the individual parts as in your tutorial (incidentally I think http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345 and http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/ are regarded as a slightly better naming approach because the name more closely matches the resource). \n\n&gt;Can someone enumerate the distinguishing characteristics of a REST\n&gt;system?\n\nYou might take a look at Extreme Web Services at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1204\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
