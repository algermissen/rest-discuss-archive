A Uniform\nInterface for airline reservation systems would mean an agreement as to\nan industry-specific metadata language to mark up existing reservation\nforms to have the same semantics.\n\nIt would not involve the creation of a new media type for airline\nreservations -- as the goal is to allow online reservations, it makes\nsense to stick with ubiquitous media types that browsers already know.\nA new media type, requiring extensive code-on-demand or even a special\nclient-component application for reservationists, would go against the\nREST style.\n\nBusiness rules are a back-end implementation detail.  A REST API\nabstracts these rules away behind a uniform interface frontend.  Just\nlike online airline reservations already do, in practice.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
