Someone\nresponded to one of my first questions to th=\r\nis list with forms as a\ngood solution to a search problem.  For example, a =\r\nserver might\nsupport the following variations of &quot;next states&quot; from a page =\r\nof\nresults:\n\n- Pages (1-N) - allow jumping to any one.\n- Sort critiera - a =\r\nfinite list of sortable fields.\n- Facet - a finite list of filtering facets=\r\n based on a result set.\n- etc.\n\nThis is easily handled with a form (with co=\r\nnstrained option and\nboolean semantics built in), not so much with either U=\r\nRIs or\nURITemplates.  Of course, when the variable data is just an\nunconstr=\r\nained string, I suppose either is good.  Overall, I don&#39;t\nthink forms are l=\r\nimited to &quot;rendering metadata&quot;.\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
