If it doesn&#39;t, it shouldn&#39;t. \n\n&gt; For example,\n&gt; suppose the client does RPOSTs to four load\n&gt; balanced intermediaries. \n\nNow you&#39;re bringing in intermediaries. Clients do not typically do load\nbalancing. Servers do load balancing. If a client wants to set up a\nsystem to do load balancing using intermdiaries then it needs to find a\nway to syncronize them. If a particular REST server wants to provide\nmessage ordering to the clients as a feature then fine, it can do that.\nI&#39;m not going to put something in the spec that is only useful to a tiny\npercentage of all users.\n\n&gt; ...  None of the\n&gt; intermediaries can reach the endpoint so they just\n&gt; ping away until they get a connection.  \n\nThe client made a mistake sending time-ordered messages over\nintermediaries that are not synchronized.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Note, there is also no mechanism to feedback error\n&gt; messages if delivery fails.  \n\nWe&#39;re back into this zone where you are talking about relaying and I\nhaven&#39;t mentioned it. If you want to define a spec for reliable delivery\nof HTTP messages over *relays* then go ahead. That&#39;s a totally different\nproblem.\n\nIn any client/server protocol (including SMTP) it makes no sense to try\nand give feedback that there is a problem at the TCP layer. &quot;It looks\nlike my packets aren&#39;t getting through to you. I just thought you should\nknow.&quot;\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
