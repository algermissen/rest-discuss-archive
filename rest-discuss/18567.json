In any case, you are corre=\r\nct: my use of the word &quot;representing&quot; may cause some confusion with the &quot;re=\r\npresentation&quot; term used in REST. Apart from that, I don&#39;t understand why th=\r\ne rest of your clarification, which seems quite correct but in a point, but=\r\n unrelated. Let me clarify:\n\n1. The UUDI mentioned in the fedora project li=\r\nnk is, as I understand, an internal ID representing some data entity. The c=\r\nonfusion comes when we call that an &quot;Identifier&quot; and mention, in the same s=\r\nentence, that we can access the resource having that ID and the entry point=\r\n URI. That ID is supposed to be created by the server in order to permanent=\r\nly identify the &quot;resource&quot;, since the URIs may change over time, the Fedora=\r\n site says. This is like having two resource identifiers, one that is the U=\r\nRI and another one internal.\n\n2. My explanation: that is not quite right. T=\r\nhat internal identifier is part of the entity implementation and should not=\r\n be used to identify the resource by itself, but it can be used to identify=\r\n the entity. The resource identifier is the URI. Those internal identifiers=\r\n are nice at the business level, and the correct way of using them is throu=\r\ngh a search or other mechanism that can map that internal ID to one resourc=\r\ne, using REST constrains. Simple. \n\n3. So, to me, it is a bad practice to m=\r\nake the server create an ID outside the business layer, expose it and someh=\r\now associate that to the resource identification, say by using URI template=\r\ns. This leads to business exposure in the identification, plus reduces the =\r\nserver control on the URI space, plus some other inconveniences.\n\n4. About =\r\nthe resource and representation, yes, people usually think of a resource to=\r\n be its representation, or that a resource is simply a data record. They ar=\r\ne three completely different things, although a resource may require the re=\r\npresentation and the data record to be implemented.\n\n5. Now, entity to me i=\r\ns not an implementation. We have the logical model where we define an entit=\r\ny, with properties and behavior and such, and then in the &quot;physical&quot; model =\r\nwe implement that, either with a data record, an EDI file or an XML file, a=\r\n service or an object. That is, I disagree a little with your definition of=\r\n entity=3D body+medatada=3D representation. A representation is simply a bu=\r\nnch of bytes, a copy of state, a description message, not an implementation=\r\n of the entity. We can have some entity information, we put it in a format =\r\n(say plain XML) and send it to the server, which in turn creates a resource=\r\n (that would be an entity implementation) and that resource starts its life=\r\n somewhere in that cloud. We may get all or partial information from that e=\r\nntity implementation (the resource) by requesting a representation of the r=\r\nesource using the URI to identify it. So, entity (pure information) &lt;&gt; reso=\r\nurce(Implementation of an Entity) &lt;&gt; representation (binary &quot;view&quot; of a res=\r\nource).\n\nHope this allows a clearer reading of what I meant.\n\nCheers!\n\nWill=\r\niam Martinez.\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Sebastien Lambla &lt;seb@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems there is a lot of confusing sentence construction in =\r\nthat message, or it doesn&#39;t carry the right terminology, can&#39;t quite say.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Resource Identifier: A URI.\n&gt; Resource: A concept / temporal mapping th=\r\nat has a Resource Identifier\n&gt; Representation: A binary stream that contain=\r\ns the state of a Resource at the time of retrieval.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you move a repr=\r\nesentation between two URIs, you have changed neither the resource (the two=\r\n things identified by the URIs) nor the identifiers. You&#39;ve changed the sta=\r\nte of the resource, and that&#39;s it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just because you move the represent=\r\nation from /posts/latest to /post/nearlylatest and assign a new represetnat=\r\nion to /posts/latest, you have not changed what the resource is or how it i=\r\ns identified, you just changed the state (the entity in this case, where en=\r\ntity =3D body + metadata, which is what we call the representation).\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\neb\n\n\n\n"}}
