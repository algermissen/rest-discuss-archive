The difference between LO and LE in\nthis instance really just matters if a human being is looking at a rendered\nrepresentation of the data (should the image be rendered or not?). Or do I\nmisunderstand you in this regard?\n\n&gt; - omitting _properties_ of the message? not following you here. maybe\n&gt; an example you can point to would clear this up for me.\n\nI think what Peter meant here was that just as in, e.g., HTML you could\nommit certain RDF properties in the message if you don&#39;t want that a client\nfollows/knows those URIs. It&#39;s similar to removing an &lt;a&gt; from an HTML\nrepresentation if you wanna remove that state transition.\n\nSimple example in pseudo-code\n\n{\n  &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;order&quot;,\n  &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/orders/13574&quot;,\n  &quot;total&quot;: 150.69,\n  &quot;payment&quot;: &quot;/payment/49840&quot;\n}\n\nIf you would omit the payment property the client wouldn&#39;t be able to follow\nthat link, which is similar to omitting an\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;/payment/49840&quot; rel=&quot;payment&quot;&gt;Payment&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom an HTML representation.\n\n\n&gt; - seems you assume M2M here in several of your replies. is it your POV\n&gt; that RDF is only to be used in M2M scenarios? or do you mean to say\n&gt; that some of the affordances is describe have no value in M2M cases?\n\nI don&#39;t know about Peter&#39;s POV but mine is that RDF has a great potential to\nallow both, M2M and H2M, much better than, e.g., HTML where the link\nrelations are just described in a human readable fashion. We are far away\nfrom that but since in RDF everything is machine processable a client could\n&quot;learn&quot; (or maybe better infer) the meaning of new link relations based on\nhis already existing knowledge for instance.\n\n\n&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine)\n&gt; affordance, i use &quot;x:include&quot; quite often in M2M cases\n\nHmm... Could you elaborate a bit on this? Why don&#39;t you simply include it,\ni.e., merge it into the response instead of just linking to it?\n\n\n&gt; - templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, IME. as long as\n&gt; the vocab is stable and the templates are used to control timing and\n&gt; flow, this has worked well for me. of course H2M templates are much\n&gt; easier to support since the selector is not in the code, but in the\n&gt; head of the human.\n\nAgain, IMHO this is part of the presentational logic which is unimportant in\nM2M scenarios. As long as a M2M client is able to understand the template&#39;s\nvariables and fill them with concrete values there isn&#39;t really any\ndifference to a form, right?\n\n\n&gt; i am writing apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse, and\n&gt; (in some cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses. When i\n&gt; implement those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill; that&#39;s\n&gt; all.\n\nBut you need to program those client apps to look for specific\nlinks/forms/affordances, right? So why do you think this is any different?\nThe only difference I see is that instead of having just a human readable\ndocumentation you make (parts of) it also machine-processable.\n\nBut I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary to describe\nbasic control flows - something I planned to work on rather sooner than\nlater.\n\n\n\n--\nMarkus Lanthaler\n@markuslanthaler\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
