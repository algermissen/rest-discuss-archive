Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; &gt;* John Panzer &lt;jpanzer@...&gt; [2007-06-29 05:20]:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Both Content-Range and PATCH need to define infoset-level\n&gt; &gt;&gt;extensions.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;How is that supposed to work for PUT+Content-Range? That’s a\n&gt; &gt;horrible strain of semantics if you ask me.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the kind of reaction I was looking for :).  It could\n&gt; work like:\n&gt; \n&gt; Content-Range: xpath:(xpath expression selecting a subtree or\n&gt; subset of document)\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, instead of selecting a range of bytes 50-899,\n&gt; you can select entry/author/* only.\n\nAha. Well, you can still change only a single region of the\ndocument per request that way. Or if you use an XPath that\nselects multiple nodes, you can only replace all of the nodes\nwith the same value.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Content-Range might possibly be dropped silently by very\n&gt; &gt;&gt;broken intermediaries, but PATCH is known to be blocked by\n&gt; &gt;&gt;some proxies in certain configurations (e.g., Squid).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That’s exactly the point: when it fails, it fails loudly and\n&gt; &gt;without touching anything. When PUT+Content-Range fails, it\n&gt; &gt;appears to succeed and destroys data.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess this seems a bit odd to me.  If a server that\n&gt; advertises, for example, Accept-Put-Ranges: xpath in its\n&gt; headers then proceeds to ignore Content-Range:, what&#39;s to stop\n&gt; it from treating a PATCH like a PUT? Both seem equally broken\n&gt; behavior to me.\n\nThat wasn’t what I meant. If the origin advertises such support\nbut fails to implement it correctly, obviously no interesting\nargument about the protocol can be drawn from that.\n\n&gt; I am worried about intermediaries though, including things like\n&gt; environments (Flash?) and client libraries.  I&#39;m worried on\n&gt; behalf of both methods.\n\n*That* is what I meant. PATCH will either be supported correctly\nor be rejected by intermediaries. PUT+Content-Range might instead\nbe supported insufficiently well to work but well enough to lead\nto data loss.\n\nIt could be slightly harder to deploy PATCH because a minority of\nintermediaries might reject it while accepting PUT and (probably\nunintentionally, by not meddling with the request) correctly\nsupporting Content-Range on the latter.\n\nBut I favour choices that reduce the chance of a system left in\nan inconsistent state, and between PATCH and PUT+Content-Range,\nboth going across intermediaries, that choice is clearly PATCH.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
