However, for more complex services, the HTTP\n&gt; OPTIONS method would seem to be a viable candidate for providing\n&gt; information about what verbs are available for the resource, what\n&gt; parameters are required, and what other URIs provide related services.\n\nFrom my point of view an URI is a resource (doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be a\nservice). And a service basically &quot;contains&quot; several resources.\nActually this isn&#39;t correct at all IMHO.\n\nIn my definition of RSDL a service contains several operations (not\nrelated to resources at all). An operation may return (or not) one or\nmore resources. This is because the operation&#39;s URI is variable\nbecause of parameters, path info, etc. and you can say one URI is a\nresource, so an operation maps to several URIs which are in turn\nresources.\n\nRSDL or services, IMHO, aren&#39;t URIs. They&#39;re not resources (the RSDL\nfiles are resources, but by &quot;not resources&quot; I mean the semantics of\nit). They&#39;re just descriptions of operations. An RSDL file is of\ncourse identified by an URI, but it&#39;s not a &quot;unique&quot; identifier. This\nis almost the same as RSS feeds... RSS feeds have URIs, but that\ndoesn&#39;t guarantee that the URI is unique or reliable. It can change in\nthe future. In contrast URIs used by the XML namespaces are unique and\nreliable in the sense that they&#39;re used to uniquely identify a\nnamespace. RIDL URIs are used just like XML namespaces in the sense\nthat they&#39;re used to uniquely identify an interface.\n\n&gt; From HTTP RFC 9.2 :\n&gt; &quot;If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the\n&gt; presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type\n&gt; MUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification\n&gt; does not define any use for such a body, future extensions to HTTP\n&gt; might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the\n&gt; server. A server that does not support such an extension MAY discard\n&gt; the request body.&quot;\n&gt;  - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\n\nThanks. This is very helpful. I&#39;ve never heard of the OPTIONS request\nbefore. ;-)\n\n&gt; If something like a RSDL really is necessary, the response body of an\n&gt; OPTIONS request seems like the place for it. The OPTIONS response\n&gt; could also point you to related resources, either using extended\n&gt; headers or something in the response body. For example:\n\nThat maybe good, considering that RSDL is a protocol-independent\nformat, it&#39;s just an XML file. I guess we shouldn&#39;t just use OPTIONS\nfor it but also allow for GET requests to retrieve an RSDL. This is\nprobably for accessibility reasons and the fact that you can&#39;t issue\nan OPTIONS request from your browser. Really, you can&#39;t even post a\nPOST request from your browser without an HTML form, let alone\nOPTIONS, or any other &quot;exotic&quot; methods (even as simple as HEAD).\n\nI&#39;ll add this OPTIONS thingy to be &quot;specification&quot;. Basically what I\nproposed was using &lt;link&gt; tags to reference an RSDL, but OPTIONS can\nbe another way to do it (we should determine the mandatory way though,\nand I&#39;m biased towards using &lt;link&gt; because it&#39;s much more accessible).\n\n&gt; Has something like this been explored previously?\n\nThat&#39;s my question. ;-)\n\nBTW I&#39;m *really* looking for an already-made open standard that is:\n- tailored for REST/SHARE\n- it has the features it needs, like interfaces, conflict resolution, etc.\n- *simple* (and I mean *dead* simple)\n\nBTW regarding REST/SHARE I want to think SHARE as &quot;REST without exotic\nHTTP request methods&quot;. Anybody disagrees with this?\n\nEven so RSDL is suited for both REST and SHARE since it assumes\nnothing about HTTP methods. The HTTP methods are defined in RIDL (if\navailable).\n\n- Hendy (dev.gauldong.net)\n\n"}}
