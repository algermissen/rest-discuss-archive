When parsing the path, is it better to\n&gt; check authentication as soon as you encounter &#39;client&#39; or should you wait\n&gt; until you have parsed the entire path and confirmed whether the path (and\n&gt; therefore request URI) is valid or not?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you authenticate first, it would be possible to request authentication\n&gt; for a URI that&#39;s not even valid.  On the other hand, authenticating only\n&gt; valid URIs would possibly allow a malicious user to &quot;discover&quot; valid URIs\n&gt; without being authenticated.\n\nIf a valid URI does not convey any authority (ie: the client must\nbe authenticated to use it), there is no need to worry about\n&quot;discovery&quot; of valid URIs. From a security point of view, you\nshould assume that if your URIs are guessable, the attacker has\nalready guessed them.\n\nNote that the type of URI you are proposing &#39;/client/xyz&#39; is\nexactly the type of RESTless URI we were discussing in the\nprevious thread.\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
