And what do you mean by &quot;on the 80\n&gt; side&quot;?\n\nsorry; i think i fired that brain dump off a bit too quickly without\nenough elaboration.\n\ni was saying that bob&#39;s case is the more common one.  at least with my\nexperience of ordering (in manufacturing/engineering companies), you\nhave established relationships with a &#39;core&#39; of suppliers.  you are far\nmore likely to be purchasing from a supplier who you have already\npurchased than from a complete &#39;stranger&#39;, so to speak.  you do\noccasionally order from a supplier you haven&#39;t ordered from before, but\nthis is less common than the other case.\n\ni think a &quot;pretty order form&quot; is geared towards strangers, when a\nrelationship is established you just &quot;shoot them a PO&quot; and the\ntwo-resource model is a better match for this.\n\ni had the concern roger voiced about the purchaser needing a web server,\nbut i think in the long-term this wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  might affect\nhow easy it is to adopt a two-resource approach though.\n\nhope this cleared that up.  i am conscious that &quot;doing is better than\ntalking about doing&quot;.  :)\n\n\n\n"}}
