The POST =\r\nis to a URI. We can argue whether the word &quot;mover&quot;\n&gt;&gt;   is a verb or noun, =\r\nbut that is opaque as far as the protocol\n&gt;&gt;   is concerned.\n&gt;\n&gt; By that to=\r\nken you need only one URI and only POST. Err, wait=85\n\nThat&#39;s further gener=\r\nalization than I was implying. The resource in my  \nexample was solely ther=\r\ne to represent some well-defined thing. When it  \nis ephemeral, it follows =\r\nthe web-style redirect-after-post pattern.  \nWhen it is not, it returns 201=\r\n, i.e, a new sub-ordinate resource gets  \ncreated under the URI used to POS=\r\nT. If the operation is done  \nasynchronously, it returns a 202 and a link t=\r\no something to monitor it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. The fact that the representation refers=\r\n to other resources\n&gt;&gt;   does not break the uniform interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; You aren=\r\n=92t talking about anything I said. Since I suggested\n&gt; sending one of the =\r\nURIs in the entity body myself, I don=92t know\n&gt; what argument you think I =\r\nwas making.\n\nI was referring to the second part of &quot;you put the\nverb in the=\r\n URI and the addresses in the entity body&quot;.\n\n&gt;&gt; 4. Caches will not be able =\r\nto flush, and that is true for any\n&gt;&gt;   operation that spawns multiple reso=\r\nurces resources. The\n&gt;&gt;   solution by Stefan, by you, and the one I posted =\r\nhave the\n&gt;&gt;   same characteristic. That&#39;s why we have invalidation\n&gt;&gt;   cac=\r\nhing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The solutions that POST to one of the nodes will fail to\n&gt; invali=\r\ndate the other; the solution you proposed will fail to\n&gt; invalidate *any* o=\r\nf them.\n\nSorry, but IMHO, that is splitting hairs. This issue crops up when=\r\never  \na change to one resource affects some other resource.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhtt=\r\np://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
