It says\nonly that the resource is now out-of-date.  The\nserver may or may not know how to resolve the\nsituation (e.g. it may retrieve the URL or it may\ntell someone else to deal with it)\n\nEither way telling the server that a resource is\nout-of-date is very different from using POST\nor PUT to change it.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
