Internal APIs tend to be \n&gt; more fine-grained and have a richer feature set than their external \n&gt; counterparts.  Those fine-grained APIs are more prone to change over \n&gt; time.  HATEOAS is meant help manage those kinds of changes .\n&gt; \n\nI disagree.  HATEOAS helps humans manage change pretty well on the web. \n  I&#39;m very skeptical it can do the same for machine clients, for reasons \nstated in an earlier thread.  Still, that doesn&#39;t mean its not useful. \nIts just not as useful for machine clients as it is for humans.\n\nI know I stated this in an earlier thread, but combining links \n(HATEOAS), conneg, custom versioned media types, and XML schema is the \nmost interesting for me.  Then, you can have validated, guaranteed, \nversioned interactions with your services.\n\n\n\nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
