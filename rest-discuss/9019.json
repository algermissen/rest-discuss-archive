Of course the state of the resource after the action \nhas taken place will be one of the influences on this, but the state of \nthe resource before the action is another, as with a few other factors \n(the most obvious case being server-error - not a factor that affects \nidempotence [if there is an error or expiry we can no longer depend upon \nidempotency and this is stated] but one that affects response status.\n\nBerend de Boer wrote:\n &gt;     Jon&gt; All I can see on this is that the effect upon the server of\n &gt;     Jon&gt; two DELETEs is (barring interactions with other actions\n &gt;     Jon&gt; between the first and the second) is the same, not that the\n &gt;     Jon&gt; response must be the same.\n &gt;\n &gt; It&#39;s an idempotent method (2616, 9.1.2) which implies this imo.\n\nI definitely see how it implies this, but not how it entails this.\n\nIdempotence (as definied in RFC 2616 9.1.2) refers only to the \nside-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests - that is to say, the state of \nany affected resources after the request was made - not the details of \nthe response (which at the very least should always have a different \ndate header unless the 2 requests were less than a second apart).\n\nConsider a DELETE to http://example.net/del\n\n1st request:\nStatus: 200/202/204\nState of server after action: http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t exists\nState of client after action: Knows that http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t \nexist (or may not in the future if response is 202).\nState of intermeditaries: Any record of http://example.net/del marked as \nstale.\n\n2nd request:\nStatus: 202/404/410\nState of server after action: http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t exists\nState of client after action: Knows that http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t \nexist (or may not in the future if response is 202).\nState of intermeditaries: Any record of http://example.net/del marked as \nstale.\n\nnth request:\nStatus: 202/404/410\nState of server after action: http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t exists\nState of client after action: Knows that http://example.net/del doesn&#39;t \nexist (or may not in the future if response is 202).\nState of intermeditaries: Any record of http://example.net/del marked as \nstale.\n\nThe side effect (http://example.net/del is either deleted or marked for \nlater deletion in the case of 202) is the same after n requests as after \n1. It satisfies the definition of idempotency as stated.\n2. The one case where the nth request could differ from the (n-1)th \nrequest is if a 202 from previously was acted upon with the result that \nthe state of http://example.net/del changes from &quot;marked for deletion&quot; \nto &quot;deleted&quot;. However, this would be a case of expiry and/or other \noperations (since idempotency can be affected by other operations that \nhappen between the (n-1)th and nth request).\n\n\n"}}
