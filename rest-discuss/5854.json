When you put request modifiers in =\r\nthe Query String you are\n&gt; &gt; creating new resources where you shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I see. I believe I was thrown I was thrown by the word\n&gt; &quot;creat=\r\ning.&quot; Basically, I think you&#39;re saying that you shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; specify data to=\r\n be used for content negotiation in query parameters\n&gt; because each set of =\r\nquery parameters embodies a different URI, which\n&gt; implies a different reso=\r\nurce. Whereas request headers parameterize\n&gt; the same URI, which implies th=\r\ne same resource. Is that correct?\n\nMore or less, except I&#39;m not just talkin=\r\ng about content negotiation\nbut about all the request-header fields (conneg=\r\n, authorization, etc.).\nAlso, request-headers parametrize the request which=\r\n can be for the\nsame URI. This is about moving away from the &quot;URI as a docu=\r\nment\nidentifier&quot; definition and moving towards the &quot;URI represents a\nresour=\r\nce (conceptual entity)&quot; definition which is more in line with\nREST [1]. Rem=\r\nember, cool URIs don&#39;t change [2].\n\n&gt; If so, I agree with that, though I am=\r\n leaning away from most content\n&gt; negotiation anyway. For usability reasons=\r\n, I think an article\n&gt; translated into different languages should each have=\r\n a different URI\n&gt; for each language. Likewise for usability I think the PD=\r\nF form of an\n&gt; article should have a different URI from the HTML form. I do=\r\n think\n&gt; content negotiation would be OK for things like deciding between G=\r\nIF\n&gt; and PNF for an image, i.e., for forms of content that are\n&gt; &quot;commoditi=\r\nes&quot; or very substitutable.\n\nI know what you mean especially from an usabili=\r\nty perspective given\nthe current state of affairs [3] but there is a cost i=\r\nnvolved in doing\nthis as you might end up fragmenting your resource space. =\r\nSay one of\nthe articles on your website was about an &quot;Interview with Mr. Fo=\r\no Bar&quot;\nand you had two versions of it, one in English\n(http://artima.com/ar=\r\nticles/en/interview-with-foo-bar.html) and\nanother in French\n(http://artima=\r\n.com/articles/fr/interview-with-foo-bar.html). Now\nsuppose this article is =\r\nviewed a lot by your English speaking audience\nand they happen to point to =\r\nit from various places on the web, you end\nup undervaluing the French versi=\r\non which is actually the same\nresource. Apart from this, request-headers gi=\r\nve us a standard way to\nparametrize the request and get to the different re=\r\npresentations\nwhereas buy putting this information in the URI in a non-stan=\r\ndard way\nmakes its harder to get to the other representations.\n\nExample:\n\nh=\r\nttp://artima.com/articles/interview-with-foo-bar\nAccept: text/html\n\nBy chan=\r\nging the Accept header to application/pdf like so\n\nhttp://artima.com/articl=\r\nes/interview-with-foo-bar\nAccept: application/pdf\n\na client can easily get =\r\nto the other format. Similarly, if the French\nspeaking reader visits the si=\r\nte he is automatically (provided his\nbrowser is setup properly) presented t=\r\nhe french version of the\narticle. If this was not the case and since the Fr=\r\nench version was\nundervalued (due to the lack of links pointing to it), he =\r\nmight have\nended up finding the English version through a search engine and=\r\n then\nwould have to choose (using a non-standard way) the French version.\n\n=\r\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fie=\r\nlding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2_1\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2=\r\n004/REC-webarch-20041215/#URI-persistence\n[3] http://sandeep.shetty.in/2006=\r\n/04/browserland-http.html\n\n"}}
