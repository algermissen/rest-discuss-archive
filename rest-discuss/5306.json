Use specific XML media types, otherwise your messages\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t RESTful because they&#39;re not self-descriptive.\n&gt; \n&gt; XML is self descriptive.\n\nNonsense.\n\n&gt; We should use specific media types, but generally speaking, why should\n&gt; we get the chance of inconsistencies between metadata and\n&gt; representation [1], when the representation is self-descriptive?\n\nYou&#39;ve got that backwards.  Inconsistency/ambiguity (and the resulting\nsecurity and performance problems) exists when you infer metadata from\ndata (sometimes called &quot;sniffing&quot;);\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect.html\n\n&gt; &gt;  In other words,\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s no path, using only public specifications, from this message;\n&gt; \n&gt; I still wonder why we don&#39;t have URIs instead of mime types... I\n&gt; thought that this was on TAG issues list.\n\nWe do have URIs for media types, they&#39;re just not used in any protocols\nAFAIK.\n\ne.g. http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/xop+xml\n\n&gt; &gt; HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\n&gt; &gt; Content-Type: application/xml\n&gt; &gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ...\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ... to the XHTML specification.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is namespace, at that location there is a human readable\n&gt; description of the namespace intent and a hyperlink to the spec,\n\nYes, but my point is that there&#39;s no spec that prescribes the process\nthat you just went through.  On the contrary, RFC 3023 says this;\n\n  An XML document labeled as text/xml or application/xml might contain\n  namespace declarations, stylesheet-linking processing instructions\n  (PIs), schema information, or other declarations that might be used\n  to suggest how the document is to be processed.  For example, a\n  document might have the XHTML namespace and a reference to a CSS\n  stylesheet.  Such a document might be handled by applications that\n  would use this information to dispatch the document for appropriate\n  processing.\n\nEmphasis on &quot;might&quot;, aka &quot;ambiguity results if ...&quot;.\n\nThat said, most browsers assume application/xml works as you suggest,\njust not all (e.g. IE).  But browsers aren&#39;t the only client of XML.\n\nSee; http://www.markbaker.ca/2004/01/XmlDispatchTest/\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
