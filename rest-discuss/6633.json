Whether that fleetname existed or not is essentially\nimmaterial - doesn&#39;t matter at all ; the PUT says &quot;it exists now and\nhere&#39;s exactly the entire state of it&quot;\n\nA POST on the other hand is for modification without replacement.\nupdates. POST /vehicles/fleetname &lt;one vehicle&gt; adds that vehicle to the\nfleet, or alternately, replaces the existing vehicle with that name with\nthe specified representation. Again, it&#39;s really the same operation.\n\nSo that handles 1-4. 5 can be done a few ways: \n 1) multiple transactions: \n        GET the vehicle, \n        DELETE the vehicle from the current fleet, \n\tPOST the vehicle to the new fleet\n 2) if the vehicle has a list of the fleets it&#39;s in, you could POST\n    an update to that vehicle that changed that list - after which\n    the URI you posted to might not exist, of course :)\n\nJust my $0.02.  Hope it helped, or was at least food for thought.\n\n  --pj\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct 4, 2006, Scott Mohekey writes:\n&gt;I&#39;ve been researching REST for some weeks now and have come across many\n&gt;different interpretations. In general, they all seem to agree on the\n&gt;definition of what GET and DELETE should do, however they can vary\n&gt;wildly in what the proper definition of PUT and POST are.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, in an effort to clarify this, I have a number of use cases that I&#39;d\n&gt;like to present, and hopefully generate some discussion as to how they\n&gt;would be implemented.\n&gt;\n&gt;Firstly though, a description of the resources in the problem space:\n&gt;\n&gt;Vehicle: A vehicle has a set of data associated with it, typically\n&gt;license details, maintenance records etc. \n&gt;\n&gt;Fleet: A fleet is a collection of vehicles, it has a name and other\n&gt;similar properties. A single vehicle can be in more than one fleet.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have tentatively mapped these in the url space as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;/vehicles/{fleet}/{vehicle}\n&gt;\n&gt;There is also an implicit All fleet that contains all of the vehicles.\n&gt;\n&gt;So now we have that out of the way, we come to the use cases:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. Creating a fleet.\n&gt;2. Modifying a fleet.\n&gt;3. Creating a vehicle.\n&gt;4. Modifying a vehicle.\n&gt;5. Moving a vehicle from one fleet to another.\n&gt;\n&gt;My initial thoughts were that 1, and 3 should be handled via PUT, and 2,\n&gt;and 4 with POST. I have no idea how 5 would be handled, a POST?\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help on this as I&#39;m totally confused.\n&gt;\n&gt;Scott.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
