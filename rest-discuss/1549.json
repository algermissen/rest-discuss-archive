But it is hard to imagine people using the web for any of these\n&gt; activities, literally. Do you have examples of analogous activities that\n&gt; would make sense as web applications?\n\nBy no means am I suggesting that people use the web for driving a car. 8-)\nNo, I am simply abstracting the argument that conceptually, people think\nboth in terms of actions and resources, and that certain concepts are better\nthought of as actions.\n\nOk, let me see if I can come up with a example of a distributed application\nthat is more naturally thought of procedurally.  How about a distributed\nfantasy role-playing game?  The players perform actions in a simulated\nworld.  This world is certainly full of noun resources and there can be URLs\nthat refers to each player, each castle, each river, etc.\n\nBut, I can also see the advantage of exposing verb URLs can be used to\nperform actions such as crossing a river, kill an daemon, etc.  Again, I&#39;m\nnot saying we get rid of noun-URLs, by God we know we need them.  But, let&#39;s\nallow the programmers to add a few verb URLs in there when it makes sense.\n\n&gt; &gt; I never said that resource-modeling isn&#39;t valuable - on the contrary.\nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; only saying that resource modeling isn&#39;t the *only* valuable way to do\n&gt; &gt; things.  RDBMS and SQL is certain useful, but so are spreadsheets and\nweb\n&gt; &gt; logs.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how spreadsheets or weblogs demand a procedural approach.\n\nI would be that last person to say that spreadsheets and weblogs represent\nprocedural approaches. 8-)  If you would reread what I wrote, I am simply\nreplying to Mike&#39;s analogy.  I was saying that that I am not arguing\n*against* noun-oriented URLs, but rather that we should not eliminate\nverb-oriented URLs.  This is analogous in the same way that I would not\nargue against the usefulness of RDBMS, but I still think spreadsheets are\nuseful.\n\n&gt; For an authoritative answer, I will also defer to the people who defined\n&gt; and are refining REST. But my sense is that procedural programs tend to\n&gt; be fragile in a loosely-coupled distributed environment, which is what\n&gt; the Web has been and most people expect Web Services to be.\n\nProcedural programming *can* be fragile, but I don&#39;t think that they\nnecessarily have to be.  Creating properties and modes that is then set by\nthe client can also be very fragile.  Fragility has less to do with being\nprocedural or representational than whether the design is good or whether\nthe model accurately reflects the nature of the application.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
