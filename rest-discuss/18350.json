For \ninstance in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18337:\n\n&gt; There are also server and client perspectives of the\n&gt; interaction which *do* include these semantics - *established for a\n&gt; URI by the server and shared with the client via some hypertext\n&gt; control*. This has to happen otherwise neither would have a frame of\n&gt; reference for how to make or receive the request. i.e. hypertext is\n&gt; the mechanism by which shared understanding is exposed and controlled\n&gt; in REST applications.\n\nAnd in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18322:\n\n&gt; In this example the shared understanding is really coming from the link \n&gt; relations.\n&gt; Link relations can exist independently from the media type, which is how\n&gt; shared understanding is established when using generic (hyper)media types.\n\nSo, in short, &quot;hypertext is the mechanism by which shared understanding is \nexposed and controlled in REST applications.&quot;.\n\nIf you follow this logic then you could even argue that media-types in \nheaders are completely irrelevant. All you need to do is to decorate the \nlink-reltypes with the possible media-type. Instead of one link with reltype \n&quot;salesorder&quot; you could have &quot;salesorder-xml&quot;, &quot;salesorder-pdf&quot;, \n&quot;salesorder-IBM&quot;, and so on - and throw away content negotiation at the same \ntime.\n\nBut it builds on a false assumption of always following a link-reltype. Here \nis a couple of examples where it won&#39;t work:\n\n- A friend sends you a link to an image. You click on it and have absolutely \nno link-reltype to indicate what kind of stuff you will get. &quot;Luckily&quot; the \nserver returns content-type: image/jpeg such that your browser knows how to \nhandle it.\n\n- A spidering service is presented with a bunch of URLs it should index. It \nhas no apriori knowledge of what to get from those URLs. Again the server \nreturns a usefull content-type and magic happens (and application/xml is not \nusefull from this prspective).\n\n- The &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot;/&gt; has no link-reltype stating &quot;this is a JPEG&quot; or &quot;this \nis a GIF&quot;. It relies on the returned content-type (and content negotiation \nwith the accept header).\n\n- A paper bussiness card contains a URL to the digital representation of it. \nWhat if the server returns &quot;application/xml&quot;? How would you know how to \ndecode it? Luckily it returns &quot;application/vcard+xml&quot; (or &quot;text/vcard&quot; or \n...).\n\n- A price comparing services trawls through whatever URLs it can pick up \nfrom the internet, looking for media-types &quot;application/vnd.sap.pricing+xml&quot; \n(fictive) and &quot;application/open-pricing+xml&quot; (also fictive). When ever it \nfinds those it will read prices and accumulate a database of them.\n\nMy last example is what I think is most important. Here is what would happen \nif we only use application/xml and link-reltypes:\n\na) The client retrieves a hypertext document from server A.\n\nb) The hypertext document contains a link with reltype \n&quot;this-is-an-imageprocessor-of-type-X&quot; that links to server B which is not \nunder the control of server A.\n\nc) The client follows the link sending an accept header with &quot;Accept: \napplication/xml&quot;.\n\nd) The server returns &quot;Content-type: application/xml&quot; and, well, some XML.\n\ne) Unfortunately server B has been upgraded without informing server A (how \nshould it, it is a truely distributed system with independent components). \nSo it instead of returning XML for &quot;imageprocessor-of-type-X&quot; (as the \nlink-reltype told the client) it now returns XML for \n&quot;imageprocessor-of-type-Y&quot;.\n\nf) The client breaks.\n\nIf instead the client had sent &quot;Accept: application/imageprocesser-x+xml&quot; \nthen the server would have known that it should return the old format - or a \nredirect to a server capable of working with the expected format.\n\nBy utilizing not only link-reltypes but also media-types we make it possible \nto work in a truely distributed network system where the servers as well as \nclients are free to change over time without any kind of coordination.\n\nThe link-reltype tells the client what link to follow - the media-type in \nthe accept header tells the server what the client expects from it - \nsomething that the server cannot know otherwise.\n\nThe fact is that link-reltypes are not enough. Thinking so does not take the \nnature of truely distributed applications into account. It builds on the \nassumption that the resource that contains the link is coupled/synchronized \nwith the resource that it points to. I think Jan has been trying to say this \na couple of times - here is my interpretation of it.\n\nWe need something more than link-reltypes and media-types is the answer to \nthat.\n\n/J�rn\n\n\n\n"}}
