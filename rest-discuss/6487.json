Whilst\nkeeping hold o=\r\nf status monitor resources for eternity isn&#39;t a\nshowstopper (they will just=\r\n be a row in a DB) it is far from ideal\nrequiring the server to store poten=\r\ntially huge numbers of monitor\n&#39;records&#39;*.\n \nHas anyone implemented status =\r\nmonitors with a limited lifecycle and if\nso:\n1) how have you defined that l=\r\nifecycle \n2) what is the client-server interaction across and beyond the li=\r\nfecycle\nof a monitor. In other words what would be returned (HTTP Status) a=\r\ns the\nclient invokes a GET as the monitor moves through different states an=\r\nd\nis ultimately deleted?\n \nPOST is a straightforward example and I am speci=\r\nfically thinking of an\nasynchronous DELETE request where the client needs t=\r\no know if its\nrequest has failed or not. Polling the original resource and =\r\nexpecting a\n404 is obviously insufficient in the case that the DELETE has b=\r\neen\nattempted and failed as the client will poll indefintely.\n \nThanks and =\r\nregards,\nPhil\n \n* Even if there is only one monitor per resource it will st=\r\nill be\nnecessary to store per-request details so the storage requirements a=\r\nre\neffectively the same.\n\n\nwww.mourant.com\nThe information in this email (a=\r\nnd any attachments) may contain privileged and confidential information and=\r\n is intended solely for the use of the individual or organisation to whom i=\r\nt is addressed.
