transaction, because the form, when properly filled out, is all of the\n&gt; information that is necessary to perform the transaction. You can take\n&gt; that form to ANY Post Office and the System will act upon it\n&gt; appropriately. You don&#39;t have to do it from your original post office,\n&gt; from it&#39;s city, or state. Any Post Office in the system can handle that\n&gt; request. There are no prerequisites.\n&gt;\n&gt; All it requires is a properly filled out form. If the form is not valid,\n&gt; the System will reject the form. At which point you can go fix the form\n&gt; and start over (get back in line). Or you can come back tomorrow. Or you\n&gt; can mail it in. Or you can drive to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and drop it\n&gt; off there. The end effect is the same, your address will be changed. The\n&gt; fact that you&#39;ve tried before, and where you&#39;ve tried before, has no\n&gt; bearing on the request itself, nor who you gave the request too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course the Post Office maintains, somewhere, somehow, the\n&gt; relationship between you and where you live. But that is not &quot;state&quot; in\n&gt; this context. I consider that the value of the resource. (To help\n&gt; disambiguate between the two in discussions.)\n\nthanks for bringing up that example. i have decided for a while now that \ntraditional (pre-electronic) forms-based business processes are *the* \nperfect example to explain everything there is to explain about REST. \nbureaucracy has always been about formalizing interactions, hiding \nimplementations, and making all interactions self-contained. it can be a \nbit painful for clients (&quot;but i just *told* you what i am asking \nabout&quot;), but it means that every office drone can go to lunch at any \ntime. personally, i read kafka now as a description of a RESTful system, \nand how it perfectly hides everything that&#39;s going on inside.\n\nfor a little while, i was even tempted to write a book (or more \nmodestly, start a site) that explains everything about REST with 19th \ncentury office stories. it would be a lot of fun, and probably much more \nuseful than many of the over-abstract explanations. and of course there \nare limits in terms of form complexity and the number of workers you \ncould implement, but that really doesn&#39;t take away the fact that REST \nsimply defines the architectural style of bureaucracy (and i mean that \nin a flattering way).\n\nhere&#39;s a challenge: is there anything in REST that you think does not \nmap fairly easily to that analogy? i&#39;d be really curious to hear about \nwhat that might be.\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n"}}
