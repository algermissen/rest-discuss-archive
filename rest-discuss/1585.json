The answer to your question is\n&gt; because objects (aka resources) are what the Web chose to \n&gt; center itself\n&gt; upon.  You can try and give methods URIs if you like, and \n&gt; perhaps you&#39;ll\n&gt; build something useful (I doubt it).  But it won&#39;t be REST.\n\nMark, I just reread the relevant URI chapter of Roy&#39;s thesis on REST and no\nwhere does it indicate that a resource must be an object.  I still don&#39;t see\na real solid reason that giving methods URIs is a bad thing, but if it is\nsimply not REST for no particular reason other than that REST is defined to\nnot allow it, I guess so be it.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m going to drop out of this now, since we&#39;ve been around it several\n&gt; times and you still don&#39;t appear to be getting it.  But best of luck\n&gt; figuring this out! 8-)\n\nWill miss your input.  I will need to spend more time on other things as\nwell. 8-)\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
