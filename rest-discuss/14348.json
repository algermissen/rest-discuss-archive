I&#39;m specifically\n&gt; talking about an &quot;HTTP-based impl=\r\nementation of the REST style.&quot;  In\n&gt; this case, the HTTP spec gets to defin=\r\ne the methods and their\n&gt; semantics.  Any protocol riding on top of HTTP sh=\r\nould only be\n&gt; &quot;filling-out or fixing the details of underspecified bits of=\r\n standard\n&gt; protocols&quot;[1].  My point was that this interface is defined as =\r\nthe\n&gt; interface between system components - independent of a representation=\r\n\n&gt; (e.g. that HTML leaves off DELETE doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a part of the\n&gt; =\r\ninterface).  Your problem(s) that I&#39;ve seen seem to be related to the\n&gt; fac=\r\nt that you&#39;ve constrained yourself to a protocol that doesn&#39;t give\n&gt; you yo=\r\nur desired level of resource granularity, such that it results\n&gt; in undefin=\r\ned behavior.\n&gt; \n\nI get much more pushback than Roy, even though he&#39;s more e=\r\nxtreme about\nit than I am, as in this post:\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/=\r\n2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons\n\nRoy implies that defining PUT, POST, =\r\nPATCH, OPTIONS and DELETE on a\nresource defined by a representation that&#39;s =\r\nan image/gif amounts to an\nRPC interface.  I would call it a generic HTTP i=\r\nnterface.  But it\ndefinitely isn&#39;t a uniform REST interface, unless it&#39;s wr=\r\napped in some\nkind of hypertext media type that encompasses the desired met=\r\nhods.\n\nIt has nothing to do with my given example.\n\nPATCH is an underspecif=\r\nied bit of protocol.  DELETE&#39;s omission from\ntext/html (or image/gif) is no=\r\nt an oversight you can just ignore.\nWhile it&#39;s always there in the generic =\r\ninterface, in order for the\ninterface to be uniform, its use must be define=\r\nd by the media type.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
