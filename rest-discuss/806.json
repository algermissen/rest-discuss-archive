We at least have to raise the level\nof abstraction, so that we have an industry-wide way to do long-running\nrequests--I need a way to send a request to a server and not the get result\nfor five days.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s what the response status of &quot;Accepted&quot; is meant for. Since there is\ncurrently no common way of getting the final response people think it can&#39;t\nbe done. It can, but few other than Paul/etc. have blazed the trail.\n\nIf we play our cards right with asynch http we can fill in the missing piece\nthat the soap builders think requires a new protocol, and perhaps pop the\nhype bubble surrounding soap. Resource modelling applied to asynch\ncommunication isn&#39;t all that hard - put together some client and server apis\nand a few whitepapers and let technology evolution take its course.\n\nmike\nPS\nI&#39;m not sure &#39;...industry wide way...&#39; is required or even good for a\ndecentralized/evolutionary system like the Web. A few large pockets that are\ninteroperable sounds good to me.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jim Ancona&quot; &lt;jim@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, February 26, 2002 10:08 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Don Box predicts death of HTTP, film at 11\n\n\n&gt; http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-845220.html\n&gt;\n&gt; =====\n&gt; Jim Ancona\n&gt; jim@...                     jancona@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
