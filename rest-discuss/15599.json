Atompub uses a @rel=edit to indicate\nan editable link, which, seems ok.  Then I was reading in the nifty\nnew RESTful Cookbook (thanks mike), where it has an example using\nrel=add-review  and this struck me as a bit rpc-ish.  The book also\nsuggests that the link relation documentation should:\n\n1) Indicate valid methods for the target URI\n2) Indicate expected media types on request/response for the target URI\n\nThis seemed to me to be mixing concerns.  For example, it seems that\nthe resource should define what methods are allowed (all are valid?)\nitself - independent of any link relation.  Besides pointing me to\nAtompub, are there other good examples out there?\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n"}}
