This doesn&#39;t seem to be\na very useful approach to me, as the uri space is essentially a tree,\nand mapping composites to it in such a way seems to limit it&#39;s\nusefulness.\n\nI&#39;ve had a look at the blinksale api that was recently submitted for\nperusal to the rest-discuss list, and it seems to agree with me.\n\nOn Tue, 2006-10-03 at 23:36 -0500, Hugh Winkler wrote:\n&gt; On 10/3/06, Scott Mohekey &lt;scott.mohekey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is where I&#39;m confused. Are you saying that by modifying a\n&gt; property\n&gt; &gt; of fleet1, as opposed to a member of it. I have to also create\n&gt; &gt; replacements for all of the members?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yup. You replace the whole resource at that URI with a new one. You\n&gt; would PUT a document representing the new version of the fleet.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are wondering whether you can or should update the collection\n&gt; mebers just as you might update the name property. Answer: No,\n&gt; usually.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therre are two ways to represnt the fleet resource you&#39;re describing:\n&gt; a bunch of properties, like &#39;name&#39;, and a collection of vehicle URIs;\n&gt; or as a bunch of properties, and a single URI referencing the\n&gt; collection of vehicle URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either way, at the application level, you would prohibit modifying the\n&gt; individual vehicle URIs or the collection reference URI. If the\n&gt; client PUTs a representation that modifies the collection, the server\n&gt; either returns 4xx, or ignores that part of the request.\n&gt; \n&gt; In your application it would just be illegal to modify the vehicles\n&gt; collection any way other than POST on the fleet URI, or PUT or DELETE\n&gt; on the vehicle URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; So to modify a fleet, PUT a new representation of it, but that\n&gt; representation is constrained.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hugh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
