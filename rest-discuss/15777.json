The name of this project tweaks me, but some of the specs under it seem relevant.\nRoy on REST-*: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/13266  (&#39;nuf said :-)\n\nI agree these have nothing to do with REST exactly, and I hate the REST-* name. The individual specs seem to try to create RESTful implementations of integration patterns in the same way as Atom and AtomPub attempt to solve pub/sub in a RESTful way. That said, Roy&#39;s statement &quot;this is the single dumbest attempt at one-sided &#39;standardization&#39; of anti-REST architecture&quot; seems mysterious to me and is quite conclusory. How did he leap from these being about something other than REST to them being &quot;anti-REST&quot;. Would AtomPub become anti-REST if it had been wrongly renamed RestPub? \n\nHe makes two assertions that follow:\n- Distributed transactions are an architectural component of non-REST interaction. \n- Message queues are a common integration technique for non-REST architectures. \n\nI could also make the statement that pub/sub syndication models are a common integration techniques for non-REST architectures, which would not prove that Atom and AtomPub are non-RESTful. There are patterns of integration, and I expect to find them in every architectural style. If there is some impossibility conjecture here, I&#39;d like to see it stated in a more analytic way, without the bashing. It may be that a distributed transaction pattern must must violate one of the RESTful architecure principles, but this is far from obvious. Maybe this is some deep corollary of the CAP theory or something. Or perhaps not.\n\nThe corresponding statement about message queues seems baffling. These solve a harder problem than guaranteed delivery. Queues solve guaranteed delivery to exactly one consumer among competing consumers with some fairness guarantees. \n\nHow would I implement a RESTful way to have airport passengers acquire taxi transportation at the airport in a fair way?\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
