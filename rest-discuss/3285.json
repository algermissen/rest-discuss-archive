Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Questions that I think need to be answered:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. How do you know what MIME-types one may POST or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PUT to a given resource?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My proposal is that servers return accept-POST and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accept-PUT headers in response to GET requests,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; however these headers are not actually defined\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in any standard so perhaps there is another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like a solution to this problem also, I think it would help promote\n&gt; &gt; REST oriented applications.\n&gt; &gt; There has been some discussion on this list in the past, here is a summary\n&gt; &gt; of the approaches I&#39;ve heard:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1 Metadata within response content.\n&gt; &gt; This works for HTML, but isn&#39;t suitable for unforgiving content like JPG,\n&gt; &gt; GIF, PDF, MS-Word, schema-bound XML, etc.\n&gt; &gt; For a custom app with your own content types, you could use a &lt;meta&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &lt;head&gt; element to provide the needed info.\n&gt; &gt; Ideally, the metadata would be available via a HEAD method as well, and this\n&gt; &gt; approach doesn&#39;t work with that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2 Metadata within response headers\n&gt; &gt; This is your proposal, to have something like Accept-POST and Accept-PUT\n&gt; &gt; response headers for GET and HEAD.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3 Metadata in a separate resource known to original resource\n&gt; &gt; 3.1 Identified by response content\n&gt; &gt; The content can provide the location of the metadata, rather than the\n&gt; &gt; metadata itself. Same problems as #1 (doesn&#39;t work for all content types,\n&gt; &gt; etc.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3.2 Identified by response header\n&gt; &gt; This would be a header something like Meta-Location and would be availble\n&gt; &gt; via GET or HEAD.\n&gt; &gt; Putting metadata in a separate resource allows for content negotiation to\n&gt; &gt; happen on the description of the resource, so we don&#39;t get stuck with not\n&gt; &gt; enough metadata in the headers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4 Metadata in a separate resource but unknown to original resource\n&gt; &gt; This inverts the problem - you have the URL to a resource definition, but\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t know what the resources are that it applies to. However, you could\n&gt; &gt; explicitly list those resources, or provide a pattern that matches the URI\n&gt; &gt; of the resources the defintion applies to. If you gather enough descriptions\n&gt; &gt; you probably could do the lookup...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
