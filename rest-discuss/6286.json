Thanks. I was too early!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; You (or your security people) may be wanting to do HTTPS client\n&gt; authentication as well. (Maybe that&#39;s the point?) In that case, the\n&gt; server must have a store of valid client certificates and will refuse\n&gt; requests unless the client provides a certificate in this store.\n\nYes, we will want to check that the client is authorised.\n&lt;unsure&gt;\n We (server) will hold public/private key pairs.\nWe&#39;ll issue a public key | certificate to clients who will use it\nto PUT data to our server. &lt;/unsure&gt;\n\nDoes that make sense Chris?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In all these cases it&#39;s simply a transport-level detail, like HTTP\n&gt; authentication. Your application code shouldn&#39;t need to change\n&gt; providing it uses an API at a sufficiently high level (e.g.\n&gt; java.net.URL, Apache HTTP client, GNU inetlib). It just needs to be\n&gt; configured in a certain way during deployment.\n\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for.\n\n\nregards\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
