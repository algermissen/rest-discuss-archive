But if=\r\n you think about it, solution 2 has the exact same amount of out-of-band in=\r\nformation, only this time it has moved to the interpretation of the media t=\r\nype=92s specification. In both cases, the client needs to be adapted specif=\r\nically to interact with the media type. And how decoupled is it when client=\r\n and server are constrained to a specific message format?\n\nThings _could_ b=\r\ne different with a self-describing format, as this might overcome the need =\r\nfor specific media types. So here=92s another situation:\n3) Use a self-desc=\r\nribing format (such as RDF); no need to explain, and the client can work th=\r\nis out by itself.\n(Although I=92m being slightly overoptimistic about RDF n=\r\now.) The idea would be that the client can interpret the representation as =\r\nbeing a maze, and continue to use it that way.\n\nMy basic question is thus: =\r\ndo specific media types really reduce coupling, and if not, what does?\n\nBes=\r\nt,\n\nRuben\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/d/topic/hypermedia-web/LdKfi47QCxw=\r\n/discussion\n\n\n\n"}}
