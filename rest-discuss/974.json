Representations can be\n&gt; transformed willy nilly with no implication, but names cannot.\n\nHmmm....  is that true?  Think about it.\n\n&gt; &gt; Good question.  The answer at first seems to be yes, and this seems to be a\n&gt; &gt; weakness.  The mechanism for avoiding this problem is the same as it is in\n&gt; &gt; XML:  introduce namespaces inside URI components to avoid collision.  But we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t even have to do anything to introduce those;  the &#39;;&#39; property space\n&gt; &gt; does our job for us.  Instead of namestd:help you have help;namestd or what\n&gt; &gt; have you.\n&gt;\n&gt; URI parameters have no global meaning, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting.\n\nThat&#39;s not what I&#39;m suggesting --- the mechanism I&#39;m talking about is a way to\ndistinguish otherwise identical parts at some position in the path, i.e. /help;mine\nfrom /help;std etc.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
