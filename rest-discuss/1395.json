Can someone explain what he is saying here?\n &gt; &gt; \n &gt; &gt; &quot;Likewise, the use of cookies to identify a user-specific &#39;shopping\n &gt; &gt; basket&#39; within a server-side database could be more efficiently\n &gt; &gt; implemented by defining the semantics of shopping items within the\n &gt; &gt; hypermedia data formats, allowing the user agent to select and store\n &gt; &gt; those items within their own client-side shopping basket, complete with\n &gt; &gt; a URI to be used for check-out when the client is ready to purchase.&quot;\n &gt; \n &gt; You know that cookies are stateful, right?  That is, they make it so\n &gt; that there isn&#39;t enough information in the HTTP message to understand\n &gt; what it does, because it depends on the information represented by\n &gt; the cookie which is invisible to everybody but the server.\n\nJust a nit. The second part of that sentence is true, but the first\npart is not the issue. Any individual HTTP message need not contain\nthe state, let alone let you understand what it does.  The state\nshould be contained in representations that are accessible via GET (or\nmaybe POST).\n\nCookies are out of band as far as REST is concerned, and are\ndownright anti-REST because you will probably never see the cookie\ncontents but those contents are responsible for a ton of information\ntransfer between client and server. If you moved the cookie info to a\nURI-accessible location, then it would be RESTful. A big issue with\ncurrent practice (not with HTTP or REST) is that usually clients don&#39;t\nhave HTTP servers running in them or on their behalf so the server\ncan&#39;t get at client-side state with a simple GET. (c.f. the\n&quot;client-side shopping basket&quot; statement above). This asymmetry also\nimpacts the ability to do decent asynchronous callbacks from the\nserver to the client.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; So if you wanted to do a shopping basket statelessly, it&#39;s up to the\n &gt; client to manage that the state of the basket, submitting a\n &gt; representation of the basket to the server when it wants to checkout.\n &gt; The local URI would be needed to identify which shopping basket, so that\n &gt; when you opted to put something in the basket, you would do a local POST\n &gt; of the representation of the item to your basket.\n &gt; \n &gt; MB\n &gt; -- \n &gt; Mark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\n &gt; Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\n &gt; http://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n &gt; \n &gt; \n &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n &gt; \n &gt;  \n &gt; \n &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
