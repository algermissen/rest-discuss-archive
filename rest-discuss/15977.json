A pizza parlor wanted its\ncustomers to be able to order pizza for pickup or delivery, from their\nwebsite.  The order page allowed size, style and toppings to be\nselected.  The confirmation page re-stated the order, adding a total.\nCancelling the order returned the customer to the blank order form;\nplacing the order went as follows:\n\nThe customer saw a &#39;thank you&#39; page informing them they would receive\nan &#39;order confirmed&#39; e-mail, and a phone call shortly before the order\nwas ready in the case of a pickup.  This page linked back to the menu.\nThe server, upon receiving a POST of the data in hidden input fields\nfrom the confirmation page, executed a Perl script to convert the name/\nvalue pairs into a human-readable order.\n\nThis order text was then e-mailed to the pizza parlor, where it would\nbe printed out.  The incoming mailbox would only receive from the Perl\nscript, so it would only receive orders, so the printout was automatic,\nas was the autoresponder confirming to the customer that the order was\nreceived by the kitchen, not just the website (by using the customer&#39;s\ne-mail as reply-to).  The frontend customer application was REST.  The\nbackend m2m process was NOT REST.\n\nWhy should it have been?  The need was for reliable messaging that HTTP\ndoesn&#39;t have (if I&#39;d been concerned about message order, then I&#39;d have\nused multipart), and a one-to-one connection rather than HTTP&#39;s one-to-\nmany.  So the correct choice of protocol, then and now, was and is SMTP\nwhich is not a RESTful protocol.  REST is not the solution to all\nproblems in Web services development.\n\nCould another protocol, perhaps HTTP, be used to make this m2m process\nRESTful?  Sure!  But it would be convoluted, so what&#39;s the point?  I&#39;ve\nnever advocated REST for the sake of being RESTful, or bending over\nbackwards to solve a problem with REST that&#39;s better and more easily\nsolved otherwise.  For the pizza problem, REST is only relevant to the\ncustomer interaction.  Applying REST elsewhere may be possible, but if\nthe purpose and benefit of REST is simplicity, such a complex REST\nsolution misses the point of the style completely.\n\nI believe there&#39;s a problem out there, where systems have been designed\nfor SOA and are now converting to ROA as if it&#39;s merely a different\n&quot;serialization,&quot; if you will.  So we see efforts to apply REST to\nproblems that REST isn&#39;t meant to solve, instead of re-architecting\nsystems in terms of problems REST can solve, while recognizing that\nparts of the system are better off being NOT REST.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, saying REST/NOT REST is not a value judgement.  In\nfact, sometimes, for something to be RESTful can be a mistake.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
