E.g. when my book has gone out the door I cannot cancel the order. I have to wait and then send it back.\n\nThat is why there is no undo in accounting. You book something on an account and that&#39;s that. All you can do to fix it is to do a compensating booking the other way round.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; An alternative approach is called provisional-final (among a lot of\n&gt; other names), which is similar to a quote preceding an order: the\n&gt; quote is provisional, the order is final.  If the order never arrives,\n&gt; the quote is not actionable.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first versions of all of the updates are provisional, and then\n&gt; positive state changes messages are PUT or POSTed to make them final\n&gt; or cancel them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can all be done RESTfully (I claim, altho Roy may disagree).\n\nAll that is IMHO beyond REST. It is application semantics.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
