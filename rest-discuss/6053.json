Is the \n&gt; response &quot;relating to the request&quot;?  \n\nNo. As John has so accurately described the response (or the\nrepresentation of the resource) is the _result_ of applying your\nimplementation of f() to the request.\n\n\n&gt; What about a session is not &quot;in the request&quot;?  Certainly the \n&gt; session ID is in the request.  The state of the session is not.  But the \n&gt; state of the resource isn&#39;t in the request either.  So I don&#39;t see your \n&gt; distinction.\n\nBut when you get back the resource you don&#39;t get back the entire state\nof the session.\n\nBut if we&#39;re talking session-less then you make an HTTP request for a\nresource and you get back exactly the representation of the resource\nyou asked for.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; If you look back on the list archives over the last few days you&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; see this point argued through quite comprehensively.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; It hasn&#39;t convinced me.\n\nI haven&#39;t been trying to convince you. I don&#39;t like advocacy. I have\nbeen trying to explain the benefits of REST, particularly cachability.\n\n\nThis point is probably the heart of this argument. Most RESTafrians I\nknow see REST as an architecture that has clear wins and losses. It&#39;s\nnot a religion to me or most of the others I know. \n\nOne big win is the scalability achieved through cachability. One big\nloss is that session less apps seem harder to grasp; probably because\nprogramming in the small (like my earlier JSP example) is so easy to\ndo.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
