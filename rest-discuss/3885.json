Given an\nunderstanding of the web-calculus, the only application\ninformation that needs to be communicated is the structure of the\napplication web.\n\nFor example, the web-calculus specification uses an electronic\ncurrency for its examples. This electronic currency application\ninterface is completely defined by the set of schemas that define\nthe structure of a currency exchange web.
