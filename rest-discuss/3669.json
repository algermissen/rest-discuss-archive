In this case, the user/pwd is\n&gt; little more than a nonce.\n&gt; 2) Generate a unique URL for each individual (likely by adding a nonce to\n&gt; the end of the path), then use the &quot;Content-Location:&quot; header with a\n&gt; single, global URL value.\n&gt; 3) Other thoughts?\n\nIf a resource is subject to access control, representations must\nbe transferred over an encrypted communications channel, such as\nis provided by HTTPS. If HTTPS is used, there will be no shared\ncache. In this case, the only relevant cache is the client&#39;s\npersonal cache. The client&#39;s personal cache can be keyed off the\nclient&#39;s personal URI. This makes option 2 the best choice, with\nno need for setting a global &quot;Content-Location&quot; header.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
