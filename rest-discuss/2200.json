Right now I&#39;m experimenting \nwith holding up an impossibly\n&gt; strict interpretation of REST to see what happens to my \nunderstanding, with apologies\n&gt; to all innocent bystanders.\n\nDon&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just flailing about trying to get unconfused.\nWe&#39;re pretty much in the same boat, trying different ways to \nunderstand what seem to be powerful ideas that are a different from \nwhat (at least I&#39;m) used to.\n\n&gt; On this issue of data-accepting resource types, Mark has created \nthe taxonomy in order\n&gt; to help us understand the range of possible responses w.r.t. \nresource creation and so\n&gt; forth, but there can be no such thing as &quot;knowing a resource is \nthis type or that&quot;, \n\nI thought that&#39;s what RDF was for.\nI also wonder if anybody has bent HTTP Header content-type in this \ndirection?  (Can&#39;t get to Mark&#39;s articles right now to see if he \nmentioned this possibility. I think I remember somebody doing so in a \nprevious message in this list, but can&#39;t find that, either.)\n\n&gt; because\n&gt; the resource is free to handle POST as it sees fit.  In other \nwords, &quot;IdentityPreservingResource&quot;\n&gt; may be what it&#39;s doing sometimes, but it&#39;s not a contract with \nyou.  At least that&#39;s the\n&gt; understanding I&#39;ve come away with.\n\nI want to be able to negotiate legally binding contracts \nelectronically.  I am sure it is possible to do that.\nIt requires some kind of predictability of response.\nIt might be predictability of the same type as Mark describes on ws-\narch for getting reliable coordination without reliable messaging.\n\n&gt; I thought the only (minor) slip in your description of the POST \nwhere a sub-resource is\n&gt; created is that you say the client can *request* creation (or \nexpect creation).  You can expect\n&gt; whatever you want, but as I said there&#39;s no contract*.  And you&#39;re \nnot really requesting that\n&gt; a resource be created.  You&#39;re trusting the wizard (behind the \nresource curtain) to do the right\n&gt; thing.\n\nI want a contract.  I don&#39;t need to start with a contract.\nI expect some kind of predictability to emerge from conversation.\nI think it will involve stereotyped conversational patterns.\nI think they can be described via RDF or XML.\n\n&gt; * I guess you could negotiate a contract like this, but what I \nmeant is that it&#39;s not REST\n&gt; or HTTP baseline stuff.\n\nI expect it will require something like an RDF contract for \nconversational behavior, which could also be a REST resource.\n\n&gt; PS - thanks for trying to understand my esoteric ramblings, and \nyes, every bit does help.\n\nI appreciate your ramblings because I sense that you are another \nperson who is honestly trying to get it.  If we can help each other, \nI&#39;m happy.  If we just confuse each other more, well, par for the \ncourse I guess, and we&#39;ll get over it.\n\n-Bob\n\n\n"}}
