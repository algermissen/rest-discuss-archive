Replace REST with SOAP in the last sentence, and what do you\nhave?  Put another way, is\n&gt; there a meaningful non-HTTP implementation of REST out in the wild?\n&gt; Sorry, but I really tripped on this statement.  Would anybody care to\nexpand on it?\n\nI think of SQL based systems as something with a lot of REST-like qualities.\nThey are much better at the jobs they were designed for than a REST based\nsystem, but REST is better at jobs /it/ was designed for.\n\n\n"}}
