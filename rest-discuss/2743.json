Why not copy?\nYes, I think that would work.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; c) new method (TURN or something)\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that there is a need for it.\n\nI think maybe a &#39;PROXY&#39; method (requesting that the server begin acting as a\ntype of proxy) might make sense.\nIf CONNECT has a way to advertise what particular protocol will be\n&#39;tunnelled&#39; - like &quot;HTTP-Reverse/1.1&quot; - then proxies will still be able to\nparticipate (caching, cache purging, etc.). Although I don&#39;t really care if\nproxies are involved.\n\nI see two scenarios for this technology -\na) expose private machine on public Web\nthe private machine wants to be public but can&#39;t accept incoming connections\nso the public machine proxies that job\nUseful for dynamic IP allocation, either due to ISP allocated addresses or\nthrough &#39;nomadic/mobile&#39; use. Other approaches like dyndns.org may solve the\nhost/ip mapping issue, but not incoming connection issues.\nThis turns the client into a server - which means you need more security and\neither multiple connections or multiplexing messages on a single connection.\n\nb) low-latency application messaging\nwhere a private machine just wants low-latency messages to an application\nbut can&#39;t accept incoming connections.\nThis may be useful for smaller devices - the public machine can do all the\nsecurity, high-level policy stuff and connection management, and the small\ndevice can stay simple.\n\n\n\nI do not want to &#39;tunnel&#39; stuff through a firewall - I&#39;m not into smuggling\ninformation. Either you are the firewall admin & can open up the port, or\nyou are not the admin and you /shouldn&#39;t/ open up the port. The third\nalternative is that the firewall admin doesn&#39;t care to let you listen - like\nan ISP that restricts incoming requests. This situation would benefit from a\ngeneric &#39;reverse http connector&#39; - like an Apache mod (or hack) that did the\nproper socket management.\n\n\n\n"}}
