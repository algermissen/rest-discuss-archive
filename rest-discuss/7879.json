It&#39;s difficult to say that about SOA.\n&gt; \n&gt; yeah, I&#39;m not speaking in favour of SOA, just that REST\n&gt; could be a little more concrete. OK not REST, but I&#39;d\n&gt; like some more concrete to point at and advise people\n&gt; to emulate.\n\nBuild a RESTful standard. Build tests for it. You&#39;ve now got testable \nREST and the rest of us can choose to use it or not.\n\n&gt;&gt; Then again is this really a useful way to speak - I could\n&gt;&gt; say &quot;what worries me about\n&gt;&gt; design patterns is that they aren&#39;t testable&quot;\n&gt;&gt; - but what would that mean?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s fair comment, but if you use a framework (Hmm. is it a\n&gt; framework, dunno) such as JSR 311, then chances\n&gt; are you&#39;re going to expose your service RESTfully, and\n&gt; that can only be goodness.\n\nDepends on how much freedom it gives you. You could say we&#39;ve a (fairly) \nRESTful (and testable) framework in RFC 2616 and the various tools that \nuse it (browsers, servers, server-side scripting languages, XMLHTTP, et \nal). You could argue that these give you too much freedom and hence its \npossible to not behave RESTfully with them (though experience shows that \nthose with the least freedom tend to actually force you to be unRESTful \nrather than to be RESTful).\n\nPersonally I don&#39;t give a damn about testability of REST. I am a big fan \nof REST (evangelical even) but I will personally break every single \nprinciple of REST to get a job done. The reason I generally don&#39;t is \nthat those principles give me real benefits. *THAT* is testable.\n\nDon&#39;t test REST, test its results.\n\n\n"}}
