IOW, here is one URL w/conneg:\n&gt; \n&gt; \thttp://example.com/myphoto.img  \n&gt; \n&gt; And here are others w/o:\n&gt; \n&gt; \thttp://example.com/myphoto.gif\n&gt;   \thttp://example.com/myphoto.jpg  \n&gt;   \thttp://example.com/myphoto.png\n\n\nhttp://example.com/myphoto.gif may not be the same resource as \nhttp://example.com/myphoto.jpg. One would have to assume they were \ndifferent resources unless told otherwise (by some mechanism).\n\nIf they were the same resource one could merrily use either URI. This is \nnot the case here.\n\nI think it&#39;s perfectly accept able to have http://example.com/doc return \nFrench and English versions based on conneg and to contain links like &lt;a \nhref=&quot;doc.en&quot;&gt;English Version&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;doc.fr&quot;&gt;Version Fran√ßais&lt;/a&gt; but:\n\n1. That does not make the linking an alternative to con-neg. It solves a \ndifferent problem. Con-neg solves the problem of getting a usable \nrepresentation to the client. Explicit linking to alternatives solves \nthe problem of getting a particular representation to a client that has \na reason to want that particular representation through defining related \nresources which reflect those representations.\n2. It is not applicable to the case of content-type unless all of the \ncontent-types are hypermedia formats. There is no way for .gif to \nindicate it has a .png alternative.\n\n\n"}}
