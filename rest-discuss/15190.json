The concept of Uniform Interface is =\r\none that is not REST property. The implementation of it defined in REST inc=\r\nludes the four restrictions: \n- identification of resources \n- manipulation=\r\n of resources through representations \n- self-descriptive messages \n- hyper=\r\nmedia as the engine of application state\n\nMainly, all of these are designed=\r\n from the resources point of view, not the protocols. The last one imposes =\r\ntechnology, to support the REST final implementation, that is the Web.\n\nNot=\r\nhing there about protocols, just about the resource.\nFielding states this i=\r\nn the rant:\n&quot;A REST API should not be dependent on any single communication=\r\n protocol, though its successful mapping to a given protocol may be depende=\r\nnt on the availability of metadata, choice of methods, etc.&quot;\n\nSo, the API i=\r\ns defined with the resource. The user agent may select any protocol to use,=\r\n depending on the protocols supported by servers and the protocols semantic=\r\ns in the operations. YOu should not change the protocol semantics to fit yo=\r\nur needs. YOu may have protocols that are not suitable for what you need, t=\r\nhen you should either adjust your resource semantics, or choose another pro=\r\ntocols. \n\nIn that case, Mike is right in terms of having different protocol=\r\ns for one client, where that client may require some operation not possible=\r\n with another protocol. \n\nAntonio&#39;s approach is one happy solution to expan=\r\ndability. Your client may not know or cannot use one protocol, or you resou=\r\nrce semantics are a perfect fit for one particular protocol, any other comb=\r\nination of protocols may require mapping. Thus, you create one resource def=\r\ninition for one protocol, and the create adapters for other clients using o=\r\nther protocols. That is a great idea, but be clear on a couple of things:\n1=\r\n. The REST API ends in the main protocol. The adapter layer is not part of =\r\nAPI. The direct clients of the REST api are the adapters.\n2. You may be int=\r\nroducing much impedance mismatch since the protocol semantics are sooo diff=\r\nerent. Or you are just tweaking the semantics of the secondary protocol to =\r\nmean something different, which is possible but may not be as good.\n\nCheers=\r\n!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares  \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Ant=F3n=\r\nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2010/4/7 mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n As regards the multi-protocol idea, there could be:\n&gt; &gt; - mixed (some acti=\r\nons w/ one protocol, some actions with another protocol)\n&gt; &gt; - side-by-side=\r\n (all actions supported by all adopted protocols)\n&gt; &gt;  - and possibly other=\r\n ways to view this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will say again that the notion of &quot;protocol a=\r\ngnostic&quot; is my point here. I\n&gt; &gt; meant to make no claim of the need or valu=\r\ne of a &quot;multi-protocol&quot;\n&gt; &gt; implementation when designing a media-type, jus=\r\nt that it was a possibility\n&gt; &gt; left open to *implementors* using the media=\r\n-type.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes, I understand that. And I guess I&#39;m digressing to othe=\r\nr areas beside\n&gt; your blog post. But then again...\n&gt; \n&gt; You wrote:\n&gt; &quot;when =\r\ni need to come up w/ a protocol-specific implementation of my media\n&gt; type.=\r\n &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So your media type *definition* is protocol agnostic but not your a=\r\nctual,\n&gt; usable media types - the implementations you mention. They are ind=\r\need\n&gt; protocol-specific. Meaning a effort in implementation and, worse, a\n&gt;=\r\n maintenance effort that maybe neglectable with 2 protocols, but imagine wi=\r\nth\n&gt; 4 or 5 or 6, multiplying by even only half-dozen media-types...\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nnd what I argue is, if we take away the task of mapping &quot;application\n&gt; unif=\r\norm interface&quot; with &quot;protocol interface&quot; away from the media-types and\n&gt; pu=\r\nt that directly at the architecture definition we avoid all that effort,\n&gt; =\r\nand all the implementation work will be concentrated on the specific\n&gt; prot=\r\nocol connectors (when I say connectors I always referring to server-side\n&gt; =\r\nconnectors, not client-side). The effort will be the same for 1, 2, 10, 100=\r\n\n&gt; media-types...\n&gt; \n&gt; And I promise not digress again...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
