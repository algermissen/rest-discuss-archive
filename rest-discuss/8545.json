Assume we have a Resource R.  R can transition through a number of states.  Let&#39;s say the states are S1, S2, S3, and S4.  Outside clients can only directly initiate transitions from S1 to S4 and from S4 to S1.   As a result of initiating a transition from S1 to S4, R will pass through S2 on the way to S4.  As a result of initiating a transition from S4 to S1, R will pass through S3 on the way to S1.  A client can sample R at any time and see the state of R in any of the states S1, S2, S3, and S4.\n&gt;\n&gt; Without being RPCish, I&#39;m having a difficult time imagining how to structure URIs that allow a client to transition R from S1 to S4 and S4 to S1.  For example I could imagine a GET to R returning something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;R&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;State&gt;S1&lt;/State&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/R&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I can imagine a client performing a PUT to R/State, changing its value to S4.  This doesn&#39;t feel right because a subsequent GET might result in the client seeing &lt;State&gt;S2&lt;/State&gt;.  This might be confusing as the PUT returned good status, yet the client doesn&#39;t see S4 in the State element.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t understand why the server is stuck in S2 in your example. But\nif you are saying that the legal transition from S1 was to S2, then\nyou left something out of your hypertext in the &quot;GET from R&quot; :\n\n&lt;form action=&quot;transition-to-s2&quot; method=&quot;put&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;new-state&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n(with liberties from html5). Now clients can only do that one legal\nstate transition.\n\nForms are an essential part of the web, but not necessarily of the\nREST style. There is probably a way you could accomplish the same\nthing my minting MIME types, using the ACCEPT header, etc.\n\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
