Do I \nstill promote Basic Auth + SSL as the preferred authentication \nmechanism?  Has Amazon&#39;s Token based protocol gained any traction?  Any \nother protocol gaining a lot of traction?\n\nAs one of the companies/people evangelizing REST in the Java community I \ndo worry Basic Auth will be a huge speed bump (I have no problem with, \nbut I know potential recruits will.).\n\nAnother thing I worry about is some of the things Gunnar talks about in \nhis series of blogs:  Protecting the message from message routers.  I&#39;ve \nalso been pushing hard at JBoss to get REST over HTTP as a unifying \nprotocol and architectural design for our ESB and issues like this will \nstart to crop up as I re-educate (brainwash?) our people.\n\nFinally, I&#39;m looking for new security options to implement and promote.\n\nSorry this is so broad and open ended.  I&#39;m just looking for pointers to \nnarrow my search.\n\nThanks,\n\nBill\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
