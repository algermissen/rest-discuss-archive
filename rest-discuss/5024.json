Neither can damage my \nresources without my saying so, I&#39;m in control.\n\nPUT and DELETE (and POST(a)) on the other hand work directly on \nresources, I don&#39;t want a dumb generic client like a Web browser messing \nabout with my resources directly, I don&#39;t know what damage it might \ncause. I want to open up my resources to allow manipulation via PUT and \nDELETE, but only by clients I can full control and trust to not destroy \nmy resources.\n\nIf I wrote a specific Web client for my Web app then I&#39;d trust it to \nbehave and allow it to PUT and DELETE, but HTML is really a document \nmarkup format and not an application GUI format and HTML browsers are \ndocument viewers not generic application clients, so I think the HTML \nspec is sensible when it only allows GET and POST methods from HTML forms.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m not thinking hard enough about this, or maybe too hard. Maybe \nPUT and DELETE from HTML forms would be useful and wouldn&#39;t undermine \nwhat HTML is all about, maybe not, I think this issue needs a lot of \ncareful thinking before people rush in and extend HTML forms in this way.\n\nPaul.\n\nRyan Tomayko wrote:\n&gt; On May 7, 2005, at 2:42 AM, Vincent D Murphy wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; On Fri, 06 May 2005 15:26:00 -0700, &quot;Elias Sinderson&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;elias@...&gt; said:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; the ones who are abusing GET are actually the developers who \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; insist on\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; perverting the sematics of a perfecftly well defined method.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Its embarassing to tell people how great REST/HTTP is, and then have\n&gt;  &gt; to go through a workaround because of HTML.

Does anyone know off hand whether WHAT-\n&gt; WG or other improve-HTML initiative has PUT/DELETE for forms and/or \n&gt; some kind of proposal for using verbs correctly for common cases like \n&gt; this on their radar? Has anyone even informally proposed potential \n&gt; spec enhancements that would provide this kind of functionality? I&#39;ll \n&gt; go dig and see what I can find out...\n&gt; \n&gt; Ryan\n\r\n\n"}}
