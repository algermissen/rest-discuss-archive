So they basically describe the document that can be returned, and each element within it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe you can shed some light on the media type thing. That stills confuses me a bit. I read somewhere that for my java/jersey rest services, I should support a media type like vnd+com.mypackage.myclass+xml and so on. Should each and every method I support for each URL have a specific media type?\n\nHuh? No, why do you think so? Just ask yourself:\n\nWhen I receive a response of type application/opensearchdescription+xml what possibilities are there for next state transitions? Hint: look at the spec of that media type.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen a few posts now saying it&#39;s all about the media types. Ok.. what does that mean exactly? From the media type can you determine what to call on it?\n\nExacty. How does your browser implementor know, what to do and what the method is if a user clicks on an &lt;a&gt; link? How does she know what to do and what the method is in the case of an HTML &lt;form&gt; submission? Check the section &quot;Protocol Operations&quot; in RFC5023 (AtomPub).\n\n&gt; In other words, should I have a specific media type specified for a given resource that handles a POST for a single item, and a different media type for a POST that handles multiple items (for example, posting a new item to a web cart, or posting the entire web cart at one shot to &quot;check out&quot;)?\n\nThe media type does not describe the resource of the next request. It just describes how to interprete the representation that the client holds *now*. The meaning of the links is what is being described.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Along the same lines, the OpenSearch seems to be a single resource.\n\n??? That sentence does not make sense.\n\n&gt; So I suppose I would have a document for each resource that indicates the elements that can come back in a response..\n\n&gt; and in some cases some elements may not be part of the response. In the case of one resource call that responds with a URI to another resource, that would be documented in some manner as well... not sure how exactly.\n\nAgain, look at AtomPub &lt;service&gt; documents and Opensearch description (not the search result) documents. What do they tell you?\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 2/21/10, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] How do I help developers get started using my HATEOAS API?\n&gt; To: &quot;Kevin Duffey&quot; &lt;andjarnic@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, February 21, 2010, 3:06 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Feb 21, 2010, at 11:32 PM, Kevin Duffey wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am looking to start messing around with HATEOAS a bit more with my java/jersey stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Funny, I am just reading this[1] post about the hypermedia constraint, maybe that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not quite sure I understand the flow of things tho. If I publish a URI to my service I have something likehttp://myservice.com/webcart as the URI. What is the first call done..\n&gt; \n&gt; It is always a GET on the URI of the entry URI the client has. This will bring the client into the corresponding entry state. Note that there might be more entry states, there is no need to limit that to a single one. In fact, any bookmarkable state can be considered an entry state. For example, when you are being sent a link to a book on Amazon, you GET it with your browser and you are right in an entry state of the Amazon shopping application.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; a GET or an OPTION in order to get the possible URIs to call next?\n&gt; \n&gt; The next possible states will always be in your current state in the form of hypermedia constrols (links, forms). When the client understands (==implements) the media type it will understand the meaning of these transitions. (If it doesn&#39;t it&#39;ll have to give up or try something else).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am trying to figure out how I start up my service SDK that I&#39;ll publish on my site to help developers get started using my public service.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do not hide the HTTP interface inside an SDK. This will only obfuscate the essence of the hypermedia constraint. Specifiy your media type or media type extensions (reuse standard types as much as possible of course) and that is all the client developer needs to know.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regardless.. I assume the response would be some sort of list of links that can be called?\n&gt; \n&gt; Do not approach this too &#39;technically&#39;. The links can be anywhere in your hypermedia. They could be plain text, XML elements, generic link elements or forms (or take some exotic form [2])\n&gt; Have a look at OpenSearch[1] or AtomPub (RFC5023) for &#39;learning&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was originally turned on to this notion of using something like as a response body:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;links&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;link rel=&quot;self&quot; href=&quot;http://myservice.com&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;link rel=&quot;edit&quot; href=&quot;http://myservice.com&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/links&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Can be like this, but absolutely need not be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not quite sure tho how to specify this in the response. I know some are talking about using the Links header..but from what I gather it&#39;s not going to be standard until HTML5, which who knows when that will come out.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Link header is orthogonal to HTML5. Consider it standard right now. It has already been in an earlier ersion of HTTP, too)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As well, I am not quite sure how you specify the methods that can be used..\n&gt; \n&gt; Write it up in the specification of your hypermedia controls (See my last posting on that, too).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Does my SDK doc say &quot;if rel is EDIT then you can PUT to that URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but not your SDK doc but the media type (or link relation-) specification. Just like HTML does for &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt; or &lt;form&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If it is SELF then you can only GET to that URI&quot;? or is there another attribute that lists the allowed methods on the URI of each link? I guess I am looking for a little help in understanding how best to describe this HATEOAS API to other developers that will consume it.. how to get them started, and how to explain each URI they can use at any given point and what methods they can use on the URI, what params, what body, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just do the equivalent of AtomPub or OpenSearch for what you need your service to enable.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the case of a DELETE, if it succeeds.. it returns a 204 No Content.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe. Or a 303 See other, or a 202 Accepted ...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How then do you respond with any sort of links that it can do at that point? If it can&#39;t return any body, I can&#39;t return any &lt;links&gt; with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right. The point you are (correctly) making here is what to consider the steady state after a 204. My personal opinion is that the steady state remains the one you were in before. If that had changed, the server should have sent you a 303 See Other to reload that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; (There is a lot to be leveraged from the HTTP codes themselves!)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think we &quot;can&quot; fudge it.. but then I would guess it wouldn&#39;t be RESTful to provide any sort of body with a No Content response. Maybe Delete doesn&#39;t have to return 204 to indicate a success?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what are you all that have provided a HATEOAS API been doing?\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy your travel towards the next hypermedia constraint[4] &#39;aha-moment&#39;.
