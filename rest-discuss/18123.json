First my ass=\r\numption:\n&gt; People don&#39;t get REST, because one of the main ideas is that you=\r\n need common \n&gt; standard media types for REST. But people don&#39;t know about =\r\nmedia types.\n\nYeah - you nailed it. The whole idea that media types are **t=\r\nhe only** contract (besides URI, HTTP,..) in RESTful systems has completely=\r\n, absolutely not made it into the current REST-hype bandwagon. Neither has =\r\nthe fact that designing media types is consequently *the* design activity t=\r\no engage in when doing RESTful systems design.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve done web sites for =\r\n6 years but only now, while doing research for my \n&gt; bachelor thesis, I dis=\r\ncovered how many great media types are there and could \n&gt; be reused.\n\nYes, =\r\nI know that feeling. HTTP & friends are a bit like SQL: You *think* pretty =\r\nsoon that you know what you are doing only to discover years down the line =\r\nwhat a complete fool you have been (at least that was my experience a decad=\r\ne ago).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And there is no advertisement for good media types. Where can=\r\n I go and browse \n&gt; / search / filter a list of media types and look whethe=\r\nr there is already \n&gt; something registered for my need?\n\nThe best ones to l=\r\nook at are the ones around OpenSearch and AtomPub because they give you an =\r\nidea how to incorporate machine-to-machine interaction aspects into media t=\r\nypes. The HTML spec is also pretty worth a look since there are extremely i=\r\nnteresting details around image maps (you know, where the browser is told t=\r\no append x and y params and forms processing.\n\nNewsML 2 (I think media type=\r\n standardization has just begun) has some aspects regarding control of cons=\r\numer systems (e.g. a news provider can tell a news consumer to withdraw a n=\r\news item - you could leverage such stuff between systems such as inventory =\r\nand online shop, for example)\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas Koch, =\r\nhttp://www.koch.ro\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
