Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Eb wrote:\n&gt;    \n&gt;&gt; If HTTP is being used, there is conclusion that can be arrived that\n&gt;&gt; says that for your app to be RESTful, its types must be registered in\n&gt;&gt; IANA.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; Exactly.  REST requires standardized types.  HTTP defines a\n&gt; standardized type as having an entry in the IANA registry.  REST\n&gt; requires self-descriptive messaging, defined as having a registered\n&gt; identifier.  HTTP only defines the IANA registry.  Therefore, while\n&gt; REST in general says nothing about IANA-registered MIME types, it does\n&gt; require them in any HTTP instantiation of REST, which is of vital\n&gt; importance when developing for the &quot;common case&quot; of the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am being RESTful in my re-use of the XBEL standard to serve a\n&gt; standalone blogroll.  Unfortunately, that standard has no registered\n&gt; identifier.  Therefore, as there exists no other mechanism besides the\n&gt; IANA registry to self-descriptively indicate to the world that I&#39;m\n&gt; using the XBEL standard, my messaging is NOT self-descriptive when I\n&gt; serve XBEL -- my choices are the opaque string application/xbel+xml or\n&gt; the not-self-descriptive application/xml.  I choose the former.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is absolutely a REST mismatch, but hardly an insoluble problem.\n&gt; Once I&#39;ve taken the trouble to register the identifier, serving XBEL\n&gt; will no longer be a REST mismatch, with no changes to my system\n&gt; required.  Until such registration is approved, however, my messaging\n&gt; can&#39;t be considered self-descriptive because my identifier is opaque,\n&gt; and this carries with it the real-world consequence of having such\n&gt; messages ignored (beyond being routed) by the deployed infrastructure\n&gt; of the Web -- obvious proof that it isn&#39;t RESTful, by definition.\n&gt;\n&gt; So my choice of XBEL clearly incurs costs (i.e. marshalling a new\n&gt; standardization effort around XBEL to assign it both a media type\n&gt; identifier and an XML namespace identifier) which I avoided entirely\n&gt; when I was using HTML to mark up my blogroll.  After registration of an\n&gt; identifier is approved, any benefit from my choice as compared to when\n&gt; I was using HTML is dependent on uptake (Roy&#39;s &quot;gray area of increasing\n&gt; RESTfulness&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; Which I assume there will be, because the ubiquity of XBEL in many\n&gt; browsers as well as a plethora of online bookmark-organizing-and-\n&gt; sharing services means that XBEL&#39;s processing model is already widely\n&gt; understood.  I simply lack any means of specifying that processing\n&gt; model over-the-wire, i.e. in a Content-Type HTTP header, which is\n&gt; absolutely a fundamental requirement of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; If serving a standardized type like XBEL over HTTP can&#39;t be self-\n&gt; descriptive because there&#39;s no registered identifier, then how can any\n&gt; nonstandardized type with no registered identifier be self-descriptive?\n&gt; How can such a nonstandardized type be considered RESTful, even if it\n&gt; is given a registered identifier to make it at least self-descriptive?\n&gt; Standardization is central to the concept of a uniform interface,\n&gt; network-based API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Use of data types for which standardization is never intended, is some\n&gt; other architecture I&#39;m not familiar with, and all I require from those\n&gt; advocating such solutions is a point-by-point rebuttal of Roy&#39;s thesis.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;    \nIf this is the case, I don&#39;t see why the requirement would change for \nREST behind the firewall (if HTTP is being used).  That is, as long as \nHTTP is being used (wherever), IANA registration is required.\n\nEb\n\n-- \nblog: http://eikonne.wordpress.com\ntwitter: http://twitter.com/eikonne\n\n\n"}}
