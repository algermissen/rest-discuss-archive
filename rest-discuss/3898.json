Wh=\r\ny can&#39;t a message\n&gt; &gt; resource be &quot;subordinate&quot; to an index resource?\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\nothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources. You\ncan\n&gt;=\r\n PUT a message somewhere else and then updating the index. You can add\nan\n&gt;=\r\n entry to the index for a URL that does not currently resolve. In\ncontrast,=\r\n\n&gt; the only way to add a message to a container is... to add a message to\na=\r\n\n&gt; container, making the message subordinate to the container. Indexes\ndon&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; imply subordination. Containership does.\n\nOkay, you&#39;re using &quot;container=\r\n&quot; as distinct from, say, &quot;collection&quot; in\nWebDAV.\n\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s how directorie=\r\ns work, right?  If I GET a directory, I expect\na\n&gt; &gt; hyperlinked list of it=\r\ns contents, not all the contents together in\nan\n&gt; &gt; archive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since HTTP=\r\n URLs are hierarchical, an enumeration of all subordinate\nURLs\n&gt; is suffici=\r\nent to communicate &quot;whatever information&quot; the directory URI\n&gt; designates.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Notably, because indexes don&#39;t themselves imply subordination of\nindexed=\r\n\n&gt; resources, you can&#39;t take an index to imply that you add a file to a\n&gt; d=\r\nirectory by POSTing to it. To get an entry to appear in the index,\nyou\n&gt; mu=\r\nst put a corresponding file in the directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you can view my object=\r\nion to POSTing to Yannicks message indexes as\n&gt; equivalent to objecting to =\r\nPOSTing to directory URLs. The semantics\njust\n&gt; aren&#39;t there to do it.\n\nHTT=\r\nP still leaves POST pretty open. As Yannick just quoted, RFC 2616\nsays,\n&quot;Th=\r\ne posted entity is subordinate to that URI in the same way that *a\nfile\nis =\r\nsubordinate to a directory containing it*, a news article is\nsubordinate\nto=\r\n a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a\ndatabas=\r\ne&quot; (emphasis mine). But you&#39;re right that I wouldn&#39;t think of\nPOSTing\na fil=\r\ne to a directory.\n\nJustin S.\n\n"}}
