The verbs you \n&gt; can do on resources over HTTP are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The way \n&gt; you call arbitrary &quot;methods&quot; on a resource is by POSTing to it, and \n&gt; including in the post data information about what to do. For example, \n&gt; you could have a URI representing your robot resource. Doing a GET of \n&gt; that URI could return some robot status information. You could POST to \n&gt; the robot URI and include in the post data a key &quot;command&quot; with the \n&gt; value &quot;ringDoorbell.&quot; That is analogous to invoking ringDoorbell() on \n&gt; a Robot object, in an object-oriented program or distributed RPC \n&gt; system. A robot resource could expose any number of &quot;methods&quot; this way \n&gt; to HTTP clients.\n&gt;\nWhich is pretty much how REST&#39;s arch-enemy, SOAP, does things.  Except \nClaude has done it better - because you can not only send an \nencapsulated command, you can check on its status.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
