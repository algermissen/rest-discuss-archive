Hummm. Ok, =\r\nREST is not a protocol, it is an architectural style. If you mean HTTP, goo=\r\nd, still HTTP is not &quot;the&quot; rest protocol, it is the protocol for hypermedia=\r\n transfer and the actual de facto standard when creating REST things.\n\n2. R=\r\nEST is a style for the web. By creating an application in the web, you are =\r\nnot creating a &quot;REST architected&quot; application automatically. You should dec=\r\nide if the constrains and benefits of using REST will fit your needs.\n\n3. I=\r\ndempotency. Not sure of the word, but an operation is idempotent when the f=\r\ninal state is the same after executing the operation several times. If you =\r\nissue the get the first time, and the user is ends up active, there is no p=\r\nroblem if the second time the user is still active. See?\n\n4. Now, GET shoul=\r\nd not be used to change state, granted. Actually, what you are doing is rea=\r\nding the URL for a key and validating that key is related to the user at ha=\r\nnd, right? Then what you are abusing is the actual GET semantic. Adding pos=\r\nts or other code into the email will make it unsecure, and probably will no=\r\nt work with antivirus and spam things.\nSo, a proposed way is to add that ke=\r\ny as plain as it is, with no URL in the email, and direct the user to a pag=\r\ne where the ID is to be written manually. You can even set a procedure wher=\r\ne the user only enters the email, and upon reception of the key, he can ent=\r\ner and add all other info. That avoids you capturing all his info and in th=\r\ne case the user does not confirm, his info will stay there. \n\nHopes this he=\r\nlps!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Felip=\r\ne Ga=FAcho &lt;fgaucho@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt; \n&gt; my first email here...\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; question: I have a registration flow that includes the following steps:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) client send a POST with the new user&#39;s data.\n&gt; 2) the server sends=\r\n an email to the new user containing  a &quot;Confirmation URL&quot;\n&gt; 3) the user cl=\r\nicks on the URL, confirming his registration request...\n&gt; \n&gt; So far so good=\r\n, the basics of a registration use case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the question:\n&gt; \n&gt; The UR=\r\nL in the email should be a GET, right ? (otherwise I am not sure\n&gt; how it c=\r\nan work from an email.. )\n&gt; \n&gt; but, if I use GET to transform the state of =\r\na resource in the server I\n&gt; am abusing the rest protocol - (GET not-idempo=\r\ntent since the status of\n&gt; the user will change from NEW to ACTIVE)\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n, what is the alternative ?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
