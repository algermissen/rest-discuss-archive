So, is &quot;Current Location of requesting user&quot; a \n&gt; valid resource retrievable via HTTP?  I think the answer is a \n&gt; noncontroversial yes, but wanted to double check before asking the followup:\n\nA controversial &quot;yes, but&quot; from me.\n\nIf you indicate the resource will change on the bases of the \nAuthorization header with Vary: Authorization and add a bit of caution \nin how you allow it to be cached (i.e. you don&#39;t) because that may catch \nout some caches in practice, then fine.\n\nThe &quot;but&quot;:\n\nIn practice it will probably be more performant and reliable if this is \ndone by having a bunch of resources for each user (which only that user \n- and perhaps admins or other users who would have a reason to look at \nthem in a different context - can access) and the &quot;current location&quot; \nresource redirected to this through a 303 (303 because that is the \ncleanest choice for when the target exists in its own right as a \nseparate resource).\n\nThe &quot;controversial&quot;:\n\nI know that others have disagreed with me on this issue in the past.\n\n&gt; (2) Is it allowable for the Allow: header to reflect the metadata about \n&gt; what operations the requesting user can perform on the resource?\n\nThis isn&#39;t entirely clear to me. However if you have a resource per user \nas I suggest above and all users can either do GET, POST and PUT on it \nor else do nothing, then you can statically but those in an allow header \nand the user in question will get that response while others get a 401.\n\n\n"}}
