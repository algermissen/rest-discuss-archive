You mean that a\n&gt; client which wishes to receive events must connect to a presence server a la\n&gt; KnowNow?  That is a non-starter.  No chance.  The resources are right there on\n&gt; the client.  You mean that if the accounting web server wants to send an event\n&gt; to Joe the Accountant in the next cube they have to rendezvous at the KN router\n&gt; in California?\n\nI cannot stress to you strongly enough that any *other* approach --- such as getting\nadministrators to explicitly configure a firewall to allow your new PSP callback\nprotocol through --- is an absolute non-starter.  This isn&#39;t speculation, this is\nhard-won experience.  We tried it.  It did not work.  We beat our heads against this\nat Activerse for a *long* time.  Unfortunately, protocol evolution effectively ended\nwith HTTP, and indeed the whole notion of the TCP service &lt;--&gt; port address space is\neffectively on the way out.  Today we have to deal with a single protocol on a\nsingle port and we have to deal with asymmetrical connectivity as a result of\nfirewalls.  Fortunately, that&#39;s okay, because we can (a) build any application we\nwant using HTTP, and (b) address asymmetry though principled and compatible\nextensions of the REST architecture that simply build on what we&#39;ve already got.\n\nIf you want to pursue some other course, feel free to.  You may get some uptake in\nsituations where you don&#39;t have to deal with firewalls, but in the enterprise you\nwill gain no traction whatsoever if you require the network admins to touch their\nexisting firewall configurations.  Ultimately, you&#39;re going to have to burrow out\nthrough port 80 to something that is effectively a rendezvous server.  Having been\ndown the losing path once before, I&#39;m in favor of just skipping that frustrating and\nfruitless exploration this time around and just figuring out how to tunnel while\npreserving the end-to-end semantics of HTTP 1.1.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
