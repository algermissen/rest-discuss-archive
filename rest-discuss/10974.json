If the origin server happens to have the copy\n&gt; internally it can do something clever, but the interface doesn&#39;t assume\n&gt; the data is local to that server.\n&gt; \n&gt; The client also doesn&#39;t tell the server what the destination URI is,\n&gt; which is a problem with WebDAV COPY as far as AtomPub goes. Hence the\n&gt; override method is X-CLONE not COPY. X-RELOCATE would be the option to\n&gt; have the old URI removed as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The responses would be 201 Created + Location as per AtomPub; ie the\n&gt; collection should issue a URL immediately so the client is released. But\n&gt; maybe 202 accepted + Location would be more explicit.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the copy operation is ongoing in the the background, GETs to the URL\n&gt; can return 503 Service Unavailable and a Retry-After. If for some reason\n&gt; the op failed, 410 Gone can be returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; One issue is that the client didn&#39;t sent any authorization to the\n&gt; collection that allows it to fetch the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; ...\n\nI think it would be better to extend COPY accordingly.\n\nOh wait, Microsoft already did (I think for Exchange)... if you&#39;re \ninterested, I can try to locate the description on MSDN.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
