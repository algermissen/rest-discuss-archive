Any good tools out there that are simple, but allow you to \n&gt; issue HTTP POST/PUT/DELETEs easily?  Or have you written your own \n&gt; testing framework/tools or custom HTML pages to do this when you are \n&gt; testing your invocations?\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate any insight...\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Andrzej\n\nI&#39;m usually testing (my WebDAV server code) with non-interactive \nclients, but if you need to, you can use *any* method name through \nclient-side scripting in &quot;both&quot; Internet Explorer and Mozilla/Firefox \n(see &lt;http://www.mozilla.org/xmlextras/&gt;).\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n-- \n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n"}}
