Caching\n&gt;  &gt; and content negotiation can still apply here.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; why do that? Well, loose coupling of code turns out to be a good idea all round\n&gt;\n&gt;  While that might be a good idea, I notice that the thesis is dominated by a\n&gt;  discussion of network-based architecture.  Chapters 2 and 3 are titled\n&gt;  &quot;Network-based Application Architectures&quot; and &quot;Network-based Architectural\n&gt;  style&quot;.  The first non-Null constraint is Client-Server (not &quot;Model-View&quot; or\n&gt;  &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;), which is inherently a network-based term.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Some of the tradeoffs described in the style (optimizing for coarse-grained\n&gt;  transfer stands out) are in terms of network latency and overhead, factors\n&gt;  that don&#39;t exist in local and especially intra-VM exchanges.\n\n-If you&#39;ve ever spent time with intra-process communications using\nCOM, you&#39;d see that latency can still be an issue. The time taken to\nmarshall and send a message across processes (including scheduling the\ndestination process and working on the response) is still many tens to\nhundreds of times slower than in-process communications. Even\nin-process messaging is slow if you have to convert everything into\nsome serialized form, be it XML, Serialize java objects, etc.\n\n-What you dont get on a single machine is all the obscure failure\nmodes of distributed systems\n\n-In theory, it is easier to keep all the code on a single machine (or\neven a managed cluster of boxes) in sync, so that you can have custom\ninterfaces that you upgrade across the machine/cluster, so that you\ncan  change the wire format of serialized objects without problems.\nCertainly we happily use Java RMI between VMs, between nodes in the\nfarm, without version problems. But even there, the cost of rolling\nout an upgrade can be steep. Change an interface and you need to\nrebuild everything, relink things, push the new RPMs out. Its not\nsomething you want to do every 30 minutes, not if it takes 12 minutes\nto build.\n\nthat&#39;s why there are some advantages to REST on a single box\n\n"}}
