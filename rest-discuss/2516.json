If you build a system strictly\nin the REST style, you&#39;ll be doing something a little different from the\nnormative web out there.  Another way of saying it: if REST was just a\ndescription of existing web stuff, it wouldn&#39;t be useful in guiding the\nprocess of evolving the web.  So REST is some kind of logical extension\nof the existing web, incorporating the ideals formed from lessons learned\nwith the web.\n\nIf REST were purely descriptive, this would be an odd discussion.  But we\nare attempting to use it prescriptively.  I interpret questions like &quot;does\nREST work?&quot; to mean &quot;does REST work prescriptively?&quot;.  I think everyone\nelse does too.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2002 2:06 PM\n&gt; To: Vincent D Murphy\n&gt; Cc: Seairth Jacobs; rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST and the Web\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is an odd discussion.
