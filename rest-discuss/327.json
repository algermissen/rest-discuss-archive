Consider Plan 9:  its networking mechanism presents a\n&gt; set of services which look like files:  they can be opened, read, written to\n&gt; etc. to communicate with the services in question.  For e.g. name resolution,\n&gt; the client opens a file (something like) /net/cs (i.e., &quot;connection server&quot; is\n&gt; reified as a &quot;file&quot;) writes a string like &quot;www.foo.com&quot;, then reads the file\n&gt; contents back to receive something like &quot;209.224.18.5&quot;.  That is *just like*\n&gt; what you&#39;re describing above, with the exception that you&#39;re only passing a\n&gt; single parameter.  (Other Plan 9 services accept multiple &quot;parameters&quot; in this\n&gt; fashion.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I said before, sometimes you want something\n&gt; &gt; other than HTTP.  Sometimes you want something\n&gt; &gt; other than REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is really getting old, Alex.  Sigh.  Mark, let me say now how very sorry\n&gt; I am for having put you through this, now that I see how it looks from the\n&gt; other side of the fence.  ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
