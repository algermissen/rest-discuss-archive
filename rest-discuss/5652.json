It seems sort \n&gt; of wasteful to send multiple DELETE commands to the server, \n&gt; particularly when the number of items to be deleted could be \n&gt; quite large.  What would be a RESTful approach to this situation?\n\nThere are several options, and I&#39;ve listed them in my perceived order of\nRESTfulness (but we should start getting away from &quot;RESTfulness&quot; as\nsomething that can be objectively measured). Each choice results in a system\nbehavior that may work for you or it may present problems down the road -\nall architectural styles have an implicit &#39;mustUnderstand&#39; bit set to true.\n\n1) Don&#39;t worry about wastefulness until you measure it, just send the\nmultiple requests.\nThis approach is as RESTful as the chosen requests themselves.\nNote - its more useful if the response that has the list of items includes a\nURI for each item, rather than having the client generate a URI from some\naspect of the retrieved items. If you need super compact representations,\nyou may want to generate the URI on the client instead.\n\n2) find a less wasteful way to use the application protocol. \nFor HTTP, there is pipelining (multiple requests sent before first response\nis sent on the same connection). This likely will help the overall latency\nfrom start to finish, but I don&#39;t have any experience with it. Also, I don&#39;t\nknow how to access that functionality from a client library, or whether\nxmlhttprequest objects support that functionality. Also, http pipelining can\nonly be used with idempotent methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, etc).\nThis approach is as RESTful as the chosen requests themselves.\n\n3) consider the set of selected items to identify a single resource\n(essentially, generate a URI based on the users selection)\n DELETE http://foo.com/userstuff/items/?ids=a,b,c,d\nGenerating a URI on the client is not the most RESTful, but it&#39;s not\nhorrible either - generating URIs is fine especially if you have a\ndocumented/standard grammar that clients can use to generate those URI.\n\n4) consider the set of selected items part of a single &#39;container&#39; resource\nand modify that resource \n POST http://foo.com/userstuff/items\n content-type: application/x-www-urlencoded\n ids=a,b,c,d\nYou&#39;ll probably run into the &#39;partial update&#39; problems with these sort of\nrequests. For example, this example request does not explicitly describe in\nwhat way the items should be modified.\n\n\n"}}
