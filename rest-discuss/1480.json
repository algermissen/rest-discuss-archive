Another issue is what happens if a user\n&gt; replaces &#39;patients/UUID&#39; with &#39;doctors/UUID&#39; but uses the UUID of a patient.\n&gt; (you are going to make doctors into numbers too, not just patients, right?)\n\n404.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Yeah - cool stuff. I haven&#39;t played with this much in the past few years, so\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the best way to get &#39;device independence&#39; - essentially\n&gt; user-agent detection. Should the URI of the XSL return different XSL for\n&gt; different devices? Should there be multiple PIs in the XML? Should the PI in\n&gt; the XML be different for different user-agents? etc...\n\nGood question. If he&#39;s just using it for debugging it doesn&#39;t matter\nmuch. The stylesheet PI is a little bit simplistic...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
