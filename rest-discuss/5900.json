That use case surely does not \n&gt;&gt; apply to each and every web resource, but it does exist, and WebDAV \n&gt;&gt; makes it possible to do it through HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surely it&#39;s possible with HTTP as well?\n&gt; \n&gt; X-headers or resources which describe other resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of the fundamentals of REST as web architecture isn&#39;t it?\n\nIt could be done and it is certainly done in many cases. I&#39;m just not \naware of any specification that is widely implemented, and that would \nallow implementing it in a generic client, such as the\nMacOSX or Windows WebDAV clients.\n\nSo what I&#39;m really looking for is that people stop complaining about how \nWebDAV works, and instead make a *concrete* proposal for a different \ndesign, that could be objectively tested and compared with what WebDAV \ndoes today.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
