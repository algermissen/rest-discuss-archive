Once I was ready I&#39;d\n&gt;&gt; POST a reference to the basket to the checkout URI. Why does this need\n&gt;&gt; cookies? - it can all be done if you ensure you &#39;carry&#39; the basket URI\n&gt;&gt; around the online shop as you go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; how do you distinguish between your basket and my basket?  they&#39;re two \n&gt; seperate resources, as they should be.  now how do you know which basket \n&gt; to target the POST at (without having it hard-coded in to the \n&gt; representation of the item being bought?)?\n\nI think that is the answer - the representation of the items that I can \nbuy will contain a pointer to _my_ basket. Thats what I meant when I \nsaid I have to &#39;carry&#39; my basket around the store.\n\nThis may make the programming maginally trickier, granted, as the \nproduct pages will have to contain the identifier for my basket within them.\n\n&gt; and how do you do *that* \n&gt; without having a cookie to tell you who&#39;s logged in, and hence to use \n&gt; /customers/semantico/basket/ vis-a-vis /customers/vdm/basket/ ?\n\nAh, but if you were using cookies then the POST would be to /my_basket, \nand the internal logic of the application would direct that to \n/customers/semantico/basket/ or /customers/vdm/basket/ - these resources \nwould not be directly exposed to the POST, they would be internal to the \napplication. Which reduces visibility.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; just to be clear, while i think this reduces the RESTfulness of an app, \n&gt; i think its still better than a totally non-RESTful app, because its \n&gt; limiting the use of cookies to a well-defined area.  same goes for auth.\n&gt; \n&gt; maybe there&#39;s a better way, but i have yet to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; -vincent\n\n"}}
