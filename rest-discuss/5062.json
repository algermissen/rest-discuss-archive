The developer involved is a VB and \n: .Net scripter who just wants to get things done. However, I&#39;m not \n: confident that they understand what the SOAP stack is doing or what the \n: impact will be on the developers who will be using the services.\n: \n: I&#39;d much prefer to use a HTTP GET and a simplified XML response message, \n: and using that as a starting point to move to a REST approach, but \n: simplicity seems to be taking second place to using the latest \n: buzzwords. If anyone has any suggestions on how to contrast the two \n: approaches I&#39;d really appreciate the help. Thanks.\n: \n: -- \n: Regards\n: Andrew Hallam\n: \n: Digital Earth Pty Ltd\n: www.digitalearth.com.au\n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: Yahoo!
