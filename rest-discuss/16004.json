This is the right\nchoice of media type to include a snippet of XML that doesn&#39;t stand\nalone, and is formatted such that it doesn&#39;t need transformation.  But\nis this the RESTful choice?  No.  What is a blogroll, but a list of\nbookmarks?  Is there a standalone media type for a list of bookmarks?\n\nYes.  Coming soon, is blogroll.xbel as application/xbel+xml.  Not only\ncan XSLT transform it to look exactly like blogroll.xml currently\nlooks, but as a standalone file it has a self-descriptive media type --\nyou can point a browser at it, and import the blogroll into your\nbookmarks, because that&#39;s the gist of the media type.\n\nPointing to an included XML snippet as text/xml and calling it NOT REST\nis wrong -- not a hard-and-fast rule.  But, in the case of a standalone\nlist of bookmarks, where a ubiquitous media type exists for that\npurpose, using text/xml for blogroll.xml as I have, is NOT REST.  The\ndesirable property gained from XBEL is the serendipitous re-use of a\nblogroll to populate a browser&#39;s bookmarks.  That&#39;s so REST!\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
