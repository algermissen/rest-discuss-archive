(which i\n&gt; wrote in previous thread)\n\nAh right... I see. Clearly the Accept header applies to any HTTP\nclient. I don&#39;t think that makes your examples wrong.\n\n\n&gt; Well, here&#39;s a scenario:\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose a RESTful server provides both ATOM and HTML version of a\n&gt; hacking tutorial with  URL: http://foo/tutorials/hacking101.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any client (including browser) can get the document (ATOM or HTML) by:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /tutorials/hacking101\n&gt; Accept:application/atom+xml\n&gt; -or-\n&gt; GET /tutorials/hacking101\n&gt; Accept: text/html\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, in the HTML document, the author wish to provide a link to lead\n&gt; readers to ATOM document.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;html&gt;\n&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;alternative&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;ATOM\n&gt; verson&quot; href=&quot;/tutorials/hacking101&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/head&gt;\n&gt; &lt;body&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/tutorials/hacking101&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;&gt;ATOM\n&gt; version of Hacking101&lt;/a&gt; is available now!\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/body&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The same url is used here (without trailing .ext). \n&gt; When the user click the link, a web browser should aware the &quot;type&quot;\n&gt; attribute and send a specific request as follow, to receive ATOM\n&gt; document:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /tutorials/hacking101\n&gt; Accept:application/atom+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; But, does this action consistent in major web browsers?\n\nNo. I don&#39;t think &lt;a type=&quot;...&quot;/&gt; does what you think. It&#39;s only a\nhint, it&#39;s not a request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 suggests that a resource should not be tied to a\nrepresentation, that it should be possible to have differeing forms of\nthe representation. \n\nBut this inherantly means one form of representation cannot refer to\nanother without specific meta markup.\n\nThat&#39;s what &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot;/&gt; is for. It&#39;s meta markup for\nrepresentation relationships.\n\nIf you want to tell the user about alternative representations in a\nsafe HTML-y kind of way what you could do is have some JavaScript in\nthe page (or a greasemonkey script) to parse the DOM and present the\n&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot;/&gt; forms with associated XmlHttpRequest logic to\nget the alternate form and make it current (or pop it up in the new\nwindow).\n\n\nBut you can&#39;t do it with just browser config. It just doesn&#39;t work\nlike that.\n\n\nNic\n\n\n\n"}}
