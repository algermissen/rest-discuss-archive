It \nwould seem to go against the very nature of the web to *not* allow\ntwo calls to be made in parallel, regardless of how it was declared.\n\nIn the example you gave, if the schema of the document that is \nPOST-ed to the &quot;Bank&quot; partner required elements that would be returned \nfrom calls to the &quot;Seller&quot; and &quot;Shipper&quot; partners, wouldn&#39;t that be \nsufficient to, in essense, declare what the required flow would be?\n\nThanks.\n\n"}}
