My understanding of the discussion was that we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussing heuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media\n&gt; &gt; &gt; types.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The thing is, that it is actually pretty clear that generic media types\n&gt; + embedded specific stuff + a new means for negotiating that stuff is silly\n&gt; because the mechanism for negotiation such stuff is the media type\n&gt; identifier in the first place. It is the mechanism built into HTTP for that\n&gt; purpose.\n&gt; &gt; (Not to question the usefulness of standard general link relations\n&gt; orthogonal to media types, of course)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Specific media types is what one should do and there is no problem with\n&gt; them.

My=\r\n understanding of the discussion was that we were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; discussing =\r\nheuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; types.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The thing is, that it is actually pretty clear that gener=\r\nic media types + embedded specific stuff + a new means for negotiating that=\r\n stuff is silly because the mechanism for negotiation such stuff is the med=\r\nia type identifier in the first place. It is the mechanism built into HTTP =\r\nfor that purpose.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; (Not to question the usefulness of standard gen=\r\neral link relations orthogonal to media types, of course)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Specific media types is what one should do and there is no problem with th=\r\nem. Yet, some people make it sound as if there is a problem - and this I fi=\r\nnd is adding confusion for others that try to learn REST.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Jan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; /Paul&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Paul Cohen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.seibostudi=\r\nos.se&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.seibostudios.se&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mobile: &lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;tel:%2B46%20730%20787%20035&quot; value=3D&quot;+46730787035&quot;&gt;+46 730 787 035&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; e-mail: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:paul.cohen@...&quot;&gt;pau=\r\nl.cohen@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; ------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
