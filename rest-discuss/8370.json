I&#39;d point out which one, but I am curious\n&gt; &gt; if anyone else can figure out what is missing from the description.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is &quot;Hypermedia is the engine of application state&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am especially curious because almost every presentation that\n&gt; &gt; tries to describe REST leaves the same bits out, and I am wondering\n&gt; &gt; if it is because I explained it poorly in my dissertation or if it\n&gt; &gt; is simply hard to understand why it is essential to the style.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s hard to apply in the machine-to-machine, replacement-for-RPC case,\n&gt; which is where many people really want to use REST.  If the client isn&#39;t\n&gt; a user-agent, but is instead a knowledgeable actor in the domain, it can\n&gt; be out of place for the server to tell it what links to traverse, and\n&gt; what forms look like, rather than the client just constructing the links\n&gt; and building the &quot;form-response&quot; from out-of-band knowledge.  It&#39;s extra\n&gt; overhead.  While essential in the large-scale, evolutionary-web\n&gt; situation, it&#39;s wasted on the smaller-scale &quot;I know that I want to make\n&gt; a version 1.1 &#39;POST shoppingCartItemAddition&#39; request of\n&gt; ShoppingCartFormat 2.7&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the slides, I&#39;d not label it a &quot;design pattern&quot;.  As I\n&gt; understand, architecture sets up the constraints of a solution space in\n&gt; a context, and design expresses a more specific class of technical\n&gt; solution within those constraints.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - a=jsled;b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
