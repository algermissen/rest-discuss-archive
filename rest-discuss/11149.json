The .csv and .json extensions have no ambiguity; the\nsame can&#39;t be said for .html which might be text/html or\napplication/xhtml+xml, or .xml which may be text/xml or application/\nxml, and so on.\n\nA sane system using the query portion, is one which distinguishes\nbetween representations rather than output formats, i.e. assume the\nfollowing both render as JSON:\n\n/team/cubs;view=foo\n/team/cubs;view=bar\n\nThe alternative being cubs.json and perhaps cubs.txt for the second\nJSON representation, which introduces ambiguous extensions, which seems\nlike a good reason not to use file extensions, to me.\n\nAn application may also serve XHTML 1.0, as application/xhtml+xml to\ncompatible clients, and as text/html to other clients.  Since there&#39;s\nonly one file, its extension is moot, making URI parameters viable to\nspecify the particular output serialization rather than having two\ncopies of the same file, one as .htm and the other as .html...\n\n-Eric\n\n&quot;Roy T.

Everybody uses name\n&gt; extensions for that purpose.  There is absolutely no good reason\n&gt; to do the above instead of\n&gt; \n&gt;     /team/cubs.csv\n&gt;     /team/cubs.json\n&gt; \n&gt; and plenty of reasons to avoid using query syntax.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have a look at Apache Sling for an example.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n\n"}}
