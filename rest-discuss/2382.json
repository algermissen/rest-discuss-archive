All that one can ever\n&gt; retrieve is a representation of a resource.  If you have two (or two\n&gt; hundred) URIs, each returns a representation of a resource.  If you take\nmy\n&gt; PurchaseOrder URI1 and URI2 examples, URI2 is not a representation of a\n&gt; representation of the resource pointed to by URI1.  URI2 returns a\n&gt; representation of a resource.  URI1 returns a representation of a\nresource.\n&gt; Sure, they may both be pointing to the same resource, but that doesn&#39;t\nmean\n&gt; that URI2 is subordinate to URI1.\nThey cannot be pointing to the same resource, they have different URIs. They\nmight be pointing to the same data behind the scenes, but externally, that\nis not visible. A resource is what is visible externally. The same PO data\n(the bits) might have multiple resources exposed.\nPersonally, I wouldn&#39;t expose multiple resources in order to provide\ndifferent content types - I&#39;d use Accept: and Content-Type: for that. I\nmight use different resources to expose different portions of a purchase\norder - or perhaps different portions of the history of actions related to a\n&#39;purchase&#39;.\n\n"}}
