I am the author of the book and I am almost done \n(nipping and tucking going on right now), as it is to be published in \nFeb 06.  If somebody is willing to do a review I am sure my publisher is \nwilling to give some copies.\n\nLet me give a brain dump on why this book.  I have been building Web \nServices since 98, and Web Applications since 95.  And if there is one \nthing that bothers me is that life is too complicated.  It seems to me \nthat the framework vendors are doing this to sell or drive frameworks.  \nI became &quot;enlightened&quot; in the middle of 04 when I had a very good and \nlong talk Elliotte Rusty Harrold.  We talked about Web Services, Web \nApplications and my misgivings about the current trend.  He just laughed \nand said, &quot;Yes you should be concerned&quot;.  The main issue was that SOAP, \nand the Web Application frameworks have become too complicated and have \nbecome selfish.  I consider a framework selfish when the framework \ncannot see beyond it&#39;s own needs to solve a problem. \n\nThe book came of the need like REST to make things simple again.  What I \nlike about Ajax and REST is that they are &quot;getting back to the roots&quot; \ntechnologies.  The book says Ajax, but reading and looking at the \npatterns you will very quickly realize REST is an essential part of the \nbook.  In contrast to many other books the focus is not on &quot;dancing \njakes&quot;, but how to write the next generation of Web applications.  I \nhave to be very frank here, I have always been a very big fan of the \nApache community and the proposals that have come out of the Apache \ncommunity.  The book draws quite a bit of its inspiration from REST, and \nthe Apache community. \n\nIn about a month I will be releasing a website that contains all of the \npatterns coded in Java, and .NET as the book explains the patterns using \nJava and/or .NET.  For those wondering, why not Ruby, Python?  Simple \nanswer I had to focus.  However, the patterns are explained in such a \nway that they could be applied to Ruby or Python without much \nresistance.  Whenever I used Java, or .NET I used very generic \ntechniques that I knew worked on both Java, .NET, and other \ntechnologies  The only part that concerns me with respect to PHP, \nPython, or Ruby are HTTP filter mechanisms.  I have this wierd feeling \nthat there developers could have problems, based on my research on what \nis possible and not possible.  The idea is to release the patterns in as \nmany technologies as possible so that they can be used regardless of \nwhat you are using as a language or framework.\n\nIf anybody has any questions please feel free to questions in this \nforum, or via my private email address. \n\nChristian\n\n\n"}}
