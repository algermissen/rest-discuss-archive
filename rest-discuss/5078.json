This is\n&gt; exacerbated if the invocation is going across the internet.\n&gt;\n&gt; In that situation, it is usually considered very poor design to hold a\n&gt; transaction and tie up the resources on the back end.\n&gt;\n&gt; Better bet is to keep the granularity of your REST (or WS) calls  \n&gt; coarse\n&gt; enough that the transaction is handled entirely by the back end.\n\nI am also wrestling with the transaction issues at the moment and  \nwhile I fully\nagree with the issue above, I wonder\n\n- if that means that a 2 phase commit is just not realistically  \ndoable in a networked\n   system and therefore no issue with REST (and we just forget about  \nit; no travel bookings\n   etc.)\n\nor\n\n- if transactions across unrelated systems indeed make sense in a  \nnetworked system and\n   how we do them with REST.\n\n(I read the postings/Wiki pages but I am having a hard time  \ndistinguishing the ideas on\n  local transactions from those about &#39;distributed&#39; ones. Maybe it  \nwouyld be a good idea\n  to split the material on the Wiki? Any transaction guru that would  \nhelp me out in doing\n  this?)\n\n\nBTW: can a single HTTP method call considered to be atomic? If a PUT  \nfails, can I\nassume that nothing of the operation succeded? Can a POST be  \npartially processed and\nstill return with an error? Or is this allways either/or?\n\nThanks.\n\nJan\n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n____________________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer                          \nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;    \nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
