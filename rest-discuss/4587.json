Thanks, Hugh.\n\nWhat sort o=\r\nf &quot;client&quot; application could you be talking about, other \nthan some thin-cl=\r\nient - like a web-browser or directory explorer - which\n\ndoesn&#39;t expect to =\r\nbe doing any processing?  I wouldn&#39;t expect to be \nable to point at some ar=\r\nbitrary resource and get anything done.\n\nWhat you&#39;ve outlined seems to go w=\r\nay beyond what Fielding defines\n&quot;substitutability&quot; to be.\n\n&gt; But at least t=\r\nhe architectural\n&gt; ideal has been identified, which permits one to more eas=\r\nily see the\n&gt; tradeoffs being made with alternate solutions.\n\nYou seem to b=\r\ne saying that any client-side application that is\nhard-coded\nto process a s=\r\npecific response ideally should use a new method.  How is\nthis any differen=\r\nt from RPC then?\n\n\n"}}
