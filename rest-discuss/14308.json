However, I&#39;m not quite sure how that\n&gt; would apply to a busi=\r\nness scenario which includes both linked data and\n&gt; operations and work flo=\r\nw.\n\nThere is the GoodRelations ontology \n\n    http://purl.org/goodrelations=\r\n/\n\nwhich should start finding a lot of very useful applications. I have not=\r\n been following it but I think it has been used by BestBuy now, and does so=\r\nme interesting things in Google Search results\n\n    http://www.ebusiness-un=\r\nibw.org/wiki/GoodRelationsInGoogle\n\n\n&gt; What&#39;s the sweet spot for RDF?  What=\r\n rules of thumb would you use to choose\n&gt; RDF vs. ATOM vs. XML/JSon API alt=\r\nernatives?\n\nThere is already a confusion in your question: you first need t=\r\no distinguish between syntax and semantics. RDF is about semantics, done on=\r\n a global scale with URIs. \n\nHere is a picture describing the relation betw=\r\neen syntax and semantics\n \n    http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/the_limit=\r\nations_of_json\n\nThe format to serialise it in is a secondary problem, and t=\r\nhere are a lot available. In fact any XML format can be seen as an RDF form=\r\nat with  GRDDL . The advantage of the native formats is that once you have =\r\ndefined your vocabulary, you no longer need to worry about the formats agai=\r\nn! That is one big advantage.\n\nThe next is that you can mix vocabularies, s=\r\no you don&#39;t have to keep reinventing names for things.\n\nThird: you can find=\r\n the meaning of a term (URLs in a linked data environment) by clicking on i=\r\nt.  (Just like you do on the web).\n\n     http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry=\r\n/get_my_meaning\n\nSo the above reasons make it simpler to develop and use ap=\r\nplications. That means the people seeing your RDF will be able to quickly w=\r\nork out how it fits with their needs, what you are saying.\n\nFinally it just=\r\n simple REST. On a global medium like the web you can ONLY use URIs to refe=\r\nr to things. So you might as well think that way from the start. If you don=\r\n&#39;t do it, it is because you have not yet broken out of client/server thinki=\r\nng. \n\nHenry\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Dec 10, 2009 at 7:29 PM, Story Hen=\r\nry &lt;henry.story@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On 26 Nov 2009, at 20:=\r\n45, swschilke wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear *,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; can you kindly point me out s=\r\nome good examples of REST implementations.\n&gt;&gt; Preferable well documented ;-=\r\n) - I&#39;ve read the O&#39;Reilly book about the\n&gt;&gt; Twitter API but I want to see =\r\nmore.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Try http://dbpedia.org and the growing Linked Data space\n&gt;&gt; ht=\r\ntp://linkeddata.org/\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Henry\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; sws\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n\n"}}
