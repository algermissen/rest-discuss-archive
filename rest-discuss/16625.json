But I teach Software Architecture fundamentals.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I mention REST simple as an example in many of the class sessions=\r\n, and I have one just devoted to explain the constrains and actually to wip=\r\ne the idea of REST as an easy Web Service engine.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, I do not start =\r\nin any of the two explanations you just mentioned. I actually start with Ch=\r\napter 4. My students already know what an architectural style is and also m=\r\nany of the properties. Chapter 4 explains what properties and requirements =\r\nthe Web had. It helps a lot to understand why the constrains, and also help=\r\ns to build up criteria to choose REST for an app or not. \n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, chapter=\r\n 2 ( 2.3 Architectural Properties of Key Interest) may be confused with the=\r\n actual properties of the web. Be careful with that. Section 2.3 lists the =\r\nproperties that are somehow affected by the styles in chapter 3, and they a=\r\nre properties that are generally important for Networked applications. The =\r\nweb is just one particular type of networked application, it is a large dis=\r\ntributed hypermedia system. The particular requirements (and the ones REST =\r\nin chapter 5 tries to fulfill) are in chapter 4. \n\nYes, and you should note=\r\n that I only included those properties that are later\nused in the explanati=\r\nons -- there are many more out there in the wild, just\nas there are more po=\r\ntential constraints (and styles).  I only had a finite\ntime to finish writi=\r\nng.\n\nLast year, I found (via a link from Mark Nottingham) an excellent desc=\r\nription\nof the design process.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find the book now (m=\r\noving sucks).\nIt is in the intro pages of the really big book by Charles & =\r\nRay Eames:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eames-Design-John-Neuhart/dp/0810908794\n\n=\r\nand we are fortunate that Amazon&#39;s &quot;look inside&quot; feature includes it\n(see p=\r\nages 13-15).\n\n&gt; To me, the dissertation is an excellent real life example o=\r\nf architecting, following a clear methodology to generate a style, and that=\r\n can be applied to other applications, but that doesn&#39;t mean all my next ap=\r\nplications should be REST. Roy gives an example in the conclusions, REST is=\r\n optimized for large grain hypermedia transfer, if you have a computational=\r\n intensive system, REST may not be for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, I use REST=\r\n as an analytical example. I try not to teach it as a set of rules and cons=\r\ntrains.\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez.\n\nExcellent summary.  Cheers,\n\n....=\r\nRoy\n\n\n"}}
