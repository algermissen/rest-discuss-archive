Any representation of a resource can\n&gt; contain a form if the data format supports it.  If you want to edit\n&gt; the representation, you can do so and then attempt to PUT it back.\n\nHitting /entries/1 with GET would give me back a xhtml view of the resource in \nnon-editable form, just straight xhtml.  I need to know how to hit a given \nresource and ask for a form representation of it or a &#39;view-only&#39; \nrepresentation of it.  See my other post to Jan for more discussion on this. \nI think you use MIME types to tell the server what you want, if I&#39;m \nunderstanding her right.\n\n&gt;&gt; The same applies to getting a blank form for creating a new resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why a blank form?  You&#39;d want a form that pointed (URI) you to the\n&gt; resource which performs the resource-creation side effect.  The form\n&gt; would also have to tell you the media type that should be used for\n&gt; that.  The URI from which you got the form via GET might be the same\n&gt; to which you POST back though.\n\nTo create a new resource, you need to fill out a form (in my web site).  That \nwould submit to the &quot;resource which performs the resource-creation side \neffect&quot;. I&#39;d expect the resource I GET the form from to be the one to POST \nback to, in order to be RESTful.  So, I&#39;d need a blank form in my web browser \nto do this.  I have to get that blank form from somewhere.\n\nScott\n\n\n\n\n"}}
