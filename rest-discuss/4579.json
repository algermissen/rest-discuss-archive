But no, I have\n&gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;issue with either, a) expecting the query results in the POST\n&gt; response,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and b) expecting the query results in a GET on the returned\n&gt; Location\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;URI.  The issue is not the mechanism, it&#39;s the additional\n&gt; expectation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;since it&#39;s not one that can be met by other resources and\n&gt; therefore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;neither uniform nor RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in this case it&#39;s not being handled by a single\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resource but a set of resources, each that behaves\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uniformly with respect to the methods used.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The first resource - the one to which the query document is POSTed -\n&gt; &gt; does not present the same interface as other resources because it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; meeting an expectation which other resources do not meet.  If it\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; to do it completely self-descriptively, its interface would have\n&gt; &gt; another method, such as &quot;QUERY&quot; or some such which makes the\n&gt; difference\n&gt; &gt; in expectations explicit rather than implicit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FWIW, this is the same point the &quot;document oriented SOA&quot; proponents\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; yet to absorb.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Said another way, I couldn&#39;t POST a query\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;document to any old resource and expect it to understand that I\n&gt; expect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;back the results, nor could I assume that anything I got back\n&gt; from an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;arbitrary resource was the results of the query document being\n&gt; processed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as a query.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So what do you think would be the most RESTish way to handle this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There isn&#39;t a way to handle this RESTfully, I don&#39;t believe.  That\n&gt; &gt; leaves a handful of &quot;almost RESTful&quot; solutions (including the two\n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; outlined), and which one is best certainly depends upon your\n&gt; &gt; application.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think the idiom I describe in that message you referenced is a\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; one because it gives you a URI for the results of a query.  But it\n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; costs you an extra network round trip.  A superior hybrid approach\n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt; return the query results on the POST response and also provide the\n&gt; URI\n&gt; &gt; via Content-Location.  I haven&#39;t tried the hybrid approach though.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mark.\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Mark Baker.
