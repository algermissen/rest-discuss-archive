Sounds like you&#39;re asking more for a popularization, which would be\na good thing. \n\nOne of the things I plan to blog about soon is what I think would help see\nstandards get used more, and that is to follow the Creative Commons model of\nspecifications:\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\n\tVs.\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/legalcode\n \n&gt;&gt; A lot of people on this list have done some pretty good jobs of it: Paul\nPrescod, Joe Gregorio come to mind... have a look at their writings and see\nwhat you think.\n\nI&#39;ve researched REST issues exhaustively for the past three weeks!  I think\nI&#39;ve read everything there is on the web about REST and related topics (at\nleast everything Google can see.) \nPaul&#39;s articles were written for someone who already understands REST, IMO,\nor at least who understands how to figure things out from an abstract\ndiscussion. I think Paul just doesn&#39;t know how to not understand the\nsubject, and his writing shows that.  (Sorry to be critical Paul, but I\ngotta call em like I see em.)\n\nJoe&#39;s writings were actually pretty good, if long-winded. Joe&#39;s were the\n*only* writings from anyone that I found that gave concrete examples and\nthus the only ones where I was able to really start understanding.  And I\ndon&#39;t mean the &quot;long-winded&quot; as a criticism; it was appropriate for the\ncontext of an article on XML.com, but they are not the best if for trying to\nget someone to understand REST who is not willing to make a several hour\ncommitment to reading.  Again, I point to:\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\n\nAnd while a &quot;two hour commitment&quot; may not seem like much, it took me 40-60\nhours finding and reading documents about REST to come to understand that\nJoe&#39;s articles were the only ones I really needed to read; most people won&#39;t\nbe that diligent (and I normally wouldn&#39;t either, but I really needed to get\nthis right.)   If Joe&#39;s articles were the only articles available anywhere\non the subject, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But these days any a**hole can\nwrite a blog post, and you never know who is actually &quot;authoritative&quot; on the\nsubject.  And Joe&#39;s article was one person&#39;s opinion; there is no known\nconsensus surrounding it.  \n\nAnd I guess what is the BIGGEST problem with REST is all the contentious\ndebate I&#39;ve found on the list and in the archives.  When I see so much\nunresolved debate it makes me wonder who actually knows what they are\ntalking about and who is wrong, hence I questione Joe&#39;s articles.\n\nBut Joe&#39;s articles have been for the most part the ONLY articles on REST\nthat make any sense. What&#39;s more, I had to look pretty hard to *find* his\narticles. Sure, they were easy to find once I knew they existed and that I\nshould look for them, but just googling for REST didn&#39;t find them.  Going\nthrough five Google result pages on REST and I still don&#39;t find Joe&#39;s\narticles.  I only found them because someone on one of the lists referenced\none of them.\n\nSo I guess what I&#39;m looking for is a peer-reviewed and\nas-concise-as-possible document with examples that everyone can point to and\nsay &quot;Yes, that is REST and it addresses 99% of questions people ask&quot; and\nthat everyone will then point to and just say &quot;Yes, that is REST.&quot;\nOtherwise it will just be the ongoing debate about what is and what isn&#39;t\nREST hence wasting many people&#39;s time. And based on the list archives, it\nappears the debate has continued for quite some time.  Hell, I&#39;ll write the\ndocument assuming I can get it peer-reviewed and ultimately approved by all\nthe generally respected authorities on REST \n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\nP.S. Regaring RFC 2616, the average person isn&#39;t going to think to grab a\n176 page standards document on HTTP when they think to themselves &quot;I want to\nlearn REST.&quot;\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: hwinkler@...
