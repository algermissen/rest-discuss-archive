This means =\r\nthat\nyou do not get the pretty collapsible tree view of the XML for a\n`+xml=\r\n` document, instead you get a application chooser or download dialog.\n\nThis=\r\n may seem like a minor issue but it is really a significant\nimpediment to u=\r\nsing vnd mime types for systems with non-captive\nconsumers.  If you are try=\r\ning to convince people to use your fancy new\nREST web service they are most=\r\n likely going to play with it in a\nbrowser first.  Getting a &quot;what applicat=\r\nion would you like to execute&quot;\ndialog is a lot less compelling that a nicel=\r\ny rendered self describing\nXML document.  \n\nI think this is actually a bug =\r\nin browsers but you go to market with\nthe browsers you have.  Having a mech=\r\nanism that can simultaneously\nallow existing browser to render stuff pretti=\r\nly and app specific\nconsumers to request the specific document types might =\r\nbe worth it.\n\nPeter\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n\n"}}
