Or just refer to it?  If it refers to it, if the\n&gt; buyer changed it unilaterally from Tuesday to Monday and from 50 to\n&gt; 100, how does the seller prove it?\n\nHere&#39;s how I would do it:\n\n&lt;ShipmentNotification&gt;\n  &lt;Commitment uri=&quot;http://..../&quot; signature=&quot;digital_hash&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;dsig&gt;...&lt;/dsig&gt;\n&lt;/ShipmentNotification&gt;\n\nIf the hash doesn&#39;t match the resource then the resource has a different\nstate than when I agreed to it.
