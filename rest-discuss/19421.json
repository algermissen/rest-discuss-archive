But unl=\r\ness I mis-read or Roy has revised his definition of REST since that post I =\r\nthink service documents do not a RESTful web service make?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, just curious, are you using your own=\r\n custom media type or just JSON/XML/other, and if not the former does that =\r\nalso not disqualify it from being considered RESTful? =A0If you are using y=\r\nour own custom media type I&#39;d be curious what the media type is, i.e. w=\r\nhat is &quot;xxxx-yyyy&quot; for &quot;application/&quot;xxxx-yyyy&quot; an=\r\nd what it&#39;s base format is; XML, JSON, HAL, ATOM, etc?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The one thing I still have not been able to fully understand fro=\r\nm Roy&#39;s rant was just exactly what he meant means by a &quot;typed&quot=\r\n; resource? =A0Doesn&#39;t a &lt;img&gt; tag imply a resource of type JPEG,=\r\n GIF or PNG, for example? =A0So I have never been fully able to grok that p=\r\nart. =A0Any clarifications from anyone?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt color=3D&quot;#888888&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Mike&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\r\n--90e6ba6e8a2051575a04dbdf1dc4--\r\n\n"}}
