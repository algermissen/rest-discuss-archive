The credit for realizing that personal , ever changing data\n&gt; should=\r\n be shown via set of entries interconnected via links, should go\n&gt; to them =\r\nand not to REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST just says that using HATEOS as a constraint, you=\r\n would induce\n&gt; some very interesting properties in a network based applica=\r\ntion, not\n&gt; the least of which is loose coupling.\n\n\nThanks for your insight=\r\ns Devdatta.\n\nI am working on the practical-side of things. and i see real\na=\r\ndvantages in the REST approach.\n\nFor example, HATEOAS was/is a difficult co=\r\nncept to grasp, and I found\nthat the stopwatch in the ipod, was for me, a n=\r\nice, focussed example\nof this part of REST and why it is good.

Firstly it seems to have a\nuniform\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  i=\r\nnterface. Furthermore, as I go through\n&#39;music-&gt;artists-&gt;elvis&#39;, etc\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; =\r\n&gt;  ... I am navigating links. This is &quot;connectedness&quot; as\ndescribed in\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n&gt; &gt;  RESTful Web Services. Actually, I would like to see more\nfrom the Pod\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  in this direction - for example, for the song I am currently\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n listening\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  to, it would be nice to see how this is linked into wh=\r\nich\nplaylist,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  genre, etc. This would be going in the linked data =\r\ndirection.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  Furthermore, I believe I see a very nice example of th=\r\ne\nmysterious\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  hypermedia as the engine of application state, in, f=\r\nor\nexample, the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  stopwatch function of the ipod.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
