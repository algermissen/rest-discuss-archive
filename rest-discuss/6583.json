I think you  \ncan achieve self-descriptive messages even if the media type isn&#39;t  \nregistered with IETF (or any other standards body like W3C or OASIS).  \nIf the publishing party (say a company) gains enough trust in it  \nsupporting the stability of the format, re-use by others becomes  \npossible.\nThis approach is likely to be the only option for some time to come  \nfor many enterprise related domains, but at least REST emphasizes the  \npoint of message standardization and keeps us from dumping millions  \nof specialized APIs onto the world.\n\nTwo issues:\n\n- in the absence of a registered MIME type dispatching has to be done  \non the basis of for\n   example the XML namespace of a given message&#39;s root element (UBL  \nwould be a good example,\n   though I fail to see why we cannot just have a MIME type  \nregistered for it??)\n\n- rolling your own format is hard and one should look for reuse  \nwherever possible (the Atom\n   extension mechanism appears to make things a bit easier in terms  \nof writing the spec for\n   the additions you need; in a the situation changed from &#39;roll your  \nown MIME type&#39; to &#39;roll\n   your own Atom extension&#39;)\n\nJan\n\n&gt; If this is really\n&gt; accepted common wisdom, almost all examples of RESTful apps I&#39;m aware\n&gt; of, and most articles (including e.g. the excellent one at http://\n&gt; www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/01/restful-web.html from Joe Gregorio) do\n&gt; not, in fact, describe RESTful applications.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or should we view REST as an ideal and a RESTful app as one that\n&gt; tries to come as close to it as possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
