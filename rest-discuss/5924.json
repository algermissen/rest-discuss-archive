That is, requests from the server to \nthe client?  I guess the appropriate way is to have the &quot;server&quot; make \nHTTP requests of the &quot;client&quot;.  But that can&#39;t be done if the client is \nbehind a firewall.\n\nBasically, my intention is to piggyback the reverse request in a \nresponse to a request from the client.  Then the client would respond by \nsending a new request to the server, and so forth.  The resource URL for \nthe reverse request would now have to be encoded in the body of the HTTP \nresponse.\n\nThoughts?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
