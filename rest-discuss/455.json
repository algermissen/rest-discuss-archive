And it&#39;s\n&gt; far from an abuse.  The part after the &quot;//&quot; is an authority, and a\n&gt; public key is a perfectly valid authority.\n\nHow is this less of an abuse than using email\naddress?  distobj@... is also an authorty...\n\n&gt; When you decentralize, you do sacrifice some advantages of\n&gt; centralization, granted.  But I&#39;d personally be willing to make the\n&gt; &quot;rent a DNS address&quot; versus &quot;own a public key&quot; tradeoff if I could.\n&gt; Also, nothing prevents Verisign from trying to push PKI here and\n&gt; suggesting that all key holders need them as a CA.  Naming is as\n&gt; much a trust issue as it is anything else.\n\nOk, but onces you invoke a CA you are talking\nabout something different:\n\nhttp://[rohit&#39;s CA id]/adam\n\nThe CA then certifies a particular public key as\nbeing under the control of the entity represented\nby this ID.  To me this all sounds like DNS with\nSSL certificates.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
