I should say that I was \nmost definitely *not* trying to offer a new definition \nof POST; I was basically trying to catalogue the \nuses of POST that have been brought up in order to try \nto bring into relief the precise issue that Walden was \ntrying to raise.  Which I think boils down to: if RPC \nis bad because it&#39;s misusing POST to send, in essence, \narbitrary data to some URL, in what way is that different \nfrom using it as what you call a Document Processor - if\nI understand what you mean by that term. :)\n\nI tried to spell out what I see as a real and meaningful \ndifference.  \n\nI agree with Walden that there are situations that seem\nvery gray. One that I can think of right away is performing\natomic updates across multiple resources.  The canonical,\n&quot;transfer funds between accounts&quot; example seems like a\ngood use case to examine.\n\nI would be very interested in hearing other&#39;s thoughts on \nhow to do that in a way that doesn&#39;t smack of RPC.\n\nThanks,\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n\n"}}
