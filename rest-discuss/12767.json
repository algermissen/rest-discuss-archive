Now imagine\n&gt;&gt; that there are 5 different ways this can happen. This rather quickly\n&gt;&gt; seems to sprial out of control.\n&gt;\n&gt; You seem to be implying that those 5 different ways, and different flows,\n&gt; would result in the same resource being modified in the same way without\n&gt; context.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stop me if i&#39;m wrong, but if you were to change an address in 5 different\n&gt; ways using commands, you would have 5 different commands?\n&gt;\n&gt; In ReST, the state that is shared between client and server isn&#39;t without\n&gt; workflows. You modify a resource (the concept of address) by sending one or\n&gt; many representations to one or many URIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing prevents you from operating various workflows through the use of\n&gt; various URIs, or if modelled on a state machine, to keep track of where in\n&gt; the workflow a client application is, and instruct on what to do next, based\n&gt; on the current state being sent back and forth by the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think i&#39;m still missing the point as to why changing an address in 5\n&gt; different ways through 5 different flows would be impossible or messy in\n&gt; ReST? The only way I could understand such a statement would be in the case\n&gt; where you believe that they all end up triggering the same operation on the\n&gt; same resource, which is not a ReST constraint per se.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought\nwithout accepting it.\n\n"}}
