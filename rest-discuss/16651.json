If I want to find out what they mean right now I have no choice but to go to [insert preferred search engine]. I suspect that this is in no small part due to the high barrier to registration in place right now. Whilst this might well make sense for &quot;fundamental&quot; types like application/xml or application/atom+xml, it makes far less sense for domain-specific dialects of the fundamental types. \n&gt; \n\nI&#39;d go with Mark&#39;s position (See &quot;Problem three&quot;) here.\n\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2008/02/media-type-centralization-is-a-feature-not-a-bug/\n\nI do not think that the entry barrier is too high (see vendor and personal tree).\n\n*Not* having a central authority would mean media type would sprawl just like XML schemas (see &quot;Problem one&quot;).\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Sep 23, 2010 at 11:55, Nathan &lt;nathan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt; My initial answer is: guess what you have now - exactly that situation, only\n&gt; it isn&#39;t surfaced as a media type issue.
