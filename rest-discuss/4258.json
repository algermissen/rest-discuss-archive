For instance, the\nscriptable http/xml testing tool was ideal for scripting functional\ntests against the backend, but something like jWebUnit would have been\nmore appropriate for testing an HTML+javascript application.  Likewise,\nthe breadth of response codes/exceptions we used was wider and different\nthan one would normally use with a user-agent.\n\n\n&gt; What do you mean when you say &quot;XML-enabled&quot;?

The\nidea/implementation that there are a set of domain objects which\nimplement some &quot;I&#39;m-XML-aware&quot; interface [or, worse, inherit from some\ntotally-unrelated-to-their-function base object].\n\n&gt; What would you prefer over XML-enabled objects?\n\nLightly-wrapped/typed RDF data blobs, I think, but I haven&#39;t been able\nto play around with the idea enough yet to see exactly how it works...\nand just a bit off-topic for this list. :)\n\n\nMy point re: the toolkit/framework discussion would be that nobody has a\ngood way of handling this, yet, that I&#39;ve seen ... I&#39;d be very wary of\nusing a framework that tried to force me to use an approach that I\nwouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t buy into or easily leave.\n\n...jsled\n \n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo\n${a}@${b}`\n# A: Because it breaks the flow of normal conversation.\n# Q: Why don&#39;t we put the response before the request?\n\n\n"}}
