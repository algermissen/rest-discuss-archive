Looking at the following example, I \n&gt; would expect a 404 Not Found error if the DELETE targeted a non-\n&gt; existent language representation even if a default representation has \n&gt; been created:\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: *\n&gt;\n\nAFAICT &#39;*&#39; is not a valid value for a language tag.\n\n From the &#39;owners manual&#39; section 3.10 Language Tags [1]:\n\n         language-tag  = primary-tag *( &quot;-&quot; subtag )\n         primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA\n         subtag        = 1*8ALPHA\n\nPaul.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.10\n\n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: fr-CA\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     DELETE /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: fr-FR\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n&gt; \n&gt; All well and good.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, when it comes to a GET or HEAD request then the situation \n&gt; seems more muddled. Looking at the following example, I would expect \n&gt; to see a 200 OK on a GET with Accept-Language (because there is a \n&gt; default representation available):\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: *\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: fr-CA\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     GET /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Accept-Language: fr-FR\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt; \n&gt; Now for a browser-based user experience, this is good. But if the \n&gt; client is a robot then the situation is not as clear. Assuming that \n&gt; the response has the Content-Language value set, then I suppose that \n&gt; the robot could invalidate the response if it is only actually \n&gt; interested in the fr-FR representation. This doesn&#39;t really feel \n&gt; right to me though.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, reading the owners manual at \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.12 , I \n&gt; am considering a scenario where a GET or HEAD request that specifies \n&gt; a Content-Language will respond with the 404 Not Found explicitly:\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: *\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     PUT /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: fr-CA\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt;     GET /foo.rdf HTTP/1.1\n&gt;     Content-Language: fr-FR\n&gt; \n&gt;     HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n&gt; \n&gt; This feels much better to me, but although the HTTP spec does not \n&gt; prohibit this (Content-Language is an entity header) I cannot find \n&gt; any references to any implementation of such behaviour.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
