Call me\n&gt; dumb,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what to do if I am not using AtomPub but self-made service (like a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; web shop\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; application)? How to do it then? For example, if I am writing a web\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shop, an\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that one allows to place an order using a POST. How to tell a\n&gt; client\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; shall use that POST? I mean, *where* to put that information in a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; technical\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sense?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In the specification of the media type (or link relation etc.) you\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; using.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you do not have something like that, that specifies the semantics\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your application[1] nobody can code a client that can interact with\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; application. Unless the client is ultimately driven by a human.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok, so let me provide an example: The media type used is based on\n&gt; XML, and I\n&gt; &gt; am using XSL to define it&#39;s structure\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you mean by that? Ah, you meant XSD, yes?\n\nTypo, sorry. Yes, obviously I meant XSD (I am using XSL a lot so my finger\ntype &quot;L&quot; automatically).\n \n&gt; &gt; (special, proporietary MIME e. g.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;application/inspectionplan+xml&quot;. Maybe my XSD knowledge is not good\n&gt; enough,\n&gt; &gt; but how do I define the http method now to be used for a particular\n&gt; &gt; operation? I mean, actually, not theoretically, in machine-readable\n&gt; form,\n&gt; &gt; not in human-readable specs?\n&gt; \n&gt; You do not need a machine readable form.\n\nIf the specification is only human readable, I do not see much of a benefit\nin HATEOAS at all: If the client will only be able to communicate with my\nparticlar implementation of a web shop (for example), in contrast to working\nwith *all* kinds of shops on the basis of some generic machine-readble\nstandard business vocabulary, then HATEOAS will not work. Why? Because\nHATEOAS implies that one (even a machine) can browse to *any* URI provided\nin the response of the previous call. So that is not guaranteed now, as it\nwill be impossible to redirect the client to a foreign site, if I (the\nserver vendor providing the URI) cannot guarantee that every client knows\nabout the particular use of http methods by that referenced site. So to make\nthe complete system of &quot;machine web&quot; work, I would have to provide\ninformation on virtually every external service to virtually each client.\nHow should I know of either? This is impossible.\n\nWhat would solve the problem would be a machine readable form that defines\nin a unique syntax what methods will have which meaning. Such descriptions\nare existing, like WADL. So what is missing is two things: (a) WADL must be\na standard, (b) It must be standardized where and how to get the WADL. If\nboth is provided, it won&#39;t be any problem anymore that *any* client knows\nhow to interprete the workflow&#39;s instruction &quot;order this car&quot; if it\nunderstands the MIME type of &quot;application/car&quot; to get the HATEOAS links out\nof it&#39;s entity, so it the URI of the &quot;order&quot;-titled link, and gets (from the\nWADL) the mapping of &quot;order&quot; to &quot;POST&quot; for example. No human would be\ninvolved in this process, and no human readable specification is needed. The\nonly thing human must tell the client is that it is part of a supply chain\nmanagement solution and shall issue &quot;order&quot; on a provided URI (here: the\ncar).\n\nI you just rely on defining human readable specifications, you just move the\nhuman to an early stage, but you don&#39;t get rid of him. But actually, the\ndifference between WWW and REST (shortly spoken) is that the first is about\nhumans, while the latter -in the sense we discuss it here- is about\nmachines. So to make it work completely (not just in part) and globally, we\nneed to get rid of human and find ways to make machines understand machines\nwithout the need to manually define each single interconnection type, but\nstep forward to global standards. AtomPub is not a solution, as it only is\ndefined for publishing, while we need something on a higher level,\ndescribing *any* kind of business interaction.\n\nRegards\nMarkus\n\n\n"}}
