(latitude/longitude, State Plane\nCoordinates(Easting-ft, Northing-ft), and State Plane Coordinates\n(Easting-meters, Northing-meters). The units are implicit (in our\ncounty) by the numbers received -- if c2 is negative, then it&#39;s\nlatitude and longitude, if c1&gt;2000000, then it&#39;s in feet, etc.\n\nI can see a URI similar to:\nwww.example.com/cgi/locations/2231456.12/456789.2323 that uniquely\nidentifies a spot on the ground -- no problem. That same location\nmight also be called\nwww.example.com/cgi/locations/40.2432342/-81.0980809 if it&#39;s being\nID&#39;ed by latitude/longitude.\n\nBut how do I RESTfully pass a list of coordinates? Do I have to wrap\nthem up as a single resource and then pass that? Or a great, long URI\nincluding all the coordinate pairs? Or am I on the wrong track altogether?\n\nRon\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
