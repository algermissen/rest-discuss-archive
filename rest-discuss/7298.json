I&#39;ve been coming up to speed on REST for a few weeks,\nlurkin=\r\ng on this list and reading anything I can find on the topic, and\nthe xforms=\r\n idea is something that occurred to me as well -- though I\nwasn&#39;t thinking =\r\nspecifically about Atompub.\n\nI was thinking about an alternative approach t=\r\no WSDL (and WADL) that\nwas more in line with what you get from HTML forms. =\r\nFor example, you\ncan GET a resource and receive an HTML representation of t=\r\nhe\nresource&#39;s state along with one or more forms that &quot;describe&quot; how to\nint=\r\neract with the resource you just &quot;GOT&quot; or with other\nrelated/subordinate re=\r\nsources. In short, GETting a resource tells you\nhow to interact with it usi=\r\nng other methods. \n\nIf you&#39;d rather provide (or _also_ provide -- through c=\r\nontent neg.) an\nXML representation of your resource, then you could embed x=\r\nforms in\nyour data. You would need an xforms processor on the client that\na=\r\nllowed code to tweak form controls and submit the form through an API.\n\nSo =\r\ninstead of publishing URIs (or URI templates) and schemas in a\ndescription =\r\nof your resources/service you embed forms in the resource\ncontent. The clie=\r\nnt of the form just has a few simple controls to\ninteract with. The form it=\r\nself contains the logic of how to build the\nXML payload based on the contro=\r\nl settings. When the controls are set\nto the client&#39;s liking, you submit th=\r\ne form. The form itself knows the\nURI it needs to GET/PUT/POST/DELETE to.\n\n=\r\nNote that this mechanism would supplement, not replace, simple links\nembedd=\r\ned in the content... there&#39;s no reason to do anything different\nthere.\n\nYou=\r\n get the simplicity and resilience of the &quot;human focused&quot; HTML web\nbrought =\r\nto the &quot;machine focused&quot; XML web. All you need is an xforms\nprocessor that =\r\ncan be driven via an API... know of any? ;-)\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Hugh Winkler&quot; &lt;hughw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Atompub is missing th=\r\ne chance to drive web services in the\n&gt; right direction.  An Atompub server=\r\n should drive interaction with\n&gt; clients using forms, to indicate to the cl=\r\nient what data the server\n&gt; needs, and can accept.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atom entry document=\r\ns were originally designed to deliver information\n&gt; to clients. Using them =\r\nto introduce information to the server raises\n&gt; some issues that working gr=\r\noup has mostly resolved; but these issues\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be issues if Atom serv=\r\ners behaved like web servers serving\n&gt; HTML forms to humans.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example: =\r\nthe group spent some cycles deciding, Who sets atom:id? Must\n&gt; the server p=\r\nreserve it if the client submits it? Hey -- it&#39;s a\n&gt; required element... sh=\r\nould we require clients to submit invalid\n&gt; documents? etc. etc. This would=\r\nn&#39;t be much of an issue if the client\n&gt; first retrieved a form from the ser=\r\nver, and the server either\n&gt; requested that information or didn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ano=\r\nther one: Any feature of the Atom &quot;data model&quot; that doesn&#39;t exactly\n&gt; confo=\r\nrm to the server&#39;s model. My server knows about exactly one\n&gt; author for a =\r\ndocument. What do I do if you POST me an entry  having\n&gt; multiple authors a=\r\nnd some contributors too? And how can I tell you I\n&gt; don&#39;t support those ex=\r\ntra authors, so you can display the proper UI?\n&gt; If you had initially reque=\r\nsted the form from me, I would have only\n&gt; permitted you to submit one auth=\r\nor and no contributors. In your UI you\n&gt; would gray out the extra fields my=\r\n server doesn&#39;t support.\n&gt; \n&gt; A forms pattern would also permit us to evolv=\r\ne the document format\nsafely.\n&gt; \n&gt; The forms here would be Xform models. Ba=\r\nsically they are empty XML\n&gt; templates for the client to fill out. They&#39;re =\r\nnot perfect, but good\n&gt; enough for this job, standardized, and XML friendly=\r\n. You would GET the\n&gt; form from the link rel=3D&quot;edit&quot; URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am airing=\r\n this out on this list because I recognize it&#39;s late in the\n&gt; day for Atomp=\r\nub, and because I also think a reaction to this idea on\n&gt; the WG would be, =\r\nHuh? And then, You mean parse a form programatically?\n&gt; Seriously? Dude, I =\r\nhave some blog software to finish.\n&gt; \n&gt; (This mail mostly just embellishes =\r\non [1].)\n&gt; \n&gt; Interested to hear what you all think, esp. the lurking Atomp=\r\nubbers.\n&gt; (Don&#39;t see any history of this idea on the Wiki)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hugh\n&gt; \n&gt; [=\r\n1] http://hughw.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-atompub-superfluous.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
