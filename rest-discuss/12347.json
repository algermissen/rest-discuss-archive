Is there anyone in the  \nSouthern California area (local is better, since there&#39;s no travel  \nbudget) who would be interested in helping NASA&#39;s future data  \narchitectures be fully informed by REST and webarch? Please contact  \nAllan Doyle &lt;adoyle@...&gt; if you&#39;re interested in  \nspeaking.\n\nWiki page: http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/SPG_Agenda_July_7_2009\n\n From the wiki:\n\nOne role of the NASA Earth Science Data Systems Standards Process  \nGroup (SPG) http://www.esdswg.net/spg is to develop a growing list of  \nstable, operationally ready standards; as well as a body of technical  \nnotes related to implementation of standards, including specifications  \nand practices that could develop into standards.\n\nThe SPG is often called upon within NASA for information and advice  \nregarding specs, standards, and practices that are likely to have a  \nlarge impact on NASA&#39;s internal data management processes as well as  \non NASA&#39;s role as a partner to international activities such as CEOS  \nand GEO/GEOSS.\n\nThe SPG traditionally chooses a topic of interest as a theme for a  \ntechnical information exchange session at each of its meetings.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 7, 2009, at the University of California, Santa  \nBarbara, the SPG will host a technical session to investigate the  \ntopic of web services as it relates to Earth science data management.  \nOur goal is to investigate and provide answers to these questions:\n\n    1. What is the current state of the art in web services in this  \ncontext? Are there specifications, standards, or practices about which  \nthe SPG should be seeking out RFC submissions? State of the art might  \nimply that there is not yet widespread operational use, but that such  \nuse is likely to occur in the future.\n    2. What is being used in production environments? For those web  \nservice specifications and practices that are in widespread,  \noperational use, which ones should be entered into the SPG process?\n    3. What experiments and trials are being done using new ideas or  \nnew ways of using existing ideas? Are there activities that could be  \ndocumented as tech notes so that potential adopters can be made aware  \nof them?\n\nCurrent leading-edge activities in this area suggest that existing OGC  \nspecifications and Service Oriented Architectures based on UDDI, WSDL,  \nSOAP, etc. are mismatched with emerging architectural patterns such as  \nREST. How can the SPG help discern a pathway that will enable  \nconstruction of robust, interoperable data systems?\n\nWe would like to invite speakers knowledgeable about this topic in  \nthis context to present their work during a technical session,  \nfollowed by a round table discussion answering the questions posed  \nabove.\n[edit] Speakers\n\nPlease contact Allan Doyle &lt;adoyle@...&gt; if you&#39;re  \ninterested in speaking. We&#39;ll update the list below as people are added.\n\n     * Allan Doyle, NASA SPG - session leader, and introduction\n     * Karl Benedict - Director, Earth Data Analysis Center, UNM\n\n\n--\nSean Gillies\nSoftware Engineer\nInstitute for the Study of the Ancient World\nNew York University\n\n\n"}}
