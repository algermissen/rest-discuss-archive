Thanks for the reply.\n   \n&gt; First, why the resource is &quot;at&quot; one=\r\n server. It should be location-less, or in IT words &quot;shared&quot;. Second, a res=\r\nource may have all the URIs you want, or that it needs, that is not a restr=\r\niction.\n\nSorry - I don&#39;t understand this! =3D0(\n\n&gt; Third, I plenty support =\r\nthat resources are locatable and accessible by any node in a network, and R=\r\nEST is for networking systems, so I don&#39;t see why is there a restriction fo=\r\nr servers to be clients.\n\nGood... I think... !\n\n&gt; Now, as FOREST to be a pa=\r\nttern and not an style, means it is applicable to tactic design. That means=\r\n it is local, and thus may not be applicable to the whole system. In fact, =\r\nas you actually go into details of implementation, it IS a pattern.\n\nNo - i=\r\nt&#39;s a whole-system Pattern. If Patterns have to be local, then I have to st=\r\nop calling it a Pattern. Any ideas? &#39;Sub-style&#39;? Ug.\n\n&gt; What I mean is that=\r\n your REST applications may contain parts implemented using FOREST and othe=\r\nrs using other patterns. Thus, you need:\n&gt; 1. Identify the context where yo=\r\nur pattern can be used (as the title suggest, cases where we need integrati=\r\non may be).\n\nYah - Enterprise Mashups! =3D0)\n\n&gt; 2. Identify the particular =\r\nproblem it is solving.\n\nOK - this is tricky, because I think it has a very =\r\nwide applicability. It may even satisfy /all/ your Integration Needs! =3D0)=\r\n\n   \n&gt; 3. You already defined the solution, even getting down to propose im=\r\nplementation.\n\nWait till I write the FOREST prototype for Jetty... \n\nI&#39;m go=\r\ning to call it &quot;a type of FOREST that begins with &#39;J&#39; - for Java&quot;: &#39;Jungle&#39;=\r\n! =3D0)\n\n&gt; 4. List the consequences of applying it.\n\nKa-ching! $$ Profit!! =\r\n=3D0)  \n\nCan&#39;t really say this until I&#39;ve got some real-world experience of=\r\n applying &#39;Jungle&#39; and the FOREST Pattern/Sub-Style.\n\n&gt; Will read it again,=\r\n trying to understand each bit.\n\nThanks - again, I really appreciate the fe=\r\nedback.. If it resonates with you (or anyone else) I&#39;d be really happy to e=\r\nxplore the ideas with you, and to be challenged on the details.\n\nDuncan Cra=\r\ngg\n \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve expanded a little on the motivation behind FOREST in this blog=\r\n post:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/forest-get-only-rest-integra=\r\ntion-pattern/\n\n\n\n"}}
