Just wondering if others had come across this before and \nwhat their experience was.\n\n&gt;  &gt; There is a domain model on the server which interprets and executes \n&gt; this and all the domain logic around it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t one approach just to use ROA but when its a PUT you take the \n&gt; incoming representation, work out what commands to apply based on it, \n&gt; and then apply those to the domain model?\n\nThat would seem to lose the &quot;why is this being sent&quot; part of CQS, and \nmake it more data-driven, which I don&#39;t want.\n\n&gt; You might also be interested in this thread of posts, I think some of \n&gt; them cover messaging over REST type designs:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/distributed-observer-pattern-rest-dialogues/ \n&gt; &lt;http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/distributed-observer-pattern-rest-dialogues/&gt;\n\nThanks for the links! I&#39;ll look them over.\n\nthanks, Rickard\n\n\n"}}
