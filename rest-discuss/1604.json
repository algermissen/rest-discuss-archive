You do not mean \n&gt; transaction\n&gt; &gt; in the sense of requiring &quot;a group of operations on (distributed)\n&gt; &gt; resources be treated as one unit of work. In a unit of work, all the\n&gt; &gt; participating operations should either succeed or fail and recover\n&gt; &gt; together.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, but I *do* mean a unit of work, in the sense of two trading \n&gt; partners coming to agreement on advancing a business deal to the next \n&gt; state.  Each business transaction succeeds or fails as a whole.\n\nExactly right.  I do consider this a transaction.  The problem with it\nas discussed so far, is that it isn&#39;t composable with itself, so it\nwill only ever be good for this one task.\n\nSo I think what&#39;s here is a useful start, but isn&#39;t yet the kind of\nthing I would call a &quot;building block&quot;.  It needs something more.\n\nUnfortunately I&#39;m no transaction guru.  But I&#39;ve got an email from\nMark Little in my inbox that I should get to - perhaps he has some\nideas.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In cases where the Response document says &quot;Accept&quot; but has an \n&gt; error,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the error message from the requesting business service cannot \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delivered, the transaction model specifies a separate \n&gt; Notification of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Failure to be sent from the requesting business service via \n&gt; another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; channel.  Otherwise the responding activity may think incorrectly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the transaction succeeded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see, so otherwise it is to assume the transaction succeeded if it\n&gt; &gt; returns an Accept, whether it gets a receipt or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, it would be a bad assumption, but the end state is ambiguous, \n&gt; and ambiguities are what sometimes end up in court.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this yet.  How can a response document say &quot;Accept&quot;\nbut have an error?  And if, for the sake of argument we assume that&#39;s\nok, then shouldn&#39;t it be part of the contract that the &quot;Acceptee&quot;\ncatch up to state (GET) prior to proceeding with any further work?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
