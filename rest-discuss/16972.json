The main =\r\nadvantage as I see it is that they will have\n&gt; less to learn and that we wi=\r\nll will converge on a more stable set of\n&gt; relations which in turn will mak=\r\ne it possible to create more generic\n&gt; code for indexing, crawling etc. Jus=\r\nt make sure you create and define\n&gt; your own rel types according to the ato=\r\nm spec [2].\n\nPersonally i don&#39;t much like atom:link.  It trades clarity for=\r\n a false\npromise of re-use.  The idea that a great deal of leverage will be=\r\n\ngained by reusing atom:link in other formats seems not be born out in\nreal=\r\nity.  Parsing arbitrary xml documents, looking for link elements\nand then d=\r\noing things with them without understanding the semantics of\nthe overall re=\r\npresentation sounds pretty far fetched to me.  (Is that\nedit link for the r=\r\nequested resource, or is it for a different\nresource whose information is c=\r\nontained in the requested one.)\n\nThe `&lt;{name} href=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt;` pattern promotes=\r\n the meaningful name of the\nitem to the highest possible level.  This incre=\r\nases the clarity of the\nrepresentation.  As a client writer i care about se=\r\nmantics of the\nvarious parts of the representations far more than i care ab=\r\nout their\ntypes.  I can guess with little effort that an element named &#39;edi=\r\nt&#39;\nwill contain a link.  With a link element i must scan to the right\nuntil=\r\n i find the @rel in order to understand the purpose of the\nelement.  I&#39;ll t=\r\nake clarity over vague, unrealistic, promises of\nre-use any day.\n\nBesides, =\r\nwe have the link header[1] which is better, in every\nimaginable way, than a=\r\ntom:link for expressing common relations.  It\ndoes not require the client b=\r\ne able to parse a particular format and\nit unambiguously relates the link t=\r\no the requested resource as a\nwhole.\n\n[1]: &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5=\r\n988&gt;\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
