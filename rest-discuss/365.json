Ordinary callbacks are like SMTP. No\nmore or less secure. No paranoia.\n\n&quot;Secure&quot; callbacks are created ONLY on a persistent connection created\nfrom the client to the server, potentially using SSL.\n\nLet&#39;s face it, that&#39;s corporate America&#39;s definition of secure\nbehind-the-firewall software. Outgoing is secure. Incoming is insecure.\nSo secure callbacks would work just like MSN messenger or ICQ or\nNapster, you turn the thing on, it &quot;calls home&quot; and opens a connection.\n\nInsofar as the client knows what server it has contacted, the security\nrequirements are much lower. After all, Web browsers have historically\nbeen terribly insecure but the practical damage caused by them is low\nbecause the end-user controls what sites he/she contacts. So\naccountability is pretty good (&quot;here&#39;s the URL of the site that deleted\nmy hard drive&quot;) and it is really hard to get a million users to come to\nyour site and download your virus.\n\nThe care and thought put into your PSP won&#39;t mean squat to a corporate\nsysadmin. And on reflection I do think that practically speaking,\nunidirectional connections provide more safety than paranoid protocol\nimplementations. And anyhow, it is pretty easy to set up a single\nunidirectional connection to your &quot;event server&quot; on the Web and let it\nhandle the security crap for you.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
