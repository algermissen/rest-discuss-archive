If you  \ntry to argue with a customer that what they want to see protected is  \nnot confidential at all, you&#39;ve already lost the argument :-)\n\nStill, I believe the &quot;best&quot; answer is that REST (or at least HTTP)  \nrelies on identifiers that are not secrets. If your identifiers are  \n(or you consider them to be) secret, don&#39;t use them as URIs.\n\nMy personal favorite solution would be to create a new resource  \nrepresenting an application-specific &quot;account&quot; via posting the credit  \ncard number, and return a non-meaningful URI for that newly created  \n(and reasonably protected) resource.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\nOn Jan 22, 2007, at 12:56 AM, Bill de hOra wrote:\n\n&gt; Elliotte Harold wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can see arguments on both sides of the question.
