We keep talking about reach, b=\r\nut most (if\n&gt; not all?) media types were designed for a specific client. \n\n=\r\nOr clients. Atom has reach because lots of systems out there already unders=\r\ntand how to process it.\n\napplication/vnd.restbucks+xml does not have reach =\r\nbecause there aren&#39;t many systems out there that understand it. Nor are the=\r\nre lots of libraries to choose from on lots of platforms that implement the=\r\n processing model for that type. But it does have the advantage that it wor=\r\nks really well for coffee ordering within the Restbucks domain.\n\nJim\n\n\n"}}
