Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n&gt; see if anyone has added anything new since\n&gt; the last time I checked the folder.\nIf &#39;checking&#39; is both safe and idempotent, you will have to explicitly mark\nmessages as being viewed/processed/whatever.\nYou could do this many ways - send a &#39;mark all inbox items&#39;, send a list of\nitems to mark, assign URIs to each item & mark each inbox item, etc..\n\n&gt; Any thoughts on how to solve this without forcing\n&gt; the client to GET the entire folder each time?\nIf you mark items as being processed, this can move them to a separate\ncollection - the &#39;viewed&#39; list or the &#39;deleted&#39; list or whatever.\nThen when you check for new messages, the &#39;inbox&#39; list will be empty when\nthere are no new messages.\nYou will always need to check periodically, but the response can be empty\nwhich cuts down on data transfer.\n\nI think this is similar to the &#39;model a message queue with HTTP&#39; discussion\nof a few months ago....\n\n"}}
