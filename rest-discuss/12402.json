This is where I realised pain\nwith my first tradeoff between graceful degradation of a web rendering\nand adherence to REST since I can&#39;t take PUT or DELETE headers in my\nUpdate and Delete actions without using Ajax on the View itself.\n\nI have had to default to the Microsoft method of using POST in a bad\nway as the substitute for PUT and DELETE headers, but the intention is\nin a subsequent iteration to redo them using their proper PUT and\nDELETE headers implemented by Ajax, at least until HTML5 becomes the\nstandard. (Thanks Alan Dean for that tweetful bit of info)\n\nI&#39;m currently struggling with &#39;groking&#39; other REST concepts in\npreparation for a new iteration, since it&#39;s not enough for me to just\nunderstand as I need to bring the rest of my development team on board\nwith my proposals at every step (believe me, it was a challenge to get\nthem to accept the simplicity of re-engineering our awfully\novercomplex Controllers to be Resource-oriented, and use Golden Seven\nactions as default).\n\nIs a web resource available that members know about that help someone\nlike me understand the challenges involved in getting an ASP.NET web\napplication  (specifically an ASP.Net MVC app) conforming to the\narchitectural style that is REST?\n\nI went through the mailing list archives looking for any past threads\non this without success.\n-- \nNissan Dookeran\nhttp://redditech.blogspot.com\nhttp://redditech.wordpress.com\n----\n&quot;Find a problem.
