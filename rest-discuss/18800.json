It may be worth adding it as an example.\n\nthanks for the pointer to web finger. i am sure there are quite a number \nof other formats out there using html profiles, maybe it would be \ninteresting to create a small list of &quot;well-known&quot; profiles.\n\n&gt; I would also suggest to emphasize the usage on the &quot;type&quot; attribute together with this link rel to better characterize the type of information a client should expect. Indeed I would expect in some cases more than one of such &quot;profile&quot; link rel to be published within the same document, and the type may be useful for this. E.g. so far in wf the http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page and http://microformats.org/profile/hcard (and to some extent the http://portablecontacts.net/spec/1.0#me) rel types are widely used to discriminate the expect type of &quot;profile&quot; format/info accessible. It would be valuable to maintain such flexibility.\n\nwhile i think that the &quot;type&quot; idea is interesting, i am confused that \nyou suggest http://microformats.org/profile/hcard as such a type. \nafaict, hCard is a specific profile and does not define a format for \ndescribing profiles. i would expect types to define a framework that \ncould be used to define specific profiles, but maybe we have a different \nidea of what a &quot;type&quot; attribute could do? could you explain why you \nconsider http://microformats.org/profile/hcard to be a type instead of a \nspecific profile?\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
