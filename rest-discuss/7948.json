Just being RESTful\n&gt; isn&#39;t enough to encourage widespread adoption. Yay: there&#39;s no verb in\n&gt; the message. Yay, they obey HTTP method semantics. Apart from that they\n&gt; both wrap a document in an envelope. As long as servers and clients have\n&gt; to agree ahead of time on complete document semantics they&#39;re forcing\n&gt; one another to lock in code at development time&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I see Hugh is beating up on APP again. Hopefully we&#39;ll see him on the WG\n&gt; for last call &quot;adding future business value&quot;.\n\nI guess I am beating up on it, and unfairly. I&#39;m raising topics here,\nnot on Atompub, because it&#39;s late in the APP cycle, the forms idea is\nnot baked, and the envelope thing might have been a good issue to\nraise two years ago.\n\nUnfairly, because it&#39;s like I&#39;ve been scolding the dog for doing a bad\njob mowing the yard (an old Far Side cartoon). APP is going to work\ngreat for blogging clients, and for GData which will be widely\nadopted.\n\n&gt;The last part by the way\n&gt; about complete document semantics simply isn&#39;t true if your document\n&gt; semantics are based on model theoretic semantics - the agents\n&gt; communities have been slinging documents back and forth for years\n&gt; without been tied to runtimes. It&#39;s just that programming to a model\n&gt; theory is esoteric compared to switch-on-type; programmers generally\n&gt; won&#39;t roll with it.\n&gt;\n\nWell, yeah. We really need to find a way to make it practical to do\nreasoning over these tags. It&#39;s hard because: there are lots of\ndefinitions, the definitions are not centrally located, and even if\nyou get them all in one place, reasoning over them is a massive\nprogram in itself. So I think to make it practical, programs have to\ncall a service to do it for them.\n\nIf we don&#39;t address that issue, web services will be stuck forever.\nEach integration will be painful and time consuming. As now.\n\n&gt; But I&#39;ll say this - the first thing to do here is compare and contrast\n&gt; the minimal Atom document with SOAP&#39;s before trashing Atom. I did the\n&gt; minimal SOAP envelope years ago and that strongly influenced a\n&gt; professional commitment not to deploy on it for clients.  Atom at least\n&gt; makes you say something.\n&gt;\n\nFair enough.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;   Atom is more like REST&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; (someone&#39;s?) alternative to RDF.\n&gt;\n&gt; RDF has characteristics that make it better than Atom (or any such\n&gt; XML/XHTML format) as an interlingua, but isn&#39;t quite structured enough\n&gt; as a format. That means to support RDF you tend to end up interfering\n&gt; with backend application storage to support the flexibility (IME). You\n&gt; can sink a lot of money doing that. Because Atom is less flexible it&#39;s\n&gt; easier to tie down wrt OO domain and relational backends. The only\n&gt; highly generic thing you need to support across domain types are tags,\n&gt; and there are some decent many 2 many table models you can use for that now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is to say, it compliments a\n&gt; &gt; growing family of standard document types that can be included in each\n&gt; &gt; other, and can be extended for domain-specific uses without inventing a\n&gt; &gt; whole new vocabulary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; RDF builds an abstract metamodel and expects vocabularies to fill the\n&gt; &gt; rest of the gaps. Successful formats to date have taken a different\n&gt; &gt; approach of defining vocabulary and document structure together.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would add also that successful formats have left format semantics in\n&gt; code rather than using declarative/model techniques. Elliotte has\n&gt; historically had a good basic stance on why this gets deployed over\n&gt; shared formal _models_.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see the aggregation and sub-classing features of XML as the core of\n&gt; &gt; the semantic web going forwards. I think this is a more fully-featured\n&gt; &gt; way of representing data than rigid RDF.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure. I think linking and tagging are the way forward, and\n&gt; the person who persuades people to go with prefix conventions for tag\n&gt; labels instead of full URIs as RDF/semweb does, will win.\n&gt;No-one uses\n&gt; &quot;dc:&quot; in XML for anything other than Dublin core.\n&gt;\n\nYes, the web is voting, and they are not even using prefixes, much\nless URIs or RDF.\n\n&gt; cheers\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n\n"}}
