It was more of an example than a suggestion.  :)\n&gt; However, have any other applications/specifications out there adopted this\n&gt; same format?  I could certainly role something for my own use\n&gt; (and may still\n&gt; do so).  However, I&#39;d much rather use a common/general-purpose format\n&gt; instead of borrow one that&#39;s not intended for use outside of the\n&gt; specification in which it&#39;s defined.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seairth\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Julian Reschke&quot; &lt;julian.reschke@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;; &quot;rest-discuss&quot;\n&gt; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 31, 2003 10:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [rest-discuss] HTTP 4xx response entities\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, July 31, 2003 3:01 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] HTTP 4xx response entities\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or it could be simplified to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, this is a RFC that is already implemented by many servers, so it&#39;s\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; likely to change.
