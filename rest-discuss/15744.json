Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; Mike Kelly wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense that you can&#39;t violate the =\r\nidentification of resources\n&gt;&gt; constraint within a specific system, like th=\r\ne web, that implements\n&gt;&gt; Uniform Resource Identifiers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Failure to=\r\n use URIs to identify resources, is not a violation of the\n&gt; identification=\r\n of resources constraint. =A0Failure to identify resources\n&gt; within your sy=\r\nstem by assigning them identifiers, violates the\n&gt; constraint.\n\nCool, so /r=\r\nepresentations/ without identifiers don&#39;t violate the constraint?\n\nI think =\r\nyou&#39;ve already agreed that the choice to expose the\nrepresentations as reso=\r\nurces in their own right is a matter of\njudgement/pragmatism/&quot;best-practice=\r\n&quot;, so my assumption was that\nchoosing one way or another is beyond REST - i=\r\nt seems to me that it&#39;s\neven beyond HTTP, since all the control data for de=\r\nscribing\ndiscrepancies in server side &#39;selection&#39; of variants already exist=\r\n in\n2616.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why you think that all variants must also be reso=\r\nurces in their own\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If a resource varies betwee=\r\nn HTML and Atom representations, then\n&gt;&gt; &gt; those two variants, taken separa=\r\ntely, must have some abstract\n&gt;&gt; &gt; definition that is different from one an=\r\nother, and is also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different from the abstract definition of the negot=\r\niated resource\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whose URI they share.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, they have the *same* ab=\r\nstract definition - which is the reason\n&gt;&gt; they are identified as represent=\r\nations of a resource that can be\n&gt;&gt; negotiated, and not completely independ=\r\nent resources.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Two variants have the same abstract definition, if th=\r\ney share a URI.\n&gt; This does not restrict those variants from each having an=\r\n infinite\n&gt; number of other possible abstractions. =A0Applying the identifi=\r\ncation of\n&gt; resources constraint, consists of assigning identifiers to any =\r\nother\n&gt; abstractions important to the system.\n\nPresumably the answer to &quot;Wh=\r\nat constitutes an important abstraction&quot;\nis arbitrary? Particularly from a =\r\nREST pov\n\n&gt; When you are varying media types (or anything besides compressi=\r\non), the\n&gt; abstractions of each variant of /concept as a specific media typ=\r\ne (i.e.\n&gt; /concept.atom and /concept.html as &#39;concept as Atom and only Atom=\r\n&#39; and\n&gt; &#39;concept as HTML and only HTML&#39;) are important to the system, and a=\r\nre\n&gt; different from &#39;concept as varying media type&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This holds true wh=\r\nether you assign URIs to identify these additional\n&gt; resources, or not. =A0=\r\nYour counter to this, is to keep insisting that\n&gt; once you&#39;ve declared a ne=\r\ngotiated resource, its variants are not\n&gt; allowed to be representations of =\r\nany other resource, regardless of how\n&gt; many times it&#39;s pointed out to you =\r\nthat REST explicitly endorses this\n&gt; very behavior (author&#39;s preferred vers=\r\nion).\n\nNo, the only thing I&#39;ve insisted is that identifying representations=\r\n\nas resources is a *cost* to visibility - i.e. it should be treated as\nsuch=\r\n and either afforded or overcome where /necessary/.\n\n&gt; The only thing you c=\r\nan accomplish by dragging this debate out, is\n&gt; exposing flaws in one expla=\r\nnation or another that I&#39;ve posited, which\n&gt; does not change the best pract=\r\nice of assigning URIs to variants like\n&gt; RFC 2616 says you SHOULD.\n\nIn whic=\r\nh case let&#39;s continue since your explanation appears flawed,\nand this isn&#39;t=\r\n HTTP-discuss.\n\n&gt; IOW, I&#39;m not arguing that assigning URIs to variants *sho=\r\nuld* be best\n&gt; practice. =A0I&#39;m explaining *why* it *is* best practice. =A0=\r\nRejecting my\n&gt; explanations will not change established best practice. =A0N=\r\nor will\n&gt; failing to explain how this best practice violates REST -- insist=\r\ning\n&gt; that a variant can only have one URI, that of the negotiated resource=\r\n,\n&gt; goes against REST completely.\n\nHopefully I haven&#39;t said &#39;best practice&#39;=\r\n violates REST. One of my main\nissues in this discussion is that it&#39;s basic=\r\nally subjective and\ndependent on the system in question; i.e. it&#39;s nothing =\r\nto do with\nREST.\n\nI&#39;ve also said that not assigning URIs to representations=\r\n doesn&#39;t\nviolate any REST constraints. Primarily because it doesn&#39;t.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; The difference between an Atom and HTML representation is *not*\n&gt;&gt; abstr=\r\nact at all Eric, that is why you are able to transform via XSLT\n&gt;&gt; from Ato=\r\nm to HTML.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t make heads or tails out of that statement. =A0How=\r\n do you get from\n&gt; my statement that variants have multiple abstractions, t=\r\no a claim that\n&gt; the differences between variants are abstract? =A0If anyth=\r\ning, I&#39;ve\n&gt; pointed out that the differences between &quot;concept as HTML and o=\r\nnly HTML&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;concept as Atom and only Atom&quot; are anything but abstract.\n=\r\n\n\nWhen I read &quot;If a resource varies between HTML and Atom\nrepresentations, =\r\nthen those two variants, taken separately, must have\nsome abstract definiti=\r\non that is different from one another&quot; I\nconcluded that the definitions are=\r\n abstract, the definitions are\ndifferent, therefore the difference is abstr=\r\nact.\n\n\n&gt; Atom and HTML variants may represent the same concept when taken\n&gt;=\r\n together, but when taken separately they also represent other concepts.\n\nT=\r\naking them separately is a subjective judgement. All I&#39;m saying is\ndoing th=\r\nat reduces visibility in your system and is therefore a cost\nthat is worth =\r\nbeing aware of.\n\n&gt; A failure to recognize that these variants also represen=\r\nt other\n&gt; resources, by identifying those resources, is a failure to apply =\r\nthe\n&gt; identification of resources constraint. =A0Period.\n\nPeriod? Well that=\r\n settles it then.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
