I recommend the specification of a media type specific to your domain. That media type should provide the means for the necessary hypermedia controls (along the lines of application/atom+xml and application/atomsrv+xml).\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually a wadl file should have it&#39;s own mime type (does it have one?) but it seem quite good as hypertext language as far as the client can handle it (through, for example, some code on demand).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not considering it a tool to generate such code (even if it would be possible, and as far as the code is downloaded with the wadl, still restful), but just a simple and clean way to connect the resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seem to me that nothing restfully wrong to use an alternative hypertext language instead of html, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Giacomo \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
