I would put it differently.\n&gt;\n&gt; A language is mathematically defined as something like the following:\n&gt; a syntax + a semantics [1].\n&gt;\n  A language is a grammar.  If by semantics, you mean the rules for  \nconstructing valid sentences in the language (i.e. tree grammar,  \nregular grammar, etc.) then I agree, but if by semantics you mean  \n&quot;meaning,&quot; then we&#39;re heading into deep waters.  Languages don&#39;t have  \nmeanings.  Constructs in a language MAY have a meaning.  So, these  \ntwo sets (all linguistically correct sentences and all meaningful  \nsentences)  have all different size and shouldn&#39;t be mixed.\n&gt; XML is original with respect to other language such as Java, JSON,\n&gt; etc, in that\n&gt; - it defines a syntax, without defining the semantics,\nThis is wrong, regardless of the meaning of semantics used  \npreviously.  Clearly XML has a grammar (referring to the first  \nmeaning of &quot;semantics&quot;; the second meaning doesn&#39;t even apply).\n&gt; - it uses URIs as name space identifiers [2]\n&gt;\n&gt; RDF/XML gives a semantics to subset of XML documents. The linking of\n&gt; RDF and XML is attractive, because RDF is a semantics without a\n&gt; syntax, and XML is a syntax without semantics, and both use URI\n&gt; identifiers. Whether RDF/XML is the best way to do this mapping or\n&gt; not is a good question. It works close to XML writers intuitions, but\n&gt; perhaps it is not close enough. There are other proposals on the\n&gt; table such as TRiX that make the syntax reflect more closely the\n&gt; semantics.\nI haven&#39;t checked out TRiX.\n\nBTW, does RDF support hypergraphs (i.e. edges that connect many  \nnodes)?  Mapping hypergraphs to graphs is a bit tedious.\n&gt;\n&gt; Henry\n&gt;\n&gt; PS. I add a few comments to your text below\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] see the image on the blog http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/\n&gt; answers_to_duck_typing_done\n&gt; &quot;anwsers to duck typing done right&quot; which shows graphically how\n&gt; syntax and semantics are related\n&gt; [2] see &quot;Duck Typing Done right&quot;\n&gt; http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/duck_typing_done_right\n&gt; for an explanation as to why using URIs is a big improovement\n&gt; over what other languages have to offer\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
