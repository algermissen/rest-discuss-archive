Lots \nof good questions! I&#39;m not sure if this list is the best place to \ndiscuss a specific framework (see our specific mailing lists: \nhttp://www.restlet.org/community/lists) but I&#39;ll reply here anyway:\n\nThe org.restlet.Restlet class can be thought as the equivalent of the \njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class indeed. It offers a much more \ncomplete and abstracted view of the underlying HTTP model than in \nServlet world though (HTTP headers are mostly hidden for example). The \nframework goes beyond Servlet by offering many subclasses such as \nFilter, Router, Redirector, Authenticator, etc. See this diagram from \nthe tutorial:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/tutorial#conclusion\n\nRestlet is also both a client-side and server-side framework, with \nconnectors for other (pseudo-)protocols than just HTTP and HTTPS, like \nSMTP, POP3, FILE, etc. See complete features list:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/about/features\n\nWhen the Servlet API was designed, REST concepts weren&#39;t formalized and \nunderstood as today, so the mapping isn&#39;t perfect. In Restlet, each \nmajor REST concept has an equivalent class such as the Connector, \nComponent, Representation classes or the Uniform Java interface. You \nmight be interested to read our introduction paper which explains the \ngenesis of the Restlet API and the relationship to the Servlet API:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/about/introduction\n\nNow, the equivalent of a REST resource in Restlet (version 2.0) are the \nServerResource and the ClientResource classes, extending a base \nUniformResource. They are the closest materialization of a specific REST \nresource you can find. Each instance of a ServerResource for example is \nassociated to a specific target URI reference. This paper an example of \nresources development:\nhttp://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/firstResource\n\nRegarding our extension of ADO.NET Data Services, it has two parts. An \noptional generator mechanism (Generator class) and a runtime layer \n(Query and Session classes). This API uses ClientResource underneath to \nissue RESTful HTTP call to a remote ADO.NET Data Services. In our \ninteroperability scenario, Restlet is the client-side and ADO.NET DS is \nthe server-side exposing the RESTful API (based on HTTP and Atom).\n\nI hope it clarifies a bit! :)\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n--\nRestlet ~ Founder and Lead developer ~ http://www.restlet.org\nNoelios Technologies ~ Co-founder ~ http://www.noelios.com\n\n\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares a ï¿½crit :\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dilip posted a news item at InfoQ  \n&gt; &lt;http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/09/restlet-extension-micorosoft&gt;about a \n&gt; RESTFul bridge between Java and .NET ADO.\n&gt; It brought to my memory the Restlet project, something I came across \n&gt; when looking for REST in Java  solutions.\n&gt; Mostly like a servlet, it provides semantics for several REST concepts. \n&gt; Still, I can&#39;t conceptually understand what the Restlet stands for. \n&gt; Documentation does not aid either, since the first pages I read does not \n&gt; explain technically much of it, just tells you in big words what it \n&gt; does: support REST using java.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me explain: a servlet is a little process that is mapped to one or \n&gt; several URLs, and it usually creates, dynamically, a page to show. Now, \n&gt; what does the restlet represent? Is it a resource? Does it fit with the \n&gt; REST constrains?\n&gt; \n&gt; And more related to the post: The so called bridge is just a class \n&gt; generator to access remote data using .NET ADO services, meaning I can \n&gt; access that data using the RESTful api created using the RESTLet \n&gt; framework.  I guess the .NET interface is good for java developer that \n&gt; creates the inner guts of a resource, but REST has no business there. \n&gt; Actually, I think it may not be good to think that using RESTlet itself, \n&gt; we can &quot;convert&quot; the .NET ADO api to a RESTfull api.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
