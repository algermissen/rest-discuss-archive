Cookies are an obviously better UI than HTTP-aut=\r\nh.

That really point=\r\ns out the\nissue of security in general; if users really must not see each o=\r\nther&#39;s\npages, the server must require SSL, which prevents proxies along the=\r\n way\nanyway... But in this case, just specifying no-cache would at least\npr=\r\nevent\na proxy from *accidentally* sending one user&#39;s cached page to other\nu=\r\nsers.\n\n&gt; 2. Current user. You should look at recent discussion we had on th=\r\nis\ntopic\n&gt; (identification of resources). You may want to make the URLs of =\r\nthe\nuser\n&gt; pages unguessable. Then users could opt to allow others to read =\r\nthem\nif\n&gt; they so chose (by sending a URL). You then need to decide what th=\r\nese\n&gt; referred users are authorized to do.\n\nAh, I see now this has been a c=\r\nommon topic. I had tried to search the\narchives a bit, but didn&#39;t lurk very=\r\n long. Thanks.\n\n&gt; 3. Menus, etc. You can use PUT. Remember GET retrieves a\n=\r\nrepresentation\n&gt; of the resource. If the PUT is text/plain and the GET has =\r\nan accept:\n&gt; text/plain header, you could assume that the user wants the ed=\r\nitable\n&gt; version of the page and not the rendered version.\n\nBut here&#39;s the =\r\nquestion -- is the page with all that UI cruft\nsurrounding\nthe central cont=\r\nent really just another &quot;representation&quot; of that\ncontent? I\ncan easily acce=\r\npt the original Wiki text and its HTML rendering as two\nrepresentations of =\r\nthe same content resource, but the extra stuff put\naround\nit (menus, logos,=\r\n search forms, last-modified notations, etc.) doesn&#39;t\nfeel\nlike part of the=\r\n same resource.\n\nJustin\n\n"}}
