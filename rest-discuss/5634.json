Like\n&gt; CORB=\r\nA before it, SOAP is designed to extend the Object-Oriented model\n&gt; out ont=\r\no the network. O-O thinking is bound up in application-specific\n&gt; baseclass=\r\nes and function semantics. REST would require all such\n&gt; semantics to be re=\r\nmoved, and only semantics everyone understood to be\n&gt; used.\n\nFound another =\r\ntwo related articles about distributed objects in web services:\n\nhttp://www=\r\n.pacificspirit.com/blog/2004/01/12/web_services_or_distributed_objects\nhttp=\r\n://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2004/11/19/web_services_vs_distributed_object=\r\ns_ii\n\nI just realize there are more articles that tending to separate the\nd=\r\nistributed object concept from web services, but why are we still\nusing SOA=\r\nP, WSDL in an OO way? Is there any examples/tutorials that\ndemonstrate the =\r\nuse of SOAP without OO thinking? Or is it not\npractical in doing so? (Ah, i=\r\nt&#39;s confusing in my head now ;-)\n\n&gt; The document would have to be something=\r\n that could be\n&gt; understood by a range of clients from different industries=\r\n outside the\n&gt; context of the HTTP request to rank as a standard media type=\r\n in my\n&gt; books. That means it would have to &quot;be&quot; something that represents =\r\na\n&gt; fairly universal concept, like &quot;image/*&quot; or &quot;text/*&quot;. The question to\n&gt;=\r\n ask is &quot;could I fit it into the current MIME system without prefixing it\n&gt;=\r\n with application/&quot;?\n\nI get what you mean. But just a minor question, why n=\r\not\n&quot;application/&quot;, since ATOM is registered under &quot;application/atom+xml&quot;?\n\n=\r\n\nCheers,\n--\nTeo HuiMing (toydi)\nteohuiming at gmail dot com\n\n"}}
