This document\nwould start with very simple examples and gradually evolve into more\ncomplex situations (along with explanations why thing should be done\nthat way).\nWhat would be good examples to start with? I was thinking about things\nlike &#39;hello world&#39;, a calculator, an addressbook, a simple chat program.\nIs the REST wiki a good place to start such a document, or should I\nput it on the Ruby wiki? (the document could have different versions\nfor other programming languages as well).\nAny suggestions would be most welcome.\n\n  Erik Terpstra.\n\n\n"}}
