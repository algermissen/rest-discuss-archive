The problem I&#39;m describing is that users would \n&gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; to authenticate at the root of the visible hierarchy, so that pages\n&gt;&gt; which are still accessible but which look different can know the auth\n&gt;&gt; info.  For pages where authentication is optional that makes no sense.\n&gt;\n\nOn Thursday, Feb 5, 2004, at 10:56 America/New_York, Yannick Loiseau \nwrote:\n&gt; this is a different problem that has already benn discussed here. If \n&gt; the\n&gt; pasge is accessible to everybody, but look different for each user, \n&gt; this\n&gt; is not an authentication problem, but a personnalisation or\n&gt; customization, which is not the purpose of http auth.\n\nSo let&#39;s say there are two different application requirements, \nauthentication for the purpose of customization and authentication for \nthe purpose of access control.  Customization determines whether I show \nthe &quot;edit&quot; button.  Access control determines whether I I accept a POST \nto a particular resource.  Are you suggesting that I should have the \nuser sign in twice?\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
