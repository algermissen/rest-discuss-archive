I got the message earlier that there was something amiss with \nmy Yahoo groups profile, and tried to fix it, and the next reply was \npublished quickly.  Don&#39;t know what happened to the last one.  If \nthis one disappears, I&#39;ll try deleting and re-adding my membership \nwith a new user id.  The problems started to appear after the recent \nYahoo groups outage, although that may have been coincidental.\n\nMark Baker asked [about offer-ack]:\n&gt; Just to clarify, is &quot;ack&quot; a business level ack (&quot;got your offer,\n&gt; I&#39;ll check it out and get back to you&quot;), or a transfer level ack\n&gt; (&quot;received your message&quot;)?\n\nThe acks are business-level, but simple.  In RosettaNet and ebXML, \nit&#39;s called a &quot;receipt acknowledgment&quot; and means &quot;received&quot; \nand &quot;schema validated&quot;.  Non-repudiation of receipt may be required. \nThe receipts would go into a transaction log, which I think should be \npart of the resource model.\n\nThere could be other status messages and complications depending on \nthe business process model, but those will do for starters and \neverything else would be a variation.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
