Specifically:\n\n1. What form would the representation of service composition take?\n2. How to handle dynamic binding of multiple services within a \nsession, given that REST is a stateless and asynchronous model?\n3. How to automate service discovery, invocation (possibly using \nontology-aware agents?), and execution completion notification, with \nprovision for graceful recovery from a failed composite service \nexecution?\n\nIn a simple composition model, a client (or possibly a coordinator \nservice) would be responsible for obtaining URLs of the service \nproviders, invoking them in some order, and converting responses from \none provider into a parameter that would go into the request message \nto the other providers.  Some way of specifiying  how to tranform \nbetween representations would be necessary.  Also, this means that \nthe client (or coordinator) would be responsible for monitoring the \nstate of the service composition process.   \n\nWhat are the kinds of compositions that would work best under REST? \n\n\n\n"}}
