It&#39;s really hard to follow you. Could you please be a bit more\n&gt; verbose about why you consider that wrong? It doesn&#39;t need to be a\n&gt; physical file, ok, but besides that?\n\nI am debugging a problem with PUT.  PUT data on this server never gets to\nthe handler script.  There are many places in the server configuration\nwhere the PUT data could be getting blocked, because all the server tools\n(Apache, PHP, Plesk) treat PUT as an opt-in, because they think it&#39;s about\nuploading files.  There are plenty of potential sources of the problem.\n\nCompare that to GET, which just works.\n\nThis is not a request for help and it&#39;s not a complaint about Apache, PHP\nor Plesk.  It&#39;s an example to explain my comment that PUT does not work by\ndefault and so has to be considered fancy.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
