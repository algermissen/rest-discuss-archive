Some of us have made the claim --- admittedly rather\npoorly substantiated --- that HTTP forms a kind of &quot;coordination language&quot;\nsimilar to Linda in its potential application.  We haven&#39;t done a\nparticularly good job of explaining what that means and, indeed, the very\nnotion of a &quot;coordination language&quot; is rather underdefined.\n\n&gt; How is a &quot;resource&quot; isomporphic to a &quot;tuple space&quot;?\n\nWrong abstractions.  If the analogy holds, the resource space is analogous to\na tuple space, and a single resource is analogous to a tuple.  This is an\ninexact analogy;  most Linda implementations allow associative matching via\nany permutation of tuple fields;  if you imagine resources to be tuples of\nthe form (URI, ...) then the Web only allows matching of tuples via the URI\nfield.\n\n&gt; How are the HTTP methods isomorphic to Linda out(), in(), rd(), eval()?\n\nNB:  the eval() construct appeared in lots of early papers but its semantics\nproved fairly fuzzy and its implementation difficult.  It&#39;s usually been\ndropped or ignored by almost all later Linda and Linda-like systems.\n\nFor the others, the mapping is pretty straightforward if a bit inexact.\nout() is like PUT, rd() is like GET, and in() is like an atomic GET+DELETE.\nIt&#39;s important to understand that most distributed algorithms using Linda as\na coordination paradigm strongly require the latter in() semantics, which are\nobviously missing in HTTP.\n\n&gt; Historically speaking, was HTTP designed to be &quot;like&quot; Linda?\n\nAFAIK, it wasn&#39;t.\n\n&gt;  * Communication is asynchronous. The sender and receiver don&#39;t have to\n&gt; rendezvous to communicate; the producer produces when it&#39;s ready, and\n&gt; the consumer consumes when it&#39;s ready.\n\nThis is true.  Linda proceeds from a fundamentally asynchronous bias, and\nbuilds synchronous protocols atop as-needed.  A generative HTTP system would\ntake the reverse approach.\n\n&gt; None of these seem to apply to HTTP to me.\n\nData decoupled from process:  data artifacts can easily be generated and\nplaced at URI where the persist after the producer is finished.\n\nCommunication is anonymous, in the sense of producer and consumer don&#39;t have\nto &quot;know&quot; each other, and communication is mediated by the TS:  same thing\nfor the Web, all producer and consumer have to &quot;know&quot; about each other is how\nto address the resource artifacts each produce in the URI space, and HTTP&#39;s\ngeneric methods and architecture mediates the connection.  (Consider that a\nconsumer is actually connecting to a generic server and communicating via a\ngeneric protocol with the information space the server maintains ---\nanalogous to most implementations of TS.)  The big difference is the\nasymmetry:  producer and consumer use the same interface in Linda systems,\nwhile primarily the consumer case is standardized in HTTP.  The Web is\n&quot;read-mostly.&quot;\n\n&gt; I have no doubt that you\n&gt; could build a Linda layer on top of HTTP but I have trouble seeing how\n&gt; it is &quot;already there.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s not.  The claim isn&#39;t that the Web *is* Linda, it&#39;s that the GET, PUT,\nPOST, etc. methods on URI space form a coordination language in the same\nsense Linda does --- but with different coordination primitives.\n\nI like the idea, but it&#39;s not clear that the claim is useful.  ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
