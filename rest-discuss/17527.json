I \nhave confusion about two use cases as described below:\n\n\n          1. GET or POST\n\nUser searches for vendors (plumbers) in a given area & sees list of \nvendors on page. As a requirement, vendors get notified that a user has \nfound him for the search term, so that he can contact the customer.\n\nThe intention of the API user will be to get vendors, so it seems to be \na pure GET contender; but the unintended side effect is creation of \nthese notifications. As per the specification, HTTP verb should indicate \nthe intent of the user, but in this case there is a pure object \ncreation. What should we use, POST or GET?\n\n\n          2. GET or PUT\n\nVendor requests for notifications on which he wants to act. I don&#39;t want \nto show him notifications which he has already seen, so while delivering \nnotifications I mark them as delivered. Though the intention is pure \nretrieval the side effect if object update. Also an aspect of request is \nto get only unseen notifications, which guarantees that consecutive \nsimilar request won&#39;t be idempotent. What should I use, GET or PUT?\n\n  Thanks for reading a really long post, I would really appreciate any \nguidance I can get on it.\n\n-- \n\nRegards,\nAakash Dharmadhikari\nC42 Engineering, http://c42.in/\n\n\r\n--------------020406030908050809050103\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body text=&quot;#000000&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;\n    Hello all,&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    I am developing an API &amp; a consumer for a Yellow Pages like\n    system.
