The thing is, if you start to \nthink about what &#39;conversational state&#39; actually is, it starts to seem \nlike it doesn&#39;t really exist. I can&#39;t think of an example of what \n&#39;conversational state&#39; would be.\n\nCertainly the purpose of the URI is to stand for state (with the \nexception that the &#39;subject&#39; of the request might bear on &#39;what the \nrequest means&#39;). Can you show an example of where the URL is useful for \ncreating &#39;transient&#39; session state, as distinct from &#39;persistent&#39; state.\n\nIn all cases you are creating state on the server. You literally persist \nstate on the server, and then modify the URI to point at this new state. \nYou still need to dereference the &#39;state key&#39; which you add to the URI \nin order to get at the state being maintained on the server, whether \nthat state is called &#39;transient&#39;, &#39;conversational&#39;, or &#39;persisted&#39; it \nstill gets stored on the server and referenced by a request. All we&#39;re \nreally arguing about is whether the &#39;key&#39; to this state should be in the \nURI, in the Auth header, or in a cookie. You want to drop out one layer \nof indirection (namely the &#39;session&#39;), and I don&#39;t. It seems to me like \nwhen you pull it there&#39;s nothing there.\n\n&gt; But I stand corrected about the shopping carts. I looked around,  \n&gt; including at Amazon, and every one I tried was essentially giving me  \n&gt; the user, or my browser, one and only one shopping cart.\n\nHere&#39;s the thing about &#39;sessions&#39;. Although a session can only be \ncorrelated with a single user, the user that the session correlates with \ncan vary over time. I highlighted this in an earlier post on this subject.\n\nA visual agent sends a HTTP request to my server for the &#39;product \ncatalogue&#39;. I see that they don&#39;t have a &#39;session token&#39;. I give them a \nsession token and a representation of the catalogue. The user chooses to \nadd something from the catalogue to their basket. The user navigates to \nthe checkout. I tell them they need to login or create a new account. \nThe user logs in. At this point the &#39;session&#39; has changed from belonging \nto &#39;anonymous&#39; to &#39;Joe&#39;. This is one of the main reasons that I need \nsessions. Though it&#39;s not the sole reason, it could stand as \njustification for &#39;session token&#39; requirement by itself.\n\n&gt; When I use the back button, is that a way to view history, or is that  \n&gt; just a way to go back to a URI I previously visited?\n\nI think this issue is contentious. Regardless of what happens \nspecifically when you click back, I think that if you click &#39;Refresh&#39; \nthen you should definitely see the latest state (not some &#39;snapshot&#39; of \nhistorical state).\n\n&gt; I agree with you now (and especially, with Amazon) on that point.  \n&gt; Shopping carts are persistent state, not conversational state, so  \n&gt; they are inappropriate to use as example of using snapshots rather  \n&gt; than user sessions for maintaining conversational state.\n\nCan you give us an example of &#39;conversational state&#39; as distinct from \n&#39;persistent state&#39; then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
