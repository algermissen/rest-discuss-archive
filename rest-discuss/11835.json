The \nproblem is that the color attributes a=\r\nre user generated. So sometimes \nwe get arguments like: &quot;blue/light blue&quot; &quot;=\r\nred/pink&quot;.\n\nWhen we build the URI based on that, we get stuff like:\n\n/searc=\r\nh/shoes/colors/blue;red/pink;silver/\n\nWe tried URL encoding, converting the=\r\n URL to:\n\n/search/shoes/colors/blue;red%2Fpink;silver/\n\nBut it looks like J=\r\nBoss automatically decode the %2F back to /, \nbefore it calls our java laye=\r\nr (we are using JBoss and java in the \nbackend to parse the url). So we get=\r\n a 404 not found error message. \nWe noticed something simmilar with apache.=\r\n\n\nA workaround was to double-encode the slash string, so the first \nautomat=\r\nic, unwanted dencoding of JBoss wouldn&#39;t convert it back to / \nbefore passi=\r\nng it to the Java application. \n\nThat seems to work, but I was wondering if=\r\n anybody else runs in the \nsame problem before, and if there is a better wa=\r\ny to fix it without \nhaving to double url encode slashes.\n\n\n"}}
