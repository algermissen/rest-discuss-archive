Both, client and=\r\n server couple to these central contracts but not to *each other*.\n\n&gt; And s=\r\npecifically: to what extent could =93self-describing=94 formats such as RDF=\r\n help out here?\n\nRDF-aware clients are just that - RDF aware. There is no m=\r\nagic in REST that suddenly allows clients to come up with implementation lo=\r\ngic that has not been baked into them when they where coded. REST doesn&#39;t m=\r\nake the problems of decentralized systems (where communication between clie=\r\nnt owner and server owner is impossible or too costly) go away.\n\nQuite the =\r\nopposite: REST makes them explicit (e.g. SOA(P) hides them while implying t=\r\no solve them), forces you to deal with them but also provides you with a &#39;c=\r\nonceptual framework&#39; to deal with them in a controlled way. (Well, actually=\r\n REST allows you to design an architecture that allows you to deal with the=\r\nm in a controlled way. HTTP is such an architecture).\n\nHTML and AtomPub are=\r\n good example of such centrally owned contracts. While they seem rather gen=\r\neric, there is actually a lot of stuff that is highly specific (take client=\r\n side image maps in HTML for example). Clients that implement support for t=\r\nhem couple themselves to the contratc the specs describe.\n\nNow, HTML and At=\r\nomPub are designed to realize use cases that turn to a human user often for=\r\n making descisions in what action step to take next.\n\nIf you want to realiz=\r\ne use cases where the human actor is much less involved (and the user agent=\r\n does a lot more on its own) you need to come up with media types (and/or l=\r\nink relations) that provide the necessary hypermedia semantics to write suc=\r\nh user agents.\n\nIf you do not do that (write specific media types) but inst=\r\nead use generic ones (application/xml, application/json) you absolutely, 10=\r\n0%, need some out of band coupling somewhere if you want your client to do =\r\nmore than &#39;parse as xml&#39; or &#39;parse as json&#39;. And you will, immediately, end=\r\n up with a non RESTful architecture where out of band contract is owned and=\r\n changed by the server.\n\nThis need not be bad, but it is likely to produce =\r\nthe same probles in the long run that to avoid made you look at REST in the=\r\n first place.\n\nEither way, understand the tradeoffs of what you are designi=\r\nng - this is probably the most valuable lesson that Roy has tought us (me a=\r\nnyway) with his work.\n\nAs for some discussion of the tradeoffs you might fi=\r\nnd[1] interesting.\n\nHTH\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://www.nordsc.com/ext/classification_=\r\nof_http_based_apis.html\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me borrow the Maze+XML example used in=\r\n a previous discussion [1].\n&gt; So the problem is: a server exposes a maze, a=\r\n client needs to be able to navigate through it.\n&gt; Basically, there are two=\r\n options:\n&gt; 1) Use a generic format (such as JSON) and explain separately w=\r\nhat the different fields mean.\n&gt; 2) Use a specific format (such as Maze+XML=\r\n); no need to explain, everything is in the media type.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first, it s=\r\neems like the second solution minimizes the amount of out-of-band informati=\r\non, as solution 1 involves a separate explanation document (which might or =\r\nmight not be expressed in a machine-processable way). But if you think abou=\r\nt it, solution 2 has the exact same amount of out-of-band information, only=\r\n this time it has moved to the interpretation of the media type=92s specifi=\r\ncation. In both cases, the client needs to be adapted specifically to inter=\r\nact with the media type. And how decoupled is it when client and server are=\r\n constrained to a specific message format?\n&gt; \n&gt; Things _could_ be different=\r\n with a self-describing format, as this might overcome the need for specifi=\r\nc media types. So here=92s another situation:\n&gt; 3) Use a self-describing fo=\r\nrmat (such as RDF); no need to explain, and the client can work this out by=\r\n itself.\n&gt; (Although I=92m being slightly overoptimistic about RDF now.) Th=\r\ne idea would be that the client can interpret the representation as being a=\r\n maze, and continue to use it that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; My basic question is thus: do =\r\nspecific media types really reduce coupling, and if not, what does?\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ruben\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] https://groups.google.com/d/topic/hypermedia-web/Ld=\r\nKfi47QCxw/discussion\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Yahoo!
