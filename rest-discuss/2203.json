So you could imagine a hierarchy such as;\n\nContainer\n  StatePreservingContainer\n    Archiver\n      EternityArchiver\n\nand if you expose that type, and I give you my data (with POST), I\nexpect that you will keep it for eternity ... as described by the RDF\nyou get when you GET the type URI (plus info that relates it to its\nparent, so that if you&#39;re only looking for an Archiver and don&#39;t care\nwhat kind, you can use EternityArchivers.\n\n&gt; * I guess you could negotiate a contract like this, but what I meant is that it&#39;s not REST\n&gt; or HTTP baseline stuff.\n\nSure, it&#39;s not baseline.  But it seems like the only way forward for\nlaying out a coherrent framework for fitting RDF into REST.
