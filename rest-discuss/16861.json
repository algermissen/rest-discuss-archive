Not my level of detail.\n\nStill, this is interesting.\nI di=\r\nslike a little bit PATCH. There are several reasons, these are just a coupl=\r\ne:\n\n1. One of important part of PATCH is the payload, as it defines the cha=\r\nnges. And that payload is not standardized.\n\n2. As Payload is important, it=\r\n makes the resource update much more representational oriented. That is, li=\r\nke patching a source code file. Also, it makes the resource expose its attr=\r\nibutes, avoiding data hiding \n\n3. Although it may be generic, adjusting the=\r\n alpha channel of an image may not be as intuitive. In this case, the PATCH=\r\n Payload should request the change of the alpha channel. Metadata?\n\n4. Not =\r\nall resources are just a bunch of fields, some can be more complex and the =\r\nupdate should be done by the server based on certain conditions or requests=\r\n.\n\nSo, PATCH may work, but I feel still it is not the full solution. At the=\r\n end, as you say, we may need to go back and use POST.    \nWhat do you thin=\r\nk?\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amu=\r\nndsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Partial updates should be done using PATCH [1=\r\n]\n&gt; Complete updates should be done using PUT.\n&gt; When those methods are not=\r\n practical, POST can be used instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Subbu&#39;s &quot;RESTful Web Services Co=\r\nokbook&quot; has a very good chapter (&quot;11.\n&gt; Miscellaneous Writes&quot;) [2] that inc=\r\nludes more than one section\n&gt; covering strategies for partial updates, too.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789\n&gt; [2] http://bit.ly/bRCwGj\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://twitter.com@mamund\n&gt; http://mamu=\r\nnd.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #RESTFest 2010\n&gt; http://rest-fest.googlecode.com=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
