We\nstill can talk about the architectural principles that the web embodies, as\ndescribed by REST.  Mark is proposing that the w3c web services group should\nonly document those architectures that have running code, and it should\ndocument all the usages.  And he&#39;s specifically pointing out areas where\nSOAP is used in different ways that he finds &quot;sucky&quot;.  If the criteria is\nrunning code, I would argue that a web architecture (aka REST) description\nwould include all the inappropriate uses.  And the &quot;running code criteria&quot;\nprecludes things like SOAP 1.2 which don&#39;t have much running code yet.  So\nthe running code criteria doesn&#39;t seem useful to specify architectures to\nhelp people build better web/web services systems and standards.\n\nSo it&#39;s my opinion that the w3c web services architecture group should spend\nsome of it&#39;s time working on web services architectural principles, not\nsimply documenting what current systems do.  And the same goes for the TAG\nwrt web principles.\n\nJust because I mention REST usage (the generic method usage) and CGI usage\ndoes not mean I want a REST vs whatever discussion.  In fact, I&#39;m utterly\nand completely exhausted by that particular topic area.  Roy&#39;s quote is the\nreason why I mentioned CGI and I think his quote supports the notion that\nsome running code &quot;sucks&quot;.  And I again assert that w3c groups shouldn&#39;t\ndocument the sucky usages in our architecture documents, except perhaps as\nbeing sucky.  But again again again, this is not a REST discussion per se.\n\nI don&#39;t intend to follow through much more with this discussion about what\nthe group is going to do.  I&#39;m more interested in writing up text to\ndescribe the architecture and discussing the text of such.  &quot;Do stuff rather\nthan talk about doing stuff&quot;.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: www-ws-arch-request@...

To compare, if I were to document REST as it is\n&gt; &gt; done today, I&#39;d probably ignore HTTP PUT/DELETE and I&#39;d say\n&gt; that GET/POST\n&gt; &gt; can be used interchangeably except for some bookmarking\n&gt; applications where\n&gt; &gt; GET is a little better.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a severe misrepresentation of the way the Web is used\n&gt; today. GET\n&gt; is used whenever safe references are important. Bookmarking is a tiny\n&gt; example. I can send you this link because of GET:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://search.bea.com/query.html?qt=REST\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t bookmark it and probably you won&#39;t either. That fact\n&gt; that I can\n&gt; email it to you -- communicate it to you -- is what is important. You\n&gt; can interoperably, using any Web client, anywhere in the world,\n&gt; dereference that link. Bookmarking is a side effect of that general\n&gt; improvement in interoperability. I am confident that BEA&#39;s\n&gt; web designers\n&gt; understand this issue because they work with these safe information\n&gt; references (&quot;hyperlinks&quot;) all day.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ... And I&#39;d say that CGIs are great.\n&gt;\n&gt; CGIs *can be* great. I may be wrong, but I think that you&#39;re\n&gt; interpreting something from this mail by Roy Fielding. I&#39;ve seen this\n&gt; post misinterpreted (IMO) in other places so I&#39;m going to address it\n&gt; once and for all.\n&gt;\n&gt;  * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Note the last sentence: &#39;The fact of the matter is that\n&gt; most CGI scripts are not HTTP compliant.  Most CGI scripts, in fact,\n&gt; provide interfaces to applications that suck. The &quot;G&quot; stands for\n&gt; Gateway.\n&gt; What people should realize is not that &quot;CGI scripts should be banned&quot;,\n&gt; but rather that if the CGI script is written such that it behaves\n&gt; like a proper Web interface, then it won&#39;t suck.&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; CGI is a *gateway* interface. You can either use it to just\n&gt; publish some\n&gt; functionality through a URL (tunnelling) or you can use it to build a\n&gt; proper gateway between your software and the Web: URIs for all\n&gt; resources, hyperlinks as the engine of application state, etc. Some of\n&gt; the most REST-ful applications in the world are CGI and many of the\n&gt; least are not.\n&gt; --\n&gt; Come discuss XML and REST web services at:\n&gt;   Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n&gt;   Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
