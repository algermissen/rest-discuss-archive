My two bobs worth, and I&#39;ll just start with this\n&gt; one (although my reply is not directed at Nick throughout) ;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Sep 18, 2009 at 06:35, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; For the umpteenth time, HTTP is a application protocol NOT a  \n&gt; middleware protocol\n&gt;\n&gt; We all have our definitions (in our heads, at best) of what thing is\n&gt; called what and what that part of technology is categorised under. The\n&gt; thing is, it&#39;s all really philosophically interchangeable in the end\n&gt; (for a good example of what I&#39;m talking about, see &quot;Everything is\n&gt; miscellaneous&quot;; google it). I know we&#39;re all hardcore engineers here\n&gt; and all, but if we take a step back and examine what we&#39;re doing here\n&gt; in human terms, what the heck is all this bickering about?\n&gt;\n\nYes, we are all a cloud of atoms -- what&#39;s the point of distinguishing\nus into types, shapes, or names?\n\n&gt; I find this (&quot;HTTP is a application protocol NOT a middleware\n&gt; protocol&quot;) a bit of a strange assertion. First of all, the notion of\n&gt; middleware is to glue software components and / or systems together,\n&gt; and as such an application protocol *is* a middleware protocol. Are we\n&gt; here just battling over semantics that actually are superfluous in\n&gt; nature? Aren&#39;t we trying to say that RESTful design removes much of\n&gt; the need for *traditional* middleware whos sole purpose is to glue\n&gt; applications together through structures simulating OO (which REST\n&gt; does for you in better ways through resources [mining from\n&gt; identification management]), so why are you recreating the middleware\n&gt; problem through something that already solves much of it? This\n&gt; misguidance will of course be misinterpreted as commercial bias.\n&gt;\n\nNo, that&#39;s not what middleware means (it certainly isn&#39;t tied to OO).\nThere is a lot of good middleware and a lot of good distributed\narchitectures that use various types of middleware for communication\naccording to various good architectural styles.  There is plenty of\nmiddleware active in the Web as well, like content distribution  \nnetworks,\nname resolvers, load balancers, etc.  Middleware are implementation\npackages that may or may not fit a given architecture, and should be\nused only when and where the fit is right.  Likewise, there are\nplenty of good RESTful architectures that end at the resource\ninterface, behind which is another architecture composed of\nmiddleware services that are not (and should not be) RESTful.\n\n&gt; People whinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias. Um, computer\n&gt; scientists have a bias too, even people who have no bias have a basic\n&gt; philosophical bias, and these semantics *will* affect (as oppose to\n&gt; mere observatory notions) the work that is done. The argument of bias\n&gt; is mostly moot (but not completely, of course). I personally get the\n&gt; feeling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only\n&gt; business bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went\n&gt; with it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and\n&gt; as such I *really* welcome it.\n&gt;\n\nWould you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked to see a\nnew Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?\n\nWould you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a\nfilet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?\n\nWTF is wrong with you people?\n\nRed Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set\nthemselves up as the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards\norganization on a topic for which they not only had NOTHING to\ndo with creating and know NOTHING about, but for which they\nactually sell products that are the exact opposite of RESTful\narchitecture.  The organization claims that it will specify REST\nstandards, that such standards will be led by benevolent dictators\nin the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals would be\nallowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL),\nand that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the board\nto ensure that never changed.\n\nAnd, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Leads\nowning the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because\nthey know damn well that their current market is shrinking: their\nentire product architecture is based on J2EE, the giant black\nhole of Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.\n\nBut, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that\nis found in my dissertation.  This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,\nAssHat version of REST, so that JBoss can tell their customers\nthat they are the new leaders in &quot;REST&quot; architecture and all\nthey need to do get their systems to be RESTful 2.0-compliant\nis to buy their J2EE application server, now with REST-beans.\n\nBill Burke is not evangelizing REST throughout the Java world.\nWhat he is evangelizing is the same old architectures that he\nevangelized as J2EE and WS-* -- the only difference is that now\nhe starts off calling them REST.  All he is doing is making\npeople like you confused over what is REST and what is not, in\nthe hope of making a business out of clambering onto yet\nanother buzzword.\n\nNo, I see no reason to appreciate that nonsense.  Not in the least.\nI don&#39;t care if it was an &quot;honest mistake&quot; or a deliberate attempt\nat fraud -- the result is the same.  Only a complete idiot would\nparticipate in such a forum.\n\nIf you want a place to collect REST ideas and patterns, then\nuse the wiki that Mark Baker established.  He actually knows\nwhat he is talking about, doesn&#39;t pretend to be a dictator, and\nactually earned the role of editor long before most of you had\neven heard of the term.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
