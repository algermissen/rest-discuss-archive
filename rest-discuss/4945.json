Now that I see it, I will try to send to the group in the\nfuture. &lt;/apology&gt;\n\nI guess any return from our http that reflects the state of the\nresource is a Representation, so that makes it equivalent to a &#39;View&#39;,\nkinda. I guess I was thinking of a plain-jane xml representing, say, a\nrow in a data table, as a &#39;Model&#39;, but of course it&#39;s not. Still, I\nlike the idea of http verbs as methods of the model -- it&#39;s neat that\nthere&#39;s only 4 of them.\n\nOf the two URI&#39;s, I prefer\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/10/1/?sort-column=\n1&sort-order=desc&format=html-4.01&style=green\nbecause the sort-column and sort-order are &#39;colorings&#39; or &#39;flavorings&#39;\nthat can apply no matter which &#39;geometry&#39; of the page is specified. \n\nIn fact, I might go even further: consider the &#39;geometry&#39; of the page\nas a decoration of the data at http://localhost/my-app/my-things/ and\nmake it look like:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-things/?pagethings=10&p\nageno=1&sort-column=1\n&sort-order=desc&format=html-4.01&style=green\n\nbecause it makes everything just a Representation of my-things, which\nare &quot;real&quot; (in my mind.) The first constraint in Fieldings paper is\nthat of &quot;client-server&quot; architecture, where client is concerned solely\nwith user interface, and server with data storage. What page a given\nchunk of data shows up on seems like a UI issue.\n\nIf I failed to specify the geometry orflavorings that I want, I might\njust get a &quot;bare-bones dump&quot; Representation of the resource at\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-things/ and serve me right, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
