One of the questions I am grappling with is:\n\n    At what point does mere data become an actual resource?\n\n\nFor instance, I gave a model in which only URIs were posted and all\nresources were acquired through GETs.  In this model, there is no such thing\nas &quot;sending data&quot; via POST.  In terms of the PO example, only the URI to a\nPO resource was sent to the vendor.\n\nHowever, Roger Costello was working on a tutorial where he wanted to have a\nvendor present an HTML form that a user would fill in.  This form would POST\nthe PO to the server.  In this case, that same PO is considered to be\nnothing more than &quot;data&quot;.\n\nSo, here we have potentially two identical blocks of data.  In the first\ninstance, it is a resource (really, representation of a resource)\nidentifiable by a URI and in the second instance, it is merely data.  Why is\nit that the second instance is not considered a resource, or even a\nrepresentation of a resource?  Must a resource have an associated URI?  Is\nit okay to push a representation of a resource (POST) instead of pull a\nrepresentation of a resource (GET)?  And if so, then what does it mean to\nsend a representation of a resource to another resource?\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
