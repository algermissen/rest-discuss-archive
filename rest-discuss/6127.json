Does REST  \n&gt; suggest a way to think about the responses of POST? The response of a  \n&gt; GET is a representation of the resource at that URI. What is the  \n&gt; response of a POST?\n&gt; \n&gt; Claude, for example, may be returning a request ID in the post  \n&gt; response, or maybe the URI of the request resource he created, after  \n&gt; someone posted a request to the sensor. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if a  \n&gt; POST response should be thought of as a kind of method return value.\n\nWhy do you consider this different from typical POSTs? A redirect to the \nnewly created resource, and/or the URI seems jut fine to me.\n\n--\nClaude\n\n"}}
