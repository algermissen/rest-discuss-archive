What if an entity I invoke, invokes other entities, and what if\n&gt;    they have transactions of their own? Are they in the same\n&gt;    transaction? A new transaction? Do they nest?\n\nPresumably, when an entity receives a PREPARE request, it attempts to \nPREPARE any sub-transactions for which it is responsible.  If all those \nPREPAREs are successful, it returns 200 in response to  PREPARE, otherwise \nit returns an error.  If it does anything else, it violates the semantics \nof PREPARE.\n\n&gt; 2. What if an entity I invoke also sends messages? Are they in the\n&gt;    transaction as well? In what order?\n\nPresumably in the order of the entities that send them.  How does SOAP \nhandle this issue?\n\n&gt; 3. If the client goes down, is the transaction committed? Rolled back?\n&gt; 4. Doing two or three phase commit at the client is really innovative\n&gt;    I assume... What do we need transaction managers for??\n\nIn either protocol, there is no commit until COMMIT.\nIf you are concerned about client reliability in then set up a durable \nserver\nto handle the commits.  In the HTTP context, you have a reliable HTTP \nserver that posts PREPARE and perhaps COMMIT to a list of URLs supplied in \na single HTTP request.  In the SMTP context, this is what SMTP servers \nalready do for desktop mail clients.  The &quot;unreliable&quot; client sends \nmessages to the server and the server is responsible for guaranteeing \ndelivery.\n\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; 5. Priorization.\n&gt;\n&gt;     S&gt; I am not sure what this means, but I suspect you don&#39;t want it\n&gt;     S&gt; because it violates the End-To-End principle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Absolutely not! If I want to have certain orders served at higher\n&gt; priority, why should software prevent me? If I want paying customers\n&gt; to serve at a higher priority at some site, why not?\n\nI assume you are not familiar with the End-To-End (Dumb Network) principle.\nDiscussion on the internet is quite extensive.  I&#39;d point you to a URL, but \nI&#39;m offline now (try http://isen.com).  The short answer is that \nprioritization is an application layer issue and not a protocol issue.  The \nInternet and even IP-telephony have been quite successful without QoS IP \nrouting (some IP packets are more important than others).  Southwest \nAirlines chooses not to prioritize and is doing better than most airlines \nthat do (yield-management).\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n"}}
