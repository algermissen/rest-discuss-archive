On whom does the responsibility for avoiding that\n&gt;&gt; lie?\n\n&gt;That&#39;s protecting the client. I&#39;m talking about protecting the\n&gt;server.\n\nI was too.  So how do you distinguish?\n\n&gt;&gt; The second problem is distinguishing this breakdown in &quot;safety&quot; from\n&gt;&gt; the case in which you use HTTP POST to send an arbitrary &quot;block of data\n...\n&gt;&gt; to a handling process&quot;. Or should we say a &quot;block of arguments to a\n&gt;&gt; remote handling procedure&quot;?\n\n&gt;Hmm. I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s any distinguishing to be done in that\n&gt;case.\n\nWell, I guess I&#39;m arguing that POST is a contract that will have to be\nextended in a lot of cases in order to get the job done, and that if\ncontract\nextension is regarded as risky, well then the camel&#39;s nose is under the\ntent.  I noticed in a previous mail you asserted that POST cannot be\nextended in a way that compromises intermediary security policy.  I don&#39;t\nknow much about that, and an example of a contract extension would\nbe great.  For that matter, any example of compromised security due\nto tunneling would be great, but I notice my invitations for stories\ngoing unanswered.  Probably too much effort...\n\nAnyway, one thing I think I&#39;ve figured out is that while I&#39;m visualizing\na security setup in which the server has a lot of control (arguably enough,\nif it chooses to exploit it), you are probably looking at security\nas a (textbook) layered concept, and your concern is that an outer layer not\nbe\ndismantled.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that.\n\n\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re going with it, sorry.\n\nNo doubt my fault.  [We were talking about my &#39;square&#39; example,\nin which I send &#39;square&#39; as a command in a POST body, and you find\nto be UnRestful. I was then proposing a number of different strategies\nfor &#39;nounifying&#39; the command, in order to try to discover a boundary,\nif there exists one, between commands and command surrogates\nin the body, such that a Restless example becomes a Restful one.]\n\nIn a recent message, Jeff Winters gives an example in which a\n&lt;transfer .../&gt; is posted.  The transfer is a document that contains\nthe parameters for the transfer, but it&#39;s also due to become the\nrecord of the action.  How does that rate on your scale?\n\n&gt;Perhaps, but that &quot;block of data&quot; blurb is the most oft referenced\n&gt;part of the definition of POST that people use to defend tunneling,\n&gt;ala;\n\n&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-debry-http-usepost-00.txt\n\n&gt;So I think it&#39;s useful that the examples are part/assembly, even if\n&gt;the IPP guys chose to ignore them. 8-)\n\nI wonder what the harm would be from removing that bullet from 2616,\nand I&#39;ve often pondered its strange relation to the other bullets, because\nit appears to be about a half a layer away in its semantics.  You can\nachieve all the other goals by posting form data to a data-consuming\nprocess, can&#39;t you.\n\nBut as far as tunneling goes, now I&#39;m not so sure that clause is the\ntunnel I thought it was before.  As long as what&#39;s being posted is &#39;data&#39;\nto the application and not &#39;control&#39;, then visibility is left intact, isn&#39;t\nit?\n\nIf visibility of actions is important, then why is it bad to put an action\nin the body of the HTTP message but okay to hide them behind &#39;processor&#39;\nURIs?  Especially when the URIs are going to be opaque in meaning to\nall but the server (i.e., intermediaries won&#39;t know what they mean either).\nIs this okay simply because you can annotate a resource with RDF,\nand thereby make the resource&#39;s behavior open to inquiring minds?\n\n&gt;My eyes, me eyes! 8-)\n\nYes, what about URIs?
