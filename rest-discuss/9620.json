Part of that agreement can be a user-defined\nconfiguration, such as &quot;okay to use these methods to the same domain\nas their source&quot; (the applet security model), and part can be reasonable\nconfirmation dialogs &quot;are you sure you want to delete {URL}?&quot;.\n\n&gt; What do you mean? Should the browser have a popup each time Google&#39;s\n&gt; search wants to do it&#39;s assist, for instance? ...or a configurable  \n&gt; that\n&gt; has to be set, saying &quot;foo.google.com&quot; is &quot;safe&quot;?\n\nThere are many ways to do that, including reasonable defaults that\ncan be overridden for more (or less) secure environments.\n\nKeep in mind that content received via the Web cannot be trusted, ever,\nand the more software-as-a-service sites grow, the more vulnerable that\nreal people&#39;s data will become to actions hidden within scripts and\nforms and any other mechanism capable of unsafe actions.  Would you\nallow any script to delete files on your local hard drive?  What makes\nyour web-based iDisk or S3 or whatever any less important?\n\n&gt; Regardless of the need for human intervention, if the browser XHR\n&gt; doesn&#39;t support the protocol, where are we?\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me that you designed the HTTP protocol to work this way.\n&gt; It&#39;s 2007 and they still don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;. &#39;Seems ridiculous to me!\n\nI am past that.  There are browsers out there with known network\nread errors (they can&#39;t see CRLF if it occurs on 512 byte boundaries,\nfor example).  It really is astonishing how few developers care about\nthe communication layer -- all they care about is the GUI.\n\n&gt; XHR does these things behind the scenes all the time, with no explicit\n&gt; action on the part of the user. I simply want all the HTTP protocol to\n&gt; be supported this way, rather than a subset. I should have  \n&gt; clarified in\n&gt; my original post that this was only intended in an XHR context. Safari\n&gt; still doesn&#39;t do XHR PUT/DELETE as far as I know and I&#39;m interested in\n&gt; XHR workarounds that work.\n\nI want a pony too.  The point is that people complain about this all\nthe time, yet I&#39;ve never seen one person take the time to actually\nspecify what would be safe behavior for all browsers to implement as\na standard.  Mark is the only one I&#39;ve seen even bother to try to\nget the standards fixed, aside from my repeated expressions when\nI was on the TAG (that went nowhere).  Essentially, this runs core\nto the failure of the W3C to do what it was originally created to do:\nget the non-IETF parts of the Web in standard agreement.\n\nSure, that won&#39;t solve the implementation issue right away, but I can\nguarantee that those issues will not be solved until the lack of\nspecification excuse is gone.  Right now, the HTML &quot;standard&quot; claims\nthose methods don&#39;t even exist (a known bug).\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
