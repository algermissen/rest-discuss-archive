For the most part\nI ge=\r\nt the whole resources thing, but I&#39;m having trouble coming up with\na restfu=\r\nl way of solving a problem.\n\nI&#39;m making an app that allows users to make gr=\r\naphs of ecological data\nfrom different study sites. In my first case, I wan=\r\nt to allow a user\nto get a plot of change in abundance of a particular spec=\r\nies over time\nat one study site. My url looks like this:\n\nstudy_sites/:site=\r\n_id/abundances/:species_id.png\n\nI could also specify .xml and get the raw d=\r\nata. Pretty good way of\nrepresenting this.\n\nOk, now imagine that I want to =\r\nallow users to create a plot comparing\nmultiple species and multiple sites!=\r\n As an RPC call, it would look\nsomething like this:\n\n/plotAbundance?site1=\r\n=3DHAZARDS&site2=3DANACAPA&species1=3DPCLA&species2=3DCNIC\n\nBasically, its =\r\nan RPC call that accepts and arbitrary number of sites\nand species. I reall=\r\ny can&#39;t imagine a scheme for doing this with rest.\nThe only thing I could t=\r\nhink of is POST+redirect, and cache the image\nthat it is redirected to. Unf=\r\nortunately, you can&#39;t really encode a\nPOST into an img tag. I would have to=\r\n do some ajax calls and insert a\nlink to the redirect location.\n\nI was hopi=\r\nng to find a REST design patterns reference somewhere but no\nluck so far. C=\r\nould somebody take a crack at this?\n\nThanks,\nChad\n\n\n"}}
