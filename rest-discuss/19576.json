I was wondering though, are there any real-world \n(hopefully prominent?) examples of services adhering completely to the \nREST constraints that aren&#39;t based around HTML/CSS/JS (minus cookies) or \nAtom? I think it would give me a better sense of what REST looks like in \npractice to see more individual instances.\n\nThanks,\nShea Levy\n\n"}}
