REST as an \n&gt;architectural style has no concept of URI/URLs; it only talks about \n&gt;identifiers.   The &#39;fundamental idea&#39; you talk of above is related to \n&gt;the Web, not REST.  \n&gt;\n&gt;When we say that the web is an implementation of REST, dont make the \n&gt;mistake of thinking of the relationship between REST and the Web as one \n&gt;of superclass/subclass.  The Web is not a subclass of REST.  The Web can \n&gt;be classified as a RESTful (more or less) application - just like some \n&gt;other application might be classified as a client-server application.\n\nChuck, \n\nYou really cleared things up for me. I was running into this exact problem\nin my argument, assuming that REST was tied to the web environment. So it\nappears REST could be used in virtually any architecture that (a) supported\nstrong, unique names for resources, and (b) exposed a limited, common set of\nfunctions on those resources? &quot;Database&quot; immediately springs to mind, and of\ncourse that is an example I&#39;ve seen given to show how REST works in the\nabstract.\n\nAnyway, thanks for opening my eyes -- it&#39;s definitely a learning curve, but\na fun one. :)\n\nThanks,\n-dave\n\n"}}
