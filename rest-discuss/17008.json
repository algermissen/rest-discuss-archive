I am not sure what media type would fit then. I am\n&gt; trying to follow the HATEOS design, I have an entry point that\n&gt; returns some links based on credentials, from there a client would\n&gt; use those to make calls to any of my resources, and each response\n&gt; would return a relevant chunk of XML or JSON with links for each\n&gt; resource accessible at that point (for example GET /orders/id would\n&gt; return a specific order along with one or more links that can be used\n&gt; to operate on the order). \n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve never seen an order-processing system that couldn&#39;t be modeled as\nHTML.  In fact, I&#39;ve rarely seen an order-processing system that wasn&#39;t\nHTML.  In OOP terminology, the goal is to distribute not your objects,\nbut your object interfaces.  REST says, make those object interfaces\nuniform.  Which means participants have a network-based shared\nunderstanding of your state transitions (links, forms), IOW, a self-\ndocumenting API.\n\nIt&#39;s perfectly acceptable to model your data as JSON or as XML (bearing\nin mind that schemas are an orthogonal concern).  The trick is to\ncreate an HTML interface for either JSON or XML data, which instructs\nuser-agents how to interact with that data.  I&#39;d choose either JSON or\nXML, instead of trying to do both, depending on whether you&#39;re more\ncomfortable transforming that data into HTML using Javascript or XSLT.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So if I use application/xml, my API would not be considered truly\n&gt; RESTful? \n&gt; \n\nNo, not if you&#39;re using application/xml as the hypertext engine driving\napplication state.  If it&#39;s just a snippet of XML which gets read by,\nsay, an HTML front-end driving application state, then it&#39;s OK because\nthe processing model (parse as XML, handling XInclude/XLink/rdf:about)\nis adequate to the task.  If that XML snippet contains URIs the user is\nsupposed to click on to transition the application to the next steady-\nstate (which aren&#39;t XLinks), well, that&#39;s what &lt;a&gt; and atom:link are\nfor, there&#39;s no corollary in application/xml (besides XLink).\n\nAlso, most order forms are simply tabular data, the semantics of which\ndon&#39;t exist in application/xml like they do in application/xhtml+xml or\ntext/html with &lt;table&gt;.  Same with lists, same with forms.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So now I&#39;ll ask, what media type I could possibly use with my own\n&gt; xml/json structure? It almost sounds like you&#39;re saying I shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be returning my own made up structure, that I should instead use an\n&gt; existing media type, like one with xhtml or something. Is there a\n&gt; media type that allows for any sort of specific format to a domain to\n&gt; be returned? Or does that now fall into a case where I should create\n&gt; my own media type and register it with IANA?\n&gt; \n\nIt falls into a case where you should refactor.  You have tabular data,\nso you need to choose a data type which expresses such semantics (i.e.\nHTML, or DocBook).  The whole point of media types is that they are\n_not_ domain-specific, but rather, represent a shared understanding of\na processing model at the network (IP) layer.  This is the fundamental\ntradeoff of the style:\n\n&quot;[A] uniform interface degrades efficiency, since information is\ntransferred in a standardized form rather than one which is specific to\nan application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n\nAn order consists of item numbers, descriptions, quantity, unit price\nand total price.  You *could* re-invent the &lt;table&gt; wheel and register\nit as a new media type, but it&#39;s more scalable (maintainable, portable)\nto re-use HTML even if it isn&#39;t a precise fit.  If you create a new\nmedia type, then you need to distribute a custom user-agent.  When you\nupgrade your API, you must simultaneously update that user-agent.\n\nThe success of the Web is due to the common user-agent.  What I really\ndon&#39;t want, is for any system I interact with to require me to install\nyet another piece of software, and keep it up-to-date.  That&#39;s coupling.\nSo much easier for everyone concerned, to target the browser.  That way,\nI only need to install and maintain one user-agent regardless of how\nmany different systems I interact with.  Such decoupling allows clients\nand servers to evolve independently.  So there is a cost associated\nwith the minting of new media types -- coupling -- unless and until the\nnew media type achieves significant uptake.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
