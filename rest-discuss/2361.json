I could query for &#39;apple&#39;\nthen &#39;banana&#39; and the same counter is incremented.\n\n&gt; authorization was given under the explicit terms that that specific resources\n&gt; will only be accessed a limited number of times.  Given those terms, I no\n&gt; longer\n&gt; see the change as being of &quot;unexpected significance&quot;; in fact it has precisely\n&gt; the\n&gt; significance that the user expected it to have, which would make it safe.\n\nIndeed, one could (perversely) argue that not to give a 403 (or whatever)\nin the context of Google&#39;s current T&Cs would be of unexpected significance.\n\nI agree with (most people, I suppose) in that the key thing here is that\nthere&#39;s no black and white. \n\ndj\n\n"}}
