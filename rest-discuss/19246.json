NOT from knowledge of resource type coupled via custom\nmedia ty=\r\npe (vnd.order*).  It seems like you&#39;re asking how to inform the\nclient that=\r\n this resource type is &quot;order&quot; -- which is simply not\nrelevant to REST, whe=\r\nre the only client knowledge required is of the\n*interface* to the resource=\r\n, not the *meaning* of the resource.\n\nIf my order-form &lt;table&gt; has a &lt;th&gt;qu=\r\nantity&lt;/th&gt; column, then the\nquantity of any item ID is the corresponding &lt;=\r\ntd&gt;, i.e. you code the\nclient with the XPATH expression which yields the an=\r\nswer you&#39;re looking\nfor, assuming XHTML.  If Xforms is used, this XPATH exp=\r\nression is right\nthere in the form control binding, i.e. a self-documenting=\r\n API.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, I would argue that a generic media type is more &quot;typed=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; than a domain specific media type. Okay, that sounds like rubbish, I\n&gt; =\r\nknow - but let me explain:\n&gt; \n&gt; - as I stated above, a domain specific medi=\r\na type lets you derived\n&gt; useful information from a resource without making=\r\n any assumptions\n&gt; about its underlying type.\n&gt; \n\nI might agree with that, =\r\nif generic media types didn&#39;t have\nextensibility mechanisms like, oh I dunn=\r\no, link relations...  AFAIC,\ndomain-specific media types _are_ assumptions =\r\nabout the underlying\ntype, i.e. an &quot;order&quot; is too unique a snowflake to exp=\r\nress generically;\nwhat other conclusion *can* be drawn about how vnd.order*=\r\n types are\nused in practice?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - whereas a generic media type forces the=\r\n client to magically assume\n&gt; the resource has a specific type with specifi=\r\nc properties you can\n&gt; extract from the generic payload.\n&gt; \n\nOK, this is wh=\r\nere these discussions always lose me.  A browser needs to\nknow *nothing* ab=\r\nout resource type, to allow a user to place an order\nfrom, like, a bazillio=\r\nn different websites.  In REST, the client just\nneeds to know how to manipu=\r\nlate generic hypertext controls.  What is it\nabout order processing that ma=\r\nkes folks think the client needs to know\nthat it&#39;s processing an order?\n\n-E=\r\nric\n\nNow playing, ***** stars for sure:\nhttp://archive.org/details/gd1970-1=\r\n1-06.aud.evans.3338.sbefail.shnf\n\n"}}
