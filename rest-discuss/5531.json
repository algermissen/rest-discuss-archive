It\n&gt; will be hard to maintain when there are more forms in an\n&gt; application, if we hardcode those forms into client script.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been thinking about using AHAH. For example, to create\n&gt; the ProfileEdit form on-fly, we first GET a html representation\n&gt; of the form (from another URL), grab data from original Joe&#39;s\n&gt; Profile page & fill-in the fields using DOM tricks (by matching\n&gt; their ids?), then replace the page with the form. Or maybe we\n&gt; can fill-in the fields straight away at server-side before\n&gt; sending the form to browser?\n\nOh, I just rendered both versions on the server side, with the\nedit form in a div with style=&quot;display: none&quot;. Use your favorite\nWeb UI framework to manage the complexity. And on a successful\n&quot;save&quot; I just forced a reload of the entire page, to re-render\nboth the text and the form with the latest values (again without\naffecting the browser history). For some other widgets I had an\nAJAX request just return an HTML fragment.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
