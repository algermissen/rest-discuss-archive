I haven&#39;t found any good answers.\n\n&gt; This could just be due to my poor understanding of caching, but I think\nthe issue\n&gt; simply goes to the heart of REST. Only objects which are truly resources,\nthat is informationally significant,\n&gt; should be assigned URIs.\nI&#39;m not sure this is a good constraint or not. I think of it in terms of\n&#39;overlapping&#39; resources. I don&#39;t know that it /can/ be avoided in any\npractical system.\n\n&gt; Further, all messages should be coarse-grained and represent the complete\nstate of the resource.\nAll for that. I still don&#39;t rule out &#39;overlapping&#39; resources though. I&#39;d\nlike to hear some more discussion on this point.\n\n"}}
