I publicly thank Glenn Block for his ins=\r\night and ideas in the article. So that is the first part of my request here=\r\n, I know you all may have something to comment :D\n\nThe second part of my re=\r\nquest is regarding the second part of the article: After we have the model,=\r\n we need to provide an evaluation of the current frameworks! That evaluatio=\r\nn I did long ago and without the model. Now, I do not use all the framework=\r\ns of course, so it will be great if some of you may take a look at the mode=\r\nl, then review the framework you most work with or know, and let me know wh=\r\nat level of support (based on the model) do you think that framework offers=\r\n. It will be great including all platforms, from PHP tp Java, .NET, Ruby an=\r\nd any other scripting language around. Now, please bear in mind this is not=\r\n a competition, where higher level means that framework wins. As stated in =\r\nthe article, even level 1 fully supports REST, only the developer may need =\r\nto do some extra work to get there. What we are looking for is evaluating t=\r\nhe frameworks in a way that helps the framework makers and the users to ide=\r\nntify the needs and solutions. It is like suggesting a tool and testing it =\r\nin the field for tuning. \n\nThanks to all and I&#39;ll appreciate any comment, b=\r\ne that here or in the article at DeveloperFusion. Thanks a lot!\n\nWilliam Ma=\r\nrtinez.\nArticle Link: http://www.developerfusion.com/article/141194/evaluat=\r\ning-rest-frameworks-part-1-a-maturity-model/\n\n\n"}}
