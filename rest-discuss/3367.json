Any information\n&gt;that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal\n&gt;service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a collection of other\n&gt;resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other\n&gt;words, any concept that might be the target of an author&#39;s hypertext\n&gt;reference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a\n&gt;conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds\n&gt;to the mapping at any particular point in time\n\nQuestion:\n\nBy my understanding of REST, the whole purpose of URIs is to provide a means\nof addressing a resource which is then available via the various HTTP verbs.\nIf so, then why *isn&#39;t* it just as easy to say &quot;A resource is an Object that\nexists on a network&quot;?\n\nWhile I will concede the &quot;network&quot; point, since URIs can point to local\nresources, what good is a URI which points to nothing (ex: the various &quot;urn&quot;\nschemes) since it is not available via the HTTP verbs, and therefore is an\nisland unto itself, creating exactly the problem REST opposes? I know this\nbehavior is expressed in the very concept of URIs and is used extensively in\nRDF, but from what I gathered REST deals specifically with HTTP and\ntherefore it deals with, well, objects (resources) on a network.\n\nThanks,\n-dave\n\n\n"}}
