wrote:\n&gt;&gt; while i used HTML in some examp=\r\nles, the idea of transclusion and\n&gt;&gt; navigation are not limited to visual a=\r\nffordances. i cited x:include as\n&gt;&gt; one example and could have using LINK, =\r\nX:LINK, etc. in others. in an\n&gt;&gt; M2M scenario i have in mind (a real life e=\r\nxample, btw), a set of\n&gt;&gt; machines make requests of a server in order to ge=\r\nt &quot;work&quot; to complete\n&gt;&gt; (in this case documents and/or images to process in=\r\n various ways as\n&gt;&gt; indicated by data returned by the servers). these bots =\r\nrecognize (in\n&gt;&gt; one case) affordances that instruct the client to gather o=\r\nther data\n&gt;&gt; from other locations in order to complete a single document th=\r\nat is to\n&gt;&gt; be sent to the server for additional work. in another case, the=\r\n client\n&gt;&gt; recognizes affordances that instruct the client to go evaluate t=\r\nhe\n&gt;&gt; current state of the resource, select optimal values and submit them\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; to one or more servers for additional processing. and so forth.\n&gt;\n&gt; This=\r\n all sounds good but why should it matter if it&#39;s a link or an embed if\n&gt; i=\r\nt&#39;s not rendered to a human user? The client nevertheless has to understand=\r\n\n&gt; what to do with that specific resource in order to reach its goal - whet=\r\nher\n&gt; it&#39;s LE or LO doesn&#39;t really matter IMO. Or am I wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if i u=\r\nnderstand you, you are making a case for representations that\n&gt;&gt; indicate v=\r\nariance in what selections clients have; what action they\n&gt;&gt; can take. this=\r\n _seems_ to be at odds w/ what peter indicated to me in\n&gt;&gt; his reply.\n&gt;&gt; &lt;s=\r\nnip&gt;We have the uniform interface so any method may be called on any\n&gt;&gt; res=\r\nource.&lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt; do you think i am mis-representing peter&#39;s reply here?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I think so. I think Peter was referring to HTTP methods which are uniform\n=\r\n&gt; and available on all resource. Nevertheless those methods might not be\n&gt; =\r\nsupported and/or allowed for certain resources (at certain times).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; l=\r\net&#39;s steer clear of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; here. i am not making any\n&gt;&gt; clai=\r\nms or requirements of this type. =A0what i have stated to this point\n&gt;&gt; is =\r\nthat there are two types of _information_ i am interested in\n&gt;&gt; including i=\r\nn messages sent from server to client: protocol-level\n&gt;&gt; information and do=\r\nmain-specific information. I have given examples of\n&gt;&gt; protocol-level infor=\r\nmation that i can include in message designs. i\n&gt;&gt; have asserted that i am =\r\nunable to clearly indicate that same level of\n&gt;&gt; protocol information when =\r\nusing RDF-based media types. am i incorrect?\n&gt;\n&gt; That question here that ar=\r\nises for me is if you can really separate it that\n&gt; way!? Protocol level in=\r\nformation is in my opinion in most cases quite\n&gt; tightly coupled to the dom=\r\nain-specific information, i.e., the application\n&gt; domain. In HTML e.g. it&#39;s=\r\n hypertext documents and there it surely makes\n&gt; sense to have general hype=\r\nrlinks and forms. In RDF you are talking about raw\n&gt; data which is interlin=\r\nked. Since the way of presenting this data is entirely\n&gt; up to the client I=\r\n doubt that a &quot;form&quot; is an adequate abstraction.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i also concede that=\r\n you and Peter question whether the protocol-level\n&gt;&gt; information i have id=\r\nentified is _needed_ in messages from servers.\n&gt;&gt; Peter states:\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I am no=\r\nt sure why protocol method is important. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Why would a media typ=\r\ne need to encode [idempotency] information?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And you say:\n&gt;&gt; &quot;The dif=\r\nference between LO and LE ... just matters if a human being is\n&gt;&gt; looking a=\r\nt a rendered representation of the data &quot;\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &quot;[templates are] part o=\r\nf the presentational logic which is unimportant\n&gt;&gt; in M2M scenarios.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n don&#39;t question whether they are needed but whether it makes sense to\n&gt; sep=\r\narate them from the domain specific information. A MIME type is\n&gt; specifyin=\r\ng a format for a more or less specific application domain. That\n&gt; MIME type=\r\n also specifies how the protocol-level information has to be\n&gt; interpreted =\r\nso I&#39;m not sure if you can really separate them in the way you\n&gt; propose (a=\r\ns I understand it). IOW for me both are at the same level of\n&gt; abstraction.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine)\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; affordance, i use &quot;x:include&quot; quite often in M2M cases\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hmm.=\r\n.. Could you elaborate a bit on this? Why don&#39;t you simply\n&gt;&gt; include it,\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; i.e., merge it into the response instead of just linking to it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i=\r\n think the scenario i cited at the top of this reply answers to this\n&gt;&gt; poi=\r\nnt.\n&gt;\n&gt; I still don&#39;t really understand the difference. It is up to the dom=\r\nain\n&gt; semantics what the client does. Whether the protocol-level informatio=\r\nn says\n&gt; embed or link doesn&#39;t make any difference IMHO. But maybe you are =\r\nmore\n&gt; thinking of splitting the semantics into two parts which are: embed =\r\n(the\n&gt; client *has* to follow this link) + process it according the remaini=\r\nng\n&gt; domain semantics!?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in the implementations i create, not all pos=\r\nsible variables are\n&gt;&gt; acceptable in call cases, even if all variables are =\r\n_known_\n&gt;&gt; beforehand. in my work clients look in the message to see which =\r\nof the\n&gt;&gt; client&#39;s known variables are valid for this instance and (in some=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; cases) which are required/optional. there is even at least one case\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nwhere variables are group--dependent (if you supply x you MUST supply\n&gt;&gt; x,=\r\n etc.). these are time/instance dependent cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see why this s=\r\nhould be a problem..\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i program clients as state machines to be able =\r\nto recognize\n&gt;&gt; affordances and respond to them. some are quitre simple (im=\r\nmutable\n&gt;&gt; links for navigation). others are more involved (mutable templat=\r\nes for\n&gt;&gt; completing request bodies, URI templates, choices of one or more =\r\n&quot;next\n&gt;&gt; steps&quot; evaulated against a goal or other workflow of the client,\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; etc.).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the work i do right now is not a fixed set of =A0actions w/ =\r\nstatic,\n&gt;&gt; pre-defined parameters. knowing a set of static state transition=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; ahead of time is insufficient for this work. instead clients need to\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; be prepared to respond to representations returned by the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; May=\r\nbe you misunderstood me slightly here. All I wanted to say is that it\n&gt; doe=\r\nsn&#39;t matter whether your client looks for a link with rel=3D&quot;payment&quot; or a\n=\r\n&gt; JSON property &quot;payment&quot;: &quot;URI&quot;. It&#39;s just a different syntax, that&#39;s all.=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary t=\r\no\n&gt;&gt; describe\n&gt;&gt; &gt; basic control flows - something I planned to work on rat=\r\nher sooner\n&gt;&gt; than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; later.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i look forward to hearing more on this=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I just would have a bit more time :-(\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Markus Lanthale=\r\nr\n&gt; @markuslanthaler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Yahoo!
