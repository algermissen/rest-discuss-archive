It would a=\r\nlso be\n&gt;&gt; important for the client to understand any input options/requirem=\r\nents,\n&gt;&gt; too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think some useful bots or appliance-type applications=\r\n can be built\n&gt;&gt; in this way, esp. since the REST constraints greatly simpl=\r\nify the\n&gt;&gt; details of machine-to-machine interaction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; mca\n&gt;&gt; http://a=\r\nmundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;\n&gt; Another approach that I really think merits investiga=\r\ntion is CCXML&#39;s. It is an XML format for a state machine that processes cal=\r\nl control events (call being offered, answer call, call hung up, etc.). A C=\r\nCXML hypermedia processor interacts with the underlying platform via asynch=\r\nronous events. Events it receives advance the state machine. Event handlers=\r\n processed on transitions send events back down to the platform, run local =\r\njavascript, or cause page transitions via GET and POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; CCXML is comple=\r\ntely machine driven -- no human guiding the processing. But the hypermedia =\r\ndocument tells the CCXML engine how map local events into network requests.=\r\n Those requests yeild other documents with another mapping.\n&gt;\n&gt; This model =\r\nisn&#39;t that different from an HTML browser when you think about it. The brow=\r\nser receives keyboard and mouse events (or higher level events like &quot;onchan=\r\nge&quot;) and sends &quot;messages&quot; down to an underlying platform to repaint the scr=\r\neen. Certain events cause a page transition to occur.\n&gt;\n&gt; My point is that =\r\nyou don&#39;t need to &quot;replace the human&quot; if you look at hypermedia document pr=\r\nocessing this way. You just need to map the information in the document to =\r\nthe client&#39;s domain model. That&#39;s what the &quot;semantic info&quot; is really doing =\r\n-- but where people are having problems is that they only map the informati=\r\non one way (down to the platform). For example, microformats map the generi=\r\nc HTML tags to another domain model understood by certain clients. But they=\r\n usually don&#39;t include a mapping from platform events to actions/event hand=\r\nlers in the markup. Filling in this gap facilitates much more sophisticated=\r\n machine-driven processing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
