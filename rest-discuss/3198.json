Part of it for a lot\nof people is certainly &quot;mob mentality&quot;; that there&#39;s comfort in knowing\nthat the person beside you believes the same thing.  There&#39;s also the\nissue that mental models are hard to change, and getting this point for\nmany people requires a new one.  Combined, they&#39;re nasty.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
