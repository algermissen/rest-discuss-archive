First\n&gt; of all, it appears to be nice little RPC but then everyone agrees that\n&gt; RPC is dead for Web Services.\n\nTo clarify, what most Web services folks mean by &quot;RPC&quot; is fine grained\ninvocations, like getStockQuote() returning &quot;14.25&quot;.\n\nWhat I mean by &quot;RPC&quot; (and I think many on rest-discuss do too) is where\ndevelopers get to define the remote &quot;API&quot;, rather than having it\nprovided for them by the application protocol.\n\n&gt; People then argue that SOAP is good\n&gt; because it serves as an envelope and the processing patterns\n&gt; associated are useful. Well, it appears that even HTTP headers can do\n&gt; better jobs. \n\nActually, no, they can&#39;t, at least without jumping through hoops.  SOAP\nhas mandatory and scoped extensions, which HTTP can&#39;t do very easily.\nJust check out PEP and RFC 2774 to see an example of that.  Both those\nforms of extension are not backwards-compatible, so deployment issues\nabound too.\n\nOn the other hand, Waka&#39;s going to have both of those in there natively.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
