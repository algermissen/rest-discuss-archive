A system is that collection of com=\r\nponents organized and with particular interactions. Those may support diffe=\r\nrent applications, that are not more than a set of task to produce a goal. =\r\nA system is my computer, and applications uses some of the components to ac=\r\nhieve a goal.\n\nSo, you may create a system that supports several apps, even=\r\n some you didn&#39;t think of!\n\nNow, System is not an API. I actually argue abo=\r\nut the term REST API since it comes, I think, from the idea that REST is a =\r\nService or RPC replacement.\n\nAn API is a layer between your system and an e=\r\nxternal client. Of course, that client is not part of your system. The API =\r\nmay be. \nThe API may be a facade, or an adapter. If a facade, if the system=\r\n is REST, the API is a REST constrained simplification of the system.\nIf an=\r\n adapter, the API is something that will convert, say, RPC interactions int=\r\no REST interactions. \n\nThe most typical is you have non-REST system (SOA ma=\r\nybe, or a plain old OO) and you want to be REST. You create an API, Adapter=\r\n, that will allow REST like clients to use your OO system as a REST one. Th=\r\ne API will accept HTTP operations in one face, and in the other one will in=\r\nvoke object methods. \n\nSee how I see it?\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares. \n\n--- I=\r\nn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Eric J.

One may deem REST a\n&gt; &gt; layered-system architecture, jus=\r\nt as one may deem it a client-server\n&gt; &gt; architecture. The term &quot;system&quot; ma=\r\nkes a lot more sense than &quot;app&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &quot;application&quot; when discussing what a=\r\n REST developer actually develops.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The term I use interchangeably=\r\n with &quot;REST system&quot;, is &quot;REST API&quot;,\n&gt; usually dropping &quot;REST&quot; and just sayi=\r\nng &quot;API&quot; because REST is assumed\n&gt; in the context of this list.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
