It is then up to=\r\n the client (the client intent) to follow this rel (using an implicit GET r=\r\nequest) to retrieve the representation of the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as render=\r\ned in a specific media-type).\n\nExample 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://re=\r\nlations.example.com/new&#39; to (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can P=\r\nOST an item of the type communicated by it&#39;s current context.  This is the =\r\nproblem, I don&#39;t need to &#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that it can POST at a spec=\r\nific URI, because the available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the=\r\n resource.  What I need to do is examine the permitted methods (either by i=\r\nnspection of the &#39;Allow&#39; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to conv=\r\ney the permutations of method in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThanks =\r\nin advance\n\nPaul\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William Martinez Po=\r\nmares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi nikonguy74!\n&gt; Just to complement what =\r\nJan is saying:\n&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea o=\r\nf links is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but =\r\nthen there are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with=\r\n the actual resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What is this link referring to=\r\n? What other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add que=\r\nry parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it=\r\n expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add m=\r\nore information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint of what rela=\r\ntion the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page=\r\n, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with rel=3D&quot;next&quot;=\r\n will hint that following that link will get you to the next page of the bo=\r\nok. \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the=\r\n resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual resource/uri/do=\r\ncument. It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like say=\r\ning rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI with a P=\r\nOST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad pract=\r\nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If y=\r\nou are looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you the links =\r\npoints to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start aski=\r\nng that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using POST ope=\r\nration. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is already =\r\ndesigned in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically programm=\r\ned, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. So, you have there standard meta=\r\ninformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST and PUT,=\r\n the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specific sema=\r\nntics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applicable only to, s=\r\nay, banking applications). With that info you can program intelligent clien=\r\nts.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor and image are speci=\r\nal links that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you fo=\r\nund an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an image,=\r\n and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fe=\r\ntch that image with a GET and display it based on context and additional at=\r\ntributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world know=\r\ns it.  So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you have it =\r\nclear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attribute will=\r\n tell you everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt; --- In rest-disc=\r\nuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of =\r\nthe first questions i had was on rel link. I understand the basic premise b=\r\nehind rel attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact=\r\n with the link provider).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The premise of the rel attribute on link=\r\ns is (in the case of the HTML or Atom media types) to provide information a=\r\nbout the meaning of the link beyond &#39;this is a link&#39;. If you register your =\r\nrel name in the IANA registry, you can use the short name you registered, e=\r\n.g. &#39;next&#39; or &#39;up&#39;. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a=\r\n URI. Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If tha=\r\nt URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation, then that is=\r\n even better.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes=\r\n the need to implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do=\r\n when it sees your link rel value.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://foo/custome=\r\nrDetails&quot; ... /&gt; is conceptually the same as &lt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; ...=\r\n/&gt; and also as HTML&#39;s &lt;img src=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt; or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;.=\r\n..&quot;/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a user agent needs to be programmed t=\r\no do something with ... in order to have it do something with it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIOW, your browser downloads that image because it is programmed to do so. T=\r\nhis same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent compone=\r\nnt will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is programmed (=\r\nor configured) to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No magic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The effect of the hyperme=\r\ndia constraint is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a clien=\r\nt side programmer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across inst=\r\nead of the one you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of=\r\n loose coupling.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn&#39;t any c=\r\nontrol over the server side in networked systems. REST encourages you to de=\r\nal with that rather than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved. =\r\nAnd on top of that, REST provides a number of mechanism that optimize for *=\r\ndealing with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HTH,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the rel li=\r\nnk? Is it something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get docume=\r\nntation for new links added to a specific response) or something code can i=\r\nnteract with to determine what it needs to do? Unfortunately in the book th=\r\ney don&#39;t give an example of what a &quot;rel&quot; page would look like. For example =\r\nthe link:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhref:=3D&quot;http://restbucks.com/payment/1234&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you typed in=\r\n &quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot; into your web browser what would =\r\nyou see? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
