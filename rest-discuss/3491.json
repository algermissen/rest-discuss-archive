Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@v...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Multiple possible problems:\n&gt; &gt; 1. Loss of XML comments\n&gt; &gt;    Are they part of the infoset?\n&gt; &gt; 2. Loss of whitespace information\n&gt; &gt; 3. Loss of document-checksum abilities\n&gt; &gt; If I PUT a PGP-signed XML document, absent some\n&gt; &gt; convention about signing XML-infosets, I think we\n&gt; &gt; need to get back an identical document in order\n&gt; &gt; to verify my signature.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a general matter, would you want to PUT a\n&gt; &gt; MSWord6 document and GET a MSWord7 document?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not if I couldn&#39;t read it with MSWord6.  Any of the items listed\nabove all\n&gt; fall under &quot;can I use the GET version exactly like I use the PUT\nversion?&quot;\n&gt; If you don&#39;t care about comments, then it doesn&#39;t matter whether\nthey are\n&gt; stripped or not.  It all depends on your application.  Restricting\nPUT in\n&gt; ways that are more of a hinderance than a help to some applications\ndoesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem right.  Of course, a given application can always be more\nrestricitve\n&gt; if desired, but those same restrictions should not be forced on all\n&gt; applications (imho).\n&gt; \n&gt; Frankly, I have found little practical use for PUT.  It may be\nbecause it&#39;s\n&gt; too limiting.  It may be because it&#39;s too difficult to use in some cases\n&gt; (such as updating container resources).  In the end, about the only\nthing\n&gt; that it seems safe to use it for is creation of a new resource when\nyou have\n&gt; control over the URI space.  And even then, issues such as the one being\n&gt; discussed come up.\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT just can&#39;t win, no matter how hard it tries...\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@s...\n\nI&#39;m not sure why everybody thinks PUT is so limited and worse, why\neverybody thinks that GET must return _exactly_ what was previously\nPUT&#39;ted. Again, like all the HTTP verbs, the server gets to\n**_interpret_** the body of the PUT request however it wants. It does\nnot have to be a byte-for-byte copy (particularly since this reduces\nthe server to just a plain old fileserver). Further, the body of a PUT\nis a _representation_ of a resource and representations are logical\nconstructs which can be serialized to many different byte format and\nencoding schemes. \n\nThe server can add information, remove information, ignore\ninformation--heck it might even generate something completely\ndifferent. PUT, like the other verbs, is a logical operation\nrepresenting &#39;UPDATE&#39; (and it is analagous to SQL&#39;s UPDATE or most\nfile system&#39;s overwriting save). The way I see it, PUT provides a very\nelegant mechanism for a client to tell the server &#39;replace the data\nhere with this&#39; or &#39;change this data this way&#39; which is necessary when\nyou&#39;re sending representations back and forth.\n\nAlso, I really don&#39;t think PUT should be used for resource creation.\nThis is not only because PUT is idempotent and resource creation is\nusually a violent process full of side effects that it&#39;s not\nidempotent. Further, it&#39;s been my experience, that using PUT in this\nway just leads to all types of ambiguity and sutle bugs because\nneither the server or the client really know what&#39;s going on and it&#39;s\nalways unclear whether a resource is being created or simply updated.  \nSo, imo, use POST for resource creation and PUT for updating/overwriting.\n\n- Bo \n\n\n"}}
