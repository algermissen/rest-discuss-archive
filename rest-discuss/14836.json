Bowman wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I contend that the format of a representation is part of a\n&gt; &gt; system&#39;s=\r\n hierarchical data.  The proof is right there in curl,\n&gt; &gt; which sees no hi=\r\nerarchy when it&#39;s saving &#39;resource&#39; and\n&gt; &gt; &#39;resource.1&#39; to disk, while obv=\r\niously recognizing .pdf\n&gt; &gt; and .html as part of a hierarchy of representat=\r\nions, whether\n&gt; &gt; by direct dereferencing or by presence in a Content-Locat=\r\nion\n&gt; &gt; response header.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s an odd way to look at it. The &quot;format =\r\nof a representation\n&gt; is part of a system&#39;s hierarchical data&quot; if and only =\r\nif the path\n&gt; portion of the URI contains information to that effect. If no=\r\nt,\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t. The fact that some domains specifically do this does\n&gt; not=\r\n require them all to do so. Curl is suboptimal in this respect\n&gt; since it d=\r\noes not differentiate responses based on the query\n&gt; string component.\n\nMor=\r\ne to the point, one implementation doesn&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; anything.\n\n&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s =\r\nstill treating URIs opaquely -- links are derived from\n&gt; &gt; the link relatio=\r\nns in the source documents, which are read from\n&gt; &gt; @href&#39;s. There is no an=\r\nalysis of those @href contents by keyword\n&gt; &gt; or filename extension to dete=\r\nrmine &quot;resource type&quot;.  Clients\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t required to know any specifics o=\r\nf a URI&#39;s pattern.  That\n&gt; &gt; would be coupling, which is diametrically oppo=\r\nsed to the notion\n&gt; &gt; of URI opacity in REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely correct. That=\r\n behavior should be extended to query string\n&gt; components of the URI as wel=\r\nl.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t get carried away by saying that my treating URIs as\n&gt; &gt; hie=\r\nrarchical or testing whether they have fragments or not,\n&gt; &gt; amounts to a f=\r\nailure to treat URIs as opaque.  Can you point\n&gt; &gt; to some constraint in RE=\r\nST that I&#39;m breaking?  Can you find any\n&gt; &gt; support from Roy to back up thi=\r\ns notion that URI opacity means\n&gt; &gt; that query and filename extension are t=\r\nhe same?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure. I used to take your position but corrected myself [1] b=\r\nack\n&gt; in 2005, complete with Fielding quotes and RFC 3986 references ;)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Are there any\n&gt; &gt; generic URI parsers you can point me to, which treat =\r\nquery\n&gt; &gt; strings opaquely?  Or do they all consider &#39;?&#39; to be a reserved\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; character?\n&gt; \n&gt; The &#39;?&#39; character does have a special meaning: it separa=\r\ntes the\n&gt; hierarchical portion of the URI from the opaque part. But the\n&gt; o=\r\npaque part is still part of the identifier.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the onus is not on me=\r\n to prove that Roy isn&#39;t being clear\n&gt; &gt; as daylight when he says that &quot;que=\r\nry is not a substitute for\n&gt; &gt; identification of resources&quot;, but on you who=\r\n think it could\n&gt; &gt; possibly mean any different to support *your* arguments=\r\n.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; When I read that statement from Roy [2], I don&#39;t see any indica=\r\ntion\n&gt; that it&#39;s about &quot;query&quot; as a URI component; instead, it is regarding=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;query&quot; as a means of fetching a list of resources. Roy&#39;s point\n&gt; seems =\r\nto be that returning 38 items in a list within a single\n&gt; response is no su=\r\nbstitute for having distinct URI&#39;s for each of\n&gt; those 38 individual resour=\r\nces.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Robert Brewer\n&gt; fumanchu@...\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://groups.goo=\r\ngle.com/group/cherrypy-devel/msg/0fcc62df334bc9ed\n&gt; [2] http://roy.gbiv.com=\r\n/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-720\n\n\nRight, I w=\r\nasn&#39;t talking about URI syntax at all.  Any server developer\nwould know tha=\r\nt the URI syntax of the request-target (URI path and query)\nhas absolutely =\r\nno correlation to any specific &quot;kind&quot; of resource mapping\nor implementation=\r\n.
