If he wants to think \nwe are against GUIs (!?!?!?) then I&#39;ll just take a deep breath and let \nhim think what he wants. I was glad to read that Dave believes that SOAP \nis about taking the Internet and treating it like a LAN. I couldn&#39;t have \nsaid it better myself. ;)\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
