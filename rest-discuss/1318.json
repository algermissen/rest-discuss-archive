It has a very complicated \nstate machine expressed through hypertext. The hypertext expression \nhas a variety of advantages like for instance (if it is well \nimplemented) I can send some body a URL from the middle of the state \nmachine and they can continue with the computation without worrying \nabout which state it was in. By examining the referenced document \nthey can determine the state. This is preferable to having separate \nstate machines on the client and the server and requiring them to \nstay in sync. I think it is better to let the server own the state \nmachine totally and tell the client where it is in the process. I \nwonder if this wouldn&#39;t be easier to discuss on a mailing list like \nrest-discuss? -- PaulPrescod&quot;\n\nI&#39;m hoping that a Wiki page will lead to more convergence than rest-\ndiscuss, and result in a coherent document or set of same.  If nobody \nparticipates, I&#39;ll understand that it was a bad idea and do something \nappropriate with the Wiki page.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
