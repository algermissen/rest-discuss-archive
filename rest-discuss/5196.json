My\nproblem is that I see at least two options and I cannot base a choice\nfore either one of them on a design principle (and I just hate arbitrary\ndecisions not backed up by a reason).\n\nThe issue is propably interesting and maybe someone can help me out.\nHere is the situation:\n\nI am having a network of several hosts (say C1...C42), a special host\nM running a network monitoring application and a host X running a\ndatabase with configuration information about the hosts C1...C42.\n\nThe goal is to generate part of the monitoring application&#39;s config\nfile (what hosts to monitor, their IP addresses, names etc.) from the\ndatabase running on X.\n\nThe database comes as a Web application and among others there is\na resource for the site (suppose it is named &#39;SITE&#39;) as a whole:\n\nhttp://ex.org/db/items/SITE\n\nA GET on this URI with an Accept header of application/rdf+xml will\ngive me an RDF graph including general site information and all the\nhosts that make up the site and information about the hosts (addresses,\nfunctionality and the like).\n\nNow, how do I use that information to generate the monitoring config  \nfile?\n\nOption 1: Write a script to be started on the monitoring host M that  \ndoes\n           the following:\n           - GET the site RDF graph\n           - extract the host data from it and generate the file\n           - put the file in the rigth place\n           - restart monitoring application\n           - side issue: send errors/debugging information via POST to\n             a resource that is the foo:error_processor_resource of the\n             site (we discovered the URI of that resource from the  \nsite&#39;s\n             RDF graph, too)\n\n           There is an OO pattern called &#39;Transaction Script&#39; which  \nseems\n           to cover option 1 (conceptually, there might be other HTTP\n           request involved in the script&#39;s flow).\n\nOption 2: Since the monitoring application is a noun, shouldn&#39;t it  \nactually\n           be a resource? As well as the config file itself? This option\n           would mean to set up a tiny HTTP server with at least two  \nresources\n\n           http://host-M.ex.org/monitoring-app\n           http://host-M.ex.org/monitoring-app/host-config-file\n\n           The config file resource could be implemented in a way  \nthat would\n           allow me to POST the site RDF graph to it and have the rest\n           being managed by the resource itself. After that, I could  \nsomehow\n           send a request  to the monitoring system resoure to have  \nit restart.\n\n           With this option, logging would be (very naturally) done to a\n           local HTTP access log, which  is a pretty common place to  \nlook\n           for stuff if something breaks.\n\nLet&#39;s ignore any issues of the amount of work, system admin&#39;s  \ndecisions and the\nlike for now. What principles could I use to make a choice for option  \none or\ntwo?\n\nWhat I find interesting in particular is the issue of who\nactually triggers the 1. start of the script or 2. the sequence of  \nGET on\nsite URI and POST to config file URI (a transcation script too I  \nsuppose).\nIn case 1. it can only be a some administrator logging in to M and  \nstarting\nthe script. With option two, there are much more possibilities for  \nhaving\nother events trigger the config file generation.\n\nHmm...maybe that  is the principle already: greater reusability or  \nbeing able to\nplug in filters between the GET and the POST in case there is a  \nsemantic change in\nthe RDF graph I GET.\n\nThoughts?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n_______________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer                         \nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;   \nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
