Townley&quot; &lt;andrew.townley@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Back to the scalability issue, you actually do have this sort of issue\n&gt;&gt; with web pages as well, it&#39;s just that the cost of replicating the\n&gt;&gt; current state of the resource to across a server farm is much less\n&gt;&gt; because those resources don&#39;t change often, and if they do change,\n&gt;&gt; people may be able to live with stale information for a short period of\n&gt;&gt; time until the replication process is complete.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; With a session based model the state has to be distributed and locking\n&gt; mechanisms put in place to ensure transactional consistency.\n&gt;\n&gt; With REST, you can maintain the state of the resource in the resource\n&gt; and simply redirect people to the correct resource.\n&gt;   \nBut then, the resource has to be distributed. And now the state of the \nresource will change as often as the session would have, had you been \nusing one. Which makes it just as hard to distribute.\n\nI guess you&#39;re implying there are more or better tools to handle \ndistribution of resources (including frequently changing ones?) than \nthere are to handle distribution of Sessions.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
