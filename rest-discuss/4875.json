I want to provide as much &quot;accessibility&quot;. The REST principle\n&gt; which uses PUT, OPTIONS, and other semantics seem not to be synchronized\n&gt; with my goals. My views are simpler, the only methods are &quot;GET&quot; (simple\n&gt; retrieve), and &quot;POST&quot; (retrieve with additional [i.e., large]\n&gt; information).  I also am not really fond of the idea of using more HTTP\n&gt; headers than what&#39;s already defined, and I even think some of these\n&gt; headers are redundant (they should also be contained in the document\n&gt; itself, such as content language and encoding). However I like the idea of\n&gt; using HTTP status codes as response codes. Actually my web sites are\n&gt; already implemented this way. Even though you see a simple user-friendly\n&gt; error page, the returned error code is actually quite significant (usually\n&gt; 503).\n\nCool.  I&#39;d caution you not to use POST for retrieval -- especially of\nlarge resources -- since you then loose some of the most widely deployed\nfeatures of HTTP [in internet intermediaries] -- cache-maintenance,\nconditional- and range- retreival, &c.   Microsoft Window&#39;s BITS\n[Background Intelligent Transfer Service], for instance, does a set of\ndate-conditional ranged-GETs over time to progressively download files.\n\nIn fact using just GET/POST and a subset of HTTP headers is arguably the\n_most_ RESTful thing you could do. :)\n\n\n&gt; I guess this &quot;solves&quot; the problem, the solution being somewhat\n&gt; proprietary, since I am now certain that there is no such thing as &quot;SHARE&quot;\n&gt; currently. Even Amazon calls it RESTful. Let&#39;s call it SHARE, which is\n&gt; (IMHO) a subset of the REST concept. :-)\n\nI made up the SHARE name last last friday in frustration that Amazon\nspecifically is calling their GET-modifies-state, RPC interface &quot;REST&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s not a subset of REST; REST is a subset [a more-constrained set] of\narbitrary-RPC architectural styles.\n\n\nI think for a variety of historical reasons, the two things [REST and\nSHARE] are conflated inappropriately.  While I&#39;m glad service-providers\nare offering something simpler than SOAP(-RPC), XML-RPC, CORBA, DCOM,\n&c. interfaces, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s necessarily RESTful.  It&#39;s not\nnecessarily a Bad Thing that it&#39;s not RESTful, but it just can&#39;t use the\nsame name; words need to have specific meanings.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
