It could have been named\n| /find-artist (but this URI is not restful because it is a\n| verb or service, I think).\n\nI doubt the architectural impact of a name choice is\nreally that significant.\n\n| Looking back at my original post it is completely wrong.    B^(\n| I used /artist?name=Lisa%20Simpson and /artist?eye-color=Blue to\n| return an &lt;artistlist&gt; so I cannot then use the same URI to return\n| an individual artist. Perhaps /find-artist would be more appropriate.\n\nIf /artist is understood to identify a set of artists, and /artist?&lt;query\nparams&gt;\nis then understood to be a set of artists where the set contents is\ndetermined via &quot;set comprehension&quot; (as opposed to set enumeration),\nthen the result of dereferencing these URIs is still a set, which could\n\n    a) be empty\n\n    b) contain a &quot;singleton&quot;, or\n\n    c) contain two or more artists\n\nAs I suggested before, rather abstractly (and then Roy made quite\nconcrete), in the case of b) above, the server might just like to\nredirect the client to the URI for that individual.  That&#39;s a nice\nidiom for &quot;you found exactly one&quot;.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
