Recent threads have gone on forever with circular\n&gt;&gt; arguments about arcana.\n&gt;\n&gt; No doubt I&#39;m part of the culprits, but what do you expect? Questions\n&gt; such as about URI construction have been beaten to death (at least\n&gt; since I joined). Furthermore, there are very different opinions on\n&gt; the matter on this discussion list. So anyone who proposes something\n&gt; with specificity will probably get a rebuttal. Also, if the response\n&gt; only required posting a link to a community wiki page rather than\n&gt; reviving an entire discussion, then it would also be more likely that\n&gt; one of us would help.\n\nI wasn&#39;t naming names.  And those are all good suggestions.\n\nA few more suggestions:\n\n* When you see a thread turn into a circular argument (with two or\nmore people just restating the same arguments over and over), put it\nout of its misery, possibly by invoking some new variant of Godwin&#39;s\nLaw.  Or at least do not state your same opinion one more time.\n\n* If it&#39;s a permathread, refer back to a previous instance instead of\ncontinuing the current one.\n\n* If the question is from a beginner, be nice and explain more.\n\nBut those are all obvious, too.\n\n"}}
