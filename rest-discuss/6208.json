It is to me.\n&gt; My clearest idea is that a POST &#39;updates&#39; an existant resource\n&gt; a PUT &#39;creates&#39; a new one.\n\nPOST acts upon an existing resource. The effects of this are pretty \nlimitless in terms of what it may do both to the existing resource, and \nother related resources. Essentially it &quot;gives&quot; one resource to another \nresource and the recipient resource deals with this as it sees fit.\n\nPUT &quot;writes&quot; - it either updates and existing resource or creates a new one.\n\nWith some applications it can be difficult or impossible for a client to \nknow what URI would be appropriate for a new resource. In such cases one \nsolution is to have a resource that handles the creation of new \nresources. One POSTs a representation of the new resource to the \ncreation-handler resource and the new resource is created (the most \nreasonable response from the server is then a 201 Created with the URI \nof the new resource, though 202 Accepted might be necessary.\n\nIf on the other hand it&#39;s entirely clear what URI should be used for the \nnew resource, then one should just PUT to that.\n\nTo summarise:\n\nPUT updates or creates new resources.\n\nPOST acts upon resources in arbitrary ways, and just one example of what \nthis can be is creating a new resource when the client lacks the \ncomplete information to do so (in particular the appropriate URI).\n\nPOST can do just about anything, but it is bad practice to use it to \nmimic another verb.\n\n"}}
