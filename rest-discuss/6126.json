Although having to submit numerous\n&gt; HEAD requests for each file in a directory just to obtain a detailed\n&gt; directory listing can be brutal.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, using HEAD does not solve the problem of obtaining the\n&gt; list of files and subdirectories in an arbitary directory.  Do I just\n&gt; call:\n&gt;         http://www.example.org/my/directory/\n&gt;\n&gt; and hope that there is not any &quot;index.html&quot; file there so that I can\n&gt; harvest the hyperlinks and look for those that start with that URL?\n&gt; Surely there must be a better way?\n\nAh. I see what you mean.\n\nYou&#39;d need backend implementation support for this.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes. I&#39;m working on one as well where the meta data is communicated\n&gt;&gt; with JSON. I hope to make a linux implementation of the client. At the\n&gt;&gt; moment it&#39;s FUSE based.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the online-storage system you are working RESTful?  And if so, would\n&gt; it be possible to get a temporary (1 week or so) test account to test my\n&gt; REST client against it?\n\nI&#39;ll try and check in my code (to a public location) so you can set it\nup. I&#39;ll let you know.\n\n\nBut I think you&#39;re misunderstanding what REST is. REST is just an\narchitecture. It&#39;s not a standard for doing anything or a framework or\nanything.\n\nWhen people talk about RESTful web services they mean ones that are\nprovided via HTTP only. There is no RPC mechanism sat on top.\n\nSo the similarities between these services are about HTTP. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve found\n&gt;&gt; http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/DirectoryRestlet.html\n&gt;&gt; very intuitive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quite useful, thank you.  Although I am working on a REST client, so I\n&gt; would need to find HTTP/XML output.  Do you know the output from this\n&gt; Java Servlet implimentation of REST is similar to those used by RESTful\n&gt; online storage services such as amazon?\n\nProbably not. Each service will probably use it&#39;s own format.\n\nJSON or RSS/ATOM are probably the most common for describing resource\ncollections.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
