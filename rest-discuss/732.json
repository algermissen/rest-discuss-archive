For example, status code 205 goes all the way up to the UI\nlevel:\n\n205 Reset Content\n    The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent SHOULD reset\n   the document view which caused the request to be sent. This response\n   is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place via\n   user input, followed by a clearing of the form in which the input is\n   given so that the user can easily initiate another input action. The\n   response MUST NOT include an entity.\n\nIt&#39;s important to be able to distinguish transport errors from application\nerrors, since a request might be be legal HTTP but have illegal parameter\nvalues as far as the resource is concerned.  And it&#39;s very useful to use\nthe response headers to communicate application status, because otherwise\nthe application needs to define a new format within the message body, and\nthe message body may be reserved for other information.\n\nSOAP et al already have definitions for application status codes and SOAP\net al are really useful for application-level envelopes, if not for\nnode-level semantics, but Joe Schmoes&#39;s app shouldn&#39;t have to depend on\nthem just to communicate application status codes.  So I&#39;m going to\npropose a strawman for application status codes in the response headers.\nI don&#39;t mean to create a &quot;standard&quot; for interop.  I do mean to solicit\ncomments and discussion of how appropriate it is use response headers for\napplication-level info, and of how good the proposed scheme is.\n\nProposal for application status codes: An application can return status\ncodes in response headers titled &quot;Application-Response-Code.&quot;  There can\nbe 0 or more such response headers.  The value of a\nApplication-Response-Code field may contain three elements, a numeric\nfield code, a textual explanation, and a text value to say the object of\nthe error.  The fields are comma delimited.  Commas are illegal values in\nthe numeric field code or the textual explanation.  The commas are\nrequired -- a well-formed Application-Response-Code will always have at\nleast two.  The meaning of Application-Response-Code is orthogonal to the\nmeaning of the HTTP status code; there is no requirement that the HTTP\nstatus code be 200 OK, for example.\n\nThoughts?\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
