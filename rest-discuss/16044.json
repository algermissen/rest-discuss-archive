It must be Frida=\r\ny or something, this is one of those\nfundamental REST design patterns that&#39;=\r\ns simply beyond dispute.  If I\ncan create form markup that builds that quer=\r\ny, and return 400 for any\nvalue over 360 or under -360, well, that&#39;s about =\r\nas simple as hypertext\nREST APIs get.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
