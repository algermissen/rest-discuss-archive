And useful.\n\nThat&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s off topic.  We were talking about how you\ncan use REST to evaluate a system.  What you describe above\nwould not be an instance of that.  Even if you operationally demonstrate\nyou system scales as you would like it to, it implies nothing about\nits architecture or REST.\n: \n: \n: &gt;\n: &gt; As far as &quot;clear &#39;this is bad&#39; marks, there is more clarity (negative)\n: &gt; in finding counterexamples than there is clarity (positive) in not\n: &gt; finding any.\n: \n: I really don&#39;t think Bills idea was a total load of codswallop.\n: Do you?\n: I guess we can all put forward negative views.\n\nNo, and I have no idea why you&#39;re saying that.  Maybe I wasn&#39;t\nclear enough.  Let me try again:  It is very hard if not impossible\nto prove that a given system uses stateless interactions only.  However,\nit is possible to catch the system in an instance of a stateful one.\nIt is also possible to spend a lot of time probing a system in search\nof a stateful exchange, and to not find one.  That would be a good\nsign, for sure, but it would not be a proof.  This is about the best\nwe can do, as far as I know.\n\nIt&#39;s not a negative view; it&#39;s just the laws of physics.\n\n: &gt; Similar to CMM assessments,\n: I don&#39;t know what CMM assessments are.\n\nAssessments of software capability maturity, based on examination\nof artifacts of the process.\n\n\n: &gt; anymore than the SEI calls the CMM assessments tests (they\n: &gt; don&#39;t).\n: \n: Neither acronym is meaningful to me.\n\nThen my analogy must not have been very useful to you.  This won&#39;t\nhelp that much, but at least for the record:\n\nCMM = capability maturity model\nSEI = software engineering institute\n\n: &gt; &quot;Ruler&quot; is too simplistic a metaphor for this.\n: \n: OK. your view.\n: It&#39;s the most promising start I&#39;ve seen that might allow the REST of us\n: to view a system.\n: \n\nAs long as you are viewing the system through REST, fine, but\nI haven&#39;t seen a proposal from you on that.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
