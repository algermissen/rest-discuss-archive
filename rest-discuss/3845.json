I\n&gt; understand\n&gt; syntax error to be a condition that aborts meaningful processing, and this\n&gt; is application level protocol, so the status code should tell us about how\n&gt; effectively state was transferred, not how effectively bits were\n&gt; transported.\n\nAgreed.  If the state was transferred such that it was &quot;processed&quot;, then\nit&#39;s a success.  One can, I believe, quite reasonably define &quot;processed&quot;\nto include determining whether an XML document was well-formed or not\n... if that meets your needs.\n\n&gt; &gt; Because it&#39;s an error.  An error response describes the specifics of the\n&gt; &gt; error, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,\n&gt; &gt; except to do a logical &quot;Back&quot;; as far as the state of the application is\n&gt; &gt; concerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Back&quot; seems more like a browser idiom.  I would say that the absence\n&gt; of a 2xx is the absence of a forward transition, which leaves application\n&gt; state\n&gt; right where it was.  In this case, the &quot;way to proceed&quot; is to correct syntax\n&gt; and try again.  What am I missing?\n\nNo, you got it, that&#39;s what I meant.  &quot;Back&quot; from the &quot;400 page&quot;, so to\nspeak.\n\n&gt; Another thought: the details of a malformed request and an aborted\n&gt; state transition are analogous to (or perhaps just examples of)\n&gt; conversational state.  Not part of the &quot;application state&quot; model.\n\nHmmm.. dunno.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unsure about specific status codes can/should punt and use the x00\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the appropriate category?  Doesn&#39;t seem to say that in 2616 for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 400 family.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sec 6.1.1;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required\n&gt; &gt;  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\n&gt; &gt;  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n&gt; &gt;  understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n&gt; &gt;  digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n&gt; &gt;  x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an\n&gt; &gt;  unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, thanks.  So it would seem the part of 2616 that says 400 is about\n&gt; syntax error specifically kind of violates that class/subclass thing, since\n&gt; other 4xx responses are not about syntax.  Season to taste?\n\nDunno, you&#39;ll have to ask the editors.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
