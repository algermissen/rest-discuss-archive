And I\nlost=\r\n already several hours looking to support some decisions that in the end\nwe=\r\nre plain wrong.\n\nSo let me start by saying that I do believe if you are bui=\r\nlding systems to\nthe web - from static pages to more or less complex applic=\r\nations like\nshoping-carts - you should really stick to well-known media-typ=\r\nes like html.\nI would dare even to say you *must* stick to well-know media-=\r\ntypes.\n\nHowever, REST is much more than *the web*. Iit is a style for &quot;Netw=\r\nork-based\nSoftware Architectures&quot; of wich the web is one example. There are=\r\n lots of\nother &quot;Network-based Software Architectures&quot;, inside the enterpris=\r\ne, outside\nthe enterprise conecting a limited number of companies, either u=\r\nsing\nproprietary networks or using the Internet infrastructure - and let&#39;s =\r\nus\nrememeber that the web is not the only service that runs over the intern=\r\net.\nAnd for such cases, it is simply not true the assertion that is mandato=\r\nry to\nuse html or stick to only well knows media types. In some cases it wi=\r\nll be\nthe best choice, in other custom media types will be the best choice.=\r\n\n\nAlso, with this I&#39;m not saying that the use of other media-types besides =\r\nthe\nwell-knows should be made *at a aplication level*. No, if you need to d=\r\nesign\ncustom media-types they shoul not be specific to the *application lev=\r\nel* but\nto the *domain level* - or higher if possible - of that application=\r\n.\n\nNow let me say that this is my POV only, my opinion, I don&#39;t say that th=\r\nis\nwill hold true for all cases, but is a opinion based in the opinion of\no=\r\nther&#39;s, and that make sense to me not only in the realm of REST but in the\n=\r\nmore general realm of Software architecture design or - to refer to another=\r\n\nrecent post - in the more general realm of &quot;Timeless way of building&quot; -\nme=\r\naning the use of patterns that is common to all types, or styles, of\nsoftwa=\r\nre architecture.\n\nIn other post I quoted Roy about this - and I don&#39;t like =\r\nto quote  Roy, as\nI&#39;ve seen the exactly same sentence being quoted in this =\r\nlist to prove both\none point and his opposite, but nevertheless I&#39;ll do it =\r\nagain:\n\n( The *** are mine)\n\n\n&gt; ***Obviously, I can&#39;t say that all data typ=\r\nes have to be *the* standard\n&gt; before they are used in a REST-based archite=\r\ncture.***\n&gt;\n&gt; (...)\n&gt;\n&gt; ***The degree to which the format chosen is a commo=\r\nnly accepted standard is\n&gt; less important than making sure that the sender =\r\nand recipient agree to the\n&gt; same thing***\n&gt;\n&gt; (...)\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, it is easier=\r\n to deploy the use of a commonly understood data format.\n&gt; However, ***it i=\r\ns also more efficient to use a format that is more\n&gt; specifically intended =\r\nfor a given application.***\n&gt;\n&gt; Where those two trade-offs intersect is oft=\r\nen dependent on the\n&gt; application.\n\n***REST does not demand that everyone a=\r\ngree on a single format for the\n&gt; exchange of data -- only that the partici=\r\npants in the communication\n&gt; agree.***\n&gt;\n&gt;  Beyond that, designers need to =\r\napply their own common sense and\n&gt; ***choose/create*** the best formats for=\r\n the job.\n&gt;\n\n\nI mean, I don&#39;t know much about English, but doesn&#39;t this mea=\r\nn something\nlike &quot;use standard-media types as the preferred choice, use cus=\r\ntom media\ntypes when standard media types are not the best choice?&quot;\n\nHow, a=\r\nfter reading this, can someone say &quot;Application-specific media types\nare no=\r\nt part of the REST style&quot;? Unless what is wrong here is the word\n&quot;applicati=\r\non&quot; - I agree that they should not be application-specific but at\nleast a o=\r\nrder of degree larger - domain-specific at least. But otherwise,\nit&#39;s not t=\r\nrue that &quot;specific media types are not part of the REST style&quot;.\n\n&quot;The trade=\r\n-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\n&gt; efficiency, since info=\r\nrmation is transferred in a standardized form\n&gt; rather than one which is sp=\r\necific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nAm I wrong in saying that &quot;standardiz=\r\ned form&quot; in the context of the\nuniform-interface means the one that was agr=\r\need by all the participants in\nthe system, and not the one&#39;s that were publ=\r\nished by IANA? - I&#39;m not sure\nhere, maybe I *do* am wrong. Let&#39;s say a comp=\r\nany has a relatively small\nnumber of clients and business-partners, say 20 =\r\nother companies. If that\ncompany agrees to exchange info - info that is bas=\r\nically to transfer data\nfrom one database to another database, so each comp=\r\nany can treat it the way\nthey see fit, not for human consuption on a browse=\r\nr - on a custom designed\nXML format , isn&#39;t that &quot;standard&quot; enough to fit i=\r\nn the concept of\n&quot;uniform-interface&quot;? And if tomorrow instead of 20 compani=\r\nes, it&#39;s 200 pr\n2000 companies, will that wont be true neverthless? The com=\r\npany don&#39;t want\nto exchange info with everione in the world - only specifie=\r\nd, known\ncompanies who whom they have some business agreement. They can eve=\r\nn agree\nthat info should *not* be human-readable for secuity purposes...

Application-specific media types are not part of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the REST style, and for good reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; My point is that is that html+g=\r\nd is a much an application specific\n&gt; media type as a custom xml format. No=\r\nt giving it a name does not\n&gt; change that fact. Once the server adds gd ann=\r\notations, and clients\n&gt; started depending on them, the representations beco=\r\nme application\n&gt; specific.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not oppose to domain specific represent=\r\nations so this does not\n&gt; really bother me. My concern is that a client tha=\r\nt needs html+gd, but\n&gt; asks for html is a lot less likely to get what it ne=\r\neds than a client\n&gt; that explicitly requests what it needs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  REST h=\r\nas nothing to do\n&gt; &gt; with negotiating between versions of an API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure =\r\nit does. The accept header allows the negotiation of API\n&gt; versions. Consid=\r\ner `accept: text/html` vs `accept:\n&gt; application/atom+xml`. One says the cl=\r\nient wants to interact with the\n&gt; html version of the api, the other says t=\r\nhe client wants to interact\n&gt; with the atom version of the api.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ref=\r\nerring once again to REST:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The trade-off, though, is that a unifor=\r\nm interface degrades\n&gt; &gt; efficiency, since information is transferred in a =\r\nstandardized form\n&gt; &gt; rather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s=\r\n needs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t get what you seem to get that from this quote. Later i=\r\nn the\n&gt; same section we get this paragraph.\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to obtain a unifor=\r\nm interface, multiple architectural\n&gt; constraints are needed to guide the b=\r\nehavior of components. REST is\n&gt; defined by four interface constraints: ide=\r\nntification of resources;\n&gt; manipulation of resources through representatio=\r\nns; self-descriptive\n&gt; messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of applicati=\r\non state.\n&gt;\n&gt; No where does that suggest there is some limit to the allowab=\r\nle number\n&gt; of representation flavors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your reading of the uniform inte=\r\nrface seems different than much of the\n&gt; community.\n&gt;\n&gt; RestWiki is pretty =\r\nquiet on the idea of limiting media types being\n&gt; part of the uniform inter=\r\nface in both the interface genericity&#39;s[1]\n&gt; and rest in plain english[2] p=\r\nages. Both seem to imply that domain\n&gt; specific media types would be ok.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov clearly states that multiple media types are acceptable\n&gt; i=\r\nn &#39;A Brief Introduction to REST&#39;[3].\n&gt;\n&gt; The result might be some company-s=\r\npecific XML format that\n&gt; represents customer information. ... Summary: Pro=\r\nvide multiple\n&gt; representations of resources for different needs.\n&gt;\n&gt; I cou=\r\nld keep going but that is enough. My point is not that any of\n&gt; these are a=\r\nuthoritative sources. (I don&#39;t believe in such nonsense.)\n&gt; But rather that=\r\n it seems that much of REST community does not hold\n&gt; your belief that html=\r\n is a fundamental, in inalienable, part of the\n&gt; uniform interface of the w=\r\neb.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps i am mis-reading the community or perhaps i am totally wron=\r\ng\n&gt; and html is key. I am willing to be convinced. However, the best\n&gt; outc=\r\nomes i have experienced in m2m systems using rest have come from\n&gt; using ex=\r\nplicitly named domain specific media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is certainly a trade =\r\noff between using existing media types and\n&gt; creating new ones. If an exist=\r\ning media type has the needed semantics\n&gt; it should definitely be used. How=\r\never, if no media type exists with\n&gt; the required semantics creating a new =\r\none that does seems superior to\n&gt; trying to infer such semantics from an ex=\r\nisting one based on out-of-band\n&gt; information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter\n&gt; &lt;http://barelyen=\r\nough.org&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]: http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?InterfaceGeneri=\r\ncity\n&gt; [2]: http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestInPlainEnglish#nid=\r\n68J\n&gt; [3]: http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--001636e909a309a523048d74ca5d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nI probably will regret again to jump into this kind of discussions, but it =\r\nbothers me that some things are said like they are absolute trues, written =\r\nin stone, when they are at the very least arguable.

I =\r\nam willing to be convinced.  However, the best&lt;br&gt;\noutcomes i have experien=\r\nced in m2m systems using rest have come from&lt;br&gt;\nusing explicitly named dom=\r\nain specific media types.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere is certainly a trade off between u=\r\nsing existing media types and&lt;br&gt;\ncreating new ones.  If an existing media =\r\ntype has the needed semantics&lt;br&gt;\nit should definitely be used.  However, i=\r\nf no media type exists with&lt;br&gt;\nthe required semantics creating a new one t=\r\nhat does seems superior to&lt;br&gt;\ntrying to infer such semantics from an exist=\r\ning one based on out-of-band&lt;br&gt;\ninformation.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeter&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://barelyenough.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://barelyenough.org&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[1]: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Inte=\r\nrfaceGenericity&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl=\r\n?InterfaceGenericity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n[2]: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-b=\r\nin/wiki.pl?RestInPlainEnglish#nid68J&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://rest.blueoxe=\r\nn.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestInPlainEnglish#nid68J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n[3]: &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\ninfoq.com/articles/rest-introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636e909a309a523048d74ca5d--\r\n\n"}}
