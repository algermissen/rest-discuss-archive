It  falls to the mail server to handle it so the\n&gt; app server can wash its  hands of the situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, say a GET request is cached (on the originating server or\n&gt; at any  hop along the way). Is that a side effect? If not, why\n&gt; not?\n\nThat’s not the right way to think about it.\n\nPretty much every web server keeps an access log, and will make\nmultiple entries in it if you make multiple identical GET\nrequests. This is a side effect outside the req/resp cycle, but\nthat doesn’t make logging and GET requests antithetical.\n\nThe question is who assumes responsibility for the side effect.\n\nGET requests are supposed to mean that the client is not asking\nfor any side effects whatsoever and cannot be held liable for any\nsuch side effects that the server decides to perform.\n\nIn case of keeping log files, the server doesn’t even *want* the\nclient to be responsible, so keeping logs of GET accesses is\nperfectly fine.\n\nFor an email being sent, OTOH, you want the client to bear full\nresponsibility, and that means you want anything but GET.\n\nBut if the server sent an email to the sysadmin every time\nanother 10,000 lines of access log records pile up, that would\nfall under “safe” since the server takes responsibility, it does\nnot the expect the client to do so.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can get to the verbs: sending an\nemail on the client’s responsibility is certainly not an\nidempotent side effect if it happens as many times as the request\nis repeated. Therefore as a first approximation you want POST.\n\nHowever, you could do something like mint a password request\ntoken that can be used only once, in which case the password\nrequest action becomes idempotent, and so you could then use PUT.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
