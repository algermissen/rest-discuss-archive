&gt; there; just need an XML schema to describe it and you&#39;d be done. More\n&gt; &gt; dangerously, it assumes that the resource can immediately start a\n&gt; &gt; synchronous state transition, which may or may not be the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;more dangerously&quot;... well if it couldn&#39;t you&#39;d clearly have to code\n&gt; for that wouldn&#39;t you?\n\nas long as the first you were coding against was async, yes. is when\nthe first thing you work against is sync (or so fast as to make no\ndifference) and then in production you hit the slow stuff.\n\nrealistically, interaction styles that resemble synchronous method\ncalls are the mostly likely to lead to bad assumptions; the ones where\nyou go\n\ntoggle(devicename) {\n Device d1=Lookup.find(deviceName);\n d1.enter_state(&quot;on&quot;);\n d1.ping();\n d1.enter_state(&quot;off&quot;);\n}\n\nbecause what works for toggle(&quot;/home/lights&quot;) causes problems when you\ngo toggle(&quot;/ch/cern/colliders/LHC&quot;).\n\n-steve\n\n\nou can queue up state change requests if that is what you want.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all we have here I think, unless I am missing something. The\n&gt; state reflected in the select could be &quot;switching to on&quot; for as long\n&gt; as it takes to confirm the next state (or whatever).\n&gt;\n\nI think the problem is not so much how to model it in REST, but how to\ninteract with things that take a long time to react. At least with\nREST you can poll state, there&#39;s no need to wait for a WS-Notification\nevent that will only arrive if you are on the same network, the\nfirewalls let it through and your laptop doesnt roam during the\noperation.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
