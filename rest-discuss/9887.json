According to the spec, if it is present in a response:\n&gt; \n&gt;       3. If the response includes the &quot;public&quot; cache-control\n&gt;          directive, it MAY be returned in reply to any\n&gt;          subsequent request.\n&gt; \n&gt; (section 14.8).\n\nYou only quoted half the text that’s relevant. Your excerpt is an\nitem in the list following this paragraph:\n\n    When a shared cache (see section 13.7) receives a request\n    containing an Authorization field, it MUST NOT return the\n    corresponding response as a reply to any other request,\n                                         ^^^\n    unless one of the following specific exceptions holds:\n    ^^^^^^\n\n&gt; Does that indicate that such a response can be served to:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Requests without Authorization header?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Requests with Authorization header, but no attempt is made\n&gt;    to authorize them?\n&gt; \n&gt; I understood public as:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Can be stored in public cache.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. But will only be served to a request with a valid\n&gt;    Authorization header, i.e. only to those identifying as the\n&gt;    same http user that previously requested it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any light?\n\nThe terms I highlighted in the spec quotation should make\nit pretty clear what the spec means. Note well that the word\n“authenticated” makes no appearance in that context.\n\n`Cache-Control: public` means “this representation isn’t private,\nyou are free to show it to other people.”\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
