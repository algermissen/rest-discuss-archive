As an example, consider a game where \nyou move from room to room, each room may have monsters to fight or \nitems to pick up and may have any number of exits. You might have two \nrooms with the same contents and the same exits, but exiting north from \nthe first room brings you to a different place than exiting north from \nthe second.  My first thought on representing this would be to have each \nexit be a hyperlink with a relative URI, and respond to the request to \nget one of the identical rooms with a protocol-level redirect (to the \nsame shared resource) that doesn&#39;t cause the client to change the \nmeaning of relative URIs. Do any REST-capable protocols (the only one I \nknow of is HTTP?) support this? Could they?\n\nThanks,\nShea\n\n"}}
