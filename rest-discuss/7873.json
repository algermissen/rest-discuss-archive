Though I have options\nlike osCommerece=\r\n and ZenCart I would like to go for something which\nhas exposed itself as w=\r\neb service ( preferably RESTful, why not ? :)\n). That will help me develop =\r\nmy client ( Ajax based with jQuery or\nsome other JavaScript framework ) wit=\r\nhout old,\nthrow-all-content-to-user shopping cart pages. I tried to search =\r\non\nnet but in vain. Infact have tried to search module for osCommerce (\nany=\r\nthing for that matter ) which gives me   all basic e-commerce\nfeature as we=\r\nb service, but couldn&#39;t find one. \n\nHave anybody come across piece of softw=\r\nare which can help me ? \n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSamyak\n\n\n\n"}}
