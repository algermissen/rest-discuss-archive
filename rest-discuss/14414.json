If there&#39;s no =\r\nstandardization effort involved, then the\n&gt; proprietary result fragments th=\r\ne Web and does not achieve the goals of\n&gt; REST, and as a consequence, canno=\r\nt be called REST or even REST* because\n&gt; of the lack of intent to use stand=\r\nards, a key element of the style.\n\nSorry, but I must say that this is a fal=\r\nlacious approach for building networked applications. The goal of building =\r\n*completely* decoupled applications (with *no* out-of-band knowledge) is as=\r\n unsound as the &quot;local-is-remote&quot; approach that RPC tried. The set of probl=\r\nems that demand that degree of decoupling is small, and extending that noti=\r\non to every application (to be branded RESTful to satisfy a particular inte=\r\nrpretation of REST) is prohibitively expensive. Even in the case of the web=\r\n, where things seem to work in an autonomous fashion, we need a &quot;human&quot; use=\r\nr to guess the semantics and drive the hypermedia engine for every applicat=\r\nion.\n\nLet&#39;s say, we start with your assertion that (a) everything must be c=\r\nommunicated in-band, and (b) the media type must be standard. Let&#39;s apply t=\r\nhis to Flickr as an example. To completely isolate clients from using any o=\r\nut-of-band information, you will have to come up with a &quot;specific&quot; format a=\r\nnd a media type for all representations (some some fragments there of) in F=\r\nlickr, and then standardize them. We will then repeat this process all over=\r\n again for every application that wants to be RESTful. The net result is a =\r\nzillion standards. The paradox of this approach is that, a zillion standard=\r\ns are as good as no standards. It does not matter whether such standardizat=\r\nion effort is focused on media types or formats or taxonomies.\n\nA more reas=\r\nonable thing to do is start off with some standard media types and formats,=\r\n and mix them up with some conventions to make representations specific to =\r\neach application domain. For example, using an atom:link in XML is a conven=\r\ntion. Using RFC-3339 for dates and times is another convention. Mixing RDFa=\r\n and microformats with HTML and XHTML is yet another convention. Such conve=\r\nntions don&#39;t aim to eliminate decoupling, but they reduce the amount of of =\r\nspecificity but leave room for evolution and promote interoperability. \n\nSu=\r\nbbu\n"}}
