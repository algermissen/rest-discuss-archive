There are some very nice ones out there, all of \nwhich differ slightly in their RESTfulness, implementation and \ndocumentation:\n\n- http://www.43things.com/about/view/web_service_api\n- http://textamerica.com/api.aspx\n- http://code.blogspot.com/archives/atom-docs.html\n- http://www.backpackit.com/api/\n- plus Google, Yahoo, etc.\n\nI&#39;d like to see whether we can use this approach, but have realized \nthat I&#39;m lacking tools that help me create a RESTful API.\n\nIn particular, it seems clear that one of the biggest challenges in \nREST is figuring out how to think about your functionality in terms \nof resources / documents rather than methods, and building your API \naround those concepts plus HTTP verbs. But if you look at the above \nexamples, they all have structured documentation but it is all \nslightly different in terms of what it describes (arguments, \nauthentication, example response, error codes, etc). I was wondering \nwhether you used any particular tools (or had recommendations) for \ndesigning and documentating this type of API in the form of developer \ndocumentation that would be suitable for sending out to folks for \ncomments. I&#39;m thinking of something like JavaDoc, but essentially for \na web-based API only (i.e. no implementation details).\n\nIn the absence of such tools, I&#39;ll just write it straight in HTML, \nbut it seems like a structured approach would help both from a design \nand a documentation standpoint, so I thought I&#39;d see if there were \nany suggestions for this. Note that these could be embedded in source \ncode as well (e.g. using @annotations in Java/Python to indicate \nwhether a given object is PUTtable). But I haven&#39;t seen anything like \nthis yet...\n\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nRamon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
