It&#39;s not fuzzy at all.  All that&#39;s\n&gt; fuzzy is the implementation details of what it means for the POSTed\n&gt; thing to be processed.  But that&#39;s implementation, not interface.\n&gt; The interface is quite clear.\n\nI was not really trying to attack the meaning of\nPOST.  My basic point is that using PUT or POST\nfor notify requires a prior arrangement that the\nURL being PUT/POSTed refers to the URL being\ninvalidated.\n\nHowever NOTIFY requires no prior arrangement and\nno subscription.  It is just a communication from\nthe client to the server telling the server that\nthe page is out of date (and that it may want to\ndo something about it).\n\nIf you want to request notification from a server\nthat is a totally separate protocol.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
