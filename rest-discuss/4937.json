Specifically, my web\n&gt; service &quot;accepts&quot; resources (its job is to collect information). Thus, a\n&gt; client POSTs a resource to my web service.  How would a client know what\n&gt; resource format my web service will accept?\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that I am concerned here with Machine-to-Machine processing (not\n&gt; Human-to-Machine processing).

Is there a RESTful way for clients to\n&gt; dynamically discover the correct format?  /Roger\n\n&quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; \n  manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive\n  messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s the last one that really applies in this case, that hypermedia\nis the engine of application state. Your client, through hypermedia,\ngets to a state where it is going to POST some data. The URI of \nwhere to POST the data is contained in, or derived from, the hypertext.\nIn addition, the type of data to POST should come from the same \nplace.\n\nFor example, HTML Forms have the &#39;enctype&#39; attribute, in addition\nto the &#39;action&#39; attribute.\n\n[1]http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-enctype\n\n    -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
