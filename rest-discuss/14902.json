Yes,\ninevitably, you end up doing pure &quot;atomic&quot; CRUD against, say, a SQL\ndatabase. But there&#39;s no reason you should be forced to exposed that\nlimited of an API to your clients. You should be able to have higher\nlevel interactions with your sever than just raw CRUD, actions that\nthemselves may manifest into sever primitive hits against your data\nstore.\n\nThe point of the Common Interface isn&#39;t so much to hamstring\napplications in to a pure CRUD HTTP view of the world, but rather to\nhelp ensure you don&#39;t simply run off hog wild creating eleventy\nzillion new verbs. Taking a constrained, conservative view at the verb\nlayer and how they&#39;re used can make the API easier to use, and more\napproachable, rather than a wiener dog nest of exceptions and special\ncases and what ifs. Consistent application of a consistent, common\ninterface.\n\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re limited solely to CRUD.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
