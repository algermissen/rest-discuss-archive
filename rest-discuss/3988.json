IMHO,\n&gt; abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\n&gt; are\n&gt; subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\n&gt; words:\n&gt; subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\n&gt; part\n&gt; of the architecture itself).\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\n&gt; include\n&gt; c) ?\n\nEvery thing (two words 8-) is a resource.  c) is automatically included\nby this definition, and to remove it would be arbitrary, and would\nlessen the power of the Web.\n\n&gt; The second question I have is related to the question what the\n&gt; semantics of a resource are.  Roy&#39;s dissertation says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the\n&gt;  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather\n&gt;  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the\n&gt;  time the reference is created.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the\n&gt; semantics of resources.\n\nNo, it&#39;s just that the document returned via GET doesn&#39;t have to be\n100% unambiguous about what the URI identifies (and I suggest that it\ncouldn&#39;t be if it wanted to, but that&#39;s another topic for another day\n8-).\n\nFor example, a URI that returned a picture of a clock in my house could\nbe used to identify the following resources;\n\n- the current time\n- that particular clock\n- the largest clock in my house\n- a JPG image of a clock\n- an object located 6.5&#39; above the floor in my kitchen\n\nFrom an observer&#39;s POV, the URI could identify any of those if I&#39;m\nonly ever returning an image from my webcam pointed at that clock.\n\n&gt;  What is the precise meaning of &#39;author&#39; here?\n&gt; Author of a &#39;document&#39; that uses a particular URI or the author that\n&gt; somhow &#39;brings into being&#39; a particular resource?\n\nAny use of the URI can contribute to its meaning.  Using the clock\nexample, if a bunch of people used that URI to identify &quot;the current\ntime&quot;, and then my clock breaks and I decide not to fix it (I&#39;m using\nit to identify &quot;that particular clock&quot;), then there is, in effect, an\nexpectation on me to change what it identifies to what most people\nthink it identifies.  It&#39;s up to me whether or not I want to do that,\nof course.\n\nA great example is the SOAP 1.1 URI at W3C; http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/ .\nThe URI should be able to be used as the identifier for &quot;the latest\nW3C version of SOAP&quot;, but so many people were using it to explicitly\nrefer to SOAP 1.1, rather than &quot;SOAP in general&quot;, that the W3C made an\nexplicit decision not to redirect that URI to SOAP 1.2 once it went Rec.\nFWIW, they did redirect for HTML; http://www.w3.org/TR/html\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
