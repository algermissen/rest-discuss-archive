I have a\ndifference of opinion on testing for example (me: any standard without\ntests doesn&#39;t exist), but the TAG happily waved through WS-Addressing\nwithout a single test case. I normally give my local representative a\nhard time about such things, when I get to corner him at the coffee\nmachine.
