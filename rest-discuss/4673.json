Some of those of name value pairs have discrete \nvalues, and some have continuous values. There are two types of \nparameters that accept discrete values:\n\n1. Parameters that accepts single discrete values only. e.g.\n\n     - image format\n     - exception format\n     - transparency\n\n2. Parameters that accept a list of discrete values. e.g\n\n     - Map layer names (layers=major-road,minor-road,river&)\n\nExamples of parameters with continuous values are:\n\n    - Geographic extent (minX, minY, maxX and maxY)\n    - Temporal ranges (from date/time, to date/time).\n\nTherefore, the use of continuous values seems to dictate the use of \nquery parameters. Describing map resources is not like describing a \npurchase order that has a single unique identifier. Does that make sense?\n\n &gt; Josh&#39;s suggestion of using hypermedia has actually been\n &gt; implemented by WMS clients.\n\nI understand what Josh is saying, but I disagree with him on this one \nbecause WMS was not designed to provide a user interface. It was \ndesigned to provide interoperability between software applications that \nneed to display maps. (Separation of concerns.) A WMS client from vendor \nA should be able to simultaneously display map images from WMS servers \nprovided by vendors B, C and E.\n\n &gt; In addition, if  my memory serves me right, OGC&#39;s Web Mapping\n &gt; Service also allow an XML encoding of request parameters, and\n &gt; the WMS client composes an xml file and send it to the WMS\n &gt; server using POST, which is definately not REST  IMHO. In the\n &gt; xml encoding case, can one make it restful?\n\nGET would seem to make more sense to me, but I&#39;ll defer to those on this \nlist who are more knowledgeable.\n\nRegards\nAndrew Hallam\n\nDigital Earth Pty Ltd\nhttp://www.digitalearth.com.au\n\n"}}
