This is largely due to the\n&gt; fact that REST is specific to HTTP (i.e. HTTP has an action header\n&gt; that can be used for the same purpose, or an associated URI) whereas\n&gt; Web services are multi-protocol and therefore need all information to\n&gt; be contained within the envelope. Some of the fundamental differences\n&gt; result from these different assumptions: REST assumes HTTP while WS-*\n&gt; assumes protocol neutrality. Others result from the fact that HTTP\n&gt; intentionally designs out features of existing IT systems (e.g.\n&gt; session based security, transaction coordination, reliability, etc.)\n&gt; and that the WS-* specifications basically amount to an attempt to put\n&gt; them back in.&quot;\n\nIf anyone here had said the above was something that WS-* proponents \nmight think, I&#39;d have accused them of adopting low tactics in creating \nsuch an OTT strawman to argue against.\n\n\n"}}
