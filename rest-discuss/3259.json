It means that all URI are just\nidentifiers, and can be used as names or locators in different\ncontexts.\n\nThere are two important reasons why I believe this is the case.\n\n1.  A URI that cannot be dereferenced is pretty much useless.\nThat doesn&#39;t mean &quot;answers GET&quot;, it means that if you can&#39;t interact\nwith what it identifies, then you don&#39;t know, authoritatively, what it\nidentifies.\n\n2.  Any dereferencable URI will include a string for which an\nalgorithm exists which will map the string to an IP/port tuple.  That\ndoesn&#39;t mean that the string has anything to do with location.  For\nexample, the URI http://www.markbaker.ca/ is commonly called a URL\nbecause of the mapping between &quot;http&quot;, &quot;www.markbaker.ca&quot;, and port 80\non 207.236.3.141.  Yet, if that mapping had been tweaked such that the\nURI was foo:markbaker-ca, would people still call that a URL because it\ndoesn&#39;t look like a DNS name, even though the algorithm uses DNS after\nsome inconsequential syntactical morph?  How is that different than\nurn:ietf:...?  I suggest that it isn&#39;t.\n\n&gt;  Wouldn&#39;t it be very confusing if URL gets the meaning of &quot;a web resource,\n&gt; or possibly a name, who knows?&quot;. I like the separation of URL for addresses\n&gt; and URN for names.\n\nI just like identifiers.\n\n&gt; The use of meaningless URLs in XML namespaces has shown\n&gt; to be confusing.\n\nTrue, but I haven&#39;t yet seen that it&#39;s caused any interoperability\nproblems.\n\n&gt; From your point of view, is URN a bad/useless technology?\n\nPretty much.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
