As resource orientation don&#39;t have any\n&gt; clear path for resources changing _over time_, it becomes a question\n&gt; for you whether you regard your resource as backwards compatible to\n&gt; some other version of itself. At some point there&#39;s perhaps a need for\n&gt; a totally new version, so why not have that as part of the URI when it\n&gt; *is* a different resource?\n\nYes, it&#39;s generally accepted. In a REST based approach you cut a new URL \nfor a new Resource, and you negotiate on well known content types.\n\nFor RPC or RPC hybrids you can end with version numbers in the URL \nbecause the function names and query params aren&#39;t sufficiently \nabstracted from the code - when the code or its signature changes the \n&#39;meaning&#39; of the URL also changes. Last.fm I think is an example of this \n(they have a v2 in their URL space); sf.com is a worst case scenario \nwith about 18 versions (long bet: this will stop as they adopt gdata).\n\nFor custom content types you end up versioning those as well, unless you \nhave good policies around backwards compatibility - operationally that \nmeans adopting must-ignore and foreign extensions from day 1.\n\nBill\n\n\n"}}
