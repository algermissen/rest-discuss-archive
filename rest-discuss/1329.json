The front page of that\n&gt;wiki --- indeed, part of the motivation for wiki, the list, etc. --- was to\n&gt;attempt to communicate the understanding several of us garnered from long\n&gt;and sometimes heated discussions with Roy.  So it&#39;s not surprising that\n&gt;different language is used to describe the same concepts in different\n&gt;contexts:  small connector set -&gt; generic interfaces -&gt; coordination\n&gt;languages, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t think this is what Paul is talking about when he says that the term\n&gt;has evolved, but then I&#39;m not really sure what he&#39;s talking about in that\n&gt;context.  IMHO, REST has a very specific, literal interpretation grounded in\n&gt;Roy&#39;s work.  (To the extent that I might&#39;ve inadvertently &quot;diluted&quot; that\n&gt;meaning with some of the things I&#39;ve hucked out there discussing this stuff,\n&gt;my deep apologies.)\n\nHaving re-read your &quot;REST, RPC, mountains, molehills, and a retraction (sort of)&quot; at http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/002801.html I can see where you are coming from and am now somewhat less confused - although, some might argue differently:-). It appears that for me at least, the wiki fails to communicate the &#39;steps to REST enlightenment&#39; :-) that you describe in that email. \n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n"}}
