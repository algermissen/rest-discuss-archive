It seems that any XML identifier is problematic to algorithmically map to a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; My scenario: I have an Artist List structure containing Artist structures with a Name and an uri reference, ie &lt;ArtistList&gt;&lt;Artist&gt;&lt;Name&gt;Thievery Corp&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;URI&gt;http://www.eslmusic.com/artists/thievery.html&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Artist&gt;&lt;/ArtistList&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to support getting the entire Artist information, or just a single field.  We earlier said that making the Artist identifier hierarchical is a Good Thing.  This would look like:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /ArtistList/Artist/id/xyz.\n\nI think that&#39;s the issue; I don&#39;t believe that it need look like that.\nThat, for a particular document, an Artist is encapsulated within an\nArtistList, doesn&#39;t dictate, I believe, that an Artist is hierarchically\nrelated to an ArtistList.  Hierarchy captures relationships between\nresources such as UML&#39;s aggregation by-value; that if the aggregator\ndies, the aggregatee(?) dies too.  That doesn&#39;t hold for ArtistList; if\nI remove an instance of a list containing an artist, the artist doesn&#39;t\ngo away.\n\nSo that URI above could be /Artist/id/xyz.  If you want to &quot;query&quot; by\nname, try /Artist/name/Foo%20Bar, and then as Roy was suggesting,\nredirect back to /Artist/id/xyz ... assuming there&#39;s only one known\n&quot;Foo Bar&quot; band.  If not, return your ArtistList, and perhaps in that\nlist put the /Artist/id/??? URI for each artist.\n\nDoes that make sense?  It&#39;s a hard subject to explain.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
