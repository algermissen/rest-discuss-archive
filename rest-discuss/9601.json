IIRC, the very first browsers they had PUT and DELETE but used \nto &quot;save&quot; edits to HTML files. Hence while PUT and DELETE were defined \nas actions on URLs that affected the resource found there (a definition \nthat became firmer and clearer later on) the actual use for them was not \nsomething that worked with forms.\n\nSo while there&#39;s no reason why a form shouldn&#39;t be able to PUT or even \nDELETE, it wasn&#39;t how things were done. The move away from browsers \nhaving an editing function meant that PUT and DELETE were largely \nforgotten in terms of what browsers do.\n\n\n"}}
