That last part of Roy being the one=\r\n was indeed humorous. I said May Be, which allows a set of good guys in thi=\r\ns community to enter the group, but since I&#39;m not there I cannot tell you w=\r\nho they are.\n\n2. Irony is &quot;incongruity between what might be expected and w=\r\nhat actually occurs&quot;. In this case, the post is not ironical, because it te=\r\nlls you what is actually occurring without comparing against the expected. =\r\nIt is just a set of categories you can validate on internet.\n\nCheers!\n\nWill=\r\niam.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; I though your initial post was something like a &quot;humorous&quot; post, th=\r\nat \n&gt; the intention of it was to put a smile in everybody faces. Because \n&gt;=\r\n otherwise it tends to be seen a little diminishing for everybody that \n&gt; f=\r\nalls in your categories.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They like buzz words, so they follow REST ju=\r\nst because it is cool and \n&gt; all people talk about it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;someone told =\r\nthem REST is a way to do services without SOAP. So they \n&gt; follow...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things with URIs=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;so they follow REST doing whatever they want.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They believe R=\r\nEST is HTTP. Deep enough.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They think REST is a web api for CRUD. Sim=\r\nple.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I appreciate a good irony when it is said... ironically. But=\r\n now you \n&gt; say that this is not a &quot;humorous&quot; post but it should be taken l=\r\niterally, \n&gt; because &quot;the intention is to identify how is the REST term use=\r\nd and \n&gt; understood.&quot; And we have to identify ourselves in one of the group=\r\ns you \n&gt; mention, most of them &quot;because it&#39;s cool&quot;, because &quot;someone told t=\r\nhen&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;so they follow&quot;, practically all of them described in terms th=\r\nat \n&gt; are either humorous or (xor) diminishing...\n&gt; \n&gt; I myself think I can=\r\n fall in more than one group, but I prefer to think \n&gt; that is because I&#39;m =\r\nin a early stage of working with REST and I have \n&gt; lot&#39;s of things yet to =\r\ngrasp and little time to do it, and not just \n&gt; because I found REST cool a=\r\nnd all people talk about it., or because \n&gt; someone told me something and I=\r\n just follow, or because I&#39;m shallow \n&gt; enough to believe REST is HTTP, or =\r\nnaive enough to think is simple \n&gt; CRUD... That would be to dismiss a perso=\r\nn as of little intelligence, not \n&gt; to say other harsh words...\n&gt; \n&gt; Finall=\r\ny, do you really believe there is only a person that knows REST as \n&gt; it ac=\r\ntually is and understands it, being that person Roy, or is that \n&gt; part iro=\r\nny/humorous? Because I don&#39;t belong to that particular group for \n&gt; sure, b=\r\nut to some people on this list that wrote lot&#39;s of good articles \n&gt; in blog=\r\ns from which I learned a lot that is, at least, unfair...\n&gt; \n&gt; Not that I t=\r\nhink your intention was that, of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez Pomares wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello Bill.\n&gt; &gt; Not sure of your intention with the commen=\r\nt. Sounds like \n&gt; &gt; disapprovement, due to the negative conception of the &quot;=\r\nstereotype&quot; \n&gt; &gt; word. Not even sure of your idea of my idea by writing the=\r\n list.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me state it again:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I love doing so sometimes (Namin=\r\ng things) to know what am I referring to&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I guess it helps understand =\r\nwhere are we standing in terms of REST \n&gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I had been in hundreds of discussions. Most of the time, two people \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n discuss about different things that are named the same. So, my first \n&gt; &gt; =\r\naction is to clarify what I mean by that name. Just as I did now with \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmy idea in the lines above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok, let&#39;s start again: I&#39;ve created a c=\r\nlassification of the common \n&gt; &gt; understandings people that I&#39;ve read and d=\r\niscussed with, had shown \n&gt; &gt; related to REST. The intention is to identify=\r\n how is the REST term \n&gt; &gt; used and understood. It makes no sense to put a =\r\nface on each class, \n&gt; &gt; when we want common behavior for analysis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sorry if taken as a bad thing. Not my intention.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; William.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&gt;, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Assign a person to each of y=\r\nour stereotypes, let them and everyone else\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Still a=\r\n good idea?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; willmarpo wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reading through all this good material about REST, I =\r\nfind some old \n&gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussions around. Someone suggested namin=\r\ng things is not so \n&gt; &gt; good, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love doing so somethings to kno=\r\nw what am I referring to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, having all of you as REST fan=\r\ns, I wanted to present a \n&gt; &gt; classification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did two days ago whi=\r\nle riding the bus to work. Silly? It may be, \n&gt; &gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess it he=\r\nlps understand where are we standing in terms of REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usability and=\r\n knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *API Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have=\r\n a system, usually not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API=\r\n created. They usually \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST is an API making technique o=\r\nr recipe, for the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Subcategories:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. =\r\nThis are the ones that think REST is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creating URIs, and n=\r\nothing more. So their discussions are solely \n&gt; &gt; focused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on URIs, =\r\nand their presentations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *RPCers*. Bad=\r\n group that think REST is a way to map RPC in disguise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using URIs i=\r\nn a web API. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak \n&gt; &gt; RPC at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; - *Exposers*: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; think you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST \n&gt; &gt; is =\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; API for exposing things on the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*: Another=\r\n repeated group. They think REST is a web api for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Mappers*: This other category may use the API idea, but they =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work to b=\r\ne done is to map\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all that is know used to that new type. Interestin=\r\ng?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*. Again, the idea is that CRUD can be mapped naturall=\r\ny to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - =\r\n*HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*. Ag=\r\nain too. They usually try to map all classes, data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities, elemen=\r\nts into resources, and then call their systems \n&gt; &gt; RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t he reminders of the types.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Standard Haters*: Here yo=\r\nu have all those that think Standards are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an =\r\nanarchy where you have the freedom to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they=\r\n follow REST doing whatever they want.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *KISS lovers*. This are th=\r\ne ones that like thinks to be simple. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone told them REST is=\r\n easy, so they follow doing easy things with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots o=\r\nf URI jugglers in this group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Servicers*. They think Services is=\r\n good, and someone told them \n&gt; &gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to do services with=\r\nout SOAP. So they follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority.=\r\n They like buzz words, so \n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is =\r\ncool and all people talk about it. \n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are some Buzz creator=\r\ns too, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA. \n&gt; &gt; No pun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended o=\r\nn REST-*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably=\r\n the group that \n&gt; &gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST as it actually is and understan ds =\r\nit. That may be a one person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group (yes Roy).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m m=\r\nay not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say=\r\ning they are good, at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Do you find y=\r\nourself in any of those groups?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
