So there&#39;s just one form URI, but  \n&gt; depending on the session state, I may return it blank or fill it with  \n&gt; data and error messages. So if I&#39;ve made three attempts at getting  \n&gt; the form right, then I back up, each time the form will look the same  \n&gt; because I&#39;m grabbing the conversational state of that form from the  \n&gt; user session. With snapshots, even if I back up and hit reload, I&#39;ll  \n&gt; still see the history of my conversation. So if two pages ago I had  \n&gt; tried a flight on Wednesday instead of Thursday, I can back up and  \n&gt; get back to the form with Wednesday, change the time from morning to  \n&gt; afternoon, and press submit again. Voila.\n\nIn an earlier message I said that you hadn&#39;t pleaded a case for *why* \nyou put &#39;session state&#39; in a URL. However, your case seems to be to what \nyou call &#39;not break the back button&#39;.\n\nHere&#39;s the thing. The interaction you describe here is entirely done in \nthe &#39;object&#39; of the request. That is, this entire exchange about \n&#39;querying&#39; for Wednesday, Thursday, etc., is, rightly, done purely in \nthe URL.\n\nIf you&#39;re doing everything with &#39;GET&#39; then there is no state mutation on \nthe server. There is no &#39;conversational state&#39;. There is simply GET, \nGET, GET, GET. You don&#39;t need to post to the server or store any state \non the server for this. In which case, I agree, model the whole \ninteraction as a set of GET requests where the &#39;object&#39; of the request \nexplicitly says &#39;What day of week&#39;, &#39;What class&#39;, &#39;What airline&#39;, etc., \nand where the resultant representations show availability, price, \nanchors for the booking service, etc.\n\nThe big thing to take away here is that there was no &#39;state&#39; mutations. \nYou just navigate through a set of links. You have your forms create GET \n(rather than POST) requests. You offer links to more information. The \nback button continues to work fine. You don&#39;t &#39;create conversational \nstate&#39; on the server and then key it by the URL. You just issue a \nsequence of queries.\n\nIf you POST to the server though you can&#39;t expect to &#39;back out&#39;. I \nsubmit that in any case where you need to &#39;not break the back button&#39; \nthat you can do so by abstaining from POSTing state mutations. I.e model \nthe interactions with GET requests. (That&#39;s what I do.)\n\nI also redirect after a POST as you do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
