What if a cache intercepts the method?\n\nGET doesn&#39;t have side-effects in that case.  The resource doesn&#39;t change\nstate, plus any other stateful action are undone when the GET finishes.\n\n&gt; What if a server just doesn&#39;t understand the header at all? It won&#39;t\n&gt; announce that.\n\nThe &quot;Subscriber&quot; header?  Nope, it won&#39;t announce it, but that&#39;s part of\nthe Subscription/Subscriber contract.  Why would somebody POST a message\nwith a Subscriber body to a URI that didn&#39;t advertise its ability to\naccept it (and have it mean &quot;subscribe&quot;)?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
