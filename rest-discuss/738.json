The entity format is specified by\n   the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin\n   server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code.\n   If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD\n   respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.\n\nIt&#39;s not clear to me what this stuff means:\n   The response\n   SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource\n   characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can\n   choose the one most appropriate.
