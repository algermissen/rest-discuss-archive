Can someone explain what he is saying here?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Likewise, the use of cookies to identify a user-specific &#39;shopping\n&gt; basket&#39; within a server-side database could be more efficiently\n&gt; implemented by defining the semantics of shopping items within the\n&gt; hypermedia data formats, allowing the user agent to select and store\n&gt; those items within their own client-side shopping basket, complete with\n&gt; a URI to be used for check-out when the client is ready to purchase.&quot;\n\nYou know that cookies are stateful, right?  That is, they make it so\nthat there isn&#39;t enough information in the HTTP message to understand\nwhat it does, because it depends on the information represented by\nthe cookie which is invisible to everybody but the server.\n\nSo if you wanted to do a shopping basket statelessly, it&#39;s up to the\nclient to manage that the state of the basket, submitting a\nrepresentation of the basket to the server when it wants to checkout.\nThe local URI would be needed to identify which shopping basket, so that\nwhen you opted to put something in the basket, you would do a local POST\nof the representation of the item to your basket.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
