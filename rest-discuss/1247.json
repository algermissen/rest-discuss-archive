We are in \nclose collaboration with the external parties who will be using this \nfunctionality. Others are proposing that we use SOAP. I feel the REST \napproach will offer more flexibility in the future, allowing the data \nto be accessed, linked and manipulated in ways not yet though of, \nwhereas SOAP would constrain the use of data to the API exposed.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Are there any open-source tools that can help with implementing a \nJava RESTful interface? Does anyone have any Java implementation \nexperience to share?\n\n2) The SOAP proponents at work are proposing the use of Apache Axis \nas a SOAP server implementation. Does anyone have experience with \nAxis?\n\n3) The SOAP proponents think the extensible SOAP header adds \nflexibility, a place to put transaction metadata or security related \ninformation. Does REST have an answer to these requirements?\n\n4) We need a way for an external application to store or modify a \ntrade in our application. I would be interested in any feedback on \nthe following resource modeling ideas:\n\n4a) To store a new trade, either a two step communication:\n -&gt; HTTP GET request\n      to //host/trades/newtradeuri\n      or //host/trades?newtradeuri\n\n &lt;- HTTP response would contain server-generated URI:\n         //host/trades/123\n      or //host/trades?id=123\n\n -&gt; HTTP PUT request containing trade XML\n      to //host/trades/123\n\n &lt;- HTTP response indicating success\n\n\nOr perhaps do it in one step:\n -&gt; HTTP POST request containing trade XML\n      to //host/trades/newtrade\n      or //host/trades\n\n &lt;- HTTP response would contain server-generated URI:\n         //host/trades/123\n\n\n4b) To modify an existing trade:\n -&gt; HTTP PUT request containing trade XML\n      to //host/trades/122\n\n &lt;- HTTP response indicating success\n\n\n4c) To read an existing trade:\n -&gt; HTTP GET request\n      to //host/trades/122\n\n &lt;- HTTP response containing trade XML\n\n\n4d) Within a trade XML instance some information would be represented \nas a link to the resource containing the complete information. For \nexample:\n\n  &lt;trade&gt;\n    &lt;counterparty href=&quot;https//host/counterparties/12&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;broker href=&quot;https//host/brokers/34&quot;/&gt;\n    ...\n  &lt;/trade&gt;\n\n\n5) Given the requirements outlined in (4), which would you recommend: \nthe REST approach above, or the use of SOAP with an API containing \nmethods such as, storeTrade(tradeXml), modifyTrade(tradeXml), getTrade\n().\n\n\nLook forward to any feedback.\n\nRegards,\nRobert McKinnon\n\n\n\n"}}
