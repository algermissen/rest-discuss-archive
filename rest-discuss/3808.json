[...]\n&gt;\n&gt; It sounds like by &quot;model&quot; you&#39;re referring to a primary\n&gt; representation for the resource, like the Wiki-text\n&gt; representation as opposed to the HTML rendering of a Wiki topic.\n&gt; This jibes with the discomfort I expressed about treating the\n&gt; HTML rendering as another representation of the same resource.\n\nExactly.  Yes.\n\n&gt; A couple of points come to mind:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Content negotiation is confusing, and multiple representations\n&gt;    just aren&#39;t used very often.\n\nYes.  The only use of alternative content is in some form of \ntransfer-encoding.  Both endpoints need to be talking about the same model. \n\n\n&gt; 2. For PUT to be meaningful, the browser must GET the primary\n&gt;    representation anyway, for the user to edit.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re still talking about transferring representations of\n&gt; resources, but expressing a preference for a single\n&gt; representation for each resource, with stylesheets or scripts for\n&gt; rendering.\n\nYes, you could say that.  The issue is that ReST does not sufficiently \nconstrain the meaning of representation.  The ReST definition of \nrepresentation is that what is transferred is a representation of a human \nconcept or thing.  I am saying there is an intermediate step where we build \na shared model of that concept or thing and manipulate the models in \nvarious ways.  The relationship between the model and any referent is \nentirely in the heads of humans.  The software deals only with models.\n\n&gt; The HTML4 spec describes an HTTP header called Link that can\n&gt; specify one or more stylesheets appropriate for rendering a\n&gt; resource for different media. I like this idea because it keeps\n&gt; the rendering hints entirely outside of the representation of the\n&gt; resource itself, which is what we&#39;ve been talking about.\n&gt;\n\nExactly.  The XML/HTML world is moving in the MoST direction.  HTTP in \ngeneral still seems to be stuck with ReST.  HTTP needs either a \nContent-View header (a generalization of the Link header) or it needs a \nModel-Location header.\n\nI think we are very much on the same page here.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
