It is\n&gt;&gt;        therefore not dependent upon the representation. eg. if I am\n&gt;&gt;        being shown an itinerary for my approval prior to a final\n&gt;&gt;        booking, I am in the state of reviewing the itinerary -\n&gt;&gt;        irrespective of whether the itinerary was being rendered as\n&gt;&gt;        XHTML, JSON, XML, PDF or PNG.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    I&#39;m not sure if I understand the distinction you make between\n&gt;&gt;    application and resource state\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; XHTML / JSON formats are an attribute of the resource representation -\n&gt;&gt; they cannot be an attribute of the application state, since from an\n&gt;&gt; application perspective, the user is exactly at the same place in the\n&gt;&gt; overall workflow irrespective of the resource representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This seems to imply tight coupling between resource and application state.\n&gt; I can&#39;t agree that these are the same states from an application perspective\n&gt; because they are clearly distinguished by control data in the HTTP message\n&gt; (Accept/Content-Type in this specific case).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;               b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a\n&gt;&gt;               question for the author of a browser to answer. If we had a\n&gt;&gt;               browser which say allowed you to also describe the accept\n&gt;&gt;               headers before making the URI, then let us for a moment\n&gt;&gt;               suggest that such a browser the bookmark perhaps could\n&gt;&gt;        contain\n&gt;&gt;               the accept header. However we don&#39;t have such browsers (I\n&gt;&gt;               haven&#39;t seen one at least). But it is likely that\n&gt;&gt;        programmatic\n&gt;&gt;               clients may want to choose to store such URIs for say\n&gt;&gt;        resuming\n&gt;&gt;               later. Such a browser is again unlikely to &#39;break&#39; if it is\n&gt;&gt;               able to accept and parse various content types with equal\n&gt;&gt;               capability or works with only one content type which it\n&gt;&gt;        always\n&gt;&gt;               specifically requests. However it could break if in a\n&gt;&gt;               particular situation it has requested a particular resource\n&gt;&gt;               with a non default accept headers and that is specifically\n&gt;&gt;               needed to resume further. In such a situation, perhaps the\n&gt;&gt;               bookmark could store the accept header.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           That is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        Yes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was on\n&gt;&gt;        the other hand attempting to separate the notion of the\n&gt;&gt;        bookmark and the application state - ie. they are not one and\n&gt;&gt;        the same.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    If a bookmark is not a stored reference to a given application\n&gt;&gt;    state, what is it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In this context it is a stored reference to an application state + a\n&gt;&gt; preferred format.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The array of representations for a given resource are not application\n&gt; states in their own right?\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you model negotiating these formats in a state machine, without\n&gt; treating them as separate states?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;               But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;&gt;               attribute of the application state - they are an\n&gt;&gt;        application\n&gt;&gt;               of the conversation state (though I am open to be\n&gt;&gt;        challenged\n&gt;&gt;               since I myself am not so terribly convinced about it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           I don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application\n&gt;&gt;        of the\n&gt;&gt;           conversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between\n&gt;&gt;           application and resource, given communication in RESTful\n&gt;&gt;        systems\n&gt;&gt;           is (supposed to be) stateless.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        Sorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept\n&gt;&gt;        headers imo are not an attribute of the application state -\n&gt;&gt;        they are an _*attribute*_ of the conversation state&quot;. Though\n&gt;&gt;        reading it again I feel a little lame. I should&#39;ve been more\n&gt;&gt;        specific and should&#39;ve said &quot;the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;&gt;        attribute of the application state - they are merely the\n&gt;&gt;        influencers of a representation as a part of a given conversation&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    If they are influencing the representation transfered, they are\n&gt;&gt;    impacting on the application state. I can agree that there is no\n&gt;&gt;    difference between the resource state, but that is desired\n&gt;&gt;    behavior from negotiated representations of the same resource.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would just suggest the following hypothetical scenario. If I received a\n&gt;&gt; XHTML version of my itinerary and it had a link to obtain a PDF version, and\n&gt;&gt; then I click it - would it mean that the I would do a state transition from\n&gt;&gt; one state to another or would it be from a state to itself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My understanding is that you are describing an application state\n&gt; transition, so I would say the former - as mentioned above this is clearly\n&gt; distinguished by the control data within each of the HTTP messages.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI think it boils down to the fact whether one interprets a control-header\nand a representation format to influence an application state. I would only\nreiterate that since (and so long as) the representation does not influence\nwhere the user is in the overall workflow of the activity he is trying to\nachieve, the control headers or representation formats should not lead him\nto different application states (ie. so long as the URI is the same - its\nalways the same application state).\n\nSome of the thoughts which might support this idea are :\n\na) If different control headers mean different application states, then\nwould it mean different users viewing the same page using different\nauthentication headers are in a different application state ? Not so imo.\nSimilarly if the response returns with different cache-control directives\nfor the same page (eg. expiry time) does that imply different application\nstates ?\n\nb) If one assumes a new (hypothetical) browser which does not understand\nHTML but works only with say PDF or Flash representations. Would now one\nassume that two users viewing the same page/URI  from two different browsers\nare looking at two different application states - again that does not sound\nappropriate to me.\n\nHaving said that, I tried to search for an authoritative definition of what\nan Application State is including Fielding&#39;s thesis - however I could not\nfind one.\n\nDoes anyone in the group have any opinion on the matter (just to broadbase\nthe conversation a little bit since I suspect myself and Mike have pushed it\nas far as we could perhaps carry it - that only being an assumption from my\nside) ?\n\nDhananjay\n\r\n--000e0cd6ace00888c6046fae511b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nMy comments at the very end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul =\r\n27, 2009 at 3:56 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mik=\r\ne@...&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); mar=\r\ngin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\nDhananjay Nene wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blo=\r\nckquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204,=\r\n 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMike,&lt;div =\r\nclass=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 3:15 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt; =\r\n&lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@myk=\r\nanjo.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0Dhananjay Nene wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0On Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 2:29 PM, Mike Kelly&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@....=\r\nuk&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Hi Dhananjay,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Why wou=\r\nld application state always be the same for all&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 re=\r\npresentations of a resource?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0An application s=\r\ntate reflects where the user is in the overall&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0workflow=\r\n supported / managed by the application.

In such a situation, perhaps the&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 bookmark could store the accept header.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 That is, essentially, what I was suggesting&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0Yes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was=\r\n on&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0the other hand attempting to separate the notion of=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0bookmark and the application state - ie. they are =\r\nnot one and&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0If a bookma=\r\nrk is not a stored reference to a given application&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0state, what=\r\n is it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn this context it is a stored reference to an application=\r\n state + a preferred format.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nThe array o=\r\nf representations for a given resource are not application states in their =\r\nown right?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHow would you model negotiating these formats in a stat=\r\ne machine, without treating them as separate states?&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(=\r\n204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 But even in this case the accept head=\r\ners imo are not an&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 attribute of the applic=\r\nation state - they are an&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0application&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 of the conversation state (though I am open to be&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0challenged&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 since I myself am no=\r\nt so terribly convinced about it).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 I don=\r\n&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0of the&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 conversation state&#39; - but there =\r\nis no room for a state between&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 application and res=\r\nource, given communication in RESTful&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0systems&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 is (supposed to be) stateless.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0Sorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0headers imo are not an attribute of the application state =\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0they are an _*attribute*_ of the conversation state&q=\r\nuot;. Though&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0reading it again I feel a little lame. I s=\r\nhould&#39;ve been more&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0specific and should&#39;ve said =\r\n&quot;the accept headers imo are not an&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0attribute of th=\r\ne application state - they are merely the&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0influencers o=\r\nf a representation as a part of a given conversation&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n=A0 =A0If they are influencing the representation transfered, they are&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n =A0 =A0impacting on the application state. I can agree that there is no&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n =A0 =A0difference between the resource state, but that is desired&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n=A0 =A0behavior from negotiated representations of the same resource.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI would just suggest the following hypothetical scenario. If I rec=\r\neived a XHTML version of my itinerary and it had a link to obtain a PDF ver=\r\nsion, and then I click it - would it mean that the I would do a state trans=\r\nition from one state to another or would it be from a state to itself.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nMy understanding is that you are describing an ap=\r\nplication state transition, so I would say the former - as mentioned above =\r\nthis is clearly distinguished by the control data within each of the HTTP m=\r\nessages.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCheers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#888888&quot;&gt;\nMike&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it boils down to the fact whether one i=\r\nnterprets a control-header and a representation format to influence an appl=\r\nication state. I would only reiterate that since (and so long as) the repre=\r\nsentation does not influence where the user is in the overall workflow of t=\r\nhe activity he is trying to achieve, the control headers or representation =\r\nformats should not lead him to different application states (ie. so long as=\r\n the URI is the same - its always the same application state). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Som=\r\ne of the thoughts which might support this idea are :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) If differen=\r\nt control headers mean different application states, then would it mean dif=\r\nferent users viewing the same page using different authentication headers a=\r\nre in a different application state ? Not so imo. Similarly if the response=\r\n returns with different cache-control directives for the same page (eg. exp=\r\niry time) does that imply different application states ?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;b) If one =\r\nassumes a new (hypothetical) browser which does not understand HTML but wor=\r\nks only with say PDF or Flash representations. Would now one assume that tw=\r\no users viewing the same page/URI=A0 from two different browsers are lookin=\r\ng at two different application states - again that does not sound appropria=\r\nte to me. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Having said that, I tried to search for an authoritative=\r\n definition of what an Application State is including Fielding&#39;s thesis=\r\n - however I could not find one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone in the group have any =\r\nopinion on the matter (just to broadbase the conversation a little bit sinc=\r\ne I suspect myself and Mike have pushed it as far as we could perhaps carry=\r\n it - that only being an assumption from my side) ?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Dhananjay&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd6ace00888c6046fae511b--\r\n\n"}}
