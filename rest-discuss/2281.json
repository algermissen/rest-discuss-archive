Business conversations consist of a buildup of \nconditions, commitments, fulfillments of commitments, claims for \npayment, claims that commitments were not fulfilled correctly, etc. \netc. Almost every statement beyond &quot;Hello&quot; is dependent on some \nprevious statements, and even &quot;Hello&quot; assumes authentication.\n\nThere are very few, almost no independent statements.\n\nTwo possible ways to deal:\n1. Embed a representation of every possible dependency in a canonical \nrepresentation of every dependent statement.\n2. Follow hyperlinks to chains of dependencies.\n\nEach of those ways could be appropriate for some situation or other.\n\nI&#39;m still trying to work out all the implications.  If there are \nother ways to deal, I&#39;m all ears.\n\nBut it will not work to avoid the dependencies.  In business, \neverything is dependencies.  In software development, it&#39;s much the \nsame.  To me, hyperlinks *are* dependencies.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\nP.S. I believe canonical representations of evidence of electronic \nbusiness deals will be &quot;standardized&quot; probably by more than \none &quot;standards&quot; org.  That&#39;s where I think URIs for all evidence will \nbe a clear advantage for REST vs burying the evidence in proprietary \nsystems.\n\n\n"}}
