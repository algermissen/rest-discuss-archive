I would like to hear your experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; In particilar, the system I am writing will have output in XML and\n&gt; JSON (input format is still TBD), so standard browser testers are not\n&gt; as useful. Also there will be validation for some of the XML outputs.\n\nDon&#39;t know what kind of environment you are in, but I&#39;ve had some good  \nsuccess with Test::HTTP::Syntax[1] in perl. It requires a server be  \nrunning, but should be extensible to accept a mocked up HTTP request.\n\nI&#39;ve started looking at twill[2] in python, which is supposed to be  \nable to intercept wsgi interactions (thus not requiring a running  \nserver). It&#39;s very browser and form oriented rather than request,  \nresources and response, so it&#39;s not making me happy yet.\n\nThe benefit of both of these, especially Test::HTTP, is that you can  \nconstruct some requests, evaluate the responses and effectively  \nvalidate what you&#39;re getting back. Test::HTTP::Syntax gives you a  \nlittle DSL that has worked wonders in some situations.\n\nI think there&#39;s lots of room for improvement in these and similar tools.\n\n[1] http://search.cpan.org/~mml/Test-HTTP-0.10/\n[2] http://twill.idyll.org/\n\n-- \nChris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\n\n\n"}}
