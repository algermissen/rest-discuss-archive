The popular name \nfor these mechanisms seems to be &quot;correlation&quot;.  I think the name was \ncoined by MSFT, but now seems to be taken up by SUN.\n\nDoesn&#39;t this smell like a kludge?\n\nHere we have a proposal for adding something called &quot;Correlation&quot; to \nebXML Business Process Specs:\nhttp://lists.ebtwg.org/archives/ebtwg-bps/200206/msg00035.html\n\nExcerpt:\n&quot;The purpose of the project is to formalize the semantics that allows \ntwo BPSS users to unambiguously carry out multiple instances of the \nsame ... collaboration [script] with each other. Correlation is an \nacknowledged concept within message based collaborations, and BPSS \ndoes not currently have the capability to specify correlation. In the \nabsence of such capability the partners are left to either operate \nambiguously (and therefore inefficiently), or to devise their own way \nof agreeing on the correlation rules.&quot;\n\nMSFT XLang has something similar, I quote:\n&quot;11. Correlation and Port References\n\nWe have so far maintained the illusion that the target for the \ndelivery of messages between XLANG services is just the WSDL port of \nthe recipient service. The reason this is an illusion is that by \ntheir very nature, stateful services are instantiated in order to act \nin accordance with the history of an extended interaction. Therefore, \nmessages sent to such services need to be delivered not only to the \ncorrect destination port, but to the correct instance of the service \nthat defines the port. The infrastructure hosting the service needs \nto be able to do this in a fairly generic manner, so as to avoid \nburdening every service implementation with the need to implement a \ncustom mechanism for instance routing.\n\n&quot;Consider the usual supply chain situation where a buyer sends a \npurchase order to the seller. Let us suppose that the buyer and \nseller have a stable business relationship and are statically \nconfigured to send documents related to the purchasing interaction to \nthe URLs associated with the relevant WSDL ports. The seller needs to \nreturn an acknowledgement for the order, and the acknowledgement must \nbe routed to the correct service instance at the buyer. The obvious \nand standard mechanism to do this is to carry a token or &quot;cookie&quot; in \nthe order message that is copied into the acknowledgement for \ncorrelation.&quot;\n\nI mean, if the purchase order is a Web resource with a URI, can&#39;t you \njust address it directly?  And if you can directly address the \nresource you are trying to hit, would you ever need something \nlike &quot;correlation&quot;?  Am I missing something here?\n\n\n[Aside: if you can&#39;t do conversations RESTfully, or if there is some \nreason that you want to hide the actual resources being addressed, \nthen you need Correlation.  But of course I&#39;m assuming here that you \ncan and you don&#39;t.]\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
