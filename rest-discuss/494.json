It&#39;s what you were trying to do with RPOST\n&gt; &gt; earlier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not according to grep. http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2774.txt\n\nThat&#39;s because it defines the &quot;M-&quot; prefix that can be used with any\nHTTP method.\n\n&gt; But anyhow, I get your point. M-POST is some kind of reliable post with\n&gt; a message ID.\n\nNot exactly, but it doesn&#39;t matter here.\n\n&gt; &gt; PUT is *a* right method, but so is POST.  It depends on the app, and\n&gt; &gt; on what the subscriber wants.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you deliberately avoiding examples? \n\nYes, because they&#39;re a pain in the ass to describe.  Ok, so without going\ninto detail...\n\nConsider two stock quote services.  One pumps out absolute values, and\nthe other pumps out deltas.  The former could notify with PUT, and the\nlatter could notify with POST.\n\n&gt; Would you also say that some times DELETE is an appropriate\n&gt; notification? \n\nIf that&#39;s the way the subscriber wants to know about something, I\nsuppose so.  But there&#39;s no body, and a successful notification can only\nhappen once.  I can&#39;t think of a case where I&#39;d need to use it.\n\n&gt; Is the right method chosen at the application level or should the client\n&gt; TELL the server what it wants the server to do in a standardized way?\n\nNot sure what the former means, but the latter is what I had in mind\n(and what we&#39;ve implemented).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
