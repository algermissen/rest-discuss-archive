If it happens anyway, without such an\n&gt; &gt; expectation, then that&#39;s RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; The update, in this case, is stated explicitly in the request body and \n&gt; not implied by some mutual understanding between the client and\n&gt; server applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, how did I do?
