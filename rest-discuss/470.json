Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW - I still maintain that http-based subscriptions and notifications\n&gt; should be described in terms of any and all possible http methods upon a\n&gt; resource, regardless of status (success, error, etc.). A subscription should\n&gt; be able to specify all three : resource, method and status. A notification\n&gt; should identify all three. This is difficult to describe with the existing\n&gt; http because the method and status never appear outside the first line of\n&gt; request or response - there is no current situation where a header holds\n&gt; either of these values (as far as I know).\n\nI&#39;m starting to buy Lucas&#39; point that any information in the\nnotification other than &quot;something happened&quot; must be considered\n&quot;advisory&quot; and must be available somewhere on the server. Otherwise if\nyou miss a single message you get out of sync and I think we&#39;re all sick\nof systems like that. So to model a chat application, there would be a\nresource representing the transcript (perhaps segmented as it began to\nget big). If you ever missed a notification there should be an easy way\nto get back into sync. If you joined the chat mid-stream you could\nactually see what went on before you got there. There would never be any\ndoubt about whether someone got a particular message or not because they\nwould all be available as part of the resource (or as independent\nresources).\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
