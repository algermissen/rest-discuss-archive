It&#39;s not just about \nsessions. It&#39;s about boomarkability, linkability, e-mail-ability and \nmore. A cookie is not a substitute for a URL.\n\nIf http://www.example.com/shoppingcart shows me and you different \nresources when we load it into our respective browsers because we have \ndifferent cookies, then cookies are violating the web architecture.\n\nJust maybe it&#39;s OK to use cookies for authentication as long as they are \nin addition to a complete URL, rather than a replacement for it; but I&#39;m \nnot convinced of that yet. As authentication cookies are actually used \non the Web today, they&#39;re evil because they do attempt to allow a single \nURL to identify multiple resources.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
