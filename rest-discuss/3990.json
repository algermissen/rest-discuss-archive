IOW: the use provides addressing context.\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) &#39;we&#39;: Topic Map community, but I think also a substantial portion\n&gt;      of knowledge representation communities in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry again, to raise these issues on this list. While I believe that\n&gt; the\n&gt; use of names (e.g. URIs) in combination with context is the superior\n&gt; choice for knowledge representation, I also understand that a\n&gt; knowledge representation system can only be &quot;on the Web&quot; if it uses\n&gt; a unique addressing context.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am bringing this up here, because I am looking for the technical\n&gt; arguments/benefits for a knowledge representation system to be\n&gt; &quot;on the Web&quot; as much as possible and, well, I expect to get the\n&gt; most qualified answers on this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; One argument I know about is that unique addressing context enables\n&gt; intermediaries to &#39;add-in additional information&#39;  because they need\n&gt; not deal with any addressing ambiguity of the URIs they &#39;see&#39;. (Hope\n&gt; I recalled that correctly).\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there other arguments along these lines?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The distinction can also bee seen this way: In TM-land the author of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Topic Map\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decides in what a given URI identifies, in Web-land the controling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authority\n&gt; &gt; &gt; makes this decison.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My particular questions are:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Is the idea that an authority controls the &#39;meaning of URI&#39; a REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; principle or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &#39;just&#39; a Web principle?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d say the latter.  I don&#39;t recall REST talking at all about ownership,\n&gt; &gt; though it&#39;s possible some degree of that is implicit in the &quot;meaning\n&gt; &gt; via use&quot; aspect of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark, do you have any pointers regarding this &quot;meaning via use&quot;\n&gt; aspect of REST?\n&gt;\n&gt; And, uh, to me this sounds like the exact opposite to &quot;meaning\n&gt; via authoritative assignment&quot;...?!?!?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - What exactly are the technical advantages of using a unique\n&gt; &gt; &gt; addressing context\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   when building distributes systems based on REST? Has anybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; analized that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  in detail or can help me with some pointers?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been\n&gt; &gt; discussed for many many years.  Not that I&#39;m very familiar with the\n&gt; &gt; history, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or\n&gt; &gt; Nelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can&#39;t be more specific.  I&#39;m sure somebody\n&gt; &gt; here who&#39;s more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Mark Baker.
