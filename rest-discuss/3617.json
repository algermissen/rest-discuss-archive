I&#39;ve been following this REST vs. &quot;document style&quot; SOAP\ndebate (I assume RPC style is dead on both sides), and I&#39;m\nstarting to think one of the advantages of REST is that you\ncan actually create a hybrid web service that both human and\nmachine can handle.\n\nCorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe this is difficult with\nSOAP (even with document-style one) unless it gets fully\nRESTified and utilizes URI to locate every resource/service.\n\nFor example, while I was attending Amazon BOF held at O&#39;Reilly\nETech conf, I was playing with the idea of browser extension\nthat keep track of books I have shown interest (i.e. clicked or\nbrowsed). Okay, I&#39;m not sure how useful is that, but the point is\nthat embedded, machine-processible REST interface (probably\nusing XHTML+XML?) can be used not only for browsing, but to\nseamlessly enhance my ability to explore information. This is\ndifficult if &quot;for-human&quot; WS and &quot;for-machine&quot; WS are separate\nthings.\n\nCan anyone here verify me, or am I missing something?\n\n--\nTaisuke Yamada &lt;tai@...&gt;\nInternet Initiative Japan Inc., Technical Planning Division\n\n"}}
