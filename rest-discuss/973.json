And he won&#39;t make a single &quot;opaque data\n&gt; object&quot; addressable that would otherwise be non-addressable because it\n&gt; will take *effort* on the part of the information owner to generate\n&gt; these generative grammars and they could just as easily implement an\n&gt; index using queries today. So we&#39;ll put in a bunch of effort inventing a\n&gt; bunch of new technologies that buy no new power.\n\nAha!  Here&#39;s another one that&#39;s easy to knock down.  It&#39;s often a *lot* easier\nto write down a scheme for naming in a useful manner than it is to provide\neither a query capability *beyond* namespace organization *or* an explicit which\ncan be used to find things.  If namespace owners can describe the structures of\ntheir information spaces as easily as something like\n\n    http://smartspace.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;building&gt;/&lt;room&gt;/&lt;device&gt;\n\nthen more structure will be imposed, resulting in better organized and more\nuseful information on the Web.  To the extent that &quot;new technology&quot; needs to be\ninvented in order to use semantic naming, the power it &quot;buys&quot; is expressivity.\nAnd that *is* important and useful.\n\n&gt; And we all know about the effort it\n&gt; takes to deploy new technologies on the client (browsed many XML/XSLT\n&gt; pages lately?) versus the server. So the whole project is doomed from\n&gt; the start because it doesn&#39;t buy anything and it has tremendous costs.\n\nThis is an absolutely ridiculous non-sequiter conclusion, you know?  I&#39;m not\nquite sure what all this scary &quot;new technology&quot; you think is necessary actually\nis.  At a minimum, all a server would need to do to use structured names is\nwrite the rules down in English on a Webpage for how to construct URI to their\nresources of interest.  Humans *and* developers could then use those rules as\nthey saw fit, or not.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
