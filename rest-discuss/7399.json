I would need an explanation of how that&#39;s similar, so this could be\nclarified or replaced with something more understandable.\n\n&gt; Similarly, we can also query a complex resource, such as a blog, to get\nparts of the data:\nThis isn&#39;t querying a resource, it simply /is/ a resource. You might say\nsomething like a resource can represent complex information like &quot;all the\nblog comments after a particular timestamp written by &#39;anonymous&#39; &quot;. The\nclient doesn&#39;t need to know just how complex things could be for the server\n- it just does a GET.\n\n&gt; All data resources support GET, but not all behavioral resources do. \nWhat&#39;s a &quot;data resource&quot; compared to &quot;behavioral resource&quot; - you might\nrephrase that to say that some resources are read-only.\n\n&gt; While a GET request cannot have side-effects, it can return only parts of\nthe resource.  \n&gt; This means that GET is both an atomic read, as well as a query operation.\nThis is not correct - GET does not return parts of a resource. At least, not\nthe way you suggest with query terms.\nYou might want to describe that a GET could be a simple static file or a\ncomplex query operation - both are simply retrievals of data.\n\n&gt; If two PUT operations occur simultaneously, one of them will win and\ndetermine the final state of the resource. \nWhat happens to the other one? I think that both win. REST gives rise to all\nsorts of win-win situations.\n\n&gt; In the case of two simultaneous DELETE operations, one of them may fail\nsince the resource \n&gt; will have already been deleted.\nNope. It&#39;s important to realize that /both/ succeed. There should be no\nerror code. The protocol does not assume a &quot;locate object or fail, activate\nobject or fail, invoke method on object&quot; - it just says &quot;make sure the\nresource is gone when the request completes&quot;. An absent resource is just as\ngone as a recently deleted one.\n\n&gt; The POST operation is very generic and no specific meaning can be attached\nto it. \nThere is meaning associated with it, and unique aspects regarding\nrepeatability and caching.\n\n&gt; In general, use POST when only a subset of a resource needs to be modified\nand it cannot be accessed \n&gt; as its own resource; or when the equivalent of a method call must be\nexposed.\nRather than suggesting a generic method calls is appropriate via POST,\nperhaps you could narrow it down to modification operations that don&#39;t fit\ninto PUT or DELETE.\n\n&gt; We can also update individual properties of the entry, because they are\nexposed as nested resources. \nThere isn&#39;t a concept of a &#39;nested resource&#39;. And this example only works\nbecause the server implements it that way, it&#39;s not part of REST or HTTP (or\neven most Web server frameworks unfortunately). And there is no requirement\nthat the second resource that is the &#39;property of the entry&#39; use a URI with\npaths - it could just as easily be:\n PUT http://myserver/myaddressbook/johndoe?prop=27\n PUT http://myserver/myaddressbook/phones?user=johndoe&type=work\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Steve G.
