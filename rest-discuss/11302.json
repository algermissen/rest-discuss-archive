Normal requests are \nstill sent normally to the client. Any request may trigger a notification on \nthe server, using a defined service document format used in a PUT.\n\nie. if the UA wants to advertise it has a /chat uri on which the server can \noperate, it will send a request to the client with a PUT /chatroom/1.\n\nOn the meteor connection, the client connects to a known endpoint (that it \ndiscovered through a service document on the root of the server), GET \n/$batch, and sends a request body containing a multipart entity of previous \nhttp responses. The response, when triggered, contains another such \nmultipart body, with one or many http requests encapsulated in it. When the \ntransfer is done, the client reissues the request and send the responses as \npart of the request.\n\nNeeds for PubSub are out there, and the limitations or what can be done with \nthe browser make us reuse http. That said, the more restful i can make the \nsystem the better it would be, but I&#39;m not entirely sure such a mechanism \nwould indeed be restful in any way.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom: &quot;Stuart Charlton&quot; &lt;stuartcharlton@...&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 15, 2008 7:41 PM\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Pushing with REST\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In particular, I&#39;d recommend looking at Kris Zyp&#39;s columns, who seems to \n&gt; be trying hard to fight against this Bayeux nonsense (don&#39;t ask if you \n&gt; don&#39;t know ;) with more Web-friendly solutions:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://cometdaily.com/2008/05/13/http-channels-2/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Wed, 9/10/08, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just as a set of HTTP/Javascript/DOM technologies and coding\n&gt;&gt; techniques got\n&gt;&gt; the name Ajax, there are a number of approaches for doing\n&gt;&gt; (pseudo) &quot;push&quot;\n&gt;&gt; with HTTP that go by the name &quot;Comet&quot;.
