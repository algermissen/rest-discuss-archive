You can build it with\n&gt; &gt; whatever yo=\r\nu want&quot; and you said: &quot;No, you can&#39;t build whatever you\n&gt; &gt; want with REST.=\r\n&quot;. Kind of different things, right? Same words,\n&gt; &gt; different order, differ=\r\nent meaning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry about that -- I read it as &quot;you can build with=\r\n it...&quot; which isn&#39;t\n&gt; what you wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; a. REST is not only for re=\r\nuse. If I don&#39;t care reuse, I can still\n&gt; &gt; have a case for REST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBut re-use is the entire basis for REST:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;By applying the software eng=\r\nineering principle of generality to the\n&gt; component interface, the overall =\r\nsystem architecture is simplified and\n&gt; the visibility of interactions is i=\r\nmproved.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t have a uniform interface, otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; b.=\r\n REST is NOT about all the nodes out there, is about my\n&gt; &gt; application.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is an explanation of an &quot;Internet-scale distributed hypermedia\n=\r\n&gt; system&quot; known as the Web.  While REST may be applied to other domains,\n&gt; =\r\nif you&#39;re using the Web, you can&#39;t ignore all those other nodes out\n&gt; there=\r\n, because those other nodes are what make the Web &quot;Internet scale.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If=\r\n none of the nodes between producer and consumer are capable of\n&gt; understan=\r\nding your messaging, then your application is *not* capable of\n&gt; achieving =\r\n&quot;Internet scale,&quot; therefore your application cannot achieve\n&gt; the goals of =\r\nREST -- such an architecture may be considered REST-like,\n&gt; or inspired by =\r\nREST, but cannot be considered REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; c. I may be wrong, but regi=\r\nstering is not the only way of achieving\n&gt; &gt; self-descriptive language. Aga=\r\nin, maybe Roy can tell me why, if it\n&gt; &gt; is, REST only solution is registra=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Please don&#39;t separate my point from the context in which it =\r\nwas made.\n&gt; On the Web, i.e. using HTTP over the Internet, there is simply =\r\nno\n&gt; alternative to using IANA-registered, standardized types.  This does\n&gt;=\r\n *not* mean that REST&#39;s only solution to self-descriptive messaging is\n&gt; th=\r\ne IANA registry -- it *does* mean there is no other way to achieve\n&gt; self-d=\r\nescriptive messaging on the Web.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; d. Non using IANA violates self=\r\n-description?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On the Web, if your system is following REST, you MU=\r\nST use IANA-\n&gt; registered standardized types, otherwise your messaging is *=\r\nnot* self-\n&gt; descriptive for the &quot;Internet-scale distributed hypermedia sys=\r\ntem&quot;\n&gt; you&#39;re supposedly targeting by pursuing REST using HTTP over the\n&gt; I=\r\nnternet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Style means you can use other things, following the sam=\r\ne principles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; True.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It means do not force to use IANA a=\r\nnd WEB for REST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody ever said it did.  If you *are* using the =\r\nWeb, then yes, REST\n&gt; *does* force you to use IANA-registered, standardized=\r\n types.  Because\n&gt; that&#39;s the only mechanism HTTP defines, and that everybo=\r\ndy agrees to,\n&gt; for the most important aspect of self-descriptive messaging=\r\n -- exposing\n&gt; the processing model of the payload without having to intros=\r\npect.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
