Knowing the XFORM up front will make you write a rigid \n&gt; client.

Don&#39;t get \nme wrong - I am trying hard to figure out the best RESTfull API for my \ncurrent project - not arguing against you, just trying to understand.\n\nThe XForm has a model, it&#39;s submission data, and some user interface. I can \neasily see how the submission information could be consumed dynamically - I \ncan extract the action URL, the method, and the media type at runtime and \nuse those instead of hard coded values. The user interface part seems \nirrelevant for m2m systems, so lets ignore that (but maybe I am wrong?).\n\nIt&#39;s the model that I find problematic. It&#39;s described by an XML schema and \nit seems to me that my client must have this schema baked into the code in \norder to work with it - how would it otherwise know how to mark-up the data \nneeded to describe, for instance, a purchase order? This is where my \nunderstanding of a dynamic client breaks down. The client may have multiple \nknown schemas to choose between - for instance Danish and German variations \nof purchase order schemas. But that&#39;s only semi-dynamic.\n\nHappy xmass everybody :-)\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, December 23, 2010 8:01 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: XForms vs. WSDL?\n\n\nHi again.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J�rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s certainly one important difference. With SOAP/WSDL you are \n&gt; given\n&gt; everything up front and have to figure out what to use when. With REST you\n&gt; are only served the links that fits the actual state. You cannot do the \n&gt; last\n&gt; with WSDL.\n\nWell, yes, you can. At least with WSDL (let&#39;s forget SOAP). WSDL is a web \nformat, registered in IANA, and I can get it dynamically and consume it \ndynamically. Nobody does it because of tools, granted. The shame is on the \ntool designers.\n\n&gt; I guess that depends on how you consume the XForm.\n\nTotally true. Knowing the XFORM up front will make you write a rigid client. \nSame for WSDL. Consuming the XFORM dynamically will make everybody happy. It \nis harder with WSDL, but possible too.\nHere the real difference is then the actual implementation, plus, I would \nsay, XFORM is still light, and WSDL we may label it as &quot;heavy&quot;.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n\n\n"}}
