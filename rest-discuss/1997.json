How do each control what can be done to the\nresource?  What keeps CompanyB from altering the Purchase Order?  And if\nthey do, how can CompanyA prove this if they don&#39;t even control the resource\npointed to by the above URI?\n\nI am not saying that the single-resource approach is wrong.  I just don&#39;t\nthink I understand it as well as you do...\n\n&gt; One consequence of having two resources is that their states are\n&gt; logically connected, that is, you need state-alignment transactions\n&gt; for subsequent interactions.  (This is not a killer requirement, you\n&gt; need a protocol for agreement on changes in a single-resource model,\n&gt; too.)\n\nI&#39;m not sure I follow you here.  What would be considered a &quot;state-alignment\ntransaction&quot; here?\n\n\nWhile I wait for an answer to that, here might be a scenario for a revision\n(a subsequent interaction):\n\nSuppose that CompanyA wanted to move the &quot;Ship By&quot; date forward a week.  In\ntheir system, they may create the updated PO and assign it the following\nURI:\n\n    http://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12345/A\n\n(though it could just has easily have been\nhttp://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12346)\n\nThis would then be submitted to CompanyB just as the original URI was\nsubmitted.  CompanyB would then GET the new PO (it&#39;s important to note that\nthe original URI is still valid and still returns a representation of the\noriginal PO).  This new PO would contain the original URI, which would allow\nCompanyB to see that this is a revised PO and not a new one.  CompanyB will\nissue an ack response:\n\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests/12136\n\nAt this point, CompanyB will determine what to do.  Supposing it can meet\nthe new deadline, it creates a new Sales Order (internally, it may be the\noriginal order with a revision attached to it).  This new order will be\nsubmitted back to CompanyA as:\n\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/55824/A\n\n(though it could just as easily have been http://CompanyB.com/Orders/55833)\n\nAnd we are now back to where we started from.  You will note that the\nrevision process was nearly identical to the initial process.  Also, the\nURIs are still as &#39;opaque&#39; as they were to start with.  Other than the need\nof each company to keep track of the relationship of their own URI to the\nother companie&#39;s URI, no additional state information is necessary.\nFurther, the creator of a given URI always pushes it to the other company\nand it is always being pushed to the related URI (either as a POST or as a\nresponse to a POST).  This make for easy management of related URIs between\ntwo parties.\n\nAs a side note, would this approach address some of Mike&#39;s concerns in [1].\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n[1] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-explore/message/86\n\n\n\n\n"}}
