In and of itself \nthough, URIs are to REST purely opaque strings.\n\nThis does not mean that URI design is irrelevant to the design of a good \nRESTful system. But generally it isn&#39;t important to the RESTfulness so \nmuch as other qualities of the system (unless you are building an \nexample to demonstrate REST, RESTfulness will not be your sole concern). \nThat REST doesn&#39;t give a damn about the URI itself means it leaves one \nfree to deal with such concerns as one sees fit.\n\nThere are uses of URIs that are counter to REST, Roy&#39;s dissertation \ngives examples of authorisation and session information being passed in \nthe URI, which is counter to REST. The exact same URI could be used in a \nRESTful system though (though such a choice of a URI that looks like it \ncontains session information when it fact it doesn&#39;t would be \nidiosyncratic to the point of being bizarre).\n\n\n"}}
