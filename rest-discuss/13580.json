This could\n&gt;&gt; ro=\r\nughly take one of two forms:\n&gt;&gt; 1. A set of specifications based on a range=\r\n of technologies that focus on\n&gt;&gt; REST constraint compliance, or\n&gt;&gt; 2. A mo=\r\nre HTTP-centric set of specifications working on providing features\n&gt;&gt; not =\r\navailable on the Web and probably not consistent with REST constraints\n&gt;&gt; s=\r\nuch as pub/sub, transactions, reliable POST, etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Methinks a little f=\r\nrom column A, and a little from column B.\n...\n&gt; These are all great points.=\r\n =C2=A0The output of REST-* is not meant to be an\n&gt; academic exercise. =C2=\r\n=A0We want to create specifications that can be implemented\n&gt; and solve spe=\r\ncific problems. =C2=A0While our goal is to be architecturally pure,\n&gt; softw=\r\nare, in general, is very rarely architecturely pure when in its final\n&gt; for=\r\nm. =C2=A0As a result, initial iterations (and even final ones) maybe a mix =\r\nof\n&gt; both HTTP and REST-centric designs. =C2=A0Remember, WE JUST STARTED!\n\n=\r\nI know how you feel. The architectures I build at the moment are all\nreal-t=\r\nime, so while REST is a template I have weakened statelessness\nand essentia=\r\nlly substituted cache for pub/sub. This is actually\nchanging over time and =\r\nthe architecture is just starting to come into\ncloser alignment with REST a=\r\ns developers begin to understand that even\nin a real-time system poll+cache=\r\n turns out to solve many problems\nbetter.\n\nIncidentally, I have a neat litt=\r\nle HTTP-friendly pub/sub protocol that\nI&#39;m working at the moment to free fr=\r\nom IP strictures within my\norganisation. I&#39;d love to talk to you guys about=\r\n it.\n\nIn trying to keep things clean from an architectural perspective, I\nw=\r\nould carefully consider defining up front a set of portfolios for\ndifferent=\r\n standards and that rules that must apply to each in order to\nfit a given p=\r\nortfolio. For example:\n* REST-style HTTP: Fully complies with REST style ar=\r\nchitecture in word\nand in deed. No transactions. No pessimistic locks. No p=\r\nub/sub. Fully\nstateless and all the rest. May still use features not widely=\r\n deployed\non the Web.\n* Transitional HTTP: Breaks REST constraints in some =\r\nway, probably by\nbreaking statelessness of client/server. Very likely they =\r\nstill fit\nthe Uniform Interface/Contract constraint but pay relatively litt=\r\nle\nheed to other constraints. These specifications are designed to fit\nwith=\r\n existing enterprise use, to allow that use to continue into the\nbrave new =\r\nHTTP world, and to allow enterprises to more easily\ntransition to REST-styl=\r\ne HTTP should they find they wish to do so.\n* HTTP Integration: Mappings of=\r\n HTTP semantics into other contexts to\nallow services who don&#39;t natively sp=\r\neak HTTP to utilise a simple\ngateway to achieve HTTP integration.\n\n&gt; This, =\r\nIMO, does not mean we should change the name of the site or to coin a\n&gt; new=\r\n buzzword. =C2=A0The goal we are striving for is to be RESTful. REST is our=\r\n\n&gt; ideal.\n\nYou understand, of course, that this is a subject that the REST =\r\ncamp\nare very touchy about :) Roy has stated his preference many times for\n=\r\nnew architectural styles to use their own names and not to try and\nreuse or=\r\n redefine REST. Roy has also worked hard for many years to\navoid REST the a=\r\nrchitectural style being confused with HTTP or the\nWeb. Calling this REST-*=\r\n is akin to renaming web services to SOA-* ;)\nThe backlash you have already=\r\n seen here I think is similar to what you\ncould expect from that renaming.\n=\r\n\nI can see why you want to proceed this way, for marketing and\npolitical ex=\r\npedience... but it is seen I think by Roy as a throwback\nto the dark old da=\r\nys. When Roy&#39;s not happy the community&#39;s not happy.\nI think you may be able=\r\n to improve the situation by careful wording\nand classification of standard=\r\ns, but it now looks inevitable that we\nwill see the ad come out &quot;now you ca=\r\nn buy a REST, and you don&#39;t even\nhave to change your architecture... the mi=\r\nddleware will do it all for\nyou&quot;.\n\nOn a practical level this may mean you g=\r\net less involvement by the\npeople who could really make a difference in def=\r\nining these\nspecifications, and that would be a shame. I guess that if the =\r\nname is\nfixed (as it would seem to be) we will all just have to live within=\r\n\nthe strictures of that situation and do what we can to clarify within\nthat=\r\n scope. Perhaps my suggestions above could help in that regard.\n\nBenjamin.\n=\r\n\n"}}
