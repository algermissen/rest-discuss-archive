The problem is currently there i=\r\nsn&#39;t a backend database, so where would we store the intermediate data?

Again, the &quot;POST\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to query&quot; thing involves storing state between requests, while Fielding\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; says RESTful APIs are better because of &quot;not having to store state betw=\r\neen\n&gt; &gt; requests&quot;. Well, which is it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think a key distincti=\r\non is creating and destroying resources vs. other\n&gt; &gt; kinds of state. The f=\r\normer is a key feature of REST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And more generally, I&#39;m trying to =\r\nunderstand what REST is all about. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; clear that the overwhelming maj=\r\nority of people who use the term REST\n&gt; &gt; actually mean nothing more than A=\r\nJAX. They merely haven&#39;t investigated at\n&gt; &gt; all what it is supposed to mea=\r\nn. Of the small minority who mean something\n&gt; &gt; more than AJAX, one gets th=\r\ne impression that there isn&#39;t any set of three\n&gt; &gt; people who agree on what=\r\n it means. So, it&#39;s a popular buzzword, and perhaps\n&gt; &gt; a religion, but is =\r\nit actually a design pattern, and is it actually useful,\n&gt; &gt; and can it act=\r\nually be used to design a substantial application with\n&gt; &gt; existing technol=\r\nogies?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recommend researching &quot;hypermedia&quot; for a higher sign=\r\nal to noise ratio\n&gt; &gt; about REST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Matt McClure\n&gt; &gt; http://mat=\r\nthewlmcclure.com\n&gt; &gt; http://www.mapmyfitness.com/profile/matthewlmcclure\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
