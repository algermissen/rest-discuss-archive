I&#39;ve had a go at implementing this, but it\n&gt; makes my lovely tidy RESTUL URLs look ugly and difficult to\n&gt; read/review.\n&gt; \n\nREST has nothing to do with your URI pattern.  If your URIs become\ndifficult to maintain, yeah that&#39;s a problem, but not one that has to\ndo with REST.\n\nWhat I&#39;m saying is, if your assumption is leading you in a direction\nyou don&#39;t want to go (request parameters), perhaps you should question\nyour assumption.\n\nDesigning responses which are cacheable creates more real-world\nbandwidth savings, than designing responses which are more granular and\napplication-specific.  This is counter-intuitive, but a key aspect of\nthe REST style.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
