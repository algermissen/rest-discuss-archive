I was guilty of this too, many years ago. (see \n&gt;http://xml.apache.org/xang/ but now I know better...)\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is when method=deleteStuff and the client does a GET. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;B) The URL itself does not indicate that the server will return a \n&gt;&gt;Hessian resource representation.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;The missing piece is that the way you discovered the URL will usually \n&gt;have associated information that strongly indicates what the purpose of \n&gt;the resource is. For example, some html like &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot;&gt; would lead \n&gt;you believe that image/gif would be returned.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What is still missing is this concept of REALMS in the sense that you \n&gt;&gt;can make assumptions about the service just by looking at the URL.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;This is generally a bad idea - the RESTful way is to use &#39;hypertext as \n&gt;the engine of application state&#39;. Use a document of some kind with the \n&gt;extra hints that you need. The URI should remain simple, opaque and \n&gt;used for one purpose.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Or the idea of changing protocol\n&gt;&gt;depending on the &quot;type&quot; of service I want to access. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thanks everyone for the input.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n\n"}}
