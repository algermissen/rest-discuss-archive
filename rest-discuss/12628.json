A lot faster than initial load.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I violently agree. Then, how do you express RESTfully a query\n&gt; &gt; inquiring about the possibility of a set of ~100, or for the sake\n&gt; &gt; of argument arbitrarily many, state transitions? The &quot;question&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; too long to stuff everything into the URL for a GET request. POST\n&gt; &gt; or PUT requests are technically, RESTfully not appropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2 possibilities come to mind:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. You got all the states etc from the server in the first place.\n&gt; Could you express a shorter query that would fit into the URL for a\n&gt; GET request, since you do not have to repeat everything for the\n&gt; server?\n\nI don&#39;t think so. Over the time of a session, the server could have sent \nlarge amounts of data to the client. To refer to any chunk of that data \nlater on is difficult at best. The only way to get a shortcut would be \nto reify conversational state, which, I think, would put an unnecessary \nburden on both client and server as, in principle, the interaction can \nbe completely stateless.\n\n&gt; 2.  Personally, I would not hesitate to user POST for this situation,\n&gt; if I could not make it work with GET.  Caching is not an issue\n&gt; anyway. But I am sure somebody else will disagree.\n\nI agree about the POST, using it is my fall-back solution at any rate, \nbut only when I&#39;m convinced that there is no better GET-based solution.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
