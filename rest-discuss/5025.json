In the presentation he asks, &quot;what do you\ndo if Oracle isn&#39;t big enough?&quot;  By simplifying what is being stored, there\nare opportunities to scale linearly much more easily (but again, I assume\nthat this means some burden is shifted to the client.)\n\nI actually think he&#39;s correct that RSS/Atom is becoming the standard\n&quot;Noun&quot; format that is the subject of the HTTP &quot;Verbs&quot; (with proxies\nand other intermediaries becoming the &quot;Adverbs&quot; I guess.)\n\nI&#39;d be curious to hear what others think of this.\n\nThanks,\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Roger L. Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 06, 2005 4:14 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] The role of queries in REST?\n\n\nHi Folks,\n\nMy question is with regards to the role of a Web site in supporting queries.\nLet me give an example to demonstrate what I mean.\n\nSuppose that a Web site implements this &quot;hierarchical model of resources&quot;\nfor a bombing mission:\n\nMission\n    Plan1\n         ...\n    Plan2\n        Aircraft\n            AA36\n                ...\n            BB06\n                Payload\n                    Bomb1\n                        ...\n                    Bomb2\n                        Fuze5\n\nBy implementing this hierarchy the Web site gives users the ability to get\nany resource by simply composing a URL, where &quot;/&quot; is used to express a\nparent-child relationship in the resource hierarchy.  For example, to obtain\nthe AA36 aircraft resource in Plan2 the user issues this URL:\n\n     &lt;http://[hostname]/Mission/Plan2/Aircraft/AA36&gt;\nhttp://[hostname]/Mission/Plan2/Aircraft/AA36\n\nThis is, of course, standard REST.\n\nNow consider this problem: how would the Web site support the many kinds of\nqueries that a user might want to make, e.g.,\n\n    &quot;Tell me all the Aircraft that carry Bomb1&quot;\n\nThe first approach that comes to mind is for the Web site to make available\na &quot;form&quot; that the user can retrieve, fill in, and return.  The Web site\nparses the form to extract the query, processes it, and returns the results\nto the user.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with this approach.  There are virtually\ninfinitely many different kinds of queries that  users may want to make.\nHow can a Web site possibly provide a form for every conceivable kind of\nquery?  It would be impossible to anticipate every kind of query that users\nmight want to make.\n\nMore importantly, I believe that focusing on &quot;forms&quot; is missing the point of\nREST.\n\nLet me now restate my original question:\n\n    What is the role of queries in a REST-based system?  How can a Web site\ngive\n    users the ability to retrieve the kinds of custom data that they desire?\n\n    How are queries done in a RESTful manner?\n\nBelow are some thoughts that I have on this issue.\n\nI believe that the REST model can be simply summed up as:\n\n     &quot;A Web site is composed of resources.  A Web site should provide a URL\nto\n      each resource and enable the exchange, updating and deleting of\nresources&quot;.\n\nThus, with REST it is always an exchange of resources and nothing else.\n\nSo when we start talking about a user filling in a form we are either\ntalking about a &quot;form resource&quot; or we are breaking away from the REST model.\nIf we are talking about a &quot;form resource&quot; then how would it fit into the\nabove mission resource hierarchy?\n\nI believe that it is not appropriate in REST to talk about forms.  Instead,\nwe should talk about resources.\n\nI believe that with the REST model the idea of issuing queries doesn&#39;t make\nsense.  With REST we exchange resources, not queries.\n\nThat said, I understand the desire to enable a user to query to a Web site\nfor information such as &quot;what aircraft carry Bomb1?&quot;.\n\nOne solution is: this is a user processing issue, not a Web site resource\nissue, so it is outside the scope of REST.  In other words, if a user wants\nto know what aircraft carry Bomb1 then it is up to the user to retrieve each\naircraft resource and do processing on each aircraft resource to determine\nif it carries Bomb1.\n\nThat&#39;s not a particularly satisfying solution.  Perhaps there a way to\nrephrase the question so that it involves an exchange of resources, rather\nthan a query exchange?\n\nI would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this issue.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
