Yes there are big \ncompanies trying to make money off fat central services. But ebXML \nhas a lot of components and many of them are peer-to-peer.  And there \nare also several people including me who are going through the ebXML \nstage of development in order to come out on the other side with \nsomething much simpler.  Some of those people went thru the eCo \nframework before, which was very RESTful, and think ebXML went astray \nin RegRep.  \n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
