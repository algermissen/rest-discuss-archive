XPL binds the\n     design and implementation together so =\r\nthat they are\n     interrelated. This has interesting consequences for vers=\r\nioning\n     and detailed discovery. A device can be interrogated to\n     di=\r\nscovery the structure of all the data that can be\n     sent/received to it.=\r\n Combined with scripting languages and other\n     methods it would allow cl=\r\nients to be built automatically with\n     zero code. XPL is the first time =\r\nthat you can implant a formal\n     protocol description in any device or ap=\r\nplication down to the\n     smallest of devices.\n\n\n"}}
