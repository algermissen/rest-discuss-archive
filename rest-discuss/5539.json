If I use POST which returns an  \n&gt; XML reponse, I use one operation.  If I first POST the portfolio, then GET  \n&gt; the results, presumably I would then have to do an operation to remove the  \n&gt; portfolio once I have a result, sort of a very primitive garbage  \n&gt; collection operation.  Is this approach others have taken to this sort of  \n&gt; problem?\n\nYes, the most direct tradeoff for having a limited set of operations is\nthe reduction of efficiency ... sometimes you need a sequence of steps\nwhere one would logically suffice.\n\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong, either, with the server managing the lifecycle of\nthe POSTed portfolios so as to limit consumed resources.\n\nIn any case, POST is perfectly suitable for &quot;providing a block of data\n[...] to a data-handling process&quot;.  The tradeoff there is going to be\ncaching behavior and browser behavior (warning the user on re-submitting\nPOSTed data, primarily).  IE might force your hand on this issue as\nwell, as it will not allow URLs greater than 2k characters or something,\nmaking GETting with large query strings impossible ... thought it&#39;s not\nclear if you&#39;re even using a browser in this scenario.\n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
