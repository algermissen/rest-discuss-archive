This is a\ngenuine question.\n\nIs the design of the URL important to the REST architectural style?\n\nFor a long time, I thought it was because I heard others saying it\nwas, and I see a lot of people talking about designing &quot;RESTful URLs,&quot;\nbut the more I dig into Roy&#39;s dissertation and the more I think about\nit, can a URL even be called &quot;RESTful?&quot; It seems to me that the term\ndoesn&#39;t apply to URLs.\n\nSure, REST has the concept of resources, and resources have addresses,\nand those addresses on the Web are Uniform Resource Identifiers, but\nis the design of those identifiers important to REST?\n\nI&#39;m asking because I truly want to know if, over time, the design of\nthe identifier has become a part of what it means to be RESTful.\nPerhaps it&#39;s become part of the concepts of REST over time as the\ncommunity has evolved and discourse has taken place to define what is\nand isn&#39;t RESTful. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking here.\n\nWhen I discuss REST on my blog, in articles, in presentations, etc.,\nis it important for me to also discuss the design of the URL?\n\nBy the way, I do think well-designed URLs are important. That&#39;s not the \nquestion I&#39;m asking. I&#39;m asking whether they are part of REST.\n\n-Ben\n\n"}}
