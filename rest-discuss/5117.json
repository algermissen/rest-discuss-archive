Do I have to wrap\n&gt; them up as a single r=\r\nesource and then pass that? Or a great, long URI\n&gt; including all the coordi=\r\nnate pairs? Or am I on the wrong track altogether?\n\nHere is one way to solv=\r\ne the problem. It&#39;s not the only one.\n\nThe four questions to ask when tryin=\r\ng to build something in a\nRESTful[1] manner is:\n\n1. What are the resources?=\r\n \n\n   In this case, it sounds like the resources are locations. It\ndoesn&#39;t =\r\nmatter the coordinates you use, the nature of the thing is\nlocation. So the=\r\n URIs should reflect that, and I would ensure that the\ncoordinate system wa=\r\ns part of the URI, that way you don&#39;t end up with\nconflicts in the future. =\r\nYou may want to look at Matrix URIs for\ninspiration[2].\n\n   www.example.com=\r\n/latlog;lat=3D40.2432342;lon=3D-81.0980809\n   www.example.com/spc;x=3D22314=\r\n56.12;y=3D456789.2323\n\n2. What are the representations?\n\n   Well, it sounds=\r\n like there are different ways to refer to a\nlocation, lat/lon, State Plane=\r\n Coordinates, etc. Since you are trying\nto build a converter, let&#39;s stuff a=\r\nll the coordinate systems into the\nrepresentation. Assuming you are ok with=\r\n using XML as the\nrepresentation you could return something like:\n\n    &lt;loc=\r\nation&gt;\n       &lt;latlon&gt;40.2432342/-81.0980809&lt;/latlon&gt;\n       &lt;state_plane&gt;2=\r\n231456.12/456789.2323&lt;/state_plane&gt;\n       ...\n    &lt;/location&gt;\n\nNote the ex=\r\ntensibility this gives you. To add a new coordinate type on\nthe output you =\r\nadd a new child element of &lt;location/&gt;. To accept a new\ncoordinate system o=\r\nn the input you mint a new URI:  \nhttp://example.com/some-new-coords;x=3D12=\r\n;y=3D13.\n\nIt also is rather simple for the client using this service  since=\r\n all\nthe representations contain all the coordinate types.\n\n[1] http://www.=\r\nxml.com/pub/a/2004/12/01/restful-web.html\n[2] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssue=\r\ns/MatrixURIs.html\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
