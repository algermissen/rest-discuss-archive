It=B4s a common prob=\r\nlem in distributed systems theory. Basically you can use message-ids (equiv=\r\nalent to your example) or use some ACK (acknowledge) technique / protocol (=\r\ni think there is something like POE post once exactly).\n\nI think the patter=\r\nn you described is slighty different: You POST your request to some factory=\r\n resource with a guid. It will return you the adress, where you can PUT the=\r\n person resource. If i remember correctly... :-)\n\nJakob\n\n--- In rest-discus=\r\ns@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jorn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Idempotent operations a=\r\nre good for various reasons - for instance to avoid multiple creation of th=\r\ne same resource in the face of network errors. But how is it actually done =\r\nin practice? What are your &quot;tricks of the trade&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Most implementations=\r\n I have seen requires the client to create some kind of GUID and use that i=\r\nn a PUT operation. For instance in order to create a new &quot;person&quot; resource:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   PUT /person/{person-guid} HTTP/1.1\n&gt;   Content-Type: ...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ...=\r\n user data ...\n&gt; \n&gt; If it fails then the client can retry the PUT operation=\r\n to the same URL. The server must then keep track of succeeded &quot;person-guid=\r\ns&quot; (is there any &quot;best practice&quot; for how this is done?).\n&gt; \n&gt; What other tr=\r\nicks do we have? Did I even get the above pattern right :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, J=\r\n=F8rn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
