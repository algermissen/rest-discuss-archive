(IMHO of course).\n\nYes, for current implementations.  Eventually, someone points\nout the security hole and some poor sap is assigned to make the browser\ncompliant with one or more standards, and suddenly they find out that\na raft of user-reported errors just go away.\n\n&gt; i will take two examples where i have had to use cookies as keys to\n&gt; server-side session state:\n&gt; 1. shopping cart.\n&gt; 2. authentication.\n&gt;\n&gt; it seems to me that early web/REST people may have thought shopping\n&gt; carts would be handled as client side state, and be all posted to an\n&gt; /orders resource or whatever at the end.  however this isn&#39;t the\n&gt; reality of how client UAs work.\n\nThat can be fixed.  Back in the really old days, all of the people who\nwere actually working on the Web implementations would talk about this\nkind of thing on www-talk and it would be implemented by half the\nbrowsers before the day ended.  Now such a suggestion would be tabled\nwithin the W3C and two years later they would figure out which working\ngroup has the appropriate right and W3C representation to work on the\ntopic, and two years after that we would have two different\nrecommendations based on technologies that none of the browsers \nimplement.\n\n&gt;&gt; Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication\n&gt;&gt; mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\n&gt;&gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http\n&gt;&gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\n&gt;&gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\n&gt;&gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n&gt;\n&gt; i think so.\n&gt;\n&gt; as mentioned by others, user agents need to display the entity returned\n&gt; by the server.  i would say they also need to supply &#39;log out&#39; UI and\n&gt; make the current authentication status highly visible and obvious.\n\nYes, that would be the correct fix.  Note that this is a well-known\nsecurity hole in browsers that has been consistently reported since\n1993, and yet no one ever fixed it.  Probably because Netscape and MSIE\nwere too busy battling over blink and marquee tags.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
