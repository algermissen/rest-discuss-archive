MS tools (client and server) are so poor at supporting\ncontent-type and accept properly that a whole &#39;community&#39; has grown up\nto learn to either ignore these issues or engage in a fatal dance of\ncontent-sniffing and hackery in order to get things done.\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\nOnce I started learning the details of HTTP programming w/ REST,\nthings have gotten much better (for me, at least&lt;g&gt;).\n\nMikeA\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 19, 2008 at 11:54 AM, Subbu Allamaraju\n&lt;subbu.allamaraju@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Exactly.\n&gt;\n&gt; A web service may, optionally, provide some symmetry, but that does not mean\n&gt; that they must be symmetric.\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mar 19, 2008, at 8:37 AM, Roger van de Kimmenade wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The way i see it:\n&gt;\n&gt; A resource has a representation which you can GET.

In both put and post you have a\n&gt; payloadrepresenting an entity in a certain content-type, I always understood\n&gt; this as meaning that you pass an entity representation in your payload, just\n&gt; like when a get is issued you get a representation in the response&#39;s\n&gt; payload.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that&#39;s not hte case, are you saying that get returns a representation\n&gt; but post and put submit an entity?
