You should just use JSSE&#39;s\n\n&gt; This does all the work for you as long as the JSSE client is already\n&gt; set up.\n\nSetting up JSSE, with the right certificate format for JSSE, and its matching\ncertificate /key for IIS at the other end, that&#39;s where it gets hard IMHO.\n\n\n\n&gt; Mark&#39;s scenario was the normal one.\nDavids, earlier this thread, is what I&#39;m chasing. I&#39;ve currently a server\ncommunicating with two clients. I need the server to be sure of\nthe clients identity.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t go to client certificates because that complicates things more\n&gt; from the client end and you can always put it in later.\n\n:-) Now is later.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think this is where Nic&#39;s story comes in? I need to export\n&gt; &gt; (from the server keystore) a public key with an alias for use on the client\n&gt; &gt; as Nic suggests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re getting really confused about this.\n\nI quite agree on that Nic! Even the jargon isn&#39;t regular in this neck\nof the woods.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ideally I&#39;d like to use a self certification (using the Java tools) but\n&gt; &gt; we couldn&#39;t get the java keystore values  into the IIS &#39;store&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; Could be that IIS just won&#39;t play with Java (Sun).\n&gt;\n&gt; No.\n\nAt least that&#39;s nice to know.\n\n\nregards\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
