In other words, the normal case is for many resources\n&gt; &gt; to share the same or overlapping state\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t quite get this. Do you make a distinction between two\n&gt; resources whose state happens to have the same value, and two\n&gt; resources who share the same state?\n\nYes, but not in that example.\n\n&gt; If I have two clocks, A and B, I can set them to have the same time.\n&gt; Maybe A is simulating traveling at the speed of light, so gradually A\n&gt; and B no longer have the same time. So initially the state happened to\n&gt; have the same value.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or I can synchronize A and B to the same time. And by this I want to\n&gt; mean that if I reset B, A will be reset too. This sounds like shared\n&gt; state. But then I would think that there is a third resource, C. I\n&gt; have set C to a particular time, and set A and B to refer to C. Which\n&gt; means there is no shared state at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or maybe I am completely missing the point.\n\nI think you missed the point.  You can have a single clock resource.\nA single &quot;minute-hand&quot; resource.  A single &quot;minutes-in-decimal&quot;\nresource.  A single &quot;hour-hand&quot; resource. ...  The state that\nis being shared is the common time model.  If you change the\n&quot;minute-hand&quot; resource, it will have a side-effect on the\n&quot;minutes-in-decimal&quot; resource state and the &quot;clock&quot; state.\nIf you change the clock state, it will probably result in changes\nto all the other resource states.  This is all normal and expected\nby the REST model, even though REST only talks about one resource\nat a time.  The interconnected states are not visible to the client\nbecause it doesn&#39;t need to know they exist (and not knowing is\nthe best way to avoid coupling between implementations).\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
