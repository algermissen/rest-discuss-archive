Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; Sure, but they&#39;ll have to define those anyway. Atompub just \n&gt; takes care of predefining the lower-level machinery so it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have to be reinvented over and over by everyone who \n&gt; has similar needs.\n\nOf course, but there are still many things in the use-case domain AtomPub\ndoesn&#39;t address so we end up having to deal with those. Hence back to the\nsame problem albeit higher up the stack.\n\n&gt; Wait, first you&#39;re telling me you don&#39;t like \n&gt; one-size-fits-all advocacy for Atompub, then you tell me we \n&gt; should just shoehorn all apps into the browser? :-)\n\nYou are putting words in my mouth, as usual. :)  \n\nI didn&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t like the one-size-fits-all aspect, that aspect I\ndo like; the uniform interface.  What I was tryng to say is there will still\nbe a need for use-case specifics and without some way to identify and codify\nthose we&#39;ll end up with the same problem, albeit higher up the stack (Is\nthere an echo in here? Am I repeating myself? :)\n\n&gt; Me, I hope that Atompub uptake is strong enough that we&#39;ll \n&gt; see browsers expand to support everything required that one \n&gt; day we shall, in fact, be able to interact with many Atompub \n&gt; services with just a browser. \n\nI have mixed feelings about that.  Yes, I assume I would like browser\nsupport but frankly I find the browser support in IE7 of RSS disconcerting.\nWhen I go there I expect to see the RSS, not the RSS view although I can&#39;t\nexactly say why yet.  It always frustrates me when I click a link on a\nGoogle search result page and realize that it was an RSS feed. If AtomPub\nproliferates for general purpose use, that could even get a lot worse.\n\nBut what I do know is I strongly believe there should be only one primary\nformat for the web, HTML.  The fact is has stayed the primary interface for\nyears from a user perspective is I believe one of the reasons the web has\nbeen so successful. Throw lots of complexity into the mix and it will just\nmuddy everything.\n\n&gt; (In fact, with XMLHttpRequest you already can.)\n\nActually, that&#39;s not true. Browsers don&#39;t natively display things using\nXMLHttpRequest, it is a capability that needs to be programmed.  By your\nlogic then Java applets and in some browsers ActiveX controls can all be\ninteracted with via a browser.  Tell me, how many grandmas are interacting\nwith XMLHttpRequest?\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t mean just Atompub support here, btw; I mean general \n&gt; support for more of HTTP (like methods other than GET and \n&gt; POST - what a concept!), and markup languages like HTML5 that \n&gt; allow users to actually exploit this expanded support.\n&gt; \n\nThat I concur with.\n\n&gt; &gt; it requires web services be created in addition to web pages.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d really advocate for exposing webservices as a default case via \n&gt; &gt; semantic HTML instead of AtomPub\n&gt; \n&gt; How is that different? A WordPress blog has a public face and \n&gt; an admin area. Isn&#39;t it really kind of incidental what kind \n&gt; of content types get exchanged on which half of the service?\n\nThe differences are:\n\n-- the requirement to develop seperately for multiple content types.\n-- the high liklihood that the two efforts will result in output lacking\n100% fidelity.\n-- the high liklihood that the web service won&#39;t be developed even though\nthe web site is.\n-- that tools available for HTML, including browsers, will never in their\nentirety be available for AtomPub.\n-- the fact that the default interaction for users on the web is with\ncontent that behaves like HTML\n\nHaving it be a best practice where building a website means building a web\nservice will ensure many more web services actually get built. And we can\nsee significant uptake if we just get CMS developers to consider this a best\npractice. I&#39;m currently working in Drupal and I plan to look at how Drupal\ncan be made to offer web services by default.\n\nThe only way it is viable in my world view is if the CMS that is generating\nthe content type generates them with 100% fidelity without user/admin\ninvolvement; i.e. the content in HTML is exactly the same as in AtomPub. For\nexample, TurboGears does it that way. And even then, it doesn&#39;t allows\nsomeone to navigate the web service with a browser and be able to see w/o\nprogramming the data complete with links they can right-click to retrieve\nsaid information.\n\n&gt; The important point is that no approach will remove this \n&gt; public-vs-editable segregation for most apps.\n\nI don&#39;t understand your terminology.\n\n&gt; And semantic HTML, uhm, good luck repairing \n&gt; HTML-as-she-is-spoke sufficiently that it becomes \n&gt; machine-consumable, in a reasonable timeframe. \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t like that myself, but, while we may all gaze at the \n&gt; stars, we&#39;re still down here in this gutter.\n\nYou are looking at it wrong. We don&#39;t need to get everyone to convert all\nHTML content as we would need to in order to be able to make a clean slate\nHTML5 possible, we just need to have it evolve as a best practice with\nsoftware like WordPress and Drupal leading the way.  It&#39;s a win for those\nwebsites and CMS that implement it.\nWe don&#39;t need 100% of the web for this to be useful. Each site that does it\nwill be useful in its own right.  Clearly the same is true for AtomPub; we\ndon&#39;t have lots of existing AtomPub to convert either.\n\nThat said, you mention that AtomPub handles things for you so you don&#39;t have\nto. I&#39;ve read the AtomPub spec, although I don&#39;t know how awake I was\nreading it considering how long it is, and I didn&#39;t see anything earth\nshattering. I see AtomPub as a very valuable albeit specialty\nprotocol/format. It seems you see it for general purpose use. Can you tell\nme specifically what it is about AtomPub that causes you to value its use\noutside the nominal case of publishing?  \n\nMaybe it is a panacea and I just don&#39;t yet see it. Here&#39;s your chance,\nconvert me.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n"}}
