Something that certainly won&#39;t work!\n&gt; \n&gt; I totally a=\r\ngree that switching on domain specific information / capabilities \n&gt; in the=\r\n media type feels intuitive, makes life easier, and makes HTTP work \n&gt; with=\r\n you instead of against you. But I am having a seriously hard time \n&gt; decid=\r\ning on whether or not to do it - what do I gain and, more interesting, \n&gt; w=\r\nhat do I loose?\n\nMy approach has always been to radically stick with pure R=\r\nEST (and HTTP as it is), even if I had a hard time seeing the reasons. I us=\r\ned that &quot;REST is correct and sufficient&quot; position to challenge me to work m=\r\ny way backwards and adjust my POV. So far, I have always found that my POV =\r\nwas wrong and once I wend through the necessary mind shift everything made =\r\nsense. Hence, I never asked &quot;what would I loose?&quot; because I took the succes=\r\ns of the Web through over a decade of evolution as proof enough.\n\nBut then,=\r\n it is a sensible thing to ask, of course.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if we mint new media t=\r\nypes - when and for what purpose should we do \n&gt; that?\n\nEverytime you need =\r\nto enable communication that cannot be enabled without adding out-of-band k=\r\nnowledge to an existing media type. (With the caveat, that some stuff can r=\r\neally usefully be achieved with a bunch of link relations and/or profiling =\r\nmechanisms (Mike Amundsen being the expert on this, IMHO).\n\nProcurement is =\r\nin my opinion clearly something that merits minting a new media type (or bu=\r\nnch of types; see below). RESTifying ITIL, too. Financial reporting, news m=\r\nanagement / publishing, controlling, project management and stuff like that=\r\n (large busuiness domains) IMHO make good candidates for media types.\n\nThes=\r\ne types need not be global (registered with IANA) if you use them inside an=\r\n organization. It is not likely that there will ever be a common model for =\r\nsuch things suitable for all organizations. That is no problem though, you =\r\nget the benefits of REST anyhow, even if you install only-your-enterprise-g=\r\nlobal media type registries (=3D=3Downers). Likewise, if you expose service=\r\ns to business partners and customers, it will be better to give them media =\r\ntypes you own than use RPC APIs (which the typical HTML described so called=\r\n Web APIs essentially are).\n\nAnd maybe, your type is so useful or your user=\r\n base so large (Google, Amazon - are you listening?) that you can make for =\r\na de-facto standard.\n\n&gt; Lets talk about e-procurement again. In this domain=\r\n we have orders and \n&gt; bills. What media types should we have?\n&gt; \n&gt; Should =\r\nwe have only one media type (like Webber&#39;s \n&gt; application/vnd.restbucks+xml=\r\n in \n&gt; http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/):\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  application/e-procurement+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; or many media types:\n&gt; \n&gt;  applicatio=\r\nn/e-procurement.order+xml\n&gt;  application/e-procurement.bill+xml\n&gt;  applicat=\r\nion/e-procurement.person+xml\n&gt; \n\nGood question. I favor larger types, compr=\r\nising a set of &#39;business documents&#39; because they allow describing the &#39;doma=\r\nin&#39; in a single, connected document. So I&#39;d have application/procurement or=\r\n maybe spilt sub-domains like sourcing, ordering, billing, fulfillment, tra=\r\nnsport to allow for the implementation of clients for subdomains without ha=\r\nving to implement all of procurement. E.g. there would be great value if al=\r\nl online shops used some applications/souring media type for presenting lis=\r\nts of articles and prices and allowing client-driven requests for quotation=\r\ns etc. If one would have to implement all the stuff related to transport in=\r\nitiation we&#39;d never see any adoption whatsoever let alone a standard in the=\r\n first place :-)\n\nSo...it depends :-)\n\n&gt; As we extend the application we ar=\r\ne probably going to need stuff like \n&gt; inventory, reservation, bank account=\r\n, money transfer and so on. If each of \n&gt; these are going to get their own =\r\nmedia type then we end up with the known \n&gt; &quot;over proliferation of media ty=\r\npes&quot;\n\nIs that so? Why would it be an &quot;over proliferation&quot; to have about a c=\r\nouple of dozen types for a domain that covers 50% (80%? 90%?) of IT-enabled=\r\n interactions?\n\nWhy let the perceived fact of this being an &quot;over prolifera=\r\ntion&quot; drive a design decision? (And why is it less of a problem to have thi=\r\ns over proliferation of languages elsewhere? - You cannot make it go away a=\r\nnyhow!)\n\n&gt; as opposed to sticking to a few well \n&gt; known media formats.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; But, to argue against my previous post - this is an e-procurement REST AP=\r\nI - \n&gt; meaning &quot;this is one specific instance of the REST architecture&quot;.\n\nH=\r\nTTP(the Web) is an instance of REST. What you are talking about is a set of=\r\n types of data elements - enabling a set of possible applications.\n\n&gt; It ha=\r\nppens \n&gt; to work with HTTP which has many more media types, but for this sp=\r\necific \n&gt; REST instance (e-procurement) we actually don&#39;t have that many me=\r\ndia types.\n\nWrt terminology: e-procurement refers to a set of perceived/int=\r\nended applications, not an instance of REST.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If this is a valid inter=\r\npretation of REST as an achitecture,\n\nREST is an arch. style, not an archit=\r\necture. HTTP(the Web) is an architecture.\n\n&gt; and \n&gt; e-procurement as an ins=\r\ntance of it, then the &quot;over proliferation of media \n&gt; types&quot; is a non-probl=\r\nem - there won&#39;t be that many media types per API / \n&gt; instance of REST.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Do I sound scizophrenic?\n\nNo, you sound like someone who is really tryin=\r\ng to apply REST in a context that is not yet covered by existing media type=\r\ns. You are definitely asking the right questions.\n\n&gt; Probably. I feel so. L=\r\nike running around in \n&gt; circles.
