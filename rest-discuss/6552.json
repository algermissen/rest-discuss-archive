This is an RPC\n&gt; &gt; protocol using JSON format. Correct?  \n&gt; REST allows code-on-demand.  As such, I don&#39;t think it breaks REST for a\n&gt; server to deliver code (here: XHR-calling javascript) that is tailored\n&gt; to talk back to the source server in a specific media type (albeit and\n&gt; ad-hoc RPC-in-JSON).  I&#39;d constrast this with a public API that had the\n&gt; similar form, but was only described as an RPC layer on top of POST or\n&gt; PUT, and expected specialized clients to be written to that specific\n&gt; protocol. \n\nCode-on-demand is included as an optional REST feature to provide\nadditional client-side features without explicit software roll-out.\nJavascript allowing google maps to use my scroll-wheel as a zoom control\nmight be an example of this. REST&#39;s constraints should still apply to a\nclient upgraded in this way. Its interactions with the server should be\nstateless, standard methods should be used, etc.\n\nThe REST Triangle separates nouns, verbs, and content types. I believe\nwe should be wary of crossovers between these vertices. Content that\ncontains verbs should be avoided. I would be wary of sending a list of\ncommands as content back to the server, myself. I don&#39;t think it cleanly\nmaps to the code-on-demand feature, as the server already has the all of\nthe features it needs. The client is effectively writing a program that\nthe server should execute as an alternative to a more standard\ncommunication pattern.\n\n&gt; In a similar way, it doesn&#39;t break REST to have a form include the\n&gt; name-value &quot;operation=reserve_ticket&quot; ... the user-agent is still\n&gt; executing a POST of content as dictated by the server and the shared\n&gt; media types involved.\n\nWell, &quot;break REST&quot; would be a strong statement. I would suggest however\nthat nouns with verbs in them should also set off warning bells.\nExisting web forms technology doesn&#39;t really offer us a better\nalternative mechanism, except to use multiple forms for different\noperations. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the ideal approach :)\n\nMy advice: In all things, do what is practical... but keep an eye on\nwhere you might like to be. Keep an eye on the ideal.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
