What&#39;s\n&gt;interesting to me is whether this is compliant to RFC2616,\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re getting from this...\n\n&quot;The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional\ninformation about the response which cannot be placed in the\nStatus-Line. These header fields give information about the server and\nabout further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.&quot;\n\n...to &quot;4xx responses are not allowed to have ETags&quot;, I&#39;m just not seeing \nthat in there at all.  A 410 response with an entity body, can obviously \nhave an entity tag.  Any entity body, can have an entity tag, according \nto the spec.  It is &quot;information about the response&quot; to the request.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I guess we&#39;ll continue to disagree whether a 404/410 response is a\n&gt;representation of a resource. As far as I am concerned, it is not. It&#39;s\n&gt;the way how the server states that there is no representation it can\n&gt;send, so an ETag on that message is meaningless.\n&gt;\n\nDoes it matter?  According to RFC 2616, sec. 7:\n\n&quot;Request and Response messages MAY transfer an entity if not otherwise \nrestricted by the request method or response status code.&quot;\n\nA 204 response, then, may not have an entity but a 410 response certainly \ncan.  If I&#39;m transferring an entity as part of a response, then I can give \nthat entity a tag.  The definition of &quot;entity&quot; in sec. 1.3 is:\n\n&quot;The information transferred as the payload of a request or response. An \nentity consists of metainformation in the form of entity-header fields and \ncontent in the form of an entity-body, as described in section 7.&quot;\n\nMy 410 Gone response has a payload, or entity, which consists of both \nentity-headers (like ETag) and an entity-body (an HTML message).  You&#39;re \nnot convincing me this goes against RFC 2616.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
