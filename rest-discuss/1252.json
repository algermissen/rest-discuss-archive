The hypertext instance is an instance of a\n&gt; &gt; document type defined by a schema.\n&gt; By &#39;instance based&#39; I meant &#39;instance of a resource&#39;. You can&#39;t get the URI\n&gt; to a resource before the resource exists. \n\nIt&#39;s like saying you can&#39;t get a pointer to an object before it exists.\nSo what? You know the object&#39;s class and you know the document&#39;s schema.\nOr you would, if you use a service description language that allows you\nto strongly type URI references...or you could use RDF Schema.\n\n&gt; ... Actually, you can, if the server\n&gt; decides the URI. In the case of PUT, the client decides the URI - but that\n&gt; might be problematic in general. \n\nExcept in a content management environment, the client should PUT to a\nURI provided by the server. In &quot;web services&quot;, the server owns the\nnamespace.\n\n&gt; ... The client could use POST to request that a\n&gt; new resource be created and the server can report what that server-generated\n&gt; URI is - I suppose that would solve that problem.\n\nYes, that&#39;s how I think it should work. Otherwise how would the client\nchoose the URI??\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not 100% sure if this addresses the gist of your concern because I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t see how pattern-based identifiers would help. The question is\n&gt; &gt; whether you have the information you need available at design time or\n&gt; &gt; not. With pattern-based systems you presumably have some regular\n&gt; &gt; expression language or something. With XML you have schemas.\n&gt; The pattern could be XML or something. Doesn&#39;t have to a &#39;grep&#39; like\n&gt; language.\n\nNevertheless, it is a curently non-existent language versus a small\nextension to XML Schema for strongly typed URIs.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
