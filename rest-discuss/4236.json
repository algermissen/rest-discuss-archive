Alexander Jacobson \nwrote:\n&gt; If you have isolation, GET on a public resource\n&gt; (within the scope of the transaction) changes the\n&gt; state of the transaction because whether the\n&gt; transaction closes now depends on whether the GET\n&gt; resource is modified before the subsequent COMMIT.\n\nNope.\n\n&gt; For example:\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET URI1\n&gt;   OPEN TRANSACTION\n&gt;   GET URI1\n&gt;   PUT URI2 VALUE\n&gt;   PUT URI3 VALUE\n&gt;   COMMIT\n&gt;\n&gt; The first GET has no effect on the outcome of the\n&gt; transtion.  The second GET changes the state of\n&gt; the transaction.  In particular, the result of the\n&gt; GET is that the transaction may fail may cause the\n&gt; subsequent sequence of actions to fail (if URI1\n&gt; changes before the second PUT).\n\nNope.  As far as I can tell, you are just inventing transaction\nsemantics that don&#39;t exist.  Transaction success or failure\ndepends on whether the server can cause the combined state change\nrequested by those requests, as a whole, to take effect on the\nserver as a result of the commit.  The only requests that matter\nto the transaction processor are the ones that verify preconditions\nand those that change state.  If the client places a precondition\non the GET request, then that is what they want.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
