Could be deleted, but \n&gt; that&#39;s often disallowed in business.  So it should be canceled.  And \n&gt; let&#39;s say that it is the Buyer&#39;s responsibility to do so.\n\nIf the seller wants to give the buyer that option, I suppose it\ncould return a 201 (Created) response with the URI of the offer\nin the Location header of the response.  Then the buyer would\njust DELETE it to cancel the order.\n\nIf richer cancellation semantics are required, a separate &quot;cancel&quot;\ndocument should be used, since I would expect that somebody would\nwant to track that as a separate document.  i.e the buyer POSTs a\n&quot;cancel order&quot; document which includes a link to the offer resource\nURI returned on the aforementioned 201 response.\n\n&gt; Just to indicate more where I am going with this line of inquiry, the \n&gt; next problem I want to think about is the &quot;counteroffer pending&quot; \n&gt; response, where the Seller will next make a counteroffer to the \n&gt; Buyer.\n\nDoes the offer of a counteroffer infer a rejection of the original\noffer?  I would expect so.  So in that case, the response to the\noffer document being POSTed could be a rejection document which\nincluded a URI to a counteroffer.  Or it could be included inline\nas part of the rejection.\n\n&gt; Where I am trying to go is into the resource model for this stuff: \n&gt; what becomes a Web resource, where?  \n\nEverything with identity is a resource.  That doesn&#39;t mean that a\nrepresentation has to be retrieved with a GET though; it&#39;s fine for it\nto be sent as a request or response, with the Content-Location header\nincluded so that the recipient can do a GET later if required.\n\nIn this case, the initial offer from buyer to seller would be POSTed\nwith a Content-Location header, and the seller *could* invoke GET if\nthey lost their copy 8-) (other cases might have a better use of GET).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
