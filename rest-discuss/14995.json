Your example is exactly what I =\r\nam thinking of.\n\nUnfortunately, in a strictly RESTful way, it is also wrong=\r\n. It completely ignores the HATEOS principle.\n\nSee for instance Roy Fieldin=\r\ngs (now fameous) rant: http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be=\r\n-hypertext-driven. Or the Starbucks example: http://www.infoq.com/articles/=\r\nwebber-rest-workflow. Or Subbus post: http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/09/on-=\r\nlinking-part-1\n\nConsider this situation: your are surfing the web and a fri=\r\nend of yours comes by with an Amazon order ID. &quot;Could you please check this=\r\n order for me?&quot; he says. &quot;Sure!&quot; you answer. Now what do you do? I am quite=\r\n sure that you are not going to type the direct Amazon order url into your =\r\nbrowser - how would you know what it should look like? But this is equivale=\r\nnt to your suggested REST API consumer - when you pass it an order ID, it u=\r\ntilizes it&#39;s apriori (&quot;at design time&quot;) knowledge of the REST API&#39;s URL str=\r\nucture.\n\nOn the user facing web you don&#39;t expect to have any knowledge of U=\r\nRL structures. Instead you follow links, do searches, and let the end serve=\r\nr calculate the links for you. This is missing link in many REST APIs: they=\r\n force the client to completely understand the URL structure in order to us=\r\ne the API. This in turns make the client brittle and will cause it to break=\r\n the first time REST API changes structure.\n\nSo for these reasons I cannot =\r\nsee other solutions than handing resource URLs around as parameters in my w=\r\nebsite URLs.\n\nWhat I am trying to, is to point out one of the consequences =\r\nof consuming a truely RESTful API. Namely that your API consumers cannot wo=\r\nrk with simple item IDs, but have to pass complete resource URLs around.\n\n/=\r\nJ=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
