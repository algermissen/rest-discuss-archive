However, many of the applications for HTTP Events that I\n&gt; can think of are _personal_, and in the radical vision I&#39;d expect my\n&gt; personal computer to have several apps listening to and sending HTTP\n&gt; events.  \n\nWe&#39;re talking utopian here. &quot;Personal HTTP Events&quot; is not high on my\npriority list. I&#39;m thinking more about web services stuff. But here&#39;s my\nUtopian view of personal HTTP events.\n\nYour identity will be something like\n\nascher.com/~david\n\nThere is no need to have different identities for different protocols\n(email, ftp, http, .NET). You&#39;ll have one HTTP-addressable identity.\nHowever, portions of the address space can be used for different\napplications (email versus IM versus web serving). On the other hand, we\nmay find that these different applications are not \n\nYour desktop is likely to be either behind a firewall or mobile or\ndistributed between home and work. So like IMAP, I would say that events\nTO YOU go to this reliable, trusted address, maintained by professionals\n(or yourself, if you are up to it). Transiant machines you happen to be\nusing can sync parts of that space when you connect to them -- just like\nIMAP. You can have policies for when things are deleted on either the\nclient or the server.\n\nTo punch through a firewall you make a single persistent HTTP request to\nthat machine. This request is a fake. It serves the role of a VPN from\nthe server to you. Now you and the server can use plain HTTP events to\nhave it route messages to you in realtime over this pipe. The different\napps on your desktop will register themselves with the different\nportions of the namespace. Probably each of them will set up their own\nfake HTTP request tunnel. If it gets timed out they can easily\nre-establish it.\n\nThe VPN-work-alike hack is necessary because many firewalls will not\nallow connectivity IN, only OUT. So just like VPN or MSN, you will type\nin your identity (a URI) and your password and it will contact the\nintermediary. Unlike MSN (or .NET in general) the outside intermediary\nis not a big central machine in the sky. It&#39;s something run by your ISP\nor your BSD box at home. The nice thing is that if you turn off an app,\nyou can be confident that your local device isn&#39;t still getting barraged\nby events (e.g. hack attacks) from the outside. Nobody even knows the\ndevice exists except your intermediary box. The intermediary box could\ndo spam and virus filtering.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
