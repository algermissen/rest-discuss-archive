It&#39;s self-descriptive, which\nis an explicit rest interface constraint (see\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5\n_1_5), it enables clients to treat urls opaquely (see\nhttp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque), and it furthers your\napp&#39;s web of linked resources, harnessing the awesome power of the world\nwide web.\n\n  Justin\n\n\n"}}
