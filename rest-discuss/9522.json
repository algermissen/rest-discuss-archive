A server that does useless things with a PUT request\n&gt; &gt; but returns the right status codes isn&#39;t broken; it&#39;s simply\n&gt; &gt; useless. There is no problem with this, though: usefulness is\n&gt; &gt; a human concept, not a formal one. In the long run, no one will\n&gt; &gt; continue using such a server; and that&#39;s the end of its useless\n&gt; &gt; but compliant behaviour.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what are the right status codes? And under what conditions are\n&gt; servers allowed to return them? That&#39;s the rub. If the server returns\n&gt; 200 OK or 201 CREATED what may the client reasonably infer from that\n&gt; response about what the server has done?\n\nIt can only infer that the server feels it has met the obligations in\nthe HTTP request as defined by the HTTP protocol.  In the case of PUT,\nthat means that the server feels that the action it has taken sets the\nstate of the targetted resource to that represented in the request.\nThe client can&#39;t infer anything else about what the server might or\nmight not have done, otherwise it would be more tightly coupled to\nthat particular server.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
