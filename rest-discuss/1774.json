In SQL-92 parlance I was referring to EXECUTE. \n\nMy observation/question was that EXEC[UTE] is a &quot;method for passing data\nto some thing for processing&quot;, which feels similar on some levels to\nPOST. \n\nI really like the REST&lt;-&gt;CRUD analogy, BTW.\n\n--Peter\n\n[1] http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mark Baker [mailto:mbaker@...] \nSent: Tuesday, July 09, 2002 10:12 AM\nTo: Peter Drayton; S.

SQL92 doesn&#39;t appear to.\n\nIf it&#39;s a method for passing data to some thing for processing, then I\nguess it probably is the same, though the name &quot;EXEC&quot; doesn&#39;t suggest\nthat it&#39;s the same.  And not knowing the state after a stored procedure\nexecutes is necessary but insufficient to be the same as POST.\n\nMB\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Peter Drayton \nSent: Tue 7/9/2002 2:45 AM \nTo: Mark Baker; &#39;S.
