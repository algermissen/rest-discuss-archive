I tried to make the slides as\ninformative as possible, but there&#39;s only so much you can do with\nslides.\n\n&gt; You say a web service is a command interface for &quot;pushing&quot; commands.\n&gt; I think it more accurate to say it is an interface for &quot;pushing&quot; state.\n\nCould you clarify, perhaps with an example?\n\n&gt; Moreover, the lambda calculus is theoretically incompatible with state\n&gt; change, requiring Monads as a separate path to describe state change --\n\nCertainly Church&#39;s lambda-calculus did not have state change, but\nmany of the languages based on the lambda-calculus have\nincorporated side-effects. When the presentation uses the term\nlambda, it is using the term in much the same way as it is used in\nLisp.  Each node in the graph is a closure. The HTTP POST verb is\nthen understood to mean &quot;apply&quot;.\n\nAlso note that the web-calculus is just an interface model, not a\ncomputation model. The model used on the server to represent state\nchange is not relevant to the web-calculus. The web-calculus is\nsolely concerned with the interface the server exposes to the\nclient, just as REST is. Given this limitation, we are only\nconcerned with the interface aspects of the lambda-calculus,\nnamely applying arguments to an anonymous closure. In HTTP terms,\nPOSTing to a resource identified only by a URL.\n\nAs further explained in the presentation, the web-calculus then\nextends the lambda-calculus model by incorporating graph\nintrospection, or GET in HTTP terms.\n\n&gt; Perhaps I am not understanding Web Calculus, but, based on this\n&gt; presentation, it strikes me as inconsistent with ReST, MoST, and the lambda\n&gt; calculus.  Perhaps you can clarify.\n\nI suggest viewing the video. I am working on a paper based on the\nvideo, but it is not ready yet. Of course, there is also the\nweb-calculus specification itself. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/\n\nIn the presentation, I show how the web-calculus is defined,\nstarting from REST&#39;s constraints. Definition of the web-calculus\nproceeds by adding constraints. This process yields a model that\nis compatible with REST, as the end product necessarily conforms\nto REST&#39;s constraints.\n\nThe HP presentation is at:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/HP2003/\n\n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt; PS I am in the bay area for the next week.  I&#39;d love to meet up for coffee\n&gt; and talk about this stuff in person if you have the time.\n\nA face-to-face meeting would be great, but unfortunately I am not\nin the Bay Area anymore. I was just down visiting friends when\nMark Miller and Alan Karp arranged for the presentation at HP\nLabs. Mark introduces me at the start of the presentation video.\nYou may know Mark from his work on the E language\n&lt;http://www.erights.org/&gt; and Xanadu, a precursor of the WWW.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
