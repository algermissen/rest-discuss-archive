Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; I am still trying to get a grip on my thinking, but the point is\n&gt; that state means a different thing for the server than for the\n&gt; client. The client may keep implicit state that persists across\n&gt; requests, but the server may not. State on the server is always\n&gt; explicit, exposed via resources.\n\nBoth the server and the client will have state.\n\nConnections do not have state. The server will not make any assumptions \nabout the client&#39;s state based on previous operations. The client will \nnot make any assumptions about the server&#39;s state based on previous \noperations (though checking that a previous known state is still valid \nmay only require a cache look up - conceptually the client has still \nchecked with the server).\n\n\n"}}
