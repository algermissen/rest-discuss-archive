Lucas, why do your examples use\n&gt; &gt; 3? I would rather leave the POST body completely in the domain of the\n&gt; &gt; application because what if the application wants to pass XML or\n&gt; &gt; graphics as the body?\n&gt;\n\nAnd Mark said:\n&gt; Right.  #3 is a crude form of RPC, equivalent to #4 (and #5 if you think\n&gt; about it).\n\nThem&#39;s fightin words in these parts, Baker. ;)\n\nI used #3 with full knowledge of the other alternatives because this approach\nmodels asych comms as a _web app_.  If it&#39;s a web app then the arguments belong\nin the domain of the app, which is the POST body.\n\n\n&gt; But #2, with that header, isn&#39;t sufficient either.  I assume that you\n&gt; were trying to use my WATCH-as-PUT example where only an extension\n&gt; header was required?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; If so, the header there works quite differently\n&gt; than just &quot;Reply-To&quot;.\n\nExplain?\n\n\n&gt; I also prefer the new method.  A practical reason is that the meaning is\n&gt; more obvious, especially to most firewalls that permit blocking based\n&gt; on methods.  None I know of can follow a hypertext transaction to\n&gt; understand what you&#39;re really doing with GET, follow-header, PUT/POST,\n&gt; etc..  Though there&#39;s no reason that they can&#39;t, they don&#39;t.\n\nThis is the best reason not to do it as a web app -- that it requires a fairly\ncomplex combination of elements.  The counter argument is that REST says that we\nget less overall complexity by inventing new nouns and reusing existing verbs\nthan by inventing new verbs.\n\nPer firewalls, I leave it to them to keep up.  I am on the side of firewall\ntransgressors in this.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
