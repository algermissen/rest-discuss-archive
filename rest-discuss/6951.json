Ba-doomp.\n\n\nBut seriously, folks, here is a bit of practical wisdom I picked up by\ndoing the Webjay APIs, all two of them.  Developers prefer GET by a\nhuge margin, and any mashup API which uses other methods will barely\nget used.  That doesn&#39;t mean you have to go to non-idempotent GETs,\nthough.  What it means is that you have to try to model your API\naround idempotent interactions.\n\nFor example, if you have an input object which affects the\ninteraction, have the client pass its URI in a query argument and let\nthe request handler fetch the URI.  The end result is always something\nalong the lines of transforming a representation in some  useful way.\n\n"}}
