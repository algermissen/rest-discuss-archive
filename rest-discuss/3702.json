What I am looking for is a Java tool that will take \nin a WSDL with URL bindings and generate an easy to use interface \nobject to populate appropriate parameters in the http URI.\n\nThis object would provide methods \nlike &quot;getParameterList&quot;, &quot;getParameterType&quot;, &quot;setParmeter\n(parmname)&quot;, etc.  Eventually, I&#39;m looking at being able to resolve \nsemantic differences between the requestor&#39;s vocabulary and the \nservice provider vocabulary, but that&#39;s down the road.\n\nI am happy to write the class  if it doesn&#39;t already exist, but was \nwondering if there were any tools out there for this sort of thing?  \nSOAP seems to have them (it really needs them- otherwise no one \nwould use it), but the URL bindings option in WSDL does not seem to \nhave any tool support.\n\nHelp!  And does any of this make sense?\n\nLinda\n\n\n\n"}}
