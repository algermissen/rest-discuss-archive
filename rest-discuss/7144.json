How\n&gt; would you express the Stateless constraint as separation of\n&gt; concerns...without undue contrivance?\n\nStatelessness separates message semantics from server state.\n\n&gt; How about Cache?\n\nYou stumped me.  Come to think of it, even self-description in general\nisn&#39;t expressible as a separation of concerns, though some of the\nsubordinate constraints are (uniform interface, statelessness).  Oh\nwell, I think you have your answer, Jan. 8-)\n\nStill, the hypothesis had longer legs than I expected.  That might\nmake it useful as a tool for describing some aspects of software\narchitecture to those that aren&#39;t familiar with what&#39;s described in\nchapter 1 of Roy&#39;s dissertation, but are familiar with the concept of\n&quot;loose coupling&quot;.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
