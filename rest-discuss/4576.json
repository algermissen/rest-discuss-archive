Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For example:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   POST is used to create new resources\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   GET is used to retrieve a representation of a resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On their own they&#39;re RESTful,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, the POST invocation isn&#39;t RESTful by itself.  In the examples\n&gt; &gt; people have given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation\n&gt; &gt; will result in a resource being created (and furthermore, that this\n&gt; &gt; resource will have a particular relationship to the POSTed\n&gt; &gt; representation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Nonsense, Mark.  Of course that is REST -- it is right in the\n&gt; HTTP standard.  The client is *told* by the server the URI of\n&gt; the new resource.  The client doesn&#39;t need any other expectation than\n&gt; simply following HTTP.  This is no different from following application\n&gt; state as presented by links within representations.\n\nExactly what I was thinking. The client is not expecting anything except a\nvalid\nresponce which in this case happens to be a 201 and the client knows exactly\nwhat to do with it.\n\nAlso, HTTP 1.1 says\n&quot;The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in\nthe different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies\nthe resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a\ndata-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity\nthat accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the\nentity enclosed with the request&quot;\n- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6\n\nSo a data-accepting process CAN create a new resource as long as you model your\nresources while keeping the above difference between the different meanings of\nthe Request-URI in the POST and PUT requests in mind.\n\nSandeep\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
