As an example consider a subscriber that is interested to\n&gt; know when there is a\n&gt; POST to the MONITORED resource done by the remote user X.\n&gt; \n&gt; A way to implement that would be to let the subscriber specify a\n&gt; &#39;header pattern&#39; when\n&gt; invoking MONITOR.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone see a violation of REST in this approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
