The state\n&gt;  &gt; that is transferred back and force not only puts the client component(s)\n&gt;  &gt; in a certain state, it is also used to align the two running web apps.\n&gt;  &gt; That&#39;s mind blowing - need to chew on that one. Seems to bear\n&gt;  &gt; interesting possibilities regarding process alignment and from there on\n&gt;  &gt; to distributed transactions.\n&gt;\n&gt;  That&#39;s kind of what BizTalk servers do. I think most (all?) of the WS rm\n&gt;  specs assume both parties are peers/full-duplex - in http terms, both\n&gt;  sides have a client and a server. The challenge for deployed systems is\n&gt;  closing a transaction between a client and a server.\n\nWS-BPEL assumes both parties are peers but models each half of the\nprocess separately and cannot close transactions.\n\nWS-Choreography tries to model the whole process and started out\ntrying to use pi-calculus (stateless) but compromised in the end.  It\ncan close transactions.\n\nWS-TX (can&#39;t remember latest acronym) is all about distributed transactions.\n\nNone of them will work on the open Web.  They all require a lot of\nupfront configuration before any agents can communicate, and will\nbreak under change.\n\n"}}
