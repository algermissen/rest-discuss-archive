The\n&gt; functions f, g and h are all idempotent: they satisfy the constraint\n&gt;\n&gt;     fun(fun(x)) = fun(x) for all x mapped by fun (plug f, g and h in\n&gt; for &#39;fun&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt; The analyzer was asked to generate a counterexample to the claim that\n&gt; there is no x such that f(g(h(f(g(h(x))))))) = f(g(h(x))), and it\n&gt; found one.  The reason it&#39;s not intuitive is that we need at least 6\n&gt; nodes for this condition to occur.\n\nFascinating! Good stuff ...\n\nThat said, this doesn&#39;t actually settle the issue. The problem is that \nGET, PUT and DELETE are more constrained than f, g and h in your model. \nFor example, a function modelling GET should never generate a state \ntransition ... and all of the fn&#39;s in your counter-example violate that \nconstraint.\n\nPUT and DELETE are, I think, also more constrained, in that,\n\n  PUT /foo\n  DELETE /foo\n\nis equivalent to,\n\n  DELETE /foo\n\nand,\n\n  DELETE /foo\n  PUT /foo\n\nis equivalent to,\n\n  PUT /foo\n\nand again, all of the fn&#39;s in your counter-example violate those \nconstraints too.\n\nAll three of these constraints played an essential role in my proof, so \nit&#39;d help either if you could produce a new model which respects them, \nor if we could provide a rationale for why it&#39;s OK to violate them.\n\nBTW, is Alloy publicly available? Having seen the results I&#39;d be \ninterested in playing with it.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
