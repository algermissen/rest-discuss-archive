This way a component could be a servlet.\n&gt; Components are also decoupled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n\nUsing REST as a model for apps on the system is an idea that goes\nback quite a bit; you’re not the first to whom this occurs, and\nit seems quite reasonable.\n\nIn fact, the core ideas of Unix have a lot of constraints in\ncommon with the REST style (a uniform interface, addressability,\netc). Unix doesn’t go as far though, and if you go a bit further\nyou stumble into all manner of departures from the “everything is\na file” concept like like processes and terminals and ioctls and\nvarious kinds of flatfile databases and oh god it’s a tangled\nmess.\n\nThat is in part because of a failure of imagination at the time;\nthe original designers just didn’t see how to fit many of the\nodd-shaped things into the file system. The qmail approach to\nconfiguration is an example of how they could have decomposed\nmore of the system in terms of files.\n\nSo then they made another go in attempt to stick to a radically\nconservative approach to fix this mess, and what came out of that\neffort is now known as Plan 9. And that does indeed work out much\nmore nicely. Pity it never really caught on.\n\n&gt; Any experience ?\n\nI don’t think anyone has used specifically a REST-based\narchitecture to build applications or an operating system.\n\nBut, as per above, we do have positive experience with systems\nbuilt to honour *some* of its constraints, and they show that\nstricter adherence yields better results.\n\nSo the idea of using REST as a style for more than just web apps\nis certainly not absurd.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
