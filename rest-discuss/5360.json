An example of doing it with HTTP: the \nAccept request header and Content-type response header.  An example of \ndoing it with hypertext: a host returns an HTML form for a client to \nfill in.\n\nA big part of the benefit is that RESTful interactions should be \nself-documenting.  HTTP URIs are opaque by definition, so when you move \nthe interaction into the URI the interaction is hidden within the URI.\n\nWhat caught my eye about this hack is that an RFC 2397 URI is \nself-documenting in the sense that it includes a lot of the stuff you&#39;d \nnormally get in HTTP headers, like content type and character set.  As \nJoin points out, an RFC 2397 URI is not a network protocol, though, so \nthat&#39;s why I&#39;m piggybacking RFC 2397 URIs on HTTP URIs.\n\nThere are plenty of good arguments against my idea!  The reason why I&#39;m \nthinking about it anyway is that people want to make hrefs carry more of \nthe API workload for good reasons, so there is continuing pressure to \ncome up with solutions.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
