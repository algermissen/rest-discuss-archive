Whether these others are standardized or \nnot is\n&gt; orthogonal to whether they are primitive. At the very least,\n&gt; notification should be standardized. \n\nI think Web business conversation patterns will become standardized, \ntoo.  Certainly built on top of request-response, probably \nnotification, I think much like the Offer-Acceptance whatchamacallit \nwe discussed on this list.\n\nSupply chain change propagation, which we discussed more recently, \ncould be just a hyperlinked chain of Offer-Acceptance conversations, \nwhere accepted changes get propagated to dependent links.\n\nIn other words, I think REST is a good base for complex MEPs.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
