Beyond that, I&#39;ve been doing web based stuff \nfor years and haven&#39;t felt a recent need for a new abbreviation, just \nbecause some hard light is being shone on SOA and WS over and above the \nusual suspects (most of whom are subscribed here). &quot;WOA&quot; is so like, \ntrite, I didn&#39;t think anything would seriously suggest using it. \n&quot;Web-based&quot;, &quot;Webarch&quot; and &quot;REST&quot; are fine.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
