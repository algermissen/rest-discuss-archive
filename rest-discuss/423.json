There&#39;s no reason\n&gt; whatsoever why SMTP as a protocol is better than HTTP as a protocol for this purpose;  the primary\n&gt; advantage is that SMTP servers already understand routing and store-and-forward and have\n&gt; infrastructure in place to support this.\n\nIt comes down to the fact that SMTP also specifies\nretry and relay behavior.  That each handoff is\nsynchronous is irrelevant.\n\nThe upshot is that SMTP allows endpoints to\ncommunicate that are NEVER online at the same time\n\nIf you want to use HTTP for handoffs instead of\nSMTP.  You need to specify retry and relay\nbehavior and define a notion of desination address\ndistinct from the relay agent URL.  In other words\nyou need to define a protocol that rides on top of\nHTTP in the same way that HTTP rides on top of\nTCP/IP.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
