If you say */* you get anything back.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once you have the content from the server you do need to follow the  \n&gt; strict definition.  Consider media-types like jpeg or png.  There  \n&gt; isn&#39;t much wiggle room when interpreting these.  I believe the same  \n&gt; applies to xml, xhtml, atom+xml, atomsvc+xml, etc. as well.\n&gt;\n\nUmm...but that means I can only implement a client for the service  \nwhen the service already exists. This would make it impossible to  \ndiscover services at runtime or to replace existing services. In both  \ncases, the client could only be implemented by inspecting the service.\n\nMight be sufficient on the Web, yes.

But how did you know that it makes sense to write code that\n&gt; looks for the rel=&quot;next&quot; in the first place? Or: how did you know it\n&gt; makes sense to expect that the response would be available in\n&gt; application/atom+xml?\n&gt;\n&gt; As a human, you do the GET, see what is returned and if you understand\n&gt; it. Then, if you do, you know what you can do next. All fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; When coding a client, however, you need to know at design time that it\n&gt; makes sense to expect application/atom+xml to be returned. There might\n&gt; be other possible media types available, too, but you need some source\n&gt; of information that is the source for this expectation.\n&gt;\n&gt; AtomPub, for example, does state that collections are available as\n&gt; application/atom+xml feed documents. And it needs to do so because\n&gt; otherwise, building a client would not be possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; AtomPub cannot make that statement without using the term &#39;collection&#39;\n&gt; and specifying how a client knows that a resource is a (sic!!)\n&gt; collection[1]. An AtomPub collection is a resource kind (or class or\n&gt; category or role type or type or whatever you name it).\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] And it does so (more or less implicitly) by saying that whatever\n&gt; URIs you find in the href attributes of a service document&#39;s\n&gt; collection elements refers to collections. When I see\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;collection href=&quot;http://foo/orders&quot;&gt; I know a bunch of things about\n&gt; the resource identfied by http://foo/orders. E.g. I know that a GET on\n&gt; it will return an Atom feed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
