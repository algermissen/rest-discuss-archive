I was arguing against a claim that simply is not\ntrue about REST.\n\n&gt; Here is an example to clarify this distinction.\n&gt; The choice is between\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) CookieBank uses cookies or auth to provide\n&gt; access to a customer payment at URL:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://CookieBank.com/accounts/payments/12\n\nThat is not a likely scenario.  Applications working within an\naccount context will typically use a company-unique payment ID or\none that is account-specific.  A more realistic example is the &quot;top&quot;\npage, which is often made account-generic specifically because\nthe company wants customers to bookmark a single URI for the\ninitial access point.  It is not identified with an account\nnumber because the user is going to choose from their accounts\nafter visiting that page.\n\n&gt; (2) RestBank tops CookieBank by making URIs for\n&gt; specific payments visible in the &quot;Location&quot; bar\n&gt; so users can forward them to others:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://RestBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12\n\nThe purpose would be for auditing, not sharing transactions.\n\n&gt; My opinion:\n&gt;\n&gt; REST and Authentication are orthogonal, but that\n&gt; people frequently abuse authentication to make it\n&gt; unrestful.  So, RESTAuthenticateBank is RESTful,\n&gt; but CookieBank is not.\n\nAuthentication is orthogonal.  Cookies are also orthogonal when\nthey are simply used for content negotiation or authentication.\nHowever, Cookie authentication is not allowed in REST because it\nlacks visibility, which causes security problems because the other\ncomponents don&#39;t know it is sensitive information.\n\nIf the semantics of the request is determined by the contents of\nauthentication or cookies, then that in non-RESTful.  All of the\nexamples I used were requests with the semantics determined entirely\nby the URI and only the response content determined by the request\nmetadata. That is why the exchange remains RESTful, because the URI\nis universally applicable (means the same thing) for other users\neven though the content exchanged will be user-specific.  Likewise,\na user-specific URI that is access-controlled for a single user\nis universally applicable even if the rest of the universe is denied\naccess -- the semantics are clear from the request method and URI.\n\n&gt; CookieBank WOULD be restful if it sent a\n&gt; content-location header that specified the URI of\n&gt; the underlying resource.\n\nNo, content-location was an attempt to set the base URI for\nembedded relative URIs, but it has not been implemented sufficiently\nto make it useful for even that purpose.  It cannot be used to\ncompensate for multi-semantic URIs, such as a single URI being\nused for many different types of request via POST, because\nvisibility of those actions must occur in the request (prior\nto the response being generated).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
