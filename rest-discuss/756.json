It is consequently simpler.\n&gt;\n&gt; It has first-class concepts of &quot;resource&quot;, &quot;representation&quot;, &quot;method&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;. Methods are HTTP methods like PUT, GET, DELETE,\n&gt; YOURMETHOD. Inputs are like HTTP method inputs: headers, query params\n&gt; and body (the URI is implied by the resource!). Outputs are like HTTP\n&gt; outputs: status code, headers and body. Resources know what\n&gt; representations they support and you can navigate from resource to\n&gt; resource through hyperlinks without worrying about the XML or HTML\n&gt; syntax of the representation (unless you want to). Following a hyperlink\n&gt; is a type-safe operation.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s about all the concepts in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; A rough proposal for an API (Java-ish syntax to prove it isn&#39;t biased\n&gt; towards dynamic languages) is provided. Everything is statically type\n&gt; checked just as with IDL or WSDL. Of course in Python everything would\n&gt; be done at runtime and thus save a build step.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I implement it I think it will be a really cool tool. Until then, I\n&gt; think it is a useful pedagogic tool for those working on REST Zen. If\n&gt; *you* want to implement it before I get around to it, in whatever\n&gt; language, please do. I&#39;ll work with you to clear up any fuzzy parts of\n&gt; the spec.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
