Database access/manipulation IMHO is something\n&gt; that should definately live behind a facade. I would generally prefer to not\n&gt; even expose dataaccess routines to the outside world but wrap those up in\n&gt; something that communicates what the data is doing. Without doing a REST\n&gt; example, because I don&#39;t understand it yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would do something like employee.create, or update etc...This is commonly\n&gt; termed as the CRUD approach. In REST would this be something like the\n&gt; following?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://somehost.com/employee/create?id=12345\n&gt; http://somehost.com/employee/update?id=12345\n&gt;\n&gt; Then on the server side there would be a create, update method on the\n&gt; employee that takes an id parameter?\n\nHey Holden,\n\nThe REST answer to CRUD is that employee.create should not be exposed in a\nbroadly distributed setting because it is a method as opposed to a\nresource.  So http://somehost.com/employee/create?id=12345 should be,\ninstead,\n\nPOST http://somehost.com/new_employees\n(get back an ID, and then do...)\n\nPOST http://somehost.com/employees/$ID?department=accounting\n\nSo you wouldn&#39;t expose data access routines to the outside world, but you\nwould expose data access resources.  Then you just control access to the\ndata access resources using standard HTTP access control.  The net effect\nis precisely to wrap up the SQL in something that controls access, a.k.a.\nby exposing a public representatation of a private resource.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
