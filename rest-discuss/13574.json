All webservers have  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;    defaults semantics built in when a link is requested that is no\n&gt;&gt;    longer exists it returns a 404.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    If a service is much more robust, accessing a dead link would\n&gt;&gt;    redirect it to something meaningful, maybe a the &quot;top&quot; of the  \n&gt;&gt; app or\n&gt;&gt;    the &quot;top&quot; of the entity.  This is optional and requires some more\n&gt;&gt;    thought in how you implement your service but may be worth its\n&gt;&gt;    weight in gold when you need to upgrade.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    It is worth exploring more, in my opinion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    -Noah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    On Mon, Sep 28, 2009 at 6:33 PM, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...\n&gt;&gt;    &lt;mailto:willh@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        On Sat, Sep 26, 2009 at 4:00 PM, Noah Campbell\n&gt;&gt;        &lt;noahcampbell@... &lt;mailto:noahcampbell@...&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think for entities it&#39;s fine, especially if you want to\n&gt;&gt;        leverage caching\n&gt;&gt;&gt; middleware.

Whether that link\n&gt;&gt;        is 10ms\n&gt;&gt;        or 10years old, the client behavior is the same: a bad link  \n&gt;&gt; is a bad\n&gt;&gt;        link is a bad link.
