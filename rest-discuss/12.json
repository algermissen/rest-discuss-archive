I&#39;m guessing it\n&gt; &gt; is all about user interface issues -- being able to put the login\n&gt; &gt; box where-ever you want it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly right.  This is a major issue, as it prevents many tasks\n&gt; from being automated.\n\nI think the issue is more that publishers don&#39;t have much control\nover the authentication state on the browser; things like remembering\nthe username between sessions, logging out, etc. weren&#39;t addressable\nuntil IE and later Mozilla introduced password management interfaces.\nThey&#39;re still less capable than cookie handling, unfortunately.\n\nAlso, it was drilled into eveyone&#39;s heads that Basic authentication\nisn&#39;t secure. Some people thought that magically using cookies would\nsolve this, whilst the more savvy used encrypted or hashed values in\ncookies. There is Digest authentication, but it was plagued with\nspecification and implementation problems, IIRC.\n\n\n&gt; - conventions for cookie values.  would also be difficult to rollout\n&gt; as HTTP libs that support cookies would all need fixing.\n\nWhat kind of conventions? It strikes me that defining conventions for\ncookies is about as friendly as defining conventions for URIs like\nwell-known locations...\n\n\n&gt; - recognizing forms with two fields where one is a password input type,\n&gt; and somehow kludging that knowledge into the auth system.  easier to\n&gt; rollout, but error prone and not sure how the kludge would work\n\nI believe this is what Mozilla and IE do now. Of course, the auth is\nstill sent as a cookie.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
