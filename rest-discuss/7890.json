Different \nuse cases require different libraries and APIs, even when they&#39;re doing \nroughly the same thing, just at different scales.\n\nThe JDK needs a solid client side HTTP API, one that&#39;s better than \njava.net.URL. This library should be optimized and designed for simple \nuse cases, and be adequate up to about the use a web browser or Atom \nclient would put it to.\n\nIf you&#39;re building a network proxy server or a multimillion feed \naggregator such as Bloglines, you need a different HTTP library to suit \nyour needs. I do not think this use case is common enough to justify \nbundling such a thing with the JDK. Nor do I think we should try to make \none library serve both ends of the spectrum.\n\nI suspect server side libraries should be limited to JEE and kept out of \nJSE in general. Not everything needs to be bundled with the JDK in order \nto be useful.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
