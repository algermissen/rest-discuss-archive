Suppose the\n&gt;&gt; application is to index a bunch of web sites then the intended server\n&gt;&gt; side component type is something like &#39;any&#39;.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It is, I think, also reasonable to ask whether there is some sort of\n&gt;&gt; primary application for a given server component that defines its\n&gt; type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Type is an illusion. Bunchtype doubly so.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s difficult for &#39;types&#39; based on goals to &quot;come into being&quot; since\n&gt; they do not, in fact, exist. Clients may perceive that they do exist,\n&gt; until Amazon morphs from an online book seller to an online marketplace\n&gt; for everything to an online rating system to an online community forum\n&gt; without ever flipping its &#39;type&#39; bit from one state to another. Servers\n&gt; may believe that they exist, until a client tracks updates to a bunch of\n&gt; books instead of buying them.\n&gt; \n&gt; A goal is not merely the recognition of a domain, or even a range.\n&gt; &quot;These apples are red&quot; does not define a goal. &quot;I will buy red apples&quot;\n&gt; does, because it marks off the limits of an activity (purchasing) based\n&gt; on the range of a domain (red apples). Domain boundaries that have no\n&gt; relationship to activities are uninteresting; the set of red apples on\n&gt; its own is boring.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;primary application&quot; could be defined as the set of state\n&gt; transition paths which the server developers desire most. But the degree\n&gt; to which clients actually follow those desired paths varies widely, and\n&gt; then the representations vary widely, and then the states and paths\n&gt; themselves vary widely, as the business changes. RESTful systems support\n&gt; this. Types and goals are merely momentary, mutable marketing.\n\nVery well said! Like that a lot.
