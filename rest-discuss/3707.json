The point about syntax is appreciated. In \nfact I&#39;d tried (probably mistakenly and ham fistedly) to simplify the \nissue when posting... The real interface uses Children, Siblings, and \nParents as means of traversing the graph. Within the domain I&#39;m \nconcerned with such nouns can have various meanings and can end up \nconfusing matters. Nonetheless, they seem to be appropriate in this \ncase. It nice to have my thinking confirmed.\n\nWith respect to the elimination of Location elements, I agree that \nthe ideal would be to remove them. For historical reasons they serve \nmore than one purpose at present. However, pragmatism and time \nconstraints mean that I&#39;ll maintain them for now, possibly splitting \nthe geometric information from the links at a later date.

If\n&gt; users\n&gt; have a mental model of these maps, then I see nothing wrong with \nexposing\n&gt; them in\n&gt; all their bizarre containment glory through a REST interface.  Even \nif they\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; start out with that mental model, it&#39;s valid to introduce it as an \naccess\n&gt; paradigm\n&gt; to aid the client in expressing intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; The one quibble I have with Richard&#39;s proposal is mainly syntactic.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;http://bionformatics/Maps/Map/123  - would return a list of Maps \nthat\n&gt; &gt;contain http://bioinformatics/Map/123.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think more in terms of http://bionformatics/Map/123/Parents\n&gt; (or some other suitable noun in place of &quot;Parents&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;http://bioinformatics/Mappables/Map/1 - would return a list of all\n&gt; &gt;the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1\n&gt; \n&gt; And the corresponding http://bionformatics/Map/1/Children\n&gt; (or some such suitable noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, the conceptual hierarchy and the names used in it\n&gt; can include inversions of the normalized view of the space, and \nthere&#39;s\n&gt; no law against having multiple names for the same resource, either.\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Narayan D. Iyengar\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com ; gattaca15pcr\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 13, 2003 10:37 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Nesting containers to a depth of ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Richard\n&gt; \n&gt; My comments are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The presence of location elements (that represent a specific \nschema\n&gt; design) in the web pages implies knowledge of implementation \ndetails, which\n&gt; goes against the grain of REST-ful architectures. Hence, to \neliminate this,\n&gt; each web page should only contain (apart from other static, \nformatting and\n&gt; similar content) URIs to Resources. When you &quot;click&quot; on a URI, \nthat &quot;opens&quot;\n&gt; another web page containing yet some more links, and so on. How the \nweb page\n&gt; is generated and how it obtains access to the resources should be \ncompletely\n&gt; hidden from the &quot;users&quot;. Thus, details of your schema or interfaces \nshould\n&gt; not appear in your page design.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Given this, you may probably want to refactor your code so that \nthe\n&gt; implementation details are moved out of the REST-ful &quot;pages&quot; (that \nrepresent\n&gt; the web service you are making available).\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this make sense, or am I missing the point?\n&gt; \n&gt; Narayan Iyengar\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: gattaca15pcr\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 12, 2003 10:25 AM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Nesting containers to a depth of ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone give me some advice on the following...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m attempting to define REST-style interface for a system \ndelivering\n&gt; genomic map data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Central to my design is the possibility of maps nesting one within\n&gt; the other. Thus a map is, potentially, a composite of other maps.\n&gt; Furthermore there may be many levels of nesting.  My question is, \nhow\n&gt; can traversal up an down this hierarchy be carried out in a REST-ful\n&gt; manner? To illustrate:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://bioinformatics/Map - returns details list of all maps\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Maps&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;label&gt;Chromosome 1&lt;/label&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;locations\n&gt; href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/Map&gt;\n&gt;       ... thousands of Map nodes ...\n&gt;       &lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;label&gt;Chromosome Z&lt;/label&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;locations\n&gt; href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/Map&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/Maps&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://bioinformatics/Map/123 - returns a specific map\n&gt; &lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;label&gt;Clone Z&lt;/label&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;locations href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123/Location&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/Map&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s suppose that http://bioinformatics/Map/1 contains other maps\n&gt; (e.g. http://bioinformatics/Map/123). At present the way to retrieve\n&gt; a list of the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1 is to\n&gt; issue a GET to http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location. This returns a\n&gt; list of positional Locations on the map (i.e coordinates). Embedded\n&gt; within these locations are links to the parent map and the mappable\n&gt; (i.e. the Map located at this position):\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Locations&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Location href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&gt;             ....\n&gt;       &lt;Location&gt;\n&gt;       .... thousands of Location nodes ...\n&gt;       &lt;Location href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location/10&quot;&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;position&gt;0.2&lt;/position&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;mappable href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/Location&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/Locations&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Using the links provided in a Location node it should be possible to\n&gt; traverse the graph of Maps.\n&gt; \n&gt; To my mind this is consistent with the REST-ful idea of gradually\n&gt; revealing data. Applications wishing to use the data should \ncertainly\n&gt; be relatively simple to write and the consistency of the interface\n&gt; appeals to me. However, this scheme has the disadvantage of,\n&gt; potentially, requiring many GET requests to traverse the graph. This\n&gt; is mainly because the &#39;hierarchy&#39; is not a simple tree or forest - a\n&gt; map be contained by more than one map. While mutliple GET&#39;s \nshouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be an issue for any client keeping a connection to the server open,\n&gt; I&#39;d like to avoid any such requirement. Thus, I&#39;d like to extend the\n&gt; interface such that it is possible to traverse the graph of Maps,\n&gt; bypassing the intermediate step of accessing Locations (the Location\n&gt; data may not be of much interest to a client in any case). Is there\n&gt; any sensible way to represent such a traversal? So far I&#39;ve thought\n&gt; of defining two new resources, Maps ( = Containers) and Mappables ( \n=\n&gt; Contents), to make such traversal possible. By specifying in the URI\n&gt; the resource to which movement should be relative, traversal up or\n&gt; down the hierarchy should be possible. For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://bionformatics/Maps/Map/123  - would return a list of Maps \nthat\n&gt; contain http://bioinformatics/Map/123.\n&gt; \n&gt; and\n&gt; \n&gt; http://bioinformatics/Mappables/Map/1 - would return a list of all\n&gt; the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Does this scheme make sense? Although it seems distinctly un-REST\n&gt; like, it does allow me to do what I want to do. Mmmm... should I \neven\n&gt; want to do what I want to do?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Richard\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
