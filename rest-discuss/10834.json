I thought the\n&gt; definition of CSRF was that scripting was involved.\n\nNot neccessarily, you can trick people into submitting normal forms. E.g. you can have a search form which doesn&#39;t do a search though but submits hidden fields to the target site (with the actual search field that the user can see not even being part of that form). Or a picture which the user would click on which is a submit for a form though.\n\nRegards,\nSimon \n\n"}}
