Certainly Roy&#39;s thesis is the final word on\n&gt; &gt; REST but it is not approachable for most, and it is definitely not a REST\n&gt; &gt; cookbook that explains how to handle various use-cases. Further, I believe\n&gt; &gt; a cookbook is what ~99% of people need to successfully implement an\n&gt; &gt; architecture style (and I am one of these 99%.) But the cookbook would\n&gt; &gt; need to be authoritative.\n&gt;\n&gt; I disagree a bit. I think we need a bunch more RESTfull frameworks out\n&gt; there.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hate frameworks but they&#39;re what people seem to want to use to write\n&gt; code.\n\nWhen you say that you disagree - do you mean that you think that the\nuse-case / cookbook approach is without merit or is in conflict with\nframework development?\n\nPersonally I think that the two can co-exist and, in the best case,\nimprove each other but I would like to understand the basis of your\ndisagreement.\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
