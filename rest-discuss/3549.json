This seems to preclude\nthe use of cookies in this context.\n\nAnother popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication\nmechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\nuser agents give application designers over the standard http\nauthorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\nprompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\nissues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n\n\n\n"}}
