It must act as a RESTful client to t=\r\nhe backend RESTful service. Otherwise you would be in portal-land....\n\nOk. =\r\nSorry. I thought you were talking about a user facing form. Not a form on t=\r\nhe REST API. That makes sense.\n\nI assume you discover the form at runtime, =\r\nnot designtime. Right? But you have to know at designtime that &lt;input name=\r\n=3D&quot;itemname&quot;/&gt; is the input you want to put the item&#39;s name in. Right? Tha=\r\nt&#39;s great - we have to know something about the parameters at designtime, b=\r\nut we avoid knowing anything about URLs until runtime.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Check the &quot;sel=\r\nf&quot; links. The resource format is not the same for the two items. So I canno=\r\nt just grab the ID and render HTML anchors with them since the &quot;commodere 6=\r\n4&quot; link would be wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then the &#39;form&#39; that the backend gave to the s=\r\nervice is simply wrong. In your example, there are two different constructi=\r\non rules (forms) for different context. Why would you do that? Why not just=\r\n one form? The server can sort out the old vs new stuff behind the interfac=\r\ne.\n\nThe server can only sort out the old vs. new stuff if it somehow encode=\r\ns new/old in the ID. Could be &quot;old1234&quot; vs. &quot;new1234&quot;. That works. But you =\r\nare starting to invent your own URI format ... that would not be necessary =\r\nif you simply included the whole resource URL.\n\n&gt; You&#39;d just have the fron =\r\nWeb app that exposes a RESTful API. It would then interact RESTfully with a=\r\n RESTful backend. It is simply &#39;wrong&#39; to relate the URIs of the backend in=\r\n any way to the URIs of the forntend. You do not even have to make use of t=\r\nhe same IDs as long as the frontend service keeps its own mapping table.\n\nB=\r\nut the whole point is to build a database-less website that completely depe=\r\nnds on a REST API for it to work. There is no &quot;state&quot; in the website, no pl=\r\nace to save that mapping table. That&#39;s the path I am exploring. By doing so=\r\n my website will be open by design instead of adding REST APIs as an aftert=\r\nhought. It will be possibe to write a new .NET/Java client without changing=\r\n a single line of code in the website. Instead of building the REST API on =\r\ntop of the website, I want to build my clients on top of the API - and by c=\r\nlient I mean both HTML, .NET and Java.\n\nAnyway, I think I have used up my a=\r\nmount of time from you guys on this. Thanks a lot. It has been interesting.=\r\n You are of course welcome to reply, but there is no expectation on it on m=\r\ny part.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
