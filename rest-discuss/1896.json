This is an important point and I\nmyself didn&#39;t realize it for a long time. The resource is identifed by\npath+query - not just the &#39;path&#39;. Appending a query string onto a path\nidentifies a /different/ resource. There are many more resources than you\nwould think at first.\n\nThe query string (after the &#39;?&#39; character) is a part of the whole resource\nidentifier. It happens to be a part that is easy to describe to developers\nwhen they want to construct the full identifier. If you can&#39;t construct the\nidentifier, you have to harvest it from some sort of XML (or other media\nformat) and that is just as complex as telling people how to construct the\ndarn URI in the first place...\n\nAnyway... both formats are equally fine, but the query string approach is\neasier to document.\n\n\n\n"}}
