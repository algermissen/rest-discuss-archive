For my money, once you can \nreliably transfer documents using client-server HTTP, a considerable \nnumber of unneccesary WS specs can be canned.\n\n\n&gt; For example, what do you mean by &quot;reliable delivery exchange&quot;?\n\nOnce and only once delivery, on a pure client-server HTTP model, no \nextensions a la WebDAV/HTTPR, based on the five packet handshake \nprotocol (parties exchange a token to begin with), state inspectable \n  by third parties.\n\nBut truthfully, in a commercial setting, I mean this - if it doesn&#39;t \nget from A to B, just once, my ass is on the line. The purpose of \nthe protocol is to fulfil a business need at a low cost. Most of the \ncustomers I work with are concerned about being locked-in to magic \nblack boxes, so opening the protocol is important in that respect.\n\nPaul Prescod wrote up a great one pager on this a few years back on \na model where the client and server exchange a URI token, and a lot \nof my understanding on what you can and can&#39;t do regarding reliable \ncommunications on the Internet came from Miles Sabin. I think you \nneed a wee bit more than Paul outlined, but a hell of a lot less \nthan any of the reliable-over-HTTP protocols I&#39;ve seen.\n\nIt&#39;s not baked yet, the main issues are what resource the URI token \nnames (I think it&#39;s the exchange and not the message) and the \nPUT/DELETE debacle (well, I think it&#39;s a debacle :)\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n"}}
