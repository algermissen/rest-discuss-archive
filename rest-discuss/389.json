It&#39;s not a\n&gt; shooting gallery.  I&#39;m not selling insurance.\n\nI&#39;m not sure.  Think about it. ;-)\n\n&gt; I spent a couple days analyzing a\n&gt; big problem created by the standard model (the problem being that using\n&gt; callbacks to post event notifications opens large security holes) and proposed a\n&gt; simple solution.  It does no good to say that large security problems don&#39;t\n&gt; matter -- they do -- or to snipe at implications like reverse firewall traversal\n&gt; which (1) are based on incorrect understanding and (2) I didn&#39;t make.\n\nHey, man, we&#39;re on the same side.  I&#39;m just trying to let you know that the logical\nconclusion of the path you&#39;re currently exploring is a dead-end --- seriously, I&#39;m\njust trying to save you some frustration.  You&#39;ve thought about these issues for\nwhat, a few days?  I spent about three years struggling through *specifically* all\nof this, several years ago, and it seriously cost me some hair.\n\nI&#39;m not sniping at implications like reverse firewall traversal --- I&#39;m pointing out\na *fundamental problem* with the introduction of any new protocol on any new port\nthat is intended to touch edge machines.  It doesn&#39;t make sense to run HTTP 0.9 /\nPSP on port 80, of course, therefore the implication in your PSP suggestion is that\nyou are introducing a new protocol on a new port.  That ain&#39;t gonna work, bro.  :-)\nTrust me on this one.\n\nRegardless of which port it runs on, you&#39;ve expressed an interest in allowing\nclients to receive notifications.  This *implies* that whatever solution you have\nneeds to cross firewalls.  Since PSP doesn&#39;t run on port 80, this means you assume\nyou&#39;re going to go out and convince all the network admins of the world to open up\nyour PSP port to allow for inbound traffic on your innocuous protocol.  Even if it\ndid run on port 80, you&#39;ve still got to convince them to allow inbound to all your\nedge machines.  Well, that just isn&#39;t going to happen.  You&#39;re designing a solution\nthat cannot be deployed in the environment into which it needs to be deployed.\n\nI&#39;m on your side, but I don&#39;t think *you&#39;ve* thought through the practical\nimplications of what you&#39;re proposing.  It may be a nice, elegant solution to a\nproblem, but an elegant solution that can&#39;t be deployed isn&#39;t very useful.  And it\nmay not be the only or most elegant solution.\n\n$0.02, and peace,\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
