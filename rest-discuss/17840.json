It represents a snapshot of the clients narrow view of the world as i=\r\nt navigates around. With each requests, a small subset of the overall serve=\r\nr state is viewed and certain transitions to other application states are o=\r\nffered. For example, it might be a page with a list of 25 mailing list post=\r\ns. It may have links labelled with relations like &quot;next&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; or =\r\na way to POST a new submission to be added to the collection. The current r=\r\nepresentation being processed reflects the server&#39;s communication about its=\r\n resource state at a moment in time when the server answered a request for =\r\na resource in whatever media type.\n\nWhile you are staring at a list of item=\r\ns on the screen of your browser, someone else may have posted a new mail to=\r\n the list. Or the site&#39;s owner may have redacted an email because it was sp=\r\nam. Or changed a configuration setting such as the default number of items =\r\nshown on a page or a banner message or ad image. These are changes to resou=\r\nrce state. They affect how the server might produce a representation for a =\r\nfuture request.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dan&quot; &lt;dan@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; In (a follow-on comment to his own) blog post [1], Roy stated:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nDon&#39;t confuse application state (the state of the user&#39;s application of com=\r\nputing to a given task) with resource state (the state of the world as expo=\r\nsed by a given service). They are not the same thing.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
