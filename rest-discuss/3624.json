The\naudience was of mixed ability, from old time hackers to complete\nnewbies in web development.\n\nHere is a very short summary of audience reaction and my thoughts\nabout it. I hope it&#39;s useful.\n\n\nThe reaction of most was to question whether I was talking about\nanything clever, to question the validity of REST because of it&#39;s\nsimplicity. The more experience programmers (who have topyed with\nSOAP and XMLRPC) were more enthusisatic.\n\n\nIt&#39;s clear that many people don&#39;t really understand HTTP. REST\nevangelists need to do more to explain HTTP to people.\n\n\nI expected some confusion and incredulity about the stuff about\nsessions and I got some. Again, the more experienced were more\ninclined to listen to the REST p-o-v. But the prevaliing view about\nsessions was &quot;go tell the marketing dept&quot; because this company does\nquite a lot of personalization based on cookies.\n\n\nSo, in summary, the talk was pretty succesful. My only doubt is how\nmuch I should push the sessions issue. I&#39;m still not clear myself\nabout that.\n\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n\n"}}
