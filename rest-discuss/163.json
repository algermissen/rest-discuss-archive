A notification is a\nmessage that something has changed. Nothing more, nothing less. In\ngeneral, there is no request/response pair. When a message comes through\nan EDI backchannel that a stock price (or temperature) has changed, that\nis reflected in a series of notifications being sent. There is no\nrequest/response pair to echo. \n\nIf this particular application thought that the details of the EDI\nmessage were important, then I guess that information could be sent in\nthe BODY of the response. Similarly, if you feel strongly that\nrequest/response pairs should be sent to your clients then you could do\nthat in a particular application. But I claim that the only\nresponsibility of the underlying engine is to report that the resource\nhas been changed or deleted.\n\nBut in my mind, the logical model is just: &quot;That resource you asked\nabout changed or disappeared.&quot; What caused the change is, in general,\nnot the business of the watchers and will more often than not be through\nnon-HTTP means anyhow.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
