It would also be\n&gt; important for the client t=\r\no understand any input options/requirements,\n&gt; too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think some usefu=\r\nl bots or appliance-type applications can be built\n&gt; in this way, esp. sinc=\r\ne the REST constraints greatly simplify the\n&gt; details of machine-to-machine=\r\n interaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n\nAnother approach that I=\r\n really think merits investigation is CCXML&#39;s. It is an XML format for a st=\r\nate machine that processes call control events (call being offered, answer =\r\ncall, call hung up, etc.). A CCXML hypermedia processor interacts with the =\r\nunderlying platform via asynchronous events. Events it receives advance the=\r\n state machine. Event handlers processed on transitions send events back do=\r\nwn to the platform, run local javascript, or cause page transitions via GET=\r\n and POST.\n\nCCXML is completely machine driven -- no human guiding the proc=\r\nessing. But the hypermedia document tells the CCXML engine how map local ev=\r\nents into network requests. Those requests yeild other documents with anoth=\r\ner mapping.\n\nThis model isn&#39;t that different from an HTML browser when you =\r\nthink about it. The browser receives keyboard and mouse events (or higher l=\r\nevel events like &quot;onchange&quot;) and sends &quot;messages&quot; down to an underlying pla=\r\ntform to repaint the screen. Certain events cause a page transition to occu=\r\nr.\n\nMy point is that you don&#39;t need to &quot;replace the human&quot; if you look at h=\r\nypermedia document processing this way. You just need to map the informatio=\r\nn in the document to the client&#39;s domain model. That&#39;s what the &quot;semantic i=\r\nnfo&quot; is really doing -- but where people are having problems is that they o=\r\nnly map the information one way (down to the platform). For example, microf=\r\normats map the generic HTML tags to another domain model understood by cert=\r\nain clients. But they usually don&#39;t include a mapping from platform events =\r\nto actions/event handlers in the markup. Filling in this gap facilitates mu=\r\nch more sophisticated machine-driven processing.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
