A user-agent should perform the operation it was going to perform on \nweddings.com/san-digeo/2005/04/smith on weddings.com/2005/04/11/smith.\n2.

This 301 response can be cached indefinitely, since it&#39;s not going \nto change.\n2b. Any record of the URI weddings.com/san-digeo/2005/04/smith can be \nreplaced with a record of the URI weddings.com/2005/04/11/smith.\n\nWhich matches your description completely.\n\nSince there&#39;s no built-in way to determine or reason about the previous \nstates of resources, the difference between &quot;Moved Permanently&quot; because \nsomething did indeed move and between &quot;Moved Permanently&quot; because the \nURI was designed from the get-go to 301 is outside of what HTTP can do.\n\n301 can&#39;t indicate an invalid URI, because an invalid URI can&#39;t be \nparsed by a server (a 400 error can indicate an invalid error, though it \nshould have been caught by the client before then).\n\nNor does it indicate an outdated URI, though in some cases the URI is no \nlonger doing what it used to be doing, it&#39;s still doing something.\n\n\n"}}
