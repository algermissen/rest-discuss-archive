I felt it wasn&#39;t \n&gt; important to the security discussion, so I didn&#39;t want to \n&gt; create the noise.\n\nYes, but now we know it&#39;s not a security issue.\n\n&gt; That mapping you speak of is done by looking at the content.  The \n&gt; content of the PUT is RDF, and there is a Statement that \n&gt; tells me what \n&gt; type the RDF object is.  I can look at that to determine \n&gt; where to store \n&gt; this object.  The URI unfortunately doesn&#39;t tell me enough \n&gt; information \n&gt; to determine (and often infer) the type of the resource.\n\nI think you&#39;re carrying the opaqueness of URI too far.  As I understand,\nURI should be opaque *to clients*, but are allowed to be (and should be\nencouraged to be) meaningful for servers.  Else you&#39;re constrained to\n&quot;bag&quot; storage at the conceptual level, and that looks like your problem\nat this point.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not objecting to pushing data validation into the servlet \n&gt; container. \n&gt;   In fact, I think that&#39;s the only place I can do it.  \n\nYou read me wrong.  I said you objected to NOT being able to push\nvalidation all the way out.  Not knowing your application, it&#39;s not for\nme to say, except that pushing ALL validation out to the container\nleaves you what for an application?\n\n\n&gt; Here is an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://example.com/car - A car object that people can drive\n&gt; \n&gt; In the NON-REST world, if I wanted to drive it, I would do:\n&gt; \n&gt; car.drive(start, finish)\n\nCurious as to what that means.  To begin with, the car ought to know\nwhere it&#39;s starting from, i.e., where it is now, no?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But we all know and love REST, so I would do this in the REST world:\n\nNote the order above: KNOW comes before LOVE :-)\n\n&gt; In other words, I have to create a noun (an object/resource) that \n&gt; describes the action that I want to take place.  So instead \n&gt; of driving \n&gt; the car via drive(), I have to create (or PUT) a Trip.\n\nIn my most orthodox interpretation of Representational State Transfer,\nI believe you can accomplish your trip by PUTting a version of your\ncar whose current location is the destination you seek.  But we don&#39;t\nreally know what the purpose of Car is, so again we&#39;re kind of stuck\ngiving advice.\n\n&gt; Assuming I need to create a Trip, let&#39;s now talk about security.\n&gt; \n&gt; Person A can drive the car from Point P1 to Point P2.\n&gt; Person B can drive the car from Point P1 to Point P3.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, Person A can:\n&gt; \n&gt; server.create( new Trip(car, P1, P2) )\n&gt; \n&gt; And that should pass.  If Person A tries to:\n&gt; \n&gt; server.create( new Trip(car, P1, P3) )\n&gt; \n&gt; That should fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I&#39;m looking at data validation as a means to control access to \n&gt; the data.  REST is about information, not methods, so it \n&gt; makes sense I \n&gt; have to create a security framework that validates the data.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do the RESTphiles think of the above example?\n\nThe model seems broken because you can only drive the car from P1\nto P-something if the car is at P1.  As I process it, P2 is a resource\naccessible person A, while P3 is a resource not accessible to person A.\nSo if you modeled destinations as resources and make their URIs meaningful\nto the server, then you can &quot;push&quot; some of that validation out, it seems.\nBut I have low confidence yet that I understand your application.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you use POST to an &#39;object container&#39; URI and let the \n&gt; server assign \n&gt; &gt; URIs upon\n&gt; &gt; object creation, does that solve that part of the problem?  \n&gt; Note that \n&gt; \n&gt; That certainly does make it easier.  I&#39;m currently leaning \n&gt; towards the \n&gt; container idea and appending objects to it.  Makes \n&gt; controlling access to \n&gt; a resource a lot easier.  Still have to do data validation, \n&gt; though, but \n&gt; that&#39;s cool.\n\nYes, validation is cool.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
