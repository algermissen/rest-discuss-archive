It&#39;s true that, after ten years, there is still not\n&gt; much acces=\r\nsible material on this very important architectural style.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the p=\r\nroblems I see is that some very good scholarship on\n&gt; architectural styles =\r\nis bottled up behind IEEE and ACM pay walls. This\n&gt; makes it more difficult=\r\n to build a large collection of information\n&gt; from which others can easily =\r\ndraw.\n&gt;\n&gt; My own feeling is that, at this point in time, collecting as many=\r\n of\n&gt; the varied and disparate links, references, and examples as possible\n=\r\n&gt; and offering them in a targeted search would go a long way to exposing\n&gt; =\r\na general theme and common ground that has developed around Roy&#39;s\n&gt; initial=\r\n work over the years. That includes making rest-discuss and\n&gt; other email a=\r\nrchives (HTTP, etc.) searchable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think that many people active o=\r\nn this list are type to keep\n&gt; themselves quite busy.
