I&#39;ve since found many of your articles and I praised them in\nlater emails as the only ones that I had found that were clear to a\nREST-newbie.

One more thing; wouldn&#39;t you say that the Atom Feed Autodiscovery and\nthe OpenSearch, from a web services perspective, fairly trivial with\nessentially one operation each?  I mean they are not at the level of\nsomething like placing a purchase order or anything.\n\n\n"}}
