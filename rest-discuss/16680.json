Thanks.  MIME syntax could be ditched, but application/atom+xml\nwould still be a self-descriptive identifier by virtue of being in the\nIANA registry.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also can&#39;t square the reference to RFC 2048 with this statement:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;The problem is that I can&#39;t say &#39;REST requires media types to be\n&gt; &gt; registered&#39; because both Internet media types and the registry\n&gt; &gt; controlled by IANA are a specific architecture&#39;s instance of the\n&gt; &gt; style\n&gt; &gt; -- they could just as well be replaced by some other mechanism for\n&gt; &gt; metadata description.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\n&gt; \n&gt; you missed the start of the sentence ;) &quot;This is one of those gray\n&gt; areas of increasing RESTfulness that will doubtless drive some people\n&gt; nuts.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nOh, right!  I forgot that REST-the-style could be implemented via\ncarrier-pigeon network -- the color of the tube holding the payload\nindicates its spoken language (which is self-descriptive if it&#39;s\nspecced somewhere, what color maps to what language), striping could\nindicate encryption, while the color of the paper indicates script vs.\ncursive... specced properly, perfectly RESTful!\n\nBut, that does seem to indicate the wording of 5.2.1.2 is a bit off...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand that some other protocol may instantiate a different\n&gt; &gt; form of registry, but how does replacing Internet media types not\n&gt; &gt; go against the definition of data format in 5.2.1.2?  Should I be\n&gt; &gt; reading 5.2.1.2 as &quot;most commonly known as a media type,&quot; i.e. as\n&gt; &gt; an example and not as a definition?  In which case, should &#39;media\n&gt; &gt; type&#39; be read as &#39;data type&#39; elsewhere in 5.2.1.2?\n&gt; \n&gt; If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then what good does it do? your protocol and\n&gt; the messages sent would be incompatible with the entire deployed\n&gt; stack of everything we have on the Internet/Web \n&gt; (clients/servers/agents/intermediaries/caches/apps), how is being \n&gt; incompatible with pretty much everything RESTful?\n&gt; \n\n+1, but it may help in understanding the distinction between the style\nand the implementation, to better decouple the definition of the style\nfrom the implementation.\n\nURI still holds true -- as long as the carrier pigeons know how to fly\nback and forth between routers (pigeon coops), the server (human) who\nstuffs the paper into the little tube, and the semantics of what that\npaper represents, may be identified using a URI.\n\nThe paper could have little tear-off tabs with URLs on them, or a form\nto fill out, which could be sent by appropriate pigeon/tube.  Hypertext\nconstraint, and all...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A shared understanding between clients and servers which support many \n&gt; protocols already exists, Internet Media Types, this allows message \n&gt; bodies to move from one protocol to another, and indeed for the\n&gt; messages bodies / entities being transferred to be usable by apps on\n&gt; either side. Perhaps it&#39;s not up to the protocol to define a new\n&gt; (un)-shared understanding, but rather to adopt the existing shared\n&gt; understanding in order to be RESTful.\n&gt; \n\nOn the Internet, certainly.  ;-)  But what about Carrier Pigeon Transfer\nProtocol over IPoAC?\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549\n\nGray area, indeed!\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
