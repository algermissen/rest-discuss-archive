Identity, Unity, and\nIndividuality: Towards a formal toolkit for ontological analysis. In,\nHorn, W. ed., Proceedings of ECAI-2000: The European Conference on\nArtificial Intelligence. pp. 219-223. Berlin: IOS Press.

You\ncan distinguish between two instances of the String class that happen\nto have the same content, but you can&#39;t distinguish between two\noccurrences of the int value 7.  Unless you consider that a literal is\nnot a &quot;thing&quot;, you have to allow for there to be things that don&#39;t\nhave identity.\n\nI have argued that ontology modelling languages need to be able to\ndeclare which concepts have identity (and thus correspond to\nresources) and which represent structured &quot;value types&quot; without\nidentity.
