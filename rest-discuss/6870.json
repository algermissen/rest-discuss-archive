Fielding said \nRTF&gt;&gt; No, that isn&#39;t being pedantic -- it is being superficial.\n\nTo-may-to, To-mah-to.\n\nRTF&gt;&gt; Then why is it so hard to accept that an ARCHITECTURAL STYLE cannot\nitself be implemented, just as there is no implementation of green (only\nexamples)?  And that not being implementable in its style form does not mean\nthat an architecture cannot be constructed in such a way as to fit our\nagreed style?  \n\nIt&#39;s not hard to accept, until when asking for guidance there is torrent of\ncondescension about &quot;people who don&#39;t get it&quot; and how it is not possible to\ndo this and how it is not implementable to do that, and little if any\nguidance or open-mindedness about how to use it in a practical manner.  Joe\nGregorio&#39;s articles on XML.com are still the *only* thing to date I&#39;ve seen\nthat approaches practicality, and believe me I&#39;ve searched for practical\nexamples. But maybe you&#39;ll say practicality isn&#39;t goal, but then what good\nis something that has no practical use (without getting philisophical, of\ncourse?)\n\nYour analogy for &quot;green&quot; leaves is not applicable because I wasn&#39;t asking\nfor the &quot;one true REST,&quot; I was asking for an *implementable* REST; one that\ncould gain wide usage so as to see tools developed for it and a body of\npractical knowledge around its use.  In the case of leaves, there are\nbillions of &quot;implementations&quot; and also no need to get trees to &quot;adopt&quot;\nproducing them. \n\nIt&#39;s as if TBL had sat around and talked about URIs, HTML, and HTTP but\nwhenever anyone asked him how to implement it he did his best to make them\nfeel as if they were beneath him for asking. Instead TBL helped them\nimplement in a standard way so that it would be as universally compatible as\npossible.  Clearly many people before and since have used condescension to\ndiscuss their ideas but I dare say nobody else in history has seen the level\nof success TLB saw based on their ideas, at least not as rapidly. I see\npeople on this list lament how the industry has taken to SOAP and not REST\nand the backhanded jabs at those who use SOAP, but it&#39;s becoming pretty\nclear to me at least one good reason why REST has remained still-borne and\nSOAP has reined supreme.\n\nTell you what; my venting isn&#39;t going to change your or anyone else&#39;s\napproach on this list. I&#39;ll still participate to try and learn more, but I\ngive up on trying to inject any practicality into the discussions.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
