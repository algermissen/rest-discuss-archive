I&#39;ll still participate to try and learn more, but I\n&gt; give up on trying to inject any practicality into the discussions.\n\nOrdinarily, I don&#39;t participate so much in the list discussions - and\nI think it is worth my discussing why, in light of your statement\nabove.\n\nI am a full-time professional developer, but in my private time I am\nwriting a REST engine / framework in .NET and I can appreciate why\nsomeone seeking illumination of REST may feel a certain level of\nfrustration in the list discussions. I think that the list has a\nnatural tendency to carry out discussions at a higher level of\nabstraction than an implementer needs.\n\nWhy is this so? Well, for a start, the putative implementer is dealing\nwith the REST concepts at a coding level and there are many possible\nlanguages from which to choose to implement. Any language-specific\ndiscussion is liable to leave a greater or lesser part of the list\nbehind (we don&#39;t all know all languages). Secondly, by definition, the\nimplementer is dealing with the internal implementation of an endpoint\n- whereas REST isn&#39;t about endpoint internals, it&#39;s about HTTP\nmessaging.\n\nThus the discussions often end up revolving around conceptual HTTP\nmessage sets and, as I say, this can prove very frustrating when you\nare wanting to &#39;get to the meat&#39;.\n\nFor my part, I am not too far away from getting my REST engine running\non thoughtpad.net (don&#39;t all rush off there - there&#39;s nothing to see\nyet). When I do, I shall ask the list for feedback on the HTTP\nmessages supported for &#39;compliance&#39; with REST. Following that, I shall\nbe documenting the site and probably writing articles too.\n\nBut until I get to that point, I personally find it hard to be\n&#39;practical&#39; (as you observe) as I do not have something functional to\nwhich to refer.\n\nHope that this illuminates :-)\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
