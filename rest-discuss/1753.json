This is one of\n&gt;those problems we can just define away by appropriate abstraction.\n\nSince the OP specifically mentioned process synchronization, how does the\nimmutable approach make that disappear? More specifically how does it handle\nthe stale data/lost update problem? I can see that there is no such thing\nas a lost update in the traditional sense, but how does it cope with that\nscenario and still make sure that the &#39;current &#39; file contents are accurate?\n\nFurther, were you implying that immutability makes the problem of\npeople/processes working out of queue go away, e.g. in the workflow sense\nthat there is a shared queue of work needing to be done, with multiple\nprocesses being fed from the queue, how does immutability help with this\nsort of process synch&#39;ing?\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n"}}
