If the user-agent \nprefers Red Delicious over Golden Delicious the server responds with Red \nDelicious.\n\nAgent-driven negotiation is when the server responds with a list of options, \nor its best-guess representation plus a list of options.  All my examples \nassume a 200 OK response from the server, not 300 Options, I think that \nindicates server-driven negotiation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I suggest that cases in which representations each have their own\n&gt;URI are confusing when you are trying to understand the basic model\n&gt;of the relationships among resources and representations.  This could be\n&gt;why you are going off on containers.\n&gt;\n\nI agree that it&#39;s confusing, which is why I use Venn diagrams when I&#39;m \nfiguring out content-negotiation scenarios.  All I can really say is it works \nfor me.  Content negotiation introduces a certain ambiguity between resource \nand representation (one resource returns representations of other resources), \ndiagrams help me keep my head above water.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s why I am recommending you examine a content negotiation\n&gt;case that does not involve more than one URI.  And see how you apply\n&gt;set theory to that.\n&gt;\n&gt;Try it.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m all for constructive criticism here, I&#39;m not trying to be stubborn, but I \ncan&#39;t think of such a case.  The alternate representations can always be \nassigned their own URIs, which I always return in Content-Location because \nthat URI is not the same as the one in the &quot;location bar&quot;, i.e. the request \nURI.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Walden\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;From: &quot;Eric J.
