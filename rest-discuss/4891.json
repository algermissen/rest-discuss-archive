The recommended method is only GET\n&gt;&gt; though, for accessibility: You can&#39;t do a POST using a web browser\n&gt;&gt; without\n&gt;&gt; using forms\n&gt; [hvw] So? Use forms. Url encoded form data is perfectly fine way to\n&gt; represent data. Why bother with xml? Cf.\n\nHey...... who said I was going to use XML?\n\nSHARE is (in my view) datatype neutral. It does not specify what types you\nwant for the parameters and return values. These may be specified in WSDL\nas &quot;literal&quot; or something.... I&#39;m not sure. It seems that &#39;literal&#39;\nexpects XML-formatted data? Of course strong typing is also available\nsince it&#39;s WSDL anyway, you can use XML Schema types and even define your\nown types.\n\nBTW using XML schema types does not mean you&#39;re going to use XML. For\nexample this:\n\nGET /search.php?q=hello+world\n\nThe &#39;q&#39; parameter is of type &#39;string&#39;. But the GET request isn&#39;t in XML,\nisn&#39;t it? (well it&#39;s impossible to do a GET in XML I guess, since it has\nno body). And whatever returned by the service is as yet unknown, it\nshould be defined in the WSDL as &quot;returning HTML&quot; if it wants to return an\nHTML page. I&#39;m still not sure how to do this with WSDL though.\n\nBack to GET/POST. Why I don&#39;t want to use forms?\n\nGET /article/delete.php?id=737\n\nSee? It&#39;s that simple. Of course it&#39;s possible to use forms to do it\n(which will be the proper way), but using GET eliminates the need for\nforms. I have nothing against urlencoded form data or multipart (for\nsending files), in fact it&#39;s my preferred format for SHARE (for POST\nmethods), since most scripting engines handle it natively and\nautomatically i.e. in PHP translating them to request variables. Using XML\nas request body will very much complicate matters, but sometimes people\nwill want to use it so we shouldn&#39;t enforce urlencoding.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
