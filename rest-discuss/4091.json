Imagine two interfaces that\nthe univer=\r\nsities *may* implement:\n\nhttp://university.edu/ws/list - returns a list of =\r\nlinks to each student.\nhttp://university.edu/ws/search - accepts a keyword =\r\nand returns a list\nof links to each student that contains &#39;keyword&#39; in it&#39;s=\r\n name.\n\nSample response:\n\n&lt;students&gt;\n  &lt;student link=3D&quot;http://university.e=\r\ndu/ws/student/001&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;student link=3D&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/00=\r\n2&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;student link=3D&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/003&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/students&gt;=\r\n\n\nSince each university might implement neither, one or both interfaces,\nI =\r\nwould like to define a way for each university to &quot;say&quot; which\ninterfaces th=\r\ney implement... something like WSDL, that would allow\nautomatic service dis=\r\ncovery among universities.\n\nIs there any standard way of doing this within =\r\nthe REST arch. style?\n\nThanks in advance.\nBest regards,\nS=E9rgio Nunes\n\n\n\n"}}
