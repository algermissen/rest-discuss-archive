For instance, if there&#39;s a resource /Users/joebob, to change his\n&gt; address when he&#39;s also got a ssn and a phone number, should the resource\n&gt; require a submission of the ssn and phone number as well? or is an\n&gt; implicit contract of &quot;if it&#39;s not submitted, dont change it&quot; okay? The\n&gt; latter is certainly easier to build HTML forms for.\n\nI am sure I am not the only one who is confused about what is the outcome \nof this thread. I think I have figured it out and I offer a summary here\nwith a few observations of my own that I hope are correct.\n\nFirstly, I agree with Lucus Gonze.   B^)\n\n&gt; In my experience here, my practical questions get theoretical answers.\n\n\nSubmitting updates to resources\n-------------------------------\n\nYou cannot submit a modification to a resource and &quot;assume&quot; that the\nunmodified fields will remain the same. That is because the submitted state\nis ambiguous for all of the reasons that Jeff Bone has described.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4347\n\n\nThe completely unambiguous way to specify this is along the lines of:\n\nChange &#39;/Something/456&#39; from:\n----\n&lt;something id=456&gt;\n    &lt;foo&gt;1&lt;/foo&gt;\n    &lt;bar&gt;2&lt;/bar&gt;\n    &lt;baz&gt;3&lt;/baz&gt;\n&lt;/something&gt;\n----\nto:\n----\n&lt;something id=456&gt;\n    &lt;foo&gt;5&lt;/foo&gt;\n    &lt;bar&gt;2&lt;/bar&gt;\n    &lt;baz&gt;3&lt;/baz&gt;\n&lt;/something&gt;\n----\n\nThis seems somewhat counter productive as you end up transfering more\ndata rather than less. However, this is what you want to happen. \nThis defines the inital &#39;resource state&#39; and the\nnext &#39;resource state&#39;. The issue is how do we transfer the\nchange of resource state in the most efficient manner.\n\nI believe there are few cases where it is OK to simply clobber the \nresource with the final resource state, ie. the update is only valid\nif the state of the resource has not been modified. Fortunately, HTTP\nhas a couple of mechanisms to help. The If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since\nrequest-header fields can be used to conditionally update the resource.\n\nNow for the important part.\n\nSince we can identify the exact state on the origin server that we\nwish to modify, and both the User Agent and Origin Server have a rendition\nof this state, it is not neccessary to transfer all of the next\nresource state. It is acceptable to transfer a delta to the original\nstate and the Origin Server will understand exactly what is required.\n\nA diff would suffice. For example,\n\nPUT /Something/456\nIf-Match: v254\nContent-Type: text/diff\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n2c2\n&lt;     &lt;foo&gt;1&lt;/foo&gt;\n---\n&gt;     &lt;foo&gt;5&lt;/foo&gt;\n-------\n\nThe body of this request is the result of a unix diff on the initial and\nnext states defined above. I believe that this is what Mark Baker ment\nwhen he said -\n\n&gt; &gt; You seem to start off by saying that a partial update via POST is \n&gt; &gt; non-RESTful,\n&gt; \n&gt; Only if there&#39;s a shared expectation between the two parties that an\n&gt; update is what&#39;s occuring.  If it happens anyway, without such an\n&gt; expectation, then that&#39;s RESTful.\n\nThe update, in this case, is stated explicitly in the request body and \nnot implied by some mutual understanding between the client and\nserver applications.\n\nWell, how did I do? Is that even close to the truth?\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
