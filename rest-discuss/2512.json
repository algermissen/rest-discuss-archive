So I use 2 now. 3 seems to come up very often when\n&gt; using RDF, and appears to be a namespace URI hack to generate URIs with\n&gt; fragment IDs from namespace qualified names. I haven&#39;t seen examples of \n&gt; the rest.\n\nI think Tim Berners-Lee and Roy Fielding disagree on what is appropriate \nbetween 1. and 3. IIRC, Basically Tim&#39;s position is that &quot;1&quot; identifies \nthe HTTP resource (the W3C&#39;s web page) and &quot;3&quot; identifies the &quot;logical \nconcept&quot; (the W3C). I believe that Fielding thinks that 1. identifies \nthe logical concept and it is up to the identifying context to be \nexplicit whether it is talking about a resource or a representation.\n\nI tend to agree with Vincent that there is no reason in Web architecture \nto prefer 2. to 1. I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt to &quot;hint&quot; that the resource \nis a container. But if it isn&#39;t then it is especially annoying that it \nis difficult to leave off the slash in most web servers.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n\n"}}
