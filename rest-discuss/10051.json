AtomPub is meant to be used for a\nset/col=\r\nlection of stuff. Only thing you will have to additionally\nworry about is h=\r\now to change ordering etc amongst the elements. You\ncould easily do that by=\r\n a Edit on the the resource(look up the RFC on\nwhich URI to use and what ve=\r\nrb to use here). The user will just run a\nEdit on the resource he wants to =\r\nchange, the reordering will be taken\ncare of by the server .\n\nWhy I am aski=\r\nng you to do this? Because AtomPub would nearly make sure\nthat you are bein=\r\ng RESTful and your URI design/use of verbs etc. is\nall correct, making actu=\r\nal design and implementation very simple. Look\nup Dan Diephouse&#39;s netzooid.=\r\ncom/presentations/atompub_services.ppt for\na quick and simple overview of A=\r\ntomPub. I think it should work fine\nfor you.\n\n\nRegards,\ndev\n\n\n"}}
