For \n&gt; &gt; example, if you are using  AJAX in HTML, #1 would be preferred.  If \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t already have a representation, #2 would be preferred (using \n&gt; &gt; robots.txt as per\n&gt; &gt; siteData-36 discussion), and in the case of intermediaries (and I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; sure other use cases) #3b/#4 would be preferred.  At least IMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that you like #2 but static stuff like that smells bad to me.\n&gt; Perhaps I am in a minority (of one?) in thinking so, but there it is.\n\nWhen I first started looking at it I didn&#39;t like #2 either, but after\nstudying TAG issue siteData-36 I came to believe it would be an important\nand viable approach. Their discussion, btw, didn&#39;t advocate robots.txt so\nmuch as it identified robots.txt as the least bad option.  Further, I think\nsome of their main objections to it (concern for people who had no access to\nthe root of a website and who had such a poor relationship with those who\ndid have access that they couldn&#39;t get robots.txt modified) is not a\ncritical concern here.  For service discovery, if someone is publishing a\nservice they can figure out a way to get access to a root, somehow, even if\nit means creating a subdomain or getting another domain that they do\ncontrol.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d be interested in your take on the subject assuming you read the\nprior discussions on sideData-36 [1]. It was only discussed eight times so\nit shouldn&#39;t be that hard to review it.  Maybe you&#39;ll come away with a\ndifferent idea, but my guess is you would also think using robots.txt for\ninitial service discovery to be a good idea after reading the siteData-36\ndiscussions.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#siteData-36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
