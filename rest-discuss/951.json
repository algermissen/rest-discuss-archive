All the documents except the &quot;Ack&quot; are in the control of the\n&gt; Seller.\n\n[...]\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, then, next complication:  the offer to buy should not be good\n&gt; forever, it should have a time constraint.  At the appointed time,\n&gt; the Buyer could check the URI for the Acceptance or Rejection\n&gt; document and if it&#39;s not there, the deal is off.
