I can&#39;t pin point it\n&gt; right now, as I&#39;ll need some more time to reflect, but there are some\n&gt; areas that don&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to what I&#39;ve come to learn as REST.\n\nIt seems to be one person&#39;s suggestions on how to implement\na REST-based service.  Too bad it wasn&#39;t written that way.\n\nIt would be more accurate to say that he is interleaving REST\nwith SOA and some vague notion of W3C webarch, without\nunderstanding that REST pre-dated the other two by over three\nyears and that both SOA and webarch cover topics beyond the\nhypertext realm of REST.  He marks suggestions as [AR] to\nmean &quot;arguably REST&quot;, which should really be read as\n&quot;not part of REST but not specifically forbidden by REST&quot;.\n\nBTW, just about everything he wrote about methods and use\nof XML is wrong, and the stuff about query is just bad design\nfrom SOA (nothing at all to do with REST).\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
