You could send a status report to a server to\nbe stored. You could retrieve a status report. You could update a status\nreport. You could delete a status report.\n\n\n&gt; Then &#39;how do I do that&#39;?\n&gt;   I use a resource (this sounds odd Mike),  to send a query to a server\nusing http\nOne realization is that a query does not have to be a special or privileged\noperation. You don&#39;t need to &#39;send a query&#39; - what you typically want to do\nis to &#39;retrieve results&#39;. Think in terms of the data & not the operation.\nThe result set is the interesting bit, not the way the query itself is\nwritten. The simplest and most generic thing is just to get the results.\n\n&gt; (question: Does the recipient *have* to be a server?\nThe term &#39;server&#39; just means a request handler. Any piece of software that\nhas socket based network library can accept incoming messages. You can find\nHTTP listeners in embedded micro-controllers, etc.\n\n&gt; What testbeds do people use for restful systems playing/testing?)\nI typically prototype in JSP and then implement Java servlets based on my\npersonal view of &#39;cool&#39; URIs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; For HTTP, there are several pre-defined operations that work in nearly\nall situation - assuming\n&gt; &gt; you have a rich set of resources to interact with.\n&gt;\n&gt; For this use, you make it sound like resources == &#39;many servers&#39;?\nA server is a &#39;resource manager&#39; - it handles requests to manipulate many\nmany resources. The resource itself isn&#39;t necessarily a literal software\nobject. It may be useful to start thinking that way, but eventually you will\nrun into the question of what response code to use when someone sends a\nDELETE to a resource that doesn&#39;t exist (hint: it&#39;s not necessarily an error\ncode).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  The operations are GET (retrieve a representation of the identified\nresource),\n&gt; &gt; PUT (set the content of the resource identified by the client),\n&gt; Never having used PUT, I&#39;ll leave that for the time being.\nFine.\n\n&gt; &gt;  DELETE (guess what this does),\n&gt; &gt; and POST (process the submitted data, possibly creating a new resource).\n&gt; (server based, or am I just being old fashioned? I&#39;m using post for\n&gt; uploading 1..n files via an html form.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  If you want to put operation=query you can, but it is redundant with\n&#39;GET&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hadn&#39;t thought of it, but I did have get in mind. Total string length\n&gt; limitations allowing I guess.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I right in thinking you have gone beyond client and server,\n&gt; and are simply using software which takes advantage of the\n&gt; http protocol?\nSort of. The term &quot;client/server&quot; has some historical meaning based an\nevolution away from mainframe approaches, as well as a more generic term in\nnetwork application design. I just think of it as &#39;sender&#39; and &#39;receiver&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
