Should not have referen=\r\nce to REST name, but should have a name, and not only that, also a definiti=\r\non of constrains, the goal or target, the consequences, etc. Just like docu=\r\nmenting a new style. \n\nBTW, one thing is a style and another one an API. St=\r\nyle is more like a pattern, thus should have a name for many APIs. So, REST=\r\n is an architectural style, thus created to guide the creation of systems, =\r\nnot APIs. An API is, as the name indicates, an interface to communicate wit=\r\nh an application or system behind. It makes sense the application is RESTFu=\r\nll, but more than often, the application is a SOA or a plain distributed ob=\r\nject oriented one, that someone wants to expose to the web. I see not REST =\r\nanywhere there. \n\nCheers\nWilliam. \n\n\n"}}
