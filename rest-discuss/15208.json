We&#39;ll never get anywhere in\ndiscussions if we keep insisting on using undefined terms like &quot;REST\nclient.&quot;\n\nYou can say &quot;client component&quot; if you are talking about the client side\nin general.  You can say &quot;client connector&quot; of course.  But you can&#39;t\nsay &quot;REST client&quot; and expect anyone to know what you&#39;re talking about,\nbecause that term ambiguously also applies to the client connector on a\ncache component, user agents and REST applications.\n\nYou can, of course, say &quot;user agent&quot; when discussing that specific\ntype of a client component.  Sometimes, some people seem to mean &quot;user\nagent&quot; when they say &quot;REST client&quot; but other times those same people\nmean &quot;REST application,&quot; as that term refers to the API described by\nyour hypertext, which executes in the user agent -- the executing app\nis a &quot;REST client&quot; just like a user agent or client connector.\n\nDamn confusing, it is!  I hereby ban the term from rest-discuss, for\nwhatever good that&#39;ll do.  :-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
