I recall you using an\nexample like this before.\n\n&gt; identifying a resource that they are \n&gt; conversing about?\n\nI think that&#39;s a different thing, though perhaps you misspoke, or I&#39;m\nmisinterpreting you.  I take that to mean the URI in the HTTP request\nline, e.g. &quot;GET http://example.org/foo&quot;, rather than a URI identifying\nsome context in which the conversation is occuring (while remaining\nstateless).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
