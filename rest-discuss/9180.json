JSON is the subset of JavaScript that is the simple notation for\n&gt; representing structured data.  That contains strings, numbers, booleans, and\n&gt; lists and maps thereof.  If you look around, you&#39;ll notice that pretty much\n&gt; every programming language has these constructs, and that is not by\n&gt; coincidence.\n\nDepends on what you mean by a programming language, and what you mean by \n&quot;has&quot;. SQL doesn&#39;t have lists or maps, though it can imitate them with \ntables. Classic C doesn&#39;t have booleans, though it can imitate them with \nints. Java doesn&#39;t have native lists or maps though it has these in the \nstandard library. Some other languages do have these constructs.\n\nThe point is that you can always hack together some representation of \nlists, maps, and so forth in any reasonably powerful language. It&#39;s not \na question of what you can do, but what&#39;s convenient to do.\n\nThe interesting thing about XML is that, unlike most other languages and \ndata representation formats, it doesn&#39;t stop or even start with lists \nand maps and structured data. It&#39;s about trees and semistructured data. \nThat&#39;s an incredibly powerful and useful generalization, but it&#39;s so \nradical that ten years in a lot of developer still haven&#39;t left the \nlist/map playground. You can get a lot done with lists and maps, but \nthere&#39;s even more information in the world that doesn&#39;t fit into lists \nand maps in any reasonable way.\n\nWe aren&#39;t done yet. Semistructured is better than structured, but we \nwon&#39;t have achieved real info nirvana until we learn how to manage \nunstructured data. When that is achieved, computer science will have \nfinally grown up.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
