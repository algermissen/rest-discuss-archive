Who knows what will happen in that language game [1]. What \nyou do know is the success criteria are undefined - unlike PUT and \nDELETE, POST is degenerate.\n\nAs for APP, the most important contraints its adding aren&#39;t around POST; \nthey&#39;re around semantically relating resources to each other (either via \ncollections or media links). It&#39;s subtle but it&#39;s a big deal.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n[1] http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/APA/apa/node2.html\n\nWalden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;algermissen1971&quot; &lt;algermissen1971@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:algermissen1971%40mac.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Actually, I wonder if actions that are performed through &#39;process\n&gt; this&#39;-POST (and not\n&gt; : through manipulation of resuorce state) aren&#39;t in fact hidden RPC anyhow\n&gt; and thus are\n&gt; : against REST&#39;s architectural principles.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;process this&#39;-POST can be thought of as &quot;implicit invocation&quot;. Another\n&gt; way of thinking of it is event delivery. In RPC, the client requests a\n&gt; remote\n&gt; method invocation.
