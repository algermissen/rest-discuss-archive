One of them is www-urlencoded from a browser. That browser\n&gt; uses a form that lives at /customers;editor.html and has a &lt;form&gt; pointing\n&gt; to /customer. The editor page was accessed after the client dereferenced\n&gt; /customers and was given a 300.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Enoug said, data validation fails, /customers cannot accept the request\n&gt; entity. Would you 400 to the request and pass /customers;editor.html in the\n&gt; body with an appropriate Content-Location header (assuming the client has\n&gt; Accept: application/html+xml) and the details of why the validation failed?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to be the best solution I&#39;ve found so far but I&#39;m sure other people\n&gt; have come up with better alternatives J\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n"}}
