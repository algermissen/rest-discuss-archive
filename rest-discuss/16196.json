This is something I often see when talking to others about\nHTTP. T=\r\nhere is very often an *assumption* that PUT and GET are\nsymmetrical. I thin=\r\nk this comes about because, so often, PUT is\ndescribed as having &quot;replace&quot; =\r\nsemantics (&quot;the PUT message body\nreplaces the content of the target resourc=\r\ne&quot;, etc.).   It also happens\nquite often when folks are using/building serv=\r\ners that do not do much\ncontent negotiation at the data format level (accep=\r\nt: text/html,\ntext/plain, application/atom+xml, etc.).\n\nMy most successful =\r\nway to help people avoid this mistake is to remind\nthem that we only pass *=\r\nrepresentations* around, not resources. And\nthat, just like IRL (in real li=\r\nfe), a representation is bound to leave\nout various details; a representati=\r\non is transient, there are lots of\npossible representations of the same &quot;th=\r\ning&quot;, etc.\n\nThus, &quot;the representation of the PUT message is used to replace=\r\n the\ncontent of the target resource...&quot; (or something more accurately\nworde=\r\nd) is a better way to talk about it.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://=\r\nmamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Aug 6, 2010 at 09:21, Mark Baker &lt;distob=\r\nj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Thu, Aug 5, 2010 at 4:39 PM, Jon Hanna &lt;jon@hackcraf=\r\nt.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On 2010-08-04 07:01, Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess I=\r\n keep thinking that the content of a PUT request must be the same as the co=\r\nntent of a GET request to that same resource.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it need not be.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (I lack a pointer for this - can anyone supply one?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s enta=\r\niled by the fact of content-negotiation.
