You build the documents according to a recipe you read in a\n&gt; spec, and submit them to urls you get by parsing hypertext. \n\nYou mean like how you can read the recipe for interacting with a form in \nI don&#39;t know, is it 3, specs?\n\n&gt; By\n&gt; agreement we know that you can POST an &lt;entry&gt; document to the url\n&gt; designited by rel=something. But on the web you get an HTML form from\n&gt; an URL and the form tells you how to form the submission and where to\n&gt; POST it.\n\nThe form tells you no such thing. What you are ascribing to forms is a \nkind of gensym fallacy rather than any improved expressive power. See my \npost elsewhere about self-description. IOW, I&#39;d like to see the argument \nthat  says forms are in a different language class than APP.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
