I&#39;d suggest exposing every possible report as a resource. Even\nthough it may be tricky discovering all those resources, once any one of\nthem has been provided via any mechanism, it is forever a directly\nreferenceable resource. \nend quote.\n\nDoes that imply that once a resource is put online, it *should* remain\nonline/available via a get?\n For transitory information, that sounds awfully wasteful Mike?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; So, you have status reports. You could send a status report to a server to\n&gt; be stored. You could retrieve a status report. You could update a status\n&gt; report. You could delete a status report.\n\n(memories of mac vs pc? noun vb or vb noun :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then &#39;how do I do that&#39;?\n&gt; &gt;   I use a resource (this sounds odd Mike),  to send a query to a server\n&gt; using http\n&gt; One realization is that a query does not have to be a special or privileged\n&gt; operation. You don&#39;t need to &#39;send a query&#39; - what you typically want to do\n&gt; is to &#39;retrieve results&#39;. \n\nTell me that&#39;s not nit-picking please? why differentiate?\n  Go to the shop vs get a newspaper?\nSame thing?\n\n\n\n&gt; Think in terms of the data & not the operation.\nThe data I want vs how to get it(the query)? Makes sense.\n\n&gt; The result set is the interesting bit, not the way the query itself is\n&gt; written. The simplest and most generic thing is just to get the results.\n&lt;grin/&gt; Unsubtle use of get??\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (question: Does the recipient *have* to be a server?\n&gt; The term &#39;server&#39; just means a request handler. Any piece of software that\n&gt; has socket based network library can accept incoming messages. You can find\n&gt; HTTP listeners in embedded micro-controllers, etc.\n\nGood. I&#39;d hate to ask all systems to host server software!\n  \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What testbeds do people use for restful systems playing/testing?)\n&gt; I typically prototype in JSP and then implement Java servlets based on my\n&gt; personal view of &#39;cool&#39; URIs.\nThanks.\n\n\n&gt; A server is a &#39;resource manager&#39; - it handles requests to manipulate many\n&gt; many resources.\nYes, with the explanations above that makes sense now.\n\n&gt; &gt; Am I right in thinking you have gone beyond client and server,\n&gt; &gt; and are simply using software which takes advantage of the\n&gt; &gt; http protocol?\n&gt; Sort of. The term &quot;client/server&quot; has some historical meaning based an\n&gt; evolution away from mainframe approaches, as well as a more generic term in\n&gt; network application design. I just think of it as &#39;sender&#39; and &#39;receiver&#39;.\n\nI&#39;d prefer that too; Makes it two systems talking/transacting,\nwhich is more equitable :-)\n\nThanks Mike. \n  The fog&#39;s beginning to clear.\n\nI was fighting rfc&#39;s this morning;\nEventually found 1.1, \nthank goodness for Milos;\nhttp://www.zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC_share/Output/index.html\n(I haven&#39;t got round to 2817 yet, I&#39;m hoping I won&#39;t have to)\n\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards DaveP.\nXSLT&Docbook  FAQ\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl\n\n\n\n"}}
