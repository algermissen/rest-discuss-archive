This is damaging to the overall value proposition of the Web.  While I\nhave complete respect and sympathy for the folks that have to deal with network\nadministration and security --- indeed, they are my customers in my commercial\nendeavors --- from a pure innovator&#39;s perspective this just doesn&#39;t cut it.  It\nartificially inhibits the proliferation of new technology.\n\nWe dealt with this problem ad nauseam at Activerse, where we built the first and\nAFAIK to date only truly decentralized presence and instant messaging\ninfrastructure.  We tried to acquiesce to the needs of the network admin, and\nultimately that was our undoing --- we couldn&#39;t sell our technology into enterprises\nbecause it required an active decision on the part of the network admin, whose job\nlongevity is proportional to their success in preserving the status quo.  By\nrequiring the active support and involvement of the network admin, we limited our\nability to deploy into the very environment we were attempting to target and build\nfor.  We would&#39;ve been much more successful had we simply (ab)used HTTP, using it in\na decentralized way and tunneling HTTP through HTTP itself.\n\n&quot;Extending&quot; (i.e., figuring out how to use) HTTP for symmetric and asynchronous\napplication communication patterns is a good idea.  Introducing new protocols and\nnew asymmetries is not.\n\nOther problems with this suggestion:  it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense to use\nHTTP 0.9 as the PSP.  The only method supported by HTTP 0.9 IIRC is GET, which\ndoesn&#39;t make any sense for a notification.  It&#39;s not clear what meaningful responses\ncould be returned, either.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
