The HTTP RFC says that DELETE is to delete the resource at\n&gt; the URI sai=\r\nd. Popping is deleting the topmost uri. Allowing Deletes\n&gt; directly on elem=\r\nents would be wrong as that would allow you to delete\n&gt; any element( unless=\r\n you hack through a solution in which every\n&gt; resource checks whether it is=\r\n the topmost resource before getting\n&gt; deleted).\n&gt; \n&gt; Delete the TOP just d=\r\noes that .. delete the current top. How does it\n&gt; matter if after that anot=\r\nher element becomes the top?\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, there might be arguments against w=\r\nhat I just said , but the\n&gt; increase in coupling caused by any other soluti=\r\non imho makes for an\n&gt; overwhelming choice for this option.\n&gt; \n&gt; In short, =\r\nI like the OPs solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
