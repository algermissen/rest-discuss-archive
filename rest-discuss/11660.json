Which was *not* my point.\n\nMy point was that even if you get there (unify that set of business\n&quot;standards&quot;), what you get for &quot;application neutrality&quot; is just the\nability to use different business software at each end of a business\nexchange like purchasing.  But you&#39;re still just doing purchasing.\nYou can&#39;t use the same application software for mortgage refinancing.\nIn other words, each of the standards that could be achieved would be\nspecific to a specific business process or function.  And each\nspecific business process or even business process variation would\nrequire another standard definition, although the definitions could be\ncomposed from a set of standard elements.\n\nI think Atom has somewhat broader applicability in practice, that is,\nused for more than one function or process.  But even there, as\nseveral people have commented, you need to arrive at some further\nagreement on extensions.\n\nAnd of course HTTP has even broader applicability, used for almost -\nbut not quite - any process or function. But there, you need to arrive\nat agreement on media types and the meaning of embedded hyperlinks for\nhypermedia-controlled state transitions.\n\nOn Mon, Dec 1, 2008 at 9:54 PM, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Mon, Dec 1, 2008 at 10:13 PM, Bob Haugen &lt;bob.haugen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I guess the other question (ignoring for the moment whether\n&gt;&gt; &quot;application neutral&quot; is a felicitous phrase) is:\n&gt;&gt; how neutral is it, really?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, if you put your head around some merger of\n&gt;&gt; REA/ebXML/UNCEFACT/UBL/OAGIS and add some standard protocols for\n&gt;&gt; message interactions, you still end up with protocols for e.g.\n&gt;&gt; negotiating purchase orders. And the purchase order protocol will not\n&gt;&gt; work for deliveries or returns or (heaven help us) mortages.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And even the purchase order protocol will have several variations,\n&gt;&gt; depending on whether the purchaser wants a quote first, who pays for\n&gt;&gt; transportation, and several other piddly business details.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So the buyer and seller might be able to use different application\n&gt;&gt; software (that was the OAGIS promise, seldom really fulfilled) but\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s still just purchasing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh yes, its going to take a long while. Look how many decades its taken to\n&gt; go from umpteen network architectures to IP! This is hard work. But it is\n&gt; what REALLY causes business transformation.\n&gt; We will go from thousands of variations, to hundreds, to dozens, to a\n&gt; handful ... over decades. Look at how many healthcare related coding schemes\n&gt; there are internationally!\n&gt; But the sooner we get our heads out of the weeds of SOAP vs whatever debates\n&gt; and focus on BUSINESS-LEVEL interoperability issues, the sooner we&#39;ll get\n&gt; there. I can&#39;t tell you how many IT executives think that just incanting\n&gt; &quot;SOA&quot; and buying some XML/WS-* technology just makes all this business-level\n&gt; interop just happen.\n&gt; We need them to refocus on business standards instead of wasting their time\n&gt; on technology standards. The technology standards are EASY by comparison.\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n\n"}}
