If they are modified and then approved, which\n&gt; usually happens, then your I-D should follow suit so the sooner they are\n&gt; processed the better.  Which might mean you requesting the AD to set the\n&gt; wheels in motion, explaining why timeliness matters.\n\nthe errata are still just in the &quot;reported&quot; state, \nhttp://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=5261 lists the 4 i have \nsubmitted. 3 of those now are actually part of the updates to RFC 5261 \nin the draft, so i am wondering whether these errata are needed anymore? \nideally, my draft would update RFC 5261, and then the errata would be \nredundant, right?\n\n&gt; And, out of curiosity, do you expect people to use XPath 1.0 or 2.0?  I\n&gt; ask because in Netconf, I was keen to specify 2.0 and not 1.0, the\n&gt; handling of namespaces in 2.0 seemed superior, but was told we could not\n&gt; because there were no implementations for people to use, that 2.0 was a\n&gt; great idea that had not happened (mmm IPv6?).  The Normative reference\n&gt; for Yang remains the 1999 version.\n\n2.0 is a vast improvement over 1.0, but it also is much more complex to \nimplement. when 1.0 was released, XML was all the rage and there were a \nlot of people implementing specs. when 2.0 was released, the XML hyper \ncurve already trended downward, plus it&#39;s just harder to implement. as a \nresult it&#39;s true that it&#39;s surprisingly hard to find implementations of \n2.0. so while personally, i always use 2.0 because you can write better \ncode, it&#39;s true that in specs, if you can get away with 1.0, it may be a \ngood idea to stick to it.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
