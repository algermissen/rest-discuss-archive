In this case, which response\n&gt; code is more appropriate to reflect multiple resources creation? (201\n&gt; Created?)\n&gt; \n&gt; And what if server failed to create some of them (i.e. the phyiscal\n&gt; storage has full, unableto store last two files). How do we construct\n&gt; a response (and resposne code) that reflect such partial failure\n&gt; accurately?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s quite common in real world applications, where a single POST\n&gt; request triggers multiple resources creation. For example, a new user\n&gt; registration in web hosting service will trigger several resources\n&gt; (i.e. user profile & user&#39;s file-system directories) creation as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; How to reflect each resource creation status accurately in a single\n&gt; response message?\n\nI faced a similar situation recently. The POST request triggers an \noperation that creates many separate resources.\n\nSo the POST creates all the resources, and an additional single resource \n(a report) that contains information on each other resource created. It \nthen returns 201 (created) and the location of the report that describes \nthe status and location of the sub resources.\n\nThis approach also works well for async creation of the resources. The \nreport is created and the POST returns its location. The process that \ncreates the resources is launched and it updates the report as it \nattempts to create each resource.\n\n--\nClaude\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; -toydi-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
