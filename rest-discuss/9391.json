I think it&#39;s made perfectly clear that DELETE deletes in\n&gt; RFC 2616. When you have deleted a resource, it is deleted.\n\nDELETE deletes hardly explains things since the discussion revolves\naround what &#39;&#39;delete&#39;&#39; actually entails. I prefer to say that the\nresource and the URL have been unbound from each other.\n\nWhen Eric said that Aristotle&#39;s example changes the DELETE semantic\nfrom &quot;remove&quot; to &quot;move&quot;, he is tying himself too closely to the\nlower-level model.\n\nOne could view all resources as being bound to at least two URLs at\nthe beginning of its life-cycle. One of the URLs is created and\nmanaged automatically by the system. It stays, for the most part,\ninvisible until the other URL is DELETE-ed. When that happens, this\nsystem-managed URL is made known through various mechanism, e.g.:\nincluding it in the DELETE response.\n\nThis way, there is no moving being done. DELETE removes. It removes\none of the bindings. It unbinds a resource from the URL being\nDELETE-ed.\n\nThe fact that a system does not create the binding to a system-managed\nURL at the beginning of a resource&#39;s life-cycle within the lower-level\npoint of view or creates one only upon a DELETE request, does not mean\nthat logically it has not been there since the beginning.\n\nImagine a coder that writes a loop and a compiler that unrolls said\nloop in the final translation. Do you say that there is a loop because\nthe coder meant to have a loop -OR- there is not a loop because the\nfinal rendition does not contain any looping construct.\n\nI say there is a loop because caring how a logical view is rendered in\nthe lower-level unnecessarily restricts what can be done during the\ntranslation. This also applies to human renderer too like you and I\nwho have to translate diagrams-on-napkins to some code.\n\nYS\n\n"}}
