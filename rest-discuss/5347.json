I am begining \nto understand what REST is all about. I still haven&#39;t read the \ndissertation cover to cover and I feel I should do. My interest is how \nto perform object orientated machine-to-machine communication using a \nReST style. After thinking about it the only truly ReSTful approach to \ninter-application OO communication  is the optional &quot;code on-demand&quot; style.\n\nThinking it through, ReST is all about exposing state. So ReSTful \napplications communicate by retrieving (GET) or modifying (POST) each \nothers state. So no distributed OO messaging (no new verbs), just state \ntransfer. In an OO system state is hidden within objects, so state \ntransfer becomes object transfer, which in ReST terms becomes \ncode-on-demand.\n\nFor me this is a whole new way of looking at distributed applications. \nSo the issue is no longer which synchronous messages (verbs) I should \nsend and to which service interface. The new issues are now:\n\n  1. Which state should I expose and why?\n  2. Which state do I need to retrieve a copy of, and from\n     where?\n  3. How should I respond to unsolicited changes in my state?\n  4. And what state changes should I induce in other components?\n\nThinking it through, communication by state transfer is analogous to \nasynchronous messaging. Pushing and pulling information around a \ndistributed application. If your distributed application is architected \nin this loosely coupled way, then HTTP and mime types should be \nsufficient. No synchronous RPC style messaging is required.\n\nSo by definition a ReST connector operates in a single realm, the realm \nof the ReSTful distributed application. It is a matter of architecting \nyour application in this style.\n\nHave I  finally got It? If so, then:\n\n   1. Where can I find out more about &quot;code-on-demand&quot;?\n   2. How does ReST deal with transactions?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
