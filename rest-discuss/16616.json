One issue that seems to be giving us grief is how to map=\r\n an inheritance hierarchy.\n\nSuppose I am a zoo or vetrinary clinic and I am=\r\n modelling resources for animals. My object and XML representations involve=\r\n a hierarchy of specializations:\n Animal\n  |- Mammal\n     |- Dog\n     |- Ca=\r\nt\n  |- Reptile\n     |- Snake\n     |- Lizard\n\nAnyway, suppose I store inform=\r\nation about individual animals in my system and I want to present operation=\r\ns on them in a RESTful way.\n\nMy thinking is that I should give them a canon=\r\nical representation like:\nhttp://animalsRus.com/animals/123\n\nI should **NOT=\r\n** additionally create aliased URIs like:\nhttp://animalsRus.com/dogs/123\nfo=\r\nr several reasons. I may have to create the animal before I know it is a do=\r\ng, or I may have to correct a data entry error. \n\nI am hesitant to put the =\r\ninheritance chain in the the URI like\nhttp://animalsRus.com/animals/mammals=\r\n/dogs/123\nbecause refactoring of the class hierarchy shouldn&#39;t create tensi=\r\non between it and the URI structure. I view the class hierarchy as an imple=\r\nmentation detail, but it does refer to concepts that are meaningful in the =\r\nbusiness domain.\n\nI would generally search for any animial like this:\nhttp:=\r\n//animalsRus.com/animals?owner=3DJoe\n\nBut I might allow searching just for =\r\ndogs like so:\nhttp://animalsRus.com/dogs?owner=3DJoe\n\nDoes this seem reason=\r\nable? What approaches have others taken to domain nouns that are organized =\r\ninto an inheritance tree?\n\n\n"}}
