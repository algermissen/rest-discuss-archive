I suppose you can do a &#39;find&#39; as a parameterized &#39;read&#39; - only your\n&gt; parameters are image bits, not text. That makes it kind of hard to use GET\n&gt; to do the read.\n&gt; [...post images then  get results...]\n\nHmm.  This is a start, but:\n* If HTTP is centered on read/write and I want\nfind, then perhaps I want a different protocol.\nBut, then why does the URI spec have a query\nstring?  It feels like we are now hacking around\neither the inadequacies of HTTP or the\ninadequacies of REST.\n\n* I think you would PUT rather than POST the\nimages (you are not appending to anything)\n\n* either PUT or POST is bad, because the server\nnow needs to maintain a copy of the results for\nsome indeterminate period of time -- which is\nugly.\n\n* if processing the request takes a while, the\nclient has to keep polling the GET url until it\ngets a response -- which is also ugly.\n\nThe best protcol for this may not be HTTP, but to\nthe extent we want to use it, I think the best\ndesign is for the Client to POST the two images\nas multpart/mixed with reply-to-url/message-id\nheaders.  And then for the Server to reply\nback with the answer or reply 202 and eventually\nsend result to the callback url.\n\nThat being said, if we want to expose the\napplication to web browsers, the correct answer is\nfor the server to handle multipart/form-data, and\neither respond with the answer, or response with a\nform asking where the answer should be delivered.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
