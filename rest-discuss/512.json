Adding &quot;search&quot; to HTTP would be trivial. Would adding URI\n&gt; handling and content-negotiation to IMAP be similarly trivial?\n\nRe URI handling, do you mean RFC2192?\nRe content negotiation, do you mean:\nContent-type: multipart/alternative\n\n&gt; &gt; ODBC/SQL is also nice from the perspective you\n&gt; &gt; give.  The problem is that it does not specify a\n&gt; &gt; way of passing the types of objects!!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Also not very well geared for large scale, loosely coupled computing.\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; &gt; Regarding universality.  I would say that much of\n&gt; &gt; the universality of a communication protocol is a\n&gt; &gt; shared ontology aka a shared list of MIME\n&gt; &gt; content-types.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that this is necessary for an application. But I wouldn&#39;t say\n&gt; that it is a benefit of the protocol itself.\n\nI think it is the main benefit of the protocol and\nthe big problem with most RPC protocols.  They\ndon&#39;t provide a standard way of representing\nall types.\n\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
