Do you think REST is a reasonable alternative to \n&gt; CORBA, EJB, RMI and SOAP for some/many distributed applications? Of course \n&gt; there are considerations like performance, security and transaction handling \n&gt; to be dealt with. But on the plus side, I really like the simplicity of \n&gt; REST, being able to easily pass any XML and get any XML back ... defined by \n&gt; some type of schema. I&#39;m getting the impression though that most people see \n&gt; this as a fringe use of REST. True?\n\nNot at all.  I&#39;ve built a handful of largely RESTful app-to-app systems,\nand I&#39;ve found them to be far superior to those I&#39;ve built using CORBA\nand RMI.\n\nRegarding &quot;XML and ... some type of schema&quot;, I&#39;ve recently used Semantic\nWeb technologies like RDF, and likewise consider that a superior\napproach to vanilla XML/XML-Schema for data extensibility and\nintegration purposes.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
