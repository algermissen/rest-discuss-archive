The only question is\nwhether the spec should be explicit about that or just depend on common\nsense. I&#39;m in favour of being explicit.\n\nNext question is whether to hard-code a method. My sense is that you\ndon&#39;t buy much by doing so. 99% of all services will use PUT or POST\ndepending on whether the change is relative to the previous state fo the\nresource or absolute (Mark Baker&#39;s idea...stock price change versus new\nstock price).\n\nLeaving open the option of other methods doesn&#39;t seem to have much\ninteroperability cost to me. People will only use it when they think\nthat their subscribers will understand it. And it &quot;feels&quot; to me like it\nmight allow some kinds of coordination where I say: &quot;this thing is going\nto change in the future. I want that change to trigger a DELETE over\nhere and a LOCK over there and ...&quot; \n\nOf course authentication issues get weird because now the publisher is\nstanding in for you...so this might not work really in practice.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
