Every REST API\n&gt; out there has some kind of HTML description document listing how to generate\n&gt; the URIs, the allowed methods, etc.\n\nAs you know... allowed methods is supposed to be exposed by an HTTP\nresource.\n\n\nHow to generate URIs? Well that&#39;s defined in a POST right? And the\nPOST should be declared in an HTML FORM which you&#39;ve read with a GET\non the parent resource. It doesn&#39;t have to be HTML... though you could\npossibly use content-negotiation to force an HTML representation. A\nFORM is also a microformat, so I&#39;d expect to see one in XML sometimes.\n\nThe input to a POST should either be a bunch of parameters (defined in\nthe FORM with INPUTs) or some mime type that makes it obvious what to\nsend.\n\nI agree the latter is a bit of fudge. But some of the time it would be\nobvious; imagine:\n\n   &lt;FORM method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;/somerestws/&quot; enctype=&quot;image/jpg&quot;/&gt;\n\nOther times it&#39;s not so obvious:\n\n   &lt;FORM method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;/somerestws/&quot; enctype=&quot;application/xml&quot;/&gt;\n\nBut then maybe that should use the 2 stage commit pattern as well. Or\njust not be done.\n\nNote also that once the URI relationships have been understood an\napplication could simply just PUT the new URI.\n\n\nSo what I&#39;m saying is that an implementation of REST on top of HTTP\nand with the patterns that have been shown on this list (like 2 stage\ncommit) would be constrained enough that a client application could\nunderstand everything it needed.\n\nClearly, an implementation not constrained enough wouldn&#39;t offer\nthat.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
