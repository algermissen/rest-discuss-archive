The same functionality should have been accomplished via \nanonymous authentication and true client-side state. A state mechanism \nthat involves preferences can be more efficiently implemented using \njudicious use of context-setting URI rather than cookies, where \njudicious means one URI per state rather than an unbounded number of URI \ndue to the embedding of a user-id. Likewise, the use of cookies to \nidentify a user-specific &quot;shopping basket&quot; within a server-side database \ncould be more efficiently implemented by defining the semantics of \nshopping items within the hypermedia data formats, *allowing the user \nagent to select and store those items within their own client-side \nshopping basket, complete with a URI to be used for check-out when the \nclient is ready to purchase*&#39;&#39;\n\nIMHO, REST Chapter 6 is very valuable, and often ignored.\n\nBest, Nathan\n\nMoore, Jonathan (CIM) wrote:\n&gt; I think we need to separate the questions: &quot;is this self-descriptive?&quot; from &quot;is this a good way to do shopping cart ordering?&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a very specific definition of self-descriptive (from a REST point-of-view) in Roy&#39;s thesis that this request passes. There are a whole bunch of other constraints that aren&#39;t part of REST that are needed for an e-commerce system that it almost certainly doesn&#39;t, including non-repudiation, transparency of intent, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m *not* arguing you should build shopping carts this way; I&#39;m just arguing it fits the very specific, technical definition of self-descriptive. REST isn&#39;t a magic wand--meeting its constraints doesn&#39;t guarantee you&#39;ve built a suitable system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jon\n&gt; ........\n&gt; Jon Moore\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Aug 26, 2012, at 3:10 AM, &quot;Bob&quot; &lt;bhaugen32@...&lt;mailto:bhaugen32@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I lost a long argument with Mark Baker a year and a half ago on this very subject and scenario.\n&gt; \n&gt; I argued that including the URL to a saved offer-to-buy in a message to convert it into an order was adequately self-descriptive.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the discussion, I accepted Mark&#39;s position, and abandoned my own.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I thought of another reason that convinced me even more of the correctness of Mark&#39;s argument from a business standpoint, and that is non-repudiation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation\n&gt; \n&gt; That is, if both parties to an electronic agreement send, receive and sign each of the full messages exchanged in the dialog, maybe even exchanging the whole built-up sequence each time, they have a record of the agreement that would be difficult for either party to repudiate.\n&gt; \n&gt; This reason may not have been Roy&#39;s reason for including self-descriptive messages as a REST constraint, but it would be important in business contract situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
