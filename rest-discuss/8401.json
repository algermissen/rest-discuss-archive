Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt;\nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; So, people who advocate &quot;resource-oriented&quot; as an end in itself,\n&gt; a=\r\ns if the only thing you need to build a network-based application\n&gt; is a UR=\r\nI template and resource definition language, are just fooling\n&gt; themselves =\r\ninto thinking what they are doing is REST.  Resources\n&gt; are just one part o=\r\nf the style.  Resources are necessary for REST,\n&gt; but resources must be all=\r\nowed to evolve independently from the\n&gt; clients and the only way that can h=\r\nappen is when the clients are\n&gt; expecting to be instructed by the next repr=\r\nesentation received.\n\nSo, since the XML result returned by the Atom Publish=\r\ning Protocol does\nnot include hyperlinks with each entry for deleting that =\r\nentry, or\nupdating it, or inserting a new entry (or some equivalent way of\n=\r\nrepresenting the allowable state transitions), then APP is not fully\nRESTfu=\r\nl; since it does not comply with the &quot;Hypermedia as the Engine\nof Applicati=\r\non State&quot; (HEAS) constraint?\n\nI think I understand how REST works for UA2AA=\r\n (User Agent to Automated\nAgent) protocols. Are there any examples of AA2AA=\r\n (Automated Agent to\nAutomated Agent) REST protocols in production that rea=\r\nlly do HEAS\nright? Tim Ewald&#39;s hypothetical example of a flight reservation=\r\n\nprotocol helped, but it&#39;s a toy example, not a real production example.\n\n-=\r\n- Nick\n\n\n"}}
