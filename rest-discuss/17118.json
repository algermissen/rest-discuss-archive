With SOAP/WSDL you are given \neverything up front and have to figure out what to use when. With REST you \nare only served the links that fits the actual state. You cannot do the last \nwith WSDL.\n\nThanks, for the feedback everybody.\n\n&gt; That said, I think the benefit of this form is it avoid, at least a \n&gt; little, the early binding that WADL or WSDL have.\n\nI guess that depends on how you consume the XForm. I would take the \nreferenced XML schema in the model definition and automatically create \nclasses from it. That would, with my knowledge, help me a lot getting \nstarted consuming the resource. That would be compile type coupling. It is \nstill, from my point of view, easier to work with a native class \nrepresentation of the model then with the bare XML itself.\n\nBut, again, using XForm certainly avoids early binding of the application \nflow.\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, December 23, 2010 3:54 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: XForms vs. WSDL?\n\n\n\nHello.\nI still look for someone that explains in clear terms why is WSDL so bad. At \nthe end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which is not the case lately. \nActually, it never was, as document style services should be the ones to \nuse. Oh, well.\n\nWhy is WSDL needed? To describe the actual service consumption process. \nWhere do we find the service? Where do we find the document format we need \nto send or expect to receive? Where do we find the message send a receive \npattern? It is there, in the WSDL.\n\nNow, REST allows that flow to be discovered, rather than written in one \nplace. Ian&#39;s description of the use of XForms achieves that, so they are \nsimilar in the goal, may not be so similar in the process. Both will \nrequired some out-of-band information. XForms is not forcing the POST \nmethod, actually. Is is a way to describe the expected data in a known \nformat, reducing coupling. You may later change the XFORM given some data \nfor the request is changed, and nothing breaks (as a matter of fact, with \nWSDL should happen the same, but people use compile time binding, stubs, \nthat break that possibility).\n\nThat said, I think the benefit of this form is it avoid, at least a little, \nthe early binding that WADL or WSDL have. So, you are creating totally \ndynamic clients instead of static ones, pre-build with stubs and things like \nthat. There is still one problem to solve, though, the semantics of the data \nfields in the Form. But that should be managed as a pre defined context, \nwith a general, agreed upon, glossary.\n\nCheers.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J�rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading Ian Robinsons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (again, it&#39;s a \n&gt; good\n&gt; read) at http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/.\n&gt; Here he introduces the idea of adding XForms to a link relation, such that\n&gt; instead of having only:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;link rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; and document out of band how to post data to that link, one could have an\n&gt; XForm at the end of the link and then use that information as the\n&gt; online/inline/in-band documentation. I think that&#39;s quite a neat idea, but\n&gt; it strikes me that it&#39;s getting awfull close to a WSDL spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both XForm and WSDL defines how to POST data adhering to a specific XML\n&gt; schema. If you then add a list of links to XForms, the list would be much\n&gt; like the WSDL list of methods/messages. The rel=&quot;&quot; types would specify \n&gt; WSDL\n&gt; message names.\n&gt;\n&gt; In all we could  have an HTML 5 list like the one below and call it the \n&gt; WSDL\n&gt; method list:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;dl&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;dd&gt;Description&lt;/dd&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/dl&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Each of the achors then points to an XForm which in turn points to an XML\n&gt; schema definition and defines POST urls - just like WSDL does.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this good or bad? Is it better or worse than WSDL and WADL? Other\n&gt; opinions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, J�rn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
