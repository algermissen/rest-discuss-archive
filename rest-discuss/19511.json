I&#39;m all for that, IF we can be reasonably sure that the current data can fit comfortably into that simplified model.\n&gt; The current hints that use &quot;complex&quot; objects are (keeping in mind that we&#39;ve just started):\n&gt;   - formats\n&gt;   - links\n&gt;   - accept-post (same format as formats)\n&gt;   - auth-schemes\n&gt; Formats and accept-post COULD specify a list of strings, and state that it&#39;s either a media type OR a profile URI. This means we&#39;d need a separate representation format for profiles, which would need to convey a media type.\n&gt; This is certainly possible, but the downsides I see are:\n&gt;    - It&#39;s baking in profiles in at a pretty high level. I like some aspects of profiles, but they certainly haven&#39;t taken off in mindshare yet.\n&gt;    - Parsing the string to check which it is is nasty.\n&gt; For auth-schemes, we&#39;d need to specify a tuple, probably. Not great, but OK. Extensibility would be right out the window, though, which may be significant for some schemes.\n&gt; Links are fundamentally not possible without some really ugly mapping to a string, I think.\n\ni guess that&#39;s true. but i have to admit that i am struggling a bit with \nthat specific hint anyway. it can hint at links you might find at the \ntarget resource. it may contain hints, so it can also contain link \nhints. so in theory, you could build a multi-level structure of links to \nbe expected several link traversals away, right?\n\nmore generally speaking, i am having troubles rationalizing hints that \ngive me some &quot;preview&quot; of the target resource. my personal mental model \nof link hints is that they constrain interactions with the target \nresource, but really don&#39;t tell you what to expect.\n\nis http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03#section-9 \n(the separation into &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;representation&quot; hints in the home \ndraft, where the link hint idea started) what might make te difference \nbetween hints talking about interactions, and hints talking about the \nresult of an interaction?\n\n&gt; My concern is that this is starting not to meet my use cases for json-home, which is where link-hints comes from.\n\nthat would be bad, but again, i am struggling a bit with the hints that \ntell you what to expect, and not just what to do. my thoughts were that \nhints should just be about what to do; do you have a different model in \nmind?\n\n&gt; While I could address this by making those things NOT link hints, but other &quot;bumps&quot; on json-home, it would make it significantly more complex. That seems like a poor tradeoff, considering that it&#39;s *possible* to map generic hints into XML, it&#39;s just not &quot;pretty.&quot;\n&gt; To be brutally frank (and I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t going to surprise you too much, dret ;) I don&#39;t see a lot of value in catering to the XML API market; it&#39;s dying, and introducing constraints on the JSON APIs seems like a bad tradeoff.\n\nyes, i am not overly surprised ;) but i am not really trying to optimize \nthis for XML, i just try to make it more workable for non-JSON consumers \nin general. and i am still hoping that somebody will be able to point to \nprior decisions that were made in similar situations: are there IANA \nregistries that are using JSON as a data model for their entries, and \nwhich other approaches were taken in cases where registries attempted to \nregister structured entries? maybe we should just use ASN.1... ;-)\n\n&gt; I absolutely acknowledge that JSON will one day face its own demise, and will be in a similar situation, but planning for that seems like premature optimisation to me.\n\nsure, and if the consensus is that it&#39;s ok to have JSON-based \nregistries, then this is how it is. personally, i think i will then use \nserialized JSON in XML representations, which are a little less horrible \nto look at than generic JSON serialized in JSON.\n\n&gt;&gt; but again, of course my option (c) means that link hints have a predefined and probably small set of structures that hints can use to expose whatever they want to expose, and if they want to go beyond that, that&#39;s not covered by the link hint framework anymore.\n&gt; Yes. That&#39;s what I&#39;m struggling with. We&#39;re already seeing a number of places that chafe against these constraints, and we&#39;re just getting started.\n&gt; What do other folks think?\n\ngood point, so far it&#39;s just mark and me. anybody who faced similar \ndesign issues who could share their considerations and decisions?\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
