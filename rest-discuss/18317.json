This is where I see a subtle\nrift in the space-time continuum that threatens to divide RESTafarians\neverywhere. There&#39;s choices in resources as gateways into larger HATEOS\nframeworks or as those subtler resources themselves, resources as APIs\nthemselves, and so on, all along the scale of correctness from bad to good;\nthe only semantics that REST cares about is &quot;process this&quot;. Whatever you\nplace on top is your business, and exist in the ontology layer (with vocab\nnames / schemas / RDF(x) / whatever.\n\nAgain; it is *important* to point out that *REST* has no more semantics on\na resource than &quot;process this&quot;. Get this wrong, and you start blaming REST\nfor problems that exists elsewhere.\n\n&gt; The key is that those\n&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived\n&gt; only from the shared understanding between client and server. That&#39;s\n&gt; not a violation of REST constraints or the HTTP spec, it&#39;s a small\n&gt; clarification.\n\nYou think it is small. Some of us think it is subtle - for sure - but\nrather important. As soon as you think REST (or your favourite REST\nimplementation, like HTTP) carries semantics outside of the generic methods\nand the generic response codes, you will blame it for all of your own\nfailings, and you might just miss out on the magic of REST in the process.\n\nAgain, all those semantics you talk about are supposed to be in the\ncontent-type of the request and the content negotiation with given\nresources. This is one area in which cool URIs are misleading.\n\n&gt; I definitely agree though, there are some REST constraints and\n&gt; concepts that are misused. This seems to happen frequently with terms\n&gt; like &#39;visibility&#39; and &#39;self-descriptive&#39; :)\n\nWell, I personally think that most people who understand REST, do not\nunderstand REST, most probably myself included. It&#39;s a nice set of\nconstraints and methods that, when combined, gives awesome benefits, but\ntrying to explain the whole cake by pointing out its ingrediants will never\nconvince anyone.\n\nThe terms you point to are, in fact, quite often used more correct when\nspoken, but not so much when heard, but that&#39;s just a side effect of having\npoorly separated the REST fundamentals from the ontology and the\napplication specific noise. In terms of REST, visibility and portions being\nself-descriptive is spot on - but in a strict REST sense, not the ontology\nsense.\n\nIn other words, I can claim that POST on a given resource is\nself-descriptive, as in &quot;process this&quot;, but when other people hear me say\nit, it comes across as &quot;the ontology payload describes the resource and its\nlinks&quot;, which is a different beast all-together.\n\nAnyway, that was a long-winded way of agree with you on that sentiment. :)\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n\r\n--0015174be5a20a473004b59dc119\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hola,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mike Kelly&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekelly321@g=\r\nmail.com&quot;&gt;mikekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; No, not in this pa=\r\nrticular case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I dare say, that is your opinion, of course.
