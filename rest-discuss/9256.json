For example, I&#39;m implementing a referral program where the user enters a \n&gt; list of names and addresses into an HTML form and then picks from a list of rewards. After \n&gt; each step, I need to perform server-side validation. Only after the second stage validation \n&gt; occurs can the &quot;transaction&quot; be considered complete and committed. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve \n&gt; considered thus far:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /referrals: gets an empty form in which users enter referral names and emails\n&gt; POST /referrals: submits the referral form data (names and emails) and returns a 201 \n&gt; Location: /referrals/{id}, where {id} is the server generated-id for this set of referrals or a 409 \n&gt; if the validation failed, displaying the original name/email form with inline error messages\n&gt; GET /referrals/{id}: based on the previous post, the server knows that the referral names and \n&gt; addresses have been entered, so the user gets a new form to select a reward (essentially \n&gt; customizing the representation based on the state of the resource)\n&gt; POST /referrals/{id}: submit _only_ the reward data to update the referral resource (e.g. \n&gt; partial PUT without the religious war).\n\nWhy not just:\nGET /referals\nPOST /referrals - 200 with entity including the data from the request in \nhidden fields.\nPOST /referrals_step_2 - 303 to created resource.\n\nThis means that no resource is created in the intermeditary stage, so \nthe transaction being abandoned has no side-effects, even in so far as \norphaned resources.\n\nThe big downside to acting directly on an entity retrieved from a POST \nis that since does not represent a resource, but rather the results of \nan entity being POSTed to a resource, it can not be referred to \n(bookmarks etc.). However in this case we are only interested in this \nhalf-constructed item while we are using this wizzard. There is no value \nin a half-constructed resource outside of this context, so no value in \ncreating a resource at this stage.\n\n\n"}}
