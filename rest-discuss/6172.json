Townley&quot; &lt;andrew.townley@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Back to the scalability issue, you actually do have this sort of issue\n&gt; with web pages as well, it&#39;s just that the cost of replicating the\n&gt; current state of the resource to across a server farm is much less\n&gt; because those resources don&#39;t change often, and if they do change,\n&gt; people may be able to live with stale information for a short period of\n&gt; time until the replication process is complete.\n\nWith a session based model the state has to be distributed and locking\nmechanisms put in place to ensure transactional consistency.\n\nWith REST, you can maintain the state of the resource in the resource\nand simply redirect people to the correct resource.\n\nFor example. If the bank app is session based then I have to\ndistribute the data on currently extant sessions across the\nserverbase.\n\nWith REST I can simply store the data in a resource (not necessarily a\nfile) and have any server recieving a request send a redirect to the\nuser pointing them at the server owning the resource pertinent to\nthem.\n\nIn effect one partitions the resource namespace and tells the client\nabout it.\n\nNow I think of it though this would be possible with session\ntoo... it&#39;s just that none of the session load balancers that I&#39;m\naware of does it that way. Maybe this is because such a partitioning\nscheme would have to be embedded in the application.\n\n\n\n&gt; One final point, and I know this has gotten longer than I intended, in\n&gt; maintaining all of the context in the exchange between the client and\n&gt; the server on the client, you have a massive trust dependency on the\n&gt; information you get from the client not being changed between their\n&gt; browser and your server.  Of course, you can solve this with HTTPS, but\n&gt; should browsing and putting items in a cart actually require HTTPS to\n&gt; establish that trust?  I don&#39;t think they necessarily should.  Checking\n&gt; out would require strong authentication, but putting items in the cart\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t necessarily.\n\nI think it should be secure if we can make it that way. Right now\npeople don&#39;t want to pay the cost of TLS all the time, but they&#39;ll\nhave to if they want privacy and security because it&#39;s really the only\nway.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
