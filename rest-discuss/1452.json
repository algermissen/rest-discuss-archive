But in what sense is \nit\n&gt; &quot;transactions in general&quot; and what exact definition \nof &quot;transactions&quot;\n&gt; are you using? Is there a way we could avoid that word so as not to\n&gt; confuse people?\n\nActually, I like using the word &quot;transaction&quot; in this case. \nDatabase people took the word from business in the first place.\nAnd then narrowed the definition something awful.  \nI think it&#39;s acceptable to consider other protocols besides 2-phase \ncommit to be transactions.\n\nEven in business, the word has several meanings.\n\nThe phrase I used is &quot;state-alignment transaction&quot;.\nWhich means that at the end of the transaction, both parties must \nagree on whether the transaction succeeded or not.\nI think that&#39;s all you can do with a simple Internet interaction, \nalthough I&#39;m always ready to be proved wrong.\n\nThe sense in which it is a transaction-in-general is that it is an \natomic unit of work.  \n\nThe relationship between state-alignment transactions and database \ntransactions is that the state-alignment transaction operates in the \nshared space of the Internet, but any database transactions are the \nprivate and protected business of each of the trading partners.\n\nMore on database updates below.  \n\n&gt; &gt; Oh, but I *do* mean a unit of work, in the sense of two trading\n&gt; &gt; partners coming to agreement on advancing a business deal to the \nnext\n&gt; &gt; state.  Each business transaction succeeds or fails as a whole.\n\n&gt; Okay, but people often mean transactions in this sense: &quot;I want to \nbe\n&gt; able to take an arbitrary number of state-changing operations and \nensure\n&gt; that the succeed or fail as a single operation.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT X\n&gt; PUT Y\n&gt; POST Z\n&gt; PUT A\n&gt; POST B\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But only do ANY of these things if you can guarantee ALL will \nsucceed.&quot;\n\n&gt; This is tricky in distributed systems because it requires that the\n&gt; server trust that the client will not lock up too many resources and\n&gt; then disappear.\n\nExactly.  RosettaNet went through this same conversation we (and W3C) \nare having now in early 1999.  They started out trying to do 2-phase \ncommit over the Internet and found it was a very bad idea.  \n\nThen they came up with the state-alignment transaction protocol by \nstudying the UNECE and ABA requirements again.  \n\nThe idea is that all the tricky database updates listed above should \nbe done in somebody&#39;s private and protected space.  For example, in \nthe offer-acceptance transaction, the responding party may need to do \na lot operations before coming back with an acceptance.  If any of \nthose operations fail, the responding party must reject the offer.\n\nIn other words, all you can do (and all you usually need to do) in \nthe shared space is synchronize two parties at a time.  If you have a \nsituation like the travel agent, where many legs of a trip must be \nbooked, you need something like a temporary hold.  In fact, the \ntravel industry provides such a feature.  You can put reservations on \nhold for e.g. 24 hours and assemble the legs of the trip and ask the \ntraveler to approve it, and then go back and book everything.  They \nprovided the feature for the same kinds of reasons it is useful in an \nInternet business conversation:  you&#39;re crossing administrative \nboundaries.\n\nI mean, that is one of the limitations of this kind of transaction \nprotocol.  I think if you really need to synchronize more than two \nactivities at the same time, you need something more complex.  But \nyou will pay for it.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had conversations with accountants and \nlawyers who say that well-formed business contracts have the same \ncharacteristic:  however many parties may be involved, all \ncommitments can and should be broken down into two-parties.  \n\nThanks again for the dialog,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
