I don&#39;t claim to be a REST wizard, but I&#39;ve\nbeen following this discussion for 3 months, and I haven&#39;t known anyone\nto suggest such a thing. In fact, one of the core principles of REST as\nI understand it is that the implementation of a REST resource is opaque\nto the client, which implies that it would be quite appropriate to \ngenerate a representation using any of the above technologies.\n\nOr are you referring to the fact that CGI apps and such tend to use a\nlot of query strings? But that&#39;s really a matter of common usage, not\nan intrinsic feature of any of those technologies. And it seems to me\nthat the consensus--to the extent there is one--is that query strings \nare discouraged because they obscure the relationships between resources,\nbut are by no means forbidden. \n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
