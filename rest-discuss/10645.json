REST is a style for network architecture.\n\nwhat you ARE seeing is hypermedia, which is hardly surprising... the\noriginal intent for hypermedia WAS for such things. See the orignal\nhypermedia paper by Ted Nelson*\n\nAs for the uniform interface, that is plain common sense for such a\nsmall device.\n\n\nRegards\ndevdatta\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 18/04/2008, yadnem &lt;r.menday@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;  I blogged about the way I think about REST at\n&gt;  http://thegridisawebapplication.blogspot.com/2008/04/rest-and-ipod.html\n&gt;  (content inlined below)\n&gt;  I would like to know from you guys how badly wrong I am ?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Roger\n&gt;\n&gt;  ---\n&gt;\n&gt;  Something occurred to me a while back, which I choose not to mention,\n&gt;  essentially because if I had it badly wrong, I would embarrass myself.\n&gt;  But, I googled a bit, and didn&#39;t find the analogy made elsewhere, so I\n&gt;  don&#39;t have confirmation from the REST experts.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have 2nd generation iPod nano (not that the version matters), and as\n&gt;  I navigate around the interface, I see something which in lots of\n&gt;  places seem to be RESTful design. Firstly it seems to have a uniform\n&gt;  interface. Furthermore, as I go through &#39;music-&gt;artists-&gt;elvis&#39;, etc\n&gt;  ... I am navigating links. This is &quot;connectedness&quot; as described in\n&gt;  RESTful Web Services. Actually, I would like to see more from the Pod\n&gt;  in this direction - for example, for the song I am currently listening\n&gt;  to, it would be nice to see how this is linked into which playlist,\n&gt;  genre, etc. This would be going in the linked data direction.\n&gt;  Furthermore, I believe I see a very nice example of the mysterious\n&gt;  hypermedia as the engine of application state, in, for example, the\n&gt;  stopwatch function of the ipod.\n&gt;\n&gt;                    \n\n"}}
