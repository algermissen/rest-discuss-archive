Thanks also goes to Mark for point\n&gt; that standardizing URI st=\r\nructure is counter to the constraints laid out\n&gt; in the REST model.  Mark, =\r\ndo you remember where that is specified in\n&gt; Fieldings paper?  Apparently I=\r\n have more homework to do...\n\nIt&#39;s the &quot;hypermedia as the engine of applica=\r\ntion state&quot; constraint, AIUI;\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/disser=\r\ntation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2\n\n&gt; Even if standardizing the URI isn&#39;t R=\r\nESTful, perhaps it could be\n&gt; something that may be useful when applied to =\r\nREST.  Just as if you are\n&gt; writing a contact page, using hCard would be a =\r\ngood idea, but if you\n&gt; don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re giving up XHTML confo=\r\nrmance.\n\nI don&#39;t think so, because any standardization on URI structure wou=\r\nld\nmean that relationships between resources aren&#39;t being made explicit\nin =\r\nthe data.  Amoungst other things, that means that all the resources\nreferre=\r\nd to via this standardization would be invisible to software\nthat didn&#39;t kn=\r\now about it.  Like spiders.  IMO, it&#39;s one of the more\ncostly of REST&#39;s con=\r\nstraints to ignore from a Web POV, and from the\nPOV of trying to roll out n=\r\new functionality incrementally without\nlosing any network effects that norm=\r\nally come For Free.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
