For usability reasons, I=\r\n think an article\n&gt;&gt;&gt; translated into different languages should each have =\r\na different URI\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for each language. Likewise for usability I think the P=\r\nDF form of an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; article should have a different URI from the HTML form. I=\r\n do think\n&gt;&gt;&gt; content negotiation would be OK for things like deciding betw=\r\neen GIF\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and PNF for an image, i.e., for forms of content that are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\ncommodities&quot; or very substitutable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know what you mean especially f=\r\nrom an usability perspective given\n&gt;&gt; the current state of affairs [3] but =\r\nthere is a cost involved in  \n&gt;&gt; doing\n&gt;&gt; this as you might end up fragment=\r\ning your resource space. Say one of\n&gt;&gt; the articles on your website was abo=\r\nut an &quot;Interview with Mr. Foo  \n&gt;&gt; Bar&quot;\n&gt;&gt; and you had two versions of it, =\r\none in English\n&gt;&gt; (http://artima.com/articles/en/interview-with-foo-bar.htm=\r\nl) and\n&gt;&gt; another in French\n&gt;&gt; (http://artima.com/articles/fr/interview-wit=\r\nh-foo-bar.html). Now\n&gt;&gt; suppose this article is viewed a lot by your Englis=\r\nh speaking  \n&gt;&gt; audience\n&gt;&gt; and they happen to point to it from various pla=\r\nces on the web, you  \n&gt;&gt; end\n&gt;&gt; up undervaluing the French version which is=\r\n actually the same\n&gt;&gt; resource. Apart from this, request-headers give us a =\r\nstandard way to\n&gt;&gt; parametrize the request and get to the different represe=\r\nntations\n&gt;&gt; whereas buy putting this information in the URI in a non-standa=\r\nrd way\n&gt;&gt; makes its harder to get to the other representations.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Examp=\r\nle:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://artima.com/articles/interview-with-foo-bar\n&gt;&gt; Accept: text=\r\n/html\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By changing the Accept header to application/pdf like so\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nhttp://artima.com/articles/interview-with-foo-bar\n&gt;&gt; Accept: application/pd=\r\nf\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a client can easily get to the other format. Similarly, if the Fren=\r\nch\n&gt;&gt; speaking reader visits the site he is automatically (provided his\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nbrowser is setup properly) presented the french version of the\n&gt;&gt; article. =\r\nIf this was not the case and since the French version was\n&gt;&gt; undervalued (d=\r\nue to the lack of links pointing to it), he might have\n&gt;&gt; ended up finding =\r\nthe English version through a search engine and then\n&gt;&gt; would have to choos=\r\ne (using a non-standard way) the French version.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://www.ics.u=\r\nci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/\n&gt;&gt; evaluation.htm#sec_6_2_1\n&gt;&gt; [2] http=\r\n://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/#URI-persistence\n&gt;&gt; [3] http://s=\r\nandeep.shetty.in/2006/04/browserland-http.html\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; What you describe sound=\r\n to me like the approach envisioned by the\n&gt; HTTP designers when they desig=\r\nned content negotiation, and in Roy\n&gt; Fielding&#39;s dissertation when he discu=\r\nsses REST. I would contest your\n&gt; statement, &quot;a client can easily get to th=\r\ne other format,&quot; and suggest\n&gt; that is the main usability problem with cont=\r\nent negotiation as\n&gt; envisioned in the HTTP spec and REST.\n\nWhoa, I think t=\r\nhis is a case of reading too much into my dissertation.\nThe sites that I pr=\r\noduce *always* separate languages into separate\nURI trees.  Day Software&#39;s =\r\nCommuniqu=E9 product specializes in  \nmultilingual\nsites and defaults to se=\r\nparate trees. E.g., if you follow a link to\n\n    http://www.day.com/\n\nthen =\r\nthe site will redirect according to the user&#39;s preference to one of\n\n    ht=\r\ntp://www.day.com/site/en/index.html\n    http://www.day.com/site/de/index.ht=\r\nml\n\nand those pages, in turn, link to all three.  We are a Swiss company an=\r\nd\nexperts at multilingual sites.\n\nIn general, I avoid content negotiation w=\r\nithout redirects like the\nplague because of its effect on caching.\n\nNow, se=\r\nction 6.2.1 does not say that content negotiation should be\nused all the ti=\r\nme.  It says\n\n    The definition of resource in REST is based on a simple p=\r\nremise:\n    identifiers should change as infrequently as possible. Because\n=\r\n    the Web uses embedded identifiers rather than link servers, authors\n   =\r\n need an identifier that closely matches the semantics they intend by\n    a=\r\n hypermedia reference, allowing the reference to remain static even\n    tho=\r\nugh the result of accessing that reference may change over time.\n    REST a=\r\nccomplishes this by defining a resource to be the semantics of\n    what the=\r\n author intends to identify, rather than the value  \ncorresponding\n    to t=\r\nhose semantics at the time the reference is created. It is then\n    left to=\r\n the author to ensure that the identifier chosen for a\n    reference does i=\r\nndeed identify the intended semantics.\n\nIn practice, multilingual sites rar=\r\nely place equivalent content in\nmultiple languages on negotiated URIs witho=\r\nut an explicit redirect.\nAside from the fact that Accept-Charset is rarely =\r\nconfigured properly,\nthe fact is that different languages do not produce eq=\r\nuivalents.\nThere are hundreds of nuances, colloquialisms, and shared social=\r\n\nnorms that simply do not translate.  We encourage resource owners\nto only =\r\nuse true content negotiation (without redirects) when the\nonly difference b=\r\netween formats is mechanical in nature.\n\n&gt; The situation with HTML and PDF =\r\nrepresentations of an article, which\n&gt; you also described, is similar. Alth=\r\nough je ne parle pas Francais, I\n&gt; do use both PDF and HTML, so I can use m=\r\nyself as an example user. I\n&gt; prefer HTML for on screen reading, but PDF fo=\r\nr printing. For longer\n&gt; written works--article length and longer--I prefer=\r\n to print and read\n&gt; on paper. I have printed Roy Fielding&#39;s thesis out, fo=\r\nr example. I\n&gt; would have preferred to actually get a PDF version of that t=\r\nhesis for\n&gt; printing, but I didn&#39;t see one.\n\nHuh, that is getting to be a F=\r\nAQ.  I have no idea why people can&#39;t see\nthe second and third link on the t=\r\nop page\n\n    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\n\nth=\r\nat point to the two PDF editions.  *shrug*\n\n&gt; Some things that I can imagin=\r\ne doing as-envisioned content\n&gt; negotiation on are things that really are i=\r\nnformation commodities\n&gt; from the perspective of the user, such as PNG and =\r\nGIF. Either one you\n&gt; send should provide the user with the same experience=\r\n, and the user\n&gt; probably doesn&#39;t care which one the browser uses to constr=\r\nuct the\n&gt; image it displays. So here it seems fine to me to do content\n&gt; ne=\r\ngotiation as envisioned by HTTP. Note that in this case, what you\n&gt; are rea=\r\nlly negotiating with is the user agent, not the user.\n&gt;\n&gt; One place I&#39;m not=\r\n sure which way to go is with a version of a URI fit\n&gt; for small screens, s=\r\nuch as Blackberries. I could just adjust the page\n&gt; when I guess from the r=\r\nequest that they are on a small screen, or I\n&gt; could include a link to a sm=\r\nall screen version. But that would really\n&gt; mean there&#39;s two different sets=\r\n of pages, one for desktop computers\n&gt; and laptops, and one for mobile devi=\r\nces. I haven&#39;t figured out what\n&gt; to do in this case, but I think that allo=\r\nwing access from mobile\n&gt; devices will be important, and suspect that just =\r\nsending the same\n&gt; thing to big and small screens won&#39;t make users happy. I=\r\n welcome\n&gt; suggestions.\n\nMobile devices usually have a different set of int=\r\neresting\ntransitions (links), different artwork, and often different conten=\r\nt.\nI usually treat them the same way as different languages.  Note that,\nli=\r\nke the home page above, the &quot;cool URI&quot; entry points that get\npublished on o=\r\nther sites/email/papers are all negotiated, but result\nin a redirect to the=\r\n language+device view of preference.\n\n....Roy\n"}}
