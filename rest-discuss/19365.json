But even that doesn&#39;t quite go far enough until yo=\r\nu define what an &quot;application&quot; is and understand what &quot;state&quot; is. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lot=\r\ns of web developers think an &quot;application&quot; is &quot;the code I wrote in Python o=\r\nr Ruby that runs on the server.&quot; But that is worlds apart from the way Roy =\r\nuses it. He uses it in its original sense of &quot;accomplishing a goal with som=\r\nething&quot;. Building a house is an application of (among other things) boards,=\r\n nails, and a hammer. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lots of web developers think that &quot;state&quot; means=\r\n &quot;data in my database&quot;. But that is worlds apart from the way Roy uses it. =\r\nHe uses it in its original sense of &quot;the current node in a state machine.&quot; =\r\nLet&#39;s say you supply boards and nails. If my application is &quot;building a hou=\r\nse&quot;, the &quot;state&quot; of my application is not how many boards and nails you hav=\r\ne. It is not even how many boards and nails I have. It is how much of my ho=\r\nuse has been built. The state is advanced by building walls and assembling =\r\nthem together. Those have sub-states, some of which involve buying more boa=\r\nrds and nails. \n&gt; \n&gt; The interaction between me and you is &quot;stateless&quot; if I=\r\n can buy boards and nails from you without you knowing anything about how m=\r\nuch of my house has been built, or even if my application of what you provi=\r\nde is &quot;building a house&quot;. If I have to talk to the same sales rep every tim=\r\ne then it&#39;s not stateless. If I&#39;ve bought 100 board feet and you pre-order =\r\nanother 900 board feet from your vendor because I&#39;m building a house then i=\r\nt&#39;s not stateless. If you keep 1000 board feet on hand because building a h=\r\nouse is a very common operation, then it might be stateless, because your b=\r\nusiness doesn&#39;t know anything about my application. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now let&#39;s say you=\r\n not only provide boards and nails, but also hammers, and plans, and labor,=\r\n and installation. In fact, the house is built by you on your property. But=\r\n I get to pick out the floorplan and curtain colors. The application has no=\r\nt changed. The state machine has not changed. The methods used to advance t=\r\nhe application from one state to the next have not changed. What has change=\r\nd? \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Who does which activity to advance the state machine. Most of i=\r\nt used to be me. Now most of it is you. \n&gt; 2) Where the current node of the=\r\n state machine is kept; that is, how much of my house has been built. That =\r\ninformation used to be kept on my property. Now it is kept on your property=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; The interaction between me and you can no longer be &quot;stateless&quot; bec=\r\nause you know how much of my house has been built. If I ask you to change t=\r\nhe floorplan or the curtain colors, first you have to authenticate me, and =\r\nthen you have to go to the property to inspect the state to see if you can =\r\ncomply with the request. That&#39;s two scalability problems you didn&#39;t have be=\r\nfore. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not raking in the dough. But I&#39;m no longer adv=\r\nancing the application state except at two points; in many cases, I&#39;m not e=\r\nven doing that--I&#39;m configuring the application state machine instead.\n\nWow=\r\n!
