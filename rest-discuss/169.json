The identification of the resource that\nchanged and the operation that occurred is what I like. I would also like\nstatus - in order to learn about attempted changes that didn&#39;t happen.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Somehow a physical thermometer changes a byte in RAM or on disk and\n&gt; informs a piece of software that it has done so.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. There is Web gateway software that exposes this byte as a resource:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * http://www.weather.com/90210/temperature : &quot;5&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. The Web gateway software tells anyone who has registered to watch\n&gt; that URL that it has been changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. If they want the new value, they can GET it. Or they could have\n&gt; registered that they want inline values earlier. The notification\n&gt; probably looks like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST www.mymicroserver.com/mysubscriptions/23123\n&gt; Target-URI: http://www.weather.com/90210/temperature\n&gt; HTTP-method: PUT\n&gt;\n&gt; (maybe message body here, maybe not)\n&gt;\n&gt;  5. There is another URI. It *represents* the subscription. If the\n&gt; client just wants to let the subscription peter out, it can ignore that\n&gt; URI. If it wants to actively manage it then it needs to work with the\n&gt; subscription URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is getting too complicated.\n&gt; &gt; Do you have any HTTP event systems to play with? Doing it with real\nworking\n&gt; &gt; code is much much more educational.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, go and grab KnowNow&#39;s event router and bang out some\n&gt; &gt; javascript listeners.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t see any connection point between what we&#39;ve been talking about\n&gt; and what they have implemented. They have a &quot;do_method&quot; thingee that\n&gt; seems basically RPC-ish.\nHey now, I like that do_method thingee. (if they had any balls it would&#39;ve\nbeen do:method)\n\n&gt; The payload is a header? They have explicit\n&gt; event routing? It seems to be inherently peer-to-peer whereas HTTP&#39;s\n&gt; underlying model is client/server. Overall, it seems much more\n&gt; complicated than what I was thinking of.\nSome things had to be sacrificed for browser accessibility.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Most important, I can&#39;t figure out how to do what I want to do which is\n&gt; ask to be notified when a web resource changes its value. As far as I\n&gt; can tell, the &quot;gateway&quot; would have to publish to the &quot;topic&quot;. Merely\n&gt; changing a resource is not sufficient to trigger a message. But maybe I\n&gt; misunderstand that part.\nYes, the KN server is a message server, it hosts subscriptions and routes\nevents. It is not a filter on existing servers.\nSomebody could write a mod_watch that did the same stuff and echoed actual\nHTTP requests (and their responses)\n\nIf you have an application that knows about changes, but isn&#39;t directly URI\naddressable, you can use their stuff to bounce messages around rather than\nimplementing your own subscription/notification system.\n\nHere&#39;s a sample message exchange\n\n-- create a subscription --\nPOST http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/prescod.net/temperature/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\n\ndo_method=route\n&kn_to=http://www.prescod.net/receivers/temperature/\n\n-- some time passes... --\n\n-- post a notification --\nPOST http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/prescod.net/temperature/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\n\nkn_payload=98.6\n\n-- here comes the message --\nPOST http://www.prescod.net/receivers/temperature/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\n\nkn_payload=98.6\n&kn_id=uniqueMessageID\n&kn_time_t=979273892\n&kn_route_id=some_more_useful_stuff\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you are into Java servlets, check out\n&gt; &gt; http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/destiny/ - i&#39;ll see if I can get it\n&gt; &gt; running somewhere public next week.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not really sure that we should use a message queuing paradigm as a\n&gt; starting point. I think that an HTTP API for JMS would turn quite\n&gt; different than a notifications mechanism for the Web.\nCalling out &#39;jms&#39; was just a ploy - I want that project to be an asynch HTTP\nservice implemented as a servlet.\nThat&#39;s one way to get it started - but I&#39;ll ensure RESTfulness as I go.\n\n\n\n"}}
