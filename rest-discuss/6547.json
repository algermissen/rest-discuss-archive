The REST=\r\n Wiki has been very helpful - thanks.\nWhen it comes to identifying things w=\r\nhich try to be or resemble REST\nbut they really are not, I am still green.\n=\r\n\nI am really keen on RIA/AJAX solutions which isolate the presentation\nlaye=\r\nr on the client/browser and integrate with resources the REST way.\n On the =\r\nother hand, I am pretty sure I am not seeing REST in all these\nsessioned, d=\r\nistributed presentation client-server sync solutions which\noperate Http mic=\r\nro-middleware between AJAX engines and server-side\npresentation frameworks.=\r\n  As visually compelling as the Echo2 demos\nare, this debuggable demo\n\nhttp=\r\n://demo.nextapp.com/InteractiveTest/ia?debug\n\nshows the micro-middleware wh=\r\nich is syncing the AJAX Engine with the\nserver and it doesn&#39;t strike me as =\r\nbeing REST or web scale.  It looks\nlike traffic you might see trussing a so=\r\ncket between an X client and\nserver and its clearly stateful.\n\nSometimes I =\r\ndo find what I am looking for, a client side only\npresentation solution\n\nht=\r\ntp://www.jitsu.org/jitsu/guide/approach.html\n\nbut I notice it says\n\n&quot;issues=\r\n an AJAX XmlHttpRequest PUT to send the changes to the server.\nThe PUT requ=\r\nest has a list of &quot;commands&quot; that the server should\nperform to make the nec=\r\nessary modifications&quot;.\n\nThis is not REST (not that the site says it is). Th=\r\nis is an RPC\nprotocol using JSON format. Correct?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
