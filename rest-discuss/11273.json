I\n&gt; don&#39;t see why a non-commital answer would preclude switching the  \n&gt; status code\n&gt; when the resource state becomes determined.\n\nI see what you suggesting. Yes, this is certainly possible, but I  \nwould still question (a) overloading 202 in an unspecified manner, and  \n(b) merging an auxiliary resource with the actual resource. The later  \ncould be confusing to client application developers.\n\n&gt;&gt; By linking the 202 response to an auxiliary resource (such as the\n&gt;&gt; status) that is GETtable, the client has a clearer indication of what\n&gt;&gt; is going on, and a URI to the resource will be made available to the\n&gt;&gt; client if and only if the server has managed to successfully create a\n&gt;&gt; new resource (or delete a resource for the case of DELETE).\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t disagree with the use of an auxiliary resource with its own\n&gt; document, I am asking if such a general problem as async processing\n&gt; resulting in resources in an undetermined state is not better  \n&gt; handled at the\n&gt; http level rather than at the document level.\n\nI think there are two different types of use cases here.\n\na. Resource creation (or deletion) takes significant amount of time/ \nprocessing and hence can not be created/deleted immediately.\n\nb. A resource could be created, but its status may change/evolve as  \nstuff is happening.\n\nFor instance, take a purchase order that needs to go through some  \nbackend processing (may be even manual) to get created completely.  \nThis could be modeled as a regular 200 OK but keep changing relevant  \nparts of the representation to reflect its current status. There is no  \nneed for a 202 here.\n\nYour suggestion is more in the lines of (b), where a 200 OK is just  \nfine.\n\nSubbu\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
