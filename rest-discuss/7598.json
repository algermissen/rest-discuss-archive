I tried figuring out how to do give  \nusers customized versions of pages using JavaScript, as that approach  \nwas suggested to me by some folks on this list. I don&#39;t want to do it  \nthat way for several reasons, but I also couldn&#39;t see how it would be  \npossible. The trouble is: how does a page know which alternate  \nJavaScript URL to grab if the page is always identical? If the page  \nisn&#39;t identical, but only differs in that one URL, then you can&#39;t  \ncache it at one URL without resorting to multiple entities. And if  \nyou&#39;re going to do that, you may as well just put the breadcrumbs on  \nthe page on the server and have each of those versions be entities.\n\nOne thing JS could do differently is look in the cookies, but am I  \nwrong in assuming a cache intermediary would cache all the response  \nheaders too, and send them along (other than perhaps changing a few  \nto indicate the response came from a cache.) If so, then you can&#39;t  \nchange the cookies either without resorting to multiple entities.  \nAgain, if you&#39;re going to do that, why not just have the server put  \nthe breadcrumbs in and call those multiple entities.\n\nIf you force them to log in and they get a session ID cookie, then  \nthat could be accessed by the JS. (But the breadcrumbed page itself  \nwouldn&#39;t set that cookie in its response.) But then you just have one  \nbreadcrumb per user session per URI. And what if they have two  \nbrowsers windows open. This has the same problem using session to  \nhold state always has.\n\nAm I missing some way to do this, or am I correct in concluding it  \nisn&#39;t possible?\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
