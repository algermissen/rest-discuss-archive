Could that assume the form of a link to another\ndocument?  =\r\nEither way would be the moral equivalent of what Roger is\nproposing it seem=\r\ns to me.\n\nWould there be any equivalent of the OPTIONS method?  Or is that =\r\nsort of\nfunctionality deprecated?\n\nRFC2616 mentions that and further specif=\r\nication of OPTIONS is left for\nfuture versions of HTTP. Is there any work c=\r\nurrently underway to further\nrefine that method?\n\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\n"}}
