What I&#39;m going to write here is a fairly rambling note\nto explore related issues.  I am hoping that others will help tease apart the\nissues, which I have found interesting but easy to get lost in.\n\nAsynch mode matters a lot.  We can&#39;t live without it.\n\nAsynch HTTP is a funny idea.  There seem to be incompatibilities large and\nsmall.\n\nWithout asynch HTTP, there is no asynch REST.  That is not acceptable.\n\nAsynchronous infrastructure is nearly always too optimistic about the time\nframe -- a coherent thread of messages is assumed to be complete within the\nlifetime of a sending application.  In reality the lifetimes of messages and\nprocesses are different things.  Furthermore, asynch infrastructure is limited\nin scope and generality.  Aside from email, asynch infrastructure is an anarchic\nbag of incompatible technologies like JMS/RMI, proprietary real time financial\ndata protocols, the Gnutella protocol, SOAP 1.2, Jxta, etc ad infinitum.\n\nHTTP and email share a basket of technologies, mainly MIME but also the end to\nend principle and many similar semantics.  It is straightforward to model SMTP\nin terms of HTTP, and not extremely hard to model HTTP in terms of SMTP.  Given\nthat the output of a series of SMTP commands is a MIME message, you can think of\nit as a marginally different animal.  The biggest difference is that SMTP lacks\nsyntactic support for the HTTP target URI header line, as well as having no\nsemantic equivalent.\n\nPOP3 does a clean job of diffentiating a message store from its contents.\n...less so IMAP, which integrates the semantics of text messaging and\nstore-and-forward.\n\nIf the basic message of REST is that, per Jeff Bone, &quot;the *existing*\nWeb and its abstractions and mechanisms --- if used properly ---\nobviate the need for a large number of the things people seem dead-set\non creating new mechanisms to do&quot;, the exact same argument applies to\nefforts to create a newly asynchronous HTTP, which existing email\ninfrastructure obviates much of the need for.  Asynchronous REST\nimplies email for the same reasons that synchronous REST implies the\nweb.\n\nHTTP proxy semantics and SMTP forwarder semantics clash.  SMTP intermediaries\nand endpoints are basically symetrical, while HTTP intermediaries have a\ndedicated role and command set.\n\n...my inclination is to work on mashing together HTTP and SMTP.  Thoughts why\nthis might be a blind alley?  Is there any interest in shared hacking on such a\nproject?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
