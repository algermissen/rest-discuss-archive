The browser&#39;s GUI is that connector for example.  \n\n\n\nI really believe that the nature of this connector between the &quot;user-agent&quot;/&quot;hypermedia processor&quot; and the layer below is absolutely central to media type design. As I was saying in the blog comments, I believe that the messages sent &quot;up&quot; to the user-agent must be designed so that they do not impose processing constraints on the user-agent that are carried over to the service (as this would over-constrain the services preventing service heterogeneity or service evolution).\n\nAnd I am concerned that this goes too far...\n\n\nThe means for doing this is restricting the messages to being events (as opposed to commands as defined here: http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/avoid-command-messages.html ) or if they are commands, they shouldn&#39;t have processing semantics beyond those of the uniform interface. For example, if they message from the &quot;lower&quot; layer was a &quot;BuyBook&quot; command message, then the processing constraints requiring that a book must be ordered would be imposed on the service. A &quot;BookDesired&quot; event would allow an application to do other things (e.g. survey what books clients are interested in).\n\nFirstly, some terminology to clear:  the messages in RESTful HTTP (assuming POST) shouldn&#39;t ever be &quot;command messages&quot;.  They are messages that transfer state without a mandatory action semantic buried in the content (noting that it can happen optionally in some cases, plenty of HTML forms that do it.)    \n\nThe server may interpret such a message as a command, but the user agent needs to look at this purely in terms of data that is expected in the request, and the expected (but not guaranteed) post-conditions that were included in hypermedia surrounding the link relation or in the specification of the link relation itself.\n\nThe link relation may be standardized to domains like &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;order&quot;, which in turn describe the expected effects of transferring state to a denoted processing resource.  I don&#39;t necessarily believe that overly abstract link relations (eg. &quot;desire&quot; over &quot;buy&quot;) are superior, though perhaps we&#39;d have to dig into a concrete example to explore further. \n\n\nThe impact on hypermedia design is that you need to think about how the hypermedia document is translated into the command/document messages to the layer below and how the events coming up are translated into requests to the service. This means that links (via relations or other info) should identify the event types they map to -- some like &lt;link&gt; with &quot;stylesheet&quot; relations are triggered by a user-agent internal event like page load to supplement the client steady state with extra data and others (like &lt;a&gt; links) are triggered by events from the platform.\n\nAs I mentioned on my blog, I think there is a need to explore this sort of &quot;reactive&quot; user agent in greater detail, but I still hold that there is good reason why so many, including myself, are on the &quot;goal-driven&quot; path. ;).  But I&#39;m willing to try to apply both approaches to a few test cases.
