It&#39;s just a starting place.  \nThe implications could spawn several other threads.\n\n&gt; &gt; Oh, but I *do* mean a unit of work, in the sense of two trading \n&gt; &gt; partners coming to agreement on advancing a business deal to the \nnext \n&gt; &gt; state.  Each business transaction succeeds or fails as a whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly right.  I do consider this a transaction.  The problem with \nit\n&gt; as discussed so far, is that it isn&#39;t composable with itself, so it\n&gt; will only ever be good for this one task.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I think what&#39;s here is a useful start, but isn&#39;t yet the kind of\n&gt; thing I would call a &quot;building block&quot;.  It needs something more.\n\nHow do you mean &quot;composable&quot;, and what more does it need?\nI&#39;m not disagreeing. The idea was meant as a toe in the door, to see \nif any kind of conversation-like interaction would be acceptable to \nthe REST gurus.  If so, then we&#39;ll see where it can go.\n\nHere are some possible dimensions of composability.  \nDo you mean one of these, or something else?\n\n1. This thread focused on offer-acceptance.  But almost every \nbusiness protocol I can think of has a similar kind of interaction, \nwhere both trading partners must explicitly agree on the next state \nof the business deal.  The interaction pattern could be exactly the \nsame.  See also #2:\n\n2. Offer-acceptance is only the beginning of a longer conversation.  \nFor example, an offer to buy, when accepted, is intended to be \nfulfilled and paid for. \nSo at least two other transactions will be forthcoming:  \n* Deliver the committed goods or services, which I will call &quot;Notify-\nComfirm&quot;.  Notify is where the seller notifies the buyer that the \ngoods or services have been delivered, to the seller&#39;s best \nunderstanding.  Confirm is where the buyer either agrees or disagrees.\nNotify-Confirm is actually the same as offer-acceptance.\nNotify is equivalent to Offer, Confirm equivalent to Accept.\n* Pay - also a Notify-Confirm transaction.\n\n3. The longer conversation (an economic exchange) has its own \npatterns.  It can be orchestrated or choreographed based on the \nstates of the resources representing the economic commmitments and \nfulfillment events of the business deal.  In other words, when all \nthe commitments have been fulfilled, the order is complete.\n(That&#39;s what a lot of business people mean by &quot;a transaction&quot;.)\n\n4. The whole economic exchange between two trading partners may be \nhyperlinked into a network of economic exchanges - a value system or \nsupply chain.  For example, if I order a computer from Dell, my \neconomic exchange with Dell may be hyperlinked to a slot on Dell&#39;s \nassembly schedule, which in turn may be hyperlinked to economic \nexchanges with Dell&#39;s suppliers for components, etc., turtles all the \nway down.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately I&#39;m no transaction guru.  \n\nNor am I, I&#39;m just following my nose.\n\n&gt; But I&#39;ve got an email from\n&gt; Mark Little in my inbox that I should get to - perhaps he has some\n&gt; ideas.\n\nIf so, please pass them on.\n \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand this yet.  How can a response document \nsay &quot;Accept&quot;\n&gt; but have an error?  \n\nLots of ways, for example:\n1. Could be too late.  Offers are not good forever.  The buyer needs \nto be able to move on to a different seller.\n2. The seller could have tried to change the offer in the response \ndocument or in some other way violate the rules of the deal.\n3. There could have been authorization or certificate or signature \nproblems.\n\nThanks for the feedback, I know you&#39;ve been very busy.\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
