When I read a book on structured \nprogramming and decide to use it, it doesn&#39;t bother me that someone \nelsewhere is using &quot;goto&quot; statements to their own detriment. Most \nidempotent operations on the Web are done with GET. Most non-idempotent \noperations are done with POST. Most cookies are trivial marketing \nspy-ware that have nothing to do with the functionality of the site \n(barring authentication cookies). Most people, most of the time, use Web \narchitecture properly whether they know they are doing that or not.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
