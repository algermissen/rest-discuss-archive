Just common.\n\ni think this is more generally about relative URIs, which are \ninterpreted relative to a base URI (that of the request).  much like a \nrelative and absolute path in a filesystem, but not exactly the same.\n\nand yes, a trailing slash or lack thereof affects how dot (.) is \ninterpreted in a user agent.  therefore it is important to be \nconsistent or your HTML/client code will start breaking in subtle ways.\n\nfor the record, i stick with *always* using a trailing slash, and \nredirect requests that lack them to URIs that have them.  no index.html \ncruft whatsoever.  i don&#39;t know whether this is superior in any way to \nnot having them though because i haven&#39;t tried this alternative.\n\n\n"}}
