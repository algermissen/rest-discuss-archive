VoiceXML instructs the user-agent what\noptions to present to the (human) user, for proceeding to the next\nsteady-state along the path to some goal, some of which may require user\ninput (keying a CC# into a telephone keypad is no different than keying\nit into an HTML form).\n\nThe human user drives the REST telephony application from one steady-\nstate to the next based on natural-language instructions received from\nthe user-agent.  The problem is, how do I write an agent to refill my\npharmacy prescriptions once a month over my pharmacy&#39;s VoiceXML system?\n\nThis is a vocabulary problem.  If I could have my modem dial up my\npharmacy&#39;s telephony system, there would need to be some sort of domain-\nspecific vocabulary -- there is no way to HTTP into the telephony\nsystem and directly manipulate VoiceXML in this example or the reality\nit&#39;s based on.\n\nLeaving us with Voice Recognition -- the vocabulary and voice talent is\nidentical for all pharmacies using the same system, i.e. it&#39;s domain-\nspecific -- so accommodating several different phrasings to accomplish\nthe task of &quot;refill&quot; would cover pretty much all U.S. pharmacies.\n\nThis metadata, i.e. &quot;press &#39;1&#39; for refill&quot;, can also be expressed by\nextending VoiceXML to encompass this domain-specific vocabulary\n(pharmacy refills).  &quot;Enter Rx# followed by #&quot; can also be either voice-\nrecognized or gleaned from VoiceXML metadata for m2m.\n\nWithout VR or metadata, I can only code an app which is capable of\ndialing my modem into my pharmacy and following a series of hard-coded\nsteps.  Regardless, the user-agent is what renders the steady-state for\nuser consumption, and the user makes the decision which path the user-\nagent follows to the next steady-state.\n\nSo it follows, then, that there is a need to discuss a &quot;user component&quot;\nwhich may be interchangeable between human and machine.  VoiceXML is\nintended as a language for a user-agent to present choices of state\ntransition to human users.  Machine users, however, can&#39;t decipher the\napplication states, unless the steady-state&#39;s hypertext includes some\nsort of metadata markup (or we use VR, the equivalent of screen-\nscraping) targeted towards m2m user components.\n\nIf this isn&#39;t the case, don&#39;t we lose key advantages of REST, like the\nease of debugging self-documenting natural-language APIs which utilize\nself-descriptive messaging such that the API may be understood and\nmaintained by humans?  An m2m interface bolted onto a human interface\nsolves the problem of human interpretation and maintenance of the API.\nThat problem isn&#39;t solved by m2m APIs which drive application state.\n\nThanks for mentioning VoiceXML, Mike!\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
