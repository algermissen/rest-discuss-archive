It should be a transparent \npart of the universal uniform interface, and it should be able to stand \nas the &#39;subject&#39; of a request.\n\nIf this happens, then we can move toward using the &#39;subject&#39; *and* the \n&#39;object&#39; of the request to key a cache of what are otherwise \nnon-cacheable responses to HTTP GET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
