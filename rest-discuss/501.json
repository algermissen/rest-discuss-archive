Alexander Jacobson&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul,\n&gt; \n&gt; You refer to IMAP at the beginning of the article\n&gt; but don&#39;t explain why it is better than HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; IMAP has lots of features that HTTP lacks.  It has\n&gt; methods that correspond to GET, POST, PUT.  It has\n&gt; a better representation of the notion of\n&gt; containers.  It has search.\n\nOkay, but how much work would it be to define a protocol with all of\nIMAPs features that conforms to the HTTP syntax and model versus vice\nversa? Adding &quot;search&quot; to HTTP would be trivial. Would adding URI\nhandling and content-negotiation to IMAP be similarly trivial?\n\n&gt; ODBC/SQL is also nice from the perspective you\n&gt; give.  The problem is that it does not specify a\n&gt; way of passing the types of objects!!!!!\n\nAlso not very well geared for large scale, loosely coupled computing.\n\n&gt; Regarding universality.  I would say that much of\n&gt; the universality of a communication protocol is a\n&gt; shared ontology aka a shared list of MIME\n&gt; content-types.\n\nI agree that this is necessary for an application. But I wouldn&#39;t say\nthat it is a benefit of the protocol itself.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
