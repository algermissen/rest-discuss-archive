The only issue that I can see is \nthat in some situations, it may be easier to drop in a CGI POST hander \nthat allows you to direct the result to a particular location; PUT \nrequires some sort of handler on the server side (e.g., a module or a \nscript that stores and retrieves the state).\n\nI&#39;d much rather see PUT used, as I think it&#39;s a good way to broaden \nsupport for full PUT/DELETE, but I can certainly see that there would be \ninitial pushback.  Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible, and how difficult \nit is, to support PUT on ISS (any version)?\n\nI&#39;d say support both, but that would require an attribute to select the \nmethod.\n\n\nOn Monday, April 29, 2002, at 01:03  PM, Paul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly, XSLT2 allows you to specify a URI to write output\n&gt;&gt; documents to [1].

Do you want to contact Michael Kay or should I\n&gt; or what?\n&gt;\n&gt; What should be done about POST? If we need to choose just one of the\n&gt; two, POST is actually more compatible with deployed infrastructure\n&gt; though PUT is more inline with &quot;overwrite&quot; semantics.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pragmatically I would have to go with POST.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n--\nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
