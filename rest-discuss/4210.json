There are no operations you&#39;d\nwant to perform on it. If you wanted to know about the real resource\nyou&#39;d do GET /customer/9 or the some such.\n\nI like Vincent&#39;s idea of &#39;DELETE /list/42?remove=9&#39; though I would\nprobably change it to &#39;DELETE /list/42?customer=9&#39;. This makes a lot\nof sense to me as a programmer. Query strings are used to define\n&#39;virtual resources&#39; so what you&#39;re saying here, I think, is delete the\nresult of the query &#39;GET /list/42?customer=9&#39;. Now that I think about\nthis strategy of operating on query strings is very powerful. This\nprovides a mean for doing mass deletions eg &#39;DELETE\n/list/42?nameLike=smi%&#39; and for doing mass updates.\n\nThanks for the tip.\n- Buko Obele\n\n\n"}}
