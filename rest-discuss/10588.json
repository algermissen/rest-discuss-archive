You can build a RESTful app on top of TCP,\nStyx[1] (someday WAKA? [2]) or some other transport/application\nprotocol.  Representations could be sexp&#39;s instead of XML.  REST\ndoesn&#39;t care.\n\nROA as presented in the book specifies the implementation technologies\n- HTTP, XML.. which ties it to the &quot;technologies of the web&quot;.   Giving\nit a name (ROA) may or may not be useful.. it may just be confusing\nbecause it&#39;s already widely known as the World Wide Web.\n\nIf I were to try and describe it, I would say that ROA specifies the\nimplementation technologies using REST design constraints, and those\ntechnologies happen to be a subset of those used in the broader &quot;World\nWide Web&quot;.\n\n\n[1] http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/styx.html\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_(protocol)\n\nOn 4/2/08, dfl_maradentro &lt;dfl_maradentro@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; More precisely, the book says something like:\n&gt; &quot;ROA, a way of turning a problem into a RESTful Web Service: an\n&gt; arrangement of URI&#39;s, HTTP, and XML...
