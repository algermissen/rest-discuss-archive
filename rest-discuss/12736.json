Implying that is not sufficient for a \nrepresentation &quot;to have links&quot;, it&#39;s important to understand that those \nlinks are the way used by the server to drive the application from one \nstate to another. The links per se are useless, unless they are a \nexpression of the intentions of the server.\n\nIf you receive a representation of a resource from the server with no \nlinks, it&#39;s nevertheless complying with HATEOAS, meaning that there is \nno more states to go from there (imagine a &quot;goodbye&quot; page).\n\nNow if  you use Javascript to insert a bunch of links in it, that \ndoesn&#39;t make it more HATEOAS... Actually, if you do that you are \nbreaking HATEOAS, because you can insert a link that you know that \ncorresponds to some state of the application (now it has hypermedia), \nbut since it was not originated by the server, it&#39;s not a engine to \nanything... You don&#39;t break the H but you break the E... :)\n\nSo I think I&#39;ll stick with HATEOAS.\n\n\nJosh Sled wrote:\n&gt; Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; HATEOAS: HYDEPR\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;HATEOAS&quot; is atrocious, and &quot;HYDEPR&quot; is not much better.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve never found &quot;the hypermedia constraint&quot; or &quot;hypermedia&quot; to be\n&gt; insufficient.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
