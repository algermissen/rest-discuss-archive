Because it is effectively an idempotent transform of input to ou=\r\ntput, I would usually describe it as Resources with addresses like http://e=\r\nxample.dom/transformed_result?input1=3D1&input2=3Dy or some other equivalen=\r\nt URL scheme, and use GET.\nExcept in this case, my input is a large text (c=\r\nsv) that can be passed as POST input rather than GET. What are my options? =\r\nThe first thing that comes to mind is uploading the csv creating a new reso=\r\nurce in the process and GETting another resource that holds the result of t=\r\nhe transform. Only that I never need the created csv resource again and tha=\r\nt it will be multiple HTTP requests for what warrants in my opinion a singl=\r\ne one.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nMuhammad Alkarouri\n\n\n"}}
