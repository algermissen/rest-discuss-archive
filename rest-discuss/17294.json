(My personal view of a 21st\ncentury intelligent agent - agent in the AI sense - is that of a\nrelatively stupid little unit composed of a HTTP client, (access from)\na HTTP server a little bit of code/wiring to express its business\nrules).\n\nMy reservation on the ACL front would be that currently a great deal\nof per-source manual configuration would be required to set something\nlike this up (and modify it as requirements and sources evolve).\n\n&gt; ps: not many people do this currently, but you can, virtuoso for example\n&gt; enables this, and there are js implementations in the works to encourage\n&gt; this pattern. (full read write ACL controlled web of linked data is still at\n&gt; proto stage)\n\nRight. I wasn&#39;t aware of how far Virtuoso had got on this, but it&#39;s\ngood to hear that work is in progress.\n\nCheers,\nDAnny.\n\n\n\n-- \nhttp://danny.ayers.name\n\n"}}
