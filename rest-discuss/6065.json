The user GETs a generic \n&gt;&gt; shopping cart page.  The page contains JavaScript which retrieves the \n&gt;&gt; contents of the shopping cart, from a generic URL.  The response to the \n&gt;&gt; request for the shopping cart page does not depend on the subject.  But \n&gt;&gt; the response for the request for the contents of the cart relies on the \n&gt;&gt; cookie.  Thus the shopping cart page can be cached, even if the contents \n&gt;&gt; of the cart can&#39;t (and they&#39;re dynamic, so who cares).\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; This is all fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I say there&#39;s  nothing unRESTful about cookies. It&#39;s putting a\n&gt; session id in a cookie and hiding data in the session on the server\n&gt; that&#39;s wrong.\n&gt;   \nWell, I was implying that I&#39;m storing a session ID in a cookie.\n&gt; Another way of doing this though is without a cookie. the user could\n&gt; have a resource on the server:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://store/nicferrier/cart\n&gt;\n&gt; and the client side AJAX could update that resource as and when I\n&gt; check things in and out of my cart.\n&gt;   \nOK, so now you&#39;re putting the subject (here, a user ID instead of \nsession ID) in the URL.\n\nIs it any worse if I write http://store/9823DF/cart, where 9823DF is a \nsession key?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
