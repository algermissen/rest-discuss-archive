NOT USE HTTP!?\n\nIf you&#39;re doing that then you should use the\nexisting standards for listservs.  I don&#39;t know\nthe standard, but I do know that Pine says that\nmail from Yahoo contains &quot;List Management\nInformation&quot; and that if I click on it, I get the\nopportunity to click on an UNSUB URL.\n\n&gt; &gt; The problem for the server is that multiple URIs\n&gt; &gt; may map to the same resource.  Those different\n&gt; &gt; URIs may be used by different clients for various\n&gt; &gt; purposes.  If the server has to send a URI, it\n&gt; &gt; also has to know which URI the client used to\n&gt; &gt; request notification about the Resource.\n&gt; &gt; That is really ugly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it? Or does it just need to send *a* URI? As long as the client can\n&gt; retrieve the changed state from the URI, maybe it doesn&#39;t care if it is\n&gt; &quot;the same&quot; URI. I have to think that through more when I have time.\n\nIt matters because the resource may have different\naccess protections when accessed from different\nURIs or suppose that the client subscribed to an\nHTTP URI, but the notifier supplies an HTTPS URI\nand the client can&#39;t do HTTPS.\n\n&gt; &gt; The subscription URL should be delivered in the\n&gt; &gt; response to notification.  It is a huge waste to\n&gt; &gt; deliver it with each notification.\n&gt;\n&gt; Same reasoning as above. Let&#39;s say you notice you&#39;re getting random,\n&gt; annoying notifications from some service. Maybe all else has failed and\n&gt; it is up to a human being to cancel the notifications. The header is\n&gt; equivalent to this:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\nSee above re the listserv standard.  But, I think\nfor this standard, if you are using an asynch\nprotocol, the client should just be required to\nrefresh subscription periodically.\n\n&gt; &gt; Again, if the client really want it, the client\n&gt; &gt; could encode it in the notification URL.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39; going to be one really ugly URL!\n\nIts up to the client!  The client could just\nmaintain a private map from notification URLs\nto a resource and subscription URLs.  It would be\nprettier but would require more client side state.\n\n&gt; Anyhow, my three concerns are as\n&gt; above:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1. The software may not ask for it but after it gets accidentally\n&gt; uninstalled, whoever needs to turn off the notifications needs it.\n\nThen, it should be optional.  In high frequency\nnotifications, you don&#39;t need it in every message.\n\n&gt;  2. The subscriber may be just be an email address in which case it\n&gt; isn&#39;t possible to arbitrarily munge the subscriber URI.\n\n* The subscriber can generate 1 email address\nper notification URL\n\n* The convention for email notification should\nbe different.  In particular, the URI that changed\nshould appear in the subject: header\n\n* Email should include a reply-to/from address...\n\n\n&gt; &gt; The client should be able to do subscription\n&gt; &gt; modifications in reply to a notification request.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In particular, some set of 40x responses to a\n&gt; &gt; notification should be the equivalent of\n&gt; &gt; unsubscription. e.g. if the response to a\n&gt; &gt; notification is 403 FORBIDDEN, that is a strong\n&gt; &gt; hint that you don&#39;t want the subscription anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, right now it works the opposite way. If the subscriber doesn&#39;t\n&gt; respond: &quot;Yes, please keep sending me crap&quot; then the sender must quit.\n&gt; Maybe that obviates point &quot;1&quot; above.\n\n\nThat won&#39;t work well for email unless you require\nthe recipient to reply to each email.\n\n&gt; &gt; ... Because a series of empty PUT bodies\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean that nothing has changed, only that\n&gt; &gt; the server decided not to send it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think any particular application would either ALWAYS send a diff (or a\n&gt; message indicating why it didn&#39;t send a diff) or NEVER send a diff. The\n&gt; body is optional at the notification spec level. Some apps may bother\n&gt; with diffs and some may not.\n\nBut you need to require that at the protocol level\nwhich is just wierd.\n\n&gt; Because it is necessary to handle this circumstance where clients go\n&gt; offine and come back on, it is necessary that messages be essentially\n&gt; irrelevant except for their timing. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; standardize any indication of HOW something changed. A particular\n&gt; application can do this *as an optimization* for clients who happen to\n&gt; have always-on connections.\n\nOk.\n1. You can require that HTTP messages always\nrepresent change since the last successful\ndelivery.  (the server then need to track when the\nlast successful delivery was)\n\n2. use an email like protocol and have every\nmessage contain the date at which the message was\nsent.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
