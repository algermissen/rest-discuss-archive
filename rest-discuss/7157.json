Constraints are on data,\n&gt; &gt; components, and connectors, which are all &quot;application layer&quot; AFAICT.\n&gt; Let&#39;s try the other way round: does SOA (or WS-*) use any constraint on\n&gt; any of those three?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say &#39;no&#39;.\n\nIt&#39;s hard to tell for certain of course, since SOA isn&#39;t defined.  But\nif you look at what people are doing in its name, you can pick out at\nleast a couple of constraints; client/server, and layered (just as\nwith REST).\n\n&gt; Does WS-*&#39;s constraining the data to SOAP count as a constraint on\n&gt; data in the software architectural sense? IMHO it does not, because it\n&gt; is just transport (below the application layer).\n\nWS-* might be SOAP-specific, but we&#39;re talking about the architectural\nstyle which is (so I&#39;m told) SOA.  SOA does not require SOAP, nor\nshould it if it&#39;s an architectural style.\n\n&gt; But maybe we are talking past each other. Will check back with Roy&#39;s\n&gt; disertation (though not today).\n\nGood idea.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
