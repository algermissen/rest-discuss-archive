In REST a resource represents a service \nor a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; data element, and every significant resource should have a URI.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Service&quot; seems to me a lot more like SOAP than REST.\n&gt; &gt; I think of resource as a significant business entity\n&gt; &gt; or an aggregation of business entities.\n&gt; &gt; Usually larger granularity than a data element.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if this is true. Roy Fielding dissertation defines a\n&gt; resource as &quot;Any information that can be named can be a resource: a\n&gt; document or image, a temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los\n&gt; Angeles&quot;), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object \n(e.g. a\n&gt; person), and so on.&quot;  HTTP defines it as &quot;A network data object or\n&gt; service that can be identified by a URI&quot;.  It seems like services \nare a\n&gt; valid concept to assign a URI to.\n\nI am not a purist, and can go along with assigning a URI to a service.\n\nBut when you already have a Product resource, it seems to me that \nasking a Service for availability by Product is going backwards to \nsomething more like a Web service.  I like much better asking the \nProduct resource for its availability, especially when &quot;availability&quot; \nitself is a well-recognized business aggregation with a standard \ndefinition from APICS, the Production and Inventory Control Society.\n\nIn a Web business situation, I want my significant business entities \nto be resources with URIs:  products, orders, disbursements and \nreceipts, etc.  I want them also to be hyperlinked to each other: \nproducts to orders, orders to products, disbursements and receipts to \norders, etc.\n\nAll of the above is why REST makes more sense to me from a business \nmodeling perspective than SOAP.\n\nAs Mike Dierken says, I want more nouns than verbs.  \n\nAs I said, this is just the way I think about it as a rookie.\nBut I&#39;ve been working my way through some common business situations \nand it&#39;s holding up pretty well so far.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
