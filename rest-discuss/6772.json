REST is better.\nNF&gt;&gt; people:  hey! that&#39;s cool. I&#39;d like to learn REST how do I do that?\nNF&gt;&gt; RESTafrian: [mumbles] read roy&#39;s dissertation... listen to everyone\nargue...   \n\nEXACTLY!  (BTW, I *love* that meme: RESTafrian. LOL!!!)\n\nBdhO&gt;&gt; Chances are I understand neither, but I have to say, I don&#39;t \nBdhO&gt;&gt; see the gaping void between OOAD and REST insofar as you \nBdhO&gt;&gt; have to unlearn between the two. This idea of &quot;unlearning&quot; \nBdhO&gt;&gt; or &quot;getting it&quot; bugs me a bit, it makes a slice of software \nBdhO&gt;&gt; engineering sound like mysticism, or worse,  mathematical \nBdhO&gt;&gt; insight.\n\nI definitely agree with the &quot;bugs-me&quot; part, unless there is a desire by some\nto keep it obtuse (which would also bug me.)\n\nBdhO&gt;&gt; why they shouldn&#39;t just drill a convenience method \nBdhO&gt;&gt; through POST, manage state with cookies, or use a \nBdhO&gt;&gt; controller URL to manage a whole load of resources. \nBdhO&gt;&gt; They&#39;re on a clock and don&#39;t have time for architectural \nBdhO&gt;&gt; handwaving; and if handwaving is all you can provide \nBdhO&gt;&gt; you&#39;re actually stopping them from working. \n\nI completely agree. To solve that problem will take two things: \n\n1.) Make it easy for them to educate themselves, including some outreach\n2.) Make it easy for them to implement.\n\nI have ideas for both 1. & 2., but I&#39;ve only commented on #1 thus far\n(trying not to pick too many battles at once. :)\n\nBdhO&gt;&gt; Developers aren&#39;t idiots, they can and do understand \nBdhO&gt;&gt; long/wide term issues if ithey&#39;re laid out properly. Jesus \nBdhO&gt;&gt; knows the DBAs on the other end of the wire seem to be \nBdhO&gt;&gt; able to spell things out for them.\n\nSounds like you are agreeing with me that it can be documented more clearly\nsuch that they will understand?\n\nBdhO&gt;&gt; If there is a problem it&#39;s in teaching students and new hires. \nBdhO&gt;&gt; Object modeling (fashionably called domain driven design these \nBdhO&gt;&gt; days), and design patterns don&#39;t come with caveats saying the \nBdhO&gt;&gt; design principles and techniques are only appropriate in a certain \nBdhO&gt;&gt; context.\n\nSounds like we need to get the disciple of &quot;Web Science&quot; started in colleges\nand universities, like TBL talks about. \n\nThat said, is there anyone on the list from the Atlanta Georgia area (Ga\nTech maybe?)\n\nBTW, this to Roy: my interest in wanting to explain it more clearly is not\nto introduce new ideas or to change the model; my intention was to reflect\nyour principles faithly, just make it a little easier to understand.  \n\nThat said, I realized after thinking about the response I got earlier today\nthat I had made assumptions that none of you are aware of, and so in\nhindsight it&#39;s clear to me why I got the response I got.  Let me explain\nthose assumptions.\n\nTo date mostly only serious professional programmers have used REST (but if\nthat&#39;s a wrong assumption, don&#39;t attack it, it&#39;s just background and not my\nmain point.) However, the concept of Mashups has arrived on the scene\nrecently and many people are excited because they believe (what I call)\noccupational programmers and power users will soon be able to build their\nown Mashups. That has a ton of mostly entreprenuers without rigorous\ndevelopment background diving in to build tools for Mashups. And Mashups are\nbased on two core &quot;technologies&quot;: AJAX and REST. Yet almost none of those\npeople will be able to read Roy&#39;s dissertation and make heads nor tails of\nit.\n\nWhich means, unless we make it easy for these occupational programmers,\npower users, and entreprenuers to both 1.) understand REST and 2.) implement\nREST they are going to butcher the hell out of it, and your wonderful\narchitectural design will become invisible to all the things that call\nthemselves REST that, according to you (Roy) are not.\n\nSo I&#39;m actually trying to help you all to head off this bastardization of\nREST before the Mashup crowd obliterates it because, after spending time\nlearning it, I see that it has a lot of true value.
