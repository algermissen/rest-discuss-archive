How would I implement my service so that I can cancel an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n order rather than delete it? One is to have the cancel state as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; par=\r\nt of the order. THen I can just put a new representation with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the ca=\r\nncelled state set to true:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; PUT /orders/333\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; content-typ=\r\ne: application/xml\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;cancelled&gt;false=\r\n&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Seems kinda heavy to =\r\nme.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Would it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI tha=\r\nt you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could put or post to to change the state?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nbsolutely not. When you want to change the state of a resource,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you m=\r\nanipulate that resource -- you don&#39;t assign the operation to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some oth=\r\ner URL. The proper way of doing this is what you started\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with, as mys=\r\nelf and others told you. But you are more concerned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with calling what=\r\n you&#39;re doing REST by playing semantics with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terminology, than yo=\r\nu are with learning REST -- this is my opinion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from dealing with you =\r\non rest-discuss, and observing your responses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to others on rest-discu=\r\nss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you want, I can send you hundreds of other emails I&#39;ve=\r\n sent that\n&gt; &gt; you can use to discredit me. One particularly juicy one I se=\r\nnt a few\n&gt; &gt; years ago is where I described REST as &quot;pretty&quot; URLs. Ping me\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; offline if you&#39;re interested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not interested in discreditin=\r\ng you. I dredged up this thread\n&gt; because you&#39;re still making the same fund=\r\namental mistake to this day --\n&gt; not because I&#39;m looking to embarass you. E=\r\nveryone here but Roy has\n&gt; posted stuff that they&#39;re embarassed by, in retr=\r\nospect, after learning\n&gt; better, I&#39;m sure.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been very polite in poi=\r\nnting out that your solutions are RPC, not\n&gt; REST, in an effort to help you=\r\n learn -- because it was obvious you\n&gt; needed some help. Your response was =\r\nargumentative and defensive, so I\n&gt; let this thread drop, figuring it didn&#39;=\r\nt matter that you weren&#39;t\n&gt; interested in learning from your mistakes. Well=\r\n, my attitude there\n&gt; changed with the introduction of REST-*. Now it does =\r\nmatter.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m here to learn what I don&#39;t know, and teach what I do know. =\r\nIs your\n&gt; purpose here only to sow unREST? Your other message this morning =\r\nseems\n&gt; to indicate that you&#39;re going to go on calling what you do REST,\n&gt; =\r\nwhether it is or not. Bumping this thread is a precursor to my\n&gt; response t=\r\no that other post, precipitated by that other post.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seriously tho=\r\nugh, considering the plethora of different responses to\n&gt; &gt; this thread, a =\r\nlot of people are performing similar thought exercises.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, there =\r\ncertainly is a lot of confusion out there surrounding REST.\n&gt; The fact that=\r\n some people agreed with your approach doesn&#39;t amount to\n&gt; some sort of con=\r\nsensus. REST isn&#39;t so abstract that there&#39;s no wrong\n&gt; answer. If you&#39;re he=\r\nre to learn, then you need to accept (and question)\n&gt; what you&#39;re being tol=\r\nd, not keep insisting that you&#39;re right.\n\n\nI agree w/ Eric. In case it&#39;s of=\r\n some use, I find this particuicularly useful:\n\nhttp://rajith.2rlabs.com/20=\r\n07/11/14/the-value-of-principled-design-rest-is-just-one-example/\n\nREST is =\r\na *specific* set of constraints -- just because some alternate\napproach is =\r\ngood or useful or practical does *not* mean it is still\nREST, and you simpl=\r\ny should go around calling RPC interactions\n&quot;REST-*.&quot;  In addition, REST is=\r\n imbued with &quot;principled design&quot;\n(illustrated perfectly by Subbu & Eric&#39;s e=\r\nxchange on this thread) --\nbalancing specific constraints with specific res=\r\nulting\ncharacteristics.  That&#39;s what makes REST and the community around it=\r\n\nso compelling to me. It also makes it particularly difficult to\n&quot;market,&quot; =\r\nwhich is what the REST-* effort seems to be about.\n\n-- peter keane\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No, providing a link to a resource doesn&#39;t make that resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; R=\r\nESTful. Pretend I&#39;ve just posted a link to a butt-ugly URL that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obvio=\r\nusly has nothing to do with REST. Following the link to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to that b=\r\nutt-ugly non-RESTful URL doesn&#39;t make that URL RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well =\r\nconsider a different scenario that I had posted earlier. You\n&gt; &gt; are modeli=\r\nng a data cache. Adding and retrieving data and\n&gt; &gt; representations from th=\r\ne cache is pretty easy to model restfully.\n&gt; &gt; But consider the act of purg=\r\ning a cache or running some kind of\n&gt; &gt; eviction policy. While purging a ca=\r\nche changes the state of the\n&gt; &gt; cache, it is in and of itself *not* state =\r\nof the cache. Pure\n&gt; &gt; operations do exist within applications.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sur=\r\ne they do. But in REST, these operations are abstracted to fit the\n&gt; Unifor=\r\nm Interface, not turned into an endpoint for RPC operations. My\n&gt; assessmen=\r\nt of your character would improve considerably if you could\n&gt; accept that j=\r\nust because a URI is linked to, doesn&#39;t make it a REST\n&gt; resource. This is =\r\na fundamental truth, not a matter open for debate.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Futhermore, if=\r\n links can&#39;t be mechanisms to modify the state of a\n&gt; &gt; resource, you&#39;ve pr=\r\netty much discounted half of the Web itself. I\n&gt; &gt; guarantee you 90% of Web=\r\n applications out there that are accepting\n&gt; &gt; any kind of input are receiv=\r\ning that input via a Form and through an\n&gt; &gt; action URL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Who said l=\r\ninks can&#39;t be such a mechanism? Also, who said that 90% of\n&gt; Web applicatio=\r\nns are RESTful? Or that using HTML forms is unRESTful?\n&gt; Why is your respon=\r\nse to my magnanimous assistance, to put words in my\n&gt; mouth as a means of a=\r\nrguing against what I have to say instead of\n&gt; trying to learn from it, or =\r\nasking me to elaborate? You&#39;re the noob,\n&gt; I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s been learning =\r\nand applying REST for 11 years. You\n&gt; might consider the possibility that I=\r\n actually know a good deal about\n&gt; what I&#39;m talking about. Folks might be m=\r\nore comfortable with REST-* if\n&gt; you were to show an interest in accepting =\r\nthe help you&#39;ve been offered\n&gt; here, instead of turning every issue into so=\r\nme semantic explanation of\n&gt; why your way is right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway,\n&gt;\n&gt; If I pe=\r\nrform a GET against a URI, and receive a representation with a\n&gt; form allow=\r\ning various parts of the resource to be changed, change some\n&gt; data, and su=\r\nbmit the form as a POST to the same URI, then I&#39;ve just\n&gt; modified the stat=\r\ne of a resource, driven by hypermedia, by transferring\n&gt; a representation o=\r\nf the resource I received back to the server. The\n&gt; submitted data may be s=\r\nent either as an entity of some media-type, or\n&gt; as a query string of name-=\r\nvalue pairs as &#39;application/x-www-form-\n&gt; urlencoded&#39;. Perfectly RESTful, n=\r\nothing wrong with query strings\n&gt; despite what many people say.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, if=\r\n that POST contains no content and/or is directed at some other\n&gt; resource =\r\ninstead of the one I did a GET on, then it may well be\n&gt; hypermedia-driven,=\r\n but it isn&#39;t REST, as REST has more constraints than\n&gt; just HEAS.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eri=\r\nc\n&gt; \n\n"}}
