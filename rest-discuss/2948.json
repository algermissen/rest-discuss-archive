One aspect of this is (and arguably its most powerful use) is\n&gt; presence management - just simply being able to subscribe to a service,\n&gt; and know when it is available (without polling) is a very valuable thing\n&gt; (for example - I could subscribe to several similar services, but know\n&gt; which ones are available right now, when I want to choosing one to use).\nWhenever a piece of software receives an unsolicited message it&#39;s &#39;push&#39;.\nWhich means that Web servers that receive unsolicited POST messages are\nbeing &#39;pushed&#39; the data.\nPut a Web server on every desktop & you&#39;ve got a &#39;push based Web&#39;. (This is\nwhere my phrase &#39;The Web works both ways&#39; comes from)\nIf you can&#39;t open a connection to the desktop - and Jabber I&#39;m assuming\ndoesn&#39;t do this either - then have the desktop open a connection to the\nserver (or Jabber server, or HTTP proxy, or whatever) and then wait for\nincoming messaging.\nThe use of HTTP after the socket is opened provides for clear, simplified\nand rich application semantics that work with many many tools. I&#39;m spending\nsome time thinking about the details of a client add-on & server add-on to\ndo this extra socket connection handoff stuff. I call it Appster & my first\nexperiment will be to do similar things as the Gnutella protocol does, but\nwith pure HTTP for discovery and queries.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So where does this leave us?  Not much further along, but perhaps I can\n&gt; convince one or two people to have a closer look at Jabber, and I think\n&gt; we could concentrate on how to do the bridging between XMPP (the JSF\n&gt; name of the Jabber Protocol), and the HTTP requirements of REST?\nOkay, somebody should look into that. But I&#39;m going to look at providing\nHTTP/URI/XML access everywhere & then move on to Web native pub/sub.\n\nMike\n\n"}}
