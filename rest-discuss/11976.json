Most commonly,\nthis includes content type and language.\n\nOf course, there are going to be times when you want to explicitly select a\nresource variant instead of leaving it up to content negotiation, and in this\ncase you want to encode the language or content type into the URI in the least\ndamaging way possible.\n\nJust like using http://example.org/html/about and http://example.org/pdf/about\nwould seem a little absurd, so does http://example.org/en/about to me. In each\ncase you end up with some leaked abstraction of resource negotiation across the\nwhole of your site. All your regular URIs now start with &quot;/html/&quot;! There is no\nway of pointing someone to http://example.org/about and falling back on conneg.\n\nThe only sensible way to have your cake and eat it when it comes to providing\ncontent negotiation and manual variant selection is to encode the variants at\nthe tail end of the URI, so you would choose:\n\n  http://example.org/about\n  http://example.org/about.en\n  http://example.org/about.fr\n\nOr maybe:\n\n  http://example.org/about\n  http://example.org/about.pdf\n  http://example.org/about.html\n\nIn both of these cases, you can manually link to and use the resource variants\nwithout imposing a &quot;URI tax&quot; on the rest of your site. Leave out the extensions\nand you fall back to conneg.\n\nBest,\n\n-- \nNoah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n\n"}}
