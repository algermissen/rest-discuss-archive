Mike Dierken wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the intermediate step of POST-ing to the URL to get an\n&gt; &gt; editable HTML representation of the item that I&#39;m not happy with.\n&gt;\n&gt;  You shouldn&#39;t need to POST, you should be able to just GET.\n\nI was initially POST-ing because GET-ing was returning the non-editable \nrepresentation of the resource. I needed something to help my server \ncode distinguish between the when it should return the resource as \nnon-editable HTML or as an editable HTML form.\n\nI&#39;ve since decided this wasn&#39;t the best approach as that means the code \nthat handles POST-s for that URL needs to distinguish between the \n&quot;initial&quot; POST when the HTML form is returned and the subsequent POST \nwhen the form data is submitted. Seeing the code get messy made it \nobvious that it wasn&#39;t a good design.\n\n&gt; &gt; An alternative would be to include a link with a query string\n&gt; &gt; parameter like &quot;?mode=edit&quot; but that doesn&#39;t strike me as being\n&gt; &gt; very REST-ful, either.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is mostly RESTful. Just don&#39;t mistake &#39;mode&#39; to mean\n&gt;  &#39;method&#39;. You might want to use &#39;mode=author&#39; and &#39;mode=reader&#39; or\n&gt;  some noun-based word.\n\nThis is what I switched to using but instead of traditional query string \nparameters, the query string looks like &quot;?edit&quot; or &quot;?delete&quot;. I might be \nabusing the query string by doing that, though. I could just as easily \nuse an extra path segment.\n\nHere&#39;s some possibilities (with delete thrown into the mix):\n\n- GET example.org/foo - returns representation of foo (HTML or XML \ndepending on Accept header)\n- PUT, POST example.org/foo - accepts XML\n- DELETE example.org/foo - deletes foo resource\n- GET example.org/foo?edit - returns HTML form to edit foo\n- GET example.org/foo/edit - using path segment instead of query\n- GET example.org/foo/edit-form - using noun\n- POST example.org/foo/edit-form - accepts multipart/form-data, updates \nfoo resource (parent)\n- GET example.org/foo?delete - returns HTML form to confirm delete operation\n- GET example.org/foo/delete - using path segment instead of query\n- GET example.org/foo/delete-form - using noun\n- POST example.org/foo/delete-form - deletes foo resource (parent)\n\nI&#39;m not sure I like how POST-ing to a subordinate resource (when using \npath segments instead of query strings) updates and/or deletes the \nparent resource even if it&#39;s just a hack to get around the browser&#39;s \nlimitations. Maybe that&#39;s an argument in favor of query strings.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks.\n\n-- Jason\n\n"}}
