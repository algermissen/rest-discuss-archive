But I meant &quot;semant=\r\nics&quot; in the more linguistic\nsense--if XML is syntax, then Atom is at best g=\r\nrammar, but neither is\nreal interpretation. You don&#39;t end up with a chocola=\r\nte cake just by\nhaving a general notion of &quot;recipe&quot;. My point was, in my ex=\r\nperience,\nit&#39;s useful to make a new media type for &quot;recipe&quot; (grammar) but n=\r\not for\n&quot;chocolate cake&quot; (idea).\n\n&gt; The @rel of\n&gt; a link specifies the seman=\r\ntics of an association between two\nresources,\n&gt; and not &quot;semantics of the r=\r\nesource&quot;. In other words, @rel describes\nthe\n&gt; semantics of a resource in a=\r\n &quot;particular&quot; context and not in &quot;any&quot;\n&gt; context.\n\nSort of. One page&#39;s &quot;pre=\r\nv&quot; is another one&#39;s &quot;next&quot;. But link relations\nhave varying degrees of how =\r\ncontext-bound or -free they might be. If you\nhave a website where every res=\r\nponse representation includes a &quot;home&quot;\nlink, those links possess an interpr=\r\netation (and probably even an\noperational semantic) that&#39;s not very particu=\r\nlar to the immediate\ncontext.\n\nFormalizing the operational semantics of lin=\r\nk relations (and other\nelements) via media types is great. But I&#39;m not conv=\r\ninced that trying to\nformalize the *interpretation* of representations via =\r\nnew media types\n(like &#39;application/orderlist&#39;) is appropriate, especially w=\r\nhen existing\nmedia types already express operational semantics so well. I s=\r\nent an\nemail to a friend yesterday asking, &quot;can we go camping next weekend?=\r\n&quot;. I\ndidn&#39;t have to replace the question mark with a camping-specific symbo=\r\nl.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n&gt; On Aug 6, 2010, at 9:22 AM, Rober=\r\nt Brewer wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...suppose we have defin=\r\ned a link semantic that allows a server to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; point a client to, for exam=\r\nple, the list of new orders...it could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be &lt;link rel=3D&quot;new-orders&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;/foo/bar&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The issue I am dealing with is this: What is=\r\n the appropriate degree\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specificity of the media type for lists o=\r\nf orders. Especially I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wondering whether it is enough for the user =\r\nagent to say\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Accept: application/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nor whether the Accept header should include the user agent\n&gt; &gt; capabilities=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regarding the individual order entries, e.g.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Accept: appli=\r\ncation/orderlist\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I consider media types as syntax, not semantics. I=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; application/orderlist really has different syntax than\n&gt; &gt; applicatio=\r\nn/atom+xml, then, OK I guess. But it probably shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt; Instead, the s=\r\nemantics of the resource are described by the @rel\n&gt; &gt; attribute the user-a=\r\ngent discovered and followed (in combination\nwith\n&gt; &gt; data and its arrangem=\r\nent in the response, including further links in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; response). Your r=\r\nesource could just as easily return &quot;text/html&quot;\nwith\n&gt; &gt; the same semantics=\r\n and, if the client understood HTML, could be\n&gt; &gt; processed meaningfully, i=\r\nn which case the client would emit &quot;Accept:\n&gt; &gt; application/atom+xml, text/=\r\nhtml&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In other words, the Accept header says, &quot;these are the\nrepre=\r\nsentation\n&gt; &gt; formats I am prepared to parse for a resource of the &#39;new-ord=\r\ners&#39;\n&gt; &gt; relation&quot;. A media type of &quot;application/orderlist&quot; *can* be used i=\r\nn\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; way, but couples too tightly, IMO. There are plenty of &quot;list-y=\r\n&quot;\nmedia\n&gt; &gt; types out there already--does a list of orders really differ\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; significantly in structure (not just differ in @rel&#39;s) from a list\n&gt; of,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; say, sale items? Atom has succeeded, IMO, because it is specific in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n syntax (&quot;feed&quot; =3D list of items in order, with some fixed fields) and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n generic in semantics (doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re listing). I wrote\n&gt; Shoji=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; [1] because I wanted to hit that sweet spot for a &quot;catalog&quot; syntax\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (entities and overlapping lists of entity URI&#39;s) that was\nindependent\n&gt; of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the semantic--I wrote it for Etsy procurement, but it could equally\n&gt; =\r\nbe\n&gt; &gt; used for representing scientific lab work. If the syntax fits, wear\n=\r\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Robert Brewer\n&gt; &gt; fumanchu@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1] http://=\r\nwww.aminus.org/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-01.txt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
