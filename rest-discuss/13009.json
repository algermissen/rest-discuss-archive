In fact I like the &quot;_&quot; syntax which\n&gt; keeps the verbs out of the main namespace without having to bundle them up in a directory (Sun Cloud API puts its verbs in\n&gt; under &quot;ops&quot; for example). Often you also need to supply one or more parameters too (for example, is that &quot;shutdown&quot; a\n&gt; clean OS shutdown, an ACPI off or a cable pull and that disk &quot;resize&quot; is how many Gb?) - in that case it&#39;s easy enough to\n&gt; pass them in HTML form encoded.\n&gt;\n\nIn our current implementation of the Sun Cloud API, the verbs do creep\nback in to the URIs on stuff like this, but we happen to use a request\nparameter for it :-).  Of course, the client is never supposed to be\nexamining these URIs anyway, so it&#39;s just an implementation detail.\n\nRegarding parameters to an operation, we support an open ended\napplication/json hash in the request body with conventions around some\nfield names (a &quot;note&quot; field should be a message intended for a log\nfile, if it is present).  If we were built around HTML forms, that\nwould certainly work just as well, but we&#39;re all JSON as a matter of\nexpedience.\n\nRegarding the verb, we were originally using PUT for these operations,\nbut got some fairly strong feedback (including some from this group)\nthat POST was more appropriate because of the semantics of what the\noperations did ... they really did start some process on the server,\nand the impacts on the representation of what we POST to are *side\neffects* that have no immediate relationship to the content of the\nrequest body.  So, POST feels a lot better.\n\nIf this were my cache, I&#39;d probably make the same sort of design\ndecision here, and use a POST for a non-CRUD operation like &quot;clear the\ncache&quot;, plus let it have some options for things like &quot;clear all\nentries older than xxx minutes&quot; or &quot;clear all entries with the\nfollowing ids&quot;.  Using a PUT with an empty body feels like trying to\nturn a screw into a nail because I happen to have a hammer handy.\n\nCraig\n\n"}}
