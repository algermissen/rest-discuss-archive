Bowman schrieb:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;Further, to your URI examples and content negotiation discussion,\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;there is no need to implicate more than one resource (and therefore one\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;URI) in modeling content negotiation. I think if you figure that out,\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;you&#39;ll be well on your way to some rest from this subject, no pun\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;intended.\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; When implementing content negotiation, each alternate representation is \n&gt;&gt; also\n&gt;&gt; its own resource with its own URI, this URI is returned in \n&gt;&gt; Content-Location.\n&gt;\n&gt;No, it doesn&#39;t need to. It just can be that way.\n&gt;\n\nYes, I understand that Content-Location is optional, in fact that is why \nthere&#39;s a VARY header.  Either way, multiple representations are associated \nwith one URI.  It is my belief that in a REST system, these variants should \nbe individually addressable as resources in their own right.  Even if those \nURIs are not sent in Content-Location when a system is deployed, that should \ncertainly be a capability of any implementation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know how this is done without using multiple resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;It doesn&#39;t need to be done that way in the first place.\n&gt;\n\nNo, of course not, not according to RFC 3296 or RFC 2616 but we are talking \nabout REST which is a best-practices subset of what is possible, aren&#39;t we? \nIf you can&#39;t assign each of your variants a URI, how do you know your negotiated resource isn&#39;t an endpoint?\n\nWhen I first designed my RMS I didn&#39;t provide for any means of overriding \ncontent negotiation, and I wasn&#39;t even worried about what URIs to assign the \nvariants.  The VARY header did its job.  But since I often discuss Web \nDevelopment I decided that I wanted to be able to link to back-compat \nHTML 4.01 variants so that even users whose browsers would normally negotiate \nfor XHTML 1.1 could view them, without resorting to 300 Options.\n\nIn other words, I learned from experience several reasons not to forego the \n_ability_ to send Content-Location even in situations where I don&#39;t send that \nheader.\n\nMy solution was to parameterize the URLs instead of using file extensions, or \na variety of other options many of which are equally viable.  Even if I chose \nnot to send Content-Location, or if I chose not to respond to the \nparameterized URLs by sending 404 errors, internally my system is based on \nthe REST architectural style so it is critical that I be able to identify \neach of my variants with its own URI, at least in order to model the system.\n\nI offer this proof of my RMS, based on the notation and diagrams I&#39;ve been \ndeveloping.  It&#39;s WIP.  Feel free to use the PNGs I made however you want:\n\n[1] http://canuck.bisonsystems.net/dev/rest/\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards, Julian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
