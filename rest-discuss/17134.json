No one is ever going to standardize, say, a data format for \nyoga positions or similar obscure domains. Are we then disallowed to use the \ninternet and REST for such domains? The same applies to link relations - \nwhat if there is no relation for a link to &quot;The third normative yoga \nposition of the current position&quot; (which probably don&#39;t exists, but \nhopefully you get my point)? In following I&#39;ll try to give my impression of \nwhat I think you think ... let&#39;s see if I get your point.\n\nWe have had such discussions before and your proposal was, as I remember it, \nto use html forms. See \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/17057 I guess the \nsame goes here again: use xhtml and html forms to describe how data is \nposted instead of minting your own media types. Then annotate the &lt;input&gt; \nelements with a &quot;property&quot; attribute that expresses the semantics of the \nelement. Like for instance &lt;input property=&quot;&#39;foaf:name&quot; \nname=&quot;some-irrelvant-serverside-variable-name&quot;/&gt;.\n\nSo at runtime my client can discover the html form and look for the element \nwith property=&quot;foaf:name&quot; in order to transmit the &quot;name&quot; of the data. Which \nis not the same as looking for the element with \nname=&quot;some-irrelvant-serverside-variable-name&quot; - or rather, knowing ahead of \ntime, that &quot;name&quot; should be encoded as \n&quot;some-irrelvant-serverside-variable-name&quot;.\n\nOne way to understand this is as a decoupling of format and semantics. The \nsemantics describe &quot;this is a name (foaf:name)&quot; whereas the format describes \n&quot;the name most be encoded as some-irrelvant-serverside-variable-name&quot;. We \ncould even go one step further and check to see if the &quot;name&quot; input is not \nthere, and, if not, then, well, you are not supposed to update it. Is this a \nproper understanding of what you are saying?\n\nBut sometimes it makes more sense to post XML data (at least for me). I am \nnot saying &quot;mint a new media type&quot;, all I want it to send some more complex \ndata structures than key/value pairs handles without bending over \nbackwards - and send that using application/xml. This is where XForm comes \nin. With XForms we can describe the input XML format/model and using the \nhtml user controls associated with XForms we can do like you did with xhtml \nforms and annotate the input elements with property=&quot;foaf:name&quot; (or \nsimilar).\n\nRight?\n\n/J�rn \n\n\n"}}
