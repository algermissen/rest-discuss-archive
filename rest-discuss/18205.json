It is *not* a conceptual or business data type in the sense of\nan INTEGER, STRING, HEALTHCARE_RECORD or PURCHASE_ORDER. A format type\ntells a client how to parse an entity body, not how to interpret it.\nMaybe &quot;Content-Type&quot; should have been named &quot;Content-Format&quot; instead.\n\nWith image data the distinction becomes clearer; we can use different\nrepresentation format types like jpg, gif or png but, the actual\nconceptual interpretation of the image, ie. &quot;what it is an image of&quot;,\nis out-of bounds for HTTP.\n\nOf course at some level any client-server system has to agree on the\ncore business concepts that will be represented by some business\nspecific data type. However at the interface and and representation\nformat level I want to be able to use standard tools and not to risk\ninterfering with the nice properties of HTTP. I think conceptual or\nbusiness data type information, ie. how an entity body should be\ninterpreted, should be handled as out-of band information of the\ncurrent version of HTTP.\n\nMaybe some syntax convention could be found for combining\nrepresentation format type *and* conceptual/business data type\ninformation in the content-type header, eg\n&quot;application/json&purchase-order&quot; or else a new HTTP header\n&quot;Concept-Type&quot; could be introduced that indicates the\nconceptual/business data type of the entity body, eg &quot;Concept-Type:\npurchase-order&quot;. This would at least give HTTP clients a *hint* of how\nto interpret the entity body and &quot;Concept-Type&quot; names could also be\nused in hyperlinks to give clients hints about the interpretation of a\nresource before having to dereference the hyperlink to that resource.\n\nHaving said that, I would be satisifed with one single new media type;\none that combines JSON:s simple expressiveness with native support for\nhyperlinks! :-)\n\n/Paul\n\n--\nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
