In addition, since the target is receiving information\n&gt; about the source, the target needs permissions to read from the source. And\n&gt; if the permissions change, then the &#39;route&#39; needs to be updated to reflect\n&gt; that - for example if Alice is denied permission to read the source, the\n&gt; route/subscription should be disabled (if you can&#39;t &#39;see&#39; a resource, you\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be able to &#39;hear&#39; it either). (you can argue that it should be\n&gt; deleted, but re-enabling permissions isn&#39;t going to tell you what\n&gt; subscriptions need to be re-created.)\n&gt; details details...\n\nAll good thoughts.  For the most generic purposes, though, I think this is more\ncomplexity than is required.  It takes the task out of the realm of simple\nauthentication --- not of principal but of transaction --- and into a realm of\nauthentication + authorization.  (To clarify the distinction:  authentication\nis proving continuity of identity for some purpose, authorization is deciding\nwhether / proving that some authenticated principal has permission to do\nsomething.)\n\nWith a scheme similar to the one I proposed, you&#39;re only doing the most basic\nkind of authentication --- you&#39;re simply proving that the Subscriber event sink\n&quot;knows&quot; and (continuously) &quot;approves of&quot; the subscription that was requested on\nits behalf.  With Mike&#39;s more sophisticated scheme, it seems that you need to\nintroduce some notion of permissions and authorization vis-a-vis those\npermissions.  This may be useful or even necessary for some applications, but\nIMO it&#39;s not really necessary for the most basic uses of HttpEvents.  And, it\ncan be built on top of the simpler mechanism.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
