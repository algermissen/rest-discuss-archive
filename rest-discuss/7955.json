I don&#39;t think\n  that many webstores (and other sites) will like this.\n\n- having a machine authenticate on your behalf (outside the browser)\n  is difficult and requires new protocols to be supported.\n\nprooveme.com attempts to solve both these problems by giving each\nOpenID user a client certificate. Now when the user authenticates the\nauth happens immediately (the OP can say &quot;does the user have the cert?\nyes or no?&quot;). Users won&#39;t see any website change as they login (though\nthey do see a page change obviously).\n\nprooveme.com can also help you get a machine to authenticate on your\nbehalf. If you give your certificate to a machine then it can use the\nexisting OpenID protocol to login... as long as the machine&#39;s HTTP\nclient supports HTTPS and redirects. As an example, CURL does.\n\nMy idea is to build a small amount of GUI into prooveme.com to allow\nusers to generate additional certificates with time or login attempt\nconstraints and to allow those certificates to be distributed to\nsupporting clients.\n\nIf anybody has any thoughts I&#39;d be really interested to hear them.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
