Maybe even if they are hash tables.  But I&#39;m not clear, if they \n&gt; are more complex data structures, how well these verbs would map.  \n&gt; There&#39;s no obvious way to do a search, for example.  If a book is at \n&gt; /books/2893, I can delete that book, or replace it, but how do I search \n&gt; for a book with &quot;REST&quot; in the title?  Maybe GET \n&gt; /book-search?title-contains=REST, but then, what&#39;s the resource?  The \n&gt; book search?  \n\nIf you&#39;re talking about having resources for books you might have a\nsupra resource that was a collection of books:\n\n  http://lylesrestcafe/library/far_from_the_madding_crowd\n  http://lylesrestcafe/library/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish\n\nso you could have a search:\n\n  http://lylesrestcafe/library?author=hardy\n\nthere&#39;s nothing that dictates how HTTP parameter name/values are\ninterpreted so &quot;author=hardy&quot; might mean:\n\n- find books where the author&#39;s name is Hardy\n\n- or find books where the author&#39;s name looks like hardy\n\n- or find books where the author is hardy (bold or brave).\n\n\n\n&gt; What happens if I do PUT /book-search &quot;blah blah blah&quot;?  \n&gt; Does it change the code?\n\nIt might do. Those sort of things are application specific.\n\n\n&gt; Is it possible to apply REST to any other actions, besides data \n&gt; manipulation?  Suppose my HTTP server is a robot, and I want to tell it \n&gt; to ring the doorbell.  What verb would apply?  What&#39;s the resource - the \n&gt; robot?  It&#39;s arm?  Or the doorbell?  Suppose I want to tell it to wait \n&gt; until the toast pops up, then put it on a plate.  What&#39;s the verb for \n&gt; that?  All these sorts of things are easy to cover with RPC, or OO-type \n&gt; predicates, where you can make up verbs at will.  Is REST just not \n&gt; suited to these sorts of situations?\n\nI don&#39;t know whether REST is suited to these or not. Clearly it could\nbe done... it&#39;s a bit like turing completeness. Forth is turing\ncomplete, but you wouldn&#39;t want to write a webapp in it. However, it\nis very good for control situations like robotics.\n\nI don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying &quot;RPC is always wrong&quot; because clearly it\nisn&#39;t. Actually it might be just what you want in a robotic\nsituation. You&#39;ve probably got a very heavy session based\ncommunication protocol with a robot.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
