I&#39;m not sure whether 407\n&gt; Not Acceptable, 409 Conflict, or 400 Bad Request is best. Currently I\n&gt; use 400 but the rfc says this error code should be avoided and the\n&gt; server should aim to be as specific as possible.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t use &quot;406 Not Acceptable&quot; - this indicates that the format of the\n/response/ doesn&#39;t match what the request asked for.\nProblems with the format of the request probably should use &quot;415 Unsupported\nMedia Type&quot; - &quot;The server is refusing to service the request because the\nentity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource\nfor the requested method&quot;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Does it make sense to have a dummy &#39;new&#39; resource that is the\n&gt; target of resource creation request? You could ask what the result of\n&gt; GET /app/rest/container/new is and I&#39;m not sure since it rarely makes\n&gt; sense. This leads me to believe resource creation should be done by a\n&gt; POST to the container where POST means &#39;Append&#39;. The rfc is not\n&gt; completely clear on the difference in this unique case--it seems to\n&gt; indicate either PUT or POST works.\nI&#39;d recomment using POST as well.\n\n\n\n"}}
