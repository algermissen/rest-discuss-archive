That third entity would have permissions unto itself. Fun...\n\n&gt; The issue of the composite resources, i.e. the\n&gt; /site/changes resource is more problematic, the publisher would need to\n&gt; filter notifications based on the subscribers permissions.\nYou have to filter on the current state of the subscribers GET (&#39;read&#39;)\npermission on the resource - somewhat intensive, unless you are willing to\nlive with latency, and then you could have the subscription(s) listen for\nchanges to permissions on the subscribed resource. (it sounds complicate,\nbut honest it really isn&#39;t - i&#39;ve done this stuff with RDBs as the backend\nand it was very straightforward...)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a concern that we as an industry need to keep on building users,\n&gt; permissions and subscriptions. Why have we still not\n&gt; standardized/componentized these things sufficiently well that we can\n&gt; concentrate on the information, which is where the real value and\n&gt; benefits lie?\nI&#39;m amazed that OSes don&#39;t ship with all four aspects out of the box - file\nsystems are fine for information (ignoring searchability), but there are no\ncommon/standardized subscription mechanisms on that and certainly no common\ndirectory systems. Heck, my OutlookExpress address book is my personal\ndirectory service - I&#39;d love to have LDAP into that thing...\n\n\n\n"}}
