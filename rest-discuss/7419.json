As long as the author is clear that \n&gt; &gt; these patterns are n=\r\not defined by REST and that there are \n&gt; &gt; other ways to build RESTful inte=\r\nrfaces then I think its fine.\n&gt; I agree - after I sent my comments I though=\r\nt that maybe the page\nwasn&#39;t a\n&gt; tutorial on REST, so much as how that part=\r\nicular framework does\nthings. But\n&gt; there are portions that are not server =\r\nframework specific - like the\n&gt; description of a second DELETE request fail=\r\ning. Describing those\ncorrectly\n&gt; doesn&#39;t hurt.\n\nSo DELETE just indicates t=\r\nhe intent to transition to a deleted state.\n Thus applying DELETE to a dele=\r\nted resource is successful because the\noutcome is a deleted resource.  Corr=\r\nect?  \n\nJust to make sure, is that the generally accepted interpretation?\n\n=\r\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://www.mindtouch.com\nhttp://www.opengarde=\r\nn.org\n\n\n"}}
