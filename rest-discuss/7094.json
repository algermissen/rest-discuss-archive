POST and its partial meaning of &#39;add to collection&#39;  \nare HTTP specific,\nthey have no relation to the architectural style &#39;REST&#39;.\n\nHTTP would be just as RESTful if it did not define POST at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to make use of this for the configuration of a hierarchical\n&gt; service container about as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /container  :  answer a representation of the container&#39;s  \n&gt; configuration (port, max threads, ...) including links to all services\nRight.\n(You do plan to do this as an Atom feed I hope :-)\n\n&gt; PUT /container :   reconfigure the container\nWhat does &#39;reconfigure&#39; mean here?\n(As a rule of thumb, let the server deal with the &#39;isness&#39; of the  \ncollections and not bother the clients with needing to have knowledge  \nabout\nsuch things)\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /container:   add service\n\nYes\n&gt; GET /container/{service}:  answer service configuration\nYes (set aside what you mean by &#39;service&#39;).\n\n&gt; PUT /container/{service}:  add/reconfigure service\nNo, add is not PUT. PUT is &#39;set state to&#39;\n\n\n&gt; DELETE /container/{service}: remove service\n\nYes\n&gt;\n&gt; So far so good. However, I&#39;m unsure about the significance of the  \n&gt; service configuration links in the container resource. PUTting to  \n&gt; the container resource with fewer service links, should that  \n&gt; indicate the deletion of a service? Or should I ignore those?\n\nI&#39;d say ignore. If you really have to PUT to collections, make sure  \nyou use Etags (to avoid lost updates) and if the collections are  \nlarge, consider using PATCH which you could use with a delta. (Not  \nsure about the standardization issues related to PATCH - I think it  \nis HTTP 1.0 but &#39;d have to look that up.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I&#39;d like to GET/PUT the _entire_ configuration (container +  \n&gt; services) in one representation, i.e. one that contains the service  \n&gt; configurations in the container configuration instead of links.\n&gt; PUTting that representation to /container would then also create,  \n&gt; reconfigure or delete services.\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you represent that?\nThis is primarily a question of the media type. Which one do you  \nintend to use or do you want to roll your own?\n\n&gt; A different URI? A different MIME-Type? GET /container with accept:  \n&gt; application/entireconfiguration+xml vs application/ \n&gt; containerconfiguration+xml\nWhat is your requirement...and remember to keep it simple :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Or I could use the same mime type but make the child  \n&gt; representations optional in the schema: GET /container always  \n&gt; includes the service configurations including their individual  \n&gt; links, embedded in a &lt;services&gt; element. PUTting a representation  \n&gt; that does not include said &lt;services&gt; element would only update the  \n&gt; container resource. Including the &lt;services&gt; element would indicate  \n&gt; that I want to configure all services at once, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that make sense to you?\nI have found that rolling your own media type is too much of an  \neffort. I think that one of the major promises of Atom is that you  \ncan use Atom to do the bulk load of your integration solution and  \nAtom extensions to handle the particularities. Specifying an Atom  \nextension is just the right granularity of work a usual design/ \ndevelopment team can cope with. Media types are not.\n\nAtom lets you focus on the essentials or your domain specifics.\n\nBut hearing about your use cases would definitely help.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
