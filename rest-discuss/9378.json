Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, we really intend for stuff that&#39;s removed to be gone for good,\n&gt; may as well free up some resources.  It&#39;s really easy to do a case\n&gt; switch based on whether filesize is zero, i.e. false.  That particular\n&gt; was suggested by one of my coders to reduce the amount of code, and\n&gt; I&#39;m always in favor of using less code to get the job done.\n\nClarification: I don&#39;t have any objections to the zero-byte file. It&#39;s\nthe zero-byte PUT that disturbs me, perhaps irrationally. &quot;Did they\nmean to delete this resource, or did the body of the PUT get misplaced\ndue to an error?&quot;\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t have enough information about Wirebird to make any firm\n&gt; judgments, but the interaction you describe sounds un-RESTful to me.\n&gt; If you&#39;re the server administrator, then disallow any PUT that would\n&gt; break the system by returning a 400 Bad Request or a 403 Forbidden\n&gt; (both indicate &quot;do not repeat&quot; without somehow altering the request,\n&gt; i.e. an auth header) instead of assigning non-generic semantics to PUT.\n&gt; Or, redirect the user to the appropriate URL so they can repeat the\n&gt; request.\n\nYou lost me there. If they want to replace the username with something\ninvalid, sure, they get one of a variety of 4xx responses depending on\nwhat the problem is. No issues there.\n\n&gt; To answer your &quot;what if something happens&quot; question, my response is\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s why you don&#39;t use PUT if the interaction semantics are move.&quot;\n\nBut that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying: the PUT works *best* since you&#39;re not\nleaving the server going &quot;Okay, I got rid of the old version... now\nwhat? Hello?&quot; if your client falls off the net partway through a move\ndone with DELETE+POST. Wasn&#39;t that what you were suggesting?\n\n&gt; If the PUT was successful, then the 20x response lied, as the move\n&gt; happened so fast that to the client, the 307 response was never updated\n&gt; beyond getting marked &quot;stale&quot; in every intermediary including the client\n&gt; cache.  Kinda like anti-scaling.  ;-)\n\nHmm.  I think I&#39;m going to have to work through this example a bit\nmore before I give a real response, since I&#39;m not quite seeing it as\nthe same thing on a first read.\n\n"}}
