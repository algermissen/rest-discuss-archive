Do I also send a new\n&gt; state of a Hand which is now Petting and hyperlink that to a Person?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or do I bundle up the Who with the What?\n&gt;\nI think this is an important issue for real world applications. A simple\napproach is to have the request message reference the principal under whose\nauthority the request is to be carried out - essentially the user ID (or\n&#39;was carried out&#39; for events). A more complex approach would involve\nverifying the sender has the authority to act on behalf of the principal -\nessentially credentials/password (or sessionId or capabilities, etc.).\nIt would be interesting to make the link to the principal a full URI - and\nallow for relative references, etc.\nI haven&#39;t seen this done though, so it&#39;s new ground.\n\nFor the standby of HTTP, the Authorization header provides an extensible\nformat for identifying principals and providing credentials. But I&#39;m not too\nsure I like the handshaking/negotiating of usernames/passwords in HTTP - I\ndon&#39;t know of a way for the server to hand out (transient) credentials to\nthe client - at least not with Web browser user-agents.\n\n"}}
