Actually, I\nquite like the\nphrase &#39;Enterprise Mashup&#39; since it lightens the gravity of that\n&#39;Enterprise&#39; word.\n\nEnterprise Mashup Markup Language* is the nearest thing to this that I\nknow about, but\nFOREST is quite different: it is much simpler and is /only/ a REST Pattern.\n\n* http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/createMashupScript.html\n\n----------------------\n\nPatterns can be implemented in frameworks...\n\nA FOREST implementation would inevitably be over HTTP. It would\ninitially be just XHTML\nor Atom.  I imagine fetching XHTML resources within which are expected\nto be links to\nmore such documents.  Any XHTML could depend on any other, and they&#39;re all\ninterlinked.  If you depend on another resource, you must have found it\ndirectly or\nindirectly through links in your body.  Alternative discovery: a\nresource could be told\nthat it is being watched using an HTTP header in the GET request listing\nthe URIs of\nthe resources that depend on it - then it could watch and link back.\nEtag would be used\nfor an automatically incremented version number.\n\n----------------------\n\nI would ideally see this work towards a formal description via &#39;rough\nconsensus and\nworking code&#39;. I intend to knock up a prototype of FOREST in a Jetty\nservlet and post\nit to GitHub; if that code works, I may get rough consensus...\n\nWhat a FOREST XHTML/HTTP formalisation would specify:\n\n  + link-rels in XHTML heads to watched resources found through body links\n  + use of HTTP headers (Etag, Cache-Control, Content-Location, Observers*)\n  + API*: doc builder, XPath body get/set*, set-observe*, callbacks\n(observed, notified*)\n\n  * - &#39;Observers&#39; is a possible name for the header with the URIs of\ndependent resources\n    - the API would be language-independent, but probably Java-like\n    - the XPath would be extended to jump links from doc to doc\n    - &#39;set-observe&#39; adds the link-rel, so watched resource URIs can be\npersisted\n    - &#39;notified&#39; means being told when the GET returns with the observed\nstate\n\nWhat a FOREST Java servlet and client library would implement &#39;under&#39;\nthese specs:\n\n  + a driver module loader: drivers animate resources through the API\n  + a document cache - in memory and maybe saved to disk or database\n\nResource animation would either be by the application of business rules\ndriving the\nAPI, or by adapting between external state and the API.\n\n----------------------\n\nWhat do you think?
