With\n&gt; REST, it seems, it would be better to just let each object have\n&gt; a URI and access that, but if I then want to access related\n&gt; objects that would mean that I would have to do subsequent\n&gt; calls to fetch them (i.e. no eagerloading is possible). The\n&gt; good side of this seems to be that the accesses are easily\n&gt; cacheable, whereas fetching a graph would not be since each\n&gt; call would require a slightly different graph most likely.\n\nMostly that’s how it is. Of course, resources needn’t be distinct\nentities nor need they be static; they can overlap and they can\nbe computed. F.ex. a search engine returns a computed resource,\nand with some kind of collection resource mechanism such as feeds\nyou can deliver a representation of several combined resources at\nonce. In other words you seem to be looking for Atom (possibly\nalong with AtomPub) plus some kind of query interface – maybe\nOpenSearch, maybe roll-your-own.\n\nDo be aware of HTTP pipelining also.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
