I think you pointed out some clear arguments =\r\nfor something i had only a gut feeling.\n\nIf i understand this correctly, i =\r\ncould link to an opensearch compatibel resource with an URI Template based =\r\non this specification AND the rel=3D&quot;search&quot; attribute specified by [1]?\n\nF=\r\nurthermore, I=B4m playing around with the HAL specification [2]. I=B4m aski=\r\nng myself, if i can provide an URI template instead of an URI. Based on you=\r\nr comment, that URI templates are valid URIs and a link=B4s relation semant=\r\nic is defined by a specification, i think i can.\n\nThis would allow linking =\r\n(highly dynmic) resource collections with a single URI Template without tig=\r\nht coupling.

Such a link relation specification must include two =\r\nthings:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) It must specifiy that the URI references used are to be inte=\r\nrpreted as templates (because a template URI is a valid URI and you cannot =\r\ntell the difference if you do not know up front that you are given a templa=\r\nte URI reference).\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) What parameters the client might encounter and wh=\r\nat they mean.\n&gt;\n&gt; An example of this is the opensearch specification[1].\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#Ope=\r\nnSearch_1.1_parameters\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------=\r\n------\n\nYahoo!
