Anyone with authorization could then use the system\n&gt; &gt; from any Web browser, instead of first needing to download and\n&gt; &gt; install some sort of specialized client component.  The former is\n&gt; &gt; the whole point of REST as an alternative to the latter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Whenever the browser have javascript enabled the difference\n&gt; disappear, don&#39;t you think?\n&gt; \n\nNo.  Hypertext markup is declarative code, javascript is not.  An\ninterface written in markup is easy to decipher (self-documenting);\njavascript, not so much.\n\nBTW, what I meant by specialized client component, is a custom\napplication, not code-on-demand.  When your application interfaces are\nusing HTML, you get lots of value-added benefits, primarily\naccessibility.  If your hypertext interface is WADL it won&#39;t be\naccessible to those using alternative reading/input devices.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seem that this is a deployment point. In the Fielding dissertation\n&gt; he talks about java applets.\n&gt; \n\nCode-on-demand is an optional constraint, because it reduces\nvisibility.  Thus, it is not a substitute for selecting, or creating,\nan appropriate media type.  Code-on-demand has its uses, sure; making\nWADL human-interactive in lieu of using HTML is not one of them --\ndoing that violates the self-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
