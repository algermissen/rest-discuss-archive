I have a feeli=\r\nng there&#39;s a mismatch between my semantics and the community&#39;s.\n\nI&#39;ve seen =\r\nit said over and over again that passing session IDs (typically in a cookie=\r\n) is generally considered unRESTful.  I&#39;ve also seen it said over and over =\r\nagain that passing credentials along with every request is considered very =\r\nRESTful.\n\nThe reasonings are unclear to me, though.  Considering the &quot;state=\r\nlessness&quot; principle of REST, if I think of a RESTful architecture as one in=\r\n which every request passes all the information needed for the server to fu=\r\nlfill the request, then I don&#39;t see how passing session IDs (for instance) =\r\nin requests violates that principle.\n\nTo me, a session ID is a simple alpha=\r\nnumeric string.  Authentication credentials are (typically expressed as) a =\r\nsimple alphanumeric string.  Both strings persist on the client.  Both stri=\r\nngs are received by the server and are compared to information held on the =\r\nserver in order to make decisions on the server about how to process the re=\r\nquest, and thus the content of the strings can dramatically affect the serv=\r\ner&#39;s response to the request.\n\nWhen approached from this way, I lose the me=\r\naning behind the distinction.  What am I misunderstanding?\n\n\n"}}
