For example, PUT-ing:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; will be retrieved using GET as:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;test/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I know this issue has come up several times on this\n&gt; list, but it is interesting to see that one major vendor\n&gt; at least has interpreted the semantics of PUT in a data-centric\n&gt; way as opposed to a document-centric way.  I tend to agree\n&gt; with their approach as it makes PUT much more useful.\n\nI don&#39;t think this is a document-vs-data thing.  I think that this is a\nsemantics-vs-syntax thing.  Since &quot;&lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;test/&gt;&quot; are\nsemantically equivalent, an xml parser *should* handle the document exactly\nthe same way.\n\nAnd yes, I (imho) think this attitude makes PUT much more powerful without\ncrippling it&#39;s functionality.  I think that any client application that\nwould choke on receiving &quot;&lt;test/&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;&quot; would indicate\na badly designed client, not a badly designed server.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
