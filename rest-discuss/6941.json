Bowman wrote: \n&gt;&gt; What Technorati should do, is have people submit their feed URLs, \n&gt;&gt; then do a HEAD request or a conditional GET to determine if any \n&gt;&gt; changes have been made.\n\nLooking at my Technorati ping page, I see the following:\n\nhttp://www.technorati.com/ping/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mikeschinkel.com%2Fblog?url=\nhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.mikeschinkel.com%2Fblog&ip=1\n\nIs that not submitting my URL?  I&#39;m confused still.\n\n&gt;&gt; Another way, is to make a URI for each subscriber to PUT a new \n&gt;&gt; &lt;updated&gt; value to.  \n\nAn updated value of what?  The content in my RSS feed?  If yes, then that\nputs the responsibility for correctness on the blog owner whereas Technorati\nwould wants to improve the chances of it being done correctly.  Does that\nmean in REST the client is given responsibility for data quality?\n\n&gt;&gt; The Technorati ping isn&#39;t really manipulating a resource using \n&gt;&gt; POST, it&#39;s submitting program logic to an endpoint.  The payload \n&gt;&gt; is not a representation of any resource (try to GET that URL).  \n\nGET which URL?  The Technorati URL, or the one I pass to Techorati (I assume\nthe former?)  If the former, does that mean all resources must return a\nrepresenation for GET?  Are there no &quot;write-only&quot; semantics in REST?\n\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s &quot;Call method weblogUpdates.ping with the following parameters.&quot;  \n&gt;&gt; A remote procedure call involves the transfer of a state transition \n&gt;&gt; request, not a representation of a resource.\n\nOkay, at least that part&#39;s now understandable.  But since you mentioned it,\nother than it not being RESTful, what&#39;s the downside of doing it this way?\n\n&gt;&gt; Since Bob is no longer in Maryland, the server should also change Bob&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; location to &quot;unspecified.&quot;  In another PUT request, Bob could be added \n&gt;&gt; to Virginia.  The result of the diff() would show this, and the server \n&gt;&gt; could change Bob&#39;s location from &quot;unspecified&quot; to &quot;Virginia.&quot;\n\nThat sounds a lot like a database trigger.  So it is RESTful to update a\nsecond resource when you PUT to a first one?\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n \n\n\n\n"}}
