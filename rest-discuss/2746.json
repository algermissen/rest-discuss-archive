These operations are the methods as specified in the HTTP\nspec - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\nA GET message is requesting a representation of the resource identified by\nthe URL (also called the URI).\nA POST message is requesting that data carried along with the request be\nused by the resource to &#39;extend&#39; the resource. This &#39;extend&#39; could be many\nthings. For example, it could add an entry to a log, or add a file to a\ndirectory, etc. If a new resource is created, the response to the POST\nrequest can identify the URL of this new resource.\n\n&gt; And while we&#39;re at it, what&#39;s a good reference to understand the four\ntransactions supported by HTTP?\nHTTP has more than four methods - and new methods can be added.\nThe spec has good detail, but I would like to see other descriptions also. I\nonce read a book with a frog on it that talked alot about HTTP, but haven&#39;t\nseen it in a while.\n\n&gt; How about good background reading on HTTPS?\nI don&#39;t know.\n\n\n"}}
