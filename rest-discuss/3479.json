Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think dereferenceable MIME types are a bad idea.\n&gt; Domain names change ownership all the time.\n&gt; Organizations evolve.  Accidents happen.  Think\n&gt; about allowing microsoft to change the definition\n&gt; of application/msword whenever they want! (oh,\n&gt; nevermind ;-))\n\nTrue.  However, there are safeguards (which may or may not be resistant to\nthese issues):\n\n1) Use PURLs.  Hmm... we could change &quot;type-uri&quot; to &quot;purl&quot; and just use the\nPURL mechanism.  :)\n2) Do not use a dereferencable URI scheme.  Heck, we could even come up with\none specifically for this purpose.  It would even be able to adress your\nother comment about the &quot;[ease of remembering] the names of MIME type you\nactually use.&quot;\n3) Just because a specification changes doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s bad.  As long\nas the specification has its own versioning built in, it would be no\ndifferent than asking for an &quot;image/gif&quot; without knowing whether you will\nget back an 87a or 89a version.\n4) I want to point out that the dereferencability of a of a URI is a\nconvenience only in my proposal.  In order to determine whether a given\nmedia-type is recognized, the URI must be interpreted as a string only.\n\nI should point out that this technique should not replace the existing\nregistration process.  The regular registration process has much value in of\nitself.  If anything, this technique is a cross between using the &quot;x-&quot; and\nfull registration.  For the very reasons you point out above, people should\nnot rely on them as much as you would for a registered media-type.  On the\nother hand, the use of a URI allows for additional authority and guarantee\nof uniqueness that &quot;x-&quot; does not.  For instance, RSS 1.0 is an RDF document\nwhile RSS 2.0 is not.  It would not make sense to use &quot;application/rss+xml&quot;\nfor both of them (which doesn&#39;t even appear to be a registered media type).\nOn the other hand, if each had something like:\n\nRSS 1.0 : application/type-uri;uri=&quot;http://example.invalid/rss10&quot;\nRSS 2.0 : application/type-uri;uri=&quot;http://sample.invalid/rss20&quot;\n\nThere would be no mistaking which is which.\n\n&gt; Anything wrong with the vnd- system?\n\nThis still requires you to register each new subtype.\n\n\nI am not convinced myself that this is the right way to go about doing\nthings.  It&#39;s just that I have adde conneg to an application and suddenly\nrealized just how useless it can be, both in terms of support for it and in\nterms of the available media-types out there.  This is just an attempt to\nanswer my own frustration at it all.  In truth, I would like a better\nsolution, but until one comes along would this one &quot;work&quot;?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
