The good thing about\ndoing that is that an intermediary would know that /search has changed\nstate due to the POST, whereas if it went to /add, the state change\nwould be transparent and the intermediary wouldn&#39;t know.  Also,\n/search may not be the best name if you&#39;re posting to it.  What about\nthis?\n\nhttp://www.example.org/database\n\nor, if the database is a list of employees;\n\nhttp://www.example.org/employees\n\n&gt; Now, how should editing and deletion be done? One approach is to \n&gt; expose an edit resource, similar to the add one;\n&gt;   http://www.example.org/edit\n&gt; To edit a specific resource, one could use a query string;\n&gt;   http://www.example.org/edit?resource=theThing\n&gt; and use GET and POST to get the form and POST the edit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach would be to use the resource&#39;s native URI, like\n&gt;   http://www.example.org/records/theThing?mode=edit\n&gt; in a similar manner. This seems to be the approach taken by most\n&gt; WIKIs, interestingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is either approach preferable/horrible, or are they pretty much the\n&gt; same? The specific application is a gateway to an LDAP database. I\n&gt; haven&#39;t read Roy&#39;s full dissertation (still!), so apologies if I&#39;ve\n&gt; asked a FAQ.\n\nAn &quot;edit&quot; should be done with a PUT interface, no?  I know that this\nis problematic given that browsers/HTML only support GET/POST, but if\nyou can afford it (development time, extra code to maintain, performance\nhit with another layer), I&#39;d solve that problem after exposing the PUT\ninterface, perhaps by having a separate Wiki-looking URI that accepts\nPOSTs and treats them as PUTs.\n\ne.g.\n\nhttp://www.example.org/employees?id=234343?pap=true\n\n(&quot;pap&quot; =&gt; &quot;post-as-put&quot;)\n\n&gt; Deletion is another interesting case; if each LDAP entry really is a\n&gt; resource, DELETE would be most appropriate, no? Unfortunately, methods\n&gt; other than GET and POST aren&#39;t available from HTML...\n\nYah.  I&#39;d do much the same as for PUT; build the DELETE interface, then\nkludge a POST interface on top.\n\n&gt; P.S.; Do queries identify a new resource?\n\nYes.  Each unique URI identifies a new resource, modulo generic &\nper-scheme equivalence rules.\n\n&gt; Their defined as a mechanism\n&gt; to pass data to the server. Common use (as outlined above) seems to\n&gt; indicate that people don&#39;t consider them separate, but in the URI\n&gt; world, they&#39;re not lumped into URI-References with fragments...\n\nYou can use them with URI refs;\n\n      URI-reference = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ &quot;#&quot; fragment ]\n      absoluteURI   = scheme &quot;:&quot; ( hier_part | opaque_part )\n      relativeURI   = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]\n      hier_part     = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]\n\nMore on this in that other email I promised.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
