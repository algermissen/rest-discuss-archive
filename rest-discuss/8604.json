Let&#39;s say I have a resource:\n\nhttp://example.org/foo.html\n\nMy implementation of GET responds 200 OK with a representation of foo.html, \nunless foo.html is zero bytes, in which case the response is 410 Gone.\n\nMy implementation of DELETE will respond 200 OK with the string:\n\n&quot;Set to 410 Gone, DELETE again to remove.&quot;\n\nAfter setting foo.html to zero bytes, unless foo.html already was zero \nbytes, in which case foo.html really is deleted.  This second DELETE will \nrespond 204 No Content, subsequent GET requests will be 404 not 410.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
