Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; [. . .]\n&gt; &gt; REST simplifies applications because it rips apart the million\n&gt; &gt; potential states inherent in any serious application and presents\n&gt; &gt; to the client only one at a time, with every single transition\n&gt; &gt; from that state described in a format that can be understood by\n&gt; &gt; the client as a potential transition. The client is completely\n&gt; &gt; decoupled from the server aside from the shared agreement on what\n&gt; &gt; each media type means. The entire application only needs to be\n&gt; &gt; understood (and can be completely tested) one state at a time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This is where I get a little confused.\n&gt;\n&gt; I assume that the client still needs to understand each of the  \n&gt; possible\n&gt; states so that it knows what to do with/at each of those states. I  \n&gt; also\n&gt; assume that the client needs to understand what each of the  \n&gt; transitions\n&gt; (links) out of the current state means so that it can determine  \n&gt; which one\n&gt; to follow.\n\nEach state is described by the current set of representations.\nA client&#39;s understanding will depend on its understanding of the\nmedia types.\n&gt; What happens when the application evolves to include a new\n&gt; state? How does the client figure out what to do with that new state?\n\nThe client doesn&#39;t need to memorize the states, other than the\nfew cool URI &quot;start states&quot; that might be bookmarked.  Each state\ntells it what to do next.  The evolution a client has to worry about\nis when the media type evolves in unanticipated ways, which is the\nsame problem as occurs when new HTML elements are added that a browser\ndoesn&#39;t recognize.  Perhaps a representation is provided such that\nthe new bits can be safely ignored by old clients, or parallel\nstates are introduced for different types of clients, or clients\nare automagically updated through code on demand, or clients\nuse content negotiation on each request.  Those are all typical\nmechanisms for backwards compatibility with clients.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
