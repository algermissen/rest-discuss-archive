Doing the media type is *the* design activity in REST - pu=\r\nt someone on the job who knows what she is doing :-) As you would for an AP=\r\nI in the OO world. Eh?\n\n&gt; without requiring constant and ongoing revisions =\r\nwhich pretty much moots the benefit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also (IMO) I don&#39;t think there is=\r\n a real value unless the media type is shared by a lot of users (which also=\r\n argues against media type proliferation.) For example if FreshBooks, Wave,=\r\n Xero, Kashoo, Outright, FreeAgent, Harvest etc. each were to all create th=\r\neir own media type for their own web APIs they would not provide much value=\r\n over hardcoded URLs.\n\nOh, of course they would:\n\n[1] Aiming at converging =\r\nsome of the types in the long run is at least approachable. Forget that wit=\r\nh APIs. Re-use sometimes goes against corporate strategy, but why not image=\r\n a generic shopping mobile app that can work with many shops using a single=\r\n media type. Wouldn&#39;t shop X have a reason to want to enable that app too? =\r\nWhat about price search engines?\n\n&gt; OTOH if they all got together and creat=\r\ned an &quot;application/accounting&quot; media type then I could see huge benefit.  (=\r\nHmm.  Maybe there is something there...)\n\nWell, that&#39;s the &#39;unified data mo=\r\ndel&#39; discussion from the 90ies. Not gonna happen :-) But, consider this: RE=\r\nST leaves exactly one spot where you can put your semantics, that is the me=\r\ndia type (and link rels for that matter, I keep lumping these together). Th=\r\ne rest of REST (hah!) is uniform. Having variation take place in only one s=\r\npot greatly simplifies integration (much easier to convert yourOrder.xml to=\r\n myOrder.json than it is to have yourOrderAPI-client talk to myOrderAPI.)\n\n=\r\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Mike\n\n\n"}}
