Should\na\n&gt;403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?  Only 409 talks about\n&gt;informing the client of how the problem might be fixed.  However, 409\ntalks\n&gt;about conflicts with the resource.  I would not consider an error in the\n&gt;request entity to be a &quot;conflict&quot;, as it was never even compared to the\n&gt;existing resource (if one even exists).  On the other hand, 403 doesn&#39;t\n&gt;contain any language about correcting the problem and trying again (but\nit\n&gt;also doesn&#39;t say *not* to do so), though it does say that the response\n&gt;should indicate the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, is 403 the prefered response or is it 409?\n&gt;\n\n\nWell all 4xx codes indicate a problem with the request.\nHave you got a specific example? Do you mean something like missing\nrequired information from a POST request?\n\nI tend to use 400 for that sort of error, but I just checked, and 400\nis explicitly for syntactic errors, rather than semantic ones. So I\nguess that that isn&#39;t really right either. Is 400 intended only for\nsyntactic errors at the HTTP level such as illegal URIs, or would it\nbe allowed for syntactic errors at a higher level, such as if you\ntried to PUT or POST a corrupt document, or refered to a badly formatted\nidentifier?\n\n403 doesn&#39;t sound right to me, because I&#39;ve always seen it as a kind\nof &quot;get lost&quot; response for requests that have broke some sort of\nout-of-band policy, such as for IP restricted sites, but I notice that\nin the HTTP1.0 RFC, the description of 403 suggests that it can \nbe used when other status codes are inappropriate, but that is for\n1.0.\n\nWebDAV defines a &quot;422 Unprocessable entity&quot; status for semantic\nproblems with the XML request, and uses 400 if the XML request is not\nproperly formed. I don&#39;t see why WebDAV would be a special case here,\nso that sounds wrong too.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t worry about 403 not specifying that the body should contain\ninstructions on how to remedy the problem though, because the text\ndescribing\n4xx codes in general says that the server SHOULD include a body describing\nthe\nerror for all of these codes.\n\n-- \nDave\n\r\n--=_b422b157c06c860e465a9ac9bbc857f9--\r\n\n"}}
