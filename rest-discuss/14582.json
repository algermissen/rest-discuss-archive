What would a\n&gt;&gt; coding environment look like if it was meant to encourage results that\n&gt;&gt; followed a particular _architectural_ style (not programming style).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IOW, is there a way to craft a framework that constrains developers in\n&gt;&gt; ways that results in a REST-ful implementation of the application?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I did some digging, but have yet to find any writing on this topic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here are some &quot;off-the-top-of-my-head&quot; items:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, a framework might exhibit these REST-like traits:\n&gt;&gt; - there is a clear separation of concerns between resource\n&gt;&gt; identifiers, resources, and representations\n&gt;&gt; - developers must define a resource as the public application interface\n&gt;&gt; - the Uniform Interface is enforced (e.g. those methods are the only\n&gt;&gt; public members exposed for a resource)\n&gt;\n&gt; You seem to be equating resource with programming language object, but not\n&gt; all languages are OO (and in fact I would argue the truly useful and\n&gt; productive ones are not).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any comments? Is this line of thinking pure folly? old hat? already\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; resolved sufficiently?\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps take a look at webmachine, starting specifically with this page:\n&gt; &lt;http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/wiki/WebmachineMechanics&gt;\n&gt; You can also read more by going to the top of the wiki there.
