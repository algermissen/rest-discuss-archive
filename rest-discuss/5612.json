Each\nmix is completely specified by two identifiers in a=\r\n specific order and\nits representation would be an mp3 file.  Although a UR=\r\nI for each\nresource could exist, there would be too many combinations to st=\r\nore\nall possible mixed mp3 files on the origin server simultaneously (and\nm=\r\naybe some that would never be requested).  It would therefore\nnecessary to =\r\ngenerate them when required in a batch process and cache\nthe most recently =\r\nrequested files on disk for future requests.\n\nFrom the clients perspective =\r\nI see two possible states of the resource\n(neglecting errors): &#39;mixing&#39; and=\r\n &#39;complete&#39;.  I was thinking the\nsimplest approach would be to have a singl=\r\ne URI for each combination\nof mixed audio files. While mixing it would be r=\r\nepresented by an XML\nmessage indicating an estimated time at which the file=\r\n can be\ndereferenced from this same URI. The mp3 would then be made\navailab=\r\nle from this URI when completed and cached.  Does representing\ndifferent st=\r\nates of a single resource with different MIME types\nviolate REST?\n\nGiven th=\r\nat the &#39;mixing&#39; and &#39;complete&#39; states are determined\nindirectly by the clie=\r\nnts requests, and the server decides how long\nthey should be cached, I reas=\r\non that it is only necessary for the\nclient to GET the current representati=\r\nons of this state.  In this case\nis it reasonable to represent the mixing s=\r\ntate with a &#39;202 Accepted&#39;\nstatus code to indicate processing is not yet co=\r\nmplete, even though\nthe client has not explicitly requested that this proce=\r\nss be performed\nwith say POST or PUT?.\n\nAny thoughts on this or other ways =\r\nto solve this type of problem in a\nRESTful manner would be much appreciated=\r\n.\n\nCheers,\nTom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
