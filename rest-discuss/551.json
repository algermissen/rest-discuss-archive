If a resource has more than one named collection\nthat&#39;s even more fun. If it has one &#39;default&#39; un-named collection its easier\nto use the URL sub-path pattern matching approach (but, like you said, URI\nopaqueness will break, as well as the &#39;web-ness&#39; of the Web).\n\nDoing this URI pattern stuff will be really powerful but only for a sub-set\nof all applications. So that&#39;ll probably end up at the application level and\nrequire documentation of &#39;my way&#39; of doing things.\n\nIf I were doing my own app and had multiple named collections per resource\nI&#39;d use\n\nWATCH /foo/bar;children\nWATCH /foo/bar;referrers\nWATCH /foo/bar;permissions\nWATCH /foo/bar (implies /foo/bar;*)\n\nIf I didn&#39;t have named collections but had one &#39;default&#39; collection I&#39;d use:\nWATCH /foo/bar?method=ADD\n\n\n\n"}}
