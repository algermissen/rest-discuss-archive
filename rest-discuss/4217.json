Alexander Jacobson \nwrote:\n\n&gt; Isolation is a red herring.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Does the value returned when a third party GETs\n&gt; a resource change before your transaction that\n&gt; modified that resource COMMITs/ABORTs?\n\nThat is what &quot;isolation&quot; means.  If you have isolation, others\nwon&#39;t see the resource change.  If you don&#39;t, they will.\n\n&gt; 2. Does your transaction fail if any of the values\n&gt; it retrieved via GET changes before you try to\n&gt; COMMIT?\n&gt;\n&gt; If #1==yes, you don&#39;t have Atomicity.\n\nYes. If the server wants atomicity, it must selectively lock or\nisolate anything that changes during the transaction.  So what?\n\n&gt; If #1==no, you might not have REST (GET depends on a cookie or conneg).\n\nFalse.  Conneg is part of REST.  Besides, the request messages will\nhave to be marked as no-cache in order for any transaction to work.\n\n&gt; If #2==yes, you don&#39;t have HTTP (GET is not idempotent).\n\nFalse.  GET can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n&gt; If #2==no, you don&#39;t have Consistency (You can&#39;t guarantee not to \n&gt; violate invariants)\n\nNo, the question is bogus.  If any of the non-GET transactions fail\ndue to a change in the state of the resource, then the transaction\nshould fail.  The server is fully capable of determining that on\nits own using existing conditional mechanisms like If-Match.\n\n&gt; #2 means that transactions are incompatible w/ HTTP.\n&gt; #1 means that they may also be independtly incompatible with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether #1==no is compatibility with REST depends\n&gt; on whether Roy blesses transaction headers as\n&gt; being more like Con-Neg or condemns them as being\n&gt; more like Cookies.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you just implement it and figure it out for yourself.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
