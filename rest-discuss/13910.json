Because \notherwise it tends to be seen a little diminishing for everybody that \nfalls in your categories.\n\n&quot;They like buzz words, so they follow REST just because it is cool and \nall people talk about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;someone told them REST is a way to do services without SOAP. So they \nfollow...&quot;\n\n&quot;someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things with URIs&quot;\n\n&quot;so they follow REST doing whatever they want.&quot;\n\n&quot;They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.&quot;\n\n&quot;They think REST is a web api for CRUD. Simple.&quot;\n\nNow I appreciate a good irony when it is said... ironically. But now you \nsay that this is not a &quot;humorous&quot; post but it should be taken literally, \nbecause &quot;the intention is to identify how is the REST term used and \nunderstood.&quot; And we have to identify ourselves in one of the groups you \nmention, most of them &quot;because it&#39;s cool&quot;, because &quot;someone told then&quot; \nand &quot;so they follow&quot;, practically all of them described in terms that \nare either humorous or (xor) diminishing...\n\nI myself think I can fall in more than one group, but I prefer to think \nthat is because I&#39;m in a early stage of working with REST and I have \nlot&#39;s of things yet to grasp and little time to do it, and not just \nbecause I found REST cool and all people talk about it., or because \nsomeone told me something and I just follow, or because I&#39;m shallow \nenough to believe REST is HTTP, or naive enough to think is simple \nCRUD... That would be to dismiss a person as of little intelligence, not \nto say other harsh words...\n\nFinally, do you really believe there is only a person that knows REST as \nit actually is and understands it, being that person Roy, or is that \npart irony/humorous? Because I don&#39;t belong to that particular group for \nsure, but to some people on this list that wrote lot&#39;s of good articles \nin blogs from which I learned a lot that is, at least, unfair...\n\nNot that I think your intention was that, of course.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Bill.\n&gt; Not sure of your intention with the comment. Sounds like \n&gt; disapprovement, due to the negative conception of the &quot;stereotype&quot; \n&gt; word. Not even sure of your idea of my idea by writing the list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me state it again:\n&gt; &quot;I love doing so sometimes (Naming things) to know what am I referring to&quot;\n&gt; &quot;I guess it helps understand where are we standing in terms of REST \n&gt; usability and knowledge.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I had been in hundreds of discussions. Most of the time, two people \n&gt; discuss about different things that are named the same. So, my first \n&gt; action is to clarify what I mean by that name. Just as I did now with \n&gt; my idea in the lines above.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, let&#39;s start again: I&#39;ve created a classification of the common \n&gt; understandings people that I&#39;ve read and discussed with, had shown \n&gt; related to REST. The intention is to identify how is the REST term \n&gt; used and understood. It makes no sense to put a face on each class, \n&gt; when we want common behavior for analysis.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry if taken as a bad thing. Not my intention.\n&gt;\n&gt; William.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Assign a person to each of your stereotypes, let them and everyone else\n&gt; &gt; know.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still a good idea?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bill\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; willmarpo wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reading through all this good material about REST, I find some old \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussions around. Someone suggested naming things is not so \n&gt; good, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I love doing so somethings to know what am I referring to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I wanted to present a \n&gt; classification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did two days ago while riding the bus to work. Silly? It may be, \n&gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guess it helps understand where are we standing in terms of REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *API Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually \n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Subcategories:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This are the ones that think REST is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So their discussions are solely \n&gt; focused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on URIs, and their presentations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *RPCers*. Bad group that think REST is a way to map RPC in disguise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using URIs in a web API. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak \n&gt; RPC at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST \n&gt; is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; API for exposing things on the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*: Another repeated group. They think REST is a web api for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Mappers*: This other category may use the API idea, but they \n&gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work to be done is to map\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all that is know used to that new type. Interesting?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*. Again, the idea is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call their systems \n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t he reminders of the types.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *Standard Haters*: Here you have all those that think Standards are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you have the freedom to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they follow REST doing whatever they want.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *KISS lovers*. This are the ones that like thinks to be simple. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in this group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and someone told them \n&gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to do services without SOAP. So they follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so \n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is cool and all people talk about it. \n&gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are some Buzz creators too, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA. \n&gt; No pun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intended on REST-*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the group that \n&gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST as it actually is and understan ds it. That may be a one person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group (yes Roy).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m may not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying they are good, at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Do you find yourself in any of those groups?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
