Now, provided that both hosts have access to a chunk of \nshared memory, a cookie containing an index / key into this shared \nmemory space can be set on a client machine. This shared memory space \ncould be anything from a simple file on a network filesystem to a full \nblown, linda-like tuplespace. In any case, the data indexed by the \nclients&#39; cookie may indicate whether a user has logged in or any number \nof other related bits such as user preferences, etc.\n\nThere are a number of variations on the above scheme, depending on the \ntechnologies used, but the basic idea remains the same. A more elegant \nappproach would be to have this shared memory space itself be a web \nserver, exposing this functionality as a service via a RESTful \ninterface. Actaully, the use of cookies turns out to be more of a \nhinderance than anything else, as it limits the usefulness of the \napproach to hosts within the same domain. Using dynamically constructed \nURLs, the above technique can be applied /across domains/, provided the \nnecessary prior arrangements are made between the respective domain \nadministrators.\n\nSo, ultimately, this isn&#39;t really about single sign-on across different \nhosts in the same domain, or even across hosts in different domains, as \nmuch as it is about coordination patterns among distributed actors.\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\n"}}
