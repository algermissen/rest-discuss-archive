Inconsistency/ambiguity (and the resulting\n&gt; security and perform=\r\nance problems) exists when you infer metadata from\n&gt; data (sometimes called=\r\n &quot;sniffing&quot;);\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect.html\n\nAs I said=\r\n we should use specific mime types, but when you cannot fully\ncontrol the p=\r\nublishing, why not use generic a mime type like\napplication/xml, and not be=\r\n so authoritative at protocol level?\n\nI&#39;ll read again in depth the mime res=\r\npect doc and see where I&#39;m wrong.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  In other words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there&#39;s no =\r\npath, using only public specifications, from this message;\n&gt; &gt; I still wond=\r\ner why we don&#39;t have URIs instead of mime types... I\n&gt; &gt; thought that this =\r\nwas on TAG issues list.\n&gt; We do have URIs for media types, they&#39;re just not=\r\n used in any protocols\n&gt; AFAIK.\n&gt; e.g. http://www.iana.org/assignments/medi=\r\na-types/application/xop+xml\n\nOK, I was thinking at something free of iana.o=\r\nrg namespace, I&#39;m\nwaiting at least for dns media type registration.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 Ok\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Content-Type: application/xml\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;html xmlns=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ... to the XHTM=\r\nL specification.\n&gt; &gt; There is namespace, at that location there is a human =\r\nreadable\n&gt; &gt; description of the namespace intent and a hyperlink to the spe=\r\nc,\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, but my point is that there&#39;s no spec that prescribes the proces=\r\ns\n&gt; that you just went through.\n\nSame for the above mime uri, there is a pl=\r\nain text document there, I\nwas expecting at least hypertext.\n\n&gt; On the cont=\r\nrary, RFC 3023 says this;\n&gt;   An XML document labeled as text/xml or applic=\r\nation/xml might contain\n&gt;   namespace declarations, stylesheet-linking proc=\r\nessing instructions\n&gt;   (PIs), schema information, or other declarations th=\r\nat might be used\n&gt;   to suggest how the document is to be processed.  For e=\r\nxample, a\n&gt;   document might have the XHTML namespace and a reference to a =\r\nCSS\n&gt;   stylesheet.  Such a document might be handled by applications that\n=\r\n&gt;   would use this information to dispatch the document for appropriate\n&gt;  =\r\n processing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Emphasis on &quot;might&quot;, aka &quot;ambiguity results if ...&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhat said, most browsers assume application/xml works as you suggest,\n&gt; just=\r\n not all (e.g. IE).  But browsers aren&#39;t the only client of XML.\n&gt;\n&gt; See; h=\r\nttp://www.markbaker.ca/2004/01/XmlDispatchTest/\n\nYes, I wanted somehow to f=\r\norce this browser-like behaviour by a\ngeneric mime type, I still believe th=\r\nat user agents should imply the\nusage of XML based on its vocabulary, when =\r\nthe mime type is generic.\n\nCheers,\n--\nLaurian Gridinoc, www.grapefruit.ro\n\n"}}
