The uris would\nbe something like\n\n    &lt;order-service-uris&gt;\n\t&lt;submit uri=&quot;/orders&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;get-order-by-number uri=&quot;/order-numbers&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;get-new-orders uri=&quot;/new-orders&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/order-service-uris&gt;\n\nTo submit an order, the client POSTs the order to /orders.\n\nTo find an order by order number, the client does a GET on\n/order-numbers, which returns a page of metadata, like for instance:\n\n    &lt;orders&gt;\n\t&lt;ranges&gt;\n\t    &lt;range begin=&quot;375&quot; end=&quot;399&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1201&quot; /&gt;\n\t    &lt;range begin=&quot;400&quot; end=&quot;424&quot; uri=&quot;/db/14287&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;/ranges&gt;\n\t&lt;singleton number=&quot;425&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1798&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;singleton number=&quot;426&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1855&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/orders&gt;\n\nI see the singletons as necessary because a partial range uri must be\nkept forever in case someone cached it, yuck.  This way, when a range is\ncomplete, it is allocated a permanent uri; until then it is returned as\na collection of singletons.\n\nTo get the list of unseen orders, the client does a GET on\n/new-orders, which returns a page of metadata like the above except it&#39;s\nall singletons.  The uris distributed through /order-numbers and\n/new-orders are different for any given order, and:\n\nTo mark an order seen, the client does a DELETE on the uri acquired from\n/new-orders.\n\nDoes this seem like a ReSTful interface?  All nitpicking is welcome, I&#39;m\nstill trying to internalize Roy Fielding&#39;s dissertation and the comments\nI&#39;ve read here over the last month or so.\n\nRegards,\n\nGary Shea\nshea@...\n\n\n\n"}}
