Bowman wrote:\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Exactly, and that&#39;s why RFC 2068 serves as the foundation of WebDAV,\n&gt; that was the state of HTTP 1.1 at the time WebDAV was finalized. Thus\n&gt; were the PATCH method and Link header, etc. written into law...\n&gt; ...\n\nNit: WebDAV nowadays is defined by RFC4918, which *is* based on RFC2616.\n\n&gt; I will grant that RFCs are an imperfect solution, but I won&#39;t argue\n&gt; with their success either. You realize there are errors in RFC 2616,\n&gt; right? That doesn&#39;t mean you really MUST NOT cache 303 responses, in\n&gt; slavish devotion to the letter of the law. Absolute law is the\n&gt; antithesis of trial by jury, and I think some folks are seeing a similar\n&gt; level of constraint in RFCs that was never the intent of the IETF.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, the cachability of 303 responses despite what the spec says, is\n&gt; something you have to just &quot;know&quot; by reading the spec authors&#39;\n&gt; responses to feedback concerning the issue (or by asking them outright).\n&gt; No system is perfect.\n\nOr, the issue tracker: &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/70&gt;.\n\n&gt; A resource can be anything, an IR is limited to documents which may be\n&gt; dereferenced using HTTP. A person can&#39;t be identified by the same URI\n&gt; that identifies a document about that person. The person is a\n&gt; resource, the document is an IR, using the same URI for both is a\n&gt; collision because they are not the same resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; My interpretation of httpRange-14, is that if the URI identifies a\n&gt; person then it MUST NOT return 200 OK, at all, ever. I do not take\n&gt; this to mean that if a URI identifies a document it MUST NOT return\n&gt; 303, at all, ever.\n\nI think that interpretation is not correct. For 200, you simply don&#39;t know.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 303 and 404 representations of a requested URI\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; indicate the value of _some other resource_.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now you&#39;re confusing me, how can a return code be considered a\n&gt;  &gt; representation? It&#39;s teh result of dereferencing, it&#39;s not a\n&gt;  &gt; representation of anything.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re looking at a 503 response page, you&#39;re looking at a\n&gt; representation of the dereferenced resource. The response code, is\n&gt; part of the representation. Quoting REST again:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;REST components perform actions on a resource by using a\n&gt; representation to capture the current or intended state of that\n&gt; resource and transferring that representation between components. A\n&gt; representation is a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to\n&gt; describe those bytes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A 503 response, is a representation of the state of the dereferenced\n&gt; resource, i.e. &quot;busy - check back later&quot;. The sequence of bytes\n&gt; returned in response to the request, is defined as a representation of\n&gt; the requested resource. The set of temporally varying representations\n&gt; of the requested resource, temporarily includes a 503 response in such\n&gt; a case.\n\nNot convinced.\n\nA 503 response is not a representation of the resource you asked for.\n\nIt may be (as Roy just pointed out on the http mailing list) a \nrepresentation of an error resource, but that&#39;s it.\n\n &gt; ...\n\nBR, Julian\n\n\n"}}
