I don&#39;t particularly like any of these, do you?\n\n&gt; Requiring clients to act as HTTP/1.1 servers is a fatal security problem.\n\nWhy?  Running such on a &quot;client&quot; is no worse than running one on a &quot;server&quot; in the\nfirst place.\n\n&gt; No\n&gt; competent security admin would let it happen.\n\nLet&#39;s design for the application, okay, rather than the admin.  Administration is a\nsignificant but separate series of concerns.\n\nWhat about server-server callbacks, meaning callbacks from server-class machine to\nserver-class machine, both in actively administered environments, both already\nrunning HTTP server software?  In this case, you&#39;re not really compromising the\nsecurity of either system, are you?\n\nI would suggest that the scope of this effort is to determine how to allow one\nresource-modeled entity to register an interest in state changes of a second\nresource and subsequently receive notifications from that second resource.  Such a\nscope presumes that both systems hosting these resources can symmetrically initiate\nconnections and that both systems are secured at an appropriate level by their\nrespective administrators.  Asymmetry of connectivity is a separate issue.\n\n$0.02...?\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
