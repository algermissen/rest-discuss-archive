The kind &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess)\n&gt; defined in the media type spec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service X\n&gt; of organization Y. All you need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; and\n&gt; then you say Accept: application/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off you\n&gt; go. There is no need to talk about *that* service any further. The\n&gt; description of the service *is* in the media type. There are *no* (thatis:\n&gt; none whatsoever) service specific descriptions in RESTful systems.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise I as a developer won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if the information of a given service is of interest to me. This\n&gt; &gt; reasoning between developers (human beings) is at a conceptual level.\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore software is not only meant for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant\n&gt; &gt; for humans to read and understand and reason about.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right - but this is intent (&quot;I want to buy a book, therefore I direct my\n&gt; browser to http://amazon.de and not http://weather.info).

My point in the\n&gt; &gt; discussion was that it may be of interest to talk about the concepts\n&gt; &gt; and information a service is meant to provide in order to then be able\n&gt; &gt; to reason about what media types to use or invent for a given service.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, &#39;entities&#39; such as feeds, feed-entries, images, products, orders,\n&gt; contact-info (vcard), events (icalendar) etc. surely are part of designing\n&gt; media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say it again: the problem that is being tried to solve does not\n&gt; exist.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this your way of saying there is nothing to discuss?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes :-) The whole strict point of &#39;specific media types are a bad idea&#39; is\n&gt; simply confusing people trying to understand REST.

My understanding of the discussion was that we were\n&gt; &gt; discussing heuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media\n&gt; &gt; types.\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing is, that it is actually pretty clear that generic media types +\n&gt; embedded specific stuff + a new means for negotiating that stuff is silly\n&gt; because the mechanism for negotiation such stuff is the media type\n&gt; identifier in the first place. It is the mechanism built into HTTP for that\n&gt; purpose.\n&gt; (Not to question the usefulness of standard general link relations\n&gt; orthogonal to media types, of course)\n&gt;\n&gt; Specific media types is what one should do and there is no problem with\n&gt; them.
