It&#39;s the\n&gt; standard media types and link relations that take a while to sink in.\n&gt; \n\nYeah, because we never take the architectural-style approach around\nhere, and say things like:\n\n&quot;If your only representation of that resource is text/html, then you\ncan&#39;t DELETE that resource.  You&#39;d have to change to, or use conneg to\nadd a representation in, application/xhtml+xml, because that media type\nsupports DELETE (via Xforms) while text/html only supports GET and\nPOST.  The same goes for application/rss+xml, which only supports GET\n-- you&#39;d have to change to, or use conneg to add, application/atom+xml\nbecause that media type supports DELETE (via Atom Protocol).\n\nIf you go rogue because HTTP allows you to DELETE your negotiated text/\nhtml + application/rss+xml resource anyway, then you&#39;re violating the\nuniform interface constraint.  Not only has your DELETE not been driven\nby hypertext (a REST mismatch exists in Atom Protocol&#39;s use of DELETE\nand PUT, but not with Xforms), but its use requires out-of-band\nknowledge specific to your API that is not encompassed within the\ndefinitions of the media types you&#39;ve used.  Therefore, your interface\ncouples client to server, failing to be generic.&quot;\n\nEven if that&#39;s too abstract for a noob, at least they&#39;ll understand\nthat the correct selection amongst standard media types is a vital\naspect to confront, hopefully before designing URIs, since the chosen\nmedia types may influence URI design.\n\nMaybe you&#39;re right, but changing how REST is taught can&#39;t possibly lead\nto a worse outcome than we have now, so it&#39;s worth a try even if we&#39;re\nignoring old assumptions.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
