An Atompub server should drive interaction with\n&gt; &gt; clients using forms, to indicate to the client what data the server\n&gt; &gt; needs, and can accept.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Atom entry documents were originally designed to deliver information\n&gt; &gt; to clients. Using them to introduce information to the server raises\n\n&gt; &gt; some issues that working group has mostly resolved; but these issues\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be issues if Atom servers behaved like web servers serving\n&gt; &gt; HTML forms to humans.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Example: the group spent some cycles deciding, Who sets atom:id? Must\n&gt; &gt; the server preserve it if the client submits it? Hey -- it&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; required element... should we require clients to submit invalid\n&gt; &gt; documents? etc. etc. This wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue if the client\n&gt; &gt; first retrieved a form from the server, and the server either\n&gt; &gt; requested that information or didn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; Atom Format can assume that atom:id already exist and doesn&#39;t have to\n&gt; consider the entry lifecycle; Atom Protocol conversely has to consider\n&gt; how entries come to be and how ids are minted.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s more to this than you suggest; it&#39;s not just about issuance,\n&gt; it&#39;s also about permanency. One usecase/gedanken to chew on is migrating\n&gt; entries from one system or server to another. Another is manipulating\n&gt; atom:id+atom:updated to spam/hijack entries. Another is enabling\n&gt; multiple entries to be created (as will be the case in APP with photos\n&gt; or podcasts) in a forms based approach.\n&gt;\n\nYes... Atompub addressed the issue that only way it can. It says\nservers are free to change atom:id. It&#39;s acknowledging that there are\ndifferent kinds of servers out there. Some are designed to generate\ntheir own ids, some are designed to allow or even require the client\nto generate atom:id. And there&#39;s a corollary: clients have to submit\natom:id because they don&#39;t know whether the server is the one kind or\nthe other, do they?\n\nThe WG had to spell out that the server can change the atom:id only\nbecause it has inadvertently taken on the task of describing server\nmodels and capturing all of the possible reasonable behavior in this\nspec. It did so the minute it decided all servers would accept Atom\nentry documents. In doing so it had to describe as many exceptional\ncases as it could predict.\n\nGood on Atompub for capturing all the use cases you outlined in a\ndescription of the meaning of atom:id. Servers and clients need to\nshare that understanding of its meaning. My comments were off the mark\nin implying that that discussion was unnecessary. I should have said,\nthe spec would not have had to prescribe allow behavior around\natom:id, if the server were allowed to tell the client just what data\nit needs using a form.\n\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
