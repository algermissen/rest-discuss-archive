First, RFC2616 doesn&#39;t mention\nresponse code 404 in the context of DELETE, which your statement\nbelow implies.  Second, &quot;The 410 response is primarily intended to\nassist the task of web maintenance.&quot;  If I DELETE a resource\nsuccessfully, then I know that the resource is now unmapped with\nrespect to representations.  How does it help me further in\nthe service of web maintenance to get an indication that is was\nalready unmapped?\n\nCertainly this is different from the question of which is better,\n410 or 404, to return from a GET when the resource is unmapped.\nRFC2616 seems to be focused on specifying that, not the response\ncodes for a DELETE.  That&#39;s my reading; it&#39;s not clear in the spec.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 13, 2002 12:36 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] [fielding@...: Re: Resources always\n&gt; exist]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree with that.  I do agree that DELETE is \n&gt; invalidating the\n&gt; mapping (the mapping from representation to resource), not \n&gt; necessarily the\n&gt; resource.  However, if I were to issue a DELETE on an invalid \n&gt; identifier, I\n&gt; think it would be legitimate to return a 404.  As RFC2616 \n&gt; notes, you could\n&gt; also return 410 in this case (if the server bothered to keep track).\n&gt; Certainly 410 would be more accurate than 404, but either \n&gt; should be allowed.\n&gt; In this perspective, the server is actually talking about the \n&gt; mapping.  As\n&gt; Fielding was saying (I think), from the POV of the request, \n&gt; not finding a\n&gt; resource and not finding a mapping to a resource are just \n&gt; different ways of\n&gt; saying the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 13, 2002 9:25 AM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] [fielding@...: Re: Resources \n&gt; always exist]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So it looks like DELETE should not return 404.
