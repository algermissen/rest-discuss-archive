It would seem to me that forms are an\n&gt; important part of hypertext navig=\r\nation, and could be characterized as\n&gt; a user-input-parameterized link, at =\r\nleast with GET-based forms.\n&gt; However, I was curious if others are in agree=\r\nment on this perspective.\n&gt; If a form is a type of link, why does HTML not =\r\ndefine a &quot;rel&quot;\n&gt; attribute for forms? OpenSearch [1] also defines navigatio=\r\nn to URIs\n&gt; that are parameterized by user-supplied data, but it does inclu=\r\nde\n&gt; &quot;rel&quot; attribute. From a navigational perspective, is there any\n&gt; funda=\r\nmental difference between HTML form and OpenSearch links (other\n&gt; than that=\r\n HTML obviously prescribes more of the presentation aspect)?\n&gt; If forms can=\r\n be viewed as link mechanisms, should this only be applied\n&gt; to GET-based f=\r\norms, or can POST-driven user parametrized data also be\n&gt; considered a form=\r\n of a navigable link?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I ask, is I am trying to feel out if t=\r\nhe approach in JSON\n&gt; schema, of allowing user-parametrized data submission=\r\n [2] as an\n&gt; extension of a link definition is appropriate. With this appro=\r\nach,\n&gt; links can include additional information, extending them to take use=\r\nr\n&gt; provided data to form URIs, and specify the request method. IMO, this\n&gt;=\r\n is an elegant way of minimizing constructs while still allowing for\n&gt; URIs=\r\n to be parameterized with user input like forms, but I wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; if oth=\r\ners felt this would violate any principles of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.open=\r\nsearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1\n&gt; [2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/d=\r\nraft-zyp-json-schema-01#section-6.1.1.3\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; - --\n&gt; Kris Zyp\n&gt; S=\r\nitePen\n&gt; (503) 806-1841\n&gt; http://sitepen.com\n&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----=\r\n-\n&gt; Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\n&gt; Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - h=\r\nttp://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; iEYEARECAAYFAktgkW0ACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAwykACdHO/O=\r\nRNeFFy5g07rzy90MzPSr\n&gt; zPMAoJmmg/UQJizuvys79ULqWfKTKmlY\n&gt; =3D4uDy\n&gt; -----EN=\r\nD PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
