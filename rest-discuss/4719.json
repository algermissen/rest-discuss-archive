I don&#39;t remember what the actual\n&gt; application was -- or did anyone bother to ask or mention it? How does\n&gt; this queue thing fit into your Web site / Web application / Web service?\n&gt; Usually when I implement a queue in a Web application (say, for sending\n&gt; email reliably) the producers are the request handlers in the server\n&gt; (exposing a more interesting semantic than &quot;queue&quot; to the clients) and the\n&gt; consumer is a daemon thread also in the server, so it can do whatever\n&gt; arbitrary atomic transactions it needs to do under the covers. It seems\n&gt; more than a little silly to implement a raw queue as a RESTful Web\n&gt; service. REST, and the Web it describes, is about lots of clients talking\n&gt; to semanticful resources... A single consumer talking to a raw queue isn&#39;t\n&gt; very interesting in that context, so any solution you come up with is\n&gt; going to be awkward.\n&gt;\n&gt; Justin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
