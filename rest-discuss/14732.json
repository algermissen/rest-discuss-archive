I have been convinced by th=\r\ne idea that really the collection should not contain Account elements but s=\r\nome sort of link. The inlining idea is good in that it formalises combining=\r\n a link with some data from the target resource.... at least it would be if=\r\n the spec  had moved forward from being a draft ;-)\n\nHowever, what I&#39;m real=\r\nly pushing for is an example of publishing a feed (or even feeds) within ot=\r\nher content, for example within the seller element from my last post. If I =\r\nend up with something similar to my last post (i.e. a seller element that c=\r\nontains a feed element) I&#39;m back to a custom vocabulary... at which point I=\r\n can&#39;t see the advantage of using Atom feeds... a generic client would neve=\r\nr find the feeds in the first place (because my seller element doesn&#39;t look=\r\n anything like a Service document)... \nAny thoughts?\n\n\n\n"}}
