Otherwise, for example, how would it know what are links\nand what aren&#39;t links?\n\nIf your client is media type aware, or all of your media type follow\nsome specific conventions (such as universal use of a specific link\ntag and format, or the link headers), then a URC (Universal REST\nClient) could return a list of links in a payload, the media types\nthey may require, and perhaps, particularly in a dynamic language,\nprovide some kind of proxy object the client could use to populate the\nmetadata (basically a OOL &lt;-&gt; XML mapper). If the URC was extra robust\n(assuming the server also offered support), it could send an OPTIONS\nrequest to each link to better fill in the details of the operations\navailable at a particular link.\n\nBut, again, this depends on the actual information coming from\nservices being is some format that the URC can interpret, and this is\nwhere the &quot;universality&quot; of the client is likely to break down.\n\nGiven convetions, I think it could go a long way, but I don&#39;t think\nyou can make a truly universal client.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
