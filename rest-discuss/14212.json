One school of thought suggests coarse grained media types meaning using application/xml, text/html etc etc.  While the other promotes and shows examples of refined media types that reflect the domain in which they are being used in e.g. application/vnd.order+xml.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I see possible pros/cons to both approaches but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen an actual discussion targeted at discussing this matter (other than certain threads on other topics delving into the issue).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyone want to take the first shot at backing a certain approach publicly?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eb\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6596 ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; A key problem with using application/xml is that if everyone did that then how could you do any content negotiation between two distinct but XML-based formats?\n&gt;   \n\nPerform conneg server side using other request headers as well as \nAccept, and use the Vary mechanism in the response to describe what&#39;s \ngoing on.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
