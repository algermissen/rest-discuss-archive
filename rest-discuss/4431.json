Not just caching?\n&gt; \n&gt; So that we are not talking about GET with a request body (which \ncould \n&gt; perhaps be made cachable, e.g., using &quot;Vary&quot;) but a means of \nmapping \n&gt; an XML document (which could be just a property set for flat vs \n&gt; hierarchical addressing) into a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; E.g., a &quot;application/iriencoded-xml&quot; MIME type.\n&gt; \n&gt; -bryan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Orchard&quot; &lt;orchard@p...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been looking at how map an xml tree into the path and same \n&gt; depth\n&gt; &gt; params into the forms, ala\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&lt;Music&gt;&lt;Artist&gt;&lt;Name&gt;ThieveryCorp&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;Rating&gt;5&lt;/Rating&gt;&lt;/Artist&gt;&lt;/M\n&gt; us\n&gt; &gt; ic&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; gets mapped into something like GET /Music/Artist?\nName=ThieveryCorp \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; GET /Music/Artist/Rating?Name=ThieveryCorp\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mixed ns are a pain, but if you adopt the convention that the ns \n&gt; decls\n&gt; &gt; are somehow in the algorithm, then it gets a little bit more \n&gt; managable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@a...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 01, 2004 8:38 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: David Orchard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re-using information fields for \n&gt; queries in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Jun 01, 2004 at 05:47:54PM -0700, David Orchard wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gotcha on the use of hierarchy rather than flat where \n&gt; appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Roy T.
