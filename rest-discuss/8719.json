Certainly \n&gt; &gt; Roy&#39;s thesis is the final word on REST but it is not \n&gt; approachable for \n&gt; &gt; most, and it is definitely not a REST cookbook that explains how to \n&gt; &gt; handle various use-cases.  Further, I believe a cookbook is \n&gt; what ~99% of people need to successfully implement an\n&gt; &gt; architecture style (and I am one of these 99%.)   But the \n&gt; cookbook would\n&gt; &gt; need to be authoritative.\n&gt; \n&gt; I disagree a bit. I think we need a bunch more RESTfull \n&gt; frameworks out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hate frameworks but they&#39;re what people seem to want to use \n&gt; to write code.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n\n"}}
