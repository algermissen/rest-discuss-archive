Originally, my toolkit wasn&#39;t officially REST.\nBut as I began to read RESTwiki and lurk on this group, I realized that my\ndesign turned out to be very RESTful.  I&#39;m also working on including\nenvironmental acquisition [1], which I find complements REST *very* well.\nThey&#39;re a powerful combo.\n\nI hesitate to say much until I&#39;ve got a stable release, but I plan on announcing\navailability as soon as possible.  Then, whether we mention it on RESTwiki or\ncreate a separate wiki instance is fine with me.\n\nMy hope is that its availability will help us really see and be able to use\nsomething that&#39;s concrete and helps us refine our notion of REST.\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n[1] http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lorenz/research/acquisition/\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: bhaugen32 [mailto:bhaugen32@...]\nSent: Wednesday, June 05, 2002 10:54 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: REST toolkits\n\n\n&quot;Philip Eskelin&quot; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m developing a REST toolkit\n\nPhilip and anybody else who is developing REST toolkits please\nannounce when something becomes available for use?
