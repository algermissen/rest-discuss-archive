Costello quoted Henry Hazlitt,\n[1] http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/wisdom/\n&gt;Why have those of us who believe in human liberty been so ineffective?\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;We Haven&#39;t Been Good Enough&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am going to give what is no doubt a terribly oversimplified answer to\n&gt;that question. In the first place, we are almost hopelessly outnumbered.\n&gt;Our voices are simply drowned out in the general tumult and clamor. But\n&gt;there is another reason....collectively, we just haven&#39;t been good enough.\n\nI think REST like many other technologies, is moving in the right\ndirection.  I&#39;m an accountant, an economist really. Not a programmer.\nAs a user, I just look at software and ask, &quot;does this give me a\nnet advantage, or disadvantage?&quot;\n\nBut when non-programmers look at the entire range of verbs,\nnouns, platforms, software objects, routing, business models,\ntiers etc. there is a complete and total paralysis because\nthe permutations are so great.  Vendors of course, bundle many\ndecisions into their software product, service etc. having some\nkind of resultant force vector that usually cuts too deep into\nthe users&#39; sovereignty or advantage.\n\nI have listed some of these &quot;axes&quot; of centralization/decentralization\non my website... comments welcome, hope this is useful.\nhttp://www.gldialtone.com/P2PAxes.htm\n\nIn summary, whenever a particular technical or functional requirement\nis served most economically by centralization, a transfer of business\nadvantage (asymmetry of benefit) needs to be avoided by some means,\n\nTOdd\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
