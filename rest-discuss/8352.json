If you want to \nstay the URI route, I would have thought a query parameter was a \ncandidate for a dictionary lookup, on the basis that it seems clients \nare expected to know what to append onto the URL as the key - and query \nparams are at least explicit in terms of design.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
