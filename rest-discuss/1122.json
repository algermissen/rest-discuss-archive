It&#39;s common for customers to subscribe to the catalog and\n&gt; get periodic updates.  The catalog will have URIs for each product.\n\nSomething that I&#39;ve run into is that (product) catalogs sometimes have\npricing embedded within the catalog - which causes the catalog to be unique\nto individual receivers - vendors don&#39;t have or want uniform pricing across\ncustomers. If their process cannot &#39;normalize&#39; out this information into\nseparate pricing documents then you get a huge amount of mostly redundant\ninformation across the system as a whole. And when it gets this big - 60GB\nper week for 10K customers lets say - then vendors feel they need batch\noperations, scheduled updates, etc. leading away from a more\nreal-time/low-latency/event-driven message flow.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I expect something like &#39;Business Protocols&quot; to become available soon.\n&gt;\nI agree with you. I think they will evolve from the coalescing of pockets of\nuse, rather than from standardization organizations though.\n\n"}}
