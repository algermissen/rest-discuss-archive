Here, a GET to the Order might return a completion-uri (amongst other\n&gt; order details), and we might POST our shipping options to that URI to get\n&gt; the Order completed. But now we are updating the state of one resource (the\n&gt; Completion form) in order to set in progress a chain of side-effects that\n&gt; will include the updating of another resource (the Order itself).
