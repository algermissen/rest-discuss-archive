POST might be used \nto\n&gt; allocate out of the availability - but a business document probably \nwill\n&gt; have that information & so you&#39;d just submit it to the &#39;orders&#39; \ncollection &\n&gt; let the values be updated via business logic (meaning that the \nvalues from\n&gt; these two sample queries are &#39;synthetic&#39; properties, derived from \ndata\n&gt; manipulated via other actions)\n\nI agree.  Allocation requires a business commitment from a customer, \nusually in the form of an order.\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
