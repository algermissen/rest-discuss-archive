First &quot;uniform interface drives\n&gt; integration complexity to O(N)&quot; is too easy to be true.  It doesn&#39;t\n&gt; take into account that while there is much similarity among peer \n&gt; businesses, there is also individuality, a/k/a competitive edge, which \n&gt; mandates, to a degree, custom interfaces.  &quot;Uniform interface&quot; is like \n&gt; &quot;software process improvement&quot;.  You use it to factor away known \n&gt; redundancy, but no more. \n\nI think that this is an important point. To me, REST is about \nstandardizing what can be standardized. It doesn&#39;t take a rocket \nscientist to recognize that addressing models can and should be \nstandardized (or it might have taken a rocket scientist in the late \n1990s, but it shouldn&#39;t today).\n\nSimilarly, it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see that it is possible \nto standardize the method you use to to report or modify the state of a \nresource, or request the destruction of a resource.\n\nBut applications do not consist of those two things so there will ALWAYS \nbe effort in integrating applications. Just not necessarily in \nintegrating their addressing schemes and method names.\n\n&gt; Secondly, your position in the scheme of things determines whether you,\n&gt; personally will feel integration as O(N) or O(N^2) or something else.\n&gt; Basically, God is the only one with the N^2 problem, because it&#39;s the\n&gt; system view of the system.  An individual newcomer to a party without\n&gt; uniform interfaces causes an integration problem (for itself and all \n&gt; others\n&gt; who wish to integrate with him) with a sum total of O(N).  Over time,\n&gt; from historical (God) perspecive, you would observe the N^2 thing, but\n&gt; it&#39;s not a price paid daily.\n\nYou don&#39;t observe the whole price daily, but when the newcomer cannot \neven conceptualize their service because the integration costs are so \nmassive, the overall ecology pays the price.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
