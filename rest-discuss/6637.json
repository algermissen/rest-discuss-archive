Are you saying that by modifying a property\n&gt; of fleet1, as opposed to a member of it. I have to also create\n&gt; replacements for all of the members?\n&gt;\n\nYup. You replace the whole resource at that URI with a new one. You\nwould PUT a document representing the new version of the fleet.\n\nYou are wondering whether you can or should update the collection\nmebers just as you might update the name property. Answer: No,\nusually.\n\nTherre are two ways to represnt the fleet resource you&#39;re describing:\na bunch of properties, like &#39;name&#39;, and a collection of vehicle URIs;\nor as a bunch of properties, and a single URI referencing the\ncollection of vehicle URIs.\n\nEither way, at the application level, you would prohibit modifying the\nindividual vehicle  URIs or the collection reference URI. If the\nclient PUTs a representation that modifies the collection, the server\neither returns 4xx, or ignores that part of the request.\n\nIn your application it would just be illegal to modify the vehicles\ncollection any way other than POST on the fleet URI, or  PUT or DELETE\non the vehicle URI.\n\nSo to modify a fleet, PUT a new representation of it, but that\nrepresentation is constrained.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
