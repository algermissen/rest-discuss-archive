Notice that the header required with\nthe 401 response is WWW-Authenticate and the corresponding request\nheader is Authorization -- the terminology is inconsistent even\nwithin one mechanism. So ignore it. :)\n\n&gt; I just hate the 401 behaviour of the automatic login box. Which\n&gt; suggests that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it. Which suggests that I\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t do it.\n\nI&#39;ve noticed that browsers (at least some) will display the\ncontent of a 401 response if there&#39;s no WWW-Authenticate header,\nso sometimes I do that, though it violates the spec, and it\ndoesn&#39;t support Basic auth, just custom form/cookie auth. That&#39;s\nall ugly and non-standard but seems to work. Sometimes I do the\nsame thing using 403, though, in contradiction to what I wrote in\nthe first paragraph above.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n"}}
