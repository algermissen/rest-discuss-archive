It seems fraught with all the\n&gt;&gt; same =\r\ncontract versioning issues as WSDL, DCOM, etc. Knowledge and\n&gt;&gt; meaning are=\r\n continually evolving products of the dynamic social context\n&gt;&gt; within whic=\r\nh they exist, and that fact surely needs to be addressed in\n&gt;&gt; any workable=\r\n content binding approach...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In REST terms, concepts can obviously be=\r\n modelled as URI-addressable\n&gt;&gt; resources and published in different repres=\r\nentation formats. For\n&gt;&gt; example, the location concept &quot;London, UK&quot; can be =\r\nmodelled as a resource\n&gt;&gt; with the address http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lond=\r\non and then published\n&gt;&gt; in representation formats including RDF, N3, KML, =\r\nGeoRSS, etc. However I\n&gt;&gt; am unsure how the self-describing message and HAT=\r\nEOS constraints\n&gt;&gt; translate in this context? The best I can come up with i=\r\ns that the\n&gt;&gt; DBpedia, Freebase, OpenCyc ontologies should be viewed as the=\r\n knowledge\n&gt;&gt; representation equivalents of standard MIME types (or metamed=\r\nia types?),\n&gt;&gt; and that hypermedia should be used for runtime binding to th=\r\ne immediate\n&gt;&gt; sibling nodes of a concept within those standard ontologies =\r\n(thereby\n&gt;&gt; avoiding the versioned contract binding nightmare). Any approac=\r\nh like\n&gt;&gt; that would make me feel a lot more comfortable that just tagging =\r\nstuff\n&gt;&gt; with DBpedia URIs, which seems to violate a whole raft of basic\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n architectural principles e.g. encapsulation and separate of\n&gt;&gt; interface/i=\r\nmplementation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To my (clearly limited) mind, these seem like really i=\r\nmportant questions\n&gt;&gt; and I don&#39;t think they are receiving enough considera=\r\ntion in linked\n&gt;&gt; data/semantic web circles at present?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Julian\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;&gt; On Behalf Of Simon Reinhardt\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Sent: 03 March 2009 15:58\n&gt;&gt; Cc: Rest List\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss]=\r\n This is REST\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Solomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Craig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;re=\r\nl&quot; seems like a good start and I think\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; building on that idea c=\r\nan lead to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; compliant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; RESTful application.
