If it&#39;s not used as a\n&gt; method, then why bother trying?  Perhaps I&#39;ve just been doing this long\n&gt; enough that I never need to consider doing so.  Practice makes perfect,\n&gt; I suppose.\n\nWith the recent discussion, maybe people are so used to treating URIs as\nrepresenting only nouns that it isn&#39;t worth generalizing URIs as an\nuniversal addressing scheme for *anything*.  I just feel that we are losing\nsome potential interesting applications if we make this restriction and not\ngetting much in return.\n\nMaybe at the root of what I&#39;m trying to get at is that a method should have\na URI.  Why should objects get all the benefits of universal addressability\nand not methods?\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
