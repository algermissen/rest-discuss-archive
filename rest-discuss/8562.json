I&#39;ve always understood it to mean that an\napplication can have state (what is it doing right now? what has it\njust done?) but that you can use links and other href targets (forms\nfor example, xlinks, includes, etc...) to represent the state\ntransitions; eg:\n\n  from the invoices page you can go to:\n      customer-add page \n      or invoice-add page\n\nBut this is when you have more than just one variable.\n\nIn the example being talked about earlier there was only one variable\nthat could be in 4 states.\n\nNow, I&#39;m sure that you can do that with hypermedia if you want to but\nI&#39;m a simple bloke and I see that as just one resource. Even if it has\nmultiple states (ie: values) you can still describe it with a single\nrepresentation because you can  describe all the possible state\ntransitions (or values) in the single representation.\n\n\nI think what I&#39;m saying is what Ockham said: don&#39;t needlessly\nover complicate things (actually, it turns out he didn&#39;t say that).\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
