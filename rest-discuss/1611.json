Explicit path-based add=\r\nressing was a bad idea then in that\ncontext, it&#39;s a bad idea now in the con=\r\ntext of SOAP Routing, and it&#39;s an\nabsolutely horrendous idea to do it in th=\r\ne context of embedding this kind of\ninformation in URI.\n\nAlso note that in =\r\n*all* current successful examples of routing (at least\nthat I can think of)=\r\n there is a clear distinction between addressing and\nrouting.  It&#39;s a bad i=\r\ndea to embed routing information explicitly in names /\naddresses for all ki=\r\nnds of reasons, and a moments reflection on successful\nrouting schemes will=\r\n demonstrate that it&#39;s just not done.  In fact, this\nisn&#39;t really routing a=\r\nt all:  it&#39;s &quot;path-based addressing.&quot;\n\nArguments have been offered elsewher=\r\ne against SOAP Routing that generally\napply here as well.  The short versio=\r\nn is that path-based addressing an\nadministrative nightmare and a reliabili=\r\nty black hole.  There are perhaps a\nfew new arguments as well, re: the phil=\r\nosophy of the Web, e.g.:  what\nexactly are you naming when you write a URI =\r\nlike that?\n\nThere&#39;s no reason to truly &quot;route&quot; at *any* level (much less th=\r\ne application\nlevel) unless physical connectivity / topology demands it.  N=\r\now, a more\nabstract &quot;routing&quot; in the sense of iterative hand-offs via 3xx a=\r\nnd dynamic\nname resolution are a great idea at the application level, but t=\r\nhat&#39;s a\ndifferent beast.\n\nI&#39;m happy to drill down on this if necessary, but=\r\n I really think that can be\navoided with just a bit of thought about what t=\r\nhings would look like if this\nkind of idea was deployed.
