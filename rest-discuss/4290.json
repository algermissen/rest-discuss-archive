Return a resource which includes encrypted information about salary as well\n&gt; as unencrypted information about those details accessible by all.\n&gt; Pro:\n&gt; a. Okay to be honest I thought about this because I want an excuse to play with\n&gt; XML Encryption, but that&#39;s still a &quot;pro&quot;.\n&gt; b. Caching works - the response can be cached for as long as both the\n&gt; information and the key used for encryption are both valid.\n&gt; c. Caching is secure as even if someone gets unauthorised access to cached\n&gt; representations the sensitive data within that representation is encrypted.\n&gt; Con:\n&gt; a. The overhead of building and using the appropriate cryptographic\n&gt; infastructure.\n&gt; b. The fact that non-specialists tend to get encryption wrong. It&#39;s definitely\n&gt; something to thread lightly with.\n&gt; c. A change to the key must be considered a modification to the representation\n&gt; of the resource. It may not be easy to reflect this in Last-Modified and E-Tag\n&gt; headers.\n\nRegarding con 4c, it&#39;s even worse than that, as message encryption may \nincorporate a timestamp or some random value (at least I know it&#39;s true \nfor OpenPGP).  So every time the server encrypts a given message, the \nHTTP response entity will be different.  Anyway, you can still get by \nwith weak entity tags.\n\nI use a combination of your methods 3 and 4, which may seem odd.  It&#39;s a \nlong story, but my app requires message-unit authentication (that is, \nthe client must be able to prove that the server produced a message even \nafter the HTTP session has ended).  Since I&#39;m already signing each \nmessage, it&#39;s not much of a leap to encrypt per-message also, and so I \ndon&#39;t use session-unit authentication or encryption at all (that is, no \nSSL), which works out nice for caching.  I have a public and private \ntree, both accessible without authentication, and producing entities \nsigned by the server.  In the private tree, the entities are also \nencrypted to the owner.\n\n-John\n\n\n-- \nhttp:// if  ile.org/\n\n\n"}}
