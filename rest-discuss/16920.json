In some\nother protocol or API, POST may mean &quot;replace&quot; with &quot;create&quot; assigned to\nPUT.  The meaning assigned to methods should be a function of the media\ntype involved in the request.  REST only cares that methods aren&#39;t used\nin undefined ways (i.e. PUT meaning &quot;update&quot;), or in ways defined by\nother methods (don&#39;t use POST to GET or DELETE), because such usage is\nnot uniform.\n\nPOST can mean anything, so long as that meaning isn&#39;t already defined\nfor some other method.  I&#39;m torn as to whether Atom Protocol is correct\nin constraining PUT to only mean &quot;update&quot;, or whether it&#39;s just as wrong\nto use POST to &quot;create&quot; as to &quot;retrieve&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;, or if it matters.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But if the time exposed from my resource is server time (I don&#39;t want\n&gt; the client input time), should I use PUT or POST?\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t understand your question.  Practically, any decision between PUT\nand POST, for me, comes down to whether I want idempotency or not.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
