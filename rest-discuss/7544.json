After looking at their website I learned they allow you to\nconfigure a company or community specific toolbar at their website that will\ninstall into IE or Firefox, and then distribute to customers/community\nmembers.  They get their revenue by serving Google searches from their\ntoolbar where they get a cut of the ad revenue, but it&#39;s almost completely\nseemless to the user.\n\nTo test it I used one of their default templates for a Yahoo Group and then\ncustomized it a bit. I chose to create one for REST-discuss, and though I&#39;m\nnot normally a toolbar fan, after I was finished I was pleasently surprised\nat its usability! It allows you to:\n\n-- Search REST Discuss using Google (I could configure to also search other\nengines if anyone cares)\n-- Reference an RSS Feed of recent REST-discuss messages from the toolbar\n-- Have a chat among any REST-discuss toolbar users (currently there are\nnone, but if a lot of people used it...)\n-- Allow us to send messages to REST-discuss toolbar users\n-- There&#39;s a drop down menu with links to all major sections on the\nREST-Discuss page\n-- I added a drop down menu of links to the best articles and most important\nRFCs and W3C specs (although I might have missed some.)\n-- And a ticker I think you&#39;ll find amusing. :)  (You can turn it off if you\ndon&#39;t like it.)\n\nAgain, this thing is suprisingly devoid of anything that would smack of in\nyour face advertising. I think they&#39;ve got the web 2.0 ethos down. \n\nTry it out [2], and let me know what you think. I&#39;m definitely going to keep\nit installed on my browsers.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\nP.S. For the cynics in the audience, I don&#39;t benefit from people using this\nin any way. I didn&#39;t include any links to any of my sites and I won&#39;t get\nany affliate revenue if you use this. I just thought it was cool and useful\nfor REST-discuss community. And the company offering this, Conduit, appears\nto be legit with a lot of traffic on their forum where a lot of people\nseeming to be positive about them and their answers about their revenue\nmodel seem to jive with reality. \n\n[1] http://www.conduit.com/\n[2] http://restdiscuss.communitytoolbars.com/\n\n\n\n"}}
