I&#39;m still trying to learn about all this stuff,=\r\n but\none that stands out to me could be if the metadata is semantic or\ntech=\r\nnical?\n\nIMO, metadata to express whether content is visual, audible, or\ntex=\r\ntual seems clearly technical, right? Hence the obvious choice of\nusing diff=\r\nerent content-types like image/*, audio/*, text/*. Other\ncontent-type metad=\r\nata seems to be technical in nature as well - file\nformats, character sets,=\r\n etc.\n\nBut metadata to express *semantics* seems like a very different issu=\r\ne?\nSemantics cut across the technical differences in some areas, but are\nhi=\r\nghly specialized in others. For example, the semantics of having\nalternativ=\r\ne R-, PG-13-, PG-, and G-rated resources could apply to\nimages, audio, or t=\r\next. On the other hand, a semantic meaning of\n&quot;synonyms&quot; is particular to l=\r\nanguage-, i.e. text-, based data.\n\nSo I personally apply this to hypertext =\r\nas an engine for application\nstate by prefering to put any *semantic* metad=\r\nata that will drive\nstate transitions (hyperlinks!) into standardized conte=\r\nnt formats -\nmicroformats and semantically-aware formats; and to use as man=\r\ny\npre-existing content-types as possible. \n\nIf I do manage to come up with =\r\na genuinely new *technical* type of\ndata, I&#39;ll register a new content-type =\r\nvalue. Though I&#39;m not sure that\nwould have anything to do with state transi=\r\ntions. ;)\n\n-L\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m with Steve here. I mean, if we&#39;re trying to st=\r\nick to the specs,\n&gt; &gt; how about http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616=\r\n- \n&gt; &gt; sec3.html#sec3.7 :\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Use of non-registered media types is discour=\r\naged.&quot; ?\n&gt; \n&gt; You may be reading too much into that. Since that RFC was wri=\r\ntten, a  \n&gt; number of new types were introduced. Note that standardization =\r\nhappens  \n&gt; usually after a discovered need for interop.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think the=\r\n Obasanjo article supports the idea that OpenSocial is a\n&gt; &gt; good approach =\r\n- no coupling to specific URI schemes, and no client\n&gt; &gt; &quot;guessing&quot; either.=\r\n And it&#39;s based on using the well-standardized\n&gt; &gt; (though not IANA-registe=\r\nred?) &#39;application/xrds+xml&#39; media type,\n&gt; &gt; rather than inventing a new me=\r\ndia type.
