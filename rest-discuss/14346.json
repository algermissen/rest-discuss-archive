The basic problem, is that any REST-\nbased architectural Model has an infinite number of valid\nImplementations.  Thus there can&#39;t be such a thing as a &quot;reference\nimplementation&quot;.  The closest we come is systems built around Atom\nProtocol, and of course the GET-and-POST-based HTML Web sites, of which\nmillions are RESTful yet none are sexy enough to really help anyone\nwith the systems they&#39;re trying to implement.\n\nMy goal here, is to figure out a way (not today, by any means) we can\nall agree on to Model REST architectures.  If we can develop a REST\narchitectural Model for a shopping cart, then any number of\nimplementation ideas may be posted to the list and their mappings to\nthe model evaluated in a common lingo.  Nobody has to map the entire\nmodel, but the shortcomings of such an implementation can be agreed\nupon in terms of benefits and consequences.\n\nThe conversation around here can then change.  We can point to shopping\ncart implementations in the real world, and evaluate them against our\nModel.  We can then discuss the consequences of a failed mapping, in\nterms of the goals of the system we&#39;re evaluating (e.g. Amazon).  I may\nbe off on a wild goose chase with this, but I think (as your post so\npainfully reminds all of us) it&#39;s obvious that REST has failed on the\nWeb for anything more complex than blogging.\n\nWe need to stop discussing REST in terms of implementation, and start\ndiscussing it in terms of how well implementations map to a REST\narchitectural Model, and the benefits and consequences of the success\nor failure of such mapping to be implemented.\n\n-Eric\n\nDavid Otaguro wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;ve just not found it, but one of the biggest headaches I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen in explaining REST is the lack of a generally agreed on, well\n&gt; explained reference example demonstrating the RESTful approach for a\n&gt; reasonably complex domain and how it differs/improves on a POXy RPC\n&gt; approach.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The usual examples I&#39;ve seen are either so trivial as to be\n&gt; effectively useless, or lack a consensus validating that the approach\n&gt; really does embody the core ideals of REST.  When all the major\n&gt; published &quot;REST-ish&quot; APIs (e.g Amazon) end up with the criticism that\n&gt; they&#39;re just POXy RPC, or confuse representation with resource, it\n&gt; becomes hard to point to an example and say, &quot;If you emulate the\n&gt; thinking here, you won&#39;t be far from wrong.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I could be wrong, maybe there is something out there that\n&gt; people can point to to say, &quot;Here&#39;s REST done right for a complicated\n&gt; problem domain&quot;.  If so, and someone would do me the favor of\n&gt; pointing me to it, I&#39;d appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave.\n&gt; \n\n"}}
