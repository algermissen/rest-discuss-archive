My apologies if I&#39;ve overlooked it...\n\nAs to the issue of steady-states, consider the browser.  The user\nfollows one link, but the next steady-state may only be achieved by\ndereferencing pertinent URIs within the initial representation.  Your\npost implies that there&#39;s a 1:1 relationship between that initial\nrepresentation&#39;s retrieval and the next steady-state.\n\n-Eric\n\n&quot;algermissen1971&quot; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; When a client is in a steady state, what makes up the meaning of the\n&gt; state (what information does the client use to determine the meaning)?\n&gt; \n&gt; a) The current representation (plus the understanding of the media\n&gt; types) b) The current representation (plus the understanding of the\n&gt; media types) and the request the client made (the knowledge of the\n&gt; semantics of the resource that the representation has been obtained\n&gt; from) c) b) and knowledge about all the requests it made before (this\n&gt; is wrong from a REST POV, but I include it for completeness)\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that b) includes knowledge about any conneg that might have\n&gt; happened. E.g. the client might have asked for\n&gt; \n&gt;  GET /products/6676\n&gt;  Accept: application/xhtml\n&gt; +xml;profile=&quot;http://foo.org/my-html-product-representation-uformats-profile\n&gt; \n&gt; and the server might have just answered with\n&gt; \n&gt;  200 Ok\n&gt;  Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; knowing that it serves the requested profile. (it did not say: your\n&gt; request for HTML with tht profile is 406 Not Acceptable). From the\n&gt; pure representation it is not detectable that the server sent this as\n&gt; a response to a request for &#39;a product representation&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding is b) but I am not entirely sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
