I would put it differently.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A language is mathematically defined as something like the  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; following:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a syntax + a semantics [1].\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  A language is a grammar.  If by semantics, you mean the rules for  \n&gt;&gt; constructing valid sentences in the language (i.e. tree grammar,  \n&gt;&gt; regular grammar, etc.) then I agree, but if by semantics you mean  \n&gt;&gt; &quot;meaning,&quot; then we&#39;re heading into deep waters.  Languages don&#39;t  \n&gt;&gt; have meanings.  Constructs in a language MAY have a meaning.  So,  \n&gt;&gt; these two sets (all linguistically correct sentences and all  \n&gt;&gt; meaningful sentences)  have all different size and shouldn&#39;t be  \n&gt;&gt; mixed.\n&gt;\n&gt; No by semantics I do not meant the rules for constructing valid  \n&gt; sentences, and nor do most people. Constructing valid sentences  is  \n&gt; the domain of syntax. Just read any book on mathematical logic.  \n&gt; Syntax deals with how you combine strings to form valid sentences.  \n&gt; From &quot;Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic&quot; by Abram  \n&gt; Aronovich Stolyar (which I found on Google Books)\n\nEuh, I was just trying to figure out what you were meaning by giving  \nyou the benefit of the doubt.  I have heard worse atrocities than  \nreferring to syntactic rules as semantics, but I digress.  We are on  \nthe same page here.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; XML is original with respect to other language such as Java, JSON,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; etc, in that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - it defines a syntax, without defining the semantics,\n&gt;&gt; This is wrong, regardless of the meaning of semantics used  \n&gt;&gt; previously.  Clearly XML has a grammar (referring to the first  \n&gt;&gt; meaning of &quot;semantics&quot;; the second meaning doesn&#39;t even apply).\n&gt;\n&gt; You need to go back and look at what people mean by semantics.\n\nI still think your statement is wrong.  Said differently, why do you  \nstate that XML has no semantics and JSON does?\n\n&gt;&gt; BTW, does RDF support hypergraphs (i.e. edges that connect many  \n&gt;&gt; nodes)?  Mapping hypergraphs to graphs is a bit tedious.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have not played with hypergraphs, so I can&#39;t tell from  \n&gt; experience, though theory says it is possible. But going from what  \n&gt; wikipedia says about them, namely that &quot;While graph edges are pairs  \n&gt; of nodes, hyperedges are arbitrary sets of nodes, and can therefore  \n&gt; contain an arbitrary number of nodes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s ok. You can have names for sets. Say you call the set of  \n&gt; cats and dogs &lt;http://eg.com/cd&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; You can say\n&gt;\n&gt; :myCat a &lt;http://eg.com/cd&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; so the instanceof relation (abbreviated to a above) is a relation  \n&gt; that relates things to arbitrary graphs.\n\nCool!  At some point, I really need to start playing with RDF and  \nassimilate its properties further.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
