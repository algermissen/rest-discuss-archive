I think it does. It has no preconceived\n&gt; notion of any services per se. It just understands how handle a class of media types\n&gt; and as a long a service that is discovered delivers a media type it can understand,\n&gt; it works. Or is this different?\n\nNo, a browser doesn&#39;t do anything. All a browser does is render content.\n\nA human being discovers services by typing &quot;buy hiking boots&quot; in to\nthe Google Search Service (which has a known endpoint), and then\nfollowing links.\n\nBrowsers do nothing with services save render or downloading content.\nHumans can use the browser to consume services though.\n\nThere&#39;s this fantasy that a REST system offers the same\ndiscoverability and adaptability of the Human web to machine clients\nperforming MtoM (machine to machine) transactions. That&#39;s the conflict\nJan is dealing with.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
