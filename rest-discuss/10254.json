Instead of doing a GET \n&gt; on the resource wi=\r\nth uri http://quuxTravel.com/searched \n&gt; + the query string src=3DLondon&de=\r\nst=3DNYC\n&gt; should we do a POST to http://quuxTravel.com/searched \n&gt; with sr=\r\nc=3DLondon,dest=3DNYC on the body of the request?\n\nI&#39;m curious what you rea=\r\nd that gave you that impression.  POST is generally\nnot-preferred and only =\r\nused when the semantics of GET, PUT and DELETE don&#39;t\nwork.  GET works for t=\r\nhis use case because you are retrieving information,\nnot inserting or updat=\r\ning it on the server end.\n\nThe metaphor of search is not exactly RESTful be=\r\ncause &quot;search&quot; is a verb.\nInstead of verbs think in terms of nouns.  In you=\r\nr use case it appears that\nyou are searching for &quot;flights,&quot; so name it that=\r\n. If you want to model the\nURL based on your use-cases (which I prefer) the=\r\n URL can be viewed as a\ngeneralized search query itself so your URL might l=\r\nook like this:\n\n\thttp://quuxTravel.com/flights/london/nyc\n\nIn my example I =\r\nam creating a resource that has the state of upcoming\nflights from London t=\r\no New York City.  Of course we could also have a URL\nthat looks like this i=\r\nf need be:\n\n\thttp://quuxTravel.com/flights?src=3DLondon&dest=3DNYC\n\nYou cou=\r\nld also that latter URL to define a resource for the state of\nupcoming flig=\r\nhts from London to New York City, and if you have a lot of\noptions with no =\r\nparticular order or heirarchy you might choose that over the\n&quot;cleaner&quot; URL =\r\napproach.  Personally I prefer to use cleaner URLs whenever\npossible as I f=\r\nind them much easier to work with, but that&#39;s just a strong\npersonal prefer=\r\nence.  \n\nWhichever URL interface you choose the benefit of using GET over P=\r\nOST is\nonce you have that URL you can retrieve the state again just by past=\r\ning it\ninto a browser, displaying it as a link to be clicked on, or by emai=\r\nling it\nto a friend. You can&#39;t do that with POST.\n\nHTH.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel=\r\n\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://=\r\natlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
