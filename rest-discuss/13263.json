The proposed\n&gt; specs are describing an RPC-like system. What they are not describing\n&gt; is an architecture whereby representations of application state are\n&gt; transferred, but rather an architecture made up of procedures invoked\n&gt; upon specified URIs.\n&gt; \n\nYES!  The proposed specs are kind of RPCish. (They are at least \nconforming to the uniform interface).  The point is to jumpstart things.\n\nTo be fair....\n\nThe two transaction specifications (compensation and 2pc) were written 8 \nyears ago.  The messaging one was a simple exercise I did to create a \nfacade over an existing messaging implementation (JMS).\n\nI think there are a huge amount of improvements we can make here.  For \ninstance instead of defining URL patterns, URLs can be made more opaque \nand instead the spec defines a set of resources, link relationships, and \ninteractions with those relationships.\n\nFor messaging JMS is a *VERY* session oriented model.  The key piece to \nextract from this exercise is that HTTP messages are being exchanged \nrather than an envelope format.  To improve things, Atom can be borrowed \nfrom (at least the interactions not the envelope format).  restms.org \nhas also done some interesting stuff.  I and others doing messaging at \nRed Hat have a few other ideas as well.\n\nFor security, I think many things are well defined (authentication comes \nto mind).  I think OAuth has huge potential to manage authentication \nwhen you are running a Queue, Topic, Transaction Management, Workflow \nwhen you&#39;re dealing with Service as a Service (SaaS) (think Amazon SQS). \n  multipart/encrypted and signed could be used for multipoint messaging. \n  The question becomes, how do you integrate all these existing security \nmechanisms with the services REST-*.org want to define?\n\n\nFinally, a few years ago I started off very skeptical against REST.  A \nfriend and former mentor of mine, Steve Vinoski took the time over weeks \nto convince me otherwise.  Through the process I kept an open mind and \nbecame convinced REST was good direction for distributed computing.  I \nthink I&#39;ve kept an open mind while discussing things on this list.\n\nI hope many of you can keep an open mind with what we&#39;re trying to do.\n\nBill\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
