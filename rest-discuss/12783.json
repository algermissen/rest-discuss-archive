That does nothing but obscure \n&gt; its role as the driving force in RESTful applications.\n\n*hypertext engine*, or if we want to generalize it a little more, \n**hipermedia engine* *. As I said earlier, it&#39;s a mistake (in my point \nof view, of course) to talk about *hipermedia* here dissociating it of \nthe word *engine*. We should refer to it not as &quot;hipermedia engine&quot; but \nas &quot;hipermedia&nbsp;engine&quot; :)\n\nTo all those alternatives the same thing that Fielding said about \n&quot;connectedness&quot; can be applied.\n\n\n\nNick Gall wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 5:56 AM, Jim Webber &lt;jim@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jim%40webber.name&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Nick,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My main point is that the concept that &quot;Hypermedia Describes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Protocols&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an illuminating variation on HATEOAS -- at least for two of us (Jim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Webber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and me).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I should say at this point (as Seb has) that my &quot;HATEOAS Describes\n&gt; &gt; Protocols&quot; mantra was deeply influenced by Ian Robinson&#39;s &quot;Good Web\n&gt; &gt; formats expose hypermedia controls&quot; theme.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;HATEOS Describes Protocols&quot; not &quot;Hypermedia Describes Protocols&quot;. Why\n&gt; the switch? Freudian Slip? The former seems redundant and doubly\n&gt; obscure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking forward to the book.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
