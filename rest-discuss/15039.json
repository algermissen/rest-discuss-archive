Server evolvability is not negatively impacted by URI permanence. You do not degrade the freedom of the service owner to change the service by mandating cool URIs. All the server needs to do is to maintain the URIs (even if they return 301 or 410) and maintain the semantics of the resource they identify.\n\nIn fact, I think that those two things are the only elements of a Web application that a server *can* reasonably guarantee to keep stable and their stability allows the clients to maintain &#39;handles&#39; (Bookmarks or &#39;open browser windows) to certain application states. This allows the client to efficiently jump back and forth between states to follow certain transitions. Freshness information and change notifications (303 See Other) allow the server to inform the client when it should refresh its views of these application states.\n\nAs a side note: it is a misconception about REST that a client can only use the current steady state to choose transitions. It can also go back in its own history to find certain transitions it is looking for. Likewise, it is perfectly fine to look at several steady states simultaneously to work towards some desired goal.\n\n\nJan\n\n"}}
