I was just having a conversation with my\n&gt; coworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\n&gt; having to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\n&gt; sessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to their\n&gt; friends. Now their friends would jump into their session and potentially\n&gt; be able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click shopping) and\n&gt; cause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n&gt; \n\nYes. It&#39;s called HTTP authentication. Anything involving personal, \nprivate data should require a username password combo to access. \nPresumably if someone e-mails their URL and username and password to a \nfriend, they know what they&#39;re doing.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
