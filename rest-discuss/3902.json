I have to admit that i don&#39;t really\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; under=\r\nstand. You have to define a format that is suitable for any\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; kind of=\r\n application. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; help th=\r\ne representation to be self descriptive, but you still have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to defi=\r\nne (ou refine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looks lik=\r\ne wsdl (as Bill? said).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; See my comments on taking HTTP seriousl=\r\ny in the other thread.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I=\r\n am saying that is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; enough to  define your entire application from the=\r\n client&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns an index in =\r\nresponse to a GET without an Accept\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; header, the resource is an index =\r\nand NOT a container.  That means the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of POST  should be wit=\r\nh respect to that index and not a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; container.  In other words, if the =\r\nresource IS an index, then POST\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means add an entry to the index and N=\r\nOT add a message to a container;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; messages must be stored somewhere el=\r\nse a la DJ Bernstein.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns a container in resp=\r\nonse to a GET without an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Accept header, the resource is a container a=\r\nnd not an index.  That\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means the semantics of POST should be with res=\r\npect to the container\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not an index.  In other words, if the resou=\r\nrce is a container,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; then POST means add a  message to the container a=\r\nnd can at your\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; option affect an index. Messages  are stored in the co=\r\nntainer  a la\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SMTP.
