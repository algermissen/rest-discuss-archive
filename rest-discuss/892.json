My info is a bit dated, but IIRC\n&gt; (from proxy work circa &#39;94-&#39;95) it used to be considered bad form for various\n&gt; reasons for proxy caches to cache &quot;objects&quot; (representations of resources)\n&gt; identified with URI that had query strings.  \n\nYes, it was bad form for HTTP 1.0, but not HTTP 1.1:\n\n&quot;We note one exception to this rule: since some applications have\ntraditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a\n&quot;?&quot; in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side\neffects, caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless\nthe server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically means\nthat responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT be taken\nfrom a cache&quot;\n\n&gt; ... Maybe this isn&#39;t the case anymore;\n&gt; indeed, if the entire piece is considered as an opaque whole, on further\n&gt; consideration I&#39;m not sure why this would be problematic.  OTOH, its a bit\n&gt; semantically muddled;  does the query string identify the resource or not?  I.e.,\n&gt; do the following refer to the same _resource_ or not?\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://foo.com/some/resource\n&gt;     http://foo.com/some/resource?p1=foo&p2=bar\n\nNo. I have seen nothing to indicate that they refer to the same\nresource. URIs address unique identifiers unless some spec says\notherwise. HTTP doesn&#39;t say anything that would indicate to me that\nthose are the same resource:\n\n * http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.2\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
