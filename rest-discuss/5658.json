I would submit that this approach is as \nrestful as the first option given above, assuming that such a collection \nexists or can be created. Another variation, dependent on the \ncontainment model of the application in question, would be to use \nresource bindings in the user collection that is to be deleted so as to \nprevent the deletion of the actual resources themselves.\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\n"}}
