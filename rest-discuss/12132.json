The goal is to allow all of our\n&gt; customers to access our api so they can get information regarding\n&gt; their account/transactions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Creating the resources seem fairly straight forward. For example, each\n&gt; customer can access a list of their transactions via a URL such as:\n&gt; http://webapi.ourdomain.com/customer/123/transactions\n&gt;\n&gt; The question I have is how to I secure the application such that\n&gt; customer 123 only has access to /customer/123/* ??\n&gt;\n&gt; I am developing the application using the RESTEasy framework running\n&gt; in Tomcat. I am familiar with basic servlet authentication. However,\n&gt; we are likely to have more and more customers and do not want to\n&gt; modify the web.xml and redeploy for every new customer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there an approach to configuring multiple client authentication\n&gt; without having to redeploy each time?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jeff\nYou are likely to get the best help by asking this question on the\nRESTeasy user mailing list or forum, where everyone involved will be\nmore likely to be familiar with that particular technology.  I can\ntell you how to do it with Jersey (Java) or Rails (Ruby), but not that\nparticular framework :-).\n\nCraig McClanahan\n\n"}}
