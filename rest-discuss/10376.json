On the other hand, if you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; running on a manager server, Rails and J2EE have a lot more\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; capabilities than PHP.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I would be curious to know what the &quot;lot more capabilities&quot; are\n&gt; &gt;  that Rails and J2EE have over PHP. While I would agree that in many\n&gt; &gt;  circumstances Rails or J2EE might be a better choice, the whole idea of\n&gt; &gt;  REST (as oppossed to, say, WS-*) is that there are a small, well-defined\n&gt; &gt;  set of &quot;capabilites&quot; required to share in the full richness of what the\n&gt; &gt;  web has to offer. I have seen on more than one occassion a J2EE project\n&gt; &gt;  fail due to development overhead (design complexity, over-engineering,\n&gt; &gt;  etc.) only to have a well-thought-out PHP application save the day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me pick three (*), in no particular order:\n&gt; \n&gt; - If you choose GUI, Java has better tooling support for management,\n&gt; debugging, troubleshooting, monitoring, etc.  PHP and Ruby do not come\n&gt; close.  If you choose the command line, Ruby is the better contender.\n&gt; PHP ... what command line tools?\n&gt; \n&gt; (I&#39;m only referring here to tools that benefit from using the same\n&gt; language as the application, e.g. database migration in Rails).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Love them or hate them, some of us do need to use SOAP services on\n&gt; the back-end.  Java/.Net at a league ahead of Ruby/PHP.  But if you&#39;re\n&gt; using SalesForce or Amazon Web Services, Ruby has some amazing\n&gt; libraries to choose from.\n&gt; \n&gt; - If you have to mix languages, Ruby and Python play nicely with Java\n&gt; and .Net.  No such luck with PHP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assaf\n&gt; \n&gt; (*) The hardest part is not finding them, but editing to just three.\n&gt; \n\nAll true, but my point is that you don&#39;t automatically benefit from\nthose capabilities simply by choosing Java or Ruby if you do not not\nneed them -- and in many cases you won&#39;t. There&#39;s a significant overhead\nthat comes with Java development (and I could recount a number of\nfailures stemming from a perception that Java was simply &quot;better&quot;\nsomehow, when if fact PHP turned out to be the much more practical, and\nultimately successful, choice).\n\nRuby is another matter. I don&#39;t feel like deployment is completely\nsettled yet. If/when it is and deployment &quot;best practices&quot; are well\nunderstood and well established, I do think it&#39;s benefits over PHP would\nbe salient.  But it&#39;s not the case just yet.\n\t   \n--peter keane\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I am not the world&#39;s hugest fan of PHP -- I prefer Perl myself and am\n&gt; &gt;  constantly amazed at the community surrounding Python (though I have\n&gt; &gt;  not yet had the pleasure of deploying a Python web application). I just\n&gt; &gt;  think that discussions of &quot;what&#39;s the best programming language for\n&gt; &gt;  web application development&quot; are quite often asking the wrong questions.\n&gt; &gt;  When debates about batch capabilities in the AtomPub discussions came\n&gt; &gt;  up, I was charmed by a Roy Fielding post where he mentioned that he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt;  likely reach for &quot;a shell script and curl&quot; when faced with the task of\n&gt; &gt;  posting 10,000 entries. It just got me thinking -- the language, to a\n&gt; &gt;  large extent, just doesn&#39;t matter. Do what&#39;s simple & practical.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  --peter keane\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  [0] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/os-php-flexobj/\n&gt; &gt;  [1] http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg01117.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I wouldn&#39;t say one is more Web than the other.  And I wouldn&#39;t say\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; shared hosting is a better model for the Web.
