Bowman wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;See, that&#39;s the part that seems weird to me: how can you delete\n&gt;  &gt;something that doesn&#39;t exist? Maybe it would help if you explained (or\n&gt;  &gt;refreshed my memory) what the distinction is.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A resource can map to the empty set, which allows references to be made\n&gt; to a concept before any realization of that concept exists...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Resources never exist, they&#39;re a conceptual mapping. Even undefined\n&gt; resources have representations -- a 404 error is a representation of\n&gt; the state of the identified resource as being undefined. IOW, I am\n\nNope. 404 means no representation is available.\n\n&gt; disavowing my previous statement that a 404 and a 410 represent the\n&gt; same resource state. They do not. An undefined resource still has\n&gt; state when it&#39;s dereferenced, otherwise no 404 representation could\n&gt; be returned for bogus requests.\n\nPlease define &quot;undefined resource&quot;.\n\n&gt; &quot;Depending on the message control data, a given representation may\n&gt; indicate the current state of the requested resource, the desired state\n&gt; for the requested resource, or the value of some other resource, such\n&gt; as a representation of the input data within a client&#39;s query form, or a\n&gt; representation of some error condition for a response.&quot; (REST)\n&gt; \n&gt; So a 404 response to a GET request indicates that the state of the\n&gt; identified resource is &quot;not known to exist&quot;, while a 410 response\n&gt; indicates the state of the resource is &quot;known to have existed&quot;. I am\n&gt; using an HTTP DELETE request to change the state of the resource from\n&gt; &quot;exists&quot; to &quot;known to have existed&quot; by manipulating a representation\n&gt; of the defined resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; To change the state of the resource from &quot;known to have existed&quot; to\n&gt; &quot;not known to exist&quot; I send a DELETE requesting the server remove all\n&gt; recollection of the resource having once existed -- the semantics in\n&gt; both cases are &quot;remove&quot;. The status code of the response to\n&gt; subsequent GET requests, i.e. the representation of resource state,\n&gt; has changed through my manipulation of a representation of the now-\n&gt; undefined resource through a generic REST interface.\n\nSorry, I think you&#39;re reading things into RFC2616 which just aren&#39;t \nthere. 410 is a special case of 404, &quot;not found&quot;. That&#39;s all.\n\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m also not sure the codes are right, the more I look at them.\n&gt;  &gt;Doesn&#39;t 410 imply that the resource once existed, where 404 is more\n&gt;  &gt;vague? If so, then wouldn&#39;t 410 mean &quot;It was definitely here, but all\n&gt;  &gt;I find now is a zero-byte file&quot; where 404 would mean &quot;I can&#39;t find any\n&gt;  &gt;trace now, or at least none I&#39;m willing to admit to the likes of you&quot;?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The 410 response after one DELETE on my server indicates that the\n&gt; resource &quot;used to exist&quot;, not that the file is zero bytes -- that\n&gt; information is opaque to the client. The zero-byte thing is just my\n\n404 is different from 200 + empty body, just like an empty file is \ndifferent from an absent file.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nAt this point I&#39;m really confused about the whole point of this \ndiscussion. Are you proposing this as a general solution? To what problem?\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
