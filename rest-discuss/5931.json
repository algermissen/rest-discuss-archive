If so, then  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; server can remembe=\r\nr whether that URI had been posted to before.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s it. The reason to =\r\nhave the POE header is to let the client\n&gt; interpret the 2xx and 405 respon=\r\nses. But what&#39;s really nice about this\n&gt; ID is that it degrades gracefully =\r\n- a POE unaware client can function\n&gt; with a POE aware server and the exact=\r\nly once semantics can still be\n&gt; obtained.\n&gt;\nThat makes sense. The /12345 i=\r\ns like a deja vu token in a way, but  \nembedded in the post URL instead of =\r\nbeing put in a post parameter  \n(such as from a hidden form field), as far =\r\nas I can see. For users  \nposting forms from web pages, I think it has the =\r\nsame issue of if  \nthey back up and actually change the submission, and pos=\r\nt again, the  \nserver won&#39;t let them. In that case it is not really a dupli=\r\ncate  \npost, even though the deja vu token is still /12345, because the dat=\r\na  \nis different. I think this is a common use case. When I search for  \nfl=\r\nights at united.com, for example, I like to back up from one  \nresult, modi=\r\nfy the form, and resubmit, to get a new result. It saves  \nme time by not h=\r\naving to enter everything into a blank form, but just  \nchange the previous=\r\nly used one. Oh, I guess what I&#39;d do there is just  \nnot make that post URL=\r\n a POE one. I would just use POEs for posts  \nlike credit card charges that=\r\n really need to be idempotent.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s Mark&#39;s draft, but I wouldn&#39;t mind se=\r\neing a future rev incorporate\n&gt; 410 to emulate ttl. That way the server can=\r\n release resources in  \n&gt; due course.\n&gt;\nWhat do you mean by &quot;incorporate 41=\r\n0 to emulate ttl?&quot;\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer=\r\n\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
