My idea is to create a resource\n &gt; like /newEvent. Now the client sends a GET request to this method and\n &gt; the server answers only when there is a new event. As long as there are\n &gt; no new events the connection stays open and the client waits until it\n &gt; gets a response or is terminated (timeouts are configured as needed).\n &gt;\n &gt; I can&#39;t decide if this is RESTful and doesn&#39;t violate HTTPs GET\n &gt; semantics. RFC 2616 says the server can reply to a GET request by doing\n &gt; some processing operation first. But I don&#39;t think this was meant in a\n &gt; way that it waits just indefinitely and sends the response at some\n &gt; random point in time. But I&#39;m not quite sure about that.\n &gt; :\n &gt; Any comments on the RESTfulness of the first idea? Any better ideas?\n &gt;\nHere&#39;s an old thread I started on this very subject back in 2002:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3052 \n&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3052&gt;\n\nIt was at the exact time Roy joined the list, but he didn&#39;t answer\nhimself. =0(\n\nCheers!\n\nDuncan Cragg\n\n"}}
