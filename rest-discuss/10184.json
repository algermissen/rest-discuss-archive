Eric Bowman & Erik Hetzner \n&gt; are two different people (we have, I believe, had discussions \n&gt; in the past, which would be worrying if we were the same person).\n\nHeh. I guess that would be rather uncomfortable; a modern day Sybil!\n\nBut, apologies to you too. :)\n\n&gt; &gt; If you only serve XML you are being more conservative than \n&gt; if you also \n&gt; &gt; serve JSON and HTML+Microformats you&#39;ve disempowered those who can \n&gt; &gt; consume the latter two but have difficulty consuming the former, \n&gt; &gt; especially those such as myself you now admitted just don&#39;t &quot;get&quot;\n&gt; &gt; XSLT (and I know I&#39;m in the minority if you could all possible \n&gt; &gt; consumers of data.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought that Postel&#39;s theorem stated that you should be \n&gt; conservative in what you produce? Are you saying that we \n&gt; should be liberal in what we consume AND what we produce? \n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t those data consumers be more liberal in what they \n&gt; consume, viz., liberally consume XML?\n\nWell, you caught me there that yes Postel&#39;s Law doesn&#39;t directly apply as I\nstated it. I realized that after I emailed and thought, Duh!   So I wasn&#39;t\ntrying to be disingenous.\n\nBTW, I was using liberal in two different contexts which, admittedly, was\nconfusing. Postel&#39;s law refers to being liberal regarding format and\nstrictness of input and conservative in format and strictness of output.  As\nI was suggesting one be liberal in the number of offerings but where each\noffering was conservative in it&#39;s format and strictness of output. This\nwould be much like a world-class multi-lingual orator who might be able to\nunderstand people who speak their language poorly but they themselves would\nspeak eloquently in all languages in which they were trained.\n\nStill, the fact Postel&#39;s Law doesn&#39;t apply here doesn&#39;t IMO invalidate the\nvalue of providing multiple formats because multiple formats can address a\nbroader audience. You can see this in the days before YouTube when people\nhad to publish in .mov, .wmv, .rm and more to reach a full audience for\ntheir videos.  Similar is true if you only publish XML vs, just publishing\nJSON.  Better to have both, or even more.\n\nFYI, Flash video actually changed the game and can&#39;t be compared to the\nother video formats.  For data, and an equivalent would be if a universal\ndata translator middleware became ubiquitiously installed on browsers,\nservers, and routers the over the fast majority of the web which isn&#39;t\nlikely to happen but is an interesting concept to consider...\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\nP.S. Actually RSSBus (www.rssbus.com) wants to be that universal middleware\nbut sadly given its commercial software with no open-source I don&#39;t think\nit&#39;s likely to achieve that status (full disclosure; the person that runs\nthat business is a personal friend of mine, but he doesn&#39;t believe in\nopen-source like I do.)\n\n\n"}}
