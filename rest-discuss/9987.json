Heintz &lt;jheintz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; Please help me explain this stuff better, or just correct what I&#39;ve written.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my blog I called [1] JJ Dubray out for claiming that REST &quot;cannot\n&gt; efficiently deal with the state changes (content and lifecycle) of a\n&gt; resource&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; In later comments and further posting by JJ the real issue is:\n&gt;  &quot;what must be shared between a provider and consumer&quot;\n\nSo once again, like clock-work my e-mail client decided to reply but\nnot to the list, and I ended up in a private conversation about this\nwith John.  Too long to summarize the entire thread, but here&#39;s the\ngist of the point I&#39;m trying to make.\n\nWe know the stuff JJD is talking about works for SOAP with various\nlevels of success, call if 1st generation Web services if you will,\nnow how do we move forward and apply it to REST?  And I&#39;m talking\nabout REST with benefits, not RPC over HTTP, so obviously things will\ntranslate differently, you&#39;ll end up designing processes in a\ndifferent way to take advantage of REST characteristics.  But what\nwould it look like?\n\nThe key problem here is composition.\n\nThe simplest use case I could come up with is this.\n\nWe have a workflow and a task manager.  The workflow pushes tasks to\nthe task manager, people use the task manager to manage and perform\nthese tasks, and the outcomes are fed back to the workflow.\n\nThe task manager is a resource, so is every task created there, so you\ncan imagine using POST to create tasks, PUT to update them, ETags for\ncaching and conflict resolution, and all other good things.\n\nThe workflow also has a resource, an outcome, that the task manager\nupdates when the task completes, or deletes if the task is cancelled.\n\nSo they&#39;re acting as P2P, and I&#39;m picking this as a typical scenario\nindicative of more complex composition problems we&#39;re seeing out\nthere, but simple enough to wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have two teams.  Team red is working on the workflow, which does a\nlot of other things, not interesting for this discussion.  Team blue\nis working on the task manager.  We&#39;re digging a tunnel from both\nsides planning to meet in the middle and open it up for traffic.\n\nWhat is the minimum shared understanding that both teams need to make\nit happen?\n\nIf I&#39;m using tools to help with the design, build test case scenarios,\nchange management in future versions, what artifacts would I need?\n\nAnd what would make the end result compelling over WS-* and beneficial\nin its usage of REST?\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Some &quot;shared understanding&quot; is required for a machine consumer to\n&gt; consume and especially trigger state changing actions (through PUT or\n&gt; POST) of a Resource. The example that JJ presented is a service that\n&gt; manages Job Applications and the various states a job app goes through\n&gt; are triggered by remote consumers.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my most recent post [2] I tried to explain this &quot;shared\n&gt; understanding&quot; as being in a Representation:\n&gt; * conforming to one or more shared schemas\n&gt; * be extensible\n&gt; * can&#39;t pre-define URIs\n&gt; * can&#39;t pre-constrain state transition paths (resource state\n&gt; transitions, not client)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm, I think the essential questions are:\n&gt; 1) What is the smallest (most constrained) shared understanding possible?\n&gt; 2) In what ways is that different from WSDL/WADL?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any help!!!\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2007/11/just-in-rest-cant-handle-state.html\n&gt; [2] http://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2007/12/shared-understanding-andor-evolvability.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; John D.
