All these sorts of things are easy to cover with RPC, or\n&gt; OO-type \n&gt; predicates, where you can make up verbs at will.  Is REST just not \n&gt; suited to these sorts of situations? \n\nSufficiently suited, but maybe not optimal.\n\n\nThe domain of the the HTTP verbs is hypermedia resources, not robots.\nThere may be a different set of verbs that can more specifically apply\nto robot-resources, and you could have a RESTful robot-control\nprotocol...\n\nGET [rcp://robot01]/brain/short-term-memory/summary\nMOVE [rcp://...]/arm  from_here  to_here\nLISTEN /sensor/ears  pattern_to_listen_for  thing_to_happen_when_heard\nADD_GOAL [...] kill all_humans\n\n[For a more tractable example, maybe look to WebDAV, but include the \ncriticisms of what did and didn&#39;t need to be novel operations there.]\n\n\nThere is value in the combination of\ngeneric-operations-on-generic-resources with the\northogonal-to-many-problem-domains combination of media types\n({ht,x}ml,image/*,...).  Specifically, in the value of the client\nsoftware.  I think that&#39;s an under-stated point of REST; we sum it up,\nin part, as &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;, but even\nthat&#39;s short-shrift.  Part of the reason that we can give examples like\n&quot;searching the entire web&quot; and &quot;buying an airline ticket&quot; side-by-side\nis that HTML (and HTTP) says nothing in particular about these domains.\nIt&#39;s not the &#39;airline selection and seating markup language&#39; (ASS-ML),\nit&#39;s HTML.  It&#39;s not inktomi search specification (ISS), altavista\nsearch format (ASF) and google search forms language (GSFL), it&#39;s simply\nlayered on top of HTML forms.\n\nSo, if you do make another less-generic protocol -- in either operations\n+resources and/or media-types -- you both win and lose.  You win some\nefficiency on the operations and representations, and lose on wide\napplicability and the cost of both special-purpose clients and\ninfrastructure.  These costs can be quite high, sometimes --- how long\ndid it take to get first-order RSS support in ffox and IE?  Does lynx\nknow about Atom or WebDAV?\n\n\nLet&#39;s re-cast the RCP examples above in HTTP...\n\nGET [http://robot01]/brain/short-term-memory/summary\nPOST [...]/arm operation=move&from=here&to=there\nPOST /sensors/ears listen_to=pattern&then_occurs=...\nPOST /goal &lt;kill target=&quot;/humans?q=*&quot; /&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s not much different in the overall nature of the protocol, though\nhere the individual operations are already known to the generic client.\nThe semantics must be moved from the operations to the data.  Either:\n\n- the client application understands the media type in particular: &quot;if I\nsee a &lt;sensor class=&#39;ear&#39;&gt; in application/x-robot, then I know it is\nallowable to POST a listen-to-pattern ...&quot;\n\n- the semantics are expressed using an existing shared generic media\ntype (e.g, &quot;all I know is that I can POST something that has a first\npart named operation, with a particular value of &quot;listen-to-pattern&quot;,\nand a second part named &quot;foo&quot; with allowable values from the set of\noptinos ...&quot;).  Here, the client app itself relies on *its* user to\nfigure out what&#39;s really going on; the client is more of a user-agent.\n\n\nThis latter one is what we think when we think of the wonder of the web,\nbut the former is what people want from machine/machine applications.\nRecognizing the distiction will lead to more specific clients that still\nget some of the useful properties of web services but are reasonable to\nwork with. :)  E.g., you can still hard-code your app to know about a\nparticular &quot;Mumblr 2.0&quot; API, but... if you GET the form-description\nbefore you blindly POST the data, you might just find out that the\nserver wants you to POST somewhere else today, or there&#39;s a\nversion/form-schema change, or the same form element has changed, or 503\n(service unavailable, try again in 30 minutes), or.... [Note that most\nof those are valid responses to a &quot;blind&quot; POST, as well.]\n\n-- \n...jsled\nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
