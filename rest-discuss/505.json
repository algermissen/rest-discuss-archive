POST most of the time, PUT occasionally,\nmaybe NOTIFY if they want to be very explicit...\n\nI added a variants of your ideas on Expiration and Subscription\ncancellation.\n\nIt occurs to me now that there is nothing to prevent man-in-the-middle\nattacks (&quot;Here&#39;s your stock price Mr. Gates!&quot;) but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s\nour responsibility. They can use signing and SSL.\n\nI&#39;ve borrowed Lucas&#39; philosophy on the idempotency of notifications.\n(see the spec)\n\nSomebody needs to think through the SMTP and the Query param bindings.\n\nI&#39;ve clarified my thoughts on how to handle notifications for\ncollections. Collections are just documents that happen to contain URIs\nto other documents. Just hang a WATCH on that document.\n\nI&#39;ve also clarified my thoughts on message bodies. A notification&#39;s only\nresponsibility is to report that something changed. It is totally about\ntemporality. It&#39;s the secret spy-code where the phone rings twice with\nno message. \n\nThe message body is ONLY a HINT about what changed. It isn&#39;t the\n&quot;payload&quot; in any sense. If it is important (e.g. a msg in a chat\nsession) then it should be a first class resource on the SERVER so that\ndisconnected clients can &quot;get caught up&quot; even if they missed one or all\nof the messages. I hate using services where you have to ask people\n&quot;what did I miss while my connection was down.&quot; I think that&#39;s totally\nagainst REST. On the other hand, there are important optimizations you\ncan do if you allow message bodies so it is allowed only as an\noptimization.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
