The reason this question\n&gt; came up was that applications might be trying to GET a /items/1234 to\n&gt; check if a session resource is still available with 404 for not\n&gt; created, 410 for lost/timed-out, or 200 if it&#39;s still there. If a 410\n&gt; is given, they could POST to the same URL again to put it back (200).\n\nUse POST for resource creation through http://example.com/items that you\nexpect to return a new url as determined by the server. Use PUT for\nresource creation to http://example.com/items/1234 where you expect the\nserver to honour the client-provided url and create the resource\nin-place. See rfc2616. POST to a factory resource such as\nhttp://example.com/items is often preferred because it allows the server\ngreater freedom to shuffle you off somewhere else based on it&#39;s current\nworld view.\n\n&gt; I guess a POST is ok for 410 but not for 404 in this case. Hmm, maybe\n&gt; I should try to avoid that, and just allow another POST to the /items\n&gt; URL and use the session hash (1234) as a parameter to override the\n&gt; creation of a new and instead use the one I know about. Thoughts?\n\nI think you are talking about renewing session state...\n&lt;shrug&gt; I personally would think about doing this as a side-effect of\nthe GET request. GET is a safe method, meaning the server can&#39;t swear in\ncourt later that the client actually wanted to renew their session, but\nthe server is free to revoke the session at any time if it wants to\nanyway. It is just noticing that the session is still in use and making\nan internal decision to keep it active.\n\nOn the other hand, you should perhaps be thinking about what this\nsession is for. REST tends to discourage sessions in general. Without\nlooking at your specific use case I wouldn&#39;t like to comment too\nharshly, but a session can often be avoided.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n\n"}}
