According to (1), a typical test\n&gt; &gt; Apache server can handle ~250 requests per second.\n&gt; &gt; Assuming your clients poll once per second, you\n&gt; &gt; max out at 250 simulatenous clients.  That sucks!\n&gt; [..]\n&gt; &gt; (1) http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/benchmarks.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Err, that&#39;s hits per second, not concurrent connections. You&#39;re using\n&gt; a benchmark of Apache by an Apache competitor as an indication of how\n&gt; all Web servers perform in general? Tsk. It&#39;s widely acknowledged\n&gt; that Apache is performance-limited, in a trade-off for stability,\n&gt; developability, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me be more explicit: I know of at least two vendors who have HTTP\n&gt; implementations that can handle 50,000+ concurrent persistent\n&gt; connections on commodity hardware.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s much more instructive to look at intermediary implementations\n&gt; when you&#39;re talking about the performance overhead of HTTP; they&#39;re\n&gt; more optimised for performance, and they&#39;re not doing anything with\n&gt; the payload; it&#39;s all just overhead. It&#39;s relatively easy to achieve\n&gt; 1000+ reqs/sec [1]. Most modern HTTP intermediaries can approach or\n&gt; exceed wire speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d note that these numbers don&#39;t include any of the larger\n&gt; commercial vendors (with more developed implementations) who\n&gt; participated in past years, but now don&#39;t want their numbers made\n&gt; public, as it starts a performance war...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.measurement-factory.com/results/public/cacheoff/N04/raw.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Nottingham\n&gt; http://www.mnot.net/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
