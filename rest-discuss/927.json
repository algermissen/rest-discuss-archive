Moreover, we argue that in addition to this, even when\nthis authoritative information is available, it should not map to\na specific relative URI structure, but instead each resource should\nbe classified as the expected type independant of its name, and\nas part of the same aforementioned authoritative information.\n\nJeff appears to agree with the first part, per his response to me\nabout signifying the &quot;implementation&quot; of a relative URI structure\nby exposing that as a &quot;feature&quot; URI.  But he disagrees with the\nsecond part.\n\nIs that a fair characterization?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
