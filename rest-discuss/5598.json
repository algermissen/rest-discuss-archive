It sounds intriguing, but I don&#39;t see a lot of\n&gt;&gt; examples out there.  I&#39;m wondering how best to handle sessions.  For\n&gt;&gt; example, a user logs in via a login page, then works within the context\n&gt;&gt; of that session, then logs out (or times out).  Could someone give an\n&gt;&gt; example what HTTP requests would be involved?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Hard REST approach would be to use HTTP authentication *only*.\n\nBut HTTP authentication is quite limited.  It requires 1 username and 1 \npassword.  Suppose I need just one piece of information, or three?  \nWhere do I put the &quot;I forgot my password&quot; button?  I have no control \nover the user interface.  Imagine we are doing an e-commerce or banking \napp here.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I suppose the session ID would become part of the URL.  Couldn&#39;t that\n&gt;&gt; create a security risk?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That would be a major REST violation, because it makes URLs not \n&gt; shareable or bookmarkable.\n\nOK.\n\n&gt;&gt; Would you embed the session ID as a hidden field in the login page, so\n&gt;&gt; that it would get submitted when the user logs in?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Use a cookie.  That&#39;s the backdoor to session state in a RESTful \n&gt; design.  (Though that is sometimes felt to violate REST).\n\nIn fact, Fielding seems to think that cookies cause problems with the \nBack button.  I don&#39;t see that at all.  It seems to me that cookies \nshould work fine.\n\nThe only problem with a cookie is, you can&#39;t open different sessions in \ndifferent tabs on your browser.  Not that most people want to do that.  \nBut you could do it if SessionIDs were in the URL.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
