My application does not conform to principles of REST at this\n&gt; ti me but I want to know how to do this in a secure REST way so that\n&gt; the browser need not log-in.  Regeneration of password could be a use\n&gt; case when the old one is lost. So in this case the user cannot login\n&gt; until he answers some security questions but allowing a user to enter\n&gt; a web application without logging in is a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I send a link in an email for regeneration of a password then that\n&gt; link has to expire after a certain number of days. The url should\n&gt; become stale. How can I treat a particular url stale after a certain\n&gt; period ? I can store the time when the url was generated in the\n&gt; database but all url&#39;s will look the same in this case.\n&gt;\n&gt; This seems to be a very common usecase.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Mohan\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
