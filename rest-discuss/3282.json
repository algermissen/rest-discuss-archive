Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Questions that I think need to be answered:\n&gt; 1. How do you know what MIME-types one may POST or\n&gt; PUT to a given resource?\n&gt;\n&gt; My proposal is that servers return accept-POST and\n&gt; accept-PUT headers in response to GET requests,\n&gt; however these headers are not actually defined\n&gt; in any standard so perhaps there is another\n&gt; approach.\n\nI would like a solution to this problem also, I think it would help promote\nREST oriented applications.\nThere has been some discussion on this list in the past, here is a summary\nof the approaches I&#39;ve heard:\n\n1 Metadata within response content.\nThis works for HTML, but isn&#39;t suitable for unforgiving content like JPG,\nGIF, PDF, MS-Word, schema-bound XML, etc.\nFor a custom app with your own content types, you could use a &lt;meta&gt; or\n&lt;head&gt; element to provide the needed info.\nIdeally, the metadata would be available via a HEAD method as well, and this\napproach doesn&#39;t work with that.\n\n2 Metadata within response headers\nThis is your proposal, to have something like Accept-POST and Accept-PUT\nresponse headers for GET and HEAD.\n\n3 Metadata in a separate resource known to original resource\n3.1 Identified by response content\nThe content can provide the location of the metadata, rather than the\nmetadata itself. Same problems as #1 (doesn&#39;t work for all content types,\netc.)\n\n3.2 Identified by response header\nThis would be a header something like Meta-Location and would be availble\nvia GET or HEAD.\nPutting metadata in a separate resource allows for content negotiation to\nhappen on the description of the resource, so we don&#39;t get stuck with not\nenough metadata in the headers.\n\n4 Metadata in a separate resource but unknown to original resource\nThis inverts the problem - you have the URL to a resource definition, but\nyou don&#39;t know what the resources are that it applies to. However, you could\nexplicitly list those resources, or provide a pattern that matches the URI\nof the resources the defintion applies to. If you gather enough descriptions\nyou probably could do the lookup...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
