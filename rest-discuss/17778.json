T=\r\nhis might include the addition of certain Link headers.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree wi=\r\nth the &quot;Avoid avoid&quot; here.  It sounds a lot like out-of-band knowledge, and=\r\n in the opposite direction than is usual.  &quot;I know that V3.1.3 of FooClient=\r\n doesn&#39;t use the xyzzy link relation, so I&#39;ll just save bandwidth by not se=\r\nnding it&quot;.  The server could end up with a large amount of knowledge.  See =\r\nwurfl for an example of this going bad.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Why not stick to Accept (w=\r\nhich is that it&#39;s for) and use media type parameters?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Accept: appl=\r\nication/procurement;hypermediacontrols=3Dnew;q=3D1, application/procurement=\r\n;hypermediacontrols=3Dold;q=3D0.3\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Been there, done that :-) Too ente=\r\nprisey for my taste. Leads to packaging up feature sets into version number=\r\ns. I&#39;d always let the Accept express the general capability of the client. =\r\n(Which I read as: &quot;If you hand me application/atom I am pretty sure I can f=\r\nulfill my user&#39;s intent from there&quot;) Versioning makes the whole elegance go=\r\n away :-)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I was thinking more in terms of &#39;hints&#39; or &#39;best effort&#39;. =\r\nSending mobile devices different content (incl. bu way of a redirect) seems=\r\n ok. So why not &quot;direct that old legacy product we sold 5 years ago to that=\r\n old (set of) servers we keep around for these cases&quot;?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My original i=\r\nssue, BTW, was routing requests in a load balancer to direct clients that n=\r\need a new feature to those services that have the new feature installed and=\r\n are already up and running. In general: situations where you have scaled t=\r\no N services behind one IP that run different versions of a service (e.g. b=\r\necause they are being upgraded one by one while keeping the site in operati=\r\non).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; are obviously bad choices, but=\r\n you get the idea.  That way the media type can express the different &quot;vari=\r\nants&quot; within compatibility, and clients can express their capabilities in a=\r\n header designed for conneg.
