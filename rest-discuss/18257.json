I didn&#39;t say that either. I&#39;m saying there are design and\nimplementation aspects of system interfaces that are not covered by\nHTTP. At some level developers (human beings) need to communicate and\nreason about the software they write. Every web service provides\ninformation about something. Apart from the practical integration of a\nclient with a server we need to be able to discuss the &quot;something&quot;\nrationale behind a given service. Otherwise I as a developer won&#39;t\nknow if the information of a given service is of interest to me. This\nreasoning between developers (human beings) is at a conceptual level.\nFurthermore software is not only meant for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant\nfor humans to read and understand and reason about.\n\nMaybe the term &quot;conceptual type&quot; was unfortunate. My point in the\ndiscussion was that it may be of interest to talk about the concepts\nand information a service is meant to provide in order to then be able\nto reason about what media types to use or invent for a given service.\n\n&gt; Let me say it again: the problem that is being tried to solve does not exist.\n\nIs this your way of saying there is nothing to discuss? Or are you\nsaying there is no problem in deciding whether to define new media\ntypes or not? My understanding of the discussion was that we were\ndiscussing heuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media\ntypes.\n\n/Paul\n\n--\nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
