He also makes a quick point that you could\n&gt; acheive P2P by having both a client and a server on both ends.  However, I\n&gt; have seen several discussions here in which people are talking about the\n&gt; server pushing to the client.  It even seems that Fielding&#39;s own Waka\n&gt; contains features like this.\n\nIs there a difference between &quot;having both a client and a server on both\nends&quot;, and &quot;the server pushing to the client&quot;?\n\nDoes the server pushing to the client constitute messages following a \nrequest which are not direct responses to that request?\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
