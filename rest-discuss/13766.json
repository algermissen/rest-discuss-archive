If there isn&#39;t any, why do=\r\n you need to know when it stops?\n\nQuestion is because, if there is an outpu=\r\nt result from the process, you should not ask for server A being done or no=\r\nt, but for the result. That is, you ask if the result is ready or not.\nAny =\r\nserver can check that, if the result can be returned by any server in the f=\r\narm. Of course, if that second request comes to server A, another thread mu=\r\nst answer (since there is one doing the processing). \n\nNow, if you tell me =\r\nthe result stays only in server A, then we have a problem, since you will a=\r\nlso need to fix the result fetch to the server A, and no idea then what the=\r\n balancing is for.\n\nFinally, there is another option: callbacks. The server=\r\n ends up its processing by calling back the client through a callback port =\r\nor something. In case you wonder,there is no server state problem there, si=\r\nnce the call is done in one transaction (all the processing is done as the =\r\naction for the original request).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n--- =\r\nIn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sebastien Lambla&quot; &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi=\r\n all,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a modelling question for http. Let&#39;s say that I ex=\r\necute a\n&gt; long-running operation on server A, in response to a request from=\r\n a client.\n&gt; So as to not hold the connection, I want to send a 202, with a=\r\n response\n&gt; entity describing the expected wait time and the monitor URI th=\r\nat one can\n&gt; use until then.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The issue I&#39;m encountering is arou=\r\nnd having both server A and server B used\n&gt; behind a load balancing device,=\r\n where they share the same domain name.\n&gt; Server B would have no way to tel=\r\nl if server A is done with the processing\n&gt; yet or not.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; So I en=\r\nd up having to persist that data across all servers, and unsure if\n&gt; it&#39;s a=\r\n good idea at all. Those processes could be as short as a second and\n&gt; at m=\r\nost a couple of seconds. The problem is that, because it&#39;s a framework\n&gt; co=\r\nncern, there is no supporting code for my users to persist such\n&gt; informati=\r\non across servers.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; How would you solve this problem? Impose on =\r\nthe consumer to persist this\n&gt; information in their own data store? Publish=\r\n a &quot;in progress&quot; entity to a URI\n&gt; and use that as a monitor, and impose on=\r\n my consumers to expose those\n&gt; entities in their URI space?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In=\r\n other words, how do you persist state that is shared across servers when\n&gt;=\r\n the state is not part of the application but part of the framework people\n=\r\n&gt; use to implement their application? Is there even a way out of this?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; Same question can apply to revoking the cnonce in http digest for t=\r\nhat\n&gt; matter.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
