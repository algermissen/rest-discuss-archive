That is, perform some other requests\n&gt;&gt; using partiluar domain semantics of an accessed service?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sure.  You&#39;re just applying the layered-system constraint on the client\n&gt; side.  Thus, your client state becomes separated from application state.\n&gt; Application state is entirely derived from the retrieved representation,\n&gt; while actual client state is opaque to the server component which sent\n&gt; the representation, because it &quot;cannot &#39;see&#39; beyond the immediate layer\n&gt; with which [it interacts],&quot; to paraphrase REST.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For example, think of a client configuration that would cause the\n&gt;&gt; client to allways execute several searches when the home page of an\n&gt;&gt; online store is reached that provides OpenSearch forms?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that&#39;s out of scope to REST, which is only concerned with the\n&gt; interactions between connectors in a system.  What the user&#39;s agent\n&gt; actually does with the retrieved representations is opaque behind the\n&gt; uniform interface.  The media type tells the client all it really needs\n&gt; to know about rendering the document to obtain application state,\n&gt; doesn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, a user may employ an accessibility agent which performs\n&gt; specific actions based on content.  Or a Web accelerator which follows\n&gt; and pre-caches DNS responses and retrieved representations that a user\n&gt; hasn&#39;t yet requested, or what you suggested.  I just don&#39;t think REST\n&gt; cares about any of that. I would call these examples &quot;enhanced client\n&gt; state&quot;, but I don&#39;t see how any of that affects &quot;application state&quot; as\n&gt; envisioned by the server through its media-type declaration.\n&gt; \n\nYepp, that is pretty much how I see it also.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
