It\ntook me about three years to really get a solid grasp of it, and I have\na lot of experience in distributed systems theory and practice.\n\nYou also took Roy&#39;s comments completely out of context.  Yes, you do\nnot need to use GET to be using REST.  But that means you can&#39;t\nretrieve things (unless you want to do that ugly hack that Paul talked\nabout), which I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree is useful.  If you&#39;re only using POST,\nthen all you can do is EDI; send a document for processing, never\nknowing how it impacted the state of the system.\n\nYou might want to try incorporating some more of his words into your\nnext article;\n\n&quot;The problem with SOAP is that it tries to escape from the Web\ninterface.  It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it\nis deliberately trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather\nthan Web-like applications.&quot;\n\n&quot;This bears repeating: The difference between an application-level\nprotocol and a transport-level protocol is that an application-level\nincludes application semantics, by standard agreement, within\nthe messages that the protocol transfers.  That is why HTTP is called\na Transfer protocol.  It is impossible to conform to an\napplication-level protocol without also conforming faithfully to\nits message semantics.&quot;\n\n&quot;As a *separate* issue, Web Services cannot be considered an equal\npart of the Web until they allow their own resources to become\ninterconnected with the rest of the Web.  That means using URI to\nidentify all important resources, even if those URI are only used\nvia non-SOAP mechanisms (such as a parallel HTTP GET interface) after\nthe SOAPified processing is complete.&quot;\n\nPlease, feel free to ask us any questions.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
