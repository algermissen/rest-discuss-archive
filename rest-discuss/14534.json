For example, a \n&gt; banking service that spits out a JSON format that simply serializes the \n&gt; account and transaction data structures used internally to represent the \n&gt; service&#39;s resources. i.e. if you aren&#39;t targeting a specific &quot;type&quot; of \n&gt; client by translating to that client&#39;s media type are you violating the \n&gt; constraints of REST?\n\nI like this formulation of the problem. Yes, the service is sort-of \ntargeting itself instead of it&#39;s users. But are there any alternatives?\n\nIt is as if the smaller your audience is, the more are you violating REST. \nExample: the detailed representation of a egyptic scarabae collection - \nthere&#39;s probably not many who are going to consume that. Is it not RESTful \nto have a special XML (maybe even binary) representation of that?\n\nThere are people on this list who argue that representaions must be accepted \nas standards in order to call the service RESTful. Considering the above \nthoughts they have a good point: it would not matter if the audience for a \nrepresentation was big or small, as long as it has a standard \nrepresentation. Then banking clients works for all banks and scarabae \ncollectors can browse any scarabae collection on the net.\n\nMaybe we could simplify the problem a bit: 1) we cannot expect each and \nevery client to know all standard media-types, and 2) some media-types, like \nthe scarabae collection, are just too specialized to get accepted as a \nstandard media-type. So what if a service could be categorized as RESTful \n*with respect to a certain domain*?\n\nNow we could say that our scarabae service certainly is RESTful with respect \nto the scarabae domain - and similar with the banking example.\n\nThen we could use URL&#39;s for domain identifiers and have those URL&#39;s return a \n(standard) representation of the media types included in the domain.\n\nBut maybe I&#39;m just dreaming and should go to bed instead ...\n\n/J�rn \n\n\n"}}
