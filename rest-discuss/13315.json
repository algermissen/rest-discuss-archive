A &quot;REST\nPatterns&quot; site I think would be very helpful to a lot of people as it\nwould give solid examples of how some things could be done, even if\ndoes not present the to the metal specifics of how it is done.\n\nIt can promote the REST architecture and talk at a higher level, it\ncould even leave HTTP completely out of the equation.\n\nREST is a new way of thinking for many, and having answers to &quot;how do\nI...&quot; questions, in a central place, with some nice diagrams at a high\nlevel, would be very valuable.\n\nThe goal being not interoperability, per se, rather best practices for\nREST in the enterprise, regardless of the actual protocols etc. used.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n\n"}}
