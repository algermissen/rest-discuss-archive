Sorry if I&#39;m being pedantic, but jeesh.\n\nNo, that isn&#39;t being pedantic -- it is being superficial.\n\nWhat do you think abstractions are for?  When your parents told\nyou that the leaves of a given tree are &quot;green&quot;, did you have a\nhissy fit over colors?  Did you grab a leaf and demand that everyone\nconsider it to be the one true &quot;green&quot;?  Did you declare it heresy\nwhen the grass was also called green?  Did you complain when the\ncrayon package came with various shades of &quot;green&quot;?  Were you the\nkid who stuck all the green crayons in his pocket, so that only\nhe could be the one true creator of the green fuzz-balls that made\nbrown rectangles look like trees?  No?\n\nThen why is it so hard to accept that an ARCHITECTURAL STYLE\ncannot itself be implemented, just as there is no implementation\nof green (only examples)?  And that not being implementable in its\nstyle form does not mean that an architecture cannot be constructed\nin such a way as to fit our agreed style?  And that being abstract\ndoesn&#39;t mean it is worthless to be able to talk about the style,\nexamine its characteristics, debate which ones are &quot;best&quot; for a\ngiven application, and generally enjoy learning something that you\nmight not have known last week?\n\nWe can talk about green, various shades of green, and all the\nother colors that, when combined, do not come out green.  Children\nhave no problem understanding such things, though they might not\nyet understand the properties of light and vision that make it all\nwork.  Software architectural styles are much more complex, which\nmeans you need to spend a lot more time thinking about the subject\n(and drawing experiments) before it finally becomes clear.  And\nat that point you won&#39;t be complaining about abstractions: you&#39;ll\nstart looking for other colors.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
