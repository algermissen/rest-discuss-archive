I would be bowled over if N3 was also supp=\r\norted.\n - RelaxNG schema support (for the same reason as the previous point=\r\n -\n XmlSchema / XPath are too brittle in the face of REST).\n - I guess that=\r\n part of the community would like support for Atom\n(Pub) as well, although =\r\nI&#39;m not personally that fussed.\n\nWhat else would the group add to this list=\r\n?\n\nRegards, Alan Dean\n\n\n"}}
