Would it be built upon an HTTP\ninfrastructure or upon a WebDAV infrastructure? I do not know WebDAV as\nwell as I should or will. But I&#39;m thinking that for instance it could be\nuseful for all REST applications to support WebDAV&#39;s notion of\ncollections so that you would get compatibility with WebDAV collection\nmanagement tools &quot;for free&quot;. If a REST app has to do locking, it might\nas well use WebDAV locking. If it has to do object versioning, it might\nas well use WebDAV versioning.\n\nOpinions?\n\nLet&#39;s presume I&#39;m right. If you were building a REST app today, is there\na good WebDAV toolkit out there that is especially designed to be really\neasy to extend? Zope? 4Suite? Something in Java? mod_dav?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
