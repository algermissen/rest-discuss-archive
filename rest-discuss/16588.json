This email turned out a bit longer than I had intended...\n\nThis entire discussion reminds me of the way people see Richard\nStallman&#39;s stance on free software: Many people consider him extreme\n(since he&#39;s not willing to compromise at all), but his extreme (purist?)\npoints of view and sometimes hard-to-digest statements certainly help to\nkeep the discussion going and to communicate important issues.\n\nEric, I don&#39;t know you personally, but I applaud your insistence on your\npoints. Sometimes people who insist on details to the point where others\nbegin to roll their eyes are necessary to eventually help us see things\nmore clearly.\n\nNevertheless, engineering (in the real world) is always about making the\nright compromises. I&#39;m sure we can all agree on that.\n\nWhile various specs and dissertations tell us (or imply) that IANA types\nare preferred and others are discouraged, the reality still comes in\nshades of gray. If someone doesn&#39;t use an IANA registered type, I won&#39;t\ntell them that their system is not RESTful if all other constraints are\nmet. It may be only 95% RESTful, but for all practical purposes, that&#39;s\n&quot;good enough&quot;! It&#39;s RESTful. I&#39;m happy they are willing to put up with\nall the other REST constraints (which takes some effort) and give it a\ngood shot. Everything can always be improved and maybe using IANA types\nwould be an improvement. In the meantime, I applaud them for the effort.\n\nBut to make the right compromises as engineers, we need to be informed.\nYour insistence on IANA types certainly has helped me (probably many of\nus) to consider the matter more closely.\n\nMaybe what we could say is that there is a series of degrees by which an\narchitecture can be more and more RESTful. For example, the RMM\n( http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html )\ndoesn&#39;t mention media types at all! Yet, it discusses how an\narchitecture can come closer to the REST ideal, by focusing on some of\nthe other constraints.\n\nI would say, let&#39;s agree that &quot;some level&quot; of RESTfulnes is better than\nnone. We can describe the ideal system, but should realize that in the\nreal world the ideal will rarely be reached. And to be really useful, we\ncould try to outline which issues we would have to deal with for every\nconstraint we chose NOT to implement 100%.\n\nTomorrow I will give a talk about REST to some people and in preparing\nthis talk, I just realized again that every time you don&#39;t design your\nsystem in a RESTful manner you end up having to hack around the way the\nInternet works for you. It (the Internet infrastructure, tools, systems,\netc.) tries to be helpful, but can&#39;t if you don&#39;t have a RESTful system.\nIf your system is RESTful, it all tends to fall in place so nicely, it&#39;s\nalways amazing to see, almost beautiful in a way.\n\nSo, if we are insisting of various REST constraints, it might be good to\nfight that battle with the technical arguments, rather than quotes from\nspecs. Help me to make the right compromises! For example, if\nintermediaries on the Internet don&#39;t understand my media type, what\ncould be some of the technical consequences/risks? That only needs to be\nstated once, clearly, and then the discussion can be over and done with.\nBecause once it is communicated we have the knowledge to make informed\ndecisions.\n\nThe same analysis could be made for every constraint. Then, as an\nengineer, I can make an informed decision to implement a RESTful system\n(yes, still &#39;RESTful&#39;), which ignores a particular constraint with open\neyes, for a particular, technical reason I might have.\n\nYou always here that discussions about REST can take on an somewhat\nscary religious intensity. Let&#39;s avoid that. If I don&#39;t adhere to a\nconstraint I won&#39;t burn in hell. I might have to deal with some\ntechnical issues eventually, but that&#39;s something I may chose to deal\nwith. Quotes won&#39;t convince me, but technical arguments may under some\ncircumstances.\n\n\nJuergen\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nRESTx - the fastest and easiest way to created RESTful web services\nhttp://restx.org\n\n\n"}}
