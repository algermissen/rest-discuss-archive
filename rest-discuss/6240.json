Part of the curriculum  \nis accounting and financial reporting. As you may already know,  \nfinancial reporting of public companies is bound by strict rules  \n(standardized protocols), as to improve &#39;interoperation&#39; between  \ncompanies and (potentional) investors.\n\nTo what extend is the attention to HTTP and REST in computer science  \nor software engineering classes?\nI don&#39;t know how any student could be any worse of by knowing HTTP  \n1.1 thoughout, while more advanced students could definitely benefit  \nfrom the generalizations found in REST. Getting to know REST has made  \nme a better architect and engineer for sure.\n\nI&#39;d love to hear some comments from people affiliated with universities.\nAre there any professors who deeply care about REST? If not, why not?\nHow could we improve the REST-awareness of professors and other  \nteachers?\n\nThanks for your input.\n\nMeryn\n\n\n\n"}}
