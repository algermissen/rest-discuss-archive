If you pay enough money, you\ncan own your own website and sell whatever you like - used food, collectible\nlawn chairs, whatever - but on the &#39;main&#39; website, that sort of stuff is\nfrowned upon.\nSo... the product data submitted would be accepted and stored - but the\nlisting for one website would not be created, but the listing for another\nwebsite would be created.\n\nThe response to the submitter needs to provide details that the intent to\nsell succeeded in one website, but not another - partial success.\n\n"}}
