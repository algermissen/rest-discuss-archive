They were\nforbidden anywhere in a URI before the IPv6 groups screwed that up.\nThat&#39;s why we don&#39;t painstakingly list all the forbidden characters\nany more -- because some idiots decided the fact that we listed them\nmeant that they were available for extensions.\n\n&quot;each syntax rule lists the characters allowed within that component&quot;\n\n&quot;URI scheme specifications must define their own\n  syntax so that all strings matching their scheme-specific syntax will\n  also match the &lt;absolute-URI&gt; grammar, as described in Section 4.3.&quot;\n\nand for those who still can&#39;t read ABNF ...\n\n    A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6\n    [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal\n    within square brackets (&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;).  This is the only place where\n    square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.\n\nHow could I be any more clear that that?\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
