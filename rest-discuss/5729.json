I&#39;d recommend an \nerror message XML going along with the 400 response that included at \nleast a human-readable message the application could just return to the \nuser if it can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) deal with the error beyond that, and \noptionally elements identifying the error in an application-specific way.\n\nXForms may RDFForms may or may not be of use to you.\n\n"}}
