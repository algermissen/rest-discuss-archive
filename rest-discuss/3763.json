But I think it illustrates a\n&gt; simple, clean way of handling access in a RESTful manner.  Was this how\n&gt; others were imagining that it might work?\n\nI have different preferences for the details, but the overall\napproach fits my idea of RESTful access control.\n\nBy giving each user-specific resource its own URL, you bring your\naccess control policy into the REST model. Each permission has a\nURL and can be manipulated like a normal resource. When relying on\nusernames, individual permissions don&#39;t have a URL and thus can&#39;t\nbe manipulated, or even referred to, using the REST model. REST\nneeds URLs in order to function.\n\nOne of the things I like most about this type of solution is how\neasy it is to model the solution using a web diagram. A web\ndiagram is just a diagram that uses circles to represent resources\nand arrows to represent URLs. You could very easily go up to a\nwhiteboard and draw a web diagram for your http://my.bank/ example\napplication. You could use the web diagram to explain to someone\nexactly what your application&#39;s security policy is and how it\nworks. You could then go to a web browser and show how your\nimplementation directly corresponds to the model drawn on the\nwhiteboard. I think this makes access control very tangible, easy\nto undertand, and RESTful.\n\nFor an introduction to web diagrams, see:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/Tutorial/overview.html\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
