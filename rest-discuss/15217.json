My=\r\n answer is about the idea of defining meaning to concepts and make all peop=\r\nle follow that one, in general, not only Client. Sorry again.\n\nStill, I for=\r\nesee that many others that will join this group in the future, and possibly=\r\n some of the ones in the group, will use the client word. So, we are not go=\r\ning to escape the fate of asking: what do you mean by client?\n\nFurthermore,=\r\n REST is not the only thing out there, you can expect the same thing to hap=\r\npen again when somebody says client meaning a completely different thing th=\r\nan user-agent.\n\nWhat does that mean? We will always need to read in context=\r\n, no escape for that, and we will always expect the word client may not mea=\r\nn user-agent.\n\nWilliam.  \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mark Wonsil=\r\n &lt;mark_wonsil@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; If I look at a REST service like I do an SQL =\r\nserver then Eric&#39;s point makes more sense.
