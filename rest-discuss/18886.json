But it lacks &quot;forms&quot; that was why I think I need a\ntiny dsl that could describe forms, but not necessarily inline because\nit may decrease readability. May I use a single profile for both the\nrendering  of the markdown and the processing of the dsl?\n\nI&#39;m looking to get around the need for such a dsl. For search forms, I\nwould use OpenSearch by using the Link header field with rel=&quot;search&quot;\nas standardized by rfc5988. The Link header field is IMO very well\nsuited for representations which will be consumed by command line\nprograms because of the way the terminal was meant to be used (the\ncontrols are outside the documents they work on, hence command line\noptions).\n\nI don&#39;t know if I should put efforts in defining new link relations\nfor what is currently missing in the public domain or simply use a\nprofile link as in draft-wilde-profile-link-02. If ever form controls\nis ever possible to be defined as link relation. Any idea on this?\n\nIn all case, a profile link for the markdown rendering looks good.\nThanks for your time.\n\n"}}
