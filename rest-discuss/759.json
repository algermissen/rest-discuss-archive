I&#39;m still not clear about exactly what you meant, or if \nthat idea is still part of the proposal.  \n\nIt would also be useful if you showed how the PO gets accepted.  \nPurchase orders represent contractual bindings between buyer and \nseller and should be explicitly accepted in some way (according to \nsome explicit rules).  (I agree that representing the rules in linked \nXML business process scripts is the right way to do it.)\n\n(I assume &quot;approved&quot; is internal, the boss&#39;s approval, and not the \nsame as &quot;accepted&quot; by the seller.)\n\nOne more sort-of side issue:  we found in ebXML that digital \nsignatures could not be used (all by themselves) to indicate \nacceptance, because they are used for so many other purposes. \n(Rejections should be signed, too.)  The content of the signed \ndocument or message should explicitly declare its intent.\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
