A further point is that the scenario only makes\nsense for sets of objects for which some predictable naming scheme conceptually\nexists.  (Thanks also to Paul for his rather ridiculous but pertinent example\nabout sparse, irregular spaces in some earlier message;  I never imagined using\nnames for those, but it&#39;s good to be clear.)  I have changed to wording to:\n\n&quot;This Web server contains and makes available one or more resources that are not\nlinked to by any other publicly available resource, but for which one or more\npredictable naming schemes conceptually exists.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; I do think generative naming is very useful but I&#39;m thinking of the case\n&gt; where you have to translate addresses. Two disparate systems have &#39;local&#39;\n&gt; names for something and don&#39;t know about each other. You receive a name from\n&gt; serviceA and need to do something via serviceB. Defining a pattern based\n&gt; mapping is handy. I don&#39;t know how to do it otherwise. Anyone? Anyone?\n\nHmmm...  this is an interesting point.  Want to elaborate?\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
