I personally don&#39;t see anything wrong with that but If\n&gt; you really don&#39;t want something like this happening, then you can ask\n&gt; the client to send the hash or something of the resource it wants to\n&gt; delete. Or maybe the pop could be done via a POST instead of DELETE.\n&gt; My orignal point was that making the DELETE on the element instead of\n&gt; &#39;top&#39; would break the semantics with which a stack is thought up and\n&gt; used. whatever you do with the stack has to be via the TOP and not\n&gt; through the individual resource.\n\nIf I had a stack which lets you do:\n\ntop = stack.get();\ntop.discard();\n\nThat would still be a stack, even through your discarding from the\nelement, not the stack.\n\nI think DELETE /top is correct for some semantics, you can imagine\nthere&#39;s only resource which you place and remove an element from.  And\nthe moment you remove that resource, someone else goes and creates\nthat resource again. There are other ways to do stacks with entirely\ndifferent semantics.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or each GET is a different element and somehow the DELETE is\n&gt;&gt; correlated to that GET. Where is that state conveyed?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Assaf\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Delete the TOP just does that .. delete the current top. How does it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; matter if after that another element becomes the top?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, there might be arguments against what I just said , but the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; increase in coupling caused by any other solution imho makes for an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; overwhelming choice for this option.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In short, I like the OPs solution.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
