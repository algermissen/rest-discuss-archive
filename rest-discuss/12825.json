OTH, if the UBL was not intended\n&gt;&gt; as a pure message passing format but would go about and define its own\n&gt;&gt; media types we would be pretty close. UBL has the whole order-\n&gt;&gt; acceptance collaboration well defined and minting a set of media types\n&gt;&gt; from that would not be a problem, IMHO.\n\n&gt; I agree. I&#39;ve recently started to advocate using a media type for a  \n&gt; collection of related documents - something about halfway between  \n&gt; application/xml and application/vnd.my-company.order+xml (e.g. in this  \n&gt; case, it might be application/ubl-procurement+xml).\n\nYes, this aligns with the thoughts I had yesterday after sending the emails. I&#39;d now argue that the media type identifies the application (application kind) that is supposed to handle the message. In this view, it would be perfectly fine to have a bunch of related schemas (or root elements of one schema) because the application that can handle the media type would need to know how to deal with them anyway.\n\nThis shifts my original thinking from the media type sort of conveying the sender&#39;s intent to telling the recipient in what application context to process it.\n\nAnd this is I think why Roy used application/quicken and not something like application/order. The media type is not there to say *what* the message is, but in what application context it would be understood correctly.\n\napplication/ubl-procurement+xml emphasizes that quite nicely, I think.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n"}}
