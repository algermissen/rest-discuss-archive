The argument is that you can&#39;t just call\n&gt; anything that gets used self-descriptive by virtue of its being used --\n&gt; that may be self-descriptive in the natural-language sense, but it\n&gt; isn&#39;t self-descriptive in the normative, technical sense.  It isn&#39;t\n&gt; self-descriptive &quot;enough&quot; to not be self-descriptive at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For one thing, a media type link could be followed by a human and the\n&gt; &gt; content perused.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So can a link relation link.  But how is that standardized?  REST isn&#39;t\n&gt; meant to be a label that applies to any HTTP solution that works, or\n&gt; even that&#39;s scalable, it&#39;s meant to describe a subset of solutions that\n&gt; work by using defined standards.  Changing how standards are defined is\n&gt; a reasonable debate; it&#39;s even reasonable to debate whether\n&gt; standardization is necessary in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t reasonable to argue that nonstandardized solutions are\n&gt; acceptable in REST, because that would be some other architectural\n&gt; style, by definition.  Unregistered identifiers aren&#39;t standardized,\n&gt; therefore they aren&#39;t the REST style, even in &quot;spirit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any event, I&#39;m not anti-IANA - I just think that there needs to be\n&gt; &gt; better support for media type extensibility to greater specificity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t disagree with that at all.  I can think of half a dozen reasons\n&gt; off the top of my head, for why the IANA registry is broken and needs\n&gt; to be fixed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Feel free to blame application/xml and others for basically defining\n&gt; &gt; how to structure a glob of data but not what it means . Also, to be\n&gt; &gt; honest, I consider that saying that you can&#39;t be self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; unless your specific subtype is registered with the IANA is\n&gt; &gt; nonsensical (I gave the example of RSS in an earlier thread, but\n&gt; &gt; there are plenty of other well-known unregistered types and subtypes).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But that requires redefining the meaning of self-descriptive.  RFC 3023\n&gt; defines +xml, meaning such types *may* be registered, it doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; any +xml type *is* registered, let alone standardized.  It&#39;s nonsensical\n&gt; to me to treat this as a loophole around registration, or to state that\n&gt; such an unregistered type is self-descriptive -- self-descriptive means\n&gt; registered, technically speaking.  Using +xml isn&#39;t some sort of\n&gt; automatic standard, or even registered.\n&gt;\n&gt; By stating that registration is unneccessary, the bar for self-\n&gt; descriptiveness is raised to ubiquitous, i.e. tied to uptake, which\n&gt; isn&#39;t the point of the constraint.  Self-descriptive has nothing to do\n&gt; with uptake, which is reasonable, because otherwise we have to\n&gt; determine at what point an identifier becomes ubiquitous enough to be\n&gt; deemed self-descriptive (which requires redefining self-descriptive,\n&gt; first).\n&gt;\n&gt; Without redefining the term, there is no way that any unregistered\n&gt; media type, no matter how ubiquitous, can possibly qualify -- that\n&gt; isn&#39;t what the term means.  My cousin isn&#39;t my brother even if we&#39;re so\n&gt; close that he&#39;s my bro -- technically speaking.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the IANA were to offer some procedure by which I could easily\n&gt; &gt; register my application/vnd.something-specific+xml then I would be\n&gt; &gt; happier, but they don&#39;t...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed, but this problem may be solved without changing the definition\n&gt; of self-descriptive such that we don&#39;t need to solve this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...and the pragmatic reality of web dev is that absent an easy type /\n&gt; &gt; subtype registration process, the types simply won&#39;t get registered\n&gt; &gt; (which, in practice, has little or no bearing upon their utility or\n&gt; &gt; how well-known they actually are).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just like self-descriptive says nothing about utility or ubiquity.  If\n&gt; the mechanism for self-descriptiveness is broken, then it needs fixing.\n&gt; Abandoning the constraint because it&#39;s too hard in practice, isn&#39;t the\n&gt; solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I floated my idea simply because it&#39;s an obviously easy way to\n&gt; &gt; federate registration. I&#39;m not sure how broad a change it implies to\n&gt; &gt; the existing standards stack (it may even be a very significant\n&gt; &gt; change for all I know) but that need not necessitate calling it a bad\n&gt; &gt; idea (although I acknowledge it might warrant calling it impractical)\n&gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t see standards are requiring immutability anyway. There is\n&gt; &gt; work going on right now looking at how HTTP might be improved in the\n&gt; &gt; light of 1.1 having been around for over a decade, so it&#39;s not\n&gt; &gt; inconceivable that we could see an HTTP/1.2 at some point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad idea; I&#39;m pushing back against the notion\n&gt; that unregistered identifiers are self-descriptive because registries\n&gt; serve no purpose, in which case anything and everything is self-\n&gt; descriptive, so what&#39;s the point of the constraint?\n&gt;\n&gt; By definition, such a change would not be HTTP/1.2 because it requires\n&gt; a new major version number to replace the IANA registry.  HTTP 1.2, or\n&gt; even HTTPbis, could be changed to define some other registry in\n&gt; addition to IANA.  I&#39;m trying to figure out what you mean to change,\n&gt; HTTP or MIME?  Either way may be a very good idea, I&#39;m not passing\n&gt; judgment -- only saying that self-descriptive requires registration, so\n&gt; declaring the IANA registry broken and not using it doesn&#39;t meet the\n&gt; constraint.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\r\n--0016364ec9bc2d4b850490eaf979\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nEric,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The thought occurs to me that we are circling arou=\r\nnd the question of &quot;what is [to be] standardised&quot;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;You are, I believe, coming from the perspective that the only way to f=\r\nulfil the standardisation necessary to comply with the constraint is to hav=\r\ne a registry and that at the moment there is only one.
