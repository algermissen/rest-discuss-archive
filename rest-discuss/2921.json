He&#39;s a classic dug-in vested interest. I&#39;m \nstruggling to keep this from getting any more personal than Dave has \nalready made it. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s how technical discussions should \nbe conducted.\n\nXML-RPC will probably continue to be a success for small, simple apps \nuntil the next wave of RPC-reinvented overtakes it: SVG-RPC? RDF-RPC? \nYAML-RPC? In the meantime, I don&#39;t think we should begrudge XML-RPC any \nsuccess in those domains. It works for what it works for and does not \nwork for what it doesn&#39;t work for and the market would figure that out \nwithout any effort from us.\n\nOver the last year, we&#39;ve seen REST has substantial momentum and a \nvariety of successful applications. Everywhere I go, people come up to \nme and thank me for articulating what, to them, was always common sense.\n\nREST is still the leading way to publish and update complicated datasets \nusing XML or HTML. In that vein, I&#39;ve finally started a long delayed \nproject, which is to start listing the public REST apps people tell me \nabout when I meet them. I&#39;ve surely forgotten most of them because I&#39;m \njust cobbling together the list from memory.\n\nhttp://www.prescod.net/rest/apps\n\nAs far as REST toolkits: Roy Fielding (a classic example of someone who \nspends all day talking rather than doing) codified REST and built \nseveral &quot;toolkits&quot; around it. One is called Apache. Others that I have \nexperimented with are Quixote, Zope and Microsoft .NET.\n\nAnd as long as we&#39;re throwing around case studies:\n\nhttp://effbot.org/zone/rest-vs-rpc.htm\n\nHe mentions that there were two &quot;aha&quot; moments that lead him from XML-RPC \nto REST -- before he even knew that the latter has a name:\n\n  1. He learned more about XML and how to work with it.\n\n  2. He needed to work with binary data and realized that URIs and HTTP \nwere excellent for that.\n\nIt is my strong sense that the more popular XML becomes the less \nfrightened people will be of using REST. It won&#39;t be possible to scare \nthem away by saying: &quot;you might have to parse XML!&quot;\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
