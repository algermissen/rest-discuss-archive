If it is your expectatio=\r\nn that the service you are interacting with is actually an atompub service =\r\nthen fine, go ahead. If the service behaves as you expect, fine; your use c=\r\nase succeeds.\n\nIf it isn&#39;t you&#39;ll discover that from the response and chang=\r\ne configuration of your set of entry URIs or whatever.\n\nThe decision regard=\r\ning your use case comes first and you do not need to double check at runtim=\r\ne. For example, you have a bookmark for your favorite search engine. Do you=\r\n check every time you use that bookmark whether the search engine is still =\r\nthere? Or do you just use the bookmark based according to your expectations=\r\n?\n\nLikewise, what does that check for atompub capabilities buy you? The rea=\r\nson you check for them is that you assume they are there in the first place=\r\n. If that check fails .... then what? You are in exactly the same situation=\r\n as when you POST you atom entry right away and see what happens.\n\n\nThe nat=\r\nure (as in &quot;Amazon is an online store&quot;) of services changes slowly (if at a=\r\nll) and the particular HTTP idioms that services use also changes slowly (e=\r\n.g. creation with PUT vs. creation with POST). In REST there is, IMHO at le=\r\nast, a third xxx-time besides the traditional design-time and run-time. It =\r\nis what I think of as &#39;configuration-time&#39;. This is where a method like OPT=\r\nIONS plays its part, for example. Try out a service once, learn what it is =\r\nand what its particularities are and then adjust your configuration for int=\r\neractions with that service. The things you discover at configuration-time =\r\nare not likely to change soon. If they do, you adjust your configuration an=\r\nd maybe you do not need to do that , ever.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, what thing in this c=\r\nase is atom pub capable? The format that the links are occurring within, or=\r\n the targets of the links themselves? I&#39;d argue the latter. You can take th=\r\nat argument too far, of course, but generally I see profiles as describing =\r\nformat conventions, and link relations as describing behaviours of resource=\r\ns. Of course, some of those behaviours can be &quot;produce this format&quot; and som=\r\ne of the formatting conventions can be &quot;link to something with this behavio=\r\nur&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am happy to be proven wrong on this, I just think we need good pa=\r\ntterns of use / best practices to encourage reasonable design.\n\n+1\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Make sense?\n\n\n"}}
