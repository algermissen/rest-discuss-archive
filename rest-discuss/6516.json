An individual apple\nmay represent the &quot;apples&quot; concept, but this can&#39;t have much to do\nwith REST.  REST representations are bit streams.\n\nIn any event, if REST newbies want to understand resource as a\nmapping of time to representations, it is probably more intuitive to\ndemonstrate that with www.weather.com.  I don&#39;t think of the weather\nin my town as a box of anything.  It&#39;s just the weather.  I look again;\nit has changed.\n\nPeople who need to understand REST are going to be computer\nscientists.  It is reasonable to expect them to understand mappings\nwhose domain is time and whose range is bit streams.\n\nAnyway, if you do decide to pursue this, I hope you will find a way\nto do it that does not begin by planting the idea that REST somehow\ncondones container-containee inconsistency.  There is really no\nbasis for that.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Eric J. Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jon Hanna&quot; &lt;jon@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 25, 2006 7:17 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Resources as Orange Apples\n\n\n: &gt;\n: &gt;A resource is not necessarily a set. It could be a set, it could also be\n: &gt;something else (e.g., an apple).\n: &gt;\n:\n: I think a resource, or a URI, is always a box (or set). The resource is \nnever\n: an apple, only the concept of an apple.  If there is no apple, the box is\n: empty -- that&#39;s the null set i.e. a 404.  I think the actual apple itself \nis\n: always a representation of the concept of an apple.\n:\n: The analogy really breaks down if we insist that &quot;an apple&quot; is itself a\n: resource, because we&#39;re dealing with the Internet here.  If we have a \nnonzero\n: number of apples we can never be certain how many apples we have, and of\n: course if someone were to eat an apple it wouldn&#39;t exactly deplete our \nstock.\n:\n: If I&#39;m doing version control I may also have some rotten apples in my box,\n: otherwise all rotten apples are cached externally to my box until a fresh\n: apple takes the place of each (revalidation).  As soon as the box contains\n: one apple that apple multiplies like rabbits.  A resource is a concept not \nan\n: object, an object is always a representation of its concept.\n:\n: If my box isn&#39;t identifying the null set it must always contain either at\n: least one (thing called an) apple, or one and only one pointer to some \nother\n: box of apples.  If I want my box of apples to directly identify another \nbox\n: of apples (author&#39;s preferred version) then it may contain one redirection\n: pointer.\n:\n: If I want my box of apples to directly identify many other boxes of apples\n: (reader&#39;s preferred versions) and it contains multiple redirection \npointers,\n: it has ceased to be a box of apples and has become a box of boxes.  The\n: apples in those other boxes may be the same, but they are not equivalent \nas\n: they are members of different sets.\n:\n: &gt;\n: &gt;Furhter,\n: \n &gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges#Oranges_as_a_type_of_apple\n: &gt;doesn&#39;t really make it okay to put oranges where &quot;apples&quot; is on the\n: &gt;label, indeed it would be pushing it to put oranges where &quot;pomum\n: &gt;aurantium&quot; is labelled.\n: &gt;\n:\n: I would agree, had I implied that my box contained apples-as-fruits, which\n: maybe I did.  What if we call it &quot;a box of things called apples&quot; instead? \nIf\n: the pictures inside are shown to a reasonable person who is asked, &quot;what \nare\n: these&quot; the response would not be &quot;photographs&quot; it would be &quot;apples&quot; or\n: &quot;pictures of apples&quot;.\n:\n: Either response satisfies &quot;things called apples&quot; and so does &quot;pomum\n: aurantium&quot;.\n:\n: It&#39;s hard to illustrate the point that if I wanted to imply that my box \nwas\n: only full of what people commonly know as an apple but I also had some \npomum\n: aurantiums laying around, that those should go in a box labeled &quot;oranges&quot;.\n: I&#39;m hoping my re-writer can do a better job.\n:\n: -Eric\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n: __________ NOD32 1.1725 (20060825) Information __________\n:\n: This message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\n: http://www.eset.com\n:\n: \n\n\n"}}
