As in: is it really =93following yo=\r\nur nose=94 if you already explain beforehand what=92s going to happen?\nI th=\r\nink it is, but maybe not everyone=92s convinced.\n\n&gt; i think it is important=\r\n to keep in mind that a sitemap, looked at as a resource, is a very RESTful=\r\n thing in itself, it contains a (large) set of links, and clients can find =\r\nsuch a map and use such a map purely by &quot;follow your nose&quot; principles.\n\nThe=\r\ny can, provided they understand the link relations.\nTo what extent you thin=\r\nk this is possible with generic clients?\n\nBest,\n\nRuben\n"}}
