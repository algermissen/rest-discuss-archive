Last year, when I did the REST-based\ninterface overhaul for my group&#39;s web service project, the spec I\nwrote was partly about capturing the xml vocabulary of the\napplication, and partly about specifying the legal permutations\nof resources and HTTP methods (and of course response codes).\n\nThe spec was somewhat formal (in the sense that it followed a\npretty strict pattern for conveying these data), but I could imagine\na strictly formal notation as well, not unlike WSDL.\n\nI don&#39;t know WSDL very well, but I&#39;ll conjecture out loud that\nthere&#39;s nothing stopping you from using it to describe the\nsyntax and legal operation/resource space for an application that\nis REST-based.\n\nDoes anyone know why that wouldn&#39;t work?  Is this not what you&#39;re\ndriving at?\n\nWalden\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Bone&quot; &lt;jbone@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 19, 2003 5:26 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Documenting REST resource models\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So we&#39;ve all been using a variety of ad-hoc mechanisms to describe\n&gt; resource models for a while now, including the chatty but pervasive\n&gt; sort of &quot;protocol traces&quot; that show the back-and-forth flow of messages\n&gt; between a resource provider and consumer / client.  I&#39;m wondering if\n&gt; anybody&#39;s got preferred formats / standards / conventions for how to\n&gt; describe:\n&gt;\n&gt; the set of resources that are available\n&gt; i.e. the permutations of URIs that are allowed / meaningful\n&gt; the set of methods each one takes\n&gt; for POST and PUT, the formats and constraints of allowed input\n&gt; descriptions of representations / result codes returned by each method\n&gt; / input permutation per resource\n&gt;\n&gt; Love to see what people are doing in this sense.  I would hazard an\n&gt; intuitive guess that a lack of even a semi-formal set of conventions\n&gt; for declaratively describing / documenting resource models is one of\n&gt; the main sources of friction that we (the REST community) experience in\n&gt; trying to communicate with the unenlightened. ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
