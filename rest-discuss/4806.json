I&#39;ve described them and defined URIs for each\n&gt; type below. Any comment would be much appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Get a map showing a route from a source location to a destination\n&gt; with optional intermediate locations:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /map?\n&gt; srcx=00001&srcy=00002&dest1x=00003&dest1y=00004&centerAbout=route&sca\n&gt; le=6000\n&gt;\n&gt; or alternatively using path parameters:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /map/srcx=00001;srcy=00002;dest1x=00003;dest1y=00004;centerAbout=\n&gt; route;scale=6000\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Get a map displaying all features of a given type within a\n&gt; specified radius of the source location (proximity search):\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /map/x=00001;y=00002;centerAbout=src;scale=6000?\n&gt; radius=5000&filter1=restaurants&filter2=licensed\n&gt;\n\nOne way of looking at this issue, and its not the only way, is that\nyour URIs identify items of interest and by adding a query to the URI\nyou ask a question of that item of interest.\n\nPut another way, the absolute path before the question mark is always\nspecified by the server and the query part after the question mark\nmay be specified by the client.\n\nSo, if you are currently at a location the client might ask how to get\nto another location:\n\n GET\n/map/x=00001;y=00002?destx=00003&desty=00004;centerAbout=route;scale=6000\n\nor find local restaurants:\n\n GET\n/map/x=00001;y=00002?scale=6000;radius=5000&filter1=restaurants&filter2=lice\nnsed\n\nDetermining whether the parameter belongs with the path or the query is then\na matter of deciding whether the client should be able to modify it.\n\n&gt; With an arbitrary number of destination locations possible in case\n&gt; 1) and an unbounded number of filters in case 2) these URIs could\n&gt; get quite lengthy.  Are there any rules of thumb for determining\n&gt; when a query has become too long to be conveniently handled by a GET\n&gt; operation, and if so what are the alternatives?\n\nThere are no rules but some implementations of proxy and origin servers have\nphysical limits on the number of characters in a URI.\n\nThe alternative is then to use POST. This has the drawback that it cannot be\nbookmarked.\n\n\n\n"}}
