Here may lie some of\n&gt; the source of disagreement.\n&gt;   \n\nIf a link in my application is to &#39;PDF report&#39; which is the PDF \nrepresentation of /report then I need a way to modify the accept header \nto fit the user preference for that link and over-ride the browser \ndefaults. Very few UAs behave this way with content types, that&#39;s why I \ndescribe browsers as a special case.\n\n&gt; Here is something to think about, in the meantime. Imagine a browser\n&gt; which supports the @accept attribute. Now imagine a user who is\n&gt; reading an RFC, which is located at URI &lt;A&gt;, with\n&gt; @accept=&#39;text/plain&#39;. The URI &lt;A&gt; in fact supports text, HTML, and\n&gt; PDF. But like all RFCs, only the text is normative. What do they see\n&gt; in the location bar? &lt;A&gt;. In their browser window, they see plain\n&gt; text. You have used @accept=&#39;text/plain&#39; because you wanted this user\n&gt; to read the normative version, not the non-normative version.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now - imagine that user copies that URI from the location bar, as\n&gt; users do every day, & includes the URI in an email they send to\n&gt; somebody else (user b). User b, however, has lost the @accept\n&gt; information - because the principle of uniform identifiers has been\n&gt; broken. Now user b is reading a non-normative version of the spec. Not\n&gt; the end of the world - but something has been lost, because the\n&gt; principle that Joe Hanna mentions has been violated.\n&gt;   \n\nWell, has anything been lost? Does it matter what UA and/or \nrepresentation a user *choses* to use against that URI?\n\nIf you had a resource at example.com/report and you want to email it to \nFred to show him the PDF representation, why not email him:\n\n&quot;Hi Fred, there&#39;s a PDF report I think you should see at \nexample.com/report - have a look in Acrobat and see what you think.&quot; - \nhumanized human -computer interaction!\n\nI, personally, don&#39;t think it matters that much which UA a user choses \nprovided it talks HTTP and can properly render the content types it \nAccepts. Being able to right click the link in the email and have an \n&#39;open with..&#39; menu which listed your appropriate UAs for the \ncontent-types available at the URI would be a neat bit of functionality too.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n"}}
