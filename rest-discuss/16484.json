REST\n&gt;&gt; has a self-descriptive *messaging* constraint.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; IANA registration is neither necessary, nor sufficient to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; self-describing.  And if by &quot;standardized&quot;, you mean IANA\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registration, that&#39;s a very narrow view of standards, given that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are many standards organizations in the world.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; IANA is not a standards body, it&#39;s a registry, which recognizes\n&gt;&gt; standards published by any entity that claims to be a standards body.\n&gt;&gt; On the Web, IANA registration is absolutely a requirement -- how can\n&gt;&gt; you square your claim that it isn&#39;t with Roy&#39;s clear definition of the\n&gt;&gt; term?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Can that *be* any more clear?  Is there some alternate registry for the\n&gt;&gt; Web that I&#39;m not aware of?  If your media type isn&#39;t registered, and\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re sending it over the Web, you&#39;re not even _attempting_ to be\n&gt;&gt; RESTful.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; To the &quot;sufficient&quot; question: if I have a document that I return as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; XML (application/xml), what really matters to the consumer of that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; document - can I associate a schema with the document?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That doesn&#39;t make your messaging self-descriptive, because you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; requiring introspection to determine the nature of the document.  I\n&gt;&gt; need to know the nature of the data by looking at the headers, not\n&gt;&gt; (perhaps) unzipping your content and sniffing it first -- application/\n&gt;&gt; xml is *not* self-descriptive, as has been (correctly) pointed out on\n&gt;&gt; this list a hundred times...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If it isn&#39;t, even though the media type in use is well-defined and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registered with IANA, absent some form of schema (DTD, XML Schema,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RelaxNG), the client I wrote really cannot assume that the meanings\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are the same.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; No, self-descriptiveness does not require introspection of the content\n&gt;&gt; to determine its processing model, it&#39;s dependent on registered media\n&gt;&gt; type identifiers.  If I send XHTML as text/plain, you need to treat it\n&gt;&gt; as text/plain, not introspect it and determine that its schema means it\n&gt;&gt; should be treated as XHTML -- that&#39;s sniffing, and sniffing has nothing\n&gt;&gt; to do with REST.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; As to the necessary question:  Was the &quot;Atom&quot; specification any less\n&gt;&gt;&gt; valid and self-describing the day before it was registered with IANA\n&gt;&gt;&gt; than it was the day after?  It was self-describing before and after.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; No, it was not.  Identifiers that aren&#39;t listed in *any* registry can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; *possibly* meet Roy&#39;s definition of self-descriptiveness:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Before Atom&#39;s identifier was registered in IANA, it was registered...\n&gt;&gt; where?  If the identifier isn&#39;t in a registry, then it can&#39;t point to a\n&gt;&gt; specification, so it can&#39;t *possibly* meet Roy&#39;s definition.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; The internet has few baked in central control points - DNS might be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the only one, really - even with respect to REST, we have a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; combination of standards organizations including the IETF, W3C, IANA,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and OASIS that all contribute &quot;standards&quot; to help the web form.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; None of which aren&#39;t recognized by the IANA registry, which is a\n&gt;&gt; registry, not a standards body.  Merely a means to point identifiers to\n&gt;&gt; descriptive documents, published by *any* entity that claims to be\n&gt;&gt; releasing a &quot;standard&quot; by the entity&#39;s own (and not IANA&#39;s) definition.\n&gt;&gt; Could the bar *be* any lower?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If China, with its hundreds of millions of internet users, decides\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that it can&#39;t be bothered to register a media type with IANA, yet it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; could easily be that *every* relevant Chinese client of that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; media-type might readily understand it.  That sounds like a feature\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the internet, not a bug.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have no problem with that.  However, in _reality_ there is no\n&gt;&gt; alternate registry to IANA, not here, not in China, not anywhere on the\n&gt;&gt; planet.  So discussions about theoretical alternatives to IANA are just\n&gt;&gt; that -- theoretical.  On the Web, today, there exists only the IANA\n&gt;&gt; registry, therefore there is no other means to meet Roy&#39;s requirement:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sure, if the Chinese alternative to IANA comes along, it would be a\n&gt;&gt; legitimate registry for meeting the self-descriptiveness constraint.\n&gt;&gt; But, here&#39;s a list of *actual* registries which *exist* today on the\n&gt;&gt; Web:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; IANA\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sure, alternatives are possible, but pragmatically, that&#39;s _all_ there\n&gt;&gt; is.  Even if there were some other registry, the wording of RFC 2616\n&gt;&gt; would still &quot;discourage&quot; its use.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I also like to think that REST make sense to think about in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; context of enterprise software.  So to me, the question is,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;self-describing, but for what scope?&quot;  Maybe this is a small scope,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such as the software my company writes, and all of our customers.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet, my company can then get the benefits of following a RESTful\n&gt;&gt;&gt; architecture.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re sending HTTP over the Internet, then potential participants\n&gt;&gt; in the communication include folks beyond your or your partners&#39;\n&gt;&gt; organizational boundary.  If your identifier is opaque, then these\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries can&#39;t be participants, but merely dumb routers, which is\n&gt;&gt; the result we&#39;re presumably trying to avoid by using REST in the first\n&gt;&gt; place.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, can anyone come back with a solid, convincing argument that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is not the case?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, the above did that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Not even close.  You&#39;ve failed to do anything but speculate that maybe\n&gt;&gt; some alternative registry will emerge.  A valid point, but moot, since\n&gt;&gt; no such alternative _has_ emerged.  Therefore, in order to meet Roy&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; requirement for self-descriptiveness:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There exist, on the Web, exactly ZERO legitimate alternatives to the\n&gt;&gt; IANA registry, in practice.  Where else are media type identifiers\n&gt;&gt; registered for anyone to look up their associated standards?  Nowhere,\n&gt;&gt; severely restricting the options for meeting the constraint, in\n&gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; To that end, I see REST as an aspirational endpoint.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I say that myself, all the time.  However:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not going to deny fellow architects the label of &quot;REST&quot; if, for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; example, they got everything right, but used a few non-standard-IANA-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registered media-types for a few small portions of their application.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If there&#39;s no intent to standardize a type or register an identifier,\n&gt;&gt; then there&#39;s no effort being made at self-descriptiveness.  This isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; just a mismatch, this is actively thwarting the goals of REST.  Using\n&gt;&gt; an unregistered identifier for an unstandardized type is only congruous\n&gt;&gt; with REST if there is an intent to change that situation -- what I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; arguing against here is the refusal to admit there&#39;s even a problem.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Some pages have links to other pages, and some pages might be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; endpoints (with merely incidental links, like &quot;back&quot;).  I suggest\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that in a RESTful world, the pages that link to other pages should\n&gt;&gt;&gt; strongly favor standardized (and registered) media types.  When you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; get to the &quot;endpoint&quot; pages that don&#39;t contribute to the hypertext\n&gt;&gt;&gt; state of an application (PDF, Flash, video), then the media type is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; much more wide open, and it should be.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; No, REST says nothing about self-descriptiveness being optional, or\n&gt;&gt; more important / less important based on resource type.  Self-\n&gt;&gt; descriptive messaging is a constraint, and those who choose to ignore\n&gt;&gt; this _fact_ simply are not following the REST style, and should not\n&gt;&gt; call their results REST.  I am opposed to attaching the REST label\n&gt;&gt; where no effort is being made to follow the style.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, any good developer should reuse what is already available,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and appropriate.  On the other hand, given a hammer, don&#39;t turn\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything into a nail.  Figuring out when to make a new media type,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and when to reuse an existing one might actually be an extremely\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult call.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 100% agreed.  My argument is against the cavalier usage of unregistered,\n&gt;&gt; unstandardized types without any mention whatsoever, and outright\n&gt;&gt; denial of the existence, of any constraint issues or tradeoffs\n&gt;&gt; associated with the practice.  The bar to registering an identifier is\n&gt;&gt; purposefully low, yet folks act like it&#39;s an insurmountable obstacle,\n&gt;&gt; then pretend it isn&#39;t required.
