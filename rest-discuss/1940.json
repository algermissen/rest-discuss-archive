The problem, said\n&gt; Box, is that the intermediaries--that is, the companies that own the\nrouters\n&gt; and cables between the client and server--will not allow single\ntransactions\n&gt; that take this long.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What exactly is it about the intermediaries that wouldn&#39;t allow for a long\n&gt; transaction time?\n&gt;\nDonB is mixing application-level transaction and network-socket-level\nconnection.\nThe problem mentioned with intermediaries refers to network socket level\nconnections.\n\nThis whole issue comes up when you map application-level concepts of request\nand response to protocol level concepts of request and response.\nIt becomes worse when you try to do /generic/ requests on top of HTTP which\nhas specific semantics for each of its request message types.\n\nLong-lived application transactions are definitely doable with HTTP - wish\nlists on shopping sites for example - all you have to do is try, and DonB\nisn&#39;t willing to do that.\n\n\n\n"}}
