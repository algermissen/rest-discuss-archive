Eg: http://api.django-=\r\nrest-framework.org\n&gt; * Encourages good REST-over-HTTP design - you&#39;d have t=\r\no really try hard to build an API with the framework that wasn&#39;t self-descr=\r\nibing and well-connected.\n&gt; * Architecturally I think it&#39;s a pretty solid e=\r\nffort - it tries to go with the Django grain wherever possible.  (Although =\r\nI guess that aspect might be outside the scope of this particular forum.)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The browse-able API is definitely the aspect I&#39;m most pleased with, it =\r\nsupports full GET/PUT/POST/DELETE on resources, and works nicely both for g=\r\neneric resources, and for resources that are tied to forms and/or models.  =\r\nFor example:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://api.django-rest-framework.org/object-store/  (Gene=\r\nric resource)\n&gt; http://api.django-rest-framework.org/pygments/  (Resource t=\r\nied to a Django form)\n&gt; http://api.django-rest-framework.org/blog-post/  (R=\r\nesource tied to a Django model)\n&gt; \n&gt; The 0.1 release went out last week, so=\r\n obviously I still have lots of work I&#39;d like to do.  HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PA=\r\nTCH, work on authentication & permissions, encouraging hyper-linked resourc=\r\nes over nested resource representations, good caching support and a stack o=\r\nf others all spring to mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some areas I&#39;d appreciate input on would =\r\nbe...\n&gt; \n&gt; * What do you think I&#39;ve gotten right or wrong in the design?\n&gt; =\r\n* What are your thoughts on the admin-style browse-able API, which other fr=\r\nameworks do something similar and how does it compare?\n&gt; * What do you thin=\r\nk I should consider as priorities in further releases?\n&gt; * How can I furthe=\r\nr encourage good REST-over-HTTP design with the framework?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any and all=\r\n thoughts would be most welcome!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
