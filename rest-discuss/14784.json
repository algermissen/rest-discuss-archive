From the message you quoted:\n&gt; Hypermedia means the placement of controls within the \n&gt; presentation of information \n&gt; If the links and controls aren&#39;t in the data communicated at runtime, then I think it&#39;s a stretch to call it &quot;hypermedia&quot;.\n&gt; If I got it right, the API in question uses hypermedia to represent state transitions that were agreed upon a priori by both server and consumers.\n\nYes, that is what I mean.\nI know it is not really correct to put it that way, but it occurred to me that a description of the available URIs at design time is in some sense similar to such a description at run time. It is &#39;just&#39; the amount of design time coupling induced that differs.\n\nConsider WADL at runtime (which is RESTful[1] because you can consider it a form) vs. WADL at design time.\n\nIf we manage to make designers of 3/4 APIs aware of the coupling they introduce and show them the tradeoffs involved, that would be beneficial in many ways:\n\n- clear up the confusion in general\n- emphazise what RESTfulness means\n- educate how coupled 3/4 systems actually are\n- provide a ground for analyzing the tradeoffs of 3/4 systems, e.g. I might\n  choose not to go through the &#39;pain&#39; of the media type design and maintenance\n  and instead put my resources in place, descipe the URIs and payloads\n  and ready is my service. As long as I make *very* clear that there is\n  a lot of coupling going on and that I effectively cannot change my service\n  without consulting the client owner the resukt will be a manageable system.\n  For some situations, the very short time to production and benefits in\n  &#39;debugability&#39; make 3/4 systems far superior to any form of RPC.\n  Just be sure you do not think it is REST.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the difference here is that if such state transitions were made through resource handling on the http level, using well known and accepted relation types, you server has published a resource that can be used by clients that did not need to write specific code to deal with it.\n&gt; So, hypermedia is there, its just that the client is consuming it in a less-but-still-early-binding fashion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan, is that the case?\n\nHmm, sorry - I did not get the essence of your point.
