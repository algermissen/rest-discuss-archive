With SOAP/WSDL you are =\r\ngiven \n&gt; everything up front and have to figure out what to use when. With =\r\nREST you \n&gt; are only served the links that fits the actual state. You canno=\r\nt do the last \n&gt; with WSDL.\n\nWell, yes, you can. At least with WSDL (let&#39;s =\r\nforget SOAP). WSDL is a web format, registered in IANA, and I can get it dy=\r\nnamically and consume it dynamically. Nobody does it because of tools, gran=\r\nted. The shame is on the tool designers.\n\n&gt; I guess that depends on how you=\r\n consume the XForm. \n\nTotally true. Knowing the XFORM up front will make yo=\r\nu write a rigid client. Same for WSDL. Consuming the XFORM dynamically will=\r\n make everybody happy. It is harder with WSDL, but possible too.\nHere the r=\r\neal difference is then the actual implementation, plus, I would say, XFORM =\r\nis still light, and WSDL we may label it as &quot;heavy&quot;.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Mart=\r\ninez Pomares.\n\n\n"}}
