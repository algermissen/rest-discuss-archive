POST(p),\n&gt;&gt; as &quot;process this&quot;, doesn&#39;t even have that minor visibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was under the impression that the degree of visibility in both cases\n&gt; was identical, since the client has just as much trouble anticipating\n&gt; the state of the resources as the intermediary.\n\nThey are effectively the same, yes, but visibility is a continuous \nfunction.\nJust knowing something about the intent of the client may be better \nthan nothing.\n\n&gt; What I think you&#39;re\n&gt; talking about there - please correct me if I&#39;m mistaken - is the amount\n&gt; of information that can be extracted from a message.  But I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; personally call that amount of information &quot;visibility&quot; in the section \n&gt; 2\n&gt; of your dissertation sense-of-the-word, since to do so, it seems, would\n&gt; be akin to suggesting that &quot;getStockQuote&quot; is more visible than GET\n&gt; simply because it&#39;s more specific, i.e. is equivalent to the GET\n&gt; semantic plus the expected type of the data (a stock quote).\n\nThere are many variables involved in determining visibility, not just\nthe self-descriptiveness of the message.  For example, simplicity and\nvisibility are intertwined: being very specific, to the point of \ndescribing\nall possible details, will reduce visibility regardless of how \ndescriptive\nthe message becomes -- the additional information becomes noise.\nMaking the method data-specific, as in your example, creates complexity\nbecause the expected types of data in an open system are potentially \ninfinite,\nbut it is only when the system as a whole is considered that we find the\ntrade-off unacceptable.\n\nI keep feeling that there should be an easier way to describe this stuff\nso that the constraints follow from the design goals of the Web.  The \nproblem\nis that the design encompasses a number of independent factors that \nbecome\na feedback loop, with the goal of that loop being continual growth of \nthe\nWeb itself (i.e., more information being linked-in).  For example, the \nmain\nreason that getStockQuote is evil, far more so than the issue of \nvisibility\ndescribed above, is because then a URI alone would not be sufficient to\nto identify the resource, which would mean the resource could not be\nlinked-in with the rest of the Web, which would mean the Web loses that\npotential for growth and we all lose because the value of the Web to\neach user is influenced by Metcalfe&#39;s Law.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
