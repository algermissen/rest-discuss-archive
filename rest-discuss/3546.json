The very act of naming it means I have a representation.\n&gt; &quot;Your retirement&quot;, for instance, still has a representation.  In this case\n&gt; it may be &quot;what it will be like&quot; or &quot;never get around to having one&quot; (or\n&gt; whatever your represtentation of it currently is).  I bet you can&#39;t talk\nor\n&gt; even think of your retirement without conjuring up a single representation\n&gt; of it.  I know I can&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believe this, in essence, is what Roy Fielding meant when he\n&gt; &gt; said [somewhere] &quot;resources always exist&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And why not?  You have a concept, no current way to express\n&gt; &gt; (represent) it, but you still have name(s) for it.  For example,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;my retirement&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How can you DELETE the representation-to-resource mapping and still\nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the identifier-to-resource mapping exist?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
