That mapping may be\n&gt; as abstract as &quot;the Apple Store&quot; or as concrete as a single apple that\n&gt; was at one time in a box at the Apple Store.  A resource is largely\n&gt; defined by what you make of it.\nMapping? From my minimal maths, I think of mappings from\nX to Y? How (if at all) do the range of resources in your examples\nrelate to mappings please? Is there a source & destination?\n\n\n&lt;snip/&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But knowing what the &quot;resource&quot; is does not teach much about REST,\nFrom the above examples I&#39;m glad of that :-)\n&gt; since REST is designed to hide that information from clients.\n\n\n\n&gt; Lots of people complain about the definition, largely because\n&gt; it seems so nebulous and effectively anything could be a resource.\n\nI could support that. You seem purposely to emphasise the\nabstract nature of resources. Is that primarily to emphasise\nthe hiding of ...[information or resources] by an RESTful architecture?\n\n&gt; What they don&#39;t understand is that allowing anything to be a resource\n&gt; is the goal, and REST describes how to build an architecture that\n&gt; can effectively manipulate anything even when the client has no\n&gt; idea what that thing actually may be.  That&#39;s the point.\n\nDoes the software ideas of decoupling/data hiding have any place in such\na description? That&#39;s what it sounds like to me.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If an application can accomplish the user&#39;s need of today in a\n&gt; way that is reusable by others, and without revealing much of\n&gt; anything about how it works, then there is a good chance that\n&gt; the implementation of how it works can evolve independently of\n&gt; the user and also that how the user makes use of that work can\n&gt; evolve independently from what was anticipated by the resource\n&gt; owner.\nAgain very much aligned with the ideas of data hiding? A consistant\ninterface enables design change on either side without impact\non the application.\n\n\nThose are two of the goals of REST: independent evolvability\n&gt; and design-for-serendipity.\n\n:-) Design for serendipity (what-if programming?) tends to be expensive IMHO,\nthough  still a nice goal.\n\nThe evolvability is the benefit I find most attractive.\n\n\n\n There are other goals (e.g., scalability).\n\n\nI do wish you&#39;d do more of this plain English explanatory stuff Roy.\n\nVery much appreciated.\n\nregards\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
