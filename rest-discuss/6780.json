Just grok uniform methods.  Most of my unlearning\nwas of distributed objects using MOM, EDI and distributed\ntransactions.  Even there, I find a lot still applies, but I do need\nto think about all of them differently, including OOP.\n\n&gt; This idea of &quot;unlearning&quot; or &quot;getting it&quot; bugs me a bit, it\n&gt; makes a slice of software engineering sound like mysticism, or worse,\n&gt; mathematical insight.\n\nSo why do so many experienced people report &quot;aha&quot; moments where they\ndidn&#39;t get REST and then they did?\n\nE.g.\nhttp://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/002801.html\n\nI spent many saloon hours in WS-* circles arguing for REST with people\nwho really knew MOM, EDI and/or distributed transactions.  Once in\nawhile somebody got it, but always only after a long time thinking\nabout it. I never saw anybody who was deep in a different architecture\nget it right away.\n\nThat&#39;s no mysticism, that&#39;s how minds work.\n\n"}}
