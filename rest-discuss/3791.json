First, the URL is way to long to\n&gt; &gt;have to type in.  Second, it requires me to know/remember the URI of my\n&gt; &gt;&quot;access&quot; resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I would worry too much about the URI being too long.  No\n&gt; matter what the length, the user will probably just bookmark it anyway.\n\nYes, but bookmarks aren&#39;t very portable.  If you sit down at any other\nbrowser, your SOL.  Bookmarks should be a convenience, not a solution.\n\n&gt; &gt;2) Instead, one could use just the RNA Address\n&gt; &gt;(http://example.com/rna/seairth) and the client would auto-append the\n&gt; &gt;&quot;access&quot; bit.  If the server returned a 404, it could then try other\n&gt; &gt;possibilities, effectively hunting for the interface.  This solution is\nnot\n&gt; &gt;very flexible, since all it would take is a particular inplementation to\n&gt; &gt;change the path slightly (e.g. &quot;client-access&quot;) in order for the client\nto\n&gt; &gt;fail discovery.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why bother with the hunting part?  For the sake of interop, just require\n&gt; that the access page is the rna address with /access appended. Once\n&gt; enough implementations do it that way, any implementation that does it\n&gt; differently will be considered broken.\n\nTo my knowledge, it&#39;s bad form to &quot;force&quot; a specific URI naming convention.\nFor example, look at the conversations on the www-tag concerning\n&quot;favicon.ico&quot;, &quot;robots.txt&quot;, and &quot;p3p&quot; a couple months ago.\n\n&gt; &gt;4) Double up the access URI and the RNA address.  Since the only purpose\nof\n&gt; &gt;the access URI is to return an xml document, it would be possible to use\n&gt; &gt;conneg on a GET of the RNA Address.  This way, a user would only have to\n&gt; &gt;know their own RNA Address (which they would anyhow).  This could be\ncoupled\n&gt; &gt;with #3 above, where the coookie bit would only be a convenience.  The\ndown\n&gt; &gt;side is that I&#39;m not too crazy about overloading the RNA Address like\nthis\n&gt; &gt;(purely from a technical POV; I think end-users would be oblivious and\n&gt; &gt;therefore fine with it).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s the hangup.  Actually, the only problems I can think of are\n&gt; semantic, not technical - in one case the URI identifies a user, in the\n&gt; other, the URI identifies the user&#39;s access page.  Given recent\n&gt; discussion on the TAG list, this might not be the &#39;purest&#39; way to do\n&gt; things, but it sure seems practical.\n\nI agree.  One could probably restate it so that it sounded kosher, but it\nstill doesn&#39;t feel right somehow...\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;5) Move the client to be under the RNA Address, effectively replacing the\n&gt; &gt;&quot;access URI&quot;.  Through conneg, it would still be possible to return the\n&gt; &gt;original XML document from the client URI so that &quot;thick&quot; clients could\n&gt; &gt;still have access.  The main advantage here is that the URI would be\n&gt; &gt;memorable (e.g. http://example.com/rna/seairth/client).  However, it\nseems\n&gt; &gt;somewhat like overkill to pass entire URIs in the query string, esp.\nsince\n&gt; &gt;it would be unlikely that you would use the client to access any RNA\naddress\n&gt; &gt;other than the one it was under.  On the other hand, I could be wrong\nhere.\n&gt; &gt;For instance, this would allow one to customize the look-and-feel of the\n&gt; &gt;client program, then access other RNA Addresses while continuing to keep\n&gt; &gt;that look-and-feel.  When accessing another site, you would have to use\n&gt; &gt;something akin to the original syntax (e.g.\n&gt; &gt;http://example.com/rna/seairth/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob),\nbut\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s probably fine at that point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob\n&gt; when you&#39;re on a different server?\n&gt;\n&gt; Why does bob need to know about seairth (or seairth&#39;s rna address)?\n\nNormally, bob wouldn&#39;t need to know about seairth&#39;s RNA address.  bob would\nlikely access http://example.com/rna/bob/client.  However, I have multiple\nidentities: personal, work, etc.  In each of those cases, I may have a\nseparate RNA Address.  I may have full control over my personal address and\nclient, and therefore may customize it in various ways.  When accessing my\nwork address, I *could* use the client at that address, but I could also use\nthe client at my personal address which has my personal customizations.\n\nBut this does bring up another interesting issue.  It would be possible to\nuse any web client to access any RNA Address.  As a result, I could use your\nclient to access my address.  Now, I don&#39;t know *why* I would want to do\nsuch a thing, esp. since I would be giving you the oportunity to discover my\nauth-info.  But it is possible.  Of course, it would also be possible to\njust disable the feature that would allow such a thing.  For most people,\nthis would likely be the prefered setting.  Another possbility to would be\nto require independent authentication for use of the client.  In most cases,\nthe authentication info would be the same as for the associated RNA Address\nitself.  However, in the case where a second address is accessed (e.g.\nwork), it would probably be necessary to maintain a separate profile with\nseparate authentication information so that the client could properly access\nthe remote RNA Address.  This way, only addresses specified in profiles\nwould be accessible.\n\nAnd a final thought (for now)...  If one really wanted to set up a server to\nuse a format like\n\n&gt; http://example.com/rna/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob\n\nThis could be done with a redirection.  All bob would have to remember is\nhttp://example.com/rna/bob/client.  Upon typing that in, he would be\nredirected to the extended version.  This makes it easy for him to remember\nwhile still allowing flexibility in the way that the client is implemented.\n\n&gt; I think any of the above would probably work out just fine (although I\n&gt; really dont like 3).\n\nThe more I think about it, the more #5 seems like the way to go.\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
