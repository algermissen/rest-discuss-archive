I don&#39;t see why PUT has to mean &quot;place this representation \nhere&quot; when it could mean &quot;use this representation to update this resource&quot;.\n\nPaul\n\nDonald_Strong@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Paul,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t get why PUT is more &quot;dangerous&quot; than POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t say it was more dangerous, I said it was more\n&gt; difficult to get right.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Surely the difference between a POST and a PUT\n&gt; &gt; request is purely one of semantics and has no\n&gt; &gt; affect on the processing the server can do.\n&gt;\n&gt; The semantics are the issue here. With a PUT you\n&gt; must replace the entire state of the resource,\n&gt; even those bits you should not be changing.\n&gt; Consequently, the processing on the server must\n&gt; determine what has changed and then apply business\n&gt; rules to those properties that have changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a POST you can ask for specific properties\n&gt; to be modified.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t see how in your example the server would\n&gt; &gt; have any more problems constraining a client\n&gt; &gt; PUTting a new customer order over one POSTing\n&gt; &gt; one, after all the only difference is the word\n&gt; &gt; PUT rather than POST in the HTTP request, the\n&gt; &gt; same server logic can apply to both.\n&gt;\n&gt; The client should POST a new customer order,\n&gt; unless you want your external clients determining\n&gt; the names of your resources. After that, the\n&gt; client could PUT replacements of that order\n&gt; or POST ammendments to the order.\n&gt;\n&gt; I contend that the latter is easier to\n&gt; implement and manage. Then again, maybe I&#39;m\n&gt; just lazy.     B^)\n&gt;\n&gt; Donald.\n\n\n\n"}}
