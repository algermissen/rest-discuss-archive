Don&#39;t get me  \nwrong -- their REST-like API is a big improvement over their SOAP- \nstyle API, but I just don&#39;t consider it a paragon of REST.\n\nI don&#39;t blame them at all -- I&#39;m merely trying to figure out how to  \ndo it better, which isn&#39;t easy.\n\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to build an automatically-generated GUI client that would  \n&gt;&gt; be able\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; query, browse, and display anything accessible from their datastore.\n&gt; There is a wildly varying set of data maintained within various Amazon\n&gt; systems, and even if by some miracle every data service took the  \n&gt; trouble to\n&gt; highlight and markup every potential reference to resources from  \n&gt; other data\n&gt; services at Amazon (hyperlinks),\n\nI don&#39;t think so.  I spent some time working through their API  \ndocument, and it doesn&#39;t really seem all that complicated.  Or at  \nleast, it doesn&#39;t *have* to be.\n\n&gt;  there is a huge problem of what a meaningful display for this data  \n&gt; would be.\n\nWhy?   Display is a user-agent problem.  I&#39;d be willing to bet that  \nat least 80% of the data on web is (implicitly) structured as either  \na list, a dictionary, or a table -- everything else is just formatting.\n\n&gt; And on top of that there are\n&gt; various interactions that a human would want to do with that data  \n&gt; that would\n&gt; require such deep knowledge of the purpose of the data that an  \n&gt; automated GUI\n&gt; sounds like a pipe dream.\n\nRemember, the goal is to provide power by keeping things *simple*.    \nIf you buy the REST idea that there are only four verbs, then  \neverything else becomes a small set of nouns and list of a valid  \nattributes.  Also, the goal is NOT to ensure everything is browseable  \n-- just provide the blank forms so it can be queried.\n\nLet me put it this way: if I understand it correctly, REST is just  \ntreating the web as a database.  That was the magic of Roy&#39;s thesis  \n-- he proved you could do anything you want by keeping the back-end  \nsimple, and let the client add complexity if it wants.  Isn&#39;t that  \nright?\n\nWe&#39;ve already proved that it is trivial to write basic tools for  \nautomating database UIs by reverse-engineering the schema.  Why  \nshouldn&#39;t that work for REST web services?\n\n&gt; If all you want is a read-only display, then like someone said -  \n&gt; your Web\n&gt; browser already does that.\n\nHeck, my web browser does read-write, so that should be trivial too,  \nright? :-)\n\n-- Ernie P.\n------------\nErnest N.
