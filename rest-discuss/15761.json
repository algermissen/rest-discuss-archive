Part of the discussion comes down to finding RESTful idioms, standards, and/or tools to apply to certain recurring enterprise integration problems.\n\nSpecifically, we are trying to find RESTful solutions to:\n\n1) Guaranteed Delivery - we need a paradigm to follow so that one service can transfer a sequence of resource representations to another reliably even though both services and the network suffer temporary unreliability\n\n2) Distributed Transactions - we need a paradigm to allow state changes on multiple services to happen so that the changes succeed or fail as a unit\n\n3) Long running operations - we need asynchronous invocations between services and a mechanism for the invoking service to find out when the invoked service is done given that this work may take indefinitely long\n\n4) Workflow Orchestration - we would like to have orchestration services that define business processes via standardized representations (eg BPMN), then execute instances of those processes and build up an process instance execution data resource by interacting with other RESTful resources using message exchange patterns that could specify the above behaviors.\n\nI&#39;m sure that some of these topics have been discussed to death. I&#39;m not looking to repeat the details in one thread, but just wondering if people can give me quick dump of the conventional wisdom as to how to approach such problems, and/or point me to solutions (or alternatives) that they consider consistent with RESTful approaches.\n\nI found the Rest-* effort at http://www.jboss.org/reststar . The name of this project tweaks me, but some of the specs under it seem relevant. Are there others? Are these problems that the community sees value in solving through standards and tooling?\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
