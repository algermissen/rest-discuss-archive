Assume we have a\nResource R.  R can transition through a number of states.  Let&#39;s say the\nstates are S1, S2, S3, and S4.  Outside clients can only directly initiate\ntransitions from S1 to S4 and from S4 to S1.   As a result of initiating a\ntransition from S1 to S4, R will pass through S2 on the way to S4.  As a\nresult of initiating a transition from S4 to S1, R will pass through S3 on\nthe way to S1.  A client can sample R at any time and see the state of R in\nany of the states S1, S2, S3, and S4.  \n\n\tWithout being RPCish, I&#39;m having a difficult time imagining how to\nstructure URIs that allow a client to transition R from S1 to S4 and S4 to\nS1.  For example I could imagine a GET to R returning something like:\n\n\t&lt;R&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;State&gt;S1&lt;/State&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/R&gt;\n\n\tI can imagine a client performing a PUT to R/State, changing its\nvalue to S4.  This doesn&#39;t feel right because a subsequent GET might result\nin the client seeing &lt;State&gt;S2&lt;/State&gt;.  This might be confusing as the PUT\nreturned good status, yet the client doesn&#39;t see S4 in the State element.\n\n\tThis also doesn&#39;t feel right from the POV of &quot;Hypermedia being the\nengine of application state&quot;.  There&#39;s nothing in the representation that\n_guides_ the client to a URI for initiating a _valid_ state change.  For\nexample, there&#39;s nothing that says to the client that the only valid thing\nyou can do to R at this point is initiate a transition to S4.  \n\n\tWhat kind of makes sense is a Get to R returning something like:\n\n\t\t&lt;R&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;State&gt;S1&lt;/State&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;TransitionUri&gt;R/S4&lt;/TransitionUri&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/R&gt;\n\n\t\tA client can then perform an &quot;empty&quot; PUT to R/S4.  A Get of\nR might then look like:\n\n\t&lt;R&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;State&gt;S2&lt;/State&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/R&gt;\n\n\t\tHere, there is no TransitionUri element because no external\ntransition capability exists while R is in S2.  Upon reaching S4, a Get of R\nmight look like:\n\n\t&lt;R&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;State&gt;S4&lt;/State&gt;\n\n\t   &lt;TransitionUri&gt;R/S1&lt;/TransitionUri&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/R&gt;\n\n\t\tIs this on-track, or is there yet a &quot;better&quot; representation\nand URI structure?\n\n\tThanks.\n\n\t \n\n\n\n"}}
