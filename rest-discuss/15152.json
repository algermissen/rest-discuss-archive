He writes:\n\n&quot;A data view of an architecture reveals the application state as information flows through the components. Since REST is specifically targeted at distributed information systems, it views an application as a cohesive structure of information and control alternatives through which a user can perform a desired task. For example, looking-up a word in an on-line dictionary is one application, as is touring through a virtual museum, or reviewing a set of class notes to study for an exam. Each application defines goals for the underlying system, against which the system&#39;s performance can be measured.&quot;\n\nThinking through this (and the following paragraphs) I get the impression that a specific application is &#39;created&#39; only when a user[2] chooses a goal it intends to pursue and turns to the RESTful system (the Web) to start pursuing it. The application thereby brought to life might span several, unrelated &#39;services&#39;.\n\nAnother way one might say this is &#39;The application is defined by the current use of the system (the Web) for the given user intention&#39; (and the current application state is &quot;defined by its pending requests, the topology of connected components (some of which may be filtering buffered data), the active requests on those connectors, the data flow of representations in response to those requests, and the processing of those representations as they are received by the user agent.&quot;[1]\n\nIf that understanding makes sense at all, it has the consequence, that application design is actually done on the client side and *not* on the server side.\n\nIn the context of machine clients this would mean that applications are defined by the client side developer&#39;s interpretations of and assumptions about the envisioned media types (and link relations) and rules for choosing transitions.\n\n\nComments most welcome...\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_3_3\n\n[2] &#39;User&#39; in this context would be a human user or someone who prepares (codes or configures) a client component to persue a certain goal\n\n\n\n\n"}}
