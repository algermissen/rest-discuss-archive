I was working on something similar a few months ago\nbut lost momentum on it. Here&#39;s the thoughts that I had while reading your\nproposal.\n\nCan we see a full WRDL document as an example? An XML Schema would be nice,\ntoo.\n\nWill there be a way to bind URIs to resourceTypes in WRDL? Or are you not\ngoing down the route to avoid what WSDL has become? I can definitely see the\nbenefits to NOT hardcoding a specific WRDL file to one set of URIs.\n\nIs WRDL strictly limited to sending and receving XML documents? I can\nunderstand reducing scope if it is. However, it might be very useful to\nallow for form-data inputs. I&#39;d like to be able to do a GET on a resource\nthat returns an HTML form so that I could do a POST interactively or (using\nWRDL) programmatically. Of course, if I was using WRDL, I wouldn&#39;t need to\nGET the resource for the HTML form.\n\nFor uniformity, extra headers, query parameters, and form-data variables (if\nsupported) should always be allowed.\n\nShould we leverage XML Schema datatypes for the types of inputs? Do types\ndefault to strings if unspecified?\n\nNot all languages support default values for parameters. Do we really need\ndefault and fixed? If it&#39;s fixed, why would it be an input? XML has a case\nfor it but I&#39;m does WRDL?\n\nWill there be a way to define input-sets (like XSLT&#39;s attribute-sets)?\n\n&lt;input-set name=&quot;my-input-set&quot;&gt;\n &lt;query name=&quot;my-int-query&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;\n &lt;header name=&quot;my-string-header type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/input-set&gt;\n\n&lt;method name=&quot;GET&quot;&gt;\n &lt;input use-input-sets=&quot;my-input-set&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/method&gt;\n\nIf we allow something like input-sets, maybe instead of a representations\nattribute on the input element, there should be a body element (as a child\nof input) with a representations attribute just for uniformity.\n\nWill there me any sort of support for modularity? wrdl:include?\n\nYou have a creates attributes on a POST method and also a\ncreated/@representations child element but only mention the creates\nattribute. Is there supposed to be only one of them?\n\nIs it representation or representationType? You have some representationType\nelements with match attributes (instead of test).\n\nShould we be able to specify an XML Schema for a representationType?\n\nI think that you&#39;re trying to do too much with simple binding references.\nWhy not leverage some other specification? I think I would actually prefer\nWRDL to stay simple and not specify any binding mechanism at all. Binding to\nan XML document should be orthogonal to how you received it. Having said\nthat, I have a few comments on references as they are written.\n\nIf reference/@name is optional, how would you refer to it? Your sample API\nlooks like the reference name gets converted into a method name. I think it\nshould be required.\n\nreference/@match should is closer to XSLT&#39;s xsl:value-of/@select attribute\nthan xsl:template/@match. match attributes are restricted to a subset of\nXPath that can only evaluate to node sets.\n\nSpeaking of node sets, what if your reference&#39;s match (or select) attribute\nevaluates a node set? Does it return an array? Only if maxOccurs is greater\nthan 1? These are the types of questions that I believe shouldn&#39;t be\nanswered by WRDL.\n\nShould WRDL support HTTPEvents so that languages that support events can\nseamlessly subscribe to them? Or is that too SOAP-ish?\n\nI hope this helps. I&#39;ll be glad to work on an implementation as it gets\nhammered out.\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
