They seem to be good examples but both seem\nto be a\n&gt; bit specific (=\r\ni.e. not general purpose.) And they don&#39;t really seem to\n&gt; address hypermed=\r\nia (or do they?)\n&gt;  \n\nBoth claim to be quite general purpose: &quot;The Google d=\r\nata APIs (&#39;GData&#39;\nfor short) provide a simple standard protocol for reading=\r\n and writing\ndata on the web.&quot; See http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.=\r\nhtml .\nIn fact, Google seems to be heading toward using the GData API for A=\r\nLL\nfuture Google web services: &quot;There&#39;s a huge move within Google away\nfrom=\r\n SOAP and even REST-style ad hoc APIs and towards GData instead&quot;.\nSee http:=\r\n//www.furl.net/item.jsp?id=3D12879797 . If GData can be used\nfor ALL Google=\r\n APIs, I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty general purpose. It&#39;s already\nbeing used for ser=\r\nvices as diverse as GCalendar and GBase.\n\nAs for &quot;addressing bypermedia&quot;, b=\r\noth address some aspects of\nstandardizing the URIs contained in XML represe=\r\nntations returned from\nHTTP operations--the essence of &quot;hypermedia&quot;.\n\nWhat =\r\nI especially like about GData is it&#39;s focus on even more\nuniformity of inte=\r\nrfaces than &quot;ad hoc REST&quot; interfaces. Rather than\nprovide an &quot;implementatio=\r\nn guide&quot; for designing ad hoc interfaces\nbased on the REST architectural st=\r\nyle, it would be better to help\ndevelopers understand how to reuse an inter=\r\nface &quot;framework&quot; (and I use\nthat term reluctantly &lt;grin&gt;) like Atom or GDat=\r\na.\n\n-- Nick\n\n\n\n"}}
