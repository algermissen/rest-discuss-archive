For cases where clients must always HEAD before doing anything \nelse this isn&#39;t an issue, but for others I think it&#39;s problematic.  \n(What exactly would you do if you got a POST on /users;current?  310?)\n\nI&#39;m still looking for an essential argument one way or another.  In the \nscheme above, the response still varies per user, so you still have to \nworry about cache control and Vary: Authorization, and you add the \nheadache of another network request and complications with PUT/POST/DELETE.\n\nThe alternative would be:\n\nGET /users;current\nAuthorization: (basic: stain:****)\n\n200 OK\nVary: Authorization\nCache-control: private, must-revalidate\n\n....data....\n\nWhich has the following bonuses: (1) Works with all HTTP methods; (2) \nOnly one network request.  What are the minuses, considering that we&#39;re \ndisabling proxy caching anyway?\n\n(Of course, in serious applications using HTTP Basic Auth the whole \nthing will be over TLS and so uncacheable by proxies.)\n\nI&#39;m also trying to articulate the essential distinction between the \nabove and this:\n\nGET /foo\nAccept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7\n\n200 OK\nVary:  Accept-Language\n\n...data...\n\nThat is, is there an essential architectural style issue with a resource \nfor &quot;the current user, whoever that is&quot;?  Or merely practical issues?\n\n-John\n\n"}}
