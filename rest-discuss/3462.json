How do\nyou go about, in a RESTful manner, returning different representations of\nthe same resource when those representations have the same content-type?\nAdmittedly, this is not a common case these days, but I think such a\nscenario will become more frequent.\n\nAs mentioned in a couple posts, a common technique is to use a query string\nto distinquish.  Another technique is to treat the variants as a sort of\nsub-resource.  Both of these techniques have their advantages and\ndisadvantages.  However, the one disadvantage they both have is that they\nare in no way standardized across implementations.  For instance, Jeff Bone,\nJoe Gregorio, and I use different query strings for serving up RSS.\n\nOne of the nice things about MIME types is that they are &quot;standardized&quot;,\nhence the Accept header.  But that is course-grained.  For instance, there\nis no way using Accept: to indicate whether the client wants to receive RSS\n0.91 or RSS 2.0.  Sure, we could register more and more content-types, but\nthat seems like a nightmare (though I gather some work is being done to\naddress such a problem).\n\nSo what is a RESTful app to do?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
