Joe, I think it&#39;s wrong to\nprogram every object in an application as URI-addressable.  Only the ones that\nshould be network-accessible.  And I think Roger&#39;s resource-based classification\nis more suitable to REST than the object-based one, and it better represents\nwhat I have designed into my toolkit.\n\nFor example, in addition to regular HTML content, core resources built into the\ntoolkit are nodes, containers, components, methods, topics, and queues.  I have\nimplemented them as objects, but in essence they are better represented as\nresources.  Since the toolkit is developed in C++, every object has the abiliity\nto subclass from a CObject class, which provides the built-in functionality you\nrefer to below.  It not only implements URI addressability, but also a facility\nfor serializing a snapshot of the state of any resource into an XML stream to be\ntransmitted in response to a GET request.  Combine these features with\nenvironmental acquisition and you&#39;ve got a great development environment to work\nin.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a sales pitch....it will be free for developers, and I hope it helps\nmake REST a better philosophy for programming distributed apps than RPCs.\n\n-Philip\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Roger L.

This is what I was thinking when I\n&gt; suggested that we create a full-blown distributed OOP development\n&gt; environment that supports REST intrinsically.\n\nIsn&#39;t the idea of REST that URIs identify &quot;resources&quot;, i.e., logical\nentities?  Whether the resource is implemented as an object or some\nother form is transparent.  Consequently, the implementation of the\nresource can change without impacting clients.\n\nI don&#39;t really equate &quot;objects&quot; with &quot;logical entities&quot;.  There are many\nways to implement a logical entity without the use of objects, e.g., a\nlogical entitiy could be implemented simply as an XML document, or as\nthe results of a database query.\n\nI see these two statements as being very different:\n\nObject-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**object** is a built-in feature of the system.\n\nResource-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**resource** is a built-in feature of the system.\n\nI agree with the later, but not the former.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
