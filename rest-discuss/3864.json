You now have to provide some mechanism for the client to \ndiscover and understand how to interact with this service (you lose \nvisibility and interoperability).\n\n&gt; POST /your/inbox/\n&gt; message           : send a message ...\n[...]\n&gt; formats can be just mime for messages and a list of plain text\n&gt; &quot;subject : uri &quot; for inbox,\n\nHow should a client know that this is the appropriate way to send a \nmessage?  It certainly violates the syntax your inbox type to append a MIME \nmessage to its end so we can&#39;t discover it that way.  Given the formats you \ndescribe, the obvious way to send a message is to PUT a message at some \narbitrary newURI and then POST only &quot;subject: newURI&quot; to /your/inbox, but, \naccording to your documentation that would be INCORRECT...  Sigh.\n\n&gt; This is a simple service, but it helps to understand.\n&gt; How do you model this in MoST ??\n\nYou don&#39;t, or at least not specifically!  MoST says that server operators \nshould not be defining the meaning of resource interfaces; that these \nresource interfaces should be constrained entirely by their \ncontent-type/schema/format.  Note above how I gave the *obvious* way to \nsend a message from your formats alone.  In practice, the documentation of \nyour simple ReST messaging service would be verbose.  Even your abstract \nhad 9 lines (not including the format description).  Aside from the format \ndescription, MoST requires NO DOCUMENTATION AT ALL.\nJust GET the inbox, its format tells you everything you need to know to \ninteract with it.  If you later switch to an XML inbox, again, you don&#39;t \nneed any new documentation....\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
