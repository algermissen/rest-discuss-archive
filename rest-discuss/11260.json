There is no such thing as an\n&gt; &gt; Article=\r\nResource; only a Resource that acts on the internal\n&gt; &gt; application state o=\r\nn your behalf.\n&gt;\n&gt; Careful with terminology. I will assume you meant resour=\r\nce state\n&gt; here, because Stefan is talking about server implementation; I\n&gt;=\r\n hope you did not *actually* mean the REST meaning of application\n&gt; state.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In which case yes, you are right, the client sends a\n&gt; representation a=\r\nnd the resource then acts on the resource state\n&gt; to reflect that represent=\r\nation. But the server implementation can\n&gt; only map a particular set of sta=\r\ntes for any particular resource.\n&gt; Posting a JPEG to a resource that can on=\r\nly map to one of the\n&gt; states that comprise an article is likely to be usel=\r\ness, because\n&gt; the resource will not be able to deduce which one of the sta=\r\ntes\n&gt; it is able to assume you are asking it to take.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, the shape of=\r\n the space of states that any one resource can\n&gt; map is probably common acr=\r\noss a large number of resources in any\n&gt; given server implementation, but d=\r\nistinct from several other such\n&gt; shapes that the same implementation is al=\r\nso capable of mapping,\n&gt; f.ex. a set of states that can describe an article=\r\n, another set\n&gt; of states that can describe a user, and various sets of sta=\r\ntes\n&gt; that can describe collections of these respective other sets.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eac=\r\nh of these share implementation in the server code.\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is, ca=\r\nn we find a name to express the concept of\n&gt; particular distinct spaces of =\r\nresource states?\n&gt;\n\nThanks :-) This is pretty much what I was looking for. =\r\nI&#39;m not 100%  \nsure, though, whether this is really only server _implementa=\r\ntion_.  \nEven if you don&#39;t know anything about the implementation, all  \n&quot;c=\r\nustomer resources&quot; might share some additional interface aspects  \ndifferen=\r\nt from those of the &quot;article resources&quot;. And in these, in  \nturn, might be =\r\nworth documenting, quite possibly (as Henry suggests)  \nvia their own resou=\r\nrces.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You simply pass it a representation of the desired state, and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the Resource manipulates the internal state to reflect your\n&gt; &gt; reques=\r\nt. Thats what I mean when I say there is no\n&gt; &gt; ArticleResource, because as=\r\n far as the application code goes,\n&gt; &gt; all Resources are identical in type,=\r\n it&#39;s merely the actions an\n&gt; &gt; individual Resource can perform for you tha=\r\nt differ.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is true from the client perspective. Stefan is talking a=\r\nbout\n&gt; the server perspective, where the platonic ideal of resources has\n&gt; =\r\nto map back to some kind of code that actually implements them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The que=\r\nstion is what terms to use when talking about how the\n&gt; sausage is made rat=\r\nher than about how to think of it after it\n&gt; comes out of the factory=85\n&gt;\n=\r\n\nSome clients will know which &quot;kind&quot; of resource they&#39;re interacting  \nwith=\r\n, making some assumptions beyond the fact that they&#39;re dealing  \nwith resou=\r\nrces in general. I&#39;m aware that for this to be RESTful, this  \nwould have t=\r\no be communicated to them via hypermedia - but I have to  \ncome up with thi=\r\ns concept during the design phase.\n\nMaybe this is the root of some misunder=\r\nstandings around this topic:  \nI&#39;m not at all suggesting to dumb down REST =\r\nto static types or classes  \nwith distinct methods, but I feel there&#39;s to t=\r\nalk about those &quot;kind&quot;  \nor &quot;prototype&quot; or &quot;class&quot; things during design.\n\nS=\r\ntefan\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.or=\r\ng/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
