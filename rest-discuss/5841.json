If you send it a GET, what happens?  If you send it a POST,\nwhat happens?  How about PUT?  As long as the service doesn&#39;t go out of\nits way to violate some other constraint (such as GET resulting in a\nmodified resource state), then how it looks shouldn&#39;t matter.\n\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a different beast -- it is a gateway, and it would &quot;look&quot;\n&gt;&gt; more RESTful simply by choosing a different URI syntax, e.g.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   http://myconverter.com/pdf/http://example.com/get_it_here.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, I get it.  If, for example, it always returned the result as:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?result.html\n&gt;\n&gt; That would be non-RESTful (er, unprincipled? :-), because it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; actually create real resource.\n\nYou mean, if it redirected (or gave 202 response with a link) the client\nto a different resource called\n\n    http://myhost.com/convert?result.html\n\nright?  It would still be RESTful.  It just wouldn&#39;t be very useful,\nsince all that identifies is a resource whose state is the most\nrecently completed conversion.  OTOH, if that is the resource that\nyou happen to want (as in, for example, a monitoring app), then maybe\nit is useful enough.\n\nA better way to think of the problem is to work backwards from the\nend result.  What do you want the state of the system to be at the\ncompletion of N requests (potentially parallel, multiple clients)?\n\nHint: A RESTful system progresses from one steady-state to the\nnext, and each such steady-state is both a potential start-state\nand a potential end-state.  I.e., a RESTful system is an unknown\nnumber of components obeying a simple set of rules such that they\nare always either at REST or transitioning from one RESTful\nstate to another RESTful state. Each state can be completely\nunderstood by the representation(s) it contains and the set of\ntransitions that it provides, with the transitions limited to a\nuniform set of actions to be understandable.  The system may be\na complex state diagram, but each user agent is only able to see\none state at a time (the current steady-state) and thus each\nstate is simple and can be analyzed independently.  A user, OTOH,\nis able to create their own transitions at any time (e.g., enter\na URL, select a bookmark, open an editor, etc.).\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
