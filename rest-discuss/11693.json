Maybe this is partly why the\nhttp://restpatterns.org/ wiki hasn&#39;t seen significant acceptance (not\nintended to be a loaded word but another doesn&#39;t jump to mind). The\nother side of the wiki question may be that people regard their blogs\nas the right place to publish stuff that they author.\n\nMaybe there is an ancillary question to my group proposal: How do we\nimprove the experience of REST beginners?\n\nBob Haugan just said:\n\n&quot;Alternatively, people in this list could exercise a little more\nself-discipline when replying to beginners.\n\nOr to each other. Recent threads have gone on forever with circular\narguments about arcana.&quot;\n\nTo me, this drives to the nub of the matter. Is it realistic to expect\nthis group to significantly change it&#39;s modus operandi? Referring back\nto the comments from Mark Baker, I wonder if [rest-discuss] actually\nhosts the discussions originally intended for [rest-advanced]. I\nstrongly suspect that we have historically served beginners very\npoorly and I am not at all sure that this is likely to change (if, for\nno other reason, that there needs to be a home for advanced\ndiscussions).\n\nSo, how do we serve beginners better? I imagine that we all want those\nwho seek to on-board to REST to be facilitated in doing so.\n\nAlan\n\nOn Thu, Dec 4, 2008 at 5:08 PM, Steve Bjorg &lt;steveb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Dec 4, 2008, at 8:58 AM, Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s altogether possible that someone has an idea that meets the\n&gt;&gt; objective better and if so then that is what should be done.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That was one of the reasons why I had started http://restpatterns.org/ .\n&gt;  There were some early contributions, but otherwise I&#39;ve been pretty much\n&gt; the lonely occasional contributor.

Capturing responses\n&gt; and/or blog posts where some individuals have put a lot of effort into and\n&gt; making it easy to find them again and reference them would probably help at\n&gt; lot.
