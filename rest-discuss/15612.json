If the former is the resource and it&#39;s representation\nne=\r\ngotiated through server-driven negotiation, then you&#39;d never see the\nlater,=\r\n more specifically, the later would never be separately\naddressable, and th=\r\ne SHOULD statement would never apply?\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve read web architecture[2]\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nand don&#39;t see the basis for your conclusion that identifying variants\n&gt;&gt; is=\r\n particularly desirable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then refer to REST, where this desirability=\r\n is called the\n&gt; &quot;identification of resources constraint.&quot; =A0If you are de=\r\nveloping REST,\n&gt; then all REST&#39;s constraints are particularly desirable. =\r\n=A0If you are not\n&gt; developing a REST system, then go ahead and violate the=\r\n identification\n&gt; of resources constraint, I won&#39;t stop you. =A0But don&#39;t v=\r\niolate that\n&gt; constraint and call the result REST.\n\nWell, I thought you&#39;d g=\r\nive me some credit:)  Of course, I have, which\nis why I&#39;m having the questi=\r\non.  I haven&#39;t seen in the dissertation\neither where he asserts that each r=\r\nepresentation should have its own\nURI.  I understand this to mean the oppos=\r\nite:\n\n   &quot;Finally, it allows an author to reference the concept rather than=\r\n\nsome singular\n    representation of that concept, thus removing the need t=\r\no change\nall existing links\n    whenever the representation changes (assumi=\r\nng the author used the\nright identifier).&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s where he talked about th=\r\ne benefit of the resource abstraction.\nBy suggesting that every representat=\r\nion should be addressable, it\nseems you break that and I haven&#39;t found wher=\r\ne Roy&#39;s said otherwise.\n\n&gt;&gt; Unless I&#39;ve misinterpreted Roy&#39;s thoughts,\n&gt;&gt; I=\r\n gather he supports the former:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0&quot;If the resource is a concept inde=\r\npendent of\n&gt;&gt; =A0 representation format, then its URI must not have any asp=\r\nect\n&gt;&gt; =A0 that is specific to the representation format.&quot;[3]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy is=\r\n saying, don&#39;t negotiate for a URI ending in *.txt, basically.\n&gt; This doesn=\r\n&#39;t really have anything to do with the topic at hand.\n\nThen I&#39;m really conf=\r\nused, because I think it addresses the topic\nsquarely.  I&#39;ve said that &lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;/weather/22180&quot;&gt; is ideal.  And you\nsay that the best practice is to=\r\n give each variant its own URI, e.g.\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;/weather/22180.html&quot;&gt;.  Tha=\r\nt seems to be the situation that\nJan brought up and what Roy was advising o=\r\nn there?\n\n&gt;&gt; Personally, I see the coupling introduced with a @type attribu=\r\nte as\n&gt;&gt; much less offensive than the coupling (resource&lt;-&gt;representation) =\r\nthat\n&gt;&gt; occurs by having the variants in their own URIs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What coupli=\r\nng is that? =A0Allowing the representation to be a resource in\n&gt; its own ri=\r\nght by assigning it a URI, is decoupling. =A0Only being able to\n&gt; access th=\r\nat representation directly through @type is the coupling that\n&gt; assigning U=\r\nRIs to variants avoids...\n\nI&#39;m trying, just don&#39;t get it.  The dissertation=\r\n goes to great lengths\nto convince us the importance of the distinction bet=\r\nween Resources and\ntheir Representations, and says URIs address Resources. =\r\n I read Roy&#39;s\nmail above to be further clarification that you should only l=\r\nink to a\nspecific representation when &quot;the resource semantics include the\nf=\r\normat.&quot;  To be honest, I have no clue what that quote means:)\n\n&gt;&gt; You asked=\r\n a fair question: what does it break/what&#39;s the downside? =A0I\n&gt;&gt; think it =\r\nbreaks the essential ideal in REST that URIs identify\n&gt;&gt; resources as conce=\r\npts separate from their representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The essential ideas in REST =\r\nare called constraints; following the\n&gt; Identification of Resources constra=\r\nint does not violate any other\n&gt; constraints. =A0Identification of Resource=\r\ns states that any resource you\n&gt; wish to manipulate must first have its own=\r\n URI. =A0If you intend to\n&gt; manipulate variants (or cache them), you must f=\r\nirst identify those\n&gt; variants as resources, otherwise you are breaking thi=\r\ns constraint, as\n&gt; has been pointed out 1000 times on this list as best-pra=\r\nctice.\n\nA &quot;variant&quot; is a specific representation and what I&#39;m missing is wh=\r\nere\nthe dissertation says that representations themselves should be\nresourc=\r\nes - it seems to me that breaks the whole notion of\n&quot;manipulating resources=\r\n through their representation&quot;?  Can you point\nme to the part that says, &quot;y=\r\nou must first identify those variants as\nresources&quot;?\n\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; relat=\r\ning resources together (e.g. linked data), for consistency, it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; importa=\r\nnt to link the concepts together not a specific representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then=\r\n link to negotiated URIs instead of variant URIs. =A0The ability to\n&gt; link =\r\nthe concepts together, not specific representations, is provided\n&gt; by conte=\r\nnt negotiation. =A0Assigning URIs to variants does not negate\n&gt; this abilit=\r\ny.\n\nI thought you were saying that best practice is to link to a specific\nr=\r\nepresentation.  To which, I said it&#39;d create problems when linking\nconcepts=\r\n together.  But here you&#39;re saying the solution is not to link\nto a specifi=\r\nc representation?\n\n&gt;&gt; =A0I think the Cool URIs[4] document makes the case t=\r\noo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quote, please. =A0Cool URIs says nothing about representation vs=\r\n.\n&gt; resource. =A0It discusses the maintenance of URIs once they&#39;ve been\n&gt; a=\r\nssigned, but has nothing to do with this topic.\n\nI gathered the advice abou=\r\nt leaving out file extensions implied - link\nto resources, not their repres=\r\nentation?\n\n&quot;File name extension. This is a very common one. &quot;cgi&quot;, even &quot;.h=\r\ntml&quot;\nis something which will change. You may not be using HTML for that\npag=\r\ne in 20 years time, but you might want today&#39;s links to it to still\nbe vali=\r\nd.
