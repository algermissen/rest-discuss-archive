I was looking for that as it was one of my \nreasons for having similar misgivings in the past and I must have gone \npast it when I re-scanned the RFC after your post.\n\nBack to my old opinion then. Whatever their intentions, they created a \nformat that gives a list of URIs and if that&#39;s all the semantics needed \nit can be used.\n\n&gt; I think it would be ideal for a 300.\n\nI don&#39;t. 300 entails there being possible reasons for the client \npreferring one of the options over the others (or else the server should \nhave just sent the &quot;best&quot; one or even a random one).\n\ntext/uri-list doesn&#39;t have enough semantics to offer a way to make such \na choice.\n\n&gt; 300, 301 and 302 all require the URI the UA is being redirected to \n&gt; inside a Location header.\n\nActually, it&#39;s a SHOULD in these regards, but I can&#39;t see much value in \nnot doing so.\n\n&gt; But RFC 2616 also says &quot;Unless the request \n&gt; method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short \n&gt; hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).&quot;, I wonder what the \n&gt; use case for URI(s) instead of URI is, but if it&#39;s to let the client \n&gt; know about alternative URIs, text/uri-list would be a perfect match even \n&gt; in its constrained usage.\n\nI can&#39;t see much value in multiple URIs either. Note that such an entity \nSHOULD be sent even if there is a single URI, though with most (all?) \nmodern implementations it&#39;s of no value as they will just follow the URI \nin the location header. text/uri-list with a single URI could perhaps be \na way to follow the letter of the RFC in this regard, though I&#39;m not \nsure if it follows the spirit.\n\n\n"}}
