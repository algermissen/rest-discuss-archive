This resonates with the problem Eric wrote about:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n dynamically passing a declarative description of constraints on allowed\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; values for expansion. In your example, you communicate a list of\n&gt; &gt; poss=\r\nible contexts for expansion. A context is a set of value for\n&gt; &gt; performing=\r\n a given expansion. Do I understand correctly? If so, I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; sure why =\r\nyou don&#39;t directly pass to the client a list of URI generated\n&gt; &gt; server-si=\r\nde by expanding the &quot;templates&quot; using the various contexts? I&#39;m\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, =\r\nthat surely *is* an option as I mentioned myself, but if you go \n&gt; this pat=\r\nh, then you don&#39;t need to provide the client with uri-templates \n&gt; nor cont=\r\nexts, and you don&#39;t need anything else then the xhtml we already \n&gt; have...=\r\n\n&gt; So I just assumed you meant this, if not it seemed to make your question=\r\n \n&gt; void?\n\nYes, I need client side expansion, as I want to use URI template=\r\ns to dynamically communicate how to build certain URIs. However, my clients=\r\n are purpose-built programs whose developers will be given some information=\r\ns out of band. For example, I might communicate http://example.com/stockquo=\r\nte/{symbol} dynamically, associated with a given rel value for finding it i=\r\nn a representation, but specify in my service documentation (i.e., out of b=\r\nand) that it must be expanded using a variable named &quot;symbol&quot; whose value m=\r\nust be the stock symbol of the company you want a stock quote for.\n\nSo my m=\r\nain question is what you labeled as &quot;question [1]&quot;: what is the best way to=\r\n embed such an URI template in XHTML.\n\nOne viable option is  creating a spe=\r\ncific &quot;link&quot; element with a rel and hreft attribute, which would give:\n\n&lt;ht=\r\nml xmlns=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:my=3D&quot;http://example.com/my=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;my:link rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/stockquote&quot; h=\r\nreft=3D&quot;http://example.com/stockquote/{symbol}&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nAno=\r\nther idea I have is to use the existing xrd&#39;s link element, which has suppo=\r\nrt for URI templates (xrd is specified at http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xr=\r\nd/v1.0/xrd-1.0.html).\n\nThis would give:\n\n&lt;html xmlns=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1=\r\n999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:xrd=3D&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;bo=\r\ndy&gt;\n        &lt;xrd:link rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/stockquote&quot; template=\r\n=3D&quot;http://example.com/stockquote/{symbol}&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nI&#39;d be =\r\ngrateful for any feedback on these as well as other ideas on how to best us=\r\ne URI templates as hypermedia controls in XHTML.\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n"}}
