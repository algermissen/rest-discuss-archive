By\n&gt; doing the &quot;mashup&quot; on the server, there are more opportunities to\n&gt; optimize the experience in the future (the server can change storage\n&gt; models, object models, re-arrange code, move operations to other\n&gt; servers, etc. all w/o adversely affecting the client).\n\nyou&#39;re talking about feeds here, or their logical equivalent, including \nthe options for embedding or referencing entries, right? you can feed \nthose lists, you know the work we&#39;ve been doing on feeds as query result \nserializations. or am i missing something that you are doing that does \nfit this pattern?\n\n&gt; Also, by setting up an expectation that clients will &quot;get what they\n&gt; need&quot; in a single call, you can lead server implementations down the\n&gt; path of publicizing a resource model that reflects the actual\n&gt; domain-specific needs of the client-server interaction instead of\n&gt; publicizing a resource model based on the server-side data storage or\n&gt; coding object models. This does a better job of separating concerns,\n&gt; too.\n\nso, another question i&#39;ve been pondering is the following: it&#39;s clear to \nme that we must have collection resources that provide aggregate views \nof potentially included resources. but how much control should we give \nthe client over what we return? that impacts cacheability, but for us is \npretty much the only way we can make certain scenarios work. could we \nadd query parameters so that client can control what to include in the \ncollection resource, or can we allow clients to configure &quot;view&quot; \nresources which define these aspects and then are being referred to in \nrequests? these view resources could control things like the following \naspects:\n\n- collection paging, let&#39;s say 20 per page.\n- inlining or linking entry resources\n- included attributes of the entries (we have many many attribiutes per \nresource and most clients only need very few of them)\n\nso what i wondering about is whether our &quot;feed queries&quot; work could be \naugmented with some &quot;feed views&quot; work. i think i would lean towards the \nmodel where the feed view configuration would be a self-describing \nresource itself, but generally speaking, i am wondering whether this is \nthe model you have in mind or have already implemented.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
