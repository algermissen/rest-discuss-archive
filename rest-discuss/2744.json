Anyway, I think\nREST-Mail and REST-Bay are great examples that would help people get it.\n\nI too have been very busy in the last few weeks.  Hence I haven&#39;t made as\nmuch progress as I wanted to when I posted message 2706, but I can promise\nyou that once I release v1.0 of this toolkit, I will move focus to 1)\nresponding to feedback from this group and 2) implementing sample programs.\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
