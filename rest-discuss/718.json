EG, the above aggregator could just as well have been a\n&gt; notification service of the kind we are discussing here.\n\nYes, a third party watcher could be considered a kind of robot that\nwastes resources. But I&#39;m not inclined to worry about it until it\nbecomes a problem. If legals had any say in the design of the Web it\nwouldn&#39;t exist. After all, people are constantly &quot;wasting resources&quot;\ndownloading things they weren&#39;t authorized to download. If the Web was\nnot so damn useful the legals would have shut it down years ago.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
