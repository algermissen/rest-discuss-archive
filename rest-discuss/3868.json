You now have to provide some mechanism for the client to \n&gt; discover and understand how to interact with this service (you lose \n&gt; visibility and interoperability)\n\nbut whatever is your system, you&#39;ll always have to document it, i.e. to\ndescribe formats, etc. You can&#39;t define a data format, and thus a set of\nbehaviours, that will fit any applications needs.... \n\n&gt; &gt; POST /your/inbox/\n&gt; &gt; message           : send a message ...\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; formats can be just mime for messages and a list of plain text\n&gt; &gt; &quot;subject : uri &quot; for inbox,\n&gt; \n&gt; How should a client know that this is the appropriate way to send a \n&gt; message?  It certainly violates the syntax your inbox type to append a MIME \n&gt; message to its end so we can&#39;t discover it that way.  Given the formats you \n&gt; describe, the obvious way to send a message is to PUT a message at some \n&gt; arbitrary newURI and then POST only &quot;subject: newURI&quot; to /your/inbox, but, \n&gt; according to your documentation that would be INCORRECT...  Sigh.\n\nAs long as you know that /inbox/ is a container containing mime\nmessages, posting a mime message to /inbox/ add the message to the\ncontainer... you don&#39;t have to know that (for instance) the server\nactually append the message to an mbox file, if you can GET you message\n(even in text/html) to the url of the Location header and if the GET\n/inbox/ return a list with the &quot;subjet : uri&quot; appended. \n\n&gt; &gt; This is a simple service, but it helps to understand.\n&gt; &gt; How do you model this in MoST ??\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t, or at least not specifically!  MoST says that server operators \n&gt; should not be defining the meaning of resource interfaces; that these \n&gt; resource interfaces should be constrained entirely by their \n&gt; content-type/schema/format.  Note above how I gave the *obvious* way to \n&gt; send a message from your formats alone.  In practice, the documentation of \n&gt; your simple ReST messaging service would be verbose.  Even your abstract \n&gt; had 9 lines (not including the format description).  Aside from the format \n&gt; description, MoST requires NO DOCUMENTATION AT ALL.\n&gt; Just GET the inbox, its format tells you everything you need to know to \n&gt; interact with it.  If you later switch to an XML inbox, again, you don&#39;t \n&gt; need any new documentation....\n&gt; \n\nso describe your format. In this descriptin, i wanted to be unambiguous,\nbut the knowledge that the /inbox/ is a container is suffisant, has I\nknow that i can POST to add a content and GET to obtain the listing (and\ndelete to reset the container)\n\n\n"}}
