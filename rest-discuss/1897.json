I don&#39;t think that this is very often necessary in\n&gt; practice but as long as permission was given explicitly it would be okay\n&gt; with me.\n\nI would think that the HTML FORM element gives us a real-world example of\nthis.\n\nFor example:\n\n&lt;form action=&#39;bizdocs&#39;&gt;\n &lt;input name=&#39;doc-type&#39; /&gt;\n &lt;input name=&#39;doc-id&#39; /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nis enough for todays browsers to construct URIs:\n http://current-domain/bizdocs?doc-type=catalog&doc-id=72\n\nI should be able to use this markup to know how to GET and PUT and DELETE\nthis resource - with the major assumption that the value-space is something\nthe client knows. Mapping value-space between systems - especially across\norganizational boundaries - is another ball of wax that people don&#39;t\nnormally talk about.\n\n&lt;flames-go-here target=&#39;/dev/null&#39; /&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
