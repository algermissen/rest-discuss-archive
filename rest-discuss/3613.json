Obviously, there has to be\n&gt; some sort of information flow between the people and software that\n&gt; use the information and the database that stores the information.\n\n&lt;MKA&gt;\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/Tour/xml_files.html\nSpecific to the screenshot, I thought the application is sending a \nquery/update from browser without &quot;https&quot; over an open channel. My \npoint was, one purpose of UI is to hide complexity (think database), \nbut another purpose is to maintain security, right?\n\nIf that is allowed, then there are a lot of queries one can write \nusing this interface to unlock the underlying database. Added to \nthat, the traffic on the website can be tapped to take a look at the \nqueries.\n&lt;/MKA&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; opens up can of worms from security perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, it does, but it&#39;s not a can of worms that you can avoid.\n&gt; There are security issues whenever you build software. This\n&gt; reality is what makes having a robust security model so important.\n&gt; The web-calculus was built starting from a security model:\n&gt; capability-based security. See:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It allows hackers just the open door access to steal us.\n&gt; \n&gt; This all depends on how good your application security is. If you\n&gt; build your application without any kind of security model, as\n&gt; current web services are, you are indeed building an open door.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main reason the web-calculus is so interesting is that it was\n&gt; built starting from a security model.\n\n&lt;MKA&gt;\nThis security model is based on &quot;http&quot; and doesn&#39;t require &quot;https&quot;? \nPlease clarify, because this is where I think my confusion is.\n&lt;/MKA&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree it may work as an example, but please correct me if this\n&gt; &gt; is indeed used or supposed to be used in real world scenarios.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Waterken RDB Webizer tutorial shows how the tool is meant to\n&gt; be used in real world scenarios. See:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/Tutorial/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As discussed earlier on\n&gt; &gt; service-oriented-architecture@yahoogroups.com, there are bound to \nbe lots\n&gt; &gt; of wrong implementations with SOA (just like we see lots of ill-\ndeveloped\n&gt; &gt; HTML websites, there are bound to be lots of ill-developed XML \nwebsites).\n\n&lt;MKA&gt;\nThat should be service-orientated-architecture@yahoogroups.com. Note \nthe spelling &quot;orientated&quot; instead of &quot;oriented&quot;. (Thank Gervas for \nit.)\n&lt;/MKA&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A great deal of the design effort that went into building the\n&gt; Waterken RDB Webizer was focused on reducing the likelihood of\n&gt; such errors. The tool is designed such that the way developers\n&gt; naturally use it encourages the construction of secure and\n&gt; auditable software. See:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Methodology/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was a proponent of the discussion that database must not be\n&gt; &gt; opened as in the UI above. I&#39;d like to hear thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you link to the specific email, or summarize your argument\n&gt; again here?\n\n&lt;MKA&gt;\nI agree we have to have some access to database. Opening database to \nthe world will only cause misery in terms of more stolen credit \ncards. Hackers could break through security loopholes where there \nwere deemed none, and opening up the database, I thought, just opens \nup the heart of the kill for the attackers. \n&lt;/MKA&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Just want to generate a learning experience. I could be more\n&gt; &gt; wrong than I think.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Great, that&#39;s what a good mailing list is for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyler\n\n\n"}}
