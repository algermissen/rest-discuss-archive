My tutorial guides the reader through the\ncreation of an actual set of Web services.  Things have been proceeding\nfine for all of the services that involve clients getting something\n(i.e., doing an HTTP GET).  I am now at the point where I want to\nprovide a service to allow clients to submit a Purchase Order (PO). \nPresumably, before a client submits a PO he/she \n - gets &quot;something&quot; from the Web service, \n - takes some actions (e.g., fills in a form), and then \n - responds with a completed PO. \nI am stuck on what that &quot;something&quot; should be.  I need your help in\nidentifying what that &quot;something&quot; should be.\n\nA relevant side note: One fundamental doctrine of my tutorial is that\nyou should design for maximum usability of your web services.  That is,\nweb services should be usable both by browser-based clients, and by\nmachine-based clients (i.e., machine-to-machine processing). \nFurthermore, the document that is served up by a Web service should be\nusable by both types of clients.  Thus, I recommend serving up XML\ndocuments containing a stylesheet processing instruction (PI).  Browsers\nwill automatically style the XML using the stylesheet PI (I am gearing\nthis towards the latest versions of the browsers.  I realize earlier\nversions don&#39;t support this).  Machines will simply consume the raw XML.\n\nOkay, back to the Purchase Order.  What resource does a client access\nprior to submitting a PO?  My tutorial says &quot;Step 1. Identify the\nresources you wish to make available&quot;.  Hmm, it is not clear to me what\nthe resource is.  I don&#39;t think that the resource is &quot;PurchaseOrder&quot;. \nThat is what the client is composing.  Clearly the resource is not\n&quot;MakePurchaseOrder&quot; as resources are nouns not verbs.  Perhaps it is\n&quot;PurchaseOrderTemplate&quot;?  I don&#39;t like that but it&#39;s the best that I can\nthink of at the moment.  What do you think the resource is?\n\nLet&#39;s suppose that the resource is &quot;PurchaseOrderTemplate&quot;.  My tutorial\nsays &quot;Step 2. Create a logical URL to the resource&quot;.  I propose this\nURL: (this is a purchase order for a company, parts-depot, which sells\nauto, bicycle, and rollerblade parts)\n\nhttp://www.parts-depot/purchase-order-template\n\nThat seems like a reasonable logical URL.  What do you think?\n\nNow the question is: if a client enters this URL what does he/she get\nback?  Clearly, if the client is sitting at a browser then he/she would\nlike to see an HTML form that can be filled in.  What about the\nmachine-based client, what does it want?  Do we want to send to it an\nempty PO XML document (i.e., tags but no data)?  Do we want to send to\nit a pointer to a DTD/Schema?  Any either case, recall that I want to\nsend the same XML to all clients; with a stylesheet PI for browser\nclients.\n\nThe last step, what the client returns, is easy - a completed PO.\n\nSo, to summarize my questions:\n\n1. What should be the resource in this scenario?\n2. What should be the URL to that resource?\n3. I want to serve up an XML representation of the resource, so that I\ncan be consistent to all clients.  What XML should I serve up?\n\nThanks!  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
