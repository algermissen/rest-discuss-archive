In my head, they are not the same thing.  URI Media Types are just a\n&gt; way to make media type registration distributed, while XML Namespace URIs\n&gt; are used to mix multiple document parts within a single package.  Very\n&gt; different usage to me.\n\nI agree they&#39;re not the same thing, but they are both using an HTTP URI as a unique identifier.\nUsing an HTTP URI as a unique identifier for anything but a web resource\nis fraught with problems:\n\n1. Users will take those URIs and plug them into a browser. What should they get back?\n   (The &quot;what does a namespace uri dereference to is an [xml-dev] permathread.)\n2. How do you compare two URIs? Are they case sensitive? Because some parts of an HTTP\n   URI are not case sensitive while some other parts may be case sensitive. \n   What about escaped characters, \n   i.e. does %42 in the URI get decoded or left as is? (How to compare two URIs \n   is another issue on the tags plate: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#URIEquivalence-15 )\n\nI don&#39;t want to throw cold water on the idea, just pointing out that you&#39;re wandering\ninto some pretty murky waters :)\n\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n"}}
