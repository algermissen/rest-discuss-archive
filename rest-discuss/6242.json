This reduces the amount of shared knowledge between the two\ncomponents in order to make them work together.\n\nIn order to avoid &#39;where&#39; being interpreted as client .vs. server - since I\nbelieve that distinction is an illusion - I think of it as what the change\nis &#39;about&#39;, rather than where the change takes place .\n\n\n\n"}}
