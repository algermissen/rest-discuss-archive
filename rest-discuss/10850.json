On the other hand I don&#39;t see\n&gt;  &gt; how you couldn&#39;t be allowed to have a zero-length entity, which might\n&gt;  &gt; suit what you need.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could have an restful internal right management used by an\n&gt; organisation softwares to check if the user is allowed to do something.\n&gt; This is a bool value: he has the right or not, no other value. If a\n&gt; resource exists (e.g. .../users/jon/rights/addEmployee), the user has\n&gt; the right (to add an employee), otherwise not.\n&gt; To give Jon this right, an admin could PUT (not POST !) to this URI, to\n&gt; remove the right he DELETEs it. No entity is needed.\n&gt; The software GETs or HEADs the URI. If 200 or 204: user has right, if\n&gt; 404: right does not exist, steve is not allowed to add an employee.\n\nThis would certainly work, but in terms of REST, I think this would be \nbetter modelled by exchanging a representation that represents these \nrights, even plain-text such as &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;deny&quot;. The client would really \nhave to know in advance that this particular URI models an access right.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBruno.\n\n"}}
