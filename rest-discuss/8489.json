Each &#39;Buy Me&#39; link could be a POST to a shopping cart\nresource, say, http://example.com/users/alice/shoppingcart, to\nincrementally accumulate purchases by changing shopping cart\nresource&#39;s server-side state each time.\n\nSo, when checking out, you could get the current cart state from the\nserver to present to the user. Then the cart state could be sent back\nto the server so there is no confusion as to which cart state to check\nout: the &#39;current&#39; one which may have changed outside of the user&#39;s\nknowledge, or the one that the user saw.\n\nIf you expect the cart to hold numerous items such that the bandwidth\ncost of shipping the item list back and forth is prohibitive, you\ncould expose the shopping cart as a versioned resource. Then you can\ncheckout a specific version of the cart.\n\n\n&gt; am i right?\n\nWhat should be stateless is the interaction. I like to think of it as\ncontext-less interaction where everything has to be explicitly\nstated. A delete request must state exactly what to delete rather than\nhaving the server assuming the last item looked.\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
