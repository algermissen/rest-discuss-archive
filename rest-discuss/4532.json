I don&#39;t remember reading anything\n&gt; specific covering it in the list archive, so I&#39;m posting it now. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like clarification about how to handle long run back end\n&gt; processes. For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; POST /reportmaker HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Host: foo.com\n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\n&gt; Location: http://foo.com/report/newid\n\nFWIW, RFC 2616 says nothing about Location being used in this way,\nso you&#39;re doing things in a way which isn&#39;t licensed.  On the other\nhand, I think it makes good sense and would have liked it if 2616\ndid define it in this manner.\n\n&gt; ===\n&gt; GET /report/newid HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Host: foo.com\n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; If the report has not been created (work is in progress), what should\n&gt; I return?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are some of my thoughts:\n&gt; 1. A 204 No Content status code doesn&#39;t fit. 204 states that the\n&gt; processing was completed but there is no content, which this is not\n&gt; the case.\n\nNot necessarily.  It might make more sense for you to say that every\nresource under /report/ exists with empty state until such time as it&#39;s\nmodified.  A Wiki could work like this.\n\n&gt; 2. Return a 200 status code, and set the Content-Type header field to\n&gt; something like &quot;application/X-status-message&quot;. The body could be an\n&gt; XML document detailing the status. Upon completion, the proper content\n&gt; and content-type will be returned.\n&gt; 3. Return a 200 and an X-Status header with some in-progress status\n&gt; message.\n&gt; 4. Return a 200 and an X-Status header with no body.\n&gt; 5. A 202 Accepted doesn&#39;t make sense. Using this would imply that\n&gt; server accepted the GET for processing, not the original POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that either 2, 3 or 4 would be the best options (3 and 4\n&gt; are essentially the same). I&#39;m gravitating towards 2.\n\nAnother option is 404, as that would acknowledge that the resource\nhasn&#39;t yet been &quot;created&quot;.  I&#39;ve used both 204 and 404 depending upon\nthe situation.  This feels more like a 404 to me though.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
