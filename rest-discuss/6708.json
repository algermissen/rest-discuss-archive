We&#39;ve established that you think that  \n&gt; Roy and\n&gt; the TAG aren&#39;t any kind of authorities wrt REST - because if you  \n&gt; did you&#39;d\n&gt; know that Roy would have a &quot;Roy stern comment&quot;(tm) on any W3C TAG  \n&gt; finding\n&gt; that contradicted his view of REST and he&#39;s also contributed to that\n&gt; finding.\n\nEr, not since it was completely rewritten -- I haven&#39;t even reviewed it.\nThe first sentence, for example, is problematic.\n\n&gt; FWIW, one of the underlying philosophical aspects of REST is that\n&gt; resources and their representations change, and that includes REST  \n&gt; itself.\n\nNo, it is that representations can change if that is how the resource\nis defined.  A resource does not change -- what changes are the\nperceptions of the users of a resource (hence, &quot;do not try to bend\nthe spoon, for that would be impossible ...&quot;).  That is where I and\nthe semantic web part ways, since someone decided that the semantic\nweb would assume a world that does not change its own perceptions.\n\nMy dissertation will not change.  Whether or not the style changes is\ndebatable -- other people&#39;s perceptions are guaranteed to change\n(I&#39;ve already seen multiple papers claiming to &quot;add&quot; features to REST\nthat were already in the style to begin with, as well as plenty of\narguments about &quot;REST fundamentals&quot; that are not even close\nto what I wrote).  Personally, I&#39;ve got better things to do.\n\nI think that this thread is seriously missing the point of my\ndissertation.  All of the REST constraints exist for a reason.\nThe first thing you should do is determine what that reason is,\nand then see if it still applies to the system being designed.\nUse the old noggin -- that is the point.\n\nFYI, the reason, in this case, is independent evolution of components.\nAnd hypermedia is a defined term (that does not mean just HTML).\n\n....Roy  [and, yes, I am not answering the question, on purpose]\n\n"}}
