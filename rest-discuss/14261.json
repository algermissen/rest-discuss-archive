The service cannot insert extra hops with human readable\n&gt; documentation to direct the cliet to a place where it finally finds\n&gt; the &quot;buy&quot; relation.\n\nLets compare this to the human interaction: Amazon decides to remove the \n&quot;buy&quot; link on an item. Why on earth would they do that? People wouldn&#39;t be \nable to shop anymore because they broke the expectation of the client.\n\nOkay, what Amazon really wanted was to insert a new step in the workflow. \nFor instance &quot;click this checkbox if you are not a terrorist&quot; (now required \nby the US government :-)). What would Amazon do? Probaly set up huge sign \nreading &quot;we have changed our interface, blah blah, follow this link \ninstead&quot;. This is the human documentation you mention.\n\nWhat would the corresponding computer change be? If it is not a mandatory \nstep (which it probably is) then it could just use content negotiation to \nversion the interface and everybody would be happy. If it was mandatory then \nour computer has to learn a new media type: \napplication/shop.terroristcheck+xml. Amazon would still keep the &quot;buy&quot; \nrelation, but at the end of it there would be our new media type.\n\nFrom this I would say: clients should *not expect any specific media type \nfor a relation* - the &quot;buy&quot; relation only states &quot;GET this to continue \nbuying&quot;, but at the end of that link the computer could find any ressource: \nan application/shop.order+xml or application/shop.terroristcheck+xml or \nsomething else.\n\nI guess a client should not be driven by *expectations* of what to find \nwhere - only by *knowledge* of it&#39;s current ressource and a *goal*. You \nwould then end up with a huge matrix of media-types and goals, each of which \ntelling the computer what to do next. Any unknown media type would kill the \napplication (or make it backtrack and try something different).\n\nOur initial goal would be &quot;find item&quot; and initially we would look up a \nspecific URL and get the representation stored there. Then our \nmedia-type/goal matrix would tell us what to do next. It would never depend \non an expectation of what ressource type to find at the end of any \nrelation - it should only know that &quot;if I have \nmedia-type=application/shop.item+xml and goal=buy then I must GET the &#39;buy&#39; \nrelation and then re-evaluate with the new ressource&quot;.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n/J�rn \n\n\n"}}
