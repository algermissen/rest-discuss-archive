There are ongoing debates as to which one is better suited in\n&gt; today&#39;s highly interactive environment. However, recent efforts,\n&gt; including Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2.0, have tried to\n&gt; give Web services the ability to benefit from REST and use REST  \n&gt; concepts.\n&gt; The HTTP binding specification, available in WSDL 2.0 adjuncts,  \n&gt; talks a\n&gt; lot about this. The first part of this article focuses on how REST is\n&gt; married to Web services in WSDL 2.0. The second part explains how it&#39;s\n&gt; being implemented in the Apache Web services project. Does WSDL 2.0\n&gt; enable REST? The motivation of WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding is that it allows\n&gt; services to have both SOAP and HTTP bindings.
