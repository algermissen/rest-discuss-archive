In your example of M2M, if I am a developer writing a web applic=\r\nation with a UI front end that users visit/log in/etc, and I want to provid=\r\ne them with Facebook login to access the site.. am I now considered the M2M=\r\n in this equation.. in that I will be writing code on my web app to interfa=\r\nce with facebook api? What continually confuses me is the idea of trying to=\r\n remain HATEOAS compliant as I write my own API, and consuming an API as a =\r\ndeveloper. What I mean is, as the API developer, I am trying to provide a H=\r\nATEOAS compliant API.. one that returns response with links that MUST be fo=\r\nllowed by the consumer, and only those links. But as of now, I still have t=\r\no provide documentation that explains to a developer the possible links tha=\r\nt can be returned from each resource. For example, my API provides access\n =\r\ncontrol to a degree.. user and admin level resources. IF the request is bei=\r\nng made to an admin resource, the auth user must be one that is authorized =\r\nto use that resource. IF they are, the response has the resource link(s) th=\r\nat allow them to further do other things that a normal user can not. Withou=\r\nt documenting what resources will result in a successful (or failed) attemp=\r\nt at an admin resource, the developer won&#39;t know what to scan for in the &lt;l=\r\ninks&gt; elements I return and what they can do next. I have to document the r=\r\neturned links, the rel=3D&quot;&quot; string value, and what each href resource point=\r\ner will allow them to do, so that the developer knows ahead of time and can=\r\n make use of the resources as needed. To me, this is much like the facebook=\r\n API.. I can&#39;t just go to facebook.com/api and from there magically know ho=\r\nw to use whatever resources come back. I have to, as a developer providing =\r\nmy end users with the ablity to use facebook to log in, know what\n resource=\r\ns to call, what params to pass, etc. Am I wrong on this assumption? IF so, =\r\nplease enlighten me such that I might understand how this would not be need=\r\ned.\nWhat confuses me about all this is the idea that we can write (and cons=\r\nume) evolveable APIs that we know nothing about. We simply need the entry U=\r\nRL and from there we just know what to do based on what is returned. Unless=\r\n I am missing something, there is no standard set of link/rel values that w=\r\nork the same way for every API. Just because one rel=3D&quot;login&quot; might indica=\r\nte a resource to log in to, doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t do something else on anot=\r\nher site. Like wise, any given API could return a variety of other rel=3D&quot;&quot;=\r\n values in the response links, or return entirely different element names a=\r\nnd without some sort of documentation explaining all of this, I would not b=\r\ne able to consume it. I realize a HATEOAS API should be just like a web sit=\r\ne..such that a web bot could traverse html &lt;a&gt; elements.. likewise we retur=\r\nn &lt;link&gt; elements allowing a bot to traverse it. What throws me there is.. =\r\nsome links may be POST only, or UPDATE only, some may support GET,POST, etc=\r\n.\n A bot could be written in such a way to try every method type, see where=\r\n it leads and crawl it&#39;s way through every link. As a developer using someo=\r\nne&#39;s API to provide my user&#39;s a GUI to use my site, I can&#39;t just go crawlin=\r\ng through an API blindly and give my end users some sort of useful function=\r\nality from the API. I have to know exactly what resource to call (or how to=\r\n navigate to it) and what it does. If I want to get the weather, I need to =\r\nknow how I pass my users location to the api, and what resource to call tha=\r\nt supports me passing in the location and returns the weather for that loca=\r\ntion.

IOW, not the protocol (HTTP) and not the me=\r\nssage formats (media types).\n\n\nsince REST focuses on sharing understanding =\r\nthrough response representations that contain hypermedia to advance applica=\r\ntion flow, =C2=A0the focus of evolvability is (in my work) on the media typ=\r\ne and the response representations.\n\n\nthe important task of writing hyperme=\r\ndia applications is mapping the problem domain details to elements in the m=\r\nedia type.=C2=A0IOW, to evolve the system to match changes in the problem d=\r\nomain, you modify the representations and the hypermedia within those repre=\r\nsentations.\n\nso, with that as a basis...\nthere are two different cases to c=\r\nonsider:Human-driven user-agents (or Human-to-Machine - H2M) and,Machine-dr=\r\niven user-agents (or Machine-to-Machine - M2M).\n\nH2M evolvability for hyper=\r\nmediain this case the &quot;human&quot; driving the user agent (UA) has &quot;knowledge in=\r\n the head&quot; that the user agent does not have. the UA can focus just on reco=\r\ngnizing, parsing, and rendering the media type representations and allowing=\r\n the human to interpret the results and make choices based on the human&#39;s k=\r\nnowledge of the problem domain and the hypermedia affordances (links and fo=\r\nrms) presented.\n\nsince the act of mapping intention (what i want to get don=\r\ne) to action (the links and forms available) is all handled by a human, ser=\r\nvers are free to make quite a wide range of changes and the system will sti=\r\nll function well. =C2=A0\n\nfor example, in H2M cases, the server is free to =\r\nadd/remove inputs elements in forms, add/remove links, change the &quot;order&quot; i=\r\nn which links/forms are presented, even introduce entirely new forms and in=\r\nputs. All these things are not likely to &quot;break&quot; the system since the human=\r\n can be reasonably expected to &quot;know&quot; the problem domain (or a similar doma=\r\nin) enough to make decisions along the way.=C2=A0\n\nM2M evolvability for hyp=\r\nermediain this case there is no human *directly* driving the interactions b=\r\netween client and server. the UA is a &#39;bot&#39; and has only the &quot;knowledge in =\r\nthe code&quot; to work with. This knowledge has to be &quot;put&quot; there by some human,=\r\n of course.\n\nfor this scenario, the server has a much more limited set of e=\r\nvolvability options. severs can remove inputs, remove links/forms, and/or c=\r\nhange the order of their appearance and still expect the system to &quot;work pr=\r\noperly.&quot; IOW, the server cannot add any new inputs, links, or forms and exp=\r\nect the &#39;bot&#39; to &quot;know&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; these new elements.\n\nFWIW, i think =\r\nthere are a number of ways to improve the M2M case, but i am not yet prepar=\r\ned to talk about that since i have not made much progress yet in this area.=\r\n\ni hope this gives you some ideas on how to tackle this problem and would b=\r\ne interested in other POVs and observations on this topic.\n\nmcahttp://amund=\r\nsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\n\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nOn Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 06:48, Jakob Strauch &lt;jakob.strauch@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n\n\none major aspect of using hypermedia is loose coupling and evolvability. =\r\nbut where are the boundaries? which server-side changes may/may not affect =\r\nhypermedia-aware clients?\n\n\n\nfor example: as a human user, i can easely ada=\r\npt to a change in a web shop system, e.g. when the order procedure include =\r\nsuddenly an additional step like providing an optional voucher code.\n\n\n\na h=\r\nypermedia client can be easely redirected. but i=C2=B4m sure the agent can=\r\n=C2=B4t do something useful there. at least not unless he gets tought how t=\r\no deal with the new domain concept (e.g. a new media type) - which means up=\r\ndating to a new version.\n\n\n\n\n\nso which aspect can be really decoupled? as f=\r\nar as i can see, there are &quot;only&quot; technical details like internal structure=\r\ns, urls.

If I want to get t=\r\nhe weather, I need to know how I pass my users location to the api, and wha=\r\nt resource to call that supports me passing in the location and returns\n th=\r\ne weather for that location. Don&#39;t I?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_14_1=\r\n32285582745348&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times,=\r\n serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); &quot;&gt;&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_14_1322855827453307&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_14=\r\n_132285582745348&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, time=\r\ns, serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); &quot;&gt;&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_14_1322855827453312&quot;&gt;Thanks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 12/2/11, mike amundsen &lt;i&gt;&lt;mamund@...&g=\r\nt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16=\r\n, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: mike amundsen &lt;m=\r\namund@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] weighting and boundaries=\r\n of evolvability and loose coupling?&lt;br&gt;To: &quot;Jakob Strauch&quot; &lt;jakob.strau=\r\nch@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, December=\r\n 2,\n 2011, 7:48 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1773243247&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1773243247ygr=\r\np-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Jakob:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i&#39;ve been doi=\r\nng some work in this area (evolvability for hypermedia-based systems) and, =\r\nwhile my experiments are still not completed, i can pass along some observa=\r\ntions that might give you some ideas.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;first, IMO=\r\n, you are correct to state that most all the &quot;evolvability&quot; is due to chang=\r\nes in the problem-domain. IOW, not the protocol (HTTP) and not the message =\r\nformats (media types).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;since REST focuses on sha=\r\nring understanding through response representations that contain hypermedia=\r\n to advance application flow, &nbsp;the focus of evolvability is (in my wor=\r\nk) on the media type and the response representations.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;the important task of writing hypermedia applications is mapping the=\r\n problem domain details to elements in the media type.&nbsp;IOW, to evolve =\r\nthe system to match changes in the problem domain, you modify the represent=\r\nations and the hypermedia within those representations.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;so, with that as a basis...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;there are two d=\r\nifferent cases to consider:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human-driven user-agents (or Human-to=\r\n-Machine - H2M) and,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Machine-driven user-agents (or Machine-to-Ma=\r\nchine - M2M).&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;H2M evolvability for hypermedia&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;in this case the &quot;human&quot; driving the user agent (UA) has &quot;knowledge =\r\nin the head&quot; that the user agent does not have. the UA can focus just on re=\r\ncognizing, parsing, and rendering the media type representations and allowi=\r\nng the human to interpret the results and make choices based on the human&#39;s=\r\n knowledge of the problem domain and the hypermedia affordances (links and =\r\nforms) presented.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;since the act of mapping intent=\r\nion (what i want to get done) to action (the links and forms available) is =\r\nall handled by a human, servers are free to make quite a wide range of chan=\r\nges and the system will still function well. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;for example, in H2M cases, the server is free to add/remove inputs eleme=\r\nnts in forms, add/remove links, change the &quot;order&quot; in which links/forms are=\r\n presented, even introduce entirely new forms and inputs. All these things =\r\nare not likely to &quot;break&quot; the system since the human can be reasonably expe=\r\ncted to &quot;know&quot; the problem domain (or a similar domain) enough to make deci=\r\nsions along the way.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;M2M evolvability for h=\r\nypermedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;in this case there is no human *directly* driving the i=\r\nnteractions between client and server. the UA is a &#39;bot&#39; and has only the &quot;=\r\nknowledge in the code&quot; to work with. This knowledge has to be &quot;put&quot; there b=\r\ny some human, of course.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;for this scenario, the s=\r\nerver has a much more limited set of evolvability options. severs can remov=\r\ne inputs, remove links/forms, and/or change the order of their appearance a=\r\nnd still expect the system to &quot;work properly.&quot; IOW, the server cannot add a=\r\nny new inputs, links, or forms and expect the &#39;bot&#39; to &quot;know&quot; or &quot;understan=\r\nd&quot; these new elements.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FWIW, i think there are a =\r\nnumber of ways to improve the M2M case, but i am not yet prepared to talk a=\r\nbout that since i have not made much progress yet in this area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i hope this gives you some ideas on how to tackle this proble=\r\nm and would be interested in other POVs and observations on this topic.&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;mca&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://amundsen.com/blog/&quot;&gt;http://amundsen.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;http://twitter.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;@mamund&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://mam=\r\nund.com/foaf.rdf#me&quot;&gt;http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1773243247gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 06:48, Jakob=\r\n Strauch &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:jakob.=\r\nstrauch@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Djakob.strauch@we=\r\nb.de&quot;&gt;jakob.strauch@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv1773243247gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid;&quot;&gt;\n\none major a=\r\nspect of using hypermedia is loose coupling and evolvability. but where are=\r\n the boundaries? which server-side changes may/may not affect hypermedia-aw=\r\nare clients?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nfor example: as a human user, i can easely adapt to a=\r\n change in a web shop system, e.g. when the order procedure include suddenl=\r\ny an additional step like providing an optional voucher code.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\na hy=\r\npermedia client can be easely redirected. but i=C2=B4m sure the agent can=\r\n=C2=B4t do something useful there. at least not unless he gets tought how t=\r\no deal with the new domain concept (e.g. a new media type) - which means up=\r\ndating to a new version.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nso which aspect can be really decoupled=\r\n? as far as i can see, there are &quot;only&quot; technical details like internal str=\r\nuctures, urls. Speaking of evolvability, i think most changes to a growing =\r\nAPI are more domain-related than technical-related.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf my assump=\r\ntions are correct, is it maybe more important to develop hypermedia clients=\r\n, which can be updated by hot-deploy mechanisms?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-------=\r\n-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYahoo!
