SMTP went 19 years without\nformalizing its retry strategy.  Does this suggest anything to you?  Like perhaps particular retry\nstrategies are out-of-scope for the protocol specification?  Like perhaps they are *higher level\nsemantics* in some sense?  Also note that 4.5.4 of 2821 is about retry *STRATEGIES* and consists of a\nset of conventions and constraints.  It&#39;s not possible to construct a canonical state machine for the\noverall behavior of SMTP with *a* single, canonical retry semantics.\n\n&gt; Oh.  Ok.  Then we are largely on the same page.\n&gt; I only arguing that HTTP asynch should provide all\n&gt; the services I now get from SMTP.\n\nOk, I&#39;m cool with that --- assuming by HTTP asynch you mean a store-and-forward message delivery\napplication built atop HTTP.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
