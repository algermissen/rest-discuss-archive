This plus content negotiation makes it possible to  \n&gt; &gt; evolve=\r\n the service as long you accept to teach your client how to  \n&gt; &gt; handle ne=\r\nw ressource types (and that is actually RESTful).\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think that it=\r\n is ok for the server to break a previously  \n&gt; established contract becaus=\r\ne the client can adapt by re-configuring/re- \n&gt; programing it? (Which is wh=\r\nat I think you are saying above).\n\nThat was not what I was trying to say :-=\r\n) The server should certainly not break expectations - but the client must =\r\nstate it&#39;s expectations explicitely using content negotiation: if it does n=\r\not include application/order.terroistcheck+xml in it&#39;s accept headers then =\r\nthe server is not allowed to return such ressources.\n\nHmmm, makes me think =\r\nthat the accept headers for a big website can grow to be quite large! Unles=\r\ns we find a smart naming scheme for the media types.\n\nYou certainly have to=\r\n re-program your client if you want it to recognize new and improved featur=\r\nes and ressources.\n\nBut if a service decides to add a new mandatory ressour=\r\nce type, well, then it has to break existing clients by explicitely returni=\r\nng an error code saying &quot;I cannot serve you a ressource type that you suppo=\r\nrt&quot;. But this is certainly not something a webshop would like to do since i=\r\nt means loosing a bunch of customers - exactly like the human version of th=\r\ne shop would do if it made up new features that humans could not figure out=\r\n. I would even say this happens all the time on the human web, it&#39;s just ca=\r\nlled &quot;bad usability&quot;.\n\nBy the way: I have never programmed anything like th=\r\nis, so it&#39;s all based on assumptions (which we all know are the mother of a=\r\nll fu**ups). But it&#39;s an interesting discussion.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
