Since a \n&gt; servlet by default grab&#39;s name/value pairs from the message body, how \n&gt; does it know no to look for name/value pairs?  Is there an implicit \n&gt; content type on a post request that says the message body will \n&gt; contain name/value pairs?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a second challenge that I have.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I have been testing this application, I am realizing that it will \n&gt; be more difficult to test from an html page since html does not allow \n&gt; put/delete to be specified on a form.  Also, a form will always write \n&gt; parameters as name/value pairs.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Does it sound like I am approaching this problem correctly?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
