The disagreement potentially comes in terms\nof what that authoritative information needs to be, how it may be used,\nand whether it can be used generatively to construct URI.\n\n&gt; Moreover, we argue that in addition to this, even when\n&gt; this authoritative information is available, it should not map to\n&gt; a specific relative URI structure, but instead each resource should\n&gt; be classified as the expected type independant of its name, and\n&gt; as part of the same aforementioned authoritative information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff appears to agree with the first part, per his response to me\n&gt; about signifying the &quot;implementation&quot; of a relative URI structure\n&gt; by exposing that as a &quot;feature&quot; URI.  But he disagrees with the\n&gt; second part.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that a fair characterization?\n\nMore or less.  I&#39;m not suggesting that the abstract &quot;type&quot; of a resource\nbe solely identified by its URI;  I am however suggesting that abstract\n&quot;type&quot; information may be profitably embedded in URI, and that (with\nappropriate rules and information for doing so, provided presumably by\nthe owner of the URI) that &quot;type&quot; and other useful information may be\ninferred from nothing more than URI.\n\nNote I&#39;m specifically not talking about content type --- that would be a\nvery bad idea --- but a somewhat fuzzier notion of ontological &quot;type,&quot;\ni.e. how that resources stands in relation to other resources in the same\ninformation subspace and what other resources might be there.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
