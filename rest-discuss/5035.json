The nouns themselves are the\nresources to which the URIs point.\n\nI personally think that RSS is a really good noun format for many of\nthe list of URIs resouces that we talk about in REST.\n\n\n&gt; I agree that HTTP methods are verbs, but I wonder whether\n&gt; intermediaries-as-adverbs is stretching the analogy a bit. :)\n\nI agree too.\n\nBut then I can never remember what an adverb is   /8-&gt;\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
