It is not a primary goal to save round trips. IOW, j=\r\nust because you can does not mean you should (save round trips).\n\n\n&gt; to be =\r\nable to invoke it with several ids at once:\n&gt; \n&gt;   (b) GET resource?id=3D{i=\r\nd1}&id=3D{id2}... or\n&gt;         GET resource/ids;id1;id2... or \n&gt;         GE=\r\nT resource/id1/id2... (BTW is this URL template acceptable? The ids are not=\r\n in a hierarchy as the slashes may suggest, but I&#39;ve seen it used elsewhere=\r\n).\n&gt; \n\nUse the first one: GET resource?id=3D{id1}&id=3D{id2}.\n\n&gt; This falls=\r\n in the realm of REST + batch operations but I don&#39;t know what is the best =\r\nsolution according to the REST architectural style.\n\nIf you really have to =\r\ndo this, the RESTful way is to make a resource that has the semantics of th=\r\ne &quot;bag&quot; (like you did). But beware that the response is a representation of=\r\n *that* resource.\n\nYou might want to look at multipart messages for this. H=\r\nere is a related experimental I-D:\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-h=\r\nttp-batch-01\n\n\n&gt; From what I&#39;ve read some people are of the opinion that (a=\r\n) should be used with HTTP pipelining for batch operations while others thi=\r\nnk that the solution (b) is\n&gt; equally acceptable since this is a resource t=\r\nhat happens to take multiple query/path/matrix parameters.\n\nHTTP pipelining=\r\n is not yet a reality, but theoretically, it would a the preferable solutio=\r\nn as opposed to a batch retrievel. You batch would not be visible to caches=\r\n for example.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.\n&gt; I have another resource which is an algorithm tha=\r\nt takes as input:\n&gt; - a list of parameters [x1, x2, ...]\n&gt; - another list o=\r\nf parameters [y1, y2, ...]\n&gt; - some other optional arguments\n&gt; \n&gt; My initia=\r\nl attempt is very RPC-style since I just implemented a resource that takes =\r\nthe input as:\n&gt; \n&gt;   GET resource?x=3Dx1&x=3Dx2&...&y=3Dy1&y=3Dy2...&amp;{rest =\r\nof the optional arguments}\n\nThat is not RPC-style. I see nothing unRESTful =\r\nin it.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One possible solution is to define a resource that accepts a =\r\nPOST with a representation of the input of the algorithm (say in JSON) and =\r\nreturns\n&gt; the HTTP status code 201 and another resource which can be invoke=\r\nd with GET.\n\nThis only makes sense if you want to persist the result as a r=\r\nesource. And if you do, use 201, Location and Content-Location so the clien=\r\nt does not need the extra GET.\n\n&gt; However this may complicate the server si=\r\nde implementation since I have to maintain state and decide for how long wi=\r\nll the resource created by the POST be available, etc...\n\nYes. If you do no=\r\nt need it, don&#39;t do it. The GET is fine.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; In fact, if all the clien=\r\nt wants is to invoke an algorithm, why would he do it in 2 steps instead of=\r\n just one?  So this solution doesn&#39;t appeal to me very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; How can I=\r\n make the resources 1. and 2. above RESTful?\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; D=E1rio\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n=\r\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nor=\r\ndsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-------------------------------=\r\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
