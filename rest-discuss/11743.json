Looking around the internet it\n&gt; seemed that the de facto way of doing this would be:\n&gt;\n&gt; application/vnd.myformat+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, just register &quot;myformat&quot; with IANA and have:\n&gt;\n&gt; application/myformat+xml\n&gt;\n&gt; One huge downside of this though is that my browser does not know  \n&gt; how to\n&gt; render application/myformat+xml.  So, my question to this list is, why\n&gt; aren&#39;t MIME properties used to identify XML schema?  For example:\n&gt;\n&gt; application/xml; schema=http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried this approach with Firefox and Safari and both browser ignore\n&gt; the attribute and render the document as XML.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would there be any reason NOT to use and promote this approach other\n&gt; than it goes against current de facto convention?  I blogged about  \n&gt; this\n&gt; a few months ago and have yet to receive a logical reason why this\n&gt; approach isn&#39;t superior:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com/2008/03/05/restful-xml-content-negotitation/\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
