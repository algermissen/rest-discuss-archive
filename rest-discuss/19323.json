One of the functions requires quite a few=\r\n input parameters so providing it all in the GET request would not work.  I=\r\n suggest they do a POST and provide the URI back to the user.  The problem =\r\nis currently there isn&#39;t a backend database, so where would we store the in=\r\ntermediate data?  If it is in memory does that reduce the ability to scale?=\r\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThank you,\nScott\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Matt McClure &lt;matthewlmcclure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Apr 21, 20=\r\n13, at 7:52 PM, Brian Craft &lt;craft.brian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fielding&#39;s =\r\ndefinition didn&#39;t do much for me, because the terms aren&#39;t\n&gt; adequately def=\r\nined, and there aren&#39;t enough examples to clarify his intent.\n&gt; Also, some =\r\nof the claims seem to be at odds with practice. Again, the &quot;POST\n&gt; to query=\r\n&quot; thing involves storing state between requests, while Fielding\n&gt; says REST=\r\nful APIs are better because of &quot;not having to store state between\n&gt; request=\r\ns&quot;. Well, which is it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think a key distinction is creating and de=\r\nstroying resources vs. other\n&gt; kinds of state. The former is a key feature =\r\nof REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; And more generally, I&#39;m trying to understand what REST is all=\r\n about. It&#39;s\n&gt; clear that the overwhelming majority of people who use the t=\r\nerm REST\n&gt; actually mean nothing more than AJAX. They merely haven&#39;t invest=\r\nigated at\n&gt; all what it is supposed to mean. Of the small minority who mean=\r\n something\n&gt; more than AJAX, one gets the impression that there isn&#39;t any s=\r\net of three\n&gt; people who agree on what it means. So, it&#39;s a popular buzzwor=\r\nd, and perhaps\n&gt; a religion, but is it actually a design pattern, and is it=\r\n actually useful,\n&gt; and can it actually be used to design a substantial app=\r\nlication with\n&gt; existing technologies?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend researching &quot;hyp=\r\nermedia&quot; for a higher signal to noise ratio\n&gt; about REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Matt McCl=\r\nure\n&gt; http://matthewlmcclure.com\n&gt; http://www.mapmyfitness.com/profile/matt=\r\nhewlmcclure\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
