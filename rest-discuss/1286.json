When Axis is deployed as a servlet, one can map a\nurl-pattern to the AxisServlet.  One can then deploy a transport specific\nhandler which obtains the relative path and does something appropriate with\nthat information.\n\n&gt; WSDL certainly does not support strongly and statically type\n&gt; declaring this interaction. That&#39;s its biggest flaw when it comes to\n&gt; REST.\n\nSeveral points.  First, WSDL need not be strongly typed.  I provide a\ncomplete and working example of this in\nhttp://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/02/15/aBusyDevelopersGuideToWsdl11.html.\n\n Second, it is possible that a WSDL could be generated dynamically for such\nURLs.  And finally, WSDL is not required.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought about the idea of a REST-on-SOAP\n&gt; and found a few problems\n\nI won&#39;t go point by point through these at this time.  I feel that you do\nhave a legitimate beef about SOAP over HTTP, but continue to make\ndistracting and somewhat irrelevant points, and I would like to focus first\non the core issues.  For example, a position that SOAP over HTTP should\nnever be used is one that I see as internally self consistent, but not one\nthat says that HTTP should have a default port, but SOAP over HTTP should\nnot.\n\nThe next step is to discuss the relationship between HTTP and REST.  There\nare not synonymous.  In particular, there are quite a number of uses of\nHTTP that are inconsistent with REST, including most CGI based\napplications, and by implication most servlets, ASPs, ColdFusion\napplications, PHP applications and the like.  And don&#39;t even begin to\nmention cookies...\n\nYet none of these seem to inspire the vitriol that SOAP has received.\n\n&gt; Actually, I am interested in this also, but I have a feeling that we\n&gt; would disagree on the virtues of SOAP. Nevertheless, it would be\n&gt; illuminating for me to hear your list of what SOAP has to offer REST.\n\nAgain, I think we need to separate REST and HTTP first.  And establish that\nHTTP is not the one answer to every question.\n\nA good place to start that discussion is with Don Box&#39;s observations:\nhttp://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-845220.html\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
