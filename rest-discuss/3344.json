While there&#39;s much value in viewing a web\napplication as a distributed state machine, I&#39;m not sure how far\nthat model needs to be carried into the implementation.  For\ninstance, how much about the FSM is the client expected to\nunderstand in order to use the service?  This is a sensitive area,\nbecause if the full FSM model is required on the client side,\nthen you lose the &quot;low cost of entry&quot; attribute, and make it\nharder for the server application to evolve.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the server has embodied within it the\nnotion of an FSM of valid client states, and the client is able\nto explore that (changing) state space dynamically, then you\nhave something cool.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Dave Kuhlman&quot; &lt;dkuhlman@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, January 28, 2003 7:26 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] REST and FSM and processes\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m fascinated by REST and I&#39;m fascinated by FSMs (finite state\n&gt; machines).  I also want to find ways to implement complex processes\n&gt; in a REST-ful way.  My belief is that a possible path to a solution\n&gt; for this problem goes through FSMs, specifically translating a\n&gt; complex business process into an FSM and then implementing the FSM\n&gt; in a REST-ful style.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I&#39;ve created and documented several models or patterns for\n&gt; implementing FSMs in a REST-ful style.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can find my document and examples at:\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/fsm_howto.html\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m very interested in any comments about whether I have suceeded\n&gt; in following &quot;the REST way&quot; and in any other suggestions.  Thanks\n&gt; in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;   - Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Dave Kuhlman\n&gt; dkuhlman@...\n&gt; http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
