It suggests to me that its meaning\n&gt; &gt; can have a wider scope than just the URI to which it&#39;s appended. \n&gt; &gt; If so, that&#39;s pretty darned useful, though less opaque (which is\n&gt; &gt; ok, as long as its interpretation is uniform).  It appears to work\n&gt; &gt; like a HTTP header.  But it is not itself a URI, so perhaps a\n&gt; &gt; registry is needed, or we can figure out a way of making it a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have any references for these uses? I was under the impression\n&gt; that parameters were just as opaque as any other URI component;\n&gt; servers certainly seem to treat them as such. IIRC they were\n&gt; originally introduced to enable VMS files (with versions) to be\n&gt; easily URIified.\n\nI was just extrapolating from Roy&#39;s example.  He&#39;s a good reference. 8-)\nI&#39;ll check out 2396 on the issue later (oh my, is my todo list ever\ngetting big!).\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard that deployed URI support is actually pretty good, except\n&gt; &gt; maybe in some funky cases like http://foo.com/bar;q?a=b\n&gt; \n&gt; Python&#39;s urlparse is broken; it assumes that you can only\n&gt; parameterise the last path segment, not every path segment. As a\n&gt; result, \n&gt;   http://www.example.com/foo;bar/baz?bat\n&gt; gets parsed as\n&gt;  (&#39;http&#39;, &#39;www.example.com&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar/baz&#39; &#39;bat&#39; &#39;&#39;)\n\nYah, I heard that urlparse was quite bad, but I take it that it&#39;s an\nexception.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
