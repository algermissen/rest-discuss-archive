And who would make a\n&gt; sensor a REST client? I&#39;d rather have the sensor=\r\n send measurement data via,\n&gt; e.g. UDP.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you definitely need to coordi=\r\nnate the clients and servers even though\n&gt; you are fully and properly using=\r\n HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, can you be more specific about what you mean here?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nis is why the vast majority of so-called web APIs are versionned and\n&gt; base=\r\nd on stable URIs and representations structures. They can&#39;t always\n&gt; afford=\r\n to dynamically discover the user interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say, the vast majority=\r\n of Web APIs fails to be RESTful because people\n&gt; simply did not follow the=\r\n style. Show me a single example that has been\n&gt; deliberately designed  unR=\r\nESTful on the basis of design principles. To me\n&gt; this is just the same old=\r\n discussion over and over again: People make a\n&gt; (rather unedcuated) claim,=\r\n mistake that for truth and come up with\n&gt; suboptimal design.\n&gt;\n&gt; And that =\r\nis not only true for wanna be REST services, unfortunately it is\n&gt; an all t=\r\noo common way to approach all sorts of IT problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my experience, p=\r\neople learn best if we do not settle for &#39;premature\n&gt; agreement&#39; but use, f=\r\nor example, a style to foster more flexible thinking.\n&gt; Usually, whoever en=\r\ndures that process is thankful in the end.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You could say that nat=\r\nive apps aren&#39;t needed and could be re-developped\n&gt; as HTML 5 apps, but thi=\r\ns isn&#39;t always possible or desirable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Either way, a native app makes a =\r\nperfectly RESTful client if you design it\n&gt; that way. Personally, I&#39;d go a =\r\nvery long way to maintain the benefit of not\n&gt; having to coordinate client =\r\ndeployment with API changes....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aside from systems that focus o=\r\nn sending fine grained control messages\n&gt; around in (near) realtime, I have=\r\n yet to see a case where REST does not\n&gt; shine due to performance, scalabil=\r\nity and the ability to decentralize\n&gt; management of the deployment and rele=\r\nase cycles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, my point is to take the best of what REST brings=\r\n but not try to\n&gt; apply it in cases where a rich hypermedia client is avail=\r\nable,\n&gt;\n&gt; What is a &quot;rich hypermedia client&quot;? Can you be more specific abou=\r\nt the\n&gt; situation that seems to be the root cause for the perceived need th=\r\nat you\n&gt; have to change the style?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but isn&#39;t so uncommon. I&#39;m just tr=\r\nying to do REST justice otherwise\n&gt; we&#39;ll get a backslash when people final=\r\nly realize that the vast majority of\n&gt; REST endpoints/APIs/etc. can&#39;t be us=\r\ned in a dynamic way like HTML is used\n&gt; by web browsers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you explai=\r\nn what you mean by &quot;a dynamic way like HTML is used by web\n&gt; browsers&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; To me it remains unclear what the problem is you are trying to solve.\n&gt; =\r\nPlease explain, I&#39;m all ears.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; J=\r\nerome\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!

They can&#39;t always afford to=\r\n dynamically discover the user interface.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;I&#39;d say, the v=\r\nast majority of Web APIs fails to be RESTful because people simply did not =\r\nfollow the style. Show me a single example that has been deliberately desig=\r\nned =A0unRESTful on the basis of design principles. To me this is just the =\r\nsame old discussion over and over again: People make a (rather unedcuated) =\r\nclaim, mistake that for truth and come up with suboptimal design.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nAnd that is not only true for wanna be REST services, unfortunately it is=\r\n an all too common way to approach all sorts of IT problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn my=\r\n experience, people learn best if we do not settle for &#39;premature agree=\r\nment&#39; but use, for example, a style to foster more flexible thinking. U=\r\nsually, whoever endures that process is thankful in the end.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You could say that native apps aren&#39;t needed=\r\n and could be re-developped as HTML 5 apps, but this isn&#39;t always possi=\r\nble or desirable.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;Either way, a native app makes a perfectly=\r\n RESTful client if you design it that way. Personally, I&#39;d go a very lo=\r\nng way to maintain the benefit of not having to coordinate client deploymen=\r\nt with API changes....&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Asid=\r\ne from systems that focus on sending fine grained control messages around i=\r\nn (near) realtime, I have yet to see a case where REST does not shine due t=\r\no performance, scalability and the ability to decentralize management of th=\r\ne deployment and release cycles.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Again, my point is to =\r\ntake the best of what REST brings but not try to apply it in cases where a =\r\nrich hypermedia client is available,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;What is a &quot;rich hy=\r\npermedia client&quot;? Can you be more specific about the situation that se=\r\nems to be the root cause for the perceived need that you have to change the=\r\n style?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; but isn&#39;t so uncommon. I&#39;m =\r\njust trying to do REST justice otherwise we&#39;ll get a backslash when peo=\r\nple finally realize that the vast majority of REST endpoints/APIs/etc. can&=\r\n#39;t be used in a dynamic way like HTML is used by web browsers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;Can you explain what you mean by &quot;a dynamic way like HTML is u=\r\nsed by web browsers&quot;?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo me it remains unclear what the =\r\nproblem is you are trying to solve. Please explain, I&#39;m all ears.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJan&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; J=\r\nerome&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYahoo!
