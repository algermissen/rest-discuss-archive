Some URIs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; may, by design, remain &quot;uncool&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So maybe we can use URI templates for the cool URIs (my photos, my\n&gt;&gt; blog posts, the books that Amazon offers, the songs that BBC radio\n&gt;&gt; plays) and HATEOAS (rel links in representations) for the uncool ones.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t draw a line like that, especially for the uncool ones.\n\nWhy not?\n\n&gt; Looking at this thread so far, it seems to me that both TBL&#39;s position (that\n&gt; every URI is permanent), and Roy&#39;s HATEOAS have been over-analyzed. The\n&gt; reality is a mix.\n\nMerely saying &quot;its a mix&quot; isn&#39;t helpful.

I&#39;m just trying to aid in the analysis of what constitutes\nsuch resilience.\n\n-- Nick\n\n"}}
