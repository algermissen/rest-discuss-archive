I \nwouldn&#39;t call that &quot;hardly anybody&quot;.\n\nNote that MOVE is atomic in that if it succeeds, the source URI \nshouldn&#39;t be mapped anymore. However, there is no inherent guarantee \nthat applying MOVE to a collection will be able to move all children.\n\nFinally, if for some reason a server fails during a MOVE operation in a \nway that it can&#39;t undo parts of the actions, it will signal a 5xx status \ncode.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
