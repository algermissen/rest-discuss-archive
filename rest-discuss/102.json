The difference isn&#39;t in &quot;something&quot; or &quot;something final&quot; ---\nit&#39;s in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vs. &gt;, aka POST vs. PUT.  Let me restate the sloppy example in a\nclearer\n&gt; fashion:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST is like        echo &quot;something&quot; &gt;&gt; foo\n&gt; PUT is like          echo &quot;something&quot; &gt; foo\n&gt;\nOh.\n\n\n&gt; Repeated POSTS of the same content are not necessarily idempotent;\nrepeated\n&gt; PUTs are.  The semantic differences are in the methods, with no additional\nneed\n&gt; for status codes embedded in the message, different resources, etc.  The\n&gt; semantics of POST are that the state of the resource (i.e., progress of\nthe\n&gt; transaction) is updated, while PUT implies that the state of the resource\nis\n&gt; replaced.  It&#39;s appropriate to view *replacement* of the resource state as\nthe\n&gt; finalization of the transaction.\n&gt;\nWell, as long as we have a common understanding that there are multiple\nmessages and one of them is the &#39;finalization&#39; of the transaction.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; One thought would be to make both the &#39;intermediate status&#39; and the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;response&#39; both URI addressable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not simply have content POSTED to the &quot;progress-of-the-transaction&quot;\nresource\n&gt; indicate intermediate changes of state, while the first content\nsuccessfully PUT\n&gt; to the resource indicates the completion of the interaction?  I may be\nmissing\n&gt; something really obvious, but I still don&#39;t think you need anything new,\nhere.\n&gt; I think POST and PUT to the same resource are sufficient.\n\n\nI suppose POST for the intermediate events and PUT for the final reply is\nfine.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
