Surely that is \n&gt; a resource of it&#39;s own, one that represents chapter 17, so if I wanted \n&gt; to update chapter 17 I should PUT my new representation of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, if I wanted to dub the film into Spanish, I could GET \n&gt; /piratesofthecarribean/dialogue, get my voice actors to record a new \n&gt; version in Spanish, and then PUT it back to \n&gt; /piratesofthecarribean/dialogue. The fact that it is a part of a larger \n&gt; whole is irrelevant from an API standpoint. Correct?\n\nCorrect.\n\nMy point was about the management of large resources.\n\nIf you are concerned about the efficiencies of passing large\nrepresentations around when you edit them you can simply construct\nanother set of resources over the existing resource that allows finer\ngrained editing.\n\n\nSplitting a film into chapters (like a DVD) is one way of doing\nit. But of course there are millions of others, one of them being the\nway you suggest.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
