Respectively:\n- /images/&lt;imageid&gt;\n- /images/&lt;imageid&gt;/thumbnails/&lt;size&gt; (where &lt;size&gt; is &quot;small&quot;,\n&quot;medium&quot; or &quot;large&quot;)\n\nBut then, on second thoughs, I considered the principle of content\nnegotiation: should I consider a thumbnail just as a different\nrepresentation of the same image? In this case I should probably use\nthe sare URL for both cases, and specify a different Accept header.\nIn the latter scenario though, I wouldn&#39;t be able to easily build an\nhtml page showing thumbnails, because html &lt;img&gt; tag simply doesn&#39;t\nallow to specify request headers in the &quot;src&quot; attribute, but simply a\nurl.\n\nMaybe I just answered myself, but I was wondering if anybody had an\nopinion (or better yet, experience) on this matter.\n\nThanks\nStefano\n\n"}}
