Must the resource use an entity body in a structured format\n&gt; with HREFs? Is there no &quot;standard&quot; way? If not, why not?\n\nI believe that is the Way of ReST.  The relationship is declarative rather\nthan algorithmic. Highly flexible but requires constant interpretation (of\nentity bodies).\nThis is similar to the earlier notification approach of using the response\nheader of Subscription: to identify the URI of the subscription resource\nrather than algorithmically/assume to know where it is.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the relationship (if any) behind the hierarchy expressed through\n&gt; &quot;/&quot;, &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; and the subordinate resource hierarchy? I think that\n&gt; there is no explicit relationship. Why do we need two hierarchies?\n&gt;\n(Do you mean &#39;no implicit relationship&#39;?) Applications can coordinate on a\nshared understanding of what &#39;..&#39; and &#39;/&#39; mean, but it isn&#39;t transferable in\ngeneral. It is very powerful, but also very easy to unconciously attempt to\nbypass - we are used to knowing how to communicate with our own servers.\n\nI find it difficult to avoid using .. and / to programmatically navigate my\napplication model. Using a response entity with explicit locations is a\nsomewhat new tool for me - using response headers is even &#39;more newer&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
