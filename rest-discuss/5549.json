It doesn&#39;t\n&gt;         violate \n&gt;         RFC 2616, since you can regard POST as &quot;process this&quot;.  And I\n&gt;         cannot\n&gt;         think of any bad consequences of doing it this way.\n&gt; I know Roy and I have argued about this point, but I continue to\n&gt; believe this to be somewhat &quot;bad&quot; as it exposes the client to the\n&gt; implementation details of the server by assuming that the data in the\n&gt; POST response constitutes a response to the query in the POST request.\n&gt; Consider that with such an assumption, one couldn&#39;t readily substitute\n&gt; another Web server and still have it meet the same expectation.\n\nI think toydi hits this problem on the head when he talks about the two\npost methods. I would usually explain POST as a method that creates\nstate. The state may or may not be associated with a newly-created\nresource. I tend to pair this with a GET that reports current state, and\nPUT that replaces some state with some other state. This use of a\nPOST-supporting resource as a little web service that performs a\nfunction could be said to be creating NULL state... but otherwise\ndiffers somewhat from the usual function of POST.\n\nWould it be better to introduce a DOIT method? This method could behave\nlike POST, accepting state and reporting it back. The difference would\nbe that it set up an expectation that no state would be created or\nchanged on the server side. Unfortunately, this would not improve the\ncachability of results when compared to the POST method. You would still\nneed to supply the request state each time to get a fresh response,\nbecause the request state may well be combined with server state in\norder to create that response. The server state may change at any time.\n\nIt seems there are two methods here, but only from the purist&#39;s\nperspective. In order to argue that the set of commonly-accepted REST\nmethods should change you would need to describe how clients or\nintermetiaties would interpret this method differently to the\nstate-creating form of POST.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
