Can you clarify if  \nRDFForms supports combining POST and querystrings?\n\nMy practical problem is that I want to send data to a processor and  \nalso provide a parameter (via QS) that is not derivable from the  \ndata, but only known by the client at POST time.\n\nTheoretically an rf:Container could well be an rf:Indexable (assuming  \nyou did not define the types to be distinct in your ontology), but  \nparameter and index seem to have different semantics; while the  \nformer &#39;fine tunes&#39; the processing the later denotes a sub  \ncollection. Or don&#39;t the semantics of rf:indexParam imply any such  \nnotion; are they mere parameters?\n\nIf so, what do you think about calling them rf:param and allowing  \nthem on rf:Containers, too? After all, the idea that they are  \n*index*Params seems a bit redundant given they appear on  \nrf:Indexables (at least now that I look at it that way :o)\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
