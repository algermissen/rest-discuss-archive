But in common usage,\nwe talk about resources as if they were things.\n\nA la REST, a resource maps individual points in time each to\na set of values which are indeed representations.  A URI\nonly identifies the mapping.  (BTW, when Roy says the URI\nin its entirety maps to a set of values, he is taking a small\nliberty with his own REST model, I think.)\n\nWhen you talk about &quot;part of a resource&quot; realize that formally\nyou are talking about part of the relation above.  Which part?\nThe domain (all the mapped time points)?  The range (all the\nrepresentations for all times, but without the time dimenstion)?\nCertain tuples (all mappings for 1994)?\n\nI am sure you mean none of the above.  In REST, there is no\nbuilt-in notion of resource decomposition the way you would\nthink of decomposing your car or your publications into parts.\nAnd so there can also be no standard for mapping conjugations\nof URIs onto them.\n\nSure hope this helps,\n\nWalden\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Bill Venners&quot; &lt;bv-svp@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Roy T.
