Note that &#39;edit&#39; in AtomPub does not mean &#39;PUT here to edit&#39; it means &#39;here is the authorable resource&#39;). If you can afford the round trip, you would not even need that because a redirected PUT on the member resource would do the trick.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, but I disagree with this Jan. AtomPub specifies which HTTP idioms to use to manipulate a resource. It constrains HTTP.\n\nYes, it does in a numner of areas - and wrongly so. AtomPub creates the impression that the client can makes certain assumptions (but it actually musn&#39;t). For example, AtomPub also errs by prescribing the representation type (Atom feed) to return for a GET on a collection.\n\n&gt; Sure, the specification of which method to use is not part of the &quot;edit&quot; definition - you&#39;re correct there - but AtomPub explicitly associates PUT with updates to a member URI (as indicated by an &quot;edit&quot; link). HTTP doesn&#39;t tell me how to delete or update members, just as it doesn&#39;t tell me how to delete or update contact info.\n\nYes it does: it gives you PUT and DELETE. AtomPubs treatment of these &#39;editing patterns&#39; is just overspecification that leads to clients with unRESTful built-ion assumptions.\n\n&gt; AtomPub, however, tells me how to delete and update members. Please don&#39;t overload HTTP method definitions with some domain-specific operation semantics.\n\nI do not see any overloading going on: PUT means &#39;store the entity at the specified resource&#39; and DELETE means &#39;delete any representations of the specified resource&#39; there is nothing more to it really.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (And whilst in this case it&#39;s the AtomPub spec that glues together an HTTP idiom and a link relation value in the context of a specific application goal, I see no reason why more specialized link relation definitions can&#39;t take it upon themselves to make this association.\n\nYes it can - it is just not necessary. If I know that a resource is a &#39;contact info resource&#39; then PUT simply means update that contact info. The situation is different with POST, where you might want to say that posting to the order-processor resource has the domain semantics of &#39;placing an order&#39;.\n\n&gt; It all depends on how &quot;general&quot; you want the link relation to be. I think Subbu&#39;s talked about this a bit before).\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that you&#39;ve chosen &quot;edit&quot; over &quot;updateContactInfo&quot;, because taken all by itself, &quot;edit&quot; looks just like a verb...\n\nYes, &#39;source&#39; would probably have been a better name for the link rel.\n\n&gt; Of course, it could be a substantive, much as &quot;update&quot; can be. The definition of edit, however, makes it clear that this isn&#39;t an operation definition. Just as the definition of &quot;updateContactInfo&quot; might.\n\nOk, but I am pretty sure that this was not the original intention. I much too often see\n\nupdateContactInfo\ndeleteContactInfo\n\nwhen people should just use\n\ncontactInfo and get the PUT and DELETE for free.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The real concern I have here is the attempt to find nouns and verbs in URIs. Someone took a wrong turn quite some time ago on this, and we all seem to be suffering with its legacy.\n\nRight - that is why action-like URIs bother me so much. Even more so when POST comes into play as in\n\nPOST /order/pay\n\n[empty body]\n\nwhich is unREStful because the message is not self descriptive but depends on the current server side state of /order.\n\nThat should really be:\n\nPOST /payment-processor\n\n&lt;order&gt;\n..\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards\n&gt; \n&gt; ian\n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
