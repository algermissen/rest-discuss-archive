Can anyone recommend a very good HTTP client\n&gt;&gt;for RESTful application development in java?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t know if I buy this or not.  What is it about Java client tools \n&gt;that is lacking from a REST perspective?\n\nwell, availability/stability for one... :) seriously, you&#39;ve got, what,\nthree basic choices?\n\n1. java.net.URL and java.net.URLConnection, which barely qualifies as\nusable\n\n2. http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ which isn&#39;t actively\nmaintained\n\n3. http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/ which is stuck in\nperpetual alpha\n\nI would think if you were looking to develop a REST client application,\nyou&#39;d want a client toolkit that made some things easy on you - simple\nthings like setting a base URL for a series of requests, easy\nauthentication... maybe more complex things like associating expected\nresponse codes / response message formats to requests with callback methods\nfor success or failure. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m in pure speculation mode here,\nnever having written a non-browser-based REST client, but I guess I don&#39;t\nsee anything in the Java side of things at least that compares favorably\nwith the RPC toolkits.\n\nCertainly any and all of those could be built on top of the existing http\nclients. I guess I&#39;m asking if anyone&#39;s aware of anything good that _has_\nbeen written already. If not, why not, and what would a good toolkit look\nlike?\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
