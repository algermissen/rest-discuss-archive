If the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;community&#39; makes a big stink about it, they might do something.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s a lot of web services doing about the same thing.  del.icio.us,\n&gt; for example.  My feeling is that consensus is swinging strongly towards\n&gt; RESTful architecture but it&#39;s taking time for the full implications to\n&gt; sink in.  Developers now know why they want resources to have URLs, next\n&gt; up is to absorb the value of separating out the impact on state with\n&gt; different methods.  That seems completely reasonable to me -- smart people\n&gt; have to prove things for themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Lucas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
