Cookies and URL rewriting and similar\napproaches =\r\nare not necessarily violations of REST, nor are they bad\ndecisions.  If you=\r\n read the text closely, it talks about statelessness\nas being the easiest t=\r\no build from the server perspective, which is\nobviously true.  But &#39;ease of=\r\n building&#39; is by no means the only\ncriteria for evaluating one part of a sy=\r\nstem.\n\nThere are a large number of very scalable and performant web sites\nt=\r\nhat retain state on the server.  If you want a very high performant\nweb sit=\r\ne, you have to move a bunch of state into a cache of some kind,\nbeit memcac=\r\nhed, APC, or any of the many other solutions.  You then\nhave to tie the cli=\r\nent into a server that holds the client&#39;s cached\nstate.  These systems are =\r\ndefinitely more complicated than a stateless\nweb server, but it&#39;s all about=\r\n making trade-offs in building\ndistributed systems.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n\n2009/3/7=\r\n Roy T.
