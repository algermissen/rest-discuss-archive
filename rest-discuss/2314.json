When you send a message concerning that future behavior, it \n&gt; will be governed by the contractual commitment.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the message that is governed by the contractual commitment may be \n&gt; clear in its own contents, but it is not independent of the \n&gt; commitment in its business effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore should it reference the commitment, or include it inline?\n\nI&#39;d say the reference.\n\nI just talked to my wife (a lawyer) about this, and what we discussed\npretty much jives with what I&#39;ve said in this thread.  Basically, if one\ncontract depends on some detail of another, then either a) reference it\nif the referencing system can guarantee that dereferencing it will\nalways produce the identical contract, or b) include the other contract\nas an attachment.  She said it&#39;s easier to include as an attachment than\nto try to cut and paste chunks out of it, because some context may get\nlost in doing so.\n\nThe difference there from my previous statements, is that it&#39;s safe to\nuse a reference in the case where the details of the other contract\nmatter, iff it can be guaranteed to always refer to exactly that\ncontract.\n\nMaybe some examples would help ...\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
