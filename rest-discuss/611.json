The resource identified by the callback URI can be whatever\n&gt; the subscriber wants it to be.  If it&#39;s a semaphore, then PUT or POST\n&gt; is fine.  If it&#39;s a mailbox, then POST is good.  I dare you to try and\n&gt; choose a resource that&#39;s used to receive notifications that can&#39;t\n&gt; receive them with PUT or POST.\n\nAs I said this is really a gut level issue, but I\nthink at very least you cannot use PUT.\nPUT is supposedly idempotent. That means that the\nresult of two PUTs is the same as the result of\none PUT.\n\nI don&#39;t think that is true of notifications.\nIn particular, do two notifications mean that the\noriginal object changed once or that it changed\ntwice?  So the semantics of PUT are definitely\nwrong for notification.\n\nYou obviously can use POST.  But that is because\nPOST has no meaning at all.  It is used for\nqueries (terroristornot.com), it is used for\nupdates, it is even used to delete sometimes.\nOften POST actually results in the creation of\nnew resources (e.g. adding stuff to a shopping\nbasket).\n\nThe choice of POST or NOTIFY boil down to how\nyou distinguish between changing the behavior of\na listener and interacting with it.\nThere are three choices:\n1. Use POST and define special content like a\nmime-header or body.  This interferes with\nallowing arbitrary local management of listeners.\n2. Use NOTIFY\n3. Use a different URL for notification and\nlistener management -- this is very non RESTy.\n\nAll that being said, I don&#39;t, at this point, see a\nneed for anything other than persistant GET.  So\nthis is all sort of moot.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
