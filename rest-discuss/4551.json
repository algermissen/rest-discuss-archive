HTTP provides a protocol that can be used REST-fully\n&gt; in many ways, but it can also be used non-REST-fully.  I don&#39;t know\n&gt; the Jabber protocol, but you may be able to use that REST-fully also.\n\nYes, I&#39;m starting to realize this.  I&#39;ve been doing some reading on BEEP/APEX, which seems more appropriate than Jabber for this kind of thing.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it interesting that you are distributing transactions.  I had\n&gt; been thinking of transactions as local to a peer and not materializing\n&gt; on other peers until they were committed (so only a client could hold\n&gt; a URI for any object within the transaction).\n\nThat&#39;s just the way it works out for my application.  I&#39;m trying to do something very specific, not create a general framework.\n\nThanks for the comments.  I feel confident I&#39;m on the right path.\n\nRyan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
