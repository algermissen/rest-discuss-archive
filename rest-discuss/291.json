If the connection is closed, they re-open\n&gt; it. That might be where the &#39;repeated requests&#39; are coming from. Those are\n&gt; very infrequent.\n\nWhat is a persisent response?  I think they may do\nkeep-alive my repeatedly asking the server &quot;any\nmessages, any messages,....&quot;, but that is still\npolling and it is still ugly (a waste of resources\nand bandwidth).\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you are talking about the knownow event\n&gt; &gt; routers, it sounds like they are implementing\n&gt; &gt; listservs.  If they are sending out 10k concurrent\n&gt; &gt; email messages, that is very nice.  If they are\n&gt; &gt; sending out only 100-1000 concurrent messages and\n&gt; &gt; just claim a max of 10k listeners, that is\n&gt; &gt; incredibly unimpressive.\n&gt; Oh. Remember, I don&#39;t have real numbers as I do not work there\n\nIf you don&#39;t have real numbers then lets drop\nknownow.\n\n&gt; &gt; Either way, this has little to do with persistent\n&gt; &gt; GET and the merits of HTTP for presence\n&gt; &gt; applications.  The main point is that HTTP is\n&gt; &gt; suboptimal for this application (but you may need\n&gt; &gt; it if the client is a web browser).\n&gt; If the client were another server, would http be sufficient?\n\nNot if you only want to send messages when the\nclient is &quot;available.&quot;\n\n&gt; &gt; Yeah. Me too.  How many chat clients can your web server support?\n&gt; 10,000. Like I said, the KN server can handle 10k concurrent browser clients\n&gt; per cluster node.\n\nOk.  Great.  What is the polling frequency?\nMy point is that whatever the number, a server\nthat allows clients to hold open connections for\nlong periods of time will perform orders of\nmagnitude better.\n\nYou could implement with HTTP if the server chunk\nencoded delivery of messages and the client held\nthe connection open long enough, but as you noted\nthis is a serious abuse of HTTP and as I noted,\nmost servers and intermediaries aren&#39;t happy to\nlet an HTTP connection stay silent for too long.\n\n&gt; &gt; Even if your server could handle higher capacity\n&gt; &gt; the bandwidth of handling large numbers of pings\n&gt; &gt; will also eventually overwhelm you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alternatively, you could also document a\n&gt; &gt; more scalable protocol like Jabber, IRC, or Kazaa,\n&gt; &gt; give away the source, get the same hackers to\n&gt; &gt; work on it, and perhaps get bought by AOL!\n&gt; Or examine your assumptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nobody here is suggesting polling is the preferred way to go. A server that\n&gt; transparently handled polling for backward compatibility would help in many\n&gt; situations, as long as the scalability/traffic problems don&#39;t surface.\n\nThe issue is that HTTP requires polling to\nestablish presence.\n\nLet me ask it all another way, do you want to use\nHTTP instead of telnet/ssh (to interact with the\nshell)?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
