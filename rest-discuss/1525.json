Wouldn&#39;t the best way\n&gt; to page someone be to POST a page so that the thing you&#39;ve POSTed has a\n&gt; URI? Then the person doing the paging and the paged person both have a\n&gt; name for the page, the person doing the page could refer to it later\n&gt; (e.g. to ask to cancel it (DELETE), or extend it (sub-POST)) and so\n&gt; forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I do think that there is room for a layer of abstraction on the\n&gt; client side that allows a natural OO API rather than just HTTP methods.\n\nI agree on both points.  I was merely using paging in the telephony domain\nto indicate that we&#39;re discussing different abstractions of the words verbs\nand nouns.  Paging applications on the web could probably be modeled just as\nwell using a &quot;page&quot; as document model v.s paging as action model.\n\nI&#39;ve been looking for exactly this type of natural OOP API as an abstraction\nfor implementing transactional applications within the REST mdoel.\n\n&gt; Okay, but we might as well call it &quot;submit purchase request&quot; because we\n&gt; are going to make a new purchase request object and it will have a new\n&gt; URI. &quot;Buy&quot; might be more familiar but &quot;submit purchase request&quot; is more\n&gt; accurate. And you are going to want a way to navigate back to *all* of\n&gt; your purchase requests later, so somewhere there must be a list of them.\n&gt; So an even more accurate name for the service is &quot;add new purchase\n&gt; request&quot;, i.e. &quot;POST&quot; to &quot;your_purchase_requests&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I analyze these things I usually don&#39;t have a need for verbs as\n&gt; URIs *except* to work around implementation limitations.\n\nI have no doubt that we can convert any action into a &quot;noun&quot; concept.  As\nyou said, purchasing something is conceptually similar to creating a\npurchase record.  An action typically creates a state change that can be\ncaptured as an document record.\n\nThis is fine for many actions, but for many other actions, this is very\nawkward thinking.  Few people really thinking of turning on the air\nconditioning as changing the state of the AC into the &quot;ON&quot; state.  Starting\na race is an action that isn&#39;t naturally modeled as a &quot;noun&quot;.\n\nI definitely agree that having a record created of an action as a\nconsequence is often useful, but doesn&#39;t necessarily make that the natural\nmental model for programmers or ultimately, end-users.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
