Just don&#39;t expose the individual variants. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Use only the cool-uri. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; But I want to retain access to the alternate representations.  Also,\n&gt; You can solve the URI-aliasing problem that way, but not the other\n&gt; problem: Setting up content negotiation for two variants results in\n&gt; untold numbers of &quot;cache aliases&quot;, one for each ACCEPT header out\n&gt; there. After being written to cache (or a pointer is created) most\n&gt; of these likely LRU-expire before ever getting served from cache,\n&gt; while diluting the cache hits (and retention probability) on the\n&gt; representations which match mainstream clients. \n\nDo you know they get LRU expired?\n\nIs there a reason they get dumped when a specfic uri is not dumped?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;What if it changes it&#39;s preferred representation? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; That is a valid question, we&#39;ve experimented with setting expire\n&gt; times on the cookies. But, how important is it to handle such an\n&gt; unlikely case? \n\nHow unlikely is it? \n\nHave you measured the unlikliness?\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
