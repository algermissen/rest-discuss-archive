I believe that a resource type should entirely own a\n&gt; representation type. One shouldn&#39;t think of RSS as a representation, one\n&gt; should think of RSS_SiteSummary as a representation *of* the SiteSummary\n&gt; resource type. And therefore RSS_SiteSummary should be a sub-element of\n&gt; SiteSummary, not an independent element.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rationale: The primary purpose of representation types is to extract\n&gt; links for the resource type. It doesn&#39;t make sense to do this in the\n&gt; abstract. A particular representation needs to extract its links for a\n&gt; particular resource type. If the representation type is &quot;purchase order&quot;\n&gt; and the references it is expecting are &quot;acceptance_URI, customer_URI and\n&gt; cancellation_URI&quot; then the WRDL representation type needs to have\n&gt; exactly those reference types...like a Java implementation of an\n&gt; interface. Maybe the same concrete syntax (text/ebxmlpo+xml) is used as\n&gt; a representation of another resource. In that context it will have\n&gt; different reference types so it will be for all intents and purposes a\n&gt; new representation.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
