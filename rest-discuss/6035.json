For the system to work, the client must  \nunderstand the semantics of the choice. As long as this is the case,  \nthe system is RESTful.\n\nNote that this means that you need to define the link semantics (as a  \nMIME type or XML schema, or RDF namespace for example) before the  \nimplementation of both, client and server. The evolvability benefit  \nREST gives you is that both, client and server, can evolve  \nindependently as long as they only use that shared schema /wrt  \nmessage semantics. This is especially great if the development teams  \nfor client and server are decentralized (are not goverend by a single  \nauthority) and would therfore be rather costly to coordinate.\n\nThis is why people can write HTML browsers without ever talking to  \nthe guys that write the HTML pages and vice versa. Same with RSS  etc.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is, which HTTP status code best represents this &quot;query\n&gt; accepted, but disambiguation required&quot; situation?\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought about &quot;HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices&quot;, as it seems the\n&gt; obvious choice at first glance, but the HTTP RFC talks about content\n&gt; negotiation, which isn&#39;t what I&#39;m trying to do.\n\nOoops....sorry, when sending the previous reply, I just did not see  \nyou mention 300 already.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it make more sense to return &quot;HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found&quot;, and a list\n&gt; of alternative URLs?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
