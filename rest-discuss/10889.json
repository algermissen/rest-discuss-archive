You can use a POST if you want. Just\nmake sure that this is coded in via a resource which is GETtable. That\nis you don&#39;t hard code using a PUT on a named resource into your code.\nRather you do a GET and first find out the allowed methods and then\ndecide what you want to do. The key is reduced coupling via HATEOAS.\n\n(ofcourse using POST is ugly etc. etc. , but it doesn&#39;t REALLY break\nthe REST constraints afaik).\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n2008/6/10 Etan Wexler &lt;yahoo.com@...&gt;:\n&gt; Stephan Koops wrote (in\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10884 ):\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; how should I model something, if I need a 5th method, but there are only\n&gt;&gt; GET, POST, PUT and DELETE?\n&gt;\n&gt; There are at least 27 HTTP methods that have public descriptions. Other\n&gt; methods are in private use. I do not know where you get the notion that\n&gt; &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;, and &quot;DELETE&quot; are the only methods. After all, you\n&gt; submitted your question to rest-discuss, a forum for discussing the\n&gt; Representational State Transfer and not much a forum for discussing\n&gt; tricks for dealing with software tools that are broken as designed.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Example: I want to deactivate a user in a user\n&gt;&gt; or employee management. With SOAP, RPC or something like that I create a\n&gt;&gt; [method, &quot;deactivate&quot;, and] call it with the user number. How should I\n&gt;&gt; model\n&gt;&gt; this with REST over HTTP?\n&gt;\n&gt; What is REST over HTTP? It seems that you mean the use of HTTP in a\n&gt; manner that is as faithful to REST as is possible. Honestly, though, I\n&gt; have a tendency to be wrong when, given wording that is unclear to me, I\n&gt; presume what people mean.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do I have to GET the full user data (JSON,\n&gt;&gt; XML, ...), change the state to &quot;deactivated&quot; and PUT this back?\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a possibility. Roy Fielding would tell you that you could also\n&gt; send a request with the method &quot;PATCH&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or should I PUT to the [user&#39;s] sub resource /users/1234/status/ the\n&gt;&gt; entity\n&gt;&gt; &quot;deactivated&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; Even with my tendency towards incorrect presumption, I hereby presume\n&gt; that you mean that you would submit an HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; request for a resource\n&gt; related to the user, where the related resource is the activation status\n&gt; of the user and where the request has an entity-body that indicates\n&gt; deactivation. I favor such an approach if the user and the activation\n&gt; status explicitly relate to each other via hyperlinks in their\n&gt; representations and if the representations explain or imply, by way of\n&gt; the semantics of the media type of the representations, the operations\n&gt; that a user agent and its clients must execute to achieve a successful\n&gt; result.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Etan Wexler.\n&gt; Please do not reply to me when replying to rest-discuss. I read the\n&gt; messages that people send to rest-discuss and I do not want duplicates.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
