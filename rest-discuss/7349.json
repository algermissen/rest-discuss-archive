It&#39;s easier to argue that PATCH could be rephrased as \n&gt; &gt; a PUT or POST to a related &#39;metadata&#39; resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can DELETE.  PATCH has very specific semantics and a very \n&gt; specific goal of reducing bits on updates.  It is a separate \n&gt; method because it needs access to the same (generic) \n&gt; conditional mechanisms as PUT and because POST (when applied \n&gt; to an authorable resource) means append.\nSorry - I used PATCH in that example without knowing the actual semantics. I\nthink I had it confused with PROPPATCH. Or I was simply confused.\nI&#39;ve been looking for a &#39;partial update&#39; operation, so I&#39;ll take a look at\nPATCH - is this the authoritative description:\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/spec.html#PATCH\n\n\n\n"}}
