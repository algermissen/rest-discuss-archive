An external application  \n&gt; would be OK, too.\n\nYes,I  meant to write handler, not plugin.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And since the\n&gt;&gt; HTTP client connector is part of the browsers the handler  \n&gt;&gt; registration\n&gt;&gt; would have to be there.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you reveal the use case beind your question?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m considering to refactor an existing, monolithic Java fat client  \n&gt; application into something that can handle individual documents sent  \n&gt; as entities in an HTTP response (instead of turning the whole thing  \n&gt; into a Web app).\n\nThe place to register the handler (the place to configure the  \ndispatcher) is the client side HTTP connector your &#39;something&#39; uses.\n\nI like the idea of having that in the &#39;file handling layer&#39; of the OS  \nby treating URLs like file names. I was thinking about a tool the  \nother day that would display resources as desktop items and allow  \ndouble click for GET and drag and drop for PUT or POST (depending  \nwhich one the resource supports). Moving to trash would be a DELETE  \nand &#39;Get Info&#39; a HEAD. An item that is a collection could open up  \n(like a finder window) and make its elements likewise accessible.\nMaybe one would drag a Pizza order document of type application/order \n+xml to the order-processor item on the destop that represents the URL  \nof  your favorite delivery service. (Maybe that provokes some ideas  \nfor your use case)\n\n\n&gt; As it&#39;s Java, it would work on all platforms that matter. I can  \n&gt; invent some vnd.* content-type for the document format. But what&#39;s  \n&gt; the effort required to register this media type on the different  \n&gt; platforms? How do the different environments pass the content to the  \n&gt; helper app, and is there a library that hides potential differences?\n\nI think it might be possible to do once per OS, but I doubt it would  \never be OS independent (as the connector would have to be part of the  \nOS).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; On the Mac, there&#39;s something called the Launch Services API, which  \n&gt; at first glance seems very close:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Carbon/Conceptual/LaunchServicesConcepts/LSCIntro/LSCIntro.html\n&gt;\n&gt; How do other platforms handle this?\n\nNo idea, sorry. But I bet Microsoft has something like it.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
