Joe\n&gt; Gregorio&#39;s articles on XML.com are still the *only* thing to date I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; that approaches practicality, and believe me I&#39;ve searched for practical\n&gt; examples. But maybe you&#39;ll say practicality isn&#39;t goal, but then what good\n&gt; is something that has no practical use (without getting philisophical, of\n&gt; course?)\n\nThis is just not so. I wrote an article for onlamp about REST and\nAJAX.\n\nI *know* that other people have written similarly good\narticles (Prescod&#39;s stuff is good, as previously stated). You&#39;re not\nlooking hard enough.\n\nYou&#39;re point about implementation details is a good one - we need more\nand more articles explaining how to do something (say content\nnegotiation) and why we do it RESTfully and why that&#39;s better than any\nother way.\n\n\nBut we&#39;re not going to get those articles by arguing about singular vs\nplural here.\n\nYou should pick singular or plural and then let somebody change your\nmind later if they feel strongly about it.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
