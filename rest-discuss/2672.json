I classify the response to a POST \n&gt; as a result,\n&gt; not a representation, because my reading is that while a POST \n&gt; might affect\n&gt; a resource&#39;s state, it does not return a representation of \n&gt; it; rather, it\n&gt; returns the results of processing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Nottingham\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
