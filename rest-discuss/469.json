However, not all notifications are\n&gt; boolean, the same way that not all resources are boolean. Sometimes a\n&gt; subscription is created for more than just knowing *when* state changes.\n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s created to know *how* state changes.\n\nWe *could* model our resources such that all notifications are boolean.\nFor instance you would get a notification that a thousand page document\nhas changed. Then the client uses some WebDAV/DeltaV magic to get a diff\nfrom the version it has to the version the server has.\n\nI like the idea of idempotent notifications because it means that the\nlistener could go off the network for seven hours and get &quot;back in sync&quot;\non the very first notification it gets, or even before it gets a\nnotification. So for instance if we were in a chat session and I get cut\noff then my chat client could miss a bunch change notifications but sync\nup whenever it wanted to. Loose coupling.\n\nSo I would say that if an &quot;event&quot; is important enough that a client\nwants to know WHAT changed, not just WHEN it changed then the event\nshould be reified in the server as a resource and persist for some\nnumber of hours or days, unless deleted.\n\nAs an *optimization*, it may make sense to have message bodies with\n&quot;diffs&quot;. But if you detected that you had missed one it would be no big\ndeal because you could just sync up.\n\nCan you describe an application that is better modeled with\nnon-idempotent notifications?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
