Any interaction between components is susceptible to\nindependent implementations - which gives rise to the need for all of\nus to learn how to play well with each other.\nWhen the caching behavior is described by a protocol specification,\nthen the &#39;independence&#39; of the implementations is reduced.\nThe specifications in these cases usually was derived from the\ncommonality of already working software, but as new software is built\nthere is always a risk that it isn&#39;t interoperable.\n\nTalking about &#39;not being RESTful&#39; is one way to educate implementors\nto the issues and keep honest people honest.\n\nOn 11/21/06, Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to guess that a cache that sees a PUT will be able to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; return that data, and when it sees a DELETE it can remove the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; entry. If you use a different method with a different resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ID, I doubt the cache can do it&#39;s thing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But maybe not - caching is always more subtle than I think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Isn&#39;t one of the problems with caching is that caching behavior is dependent\n&gt; upon numerous independent implementations for which few if any shared the\n&gt; exact same implementation criteria and thus many made independent\n&gt; engineering decisions?\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, a bit like the Tower of Babble?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n"}}
