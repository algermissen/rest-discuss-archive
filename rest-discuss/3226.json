Mike Dierken was to put\n&gt; &gt; the order number in the uri.  Easy to interpret, totally not opaque.\n&gt; &gt; The client must know the significance of the final URI component in\n&gt; &gt; order to use the service.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some discussions I have seen in the past (sorry, don&#39;t remember where\nthough\n&gt; probably on this list) had argued that if the server were telling the\nclient\n&gt; how to construct the URI, then the URI was still effectively opaque.  In a\n&gt; way, I agree with this, though I can&#39;t tell you why.  It just &quot;feels\nright&quot;\n&gt; somehow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone else remember this discussion?\n\nI think it might have been spawned by Paul Prescod&#39;s &quot;First Principles&quot;\npaper.  It &quot;feels right&quot; because if the instructions are expressed in a\ngeneric\nlanguage, then the client doesn&#39;t need the extra coupling to server-specific\nprotocol.\n\n/walden\n\n\n"}}
