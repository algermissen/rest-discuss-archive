This resource does not have \na HTTP URI, although it may have a URI in a local namespace, such as a \nfilename.\n\nAs was described before, the company logo resource can maintain its own\npolicy for accepting PUTs, depending on its internal nature (a PNG file,\nan SVG file that gets rendered, a program drawing the logo on the fly, who\nknows).\n\nSo:\n\t- resource is a concept\n\t- representation is a stream of bytes you can mess around with\n\nAnyone have better definitions?
