I&#39;ve pinged Rohit to confirm this, will\nreport back with his response.  (I.e., there&#39;s a big difference between the\nkind of &quot;routing&quot; that e.g. KN does and Henrik&#39;s path-based addressing\nproposal.)\n\nIt&#39;s important to understand that there are many and different possible\nformulations of app-level routing in general and HTTP routing in particular,\nand that the latter does not imply or require path-based addressing and\nroute transparency on the client.  Further, there are many other potential\ncompositional metaphors, declarative and otherwise, that do not imply or\nrequire &quot;routing&quot; in any meaningful sense.  Considering only traditional\n&quot;synchronous&quot; HTTP, some of the alternatives (non-exclusive) are:\n\nProxying\n--------\n\nThe standard proxy scheme can be considered a form of routing, indeed a\ntruly static form.  While clients must have explicit knowledge of the first\nproxy in the chain, the proxy is otherwise transparent and their is no\nimpact on the addressing scheme.\n\n\nPath-based addressing\n---------------------\n\nPath-based addressing is the &quot;bang path&quot; style we&#39;ve been discussing;  the\nclient explicitly specifies a series of intermediaries by embedding the path\nin an address (URI) construction.  This is both inflexible and problematic,\nparticularly when considering the issues of crossing administrative domains.\nNote that this *REQUIRES* URI construction and is a form of &quot;generative\nnaming,&quot; therefore violating the Axiom of Opacity.  (For what that&#39;s worth.)\nOn the upside, its implementation is trivial:  it is merely a form of\nproxying where the proxy chain is explicitly specified in the URI.\n\n\nDestination-based addressing\n----------------------------\n\nThe alternative to path-based addressing to drive routing decisions is using\nthe destination address and assuming some underlying machinery to resolve\nthe address route the message.  HTTP currently employs this sort of scheme;\nthe underlying machinery is DNS and the assumption, modulo &quot;static&quot; routes\nthrough transparent proxy chains, is direct connection between client and\nserver.\n\n\n3xx + Topology\n--------------\n\nAnother possible routing scheme arranges servers in a graph topology such as\na Plaxton mesh, and distributes partial information (e.g. Bloom filters on\nper-server object hash tables) about contents across the topology to be used\nin routing decisions.  A client is &quot;routed&quot; across the graph by means of 3xx\nredirect from each intermediate server acting on their partial routing\ninformation.\n\n\nNamespace Composition\n---------------------\n\nNamespace composition can be considered a form of proxying where the client\nhas no idea that proxies are involved.  In this scenario, some server A\n&quot;mounts&quot; a portion of server B&#39;s namespace into A&#39;s own namespace.  Requests\nto A for objects in that portion of its namespace are --- transparently to\nthe client --- proxied to B, with reponses (possibly filtered or\ntransformed) flowing back through A to the client.\n\n\nThese are just a few of the possibilities.  When you introduce asynchrony,\nthe possibilities get even richer.  My $0.02:  let&#39;s not jump to the\nconclusion that SOAP routing == &quot;SOAP Routing&quot; / &quot;WS-ROUTING&quot; in the Henrik\net. al. sense, or that routing HTTP requires path-based addressing...\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
