So if the server responds to a DELETE with 404,\n&gt; what it’s saying is that the DELETE was a no-op: there was no\n&gt; resource bound to that URI before, and there isn’t one now.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2xx is the right response to DELETE when the server wants to say\n&gt; “this URI used to be bound to a resource, but at your request, it\n&gt; no longer is.” In other words, 2xx is the status to return in the\n&gt; case of an actual, successful deletion.\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re right, of course -- but in context, we were actually discussing\n404/410 as a response to subsequent GET requests, not the response to\nthe DELETE request itself.  Sorry for the confusion.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
