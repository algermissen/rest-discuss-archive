In Wirebird&#39;s case, since its messages are mailing-list/ \n&gt; webforum posts, and thus shared, the range includes the read marker  \n&gt; and eventually any other flags (favoriting, etc.) that are specific  \n&gt; to a single user.\n&gt;\n&gt; Likewise with user credentials: you expose the password as its own  \n&gt; resource, rather than doing a partial update.\n\nThat would be\n\n     PUT /users/{id}/password\n\n     password={password}&password_confirmation={password_confirmation}\n\n?\n\n&gt; If you haven&#39;t read the RESTful Web Services book, I strongly  \n&gt; recommend doing so. Plenty of examples of how solving most REST  \n&gt; &quot;problems&quot; is really just finding the right resource to expose.\n\nYes I have read it from cover to cover and understand that. I know  \nthat I can resend the message, I know I can define an ad-hoc resource.  \nWhat I am unsure about is what is _disallowed_ or legal but discouraged.\n\nIf I had written the password update on my own I would have been  \nunsure about its correctness, because I am sending data to create a  \nlogical resource (I don&#39;t store passwords) that indeed is a backdoor  \nat the modification of another resource. I can&#39;t defend that makes any  \nsense on my own. In fact it feels like an unnatural design for the  \nsake of sticking to a pattern.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
