For \nexample, say I have a resource at some URI that is xhtml containing a \nset of key/value pairs or something like that. Would it be \nappropriate/allowed/whatever to PUT an application/x-www-form-urlencoded \nentity that replaces the key/value pairs of the resource with that URI?\n\nStan Dyck\n\nAristotle Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; * Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; [2009-01-09 02:00]:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Just change your XML schemas to have optional elements/\n&gt;&gt; attributes. I guarantee that once REST becomes mainstream\n&gt;&gt; everybody will be defining their own XML data formats anyways.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; If you do that, then PUTting a document with omitted elements and\n&gt; attributes means they should be deleted from the existing record,\n&gt; not persisted from the previous state of the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT is an assertion by the client that after request processing,\n&gt; the full state of the resource should correspond to the provided\n&gt; entity and nothing but the provided entity. Now the server is\n&gt; free to implement this any way it wants, which it has to be, in\n&gt; order to be able to normalise the data, insert timestamps, add\n&gt; metadata, provide thumbnails for pictures, or suchlike. It must\n&gt; therefore be free to make assumptions about the entity that the\n&gt; client did not specify explicitly.\n&gt;\n&gt; So people squint and say that inserting data into the new state\n&gt; of the resource that comes from its previous state falls under\n&gt; this. But the PUT request should be self-contained. If the result\n&gt; of the server’s pre-processing is a resource state which from the\n&gt; client’s perspective contradicts in semantically significant ways\n&gt; the client-asserted resource state (and that is clearly the case\n&gt; when you are using PUT as a make-believe PATCH), then you are\n&gt; breaking the PUT contract and your interface is no longer HTTP’s\n&gt; uniform interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you don’t like the fully general diff formats for PATCH,\n&gt; invent an app-specific one. That’s what media types are for. This\n&gt; approach is not a good solution in the big picture (see Bill’s\n&gt; recent post about Snowflake APIs[1]), but it is still a *much*\n&gt; better idea than breaking the uniform interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]: http://www.dehora.net/journal/2009/01/09/snowflake-apis/\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
