The complexity is that the  \n&gt; rdf:about value&#39;s semantics become ambiguous; for a Container, is  \n&gt; the type declaration about the unparameterized URI (which it is,  \n&gt; per RDF), or is it about the URI-with-query-param, which seems to  \n&gt; be what you want since that&#39;s where the data will get POSTed.\n\nAh, you are right - killer argument :-)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; To avoid that complexity, you could either tack on some triples if  \n&gt; what you&#39;re posting is RDF\n\nYes, thought about that, but I thought that would introduce a compile- \ntime coupling between processor and submitter since there is no  \nstandard (as with indexParam) way to tell the submitter what triples  \nto add.\n\nHmm...maybe this issue could be approached by seeing it as an  \n&#39;extended intent&#39;, where the parameterization is a specialization of  \nthe intend,not the processor. Just a thought though.\n\n&gt; (or use whatever must-ignore extensibility mechanism your POSTed  \n&gt; format has, if any).  If that&#39;s not an option, perhaps a multipart/ \n&gt; form-data approach could be used, which I suppose could use some  \n&gt; first-class support in RDF Forms.\n\nDo you have a use case for this in mind? Or just to cover it, too?\n\nThanks for the answers.\n\nJan\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n_______________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer                         \nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;   \nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
