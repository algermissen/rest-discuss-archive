Fielding&lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If you find yourself in need of a distributed transaction\n&gt; protocol, then how can you possibly say that your architecture\n&gt; is based on REST? I simply cannot see how you can get from one\n&gt; situation (of using RESTful application state on the client and\n&gt; hypermedia to determine all state transitions) to the next\n&gt; situation of needing distributed agreement of transaction semantics\n&gt; wherein the client has to tell the server how to manage its own\n&gt; resources.\n\nWhat I have in mind is a coordinator (a client) keeping track of the\nstate of a transaction, and using normal REST interactions with\nparticipating server-managed resources to coordinate an agreement.\n\nI have not worked out all the details, but does that seem feasible to you?\n\nIf so, I will try to work out more details and post them here.\n\nIf not, I will still need to do something like that, but won&#39;t call it\nREST, and won&#39;t bother this list with the topic again.\n\n&gt; Most likely, the system you are thinking of is just doing\n&gt; CRUD operations on multiple servers. Each of those actions\n&gt; might be based on a RESTful architecture. When all of them\n&gt; are done and the client makes a final request to approve or\n&gt; cancel the changes, it might be interacting with a TM-style\n&gt; manager resource that tells all of the other services to commit\n&gt; the associated changes to a more persistent or public set of\n&gt; resources, just like a staging server might be used to prepare\n&gt; content prior to publication. The sum of all those actions\n&gt; might be equivalent to an ACID transaction.\n\nWon&#39;t follow all the ACID rules.  In particular, won&#39;t be Isolated,\nand may or may not be Atomic.\n\n"}}
