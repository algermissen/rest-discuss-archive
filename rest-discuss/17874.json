Speakin=\r\ng in terms of Mike Amundsen&#39;s H-Factors, it covers quite a few.  I can even=\r\n live without support for DELETE and PUT.  However, I find that I want the =\r\nlink-relation stuff for things that aren&#39;t &lt;a&gt; or &lt;link&gt; elements.\n\nFor exa=\r\nmple, when the state of the application will support creating a new resourc=\r\ne, rather than a &lt;link&gt; element pointing to where I would POST the resource=\r\n, I would rather use a &lt;form&gt; element to make it explicit what may be poste=\r\nd there.  The @action attribute takes care of where to post it, but what wo=\r\nuld I use for the equivalent of @rel here to show the relationship from the=\r\n current application state?\n\nAre there any conventions for this? Or is what=\r\n I&#39;m doing unusual or even unwise?\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
