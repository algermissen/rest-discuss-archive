REST does not allow the client to know that the server\nis a relational database.  Therefore, it only allows requests on\nresources established by the server via its defined URIs (any resource\ncan be crafted similar to a stored procedure) or queries.  Naturally,\na query can be constructed to pass all of the information for a\nSELECT statement, but it would still separate the client from the\nserver implementation by not allowing the client to send arbitrary SQL.\n\nDay Software&#39;s Communique (my employer) does that by providing both\nthe table cell addressing hierarchy and URI mappings to stored\nprocedures/queries.\n\nThe rationale for REST being different from RDA, aside from greater\nflexibility of implementation, is that remote data access interfaces\nare extremely susceptible to abuse by rogue clients.  DBs are simply\nnot designed for anarchic scalability -- only friendly scalability.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
