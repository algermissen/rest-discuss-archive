Are there other (better) ways?  Any comments?  /Roger\n\nI&#39;m not sure where my version of this verb/URI issue stands, but here is the way\nI have designed it in my own efforts.  As I mentioned before, I have a\npre-developed set of resource types, namely methods, components, topics, queues,\netc that are published in a node&#39;s hierarchical namespace.  Each type is a\ndifferent type of abstraction, but all of them have methods that can be invoked.\nHere is the way I see how each of the HTTP methods allow nodes to interact with\nthem:\n\n------\n\nHTTP GET - allows you to ask a node to return information about a resource at a\nURI.  In the case of a method resource, the results of a HTTP GET with\n/Fruit/Apple/Washington/harvest might look like this:\n\n &lt;item key=&#39;harvest&#39; type=&#39;method&#39;&gt;\n    &lt;list&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;baseName&#39; value=&#39;harvest&#39; /&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;baseName&#39; value=&#39;cosecha&#39; scope=&#39;/Language/ES /&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;optionalParam&#39; type=&#39;boolean&#39;&gt;param5Name&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;requiredParam&#39; type=&#39;singleText&#39;&gt;param5Name&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;requiredParam&#39; type=&#39;multiText&#39;&gt;param4Name&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;requiredParam&#39; type=&#39;singleSelect&#39;&gt;param1Name&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item key=&#39;optionalParam&#39; type=&#39;multiSelect&#39;&gt;param2Name&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/list&gt;\n &lt;/item&gt;\n\nSo a GET really only lets you to discover the resource.  Obviously, if you had a\nXSL converter, the above XML is easily converted into an HTML form that a\nbrowser can use to can actually invoke the method.\n\nHTTP PUT - instead of getting a pre-existing resource like the one above, it\nallows you to effectively copy a resource in its current state to another node.\nYou are effectively publishing it on the destination node.\n\nHTTP POST - in the case of method resources, like the one above, this is as\nclose as you get to the &quot;verb&quot; notion, where POST has optional/required\nparameters that have been specified in the body and/or request line&#39;s query\nstring.\n\nHTTP DELETE - deletes the published resource at the URI.\n\n------\n\nIn essence, even though the URI provides you with the location of a method\nresource on the network, it&#39;s not pointing to a verb per se.  It is pointing to\nthe verb &quot;as a noun&quot;.  Once you POST to it, then that&#39;s when you submit\ninformation to the resource being hosted by the server, and in this case, the\nharvest method uses it to invoke behavior.\n\nHow far on or off base is this approach to REST?  Do the REST purists out there\nagree with it?  Would this be more noun-like or verb-like?\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n\n"}}
