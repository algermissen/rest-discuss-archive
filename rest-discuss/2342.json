It is clearly *not*\nthe case for all sequenced uses of GET and PUT on the same URI, but\nthat&#39;s ok, it doesn&#39;t need to be to make that statement in 2616 correct.\n\nI agree that RFC 2616 could be clearer here, but to me it seems pretty\nclear what it&#39;s intent is in talking about this stuff.  For example,\ninstead of &quot;sequence of methods&quot; in 8.1.2.2 it should say &quot;sequence of\nrequests&quot;.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
