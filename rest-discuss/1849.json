Is there a reference somewhere that maps GET/POST/PUT/DELETE into\n&gt; all or most of the other URI (although I suspect just URL) schemes?\n\nHere is my interpretation of the claims that have been made: the REST\nmodel is appropriate to solving all of the same problems that other\nInternet application protocols solve. In other words email (for example)\ncould benefit from REST discipline and could use HTTP across the wire.\nIf that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking about then here&#39;s one preliminary mapping\nI&#39;ve done for email:\n\n * http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/\n\nI would not say that &quot;REST applies to all Web protocols.&quot; For one thing,\nI don&#39;t have a clear definition of &quot;Web protocol.&quot; Arguably HTTP is the\nonly widely deployed protocol that knows about &quot;the Web&quot; and has been\nadopted by the W3C as a core technology. (One could argue that SOAP fits\ntoo and it would probably be simpler to agree to disagree rather than\nattempt to establish a test of Web-ness)\n\nI certainly do not think of SMTP as either guided by REST or based upon\nthe Web.\n\n&quot;For example, the Web&#39;s primary transfer protocol is HTTP, but the\narchitecture also includes seamless access to resources that originate\non pre-existing network servers, including FTP [107], Gopher [7], and\nWAIS [36]. Interaction with those services is restricted to the\nsemantics of a REST connector. This constraint sacrifices some of the\nadvantages of other architectures, such as the stateful interaction of a\nrelevance feedback protocol like WAIS, in order to retain the advantages\nof a single, generic interface for connector semantics.&quot;\n\n&quot;If an application needs the additional capabilities of another\narchitecture, it can implement and invoke those capabilities as a\nseparate system running in parallel, similar to how the Web architecture\ninterfaces with &quot;telnet&quot; and &quot;mailto&quot; resources.&quot;\n\n *\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
