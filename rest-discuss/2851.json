Roy&#39;s point is\n&gt; that a uniform interface drives integration complexity to O(N) (which\n&gt; was Jeff&#39;s earlier comment)\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n\nA couple of minor points on big O.  First &quot;uniform interface drives\nintegration complexity to O(N)&quot; is too easy to be true.  It doesn&#39;t\ntake into account that while there is much similarity among peer businesses,\nthere is also individuality, a/k/a competitive edge, which mandates, to\na degree, custom interfaces.  &quot;Uniform interface&quot; is like &quot;software process\nimprovement&quot;.  You use it to factor away known redundancy, but no more.\nAny time POST doesn&#39;t mean &quot;add this to a list&quot;, uniformity is only\nskin deep.\n\nSecondly, your position in the scheme of things determines whether you,\npersonally will feel integration as O(N) or O(N^2) or something else.\nBasically, God is the only one with the N^2 problem, because it&#39;s the\nsystem view of the system.  An individual newcomer to a party without\nuniform interfaces causes an integration problem (for itself and all others\nwho wish to integrate with him) with a sum total of O(N).  Over time,\nfrom historical (God) perspecive, you would observe the N^2 thing, but\nit&#39;s not a price paid daily.\n\nThank you.\n\nWaldne\n\n"}}
