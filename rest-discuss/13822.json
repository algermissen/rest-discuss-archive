We leverage Spring MVC facilities to be able to d=\r\nesign the server side to answer DELETE request for resources.\n\nNow as we se=\r\nrver HTML in the default case, it&#39;s a requirement to present a web page to =\r\nexplicitly confirm the deletion of the resource. Wearing the REST glasses I=\r\n wonder how to handle this requirement? I see two options:\n\n1. Exposing the=\r\n confirmation request as separate resource reachable via GET, that returns =\r\na HTML representation including the form to trigger the actually intended D=\r\nELETE request via HTML form quirks.\n\n2. Append a request parameter (e.g. ?c=\r\nonfirm=3Dtrue) to the DELETE request to indicate there are &quot;options&quot; on the=\r\n request method (in my case true would return the HTML representation of th=\r\ne confirmation page).\n\nFrom a simple like/dislike standpoint I&#39;d prefer the=\r\n second option as I do not have to introduce a somewhat artificial addition=\r\nal resource. Nevertheless I do not feel weel with 2, as it clearly weakens =\r\nthe contract that comes with DELETE.\n\nAny ideas, opinions, thaughts?\n\nRegar=\r\nds,\nOllie\n\n\n"}}
