That (and the rest you wrote) makes good sense. But I still feel =\r\nsorry for the cats that get kicked when someone mints a new media type.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Why?\n\nNot because I am going to kick them, I believe myself to be complet=\r\nely aligned with your opinion. It&#39;s just that Mike and Eric&#39;s comment (http=\r\n://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18127), about kicking a=\r\n cat every time a new media type is minted, is contrary to your view on med=\r\nia types. They may although be referring to different scenarios?\n\n&gt; And sur=\r\ne, in m2m contexts, you have to take care not to suffer media type bloat. O=\r\nTH, the latter will be much better than XML schema and RPC-API bloat.\n\nYes,=\r\n having a (enterprise) central definition of a quote representation must be=\r\n way better than ten different departments having each their own SOAP/schem=\r\na for that.\n\nThanks, J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
