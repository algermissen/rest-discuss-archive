If you&#39;re using some other registry,\n&gt; then don&#39;t re-use IANA syntax, if you&#39;re unwilling to tunnel.  But\n&gt; don&#39;t assume you&#39;re not better off tunneling, if you&#39;re not using\n&gt; IANA, regardless of syntax.\n&gt; \n\nThe argument I&#39;ve given is that this isn&#39;t just a REST requirement,\nit&#39;s fundamental to instantiating any style on the Web which is based\naround a separation of resource and representation by using Content-\nType to declare a processing model, which strives to be a uniform\ninterface network-based API by imposing a self-descriptiveness\nconstraint.\n\nIOW, the meta-style is distributed hypermedia application protocol,\nwhich may be a uniform interface network-based API, or not, i.e. a\nlibrary-based API.  This architectural distinction, sans registry, is\nalso central to the uniform interface of Gopher, which is a different\nstyle from REST.  Gopher is a distributed hypermedia application\nprotocol which may also be instantiated as either network-based or\nlibrary-based, depending on whether messaging is self-descriptive or\nnot.\n\nAside from Gopher, and aside from REST, HTTP may be used as a protocol\nto instantiate some other style of distributed hypermedia application\narchitecture.  Such a style would also use self-descriptiveness as a\nconstraint between being library-based or network-based, and thus also\nrequire the IANA registry for use on the Web, if that style were also\nintended to have a uniform interface.\n\nThis is derived from Chapter 6.5, which describes the general\narchitectural lessons learned from applying the REST style to Web\narchitecture.  In general, any uniform interface instantiated using\nHTTP over the Internet, RESTful or not, will require the re-use of the\nIANA registry, or attempt to extend HTTP to include alternatives to the\nIANA registry, because self-descriptiveness is endemic to any uniform\ninterface style for distributed hypermedia applications, which, if\nthey&#39;re using HTTP over the Internet, means there&#39;s a registry which\ndefines self-descriptive messaging.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
