Since \n&gt; we can already use an &quot;Expires&quot; header to define how long it is OK to \n&gt; cache this response (if it was a GET request), it seems to me that a \n&gt; client should also be able to assume that the links included in the \n&gt; representation will be valid for at least that long (either directly, or \n&gt; because the server will redirect you to an updated URI if needed).\n&gt; \n&gt; They might be valid for a lot longer than that, of course, but this \n&gt; seems like a good design to communicate the minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig McClanahan\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Sep 28, 2009 at 8:29 PM, Noah Campbell &lt;noahcampbell@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:noahcampbell@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     I was thinking about the finality of links after I posted it.  There\n&gt;     is nothing you can do to prevent a link from being bookmarked and\n&gt;     I&#39;d suggest that you don&#39;t worry about it.  All webservers have the\n&gt;     defaults semantics built in when a link is requested that is no\n&gt;     longer exists it returns a 404.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     If a service is much more robust, accessing a dead link would\n&gt;     redirect it to something meaningful, maybe a the &quot;top&quot; of the app or\n&gt;     the &quot;top&quot; of the entity.  This is optional and requires some more\n&gt;     thought in how you implement your service but may be worth its\n&gt;     weight in gold when you need to upgrade.\n&gt; \n&gt;     It is worth exploring more, in my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt;     -Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     On Mon, Sep 28, 2009 at 6:33 PM, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:willh@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;         On Sat, Sep 26, 2009 at 4:00 PM, Noah Campbell\n&gt;         &lt;noahcampbell@... &lt;mailto:noahcampbell@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;          &gt;\n&gt;          &gt; I think for entities it&#39;s fine, especially if you want to\n&gt;         leverage caching\n&gt;          &gt; middleware.  However, these entities may have links that need to\n&gt;          &gt; be followed and not bookmarked.\n&gt; \n&gt;         The only difference between following a link and a &quot;bookmark&quot; is the\n&gt;         lifespan of the link itself. Since we&#39;re dealing with a stateless\n&gt;         protocol, a link is a link is a link, with appropriate payloads.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Is there some mechanism to tell whether a link is &quot;valid&quot; or not\n&gt;         other\n&gt;         than following it and auditing the response? Whether that link\n&gt;         is 10ms\n&gt;         or 10years old, the client behavior is the same: a bad link is a bad\n&gt;         link is a bad link. I don&#39;t know how to convey a retry mechanism, or\n&gt;         policy, or whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt;         So it seems to me it boils down to what &quot;out of band&quot; behavior is\n&gt;         promised to the resource consumers has more applicability on the use\n&gt;         of an &quot;old link&quot; than anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;         Will Hartung\n&gt;         (willh@... &lt;mailto:willh@...&gt;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
