REST imposes a discipline that\nleads to more interoperable applications. SOAP advocates only see the\ndiscipline and not the interoperability benefits. SOAP makes almost no\ndemand on application developers. In all seriousness you can take a\nproprietary binary protocol and claim that it is legal SOAP and justify\nit through the SOAP specification!\n\nThis issue of interoperability versus &quot;flexibility&quot; is discussed more\nhere:\n\n * http://www.prescod.net/rest/rest_vs_soap_overview/\n\nThere is obviously nothing in HTTP that prevents querying using XML\nQuery or XSLT over POST but it is usually not good REST design. In fact,\nit is usually not good *distributed application design*. Sending XML\nQuery is like sending arbitrary SQL over the network. Sending XSLT is\nlike sending executable code. Neither makes sense across the trust\nboundaries that make the Internet so interesting.\n\nI&#39;ve discussed this here:\n\n * http://www.prescod.net/rest/rpc_for_get.html\n\nIf you redesign your service interface to use the Web&#39;s query model\nrather than XML Query&#39;s, you get better security, better addressability,\nbetter interoperability and a simpler interface to boot.\n\n&gt; ... Also, SOAP&#39;s message model allows me to qualify queries\n&gt; through use of transport-neutral headers. \n\nIf you and your partner agree to use SOAP you have to implement SOAP\nhandlers on both ends. If you and your partner agree to use HTTP you\nhave to implement HTTP handlers on both ends. HTTP headers are equally\n&quot;transport neutral&quot;. They don&#39;t care whether you are using TCP or some\nproprietary protocol.\n\n&gt; ... For example, I may not have\n&gt; HTTP-based access to your machine, yet I may still want to send a\n&gt; SOAP request (over Jabber perhaps) that queries something on your\n&gt; box. \n\nWhat box in the world has Jabber but not HTTP? What implementation\nlanguage is the jabber engine implemented in which is lacking an HTTP\nserver like the free ones you can download for Java, Python, Perl, C,\n...\n\n&gt; ....By adopting the SOAP messaging model, I can express any number\n&gt; of aspects of my query (e.g., signatures, privacy requirements,\n&gt; idempotency, cache control) using fairly rich XML-based\n&gt; headers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nThere are obviously standard HTTP headers for cache control and privacy.\nIdempotency is guaranteed by the methods (headers for idempotency don&#39;t\nmake much sense to me). Signatures are no problem although I haven&#39;t\nseen that done myself.\n\nSo Don is saying that with SOAP you *could do* all of these wonderful\nthings in the future and I say that with HTTP you *can do* most of these\nwonderful things using existing standards today.\n-- \n&quot;When I walk on the floor for the final execution, I&#39;ll wear a denim \nsuit. I&#39;ll walk in there like Willie Nelson, John Wayne, Will Smith \n-- Men in Black -- James Brown. Maybe do a Michael Jackson moonwalk.&quot;\nCongressman James Traficant.\n\n"}}
