The\n&gt; identified resource is deleted. If you delete it once or twice, it&#39;s\n&gt; still deleted and the response should be the same.\n\nI guess so,. but S3 still returns 404, or, as my unit tests point out\n\nRestletOperationException:: DELETE on\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/smartfrogtest : Status code 404 is out of\nrange of 200-299,\n\nthat is, delete a bucket and you get a 404 back. I guess it is a way\nto return an idempotent response without ever having to remember if\nthe remote resource ever existed in the past.\n\n"}}
