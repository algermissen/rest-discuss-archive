There is no guarantee that \nhttp://example.com/customer/2345 is the next unused resource name. I \ncontend there is no way to _reliably_ determine what the next unused \nresource name is.\n\nPossible solutions are:\n\n1. PUT to http://example.com/customer/FinishingFactory\nand get the actual resource name used returned in some fashion.\nEither as a redirect or response body like\n&lt;customer xlink:href=&quot;http://example.com/customer/2349&quot;/&gt;\n\n2. Never use sequential resource names. Then each client that\nadds a new resource can use a scheme for coming up with a universal\nunique identifier, which would lead to resources named like:\n  http://example.com/customer/ajd82hdueofnsk34iuvnk2kai9fkfj1jfkmn\n\nUsually when I have REST questions I just look to the www to get the answer\nunfortunately PUT is not used nearly enough on the web to work out the \nanswer.\n\n\n\n"}}
