I guess I&#39;m just not getting how posting two\n&gt; images to a URL is resource modeling.\n\nThe question isn&#39;t what you&#39;re posting, it&#39;s what you&#39;re posting *to.*\n\n&gt; Suppose there was another argument, that had one\n&gt; of two values: isTerrorist | isFed\n&gt;\n&gt; Would that make it non-Restful?\n\nWhat makes something RESTful isn&#39;t what you&#39;re posting, its how you present the service\nin HTTP / URI-space.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand why SMTP doesn&#39;t do what you\n&gt; want.\n\nThis is a *very simple* point.  Listen closely.  It doesn&#39;t do what we want it to so\nbecause it doesn&#39;t present as resources that can be interacted with via the generic HTTP\ninterface.\n\n&gt; HTTP is inherently unreliable.  SMTP is only in\n&gt; practice unreliable because the implementations\n&gt; suck.\n\nThis is a red herring at best, wrong at worst.  There&#39;s no reason to believe SMTP is any\nmore or less reliable than HTTP --- indeed, given the DNS-driven and routed nature of\nSMTP it&#39;s architecturally *more* susceptible to reliability problems than HTTP.\n\n&gt; Ok.  So the big bonus here is that my email\n&gt; address is http://i2x.com/~alex rather than\n&gt; alex@....  GETting this URL would retrieve my\n&gt; homepage or some form of status information and\n&gt; POSTing to it would send me an email.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting, but I guess I just don&#39;t see so much\n&gt; value there.\n\nCan&#39;t help you there.  Keep thinking about it.\n\n&gt; They are all fine.  What I fail to get is what\n&gt; exactly you don&#39;t like about RPC.\n\nIt creates new namespaces, and &quot;hides&quot; things that are more usefully exposed.  It also\ncompounds complexity and creates tighter coupling between the producer and consumer of\nsome information, service, etc.  It&#39;s also historically been a bad approach for building\nvast-scale distributed systems:  system built atop CORBA, DCOM, ONC, DCE, etc. have never\nhad the kind of deployment / adoption that the Web has had.  Why?  The REST hypothesis on\nthis is that it&#39;s inherently related to the nature of RPC vs. HTTP.\n\n&gt; &gt;  I still haven&#39;t seen any single point you&#39;ve raised that addresses Mark\n&gt; &gt; Baker&#39;s fundamental challenge, which is\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;Show me an application that I can&#39;t do with HTTP.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I answered this before.\n\nNope.\n\n&gt; My answer was show me\n&gt; an application that you can&#39;t do with SMTP.\n\nAnd we did this:  the Web.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
