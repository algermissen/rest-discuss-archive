The reason I din&#39;t go\nwith conneg is that the problem would not exist when we have\nstructured data with proper semantics and REST clients that understand\nthem and till we get there we have WYSIWYE:\nEdithttp://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mozilla/2003/10/03/mozile.html\n\nI am currently working on a REST GUI client along the lines of\nLiveHTTPheaders for testing and trying out REST based web-services.\nSay you have a resource /some-uri-space/xyz and you perform a GET on\nit using the REST client and it sent a XML or RDF representation which\nyou could edit and PUT back to the same resource, similar to how web\nservices would communicate with each other. I know this is a\nsimplistic example but this is how I think the semantic web should\nwork. Where the representations themselves have structure and\nsemantics and you don&#39;t need a Form to create/edit/delete them.\n\nConneg would play a role here in getting me the representation that my\nREST GUI client can provide a editable interface for.\n\nSandeep Shetty\n\n"}}
