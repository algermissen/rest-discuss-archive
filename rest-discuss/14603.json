All is well.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean by &quot;RESTful URL structure&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; A UR=\r\nL structure that represents resources that can return state and  \n&gt; perform=\r\n actions on them.\n\nHmm - but any URL represents a resource by definition an=\r\nd resources  \nhold state. I wonder why you even mentioned it. What kind of =\r\nactions  \ndo you think of?\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Something like this would be sent =\r\nfrom the server:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; {&quot;commands&quot;:[&quot;cmd1&quot;,&quot;cmd2],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Well, maybe - if you think of &#39;cmd&#39; in terms of &#39;next transition&#39;. If\n&gt;&gt; y=\r\nou UI reacts on the cmds received that would be good.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s the idea. =\r\nWe could also replace &quot;cmd1&quot; with URL&#39;s instead, so  \n&gt; that the client doe=\r\nsn&#39;t have to generate URL&#39;s, but then we need  \n&gt; more info to be sent, sim=\r\nilar to &lt;a&gt;&#39;s (rel+href attributes).\n\nWhat do you mean by &#39;generate URLs&#39;? =\r\nThe client should not do this  \n(only on the basis of a form or template it=\r\n receives) because it  \nintroduces coupling on out-of-band information (the=\r\n knowledge of the  \ndesired URI structure). If you use REST, use it all the=\r\n way through.  \nThe &#39;more info to be sent&#39; is the price you pay for the dec=\r\nreased  \ncoupling.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; With the above I can both get the data I need to=\r\n show, and know  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; what the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; user is allowed to do with it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I t=\r\nhink that is ok, if you context prevents simpler solutions (e.g.  \n&gt;&gt; use\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; HTML+browser in the first place).\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, that is not an option. We nee=\r\nd the more powerful UI features  \n&gt; of Swing, and also want to be able to c=\r\nonnect to several servers at  \n&gt; once in the UI.\n\nOk, see the point.\n\nJan\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; /Rickard\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMa=\r\nil: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http:/=\r\n/www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
