The entity format is specified by the media type\ngiven in the Content- Type header field. Depending upon the format\nand the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most\nappropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this\nspecification does not define any standard for such automatic\nselection.&quot;\n\nAre there any specifications or applications that do define such\nbehaviour? I have an application that needs to return a list of\nredirection URIs. If there is an existing practice for doing this,\nI&#39;ll follow that rather than define something new.\n\nFor the curious, an httpsy redirectory needs to be able to return\nat least two redirection URLs: one for outside the NAT clients and\none for inside the NAT clients.
