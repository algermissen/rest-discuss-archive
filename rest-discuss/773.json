This rule isn&#39;t\nused and AFAICT there&#39;s no way to get to it from the rules that are directly\nused in 2616, -wrt- path segments.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s a bit weird, but I imagine it&#39;s left as a hook for future use\n&gt; (Apache doesn&#39;t seem to support it, for example).\n\nI think it&#39;s a bit underspecified.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what your concern above is, but my reading is that\n&gt; it&#39;s allowed, as per RFC2396 Section 3.3.\n\nMy concern is just that, strictly from the spec, it&#39;s difficult to tell\nwhether &#39;@&#39; is kosher in path segments.  AFAICT it is, but the way the\ngrammars interact between the two RFCs makes it difficult to give an\nauthoritative answer;  some regexp-based URI parsers I&#39;ve seen get this\nwrong.\n\nThanks for the comments, very helpful!\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
