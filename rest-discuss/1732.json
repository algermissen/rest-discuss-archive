Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;In data manipulation, there are five basic possible actions: ADD,\nEDIT,\n&gt; DELETE, GET, and PUT&quot;\n&gt; Coming up with basic actions for data manipulation is a great start. I&#39;ve\n&gt; had problems with the particular ones from HTTP, as well as the ones from\n&gt; SQL.\n&gt; With ADD, what are you adding data to? Why isn&#39;t there a remove?\n\nThe actual use of the verbs is somewhat relative to the application.  In the\ncase of ADD, it is only useful in a situation where you want to &quot;add&quot;\nsomething to the target.  For instance, you might &quot;add&quot; a contact to a\ncontacts resource.  Using PUT is not necessarily sufficient here because you\nstill have to indicate that you want to add the resource.\n\nDELETE is the &quot;remove&quot;.\n\nTruthfully, data entry only has four verbs (3 push/1 pull): ADD, EDIT,\nDELETE, GET.  However, a problem one encounters in a loosely coupled system\nis that we don&#39;t always know which push verb to use.  This is why I include\nthe PUT operation.  This allows the source to &quot;loosely&quot; send data to the\ntarget.\n\nI should also point out that the verbs chosen in GTP are not related to HTTP\nverbs in any way, though a few are named the same.\n\n&gt; Interesting...\n&gt; I&#39;ll have to take some time with this paper. Thanks.\n\nYes, take a look.  I have tried to show some examples to clarify the verbs.\nIf you want more, I&#39;d be happy to give more.  Give me a scenario and let me\nsee if I can &quot;implement&quot; it in GTP.\n\n\nAlso, what do you think of the [potential] RESTfulness of GTP?  Am I at\nleast in the ballpark, as far as you see it?  Or is this approach not what\nREST is about?  I do have some doubts about the relationship between  REST\n&quot;state transfers&quot; and GTP.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
