If so, you&#39;d be very wrong... :)\n\n&gt; There isn&#39;t even any sense in which someone can speak ex \n&gt; cathedra about REST, and I personally wouldn&#39;t believe they \n&gt; were infallible if they could.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m for warring Mullahs. (Or autonomous High Priestesses, \n&gt; which is much the same but generally without as much bloodshed).\n\nAnd I used to like the way you think... &#39;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; Lots of books would be good.  Lots of books with comflicting \n&gt; &gt; descriptions of good REST would be bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good in some ways.\n&gt; \n&gt; The core idea of REST is simple. It&#39;s relatively simple to \n&gt; point out basic flaws in the core description of REST. Of \n&gt; course that doesn&#39;t make it impossible for people to write \n&gt; books, but an orchestrated campaign of book-burning is \n&gt; probably outside of our capabilities :) \n&gt; Bad books can&#39;t be \n&gt; prevented (why we have the term bullshildt in the first \n&gt; place, hey Shildt&#39;s publishers say he&#39;s an authority too) \n&gt; only good ones encouraged.\n\nI&#39;m not trying to prevent, just catalyze guidance for encouragement.  But\nyou have do coddle human nature &#39;cause you ain&#39;t gonna change it. \n\n&gt; Outside of that, when dealing with concrete cases matters \n&gt; will very quickly get into cases where differences of opinion \n&gt; will enter and also where matters outside of REST will have \n&gt; to be addressed (you can&#39;t cookbook without going beyond \n&gt; REST, your very first example will have to include some \n&gt; server settings or some code or at least some markup and \n&gt; immediately you&#39;ve got something there that isn&#39;t just REST).\n\nIn the case of differing opinions, you document both.\n\n&gt; Better to have disagreement than Lysenko-Michurinism.\n\nYou read far to much into my comments!  Well-respected guidance is not a bad\nthing.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve assumed that the whole community felt the need for his \n&gt; blessing \n&gt; &gt; based on comments from some. If I&#39;m wrong, then no need for \n&gt; Roy after all I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m of the opinion that Roy is an extremely smart person and \n&gt; very good at conveying his ideas to the rest of us, along \n&gt; with being the person who we all have a debt to in this \n&gt; matter. For that reason any effort with his support is \n&gt; probably a safer bet than any he thinks is a bad idea. That&#39;s \n&gt; not the same as needing him.\n\nWe don need no stinkin&#39; Roy! (with apologies to Mel Brooks...)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devolving into chaos is preferable to descending into a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; personality-cult.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not that I don&#39;t necessarily agree with, assuming the \n&gt; personality is \n&gt; &gt; benevolent.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it always has negative effects, even in the cases where \n&gt; those who are so favoured have the good nature not to offend \n&gt; their fans combined with modesty not to believe in the \n&gt; personality cult themselves (you mention TimBL elsewhere, \n&gt; from his writing sthe man seems to be composed of at least \n&gt; 60% modesty sometimes :)\n\nYour taking some of my comments way to seriously.\nBTW, I was quite impressed with the story in &quot;Weaving the Web.&quot; Maybe I was\nhoodwinked, who knows.\n\n&gt; &gt; I respectfully say this is an idealistic view that misunderstands \n&gt; &gt; human nature.  A large percentage of the population want to just be \n&gt; &gt; told what to do and how to do it, and for that they need a \n&gt; well known \n&gt; &gt; and well respected source.\n&gt; \n&gt; Point them to the code. \n\nWhose code?  And who does the pointing?  And when they point at differing\ncode?\n\nInteroperability doth not come from different viewpoints.\n\nModeration in all things. You might just be being a contrarian, but to hear\nyour arguments one would believe you support only full anarchy (well, maybe\n90% anarchy. :)\n\n&gt; Not to say a cookbook couldn&#39;t *also* help though. But \n&gt; writing code is the one thing that we&#39;re screwed if we don&#39;t do.\n\nI&#39;m all for code.  Assuming we can agree on what code to write and document\nthe disagreements.\n\n&gt; Yes, but we can&#39;t expect to be the one field were the experts \n&gt; all agree either.\n\nYou assumed that I said that. I didn&#39;t.  An authoritative source can say\nwhere there are equally good approached and/or multiple approaches each with\npros and cons. \n\n&gt; &gt; So what TimBL did for the web was not important?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think what TimBL did was shepherding market maturation either.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, there was some shepherding, or rather cat-herding, but \n&gt; that came from a mixture of relatively high-level education \n&gt; (which plenty here are already doing) and the W3C producing \n&gt; concrete specs (which isn&#39;t very directly applicable to what \n&gt; we&#39;re talking about apart from RFC 2616, and we don&#39;t need to \n&gt; write RFC 2616 because Roy et al already have) and TAG \n&gt; findings (quite a few of which already impact upon REST and \n&gt; already give us things to point to (or sadly to point away from).\n\nAre we nitpicking word definitions?  As I said to Nic, to-may-to, to-mah-to.\nGuiding REST on its path of growth and helping it to avoid the abysis.\nWhatever words you want to use.\n\n&gt; When it&#39;s being \n&gt; misused and salespeople are saying &quot;of course it can do that, \n&gt; it&#39;s RESTful&quot; in response to every customer query we&#39;ll have \n&gt; come a long way. \n\nWe&#39;ve come a long way already.  They are.\n\n&gt; Since I can&#39;t actually think of a single \n&gt; reason why most salespeople should have the vaugest clue \n&gt; hypermedia is better than &quot;the machine just knowing where \n&gt; everything is already&quot; so I can&#39;t get too upset that most won&#39;t.\n\nBut they COULD understand the pass/fail of a logo/certification program, for\nexample.  And it could be an open certification, i.e. people in the\ncommunity could be approved to certify so that open source could be\ncertified.\n\nOpen your mind to the possibilities...\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
