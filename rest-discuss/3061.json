The only reason \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m even considering documenting it is for use with SOAP.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Could you explain why this would be so specific to SOAP?  My \n&gt; understanding was that &quot;SET&quot; would be a way of storing or updating \n&gt; a resource in a way that is not as document-centric as PUT.\n\nThat&#39;s right.  I&#39;m just saying that SOAP requires it, which provides\nthe impetus necessary for me to proceed with it.  For regular XML/HTTP\nuse, you can always manage to get by with just PUT.\n\n&gt; This would be useful even in a pure XML/HTTP context and not just \n&gt; with SOAP.\n\nSure.\n\nJoe asks;\n&gt; Is there a reason not to just hook the processing off\n&gt; of a PUT with content-type: application/soap+xml?\n\nThe media type is just opaque representation metadata that is also\njust &quot;stored&quot;, as far as PUT is concerned; it isn&#39;t used for dispatch\nat all.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
