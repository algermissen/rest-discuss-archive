So the question is how to provide this functionality in a\n&gt;  RESTful way...\n&gt;\n&gt;  Would one create a resource &quot;validation&quot; and use the kind\n&gt;  (username/email/password) as subresource, so that there were URLs\n&gt;  like /validation/username/{username}, /validation/email/{email} etc.\n&gt;  that would allow GET?\n\nWhy not just HEAD /user/{username}? If the status code is 404 then it\nis free for use. If username isn&#39;t the UID for users in the URI you\ncan use queries for that: HEAD /user?username={username}. For email\nsomething similar can be used. You can have both username and email as\nUID to find a single user with HEAD /user/{uid}, if both identifiers\ngive an unique user, there&#39;s no reason to choose just one.\n\n&gt;  Or would it be better to have it at s.th.\n&gt;  like /username/validation/{username}, /email/validation/{email}\n\nUnless username and email are resources in your app, it makes more\nsense to go to the top level resource (i.e. user) and query it.\n\n&gt;  And what were possible response status codes? I&#39;d think this could\n&gt;  always be 200, with more details in the response body, as even a GET\n&gt;  with a username that is syntactically not correct would be a valid\n&gt;  request. Or should 200 be only returned if everything is ok, and 400 if\n&gt;  the email address is not correct, and 409 if the username is already\n&gt;  taken?\n\n400 for syntax errors (e.g. invalid characters in username/email)\nshould be ok. 409 shouldn&#39;t be used in this case, because the request\ncompleted without errors, a 409 should be issued only if the request\ncould not be completed.\n\n&gt;  I find it really hard to model such operations as resources, just to\n&gt;  mention this :)\n\nInstead of thinking about the interaction (i.e. validating a username)\ntry to focus on what resources are necessary to interact with. So we\ncan quickly figure out that the users resource is a good way to find\nan user by username, so we ask for it and if there&#39;s none we know the\nusername is available.\n\n&gt;  I&#39;m very thankful for any suggestions/advice!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Cheers,\n&gt;  Martin\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel Yokomizo.\n\n"}}
