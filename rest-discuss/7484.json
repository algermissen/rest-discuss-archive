We refactor code,\nestablish asias lookup schemes, and probably do a whole\nraft of other things to factor out redundancy noise in the interest\nof simplicity and clarity.\n\nObsolete stuff should get garbage collected.  In the system\nyou propose, that can&#39;t happen.  You are making identifiers too\nimportant, IMO.  More important than what they identify.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Benjamin Carlyle&quot; &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Bill Venners&quot; &lt;bv-svp@...&gt;; &quot;Roy T.

In that context I am very wary of\n: &gt; : language that talks about two resources being the &quot;same&quot;, even if the\n: &gt; : might happen to be equivalent for the forseeable future.\n: &gt; Problem is, without that &quot;Sameness&quot;, there is no notion of identity\n: &gt; at all, and no resource.  Everything is itself and perhaps something and\n: &gt; everything else from time to time.*  Who can live in a universe like\n: &gt; that?  You can&#39;t convict a murderer, because it was never him; it was\n: &gt; someone else who happened to &quot;demarcate the same state&quot;...\n: &gt; on that particular day.\n:\n: Well, you can&#39;t convict a resource. However you can put a proxy between\n: the resource and those who it might harm. The proxy could match requests\n: destined for http://example.com/thecriminal and treat them specially,\n: for example by rejecting them outright. If correspondance was still\n: possible via http://example.com/thecriminal? you would need to match\n: that too, but you might also need to match\n: http://example.com/thecriminalsbrother who is colluding with the\n: criminal to allow message exchanges to continue. Are the criminal and\n: the criminal&#39;s brother the same resource? No, though they are equivalent\n: in this context for the problem the proxy is trying to solve. Are\n: http://example.com/thecriminal and http://example.com/thecriminal? the\n: same resource? I would say no. One day the second resource might be\n: disabled when the bug that caused the urls to be handled equivalently is\n: fixed. Then they will no longer necessarily require identical treatment.\n:\n: I don&#39;t go for the sameness of resources or urls. I think sameness is a\n: concept that only really applies to urns in spaces where a single urn\n: couldn&#39;t be specified for technical reasons. Even then, if they are\n: equivalent... what purposes are they equivalent for? Can you guarantee\n: that they will be equivalent for every purpose I can conceive of? Same\n: is too loose a concept for me. I can only really define it one way: Is\n: the identification either identical or defined by the scheme to be\n: equivalent?\n:\n: So in answer to your question, a resource identified by a particular url\n: is the same as itself. That is all we need for the purposes of identity.\n: For other purposes we need more problem-specific concepts of equvalence\n: to make statements that can be understood.\n:\n: Benjamin.\n:\n:\n: __________ NOD32 1960 (20070106) Information __________\n:\n: This message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\n: http://www.eset.com\n:\n: \n\n\n"}}
