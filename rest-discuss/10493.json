That is, applications running on the grid can only\n&gt;  do things like &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, and &quot;take&quot; in order to interact\n&gt;  with the grid and the other applications running there.  So,\n&gt;  considering this framework, do these data grids constitute an\n&gt;  implementation  of REST?  If I build my applications on top of a data\n&gt;  grid, will I have a RESTful architecture?\n\nThat does indeed sound like a uniform interface, but REST is more than\njust that one constraint... or more precisely, the uniform interface\nitself is about more than just the methods.  A sub-constraint of the\nuniform interface constraint is the Hypermedia (... as the engine of\napplication state) constraint which I&#39;ve never seen used in any\nself-described Grid based system.  So no, probably not.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA. http://www.markbaker.ca\nCoactus; Web-inspired integration strategies http://www.coactus.com\n\n"}}
