I have to provide data in the request body (It could be a xml \n&gt; description or even an image). The request is safe. The response can&#39;t \n&gt; be cached since it depends on the request body. Moreover, the URL does \n&gt; not have to be shared. What are the problems of using POST in that \n&gt; situation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you aware of any problem with implementations or proxies for GET \n&gt; requests that contains a body?\n\nHard to say, see &lt;http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/19&gt;.\n\nOther than that, you may want to look at RFC 5323.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
