Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; Something that I&#39;ve run into is that (product) catalogs sometimes \nhave\n&gt; pricing embedded within the catalog - which causes the catalog to \nbe unique\n&gt; to individual receivers - vendors don&#39;t have or want uniform \npricing across\n&gt; customers. If their process cannot &#39;normalize&#39; out this information \ninto\n&gt; separate pricing documents then you get a huge amount of mostly \nredundant\n&gt; information across the system as a whole. \n\nAn excellent point.  Have you seen anybody do this normalization?  \nHow did it work out?\n\n&gt; &gt; I expect something like &#39;Business Protocols&quot; to become available \nsoon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I agree with you. I think they will evolve from the coalescing of \npockets of\n&gt; use, rather than from standardization organizations though.\n\nI expect both of us are right.  Here is some of my evidence for \norganizations working on common business protocols:\n* RosettaNet - electronics\n* CIDX, chemical, adopted a lot of RNet\n* PIDX, petroleum, adopting CIDX\n* agXML, agriculture, adopting CIDX\n* ebXML - took lots of ideas from RNet\n* RNet now adopting at least some of ebXML\n* AIAG, automotive, has previous X12 EDI standards, now adopting ebXML\n* HIPAA, health care, US government mandate\n* Travel (org?), adopting some of ebXML and also their own standards\n* UCC, retail, somewhat like travel\n* Telecom (org?), precursor to some of RNet\n\nOne point being that there is a lot of overlap and cross-referencing \nbetween orgs.  And whole bodies of commercial law and business \ncustoms underly all of these protocols.  Many of these people do \nunderstand that &quot;code rules&quot; and so are attempting to codify legal \nbusiness practices.\n\nAnd then some big companies like McDonalds and Walmart constitute \ntheir own little universes...\n\nAnother point being that you could make up your own business \nprotocols, but be aware you are planting in a field where a big gang \nplow is coming. It won&#39;t be as neat as the standards and industry \norgs and big companies like, but in many cases, you will be required \nto follow some standardized protocol in order to do business.\n\n\n"}}
