A client (if by\nthat you mean a client application like a browser) is a component in REST and\nis different from a connector. A connector presents an abstract interface for\ncomponent communication, the generality of which enables substitutability: if\nthe users&#39; only access to the system is via an abstract interface, the\nIMPLEMENTATION can be replaced without impacting the users.\n\nNow, resources can change over time but the semantics of the conceptual mapping\nto a set of entities is required to be static, since the semantics is what\ndistinguishes one resource from another.\n\nFrom what I understand, you guys are confusing the semantics of a request (as\nindicated by standard methods and media types) with the semantics of the\nmapping to a set of entities that is a resource.\n\nI think, this is what Roy meant in an earlier mail when he said:\n&quot;The interface is substitutable. Resources are not substitutable. Nobody has an\nexpectation that you can replace one resource with a different resource and\nhave continuation of semantics.&quot;\n\nIn the case of performing a query over POST, the semantics of the request and\ntherefore of the interaction between the components are uniform because nothing\nin the response control data was non-uniform and completely covered in REST.\n\nNote that REST does not say anything about resource expectations being uniform,\nit just talks constrains connector/component interfaces.\n\nSo when you say:\n&quot;If you write a client application that presumes the resource returned in the\nLocation header is a query result, and attempt to do further processing based\non that presumption, your client will fail against arbitrary resources.&quot;\n\nWhat you guys are talking about is the semantics of the mapping to a set of\nentities that is a resource and not the semantics of the interface.\n\nThat&#39;s like saying that if I expect a java applet from a GET request to a\nspecific resource I should expect a java applet at any other arbitrary\nresource!\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nMark: I am not a fan of SOA!\nHugh: Any luck finding Sarge?\n\nSandeep\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
