I think it&#39;s a matter of\n&gt; perception, but why do you think it&#39;s better to work something\n&gt; else even when the use case doesn&#39;t need more than what forms\n&gt; already provide?\n\nShort version: YAGNI is all well and good, but you can’t refactor\na protocol. That’s probably too cryptic, so let me make a feeble\nattempt to explain.\n\nThe main point is: I think AtomPub’s potential to disrupt is\ngreatly dependent on the fact that it is capable of covering 97%\nof all possible use cases, instead of just 85%. (Figures derived\nby posterior extraction.)\n\nWith narrower aspirations, application/x-www-url-encoded is\ncertainly fine and as a matter of fact I use that for the\nmajority of my work.\n\nNote too that there’s no reason someone couldn’t specify an\nAtomPub extension that would let clients operate a limited range\nof a collection’s features using application/x-www-url-encoded.\n\nBut in general, there is a strong pressure in protocols toward\nhaving fewer options and moving parts. RFC 3339 lays out the\nrationale nicely. So if you should restrict yourself to only a\nsingle choice, which one would that be? I think picking one that\nneither limits your reach nor is *too* complex is a natural\noutcome.\n\nF.ex., is it OK for application/x-www-url-encoded extension aware\nclients to not be able to operate the AtomPub service using Atom\nat all? It would seem to me that as long as the mapping is\nincomplete, there would be pressure on clients to acquire the\nability to operate the full feature set. But if you’re going to\nimplement application/atom+xml anyway, then also implemeting\napplication/x-www-url-encoded is no reduction in complexity for\nthe client.\n\nI could go on for another dozen of paragraphs, but the point is\nthat as far as I can see as yet, you are taking a programmer’s\nview to complexity, to which I am sympathetic as a programmer;\nhowever I am finding that concerns and evolutionary pressures in\nprotocols differ from code such that complexity and simplicity\nare rewarded or punished differently – not entirely, but in some\nimportant ways –, simply because there is a massive pressure\nagainst any change at all in protocols.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
