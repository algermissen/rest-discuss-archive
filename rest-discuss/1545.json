Mike Dierken [mailto:mdierken@...]\n\n&gt; For me, those example are not &#39;natural&#39;, they are merely &#39;procedural&#39;. A\n&gt; noun/object/resource based approach isn&#39;t any more natural either - it is\n&gt; just a different way to doing things and it has different characteristics.\n\nI agree that what is &quot;natural&quot; is often a matter of opinion.  And I\ncertainly don&#39;t view these as mutually exclusive.  There is no reason to be\nable to see it both ways as human beings do all the time.  We buy our\ngroceries and we get a receipt of the transaction.  There is not conflict in\nthat and it is good to see it both ways at the same time.\n\nI do think that in our universe of human understanding, there are certain\nconcepts that are that more naturally a resource/noun and others that are\nmore naturally procedural/actions.  There is a reason that we have a lot of\nnouns in our vocabulary as well as a lot of verbs. 8-)  But, you are\ncertainly welcomed to think otherwise.  I just think that REST should allow\nboth types of thinking and that they can coexist.\n\nYou give a fine example of how the home AC can be viewed both ways and that\nthe procedural URIs are only \n&quot;more natural&quot; to the extent that we the users are thinking procedurally at\nremotely setting our AC.  On the other hand, I see no problem that we expose\nboth the state-oriented URLs and the action-oriented URLs at the same time,\nwhich would support both types of thinking concurrently.\n\nMaybe a better example of a more naturally action-oriented task would be\ndriving a car.  If I am driving the car, I am certainly more focused on\nturning right and turning left and stepping on the gas or stepping on the\nbreak, as opposed to setting the direction of the car to the left or setting\nthe car into accelerated state or decelerated state.\n\nOne could argue that computers programs at its core are more\nstate-representational, but that doesn&#39;t not mean that we as human beings\nand programmers need to think that way as well.  The computer can translate\n&quot;turn right&quot; into changing the steering wheel setting for us.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
