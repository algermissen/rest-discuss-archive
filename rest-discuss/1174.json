In other words, if f(x,y) returns z\n&gt;&gt;&gt;today, it will always return z. This maps to the subset of &quot;Web\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Services&quot; known as the &quot;static Web&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Which is exactly the subset that should use HTTP GET.\n&gt;&gt;It might be interesting to compare all REST features with the features\n&gt;&gt;of &#39;unpure&#39; functional languages.\n&gt;\n&gt; But GET is also good for fetching information that changes over time:\n&gt; like stock quotes.\n\nYes, that&#39;s why languages like Haskell have some side-effect mechanisms.\nBut they are designed very careful and maybe comparing those features\nwith REST will add some interesting information to the discussion.\n\nSjoerd\n\n\nYahoo!
