Sure a small business\n&gt; would let that be determined by a technical detail, but a\n&gt; multi-billion dollar company?\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ll agree to disagree, but without knowledge of sales figures there&#39;s\nno way to know:  Does this boost sales, and if so, is it enough to\ncompensate for the revenue lost when the store is closed?  To which I\nadd, Branding 101 says you don&#39;t tell a customer who&#39;s ready to spend\nmoney, to come back later; you run the risk that they won&#39;t.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It simply /must/ increase sales over the 24-96 hour period, otherwise \n&gt; they just wouldn&#39;t have it going off line.\n&gt;\n\nYes, but inconveniencing customers goes against Apple&#39;s branding, so if\nthis is a deliberate marketing ploy, it&#39;s driving the branding team\nnuts.  Unless they&#39;ve determined that this somehow adds mystique.  Note\nthat Amazon not only stays open, but allows pre-ordering of products\nbefore they&#39;re available.  Why would Apple, instead of taking early\norders, close outright -- when closing&#39;s got to be felt on the bottom\nline for *any* Web store?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure it&#39;s a sweet story to try and say that Apple are loosing\n&gt; millions because there system isn&#39;t RESTful, but come on this is the\n&gt; real world a money hungry company, like they&#39;d accept any geek of any\n&gt; calibre saying &quot;uhmm sorry we have to take the apple store offline\n&gt; for X hours every tiem you want to add a product&quot; - nahhhhhhhhhhhhh.\n&gt; \n\nWhat I&#39;m saying is, the marketing person of any caliber saying this is\njust as mind-boggling; when in the real world, closing your e-commerce\nstore for any period of time comes with the costs of losing revenue and\ndamaging brand identity.  If Apple is doing this deliberately and they\nsomehow succeed, I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone to follow their lead, or\nexpect good results from the experiment if they do.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
