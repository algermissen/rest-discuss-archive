It feels way \ntoo much like trying to force HTTP into a structure other than its own.\n\nI&#39;ve noticed over the years that some developers persist in seeing the \nworld as nothing but objects. Others see it as nothing but tables. You \nmay be advocating a new variant of this position I haven&#39;t encountered \nbefore: the world is nothing but subject-verb-object triples. \nInteresting, but ultimately as broken as the other two approaches.\n\nThe only way to understand HTTP and use it fully effectively is to take \nit on its own terms, with its own architecture, and its own principles; \nand those principles don&#39;t include any notion of subject, verb, or object.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
