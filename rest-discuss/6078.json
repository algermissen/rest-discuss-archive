In fact, for a shopping\n&gt;&gt; application, that&#39;s pretty much what I consider the session to  \n&gt;&gt; consist\n&gt;&gt; of.  Therefore, the reference to the back end cart is a session key.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not necessarily.  The equivalent of a cart for a travel broker is an\n&gt; itinerary or trip.  I can set one up but not book it, come back later\n&gt; (another &quot;session&quot;) and book it, come back still later (yet another\n&gt; session) and add a hotel etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know that anybody does it this way, but the same could happen\n&gt; to a shopping cart.  Pick some items, come back later and pick some\n&gt; more, come back still later and check out.\n&gt;\nAmazon I know does it this way. When I went to look yesterday at how  \nthey do their shopping cart, mine had something I apparently put into  \nit in January still sitting there, waiting to be purchased.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
