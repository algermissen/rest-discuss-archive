When GETting, you would want\nthe fleet document to give you links to find the vehicles. When\nPUTting, you would send a different kind of representation that\ndoesn&#39;t enumerate vehicles.\n\nHugh\n\n\nOn 10/4/06, Hugh Winkler &lt;hughw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On 10/4/06, Scott Mohekey &lt;scott.mohekey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m mostly wondering is if my definition of a resource, and the\n&gt; &gt; relationship between resources represented by parent and child uris is\n&gt; &gt; correct.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My understanding is that a child uri represents a child resource, and\n&gt; &gt; that a PUT to the parent uri modifies just the parent resource, leaving\n&gt; &gt; the children resource in tact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, changing the name of a fleet, in my eyes, should be a PUT to\n&gt; &gt; the fleet uri, which will not  modify the children of the fleet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, from what you say, it sounds as if you advocate that child uris\n&gt; &gt; represent part of a composite resource, in which case PUTing to the\n&gt; &gt; parent will indeed replace all of the children.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I tried to go to great lengths to make exactly the opposite\n&gt; point. I tried to indicate that you control the semantics of PUTting\n&gt; to the resource, so you can define the PUT to update only the name,\n&gt; and similar properties. Ordinarily, though, if you had some other\n&gt; &quot;flat&quot; properties like date, comments, etc., then to modify the date\n&gt; you would typically send over a whole representation of the resource\n&gt; that has those other properties as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; My previous message was just pointing out that you are in control, so\n&gt; you would probably NOT want to permit modifying the collection\n&gt; contents this way. I guess I made an assumption that the fleet\n&gt; representation would enumerate the vehicles, but I see now that&#39;s not\n&gt; the case. So you can ignore that bit about what to do with the\n&gt; vehicles when updating the fleet, if you don&#39;t make the vehicles, or a\n&gt; reference to them, part of the representation of a fleet.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, typically, a representation of a collection would contain\n&gt; links, either directly or indirectly, to the members. If you don&#39;t do\n&gt; that, then it sounds like you are contemplating &quot;constructed&quot; URIs, so\n&gt; that clients would have to understand how to construct a URI  given a\n&gt; fleet id and vehicle id. You probably don&#39;t want to do that. It&#39;s more\n&gt; robust and restlike to follow hyperlinks embedded in each\n&gt; representation yoyu get from the server. That&#39;s why I assumed you had\n&gt; a link to the vehicles in a fleet&#39;s representation. This way all the\n&gt; state of the app is contained in the hypertext document the client\n&gt; last obtained. You can prbly think of other ways to do that. But you\n&gt; will want to stay away from constructing URIs in this case I believe.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hugh\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nHugh Winkler\nWellstorm Development\n\nhttp://www.wellstorm.com/\n+1 512 694 4795 mobile (preferred)\n+1 512 264 3998 office\n\n"}}
