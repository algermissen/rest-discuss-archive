An RDF document can&#39;t be a representation of a resource?  I\n&gt; don&#39;t see where httpRange-14 or anything else makes such an assertion.\n\nA representation of a resource carries some or all parts of a resource. A\npicture of a horse is a representation of a horse. A transcript of a\njudgement is a representation of that judgement. However a political adviser\nmaking assertions on that judgement is *not* a representation of that\njudgement. It&#39;s something else, which have its own representation (the video\ncontent).\n\nSo I&#39;d say quite clearly that no, RDF is definitely not a representation of\na resource, but a resource about a resource.\n\n&gt; Fallacious?  How?  The source for this notion is the *authors* of the\n&gt; spec.  Who is in a position to call their argument fallacious,\n&gt; exactly?\n\nActually, the whole concept of an RFC is to document something at some point\nin time. Just because the authors of an RFC would have included something\nbut didn&#39;t have the time, or were thinking very loud about it doesn&#39;t make\nit part of an RFC. A written law applies based on the text, not on what\nsomeone had in his head.\n\nExpecting people to &quot;know&quot; what the authors were thinking in an RFC is\nfallacious and unreasonable. If something was left out of a spec for\npractical reasons or lack of time, the solution is to update the RFC or\ncreate a new one. \n\n&gt;  Where are you people getting this notion that RFC 2616\n&gt; supersedes RFC 2068?  I read this:\n\nThat&#39;s been responded to so I won&#39;t go any further.\n\n&gt; Link in HTML and the XHTML families are still there for that, as well\n&gt; as in ATOM feeds.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; [...] That&#39;s why\n&gt; the debate is about *uniform* access to metadata, the whole idea is\n&gt; to _not_ restrict linking to metadata, to only a select few media types.\n&gt; I don&#39;t see that as a requirement of HTTP or REST, or of any pragmatic\n&gt; concern.  Please refer to Roy&#39;s post [1], there is a difference between\n&gt; redirected conneg and true conneg.  Whether we&#39;re talking about\n&gt; multiple languages or multiple anything else, a negotiated redirect\n&gt; makes no assertion that the target is part of the set of\n&gt; representations for the requested resource.\n\nhttpRange-14 makes no such distinction: it specifies that a 200 means that\nyou&#39;re faced with a document. And it says that anything that returns a 303\ncould be anything at all.\n\nWithout a redirection, by httprange-14 you make the assertion that what you\nrequested *is* an awww-IR, aka a document, that may have several\nrepresentations, *because* you get a 200.\n\nSo to answer your question, if when you dereference /customer with Accept:\napplication/rdf+xml you get a 200, /customer is *not* a customer or a thing,\nit *is* a document. With a redirect, you make no assertion on /customer at\nall, you redirect to /customer.rdf, which when dereferenced returns a 200:\nthe rdf *is* a doucument about something, you just don&#39;t know what about\nuntil you parse the rdf.\n\n&gt; If we can define a resource as &quot;404 response page&quot; we can serve a\n&gt; representation of it anywhere we need to.  In which case, the request\n&gt; for a nonexistent resource returns a representation of some other\n&gt; resource, i.e. &quot;404 response page&quot;.  The 404 response message body\n&gt; isn&#39;t a representation of the requested resource, but the 404 response\n&gt; itself is.\n\nI don&#39;t see the point you&#39;re making. A 404 response to a dereferencing of a\nuri makes no assertion on that uri at all. The fact that you send an entity\nbody with your response changes absolutely nothing. At most you could add a\nContent-Location in your 404 to specify that the entity returned lives at\n/404.html. If that Uri dereference to a 200 then you made an assertion on\nthat resource. They&#39;re two different things.\n\n&gt; Similarly, if we request &#39;application/rdf+xml&#39; from a URI which has no\n&gt; RDF representation, but is described by an RDF document at some other\n&gt; URI, then we can return a 303 representation which indicates the value\n&gt; of some other resource -- in this case, its URI.  To my way of\n&gt; thinking, it&#39;s better to respond &quot;maybe&quot; (303) rather than &quot;no&quot; (412)\n&gt; in such a scenario, if possible.\n\nAbsolutely agreed.\n\n&gt; 303 and 404 representations of a requested URI\n&gt; indicate the value of _some other resource_.\n\nNow you&#39;re confusing me, how can a return code be considered a\nrepresentation? It&#39;s teh result of dereferencing, it&#39;s not a representation\nof anything.\n\n&gt; But I see no pragmatic, or even theoretical, reason not to use conneg to\n&gt; 303 redirect to an RDF document.  Yeah, this means you could also use\n&gt; conneg and 303 redirects to serve CSS documents.  So?\n\n\nI think we agree on this. If I copy my previous message on this:\n &quot;Css and Rdf *are not* different representations of a same resource and\nshould *never* share the same url.&quot;\n\nIf you 303, *you are not sharing the Url*, because the rdf and css will have\n*different urls*, the ones returned by the 303.\n\nLet&#39;s put it back into context of what the original question was:\n\n=====\nIt&#39;s possible to use content negotiation for an aspect of the exchange.  If\nthe metadata and multimedia were considered different representations of the\nsame resource, they could be distinguished by media type and fetched\nseparately by using the Accept header.\n=====\n\nSo I will stand by my previous explanation:\n1. Metadata about a resource is *not* a representation of that resource.\nIt&#39;s something else.\n2. If you 303, you distinguish by *url* because you redirect somewhere\n\nFundamentally, it comes down to what the url you&#39;re dereferencing is:\na. it&#39;s a document, because you got a 200 using any combination of headers.\nYou now *know* that this is a document and not an IR. So when you return a\n303 from /customer.html because it has an Accept&quot; application/xml+rdf, you\nsay that querying a document with Accept: application/rdf+xml has a response\nat another location. To me this is wrong, and exactly what the Link: header\nshould cover. \nb. It&#39;s a thing as far as you know, because you have no known 200 response\nwhen dereferencing. Again it&#39;s a fragile assertion to make, but in that case\nthe 303 return is more acceptable.\n\nTo sum up my position, I don&#39;t think returning other resources through\nconneg on an IR is a good idea, it introduces confusion. On a non-IR it may\nor may not be a good idea, I don&#39;t have a very strong position on this yet.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
