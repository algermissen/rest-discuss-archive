He&#39;s open to the idea but we haven&#39;t converged\n&gt; on a final design and development plan yet.\nLet me know if I can help out - I have some free time on my hands.\nI&#39;m installing MoveableType and will be playing around with it.\n\n&gt; He used the term REST in his\n&gt; literature so he was trying to do the right thing but various\n&gt; implementation quirks pushed him towards using non-idempotent GETs. I\n&gt; think future versions will fix that.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; This seems more cooler... they provide for an HTTP response header\n&gt; &gt; X-Pingback, as well as a &lt;link&gt; tag in HTML and XHTML: &lt;link\nrel=&quot;pingback&quot;\n&gt; &gt; href=&quot;http://charlie.example.com/pingback/xmlrpc&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Trackback uses RDF.\nBut this one goes to eleven!\nhttp://spinaltapfan.com/atozed/TAP00160.HTM\n\n\n\n"}}
