POST requires a form, which is a block element, and the extra line\nbreak is sometimes not doable for design reasons.  I can kludge my way\naround that, sure, but it would require a layer of unrobust code -- either\na javascript form submit of some kind or CSS bits known to be unreliable.\n\nTwo, names for URLs.  What to call a login page?  POST to /account?  That\nmakes no sense.  I wonder if there are standards or best practices\nevolving for URIs.\n\nThree, the usability of HTTP authentication is not OK.  If I do\nchallenge/response, the user gets this scary popup dialog, without the\nimportant links for creating a new account and recovering your password.\nBut if I don&#39;t use that scary dialog, I have to use a cookie for\nauthentication.  Neither option is good.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n- Lucas Gonze\n\n\n\n"}}
