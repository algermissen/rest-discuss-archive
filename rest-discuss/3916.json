For example, it is meaningful to talk\n&gt; about POSTing a log-entry to a log-file because we understand that\n&gt; log-entry can be a subordinate of a logfile (even if the log-entry never\n&gt; gets its own URI).\n&gt;\n&gt; In contrast, I&#39;m still waiting for you to explain how an RNA notification\n&gt; is subordinate to an RNA inbox.  Is it subordinate &quot;in the same way that a\n&gt; file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is\n&gt; subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n&gt; subordinate to a database?&quot;  Unless you define what an inbox is, you can&#39;t\n&gt; really POST to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; And, my more general point is, once you define what an inbox is, you don&#39;t\n&gt; need specifically to document POST as it is defined entirely by the\n&gt; semantics of RFC2616 and your definition of an inbox.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no way to violate the semantics of POST under this interpretation\n;\n&gt; it has no meaning.  If POST means nothing in particular, why not use\n&gt; another verb name?  At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED\n&gt; to determine whether or not the resource has the behavior you expect from\n&gt; your method.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S. Alexander Jacobson                   i2x Media\n&gt; 1-212-787-1914 voice                    1-603-288-1280 fax\n&gt;\n&gt; --On Friday, August 15, 2003 9:33 AM -0400 Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &lt;seairth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There has been much discussion about how POST should or shouldn&#39;t be\nused.\n&gt; &gt; What seems to be a major sticking point is the relationship of the\nrequest\n&gt; &gt; entity to the resource.  For reference (RFC2616 9.5):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     The POST method is used to request that the origin\n&gt; &gt;     server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a\n&gt; &gt;     new subordinate of the resource identified by the\n&gt; &gt;     Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note that this does not say that the request entity is a &quot;subordinate\n&gt; &gt; resource&quot;.  It only says that it is &quot;a new suboridnate of the resource&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Though some may disagree, that&#39;s a world of difference.  POST never once\n&gt; &gt; claims that the request entity is a resource.  All it claims is that the\n&gt; &gt; target resource can make a resource out of the request entity.  This is\n&gt; &gt; evident by the variety of functions that POST can handle:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     - Annotation of existing resources;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,\n&gt; &gt;       mailing list, or similar group of articles;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     - Providing a block of data, such as the result of\n&gt; &gt;       submitting a form, to a data-handling process;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     - Extending a database through an append operation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Make special note of the third example.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, the POST definition also says:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     The actual function performed by the POST method is\n&gt; &gt;     determined by the server and is usually dependent on\n&gt; &gt;     the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to\n&gt; &gt;     that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to\n&gt; &gt;     a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate\n&gt; &gt;     to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n&gt; &gt;     subordinate to a database.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When trying to clarify what the definition means by &quot;subordinate&quot;, it\n&gt; &gt; focuses on easily visualizable concepts where &quot;subordination&quot; is already\na\n&gt; &gt; well-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive\n&gt; &gt; clarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is\n&gt; &gt; that the request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other way\n&gt; &gt; around. A record cannot insert itself into a database, the database must\n&gt; &gt; insert a record into itself.  The same can be said for file/directories\n&gt; &gt; and articles/newsgroups.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not\n&gt; &gt; itself treat the request entity as a resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     The action performed by the POST method might not\n&gt; &gt;     result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In\n&gt; &gt;     this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the\n&gt; &gt;     appropriate response status, depending on whether or\n&gt; &gt;     not the response includes an entity that describes\n&gt; &gt;     the result.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also,\nI\n&gt; &gt; would argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid\n&gt; &gt; response, but that&#39;s a minor issue.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And the last relevant part of the specification is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     If a resource has been created on the origin server,\n&gt; &gt;     the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain\n&gt; &gt;     an entity which describes the status of the request\n&gt; &gt;     and refers to the new resource, and a Location header\n&gt; &gt;     (see section 14.30).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity to\na\n&gt; &gt; resource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to\nthe\n&gt; &gt; definition, the response entity is the &quot;status&quot; of the request, not a\n&gt; &gt; representation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even\nif\n&gt; &gt; the POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST\nitself\n&gt; &gt; is still nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In\n&gt; &gt; other words, the response is still just the output of the target\nresource\n&gt; &gt; function based on the input.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And that&#39;s it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of\n&gt; &gt; additional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.  Boring, but\n&gt; &gt; quite useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
