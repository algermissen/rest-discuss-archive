I&#39;m opposed to \n&gt; cookies in general. But, *if* I want to track unauthenticated users, \n&gt; cookies seem like a good option since I can decide to have everything \n&gt; identifiable by a URI and use them as a purely optional aspect. \n\nTracking for its own sake does not violate the web architecture. However \nyou run into trouble as soon as you take the next step and use the \ntracked path to determine which resource or representation you serve to \nthe client, rather than having that depend purely on the URL and the \nrelevant HTTP headers.\n\nIn practice I rarely see sites tracking users without also doing \nsomething obvious with those tracks.\n\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
