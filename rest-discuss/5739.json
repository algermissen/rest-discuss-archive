It does strike me as rather a\n&gt; complex specification, as are its related toolsets.  I started looking\n&gt; into REST as an interesting alternative and am just trying to\n&gt; understand it.  I saw an example in one of the introductory\n&gt; explanations I read. (http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html) \n&gt; It had a client program asking for part information, and this is what\n&gt; the client gets:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&gt; &lt;p:Parts xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot; \n&gt;          xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Part id=&quot;00345&quot;  \n&gt;             xlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Part id=&quot;00346&quot; \n&gt;             xlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00346&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Part id=&quot;00347&quot; \n&gt;             xlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00347&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;Part id=&quot;00348&quot; \n&gt;             xlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00348&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/p:Parts&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The writer also says this:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;[Assume that through content negotiation the service determined that\n&gt; the client wants the representation as XML (for machine-to-machine\n&gt; processing).] Note that the parts list has links to get detailed info\n&gt; about each part. This is a key feature of REST. The client transfers\n&gt; from one state to the next by examining and choosing from among the\n&gt; alternative URLs in the response document.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s cool.  But I scoured the article looking for any mention of the\n&gt; schema -- how do the clients know the structure of the xml?  You could\n&gt; have a reference to a schema or DTD (or whatever) in your initial\n&gt; resource page, but I take it there is no standard way of doing this? \n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t this be a problem?  I must be missing something here...\n\nClearly it has to be done somehow. If the document had an attached\nschema that would be one way to identify the document. \n\nBut the document might have a mime type that identified it. RSS data\nis like that for example; it is identified by\napplication/xml+rss. Atom is similarly identified by mime type.\n\nIt&#39;s also possible that your client just *expects* the content to be\nof a certain type. If I write a client for Amazon REST webservices I\nknow what the documents returned are going to be structured like. I\ncan just write the XML handling. Of course, if Amazon change the doc\nthen I&#39;ll be screwed. But I&#39;ll be screwed anyway because my client has\nhardcoded semantics.\n\n\nSOAP people have on occasion tried to represent this as a problem with\nREST. But it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a problem with programming with other\npeople&#39;s stuff. The same thing can happen in SOAP in fact: if the SOAP\nservice provider changes the API then you have to rebuild your\nclient.\n\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
