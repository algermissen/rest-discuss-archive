Eric then goes further to suggest that by re-using a well known specification, anybody writing a client gets the benefit of reusing knowledge (and possibly tools) they already have.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will look more closely at the Atom specification to see how well it fits my situation... though I have one immediate question:\n&gt; \n&gt; As stated originally, I wanted my representation of the Seller resource to contain both the Seller information and the collection of links to Accounts. I don&#39;t want the Seller representation to be a Service Document that contains pointers to the feeds, which the client would then have to GET separately. How would you mix one or more feeds into the representation of a resource? Would you have something along the lines of:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;seller .....&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &lt;otherInfo1 /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &lt;otherInfo2 /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &lt;feed xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Accounts&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;      ...\n&gt; \n&gt;      &lt;entry&gt;...&lt;/entry&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;      &lt;entry&gt;...&lt;/entry&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &lt;/feed&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;/seller&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, what media type should be used? Neither &quot;application/atomserv+xml&quot; or &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; seem appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand the benefits of re-using a standard but worry about the verbosity compared to a custom representation.\n\nSince you have a custom &lt;seller&gt; anyhow, I&#39;d - for the sake of clarity - just use custom markup for the account links, too. You might still provide an extra resource that is the collection of accounts and provide a feed for that.\n\ne.g. \n\n&lt;seller&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;accounts href=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;account .....&gt;\n    &lt;account ....&gt;\n  &lt;/accouts&gt;\n&lt;/seller&gt;\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; I also wonder about the real benefits when the client will have to be built to understand the &quot;foreign markup&quot; anyway if it is to be of any use to an end user.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I might be sold more on the idea if I could see an example of this embedding of feeds into a representation or a resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your time\n&gt; \n&gt; Piers\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
