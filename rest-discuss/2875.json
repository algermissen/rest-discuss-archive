He also mentioned unsolicited\n&gt; responses from servers to clients which is something that HTTP has long\n&gt; needed.\nA response is always solicited due to a request (unless you have multiple\nresponses or something, but there is still a cause).\nPerhaps this means a response not on the same connection - which implies\nmessage correlation. (Implied message correlation via a socket connection\nwas a great enabling simplification, but adding more complexity will\nincrease capability)\n\n\n\n"}}
