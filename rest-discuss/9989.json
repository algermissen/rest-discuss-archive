And only one mention of the use of OPTIONS.\n\nI can tell you I do that as a matter of practice, supporting multiple\ncontent-types on requests and responses, specifically for structured\ndata.\n\nIf the client is a Web browser than the input format (url-encoded or\nmultipart) is specified by the form or XHR.\n\nIf the client is automated, then it needs to know what the relevant\ninformation is and how to structure it, so that&#39;s covered by a\nspecification which tells you which content types are applicable.\n\nI do make a conscious effort to maintain some symmetry, so for some\ncontent-type you&#39;re to POST/PUT the same document you&#39;ll GET back.\nThat works for JSON and XML, but there&#39;s not a lot of requests for\nHTML input or url-encoded output.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike A\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/14/07, Chris Dent &lt;cdent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Dec 14, 2007, at 2:18 PM, mike amundsen wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, my question is two-fold:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - how common is it to support multiple media types for POST/PUT\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think this must be fairly common, or if not it should be. It&#39;s kind\n&gt; &gt; of the point right? You have a resource or some collection of\n&gt; &gt; resources that you want updated. The most flexible way of supporting\n&gt; &gt; update would be to support multiple media types on input.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the systems I&#39;ve worked with (primarily wikis[1]), we&#39;ll accept\n&gt; &gt; wikitext, HTML, JSON packages that include wikitext or HTML along with\n&gt; &gt; some metadata. We&#39;ve explored Atom and various (other) XML packagings\n&gt; &gt; too, but have not solidified those as we don&#39;t yet have the use case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the server side we store the incoming representation (after some\n&gt; &gt; translation) to our canonical storage representation, wikitext, and\n&gt; &gt; then make it available in a variety of outgoing representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On input we look at the Content-Type header. If we don&#39;t support a\n&gt; &gt; particular type, we send a 415. Ideally we&#39;d respond with the types we\n&gt; &gt; do support but we didn&#39;t get around to that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For output we look at the accept header. We don&#39;t do full content-\n&gt; &gt; negotiation with the header: we hope the client to send a single type\n&gt; &gt; that they accept, not multiples from which we&#39;ll pick the one we like\n&gt; &gt; best. We try with that latter bit but it never comes out as happy as\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;d like, so in our own client code we always just accept one thing\n&gt; &gt; and one thing only.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Our thinking in all this is that for our style of API--which is purely\n&gt; &gt; a data mover, not something we expect to use as a human UI (although\n&gt; &gt; it works just great that way if you are happy not having a bunch of UI\n&gt; &gt; furniture)--we want the URIs for the resources to really be the place\n&gt; &gt; where things happen: for any entity its URL is the place where you GET\n&gt; &gt; it, you PUT it and you DELETE it, for any collection its URL is the\n&gt; &gt; place where you GET it and you POST to it. We don&#39;t bother providing\n&gt; &gt; forms output or support for CGI form content-types input. If we did\n&gt; &gt; want to have a resource which was the editor for other resources, then\n&gt; &gt; we might, but at this point we expect the client side to make its own\n&gt; &gt; editor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1] Socialtext REST API docs: https://www.socialtext.net/st-rest-docs/index.cgi\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Chris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\n&gt; &gt; or I&#39;ll remove your commit bit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; mca\n&gt; &quot;In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a\n&gt; revolutionary act. &quot; (George Orwell)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
