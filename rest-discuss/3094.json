I&#39;ve got my own little toolkit that \nI use for simple Python projects where Zope etc. are overkill. But here \nis where I get nervous: a toolkit that helps people use HTTP as it was \ndesigned to be used is an HTTP toolkit. Perhaps it is a _better_ HTTP \ntoolkit than the ones that exist, but it is still an HTTP toolkit. \nPhil&#39;s example code is a perfect example of using HTTP right. I won&#39;t \nargue if Phil calls it a REST toolkit but I don&#39;t see a clear boundary \nbetween &quot;good&quot; HTTP toolkits and REST toolkits. When an HTTP toolkit \nstrays from REST it is probably just a misunderstanding by the toolkit&#39;s \nauthor and we should probably work with them to correct it.\n\nAlso, some people probably think that REST toolkit would embed a bunch \nof XML smarts. This stems from the confusion that REST is about using \nXML over HTTP. I don&#39;t think Phil has this confusion but I bet many \npeople asking for REST toolkits do!\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
