The change in state of the &quot;user&quot; resource is\n: accomplished with a POST.\n\nSessions are probably better thought of as conversational state, not\napplication state.  But when hard pressed, the distinction could be hard\nto support.  Anybody got a pat answer for this?\n\n--Walden\n\n\n:\n: Similarly,\n:\n: http://foo.com/page/edit/1\n: http://foo.com/page/delete/1\n:\n: are representations of the &quot;page with id 1&quot; resource. Is this the right\nway to\n: look at this??\n:\n: All changes in the state of that resource are accomplished with a &lt;FORM\n: action=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; for example, saving after you have edited the contents of\n&quot;page\n: with id 1&quot; or committing a delete of &quot;page with id 1&quot;.\n:\n:\n: In most web application the logout action is accomplished through a URI\nwhich\n: looks something like this:\n:\n: http://foo.com/user/logout\n:\n: This URI has the side effect of &quot;logging out&quot; the user and therefore it is\n: inconsistent with my assumptions of REST.\n:\n: How can this be accomplished so that it makes sense in the current Web\n: Applications scenario where users are used to logging out using a URI as\n: opposed to a &lt;FORM action=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;?\n:\n: It seems that most of the so called webs scripting languages make it look\nlike\n: POST is just a non-transparent way of changing the state of a resource as\n: opposed to the transparent GET. So developers tend to use the two\n: interchangeably!\n:\n: Thanks! :)\n:\n: ----------------------------------------------------------------\n:\n:\n: To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n: rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n:\n:\n:\n: Yahoo!
