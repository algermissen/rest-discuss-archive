Don&#39;t use conneg for web services.\n&gt; 2. Never, ever use text/xml or application/xml as the mime-type for\n&gt; your web services representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; #2 should be followed regardless of what you are doing. If you do use\n&gt; specific mime-types for your representations then you shouldn&#39;t run\n&gt; into a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are careful with your mime-types and parsing accept headers I believe\n&gt; you can deploy a web service that uses conneg. Note that represents a change\n&gt; in my historical stance against conneg[1].\n\nI believe that, when XML is present, the HTML should be derived from\nit by means of a stylesheet. Given that there is a mechanism for\nputting the SS into the XML you get the ability to deliver the XML and\nthe HTML to a browser.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
