You can \ntest for problems using the Waterken Browser, which implements the \nHTTPSY protocol.\n\nThe HTTPSY specification is at:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/YURL/httpsy/\n\nThe Waterken Browser home page is at:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Browser/\n\nAn example URL, for testing the HTTPSY protocol is:\n\nhttpsy://*cl7h3f7jwyj3fvmw7jpnjfvf2xlcmayi@.../\n\nThis URL is also contained in the default bookmarks file included in the \nWaterken Browser download. You will see this hyperlink when the browser \nfirst starts up. After clicking on the hyperlink, you should see the \nWaterken Inc. home page.\n\nIf people could try the software with different firewalls, and send me \nthe success or failure results, I will gladly compile them into a list \nand report back.\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe web-calculus is the union of REST and capability-based security.\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
