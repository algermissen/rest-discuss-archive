I&#39;m not sure why you want to have different types\navailable to the browser as an application feature.\n\nIt would be nice to have more explanation (perhaps I missed it\nearlier, in which case I apologise).\n\n\nHaving said all that I think you could code it quite easily with\nscript. XmlHttpRequest can be used to make HTTP requests with Accept\nheaders and then you can make the entity you retrieved &#39;current&#39;.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
