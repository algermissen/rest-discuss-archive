But I meet a\n&gt; problem when design my (hopefully) restful web service.\n&gt; \n&gt; My website users can add books or movies to their lists, with some\n&gt; predefined status (e.g. &quot;have read&quot;, &quot;wish to watch&quot;, etc.) and\n&gt; comments.  How can I let web service users to get information like\n&gt; &quot;get all the books Bob wish to read, with his comments&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the resources in this case are not books, because comments are\n&gt; not attributes of books.  They are attributes of the &quot;relationship of\n&gt; Bob and the book&quot;.  Let me call the relationship &quot;collection&quot;.  So I\n&gt; designed the following URLs and lost:\n&gt; \n&gt; /users/Bob/collections?cat=book&status=wish\n&gt; /users/Bob/collections/book/wish\n&gt; /users/Bob/collections/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; /collections/user/Bob/cat/book/status/wish\n&gt; /collections?user=Bob&cat=book&status=wish\n&gt; \n&gt; Which one do you consider the most &quot;RESTful&quot;?\n\nURI design is very nice for human users.  And it&#39;s a good opportunity\nto think about resource design.  But it&#39;s good to remember that REST\nhas no constraints on what your URIs should look like. It&#39;s just an\nidentifier.\n\nThat said, personally I&#39;d go with either your first or your last one,\nsince the resource you&#39;re naming isn&#39;t really part of a hierarchy, so\nslashes would be misleading to human eyes.  And it would be trivial to\nprovide an html form that constructs such a URI, so you have HATEOAS.\n\nThe O&#39;Reilly book has a nice section on URI design.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\n\n"}}
