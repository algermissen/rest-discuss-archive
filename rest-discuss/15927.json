This is certainly\n&gt; &gt; valid\n&gt; &gt; HTTP, but I&#39;m wondering if people consid=\r\ner it RESTful. \n&gt; \n&gt; While &quot;client control over part of the URI&quot; can be a p=\r\nroblem, sometimes it\n&gt; is exactly what you want.  Consider uploading an ima=\r\nge to a photo sharing\n&gt; site -- you (the client) might very much care what =\r\nthe ultimate filename is,\n&gt; and probably also what folder it gets put in.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I would tend to think more about the difference in idempotency (if the =\r\nsame\n&gt; request gets submitted twice, say because the client didn&#39;t hear the=\r\n initial\n&gt; response for some reason, do two things get created or just one?=\r\n) between\n&gt; PUT and POST.  In the case of PUT, its up the  server to do the=\r\n right thing,\n&gt; whereas the fact that POST is not idempotent shifts that re=\r\nsponsibility to\n&gt; the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; That all being said, thinking back over =\r\nall the web services I have built\n&gt; over the last few years, POST is used f=\r\nor creating new resources in nearly\n&gt; every case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig\n&gt;\n\nAlso, just =\r\nbecause you are using PUT doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the client cooks up=\r\n the URI from scratch. The hypermedia document could give the client the UR=\r\nI to PUT to, it could also provide a URI template that the client fills in.=\r\n If-None-Match headers could be used to avoid collisions but each client co=\r\nuld be given their own URI &quot;sub-space&quot; to play in too (controlled by the UR=\r\nI template and HTTP auth on the URI space).\n\nI agree that POST gets used mo=\r\nre (almost exclusively) in the wild though. I&#39;d think that the extra work t=\r\no guide the client to construct the right URLs (which it could potentially =\r\nignore or get wrong, requiring further work on the server to validate thing=\r\ns) is likely not worth the benefits of idempotence to most folks. There are=\r\n probably other tradeoffs that I&#39;m missing too...\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
