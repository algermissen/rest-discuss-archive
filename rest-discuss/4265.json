In this case,\nthe &quot;merge&quot; functionality is best provided by the server, and should be\nprovided in a &quot;first class&quot; manner -- as a message-type the server\nrespects.\n\n&gt; Instead I&#39;d like to POST to some &quot;transaction&quot; resource, \n&gt; say /merge, and create a new resource that represents\n&gt; the transaction details\n[deletia]\n&gt; Does this violate principle #4 above?  What other\n&gt; solutions would there be otherwise?\n\nI think, generally, the messages should contain this type of action. \nURIs really should describe resources -- fixed, tangible things ... not\nprocesses.  Messages can be POSTed to resources:\n\nWhat about...\n\nPOST /account/1/change\n&lt;subsume&gt;\n  &lt;account resource=&quot;/account/2&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/subsume&gt;\n\n201 Created\nLocation: /account/1/change/1\n\nGET /account/1/change/1\n&lt;subsume&gt;\n  &lt;account resource=&quot;/account/2&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/subsume&gt;\n\n\nOne nice thing about this is it becomes more clear where to put\nsomething like /account/##/changes/ ... on the resource which contains\nit.\n\nOr a related query: /account?withChanges=true.\n\nOr a maybe-more-useful query: /account?withChangesAfter=2004-02-01\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n# A: Because it breaks the flow of normal conversation.\n# Q: Why don&#39;t we put the response before the request?\n\n\n"}}
