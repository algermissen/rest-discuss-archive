We touched on this before.\n&gt; &gt; What is the &#39;function&#39; of an HTTP PUT?  I.e., which mapping are\n&gt; &gt; we interested in?  Clearly, sometimes it&#39;s resource before-and-after\n&gt; &gt; state.  At other times it may be more like request-to-response\n&gt; &gt; mapping?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I think that&#39;s right.\n\nI don&#39;t understand the distinction I guess.\n\n&gt; The problem here is that these two views clearly aren&#39;t equivalent, and \n&gt; are typically in conflict. REST, as I understand it, looks to have a \n&gt; more natural fit with the resource before-and-after state view. So does \n&gt; that mean that REST is in conflict with part of RFC 2616? If it is in \n&gt; conflict, is that a problem for REST, or is it the inevitable \n&gt; consequence of an inconsistency in RFC 2616?\n&gt; \n&gt; FWIW, the interpretation of idempotent sequences of requests isn&#39;t \n&gt; merely a niggling theoretical puzzle: it has direct implications for \n&gt; the implementation of HTTP/1.1 request piplining on the client side. \n&gt; Having built non-caching HTTP/1.1 proxies which support piplining \n&gt; across from downstream clients to upstream origin servers, I can vouch \n&gt; for the fact that the tensions in section 9.1 are a real headache with \n&gt; uncomfortable implications for interoperability.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark (B and N), you&#39;ve done work in a similar area, so you must have run \n&gt; into the same issue: how did you resolve it?\n\nWe haven&#39;t had any troubles.  We tried to use Jeff Mogul&#39;s out-of-order\nspec, but had practical issues with it (it requires using a new client\nstack).  But we don&#39;t have a lot of heard reliability guarantees in our\nuse of our platform, so it&#39;s possible that I&#39;m missing an edge case\nthat demonstrates the disconnect.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
