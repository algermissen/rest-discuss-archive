I hope to influence ebXML and\n&gt; related efforts to move in the REST direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find it fairly natural to model business objects as suites of Web\n&gt; resources.  (Paul Prescod:  refering to one of your recent opponents\n&gt; on the xml-dev list, I think it is perfectly feasible to model almost\n&gt; everything in any business application system (ERP, CRM, etc.) in Web\n&gt; resources.)\n\nAny luck with getting someone to do a pure http binding for the Registry and\nRepository services? They seem to /beg/ for a simple URI and http access\nmechanism.\n\nMaybe we can convince MarkB to do that like he did with some xml-rpc\ninterfaces.\n\nI&#39;ll go start a page in the Wiki...\n\n\n"}}
