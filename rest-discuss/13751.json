This is \nclearly not *the* problem, or the www wouldn&#39;t work.\n\nIt&#39;s not answering the difficulty, but it is trying suggesting that the \nfocus of the difficulty may be either:\n\n1. A difficulty also experienced by the www, so maybe how the www works \ncan give an insight.\nOR\n2. A different difficulty, so maybe we can narrow down where the \ndifficulty really lies.\nOR\n3. It really is a problem that REST and HTTP can&#39;t solve at all.\n\nI&#39;m still not sure what Nina&#39;s concrete problem is I am sure that REST \ncan happily have clients operate across different servers. Maybe Nina&#39;s \nproblem falls into case 1 above and comparison with the wider web can \nbring insight, maybe it falls into case 2 above and the real source of \nthe difficulty isn&#39;t the fact that multiple servers are involved but \nelsewhere (in the communication between them perhaps), and maybe HTTP is \njust the wrong way to go.\n\n&gt; And stop trashing the SOAP stacks.  SOAP specs define real requirements \n&gt; and distributed computing problems.  Sure, the design and implementation \n&gt; of the SOAP stacks suck, but the problems they try and address are real. \n\nI said nothing about the SOAP stacks. The SOAP people seem to think that \nHTTP had gotten some things right too.\n\n\n"}}
