For all these years,\n&gt; we have been educated to use cookie and server session management in\n&gt; most of cookbooks and tutorials. Yet many code libraries are built\n&gt; based on such habits.\n\nTrue, but a lot of the objections we had when cookies were introduced \n(the technical ones, rather than some of the concerns about privacy) are \npretty much the same things we are talking about here. I think any \nexperienced web designer when reading Fielding&#39;s dissertation will find \na lot of it ringing bells with things they&#39;d found to cause either \npractical difficulties, or at least what they knew to be sub-optimal use \nof what HTTP has to offer.\n\n"}}
