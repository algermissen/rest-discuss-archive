But just as Roy Fielding does not\n&gt; believe it is a good thing for a GET to change state, I do not believe it is\n&gt; a good thing to have lots of libraries and frameworks offered with what\n&gt; amounts to arbitrarily differences. I think it should be a best practice to\n&gt; have *consideration* for prior art and not to duplicate prior art if there\n&gt; are no obvious benefits.  I think the unnecessary fragmentation of libraries\n&gt; and frameworks holds back progress. \n&gt; \n\nI believe that at this early state nothing is obvious. We do not fully \nknow what the benefits and disadvantages of each approach are. Many \nexperiments must be performed and systems built before we even realize \nwhat are the right questions to be asking, much less what the answers are.\n\nCurrently all these frameworks have pretty close to zero adoption. Thus \nit is a wonderful time to try many different things. Fragmentation is \nirrelevant at this low level of user interest. We want to fragment as \nmuch as we can before people notice the space. Once they do, we&#39;ll want \nto be ready with best practices, standard frameworks, and the like. \nHowever we can only do that by trying lots of different things now.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
