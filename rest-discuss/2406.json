REST, as I understand it, looks to have a \n&gt; more natural fit with the resource before-and-after state \n&gt; view. So does \n&gt; that mean that REST is in conflict with part of RFC 2616? If it is in \n&gt; conflict, is that a problem for REST, or is it the inevitable \n&gt; consequence of an inconsistency in RFC 2616?\n\nSorry, which part of 2616 do you think is in conflict with REST\nover the issue of idempotence?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
