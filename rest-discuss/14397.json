As one example he gave, two\ndifferent designers coming up with two separate implementations of the\nsame model -- one via RDF another through XHTML.\n\nBut the underlying design, ideally, is the same.\n\nHe&#39;s suggesting something like UML to pull folks out of posting HTTP\ntransactions to &quot;model&quot; the system. HTTP, again, is an implementation\ndetail (granted, popular, ubiquitous...).\n\nPeople learn things in different ways.\n\nOne way is to have someone tell them the theory, then they can apply\nit to validate their interpretations.\n\nArguably, that&#39;s what many have been doing with Roy&#39;s thesis.\n\nOthers, want to see the theory manifested through examples, and from\nthose example learn the theory through seeing it&#39;s application. There\nare some people you can tell them all day long what the theory is,\nfrom a high level, and they just..don&#39;t...get it. At all. They don&#39;t\n&quot;work&quot; at that level.\n\nShow them a dozen examples, and their subtle variations, and these\npeople can see the &quot;theory&quot; shake out from the common elements they\nencounter, and apply it.\n\nI think it will be a great experiment to see REST applied from the\nModel point of view rather than discussing the merits or\ninterpretation of RFC 1234 sub paragraph 87(c).\n\nThen we can learn how others may well implement the model, and how\nthey may vary.\n\nWe may well learn that a Shopping Cart simply is not a good example of\na REST based system. Who knows.\n\nI think it&#39;s a sound plan.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
