When you design so that state is not stored on the server,\n&gt; : &gt; naturally it will have to be stored elsewhere-- it&#39;s part of the\n&gt; : &gt; client&#39;s job.\n&gt; : I have 40M+ resources, so I wasn&#39;t considering this as feasible.\n&gt; : I also think that HTTP indicates that part of a server&#39;s job for\nhandling\n&gt; : PUT is for the client to be able to specify the URI.\n&gt; :\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : &gt; In any case, you can make this plan more robust as follows: when the\n&gt; : &gt; server creates a record for a new document, also store the digest of\nthe\n&gt; : &gt; request that caused it.  Then, if it receives a duplicate request from\n&gt; : &gt; the client, ignore it and return the exiting resource location.\n&gt; : I&#39;m not really worried about duplicate requests - the behavior would be\nto\n&gt; : determine if the submitted content already had been submitted before.\n&gt; Either\n&gt; : via the URI having the client-managed identifier or having the content\n&gt; : contain the client-managed identifier.\n&gt; :\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : &gt; Also, assuming that input documents are not shared, the server could\n&gt; : &gt; provide a query function that returns the output resource given an\ninput\n&gt; : &gt; resource URL.\n&gt; : What would that look like? It&#39;d be a compound URI, right? Whatever it\n&gt; would\n&gt; : look like, I hadn&#39;t considered two resources - one for the stored input\n&gt; : document and one with references to the synthesized output document, but\n&gt; in\n&gt; : order to know about this second resource either the client generates\nthat\n&gt; : resource identifier or that identifer is contained in a representation\nof\n&gt; : the stored input document - and I might as well point to the synthesized\n&gt; : output document directly.\n&gt; : Something to think about though, there&#39;s probably an answer in here\n&gt; : somewhere....\n&gt; :\n&gt; :\n&gt; : (Anyone else with some ideas/comments?
