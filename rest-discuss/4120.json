The translator has added\n&gt; various interpretational decisions based on the appropriate\n&gt; cultural contexts. The various documents may even need to relate\n&gt; to each other in different ways.\n\ni think a representation can be a resource itself, and also be\na representation of another resource.  i haven&#39;t seen anything\nto suggest otherwise (in theory) since i&#39;ve started RESTing.\n\nso in this example, the translation is a representation of\nthe novel, but is also a resource in its own right.  or\nmaybe the translation is just a resource which has a\n&#39;translation_of&#39; relationship with the novel (dare i mention\nRDF?).\n\nbut the key point is that the boundary between resource and\nrepresentation is in the eye of the beholder.  there are no hard\nand fast rules to distinguish between the two.\n\n&gt; The question\n&gt; is not whether they are the same &quot;novel&quot;, but whether it is\n&gt; useful and desireable to return representations of all of them\n&gt; from GETs on a single URI.\n\nquite.\n\n\n"}}
