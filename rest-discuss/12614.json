The thick client logic can be served as \nOO code-on-demand (e.g. Javascript) that augments your basic hypermedia \nformats to provide the functionality you are looking for (this would be \nthe best thick client approach if you want to stay &#39;crawl-able&#39;). When \nthe user performs an object/resource interaction which the client-side \ncode allows; the object/resource(s) can be submitted to your REST \ninterface for final validation and persistence. Modular & OO \ncode-on-demand would allow for relatively easy changes to the logic over \ntime.\n\nI don&#39;t think much is lost by keeping these user actions (aside: are \nthey application states?) away from the server; since they&#39;re very \nunlikely to be entry  points to the application - plus, valid changes \nare eventually submitted to the server for persistence anyway.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\nMichael Schuerig wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m pondering how a RESTful service can best support a highly \n&gt; interactive UI. I think HATEOAS precludes hard-coding application \n&gt; specific intelligence on the client. I&#39;m not sure if it is reconcilable \n&gt; with shipping rules or other metadata to the client. And I have no good \n&gt; idea how to map to resources some of the things I&#39;d need to find out \n&gt; from the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; A case in point from a movie database (my running example for pestering \n&gt; various mailing lists): There are movies and their associated \n&gt; participants, there are unaffiliated people, and there are awards. \n&gt; Everyone&#39;s supreme goal is to receive an award. So the user tries to \n&gt; help, grabs an award and starts to drag it around. But where to drop it? \n&gt; There are all kinds of potential targets around, but on closer scrutiny \n&gt; (requiring intelligence) only some of them fit. You just can&#39;t honor an \n&gt; actor with a Best Picture Oscar. And, after all, the award may already \n&gt; have been given to some other person/movie for the relevant year.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, which one of the, say, 100 potential drop targets are \n&gt; really eligible, is a highly dynamic decision best left to the server. \n&gt; So, given a list of candidate drop targets, how do I RESTfully ask the \n&gt; server to filter them and return only the real contenders?\n&gt;\n&gt; There are two additional constraints I can immediately think of. There \n&gt; are too many candidates to comfortably stuff into the query string of a \n&gt; GET request. Having to ask the server at all is too bad, performance-\n&gt; wise, but unavoidable (AFAICT). Several trips, e.g. for POSTing a new \n&gt; resource and then GETting the needed information from it in another \n&gt; request, is probably too much traffic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m very curious to read your suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
