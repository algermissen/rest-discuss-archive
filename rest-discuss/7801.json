After having completed a certain \n&gt; number of exercises the trainee would be directed to some kind of \n&gt; summary or statistics.\n\nYou have mentioned that in its simplest form this is throwing a die,\nhowever there seem to be more complex forms involved as well. The\ntrainer may have to consider what has already been completed in order to\nmake an appropriate decision. That means that the list of what has been\ncompleted has to be included explicitly or implicitly in the url.\n\nExplicitly (client keeps track of which are completed):\nhttp://example.com/thetrainer?completed=1+2+3+4\n\nImplicitly (server keeps track of which are completed):\nhttp://example.com/thetrainer?student=foo\n(add authentication details here?)\n\nIn the client-side case you would likely need to be rewriting hrefs in\npages your return to the student to include the list of completed items.\nIn the server-side case you would likely need the client to PUT or POST\ninformation about completed courses, possibly in the form of completed\nexam papers for example.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
