I can&#39;t follow any JAX-RS discussions, as they=\r\n use\n&gt; &gt; terminology that I&#39;m unfamiliar with (injection, marshalling,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncontroller, persistence, repository and more) in the REST context,\n&gt; &gt; whil=\r\ne studiously avoiding any use of terms like &quot;representation&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hypert=\r\next constraint&quot;. =A0Simply too much complexity for my tastes,\n&gt; &gt; I underst=\r\nand REST just fine without all the enterprisey lingo (or\n&gt; &gt; Java).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, it seems like you&#39;re comparing apples and oranges here.\n&gt; Y=\r\nou can use JAX-RS as a tool to build an origin server that is both\n&gt; simple=\r\n and modifiable - though, I think in the context of the\n&gt; dissertation, tho=\r\nse properties are guaranteed for the *whole*\n&gt; distributed hypermedia syste=\r\nm, not necessarily individual components\n&gt; within it.\n&gt; \n\nOK, let&#39;s run wit=\r\nh that.  Most -- not all, but most -- frameworks are\nlocked into the IDL ap=\r\nproach (if not IDLs themselves).  Resource A\nallows PUT, therefore the inst=\r\nructions on how to PUT to A must somehow\nbe a product of A.  But the hypert=\r\next constraint allows resource B to\ndescribe how to PUT to A, without requi=\r\nring A to have anything to do\nwith that description, or requiring B to have=\r\n anything to do with A\nbeyond containing A&#39;s URI as its target.\n\nResource B=\r\n can easily be changed to PUT to C, merely by reconfiguring\nthe target URI.=\r\n  Or, the interface to A may be reconfigured by changing\nB (assuming A supp=\r\norts the new configuration, of course).  Frameworks\n(with apologies to thos=\r\ne I don&#39;t mean to lump into my generalizations)\ntypically insist that A&#39;s i=\r\nnterface must be changed by re-coding A.\nFrameworks are great if you&#39;re fol=\r\nlowing this IDL pattern, but\ntypically throw a royal fit when you try getti=\r\nng them to follow the\nhypertext constraint -- the free-form design approach=\r\n the hypertext\nconstraint allows is a very difficult thing to model generic=\r\nally.\n\nThis is what makes the system, as a whole, not very configurable whe=\r\nn\nusing frameworks.  I ought to be able to reconfigure a system just by\ncha=\r\nnging some hyperlinks, not re-thinking the marshalling code or\nchanging an =\r\nIDL (or anything else associated with the distributed-object\nparadigm, as o=\r\npposed to REST&#39;s distributed object *interface* paradigm).\nMy thinking on t=\r\nhis results from my investigation into creating an in-\nhouse REST framework=\r\n -- and deciding against it, in favor of creating a\nconfiguration framework=\r\n for REST systems.  REST 3.2.1:\n\n&quot;One aspect of PF styles that is rarely me=\r\nntioned is that there is an\nimplied &#39;invisible hand&#39; that arranges the conf=\r\niguration of filters in\norder to establish the overall application.  A netw=\r\nork of filters is\ntypically arranged just prior to each activation, allowin=\r\ng the\napplication to specify the configuration of filter components based o=\r\nn\nthe task at hand and the nature of the data streams (configurability).\nTh=\r\nis controller function is considered a separate operational phase of\nthe sy=\r\nstem, and hence a separate architecture, even though one cannot\nexist witho=\r\nut the other.&quot;\n\nThe desirable property I&#39;m after is the inherent configurab=\r\nility of\npipe-and-filter architectures.  The purpose of a framework is to a=\r\nllow\nresources to be stitched together into a coherent whole.  Frameworks\nf=\r\nollowing the IDL paradigm miss the mark on configurability, by being\ninflex=\r\nible once the system is stitched together.  RESTful IDL-based\nsystems are p=\r\nossible, I&#39;m just of the opinion that the results are\nrigid.  I see the app=\r\neal of the IDL approach to framework development\n(even where IDLs aren&#39;t us=\r\ned), but I think this necessarily results in\na very limited view of REST un=\r\nsuitable for my style of development.\n\nThese are my opinions, YMMV.\n\n-Eric\n=\r\n\n"}}
