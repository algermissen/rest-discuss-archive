In fact, if it doesn&#39;t understand a\n&gt; request, it will usually respond with the introspection page.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is running on CherryPy behind Apache; most of the heavy lifting is\n&gt; done by python.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is used to drive the web page at\n&gt; http://uber.engineer.co.summit.oh.us/CSETools/DMS.cfm, which is more\n&gt; user-oriented.\n&gt;\n&gt; One nice thing about the AJAX architecture -- I was able to use GET\n&gt; requests without exposing the users to a bunch of &quot;%20&quot;s and such in\n&gt; the address window of the browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you notice something bogus, let me know, because I will be using\n&gt; the same technologies for my future WS&#39;s, so I&#39;d rather fix it now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ron\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
