If Glenn&#39;s team are going to do &quot;REST like they \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; meant it&quot; to paraphrase Guilherme, I don&#39;t think that JAX-RS is the \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; right way to go.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; But that&#39;s just an opinion. Or is there some technical criticism as well?\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems like the client part of a REST client was not so clear at that \n&gt; time, and there were not so many attemps to create generic consumers. \n&gt; Every service provided their &quot;own specific REST APIs&quot; for their \n&gt; &quot;specific REST services&quot;, i.e. twitter, facebook, and hundreds of others.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first JAX-RS spec did not take hypermedia in account, so if you \n&gt; think about REST without hypermedia, it will not be problem. But it \n&gt; seems like REST depends on using hypermedia, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you believe so and want your consumers to use hypermedia, using a \n&gt; Java framework, you have to rely on Restfulie, Jersey and Restlet, who \n&gt; are trying to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Paul mentioned, its a matter of time for it to enter the JAX-RS specs.\n\nExactly. JAX-RS doesn&#39;t have a client, how can it be the wrong way to go \nyet. The server part that is specified, deals well enough with the \nprotocol elements and doesn&#39;t prevent me from using formats or object \nmodels that contain links. One thing the spec does do well is \nUriBuilder/UriInfo - regardless of whether the builder pattern is to \ntaste, it helps solves a layering problem in Java between service code \nand http code. The JAX-RS impls haven&#39;t gotten in my way yet when it \ncomes to working media types, http, or just applying REST in general, \nwhich is more than I can say for most frameworks on the JVM. I&#39;m free to \nfigure out the data.\n\nWhen it comes to building a client I suspect the problem will be dealing \nwith Java&#39;s type system and generics (I&#39;m not sure C# would be much \nbetter). To get around that in restfulie, it seems to be via hardcoding \n&lt;link rel|href&gt; into a class incorrectly called &#39;Resource&#39;, like this\n\n&lt;http://github.com/caelum/restfulie-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/br/com/caelum/restfulie/Resource.java&gt;\n&lt;http://github.com/caelum/restfulie-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/br/com/caelum/restfulie/Relation.java&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s a car subclass of carpark kind of error - resources aren&#39;t \nrepresentations and not all media types have relations\n\nIf that&#39;s the &#39;right way to go&#39; for hateoas, then perhaps I don&#39;t \nunderstand the concept of hateaos.\n\nBill\n\n\n"}}
