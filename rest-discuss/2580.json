Multiple requests result in the same thing as a\nsingle request.\n\n&gt; When I do\n&gt;\n&gt; GET http://www.server.org/processor?name=Babs+Jensen&phone=88889999\n&gt; HTTP/1.1\n&gt;\n&gt; I should get\n&gt;\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; name=Babs Jensen\n&gt; phone=88889999\nDepends on what was PUT in the first request... was there supposed to be an\nentity body there?\n\nIs there some point to putting the data in query strings rather than in the\nbody?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If I am to expect PUT/GET symmetry as Paul would have it.  Though I\n&gt; don&#39;t think he would disagree with making\n&gt;\n&gt; GET http://www.server.org/processor?name=Babs+Jensen HTTP/1.1\n&gt;\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; name=Babs Jensen\n&gt; phone=88889999\n&gt;\n&gt; also available, as a different representation of the state of Babs\n&gt; (because the first GET isn&#39;t particularly useful to me as a client).\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally, I should expect that POST in this situation:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST http://www.server.org/processor HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Content-type: text/plain\n&gt; Content-length: 30\n&gt;\n&gt; name=Babs Jensen\n&gt; phone=88889999\n&gt;\n&gt; Would result in subsequest GETs producing\n&gt;\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; name=Babs Jensen\n&gt; phone=88889999\n&gt; name=Babs Jensen\n&gt; phone=88889999\n&gt;\n&gt; or something of the sort, as it&#39;s not idempotent.\nDepends on how the server implements it.\n\n\n"}}
