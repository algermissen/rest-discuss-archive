It looks like you&#39;re referring to the XSS\n&gt;  &gt; attacks on JSON that resulted in information disclosure... of course,\n&gt;  &gt; these were services that were &quot;secured&quot; by cookies.\n&gt;\n&gt;  XSS is only one problem. There&#39;s a much more fundamental one with\n&gt;  evaling JSON as JavaScript. Shipping executable code around and then\n&gt;  evaluating it without security checks is dangerous. Again, the Google\n&gt;  search I recommended will lead you to plenty of deatils on these attacks\n&gt;  if you&#39;re interested.\n\nOf, you mean calling eval? Yes, executing arbitrary code is bad for\nsecurity. Most libraries check the message against a regex. A\ndedicated parseJSON function would be better, but the regex seems to\nwork. Have a look at the one in json.js, and please report any new\nflaws you find. :)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The possibility of executing JSON with a script tag does make some\n&gt;  &gt; attacks easier, but it doesn&#39;t make anything new possible. There are a\n&gt;  &gt; variety of technologies available that will preserve confidentiality\n&gt;  &gt; and prevent replay attacks. The payload format doesn&#39;t matter that\n&gt;  &gt; much.\n&gt;\n&gt;  However the parser matters a great deal. Of course you can use a real\n&gt;  parser on JSON, but many programs don&#39;t. That JSON can be and is treated\n&gt;  as executable code is a major flaw in its design, one XML doesn&#39;t share.\n\nXML is treated as executable code all the time.\n\n&gt;  JSON, by design, encourages poor security and a variety of attacks.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;ve backed this up.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
