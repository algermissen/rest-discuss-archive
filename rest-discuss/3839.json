I don&#39;t see why WebDAV would be a special case here,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; so that sounds wrong too.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you please explain why you think this is wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; I just don&#39;t think that it is a WebDAV specific problem, so I would\n&gt; expect WebDAV to use whatever status would be appropriate for any\n&gt; other HTTP application.\n\nSo you think this is wrong because WebDAV added a new status code? I can&#39;t\nagree -- the whole point of WebDAV is to *extend* HTTP/1.1 (with new\nmethods, request headers...), and therefore adding a new specific 4xx status\ncode because none of the existing ones fitted well seems to be absolutely\nright thing to do.\n\n&gt; I tend to favour 400, but it looks as if 422 was invented for WebDAV\n&gt; because it was decided that 400 couldn&#39;t be used to report errors that\n&gt; weren&#39;t strictly syntactic?\n\nJulian\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n"}}
