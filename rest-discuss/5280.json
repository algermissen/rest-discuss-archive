There is no guarantee that\n&gt; http://example.com/customer/2345 is the next unused resource name. I\n&gt; contend there is no way to _reliably_ determine what the next unused\n&gt; resource name is.\nThere are large number of unused resources, what is your definition of \n&#39;next&#39;, and what is the significance of sequence for these resources?\n\nWith PUT, the client could decide the URI to use & have an algorithm for \ndetermining some  (locally) unused URI - but it seems that you need some \nsort of sequencing or pre-approved set of URI. Perhaps the server could \npre-allocate a large number of URI that satisfy the requirements & the \nclient could GET that list. The client might be able to use a request header \nof &quot;if-none-match: *&quot; to prevent a collision.\n\n\n\n"}}
