If you think a 404 response is a resource, \n&gt; how about,\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://this.host.does.not.exist.com/nothing-here-folks\n\nA 404 response is not a resource. Nor is that URI a resource. The question\nis whether it identifies a resource, or whether you just made it up\nrandomly to demonstrate a point. If you just made it up randomly, then the\nURI does not identify a resource. (In my opinion. Again, it&#39;s a subtle\ndifference, because made up URIs can still identify resources, even the\nthis.host.does... etc. variety. But, made up URIs need not identify\nresources. Perhaps a good example is John Smith of Number 42 High St,\nwhich is an identifier for a resource (some guy). Also, Frodo Baggins of\nBag End, which is also an identifier for a resource, in this case a\nfictional character, so it&#39;s not something that you can access directly\nover HTTP. However FOOP!SQUIGGLE, which I just typed in randomly, is not a\nresource, nor is Mr FOOP!SQUIGGLE of Number 42 High St, as this identifier\ndoes not identify a resource to which I (nor anyone else) has assigned\nmeaning).\n\n&gt; The point at issue is whether or not we can treat resources as being \n&gt; defined in terms of URIs ... this is a coherent view, tho&#39; not mine.\n&gt; At the very least for that we need it to be the case that every resource \n&gt; has a URI, and that every URI has a resource (irrespective of whether \n&gt; or not there&#39;s a server prepared to return a useful representation). \n&gt; The possibility of unnamed resources is inconsistent with that view, \n&gt; clearly.\n\nNot every URI identifies a resource, as the example you gave shows. Two\nURIs may both return 404, and yet one identifies a resource (such as my\nfuture news example) and one does not (such as your random URI example).  \nResult of dereferencing does not indicate resourcefulness; the URI must\nidentify something which has been assigned meaning by someone (or some\nprocess, in the case of programs generating/naming resources).\n\n&gt; But the only good argument I&#39;ve seen against the claim that particular \n&gt; URIs might be empty (have no resource, not name anything, etc., etc.) \n&gt; is that there&#39;s nothing more to being a resource than having a URI and \n&gt; that the existence of a corresponding resource is guaranteed by \n&gt; definition. IOW, the argument depends on the definition. But allowing \n&gt; unnamed resources means abandoning the definition, so we might as well \n&gt; be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and allow resourceless names too.\n\nResourceless names are certainly possible, nameless resources will exist \nuntil we have a method to identify every possible resource, which may take \na while.\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
