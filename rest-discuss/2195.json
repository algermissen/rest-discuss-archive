This is the\n&gt; thinking behind /purchase-orders/3242342342 &lt;-- this URL should be\n&gt; understood to mean there is a resource &#39;3242343342&#39; within the\n&gt; resource &#39;purchase-orders&#39;.\n\nAs I understand it, this is absolutely wrong.  Absolutely nothing should be\nassumed based on what is in the URI.  It is just as valid to have the\nfollowing two URLs where the first is a container of the second:\n\n/purchase-orders\n/3242342342\n\nOnly the server can apply meaning to the internal structure of a URI.  The\nclient cannot assume anything.  Period.  All it knows is that when it POSTed\ndata to &quot;/purchase-orders&quot;, it got back &quot;/3242342342&quot;.  You can then say\nthat the first is a container of the second, but only because the server\ntold that it was.\n\n(boy, if I am wrong about this, I am chuckin&#39; the entire REST stuff and go\njoin a monestary that&#39;s never heard of the stuff....)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
