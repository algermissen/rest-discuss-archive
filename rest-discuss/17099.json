The debate is about creating media types to\n&gt; trigger specific m2m =\r\napplication behaviors, which is the sort of\n&gt; coupling we&#39;re seeking to avo=\r\nid by using REST in the first place.  My\n&gt; XBEL example is m2m, but the app=\r\nlication behavior is beyond the scope\n&gt; of what a media type can do -- whet=\r\nher to import it as bookmarks or\n&gt; transform it into HTML for manipulation =\r\nis dictated by hypertext, not\n&gt; the string appearing in Content-Location.\n&gt;=\r\n \n\nWell is that the debate? You seem to be arguing against using media type=\r\ns specific to the resource types in the application. For example:\napplicati=\r\non/customer+xml\napplication/account+xml\napplication/transaction+xml\nsay for=\r\n a banking application.\nI think many folks in this thread would likely agre=\r\ne with you. \nLet&#39;s move past that and assume we are not suggesting a media =\r\ntype for each type of resource (or even a subset of resource types).\nNow le=\r\nt&#39;s instead ask: for a given machine-client, is it better to use HTML (or a=\r\nnother existing format) with RDFa/microformats/etc. layered on top or to de=\r\nsign a hypermedia format specifically for that type of client. What are the=\r\n pros and cons of layering a data model (that is not universally understood=\r\n by all clients supporting the format) on top of a standard format vs. defi=\r\nning a new *standard* (or perhaps *standardizable*) format for a client whe=\r\nn existing formats do not seem to be sufficient?\n\nFor example, in a bank I =\r\ncan use HTML for the tellers machines, web banking (and likely even Automat=\r\ned Teller Machines) and VoiceXML for phone banking apps and use conneg (or =\r\neven just separate URI spaces) to choose between them.\n\nIf I want a RESTful=\r\n interface for automated check processing machines would it be better to:\na=\r\n) create an format specifically for check processing machines (not specific=\r\n to my banks resource types, e.g. application/checkproc+xml); or\nb) use HTM=\r\nL with a &quot;check processor&quot; data model layered on top.\n\nI prefer (a) and I d=\r\non&#39;t think it violates any REST constraints at all. Standardizing the forma=\r\nt would allow a bank to buy check processing machines from any vendor, plug=\r\n them in, configure a single URI and go. You could argue that a standard da=\r\nta model layered on top of HTML could do the same thing. (I have no substan=\r\ntial background in the banking industry -- maybe there are business reasons=\r\n that this makes no sense but I hope the example conveys the idea.) I think=\r\n the differences between the two approaches are subtle and worth discussing=\r\n, but let&#39;s get past the is/isn&#39;t RESTful arguments.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
