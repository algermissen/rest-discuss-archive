That seems to be a weird approach, as\n&gt;the 404/410 condition indicates &quot;nothing is there&quot;, so any kind of\n&gt;If-Match IMHO should cause a 412 on that resource.\n&gt;\n\nWell, the If-Match has to match the ETag on the 410 response, if it \ndoesn&#39;t then the response is 412.  I&#39;ve been pondering this a bit \nfurther, let&#39;s say the resource hasn&#39;t been deleted, and a conditional \nDELETE comes in with an If-Match which matches the 200 representation&#39;s \nETag.  Then the resource is deleted, and the response code is 404.  \nUnconditional DELETE requests change the response to 410, still.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
