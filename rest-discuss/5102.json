However, there are a lot of privacy  \n&gt; &gt; conc=\r\nerns with transmitting SSNs in plain text.  How would I \n&gt; be able  \n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n design a REST service when my primary identifier is information  \n&gt; &gt; that=\r\n I don&#39;t want to be part of the GET URL?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was envisioning the serv=\r\nice to have something like:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; https://example.com/Customer/444556666\n=\r\n&gt; Since URIs are completely opaque to the consuming services, you can  \n&gt; e=\r\nqually well use arbitrary IDs in your URIs and do a server side  \n&gt; mapping=\r\nto SSNs.\n\nThis is what I was thinking in option 3 below.  But how would the=\r\n client know which arbitrary ID to use?  With the size of my user base, I d=\r\non&#39;t think that access-by-traversal will scale.  I need some sort of search=\r\n functionality.  The most widely used scenario is to look a person up by th=\r\neir SSN.\n\nSo if the client does know the SSN but does not know the arbitrar=\r\ny ID, how would the client look up the ID?\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; (Where 444-55-6666 is the=\r\n customer&#39;s SSN)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see some alternatives:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Don&#39;t use SSN =\r\nas a primary identifier.  Easier said than done.   \n&gt; &gt; The industry is mov=\r\ning this way, but it may be many years \n&gt; (if ever)  \n&gt; &gt; before they are n=\r\not used at all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) Use Post for queries also because then the SSN w=\r\nould be  \n&gt; &gt; encrypted with the SSL request.  This isn&#39;t very consistent w=\r\nith  \n&gt; &gt; the REST patterns.\n&gt; &gt; 3) Walk the service tree.  Have requests s=\r\ntart at https:// \n&gt; &gt; example.com/Customers and then return the list of URL=\r\ns with the  \n&gt; &gt; address to get the specific customer information.  However=\r\n this  \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t scale.  We currently have over 50 million customers.   =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Searching on common name doesn&#39;t work either because it isn&#39;t even  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; close to unique.\n&gt; If I understand you correctly, you intend to have the=\r\n client \n&gt; actually  \n&gt; construct the URLs based on SSN knowledge? That is =\r\nnot good REST  \n&gt; practice anyhow (URI would not be treated as being opaque=\r\n).\n&gt; Can you say more about the intended interaction between client and  \n&gt;=\r\n server?\n&gt; \n&gt; If the intent is a query, then maybe POST is really the way t=\r\no go in  \n&gt; your case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Ti=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n\n"}}
