And that the\n&gt;  &gt; physical &quot;resource&quot; behind the covers is the same?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Is there a name in REST-speak for that physical thing behind the\n&gt;  &gt; covers that is the same?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; (Or am I still thinking incorrectly about this REST stuff?)\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I can answer the REST part of this: If you are the authority\n&gt; at example.com, and you assert/enforce that /topTenProducts/productB\n&gt; and /products/productB are two names for the same resource, then\n&gt; that&#39;s exactly what you have: two names, one resource.\n\nAnd a Content-Location header MAY be used to supply the URI when the \nrequested resource is available from a different location. This would \nallow you to have a model where you establish a definitive URI for the \nresource (say under /products/productB). This would allow you to say \nthat a DELETE request is only permitted against the definitive URI.\n\nAnother possible model is to think of the alternative URIs like UNIX \nhard links - you can keep deleting them until the last one is gone.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sameness = identity = resource; that much is clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; What happens to a resource that appears (by virtue of being\n&gt; named) in multiple containers when a container is deleted\n&gt; is not so clear  But I don&#39;t think REST covers that either, at\n&gt; least not yet.  (It might be fun and useful to model containment\n&gt; semantics.)\n&gt; \n&gt; But I can synthesize the following argument.  If DELETE on a\n&gt; container is interpreted to mean &#39;deep delete&#39;, such that it implies\n&gt; DELETE on all (recursively) contained resources, then any\n&gt; resource contained will be zapped, regardless of whether it\n&gt; was contained elsewhere as well.  This should be true in any\n&gt; situation where a resource has multiple names, regardless of\n&gt; any containment semantics or absence of same.  For instance,\n&gt; if /a and /b denote the same resource, and &#39;DELETE /a&#39; happens,\n&gt; then &#39;GET /b&#39; should result in &#39;not found&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s my understanding.  Could somebody please check that\n&gt; and correct me where/if I&#39;ve gone astray?\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Yahoo!
