Hypertext has\nalready been superseeded by hypermedia. mayby the time has come to\ntalk of Hyperresources?\n\nI do think &quot;hypermedia service/API&quot; is nice but what about:\n\n   Hyperlinked Resource Transfer Service\n\nI do realize that HyRTS is not a good acronym. Maybe we could just\ncall it a Web Service? Oh wait, that name has already been highjacked\nby a technology that&#39;s not really Web-oriented ...hmm ...
