Wiki editing is the\n&gt; obvious exception, but that&#39;s best done from the browser (WYSIWYG\n&gt; editing), not via PUT in a form IMO.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ideally, we&#39;d have both though.\n\nThing is, isn&#39;t what we have: ie support through Javascript, actually\nthe ideal situation?\n\nREST acknowledges the role of client side code. Without it the browser\nhas to be generic enough to support all possible UI scenarios, or\nconstrain to one, which means those features just get ignored.\n\nBetter to make a user agent with rich, adaptable, behaviour.\n\n\nIt&#39;s the same problem with authentication... fixed behaviour gets\nignored. Scriptable behaviour wouldn&#39;t be.\n\n\nThe only thing wrong with this picture is the poor support for\nJavascript in non-graphical browsers. I&#39;m not sure why that is... but\nit is changing, just very slowly.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
