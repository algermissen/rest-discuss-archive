That states it a little bit\nmore clearly than application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\n\n&gt; * In most cases, the form will be interspersed with human readable text, \n&gt; to explain the meaning of the parameters (a machine-understandable way \n&gt; to explain parameter meaning, sounds like an AI problem...)\n\nWow? What websites are you using?!\n\n\n&gt; * You (the user of a web browser, or a piece of software \n&gt; programmatically using the server) populate the parameters and POST them \n&gt; to the URL you discovered via the form.\n&gt;\n&gt; * You get back a response, which might be an error message about a \n&gt; parameter problem, or might be a respresentation of the &quot;answer&quot;.\n\nXForms or some other form describing syntax will probably help a lot\nwith this.
