I am particulary interested in  \n&gt; clever ideas how to document interactions that run through an  \n&gt; intermediary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have started out giving both, request issueing components and  \n&gt; resources life lines in a sequence diagram and documenting HTTP  \n&gt; requests as ordinary method calls. This feels quite natural and  \n&gt; provides good overviews of related HTTP interactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is that I would like to document calls that run through  \n&gt; intermediaries in a clean way but since in that cases the receiver of  \n&gt; the method call is not the &#39;logical&#39; receiver things become a bit  \n&gt; difficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas? Has anyone done something like this before?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n\n"}}
