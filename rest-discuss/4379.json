One of the recommendations I&#39;m having\n&gt; difficulty visualizing is how I can eliminate client\n&gt; session management.\n\nREST does not recommend that you eliminate client session management!\nIn the words of Roy:\n&quot;...communication must be stateless in nature,...such that each request from\nclient to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand\nthe request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server.\nSession state is therefore kept entirely on the client.&quot;\n\nThis architectural choices has two design trade-off&#39;s:\n1) &quot;...it may decrease network performance by increasing the repetitive data\n(per-interaction overhead) sent in a series of requests, since that data cannot\nbe left on the server in a shared context.&quot;\n2) &quot;In addition, placing the application state on the client-side reduces the\nserver&#39;s control over consistent application behavior, since the application\nbecomes dependent on the correct implementation of semantics across multiple\nclient versions.&quot;\n\nRoy goes on to say:\n&quot;Cookie interaction fails to match REST&#39;s model of application state... As a\nresult, cookie-based applications on the Web will never be reliable. The same\nfunctionality should have been accomplished via anonymous authentication and\ntrue client-side state.&quot;\n\nAnd here is what your looking for:\n&quot;A state mechanism that involves preferences can be more efficiently implemented\nusing judicious use of context-setting URI rather than cookies, where judicious\nmeans one URI per state rather than an unbounded number of URI due to the\nembedding of a user-id.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; In prototyping the current non-REST system we\n&gt; discovered several limitations related to the phone\n&gt; handsets:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Some handsets have a maximum URL length of 255\n&gt; characters.  Passing session state in the URL along\n&gt; with co-ordinate pairs frequently took us above this\n&gt; limit.\n&gt; - Cookie support cannot be guaranteed for the phone\n&gt; browser precluding the use of native session-tracking\n&gt; mechanisms on the server\n&gt; - Variations in WML rendering require document\n&gt; transformation to phone-specific WML if optimal\n&gt; presentation is to be achieved\n\nPaul&#39;s approach should get you around the first 2 limitations. The last\nlimitation that you mention is related to representations and is actully\ndependent on your application architecture.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nSandeep\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
