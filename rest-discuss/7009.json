Email overload. Sorry.\n\n&gt;&gt; I would say *HTML* can&#39;t use URI fragment identifiers for other than\nbookmarks.  \n\nGood correction. I meant HTML and I mis-spoke.\n\n&gt;&gt; So a URI fragment is not anything remotely like a range request, or a\nrequest for a partial resource.  \n\nAs an aside, I see that as a shame for usability even though I understand\nyour explanation regarding the intentions. Unless I miss my guess, there is\nno way just using a browser (i.e. w/o writing a program) to be able retrieve\na segment of a page.  IOW, I can&#39;t include such a link on a blog nor can I\nsend such a link in an email.  The shame is that the combination of\nURI+HTTP+HTML doesn&#39;t provide any way to do that.\n\n&gt;&gt; The problem under discussion here remains the case of &quot;how do we avoid\ntransferring the entire document to scale the application more efficiently?&quot;\n\n\nPlease let me clarify that statement by tacking on &quot;...and do in a manner\nthat is RESTful where &quot;RESTful&quot; was previously stated by someone to require\nthe transfer of the entire resource defined by a URI.&quot;  (Yes it would be a\nrun-on sentence. :)  One person suggestion is another URI, but someone else\nstated that in some cases it was okay to use a fragement identifier, and I\nquestioned that because it seemed inconsistent and possibly not even\nworkable.\n\n&gt;&gt; Now that you&#39;ve taken a simple, concise example thoroughly off-topic and\nrequired me to use ever-longer replies to straighten out your conflation\nbetween range requests, document fragments and URI fragment identifiers it\nseems to me that my explanations are beginning to exceed the length of the\nRFCs you don&#39;t appear to be reading.  \n\nPlease do not assume that I am not reading them.  By now I have (literally)\nan 8&quot; stack of documents printed 2-up, front & back (using Fineprint) that I\nhave all read and marked up during the past month (and a few I have read\nseveral times.) But, as I hope you can appreciate, I don&#39;t have photographic\nmemory so there are parts I don&#39;t remember and there are parts I didn&#39;t\nunderstand for lack of examples and for poor writing (i.e. passive voice.)  \n\n I headed down this road taking this crash course in REST, W3C specs, IETF\nspecs, etc. so I don&#39;t end up looking like an ignorant ass when I start\npublishing articles about URLs *and* I&#39;m about three weeks behind where I&#39;d\nhoped to be by now.  Please forgive me that I can&#39;t learn in a few day the\nfine details of specifications and theory that have been developed over more\nthan they past 15 years. I&#39;m good, but I&#39;m not that good.  \n\nSo, sorry if I frustrated you. :)\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
