For\n&gt;&gt; instance an issue cannot be reopened if it isn&#39;t resolved or\n&gt;&gt; closed. Furthermore, let&#39;s say I have a resolved issue but I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; conducting a PUT with state = &quot;Open&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then the server should return 409, since trying to PUT the status\n&gt; Open to the bug conflicts with the current state of the resource.\n&gt; That is a textbook application of 409, in fact.\n&gt;\n&gt; * erlingwl &lt;erlingwl@...&gt; [2008-05-05 11:45]:\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but doesn&#39;t this break with the REST Server-side\n&gt;&gt; statelessness principle? Hmm.. I thought maybe that\n&gt;&gt; incrementing state would be just as wrong as incrementing a\n&gt;&gt; value.. but as you say, the client do know the state, and it\n&gt;&gt; sends the new state with the PUT..\n&gt;\n&gt; The statelessness issue is highly misunderstood. The server\n&gt; obviously *has* to keep state *somehow*, no? Otherwise, how could\n&gt; it ever store the content of a PUT?\n&gt;\n&gt; No, what statelessness means is that the server should not keep\n&gt; track of what the client has done in previous requests\n&gt; implicitly. State on the server should be resource state, ie.\n&gt; exposed through a resource available under a URI and manipulated\n&gt; by the client explicitly via the verbs other than GET. Client\n&gt; state, or application state in REST lingo, remains on the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Remember that REST means Representational State Transfer? That is\n&gt; exactly what that term means: the server affects the application\n&gt; state on the client by sending a representations of a resource,\n&gt; and likewise the client affects resource state on the server by\n&gt; sending a representation of a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nMed vennlig hilsen\nErling Wegger Linde\n\n"}}
