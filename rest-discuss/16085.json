I was under the impression that the content sent by the client would be cached by intermediaries - but I suppose the server can just respond with &quot;don&#39;t cache this&quot; response headers (or should it respond with the augmented content?).\n\nPUT invalidates caches, but responses are not cacheable:\n\n&quot;If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale.

In this system I would like the client to be able to set the state of a particular resource, but if the normal representation of that resource has handy hypertext links - wouldn&#39;t the client need to send content with those exact hypertext links? If so that seems fragile as the links typically are determined by the server and this implies the client also needs to be able to determine those.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The server is free to validate them and either throw an error if\n&gt;&gt; they&#39;re changed or (what I usually end up doing) just ignore the\n&gt;&gt; change.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Specifically, I&#39;m working on system to manage two-party contracts (really, just orders) and would like to support individual &#39;contributions&#39; from each party and a master &#39;reconciled&#39; contract that is composed from the two contributions based on business rules. I would like the master &#39;reconciled&#39; contract to link to the composite contracts and also for the composite contracts to have a link back to the final reconciled contract that results from rules being enforced. How would a client use PUT to modify a &#39;contribution&#39; resource if that resource is supposed to have a link somewhere that the client doesn&#39;t know about?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Easily.
