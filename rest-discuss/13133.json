Maybe you could describe the question\n&gt;         by stating an example of the choices ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can we treat this as two different questions ?\n&gt;\n&gt; a) How is a state adequately defined : A URI such as GET /resource \n&gt; adequately defines the application state  The http headers / metadata \n&gt; have no implication on the application state. Whether you choose to \n&gt; view a document in a PDF or HTML or perhaps even as a PNG has no \n&gt; bearing on the application. The application state is always the same \n&gt; for the same URI irrespective of the content type.\n&gt;\n\nHi Dhananjay,\n\nWhy would application state always be the same for all representations \nof a resource?\n\n&gt; b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a question \n&gt; for the author of a browser to answer. If we had a browser which say \n&gt; allowed you to also describe the accept headers before making the URI, \n&gt; then let us for a moment suggest that such a browser the bookmark \n&gt; perhaps could contain the accept header. However we don&#39;t have such \n&gt; browsers (I haven&#39;t seen one at least). But it is likely that \n&gt; programmatic clients may want to choose to store such URIs for say \n&gt; resuming later. Such a browser is again unlikely to &#39;break&#39; if it is \n&gt; able to accept and parse various content types with equal capability \n&gt; or works with only one content type which it always specifically \n&gt; requests. However it could break if in a particular situation it has \n&gt; requested a particular resource with a non default accept headers and \n&gt; that is specifically needed to resume further. In such a situation, \n&gt; perhaps the bookmark could store the accept header.\n\nThat is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n\n&gt; But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an attribute of \n&gt; the application state - they are an application of the conversation \n&gt; state (though I am open to be challenged since I myself am not so \n&gt; terribly convinced about it).\n\nI don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application of the \nconversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between \napplication and resource, given communication in RESTful systems is \n(supposed to be) stateless.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
