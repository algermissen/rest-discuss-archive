Doing an HTTP POST the REST way\n\nFrom comments on my REST tutorial I have realized that to successfully\nargue the case for REST I need to include an example of doing an HTTP\nPOST.  To my embarrassment, I am not sure that I understand the REST\nposition on HTTP POST...  \n\nIn my REST tutorial I have an example of a fictitious company, Parts\nDepot, Inc.  The company wishes to make available on the Web the\nfollowing services:\n\n(a) A service to enable a client to get a list of parts.\n(b) A service to enable a client to get detailed information about a\nparticular part.\n(c) A service to enable a client to submit a Purchase Order (PO). \n\nClearly, an HTTP GET is the way to implement services (a) and (b).  For\nservice (c) a client will want to do an HTTP POST.  (Correct?)  I would\nlike to consider further how service (c) would be implemented in a\nREST-ful manner.\n\nMy understanding is that an XML Schema (or DTD) would be created by\nParts Depot, Inc which defines the format that the PO must take.  A\nclient then will create a PO instance document which conforms to the XML\nSchema, and submit that XML document as the payload of an HTTP POST. \nCorrect?  With a SOAP implementation of this service the only difference\nwould be that the XML document would be wrapped within a SOAP envelope\n(and there may be a SOAP header).  Is this a correct assessment of the\ndifferences between REST and SOAP for this service?  Is the ability to\nadd headers in SOAP going to be an advantage over REST in this\nscenario?  \n2. Distinguishing characteristics of REST?\n\nI am not clear on what characterizes a REST architecture.  For example,\nconsider this HTTP GET for getting information about the part whose id\nis 00345:\n\n   http://www.parts-depot.com?part=00345\n\nIt is my understanding that this is not REST-ful.  The REST approach\nwould be to use this URL:\n\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/part/00345\n\nWhy is the later REST-ful but the former is not?  May I conclude that in\na REST-ful system you would not use URLs with query strings?  \n\nCan someone enumerate the distinguishing characteristics of a REST\nsystem?  In other words, how will I recognize a REST service when I see\none?\n\nThanks!  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
