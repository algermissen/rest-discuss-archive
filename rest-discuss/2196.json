Not all containers create subordinate resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my abstract model, and in RestRDF, I presented the following\n&gt; hierarchy;\n&gt; \n&gt; Resource\n&gt;   -&gt; Container\n&gt;      -&gt; StatePreservingContainer (ne IdentityPreservingContainer) \n(1)\n&gt; (1) is meant to describe containers who create a resource and \nreturn a 201\n\n&gt; &gt; Ok, let me try again, because there is a lot of confusion on this \n&gt; &gt; point:\n&gt; &gt; *If* the resource is a container, \n&gt; &gt; then it is *allowed* to post a subordinate\n&gt; &gt; and request that the server create a new resource\n&gt; &gt; linked to the container.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nope, at least not with this definition of container.  \n&gt; And FWIW, I think it&#39;s pretty standard.  \n&gt; It would be equivalent to a tuple space, or an\n&gt; OpenDoc container, or a Java Beans Context, etc..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or would you put it some other way?\n&gt; \n&gt; As above.\n\nNope?!! I thought I said the same thing.  \nWhat&#39;s the difference?  Where am I wrong?\nI don&#39;t get it at all.\n\n&gt; &gt; The reason I&#39;m belaboring the point is that people read into \nthese \n&gt; &gt; statements all kinds of things, and it would be possible to read \ninto \n&gt; &gt; your statement that my assertion was incorrect, and you cannot \nPOST a \n&gt; &gt; subordinate resource to a container and have the server create a \nnew \n&gt; &gt; resource for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, ok.  I certainly don&#39;t mean that.  I just mean that if you only\n&gt; know the thing is a container, it may or may not create a resource \nfor\n&gt; you.  If you know it&#39;s a StatePreservingContainer, then you know \nthat\n&gt; it will.\n\nOk, I&#39;m gonna keep trying until I get this right.\n\n*If* the resource is a StatePreservingContainer, \nand if I post the proper request to create a subordinate resource,\nthen the container will create a resource and return a 201.\n\nBy the way, I&#39;ve tried to repeat the same thing you wrote in slightly \ndifferent words three times now and been told I was wrong by both you \nand Walden Mathews and still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. \nI know this is possible, and you seem to agree it&#39;s possible, but \nthere is obviously some sublety that I am missing.\n\nAlso, the name StatePreservingContainer is not very clear, at least \nto me. Nor is IdentityPreservingContainer. But maybe that&#39;s because \nI&#39;m still missing some subtlety.\n\nI think this is an important capability for meeting business \nrequirements.  I&#39;m happy to revert to a hybrid of REST + SOAP, but am \nstill trying to figure out how far I can go with pure REST.\nAnd I do need to know how to describe it so that it meets the \nbusiness requirements and will not get shot down by the REST gang.\n\n\n\n"}}
