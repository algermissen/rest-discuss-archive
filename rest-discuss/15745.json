So\nit defeats the purpose of learning, when you re=\r\n-state my position as\nsome hard-and-fast rule, instead of reconsidering you=\r\nr understanding of\nterms like &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;representation&quot; to fit with h=\r\now others have\ncome to understand them (and give the same advice about assi=\r\ngning URIs\nto variants, hardly a short list).\n\nTo have a representation, on=\r\ne must first have a resource.  There is no\nsuch thing as a representation w=\r\nithout an identifier.  You can have\nsteady-states without identifiers, and =\r\nit is entirely possible to have\nresources without identifiers.  A resource =\r\nwithout an identifier only\nviolates the constraint if the resource is impor=\r\ntant to the system.\n\nCompressed/uncompressed representations share an ident=\r\nifier.  These\nvariants are also resources in their own right, and it is of =\r\ncourse\npossible to assign them URIs (resource.html / resource.html.zip).  B=\r\nut,\nthese resources are unimportant to the system, so it does not violate\nt=\r\nhe identification of resources constraint to omit their URIs.\n\nIn my exampl=\r\ne of a resource that negotiates between Atom and HTML, I\nalso enable compre=\r\nssion, so the set of members includes four variants.\nI only assign URIs to =\r\nthe HTML and Atom variants, because only those two\nvariants are important e=\r\nnough as resources to warrant identifiers.\nNote that each compressed/uncomp=\r\nressed variant of the Atom/HTML\nnegotiated resource, also receives a second=\r\n URI -- proving they&#39;re also\nresources in their own right despite not havin=\r\ng their own URIs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;ve already agreed that the choice to exp=\r\nose the\n&gt; representations as resources in their own right is a matter of\n&gt; =\r\njudgement/pragmatism/&quot;best-practice&quot;\n&gt;\n\nWhere, in all the times I&#39;ve stated=\r\n that assigning URIs to variants is\nto apply the identification of resource=\r\ns constraint, could you possibly\nhave gotten the notion that I consider thi=\r\ns a judgement call?\n\nI have repeatedly stated that this is a best RESTful p=\r\nractice, and that\nexcept for compression, failure to assign URIs to variant=\r\ns violates\nREST as surely as it violates RFC 2616&#39;s SHOULD.  Just because s=\r\nomething\nis a best practice outside the realm of REST, does not imply that =\r\nit\nisn&#39;t a REST constraint -- that&#39;s just par for the course.\n\nAs always, I=\r\n reject out-of-hand the notion that REST is so vague and\nsubjective that th=\r\nere exist any &quot;alternate interpretations&quot; or that\nREST is so ivory-tower th=\r\nat it isn&#39;t pragmatic.  The fact that applying\nobjective REST constraints i=\r\nn a pragmatic fashion results in tangible\nbenefits is not some quirk of fat=\r\ne, accident or coincidence -- it&#39;s by\ndesign.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; it seems to me that it&#39;s=\r\n even beyond HTTP, since all the control data\n&gt; for describing discrepancie=\r\ns in server side &#39;selection&#39; of variants\n&gt; already exist in 2616.\n&gt; \n\nThe o=\r\nnly way to resolve conneg discrepancies is to follow REST, by\nsending the o=\r\nptimal variant and a list of alternates.  This may take\nthe form of the Lin=\r\nk: or Alternates: headers, which I will grant already\nexist in HTTP (not so=\r\n much in practice), or a list of &lt;link/&gt; elements\n(external to HTTP), it do=\r\nesn&#39;t matter which.  How are any of these\npossible without assigning URIs t=\r\no variants?\n\nThe common practice of assigning URIs to variants and listing =\r\nthem with\nrel=3D&#39;alternate&#39; is not tied to any one markup language, or any\n=\r\nparticular protocol for that matter.  This has everything to do with\nREST, =\r\nand as I keep saying, this REST constraint is reflected in RFC\n2616&#39;s SHOUL=\r\nD.  It is a matter of HTTP protocol *because* it&#39;s a matter\nof REST (and vi=\r\nce-versa).\n\nThe REST style is derived from the early Web.  REST is an effor=\r\nt to\ndescribe an architecture to fit the reality of HTTP as a scalable\ndist=\r\nributed application protocol with content negotiation.  REST\nanalyzes *why*=\r\n HTTP allows even conneg to scale, then applies this\nanalysis to inform the=\r\n evolution of the Web, i.e. RFC 2616.\n\nAny dissertation is a philosophical =\r\nevaluation of some aspect of the\nnatural world.  Roy&#39;s thesis is a philosop=\r\nhical evaluation of how and\nwhy the early Web succeeded.  Alternate dissert=\r\nations are possible\nusing different terminology, but if such alternatives h=\r\nave the same\ngoal of explaining how and why the Web allows scalable conneg,=\r\n it&#39;s\nhard to imagine that they wouldn&#39;t somehow reflect the need to send\nU=\r\nRIs in Content-Location, or the need to inform clients of alternates\nby sen=\r\nding a list of URIs.\n\nHTTP isn&#39;t the only protocol that REST could be used =\r\nto inform the\ndesign of.  But it&#39;s likewise hard to imagine that some alter=\r\nnative\nprotocol will evolve that retains the anarchic scalability of HTTP 1=\r\n.1,\nwhile negating all the reasons for the imprecision of conneg.  Some\nnew=\r\n protocol would still need the guidance of REST, which is to send\nthe optim=\r\nal variant first, with a list of alternates.  Presumably I can\nuse this new=\r\n protocol to send an HTML representation with a bunch of\nlink rel=3D&#39;altern=\r\nate&#39; elements with non-overlapping URIs.  It is\ntherefore hard to imagine s=\r\nome new RESTful protocol where those URIs\nwouldn&#39;t be used to distinguish o=\r\nne variant from another a la Content-\nLocation, in favor of some sort of Et=\r\nag-like system.\n\nSo I still don&#39;t see the daylight between REST and HTTP on=\r\n the issue of\nassigning URIs to variants.  It would be difficult to look at=\r\n existing\nconneg systems which scale to the Web (like the BBC website), see=\r\n that\nthey&#39;re indeed assigning URIs to variants using Content-Location, and=\r\n\nconclude that doing so is somehow not relevant.  I do not find it in\nany w=\r\nay shocking that my understanding of REST leads me to conclude\nthat followi=\r\nng RFC 2616&#39;s SHOULD is RESTful.  Correctly understood,\nREST is the reason =\r\nwhy that SHOULD is in RFC 2616.  We do it that way\nbecause it&#39;s known to wo=\r\nrk in practice -- REST is a philosophical\nexplanation of why it works; why =\r\nwould REST lead us to any other\nconclusion, except where REST itself identi=\r\nfies mismatches in HTTP?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Two variants have the same abstract definit=\r\nion, if they share a URI.\n&gt; &gt; This does not restrict those variants from ea=\r\nch having an infinite\n&gt; &gt; number of other possible abstractions. =A0Applyin=\r\ng the identification\n&gt; &gt; of resources constraint, consists of assigning ide=\r\nntifiers to any\n&gt; &gt; other abstractions important to the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Presum=\r\nably the answer to &quot;What constitutes an important abstraction&quot;\n&gt; is arbitra=\r\nry? Particularly from a REST pov\n&gt; \n\nAbsolutely not.  If there&#39;s any ambigu=\r\nity as to the importance of a\nresource, then it can&#39;t be an important resou=\r\nrce.  When using conneg\n(except for compression), the REST style is to send=\r\n the optimal response\nfirst, along with a list of alternates.  This means o=\r\nne of two things:\neither REST requires you to assign URIs to variants; or, =\r\nREST is self-\ncontradicting.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; When you are varying media types (or an=\r\nything besides compression),\n&gt; &gt; the abstractions of each variant of /conce=\r\npt as a specific media\n&gt; &gt; type (i.e. /concept.atom and /concept.html as &#39;c=\r\noncept as Atom and\n&gt; &gt; only Atom&#39; and &#39;concept as HTML and only HTML&#39;) are =\r\nimportant to\n&gt; &gt; the system, and are different from &#39;concept as varying med=\r\nia type&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This holds true whether you assign URIs to identify these=\r\n additional\n&gt; &gt; resources, or not. =A0Your counter to this, is to keep insi=\r\nsting that\n&gt; &gt; once you&#39;ve declared a negotiated resource, its variants are=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt; allowed to be representations of any other resource, regardless of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; how many times it&#39;s pointed out to you that REST explicitly\n&gt; &gt; endors=\r\nes this very behavior (author&#39;s preferred version).\n&gt; \n&gt; No, the only thing=\r\n I&#39;ve insisted is that identifying representations\n&gt; as resources is a *cos=\r\nt* to visibility - i.e. it should be treated as\n&gt; such and either afforded =\r\nor overcome where /necessary/.\n&gt; \n\nInsisted, yes; shown, no.  OTOH, I&#39;ve ex=\r\nplained that to omit Content-\nLocation is to preclude associating multiple =\r\nselection-header values\nwith a single variant.  Since adding the Content-Lo=\r\ncation header makes\nthis possible, and this ability to map multiple selecti=\r\non-header values\nto a single variant is an example of what increased visibi=\r\nlity *means*,\nit is not logical to keep insisting that Content-Location dec=\r\nreases\nvisibility.  Continuing to insist the opposite only proves that you =\r\ndo\nnot understand the meaning of &quot;visibility&quot; in REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The only thin=\r\ng you can accomplish by dragging this debate out, is\n&gt; &gt; exposing flaws in =\r\none explanation or another that I&#39;ve posited,\n&gt; &gt; which does not change the=\r\n best practice of assigning URIs to\n&gt; &gt; variants like RFC 2616 says you SHO=\r\nULD.\n&gt; \n&gt; In which case let&#39;s continue since your explanation appears flawe=\r\nd,\n&gt; and this isn&#39;t HTTP-discuss.\n&gt; \n\nI didn&#39;t say there&#39;s any flaw in my e=\r\nxplanations, I&#39;m merely allowing\nfor that possibility.  Your failure to und=\r\nerstand REST, as I&#39;ve\nmentioned before, is not a reflection of my ability t=\r\no teach REST -- I\nexpect my results will resemble a bell curve.  I cannot h=\r\nold myself to\nblame that your response to explanations of how and why the W=\r\neb works\nthe way it works, is to insist the Web is broken -- sticking to th=\r\nat\nposition implies that you&#39;ll reject outright any notion that assigning\nU=\r\nRIs to variants obeys a REST constraint, no matter who says it or how\nit&#39;s =\r\nworded. \n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; IOW, I&#39;m not arguing that assigning URIs to variants *shoul=\r\nd* be\n&gt; &gt; best practice. =A0I&#39;m explaining *why* it *is* best practice.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =A0Rejecting my explanations will not change established best\n&gt; &gt; practice=\r\n. =A0Nor will failing to explain how this best practice\n&gt; &gt; violates REST -=\r\n- insisting that a variant can only have one URI,\n&gt; &gt; that of the negotiate=\r\nd resource, goes against REST completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully I haven&#39;t said &#39;be=\r\nst practice&#39; violates REST. One of my main\n&gt; issues in this discussion is t=\r\nhat it&#39;s basically subjective and\n&gt; dependent on the system in question; i.=\r\ne. it&#39;s nothing to do with\n&gt; REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve also said that not assigning U=\r\nRIs to representations doesn&#39;t\n&gt; violate any REST constraints. Primarily be=\r\ncause it doesn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n\nBut it does, and I&#39;ve not resorted to any subjective =\r\nexplanations for\nit.  Objectively speaking, you can&#39;t send a list of altern=\r\nates to a\nuser agent if you only have one URI, unless we bork @type, which\n=\r\nviolates REST.  Assigning URIs to variants makes this possible, without\nvio=\r\nlating any constraints and certainly without reducing visibility.\n\nIt may b=\r\ne objectively shown that anarchic scalability of conneg only\nresults from s=\r\nending the URIs of variants in Content-Location.  REST\nitself is all about =\r\ndescribing how and why some HTTP systems achieve\nthis anarchic scalability =\r\nof negotiated resources, in terms of applied\ndistributed software architect=\r\nure.\n\nThis is why, when Content-Location is omitted, a system will display\n=\r\nexactly the problems REST anticipates (like reduced visibility), and\nexactl=\r\ny the benefits REST anticipates when URIs are assigned to\nvariants using Co=\r\nntent-Location.  The one proves the other -- REST is a\npragmatic, objective=\r\n tool for analyzing the scalability of distributed\nsoftware systems.\n\nREST =\r\nmismatches result in real-world problems, which may be analyzed\nand solved =\r\nin terms of REST.  In this case, real problems result from\nomitting Content=\r\n-Location, these problems are explained in the thesis,\nso we can follow the=\r\n logic that conneg messaging isn&#39;t really self-\ndescriptive unless variants=\r\n are identfied as resources.  The URIs to\nsend in Content-Location are also=\r\n required to inform user agents of\nalternates, proving the importance of id=\r\nentifying those resources.\n\nOK, it&#39;s not as neat as Geometry, but simply st=\r\nated, when I see the very\nconsequences REST predicts in an HTTP conneg syst=\r\nem which omits Content-\nLocation and fails to list alternates, and I see th=\r\ne very benefits REST\npredicts when these conditions are met, I see it as a =\r\n&quot;proof&quot; of REST&#39;s\nidentification of resources &quot;theorem&quot;.  There is no subje=\r\nctive wiggle-\nroom here, only objective fact.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The difference=\r\n between an Atom and HTML representation is *not*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abstract at all Eric=\r\n, that is why you are able to transform via\n&gt; &gt;&gt; XSLT from Atom to HTML.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t make heads or tails out of that statement. =A0How do you=\r\n get\n&gt; &gt; from my statement that variants have multiple abstractions, to a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; claim that the differences between variants are abstract? =A0If\n&gt; &gt; anyt=\r\nhing, I&#39;ve pointed out that the differences between &quot;concept as\n&gt; &gt; HTML an=\r\nd only HTML&quot; and &quot;concept as Atom and only Atom&quot; are\n&gt; &gt; anything but abstr=\r\nact.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I read &quot;If a resource varies between HTML and Atom\n&gt; repr=\r\nesentations, then those two variants, taken separately, must have\n&gt; some ab=\r\nstract definition that is different from one another&quot; I\n&gt; concluded that th=\r\ne definitions are abstract, the definitions are\n&gt; different, therefore the =\r\ndifference is abstract.\n&gt; \n\nTrying to create semantic arguments won&#39;t chang=\r\ne the fact that\nassigning URIs to variants *makes* those variants unique re=\r\nsources in\ntheir own right.  You&#39;re claiming that because those variants sh=\r\nare a\nURI, they cannot have any other abstraction, therefore it&#39;s wrong to\n=\r\nassign them URIs.  I am pointing out the obvious -- they&#39;re resources\nin th=\r\neir own right because once you assign *.atom and *.html URIs to\nthem, you&#39;v=\r\ne given them different, equally-valid, abstractions.\n\nURIs are opaque.  A v=\r\nariant with one URI, and a variant with another\nURI, must have different co=\r\nnceptual meaning -- this is what &quot;resource&quot;\nmeans, by definition.  That eac=\r\nh variant also shares some other\nconceptual meaning, does not restrict thos=\r\ne variants to that meaning,\nnor does it change the fact that, taken separat=\r\nely, they&#39;re different\nresources because they have different URIs.  This is=\r\n still a whole\norder of magnitude simpler to grasp than some people insist =\r\non making\nit.  REST&#39;s definition of &quot;resource&quot; is entirely based on the nee=\r\nd to\nexplain this reality.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Atom and HTML variants may represent the=\r\n same concept when taken\n&gt; &gt; together, but when taken separately they also =\r\nrepresent other\n&gt; &gt; concepts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking them separately is a subjective j=\r\nudgement. All I&#39;m saying is\n&gt; doing that reduces visibility in your system =\r\nand is therefore a cost\n&gt; that is worth being aware of.\n&gt; \n\nNo, that URIs a=\r\nre opaque is an objective fact.  It is an objective fact\nthat URIs must be =\r\nassigned to variants in order to generate a list of\nalternates.  It is an o=\r\nbjective fact that negotiated resources will\nonly scale when variants may b=\r\ne distinguished from one another by their\nURIs.  The identification of reso=\r\nurces constraint is a philosophical\ntheorem derived from these facts.  That=\r\n the pragmatic application of\nthis constraint exactly matches the case the =\r\nconstraint was derived\nfrom, is by design.  This would not occur if this we=\r\nre a subjective\nmatter.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A failure to recognize that these variants a=\r\nlso represent other\n&gt; &gt; resources, by identifying those resources, is a fai=\r\nlure to apply the\n&gt; &gt; identification of resources constraint. =A0Period.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Period? Well that settles it then.\n&gt; \n\nAccepting that assigning URIs to =\r\nvariants meets the identification of\nresources constraint, as has been said=\r\n hundreds of times by dozens of\npeople over the years, is surely easier tha=\r\nn proving said best practice\nsomehow violates REST or is not important to R=\r\nEST, or is vague and\nsubjective enough to be open to interpretation.  It re=\r\nally is a fact,\nkinda like 2+2=3D4.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
