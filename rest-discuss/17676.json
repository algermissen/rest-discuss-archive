The only concern is or backwards compa=\r\ntibility.  Say I have a resource representation that is not following the c=\r\nonvention because I didn&#39;t really understand the convention or didn&#39;t follo=\r\nw it the way it will be interpreted.  For example, take the media type disc=\r\nussed in the previous post  that you mention, text/form+html.  Hypothetical=\r\nly, if I am producing that as a media type but really what I am sending is =\r\na snippet that is not a valid HTML document, is there any reason to fear th=\r\nat anything would stop working if proxies started interpreting that media t=\r\nype to expect valid HTML? &lt;&lt;\n\nThis situation would be the same as not adher=\r\ning to any other media type, i think. In fact your snippet would not even b=\r\ne a valid representation of the &quot;derived&quot; media type. \n\nI think, the only c=\r\nontraint would be, that e.g. a VALID &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; representation =\r\nis still a valid &quot;application/xml&quot; representation. As far as i know, this i=\r\ns anyway state of the art. it is just not standardized (except for XML Medi=\r\na types [1]).\n\nThe backward compatibilty is also given for intermediaries: =\r\nif they do know the derivation concept, the visibility increases. if they d=\r\no not know the correlation, they would handle such a media type as an unkno=\r\nwn media type. like an intermediary today, who knows xml but not atom, woul=\r\nd ignore atom documents.\n\n[1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n\n--- In r=\r\nest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jakob Strauch&quot; &lt;jakob.strauch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Due to previous posts [1] i was asking myself, if it would make sense to s=\r\ntandarize the usage of the + sign in media type indications.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think t=\r\nhe benfit would be, that a more specific media type like  &quot;application/odat=\r\na+atom+xml&quot; (which is currently not existing) could be at least interpret a=\r\ns &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; (which is currently the media type of an odata res=\r\nource [2]).\n&gt; \n&gt; An intermediary could look at the media type &quot;application/=\r\nodata+atom+xml&quot; and could interpret it as a known atom representation, even=\r\n if he don=B4t know the odata media type.
