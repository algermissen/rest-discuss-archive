The things that can&#39;t be done with RSS 1.0 could be added\nto RSS with a Google RSS module.\n\nThe advantage of not inventing a new language is that there are lots of\ntools out there for processing RSS and it&#39;s perhaps the widest used XML\nvariety after XHTML and as result developers who are familiar with RSS\nmight &#39;get it&#39; (advantages of REST) quicker?  \n\nUsing RSS as a format for returning search engine results has been\nsuggested before and was mentioned in an article on xml.com almost two\nyears ago [2].\n\nChris\n\n\n[1] http://pulr.org/rss/1.0/\n\n[2] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/07/05/deviant/rss.html\n\n-- \nChris Croome                               &lt;chris@...&gt;\nweb design                             http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ \nweb content management                               http://mkdoc.com/   \neverything else                               http://chris.croome.net/  \n\n"}}
