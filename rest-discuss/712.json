It\nshould be a time value that represents the time that the Subscriber\nApplication would like the subscription to persist.&quot;\n\nand this:\n\n&quot;Expiration: The response to the Subscription MUST include a header\ncalled &quot;Subscription-Expiration&quot;. This indicates the time that the\nsubscription expires. The subscriber application MAY renew the\nsubscription before this time. If it does not, the publisher MAY stop\nsending notifications after that time. The publisher MAY also remove the\nSubscription URI.&quot;\n\nand this:\n\nRenewal: The subscriber MAY renew a Subscription by making another\nSubscription Request. \n\nI will leave this in:\n\n&quot;Each notification response MUST include a &quot;Continue-Subscription&quot;\nheader. The value associated with this header MUST be the string &quot;true&quot;.\nIf the header is not present, the publisher MUST remove the\nsubscription.&quot;\n\nAnd subscriptions will be either one-shot or infinite, depending on how\nyou look at it.\n\n==========\n\nShould there be a way for the publisher to tell the subscriber when it\n(for whatever reason) will cease giving notifications? Sort of like the\nold unix sysadmin announcement: &quot;Going offline NOW!&quot;\n\nOne way to handle this is to have the client register another URI, the\n&quot;subscription-cancellation URI&quot;. Another is to have a special HTTP\nmethod. Another is to just not worry about it. Applications can handle\nthat out of band. I think I like that last option...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
