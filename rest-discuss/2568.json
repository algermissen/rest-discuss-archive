Between OO-RPC - which is basically the Web\n&gt; services style - and REST, there&#39;s definitely a *lot* of overlap.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example if under REST &quot;hypertext\n&gt; &gt; is the engine of application state&quot;, a tuple-space application&#39;s state\n&gt; &gt; might well be determined by URIs being put up into the tuple space, with\n&gt; &gt; documents being taken down from the tuple space and returned to the larger\n&gt; &gt; system.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great example, but I&#39;m all for thinking about\n&gt; new constraints which could be added to REST to induce new useful\n&gt; properties, such as Rohit&#39;s work on ALIN.\n\nOne might wish to gain the benefits distributed processing (eg, through\ntuple space), and even of the http protocol, without necessarity using\nhttp VERBs -- particularly where the process is &quot;atomic.&quot; See Jeff Bone&#39;s\n&quot;Dining Philosophers&quot; discussion at\n\n    http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/002923.html\n\n&lt;quote&gt;\nThe lesson is pretty clear:  it&#39;s always a bad idea to manage\ntransactions (i.e., attempt to guarantee atomicity of a sequence of\nactions, *even if this is made possible by the underlying communication\nmodel*) non-locally.  Whenever possible --- and it&#39;s always possible ---\natomic sequences of interactions should be managed by intermediate objects\nlocal to the resources being locked and manipulated;  it&#39;s trivial to\nencapsulate transactions into a single atomic exchange, and exposing those\nencapsulations as first class entities is generally a pretty good idea.  \nAnd it certainly fits with the REST model of the world.  MUCH more so, in\nfact, than RPC\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nSo the set of tasks that REST *should* do is a subset of the tasks that\nREST *can* do.\n\nSo my example may or may not be &quot;great&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure whether you mean\nits lack of greatness lies in being a poor illustration of REST\nprinciples, or whether you think it&#39;s just one more bad idea. Can you\nelucidate?
