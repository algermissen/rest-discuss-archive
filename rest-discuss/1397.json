That is, they make it so\n &gt; &gt;  &gt; that there isn&#39;t enough information in the HTTP message to understand\n &gt; &gt;  &gt; what it does, because it depends on the information represented by\n &gt; &gt;  &gt; the cookie which is invisible to everybody but the server.\n &gt; &gt; \n &gt; &gt; Just a nit. The second part of that sentence is true, but the first\n &gt; &gt; part is not the issue. Any individual HTTP message need not contain\n &gt; &gt; the state, let alone let you understand what it does.  The state\n &gt; &gt; should be contained in representations that are accessible via GET (or\n &gt; &gt; maybe POST).\n &gt; \n &gt; No, the first part is the issue (though I could have chosen a better\n &gt; word than &quot;does&quot;).  You appear to be confusing &quot;stateful interaction&quot;\n &gt; with &quot;stateful service&quot;.\n\nI read it differently because the subject was cookies. Cookies are for\nsession state, i.e. stateful service.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; Just take a message, and ask yourself this question; &quot;Will this message\n &gt; mean the same thing in 20 years?&quot;.  If so, then that is stateless.  If\n &gt; you use cookies with HTTP, then the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because the cookie\n &gt; would have expired in that time, and that would change the meaning of\n &gt; the message.\n\nYes, I agree fully with this.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; Note that the &quot;meaning of the message&quot; is not the same as &quot;the result\n &gt; of the message being processed&quot;.  Obviously a message sent now, versus\n &gt; the same one sent 20 years from now, will do something different.\n\nand this...\n\n-- \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAllan Doyle                         http://www.intl-interfaces.com\nadoyle@...\n\n\n"}}
