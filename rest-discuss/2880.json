But what is solicited becomes grey\n&gt; upon analysis...\n\nI&#39;d start with &#39;unsolicited message&#39; until we figure out what kind of\nmessage it is - request, response to a request, or event (where &#39;event&#39; is a\nnew type of message) or &#39;other&#39;.\n\nI did a project where I defined the message types and sequence as:\n- 1 request\n- 0-n notifications events indicating interim status of request\n- 1 response indicating final status of request (closing the request)\n\nEvents were purely advisory and optional. In HTTP the 202 Accepted response\nstatus is like an inital notification, but with no defined means to deliver\nthe final response.\n\n\n\n"}}
