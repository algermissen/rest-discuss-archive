As for the\n&gt; multi-site issue, I realize that this approach is not perfect.  I can\n&gt; think of some ways around it, but things start to get ugly.  I suggest\n&gt; that my approach reaches more of an 80/20 point.  It allows the most\n&gt; common needs of transactions to occur with little overhead.\n\nSo does the approach I suggested.  Personally, I find URI-munging a\nfatal flaw, even if it gets around a few current implementation issues.\n\n&gt;&gt; And if you superset the URI space, then questions\n&gt;&gt; come up about whether the new space has been checked-out, locked,\n&gt;&gt; and/or has the same access control and handlers.  Yikes.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would think these answers would be specific to the application, not \n&gt; to\n&gt; transactions in general.\n\nYes, but the only reason they are specific to the application is because\nthe transaction system is messing with *their* state, namely the set\nof resource identifiers that the clients and servers are supposed\nto be making actions upon.  That doesn&#39;t work through intermediaries\nbecause the intermediary isn&#39;t prepared for the transaction software\nto be changing the meaning of each user&#39;s requests.  Likewise, all\nof the replay-protecting security protocols have to be aware of\nthe munging as well, or nothing will work.  In short, it breaks the\northogonality of methods and identifiers.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
