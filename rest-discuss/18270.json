I didn&#39;t say that =\r\neither. I&#39;m saying there are design and\n&gt; implementation aspects of system =\r\ninterfaces that are not covered by\n&gt; HTTP. At some level developers (human =\r\nbeings) need to communicate and\n&gt; reason about the software they write. Eve=\r\nry web service provides\n&gt; information about something. Apart from the pract=\r\nical integration of a\n&gt; client with a server we need to be able to discuss =\r\nthe &quot;something&quot;\n&gt; rationale behind a given service.\n\nNo. You discuss the ra=\r\ntionale behind service &#39;kinds&#39; and that is part of setting up the media typ=\r\ne. The kind &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess) defined in the media type=\r\n spec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service X of organization Y. All y=\r\nou need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; and then you say Accept: appl=\r\nication/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off you go. There is no need to t=\r\nalk about *that* service any further. The description of the service *is* i=\r\nn the media type. There are *no* (thatis: none whatsoever) service specific=\r\n descriptions in RESTful systems.\n\n\n&gt; Otherwise I as a developer won&#39;t\n&gt; kn=\r\now if the information of a given service is of interest to me. This\n&gt; reaso=\r\nning between developers (human beings) is at a conceptual level.\n&gt; Furtherm=\r\nore software is not only meant for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant\n&gt; for humans =\r\nto read and understand and reason about.\n\nRight - but this is intent (&quot;I wa=\r\nnt to buy a book, therefore I direct my browser to http://amazon.de and not=\r\n http://weather.info). No architectural style will help to ensure the Amazo=\r\nn is still selling books tomorrow. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe the term &quot;conceptual type&quot; =\r\nwas unfortunate. My point in the\n&gt; discussion was that it may be of interes=\r\nt to talk about the concepts\n&gt; and information a service is meant to provid=\r\ne in order to then be able\n&gt; to reason about what media types to use or inv=\r\nent for a given service.\n\nWell, &#39;entities&#39; such as feeds, feed-entries, ima=\r\nges, products, orders, contact-info (vcard), events (icalendar) etc. surely=\r\n are part of designing media types.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me say it again: the proble=\r\nm that is being tried to solve does not exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this your way of say=\r\ning there is nothing to discuss?\n\nYes :-) The whole strict point of &#39;specif=\r\nic media types are a bad idea&#39; is simply confusing people trying to underst=\r\nand REST. Maybe the discussion is useful after all, though.\n\n&gt; Or are you\n&gt;=\r\n saying there is no problem in deciding whether to define new media\n&gt; types=\r\n or not? My understanding of the discussion was that we were\n&gt; discussing h=\r\neuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media\n&gt; types.\n\nThe thing is=\r\n, that it is actually pretty clear that generic media types + embedded spec=\r\nific stuff + a new means for negotiating that stuff is silly because the me=\r\nchanism for negotiation such stuff is the media type identifier in the firs=\r\nt place. It is the mechanism built into HTTP for that purpose.\n(Not to ques=\r\ntion the usefulness of standard general link relations orthogonal to media =\r\ntypes, of course) \n\nSpecific media types is what one should do and there is=\r\n no problem with them. Yet, some people make it sound as if there is a prob=\r\nlem - and this I find is adding confusion for others that try to learn REST=\r\n.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /Paul\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Paul Cohen\n&gt; www.seibostudios.se\n&gt; mobile: +46=\r\n 730 787 035\n&gt; e-mail: paul.cohen@...\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
