The solution there seems to be\n&gt; conpression (e.g. compressed bodies and SigComp, etc.) and there&#39;s a\n&gt; lot of momentum there -- it doesn&#39;t seem to be holding things up. Is\n&gt; this really a barrier to REST?\n\nIt&#39;s not so much a barrier to REST as inclining people towards\nleveraging relevant aspects of RPC technology, RPC having a history of\ncompact wire formats usually in conjunction with IDLs. As per some other\nmails I&#39;ve sent, I think it&#39;s possible to obtain reasonable tradeoffs\nhere and is worth investigating.\n\nI agree with your observation on the IMS/SIP standards family btw,\nexcept I&#39;m not sure industry momentum always translates into usefulness.\nThey&#39;ve been around a long time now.\n\n&gt; On the discovery doc -- are non-HTML, REST approaches really wasting\n&gt; that much on traversal? e.g. There&#39;s not a lot of traversal in AtomPub\n&gt; compared to an HTML-based web site. It seems that the wastefulness\n&gt; here it more about UX than something fundamental to HATEOAS. I would\n&gt; imagine that for m2m REST you could optimize the traversal to the\n&gt; minimum interactions required for the workflow no? Can an up-front\n&gt; discovery doc really make it better? Even if you had say a URI\n&gt; template up front, you&#39;d likely need to &quot;traverse&quot; a few resources to\n&gt; get the parameter values needed to make a request. If not, then I&#39;d\n&gt; imagine the first page of the service would normally offer the\n&gt; link/form anyways. What am I missing?\n\nSuppose you wanted to sh0ow a user&#39;s status as the common case for an\napplication Ux. The url for that status is obtained from a link in the\nuser&#39;s profile. It&#39;s not in the profile because it changes more\nfrequently that the other data and so would make the profile document\nnon-cacheable etc. By design you traverse from the profile to the\nstatus. This decouples client and server assumptions at the cost of a\nHTTP req/res cycle. So there&#39;s a tradeoff. Some developers would like to\ngo direct to the status to avoid the hop. One way to do this is have the\nURLs prepared in advance. The argument is that a way to balance these\nconcerns is to allow the server to publish a document that client can\ncache and from which the client can pull the status url directly and so\nshort circuit the traversal without being very strongly coupled to the\nserver&#39;s uri space. This kind of tradeoff seems reasonable to me, hence\nI don&#39;t understand the level of objection in some quarters to approaches\nlike WADL.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n"}}
