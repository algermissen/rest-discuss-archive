As for the \nmulti-site issue, I realize that this approach is not perfect.  I can \nthink of some ways around it, but things start to get ugly.  I suggest \nthat my approach reaches more of an 80/20 point.  It allows the most \ncommon needs of transactions to occur with little overhead.\n\n&gt; And if you superset the URI space, then questions\n&gt; come up about whether the new space has been checked-out, locked,\n&gt; and/or has the same access control and handlers.  Yikes.\n\nI would think these answers would be specific to the application, not to \ntransactions in general.\n\n&gt; This topic has come up a few times on webdav and http-wg lists.\n&gt; The transaction is a resource, but the relationship between it and\n&gt; the requested resource can be accomplished via a header field that\n&gt; defines each request as a sequenced resource within a hierarchical\n&gt; transaction.  In other words, ask the server for a transaction begin,\n&gt; send the URI it gives the client in each request as a header field\n&gt; with a request number appended to it, and finally abort or commit\n&gt; the transaction as a final request to the transaction&#39;s URI.  That&#39;s\n&gt; basically how I did it for the still-vapor waka protocol.\n\nAdmittedly, I am arguing vaporware also.   :)\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
