Personally I don&#39;t\n&gt; like it since I feel there&#39;s a more elegant (read RESTful) way to\n&gt; develop it rather than adding verbs to HTTP 1.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do others think?\n\nMake a proposal.\n\nI&#39;ve seen some ideas about giving properties their own URLs, but those were\njust some ideas. One would need a more complete proposal to decide whether\nthis would work well.\n\nBesides, why would be adding new verbs unRESTful?\n\n\n\n"}}
