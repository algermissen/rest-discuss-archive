I think I&#39;ve read their docs 3 times by now, and it&#39;s still \nnot\n&gt; sinking in for me.  Not sure why.\n\nI haven&#39;t made my mind up either.  When I said &quot;technology neutral \ndesign&quot;, I meant as an ideal.  The technology-neutral refrain in \nebXML comes from UN/CEFACT, the United Nations trade facilitation \ncommittee.  The UN/CEFACT business process people do not think XML is \nthe end of the road.  Some prefer RDF. They are also mandated to use \nUML, which embeds some other technology assumptions, although I think \nthey may go more deeply into RDF in the near future.  \n\nDAML-S appears to assume procedure-step style workflow engines.  \nRosettaNet crashed and burned trying to use those in B2B ecommerce \nbefore giving up and going to a state-alignment conversational model. \nEtc.\n\n&gt; &gt;  Much of ebXML is P2P.  The \n&gt; &gt; business process stuff is all P2P at this point.  I think they \nwould \n&gt; &gt; be open to REST.  Or at least I am, and so are some others in my \ngang.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good.  Invite them over!\n\nI will, as soon as I have figured out enough to make a good &quot;sales \npitch&quot;.\n&gt;  Sorry Bob, I got the impression\n&gt; from the previous discussion that I was being asked to run out and\n&gt; evangelize REST on the ebXML mailing lists.\n\nNot by me.  I agree it would be a total waste of time and just annoy \nthe inhabitants.  I intend to bring people from my gang in ebXML over \nto here and the REST wiki, when I think I can make a good case (or \nsomebody else has made a good case first, which would be even better \nfrom my point of view).\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think [&quot;accept&quot;] is an issue at all.  &quot;Accept&quot; is for \ncontent\n&gt; negotiation, not for any kind of offer/acceptance mechanism.  You \nuse\n&gt; it to say &quot;give me HTML&quot;, or &quot;give me JPEG&quot;.  I don&#39;t see them as\n&gt; related at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Neither do I see the Accepted (202) response code being related to\n&gt; offer/acceptance.  It&#39;s a data transfer feature (&quot;response will not \nbe\n&gt; returned on this connection&quot;), not anything that has any &quot;business\n&gt; level&quot; semantics.\n\nI agree, but I think the overloaded word confused some of the \ndiscussions. \n \n&gt; I think if you asked Paul/Mike/Jeff/myself to model \noffer/acceptance,\n&gt; that we would pretty much build the same model.\n\nLet&#39;s do it! It is one of the key business-level protocols. My \nconclusion from previous discussions would be two HTTP exchanges:\n1. offer-ack\n2. businessResponse-ack\nwhere businessResponse could be &quot;accept&quot;, &quot;reject&quot; or some variation \non &quot;let&#39;s negotiate, I will make a counter-offer next&quot;.\n\nA good RESTful offer-acceptance model would be the start of a \ncompelling argument to the ebXML business process gang.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
