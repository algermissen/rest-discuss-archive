A collection resource can be created which contains only\n&gt; =\r\nmembers 2, 5 and 9 and treats DELETE as a stored procedure to delete all\n&gt; =\r\nmembers along with the collection resource itself.  No problem.  But,\n&gt; hyp=\r\nothetically, why?  I still see no compelling reason to optimize\n&gt; DELETE at=\r\n the expense of the visibility which allows proper cache\n&gt; behavior.\n\nAnd\n\n=\r\n\n&gt; If a client is requesting multiple deletions, then the client needs to\n&gt;=\r\n issue multiple DELETE requests.\n\nThe core of the issue is that some resour=\r\nces only make sense to be deleted *together*, because that&#39;s what makes sen=\r\nse to the application.\n\nIf I want to delete 3 orders because one credit car=\r\nd has been rejected, I can either delete them sequentially (and potentially=\r\n end up in an inconsistent internal state), or group them together as anoth=\r\ner resource (let&#39;s say ordersForCreditCardXxx) and delete that resource as =\r\na unit.\n\nThe idea that somehow those scenarios are not needed, or that retr=\r\ny and pray semantics of deleting multiple resources is usable in every situ=\r\nation is completely alien to me. Those are real-world scenarios where you a=\r\nre trying to do multiple things as a unit, not to save network calls or ban=\r\ndwidth, but because they belong logically to the same operation.\n\nHaving su=\r\nch a composite resource you can delete on is perfectly reasonable. Yes the =\r\ncaches won&#39;t see it, but that&#39;s a trade-off you have to decide for yourself=\r\n: is the cache consistency more important than the resulting state of my re=\r\nsource(s).\n\nTo add insult to injury, intermediaries are not required to act=\r\nually stale a representation upon receiving a DELETE. And the very nature o=\r\nf proxies as they&#39;re used today means that while your proxy may well delete=\r\n the representation, mine won&#39;t, putting us exactly where we were.\n\nAt the =\r\nend of the day, if you value your squid cache beyond the inherent atomicity=\r\n of certain operations, you&#39;re quite free to do so. It&#39;s a tradeoff. But, I=\r\nMHO, neither approaches are unrestful, by nature or by definition.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
