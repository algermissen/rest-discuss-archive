Do you agree?\n\n&gt; User selects on &quot;add to cart&quot; link\n&gt; Buy submits /cart?action=add&id=XXXX\n&gt; Server response includes id=XXXX (it can be XML or checkout URI with\n&gt; parameters - /cart?action=checkout?id=XXXX)\n&gt; User selects another item\n&gt; Request goes to server as /cart?action=add&id=XXXX&id=YYYY\n&gt; Server responds with /cart?action=checkout?id=XXXX&id=YYYY\n&gt; User selects &quot;checkout&quot; - client side code submists the &quot;checkout&quot;\n&gt; request as instructed by server.\n\nIn the interaction above, you are passing back and forth the item list\n(cart&#39;s state). You were saying that the interaction technique above\navoids the need for the server to change the state of one of the\nresources it controls. It could and that is up to you.\n\nIt is good to have some sort of a reservation system. You want to be\nable to overbook an item to a certain degree (since not all users\nputting the item into the cart will check it out) and inform user that\nan item is out-of-stock once the threshold is crossed. For fairness,\nyou&#39;d also probably want to implement a first-come-first-serve policy\nto item reservation. It is definitely bad for business for a customer\nwho takes a first swipe at a very popular and limited item then goes\non shopping some more to discover that putting items into the cart\ndoes not actually reserve it.\n\nSuch reservation system changes some server-side states.\n\nSo, yes, you can be correct in maintaining that the above interaction\ndoes not change server-side state, but if I were you, I don&#39;t want to\nbe correct on that unless there is really no need to.\n\nI hope this helps,\nYS.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
