You forgot to \nmention that Marc Hadley is also the author of WADL which is the best \nRESTful description language available. He may have been involved in \nother standardization efforts, but that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t get REST \nnow: I know he does.\n\nI was also invited to the initial expert group, as a founder of the \nRestlet framework (http://www.restlet.org). I would like to mention that \nthis JSR aims to provide a standard set of annotations to facilitate the \nmapping between business objects and REST resources. The implementation \ncould be supported by either Restlets, Servlets or JAX-WS (via the HTTP \nbindings). I expect the result of this JSR to be complimentary to the \nRestlet API, which hopefully looks RESTful enough to you.\n\nLet&#39;s not waste this opportunity to properly standardize REST on Java. \nSee my recent posts for more details on my opinion:\nhttp://blog.noelios.com/2007/02/14/new-jsr-to-define-a-high-level-rest-api-for-java/\nhttp://blog.noelios.com/2007/02/08/will-we-reconcile-rest-ws-and-soa/\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n\n\n\n"}}
