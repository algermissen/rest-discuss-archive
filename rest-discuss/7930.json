It has some very\n&gt; interesting characteristics that make it a good fit for various\n&gt; integration scenarios, amongst other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Philosophically, it can almost be perceived as a simpler, easier, REST-\n&gt; oriented alternative to SOAP.   We may finally have something to counter the\n&gt; dirtiness that is SOAP, since Atom can be a very good enveloping mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of the current hype about Atom is about blogs.  Which might not be a bad\n&gt;\n&gt; thing, since it will keep other uses under the radar and in stealth mode\n&gt; (from the evil Corporate IT types who don&#39;t know any better ;-) ), till we\n&gt; have some &quot;but it just works&quot; deployments to show off.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious if anyone else is using/has used/ is considering ATOM and/or APP\n&gt; for other purposes, especially in the integration space?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrzej Jan Taramina\n&gt; Chaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\n&gt; http://www.chaeron.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
