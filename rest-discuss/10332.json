However, I see that all the answers\n&gt; focu=\r\nses on HTTP, and since REST is a protocol-agnostic style I\n&gt; wonder how to =\r\napply your answers to other environments.\n\nI think a more appropriate descr=\r\niption is that &quot;REST&quot; is a style that\ncan be applied to more than just HTTP=\r\n. Each application of REST to\nsome other protocol will hopefully describe t=\r\nhe proper use of that\nprotocol, but will not necessarily be programmed the =\r\nsame way across\nvarious protocols.\n\n&gt; We are going to use, for sure, at lea=\r\nst HTTP, JMS, POP and FTP. And\n&gt; for all those I have to have Monitoring an=\r\nd Traceability. So I don&#39;t\n&gt; see how can I have this without a centralized =\r\npiece of software,\n&gt; either a ESB or at least some kind of Queue (ActiveMQ =\r\nmaybe).\n\nIf you look at ESBs they usually take independently available Java=\r\n\nlibraries for each of these and wrap them up in practically\nunmanageable X=\r\nML config files. Maybe that has an appeal to some folks,\nbut I&#39;ve never app=\r\nreciated it.\n\nI don&#39;t see this as a REST topic per se.\n\n\n\n"}}
