Now, in my average web development I would just escape these\nwith HTML entities.\n\nHowever, my programmatic clients now have to jump through some sort of\nunescaping hoop to get that data back into it&#39;s original format.\n\nTo me this seems like a frustrating excercise for the client.  I would\nexpect after Xpath-ing out a piece of data I should be more or less\nready to go.\n\nI&#39;ve looked into using CDATA blocks instead, but in FF/IE the content\nis then not displayed at all.\n\nAny advice?  Is this escape/unescape game just a part of the cost?\n\nThanks,\n-Miles\n\n"}}
