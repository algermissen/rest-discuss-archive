The URIs which identify [I]&#39;s member \nresources should be (but are not required to be) [I1] and [I2].  When \ndereferenced, these resources identify their equivalent disjoint sets [A1] \nand [A2] with 303 redirects.\n\nThe use case for [I1] and [I2] is only when [I] is required to return a \ndirectory listing when dereferenced.  Otherwise, we can just use:\n\n[I] http://example.com/fruit/orange_apples\n\nWhen dereferenced, the response is an HTML representation of a page \ndescribing orange apples, with links to [A1] and [A2].  If, when [I1] and \n[I2] are dereferenced, the responses are representations of apples instead of \nrepresentations indicating the equivalent disjoint sets [A1] and [A2], [I1] \nand [I2] would be &quot;URI aliases&quot;.\n\nIf the attached Venn diagram&#39;s background were entirely shaded, like it would \nbe if we were referring to the set [U] instead of the set [I], its meaning \nwould be the &quot;Union of Subset and its Complement&quot;.  When dereferenced [U] \ncould, using content negotiation, legitimately return any member URI (not \njust members of A and B) because we have specifically defined the \nIntersection as a member of the Universal set, and because we haven&#39;t ruled \nout any fruits which aren&#39;t apples or oranges.\n\n[1] http://canuck.bisonsystesms.net/dev/rest/venn.png\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
