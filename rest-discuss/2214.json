Plus I don&#39;t really see how PHP\n&gt; can not support digest authentication. Digest authentication just\n&gt; involves parsing the &#39;Authorization&#39; header and generating the &#39;WWW-\n&gt; Authenticate&#39; header.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d suggest you look at:\n&gt; http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/stories/2002/07/09/webServicesSecur\n&gt; ityHttpDigestAuthenticationWithoutActiveDirectory.html\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a &#39;native&#39; implementation of digest authentication. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter on the browser or container.\n&gt;\n&gt; - inthedarkplace\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@y..., &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Okay, a few threads back, I asked what was the preferred way to\n&gt; handle\n&gt; &gt; sessions.  The most popular response was &quot;http authentication&quot;.\n&gt; Since I am\n&gt; &gt; working on this project in PHP, I asked php.net&#39;s newsgroups where\n&gt; I might\n&gt; &gt; find code for digest authentication (basic authentication is easy\n&gt; enough).\n&gt; &gt; What I got back was that PHP currently does not support digest\n&gt; &gt; authentication (though I would have thought I could code around that\n&gt; &gt; problem).  And to make things worse, it seems not a lot of browsers\n&gt; support\n&gt; &gt; digest authentication in a compatible manner.  For instance, I came\n&gt; across\n&gt; &gt; one article that says:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Opera and Amaya both support Apache&#39;s version of digest\n&gt; authentication\n&gt; &gt;     IE5+ both support IIS&#39;s version of digest authentication\n&gt; &gt;     Opera and Amays do not work with IIS and IE does not work with\n&gt; Apache\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, this may have changed with IE6, but I have not been able to\n&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; anything to substanciate that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, this leaves me with using basic authentication.  However, I am\n&gt; not crazy\n&gt; &gt; about using it for two reasons:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Repeatedly sending login information over the wire in\n&gt; plaintext.  Now, I\n&gt; &gt; realize that I could use SSL, but that would be both expensive and\n&gt; slow the\n&gt; &gt; site down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) I don&#39;t see a way to &quot;expire&quot; the login information.  But maybe\n&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt; a method that I am just not aware of...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, this brings me to session cookies.  Some time back, I recall\n&gt; reading the\n&gt; &gt; statement that &quot;cookies are not RESTful&quot;.  Now, is this all use of\n&gt; cookies\n&gt; &gt; or just persistant cookies?  Is it okay to use a single session\n&gt; cookie?  I\n&gt; &gt; would see this as no different from using http authentication (i.e.\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; client resending identifying [set of] values over and over again),\n&gt; except\n&gt; &gt; that I can occasionally change the cookie&#39;s value to limit replay\n&gt; attacks\n&gt; &gt; and limit the possibility of stealing the password to only one\n&gt; request\n&gt; &gt; instead of every request (assuming basic authentication).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is one other thing I do like about http authentication:  it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &quot;interfere&quot; with the application process.  In other words, the\n&gt; browser just\n&gt; &gt; resubmits the last request with additional headers.  To implement\n&gt; html login\n&gt; &gt; forms and cookies, I have to take on the responsibility of keeping\n&gt; track of\n&gt; &gt; the submitted data in the last request.  It also means that the\n&gt; browser\n&gt; &gt; caches the login page in it&#39;s history (which does not happen with\n&gt; http\n&gt; &gt; authentication).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, how do you deal with the security issues of http authentication\n&gt; vs. html\n&gt; &gt; form/cookie authentication when you are running over a unsecure\n&gt; conneciton?\n&gt; &gt; And how do you do this and keep it all RESTful?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@s...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
