Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Mark McEahern&quot; &lt;marklists@m...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are there efforts to standardize these things?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is something called AS2 which is a &#39;standard&#39; mechanism for \nexchanging\n&gt; busines documents with MIME over HTTP. AS1 is MIME over SMTP. I \nhaven&#39;t\n&gt; spent much time examining AS2 - perhaps BobH can fill us in - but \nit looks\n&gt; like a protocol on top of HTTP. \n\nI&#39;m most familiar with the efforts in ebXML and UN/CEFACT to \nstandardize business protocols.  AS2 was a predecessor.\nFor example, the Drummond group, conductor of the test in the UCC \npress release, was heavily involved in ebXML.  And UCC has said that \nthey are migrating to ebXML, too.\n\nI&#39;ve followed (with increasing personal involvement) several \ngenerations of standardization efforts for business protocols. \nAs far as I know, those efforts began in the Telecommunication \nManagement Forum, then moved to RosettaNet, then to UN/CEFACT and \nebXML, and then to UN/CEFACT eBTWG.\n\nHere is a document that describes UN/CEFACT transaction and \ninteraction patterns:\nhttp://www.gefeg.com/tmwg/files/Chapter%208%20MetamodelR10.pdf\n\nUN/CEFACT intends for their patterns to be technology-independent.\nI think those transaction patterns can be refactored into REST.\n\nFor example, one aspect they discuss with some transaction patterns \nis &quot;residual effects&quot;, as in the formation of business contracts and \ncommitments.  I think REST resources are the embodiment of those \nresidual effects.\n\nUN/CEFACT eBTWG is also developing a standard set of economic \nelements for business exchanges that could be the basis for a \nstandard set of REST resources.  It&#39;s not soup yet, but I&#39;ll post \nsomething here and on REST-Wiki when it is.\n\n&gt; It probably can be easily re-factored into a\n&gt; more REST-like approach, but until I get paid to do that sort of \nthing, I\n&gt; don&#39;t have the time right now to attempt that...\n\nSame for me.  I just finished helping a company develop a demo of Web \ncontract negotiation that was fairly RESTful, so we&#39;ll see if they \ncan sell it to their prospects. It will be proprietary, though - \nunfortunately.\n\nIn the meantime, I pick away at the problem in these \ndiscussions...but would also be interested in a group development \nproject using simple free tools.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
