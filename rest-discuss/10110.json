I said some of them have,\nwhich is what you say; the rest didn’t care. They (or at least, a\nsignificant portion of them) would have moved, had there been any\ntangible payoff – had XHTML offered features that they didn’t\nalready have. But it doesn’t; only programmers with XML tools at\ntheir disposal had a reason to move, whereas everyone else had\nlots of reason not to.\n\n&gt; And I&#39;ll argue that having the browser support it strictly (and\n&gt; strictness is what I&#39;m arguing against) would have resulting in\n&gt; too many people seeing the web as broken which an important\n&gt; contingent (that mainly includes Microsoft) simply won&#39;t let\n&gt; that happen.\n\nI think MSFT of all entities would be more than happy to let the\nweb appear broken. If you think the web is broken, Redmond has a\nSilverlight engine to sell you…\n\n&gt; So you can hypothesize, but your hypothecies don&#39;t match that\n&gt; which could be the only realisitic reality.\n\nYou cannot do anything but hypothesize either, and between your\nhypothesis and mine, I think mine is less hypothetical… but all\nwe’re doing is hypothesizing.\n\n&gt; &gt; (Of course, just because you&#39;re using XML doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; automatically mean you&#39;ll end up with a well thought-out\n&gt; &gt; vocabulary. Most ad-hoc vocabs are mediocre or worse. That&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; hardly XML&#39;s fault.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that the &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people do&quot; argument?\n\nWell just because you use JSON doesn’t mean you’ll end up with a\nwell-designed data structure either. Too little or too much\nnesting, extensibility provisions and the like are all concerns\nyou’ll have to deal with. XML relieves you of some of them to\nsome extent, in expense of creating other complications. All of\nthe data formats are just tools, and how well they’re used\ninescapably depends on the one who wields them.\n\n&gt; Quoting Dare Obasanjo:\n&gt; ======\n&gt; You XML folks completely miss the point. JSON is important\n&gt; because it is better supported in the browser than XML. That&#39;s\n&gt; why it has taken hold. Arguing that angle brackets,\n&gt; S-expressions and JSON syntax are all semantically equivalent\n&gt; is the height of architecture astronautics[0] and COMPLETELY\n&gt; misses the point. \n\nDare conveniently overlooks that it’s the JSON proponents\nthemselves who tout syntactic brevity as a major win for JSON.\n\n&gt; Quoting Masklinn:\n&gt; ======\n&gt; Wow. David, have you at no point considered refactoring your\n&gt; Lisp and JSON markups? They&#39;re horrible, you&#39;re piling crap on\n&gt; crap it&#39;s idiotic.\n\nYeah, mixed content is inconvenient and alien if you’re a\nprogrammer and all the world’s a data structure… in which case\nit’s not surprising that you think trying to map out a mixed\ncontent model in data structures is crap piled on crap and looks\nidiotic.\n\nOf course if the data is rigidly structured, it *is* idiotic…\n\n&gt; Quoting rektide:\n&gt; ======\n&gt; the DOM data structure used by XML is immensely frustrating to\n&gt; deal with. multiple text node children hanging off elements,\n&gt; content validation before you can .InnerText, theres just a\n&gt; never ending rigamaroll to do what is ultimately a very very\n&gt; simple task, and i for one do not enjoy writing such verbose\n&gt; kludgtastic code. the data structures built by xml tooling just\n&gt; suck horrendous ass.\n\nSo use XPath. DOM blows chunks and a bunch of other things.\n\n&gt; But I think his point is that all the formats have benefits and\n&gt; XML may have some benefits as complexities grow which I won&#39;t\n&gt; debate.\n\nAs I said, if you have a rigid data structure, XML isn’t a good\nfit. If you have regular tabular data, even JSON is a lesser\nchoice than CSV. (And lord almighty did people get obsessed with\nreplacing perfectly good CSV interfaces with XML.)\n\nI’m certainly not one to champion XML über alles. (Look back in\nthe list’s archives a while ago – the Megginson post I linked to\nwas a reaction to a blog spat that Eliotte Rusty Harold more or\nless started by carrying an argument over to his weblog that\nstarted on this list where it was mainly between me and him. In\nwhich I was in the role of JSON defender…)\n\n&gt; OTOH, I like to minimize complexity in web services as much as\n&gt; possible.\n\nThings should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
