I understand that using a scalable clusterable\nJ2EE fra=\r\nmework may &quot;solve&quot; this but I am looking for simpler alternatives.\n\nThere a=\r\nre 1 or more servers offering services (ok, I should say\n&quot;resource&quot; from no=\r\nw on, but they are in fact batch services that\nproduce a resource). Resourc=\r\ne types may be identical between each\nserver, or different. Resources may h=\r\nave limited access, that is, they\nmay accept only a few request at a time. =\r\nWhen a server is busy on a\nresource (it may return HTTP code 503), clients =\r\ncan try with another\nserver that offers the same resource. When a resource =\r\ntype is not\navailable, it returns a 404. Example:\n\n Server1:\n  * ResourceTy=\r\npeA\n  * ResourceTypeB\n\n Server2:\n  * ResourceTypeA\n  * ResourceTypeC\n\nIf re=\r\nsourceTypeA is busy on server1, clients can try on server2.\n\nWe need client=\r\ns not to be aware of all different servers out there. So\nwe need some kind =\r\nof server registry, and a router that will queue all\nrequests from clients =\r\nto those servers. Thus, JMS queues seems like a\ngood fit:\n\n    server-1 ser=\r\nver-2 \n       |        | \n  JMS-Server-with-queues\n     |       |        | =\r\n \n   client1 client2 client3\n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to achie=\r\nve this with a RESTFul\narchitecture, without a JMS server? I know we could =\r\nwrite client code\nthat obtains the server list, and iterates through each b=\r\nut this can\ngrow into a little beast if we must parametize it with delays b=\r\netween\nattempts, number of retries and so on.\n\nClaude\n\n\n\n\n"}}
