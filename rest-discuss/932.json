This was back in 94/95,\nbefore I got the Web.\n\nMy view of it, which I got before reading very much of Tim&#39;s stuff,\nwas that you have strings that are used in different contexts for\ndifferent purposes.  To a higher layer, an identifier looks like\na location.  To a lower layer, it looks like a name.  That is,\ndepending upon how you look at it, an identifier is both a name\nand a locator.\n\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2001/03/James/ is a string that identifies\nmy son (who turned 1 today!).  I use it as a name when I ask a cache if\nit has a valid representation for me.  I use it as a locator when my\nHTTP client stack follows the rules in RFC 2396 to turn it into\nsomething that opens a socket to port 80 on 207.236.3.141.\n\nRohit had a great presentation at TWIST &#39;99[1], and a spinoff\narticle[2] in his IEEE column about this.\n\n [1] http://www.isr.uci.edu/events/twist/twist99/presentations/khare/\n [2] http://www.isr.uci.edu/~rohit/IEEE-L7-namespaces.html\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
