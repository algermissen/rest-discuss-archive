The point should be clear:  you\n&gt; can&#39;t list an infinite set.)\n\nNo, you can&#39;t list them. You can *represent them*. On the web we do that\nwith query-generated indexes. You want to do it with client-side\ngenerative grammars. I&#39;m waiting for a *concrete* benefit.\n\n&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t have to enumerate them because you are only ever interested in\n&gt; &gt; a subset.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the server cannot a priori know what subset I&#39;m interested in.  \n\nThat&#39;s why you supply *query parameters*.\n\n&gt; ... Therein lies the problem.  Consider a resource\n&gt; representing the digits of pi.  I&#39;d like to be able to address \n&gt; specifically the digits of pi.  The ordinal position of a\n&gt; digit of pi bears a subordinate, hierarchical relationship to \n&gt; the sequence of digits that make up pi.  I&#39;d like to be\n&gt; able to say\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.constants.com/pi/2036\n&gt; \n&gt; rather than\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.constants.com/pi?digit=2036\n\nThat&#39;s absolutely fine. The latter can be either a redirect to the\nformer or an index page that returns a link to the former or both.\n\n&gt; Why?  Because the meaning of the first is clearer by virtue of the use of the hierarchical path syntax, while the\n&gt; meaning of the second is not as clear.  This is a bit of a weak example, because the first is not a *lot* clearer than\n&gt; the second, but you get my drift.  \n\nDo you have any examples that are not a bit weak???\n\n&gt; ... At least, in the first example, the index *is* the namespace rather than being an\n&gt; adjunct to it.  Pi and pi&#39;s 2036th digit are both equally first-class entities, though the latter is &quot;subordinate&quot; to\n&gt; the former.\n\nThat&#39;s fine. Use the query as an index over or redirect to the\nhierarchical version. Anyhow, you&#39;re begging the question. You start\nwith the premise that it is important to represent hierarchies in the\nURI. Actually, this is just a convenience that makes mapping between\nfile systems and URIs easier. It is not core to the web architecture at\nall.\n\n&gt; &gt; I feel like I&#39;m arguing with you about libertarianism.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a scientific and engineering discussion, not a political discussion.  At least it should be --- that&#39;s what I&#39;m\n&gt; trying to keep it at.\n\nMy point is that your arguments in each situation are not\nproblem-driven, they are theory-driven. If you had approached this whole\nsituation like: &quot;I was working on this problem and I found it very hard\nto solve with existing techniques.&quot; I can solve your problem of finding\ngraphics that have no links on the Web using CGI. Yes, it requires\ncoordination with the server creator. BUT SO DOES YOUR SOLUTION.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; No, it doesn&#39;t lose information. Queries generate *indexes* over\n&gt; &gt; hierarchical information space. The existence of the Google index does\n&gt; &gt; not destroy the hierarchy of MSDN, one of the things it may index.\n&gt; \n&gt; It loses information *in the URI.*  This is clear.  Think about it.\n\nGoogle loses information in MSDN&#39;s URIs? That&#39;s ridiculous! The object&#39;s\ncanonical URI does not change because someone, somewhere has indexed it.\n\n&gt; &gt; The relevant subsets of the information can be enumerated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again the problem is that the server cannot know a priori which subset is interesting, so it cannot be enumerated in\n&gt; hypertext, only indirectly represented via a partial name.  This name *can* be represented as a query string, at the\n&gt; expense of losing information about the relationships between the query parameters and between those parameters and the\n&gt; overall information space being modeled.\n\nThe query-based URI does not necessarily reference the resource. It can\nbe the canonical name for the object, or an alternate name for the\nresource, or a redirect to the resource or provide a reference to the\nresource.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; builds on existing web infrastructure better.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.somefiles.com/images?subset=/1999/*/02\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a good and noble goal, and should be pursued wherever possible.  Sometimes, though, these indices cannot be\n&gt; reified;  rather, the relevant information must be computed.\n\nWhat do you think images.cgi does? It&#39;s a computation!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
