What return code would the server use and does it make\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sense to send the order rejection document as the body of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (error-)response?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am trying to rule out the abve approach by deriving from REST&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; constraints.\n&gt;&gt; Here is my thinking:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I assume (because I am not able yet to derive that from the REST\n&gt;&gt; constraints)\n&gt;&gt; that there is an implicit constraint in REST that demands all\n&gt;&gt; application data\n&gt;&gt; to be stored on the server.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To put this in other words: a client must be able to perform any of\n&gt;&gt; the next\n&gt;&gt; possible transitions in an application soley based on the responses\n&gt;&gt; previously\n&gt;&gt; received. The client-server collaboration must not be designed in a\n&gt;&gt; way that\n&gt;&gt; requires a client to keep track of its own requests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I don&#39;t think it is necessarily the case that the response to  \n&gt; every request *replaces* the application state on the client.\n\nNo, certainly not. I hope I did not create the impression I mean that.  \nThe client builds up application state as it proceeds through the  \napplications state machine.\n\n\n&gt; That is, a response can be use to *add to* or otherwise modify the  \n&gt; client state. This is certainly the case for ancillary resources  \n&gt; like images in a web page. But I think it is also valid to do this  \n&gt; after already reaching a steady state. For example, this is what is  \n&gt; often happening in an Ajax application. An HTTP request can retrieve  \n&gt; new data that changes the client state but the overall client state  \n&gt; is defined by a combination of data retrieved from multiple  \n&gt; requests. This does present the problem of not having a single URI  \n&gt; to represent the current state of the application but many Ajax apps  \n&gt; are using URI fragments to deal with this. As far as I can tell,  \n&gt; this is &quot;ok&quot;.\n\nI am not so sure - as far as bookmarking and the history goes, AJAX is  \na mess and developers have to use tricks to make bookmarking and  \nhistory work. Reminds me of HTML frames...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Applied to my question above I think that a RESTful solution demands\n&gt;&gt; that the\n&gt;&gt; server creates application data as the basis for subsequent\n&gt;&gt; interactions and\n&gt;&gt; then instructs the client how to procede through the application.  \n&gt;&gt; (This\n&gt;&gt; implies a solution where the order is created on the server and  \n&gt;&gt; marked\n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &#39;pending&#39; to provide the application data. The client would then  \n&gt;&gt; alter\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; order (the application data) to &#39;fix&#39; the (item-out-of- \n&gt;&gt; stock-)problem.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I don&#39;t think it is unRESTful for a server to respond to a POST  \n&gt; with a 200 OK rather than a 201 Created or a 303 See Other. This  \n&gt; does create a &quot;transient&quot; state that the client can&#39;t return to (via  \n&gt; a bookmark) or communicate by sharing the URI.\n\nInteresting thought. It is the same though for 201 nd 303 responses, or?\n\n&gt; It is common practice to avoid doing this,\n\nHmm - is it? If the POST is simply a submission without any state  \nbeing changed or created on the server - that&#39;s fine.\n\n&gt; but if the state truly is transient then maybe it&#39;s the right thing?  \n&gt; Anyways, I don&#39;t believe that REST requires that there are no  \n&gt; transient states, which I think is what you are getting at.\n\nHmm, could be. Do you have a reference on the notion of &#39;transient  \nstate&#39;?\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; I can&#39;t say that I have any references to back this up though -- I&#39;m  \n&gt; more going on the fact that I&#39;ve never seen authoritative sources  \n&gt; say otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
