In REST a resource represents a service or a \n&gt; data element, and every significant resource should have a URI.  \n\n&quot;Service&quot; seems to me a lot more like SOAP than REST.\nI think of resource as a significant business entity\nor an aggregation of business entities.\nUsually larger granularity than a data element.\n\n&gt; In \n&gt; the given system there were two services: &quot;availabiltiy amount&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;is quantity available&quot;, and one data element: the BlueShoe \n&gt; product.  It seems that each of these should have their own URI so:\n&gt; \n&gt; Availability amount service: \n&gt; http://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity\n&gt; \n&gt; Is quantity availabilty service: \n&gt; http://www.myinventory.com/services/isavailable\n\nLet&#39;s contrast that with Mike Dierken&#39;s original suggestion:\nhttp://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/\n\n&quot;Availability&quot; is actually an aggregate business entity.\nIt is the aggregate of on hand inventory plus the stream\nof expected receipts, minus the stream of expected demands.\nIt might also be called MRP (Material Requirements Plan).\n\n&quot;Availability&quot; even has a standard representation:\na time-phased table of planned inventory inputs and outputs with a \nrunning balance.\n\nA query into this table can show the available balance at some future \ndate.\n\nAs an old MRP jock, I like Mike&#39;s suggestion better.\n\nAs to which is more RESTful, I leave that to further discussion.\nI&#39;m a rookie here myself.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
