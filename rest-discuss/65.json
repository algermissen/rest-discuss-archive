Of\n&gt; course, it&#39;s convenient to have that CGI shared by multiple transient endpoints\n&gt; so that every watch app doesn&#39;t require yet another install and datastore....\n&gt; The datastore in the shared CGI is partitioned by endpoint...  The endpoint\n&gt; signs in and picks up its messages...  Yup, POP3.\n\nSure, but showing that HTTP semantics trump those of POP3.\n\n&gt; Are there substantial benefits from reconstructing all of SMTP and POP with\n&gt; HTTP, or can they be considered orthogonal and complementary?\n\nSee Paul&#39;s response.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, these semantics are covered by mail infrastructure already\n&gt; &gt; but not by web\n&gt; &gt; &gt; infrastructure.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You sure about that?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes.  They can be emulated with HTTP, but haven&#39;t yet been.\n\nI don&#39;t recall which ones we were talking about, but HTTP has a lot of\ngoodies that you might have missed if you weren&#39;t looking for them.\n\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
