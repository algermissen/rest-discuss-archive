This causes a POST.  The response to the POST includes \ninformation confirming the action.  Later, the user uses the Back \nbutton, and the browser says &quot;This information was generated in response \nto a POST.  Do you want to resubmit it?&quot;  Or worse, it just resubmits \nthe request without asking.  This is going to be a problem with any \nnon-idempotent request.  It is especially a problem on a public access \nstation, when a new person walks up and can resubmit a request that \nsomeone else made, perhaps even altering it.\n\nOne solution proposed for this is the POST-REDIRECT-GET \n&lt;http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=RedirectAfterPost&gt; \npattern.  The response to the POST is instead a redirect to a temporary \nURL containing the response page.  The browser then GETs this response \npage and displays it.  Due to the redirect, the original POST request is \nreplaced by this GET request in the browser history.  Thus, the user can \nuse the back button with impunity, and will just see the result of their \nrequest, with no danger of resubmitting it.\n\nThat sounds great, but it seems to clash with REST.  What was before a \ntransitory response to a POST request now becomes a separate resource \navailable via GET.  Will it be cached?  How long must it stay available?\n\nMy question is, what is the REST way to address the problem?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
