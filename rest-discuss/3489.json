Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Multiple possible problems:\n&gt; 1. Loss of XML comments\n&gt;    Are they part of the infoset?\n&gt; 2. Loss of whitespace information\n&gt; 3. Loss of document-checksum abilities\n&gt; If I PUT a PGP-signed XML document, absent some\n&gt; convention about signing XML-infosets, I think we\n&gt; need to get back an identical document in order\n&gt; to verify my signature.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a general matter, would you want to PUT a\n&gt; MSWord6 document and GET a MSWord7 document?\n\nNot if I couldn&#39;t read it with MSWord6.  Any of the items listed above all\nfall under &quot;can I use the GET version exactly like I use the PUT version?&quot;\nIf you don&#39;t care about comments, then it doesn&#39;t matter whether they are\nstripped or not.  It all depends on your application.  Restricting PUT in\nways that are more of a hinderance than a help to some applications doesn&#39;t\nseem right.  Of course, a given application can always be more restricitve\nif desired, but those same restrictions should not be forced on all\napplications (imho).\n\nFrankly, I have found little practical use for PUT.  It may be because it&#39;s\ntoo limiting.  It may be because it&#39;s too difficult to use in some cases\n(such as updating container resources).  In the end, about the only thing\nthat it seems safe to use it for is creation of a new resource when you have\ncontrol over the URI space.  And even then, issues such as the one being\ndiscussed come up.\n\nPUT just can&#39;t win, no matter how hard it tries...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
