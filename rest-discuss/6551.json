Which means I can&#39;t use the word &quot;semantics&quot;,\n&gt; basically. ;) I \n&gt; thought it best to use analogy instead of software-architecture\n&gt; examples, for \n&gt; starters my primary concern is explaining &quot;Resource&quot; in terms of basic\n&gt; set \n&gt; theory by sticking with apples and oranges.\n\nResources are easy to explain. Resources are like objects. They\ndemarcate application state in the same way as objects. The web is full\nof resources like a java program is full of objects. The main difference\nis in how you interact with them.\n\nFirst of all, resources have only one type. We don&#39;t need baseclasses or\ninterface classes. We only have resources. Resources can be found using\na single identifier scheme. Think pointers. Once you have a pointer to\nthe resource, you can call invoke methods on it. These methods might be\nissued directly to the resource, or might go through a proxy of some\nkind.\n\nResources only have a limited set of methods, and each of these methods\nare based around transfering a document per invocation rather than a\nparameter list. If you were to ascribe member variables (or state, or\njust plain information) to your object, they would form the schema\nbehind the documents you transfer. This schema can be transferred in\nseveral forms (representations). You could return a HTML document which\nlisted out information held in your object. You could return an image,\nor some othe form of your state... but each representation conveys the\nsame information. Updates should take on one of these forms and update\nthe object atomically, rather than setting the value of one variable\nafter the other over several invocations.\n\nAll representations returned by a resource should be standard, ideally\nunderstood by every relevant piece of software in the world.\n\nSo, you have a uniform resource locator scheme (a pointer). You have\nuniform methods that accept and/or return a document and tell you which\nencoding is used in the document. Each document is of a standard type.\nBecause everything looks the same, sometimes you need extra resources to\nrepresent different facets of what might conceptually have been one\nobject in a less constrained environment.\n\nThat&#39;s REST without the oranges.\n\nConcrete example?\n\nClient -&gt; Server\nGET http://example.com/lightbulb HTTP/1.1\n\nServer -&gt; Client\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\non\n\nClient -&gt; Server\nPUT http://example.com/lightbulb HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\noff\n\nServer -&gt; Client\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nSee also\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
