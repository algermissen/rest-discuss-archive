We did not\nattempt to make it more formal because the goal was to have the \nspecification describe the interface as it was intended, not define \nit in such a way that only static resources could be implemented.&quot; [1]\n\n&quot;The requirement is that &quot;the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have \nthe significance of taking an action other than retrieval.&quot;  It does \nnot require that no side-effects occur, nor even that the side-effects \nnot be visible within the representation of the resource provided in \nthe response.&quot; [2] \n\nThis debate has come up numerous times, but I couldn&#39;t find a \nRESTWiki [3] entry that directly addresses this issue.  Is there one? \n\n[1] http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-July/001946.html\n[2] http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-July/001974.html\n[3] http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage\n\n\n"}}
