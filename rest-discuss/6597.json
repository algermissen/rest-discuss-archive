A generic browser with sufficient knowledge of standard verbs\n&gt; and content types should be able to access and interact with your\n&gt; RESTful service. Special-purpose clients can still be written, but they\n&gt; should never be required.\n&gt; \n\nWould that that were true. Fact is, most (all?) existing web browsers \nimplement only about half of what&#39;s necessary for a full REST \nimplementation: GET and POST but not PUT and DELETE. HTML forms and \nXForms 1.0 don&#39;t even allow PUT and DELETE as actions. :-(\n\nOf course, this all presupposes that you&#39;re sitting on top of HTTP. \nThere are RESTful systems that use other, non-HTTP protocols though \nthey&#39;re uncommon in practice. REST is an architecture. It is not limited \nto HTTP, though I&#39;ve personally never found a need to use any other \nprotocol for a REST system.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
