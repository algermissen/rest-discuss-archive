Such as AtomPub provides media types for implementing publishing services.\n\n\n&gt; in contrast to working\n&gt; with *all* kinds of shops on the basis of some generic machine-readble\n&gt; standard business vocabulary, then HATEOAS will not work.\n\n&gt; Why? Because\n&gt; HATEOAS implies that one (even a machine) can browse to *any* URI provided\n&gt; in the response of the previous call. So that is not guaranteed now, as it\n&gt; will be impossible to redirect the client to a foreign site, if I (the\n&gt; server vendor providing the URI) cannot guarantee that every client knows\n&gt; about the particular use of http methods by that referenced site. So to make\n&gt; the complete system of &quot;machine web&quot; work, I would have to provide\n&gt; information on virtually every external service to virtually each client.\n&gt; How should I know of either? This is impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would solve the problem\n\nThere is actually no problem - you just need an &quot;evolving set of standard types&quot; (to paraphrase Roy). \n\n\n&gt; [..]\n&gt; \n&gt; I you just rely on defining human readable specifications, you just move the\n&gt; human to an early stage, but you don&#39;t get rid of him.\n\nIt is impossible to get rid of the human otherwise we would be talking AI.\n\n&gt; But actually, the\n&gt; difference between WWW and REST (shortly spoken) is that the first is about\n&gt; humans, while the latter -in the sense we discuss it here- is about\n&gt; machines. So to make it work completely (not just in part) and globally, we\n&gt; need to get rid of human and find ways to make machines understand machines\n&gt; without the need to manually define each single interconnection type, but\n&gt; step forward to global standards. AtomPub is not a solution, as it only is\n&gt; defined for publishing, while we need something on a higher level,\n&gt; describing *any* kind of business interaction.\n\nAt some point you need to bind your implementation to domain semantics, no matter how many general layers you use. For example, the only difference between\n\n&lt;person&gt;\n  &lt;father href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/person&gt;\n\nand\n\n&lt;person&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=&quot;father&quot; href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/person&gt;\n\nis the layer at which the &#39;father&#39; semantic is defined (XML semantics vs. generic link relation semantics. You cannot make software figure out what &#39;father&#39; means - you MUST hardcode that at some point.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Markus\n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
