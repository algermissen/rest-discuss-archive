We are not using the full set\n&gt; of SyncML spec=\r\nifications, and we have not a SyncML server or any SyncML\n&gt; infrastructure,=\r\n we are only using SyncML as a &quot;normalization&quot; tool\n&gt; between two disparate=\r\n systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, it seems to me that the SyncML protocol is the opposite =\r\nof Rest, as\n&gt; it is based on commands as opposed to resources. How can I ma=\r\nke this two\n&gt; scenarios compatible? Has anyone had experience with this kin=\r\nd of problem?\n\nEssentially what you are wanting to do is wrap up the SyncML=\r\n endpoint\ninside a REST gateway. This gateway will expose whatever URLs you=\r\n deem\nappropriate for the rest of the architecture to interact with in a wa=\r\ny\nthat doesn&#39;t turn everything to pot. It can be a useful approach if a\nnum=\r\nber of components need to interact with the endpoint and if\nsupporting the =\r\nSyncML directly within each component would be an\nimpost. Similar to how wr=\r\napping up an old mainframe or a java RMI\nsystem in a SOAP service makes it =\r\nmore accessible and easier to\nintegrate with, wrapping up an old endpoint-b=\r\nased protocol behind a\nREST gateway can make its capabilities more easily a=\r\nccessible to the\narchitecture.\n\nHowever, designing the interface to this ga=\r\nteway service can be\ndifficult as you try to reinterpret a specification th=\r\nrough a REST\nmodel. It can be as difficult and as subject to change as the\n=\r\ndevelopment of the standard itself. You may ultimately find that if\nonly a =\r\nfew components need to speak SyncML, it may just be better to\nsupport it di=\r\nrectly.\n\nRemember, REST is not an end unto itself. It&#39;s a way of getting th=\r\nings\ndone. Think first about what you need to get done, and the REST\naspect=\r\ns should fall out pretty naturally.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n"}}
