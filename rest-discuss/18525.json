I can&#39;t explain in detail regarding the company I work for as we&#39;re still in stealth/startup mode so I&#39;ll do the best I can to make sense.\n\nOur API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to &quot;scrape&quot; some web sites. Basically we pull down a sites login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed to us, and attempt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not trying to randomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will ask their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we&#39;ll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending back a response to the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far as I can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on our server side. It&#39;s basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating user credentials for different services. The consumer gets the benefit of being able to avoid having to do the page scraping and/or using other service APIs..they just use our one API and specify the service and pass the credentials. \n\n\nThe problem is.. we cant use GET since you can&#39;t pass a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but that seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in credentials (possibly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above, we&#39;re not storing these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we&#39;re merely checking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service selected (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag of whether or not the creds worked changes..but that&#39;s not really the resource.\n\nSo I am asking you experts.. how is something like this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve read the past few years, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially if the community was &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax with the ease of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the community balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am left to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST. \n\n\nFeel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely missing some key points about using REST. I think I have a pretty good understanding of it, but no doubt there is room to learn.\n\nThank you.\r\n---781490481-1615204408-1328644074=:85500\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi all,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am trying to do the best I can for our API needs to avoid making some REST calls basically be RPC calls.
