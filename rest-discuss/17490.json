IOW, the application flow *might* follow some pre=\r\n-supposed state machine, but it also *might not*. Server and client simply =\r\ncannot agree on this at design time - or it&#39;s not REST.\n&gt;\n\nWhich REST const=\r\nraint is broken by pre-agreeing on application flow at\ndesign time? Doesn&#39;t=\r\n that imply that AtomPub is not RESTful? I&#39;m not\nsure about that.\n\nParallel=\r\ns between applications for human-directed clients and\nmachine-directed clie=\r\nnts break down here. The reason that html apps\nwork with very little pre-su=\r\npposition is because humans are capable of\nlevels of awareness, adaptation =\r\nand intuition that are (currently) far\nbeyond anything a machine can manage=\r\n. I think it&#39;s too easy to\nunderestimate how much that human capability aff=\r\nords change in\napplication flow, and to over-estimate the capability of mac=\r\nhines.\n\nAgreeing on application flow at design time, if the clients are\nmac=\r\nhine-directed, is actually a Good Idea because the server will be\nunder no =\r\nillusion as to what changes it can enact, and it avoids the\ncosts associate=\r\nd with trying to define application flows in more\n&#39;dynamic&#39; terms.\n\n&gt; Howev=\r\ner, - and this is what Ian is IMHO trying to capture with his term &#39;DAP&#39; - =\r\nmedia types do not fall from the sky at random but are designed on the basi=\r\ns of some set of interactions the designers think about when they create th=\r\ne media type. Clearly, when you design a media type for procurement you wil=\r\nl have some basic interactions in mind.\n&gt;\n\nActually you can design media ty=\r\npes that are completely application\nagnostic, and when using them define yo=\r\nur DAPs purely in terms of\nentry points and link relations. Providing a mor=\r\ne generic interface\nfrom an app agnostic media type seems like it might enc=\r\nourage\nhealthier re-use in the system.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
