It&#39;s 3 ways to put \nthe action in the URI. The mistake is here.\n\nThere may be different solution to your problem. You say that in the \nREST architectural style &quot;everything is a resource&quot;, you&#39;re right so we \nmustn&#39;t, i think, make a 1-to-1 relationship between our object model \n(for example :)) and the REST data model. I think that the mapping may \nbe complex and don&#39;t have find yet interesting example of mapping \nbetween OO models and REST models. But maybe you have to find if there \nexists other resources on your source model which are not easy to \ntranslate to a REST resource.\n\nA second solution is to only use the Person resource. If we suppose we \nhave to deal with a person resource and only that and we want that this \nperson walk from 1 unit towards the north, we have to assume that the \nPerson resource knows its position. The client has to know the current \nposition of the Person. And to move the Person I think the client should \nPOST to the server the intended state of the resource (the new position)\n\nNote: I didn&#39;t answer to your question. I just refuse the axiom &quot; So \ngiven this constraint that you absolutely must have non-standard verbs&quot;.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n-- benoit\n\nKeyur Shah a ï¿½crit :\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand that it&#39;s always important to model everything as a\n&gt; resource in a REST system and perform CRUD operations on them (so that\n&gt; GET, POST, PUT and DELETE can fit the bill). But there might be cases\n&gt; where you have to model non-CRUD operations in your REST system - and\n&gt; not all reasons are technical. You customers are used to a certain\n&gt; vocabulary which contains well-known and well-accepted verbs and you\n&gt; simply can&#39;t change them to fit the &quot;resource&quot; paradigm.\n&gt;\n&gt; So given this constraint that you absolutely must have non-standard\n&gt; verbs, what&#39;s the best way to model them?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a blog entry on this and would appreciate your suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://abstractfinal.blogspot.com/2007/04/restful-urls-for-non-crud-operations.html \n&gt; &lt;http://abstractfinal.blogspot.com/2007/04/restful-urls-for-non-crud-operations.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Keyur\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
