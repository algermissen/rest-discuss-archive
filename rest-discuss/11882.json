Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that many\n&gt; peopl=\r\ne think REST =3D=3D (!SOAP). Look at any buzzword compliant\n&gt; technology. D=\r\no you know how many &quot;Agile Software Development&quot; shops\n&gt; there are out ther=\r\ne that think having a daily standup, &quot;iterations&quot;\n&gt; (even if they&#39;re 3 mont=\r\nhs), and &quot;no documentation&quot; means they&#39;re\n&gt; &quot;Agile&quot;?\n\nDefinitely. Semantic =\r\ndiffusion (how I love Fowler speak) does seem to \nbe rife and it does seem =\r\nlike REST in general is ripe for people to \ncome along and misunderstand it=\r\n. Next thing is those people will be on \nstage mis-representing it or will =\r\nbe blogging their half understandings.\n\nCorrecting people when you can seem=\r\ns reasonable, but I think that \nprobably means reaching out too. The people=\r\n mis-representing REST are \nunlikely to be reading your blogs in detail or =\r\nreading this forum, so \nif you do want to reach them I think you need to go=\r\n to wherever they \nare and offer your advice (which will probably be warmly=\r\n accepted). If \nthey choose to ignore that advice then you can joyfully sla=\r\nm them with \na clear conscience :)\n\n\n"}}
