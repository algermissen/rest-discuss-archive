My understanding was that GET \n&gt; is &quot;safe,&quot; but not necessarily idempotent. Returning a new ID each time \n&gt; you do a GET seems plenty safe to me. \n\nHi Bill,\n\nIt&#39;s not that. The safeness of GET can work against you, if the server \nis required to issue distinct ids.\n\nclient A\n\n  GET -------[cache] -------&gt; [oserver]\n\n  200 Ok\n  id:23098765678\n\nclient B\n\n  GET -------[cache] x\n\n  200 Ok\n  id:23098765678\n\n\nclient B was served from cache, so now client A and B are working with \nthe same ID. Not good. Hence, use POST for this kind of pattern, unless \nyou have some other means of distinguishing A and B requests.\n\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
