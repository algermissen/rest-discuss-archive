If (1) was a RESTful option, this\ncould well be extended to arbitrary property/value constellations for communicating\nwhat one refers to, e.g. http://store.org/about?http://myprops/ISBN=0093661778\nThis would IMHO break the whole idea of simply &#39;uttering a URI&#39;.\n\nThe questions I have about (2) are:\n\n- although I have never heard any objections from the REST POV against a resource\n  spanning multiple authorities, I am still not sure that REST explicitly allows\n  the situation described in (2). I am thinking of this as to &#39;distribute the\n  invocation of the representation-resource membership function&#39;....ok?\n\n- usually, several representations returned for multiple requests to a single\n  resource are understood to be mutually exclusive, but in the case described in\n  (2), the various representations are *combined* to form another one.\n  Is this RESTful?\n\n- I would also like to do this the other way round (distributing POST,PUT and\n  DELETE) and while technically possible, I am also not sure if this case\n  would break any REST constraint.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\nJan\n\n[1] which is (thanks Mark :o) formally defined as\n    http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/Indexable/\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
