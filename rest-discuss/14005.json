I have never seen any proof of these  \n&gt; &gt; limitati=\r\nons. It just seems that because the general REST community  \n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t figu=\r\nre out how to design good media types for machine to  \n&gt; &gt; machine interact=\r\nion, the consensus is that it isn&#39;t possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not say that at al=\r\nl. Of course machine to machine RESTful  \n&gt; systems are possible (e.g. Atom=\r\nPub). I was talking about inevitable  \n&gt; assumptions the client has to make=\r\n that manifest itself in code or  \n&gt; configuration of and how to document t=\r\nhese such that\n&gt; \n&gt; - no unnecessary coupling is created by the documentati=\r\non\n&gt;   (as is by many of the documentations of the so called REST\n&gt;   inter=\r\nfaces on the Web)\n&gt; - the style of documentation will be accepted by e.g.\n&gt;=\r\n    the legal department\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n\nRight, but it&#39;s the assumption that th=\r\nese out-of-band contracts are needed is what I&#39;m questioning. They don&#39;t se=\r\nem to be needed in the human web. Sure you may need to document the represe=\r\nntation formats -- the media type and the extensions and rels necessary to =\r\nuse the service. But its things like guarantees about what &quot;kinds of state =\r\ntransitions&quot; are available that I question. I&#39;m not sure that the &quot;inevitab=\r\nle assumptions&quot; you refer to are necessary. Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into=\r\n what you mean by that though, but it seems to be more that what normally c=\r\nonstitutes the uniform interface. Maybe I need more clarification on what y=\r\nou think would be in this contract.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
