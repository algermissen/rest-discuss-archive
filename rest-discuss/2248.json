While RFC2616 does explicitly mention such examples as &quot;the posted\nentity\nis subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a\ndirectory\ncontaining it,&quot; it also gives the example of using POST for &quot;Providing a block\nof data,\nsuch as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process.&quot; Not all\nPOSTs will\nresult in another resource being created, even implicitly.\n\nSo I think my example is a better way of doing things since you are POSTing\nthe state\nof a subordinate resource (or a reference to the resource in that particular\ncase.)\n\n&gt; (&#39;/squarer&#39;) while /squarer/complex (a squarer for complex numbers) might\n&gt; be, but note the totally different meaning of POSTing that.\n&gt; What I&#39;d like to happen now is instead of folks proposing other\n&gt; possibly RESTful ways to do integer squaring, have them tell me precicely\n&gt; what is unRESTful in my example so I can evolve it to that point\n&gt; of enlightenment.\n\nIn your original example, you are not posting a representation of a resource,\nonly\na name of an action.\n\n\n\n"}}
