I&#39;d like to see one for detailing &#39;best practices&#39; for &quot;202\nAccepted&quot; - but I just don&#39;t have the time right now...\n\nAll in all this is a really wonderful wrap up of where we are at today!\nWho is ready to start coding? If you are Java friendly, I&#39;d like to suggest\nstarting with http://www.sourceforge.com/projects/destiny - I know it talks\nabout JMS, but it&#39;s more important that it is an HTTP messaging server.\n\n---\n\nSome comments:\n\n1 &quot;The response to the Subscription MAY include a Location...&quot;\nDo you mean: &quot;The response to [creating] the subscription...&quot;\n\n2 &quot;Event: (CHANGED|EXTENDED|DELETED|ADDED|(or application defined)) &quot;\nI strongly think these should be based on create, read, update, delete\n[operations on atomic information] and add and remove [operations on\ncollections]. There should be a map to what HTTP methods typically would\ngenerate (as you&#39;ve indicated in the document). I&#39;ve spent a lot of time\nthinking about this one and would like to continue discussions on this\npoint.\nI also believe &#39;user defined&#39; is to be avoided in the same way that new\nmethods in http are to be avoided.\nIf it comes to a problem with flexibility describing the change to the\nresource - I highly recommend using &#39;sub-properties&#39; in the same sense as\npointed out by MarkB relating to the &quot;;&quot; in urls. This &#39;sub-property&#39; is\ncontrolled by the resource, but not necessarily independently addressable.\nIf it were addressable, then it would be subscribable, and those\nsubscriptions would receive the event.\nFor example, listening to a users online status might be:\nTarget-URI: http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/who/dierken.com/mike/\nProperty: presence\nOperation: update\n\n3 &quot;some form of &quot;difference&quot; may suffice &quot;\nContent negotiation is goodness. Personally, I&#39;d avoid &#39;delta&#39; events, due\nto problems with often needing guaranteed delivery and sequence. Sending\ntemperature as &quot;up:3&quot; isn&#39;t as good as &quot;98&quot;. But I understand that sometimes\ndeltas are okay.\n\n4 &quot;the Event Sink may email notifications &quot;\nYou will probably want user-agent metadata on the subscription (what\nuser-agent, what content-type, and what form of content-type (like different\napproaches to html mail)). Something for the future, but make sure there is\nroom later.\n\n5 &quot;may define a convention for using query parameters...&quot;\nYay! I realize this is a short-term hack for backward compatibility - but\nyou gotta do what you gotta do...\n\n6 &quot;HTTP-equiv could also be used &quot;\nNifty.\n\n7 &quot;browser would ask the user&quot;\nThis would probably (d)evolve into HTML in the same way that HTTP\nauthentication evolved into custom HTML forms for logging in. Don&#39;t\nunderestimate the power of the marketing side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
