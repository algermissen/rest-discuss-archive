What URL \n&gt;&gt; should you hit to get the form to edit the resource.  Say your resource is at:\n&gt;&gt; http://foo.com/entry/1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I GET that URL, I&#39;d get a view of the resource in (x)html that&#39;s not \n&gt;&gt; editable.  How do I get the form to edit it?  REST doesn&#39;t seem to understand \n&gt;&gt; the use of forms on the client side to do editing at all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How do I RESTfully get a form to create a new &quot;entry&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. You don&#39;t NEED to do that. There are other ways to change resources\n&gt;    apart from a FORM. You can have some AJAX PUT something for example.\n\nRight, but in the case where you&#39;re using a FORM to do it, how do I GET that \nform?  GETing the resource usually returns a &#39;view-only&#39; version of it.  There \nhas to be a way to tell the server I want a &#39;view-only&#39; version or an &#39;edit&#39; \nversion at the same URL.\n\n&gt; 2. If you need a FORM to edit a resource then you can have the server\n&gt;    supply a FORM as part of the representation of the resource.\n\nDo you mean here that I&#39;d get back say two div&#39;s, one for viewing the \nresource, and one for editing it and I&#39;d use CSS/Javascript to turn on the one \nI want? Or do you have in mind some way of telling the server which one you \nwant it to give you but not changing the URL?\n\nScott\n\n\n\n"}}
