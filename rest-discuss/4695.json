But the meaning of the request is to ensure that when\nthe operation finally completes that the resource is gone. There is no\npre-condition that the resource must already exist. This differs from a\nremote-object approach where there is an implied &#39;locate object, activate\nobject, invoke object.method()&#39; process.\n\nI know I&#39;ve seen discussion on this, but can&#39;t seem to find it now.\n\n"}}
