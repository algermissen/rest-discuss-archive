Let&#39;s say a resource Allows GET, HEAD, PUT and\nPOST, and sends this Accept response header:\n\nAccept: application/atom+xml;type=entry; q=1.0, \napplication/atom+xml; q=0.9, \napplication/some-delta-format; q=0.9, \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded; q=0.8\n\nI assumed it was &quot;good &#39;nuff&quot; to provide the client with a _hint_ about\nwhat was acceptable, with the authoritative answer coming in response\nto an actual submission attempt.  In my example Accept header above, a\nclient could reasonably infer that application/x-www-form-urlencoded has\nnothing to do with PUT or PATCH, that a delta has no relation to PUT or\nPOST, and that any form of Atom has nothing to do with PATCH, and \nthat Atom Entry documents may be acceptable to PUT or POST.\n\nI decided to use a /media/ subdirectory which could list acceptable\nmedia types for upload, to avoid overloading Accept as a response \nheader.  I think it&#39;s more than serviceable as a simple-syntax solution \nfor giving clients a hint, even if it isn&#39;t ideal for all contingencies.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
