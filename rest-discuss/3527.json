If \nDELETEing the container is something that doesnt make sense in your \napplication, then it may be OK.  What do you use to create the container?\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t see a problem doing it either way - as long as the \nsemantics of the DELETE operation for you application are made clear, \nare consistent, and aren&#39;t in conflict with what most people would \nconstrue delete to mean.\n\n--Chuck\n\nSeairth Jacobs wrote:\n\n&gt;Hmm...  that feels less intuitive to me.  But if &quot;DELETE /container&quot; is\n&gt;strictly not allowed to be used in this manner, then that&#39;s probably the\n&gt;best way to go.  But is it not allowed?\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Seairth Jacobs\n&gt;seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;How &#39;bout DELETE  /container/all to accomplish that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose you have resources with the following structure:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    /container\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    /container/1\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    /container/2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    /container/3\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, suppose I were to issue a &quot;DELETE /container&quot;.
