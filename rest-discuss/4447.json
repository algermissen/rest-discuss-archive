The submitted documents have their own identifiers (owned by the client) =\r\nand the submitters do not know the identifier for the final document.

The input document would be stored, but would not=\r\n have a URI. Seems like this approach is out.\n\nb) with POST to a generic re=\r\nsource and return the location of the stored input document.\n - this would =\r\nallow the use of GET, PUT and DELETE on the stored input document for manag=\r\nement, but the client would have to remember the server generated location =\r\nand maintain a mapping. Somewhat annoying.\n - in order to get to the final =\r\nmerged document, the response would need to provide a reference to it. This=\r\n means the representation has more information than what was submitted - an=\r\nother schema would be required (or a more flexible one).\n - I&#39;m not concern=\r\ned about the non-idempotent definition of POST, I can guarantee the server =\r\nworks in an idempotent manner (even if the client can&#39;t truly trust that ac=\r\nross all services).\n\nc) with PUT to a specific resource\n - this would allow=\r\n the use of GET, PUT and DELETE on the stored input document for management=\r\n, and the client would not need to maintain a mapping of input document to =\r\nstored input document. Sounds great so far.\n - in order to get to the final=\r\n merged document, the response would need to provide a reference to it.
