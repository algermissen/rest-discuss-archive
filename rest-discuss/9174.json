Have you noticed that?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT is only &quot;requests that the enclosed entity be stored&quot;. It does not say\n&gt; MUST.\n\nYes, specs are harder to read these days because their authors must\nguard against abusive interpretations like this.\n\n&gt; If the resource exists, &quot;the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a\n&gt; modified version&quot;. Again, only SHOULD, not MUST and furthermore is says\n&gt; &quot;modified&quot; not &quot;replacement&quot;.\n\nRead the definition of SHOULD.\n\n&gt; The statement that virtually all bets are off concerning the semantics of\n&gt; PUT: &quot;HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an\n&gt; origin server.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s not what that sentence means. Read my first post in this\nthread, where I explain that servers can do anything they want and\nclaim success (2xx). That is quite different from disputing the\nmeaning of the message.\n\n&gt; Citing PATCH doesn&#39;t help, because PATCH was deprecated due to lack of use,\n&gt; which could be read as evidence that merge semantics via PUT was good\n&gt; enough.\n\nThat&#39;s a fallacious argument. PATCH was deprecated because it wasn&#39;t\nimplemented. Neither was PUT, tbh.\n\n&gt; My conclusion is that the spec is ambiguous regarding PUT replacement vs.\n&gt; merge semantics and there is no consensus in the relevant communities on\n&gt; what the semantics should be.\n\nYour conclusion is wrong. My conclusion is that it takes quite a bit\nof cognitive dissonance to give a PUT message merge semantics. This is\nrest-discuss, where we like uniform interfaces. The one concrete\nexample in this thread has shown that a PUT-merge works when you edit\nsome Atom elements, but not others.
