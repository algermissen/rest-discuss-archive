When trying to describe it in terms of\ntechnology, as Roy did[0] I&#39;ve found that preconceived notions get in\nthe way, so I&#39;ve tried to craft an analogy that communicates the\nessence (constraints, desired properties, styles, etc.) without\ngetting bogged down by assumptions.  I&#39;d appreciate any feedback on\nthe correctness and clarity.\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n[0] - http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/on-software-architecture\n\n\n**************************\n\nSuppose a customer comes to your &quot;information business&quot; and says, &quot;I\nhave a need for all the information on organic gardening.&quot;  The\ncustomer travels a lot and needs the information available to him for\nreference when his customers ask gardening questions, but he&#39;s\nfrequently in the fields and, so, isn&#39;t always technology enabled.\n\nYour organization is quite large and information comes from a variety\nof departments.  To make matters worse, you&#39;re in the Solutions\nArchitecture side of the business and so you have no real authority to\ndictate a precise solution - these are &#39;information engineers&#39; after\nall, who need room to flex their creativity.  You are, however,\nallowed to define the solution architecture by way of  &quot;constraints&quot;\non their solution.  These &quot;constraints&quot; take the form of:\n\n1) All the information must be together.\n2) There must be a Table of Content.\n3) All information must have a reference back to the original source.\n\nYou have done this so often though, that you and these engineers have\nagreed that these constraints can be grouped together and referenced\nby a simple name, its architectural style name, instead of enumerating\neach one every time.  This is beneficial because you know that certain\nconstraints, when grouped together, evoke certain properties that are\ncommonly desired by your customer.  This allows you to quickly match\nup your customer&#39;s needs with some starting constraints.  Now, you&#39;ve\npreviously agreed that constraints 1+2+3 above will be referred to as\nthe Compilation Architectural Style.\n\nIt turns out that the constraints of the Compilation Style are a good\nstarting point but they don&#39;t evoke all the properties that your\ncustomer really wants.  They want something that&#39;s lightweight because\nthey travel, they want something that&#39;s easily readable, and they also\nwant something that doesn&#39;t require electricity/technology.\n\nSo you begin with an instance of the Compilation Architectural Style\nand add some concrete constraints to get you from &quot;style&quot; to a real\narchitecture and evoke some properties specifically desired by your\ncustomer.  Namely, you add the following:\n\nA) Compilation Architectural Style\n  - evokes all properties known by the style\nB) Information must be on paper\n  - evokes lack-of-technology property\nC) Information must be printed in Times New Roman\n  - evokes readability property\nD) Must be in a thin plastic binder\n  - evokes lightweight property\n\nSo, you pass along the customer order and your solution architecture\nto the engineers.  Because you&#39;ve chosen to define your solution\narchitecture in terms of &quot;constraints that evoke properties,&quot; you&#39;re\nable to objectively reason about them.  So, when the engineers come\nback and say that they&#39;d prefer Helvetica because, being sans-serif,\nit would save on toner cost, you can reason about how changing this\nconstraint might effective your overall solution architecture.  In\nthis case, that level of font-specificity was simply you trying to\nflex some control where you have none, so you acquiesce.  Likewise,\nthe engineers come back and ask that you change constraint D to\nheavy-weight paper since it&#39;d be a bit lighter - you, again, agree\nthat it still evokes your desired property.\n\nYou deliver your solution, which makes your customer happy.  But then\nyou realize that you ought to capitalize on your latest back and forth\nwith the information engineers.  So, you go to the engineers and agree\nto call constraints B+C+D the Paperback Architectural Style.  In\nfuture requests like the original, this allows you to simply refer to\na hybrid (Compilation Architectural Style + Paperback Architectural\nStyle) solution architecture and know that the desired properties will\nbe evoked.\n\n"}}
