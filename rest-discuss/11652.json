You must also standardize the reference\n&gt; data/master data (aka identifiers) that are poured into such formats. You\n&gt; must also standardize the business &quot;protocols&quot; that define the sequence of\n&gt; exchange of such formats. In other words, you must standards the IFaPs.\n\nActually, identifiers have probably been more successfully\nstandardized than any of the other pieces of that puzzle via UPC bar\ncodes.  I think there&#39;s a lesson somewhere in there.\n\nThe protocols proved to be more difficult.  ebXML and UN/CEFACT tried\nto define them, but got a lot of resistance (&quot;we don&#39;t need that&quot;).\nAnd if course when attempted, they were not defined in any RESTful\nway.\n\n"}}
