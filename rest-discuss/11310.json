This means typical\n&#39;command-line&#39; tools such as WGET, CURL, and WFETCH can use standard\nauthentication w/o any problems.\n\nIn addition, as needed, I implement an optional web login form and\ncookie pattern based on Basic Auth that can be recognized by the\nserver framework. This makes it possible for the server to\nauthenticate using either the custom cookie pattern or standard\nauthentication.\n\nThis is especially handy w/ Ajax apps as the client can use scripting\nto prompt for username/passwords, encode the results and either set\nthe cookie directly or pass to the server for processing. All done\nwithout any &#39;plain text&#39; passing of credentials.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 23, 2008 at 02:39, Miika Makinen &lt;mmiika@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What is the current trend in authentication + authorization?
