You can send &quot;request data&quot;.  The data may\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;either\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;have a specific meaning (e.g. PUT of a resource state) or not (e.g.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;various\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;uses of POST), but it isn&#39;t a representation.  A representation (in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;context of this discussion) can only exist as it relates to a resource.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Only the server has resources and only the server returns representations\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;of\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;those resources.  I think...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yes, you do send representations in PUT and POST.  The &quot;Transfer&quot; in\n&gt;&gt;Representational State Transfer is not just for responses - it also\n&gt;&gt;applies to requests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This makes no sense to me.  What is a request entity a representation of?\n&gt;\nIt is a respresentation of some resource.  One of the main concepts of \nREST is that you transfer representations of things, not the things \nthemselves.  Note that there is no requirement that a resource have a URI.\n\nI dont think its a terrible stretch to go from &quot;POSTing some data&quot; to \n&quot;POSTing a representation.&quot; After all, what is the data that you&#39;re \nPOSTing but a representation of some concept (resource).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A PUT request contains a representation of the\n&gt;&gt;resource you want to store at the specified URI.  And according to Mark\n&gt;&gt;B., the representation transferred in the PUT is the same representation\n&gt;&gt;(bytewise) that&#39;ll be returned by a GET of the same resource (assuming\n&gt;&gt;no intervening state changes).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From RFC2616 Section 9.6:\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\n&gt;supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing\n&gt;resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of\n&gt;the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to\n&gt;an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new\n&gt;resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the\n&gt;resource with that URI.&lt;/quote&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I see nothing here saying that the request entity is a representation.  All\n&gt;that I see is a request entity that may replace or create a new resource\n&gt;identified by the request-URI.\n&gt;\n\nThe request entity is a representation.  In other words, the data in the \nrequest entity comprises a representation of some resource/concept.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I would argue the same holds for POST.  A POST request transfers an\n&gt;&gt;entity to the server.  I don&#39;t see any reason not to consider that\n&gt;&gt;entity a representation of some (perhaps unnamed) resource. In fact, in\n&gt;&gt;some cases, the representation that is transferred will be GETable as a\n&gt;&gt;named resource once it is submitted to the server.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I would be even less inclined to agree with you for POST.  POST only\n&gt;tansfers a request entity.  That&#39;s it.  Seeing it as a representation of an\n&gt;unnamed resource only make the REST model (as applied to HTTP) more\n&gt;confusing to me, not less.\n&gt;\n&gt;This would be an entirely different matter if the request also contained a\n&gt;URI that identified an actual resource that the request entity could be\n&gt;considered a representation of (sort of a PUSH usage instead of PULL).  But\n&gt;it doesn&#39;t.  Not even when using PUT.\n&gt;\n\nSee my response above for PUT.  REST is about transferring \nrepresentations of things.  You don&#39;t transfer anything else between \nclient and server.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
