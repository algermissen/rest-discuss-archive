But I rather like  \n&gt; &quot;Hypermedia constrains/describes protocols.&quot; It is a useful vehicle  \n&gt; for engaging people in this difficult subject area. While the formal\n&gt;   HATEOAS might be useful as a tool for communicating at a PhD level\n&gt; (its original intent), perhaps there are better terms that can be\n&gt; used in a broader software engineering context.\n\nFollow links to advance the conversation.\n\nIt seems to me that part of the problem of making sense of &quot;the engine \nof application state&quot; is that in this context the term state is used in \nan ambiguous way. In Representational State Transfer, the state that is \ntransferred is a snapshot of a resource, represented in a concrete \nformat. Resource state, in most cases, is persistent and sharable.\n\nThe &quot;application&quot; state advanced by following links is entirely \ndifferent state. It is private to each client, the server only \nconstrains which transitions are legal, but otherwise doesn&#39;t know about \nthis state. Therefore, this kind of state is ephemeral. Because of these \nproperties, and because I think &quot;application&quot; state is not distinctive \nenough, I prefer the term conversational state.\n\nStill, HATEOAS by any name is a rather weak constraint as I&#39;ve pointed \nout in other replies and elsewhere[*]. I&#39;d like to repeat in particular, \nthat focusing on this aspect gives quite a lot of prominence to an \nrather trivial aspect of RESTful interaction. The much larger, almost \ncompletely overshadowed problem is how to specify the intended meaning \nof the offered links.\n\nMichael\n\n[*] e.g. \nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/blog/index.php/2009/06/04/humble-hateoas/\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
