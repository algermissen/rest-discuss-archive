It is certainly more useful than doing the same API with RMI, SOAP or CORBA.\n\nHowever, given there is no name for them, they simple become &#39;REST-APIs&#39; which obfuscates the fact that systems using those APIs will *not* have the properties induced by REST.\n\nIf we name them, differentiation between the two becomes a lot easier.\n\n\nWhat I lack is a compelling name that sounds cool enough so API owners can still be proud even if they are not (yet) in the REST-Olymp of things :-) ?\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nHTTP-base APIs\nFixed-URI-APIs\n\nBoth *not* cool....\n\nJan\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
