Since a \nservlet by default grab&#39;s name/value pairs from the message body, how \ndoes it know no to look for name/value pairs?  Is there an implicit \ncontent type on a post request that says the message body will \ncontain name/value pairs?\n\nHere is a second challenge that I have.\n\nAs I have been testing this application, I am realizing that it will \nbe more difficult to test from an html page since html does not allow \nput/delete to be specified on a form.  Also, a form will always write \nparameters as name/value pairs.  \n\nDoes it sound like I am approaching this problem correctly?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
