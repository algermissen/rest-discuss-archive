Objects are finer grained and designed for \npurposes other than external interface needs.\n\n&gt; I think this more comes down to the definition of an object. Is there\n&gt; a difference between an object and a resource? In the broad definition\n&gt; of &quot;resource&quot;, then no. In terms of REST, you can perfectly well\n&gt; design objects that cater to that architectual style. The problem is\n&gt; that &quot;object&quot; can be a lot of things, and specifically things that\n&gt; don&#39;t fit into the REST way of doing things even if you expose them\n&gt; through it.\n\nMy point here is that the potential for abuse is too high.  The OO folks will \ngo ahead and design object models the way they always have, or will reuse \nexisting models, and then just slap some HTTP on top of them with some URLs \nthat reference those objects, and will REST on the 7th day.\n\nAnd then the distributed systems granularity and RPC issues will raise their \nugly heads yet again.\n\nAt least, in the real world, that is my prediction of what the Objects at \nREST suggesting will inevitably lead to.\n\n&gt; Again, we&#39;re back to the old &quot;if done right, then yes, and if done\n&gt; wrong, then no&quot; explanation.\n\nI predict way more wrong than right will be inflicted on business \nstakeholders and IT management with this approach. ;-)\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
