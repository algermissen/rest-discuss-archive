I think the &#39;view&#39; or &#39;controller&#39; \n&gt;&gt; settings should go in the query.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an interesting comparison, but note that it isn&#39;t isomorphic, \n&gt; as the MVC model has no concept of things like connectors, proxies, \n&gt; caches, etc. Nevertheless, a rough comparison is possible. I would \n&gt; tend to think that the HTTP methods take the place of the controller \n&gt; interface, while the various HTTP headers specify the view or, more \n&gt; appropriately, representation that the client then provides the view \n&gt; for. This is conflated, somewhat, by the use of query parameters to \n&gt; identify resources, however query parameters and path segments are \n&gt; largely interchangeable and, hence, this issue can be disregarded. \n&gt; There is clearly a tension in performaing this sort of analysis \n&gt; between pure REST and the current application engineering practices \n&gt; employed on the web. ...\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But what do I know? I only answered to keep the thread going [...]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; and thanks for that!  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Elias\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
