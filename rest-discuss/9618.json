(Is there any light visible in the tunnel on that?) I&#39;ve  \n&gt;&gt; been\n&gt;&gt; looking at work-arounds.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; This seems to come up quite often.  I fail to understand what\n&gt; people are complaining about.  Javascript running within a browser\n&gt; context is inherently untrusted.  Untrusted scripts should not be\n&gt; allowed to perform unsafe actions without user intervention, period.\n&gt; The only reason POST is allowed (and only to the host where the\n&gt; script came from, hopefully) is because there is no other method\n&gt; for sending payload-driven safe queries.\n&gt;   \nRoy,\n\nAre you saying that XHR should not be allowed to do DELETE/PUT/POST \nwithout human intervention?\nWhat do you mean?  Should the browser have a popup each time Google&#39;s \nsearch wants to do it&#39;s assist, for instance? ...or a configurable that \nhas to be set, saying &quot;foo.google.com&quot; is &quot;safe&quot;? \n\nRegardless of the need for human intervention, if the browser XHR \ndoesn&#39;t support the protocol, where are we?\n\nIt seems to me that you designed the HTTP protocol to work this way.  \nIt&#39;s 2007 and they still don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  &#39;Seems ridiculous to me!\n\nXHR does these things behind the scenes all the time, with no explicit \naction on the part of the user.  I simply want all the HTTP protocol to \nbe supported this way, rather than a subset.  I should have clarified in \nmy original post that this was only intended in an XHR context.  Safari \nstill doesn&#39;t do XHR PUT/DELETE as far as I know and I&#39;m interested in \nXHR workarounds that work.\n\nScott\n\n\n\n"}}
