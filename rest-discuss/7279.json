Could you give me some pointers \n&gt; as to why this looked like POX to you? I&#39;ll gladly try to clarify the\n&gt; design why I believe it to be RESTish, but I&#39;m just as eager to learn\n&gt; from my mistakes as well. Thanks.\n\nSteve, thanks for your courteous question. \n\nI don&#39;t know why it didn&#39;t occur to me that you might be on the list.\nAnyway, as I am relatively new to learning the rigor of REST, my assertion\nthat it was more like Plain Old XML was as much to verify I was viewing it\ncorrectly as it as a statement I believed to be fact.  So I hope that others\nsuch as Roy Fielding, Mark Baker, Jan Algermissen, Bill de hOra, Nic\nFerrier, or others  verify that my evaluation.  But the following is why I\nbelieved it to not be exactly RESTful:\n\n-- You list methods such as GetAnswer and GetServiceInfo.  In REST, the only\nvalid methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\n-- You use the same (root) URL for GetServiceInfo, DeleteService, and\nGetConfiguration but you should be using different resources for the third\nfrom the first two. Instead, each resource should have it&#39;s own URL and then\nyou would perform one of the four operations on the resource, depending on\nwhat operation you wanted.\n\nBTW, use GET to retrieve, POST to add/insert, PUT to update, and DELTE to,\nwell, delete.\n\nI have updated your response XML taking some liberties in my update, to show\nyou what I would have expect to see a REST service hypermedia mapping file\nlook like:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;blueprint&gt;\n\t&lt;assembly&gt;\n\t\tdream.tutorial.8ball, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,\nPublicKeyToken=null\n         &lt;/assembly&gt;\n\t&lt;type&gt;MindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService&lt;/type&gt;\n\t&lt;name&gt;Dream Tutorial 8-Ball&lt;/name&gt;\n\t&lt;info&gt;http://doc.opengarden.org/Dream_SDK/Tutorials/8-Ball&lt;/info&gt;\n\t&lt;feature&gt;\n\t\t&lt;description&gt;Returns a random 8-ball message&lt;/description&gt;\n\t\n&lt;info&gt;http://doc.opengarden.org/dream_sdk/tutorials/8-ball/answer/&lt;/info&gt;\n\t\t&lt;method&gt;GET&lt;/method&gt;\n\t&lt;/feature&gt;\n\t&lt;feature&gt;\n\t\t&lt;description&gt;Retrieve service description&lt;/description&gt;\n\t\t&lt;info&gt;http://www.mindtouch.com/service/&lt;/info&gt;\n\t\t&lt;method&gt;GET&lt;/method&gt;\n\t&lt;/feature&gt;\n\t&lt;feature&gt;\n\t\t&lt;description&gt;Stop service&lt;/description&gt;\n\t\t&lt;info&gt;http://www.mindtouch.com/service/&lt;/info&gt;\n\t\t&lt;method&gt;DELETE&lt;/method&gt;\n\t&lt;/feature&gt;\n\t&lt;feature&gt;\n\t\t&lt;description&gt;Retrieve service configuration&lt;/description&gt;\n\t\t&lt;info&gt;http://www.mindtouch.com/service/configuration/&lt;/info&gt;\n\t\t&lt;method&gt;GET&lt;/method&gt;\n\t&lt;/feature&gt;\n&lt;/blueprint&gt;\n\nOf course, I might be 100% wrong since, as I said, I&#39;m still learning this.\nHopefully someone else on the list more knowledgeable than me will either\nverify that I am correct or explain where I went wrong.\n\nHTH.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
