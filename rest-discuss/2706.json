Since I last mentioned it, a lot\nof progress has been made.  Currently, I am updating its use of Xerces-C\nfrom 1.6 to 2.1.  When I have finally released it, which should be soon, I\nwill be sure to first mention it here.  Here are some features:\n\n1. Class design includes CGeneral, CRequest, CResponse for messaging;\n   CResource and CRepresentation for resources and representations;\n   CContainer, CComponent, CConnector, CFilter and CNode as specialized\n   resources.\n2. Utility classes include implementation of thread pool, socket classes,\n   multi-byte and XMLCh strings, URIs, lists, dictionaries, items, etc.\n2. Extensible connector-based filtering through client- and server-based\n   connector filters.\n3. Design of environmental acquisition (e.g., python) and something\n   I call &quot;indirect traversal&quot; which is a way to make URIs more dynamic in\n   terms of how the server resolves them.\n4. Object and resource factories for dynamic registry of factories that\n   create specialized objects.\n5. Very very primitive support for XML - the whole framework serializes\n   itself based on a simple 10-line DTD that uses some core elements and\n   attributes to define typing, scoping, naming, and containment.\n\nOnce I finally release a first version, I really look forward to moving onto\nthinking about real-world examples like Paul&#39;s RESTmail idea, Bob&#39;s auction\nidea, etc.\n\nThanks for being patient,\nPhilip\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Uday .S [mailto:kumarudaya@...]\nSent: Monday, September 23, 2002 5:23 PM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Newbie: Any REST Implementations?\n\n\nHi,\n  I am very new to REST and would like to know is there a Open Source REST\nimplementation that i can look at it...\n\nThanks,\n-Uday.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
