A conceptual question: should I even think in terms of &quot;a service&quot; when it comes to REST? Is there necessarily always a &quot;service&quot; behind the RESTful interface that is processing the HTTP messages that are being sent to/from the RESTful system? I know that opening up the whole SOA versus REST question is a huge can of worms but I am trying to get down to even the most basic of questions: is the mental construct of a &quot;service&quot; a useful one when it comes to architecting my distributed systems using the principles of REST? Or is it better to say that the Resource is the conceptual primitive that I should be focusing on and that, as such, I should let go of any notion of service lingering from a numbers of years of being immersed in this thing called SOA?\n\nI try to think in this way.\n\nYou have interesting data/functions that people want, so you start up\na service, provide an interface (hiding all complexity behind it) to\nallow users to access your data/functions in a simple way.\n\n*Interface* is like an abstraction of your service. So, how do you\nmodel your service abstraction? E.g. to provide a web searching\nservice,\n\nIf model it as a procedure call, your are thinking &quot;I want to perform\na search, so I doGoogleSearch&quot;.\n\nIf model it in data-centric way, your thinking is &quot;I want to get that\nsearch results.&quot; Which search results? &quot;The search results of\n&#39;beatles&#39;! I have its identifier, here:\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=beatles&quot;.\n\n\nRecently I started to sense the HTTP resource abstraction model [1] is\nlike a network-based cousin of Unix file system (Container/directory,\nreadonly, read-writable file, Processor/executable file).\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-state-model\n\n--\nTeo Hui Ming\n\n"}}
