I got some \ninteresti=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; responses to this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s my understanding th=\r\nat &quot;on&quot; is a either a\n&gt; meaningless resource or not a resource altogether.\n=\r\nBut its a &quot;state&quot; of the resource, why can&#39;t it be modeled as a state?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAnother (RESTful?) solution could be to POST to a resource that is\n&gt; &gt; resp=\r\nonsible for turning a lightbulb on.  For example, POST \n&#92;lightswitch\n&gt; &gt; se=\r\nnding in the light bulb and state (on/off) chosen.\n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds better =\r\nbut you don&#39;t create another resource, you just\n&gt; update the status of the =\r\nresource &quot;lightswitch&quot;.\n&gt; Why don&#39;t you just PUT a representation of the re=\r\nsource lightswitch \nto\n&gt; update it?\nBecause I am about to impact another re=\r\nsource i.e. light bulb.  \nAdditionally, for me to effectively indicate what=\r\n exactly I want to \nhappen to the light bulb I have to include &quot;on&quot; in the =\r\nbody of the \nPUT. \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lawrence, oluyede.org - neropercaso.it\n&gt; &quot;It is =\r\ndifficult to get a man to understand\n&gt; something when his salary depends on=\r\n not\n&gt; understanding it&quot; - Upton Sinclair\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
