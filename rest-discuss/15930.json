It seems to me that giving the client control over part\n&gt; of th=\r\ne URI requires them to understand how resources are organized\n&gt; and forces =\r\nthem to construct URIs as non-opaque strings.\n\nIf your client is forced to =\r\nconstruct URI&#39;s as non-opaque strings then\nyour media type is lacking. The =\r\nresponse to the previous request should\ncontain a form or other URI-constru=\r\nction element that tells the client\nhow to construct the URI (and possibly =\r\nthe request body) in a fashion\nthat is as opaque as possible to the client.=\r\n The fact that HTML does not\nprovide this for PUT is an unfortunate oversig=\r\nht.\n\nSome protocols make this knowledge so uniform that it doesn&#39;t need the=\r\n\nmedia type to provide a form--it&#39;s embedded in the definition of the\nproto=\r\ncol itself.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n\n"}}
