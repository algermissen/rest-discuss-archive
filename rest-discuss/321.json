The reciever\nshould use the message-id to recognize repeat\nsends and deliver once to the user.\n\nI think that is the behavior you want.\n\n&gt; &gt; Here is a short version of asynchronous callbacks\n&gt; &gt; using SMTP:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Send the message to the reply-to address using SMTP\n&gt;\n&gt; You can do the same in HTTP. Just return a reply-to address. *BUT*.\n&gt; *BUT*. *BUT*. The part you&#39;re missing is that we are trying to identify\n&gt; what makes the web such a great, scalable, interoperable, popular system\n&gt; and extend that into the domain of asynch, events, etc. reply-to is\n&gt; trivial. But what if you want to say that you DON&#39;T want the reply any\n&gt; more? What if you want to have a centralized list of the things you are\n&gt; expecting replies about? If you haven&#39;t given the reply-request a URI\n&gt; then you can&#39;t do these things.\n\nBuild that.  Those things are orthogonal from\nasynchronous message delivery (or polling).\n\n&gt; &gt; Terrorist_or_not.com uses RPC to deliver the\n&gt; &gt; queries.  The target of the POST is a function not\n&gt; &gt; a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is not the definition of RPC. What&#39;s wrong with a function being a\n&gt; resource? It becomes RPC when the function starts dispatching on method\n&gt; names and setting up private namespaces.\n\nYou can&#39;t GET a function and URLs are opaque.\nDoes something magical happen when some content\nmoves from the body to the url?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
