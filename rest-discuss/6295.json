You write &quot;The HTTP spec doesn&#39;t say we&#39;re allowed to \nhave URLs with usernames and passwords in them so we can&#39;t guarentee \nthat they work anywhere else either.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s not really the HTTP spec that&#39;s relevant. It&#39;s the URI spec, RFC \n3986. What that says is:\n\n    The userinfo subcomponent may consist of a user name and, optionally,\n    scheme-specific information about how to gain authorization to access\n    the resource.  The user information, if present, is followed by a\n    commercial at-sign (&quot;@&quot;) that delimits it from the host.\n\n       userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / &quot;:&quot; )\n\n    Use of the format &quot;user:password&quot; in the userinfo field is\n    deprecated.  Applications should not render as clear text any data\n    after the first colon (&quot;:&quot;) character found within a userinfo\n    subcomponent unless the data after the colon is the empty string\n    (indicating no password).  Applications may choose to ignore or\n    reject such data when it is received as part of a reference and\n    should reject the storage of such data in unencrypted form.  The\n    passing of authentication information in clear text has proven to be\n    a security risk in almost every case where it has been used.\n\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
