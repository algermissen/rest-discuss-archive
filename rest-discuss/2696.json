That is, a situation where it would be nice to \ndo e.g.:\n\nGET http://x/1?GET=http://y/2?GET=http://z/3\n\nThat is, a situation where it would be useful to pass the results of \nGETting z/3 as input to y/2 to be transformed, and then passing the \nresults of that as input to x/1 and getting the result of that \ntransformation.  And it&#39;s necessary to do this strictly via a URI, that \nis,\n\nhttp://x/1?GET=http://y/2?GET=http://z/3\n\nor somesuch is the name of this pipelined transformation result.  \nVarious folks around here have advocated this in the past, so I need \nsome advice:  the above won&#39;t work since the ? delimited parts of the \nquery string will be interpreted as separate parameters for x/1.  An \nalternative syntax for this might be:\n\nhttp://x/1/GET=http://y/2/GET=http://z/3\n\n...but it seems like getting e.g. Apache to do the right thing in this \ncase might be tricky.  It&#39;s particularly difficult since any of the \nsub-URI may themselves have query strings --- the part I&#39;m calling z/3 \nin fact has a horrendously long query string of its own that shouldn&#39;t \nbe interpreted by x or y (it&#39;s a bugzilla query, fyi.)  Anybody have \nany suggestions on how to set things up here?  Something to do with \nmod_rewrite?  Examples --- particularly Python code--- much appreciated.\n\njb\n\nBTW --- A colleague up at work wrote a MoinMoin processor that allows \nyou to embed dot code directly into a Wiki page and have it generate / \nrender the described graph, if anybody&#39;s interested.  Also have a piece \nof Python code I wrote that turns wiki-style tables plus a &quot;map&quot; \ndatastructure into a dot graph description...  if anybody&#39;s interested, \ngive me a holler.  When we get the RESTWiki back up, we should install \nthis stuff there --- tres useful.  We use our Wiki up at work to \ncoordinate all development specification and planning activities, and a \nlot of this stuff is the trivial fruit of some work to integrate Wiki \nand bugzilla and automate various dev planning processes.\n\n\n"}}
