It feels right to me, but I&#39;m now\nthinking more =\r\nabout nice qualities like caching and namespace design.\n\n1. Let&#39;s say I hav=\r\ne an obvious resource; user photos. And expose it\nlike this:\n\n../users/ID/p=\r\nhotos\n\nWhen an request comes in, the identity of the requester is used to\na=\r\nuthorize access to only certain photos. It would be nice if the\nresulting r=\r\nepresentation could be cached and remain (relatively)\nsecure. One approach =\r\nwould be to include a difficult to guess token in\nthe URI with a short cach=\r\ne life. But where to put the token?\n\nA query string param seems natural, bu=\r\nt some web accelerators &\ncaches ignore URLs with query parameters (i.e. go=\r\nogle web\naccelerator). I guess too often they have side effects (or expose\n=\r\nprivate data). \n\nAny other ideas? Seems like this would be a common problem=\r\n.\n\n2. Simpler question following the same example. What would be a\nRESTful =\r\nway to add ratings to photos. Maybe just a PUT on something like:\n\n../users=\r\n/ID/photos/ID/ratings\n\nI wanted to avoid a deep URI hierarchy, but this see=\r\nms to fit. Am I\nheading in the right direction?\n\n\n"}}
