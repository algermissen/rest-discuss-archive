More seriously, I don&#39;t think the suggested \ninteraction is strange. If I would, I wouldn&#39;t have suggested it in the \nfirst place. Am I missing something? What do you think is strange about \nit?\n\n&gt; You could make the action of grabbing the award a state transition\n&gt; and do a GET on /Award/xyz.  The returned representation could\n&gt; provide links to potential recipients, or could indicate that the\n&gt; award has already been given.\n\nI&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do that, Dave^H^Hrrel. The problem is that there are \ntoo many potential recipients. Say the user starts dragging a Best Actor \nin a Leading Role award. There are literally thousands of potential \nrecipients and the choice is only restricted by what the client is \ncurrently displaying to the user. Thus, the client needs a way to ask \nthe server which of these candidates really are hopefuls.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
