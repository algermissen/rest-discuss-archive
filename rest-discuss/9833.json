Even now in Pete&#39;s design you have a\n&gt; li=\r\nst of cancelled orders and shipped orders. What he has done is that\n&gt; to ch=\r\nange the state of the resource, you do a PUT on the actual orders\n&gt; and not=\r\n on the list. The list is just a read only resource denoting\n&gt; which order =\r\nis in which state.\n\n\nWell maybe it shouldn&#39;t, however my implementation wou=\r\nld have to do\n\nif state changed to ship, then send e-mail\n\nelse if changed =\r\nto cancel, then do nothing.\n\nTo me this is no different (from a server-side=\r\n implementation angle)\nthat passing &quot;cancel&quot; or &quot;ship&quot; in the body of the H=\r\nTTP method. Granted\nI will communicate the change differently, but I would =\r\nstill have to do\nthe above logic.\n\nIf I PUT/POST to a resource directly, th=\r\nen I know I want to &quot;ship&quot; and I\ndon&#39;t have to &quot;test&quot; the state of the reso=\r\nurce.\n\nMake sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
