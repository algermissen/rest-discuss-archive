When invoked, the task connects to a database to find\nthe connection settings of the device, and contacts it to download its\ndata. \n\nThis task is synchrounous by default (it could be async), i.e. the\nclient calls this service and listens to the output that returns\nloging info, and a final result.\n\nIs this type of process a good candidate for a REST api? \n\nFor example, the URL could be defined as:\n\n http://server/ws/downloadDeviceData?device=1234\n\nIn this example, the service is called as a GET action. \n\nI can usually quite easily see where GET, POST, PUT and DELETE fit in\na typical REST system, but with an &quot;acquisition&quot; system like the one\ndescribed here, I do not see it as clearly.\n\nOpinions on this would be appreciated.\n\n--\nClaude\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
