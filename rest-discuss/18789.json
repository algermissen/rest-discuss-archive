in a very different way then it was\n&gt; used in HTML4; is this really a good idea?\n\ni certainly do not intend to use it in a different way, because like \nyou, i do not think that would be a good idea. my current definition is \nthat &quot;a profile are additional semantics that can be used to process a \nresource representation, such as constraints, conventions, extensions, \nor any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type semantics.&quot;\n\nmy understanding of HTML&#39;s profile was always like this. quoting from \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#profiles :\n\n&quot;User agents may be able to recognize the name (without actually \nretrieving the profile) and perform some activity based on known \nconventions for that profile. For instance, search engines could provide \nan interface for searching through catalogs of HTML documents, where \nthese documents all use the same profile for representing catalog entries.&quot;\n\nmark also noted that he regards a profile mostly as saying something \nabout a representation&#39;s content, such as a metadata profile in HTML, \nsaying that the web page uses dublin core. but even when you look at the \ndublin core HTML profile (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/), it \nalso defines conventions about links \n(http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/#sect-2-4), and not just about \nnon-link data. which is the point i was trying to make saying that the \nline between &quot;format extensions&quot; and &quot;links&quot; is fuzzy: essentially, a \nlink *is* a format extension, only one that extends beyond the current \nresource.\n\ni am not sure i was able to fully address your concerns, so if you still \nthink i am &quot;redefining&quot; what &#39;profile&#39; is supposed to do, could you be a \nbit more specific why you think that&#39;s the case, and how you&#39;d like to \nsee it done?\n\nthanks a lot and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
