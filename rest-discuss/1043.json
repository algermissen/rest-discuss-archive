I was thinking about things\n&gt; like &#39;hello world&#39;, a calculator, an addressbook, a simple chat program.\nThe calculator might be a bad sample problem, because it doesn&#39;t show the\nutility of REST - transferring the state of a calculator is unnecessary\nbecause the state can be completely algorithmically regenerated on the\nclient. A &#39;shared calculator&#39; might be interesting though.\nThe addressbook is a really good example - there is a wide range of\napproaches, from simple ones to get the general feel and style of REST, and\nsome more complex ones that get into the tougher areas of collections,\nnesting, multi-protocol linking, security, etc.\nThe chat might be better cast as discussion groups, since &#39;hot live chat&#39;\nisn&#39;t that common with pure HTTP (unless you use KnowNow technology.)\n\nAnother thing to think about is to avoid the &#39;browser == web&#39; mentality that\nthrows people off the http trail. Toss XML around (without worring about\nusing &#39;industry standard schemas&#39;) and do some linking between things\n(possibly between apps...).\n\n\n&gt; Is the REST wiki a good place to start such a document, or should I\n&gt; put it on the Ruby wiki? (the document could have different versions\n&gt; for other programming languages as well).\n&gt; Any suggestions would be most welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Erik Terpstra.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
