I\nbegan implementing those ideas, but abandoned them as the code began\nto get more and more repetitive.  Writing a REST application seems\nnaturally suited to a code generator.\n\nHowever, what description format should this code generator take?\nPaul uses a WSDL example in his latest xml.com article, but observes\nthat WSDL doesn&#39;t support links.  I also noticed that the WSDL note\nonly mentions HTTP GET/POST, and for a code generator you&#39;d want to\nsay what other HTTP operations (DEL, PUT, &c) are supported on a\nresource.  Also, the authors of the note are all from large companies\nthat have embraced SOAP, making me pessimistic about the likelihood of\nimproving the WSDL HTTP binding.\n\nThe other option is Paul&#39;s WRDL, but its current state of completion\nisn&#39;t clear, though the TODO list does seem to be mostly second-order\nthings.\n\nAnyone have suggestions on which format would be the best choice?\n\n--amk                                                             (www.amk.ca)\n&quot;Symbols have *power*, Netley...
