I know some are talking about using the Links header..but =\r\nfrom what I gather it&#39;s not going to be standard until HTML5, which who kno=\r\nws when that will come out.\n\n(Link header is orthogonal to HTML5.

It has already been in an earlier ersion of HTTP, to=\r\no)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As well, I am not quite sure how you specify the methods that can =\r\nbe used..\n\nWrite it up in the specification of your hypermedia controls (Se=\r\ne my last posting on that, too).\n\n&gt; GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Just like HTML =\r\ndoes for &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt; or &lt;form&gt;\n\n&gt; If it is SELF then you can only GET to tha=\r\nt URI&quot;? or is there another attribute that lists the allowed methods on the=\r\n URI of each link? I guess I am looking for a little help in understanding =\r\nhow best to describe this HATEOAS API to other developers that will consume=\r\n it.. how to get them started, and how to explain each URI they can use at =\r\nany given point and what methods they can use on the URI, what params, what=\r\n body, etc.\n\nJust do the equivalent of AtomPub or OpenSearch for what you n=\r\need your service to enable.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of a DELETE, if it succeeds.=\r\n. it returns a 204 No Content.\n\nMaybe. Or a 303 See other, or a 202 Accepte=\r\nd ...\n\n&gt; How then do you respond with any sort of links that it can do at t=\r\nhat point? If it can&#39;t return any body, I can&#39;t return any &lt;links&gt; with it.=\r\n\n\nRight. The point you are (correctly) making here is what to consider the =\r\nsteady state after a 204. My personal opinion is that the steady state rema=\r\nins the one you were in before. If that had changed, the server should have=\r\n sent you a 303 See Other to reload that state.\n\n(There is a lot to be leve=\r\nraged from the HTTP codes themselves!)\n\n\n&gt; I think we &quot;can&quot; fudge it.. but =\r\nthen I would guess it wouldn&#39;t be RESTful to provide any sort of body with =\r\na No Content response.
