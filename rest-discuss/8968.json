MSFT wasn&#39;t there.  So\n&gt; it wasn&#39;t about &quot;MS, Sun and IBM&quot;s goals, nor reformating REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was hoping to hear more on the bridging of architectures from the non\n&gt; software vendors, but didn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; A great deal of the reason why there are 2 very different tools in the\n&gt; toolbox is because nobody has provided joins between the tools.  Even when I\n&gt; have different tools in the toolbox, sometimes they can have things in\n&gt; common to make it easier to use the essential parts of each tool.  Like\n&gt; having a metric to imperial conversion or tools with both units.\n\nDave,\n\nAre there any resources / write-ups about the kind of tools that you\nhave in mind? It sounds like my impressions of what you mean is\nincorrect and that may be because there is no context on the\nreferenced blog entry and the Meeting report does not elaborate on\nthat aspect.\n\nThe reason why I mentioned MS, Sun and IBM is that it is hard to\nimagine a significant delta to the WS-* spec stack without their\nbuy-in, even if they weren&#39;t in the room - but if your comments do not\nimply any specification changes to WS-*, it isn&#39;t important.\n\nI have to admit that I wonder what the WS &lt;-&gt; REST interop requirement\nis. No obvious use cases come to mind - although that could simply be\nthat it&#39;s nearly midnight here and I&#39;m knackered ;-)\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
