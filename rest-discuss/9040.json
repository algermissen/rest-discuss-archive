So, is &quot;Current\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Location of requesting user&quot; a valid resource retrievable via\n&gt;&gt; &gt; HTTP? I think the answer is a noncontroversial yes, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted to double check before asking the followup:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My two cents is &quot;no.&quot; If one needed a generic URL I think it should\n&gt;&gt; redirect to a specific one. Not sure what status code. But I would  \n&gt;&gt; also be\n&gt;&gt; interested in hearing any counter arguments if there are any...\n&gt;\n&gt; In previous discussions [1] we ended up with some kind of  \n&gt; conclusion that a generic URI can be the &#39;current user&#39; in that it  \n&gt; will always temporarily non-cached varied redirect to the user&#39;s  \n&gt; URI. For example, I&#39;ve done it like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /\n&gt;\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; Content-Type: text/xml\n&gt; &lt;capabilities&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;users xlink:href=&quot;/users&quot; /&gt;  &lt;!-- This is where to POST if  \n&gt; registering a new user --&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;currentUser xlink:href=&quot;/users;current&quot; /&gt;  &lt;!-- Redirects to  \n&gt; the home of the authenticated user --&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/capabilities&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; GET (or even HEAD) /users;current will require authentication, and  \n&gt; on success will be something along the lines of:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; HEAD /users;current\n&gt; Authorization: (basic: stain:****)\n&gt;\n&gt; 307 Temporary redirect\n&gt; Location: /users/stain\n&gt; Vary: Authorization\n&gt; Cache-Control: private\n&gt;\n&gt; The key here is that the redirect claims Vary: Authorization  \n&gt; because the redirect varies depending on the authorization header.  \n&gt; In addition it tries kindly to ask non-Vary-aware proxies not to  \n&gt; cache, which they shouldn&#39;t do with a temporary redirect anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only downfall is that really this should be quite cacheable if  \n&gt; the authorisation is always the same.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/8464\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Stian Soiland, myGrid team\n&gt; School of Computer Science\n&gt; The University of Manchester\n&gt; http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ssoiland/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nStian Soiland, myGrid team\nSchool of Computer Science\nThe University of Manchester\nhttp://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ssoiland/\n\n\n\n"}}
