These semantics include what happens when  \nyou interact through HTTP with them (e.g. &quot;PUT /lock&quot; creates the lock  \nor &quot;DELETE /lock&quot; deletes the lock). This is the result of turning  \nspecialized APIs into a uniform API.\n\nIn this sense the resources have a type and clients use this  \ninformation to achieve the goals that constitute a given RESTful API.\n\nThe important thing in my opinion is that the resources do not have  \nthese types out of themselves but that what matters is by what link  \nthe client discovered them. E.g. given &lt;link rel=&quot;lock&quot; href=&quot;/locks/ \n344&quot;/&gt; a client could know that it can use /locks/344 to establish a  \nlock on the link source resource (by way of the definition of th elink  \nrelation). For the moment the client will think of /locks/344 as being  \n&#39;a lock&#39;.\n\nLikewise, API specifications will use type-like language to describe  \nhow the API goals are achieved. Atom Pub for example writes:\n\n&quot;4.2 Documents and Resource Classification\nA Resource whose IRI is listed in a Collection is called a Member  \nResource.\n[...]\n&quot;\nI do not see how this notion of &#39;type&#39; could be avoided.\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sep 2, 2008, at 1:41 AM, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n\n&gt; What do you call the concept of &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;types&quot; of resources in\n&gt; your RESTful designs?

Both &quot;resource\n&gt; class&quot; and &quot;resource type&quot; would work, but don&#39;t seem really  \n&gt; convincing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
