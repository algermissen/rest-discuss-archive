My point in this line of reasoning is not to downplay the\nimportance of the registered media-type name but, rather, to highlight\nthe notion that operational semantics that can be embedded in a\nresponse in several ways.\n\nI agree that there is a point where the media-type string can be no\nlonger helpful in predicting an application&#39;s understanding of the\nassociated message body. I deal with this disconnect every day in my\nown programming against any number of existing web services &quot;APIs.&quot;\n\nAt the same time, I have seen enough examples of custom LINK\ninformation in existing media-types (XHTML and Atom have this support\nin their design) to think there are additional opportunities to\nimprove the semantic value of existing media-types without\nsignificantly degrading the value of the media-type control data.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 16, 2009 at 23:51, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Wed, Dec 16, 2009 at 7:17 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; There are a few efforts to improve the data semantics for common types\n&gt;&gt; (RDFa comes to mind). I think it&#39;s time to do some serious work to\n&gt;&gt; improve the operational semantics, too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think a lot can be done to add semantic value to existing media\n&gt;&gt; types just by adding LINKS w/ rel values. No matter the media-type\n&gt;&gt; (XHTML, XML, Atom, etc.) a custom client that has access to clearly\n&gt;&gt; documented LINK+rel values can understand and process quite a bit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Taking an approach that uses the XHTML LINK element + rel values may\n&gt;&gt; be a viable way to increase the semantic value of these common types\n&gt;&gt; w/o destroying the original meaning and value for Web browsers and\n&gt;&gt; other existing clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; But then aren&#39;t we going backwards here?\n&gt;\n&gt; First, let me be clear, my primary interest and slant on this in the\n&gt; MtoM space of code talking to code, and the only time any reads this\n&gt; stuff is if they&#39;re debugging it.\n&gt;\n&gt; But basically, now the media type doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.\n&gt; Embedded RDF, HTML Link Rel tags, whatever. I can&#39;t tell anything\n&gt; whatsoever from the media type now. Media type may as well be\n&gt; application/octet-stream. Because in order to get any value out of it,\n&gt; I now need to introspect the payloads to see what&#39;s what, and whether\n&gt; it&#39;s useful to me at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can try con neg, but it may well simply give three different kinds\n&gt; of XHTML. Not helpful at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we&#39;re going to get rid of the mime type, then I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all\n&gt; sorts of wonderful things that can be crammed in the payload that\n&gt; affect semantics and behavior, but I think that&#39;s been done already.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, as part of, perhaps, the Semantic Web, which is effectively\n&gt; trying to automate and make discoverable the Human consumed web. Fine.\n&gt; There you&#39;re pretty much stuck with piggy backing on top of HTML to\n&gt; get any thing with any traction (since sending XSLT links with XML\n&gt; probably won&#39;t really take off...).\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n\n"}}
