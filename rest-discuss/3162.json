Note\nalso that even if I force all attachments to be\nexternal-URLs, I still want the server to be able\nto change those locations unilaterally.\n\nAny thoughts on how to solve this without forcing\nthe client to GET the entire folder each time?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
