I&#39;ve looked at XStreams, xmlBlaster, wddx, \nxbind and xmlbeans to unify my design, but havent really been stirred by \nanything (except the sheer simplicity of XStreams).  I dont particularly \ncare what the native implementation is in, so long as the standard is \nwell defined enough and &quot;simple&quot; enough to be rebuilt.\n\nIn my quest for object serialization, I&#39;m hoping REST List might provide \nsome feedback, and perhaps some good pointers into the RESTWiki (which \nI&#39;ve plumbed but found little info in).\n\nREST is about resources, but how do we represent these resources?  I&#39;m \nsure I&#39;m about to cross an electric fense, but resources in modern \ncomputing are often representable as objects; collections of other \nobjects.\n\n\n\n\nI realize that to define this as a standard would go above the very \nnature of REST as a principle rather than a standard, but all good \nprinciples have standards underlying them.  Paul Prescod has a good \narticle on &quot;why not&quot; I&#39;ve linked below, but somewhere behind why not \nlies a coder trying to make a choice:\nhttp://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding/\n\nI&#39;m hoping this is not too off topic, I knew of no better place to turn \nto in this conundrum.\n\nMany thanks,\nMyren\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
