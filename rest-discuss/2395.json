(that was sort of the whole point, though i doubt i made \n&gt; that clear enough.)\n\nThe syntax for expressing equivalence relations should be standard (we in\nthe topic maps community have our views on what the standard should be ;-)\nbut anyone the on web should be free to use the syntax. Of course, some\nexpressions of equivalence will be more authoritative than others --\nnaming autorities, for example.\n\nSam Hunting\neTopicality, Inc.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;Turn your searching experience into a finding experience.&quot;(tm)\n\nTopic map consulting and training: www.etopicality.com\nFree open source topic map tools:  www.goose-works.org\n\nXML Topic Maps: Creating and Using Topic Maps for the Web.\nAddison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-74960-2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
