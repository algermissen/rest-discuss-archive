Is the content generated, or just on\ndisk?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This problem (load balancing vs. ETag generation) was recognized a\nwhile\n&gt; &gt; back, and I know that Apache has recently put a fix in (but IIRC you\nhave\n&gt; &gt; to explicitly configure the behaviour). Depending on your situation,\nthere\n&gt; &gt; are a number of ways to approach the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Simon Fell&quot; &lt;sf@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, May 19, 2002 1:58 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re[2]: [rest-discuss] HTTP caching questions ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ok, here goes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically i need to support efficient checks that content is upto\n&gt; &gt;&gt; date, and to also support resumable downloads [some of the content is\n&gt; &gt; large\n&gt; &gt;&gt; binary files accessed via a potentially un-reliable low bandwidth\n&gt; &gt;&gt; connection]. This content is potentially served by a set of web\nservers\n&gt; &gt;&gt; running behind a HTTP load balancer.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For a single server scenario, this seems pretty straightforward, At\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the client cache I track expected size [from the content-length\n&gt; &gt;&gt; header], Etag and last-modified. for subsequent requests I populate a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If-None-Match header from the etag, a Range & Range-If header if the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; expected size is not the same as the cached file size, and i send a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If-Modified-Since header if i don&#39;t have a Range header [my reading\nof\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the use of Range & Range-If lead me to believe to not use\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If-Modified-Since if i&#39;m using ranges].\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My concern is when i have 2 or more web servers, all running behind a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; load balancer [local director etc], that each server will be\nassigning\n&gt; &gt;&gt; different etags to the same content (i don&#39;t see anything in the spec\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that lets me assume different server instances will generate the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etag for the same content, even for the same versions of HTTP server\n&gt; &gt;&gt; software). This is leading me to think about not using etags, and to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; just use the modified date, but then it doesn&#39;t look like you can do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ranges with modified dates. Its also crossed my mind to use\n&gt; &gt;&gt; content-md5, but this doesn&#39;t seem very widely support [if at all].\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any suggestions ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Simon\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Saturday, May 18, 2002, 1:50:51 PM, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think it would be great if you asked the questions here. I am not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;deep&quot; in HTTP cacheing but I know that Mark Nottingham is and I\n&gt; &gt; suspect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mark Baker knows quite a bit also. This list seems to be the last\n&gt; &gt; refuge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of people who don&#39;t think of HTTP as a dinosaur ;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; simonfell99 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m in the process of prototyping a REST version of an existing\nRPC\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based system, a large chunk of this system revolves around\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; efficiently managing updates to content at the client system. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; looking at using the HTTP/1.1 caching support (Etag, If-Modified-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Since, If-None-Match and If-Range). I have some questions about\nhow\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this works when deployed on a cluster of servers with a load\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; balancer, is this a good place to ask, or can someone recommend a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good list to discuss HTTP caching.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tx\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
