It might be neces=\r\nsary for clients and servers to\n&gt; exchange additional out-of-band informati=\r\non on the proper way to form\n&gt; the message for a particular media type (ele=\r\nment names, order, etc.),\n&gt; but that descriptive information is something e=\r\nlse.\n&gt; \n\nIs that out-of-band info &quot;allowed&quot; from a REST perspective? I&#39;ve a=\r\nlways assumed that constraints on a general media types must be communicate=\r\nd in hypermedia (just like the URI). In other words, you need something lik=\r\ne a &lt;form&gt;. Is that not the case?\n \nThough I suppose the &quot;form&quot; constraints=\r\n could also be fixed. ie. the definition of application/orderform+xml descr=\r\nibes the constraints on application/x-form-urlencoded requests so no run-ti=\r\nme info is needed. Still, the available choices are a) something specific i=\r\nn the definition of the media type(s) or b) something communicated at run-t=\r\nime in hypermedia (or a combination of a and b). Make sense?\n\n\n&gt; Finally, t=\r\nhe details of the entity body are only interesting to the\n&gt; two parties inv=\r\nolved in the message (sender, receiver). From the\n&gt; intermediaries POV, the=\r\ny need to no nothing about this body - in fact\n&gt; should not be peeking into=\r\n the body at all.\n\nIs that actually a constraint? Some protocols, like SIP,=\r\n place explicit restrictions on what a proxy can do with the body. But I wa=\r\nsn&#39;t aware of anything in HTTP that restricted the proxy behavior this way =\r\n-- and I can&#39;t think of a REST constraint on this.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
