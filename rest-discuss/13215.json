For each new job, the client first\nperforms a POST to th=\r\ne URI that represents the job type. The server\ncreates a job number and ret=\r\nurns the full URI to the client. The two job\ntypes are virtually identical,=\r\n except that one is stored permanently on\nthe server.\n\nclient =3D&gt; POST /jo=\r\nbtype1\nserver =3D&gt; 201 Created + http://jobserver/jobtype1/1234   (where 12=\r\n34\nrepresents the job number)\n\nFrom here, the client PUTs various attribute=\r\ns of the job to the server,\n(PUT /jobtype1/1234/attribute1, PUT /jobtype1/1=\r\n234/attribute2), until it\nis ready for the server to process the job. There=\r\n is a predefined set of\nattributes of which the client is aware, so PUT is =\r\nacceptable.\n\nI am then considering whether the client should GET\n/jobtype1/=\r\n1234/result , at which point the server will hold the request\nopen and even=\r\ntually return the result along with 200 OK. Or whether the\nclient should PO=\r\nST to /jobtype1/results with the job number included in\nthe entity body. Th=\r\ne server would return 202 Accepted along with the\nresult URI (http://jobser=\r\nver/jobtype1/1234/result). The client would\nthen periodically GET the resul=\r\nt URI until successful.\n\nAny advice on this job result pattern would be gre=\r\natly appreciated.\n\nSecond, I am concerned that splitting jobtype1 and jobty=\r\npe2 into\ndifferent &#39;factory&#39; resources might be unnecessary and cause addit=\r\nional\nrepetition during coding, but I&#39;m not sure. Perhaps it would be bette=\r\nr\nto simply POST to a /job URI and include a POST parameter to indicate\nthe=\r\n job type?  The job types are functionally very similar, except that\nthey a=\r\nre stored differently on the server. However, in the business\ndomain, it is=\r\n *very* important that they are considered separate as\nthere are major impl=\r\nications to the fact that jobs of one type are\nallowed to be stored, wherea=\r\ns jobs of the second type must never be\nstored beyond the computation and d=\r\nelivery of results.\n\nThanks for reading over my questions, I really appreci=\r\nate it.\n\n\n\n"}}
