For exampl=\r\ne, an HTML form with a bunch of IDs presented in &lt;option&gt; elements in a sel=\r\nect control does not violate the hypermedia constraint. IOW, you need not p=\r\nut URIs in the options just to be RESTful.\n\nThis only works because your we=\r\nbsite behind the form knows how to map IDs from the &lt;option&gt; element to res=\r\nource URLs on it&#39;s backend REST API. When the user posts the form I assume =\r\nthe result is something like this:\n\n  POST /show-item.aspx?id=3D1234 HTTP/1=\r\n.1\n\nHow does the webserver know how to map &quot;1234&quot; into it&#39;s backend resourc=\r\ne http://rest.mysite.com/items/1234? \n\nYour website is certainly RESTful on=\r\n the user facing part. But it&#39;s interaction with the backend REST API is no=\r\nt.\n\nNotice that we don&#39;t have this issue when our backend is a database. In=\r\n that case there is a really tight coupling between the website and the DB =\r\n- the website know exactly how to fetch items from the DB using IDs only.\n\n=\r\n\n&gt; Likewise, it is ok to have a URI template like /users/{userId} if the li=\r\nnk relation defines the meaning of the userId param and if the client disco=\r\nvers user IDs in received representations.\n\nOkay, that might work. Lets exp=\r\nlore that solution. Assume we have a REST API for searching our items. The =\r\nsearch API has one official URL that lets us search items by name:\n\n  http:=\r\n//rest.mysite.com/items?name=3D{name}\n  \nThe search returns an ATOM feed wi=\r\nth found items (ATOM entries):\n\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Playstation&lt;/title&gt;\n\t&lt;=\r\nid&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n\t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/items/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;entry&gt;\n  \n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/title&gt;\n\t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n\t&lt;link=\r\n rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/olditems/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n  \nChec=\r\nk the &quot;self&quot; links. The resource format is not the same for the two items. =\r\nSo I cannot just grab the ID and render HTML anchors with them since the &quot;c=\r\nommodere 64&quot; link would be wrong.\n\nI want to render the search result as an=\r\n HTML list with links to my user facing web:\n\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D1234&quot;&gt;Playstation&lt;/a&gt;\n    =\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=\r\n=3D1234&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\nNotice how my two items sudden=\r\nly have the same user facing URL!\n\nNow lets add URL templates in the result=\r\n as you suggest. I do not know of such a thing, so I&#39;ll create my own:\n\n  &lt;=\r\nentry&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Playstation&lt;/title&gt;\n\t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n\t&lt;link-template rel=3D=\r\n&quot;self&quot; param=3D&quot;id&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/items/{id}&lt;/link&gt;\n\t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;=\r\nself&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/items/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n  \n  &lt;entry&gt;\n    &lt;=\r\ntitle&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/title&gt;\n\t&lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;\n\t&lt;link-template rel=3D&quot;self&quot; para=\r\nm=3D&quot;id&quot;&gt;http://rest.mysite.com/olditems/{id}&lt;/link&gt;\n\t&lt;link rel=3D&quot;self&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://rest.mysite.com/olditems/1234&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;entry&gt;\n\nNow, having this templ=\r\nate information, we can construct resource URLs our self. But to do so we m=\r\nust pass the template together with the ID, otherwise our display-item webp=\r\nage won&#39;t know how to generate the resource URL.\n\nSo the HTLM becomes:\n\n  &lt;=\r\nul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D=\r\n1234&template=3Dhttp://rest.mysite.com/items/{id}&quot;&gt;Playstation&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li=\r\n&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.mysite.com/display-item.aspx?id=3D12=\r\n34&template=3Dhttp://rest.mysite.com/olditems/{id}&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/=\r\nli&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\nThis works ... but I would rather just include the real resour=\r\nce URL instead of both the ID and the template.\n\nSo again I must conclude t=\r\nhat a consequence of using a REST backend, is that we must pass complete re=\r\nsource URLs around in our website URLs. Adhering stricly to a backend REST =\r\nAPI means loosing the ability to use short URLs in the user facing frontend=\r\n.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
