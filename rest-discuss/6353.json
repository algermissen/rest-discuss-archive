These are  \nappended to the page, the scroll bar is adjusted to reflect the new  \nheight of the page, and you can keep scrolling down for more. This is  \nin contrast to the traditional &quot;Page 2&quot; / &quot;See Next n Items&quot; method  \nof advancing the list.\n\nIt&#39;s quite anti-REST, but it got me thinking about how the  \ntraditional numbered-page method also breaks with REST. My feeling is  \nthat the URL should point to a consistent resource, which changes in  \na paged environment. Page 2 means one thing one day, something else  \non another, depending on what new items have been added to the list  \nin the meantime.\n\nI can think of two ways to change this:\n\nInstead of using page numbers, use item identifiers. The permanent  \nURL for a set of items wouldn&#39;t change.\n\nInstead of numbering from the most recent, number from the oldest.  \nPage 1 will always have the same set of oldest items, while the page  \nnumber for the newest items will grow indefinitely. Of course this  \nonly works if there is a clear beginning to things.\n\nThoughts?\n-mike.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nmichal migurski- contact info and pgp key:\nsf/ca            http://mike.teczno.com/contact.html\n\n\n\n\n"}}
