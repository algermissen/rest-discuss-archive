[1]\n&gt; \n&gt; Some questions keep bugging me:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Should all URIs a server makes known to clients be considered\n&gt;   possible bookmarks?\n&gt;   If not, how do I differentiate between those that are and those\n&gt;   that are not?\n\nThe more remain constant, the better.\n\nI would say:\n\n1. At a minimum, core discovery URIs (those from which you can find the\nrest) should remain constant. If it changes, then the old URI should\nredirect to the new (permanent or temporary as appropriate).\n\n2. If the &quot;object&quot; identified by a URI is removed, then 410 is\npreferable to 404 as this indicates that the reason the URI is not\nreturning an entity is that something that was once there was removed,\nwhile a 404 doesn&#39;t distinguish this from a bug, a client mistake, or\nthe service restructuring URI mappings.\n\n3. If a large-scale restructuring is done, or a new domain name used,\netc. then the more old URIs that redirect to the new for as long as\npossible, the better.\n\nAll that said, I think cool URIs can only be an ideal rather than a\nguarantee. Using discovery of URIs through HATEOS can mean that in the\nworse case of every single URI changing, a client need have only a\nsingle URI updated to return to being fully operational.\n\n\n"}}
