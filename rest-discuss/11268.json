However I interpret the\n&gt; spec as saying &quot;the request has been understood but I can&#39;t\n&gt; give you an answer&quot;. This does imply that you assign a uri to a\n&gt; resource that doesn&#39;t exist yet, but I don&#39;t have a fundamental\n&gt; problem with that.\n\nWhat the spec says about 202 is this:\n\n    The request has been accepted for processing, but the\n    processing has not been completed. The request might or might\n    not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when\n    processing actually takes place. There is no facility for\n    re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such\n    as this.\n\nI don’t understand how a GET can be “accepted for processing,”\nor how it can be “completed,” much less how a GET request “might\neventually be acted upon.” The text for 202 clearly applies to\nmethods that operate on resources – which GET (being safe and\nidempotent) by definition, purpose and intent does not.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
