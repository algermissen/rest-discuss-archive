Each URI returns a slightly different \n&gt; representation of the resource (e.g. additional data in RSS \n&gt; 2.0 that&#39;s not in RSS 0.92, etc.).  To some extent, I think \n&gt; this is okay, RESTfully speaking.  However, this brings into \n&gt; question the need for content negotiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; When should one technique be used above another?  When conneg \n&gt; is not an option, what is the best technique to use, and is \n&gt; that technique nothing but a kludge?\n\nIf I can rephrase this slightly, I have a similar question: is the\nquerystring (after the ? Character) part of the resource &quot;noun&quot; under REST?\n\nIn other words, given the following URL:\n\n\thttp://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&b=2\n\nIs the &quot;noun&quot; resource http://www.my-server.com/foo with parameters attached\nto the query, or is it http://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&b=2 ?\n\nIf it&#39;s the latter, then I assume this is considered a completely different\n&quot;noun&quot;?\n\n\thttp://www.my-server.com/foo?a=1&b=2&c=3\n\nBy my (admittedly limited) understanding of REST, the URL is simply an\naddress to a resource, and the server returns a representation of a\nresource. So which is the resource in the first URL above?\n\nThanks,\n-dave\n\n"}}
