I absolutely think it would be cool if my browser had a button\nthat said: &quot;WATCH this URL.&quot; It would authenticate me (just as for PUT)\nand then watch it.\n\nTherefore I&#39;d propose that we view it as a convention layered on top of\nexisting methods in the short term with a transition to a WATCH method\nin the long (perhaps very long) term.\n\nJeff Bone wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; (1)  It doesn&#39;t make sense for all resources to support subscriptions;  the naive\n&gt; behavior --- send me the entire new state anytime the resource changes --- doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make sense for all resources, particularly ones that change with high frequency.\n&gt; More sophisticated cases --- such as &quot;send me only the changed state&quot; --- probably\n&gt; cannot be defined generically for all (or even many) application domains and\n&gt; modeled resources.\n\nHmmm. It seems like sometimes you want a notification that a change has\nhappened, sometimes you want a notification that embeds the changed\nobject and sometimes you want a diff. I think that the first case\napplies pretty efficiently and generally to all objects everywhere.\n\nMaybe we should only ever send URLs, not representations, in\nnotifications. The client can easily do a GET if it wants the data, and\nsome kind of &quot;GET the difference&quot; if it knows how to do that. \n\n&gt; (2)  Supporting subscriptions for a substantial portion of resources hosted by a\n&gt; particular domain has costs which may not be justified for a given service /\n&gt; application.\n\nThe same goes for supporting PUT! That&#39;s why most web sites don&#39;t\nsupport PUT!\n\n&gt; (3)  Recognizing (1) and preventing (2) would require a kind of fine-grained,\n&gt; per-resource configuration to allow or disallow WATCH behavior. \n\nDoesn&#39;t seem much different than PUT to me.\n\n&gt; (4)  Adding new methods to HTTP requires changes to many different server\n&gt; implementations, firewall implementations, etc.  This has a very high cost in\n&gt; terms of delaying the propagation and limiting the reach of the new functionality\n&gt; in question.\n\nGranted.\n\n&gt; (5)  It&#39;s not clear at all that a new method is required in order to preserve the\n&gt; end-to-end semantics of HTTP.  For example, you could simply model the list of\n&gt; subscriptions to a given resource as a sub-URL of the resource, i.e.\n\nI like the idea of reifying subscriptions but see it as complementary to\na new HTTP method. The method would return the subscription URI in its\nLocation: header.\n\n&gt;    POST /some/resource/subscriptions?reply-to=http://foo.com/notices/1\n&gt;    POST /other/resource/subscriptions?reply-to=http://foo.com/notices/2\n\nIt&#39;s arguable whether the client should have to create a separate\nend-point if they want separate subscriptions. Might not it make sense\nto have dozens of service with an endpoint of mailto:email@...?\n\n"}}
