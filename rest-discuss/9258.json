What you end up\n&gt; doing is creating one single application that spans multiple\n&gt; machines, sharing code as well as data across them, and hoping\n&gt; your dist-object framework of choice can handle distributed GC\n&gt; with some bounded reliability.\n\nIf you can, somehow, guarantee that most of the fallacies of\ndistributed computing actually hold in a particular situation,\nthen you can indeed write a “distributed” system as if it were\nrunning on a single machine. Because then it *is* running on a\nsingle machine, albeit an unusual one. It’s not really any more\ndistributed than code running in an SMP system is, and the\nplatform requires similar engineering effort and cost as building\na hardware fault tolerant large-scale SMP machine.\n\n&gt; What they dont do is scale to the long haul, or across versions\n&gt; and applications\n\nYeah – implicit in my statement was a trailing “on the web.”\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
