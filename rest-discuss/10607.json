List of two links to two stories the child \nhas written.\n/story1.html -&gt; &quot;What I did during the summer&quot;. Links back to /index.html.\n/story2.html -&gt; &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;. What a precocious \nchild! Links back to /index.html\n\nSo. Without any links from these three pages to the outside world, we \nhave three states we can have the client in:\n\n1. Displaying /index.html\n2. Displaying /story1.html\n3. Displaying /story2.html\n\nWe can move from state 1 to state 2 or 3 and from state 2 or 3 to state \n1. The change in application state happens due to links.\n\nThe above is so simple that we&#39;re unlikely to think of it as an \napplication, but it is still an application, and still representative of \nthe principle of how hypermedia is the engine of much more complicated \napplications.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t do anything which alters the state of the server, but if we \nadd a guestbook then we&#39;ve just added 2 more states (viewing guestbook \nand adding guestbook entry) and a way to change the nature of one of \nthose states (viewing guestbook).\n\nThe way links change the state of a client looking at such a \nmy-first-website application is exactly how they do so on a rich \ninteractive updateable web application or web service.\n\n"}}
