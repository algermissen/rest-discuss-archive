Anyhow, here is the\n&gt; original proposal:\n\nGood point.  So you&#39;ve argued me back to my original position, which you didn&#39;t\nseem to agree with. ;-)  Notifications MUST include a validator.  Note that a\nnotification is however a request, so actually using the etag or last-modified\nheader is probably inappropriate;  we probably need a notification-specific\nversion of these things.\n\n&gt; (4) It might be useful to require an appropriate validator\n&gt; (entity tag or last-modified header) in every notification.  In a\n&gt; sense, clients are simply caches for particular representations,\n&gt; and the HttpEvents &quot;protocol&quot; is just a push-based cache\n&gt; invalidation protocol.  We should reuse the appropriate pieces of\n&gt; HTTP in this capacity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe you can go into more detail about why this is important for\n&gt; clients, servers, intermediaries, how you expect it to be used etc. so\n&gt; we can figure out how important it is.\n\nConsider that a subscriber is really in a sense a cache for the subscribed\nresource.  This cache supports a &quot;standard&quot; HTTP-based interface (the Subscriber\ninterface) allowing subscribable resources to pre-emptively notify the cache of\nchanges and thereby invalidate cached entities.  Given this, it seems useful to\ninclude data in a notification which the cache / subscriber can check against\nsimilar data for its cached representation to determine whether to proceed with\nrefreshing it.\n\nUsing such information would permit caches to avoid extraneous GET / refresh\noperations.  Consider:  notification to a list of subscribers is likely to take\ntime.  A subscribed resource changes.  During the notification process but\nbefore a particular subscriber is notified, that subscriber does a GET and\nobtains the current representational state.  They then receive a notification\nthat the state is changed, but in fact they have the current and correct state.\nA mandatory validator in the notification would allow the subscriber to check\nits cached copy and determine that a GET was unnecessary at that point.\n\nThis is important for servers because it lightens the GET load when things\nchange;  it&#39;s important both for servers and traditional proxy caches as it can\npotentially significantly reduce the burden of keeping the cache fresh.  It&#39;s\nimportant to clients because, as mentioned, clients are conceptually nothing\nmore than specialized caches;  the benefits to proxies apply as well to clients.\n\nDoes that help, or was it clear as mud? ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
