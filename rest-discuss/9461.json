Resource containment\n&gt; means, amoungst other things, that the lifecycle of the resources are\n&gt; such that if the containing resource goes away, so does the contained\n&gt; resource.  So if you got rid of the author, do her books vanish?\n&gt; Nope, so that&#39;s not containment.  But if you got rid of a book, then\n&gt; its chapters and pages go with it.  That is containment.\n\nWell, in the example the &quot;author&quot; really just means &quot;a collection of\none or more books by the same person.&quot; And we don&#39;t have multi-author\nworks or complications like that. Work with me, here. Er, actually,\nzero or more books, now that I think about it.\n\nBut yes, if you got rid of an &quot;author,&quot; that means getting rid of all\nthe books (and chapters, and pages) by that author. (Whether a delete\ncascade like that is permissible, or whether you serve a 4xx for a\nnon-empty author depends on what the chances of accidental deletion\nare, and what the consequences of doing so are, I imagine.)\n\nPatrick&#39;s Atom feed bit is actually a pretty good example, and I would\nhave used it except I was afraid we&#39;d get off in the weeds since I\ndon&#39;t know the spec that well. Other than that, it&#39;s a useful\nquestion, if I generalize it to &quot;a RESTful blog site&quot; and don&#39;t\nspecify what format the feeds are in. Well, I suppose I could say\n&quot;RSS&quot; without specifying a flavor, and then no one could pin me down\non syntax...\n\nSo okay, suppose the hierarchy is category/blog/label/thread/entry,\nwhere one &quot;entry&quot; in a thread is the blog post and the rest are\ncomments. And where &quot;label&quot; is one of those subcategory sorts of\nthings, not a tag that entries can have none or a dozen of. Deleting a\nblog requires deleting its labels, deleting a label requires deleting\nits threads, deleting a thread requires deleting its entries. (What\nyou probably DON&#39;T want to get into is accepting PUTs.\nCategory-for-its-own-sake is a different resource, because having to\nknow and PUT every blog, label, thread, and entry within one just to\nchange a spelling mistake in its description is a bit over the top...)\n\nSo given that example, suppose the reader wants to see the most recent\n25 entries in a *category*... what ought that resource look like,\nroughly? Is it a special type of entry resource like\nhttp://blogsite/entry?catname=categoryiwant or a special form of the\ncategory resource like http://blogsite/category/catname?entries=full\nor something else entirely?\n\nOr maybe it&#39;s a special type of thread since thread already is a\nmulti-entry type of resource? That starts to sound like a &quot;something\nelse entirely,&quot; since it may share syntax with &quot;thread&quot; but it\ncertainly isn&#39;t semantically a thread.\n\n"}}
