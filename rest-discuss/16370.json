If I use XMl or JSON in a particular manner, I would be\n&gt; tempted to say &quot;application/xml+foo&quot; or &quot;application/json+foo&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nI think you meant /foo+xml or /foo+json.  As I&#39;ve pointed out many\ntimes before, there is no extensibility defined for application/json\nlike there is for application/xml -- without first changing the JSON\nmedia type identifier document to allow for it, /foo+json is non\nsequitir -- you _can&#39;t_ register it.\n\nSince application/*+json isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be defined, why would there be\nany expectation that caches won&#39;t just ignore it?\n\nYou also can&#39;t go about minting application/foo+xml, because that\nidentifier string indicates the &#39;standards tree&#39;, i.e. &#39;foo&#39; must refer\nto some IETF RFC.  You can register application/vnd.foo+xml and,\nprovided nobody else has registered it, you&#39;re good to go.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet, this - you say - shouldn&#39;t be done if we are using any part of\n&gt; the Internet. But is the meaningless &quot;application/xml&quot; (or .../json)\n&gt; the only alternative I have then?\n&gt; \n\nI didn&#39;t say it shouldn&#39;t be done; I said it&#39;s a REST mismatch if you\ndo.  The application/xml media type identifier isn&#39;t meaningless; it\nmeans the payload is some random XML with a schema, and indicates that\nlinks take the form of rdf:about, XLink, or XInclude.  When this\ncondition evaluates to true, I use application/xml.\n\nIf I need to send a payload that&#39;s an annotated list of links which may\nbe loaded into a browser as bookmarks, the first thing I do is choose a\nmedia type that&#39;s meant for such a task -- XBEL.  Now, I just need to\nfigure out what media type identifier to send -- application/xml being\na horrible choice, because it doesn&#39;t tell anyone that the payload is a\nhierarchical collection of annotated links as &lt;bookmark href=&#39;{URL}&#39;&gt;.\n\nTo do that requires the minting of a new media type identifier, which\nannounces to the world that the payload has a root element of &lt;folder&gt;\nand that links take the form of nested &lt;bookmark href=&#39;{URL}&#39;&gt; elements.\nSo I&#39;m sending application/xbel+xml, but since that isn&#39;t registered it\ncannot be said to meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint.  The\nREST mismatch will clear when I follow up on registering the identifier.\n\nIf I need to send a payload that&#39;s an associative array of integers, I\nuse application/json to let the whole world know that the numeric\nstrings contained in the payload (which lack decimal points) are to be\nevaluated as integers.  If JSON is being used properly, there&#39;s no need\nfor any subtypes -- at the protocol layer we just don&#39;t care about the\nnature of the payload beyond how to decode it.  Media type identifiers\nshouldn&#39;t define the meaning of the payload, doing so introduces tight\ncoupling that REST is meant to avoid.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Likewise, there is the whole concept using media types, rather than\n&gt; URIs for versioning. I guess that&#39;s not allowed then either?\n&gt; \n\nThe whole concept of versioning is antithetical to REST, via URI or\nmedia type identifier.  If the codec changes, then the media type\nidentifier needs to be changed, not versioned.  If the codec doesn&#39;t\nchange, neither should the media type.
