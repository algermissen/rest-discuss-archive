However, nobody is advocating\nthis and nobody has suggested that in this context either.\n\nI think more often - when people are talking about a custom media type -\nthey mean something like XML-plus-links or JSON-plus-links. You might\nsay &quot;just use HTML then&quot;, but that&#39;s exactly where we should be\ndiscussing pros and cons on a technical level, hopefully without\ndismissing the non-HTML approach as non-RESTful, now that we all know\nthat it still keeps application flow in hypertext.\n\nGranted, the big issue is that the &#39;JSON-plus-links&#39; or &#39;XML-plus-links&#39;\ntype is not standardized. But as far as I can tell, an application using\nthose can be fully RESTful in all other aspects.\n\n\nHere&#39;s another thought: When we are talking about &#39;scalability&#39;, I\nalways envision that there are two types of scalability: The technical\none (having to do with caches and performance and such) and the\nscalability that concerns itself with acceptance through clients and\nusers (uptake, adoption, popularity, etc.).\n\nNow, I go out on a limb here and claim that if you offer an API to an\napplication, where (depending on the &#39;Accept&#39; header) stuff is either\nreturned in HTML+RDF (fully standardized) or in JSON+links (not\nstandardized), the majority of users will choose the latter. Why?\nBecause it&#39;s just so very easy to deal with this style and many\nlanguages require zero additional libraries to do so. The JSON+links\nstyle of the API will &#39;scale&#39; better, since it&#39;s actually going to be\nused. Therefore, I don&#39;t believe you can dismiss ease of use. In fact, I\nthink it is a big part of the scalability story of REST.\n\nJuergen\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nMuleSoft\n\n\n"}}
