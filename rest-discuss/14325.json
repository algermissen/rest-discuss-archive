Currently, by virtue of Xforms 1.1  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; allowing\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I must say that this is an extreme interpretation. You are implying  \n&gt;&gt; that any hint of non-standardness makes an app unRESTful. Not even  \n&gt;&gt; the underlying standards of the web require such strict adherence.\n&gt;\n&gt; I second that.\n\n+1\n\nBesides - what is a standard anyway? IETF? OASIS? W3C? Google? What  \nmatters is that the hypermedia semantics used are properly specified  \nand made available on the Web so clients can &quot;follow their nose&quot;.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Quoting from one of Roy&#39;s posts [1]:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I should also note that the above is not yet fully RESTful, at  \n&gt; least how I use the term. All I have done is described the service  \n&gt; interfaces, which is no more than any RPC. In order to make it  \n&gt; RESTful, I would need to add hypertext to introduce and define the  \n&gt; service, describe how to perform the mapping using forms and/or link  \n&gt; templates, and provide code to combine the visualizations in useful  \n&gt; ways. I could even go further and define these relationships as a  \n&gt; standard, much like Atom has standardized a normal set of HTTP  \n&gt; relationships with expected semantics, but I have bigger fish to fry  \n&gt; right now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems to me that even Roy believes standardization is a desired, but  \n&gt; not mandatory, property of RESTful systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Besides being questionable, such an interpretation is not very  \n&gt;&gt; useful. What is the end goal here? Striving to ensure that an app  \n&gt;&gt; meet this interpretation, or is it to deliver something of value to  \n&gt;&gt; the stakeholders? If providing value to the stakeholders requires  \n&gt;&gt; use of *everything* standard, then that is what should guide an  \n&gt;&gt; implementation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
