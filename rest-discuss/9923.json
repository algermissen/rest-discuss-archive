It&#39;s the cookie (to be used only in the XHR\n&gt; &gt; &#39;personalizing&quot; request) that handles identity (and NOT as\n&gt; &gt; part of the page request). Requesting the page URI returns\n&gt; &gt; the exact same resource no matter who the user is (and thus\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s cacheable). It&#39;s the CLIENT that &quot;decides&quot; if it wants\n&gt; &gt; to take the next step and personalize the page by firing an\n&gt; &gt; XHR.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a fuzzy issue here of just what exactly constitutes a\n&gt; resource.\n\nThat’s why resources and representations are not the same thing.\nThe line is not fuzzy, it’s completely arbitrary. REST itself is\nno guide to where to draw it; the usefulness of the resulting\nsystem is what will dictate the definition of a resource.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s a line beyond which sufficient client personalization\n&gt; has created a new resource, and such a resource should have its\n&gt; own URL.\n\nShould it? Depends. This is just like the question of how to\nhandle a document available in multiple languages. Do you use\ncontent negotiation or put each version behind an explicit URI?\nDoing the latter is not a magical fix-all solution. Both ways of\ngoing about it have their upsides and downsides and need to be\nweighed in context. And sometimes you’ll want to do some kind of\nmixture of both.\n\nF.ex., in an e-shop site, I would ask: if a user bookmarks a\nproduct page, or emails it to someone, what is it that they\nexpect to point the other person to? Is the fact that the page\nhad &lt;a href=&quot;/user/23831&quot;&gt;My account&lt;/a&gt; at the top relevant at\nthe time of the emailed link being clicked? Well, probably not.\n\nPart of this all is that there is no universal way for anyone but\nthe origin server to know with certainty that two URIs identify\nthe same resource. If 30 people bookmark my e-shop’s product page\nfor caffeinated soap on del.icio.us, I’d want all their URIs to\nbe identical so that their commentary on the product is grouped\ntogether as it should be. People could also find further\ncommentary from various people around the web by searching for\nlink:www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/accessories/5a65/ in Google.\n\nIf you mint too many URIs, then this identifiability gets lost.\nThink rdf:about. You want canonical URIs for as many *different*\nthings as possible, but you also want to avoid duplicate URIs for\nthe *same one thing* as much as possible.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
