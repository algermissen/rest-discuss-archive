Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We should be proliferating mimetypes.\n&gt; &gt; Their purpose is to represent different document\n&gt; &gt; expectations.\n&gt; &gt; We should use them that way!\n&gt;\n&gt; That would be nice, but the practice seems somewhat different than theory\n&gt; here.\n&gt;\n&gt; For instance, there is no way for a server to know which version of HTML to\n&gt; return based on the content-type.  Should the HTML be strictly 3.2 or should\n&gt; it be 4.0?  Using &quot;text/html&quot; is not enough.  Using the user-agent (which is\n&gt; probably the most common technique) it just plain wrong.  A server can&#39;t\n&gt; possibly know every user-agent out there and shouldn&#39;t even care.  To avoid\n&gt; this, sites are left to tactics like home pages that have a low-end home\n&gt; page with links to the rest of the site in different version.  Hardly a good\n&gt; solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; The same could be said for distinguishing between RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, and\n&gt; 2.0 (along with any other generic xml) since all that&#39;s used is &quot;text/xml&quot;.\n&gt; Using &quot;text/rss+xml&quot; wouldn&#39;t be enough either.  In my blog system, if it\n&gt; gets &quot;Accept:text/xml&quot;, it return RSS 2.0.  In order to get any other\n&gt; version, you have to resort to a kludge (in this case using a query string\n&gt; indicating the specific version).  This is just plain wrong and should not\n&gt; be how it has to be done...\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, maybe if people got into the habit of using a &quot;version&quot; parameter in\n&gt; mime types, this could be avoided(?).  For instance, it would be no problem\n&gt; to determine what a request means by &quot;Accept:text/rss+xml;version=0.92&quot;.  I\n&gt; realize you could just register something like &quot;text/rss092+xml&quot;, but the\n&gt; parameter is somewhat extensible without the need to register each new\n&gt; version.  As is done with the xhtml &quot;profile&quot; parameter, it may even make\n&gt; sense to use a URI instead of a simple version number.  This obviously has\n&gt; tradeoffs, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
