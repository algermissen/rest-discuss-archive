It&#39;s a thesis\n&gt; written under time pressure and other constraints and I&#39;m not a\n&gt; writer.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ll take a look at your work, as I&#39;ve been meaning to look into\nOpenSocial anyway, vis-a-vis REST of course.  But I can&#39;t make any\npromises to cut any slack on writing quality.  Don&#39;t take it\npersonally, but I&#39;m comprehending less and less of the &quot;academic&quot;\npapers I&#39;m asked to review, due to writing and document structure that\nwouldn&#39;t have made it out of High School in my day, and this is from\nhonors students.\n\nI blame both the deteriorating state of education, and SMS.  I&#39;ve read\nplenty of theses over the years, they were all written under time\npressure and the constraints of living life, but in recent years the\nwriting quality has just gotten deplorable to the point that it isn&#39;t\njust bad writing, but incomprehensible to I guess everyone but the\nteachers and professors who let it slide.  It isn&#39;t part of the\nstandardized testing, so it can&#39;t be all that important, seems to be\nthe student attitude we&#39;ve created.\n\n/rant\n\nSince you warned me and asked nicely, I&#39;ll do my best to take the\nattitude that you&#39;ve been shortchanged by the system and behave myself,\nunless I find something&#39;s really confusing.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
