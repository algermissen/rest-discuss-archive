That\n&gt; URI is perfectly fine, even if what you GET from it differs depending\n&gt; upon who invoked GET, the time of day, etc..  To say otherwise is\n&gt; to prevent me from identifying a whole class of useful resources,\n&gt; such as &quot;The person to my right&quot;, &quot;The colour of the next traffic\n&gt; light up ahead&quot;, etc..\n\nIt is not the URI on its own that I am arguing against. It is the\nabsence of the user-specific resource URI that I am arguing\nagainst. I am arguing against using HTTP Auth as a resource\nidentification supplement. The example URL is an example of a URL\nthat requires supplemental resource identification information in\norder to provide any function.\n\nAn application may very well provide container URLs, in addition\nto user-specific URLs, and be RESTful. It is the absence of the\nuser-specific URLs that is RESTless.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
