I do have a couple of minor comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; [15] Fact: POST is insufficiently defined\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t make that claim.  Rather, much of the activity done today via\n&gt; POST would have much greater advantage if it instead used one of the more\n&gt; constrained methods.  However, POST as a kind of &quot;process this&quot; catchall\n&gt; method has great value when used well -- especially for well-defined\n&gt; protocols resting (ha ha) on top of HTTP.  AtomPub makes one very good and\n&gt; well-defined use of POST, and a future HTTP extension or application may\n&gt; make another.  POST&#39;s relatively open specification is what allows this\n&gt; growth.\n&gt;\n&gt; [29] Fact: access control precludes scalability\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m with Stefan and Bill in disagreement on this one.  This is only true if\n&gt; your access control method scales poorly, and at that point is equivalent to\n&gt; saying &quot;poorly-scaling systems scale poorly&quot;.  There is nothing essential to\n&gt; access control that makes this true.  Many systems happen to implement\n&gt; access control in a centralized way, but these implementations do not\n&gt; reflect any true general fact.\n&gt;\n&gt; Enjoy giving the talk.  I&#39;m interested to hear how it goes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best,\n&gt;\n&gt; -Justin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
