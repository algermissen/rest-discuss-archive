If it can, and it issues an Accept header, then surely that type\n&gt; will be in the Accept header anyway.\n&gt;   \n\nThe media type preference of a particular request could be significant \nin application flow e.g:\n\n&lt;a type=&#39;application/xml&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in xml&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a type=&#39;application/json&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in json&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWithout specifying the appropriate Accept header for each request, the \nsame representation will be returned.\n\n&gt; If you want to distinctly identify two documents separately, you give them two URIs.If the difference between the two representations don&#39;t matter to the client (aka there is no significant semantic difference between the two formats), then two representations can be served as conneg&#39;d resources.\n&gt;   \n\nWhy do you want to give two *representations* of one resource, two \nseparate *resource* identifiers?\n\nOne answer to that might be that you need to link explicitly to them and \nthere&#39;s currently no way to indicate the necessary control data with \n(HTML) hyperlinks. That is true, and is the reason I brought this up.\n\nWhat are the other reasons you have for violating the distinction \nbetween resource and representation?\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
