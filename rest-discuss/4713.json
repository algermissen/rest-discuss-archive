It is a perfect example of how to put &#39;API&#39;\nsemantics into the message instead of implicitly extending the semantics\nof the uniform interface. So easy to grasp if I look at your example,\nbut I did not understand that so clearly before. Thanks for this!\n\nI think that also illustrates the recent QUERY-as-POST+201 discussion,\nespecially Mark&#39;s point that the assumption that the 201 addresses\nthe query result would be an extension of the uniform POST semantics.\n\n\n&gt; But there&#39;s a really important question to answer between these two:\n&gt; where does the intelligence about how the queue should be interacted\n&gt; with reside?  Do all clients know the semantics [GET/DELETE pairs, 409\n&gt; response code, &c.] for interacting with this particular implementation\n&gt; of a queue?  Or does the server publish how it wants relatively stupid\n&gt; clients to interact with it [both the server and the queue]?\n\nThe latter I think. If you understand the queue as a (RESTful) application\nthrough which&#39;s states the user agent proceeds then the representation should\ncontain the links that may be invoked to reach possible next states. Conneg\ncan be used to negotiate the appropriate representation mime type (the one\nthe client says it understands).\n\nVery insightful posting (at least for me) - thanks.\n\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; And what&#39;s in the middle, trading off being very expliclit and\n&gt; server-directed for performance, while still retaining some of the nice\n&gt; effects of REST&#39;s principles?\n&gt; \n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
