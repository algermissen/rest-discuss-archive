Getting the \n&gt;properties is easy. Putting them individually is easy but broken.\n&gt;\n&gt;Do I POST to the parent resource and use multipart MIME to embed the \n&gt;update info for all three properties as three conceptually separate \n&gt;xml docs?\n&gt;\n&gt;--Daniel Hardman\n&gt;Advisory Engineer, Symantec Corporation\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
