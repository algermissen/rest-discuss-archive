Also, I really doubt that more verbose explanations help\n&gt;&gt;  in understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably a good example. How to find the language to balance\n&gt; precision (exactitude?) with clarity.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I&#39;d support Nic&#39;s position that lots of smaller, clear examples\n&gt; would help back up explanations. PIcking the right ones is the\n&gt; challenge.\n\nWhich is why you need editorial input.\n\nAnd why the wiki is a good place to collect stuff.\n\nBut the wiki seems to have fallen into disuse.\n\nI tried it this eve. and it&#39;s very slow.
