The\n&gt; audience was of mixed ability, from old time hackers to complete\n&gt; newbies in web development.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a very short summary of audience reaction and my thoughts\n&gt; about it. I hope it&#39;s useful.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The reaction of most was to question whether I was talking about\n&gt; anything clever, to question the validity of REST because of it&#39;s\n&gt; simplicity. The more experience programmers (who have topyed with\n&gt; SOAP and XMLRPC) were more enthusisatic.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s clear that many people don&#39;t really understand HTTP. REST\n&gt; evangelists need to do more to explain HTTP to people.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I expected some confusion and incredulity about the stuff about\n&gt; sessions and I got some. Again, the more experienced were more\n&gt; inclined to listen to the REST p-o-v. But the prevaliing view about\n&gt; sessions was &quot;go tell the marketing dept&quot; because this company does\n&gt; quite a lot of personalization based on cookies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So, in summary, the talk was pretty succesful. My only doubt is how\n&gt; much I should push the sessions issue. I&#39;m still not clear myself\n&gt; about that.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
