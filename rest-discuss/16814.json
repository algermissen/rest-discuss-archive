Most of the REST\nliterature leaves these folks with the impression that REST is so\ncomplex that it can&#39;t be done without benefit of a framework, but this\nis not the case, and often leads to the simplest of concepts becoming\ncomplicated beyond reason (not to mention missing the point of REST).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
