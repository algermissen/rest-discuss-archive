Wahbe about the topic of whether it&#39;s even pos=\r\nsible to create a\n&gt; hypermedia format without knowledge of the client.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; More specifically, the concern was that whatever hypermedia\n&gt; format =\r\nyou come up with would &#39;bind&#39; the client to that server: It&#39;s\n&gt; difficult t=\r\no have a generic client, since instead you end up with\n&gt; clients that have =\r\nto have specific knowledge about the particular\n&gt; hypermedia format you use=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is natural (and ok). User agents provide the interaction\n=\r\n&gt; point between users and the application. They do this by\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - exposing=\r\n information (e.g. render the content of &lt;title&gt;\n&gt; element in\n&gt;&gt; the browse=\r\nr window head or store the result of a link check run for\n&gt;&gt; a site in a da=\r\ntabase or file)\n&gt;&gt; - performing automatic transitions (e.g. GET an HTML inl=\r\nine image\n&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; recursively traverse links of a site for validation)\n&gt;&gt; -=\r\n provide a means for the user to activate hypermedia controls\n&gt;&gt; (e.g. make=\r\n links found in a page clickable, display forms)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Doing all this requi=\r\nres in-depth knowledge of the media type and\n&gt; coding for all this requires=\r\n in-depth, hard coded knowledge about the\n&gt; expected media types.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It =\r\nis simply ok that browsers implement HTML and that AtomPub\n&gt; clients implem=\r\nent the AtomPub media types. It is also ok that Google&#39;s\n&gt; indexed likely u=\r\nnderstands all media types it knows to be in use on the\n&gt; Web.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, b=\r\nut remember that the context here is that the hypermedia format is\n&gt; design=\r\ned without knowledge of what the client does. So in the case of\n&gt; HTML, the=\r\n client can do all the things you mention quite easily because\n&gt; HTML is ex=\r\nplicitly designed for them -- well explicitly for the browser\n&gt; examples li=\r\nke &lt;title&gt; and perhaps implicitly for the spider\n&gt; examples by virtue of HT=\r\nML following the Principle of Least Power. In\n&gt; short -- HTML was designed =\r\naround a client domain (interactive\n&gt; information presentation).\n&gt;\n&gt; If the=\r\n hypermedia format was not designed around the client domain,\n&gt; then the cl=\r\nient would be tasked with mapping the data to its domain\n&gt; (which may not e=\r\nven be feasible). Also, the client would be bound to\n&gt; that domain -- restr=\r\nicting it from doing other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, if Amazon designed it&#39;s=\r\n hypermedia format before browser&#39;s\n&gt; and HTML existed it would likely revo=\r\nlve around buying books and other\n&gt; items. It would likely be impossible to=\r\n express something like Facebook\n&gt; in this language - you&#39;d need some new f=\r\normat. An &quot;Amazon browser&quot;\n&gt; would not be able to interact with Facebook an=\r\nd vice versa, even though\n&gt; the client domain (again interactive informatio=\r\nn presentation) was the\n&gt; same.\n&gt;\n&gt; And before anyones says anything about =\r\nthis having to do anything with\n&gt; the user guiding the browser let me addre=\r\nss this. CCXML is an example\n&gt; of a hypermedia language that does not drive=\r\n clients with UIs. CCXML\n&gt; drives a call control platform that among other =\r\nthings, accepts, places\n&gt; and connects phone calls. It can be used for many=\r\n applications -- for\n&gt; example you could create a Google-Voice-like applica=\r\ntion that looks at\n&gt; the number dialed and calls multiple phone numbers all=\r\nowing you to have\n&gt; one phone number that rings your cell and your deskphon=\r\ne.\n&gt; Alternatively, a call center application might look at the number of\n&gt;=\r\n the caller, figure out who they are whether they are a &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;\n&gt; =\r\nor &quot;bronze&quot; customer (via a DB lookup) and connect them to the right\n&gt; agen=\r\nts for that customer pool. So the key difference is that in the\n&gt; first exa=\r\nmple we route based on number dialed and in the second based\n&gt; on the calle=\r\nr&#39;s number -- but the finer details of the apps can be\n&gt; quite different. B=\r\necause CCXML is designed around what the raw\n&gt; telephony capabilities of th=\r\ne client and not the applications, the same\n&gt; hypermedia format and clients=\r\n can be used for both types of\n&gt; applications.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it seems that you can=\r\n get a &quot;broader\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \n\n*Disclai=\r\nmer: The opinions expressed herein are just my opinions and only by\nchance =\r\nthey are right.*\n\n&lt;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_1aTCd17_nho/TEblN4fV-_I/AAAAAAAAAH=\r\nw/wZ51kXrfJcs/qrcode_bc_1.jpg&gt;\nPlease click on the image to enlarge\nit&lt;http=\r\n://lh3.ggpht.com/_1aTCd17_nho/TEblN4fV-_I/AAAAAAAAAHw/wZ51kXrfJcs/qrcode_bc=\r\n_1.jpg&gt;\n\n"}}
