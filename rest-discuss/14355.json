Quoting from one of Roy&#39;s posts [1]:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;I shoul=\r\nd also note that the above is not yet fully RESTful, at least\n&gt;&gt; how I use =\r\nthe term. All I have done is described the service\n&gt;&gt; interfaces, which is =\r\nno more than any RPC. In order to make it\n&gt;&gt; RESTful, I would need to add h=\r\nypertext to introduce and define the\n&gt;&gt; service, describe how to perform th=\r\ne mapping using forms and/or link\n&gt;&gt; templates, and provide code to combine=\r\n the visualizations in useful\n&gt;&gt; ways. I could even go further and define t=\r\nhese relationships as a\n&gt;&gt; standard, much like Atom has standardized a norm=\r\nal set of HTTP\n&gt;&gt; relationships with expected semantics, but I have bigger =\r\nfish to fry\n&gt;&gt; right now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Seems to me that even Roy believes standa=\r\nrdization is a desired, but\n&gt;&gt; not mandatory, property of RESTful systems.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My interpretation of that post is quite different from yours.  Roy=\r\n\n&gt; describes how to implement a sparse-bit array, as a representation of a\n=\r\n&gt; standard media type like image/gif or image/png.  The problem is, there\n&gt;=\r\n is no hypertext, and the media types don&#39;t support methods other than\n&gt; GE=\r\nT.  The solution is to wrap these images within Atom, but Roy is\n&gt; hardly g=\r\noing to spend the time working on someone else&#39;s problem by\n&gt; fleshing his =\r\nexample out to be RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see no support for your statement that Ro=\r\ny doesn&#39;t see\n&gt; standardization as mandatory, since the gist of his entire =\r\nsolution is\n&gt; to use standard media types and link relations which encompas=\r\ns the\n&gt; expected semantics of HTTP methods.\n\nI interpreted what he wrote to=\r\n mean that his solution would be RESTful if he&#39;d added &quot;hypertext to introd=\r\nuce and define the service, describe how to perform the mapping using forms=\r\n and/or link templates, and provide code to combine the visualizations in u=\r\nseful&quot;. Standardizing this would mean &quot;even going further&quot;.\n\nI understand y=\r\nour viewpoint to be that anything not publicly standardized (i.e. a custom =\r\nlink relation, or media type, or verb) is by definition not RESTful. I don&#39;=\r\nt think so, but of course I may be wrong - in my view, you can standardize =\r\ne.g. within your company or some other domain. Probably we need Roy to prov=\r\nide an authoritative answer.\n\nStefan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n\n\n"}}
