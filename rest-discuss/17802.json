Yet there are articles (eg \nRickard Oberg&#39;s javalobby article [1]) that seem to argue otherwise?\n\nDan\n\n[1] http://java.dzone.com/articles/domain-model-rest-anti-pattern\n\n\n\nOn 27/09/2011 21:39, mike amundsen wrote:\n&gt; To better support evolability over time, REST-style implementations\n&gt; rely on the media type as the only &quot;shared understanding&quot; between\n&gt; client and server. Clients do not rely on a list of procedures (RPC),\n&gt; an object-graph (OO), or a list of fixed URIs, etc. in order to make\n&gt; requests and process results. Clients are &quot;bound&quot; not to the object\n&gt; model, view, etc, but to the media type and the hypermedia elements\n&gt; (links and forms, etc.) within that media type definition.\n&gt;\n&gt; This binding to the hypermedia controls within a media type means\n&gt; changes on the server in the RPC list, object model, URIs used to\n&gt; expose functionality, etc. will have no &quot;breaking effect&quot; on the\n&gt; client (since the client only cares about the hypermedia controls\n&gt; themselves). And that means the two parties and independently evolve\n&gt; over time (use new procedure lists, add/remove object models, etc.)\n&gt; w/o running the risk of &quot;breaking&quot; each other (as long as it is the\n&gt; hypermedia controls that are used as &quot;shared understanding&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; For this reason, what is represented by a response *does* matter, but\n&gt; not in ways traditionally understood by &quot;local&quot; programming models\n&gt; (RPC, OO, etc.). What is represented is that _state_ of the app, not\n&gt; the programming style (OO, etc.) of the server implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully that makes some sense&lt;g&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://twitter.com@mamund\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Sep 26, 2011 at 02:57, danhaywood@...\n&gt; &lt;dan@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt; ... or doesn&#39;t it matter?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The consensus would seem to be to for the former (use cases + view models).  On the other hand, all representations have a media type, the point of which is to allow the client and server to evolve independently.  That being the case, why does it matter what is being represented?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; Dan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
