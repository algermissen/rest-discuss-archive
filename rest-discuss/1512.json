That&#39;s a performance concern.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I&#39;m getting a little lost in the discussion. Don&#39;t you need to fetch\n&gt;the list of patients to get the link to the &quot;runtime schema&quot;? So you\n&gt;still have a performance issue. If you&#39;re thinking about performance\n&gt;then maybe the schema should be the parent object and the list should be\n&gt;the child. Or they could have a common parent (perhaps it summarizes\n&gt;information from the patient list).\n\nI don&#39;t agree with the notion that a resource model needs to be different\ndue to performance concerns. What happens if the performance concerns change\ndue to unforeseen circumstances and/or innovation? The\nrepresentation might be different, but not the model.\n\nCould you (or should you) model the metadata as a separate resource?\nSomething along the lines of /metadata/patient, /metadata/orders/procedure1,\nor /patients/metadata, /orders/procedure1/metadata.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand. In our system there is either a human entering\n&gt; &gt; the data into the fields for each resource or there is another automated\n&gt; &gt; interface that knows how to map fields from systems in other parts of the\n&gt; &gt; hospital into our fields. Either way, they need to know the basic structure\n&gt; &gt; of the objects including the field names, types, constraints, etc.\n\nAlong these lines, when you do a POST to /orders (specifying the type in \nthe posted data) and it responds with a location where to put the new \norder, i.e. /orders/new_uuid, doing a GET on this location could retrieve \nan empty order of the specified type along with a link to the \nschema/metadata, thus giving you all the structure information that is needed.\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n"}}
