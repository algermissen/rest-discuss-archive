You say that &quot;representations are highly likely to have changed.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; Shouldn&#39;t a RESTful interaction inherently handle those changes gracefully?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; REST does provide a rather graceful way to handle versioning.  By exposing the application semantics explicitly in the representations, the application semantics can be change just by changing the representations.  Of course, this has the potential to break clients if such changes are implemented unilaterally.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP&#39;s content negotiations provides a powerful implementation of this approach.  The client and server get to negotiate which of the available flavor of representations, and there by application semantics, to use.  The server can prevent breakage by supporting multiple flavors/versions of the representations simultaneously.\n&gt;   \n\nWould you do this with custom versioned media types, or with standard \nmedia types and an extra version header?\n\n"}}
