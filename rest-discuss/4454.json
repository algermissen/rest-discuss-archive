This argues that HTML\n&gt; &gt; FORM GETs are a bad way of creating URIs because they are\n&gt; &gt; fabricated.\n&gt;\n&gt; There seems to be a lot of discussion about how the URIs in a REST\n&gt; system should look. Or how they map to server data structures.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m behind the times here -- Roy seems to want a WSDL-like\n&gt; technology to allow you to compose URIs. But does the URI really\n&gt; matter?\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul Prescod argues[1] that the URIs in a REST system ought to be\n&gt; thought of as opaque. You would only discover them as links from other\n&gt; results obtained in the REST system.\n\nMy opinion is that both are tools, with benefits and costs. Both are widely\nused - discovery via href= attributes and generative via FORMs. The\ndiscovery via href= style attributes is pretty simple and &#39;standard&#39;. The\nconstruction of URI based on a service meta-description is more complex and\nnot widely used outside of HTML - I&#39;d love to see a more powerful version\nput forth & accepted by the community.\n\n\n"}}
