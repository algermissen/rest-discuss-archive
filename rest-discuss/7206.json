I am currently using querystring parameters\n&gt; to specify the\n&gt; &gt; filter values, but it seems like there should be a\n&gt; better method. \n&gt; \n&gt; It sounds to me like you exactly want to query a\n&gt; parameter space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matrix URLs [1] are sometimes suggested as an\n&gt; alternative, but they\n&gt; don&#39;t have the same pervasiveness or tooling support\n&gt; as query params.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I could guess at why you find query params less than\n&gt; ideal, but ... why\n&gt; do you think there&#39;s a better method?  What should\n&gt; it look like?  What\n&gt; features should it have?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html\n&gt; \n\nOne idea is to provide for the creation of a query\nresource. Allow the user to compose a query, and\nperhaps name it, and then POST/PUT it to establish it\nas a resource. Something like:\n\nPOST http://example.org/query\n\nwhich would answer with a Location header containing\nsomething like\n\n[1] http://example.org/query/myquery\n\nthen one would GET [1] to retrieve the results of the\nquery.\n\nI think somewhere in there should be two resources -\nthe &quot;query definition&quot; and &quot;the current results of the\nquery&quot;. [1] would identify the query definition and\nyou&#39;d have to do something like provide the URL to the\nresults resource in the definition of the query itself\n- something like\n\n[2] http://example.org/query/myquery/results\n\nAnd of course the results should provide a link back\nthe definition resource. One nice thing about this\ndesign is that one can cache, secure, etc... the\ndefinition and results separately.\n\nI thought of this when contemplating how to offer more\ncomplex queries - like with boolean ops. and\nprecedence. In this way it is sort of like creating a\nview in a database. It may very well be more than you\nneed but I thought I&#39;d throw it out there...\n\n- Kevin\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
