I feel there is a need for higher-level archetypes\nthat can be more easily aligned with the sorts of models business developers\nuse. This looks to me like a promising direction.\n\nI&#39;m curious how one would model workflow with something like this.\nTraditional OO often uses state machines as part of modelling such a\nsolution, whereas (based on comments I&#39;ve heard here, on the REST wiki, and\non xml-dev) REST encourages the use of resources to model steps in a\nworkflow. Presumably, where necessary, one would use transient resources\nthat expire when the workflow is complete, or a step in the workflow that\ninvalidates this resource is taken. Would it make sense to have an archetype\nin the taxonomy for such resources?\n\n"}}
