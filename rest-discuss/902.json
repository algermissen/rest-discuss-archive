If the business process defines acknowledgement or status documents\n&gt; &gt; that have &#39;accepted&#39;, &#39;rejected&#39; and &#39;undecided&#39; values, then this would be\n&gt; &gt; fine I think (retrieving the status document tells you if it was actually\n&gt; &gt; approved). If the business document set doesn&#39;t define &#39;undecided&#39; values\n&gt; &gt; then the Location header might need to reference a resource that does not\n&gt; &gt; yet exist - and when it does exist the values within would specify\n&gt; &gt; &#39;accepted&#39; or &#39;rejected&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be legitimate to return &quot;Created&quot; with a Location header in this\n&gt; case. After all, you did create a resource--the status document you describe\n&gt; above.\n\nExcept that then you lose the &quot;Accepted&quot; bit, which is really the most\nimportant one.\n\nI noticed that 201 didn&#39;t include the Location header some time ago, but\nforgot to bring it up.  I think it would be a great idea to include it,\nas it would permit simpler automation of asynchronous processing with\nHTTP.  Anybody want to raise this with on the HTTP WG mailing list?\nIt might be added to the errata - I consider it an oversight, and I\ndoubt there&#39;s any deployment issue with doing it.\n\nAnother option would be the use the DAV &quot;multistatus&quot; feature where\na response includes a XML body that includes multiple response codes.\nThis way it could return both 201 and 202.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
