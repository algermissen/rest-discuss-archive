I only have one itty-bitty small problem with the whole thing:  after a lot of\nconsideration and a lot of comparitive analysis with other systems that exhibit similar\nproperties in similar contexts, I&#39;ve concluded the opacity axiom is largely based on\nunsubstantiated paranoia that stems from overgeneralization from early problems with the\n(then lack of) Web architecture, and is in general taken far too seriously and literally\nby many people.  That&#39;s my opinion, open to change, compelling counterarguments welcome.\n\nEven Mark&#39;s own &quot;opacity&quot; investigation [1] makes my point for me.  We start with the\npresumption that URI are opaque and &quot;semantics free&quot; in all contexts then proceed to\ndescribe how in fact they have parts that have hierarchical and other relationships with\neach other!  The URI spec itself itself, in all its contortions to specify how\nHTTP-scheme relative URI are to be handled, proves my point!  They aren&#39;t semantics-free\nand they aren&#39;t opaque, they describe a hierarchical information space supplemented with\nproperties and a flat parameter space.  This is a kind of *semantics.*  It desribes an\n*ontology*, albeit rather vaguely.\n\nPaul, you aren&#39;t going to sway my considered opinion simply by reciting the dogma to me,\nand none of the arguments you&#39;ve posed are unfamiliar.  Indeed, most of them are dealt\nwith in the writeup.  If you want to convince me that URI *are* and *should be* opaque,\nyou need to illustrate that this is true and that dangers abound when you treat them\notherwise.  For every &quot;dangerous&quot; example you give, I&#39;ll be happy to offer a positive,\nbeneficial scenario for using semantically-meaningful names.  We&#39;ll see who runs out of\nscenarios first.\n\njb\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/01/UriOpacityInvestigation/\n[2] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt\n\n\n"}}
