Does PUT\n&gt; have a place in REST?\n\nOf course!  How else can you explicitly set state and have\nintermediaries know about it (so they can cache it)?  You can&#39;t do that\nwith POST.\n\n&gt; My instinct is that there is; while POST has the benefit of\n&gt; separating the data and representations, there are times when it&#39;s\n&gt; beneficial to say &quot;here&#39;s a representation; when people request this\n&gt; resource in the future, give it to them.&quot; Does having such a direct\n&gt; relationship violate REST?\n\nI don&#39;t understand what you or John are referring to when you refer\nto a difference between &quot;data&quot; and the &quot;representation&quot;.  REST says\nnothing of &quot;data&quot;, nor should it because it&#39;s hidden (if I understand\nwhat is meant by &quot;data&quot; - basically, the state in some raw form).\n\nI also don&#39;t know what John means by &quot;The appropriate pair for REST\nis GET/POST&quot;.  Why &quot;pair&quot;?  Why restrict one&#39;s self to two methods\nfor coordination when three is needed?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
