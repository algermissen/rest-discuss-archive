What is the &quot;without data loss&quot; server representation... the SQL\n&gt; &gt; ??\n&gt; &gt; and if if parse all those formats to deal with message objects, having\n&gt; &gt; methods and so on... what is the &quot;without data loss&quot; server\n&gt; &gt; representation? the serialized object ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Starting from the perspective of what a resource can accept via POST is \n&gt; incorrect.\n&gt; You must start from the perspective of what the resource *IS* then you know \n&gt; what content-types can be made subordinate via a POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my question to you is: what is this thing that you want to store your \n&gt; various content-types?  Is there an existing content-type that describes \n&gt; it?  If not, you need to define one so that, at least nominally.\n\nThe resource is a message, that can be represented by various\ncontent-types, an thus the server can accept any of them, and return any\nof them... \n\n&gt; Once you do that, the client can do a HEAD of the URI and see that it has\n&gt; content-type: application/x-yannick-container\n&gt; \n&gt; A google search on this content type reveals what resources types can be \n&gt; subordinate to it.  Now you know what you can POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, how the server actually stores your container type is *irrelevant*. \n&gt; Confusion caused by the vagueness of ReST.  All that matters is that it \n&gt; acts as if the resource has the content-type claimed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; In what sense does POSTing an RNA notification imply a request that it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be  accepted as a new subordinate of the inbox?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What does it mean for a notification to be a new subordinate of an inbox?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What does it mean for /you/ for a resource to be subordinate to an other\n&gt; &gt; ? it is not related to the uri, since they are opaque. It is not a\n&gt; &gt; &#39;index&#39; question, since a file is subordinate to a directory (see rfc)\n&gt; &gt; and when you get a directory (at least in Apache) you get an index and\n&gt; &gt; not the content. Do you mean that Apache violate http ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Justin asked this same question and I answered it.  Not all resources that \n&gt; have subordinates are POSTable.  For example, since directories are not \n&gt; POSTable, it is ok for the server to return an index of their subordinates. \n&gt; The subordinates are identifiable as such because HTTP URIs are \n&gt; hierarchical (not completely opaque).\n\nhttp rfc2616 state that a file is subordinate to a directory ... in the\nPOST section!! How can you say that a directory is not postable ??\n\n&lt;quote page=&#39;53&#39;&gt;\n9.5 POST\n\n   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the\n   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed\n   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:\n\n      - Annotation of existing resources;\n\n      - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,\n        or similar group of articles;\n\n      - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a\n        form, to a data-handling process;\n\n      - Extending a database through an append operation.\n\n   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the\n   server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity\n   is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate\n   to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a\n   newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a\n   database.\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nif my uri is http://host/messages?mid=132346132 , it&#39;s not\nhierarchical... but the message is still subordinate to the box. (se\nquote above), as long as a ref to that URI is present in the result of\nthe GET on the box uri (a external content in the header of a\nmime/rfc822 in an message/digest if you want). \n\n\n"}}
