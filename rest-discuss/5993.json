I&#39;m trying to challenge some of my  \n&gt; assumptions so I am sending this email to this list. While I  \n&gt; certainly prefer REST to WS-*, I still don&#39;t think its the best  \n&gt; choice for internal integration within a company.\n&gt;\n&gt; As part of this architecture planning we have identified some  \n&gt; integration categories that are common to us:\n&gt; Sync Request/Reply\n&gt; Async Request/Reply\n&gt; Async 1:1\n&gt; Async 1:M\n&gt; Async 1:M Request/Reply\n&gt; Async M:1\n&gt; Batch Feed\n&gt; I wrote a bit more on these and which ones I think can/should be done  \n&gt; via REST and which ones shouldn&#39;t:\n&gt; http://fuzzypanic.blogspot.com/2006/04/just-how-much-rest-web-style- \n&gt; are-we.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Please let me know what you think.\n\nFor async stuff like you&#39;re describing I rarely use apps built on top\nof HTTP.
