While there&#39;s much value in viewing a web\n&gt; application as a distributed state machine, I&#39;m not sure how far\n&gt; that model needs to be carried into the implementation.  For\n&gt; instance, how much about the FSM is the client expected to\n&gt; understand in order to use the service?  This is a sensitive area,\n&gt; because if the full FSM model is required on the client side,\n&gt; then you lose the &quot;low cost of entry&quot; attribute, and make it\n&gt; harder for the server application to evolve.\n\nI agree with you here.  Sigh.  I guess, that means that there is\ngood bit of work to do.\n\nIn my examples, the current state is returned to the client (in the\nXML document returned as content).  So, all the client needs to do\nis return the content (or the current state from the XML content)\nalong with some additional input, which the FSM uses to select the\nnext transition/state.\n\nHowever, while that&#39;s likely true for trivial examples like mine,\nfor real world, complex problems, I&#39;m sure that clients cannot fly\nblind, so to speak.  Client developers will have to understand the\nFSM and the BP (business process) that is behind it.\n\nSo, I&#39;m agreeing with you.  There are things that can be done to\nhelp, for example, provide a description of the BP, provide an XML\nspecification of the BP, describe the mapping from the BP to the\nFSM (or to an XML document that describes the FSM), provide\ndocumentation on the FSM, provide an XML document that describes\nthe FSM (along with tools to inspect it), etc.\n\nOK.  Talk&#39;s cheap.  I&#39;d better get to work.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If, on the other hand, the server has embodied within it the\n&gt; notion of an FSM of valid client states, and the client is able\n&gt; to explore that (changing) state space dynamically, then you\n&gt; have something cool.\n\nThis is a bit mysterious to me.  By &quot;explore the state space&quot;, do\nyou mean that the client can find out what states (nodes) are in\nthe FSM and which are connected to which?  If so, I&#39;d agree that\nthe client needs access to this information (a picture of the\nentire FSM), one way or another.\n\nHowever, the client developer should also be able to take a\n&quot;peep-hole&quot; view.  For example, &quot;I&#39;m in state X, so all I have to\ndo is provide this input (e.g. a user ID).&quot; Or, &quot;If I&#39;m in state X\nand I provide a valid user ID, what happens?&quot;\n\nThink of it this way -- Suppose we have an FSM that analyzes a\nstream of characters.  All the client should be required to do is\nto continually feed the next character.  For more complex\nprocesses, all that should be required of the client is to feed the\nnext piece of input (e.g. a user ID and password, a part number,\netc).  Granted that the developer of the client application would\nhave to understand the BP/FSM in order to know what information to\nprovide.  However, I can imagine a server implementation (the FSM)\nthat provides a description of the next required piece of input\nwith each response.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m agreeing that something must be done in this area,\nalthough it would be work to do it.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n\n  - Dave\n\n-- \nDave Kuhlman\ndkuhlman@...\nhttp://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman\n\n"}}
