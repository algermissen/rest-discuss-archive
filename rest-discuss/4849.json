Please visit my site:\n\nhttp://dev.gauldong.net/\n\nClick on the &quot;Gado-gado&quot; link and see what I have to offer. I joined\nthe REST mailing lists of yahoo groups to discuss this publicly.\nHopefully a solution will have already been here. But I&#39;ve searched\ngoogle for that and have found nothing which is similar to what I&#39;m\nproposing. I also have searched REST mailing lists archives and found\nnothing of interest.\n\nIs rest-explore still active? It seems to have been dead for a very\nlong time.\n\nHendy Irawan\n-- \nGaulDong - http://www.gauldong.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
