To me, the\naccount (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\nhas identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\nand the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\nthan the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n\nThen there&#39;s that temple somewhere in the Orient that moves itself\namong two or more eligible plots, but it&#39;s the same temple where-\never it&#39;s standing.  The identity of the temple is different for worshipers\nthan it is for the construction crew, and the HTTP authority is yet\nanother party to reckon with.\n\nIf the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want\nthe identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be dragging\nany URI into court.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;S.

Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think we are talking about three different\n&gt; &gt; things:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Availability\n&gt; &gt; * Representation\n&gt; &gt; * Personalization\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think Availability and Representation are\n&gt; &gt; RESTful because there is an automatic way to get\n&gt; &gt; from a URI to a resource via availability and\n&gt; &gt; representation negotiations (aka 40x responses and\n&gt; &gt; accept- headers).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think personalization is unRestful because there\n&gt; &gt; is no way to negotiate automatically to a\n&gt; &gt; particular resource from a URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re presuming that each personalized representation is its own\n&gt; resource. That&#39;s the point that Walden is trying to get across. The\n&gt; Slashdot home page is the Slashdot home page whether it is in English or\n&gt; French (presuming that Slashdot was not totally US-centric), whether the\n&gt; user has asked Google to turn off images or not, whether the user has\n&gt; asked Google to use a blue background or a red one.\n&gt;\n&gt; True, I cannot send you a URL and have you see Slashdot exactly the same\n&gt; way I do. If this is important then Slashdot could generate &quot;view&quot; URLs\n&gt; that always returns the same view. But this is clearly not important for\n&gt; Slashdot so they don&#39;t bother.\n&gt;\n&gt; One issue with the Web is that people tend not to be explicit about what\n&gt; resource the URI represents so you are left to guess about the\n&gt; universality and longevity of a representation you are looking at. You\n&gt; could imagine an interface that would allow end-users to generate a\n&gt; URI/resource with the capabilities you want:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page as it was three seconds ago\n&gt; with my personalization applied (no matter who the user is).&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; versus\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it\n&gt; and my personalization applied (no matter who the user is).&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; versus\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it\n&gt; and the user&#39;s personalization applied.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is probably overkill for 99% of all web sites so it isn&#39;t common.\n&gt; But it shows how to address this personalization versus universality\n&gt; issue. Just make some resources personalized and some universal.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
