That\nURI is perfectly fine, even if what you GET from it differs depending\nupon who invoked GET, the time of day, etc..  To say otherwise is\nto prevent me from identifying a whole class of useful resources,\nsuch as &quot;The person to my right&quot;, &quot;The colour of the next traffic\nlight up ahead&quot;, etc..\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
