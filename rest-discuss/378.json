They can take several forms;\n\n- query forms\n- via HTTP headers (e.g. Location on a 201 response)\n- other assertions - documents that authoritatively declare resource\n  relationships, of which &quot;subordinate&quot; is one type of relationship,\n  such as through a GET\n\n&gt; Must the resource use an entity body in a structured format\n&gt; with HREFs?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; Is there no &quot;standard&quot; way? If not, why not?\n\nDifferent types of assertions happen in different contexts with\ndifferent syntaxes.\n\n&gt; What is the relationship (if any) behind the hierarchy expressed through\n&gt; &quot;/&quot;, &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; and the subordinate resource hierarchy?\n\n&quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; only has special meaning when used in a relative URI.\n\n&quot;/&quot; can be used for exposing subordinates, but that decision can only\nbe made by the publisher.  A third party seeing a /foo/bar URI can&#39;t\nassume that bar is a subordinate of foo.  But it&#39;s good practice for\na publisher to use this structure as a canonical URI when it might be\nimportant for the container to be used as a base URI.  (that was a\nsneak peek from my opacity study)\n\n&gt; I think that\n&gt; there is no explicit relationship. Why do we need two hierarchies?\n\nWhat two?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
