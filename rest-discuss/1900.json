For instance, suppose you have the\nfollowing URL:\n\nhttp://www.seairth.com/time.php\n\nNow, suppose that this each time the URL is submitted, it returns the\ncurrent time in GMT.  From what I understand, GET is ideally suppose to have\nthe same resource/representation returned each time it is submitted.\nHowever, this would not be the case here.  So is GET not the appropriate\nverb to use here, or does it not matter what is returned each time?\n\nI understand that GET is not supposed to change the state of the the\nresource being requested.  Suppose you had the following URL:\n\nhttp://www.seairth.com/hitcount.php\n\nNow, in this case, each time it the URL is submitted, the server increments\nan internal hit counter and returns the current hit count.  In this case,\nthe actual act of making the request has cause the state to change.  Should\nGET not be used in a case like this, or is the GET request not actually the\nthing which is changing the resource state?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
