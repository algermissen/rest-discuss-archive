Keeping the server from chewing\nup memory is a problem - I&#39;ve stopped running mine.\n\nWhy is tunneling HTTP through HTTP a bad idea? If the resource is a queue of\nmessages - and the representation of the message is mime type &quot;message/http&quot;\n, then that is exactly what you are /supposed/ to do. Right?\n\n(This leads into my &#39;expanding the web onto desktops works in rest/http, but\nbreaks in the real world&#39; talk, which I&#39;ll have to find some time to write\nup fully...)\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The new design would still work by resource modelling.  However it\nwould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be oriented towards hypertext, so stuff related to connection keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alive would be hairy.  It would not work with existing proxies, but\nthat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not a REST issue IMO.\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think keep-alive is related to hypertext. I don&#39;t know why you\nsee\n&gt; &gt; it as different than a persistent connection?\n&gt; &gt; The handshaking is still request/response (except for\n&gt; &gt; chunked-transfer-encoding, but I wouldn&#39;t mess with that).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking of Roy&#39;s dissertation, where he is very clear that there was\n&gt; an expected granularity of content, which is the granularity of hypertext.\nHypertext on the web has no &#39;bounded object set&#39; - so the granularity is\ninfinite. An individual message corresponds to about the size of a single\nportion of hypertext we normally call a document, so I don&#39;t see the\nproblem.\n\n\n"}}
