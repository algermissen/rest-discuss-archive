I don&#39;t think so, but of course I may be\n&gt; wrong - in my view, you can standardize e.g. within your company or\n&gt; some other domain. Probably we need Roy to provide an authoritative\n&gt; answer.\n&gt; \n\nI would like to think that there are enough experts on this list,\nyourself and myself included, to hash this sort of thing out without\nrequiring Roy to referee.  Besided, I do believe Roy explained this\npoint until he was blue in the face, in the comments here:\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n\nI recommend reading the entire comment thread, to put my excerpts in\ntheir proper context.  In the context of using standardized media\ntypes, Roy has plenty to say...\n\n&quot;\nTo some extent, people get REST wrong because I failed to include\nenough detail on media type design within my dissertation...  \n\nYou don&#39;t get to decide what POST means -- that is decided by the\nresource.  Its purpose is supposed to be described in the same context\nin which you found the URI that you are posting to.  Presumably, that\ncontext (a hypertext representation in some media type understood by\nyour client) tells you or your agent what to expect from the POST using\nsome combination of standard elements/relations and human-readable\ntext.  The HTTP response will tell you what happened as a result...\n\n...\n\nPerhaps [this comment] will help clarify the role of standards in\nRESTful systems:\nOf course the client has prior knowledge.  Every protocol, every media\ntype definition, every URI scheme, and every link relationship type\nconstitutes prior knowledge that the client must know (or learn) in\norder to make use of that knowledge.  REST doesn&#39;t eliminate the need\nfor a clue.  What REST does is concentrate that need for prior knowledge\ninto readily standardizable forms.  That is the essential distinction\nbetween data-oriented and control-oriented integration.\n\nIt has value because it is far easier to standardize representation and\nrelation types than it is to standardize objects and object-specific\ninterfaces.  In other words, there are fewer things to learn and they\ncan be recombined in unanticipated ways while remaining understandable\nto the client.\n\n...\n\nIn terms of testing a specification, the hardest part is identifying\nwhen a RESTful protocol is actually dependent on out-of-band\ninformation...  What I look for are requirements on processing behavior\nthat are defined outside of the media type specification.  One of the\neasiest ways to see that is when a protocol calls for the use of a\ngeneric media type (like application/xml or application/json) and then\nrequires that it be processed in a way that is special to the\nprotocol/API.\n\n...\n\nThe media type identifies a specification that defines how a\nrepresentation is to be processed.  That is out-of-band information (all\ncommunication is dependent on some prior knowledge).  What you are\nmissing is that each representation contains the specific instructions\nfor interfacing with a given service, provided in-band.  The media type\nis a generic processing model that every agent can learn if there\naren&#39;t too many of them (hence the need for standards).\n&quot;\n\nThe only thing Roy describes as acceptably domain-specific, are\nvocabularies contained within standard media types:\n\n&quot;Exposing that vocabulary in the representations makes it easy to learn\nand be adopted by others.  Some of it will be standardized, some of it\nwill be domain-specific, but ultimately the agents will have to be\nadaptable to new vocabulary.\n&quot;\n\nI hope this is all the backing I need for my stance:  this list is full\nof examples given in terms of URIs, HTTP methods and response codes,\nand hypothetical media types with a target audience of a single\nsystem.  We need to stop doing this, or at least point out that to do\nso is fundamentally at odds with the REST style, and stress using\nstandard (or at least standardizable) media types, because method use\nmust be encompassed within the definition of the media type.\n\nOtherwise, the REST community is just as responsible as the API\ndesigners, for the sorry state of affairs where 99% of REST APIs don&#39;t\nconform to the style.  I believe this is a solid foundation for my\nhypothesis that we&#39;re teaching REST wrong.  &quot;Rebooting REST&quot; thread to\nfollow.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
