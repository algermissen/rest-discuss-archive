I&#39;d recommend something like:\n\nGET http://localhost/app/statechanges/latest\n-- returns the new state of every object whose state has changed \nwithin the last time unit eg &lt;states&gt;&lt;state \ntarget=&quot;Driver&quot;&gt;...&lt;/state&gt;&lt;state target=&quot;Door&quot;&gt;...&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/states&gt; \nas well as the exact time the state transition took place.\n\nIt sounds like you may be going for an event-based model. Beware that \nneither SOAP nor REST map well onto the event-based model. HTTP is \nfundamentally a &#39;pull&#39;-focused protocol while event-based models \nare &#39;push&#39;-focused. It can be done but it should not be done.\n\n- jkk\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Seth Ladd &lt;seth@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve come to a mental block, and I am hoping the REST community can \nhelp \n&gt; me clear things up.\n&gt; \n&gt; For this example, I&#39;ll use two resources: A Car and A Driver.  A \ncentral \n&gt; monitoring computer wants to know when a particular driver has \nentered \n&gt; the car AND through what door did that driver enter.  In this \nscenario I \n&gt; have two resources, and each one is changing state.  The Car&#39;s \nchild \n&gt; resource Door has changed from Closed to Open (and back to \nClosed).  The \n&gt; Driver&#39;s location property has changed from OutsideCar to \nInsideCar.  I \n&gt; need to know both resources and their state changes to correctly \nknow \n&gt; which Driver is in the car and what door was used.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m having problems connecting these two state changes together to \n&gt; provide the central monitoring computer the correct information.  I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to transmit them separately, since then I can&#39;t always \nknow \n&gt; the two events are related.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want to say in the Door Open state change that a particular \n&gt; Driver opened it because that information (the actor in this \nscenario) \n&gt; isn&#39;t really part of the state change of the door.  I want to keep \nthe \n&gt; communication primarily state changes of resources, not Events that \n&gt; detail &quot;How, What, Where, and Why&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am missing something of the puzzle?  How can I communicate two \npieces \n&gt; of information in one state change, or link two state changes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Your help and insight is greatly appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much,\n&gt; Seth\n\n\n"}}
