Maybe  \n&gt; I&#39;m missing something, but I&#39;ve never seen this alternative before,  \n&gt; and I can&#39;t convince myself to like it. (In case others haven&#39;t read  \n&gt; this page: it suggests encoding information such as &quot;# of items of  \n&gt; product 1: 3, # of items of product 2: 5&quot; in a string and append it to  \n&gt; the URI so that it itself carries the state.)\n\nIt looks odd at first glance, but I&#39;m starting to like it.  The\nparticular URI encoding chosen is just a server-side implementation\ndetail; they&#39;re opaque and the client doesn&#39;t need to know or care\nabout them.  The interesting thing about this implementation is that,\ninstead of having a resource that represents a particular user&#39;s\nbasket, which can change state over time, there are instead a possibly\ninfinite number of non-user-specific baskets on the server, each of\nwhich has a unique URI.\n\nI&#39;d say it&#39;s analogous to submitting an HTML form via GET.  You end up\nat a new URI that identifies a resource. I don&#39;t see how this is any\ndifferent from a URI like http://www.google.com/search?q=apples\n\nI don&#39;t see any constraints being violated.  Resources are named by\n(opaque) URIs, the uniform interface is observed, everything is highly\ncacheable, the server doesn&#39;t know or care anything about the state of\nthe client, and app state is firmly controlled by the client\nleveraging nothing but hypermedia.\n\nThe example isn&#39;t finished; he doesn&#39;t show how you&#39;d &quot;check out&quot;, but\nI imagine you&#39;d do that by POSTing or PUTing a basket representation\nsomewhere. The hypermedia could contain forms for that too.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
