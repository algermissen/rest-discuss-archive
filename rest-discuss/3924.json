It just has to\n&gt;&gt; have a clear meaning with respect to a POSTed request entity and a target\n&gt;&gt; resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s clearly different from PUT.  Where is it written that it must be\n&gt; any clearer than that?\n\nIt must be clear enough for the server to be able claim that the request \nsucceeded (200 OK).  If the server doesn&#39;t know the meaning of the request, \nit can&#39;t return 200 OK.  And if the meaning of the request is subject to a \nprivate negotiation between the server operator and the client operator, \nthen there is no particular reason to use a public method name.\n\nHow else can you interpret the beginning of section 9 of RFC2616:\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n   The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below. Although\n   this set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to\n   share the same semantics for separately extended clients and servers.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nIf POST is a catchall, it is not a &quot;common method&quot; it is a private method \nwith a public name and client and servers cannot assume that they share the \nsame semantics when the method is used.\n\nIf POST has a specific meaning then it is a &quot;common method&quot; for all HTTP \nclients and servers.  If you have a different specific meaning for POST, \nplease share.  But if you are saying that POST has no specific meaning at \nall, then I think you are talking about a protocol other than HTTP/1.1.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
