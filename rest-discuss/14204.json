That is  \n&gt; not the same thing as classifying resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; Drawing resources into an application flow will imply that the  \n&gt; resource has a certain set of characteristics when approached from a  \n&gt; particular context, and that is all that is necessary to treat it as  \n&gt; such. The resource doesn&#39;t need an inherent/intrinsic type because  \n&gt; the link relation leading to its state transfer provided everything  \n&gt; necessary to &#39;classify&#39; it.\n\nYep, sure. I never suggested anything like inherent/intrinsic (I&#39;d use  \n&#39;intentional&#39;) typing. I was talking (or at least tried to) about the  \nclassification by context. (Along the lines how AtomPub defines member  \nresources to be those resource whose identifier is listed in a  \ncollection).\n\nSo we seem to be in agreement about that.\n\nMy point is that REST forbids that clients make any assumptions based  \non such &#39;classification&#39;. So, client should not rely on an assumption  \nthat AtomPub collections respond to GET with (at least) application/ \natom+xml.\n\nBut if there is not such asn assumption - you cannot code the GET and  \nsubsequent operations on the response body. You just could not code\n\n- GET /entries\n- iterate over entries and do this and that\n\nbecause no prior assumption about the collection is allowed. Could be  \nthat the collection allways returns image/jpeg with a picture of the  \ncollection.\n\n\nYes, AtomPub does say that a feed is returned - but that violates REST.\n\njan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A client should start from an entry point and advance its state by  \n&gt; following links. If your client wishes to persist a reference to a  \n&gt; particular resource or application state, it should do so by storing  \n&gt; the URI against the &#39;classification&#39; derived from *its own  \n&gt; application state* with respect to the protocol in question, and not  \n&gt; derived from a type identified by the resource itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; E.g:\n&gt;\n&gt; State 1:\n&gt; GET /entry-point\n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;blog&quot; href=&quot;/123asdf&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; State 2:\n&gt; GET /123asdf\n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;post&quot; href=&quot;/4560456456uiop&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; State 3:\n&gt; GET /4560456456uiop\n&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello world&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; &lt;content&gt;Foo Bar&lt;/content&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no inherent type of resource /4560456456uiop, and yet a  \n&gt; machine client with understanding of this simple blog protocol will  \n&gt; know exactly what &#39;classification&#39; it is - from the context implied  \n&gt; by the flow in my blog application; (entry-point) -&gt; blog -&gt; post.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Mike\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
