Posted this question on the DDD group b=\r\nut someone pointed me here.  Now who would think that there would be a whol=\r\ne group focusing on REST :)\n\nRight!\n\nEvery once-in-a-while a take another l=\r\nook at something just to refresh / improve my understanding.\n\nSo I had anot=\r\nher good look at REST --- on wikipedia.\n\nSo now I&#39;m thinking I had my idea =\r\nof REST somewhat wonky. Using the correct way the following happes:\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/domain/cars --&gt; returns ALL cars\nhttp://domain/cars/abc123 --&gt; returns car=\r\n details with id abc123\n\nso the &#39;format&#39; is domain/{collection}/{id}\n\nNow i=\r\nf there are 40 gazillion cars it would be silly returning the whole lot.\n\nS=\r\no there is no bahaviour built in other than the HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE=\r\n; not much behaviour at all.\n\nWhen looking at MVC and what can be done with=\r\n routing it makes more sense (to me, anyway):\n\nhttp://domain/{aggregate}/{a=\r\nction}/{id}\n\nso:\n\nhttp://domain/cars/find --&gt; post a search request\nhttp://=\r\ndomain/cars/list --&gt; returns SEARCH result\nhttp://domain/cars/new --&gt; start=\r\ns a new car registration\nhttp://domain/cars/create ---&gt; post a create reque=\r\nst\nhttp://domain/cars/show/abc123 --&gt; returns car details with id abc123\nht=\r\ntp://domain/cars/declareunroadworthy/abc123 --&gt; car with id abc123 set to u=\r\nnroadworthy\n\nIs this still REST. There may be session state on the server.\n=\r\n\nMaybe this is Representational Intent or something to that effect.\n\nIdeas?=\r\n\n\nRegards,\nEben\n\n\n\n"}}
