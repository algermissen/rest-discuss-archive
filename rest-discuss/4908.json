If everybody is touting REST as &quot;the One(tm) who\n&gt; made Web successful&quot;, it just seems natural that it is &quot;the founding\n&gt; technology&quot;. That means it should&#39;ve been supported by anything BEFORE\n&gt; now.\nI&#39;m suggesting that when designing new services, consider usage from\nnon-browser clients. There are plenty of technologies to serve browser based\napps - both client-side and server-side (and proxies too). They have a lot\nof legacy cruft to deal with, but some groups are working on that - like the\nWHAT-WG (extending html and defining improved browser behavior). I don&#39;t\nbelieve one system or service will server both automation-based clients and\nsimple user-interface based clients (until you have a programmable client\nwithin a user-interface client, such as xmlhttprequest).\n\nSystems like PHP have evolved and improved over the years and if that system\nis broken with respect to existing, open and standard protocols like HTTP,\nthen I&#39;d suggest fixing that broken system in order to access missing\nfunctionality rather than pretend the existing technology doesn&#39;t exist or\nisn&#39;t useful.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t assume that full support for existing technology &#39;just happens&#39; -\nfor the most part, people that build new systems /want/ to build something\nnew top to bottom, they aren&#39;t motivated to re-use or extend what&#39;s already\nbeen done.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s already there - just invisible, like any successful technology.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cool! I didn&#39;t think of that... However, aside from the fact that these\n&gt; technologies are &#39;new&#39; (and the fact that the underlying HTTP techology is\n&gt; very old), they treat the Web EXACTLY like a filesystem, just like one\n&gt; member of this group said earlier. And nobody treats the Web like a\n&gt; filesystem, the idea is just not something like that.\nFilesystems typically are local or nearby and have very chatty protocol\nusage - systems that use WebDAV (and have succeded) don&#39;t make those\nassumptions. They don&#39;t treat resources exactly like files.\n\n\n"}}
