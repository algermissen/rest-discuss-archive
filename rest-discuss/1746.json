And I \nnow also think that some REST idioms are much more closely related to \nPi Calculus than anything else (tho&#39;, to be honest, that&#39;s probably \nstretching things a bit).\n\nREST interests me a bit, but mostly for reasons that are likely to be \nanathema to dyed in the wool RESTians ...\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
