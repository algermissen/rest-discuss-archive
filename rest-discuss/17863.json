&quot;representing links&quot; that span across all data formats, there are a\n&gt; number of solid examples to use a guides.\n&gt; - Subbu Allamaraju has basic link  representation recipes for XML and\n&gt; JSON in his &quot;RESTful Web Services Cookbook&quot; [1]\n&gt; - I have examples of both simple links and paramterized &quot;forms&quot; for JSON\n&gt; in my Collection+JSON registered media type design [2]\n&gt; - Of course, HTML, Atom, and VoiceXML are all sample hypermedia-oriented\n&gt; media types that have examples of how to represent links and forms.\n\ni&#39;d like to add that apart from the link semantics baked into some of \nthose media types (HTML, Atom, VoiceXML, ...), there also are standards \nsuch as XInclude and XLink which try to serve as generic building blocks \nfor representing link semantics. however, XInclude is very limited in \nits scope (just doing inclusion), and XLink is not a huge success \nbecause it has been built with visual clients in mind and not so much \nbased on the idea of general REST hypermedia. i am still hoping that at \nsome point in time, there will be some &quot;better XLink&quot; that hopefully \nwould be abstract enough to serve as a starting point for representing \nlinks in XML as well as in JSON, but that&#39;s just me hoping and if that \never happens, it is not going to be anytime soon. there is certainly \nroom for improvement in this area.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
