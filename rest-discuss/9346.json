The 2nd DELETE should be directed to said trashcan and\n&gt;the file could then be completely purged (204).  Explicitely DELETING\n&gt;the same resource twice is counter-intuitive and IMO breaks idempotence.\n&gt;\n\nCan break idempotence, yes, but that&#39;s already been fixed as I explained \nin another post.  If you would like, you can explain exactly how the \nbehavior I have implemented is not idempotent and I&#39;m all ears.  In the \nmeantime, I make the same objection to giving DELETE the semantics of \n&quot;move&quot; by having subsequent GET requests respond with a redirect, as I \nmake for using PUT to implement &quot;remove&quot; semantics.\n\nTo clarify, I am not implementing a trashcan.  I am implementing a method \nwhereby users of the service can toggle an URL between &quot;used to exist&quot; \nand &quot;not known to have existed&quot; and I have done so with an absolute \nminimum of complexity.  There is no provision to restore the file -- \nbesides PUTting it back from the client side.\n\nI point out, that the trashcan on my file system does not involve moving \nany files.  It simply marks them as deleted, until they are marked as \nundeleted or deleted for a second time (by emptying the trash).  When I \ntry to access a deleted resource, I get an error message, not a redirect \nto my trashcan.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
