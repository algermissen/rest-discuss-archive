Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; There are several problems inherent in content negotiation which are not \n&gt; adequately addressed in the standards, IMO. To illustrate, I&#39;ll use an \n&gt; image-file example. Let&#39;s say I make an URI for a resource which happens to \n&gt; be a photo of myself and call it /eric, then set up content negotiation \n&gt; between representations labeled eric.jpg and eric.png. I wind up with three \n&gt; URLs for what I intended (99.9% of the time) to be only one resource, \n&gt; &quot;picture of me&quot;. \n\nThis is easily solved. Just don&#39;t expose the individual variants. \n\nUse only the cool-uri.\n\n\n&gt; This is where representational cookies come in. After negotiating with a \n&gt; client, why not &quot;bookmark&quot; the result? Does the same client which has \n&gt; undergone negotiation for the /eric request have to be subjected to content \n&gt; negotiation on all subsequent requests for /image resources? Won&#39;t the \n&gt; result be the same, each time that client negotiates with the\n&gt; server? \n\nWhat if it changes it&#39;s preferred representation?\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
