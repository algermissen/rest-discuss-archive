Resources are \n&gt; not records in a database table, they are a view of your \n&gt; system /from the outside/.\n\nYou wouldn&#39;t otherwise know, but I have studied the concept of resources\nad-nausem in my quest to really understand URLs, URI Opacity, REST, et. al.\nI especially like how the debates on what defines a resource turned up not\ndefinition better than one equivalent to a certain US supreme court\njustice&#39;s definition of pornography: &quot;I, I, I can&#39;t define it, but I KNOW IT\nWHEN I SEE IT!&quot; :-)\n\nBut I think you missed my point, and the point was that the combined &quot;edit&quot;\n& &quot;edit_form&quot; seem to be part of process flow that REST does not define.\nREST seems to define the retrieval of the data and the update of the data,\nbut not the interim process.  Sure we can use REST to handled that interim\nprocess but it seems like to it contrived, at least to me.  Again, I&#39;m not\nsaying it invalidates REST; instead I&#39;m saying that it would mean that\narchitecting a proper REST system requires more thought to implement that\nthe high level thesis has defined.  \n\n&gt; It&#39;s okay to have a resource for a &#39;public view&#39;, and a &#39;private view&#39;\n&gt; and a &#39;private view for editing&#39; and &#39;public view for \n&gt; editing&#39; and a &#39;private view for editing by account manager&#39;, \n&gt; etc.  This is what really happens on the Web and this is what \n&gt; ReST describes. \n\nThis seems to be to be apples and oranges compared to what I was saying,\ni.e. part of a process flow vs security enabled views.\n\nThat said, can you explain how one would communicate to the same URL on the\nserver that one view should be public and another private?  Seems to me it\nshould be a different URL.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
