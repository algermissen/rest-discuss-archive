The =\r\nIEDR, as with many other domain registries, use\nEPP[1] or a variant thereof=\r\n to allow resellers to manipulate their\nrepositories. The IEDR&#39;s own implem=\r\nentation extends EPP to implement\ntheir MSD process. The MSD process allows=\r\n resellers to suspend a\ndomain as a credit control measure for about 30 day=\r\ns. If a domain\nwhich is in the MSD process is not taken out of it and unsus=\r\npended by\nthe time, the domain becomes available for registration again.\n\nT=\r\nhe problem here is that on any given day, a large number of domains\ncan be =\r\nmoved in and out of the MSD process, and this is generally done\nin batches.=\r\n\n\nCurrently, the cleanest way I can think of is to POST a collection of\ndom=\r\nain representations to a special &#39;batch&#39; endpoint, not entirely\nunlike the =\r\nway that GData works. But that doesn&#39;t feel quite right,\nalmost as if I&#39;m a=\r\nbusing POST.\n\nHas anybody else ever encountered a similar problem to this, =\r\nand if\nso, how did you go about solving it.\n\nK.\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.or=\r\ng/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol\n    Take a read of the RFCs: it&#39;s l=\r\nike staring into hell.\n\n\n"}}
