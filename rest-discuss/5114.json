If done\n&gt; that way,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; MONITOR /foo HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Host: example.org\n&gt; Reply-To: http://other.org/workflows/76a56\n&gt;\n&gt; would have the semantics[1] &#39;POST every request to /foo to the Reply-\n&gt; URI as-is&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that what you had in mind?\nWell, I was thinking that the response to MONITOR would be content-type\n&quot;multipart/message&quot; and each part would be content-type &quot;message/http&quot;.\nAlternatively I could imagine using a reply-to (or maybe &quot;forward-to&quot;) to\nsend the original request, but not necessarily using POST. But that might\nnot be consistent with the meaning of the forwarded request (no reply would\nbe expected).\n\n"}}
