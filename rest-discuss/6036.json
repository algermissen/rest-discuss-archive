I&#39;m implementing a web application, and implementation is  \nexactly what I&#39;m talking about. Your original post claimed that HTTP  \nand REST are flawed because they don&#39;t have sessions. My response was  \nthat perhaps HTTP and REST aren&#39;t the problem, but how you are  \nthinking about using them in your implementation. If you change how  \nyou think about implementing your application, does your perceived  \nrequirement for sessions go away?\n\nIf a C++ programmer complains that C is flawed because it doesn&#39;t  \nhave classes, then I&#39;d suggest that perhaps that person is trying to  \nuse C wrongly, that they should think in terms of structured, not  \nobject-oriented design, in C. In designing web applications, I&#39;ve  \nlong heard people tell me I need to have user sessions, and have  \nfollowed that advice.\n\nMy current design problem, however, is a network of sites that will  \nbe implemented in terms of multiple server clusters, each of which  \nwill host one to many sites. In this particular design context, I had  \nconcerns about the scalability of using the user sessions in the  \ntraditional way. Thus I was looking for a way to not need user  \nsessions at all. I looked to REST because REST proponents tend to  \ncomplain about user sessions. I figured REST might show me a  \ndifferent path, and it did.\n\nWhat it showed me was that a good way to think about designing web  \napplications is &quot;resource-oriented design,&quot; to give it a name. In  \ndesigning a C++ program, I might ask myself, &#39;What are the objects?&#39;.  \nIn designing a web application, I would ask myself, &#39;What are the  \nresources?&#39;.\n\nIn the case of the conversational state I keep to redirect to GET  \nafter POST when someone submits a registration form with an error, I  \nasked myself, &#39;What are the resources?&#39;. Is there just one form  \nresource? That&#39;s what I had implemented before (in fact, currently).  \nWhen you get that resource it may be blank, or it may contain data,  \ndepending on the user session. So different users would get different  \ndata depending upon their sessions. Are these all just different  \nrepresentations of the same resource?\n\nI realized that conceptually, without any low-level thinking about  \nimplementation, these form pages don&#39;t feel like different  \nrepresentations of the same resource to me. They feel like different  \nresources, which means they should have different URIs. By moving the  \nconversational state from sessions to diamonds (or snapshots), they  \nbecome resources. I can attach authentication requirements to them,  \nso all I need from the client is authentication credentials and a  \nURI. I don&#39;t need a session. And therefore I don&#39;t have to worry  \nabout replicating session state, because there is no session state. I  \ndo have to worry about replicating snapshots, but feel it is more  \ntractable. In short, I believe scalability will be easier to achieve  \nin my particular situation using the snapshots approach than the user  \nsessions approach.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
