I think I&#39;ve seen the following options\ndiscussed here:\n\n 1. through a new method\n\nWATCH /blah/blah\n\n 2. through the existence of a new header in a POST\n\nReply-to: http://....\n\n 3. through a form parameter in a POST\n\n&reply-to=http://....\n\n 4. through a POST of a content type\n\nContent-type: application/www-notification-request\n\n 5. The application could merely &quot;know&quot; that when a POST is made to a\nparticular URI that the request is for a notification.\n\nI guess I prefer 2, the reply-to header. Lucas, why do your examples use\n3? I would rather leave the POST body completely in the domain of the\napplication because what if the application wants to pass XML or\ngraphics as the body? \n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
