Fielding wrote:\n\n&gt; It is wrong.  A resource is not just the state -- it is also the\n&gt; mapping from state to representation(s).  For example, you can have\n&gt; one resource that is my home page and a second resource that is the\n&gt; text/html version of my home page, and those two resources are\n&gt; different even if they have the same representation most of the\n&gt; time and the same state all of the time.  A diff is a representation\n&gt; of how to get from one state to another, not a representation of\n&gt; either of those states.  Therefore, it is always wrong to &quot;patch&quot;\n&gt; the resource on a PUT of a diff, as opposed to setting the resource\n&gt; state to the diff.  That is why I introduced PATCH in the first\n&gt; drafts of HTTP/1.1.\n&gt; \n\nI just wish we could have gotten that understanding clear in APP. I&#39;m \nafraid APP went the other way and allowed some servers to use PUT as \nPATCH and others to use it as REPLACE, without necessarily telling the \nclient whihc one they were doing. :-(\n\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
