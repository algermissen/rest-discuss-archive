It does however insulate them from having to\n&gt; understand the form of your urls.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m putting this out here for discussion, and not\n&gt; really suggesting you implement it this way.\n\nI *would* suggest that it is implemented that way. It’s the\nhypermedia constraint.\n\nTruly RESTful apps are – by definition![1] – designed around\nthe formats of the representations exchanged, not around the\nstructure of the URIs used.\n\nTake a look at Atompub for an idea of how that looks in practice.\n\n&gt; But if anyone out there thinks there&#39;s a good way to do what\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do, which is to drive the interaction through\n&gt; forms, please jump in.\n\nI think what you described is just fine.\n\n\n[1] Remember what “ReST” means…\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
