One article I found (on this very list)\n&gt; suggests using GET and POST makes more sense for untrusted (browser)\n&gt; clients. If this is the case, then how does one define in a POST that\n&gt; it is actually a DELETE or PUT? I&#39;m also curious to know if any\n&gt; XMLHttpRequest implementations even support PUT and DELETE.\n\nHi Stuart,\n\nDoing additional verbs with XMLHttpRequest is easy.  Here is an example\nPUT:\n\n\treq.open(&quot;PUT&quot;, location, false);\n\nYou will probably want to use it in asynchronous mode (the last\nparameter would be &#39;true&#39;).  There are some good references on\nXMLHttpRequest on the AJAX patterns site: http://ajaxpatterns.org/.\n\nI have used XMLHttpRequest quite easily between modern Mozilla/Firefox\nand IE, but the my code doesn&#39;t yet work on Safari (and I&#39;m assuming\nOpera, but I haven&#39;t tried yet).  I&#39;d say just stick to the usage\npatterns on the AJAX sites and you&#39;ll be fine.  The main thing is\ntesting, testing, testing.  You&#39;ll at least want to know what you\nsupport works and what you don&#39;t support won&#39;t really corrupt things in\nyour application when/if it doesn&#39;t work as expected.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nast\n***************************************************************************************************\nThe information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged Access to this email by anyone other than the intended addressee is unauthorized.
