Give me a non-obvious case that is not an example of poor engineering \n&gt; and that cannot be refactored to be simple enough to be obvious.\n\nas the use of html forms imply the use of an html browser as a GUI, and\nnot a custom client, the client can&#39;t deal with many http headers (e.g.\nchanging Accept on the fly, conditional GET, other methods than\npost/get. This is browser poor engineering, not service. But to deal\nwith these problems, the simplest solution is to add params in the query\npart that are not directly related to the content (data) of the\nresource. (see my HttpEquiv... proposal). Thus, if your service use such\na trick, theses params are not implies by the &quot;schema&quot; of your type. In\naddition, all your argumentation suppose that the type *has* a schema\nand is validable... which in not alway true either. \n\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, this can&#39;t be automated. You have to look\n&gt; &gt; for this schema.\n&gt; \n&gt; You always need to understand the content-types (and schema) with which you \n&gt; are dealing.  RDF forms also requires you to understand schema.  The \n&gt; question is whether you need anything more (beyond the constraints of \n&gt; HTTP/1.1).  As far as understanding content-types (and schema), the effort \n&gt; on RDF forms would be better spent improving the infrastructure for \n&gt; resolving content-type names to their documentation.  Perhaps adding a url \n&gt; parameter to the content-type header designating the location of the \n&gt; documentation about the content-type would be the way to go.\n\nIf such an url is included in the header, I agree for this argument. But\nin the current situation, the name of the MIME type is not enough, and\nit&#39;s all that you can obtain from the service. As you can&#39;t modify the\nMIME standard, the solution would be a Meta-Content header, but this\ndiscussion is an other problem, already debated here. Moreover, an\nrf-like document allow to use a *unique* language to describe the form.\nWhat is the language of your schema ? if it&#39;s the content is not xml ...\nSuch a unique format (joined with the discovery it implies, contrary tto\nMIME that don&#39;t say where to find the format definition, when it even\nexists) allow full automation e.g. on the fly form generation... \n\n&gt; &gt; And finally, this suppose that your &quot;default&quot; (or\n&gt; &gt; &quot;main&quot;) type is application/shoe-order+xml, and I precised that is this\n&gt; &gt; example case, default is text/html and the server can return many\n&gt; &gt; formats, thanks to, e.g. , server-side xslt, so there is *no* &quot;main&quot;\n&gt; &gt; type.\n&gt; \n&gt; The default type of *what* is text/html?  The form?  The POSTable resource? \n\nThe postable resource, which is what is interesting here. Suppose you\nhave an url to an article. the default type of the get is html. you can\npost comments to that article. Explain me how you deal with that...\nThe type return by the head is html. there is no schema for the post\ncontent. You can&#39;t POST to an other uri, because you would loose the\nmeaning of the post. \n\n&gt; The entity body returned from the POST?  The point of my elucidation \n&gt; (copied below) is that browser based form interaction never actually \n&gt; require a GET of a POSTable resource, so it can be whatever type you want. \n&gt; My general point is that that type should provide enough information for \n&gt; form-designers and other client-side developers to understand how to \n&gt; interact with the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
