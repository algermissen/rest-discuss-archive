Townley&quot; &lt;andrew.townley@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Back to the scalability issue, you actually do have this sort of issue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with web pages as well, it&#39;s just that the cost of replicating the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; current state of the resource to across a server farm is much less\n&gt;&gt;&gt; because those resources don&#39;t change often, and if they do change,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; people may be able to live with stale information for a short period of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; time until the replication process is complete.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With a session based model the state has to be distributed and locking\n&gt;&gt; mechanisms put in place to ensure transactional consistency.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With REST, you can maintain the state of the resource in the resource\n&gt;&gt; and simply redirect people to the correct resource.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; But then, the resource has to be distributed. And now the state of the \n&gt; resource will change as often as the session would have, had you been \n&gt; using one. Which makes it just as hard to distribute.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess you&#39;re implying there are more or better tools to handle \n&gt; distribution of resources (including frequently changing ones?) than \n&gt; there are to handle distribution of Sessions.\n\nNo. I&#39;m not. I was finding this difficult to explain though  /8-&gt;\n\n\nHere&#39;s an attempt to explain.\n\nConsider resource representations in files and a high utilization app\nwith state stored in a resource:\n\n   /bankaccount/{username}\n\nwhere {username} is obviously a variable that changes depending on the\nowner of the bankaccount; eg:\n\n   /bankaccount/nicferrier\n\nTo distribute load in a REST system you can simply partition the\nnamespace across your servers and redirect; eg:\n\n  server 1 does resources /bankaccount/a* to /bankaccount/h*\n  server 2 does resources /bankaccount/i* to /bankaccount/p*\n  server 3 does resources /bankaccount/q* to /bankaccount/z*\n\nor some other mappping.\n\nThese servers are all behind a traditional load balancer or a DNS\nround robin so they all recieve equal numbers of requests.\n\nWhen server 2 recieves a request for my bankaccount it processes it\nand returns the representation of my bankaccount.\n\nBut when server 3 recieves a request for my bankaccount it redirects\nthe request to server 3; that is it sends a 303 response with server\n2&#39;s as the next location.\n\n\nObviously, this mapping system could be much finer granularity; on\nGNU&#39;s savannah system we have a similar system for CVS (we don&#39;t\ndistribute HTTP load this way for projects because of other\narchitectural constraints) which goes to 3 levels of granularity:\n\n   /users/{firstletter}/{firstletter}{secondletter}/{firstletter}{secondletter}{thirdletter}/username\n\nHashing schemes like this are in fact quite common and make quite\nsimple load balancing schemes.\n\n\nAs a load balancing scheme it&#39;s good. It removes the scalability\nproblem; you can add more and more servers and simply increase the\ngranularity of the namespace-&gt;resources mapping. There is a\ntheoretical maxium of one server:one user but that would be a very\nheavy application indeed.\n\nNow all you&#39;re left with is a reliability problem (one user&#39;s\nstate is now on only one server) but that can be solved in other ways;\nhot standby and such like. \n\n\nAs I said, this *could* be done with session load balancing - nobody\nhas done it I believe because once you do this you may as well have\nthe state in resources.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
