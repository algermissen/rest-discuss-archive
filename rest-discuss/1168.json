That doesn&#39;t mean that WSDL is REST-ful, but it does mean\n&gt; that your next sentence is misleading:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; SOAP-RPC already offers solutions to all of the above.\n\nPoint taken.\n\n&gt; How does SOAP-RPC handle &quot;event models&quot;????\n\nBy allowing SOAP-RPC to be transported over event protocols such as JMS,\nand by having a more fleshed out model for intermediaries.  Precanned\nsupport for HTTP intermediaries is limited to real time proxying.\nOtherwise you have to get out the power tools and write a gateway by hand,\nwhich is too low level a job for most projects.\n\nRather than argue over the details of what is and isn&#39;t available, lets\nfocus on building.  People are getting the impression -- false IMO -- that\nREST is a religious war.  That&#39;s what Sam Ruby was mainly reacting to, and\nwhat Dave Winer has been ranting about on scripting news.  The kind of\nobscurantia that we&#39;ve been arguing over, e.g. URI opacity, needs to be\nsolved and polished well enough to allow app developers to focus on\napplication needs.  I don&#39;t believe anyone here thinks that&#39;s already\ndone.\n\nMaybe evangelizing is a part of the work.  For example, make the point\nthat service description tools, specifically Visual .NET, apply equally to\nREST development.  So let&#39;s do it.  but let&#39;s not fool ourselves into\nthinking that once somone embraces the one true faith they&#39;ll find full\nfeatured toolkits.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
