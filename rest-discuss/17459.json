Before\nGoogle Web Accelerator came along and deleted everyone&#39;s blogs, forums\nand wikis, using GET to DELETE was quite common.  The REST solution is\nself-descriptive messaging, in HTTP this means PUT has create/replace\nsemantics and PATCH as replacement semantics (or, if you can&#39;t/won&#39;t\nuse PATCH for some reason, use POST), never using GET for unsafe\ninteractions, etc.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
