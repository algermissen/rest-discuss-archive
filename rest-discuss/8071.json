You GET an\n&gt; xform... it runs in an xforms processor driven by an API.\n&gt; Your client interacts with the simple controls via an\n&gt; API. Say &quot;set control x to 1 and set control y to 2, now\n&gt; submit&quot;. The xform hides all the details of the URI\n&gt; template (I don&#39;t think xforms supports full URI\n&gt; templating today but it could with tweaks) and/or the XML\n&gt; format that is POSTed.\n\nHave you seen my proposal [1] to the WHATWG?\n\n&gt; I think both of these alternatives aren&#39;t ideal but in\n&gt; general I feel the idea of hypermedia and/or code on\n&gt; demand for machine to machine interaction is something\n&gt; worth considering. \n\nI completely agree.\n\n&gt; Basically, allow a client to GET\n&gt; something that provides a machine interface to your web\n&gt; application. I don&#39;t expect clients to be &quot;smart&quot; enough\n&gt; to automatically figure out the interface at all. \n\nMaybe not at first, but I don&#39;t see any reason why, via a layering of\ntechnology, they couldn&#39;t be made to be smart enough.\n\n&gt; first GET you&#39;d have to inspect the interface and write\n&gt; the code to work with it. The basic idea though is that\n&gt; the interface you are working with is not the\n&gt; URI+HTTP+form data interface, which is similar to what\n&gt; HTML gives you.\n\nI don&#39;t follow up 100%...\n\n&gt; I know this isn&#39;t even close to a fully baked idea, but\n&gt; what is the downside in the general approach here? When I\n&gt; first started reading about REST this general direction\n&gt; struck me as the &quot;Restful&quot; way to do machine to machine\n&gt; interaction. But nobody seems to be going in this\n&gt; direction. What am I missing?\n\nMight be because of Roy&#39;s influence? I&#39;ve felt he has been a bit dismissive\nof such directions because of (what seems to me to be) a concern REST would\nbe thought of as a specification as opposed to an architectural style? (Roy:\nif I&#39;ve misinterpretted please forgive; I&#39;m just relaying my impressions.)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
