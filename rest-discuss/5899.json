WebDAV supports meta data (properties) \n&gt; on HTTP resources, and *usually* this data is not part of the \n&gt; representation.\n\nThat&#39;s correct, which is one big reason WebDAV is not RESTful.\n\n&gt; People *are* organizing resources in hierarchies, and they *do* assign \n&gt; meta data (properties) to these resources. That use case surely does not \n&gt; apply to each and every web resource, but it does exist, and WebDAV \n&gt; makes it possible to do it through HTTP.\n\nAll that the client sees are URIs. All the client knows are the \nrepresentations returned by the URIs. It is possible to provide metadata \nabout the resources identified by these URIs. One way to do that is by \nRDF. (There are many others.) These metadata resources themselves have \nURIs. This can all be handled through POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET. new \nverbs like WebDAV&#39;s are not necessary to support metadata.\n\nWhy do I believe new verbs are unnecessary for this use case? Because I \ndon&#39;t believe in metadata. More specifically, I don&#39;t believe in the \ndistinction between data and metadata. What&#39;s your metadata may be my \ndata and vice versa. Furthermore what&#39;s my metadata today may be my data \ntomorrow and vice versa. Sometimes I may wish to treat the same resource \nas data, sometimes as metadata. But if it&#39;s all just data why can&#39;t I \njust use my data handling methods (PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE) to handle \nit? Why do I need to a different verb to manipulate the data depending \non whether I happen to be treating it as data or metadata this time? The \nserver doesn&#39;t care what I&#39;m going to do with the data after all.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
