We simply don&#39;t have examples of\nHATEOAS done fully.\nWhy is HATEOAS even worth while?\n\nWhat&#39;s the need for HATEOAS in machine-to-machine APIs?  Existing SOAP and\n&quot;REST&quot; APIs don&#39;t really take advantage of HATEOAS for some reason.  If\nyou&#39;re observing all of the REST constraints but HATEOAS, you&#39;re may not\nhave a RESTful architecture, but you have something tremendously useful.\n\nThe best that I can come up with is that HATEOAS will help long-term\nevolution of APIs, especially the type of intricate fine-grained APIs that\nenterprises favor.  It will also help with &quot;serendipity&quot; - meaning that it&#39;s\neasier in the long run to reuse a distributed REST solution than other types\nof distributed solutions.  While those are interesting benefits, they are\nreally difficult to sell...
