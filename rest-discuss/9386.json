REST defines the response to a request as\n&gt;&gt; a representation of a resource, even if that representation is an error\n&gt;&gt; message, or no conceptual mapping to that resource has been defined.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am talking about RFC2616. You are using RFC2616. The status code in an\n&gt;HTTP/1.1 response is not part of the representation, but a status code.\n&gt;\n\nBut we are talking about the response, not the response code, a hint is \nwhere I use the phrase, &quot;a 404 response is a representation&quot; because I \ndon&#39;t know how the server can send only a response code without sending \nheaders, or on a GET response, an entity body.  To me, the HTML I get \nback from the server with headers and a 404 response code saying &quot;Not \nFound&quot; is a representation.  Are you here to discuss REST or nitpick \nsemantics?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;- the condition is expected to be permanent, and\n&gt;\n&gt;- it&#39;s not necessary to *keep* it marked &quot;gone&quot;; but that doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt;the intent is that it can go back to a 2xx.\n&gt;\n\nDidn&#39;t you start off in this thread by telling me that I was violating \nRFC 2616 by setting a 410 to be a 404?  Am I still wrong about that, \nand if not, would it hurt you to just once concede a point to me, in \nany thread on any list, instead of scouring my posts for obscure \nsemantic inconsistencies (response vs. response code) to nitpick?\n\nTo me, &quot;the discretion of the server owner&quot; means that it&#39;s my URL and I \ncan respond to requests for it however I deem appropriate.  There is no \nmention in the 410 description about the client repeating the request, \nand even the 403 response calls that a SHOULD NOT not a MUST NOT.  So, \nare you sure that I MUST NOT change a 410 into a 200 at my discretion \nas the naming authority?\n\nAre you still insisting that a client, once it knows that a resource has \nresponded 410, can safely expect that no resource will ever again be \nidentified by that URL?  And that I can&#39;t expect a client or intermediary \nto send a DELETE request to the origin server if it knows a resource has \nbeen marked 410 Gone?  Or are you perhaps reading something into the \nspec on the 410 response which means that, although a 410 doesn&#39;t have \nto be permanent, it must remain some sort of 4xx response?  Because I \njust don&#39;t see where the spec supports _any_ of your arguments.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
