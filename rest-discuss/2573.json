First, there are some clients that\n&gt; don&#39;t care about the meaning of asof and will just blindly chase down\n&gt; all of the links. Great: we&#39;ve enabled a different kind of application\n&gt; to do something useful.\nBut I don&#39;t get paid to deliver a different kind of application. (Okay...\nright now I don&#39;t get paid at all...)\nExplicit links are fine - and they do have the nice property of\nopaque/low-intelligence retrievals.\nBut for the main use-case of getting a particular portfolio, the client\nstill needs to know which link is the right link. And that requires knowing\n(in your example) the name &#39;asof&#39; and the value &#39;20020914&#39;. The client pops\nthese two data items into a function and out pops a URI. Either\nalgorithmically constructed or retrieved via a lookup - not much difference,\nexcept that transferring lookup tables isn&#39;t all that scalable and doesn&#39;t\nreduce coupling.\n\n\n&gt; Whereas constructing URIs requires the knowledge\n&gt; that you shouldn&#39;t try to construct URIs into the future or the distant\n&gt; past.\nThat is a &#39;nice-to-have&#39; not a &#39;need-to-have&#39;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, I think that between the client that understands none of the\n&gt; semantics except hyperlinking (e.g. Google) and the client that\n&gt; understands everything there can be clients that use semantic\n&gt; technologies to understand *some things*. For instance maybe I don&#39;t\n&gt; know what a portfolio is but I know what a &quot;date-versioned document&quot; is\n&gt; and I know how to retreive and organize &quot;date-versioned documents&quot;.\nHow would the client &quot;know how to retrieve &#39;date-versioned documents&#39;&quot;?\nIsn&#39;t that what we are talking about?\n\n&gt; It&#39;s pretty easy in the semweb technologies to define the type\n&gt; &quot;data-versioned document&quot; and subtype it to get to &quot;date-versioned\n&gt; portfolio.&quot; I don&#39;t know how to do that with query construction\n&gt; technologies.\nKnowing the type/meaning is not the same as knowing how to retrieve the\ninformation. The &#39;query contruction technologies&#39; is the &#39;how to retrieve&#39;\npart. The semweb technologies you mentioned don&#39;t talk about it. You just\nessentially said &#39;assume I know how to retrieve one&#39;...\n\n\n\n"}}
