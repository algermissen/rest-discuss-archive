It would seem to me that forms are an\n&gt; important part of hypertext navigation, and could be characterized as\n&gt; a user-input-parameterized link, at least with GET-based forms.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\n&gt; However, I was curious if others are in agreement on this perspective.\n\nYes, I guess everyone is :-)\n\n&gt; If a form is a type of link, why does HTML not define a &quot;rel&quot;\n&gt; attribute for forms?\n\nBecause it is argetted towards a human user which can cet the &#39;rel&#39; from\nthe written text. See AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection&gt; and &lt;accept&gt; elements for\na machine readable form.\n\n&gt; OpenSearch [1] also defines navigation to URIs\n&gt; that are parameterized by user-supplied data, but it does include\n&gt; &quot;rel&quot; attribute.\n\nAFAIK, the rel attribute has a slightly different meaning in  \nOpneSearch than it\ndoes in links.\n\n&gt; From a navigational perspective, is there any\n&gt; fundamental difference between HTML form and OpenSearch links (other\n&gt; than that HTML obviously prescribes more of the presentation aspect)?\n\nNo. Only semantic differences.\n\n&gt; If forms can be viewed as link mechanisms, should this only be applied\n&gt; to GET-based forms, or can POST-driven user parametrized data also be\n&gt; considered a form of a navigable link?\n\nIt is equivalent in the sense that it takes you to a next state, but  \nPOST\nrequests are not idempotent and the client must be aware the it  \nchanges the\nstate of the server.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I ask, is I am trying to feel out if the approach in JSON\n&gt; schema, of allowing user-parametrized data submission [2] as an\n&gt; extension of a link definition is appropriate. With this approach,\n&gt; links can include additional information, extending them to take user\n&gt; provided data to form URIs, and specify the request method. IMO, this\n&gt; is an elegant way of minimizing constructs while still allowing for\n&gt; URIs to be parameterized with user input like forms, but I wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; if others felt this would violate any principles of REST.\n\nI&#39;d need to look into that proposal, but can;t right now.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1\n&gt; [2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json- \n&gt; schema-01#section-6.1.1.3\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; - --\n&gt; Kris Zyp\n&gt; SitePen\n&gt; (503) 806-1841\n&gt; http://sitepen.com\n&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt; Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\n&gt; Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; iEYEARECAAYFAktgkW0ACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAwykACdHO/ORNeFFy5g07rzy90MzPSr\n&gt; zPMAoJmmg/UQJizuvys79ULqWfKTKmlY\n&gt; =4uDy\n&gt; -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
