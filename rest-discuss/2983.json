I usually\n&gt; &gt; think of it as meaning indivisible.  Is there such a thing as a\n&gt; &gt; monolithic interface?  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not visualizing this very\n&gt; &gt; well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think of &quot;atomic&quot; as individible. Monolithic means &quot;not \n&gt; divided when \n&gt; it should be.&quot; dictionary.com says: &quot;Constituting or acting \n&gt; as a single, \n&gt; often rigid, uniform whole&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To me, a &quot;monolithic interface&quot; is a network-addressable object that \n&gt; contains many &quot;logical&quot; objects which are not directly addressable \n&gt; themselves. e.g. purchase orders that do not have URIs \n&gt; themselves, but \n&gt; instead have purchase order numbers that must be submitted to the \n&gt; monolitic service in order to manipulate the acutal purchase order. A \n&gt; properly factored service would give each logical object a \n&gt; first-class \n&gt; URI address.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n\nOkay, in that case I&#39;m not going to stand up for monolithic interfaces,\neven as devil&#39;s advocate, but it&#39;s not a bravery issue.  Clean delegation\nis a key design concept.  Now if only my boss understood that...\n\nWalden\n&gt; \n\n"}}
