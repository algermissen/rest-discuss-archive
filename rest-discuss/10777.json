This document contains either revised\n&gt; | information, or else all of the same information plus some new\n&gt; | information, however extensive or brief that new information is;\n&gt; | i.e., this document can be used alone, without reference to the\n&gt; | older document.\n&gt; \n\nSorry, I only meant to use the word &#39;deprecates&#39; not &#39;obsoletes&#39;.  Yes,\nRFC 2068 is obsoleted as a standalone reference for HTTP.  But, if I\nwere to agree with the POV that says obsoletes has the same meaning as\ndeprecates, then I would have to say that RFC 2518 is also &quot;obsoleted&quot;\nby RFC 2616, because RFC 2518 explicitly refers to RFC 2068, not 2616.\n\nAs a reference for HTTP, RFC 2616 may be &quot;used alone without reference\nto the older document&quot;.  But this doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be extended by\nreferring to some other document, older or newer.  Otherwise WebDAV\ncan&#39;t be &quot;part of HTTP&quot;, and RFC 2518 (plus Lord knows how many other\nIETF specs) would require immediate and long-overdue re-editing to\nconform and refer to RFC 2616 instead.\n\nNothing about the release of RFC 2616 would have required existing\nimplementations of PATCH to have been disabled, or rejected by\nintermediaries going forwards.  You just don&#39;t have to implement it.\nSuch a hard-core reinterpretation of the meaning of &#39;obsoletes&#39; goes\nagainst the grain of my experience working with IETF specs over the\nyears, and I&#39;m just not reading that into the paragraph quoted above.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
