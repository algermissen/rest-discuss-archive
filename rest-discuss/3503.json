E.g.,\n\n     GET /host/address/inbox/all\n     DELETE /host/address/inbox/range?message=1-234\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the names used by a\nREST-based server do not need to reflect how the resources are\nimplemented.  The client must remain completely ignorant of the\nimplementation.\n\nNote the use of /host/address above -- you should anticipate that\na single server might be used to handle messages for different MX\nauthorities and each authority will have its own way of assigning\nmailbox accounts, so you want an unambiguous resource namespace.\nIt should not rely on things like the HTTP Host header field\nbecause you don&#39;t want to limit the mailbox server to be on the\nsame IP address as the primary MX name.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
