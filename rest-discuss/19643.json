I agree on the \n&quot;reactive&quot;, however I have doubts about the &quot;REST&quot;. In this particular \ncase, all communication between a client and a server is over persistent \nconnection to a single endpoint. If there&#39;s anything resembling \nresources, they are not identified by URIs. The persistent connection \nIMHO is a case of &quot;conversational&quot; state that REST is rather opposed to. \nNo HATEOAS in sight.\n\nWhat I&#39;m pondering is whether an API can be RESTful and reactive at the \nsame time or if is impossible as a matter of principle. AFAICT, a \nreactive API requires some way for the server to send events to the \nclient. I don&#39;t think polling qualifies, which leaves a persistent \nconnection. In effect, the server has to keep some amount of state for \neach session.\n\nKeeping session state has traditionally been regarded as a hindrance to \nscalability. Has technology advanced so much, eg with asynchronous, \nevent-driven (&quot;reactive&quot;) servers, that this is no longer a problem?\n\nFrankly, I&#39;m lacking experience with systems where this kind of \nscalability would be required, so I&#39;d happily use persistent \nconnections, at least to begin with. Nonetheless, I&#39;m interested in your \ninsights.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n"}}
