That is fine to explain to an RPC developer how to convert that to a RES=\r\nT API, meaning the REST is different approach and required a different desi=\r\ngn approach.

Haven=\r\n&#39;t read it in deep, just over read, and I see first\n&gt; &gt; that we try the API=\r\n as a normal RPC API to begin with. Then we go into\n&gt; &gt; defining what we ne=\r\ned, for instance a data structure, that is not more that\n&gt; &gt; a resource act=\r\nual representation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All that is fine for me, but I feel it needs th=\r\ne mapping explanation. Since\n&gt; &gt; I come from the architectural side, I woul=\r\nd start by defining why we need\n&gt; &gt; the API, and how the API is RESTFull in=\r\n the REST sense. Then I may come with\n&gt; &gt; this regular API and explain what=\r\n changes should I make to create a RESTFull\n&gt; &gt; one. Then I explain what th=\r\ne resources would be (a data dictionary fits\n&gt; &gt; fine), and then the possib=\r\nle representations (structure) and then etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is more work, I k=\r\nnow, and probably a developer wants to have the code\n&gt; &gt; to just copy paste=\r\n, but if we intend to teach about REST I would suggest to\n&gt; &gt; include the w=\r\nhat (concept) and then the how (in dev terms). In other words,\n&gt; &gt; do not r=\r\neplace, add.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Will read it in calm and post more about it later.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomares\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@y=\r\nahoogroups.com &lt;rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Tim\n&gt; &gt; Williams &lt;williams=\r\ntw@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2010/4/6 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re going to be pissed with me because I didn&#39;t even read th=\r\ne entire\n&gt; &gt; article (I&#39;ll do it at home\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tonigth) but after reading=\r\n this sentence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this API will define a simple list manageme=\r\nnt service.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and since I just said in another post that IMO=\r\n &quot;API&quot; and &quot;service&quot;\n&gt; &gt; should not be used to describe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST, I tri=\r\ned this simple semantic analysis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CTRL+F resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and no single result was found!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, should a descrip=\r\ntion of a REST-something have more emphasis in\n&gt; &gt; &quot;resources&quot; rather than\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;services&quot;?
