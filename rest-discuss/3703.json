Seems like \n&gt; if the list *does* change,  returning the URIs gives the client a\nway to \n&gt; retrieve those items later even if the query no longer returns them \n&gt; (e.g. a discontinued item). If the list *doesn&#39;t* change, any advantage \n&gt; to returning URIs rather than the representations seems a little less \n&gt; obvious... and then if you bring performance back into the calculation, \n&gt; returning URIs implies at least another round trip.\n\nIt all depends on your application requirements. There is a general\npattern here which I&#39;ve seen a number of times. One possible solution\nyou have not mentioned is to return a list of items *together* with\nthe URIs that can be used to address those items individually - then\nyou get all the advantages of both approaches.\n\nThis is an example what I think of as a container GET pattern - do you\nserailise the contents of the container, or just return a list of\npointers to each contained resource?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to anyone who can comment on this issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hugh\n\n\n"}}
