That&#39;s unnecessarily sharp. I&#39;ve worked with Marc on\nthe URI Template spec and he&#39;s smart, easy to work with, and in\nno way deserves this kind of personal attack.\n\n&gt;  I hope we can derail this completely, but we probably can&#39;t. If not, are\n&gt;  there any JSR members here who might join the working group and bring\n&gt;  some sanity and actual REST experience to the development of the\n&gt;  eventual specification? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we can at least limit\n&gt;  the damage.\n\nI *do* have my concerns about the process and the end results of\na JSR with the term REST attached to it, only because\nI can imagine a near future where the &quot;definition&quot; of REST to the\naverage Java programmer is anything you can build with a JSR 311 library,\nand the converse, that anything you can&#39;t build with a JSR 311 library\nis not RESTful.\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
