Providing \nPOST-queries allows for easy access, because it is part of HTTP/1.1, but \nif you already use POST for &#39;create new resource&#39;, then you&#39;re actually \noverloading it, which is in theory not a good idea. Queries through the \nSEARCH or REPORT method are pretty RESTfully, but it&#39;s a disadvantage \nthat they are not available in standard API&#39;s, which makes it a little \nbit more difficult for clients to access.\n\nProviding them both allows clients to choose to be very RESTful, or very \nlazy ;)\n\n\nCreating a &#39;query resource&#39; has the disadvantage of having to do two \nrequests. And if the query resource is not a part of your logical \nresource domain, then it&#39;s a bit ugly to me to create a resource for it.\n\nThis topic has already been adressed on this mailinglist \n(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10721). Maybe \nyou can find some more interesting ways to address this problem in that \ndiscussion.\n\n\nAristotle Pagaltzis schreef:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Benoît Fleury &lt;benoit.fleury@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:benoit.fleury%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; [2008-11-21 19:05]:\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering what the preferred approach to make complex\n&gt; &gt; queries over HTTP? I have to provide data in the request body\n&gt; &gt; (It could be a xml description or even an image). The request\n&gt; &gt; is safe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Put in a layer of indirection: let people create a “query asset”\n&gt; by POSTing the body data in a separate request, producing a\n&gt; resource whose URI can be included in the actual query request\n&gt; that they then send as a GET.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The response can&#39;t be cached since it depends on the\n&gt; &gt; request body.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are begging the question: you gave no reason for why the\n&gt; response is inherently uncacheable. The specification of GET\n&gt; and POST is not inherent to your problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, the URL does not have to be shared.\n&gt;\n&gt; Better to engineer for serendipity and not decide this up front.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/ &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n-- \nBarbara Van De Keer\n\nGhent University - IBBT\nFaculty of Engineering\nDepartment of Electronics and Information Systems\nMultimedia Lab\nGaston Crommenlaan 8 bus 201, B-9050 Ledeberg-Ghent, Belgium\n\nt: +32 9 33 14959\nf: +32 9 33 14896\nt secr: +32 9 33 14911\ne: barbara.vandekeer@...\n\nURL: http://multimedialab.elis.ugent.be\n\n\n"}}
