RFC 2396.\n\n&gt; If you PUT /foo/bar?baz, does that create a\n&gt; container?\n&gt; How about PUT http://objectname.domain.com?\n&gt;\n&gt; My claim at this point is that (ignorning WebDAV)\n&gt; URLs tell you nothing about containment relations.\n\nThen you are talking about storage containment, which is irrelevant\nto REST.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   My answer: DELETE /container\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.\n&gt;&gt; The server might tell you to delete the children first.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is actually related to the question I didn&#39;t\n&gt; ask.  What happens when you GET a container?  I\n&gt; think that GET on a container isn&#39;t standardized\n&gt; because, again, HTTP URLs are not defined to have\n&gt; containment relations.  I think for WebDAV to\n&gt; specify DELETE in this context without\n&gt; constraining GET is weird.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: If GET were specified on a containe, we\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t need index.html files.\n\nHuh?  index.html files are an implementation mechanism for providing\na representation for the ancestor/ name, which most people call a\ncollection (of names).  That is not a container.\n\n&gt;&gt; BTW, why do you switch from &quot;collection&quot; to &quot;container&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; We are talking implicitly about containment\n&gt; relationships.  A directory contains other files,\n&gt; it does not collect them.\n\nYou used both words interchangeably.  Traditionally, a container is a\nstorage component that contains other addressable items, whereas a\ncollection is a list of addressable items independent of storage.\nContainers are represented by an aggregation of its contents.\nA collection is represented by a list of names and related information.\n\nIn REST, a &quot;directory&quot; can be presented as two different resources --\ncontainer or collection -- only by providing different identifiers\nfor each purpose.\n\n&gt; Note: If you want to use collection, then I would\n&gt; observe that to delete a name for the collection\n&gt; is not to delete the members of the collection.\n&gt;\n&gt; And to DELETE a URL is really only to DELETE a\n&gt; name.\n\nMore assumptions about the implementation.  The method only signifies\nthe action desired by the user agent.  How that is accomplished is left\nto the server implementation.  Some implementations will have garbage\ncollection, others will delete on last reference removed, and still\nothers will refuse a delete until the namespace is empty.  In any case,\nthe client cannot delete the URI -- it can only see and manipulate the\nrepresentation, and all it expects from the origin server is that the\nold representation is no longer available once the DELETE succeeds.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
