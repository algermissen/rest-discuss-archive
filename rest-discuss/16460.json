Quoting Roy, &quot;Self-descriptive means\nthat the type is registered and the registry points to a specification\nand the specification explains how to process the data according to its\nintent.&quot;\n\nOn the Web, only one such registry exists -- if your identifier isn&#39;t\nin IANA, it isn&#39;t registered, by definition of HTTP.  On your intranet,\nnobody cares whether your specification is standardized, let alone\nregistered with IANA, for REST or HTTP (which, even then, still\n&quot;discourages&quot; the practice).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve claimed that REST encourages anything of the sort,\n&gt; but it also doesn&#39;t *prevent* you from doing something that is merely\n&gt; discouraged - which is exactly what you are implying when you state\n&gt; &quot;you MUST use some standardized media type that exists in the IANA\n&gt; registry&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nStill has nothing to do with me.  Quoting Roy, &quot;REST components\ncommunicate by transferring a representation of a resource in a format\nmatching one of an evolving set of standard data types.&quot;  And, &quot;A\nstandard is an approved measure against which multiple independent\norganizations have agreed (by choice or by force) to have their\nproducts tested for compliance.&quot;\n\nOn the Web, your _registered_ identifier MUST point to an approved\nstandard, by definition of REST -- where in REST do people get the idea\nthat unstandardized media types are OK?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Using a non-registered media type identifier is not violating any REST\n&gt; constraint, or HTTP stipulation. By choosing to do something that HTTP\n&gt; discourages you are incurring risk, but that doesn&#39;t render your\n&gt; application &quot;not REST&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nOnce again, don&#39;t separate my point from its context, which is the Web.\nWhat you say may be true within the confines of an intranet, but it is\nclearly not the case on the Web, where only one registry exists for\nidentifiers, and any standards body will do for types.  If you&#39;re doing\nREST on the Web, you MUST use an IANA-registered identifier which\ncorresponds to a standardized type, because no other alternatives are\ndefined by HTTP or allowed by REST.\n\nWhich has everything to do with what Roy says, and nothing to do with\nwhat I say, so please stop trying to personalize this, and explain to\nme why Roy is wrong -- those quotes above couldn&#39;t be more clear.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
