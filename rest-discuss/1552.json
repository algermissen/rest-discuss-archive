GETing, PUTing,\nand\n&gt; DELETEing methods act on the resource itself.\n\nThis is very cool and is very much what I was getting at.  I can&#39;t wait to\nsee it.\n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not clear to me how you can copy a method. After all, the real\n&gt; &gt; method is the programming code behind it. And that code will\n&gt; &gt; depend on a complex network of other state. So PUT-ting to a method\n&gt; &gt; resource doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry about that - I&#39;ll clarify.  One thing I forgot to write into my\noriginal\n&gt; method example was a &quot;localHost&quot; property that references the component\nwhere\n&gt; the implementation of the method is hosted.  So if you merely copy the\nmethod\n&gt; resource, it then exists in a new container but references the same\n&gt; implementation.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; I agree with you, PUTing to a method resource doesn&#39;t make sense. Instead,\nyou\n&gt; would want to PUT the method to a container.  Is that more clear?  Like\nRoger, I\n&gt; want to make sure my work reflects resolve on these issues.\n\nThis is an interesting concept.  And I also agree that if you are trying to\nmake &quot;copy&quot; the semantics of PUTing to a URI, that URI should represent a\ncontainer of object for which the method would act.  However, I think this\ncreates a conflict with a normal semantics of PUTing to a noun resource.\n\nNot being certain how often one would want to copy method code to another\nnode in this way, I would say that it might not be worth the trouble to\nsupport this semantic for PUTing to a verb/method URI.  A nice idea, though.\n\n\nAgain, please let us know when you&#39;re ready to reveal your toolkit as I am\nquite interested in how it works.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
