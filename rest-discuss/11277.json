My idea is to create a resource\nlike /newEvent. Now the client sends a GET request to this method and\nthe server answers only when there is a new event. As long as there are\nno new events the connection stays open and the client waits until it\ngets a response or is terminated (timeouts are configured as needed).\n\nI can&#39;t decide if this is RESTful and doesn&#39;t violate HTTPs GET\nsemantics. RFC 2616 says the server can reply to a GET request by doing\nsome processing operation first. But I don&#39;t think this was meant in a\nway that it waits just indefinitely and sends the response at some\nrandom point in time. But I&#39;m not quite sure about that.\n\nA purely RESTful way would be to do something similar to the listener\npattern by using a small webserver on the client and sending a POST\nto /listeners on the server with the URI on the clients webserver that\nhas to be called as listener. This POST could then register a new\nlistener on the server that&#39;s available under a URI\nlike /listeners/[1-9]+ . Whenever there is a new event the server would\nthen send a POST or PUT to the URI to the clients webserver that was\nregistered as the listener. Unfortunately many firewalls will block\nthis.\n\nAny comments on the RESTfulness of the first idea? Any better ideas?\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nAndreas\n\n\n"}}
