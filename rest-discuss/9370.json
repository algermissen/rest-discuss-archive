If the semantics of the \ninteraction are &quot;move resource A to URL B&quot; then resource A should be \nPUT to URL B, then URL A deleted or set to redirect to URL B.  This \n&quot;move resource A to URL B&quot; interaction semantic can also be modeled \nusing WebDAV, which includes a MOVE method, IIRC.\n\nIf you want to implement interaction semantics for which no method \nexists in HTTP, then you use POST -- but the result is more like an \nRPC method where the POSTed entity contains instructions on how to \nmove resource A to URL B, then delete (or redirect) URL A.  So, to \nmeet the REST constraint for the generic connector, either use a \nmethod which reflects the actual semantics of the interaction as a \nwhole (perhaps by using a protocol which already includes a MOVE \nmethod), or devise a means to achieve the same result using the \nmethods described by the protocol in use, constrained to the \nsemantics of a REST connector.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;FWIW, reading RFC 2616 ยง14.30, it seems a Location header can be\n&gt;given with any response, so I suppose you could instead say\n&gt;\n\nAgain, HTTP is not REST.  Just because RFC 2616 allows a Location \nheader to be sent with any response doesn&#39;t mean that response won&#39;t \nbreak the Uniform Interface constraint of REST.  You have to look at \nthe semantics of the interaction taken as a whole, if those semantics \nare &quot;move&quot; then implement it with MOVE using WebDAV, or if you are \nlimited to using HTTP then make it a two-step operation using PUT \nand DELETE instead of tunneling &quot;move&quot; semantics through DELETE or \neven POST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The fact remains that this design does not have problems with\n&gt;idempotency nor does it require as much hardwired knowledge\n&gt;about the specific semantics of your protocol from clients\n&gt;(aka REST-RPC hybrid).\n&gt;\n\nBut it does require the server connector to understand the semantics \nof DELETE to mean something other than &quot;remove&quot; in addition to meaning \n&quot;remove&quot; depending on the URL the DELETE request is sent to, or some \nother shared knowledge between client and server.  In my setup, the \nresponse to a DELETE request is straightforward -- the status of the \nresource changes to reflect the request, no matter what client is \nmaking the DELETE.  The optional, sysadmin-only second DELETE does \nrequire knowledge of the specific protocol in that it must have an \nIf-Match header, but the semantics of making such a DELETE request \nare still &quot;remove&quot;, which doesn&#39;t break the Uniform Interface \nconstraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
