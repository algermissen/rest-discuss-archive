It will definitely be useful.\n\nIn term=\r\ns of the ANSI/IEEE 1471 approach, the document doesn&#39;t seem to \ndifferentia=\r\nte architectural views from the different viewpoints that it \nenumerates in=\r\n the intended audience section and it doesn&#39;t express a distinct \nmodel for=\r\n each view. To get a sense of what I&#39;m looking for, the wikipedia \narticle =\r\non 1471 may be helpful, especially the entity model diagram. See:\nhttp://en=\r\n.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1471 and \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEEECo=\r\nnceptualFramework4ArchitectureDescription.png\n\n\nI did find one of the refer=\r\nences cited was a little closer to what I was looking \nfor, a paper by Fiel=\r\nding and Taylor:\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf=\r\n\n\nThis expresses three views of a RESTful system: process, connector, and d=\r\nata. \nThis caused me to relook at Fielding&#39;s dissertation, which has the sa=\r\nme \ncontent.  It&#39;s interesting to compare these to the OASIS reference arch=\r\nitecture \nfor SOA (link in the thread root), which provides models for arch=\r\nitectural views \nfrom three viewpoints: that of the service ecosystem (the =\r\n&quot;business&quot; view), that \nof realizing the SOA (ie the implementer&#39;s viewpoin=\r\nt), and that of the SOA owner \n(ie IT management). \n\n\nI suspect that the di=\r\nfference in viewpoints are the reason that people versed in \nREST and peopl=\r\ne versed in SOA seem so often to talk passed each other. REST as \nan archit=\r\nectural style is simply not expressed in terms remotely close to those \ntha=\r\nt describe the service ecosystem viewpoint and IT ownership viewpoint that =\r\n\nOASIS used to express a SOA reference architecture. \n\n\n___________________=\r\n_____________\nFrom: Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\nTo: Bryan Tay=\r\nlor &lt;bryan_w_taylor@...&gt;\nCc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sat, =\r\nJuly 31, 2010 5:30:44 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful Reference Arch=\r\nitectures?\n\n  \nBryan,\n\nOn Aug 1, 2010, at 12:27 AM, Bryan Taylor wrote:\n\n&gt; =\r\nHas anybody written or come across a documented RESTful Reference Architect=\r\nure? \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for something comparable to The OASIS RA for SOA, b=\r\nut obviously \n&gt; more specific to a RESTful architecture.
