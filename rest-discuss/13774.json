HATEOAS seem to be key, but how do you document the  \n=\r\n&gt; relationship between the resources linked? Most seem to use URI  \n&gt; templ=\r\nates, but depending on them doesn&#39;t seem to be RESTful. WSDL/WADL  \n&gt; are o=\r\nk as specifications, but what do you guys think?\n\nI think a key distinction=\r\n to make is the documentation of an interface and the documentation of a se=\r\nrvice. The client should only depend on the documentation of your interface=\r\n, which should be in the form of media types and link relations (and maybe =\r\nsemantic identifiers in the media type like categories or microformats -- n=\r\not ideal but sometimes necessary). \n\nYou will also need to document a servi=\r\nce to build it -- here you need to specify things like the URIs and what ki=\r\nnds of resources they reference, how to represent each resource in the medi=\r\na type etc. Something like WADL can formalize this and help with tooling et=\r\nc. but isn&#39;t the only option.\n\nAn analogy is the specification of HTML and =\r\nthe specification of a web site.\n\nThat&#39;s my take anyways.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
