Where N at the moment is 2 or 3, but M is a lot.\n\n&gt; Isn&#39;t the conflict management &#39;just&#39; a standard scenario for the need of two phase commits in order to reliably solve the problem?\n\nPretty much.\n\n&gt; With the note of course that it is not doable in reality and that you just have to live with the uncertaintees? E.g. accept &#39;overbooking&#39; and over compensation payment to those that did order but not received and goods?\n&gt;\n\nThe overbooking will be known and can be communicated well before\ncompensation payments would be required.\n\n&gt; Do you think that the application of REST (or anything else) to the problem changes anything?\n\nREST does not solve the problem but the REST constraints affect the\nproblem.  And I don&#39;t mean in the sense of &quot;dogmatic rules that must\nbe obeyed&quot;, but in the sense that this problem will exist on the open\nWeb and thus runs into the problems of coordination over an\nuntrustworthy network.\n\nSo I am interested in &quot;the best that can practically be done&quot; rather\nthan absolute uncertainty.  In those terms, compensation payments is\nnot the best that can be done.  Some form of optimistic order taking\nwith conflict notification seems possible.\n\nWhich will leave the problem of how to get the various sites to agree\non the order handling procedure, which will not be easy either.\n\n"}}
