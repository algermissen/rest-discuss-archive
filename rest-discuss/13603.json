Roughly, REST distinguishes two  \n&gt; types of URIs:\n&gt; &quot;entry point&quot; type URIs, which may be bookmarked indefinitely.  \n&gt; These are Cool URIs.\n&gt; &quot;transitional&quot; type URIs, which may not be bookmarked indefinitely.  \n&gt; These are unCool URIs. I call then &quot;transitional&quot; given that their  \n&gt; role is typically to enable transition to the next state.\n\nNo, REST has no such distinctions.  They might occur in practice,\nbut that is neither here nor there.  REST does not distinguish them.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not wedded to the names (you could call them internal/ \n&gt; external), but I do think this distinction between types of URIs is  \n&gt; an important aspect of REST that, so far, has not been clearly  \n&gt; outlined. It certainly seems to be in play in the permathread  \n&gt; debates regarding whether &quot;URIs should be RESTful or not&quot; (and  \n&gt; whether that designation is even a meaningful one). I also think  \n&gt; the distinction is a bit at odds with the common understanding of  \n&gt; URIs on the Web that ANY URI should be a bookmarkable URI, ie that  \n&gt; ALL URIs should strive to be Cool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to make such a distinction, but acknowledge that such a  \n&gt; distinction goes against the Web ethos that ALL URIs should be cool  \n&gt; (ie should not change) not just entry point URIs.\n\nUmm, all of my URIs are cool *and* entry point URIs.  TimBL&#39;s point\nwas that cool URIs do not change, not that all URIs are cool.\n\n&gt; In other words, REST seems to imply that only entry point URIs need  \n&gt; be cool, while Web Architecture implies that ALL URI should be  \n&gt; cool. Someone should justify the (sexual) tension between these  \n&gt; principles.\n\nI still don&#39;t see where you are deriving these ideas.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
