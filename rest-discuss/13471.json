But preferring HTTP link headers \n&gt; over links in your hypermedia format seems backwards to me. It goes \n&gt; against the established practice of the Web doesn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; It also seems like the first step in collapsing the protocol space down \n&gt; to just HTTP. REST allows other protocols (e.g. FTP and in the future \n&gt; Waka?) to be used. Isn&#39;t that in part why the URI starts with a scheme \n&gt; identifier? Pulling the links out of the hypermedia and into the \n&gt; protocol headers makes it harder to use your hypermedia format with \n&gt; other protocols and is in conflict with some of the design principles of \n&gt; the web, exemplified by URI, no?\n&gt; \n\nA couple of things:\n\n* Link headers aren&#39;t only useful for representation formats that don&#39;t \nsupport linking.  They also help clients that don&#39;t know (or care) how \nto process the relationships to a resource, but do know how to \nmanipulate the relationships.  For the situation where the client \ndoesn&#39;t care what the representation is and is only interested in the \nrelationships, it can just do a HEAD request to obtain the metadata.\n\n* IMO, there&#39;s no reason that a link relationship couldn&#39;t be published \nboth as a LInk header and embedded within the representation.\n\n* IMO, the established practices of the web were done to solve the \nissues with the human interactions with a browser.  The programmatic web \nwhere your clients are machines will need different ways to consume the \nsame data so that it can efficiently operate.\n\n* Finally, links are metadata.  Other established headers define \nmetadata about the resource as well (ETag, Last-Modified for instance). \nWhy not just one more?\n\nBill\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
