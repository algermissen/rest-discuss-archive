Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think the question is, what is HTTP&#39;s reasoning for having both\n&gt; the 404 and the 410 response codes?  I am merely following a\n&gt; SHOULD directive in the standard -- it isn&#39;t just my implementation\n&gt; that&#39;s unorthodox, the whole notion of using 410 responses and\n&gt; the DELETE method is pretty unorthodox at this point in time as\n&gt; nobody really uses either, or the DELETE implementation is entirely\n&gt; pedestrian in nature when it is used.  I am aiming for a richer\n&gt; application which makes the fullest use of HTTP possible.\n\nNo, I know why HTTP has different response codes. I was just curious\nwhat that meant in your specific case... why your case used the\nconditions that lead to 404 and 410 and such.\n\n\n&gt; OK, but the original suggestion was to PUT a zero-byte file, which is\n&gt; a direct &quot;remove&quot; operation on my implementation, so in relation to\n&gt; my implementation that would not be a RESTful solution.\n\nYeah, I don&#39;t like that suggestion just because a zero-byte file feels\nmore like a mistake. Even if that&#39;s what the server ends up with.\n\nI don&#39;t, on the other hand, have an objection to a PUT resulting in a\nresource moving (as gets mentioned elsewhere in the thread). Sometimes\nthat means that the &quot;location&quot; shouldn&#39;t have been part of the URL,\nbut sometimes you just can&#39;t get around it. For instance, if you PUT a\nnew username to a user&#39;s profile, Wirebird moves the profile. I&#39;m\ncertainly not going to let a client, even one with moderator access,\neffectively take the user off the system... what if something happens\nbetween then and the POST to the new username?\n\n&gt; I only deem anything &quot;un-RESTful&quot; if I can specifically explain what\n&gt; REST constraint in particular has been broken, and how, and why it\n&gt; should not be.  For example, any application that uses PUT to impose\n&gt; &quot;merge&quot; semantics is, by my thinking, inherently un-RESTful because\n&gt; the uniform interface constraint requires PUT to mean replace, and\n&gt; I&#39;ve fully detailed my position.  Nobody has to be a 100% expert on\n\nI haven&#39;t found a merge situation that couldn&#39;t be solved by reframing\nthe bits of the resource that are being merged into resources\n(represtations? I can never remember. Things What Have URLs, in any\nevent) in their own right. Not saying it doesn&#39;t happen, but yeah.\n\n"}}
