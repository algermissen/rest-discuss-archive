The\n&gt; client asks f=\r\nor data in JSON-format from the server using a RESTful  \n&gt; URL\n&gt; structure,=\r\n and present it in the UI. All is well.\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;RESTful URL s=\r\ntructure&quot;?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I&#39;m facing the problem of figuring out what the user is=\r\n allowed to\n&gt; do with the data, both based on security (=3Ddoes the user ha=\r\nve the\n&gt; correct role) and state (=3Dis an action valid given the state). W=\r\nith an\n&gt; HTML client this would be easy, since then the HTML could change\n&gt;=\r\n depending on these things.\n\nThe JSON can simply change as well based on th=\r\ne provilidges the user  \nhas.\n\n&gt; In my situation, where the client just get=\r\ns\n&gt; JSON-data, it seems to me that I have to extend my usage of JSON so  \n&gt;=\r\n that\n&gt; I can get both the data to view, and a list of what actions the cli=\r\nent\n&gt; is allowed to perform, and then enable/disable UI elements  \n&gt; accord=\r\ningly.\n\nYou should include Authentication information with the request and =\r\n \ndetermine on that basis what JSON to return. The JSON should drive the  \n=\r\nUI with regard to the available actions (=3D=3Dnext possible transitions  \n=\r\nin the application by the user through your UI).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Something like this w=\r\nould be sent from the server:\n&gt; {&quot;commands&quot;:[&quot;cmd1&quot;,&quot;cmd2],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;b=\r\nar&quot;}}\n\nWell, maybe - if you think of &#39;cmd&#39; in terms of &#39;next transition&#39;. I=\r\nf  \nyou UI reacts on the cmds received that would be good.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; With the ab=\r\nove I can both get the data I need to show, and know what  \n&gt; the\n&gt; user is=\r\n allowed to do with it.\n\nI think that is ok, if you context prevents simple=\r\nr solutions (e.g.  \nuse HTML+browser in the first place).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone =\r\ndone this? Or should I skip directly to XHTML instead and  \n&gt; use\n&gt; &lt;a&gt;&#39;s t=\r\no let the client know what it can do? And if so, how would the\n&gt; data be be=\r\nst transferred (key/value data)?\n\nWhy did you not create an HTML based UI?\n=\r\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Any tips would be appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; /Rickard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
