That \nmakes\n&gt; the *interaction* stateless, which is the important thing.\n\nThanks.  I understand your position vs statelessness.\n\nBut do you think sessions are *necessary*?\nOr can they (always or usually) be replaced by Web resources?\nAnd is that transformation (always or usually) better?\n\nWe discussed this once before, in the context of EDI-mailbox-style \nSOAP, where messages have &quot;conversation&quot; and &quot;transaction&quot; tags.\nIn that discussion, (I think) we agreed that these tags could be \nreplaced by making the subjects of the conversation into Web \nresources with URIs.  \n\nAnd that there were advantages to the transformation: from one \ncentralized mailbox with a dispatcher, to individual addresses for \neach conversational subject.\n\nI&#39;m trying to explore whether REST yields a better/simpler \narchitecture for the problems that sessions and conversation tags \nwere supposed to solve.\n\n\n"}}
