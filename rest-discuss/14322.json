Consider\nupdating the atom:copyright of every Atom document in a system.  The\nexisting protocol interaction is GET-PUT, whereas this change could be\nmade using a much lighter-weight HEAD-PATCH interaction.  The new media\ntype would need to be extensible in the same way as Atom, while\nlimiting its scope by treating the contents of many elements as CDATA.\n\nThe point being, it&#39;s hard enough work to extend an existing media\ntype, let alone create a new one.  You may wind up having to develop\nsomething else, in order to make a proposal, like I would have to do by\ncoming up with application/atomdiff+xml before I could get my desired\nmedia type of applicaton/atomcat+xml standardized as a diff format to\nPATCH Atom content.  Forging ahead without a standardization effort is\nso much easier, that it constitutes an architectural cop-out in REST.\n\nThe Internet and the Web are wide-open due to standardization winning\nout over proprietariness.  The REST style is not only derived from the\nstandardization process, it was also used to guide that process, and it\nis meant to foster the ongoing wide-open nature of the Internet and the\nWeb by promoting the use of standard methods, media types, and link\nrelations over proprietary this-system-only designs -- since that&#39;s\nwhat allowed the Web to flourish in the first place.  The crucible of\nthe Web made the REST style what it is, because that&#39;s what worked.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
