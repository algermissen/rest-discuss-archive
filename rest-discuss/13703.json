But \n&gt; it&#39;s not, unless that hipermedia &quot;drives&quot; the states changes, if it&#39;s \n&gt; the &quot;engine&quot; of such state changes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or in Roy Fielding words, &quot;The problem is that just being connected is \n&gt; not enough (...) hypertext as the engine of hypermedia state is also \n&gt; about late binding of application alternatives that guide the client \n&gt; through whatever it is that we are trying to provide as a service.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So the constraint is well described as &quot;hypermedia as the engine of \n&gt; application state&quot;. HATEOAS is just for short. Like the name of the \n&gt; country located between Mexico and Canada is called United States of \n&gt; America. Now you could dislike call it USA, and you can call it just \n&gt; America, but this last term is ambiguous, it can be a country or a \n&gt; continent or a musical band... Even if you refer to it as &quot;America \n&gt; country&quot; (like in &quot;Hipermedia constraint&quot;), will it be America the \n&gt; country or any other country in America the continent? Or even a a \n&gt; music called &quot;country&quot; performed by America?\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Linkability&quot;, &quot;Connectedness&quot;, &quot;hipermedia constraint&quot;, &quot;links as \n&gt; state transitions&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia Describes Protocols&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia \n&gt; constrains protocols&quot;...  Well, &quot;a rose by any other name would smell \n&gt; as sweet&quot;...\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the other thread for those who don&#39;t remember it\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12730\n&gt;\n&gt; (Just to clarify, I didn&#39;t say that there were a consensus to &quot;leave \n&gt; that alone&quot; as you wrongly imply in your post.

Nobody knows where &quot;HATEOAS&quot; came from or\n&gt;&gt; who started it or anything, so I doubt anyone will be offended if we\n&gt;&gt; drop the silly acronym.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Eric\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HATEOAS is starting to appear everywhere....\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just me but I think that the term HATEOAS is detrimental\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in at least two ways. It has the negative connotation of having HATE\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside it and also covers what is one of the most important aspects\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of REST &#39;hypermedia&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I therefore make the serious proposal to burry HATEOAS and actively\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use &#39;hypermedia constraint&#39; instead before its too late.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any supporters?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
