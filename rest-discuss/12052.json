After all, HTTP is really the RESTful protocol being used, so the verbs\n&gt; are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and even though the URL has verbs in it,\n&gt; it&#39;s still just the address for the resource, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; I can, however, see the argument against verbs in the URL (I think), since\n&gt; the implication is that the URLs then become the API to the application,\n&gt; causing a diversity of actions, rather than a diversity of resources. Is\n&gt; this the main argument against using verbs in the URL?\n\nYep. If your URLs describe a suite of actions, with parameters in the\nquery string, then you&#39;re just building a RPC application. You&#39;re\ndefining a custom interface for making your app do things, rather than\nsticking to the uniform interface defined by HTTP.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Ben\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
