Only the consumer, i.e. the human or machine user, needs to\nknow those specifics -- what&#39;s referred to as domain-specific\nvocabulary.  Such vocabulary can be linked, or embedded (RDFa).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; application/xhtml+xml doesn&#39;t tell the program what the payload is\n&gt; (beyond a general sense -- it&#39;s XHTML).\n&gt; application/vnd.example.purchaseorder+xml is (ideally) much more\n&gt; specific.\n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s actually less specific.  I&#39;ve never heard of that vnd.* media\ntype, it isn&#39;t common knowledge.  So to me (or an intermediary), it&#39;s\njust application/xml, which tells me nothing by comparison to\napplication/xhtml+xml.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In theory, I can find the &quot;public&quot; document describing the\n&gt; application/vnd.example.purchaseorder+xml to learn the semantics of\n&gt; how that data is used.\n&gt;\n\nMaybe.  But not if the public document is just a schema, then you know\nnothing about rendering the purchase order beyond what application/xml\ntells you (which is nothing).  If it&#39;s a well-designed media type, then\nit will re-invent the wheel of expressing a data table horizontally.\nBut is that really well-designed?  Not to me, no, because it isn&#39;t doing\nanything the ubiquitous HTML media types weren&#39;t designed to do.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But I can&#39;t do the same with application/xhtml+xml. Instead I have to\n&gt; reflect upon the internal structure of the payload to see if it\n&gt; happens to be something that I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt;\n\nI disagree.  If I&#39;m developing a purchase-order payload, by starting\nwith application/xhtml+xml I can first design something that *looks*\nlike a purchase order.  While tables may be abused for presentation, if\nthe data is tabular, then laying it out as a table is structural --\nwhat the table looks like (cellpadding, borders/rules etc.), its\npresentation, is handled by CSS.\n\nNow that I have an HTML document which looks like a purchase order\nbecause it&#39;s structured like a purchase order, I can then proceed to\nannotate it to conform to whatever domain-specific vocabulary I choose\n(i.e. GoodRelations).  Bingo!  Human- and machine- readable.  Even if\nit&#39;s not meant for human consumption, it&#39;s eminently debuggable and\nmaintainable by humans because it&#39;s self-documenting.\n\nWhen a system based on application/vnd.example.purchaseorder+xml breaks\ndown, the human fixing it isn&#39;t pulling up a document that looks like a\npurchase order, making things that much harder to debug -- talk about\nhaving to reflect on the internals of the data -- not to mention\ndevelop in the first place. There is nothing about the data structure\nof a purchase order that can&#39;t be modeled in HTML + RDFa.\n\nYou may have some internal system where an application-specific media\ntype is better suited.  Fine.  But if your goal is to use that resource\nas part of a Web system, then there&#39;s every reason to convert it into a\nubiquitous media type such that anyone can decipher your API with a\nbrowser and &#39;view source&#39;.  It is a benefit of the REST style that\nyou can pull up your representations in a browser to debug them.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps dredging for microformats or links or RDFa hints, and\n&gt; basically hoping I&#39;ll find what I&#39;m looking for (i.e. the client sent\n&gt; not just application/xhtml+xml, but a document containing\n&gt; Interesting Things that I&#39;m looking for).\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s exactly how it&#39;s done.  None of the things covered in the\nGoodRelations ontology *matter* to intermediaries or user agents, only\nto the user.  Since the domain-specific vocabulary is agreed upon by\nuser and provider, it goes inside the payload and is not exposed at the\nprotocol level.  All those common-knowledge things, like recognizing\nthe horizontal layout of tabular-structure data, the name/value pairs\nrepresented by that structure, etc. are what belong in the media type.\n\nAt the protocol level, *that* a payload consists of name/value pairs is\nof interest, not *what* those name/value pairs represent, if you catch\nmy drift.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you resolve this kind of conflict when the common, standard\n&gt; type are extremely generic and you want to use them for a specific\n&gt; domain?\n&gt; \n\nBy not seeing it as a conflict.  Standard and RDFa metadata attributes\ncan annotate the generic semantics of HTML with the specific semantics\nof (most) any problem domain.  Every vendor of online shopping carts\nhas a different take on marking up the same problem space.  This is not\nas large a problem as it once seemed, because the GoodRelations ontology\nis proliferating, and with it, interoperability.\n\nBringing me back to my toilet-paper-resupply analogy.  It becomes\ntrivial to write an agent which regularly orders my preferred brand,\ncolor and scent of TP at best price from a list of supplier websites.\nAll these sites have different markup, but it&#39;s the-same-enough that\nagents can easily glean the item number, then use it to fill out the\n&#39;item&#39; and &#39;quantity&#39; fields of an order form -- provided that the\nvendors have all agreed to the same domain-specific vocabulary by\nannotating their diverse markup with the same GoodRelations metadata.\n\nThere is a strictly limited choice of &#39;item&#39; and &#39;quantity&#39; markup\navailable in HTML.  While all shopping-cart vendors will have different\nimplementations, we&#39;re still talking about an agent which solves the\nfinite problem of determining which &lt;input&gt; elements to target -- if\nthose vendors agree to a common (domain-specific) metadata vocabulary,\nthis is indeed trivial.\n\nMy TP agent becomes distinctly non-trivial when it must understand an\nentirely different media type for each shopping-cart application vendor.\nInstead of looking for an &lt;input&gt; element matching well-known criteria,\nthe agent must first determine the equivalent of an &lt;input&gt; element for\neach non-ubiquitous media type that re-invents that particular wheel.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
