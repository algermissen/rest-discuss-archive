But we\n&gt;&gt;are attempting to use it prescriptively.  I interpret questions like &quot;does\n&gt;&gt;REST work?&quot; to mean &quot;does REST work prescriptively?&quot;.  I think everyone\n&gt;&gt;else does too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t attempt to use it prescriptively, though I know it probably\n&gt; looks this way.  When that happens, it&#39;s because there is some desirable\n&gt; set of properties that I&#39;m trying to achieve, and I know that they can\n&gt; only reasonably be had with some subset of REST&#39;s constraints.\n\nWhen we tell someone to make their messages stateless so that they can \nimprove scalability and reliability, that&#39;s a &quot;prescription&quot; to solve \ntheir (real or potential) &quot;illness&quot; of poor scalability.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
