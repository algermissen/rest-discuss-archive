It would be nice if it  \nknew everything about HTTP redirects.\n\nI would also like to be able to browse the cache easily for debugging  \npurposes. I would like to be able to pull up a window of of cache  \nhistory, find the last request made, and be able to trace all the  \nrequest that were made as part of a request.\n\nIt is important to be able to browse the message exchanges easily so  \nas to make it easy to debug all of this.\n\nHenry\n\nHome page: http://bblfish.net/\nSun Blog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/\nFoaf name: http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me\n\n\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-50--565182587\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=smime.p7s\r\nContent-Type: application/pkcs7-signature;\n\tname=smime.p7s\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-50--565182587--\r\n\n"}}
