However I don&#39;t buy the metadata argument. What at&#39;s the end of \n&gt; &gt; the URI is a resource, not a file. Resources are known only be their \n&gt; &gt; representations. If those representations are stored in a file system, \n&gt; &gt; fine; but they may be stored other ways.\n&gt; Well, that&#39;s not true for WebDAV. WebDAV supports meta data (properties) \n&gt; on HTTP resources, and *usually* this data is not part of the \n&gt; representation.\n\nElliotte writes about the lack of any reason for us to distinguish\nbetween data and metadata. I second that opinion. So what is the right\nway to represent data about a particular resource?\n\nHTML and to some extent HTTP support the concept of &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot;\nlinks. These specify relationships between the current resource and some\nother resource or resources, and are typically returned from the GET of\nthe resource. These other resources can be substantially &quot;about&quot; the\nresource you are currently viewing, or vice versa. That fulfils any\n&quot;meta-&quot; requirement on data. Appropriate link types[1] can be used to\ndescribe the relationship between the resources. Alternatively, a piece\nof RDF or other data could be used to find the &quot;metadata&quot; for a\nparticular resource. The metadata itself can be returned as any\nappropriate representation.\n\nWebDAV attempts to wrap up discovery of these other resources and\nmechanisms for retrieving and them deep inside the HTTP protocol. While\nthis may be a practial way of sidestepping the development of discovery\nand representation techniques, it limits the applicability and\nextensibility of the solution. It appears the authors of the\nspecification were not able to wait for that development to take place.\nThere is some justification to proceeding on the basis WebDAV did, given\nthat the practical application of this metadata discover on the web is\nstill an immature technology base at best today. Still, it is an\nincomplete solution and one that should not be held too far aloft as an\nexample to others. It violates the Roy&#39;s principle that every resource\nneeds an identifier. Metadata is data, which needs a resource, which\nneeds an identifier. WebDAV replaces the use of an identifier with the\nuse of additional verbs. That&#39;s a no-no.\n\nThe fact that an alternate solution is not yet really well established\nindicates two things to me:\n1) A solution is not required for the 80% case. We will continue to do\nfine on the web with fairly ad hoc solutions and approaches where\nrequired.\n2) The industry is still getting a handle on what this metadata stuff is\nall about and what it is supposed to do, anyway. The definitions we tend\nto have for it are too wide to nail down into anything useful, and\nanything practially useful is not general enough to really satisfy.\n\nThe PROP* methods are an attempt to nail down the semantic web for the\ndistributed authoring problem domain, and obliquely for the distributed\nfilesystem problem domain. The real problem is simply a lot bigger than\nthat. The webdav solution is not applicable to the real problem, so in\nthe is/was only of short-term benefit.\n\nBenjamin.\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.12\n\n\n"}}
