But in common usage,\n&gt; we talk about resources as if they were things.\n&gt;\n&gt; A la REST, a resource maps individual points in time each to\n&gt; a set of values which are indeed representations.  A URI\n&gt; only identifies the mapping.  (BTW, when Roy says the URI\n&gt; in its entirety maps to a set of values, he is taking a small\n&gt; liberty with his own REST model, I think.)\n&gt;\nHmm. Let me ask a pointed question to see if I understand this. By  \nRoy&#39;s definition of resource as mapping, is it true that:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles\n\nand\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?p=4\n\nMust at any time t return the same representation for those two URIs  \nto refer to the same resource?\n\nThat does not hold true for these two URIs. They would return  \ndifferent things at the same time t. (I&#39;m trying to figure out if the  \n&quot;collection of articles&quot; conceptual thing equates to a &quot;resource&quot; by  \nRoy&#39;s definition.)\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n&gt; When you talk about &quot;part of a resource&quot; realize that formally\n&gt; you are talking about part of the relation above.  Which part?\n&gt; The domain (all the mapped time points)?  The range (all the\n&gt; representations for all times, but without the time dimenstion)?\n&gt; Certain tuples (all mappings for 1994)?\n&gt;\n&gt; I am sure you mean none of the above.  In REST, there is no\n&gt; built-in notion of resource decomposition the way you would\n&gt; think of decomposing your car or your publications into parts.\n&gt; And so there can also be no standard for mapping conjugations\n&gt; of URIs onto them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt; Walden\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Bill Venners&quot; &lt;bv-svp@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Roy T.
