How?\n\nThe core problem is complexity.  They treat every new object as\na new data type with a new set of methods to manipulate it.\nThe REST way of doing it would be to map the data into resources\nand provide links between them, thereby allowing all of the existing\nmethods to apply where needed for retrieval, updates, etc.\nVersioning exposes a sequence of related resources and a map of\nthat sequence.  ACLs are just a related resource that happens to\ninfluence access control on the server.\n\nWhat is central to Web Architecture (so central, in fact, that I\nforgot to even mention it as the primary design goal for REST) is\nthat the Web is the set of resources interlinked by URIs.  The\nproblem isn&#39;t just that there are a large number of new methods\nin those specs, but that the new methods supplant what should\nhave been resources that respond to GET.  The result is that a\nuser of these technologies must learn an entirely new vocabulary\nand a new set of tools for something that could easily have\nbeen accomplished via hypertext.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
