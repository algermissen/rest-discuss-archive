Or to just add a GET that returns an entity of just \nthe comments, or simply say &quot;well, if I made GET do anything it would be \nto return an entity that shows just the comments, but since it&#39;ll never \nbe used I&#39;m not going to bother implementing it&quot;.\n\nThe main reason I&#39;d argue in favour of posting to /posts/43 is that the \nrelationship between /posts/43 and /posts/43 is obvious, while the \nrelationship between it and what is (relative to it) ./43/comments is \nless so. Had the post had the URI /posts/43/ with a trailing slash, then \nthis would be less so pressing.\n\nAll of this is about niceties though. /adfs/d32rsdf/1ras89%20sfdakl \nwould be just as good as either from a purely REST perspective, but \nniceties do matter.\n\n\n"}}
