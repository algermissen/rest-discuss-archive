As \n&gt; more and more clients bookmark more and more of the URIs they receive, \n&gt; the more they are incrementally &quot;fixing&quot; the original URI space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence my point: encouraging promiscuous bookmarking of (deep) links \n&gt; seems to be at odds with REST&#39;s desire to minimize &quot;entry point&quot; URIs. \n&gt; Do you see the tension as well, or am I missing something that resolves \n&gt; the tension?\n\nOn subsequent operation a bookmarked link may have the following \nresponses, in order of desirability (and eliding issues such as \nauthentication requests for the sake of simplicity):\n\n2xx because it has worked or a 3xx other than 301 because it has worked \nindirectly, by directing one elsewhere to fulfil or complete the request.\n301 because it has been replaced, and the URI given should be used from \nnow on (update the bookmark).\n410 because it&#39;s gone, and the bookmark should be removed.\n5xx because nobody&#39;s perfect.\n404 - maybe it&#39;s gone, maybe things are temporarily awry, we don&#39;t know.\n2xx or 3xx because it has worked, but alas &quot;worked&quot; now means something \ncompletely different to what it meant before.\n\nOf all of these possible responses, only the last may be a disaster, and \nthen only if the client cannot identify that the &quot;success&quot; was not what \nwas desired.\n\nThe failure of a bookmark to work as we intend means that we must repeat \nthe operation that gave us that bookmark to begin with. As long as we \nare capable of doing so, and as long as we have no false successes by \nresources being replaced by new and incompatible ones we can&#39;t recognise \nas such, then bookmarking has no difficulty.\n\nAs long as the instances of bookmarks failing to persist in this manner \nis less than the number of instances of them working, then bookmarking \nmakes gains in efficiency that make it worth while.\n\n&gt; Devdatta makes the excellent point earlier in the thread about &quot;how \n&gt; blogs require you to permalink instead of the page you are viewing.&quot; It \n&gt; seems that perhaps there is an implicit REST constraint that is \n&gt; beginning to become more explicit. Roughly, REST distinguishes two types \n&gt; of URIs:\n&gt; \n&gt;    1. &quot;entry point&quot; type URIs, which may be bookmarked indefinitely.\n&gt;       These are Cool URIs.\n&gt;    2. &quot;transitional&quot; type URIs, which may not be bookmarked\n&gt;       indefinitely. These are unCool URIs. I call then &quot;transitional&quot;\n&gt;       given that their role is typically to enable transition to the\n&gt;       next state.\n\nActually, the entry-points most often used for blogs are not those \ndesignated &quot;permalinks&quot;. The difference is not between permanence and \ntransience as between one that permanently means &quot;page X of my posts in \ndescending order of date of posting&quot; and one that permanently means \n&quot;what I posted about X on date Y&quot;.\n\nIf you want to maintain a record of how to obtain the former, then that \nis the one you should bookmark, even though it isn&#39;t the one with \n&quot;perma&quot; in its name.\n\nBookmarking is fine, as long as you handle them breaking.\nBreaking bookmarks is fine, as long as you make it clear you broke it.\n\n\n"}}
