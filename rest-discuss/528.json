What are you trying to\n&gt; &gt; accomplish?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like (e.g.) to be able to make a resource such that references to\n&gt; that resource result in redirects to another resource on another machine\n&gt; with no coordination between the two machines.\n\nE.g. someone emails you a web page with an IMAP\nURL in it.  You click on the URL and your browser\nretrieves the IMAP page?\n\nThat is the whole purpose of RFC2192?\n\nIf you mean 30x style redirection, you can return\na message with a message/external-body pointing to\nsome IMAP URL.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know what you mean. Can IMAP do content-negotiation so that I can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ask for a particular message in different content-types depending on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; client?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is the purpose of multipart/alternative.  See\n&gt; &gt; RFC2046 sec. 5.1.4:\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t the same thing. The information producer has to generate all of\n&gt; the types speculatively.\n\nYou want server negotiation rather than client\nnegotiation.  The HTTP spec appears to discourage\nserver negotiation.\n\nIn practice, the server has only a finite set of\ntypes and can enumerate them without sending them\nall using the message/external-body.\n\nIf you really want the equivalent of Accept:,\nstyle content-negotiation, you can implement it\nwith Search.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think so.  Pick an application that works\n&gt; &gt; better for HTTP than IMAP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does IMAP even have a notion of non-authorized references that would\n&gt; allow me to reference public IMAP servers?\n\nYes, it is like anonymous FTP.  See e.g.\nhttp://www.cyrusoft.com/support/faq/anonimap.html\n\n&gt; &gt; Nothing stops you from exposing a view of your\n&gt; &gt; schema rather than your underlying schema.  If you\n&gt; &gt; do end up exposing your schema, you can always\n&gt; &gt; expose a view later when you change it.\n&gt;\n&gt; It typically is not that easy in practice. You really need a rich,\n&gt; Turing complete, programmatic layer between outsiders and your databases\n&gt; -- much more than a view with some stored procedures. You need to be\n&gt; able to unify multiple data sources. So you would have to *implement*\n&gt; the ODBC/SQL interface in code.\n\nWhy?   You are just implementing\n\n  SELECT contentType,content FROM resources\n  WHERE id=&#39;someuri.html&#39;.\n\n\n&gt; Even relational companies do not push ODBC/SQL as a good middle-teir\n&gt; integration so I\n\nActually, Oracle basically thinks of web apps as a\nthink layer on top of stored procedures and\nqueries.\n\n&gt; &gt; Since there is a pretty direct mapping between\n&gt; &gt; resources and objects in table, I am not really\n&gt; &gt; sure what you are arguing here.\n&gt;\n&gt; That ODBC/SQL is only intended to be an abstraction layer over\n&gt; relational databases. Trying to make it a general purpose integration\n&gt; layer for (e.g.) structured data and multiple data sources will be\n&gt; painful.\n\nSo you want an odbc URL.  That exists.\nDelivering an odbcURL + SQL tuple seems pretty\nstraightforward.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
