The important part is that the state of the resource after the\n&gt; PUT does only depend on the payload, not the previous state.\n\nThe server is free to use the state represented in the PUT request *as\nwell* as the current state if it wants to.  For example, the resource\nmay include a counter that tracks how many PUTs it received.  The\nimportant part from a REST perspective is that the meaning of the PUT\nmessage is independent of the state of the resource.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
