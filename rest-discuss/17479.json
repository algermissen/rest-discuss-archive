I&#39;ve been using it recently and had pretty much the\nsame thoughts esp regarding the non-use of hypermedia (and related,\nit&#39;s lack of hierarchy). It reminded me of a twitter exchange I had\nwith Jim Webber where I criticized Amazon S3 for not using hypermedia,\nand he disagreed, claiming, IIRC, that it didn&#39;t need it since it was\ntargeted at the developer.\n\nI didn&#39;t respond to Jim, but never felt entirely comfortable with his\nconclusion.  The thing is, the Web SUCKS... not in the bad sense of\nthat word, but in the sense that it tends to *pull* stuff into it due\nto network effects, including stuff you didn&#39;t expect (even stuff you\nstick an HTTP interface in front of).\n\nCase in point; http://couchapp.org/\n\nI haven&#39;t used the application model described there, but I expect\nthat without CouchDB using hypermedia, writing apps with it is\nprobably a lot trickier than it would otherwise be.\n\nP.S. I wonder if CouchDB would have used hypermedia if JSON natively\nsupported URLs?\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
