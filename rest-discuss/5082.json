As I said, my colleague was actually enthusiastic\nabout REST. But he had been put in situations where he needed\ntransactions and felt that REST wouldn&#39;t allow him get the job done.\n\nI think it&#39;s just another one of the things about REST and how little\nit is understood because of it&#39;s simplicity. \n\nI think that people tend to be too concrete about the nouns.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
