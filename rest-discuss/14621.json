But t=\r\nhere are regular ways of dealing with this using HTTP.\n\n&gt; - The price of a =\r\ngiven order item should be &#39;readable&#39; by the &#39;creator&#39; of the order item wh=\r\nile an &#39;administrator&#39; should be able to update the price\n\nUsing one of the=\r\n HTTP authentication mechanisms (or OpenID, OAuth even) the creator will ha=\r\nppily receive 401 when applying some verbs (e.g. PUT, DELETE) to a resource=\r\n (e.g. pricing) but find they&#39;re get 200 OK responses to other verbs (e.g. =\r\nGET). The administrator might find they receive 200 OK responses to all of =\r\nthose operations.\n\n&gt; - An collection of order states (not a separate resour=\r\nce but part of the order) should be readable by the &#39;creator&#39;. An &#39;administ=\r\nrator&#39; should be able to add states\n\nHow the order is projected onto the We=\r\nb in terms of resources is an implementation decision. You might choose to =\r\nhave the collection of order states physically written down on the same pie=\r\nce of paper in your back end, but you could still happily project them as d=\r\nifferent logical resources onto the Web. Hypermedia is your friend should y=\r\nou want to link them together. Eg:\n\nAdministrator: GET/order/1234\n200 OK...=\r\n.\n&lt;order&gt;\n&lt;atom:link href=3D&quot;http://myservice/order/1234/state&quot; rel=3D&quot;orde=\r\nr-state&quot; type=3D&quot;application/x.ordering+xml&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;line-item&gt; ... &lt;/lineItem&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\nCreator: GET/order/1234\n200 OK...\n&lt;order&gt;\n&lt;line-item&gt; ... &lt;/lineI=\r\ntem&gt;\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\nCreator, after some creative thought tries: GET http://myser=\r\nvice/order/1234/state\n401 Unauthorized...\n\nNonetheless, administrators will=\r\n have more chance of a 200 OK response than creators just as above.\n\nDoes t=\r\nhat help at all?\n\nJim\n"}}
