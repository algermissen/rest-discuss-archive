I don&#39;t think this is terribly problematic.  One thing HTTP definitely\n*doesn&#39;t* provide is an assurance that the overall state of resource space *only*\nchanges through the actions of the HTTP methods.  Given this, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\nnecessary to view the above as a GET + PUT, even if it has some effect on a second,\nunnamed (subscription) resource.\n\n&gt; For example, if the response is &quot;unauthorized&quot;, how to figure out if it applies\n&gt; to the watched resource or the subscription resource?\n\nBear in mind that the notify is only a request for a subscription, if one exists.\nThe subsequent response will indicate whether or not such a subscription is either\navailable, authorized, granted...  not sure it&#39;s really manditory to distinguish\nbetween those conditions.  Either the subscription is available and was granted, or\nits not.  Dunno that more need be done.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
