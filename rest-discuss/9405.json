Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Aristotle, what is your point?  I described a mechanism which works for \n&gt; me, you are talking about some trashcan thing that has no bearing on what \n&gt; I am talking about, and challenging me to tell you why it is not better \n&gt; than what I have, when it has absolutely nothing to do with what I am \n&gt; trying to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; My use case is to DELETE a resource, causing subsequent GET requests to \n&gt; respond 410 Gone.  Issuing a conditional DELETE changes the 410 Gone to \n&gt; a 404 Not Found.  That is the topic of this thread, not moving things \n&gt; into trashcans.\n&gt; \n&gt; What does a trashcan have to do with any of this?  Someone said that \n&gt; deleting a file twice was counterintuitive, I only mentioned trashcans \n&gt; in response to that claim -- we all delete things twice, all the time, \n&gt; so how can doing so be counterintuitive?  This is a user perspective, \n&gt; nothing to do with any actual filesystem trashcan implementation.  \n&gt; Heck, when I close a tab in Opera it goes into a trashcan, which I can \n&gt; then empty -- no filesystem there at all, but still a double-delete.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you would like to talk about something completely different, then \n&gt; please use a different thread, instead of trying to claim that my simple \n&gt; thing can&#39;t be right because it doesn&#39;t involve moving anything into a \n&gt; trashcan, if that&#39;s your point, honestly I don&#39;t know.\n&gt; \n&gt; To reiterate what this thread is about:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a resource /foo which responds 200 OK to a GET request.  I issue \n&gt; a DELETE request to /foo.  Now, a GET on /foo responds 410 Gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine my surprise that this is controversial enough without even \n&gt; bringing up the second DELETE to have exploded like it has, with you \n&gt; even going so far as to tell me this breaks the Uniform Interface \n&gt; constraint of REST.  I just don&#39;t know how to respond to that, other \n&gt; than not to anymore.  :-(\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m still confused.  I fail to see how you can claim idempotence with\nthis setup.  I think that&#39;s what all this comes down to.  In the system\nyou are describing, 2 deletes to the exact same resource URI do two\ndifferent things.\n\n&quot;Methods can also have the property of &quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside\n   from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical\n   requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,\n   PUT and DELETE share this property.&quot;\n\nIn the end you don&#39;t have to listen to anyone.  You are free to do as\nyou wish.  Obviously there are those that disagree with your view of\nthings.  It is of course your prerogative to decide who is in error.\n\n-- \nAaron Dalton       |   Super Duper Games\naaron@...   |   http://superdupergames.org\n\r\n--------------ms010406050803000104000406\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms010406050803000104000406--\r\n\n"}}
