So which is &quot;better&quot;?\n\nWhichever proves most convenient. If all similar resources that are also \nbeing encoded fit into the first format, then I&#39;d favour it, but neither \nare wrong per se, so it&#39;s really a matter of which causes other \ndevelopers the least hassle.\n\nThere is in practice a difference in the default caching behaviour of \nGET operations on the two URIs, a feature of HTTP1.1 for historical \nreasons of URIs with queries frequently being used for operations that \nshould really have been POST, PUT or DELETE operations. Best practice is \nto be explicit anyway, so this makes little difference.\n\nBoston, MA can also be identified with the URIs:\n\nhttp://example.net/sdaflwqensdsdaiwe%20fdsw and \nhttp://example.net/cityThing.php?id=12321\n\nThe latter is not that rare in practice.\n\n&gt; (2) As was noted at the top, the purpose of a URL is to &quot;identify&quot; a \n&gt; resource.  Can every resource in the universe be identified using the \n&gt; above two approaches?  Are there resources that do not lend themselves \n&gt; to identification using the above two approaches?\n\nIn purely philosophical terms, this is way out of scope. In practical \nterms, if we can name it well enough that we&#39;d actually want to assign a \nURI to it, then yes.\n\n"}}
