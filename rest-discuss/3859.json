You\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t need an API in addition to the schema.\n\nBut you will need something in addition to the schema, unless that \nthe names/structures in that schema are very finely specified, ie \nusing a formal logic. At that point it would stop being a schema and \nbecome an ontology of the sort the semantic web people are \nadvocating. Without that level of specification, you only have the \nAPI signatures, which are not adequate (any old OO salt knows this). \nInteroperation requires contracts to be grounded in behaviour aslo.\n\nI agree with Seairth. MoST to me, sounds like a content model that \nwould be a compliment to REST, but not a replacement. Certainly \nthere&#39;s only so far you can go with mimetypes and conneg.\n\n\n&gt; I mean per URI out-of-band data.\n&gt; \n&gt; With MoST, given a URI, you can GET a resource and\n&gt; know what the resulting content-type, schema, and\n&gt; data actually mean.  \n\nYou might want to say what you mean by &#39;mean&#39;. For me here, &#39;mean&#39; \nmeans machine processable metadata. Otherwise it&#39;s not so different \nfrom what we have now. Unless MoST has a formal semantics / model \ntheory, I&#39;m in dispute with your assertion and even them I think \nthere are a few people on the list who will disagree with you.\n\n\n&gt; The meta-location header is an admission of the\n&gt; failure of ReST to deliver the\n&gt; visibility/interoperability it promises.\n&gt; Meta-location is an admision that you have to\n&gt; associate new interface semantics with each URI,\n&gt; and that all ReST gives you is the guarantee that\n&gt; the interface will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE\n&gt; as verb *names* and that GET will be idempotent.\n&gt; Thats pretty weak.\n\nOk, I think I get where you&#39;re coming from. Have you heard of speech \nacts?\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
