So I now have a \nnew expired policy resource which will be available to certain clients, \nbut where? Is it best practise to use  &#39;/expired/policy/123&#39;,   with its \ngeneric branch for other such deletions? Or,  &#39;/policy/123/expired&#39; as a \nmodifier on the original resource? &#39;expired-policy/123&#39;  perhaps?\n\nDoesn&#39;t really matter. As long as policy/123 returns a 410 or 404 then \neverything is tickety-boo.\n\nI don&#39;t like having foo/bar/baz operating when foo/bar isn&#39;t, so I&#39;d \nfavour expired/policy/ or expired-policy/ but it&#39;s more a matter of \ntaste and intuition than anything else.\n\nIf one stands out as particularly easy to implement, or easy for clients \nto deal with, go for that.\n\n"}}
