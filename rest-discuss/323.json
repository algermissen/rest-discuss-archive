The spec does not explicitly cover using\n&gt; message-ids in retry context, but SMTP agents may\n&gt; obviously use it for exactly this purpose.\n\nNo. If the spec does not say that they may ignore two messages sent with\nthe same Message-ID then they should not. \n\nPlus:\n&gt; In all cases, it is the meaning that the sender\n&gt;    of the message wishes to convey (i.e., whether this is the same\n&gt;    message or a different message) that determines whether or not the\n&gt;    &quot;Message-ID:&quot; field changes, not any particular syntactic difference\n&gt;    that appears (or does not appear) in the message.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Go to http://www.google.com/ Type in Paul Constock. Hit Enter.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a user interface convention.  \n\nIf you think that the web&#39;s fundamental addressing mechanism is user\ninterface then the gap between us is too large to be bridged in a\npredictable amount of time.\n\n&gt; ... By that\n&gt; argument, is I urlencoded XML-RPC and passed it in\n&gt; the qu&#92;ery string, it would no longer be RPC.\n\nYou would also need to use the appropriate HTTP methods for each task.\n(GET for queries, PUT for updates, etc.) But other then that, I can&#39;t\nthink of anything theoretically wrong with double-encoding query strings\nas XML-RPC and then as URL encoding. It&#39;s just ugly as sin.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
