=A0Well, fiv=\r\ne in (X)HTML. =A0I&#39;d\n&gt; prefer to pick one, and no user-agent will be lookin=\r\ng for more than one,\n&gt; but for the sake of accessibility (this is a WCAG ch=\r\neckpoint) I use them\n&gt; all, so nobody&#39;s left out. =A0To me, RDFa is just an=\r\n extension to existing\n&gt; accessibility markup. =A0What&#39;s superfluous in the=\r\n markup varies based on\n&gt; the capabilities or coding of user-agents, this i=\r\ns an expected byproduct\n&gt; of decoupling.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is perfectly legal for =\r\nan intermediate to complete rewrite the\n&gt;&gt; html as long at that transformat=\r\nion does not negatively impact the\n&gt;&gt; processing model (ie, it is still eas=\r\ny for the human at the end to\n&gt;&gt; understand the page). =A0A use case for su=\r\nch transformations is page\n&gt;&gt; simplification for rendering on small form fa=\r\nctor devices. =A0This\n&gt;&gt; ability for intermediates to provide value is a ve=\r\nry important\n&gt;&gt; feature of rest architectures.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Transcoding proxies t=\r\nypically care about converting markup to be well-\n&gt; formed, while using oth=\r\ner tricks common to Web accelerators to combat\n&gt; typical problems (i.e. a 2=\r\n00x100 image sized to 20x10 may be reduced).\n&gt; But I&#39;ve never heard of one =\r\nstripping markup attributes to save bytes.\n&gt; Theoretically, the presence of=\r\n an XHTML+RDFa DTD tells intermediaries\n&gt; to leave valid attributes alone -=\r\n- they&#39;re obviously part of the data\n&gt; type.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Basing an autonomous c=\r\nlient architecture entirely on rdfa embedded in\n&gt;&gt; xhtml seems risky becaus=\r\ne the media type provides no protection for\n&gt;&gt; the rdfa. =A0An intermediate=\r\n that chooses to strip the rdfa out would be\n&gt;&gt; perfectly legal. =A0Removin=\r\ng the rdfa has zero impact on the html\n&gt;&gt; processing model.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This isn=\r\n&#39;t the purpose of the media type; it&#39;s a problem which falls in\n&gt; the realm=\r\n of the data type version. =A0Intermediaries which strip out\n&gt; valid markup=\r\n that&#39;s included in the DOCTYPE are just broken. =A0The media\n&gt; type really=\r\n says nothing about what markup is allowed -- text/html\n&gt; works just fine f=\r\nor HTML 3.2 which has no &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;, so I can see\n&gt; an intermediary re=\r\nmoving that invalid markup -- but not based on the\n&gt; media type, which is o=\r\nnly meant to identify a processing model, not the\n&gt; version of the data typ=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A system that relies for it&#39;s basic function on xhtml+rdfa is\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n effectively relying on an implementation detail of the current set of\n&gt;&gt; w=\r\neb servers and intermediates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I really don&#39;t understand your point. =\r\n=A0My server knows nothing of RDFa,\n&gt; and neither do any intermediaries my =\r\ndata passes through. =A0Markup\n&gt; languages, and their extensions, are not s=\r\nuch an implementation detail.\n&gt; Anyway, wouldn&#39;t these problems you mention=\r\n be even greater for custom\n&gt; media/data types?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Most autonomous cli=\r\nents require a different processing model than the\n&gt;&gt; one provided by (x)ht=\r\nml. =A0Automata that can use use (x)html processing\n&gt;&gt; model -- eg, search =\r\nengine spiders -- definitely should. =A0However, the\n&gt;&gt; clients i usually w=\r\nrite lack the requisite natural language\n&gt;&gt; interpretation ai needed to ach=\r\nieve the necessary level of clarity\n&gt;&gt; regarding the various bits of data a=\r\nnd relationships in an html\n&gt;&gt; document. =A0Machine readable precision can =\r\nbe layered into xhtml using\n&gt;&gt; rdfa, but a client that relies on the rdfa b=\r\neing there has a\n&gt;&gt; fundamentally different processing model than a browser=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it? =A0The semantics of a radio-button control are set in sto=\r\nne,\n&gt; &quot;variable x takes one and only one of this set of y values.&quot; =A0All R=\r\nDFa\n&gt; does is annotate the control with some context, the processing model =\r\nof\n&gt; the control is the same whether or not that RDFa is parsed; RDFa can&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; override the semantics of the control to mean &quot;variable x takes one or\n&gt;=\r\n more of this set of y values&quot; or anything else, nor can RDFa express\n&gt; suc=\r\nh semantics in the absence of a hypertext control.\n&gt;\n&gt; The alternative is t=\r\no create a data type which does specifically what\n&gt; you want it to do, and =\r\nassign it a media type as an identifier. =A0In\n&gt; which case it will only be=\r\n understood by a new class of client you&#39;re\n&gt; creating to consume it, coupl=\r\ning client to server until such time as\n&gt; multiple independent, interoperab=\r\nle implementations exist (the\n&gt; definition of standardization). =A0Whereas =\r\nwith RDFa, any user-agent can\n&gt; manipulate the form properly even if it doe=\r\nsn&#39;t know (via RDFa) what\n&gt; the form controls *mean*, which is graceful deg=\r\nradation.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think an `application/rdfa+xhtml+xml` media type would =\r\nsolve most of\n&gt;&gt; these problem, though. =A0That would surface the fact that=\r\n the rdfa was\n&gt;&gt; an important part of the processing model for the represen=\r\ntation to\n&gt;&gt; both the server and intermediates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Any intermediary tha=\r\nt cares about the payload will be introspecting it\n&gt; anyway; it should glea=\r\nn the importance of RDFa attributes to the markup\n&gt; from the presence of an=\r\n RDFa DOCTYPE, which seems to be enough surfacing\n&gt; not only in my opinion,=\r\n but also in the opinion of those responsible for\n&gt; RDFa. =A0RDFa+XHTML is =\r\njust a version within the family of data types the\n&gt; media type references;=\r\n media type isn&#39;t bound to version. =A0Assigining\n&gt; media types to every ex=\r\ntension of HTML or Atom defeats the purpose by\n&gt; being too finely-grained -=\r\n- the processing model of form controls isn&#39;t\n&gt; changed by adding RDFa, so =\r\nassigning it a new media type just loses\n&gt; backwards compatibility of the d=\r\nata type with non-RDFa components which\n&gt; could otherwise participate in th=\r\ne communication (i.e. by prefetching\n&gt; or doing DNS lookups because they kn=\r\now what a link is).\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Yahoo!
