So far, I just cannot see how this\ncould be enforced.  Between the moment that the PUT was completed and a\nsubsequent GET was requested, the resource could have been updated (via\nPUTs, if you want) several times.  There is no mechanism in HTTP to perform\na PUT-followed-by-GET as an atomic operation.  As a result, it seems that\none should *ever* expect the representation sent with a PUT to be the same\nas the representation retrieved with a GET, at least as a general rule.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
