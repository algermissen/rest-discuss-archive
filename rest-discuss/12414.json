There are very few external facing and successful  \nservices that illustrate things like this. For internal apps, IMO,  \nthere is less motivation to treat URIs as opaque as it is tempting to  \nassume that clients know about URIs as well as all possible state  \ntransitions. Under such assumptions, HATEOAS may seem like an  \nunnecessary pedantic exercise.\n\nIMO, it is best to evaluate pros and costs of HATEOAS, or for that  \nmatter, any other idea, in the context of your own apps. If you are  \nconvinced that HATEOAS is beneficial for your apps, then the proposals  \nthat have been discussed so far can help.\n\nLack of an IETF RFC or a W3C recommendation should not, IMHO, prevent  \nanyone from doing the right things for their apps.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
