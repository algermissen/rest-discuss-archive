But I teach Software Architecture fundamentals.\n&gt;\n&gt; So=\r\n, I mention REST simple as an example in many of the class sessions, and I =\r\nhave one just devoted to explain the constrains and actually to wipe the id=\r\nea of REST as an easy Web Service engine.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, I do not start in any of=\r\n the two explanations you just mentioned. I actually start with Chapter 4. =\r\nMy students already know what an architectural style is and also many of th=\r\ne properties. Chapter 4 explains what properties and requirements the Web h=\r\nad. It helps a lot to understand why the constrains, and also helps to buil=\r\nd up criteria to choose REST for an app or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, chapter 2 ( 2.3 Ar=\r\nchitectural Properties of Key Interest) may be confused with the actual pro=\r\nperties of the web. Be careful with that. Section 2.3 lists the properties =\r\nthat are somehow affected by the styles in chapter 3, and they are properti=\r\nes that are generally important for Networked applications. The web is just=\r\n one particular type of networked application, it is a large distributed hy=\r\npermedia system. The particular requirements (and the ones REST in chapter =\r\n5 tries to fulfill) are in chapter 4.\n&gt;\n&gt; To me, the dissertation is an exc=\r\nellent real life example of architecting, following a clear methodology to =\r\ngenerate a style, and that can be applied to other applications, but that d=\r\noesn&#39;t mean all my next applications should be REST. Roy gives an example i=\r\nn the conclusions, REST is optimized for large grain hypermedia transfer, i=\r\nf you have a computational intensive system, REST may not be for you.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nn other words, I use REST as an analytical example.

When I first came across REST it was ex=\r\nplained as a style that\n&gt;&gt; follows the following constraints [1]:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 * Give everything an id\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 * Link things to each other=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 * Use standard methods\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 * Multiple representa=\r\ntions\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 * Stateless communication\n&gt;&gt; I read Roy&#39;s thesis over =\r\nthe summer and my summary of it is as follows:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;REST is a hybrid styl=\r\ne derived from other network-based architectural styles.\n&gt;&gt; The use of an a=\r\nrchitectural style applies the associated constraints on the\n&gt;&gt; system. Eac=\r\nh constraint induces certain properties e.g. simplicity and\n&gt;&gt; scalability.=\r\n Thus, a style applies (it=E2=80=99s) constraints, which induce certain\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nproperties.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Fielding defines the properties of key interest when c=\r\nonsidering the target\n&gt;&gt; architecture of network-based hypermedia (the Web)=\r\n; for example: scalability,\n&gt;&gt; simplicity, visibility and independent evolv=\r\nability. Fielding then evaluates\n&gt;&gt; several common network-based architectu=\r\nral styles (e.g. client-server) for the\n&gt;&gt; properties they would induce. Fi=\r\nelding then derives REST by applying the styles\n&gt;&gt; that induce the properti=\r\nes he requires. To do this, Fielding firstly defines the\n&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9Cnull=\r\n=E2=80 =A0style i.e. a style with no constraints at all. Fielding then adds=\r\n certain\n&gt;&gt; pre-defined styles, which induce the desired properties for the=\r\n target\n&gt;&gt; architecture of network-based hypermedia. This hybrid style is c=\r\nombined with\n&gt;&gt; other constraints (most notably the uniform interface const=\r\nraint to form the\n&gt;&gt; REST architectural style. REST =3D LCODC$SS + Uniform =\r\nInterface&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would this be an accurate summary of REST from Roys&#39; thesi=\r\ns? Which way should I\n&gt;&gt; explain REST to my students - I suspect both.
