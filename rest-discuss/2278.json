Those \ntwo\n&gt; things are not at odds, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting.\n\nNo, I wasn&#39;t suggesting it, but your response suggests that there may \nbe conflicts depending on how it&#39;s done.  More below...\n \n&gt; &gt; If you think of each message as a speech act, \n&gt; &gt; probably related to other speech acts in the same conversation,\n&gt; &gt; then each speech act is an important resource deserving a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure.\n\n&gt; &gt; If you combine:\n&gt; &gt; * state-alignment transactions so that each party agrees on each \n&gt; &gt; important business milestone, e.g. commitment and fulfillment of \n&gt; &gt; commitment\n&gt; &gt; * business rules that are also published with URIs\n&gt; &gt; * digital signatures \n&gt; &gt; * canonical representations of the whole ball of wax\n&gt; &gt; - then you got something that you could take into court,\n&gt; &gt; but you probably won&#39;t need to.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the stateless case, you could just take the offending message to\n&gt; court and leave everything else behind, because its meaning is\n&gt; independant of any conversation it may have been sent in.\n\nDepending on what you mean, that gets tricky.  \nSimple case:  shipment notification is dependent on order line which \nit purports to fulfill.  Claims of non-fulfillment would need both \nthe shipment notification and the order line.\n\nMore complex case:  non-fulfillment is covered by a long term \ncontract which provides penalties.  So now the long-term contract \nclause must be stated as well.\n\nIn a business conversation, each speech act will refer to any other \nstatements required for its meaning.  But it will usually not repeat \nall the relevant elements.  \n\nIn URI-land, the most natural representation would be for statement B \nto contain a hyperlink to statement A, but not to transclude a full \nrepresentation of statement A.\n\nHowever, for evidence and for &quot;what to digitally sign&quot;, one could \ncreate a combined canonical representation of the related statements \nand sign that.  Then you do have one document to take to to court.\n\nAre these ideas relevant to the issue raise?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
