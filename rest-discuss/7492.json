I asked the \n&gt; &gt; question to determine the affected scope in hopes of identifying \n&gt; &gt; alternate methods to address the real concerns.  But if I am only \n&gt; &gt; allowed to view as an abstraction, I won&#39;t be able to consider \n&gt; &gt; tangible alternate solutions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Could you elaborate on those &quot;benefits to have multiple \n&gt; URL&#39;s&quot;? I&#39;m curious what they are.\n\nI can give you one easy example, but the other I&#39;m still researching and\nwill require more background. I plan to cover them on the WDUI Blog[1] when\nI have the research complete and I have published enough pre-requisite\nmaterial.  \n\nBut in a nutshell, for the one example the benefits are URL structure that\nmodels the website&#39;s structure and contributing to a more usable website and\nmore directly usable URL structure.  Hierarchies are wonder structuring\nmechanisms for helping humans conceptualize and navigate complex and/or\nlarge amounts of information. However, there are few true hierarchies; most\nare just presented as hierarchies to help humans conceptualize. Heirachy&#39;s\ncan provide websites with a useful organizational structure along with\neasy-to-navigate URLs so users can see the URLs as they navigate, and hack\nto go up and guess to go down or across. Multiple URLs are needed to reach\nthe same location with the only difference at the root node being the\nbreadcrumbs.\n\nI could easily give hundreds of examples (and I do mean hundreds; I expect\nthe range of potential examples possibly in 5 digits if not 6) of how this\ncould be used.  For one example let&#39;s look at a list of representative for\nthe United States Congress.  I&#39;m using URI Templates[1] to describe the\npotential URLs.  Each of the following points to  a representative, but the\ndrill-down path is different:\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{state}/{district}/{congress}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{state}/{congress}/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{congress}/{state}/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/house/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/house/{congress}/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/house/{district}/{congress}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/{state}/house/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/house/{state}/{district}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/{state}/{district}/\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{congress}/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/{state}/{district}/{representative}\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{district}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/house/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/house/{district}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/house/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{district}/house/{representative}\n\nAnd each of these URLS takes the user same resource given the same values\nfor the URI Template variables:\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{state}/{class}/{congress}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{state}/{congress}/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{congress}/{state}/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/senate/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/senate/{congress}/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/senate/{class}/{congress}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/{state}/senate/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/senate/{state}/{class}/\nhttp://www.congress.info/{congress}/{state}/{class}/\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{congress}/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/senate/{state}/{class}/{representative}\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{class}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/senate/{congress}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/senate/{class}/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{congress}/senate/{representative}\nhttp://www.congress.info/{state}/{class}/senate/{representative}\n\nThe variables:\n\n{congress} - the congress number; every two years there&#39;s a new one.\nCurrently it is 110.\n{state} - two character state code.\n{district} - the number with a prefix (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) identifying the\ndistrict for that state (you&#39;ll note this is always subbordinate to {state})\n{class} - the class (I, II, or III) for the senator. Every two years there\nis a new class and then it repeats at year six. A state has two classes of\nsenators at any given time. (you&#39;ll note this is always subbordinate to\n{state})\n{representative} - The canonicalized version of the respresentative&#39;s name.\nOf course these might need a strategy for disambiguation but I ignored that\nas it is an irrelevent detail for our discussion.\n\nThe above may look overwhelming, but realize that the user would only ever\nsee one page at a time, and would rarely ever travel down alternate path,\nonly the path that made sense to them while they were looking for the\ninformation; once they found it why would they continue looking?  But with\nthis it would give them the ability to drill down in another order that made\nsense to them.\n\nAnd just so you can see it in a not abstract form, here are all the\npotential drill-down URLs for my congressman:\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/ga/5th/110/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/ga/110/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/110/ga/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/110/house/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/house/110/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/house/5th/110/\nhttp://www.congress.info/110/ga/house/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/110/house/ga/5th/\nhttp://www.congress.info/110/ga/5th/\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/110/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/110/ga/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/ga/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/house/ga/5th/john-lewis/\n\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/110/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/5th/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/house/110/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/house/5th/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/110/house/john-lewis/\nhttp://www.congress.info/ga/5th/house/john-lewis/\n\nIf, as a typical web user I was drilling down any of those URLs to find John\nLewis&#39; page and was redirected me to the &quot;canonical&quot; URL it would be totally\ndisorienting and a bad UI IMO. And which one would be canonical anyway?\n\nClearly the &quot;only one canonical URL&quot; guidance isn&#39;t followed 100%, and I\nbelieve that is because the guidance isn&#39;t flexible enough to allow\nalternately beneficial use cases. So I believe we should be able to question\nthe guidance of because the guidance really is an implementation detail.\nInstead we should be able to look more abstractly at the problem and see if\nwe can achieve the outcomes the guidance seeks to achieve using alternate\nmeans.  Note I didn&#39;t say &quot;ignore&quot; the guidance, I said &quot;question it&quot; in\nhopes to find a better solution for future guidance.  \n\nI have several different ways to potentially address these concerns, but I\nhaven&#39;t researched them enough so I let those wait. Besides, this email is\nfar too long already. ;-)\n\n======\n\nSo... now that I&#39;ve (at least attempted) to answer your question, can you\nhelp me with mine?  What are some of the benefits of Canonical URLs besides\ncaching and search engine optimization?  And you could even elaborate on the\nbenefits to caching and search engine optimization too. Thanks in advance.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.txt\n\n\n"}}
