(It&#39;s an RPC-over-http API.)  I think that for you to provide this \n&gt; feedback to the publishing house would be good.  It&#39;s unhelpful to \n&gt; mislabel things.\n\nAOL do call it a REST API.\n\nThe publishing house didn&#39;t seem interested in taking AOLs money to\npay me to write articles rubbishing them.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to hear about specific issues that we could bring back to \n&gt; the development team in question.  A general suggestion to use REST \n&gt; style interfaces could be helpful; \n\nI think the main problem with what AOL is doing is the example. I&#39;m\nnot sure how many people follow that example... but it is a bad one.\n\nThere is also the threat to your internal systems upon which these\nAPIs reside. Having unsafe GETs can cause terrible problems as has\nbeen documented here recently.\n\n\n&gt; is important.  At the moment a big focus is on making things available \n&gt; via in-browser JSON calls (which I just noticed they amusingly call the \n&gt; &#39;AJAX&#39; API). \n\nI believe this is a foolish trend as well. If you build a decent REST\ninterface then writing AJAX librarys is a doddle.\n\nI am doing this right now for my REST web-based development\nenvironment. It&#39;s so much easier because the foundations of all stuff\nare REST.\n\n\n&gt; The APIs are definitely incomplete and only a portion of them are \n&gt; documented on dev.aol.com.  Please consider it a work in progress.\n\nYes. I may have been unduly harsh. Mainly coz I would like to be paid\nto do this stuff. \n\nThere are plenty of other companies making exactly the same mistakes.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
