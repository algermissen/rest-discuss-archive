By pointing out those factors of HTTP REST, I\nwas suggesting that REST allows us to build more robust architectures,\npartially because of the 4 points, but those attributes can&#39;t save us\nfrom bad clients or bad servers.\n\nI think that you goal of using a rule language to someone enhance\nreliability by making the operation of the workflow perhaps more\n&quot;declarative&quot; is a noble goal, but, in the end while on the one hand\nit may seem it can be more robust, I think the robustness comes from\nthe quality, number, and interactions of the rules more so than simply\nbeing in a rule engine at all. The one thing that a rule engine is\n&quot;better&quot; than &quot;just code&quot; is in that for those cases that are\nparallel, and independent, to the other rules in the system, where\norder of execution really isn&#39;t important (and there are many good\nexamples of where this could happen), then the declarative nature of\njust &quot;Adding a rule to the soup&quot; is a nice, elegant mechanism.\n\nBut simple rules lead to simple (&quot;stupid, ridgid&quot;) clients, and the\nvalue of the rule system itself is questionable. Complex rules lead to\ncomplex clients, and complex interactions that can end up, with\ntightly coupled rules, being little more than just raw code simple\norganized differently.\n\nHowever, with solid infrastructure, such as the stuff you&#39;re\nmentioning, that&#39;s the real value. Then, whether using a rule system\nor &quot;just code&quot;, reliable, powerful clients can more readily be made.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n\n"}}
