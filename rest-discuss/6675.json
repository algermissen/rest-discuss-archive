It is currently the &quot;paste after&quot; operation, as\ncompared to PUT&#39;s &quot;paste over&quot;. The changed definition just means\n&quot;tunnel arbitrary stuff&quot;. As such, this changed definition of POST\nintroduces non-self-descriptive messages into the core HTTP.\n\nIn practice POST is usually used in this way. As such, the errata itself\nmakes a fair degree of sense. However, I see it as a step backwards as\nfar as REST is concerned.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
