Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My colleague argues that this is not true.  He says that a client can\n&gt; provide the URI directly to the target Web service (resource), for\n&gt; example:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/part/00345\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/purchase-order\n&gt;\n&gt; He claims that he has done this using WebLogic. Here&#39;s a quote from him:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We were able to have 2 web services on the same machines with different\n&gt; URI, using WebLogic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t used WebLogic, so I can&#39;t verify his statement.\n&gt;\n\nI haven&#39;t done this with WebLogic or any other toolkit, but my guess is that\nit is pretty easy to route HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a URI\npattern. For example, in Java servlets, you can associate a single servlet\nwith the pattern &quot;/parts/part&quot; and a different one to\n&quot;/parts/purchase-order&quot; - and the servlet you route to could be a SOAP aware\nthing.\nSo, my guess is that it isn&#39;t that hard.\n\nIf you did route this way - via common HTTP URI based handling - then the\nSOAP receiver probably won&#39;t be coded to know the HTTP URI - the info would\nhave to be replicated within the SOAP body.\n\n\n\n"}}
