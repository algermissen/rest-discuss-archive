E.g. media type?\n&gt;\n&gt; No that is yet something else. (though also important)\n&gt; A resource can return representations in any number of formats. So a\n&gt; resource that foaf:Group could return its results in any of the equivalent\n&gt; formats: application/rdf+xml, text/n3, ... Or as someone is bound to\n&gt; recreate a json serialisation for all of this in json, or yet another xml\n&gt; format.\n\nI was using media types as an example, and I was thinking of types\nlike application/EDIFACT, which could then go on to tell you that this\nwas a purchase order etc.\n\nBut my point was that representations had types, but not resources,\nwhose type remains unknown from an external viewpoint.\n\nA microformat would make the same point.\n\n(Altho I grant that you could assert something about the resource from\nthe outside, as long as you did not put too much money on it...)\n\n"}}
