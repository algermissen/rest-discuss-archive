RWS-RMS (Resource Model Space) describes what \n&gt; resources a webservice exposes and RWS-IL (Interface Language). You \n&gt; can have many webservices each with their own RWS-RMS document \n&gt; (explaining where their resources are located) but sharing the same \n&gt; RWS-IL document explaining what you can do to thos resources.\n\nInteresting. How do I find out more about this?\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve spent the last 2 weeks tackling this problem of describing \n&gt; webservices and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem that should be solved \n&gt; completely just yet. Reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) There&#39;s still no elegant way to describe an XML document&#39;s \n&gt; structure. I consider XML-Schema unusable and there&#39;s zero tool \n&gt; support for RELAX-NG. I&#39;ve been investigating schematron which looks \n&gt; somewhat simpler but convoluted.\n\nZero tool support for RELAX-NG? I guess it depends on what you mean by a\ntool.\n\n&gt; 2) There are several issues with auto-proxy generation and REST, \n&gt; particularly: should it be done at all? I&#39;ve been thinking a lot \n&gt; about it this. PaulPrescod has mentioned part of the value of REST is \n&gt; that it forces developers to acknowledge the network and deal with \n&gt; the kind-of-low-level-stuff like response codes. I think he may be \n&gt; right to an extent but I&#39;m not sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Between 1 and 2 it&#39;s hard to make much progress. For now, I&#39;d agree \n&gt; with Roger: the best way to describe your webservice in a truly \n&gt; meaningful manner that will be accessible to the greatest number of \n&gt; people is to use HTML and document it.\n\nI agree with the bulk of your argument, but not entirely with the\nconclusion. Certainly, human-readable documentation is currently the\nonly sound basis for client-side development--and I would go even\nfarther than you, to say that there will probably *always* be a need for\nit: maybe it&#39;s just my liberal-arts background talking, but as far as\nI&#39;m concerned, the notion of &#39;intelligent agents&#39; crawling the web, and\nfinding and processing the right resources without human intervention is\nscience fiction (which means it has a 27.3% chance of coming true :-).\n\nEven setting that dubious vision aside, there are those who would argue \nthat resources can/should be self-describing. To which I would answer \nthat &#39;self-description&#39; is always relative to some context, and the\nmeanings expressed in any given information resource are more\ncontext-dependent than most people realize. And even though users are\nwelcome to use resources as they see fit (that&#39;s the nature of the web,\nafter all), many people will find a prose description of the author&#39;s\nideas about the data to be valuable.\n\nSo, yes, we need to document our services in human-readable form, now\nand in the foreseeable future. But I think &#39;use HTML and document it&#39;\nglosses over some important questions that are, if not resolvable, at\nleast discussable here and now. One in particular that concerns me--\nand I think would be of value to many prospective RESTful developers\n--is how to access the documentation for a web service. Since REST is\nnot a programming language, maybe it&#39;s inappropriate to compare it to\none, but I can&#39;t help thinking about the documentation conventions used\nin, say, Java and Python. Developers know how to extract documentation\nfrom any library they want to use, and even if the developer of that\nlibrary has completely neglected to describe anything, they can still\nobtain the bare essentials of the API.\n\nSo suppose we had conventions for structuring the documentation for web\nresources, and a conventional way of querying resources to obtain their\ndocumentation? Wouldn&#39;t that be a good thing?\n\n  [ I&#39;ve actually made a stab in the direction of developing such \n    conventions: in a demo I put together for a presentation back\n    in February, I wrote resource descriptions using Dublin Core\n    with embedded XHTML elements (e.g. &lt;xhtml:p&gt; inside\n    &lt;dc:Description&gt;), and to obtain the description you would use\n    the resource URI with a trailing &#39;?&#39; ... yes, it was a nasty hack.\n    Oh well ... ]\n\nWhat are the obstacles to developing such conventions?\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
