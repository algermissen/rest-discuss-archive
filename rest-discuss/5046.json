The PUT or POST should  \ninclude a &quot;Content-Type&quot; header that describes the type of data being  \ndelivered.\n\n&gt; When I do a GET, I get back an XML document that conforms to a  \n&gt; schema.  Logically I would like to use the exact same schema for  \n&gt; POST and PUT also,\n\nAnd you should!\n\n&gt; but are most resources posted with name/value pairs like an HTML  \n&gt; form would create?\n\nNo. HTML forms use the &quot;application/x-www-url-encoded&quot; when invoking  \na POST but this is in no way a requirement of HTTP. For instance,  \nXForms uses application/xml in POST methods.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is that some bad web frameworks assume  \nthat all POSTs will be accompanied by an application/x-www-url- \nencoded body and will attempt to parse this into some kind of data  \nstructure. These are bugs and should be reported to the framework  \nmaintainer.\n\nMy advice would be to think less about REST and more about HTTP/1.1  \nas there is a concrete specification for how the tasks you are trying  \nto accomplish should be conducted:\n\n&lt;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html&gt;\n\nRyan Tomayko\n                                  rtomayko@...\n                                  http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\n\n\n\n"}}
