For\nexample,\nhttp://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2005/03/02/yahoo_search_web_service_in_wsd\nl_20. \n\nThere is a mailing list devoted to the subject that seems to have run out of\ngas for the time being:\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-http-desc/\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to include REST support in my web services client library\n&gt; at http://wsdlpull.sf.net.Thats one of the reasons why I was\n&gt; interested in some kind of WSDL desriptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate some response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; Vivek\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n"}}
