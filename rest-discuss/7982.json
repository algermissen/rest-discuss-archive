I agree with your aesthetic\n&gt;&gt; sense that paths are prettier than queries in URIs. But I\n&gt;&gt; think that both path and queries are needed, so sometimes you\n&gt;&gt; will have query parts. The question I was asking is which\n&gt;&gt; form of embedding query params in URIs might they be the most\n&gt;&gt; pretty and user friendly?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=7\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is the traditional way. But:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles;a,tjava,p7\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles~a,tjava,p7\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Could also be used in our architecture. I&#39;m not sure that\n&gt;&gt; they are much prettier than the traditional query form, but\n&gt;&gt; the latter forms are shorter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you give some use cases where queries are *needed* (beyond one  \n&gt; query\n&gt; parameter?)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not disagreeing, just wanting to see your use cases.\n&gt;\nFirst of all I ended up deciding to stay with the traditional query  \nparam form:\n\narticles?a=t&t=java&p=7\n\ninstead of:\n\narticles;a,tjava,p7\n\neven though the latter form yielded shorter and, in some eyes  \nperhaps, slightly less ugly URLs. The reason is that whenever you  \nhave a form whose method is GET, the query that the browser will  \ncompose will use the traditional form. I definitely forsee having  \nsome such forms--I want to have a search box on every page, for  \nexample--so the option is to either 1) support both kinds of query  \nparams, 2) redirect every time the traditional form to the short  \nform, or 3) put JavaScript in each page that contains such a form  \nthat captures the submit and rewrites the request URL in the browser  \nbefore submitting. Amazon&#39;s a9.com search box actually uses number 3,  \nwhereas all the other major search engines I looked at just use the  \ntraditional form. Compare a9&#39;s URL for a search for &quot;dogs&quot;:\n\nhttp://a9.com/dogs\n\nTo Google&#39;s:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=dogs\n\nOr Yahoo&#39;s:\n\nhttp://search.yahoo.com/search?p=dogs\n\nNow, to answer your real question about whether query parameters are  \n*needed*, I suspect the answer is technically no, but practically  \nyes. I think you could likely find a way to cram whatever info you  \nwanted into a URL path. Amazon did a nice job of sticking the search  \nquery in as the path above. The trouble is when you have a multi- \ndimensional matrix of pieces of info you want to pass in via a URL,  \nand it just doesn&#39;t fit well in a plain old hierarchy. With query  \nparams you can just leave a query parameter out and it means that  \nparam has its default value. If you&#39;re only using path, you&#39;ll end up  \nhaving one path element for each param, and a value that means null,  \nbut takes up space in the URL. Not a crisis, perhaps, but kind of funky.\n\nIn my self-imposed requirements, I&#39;d like the path portion to help  \nusers intuit the information architecture of the site, so I&#39;d like to  \nleave query-param-style info out of the path. I want to use path  \nrather than query param whenever I can, but I find cases where I need  \nquery params. For a specific use case, I want every subpath under / \narticles to be an article, so:\n\n/articles/why_put_and_delete\n\nand\n\n/articles/url_design\n\nwould be articles. But I also want people to be able to look at the  \nlist of articles at /articles based on topic. There was I think a  \nsuggestion on this list to put the list of articles that are just  \nabout Java at:\n\n/articles/java\n\nTrouble is that it overloads the meaning of the subpath. Sometimes it  \nmeans an article, and sometimes a topic (such as Java), and that&#39;s  \nconfusing for users trying to figure out the info architecture with  \nthe URLs. Moreover, what if later we wanted to add a &quot;URL Design&quot;  \ntopic. If we tried to put that at /articles/url_design, it wouldn&#39;t  \nwork because there&#39;s already an article there. Because I&#39;m trying to  \nplace two different concepts (article and topic) in the same subpath  \nposition, each of which has its own namespace, the namespaces can  \ncollide. If I try and put both things in the path, I end up with:\n\n/articles/java\n\nand\n\n/articles/x/url_design\n\nWhere I&#39;ve chosen x to mean null or unused. I think that would work,  \nbut what we&#39;ve done is crammed a query param-like piece of  \ninformation into the path.\n\nInstead I use a query param to pass in the topic, as in;\n\n/articles?t=java\n\nAnd an article would also not need anything to indicate there&#39;s no  \ntopic other than not mentioning a query param:\n\n/articles/url_design\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
