The\nhost that I have this e-mail address with was battling a DOS attack for\nthe last couple days. Second, sorry if the thoughts are a bit\nunorganized.  After reading through all of the responses, I have lost\nthe ability to figure out which ones to respond to for which parts of\nthe conversation.  Thus, I am dumping it all in here.)\n\nI was thinking about Roy&#39;s suggestion that he would implement this using\na header instead, such that each request within the confines of the\ntransaction contained a header that pointed to the related transaction\nresource.  But this got me to thinking... Suppose the following scenario:\n\n&quot;http://example.com/item&quot; points to a resource we want to update using a\ntransaction (there are other resources involved, but those are not\nrelevant to this example).  Now, if we were to do a GET on that URI (no\ntransaction involved), we would get back a response.  For clarity, let&#39;s\ngive the response an Etag of &quot;1&quot;.  Next, we start a transaction\n(complete with resource and reference URI).  We then perform a T-GET\n(I&#39;ll use &quot;T-&quot; to indicate request that happen within the context of the\ntransaction) on the same resource.  We get back a response with an Etag\nof &quot;1&quot;.  Now, we T-PUT an entity to the same resource (within the\ntransaction).  We then T-GET the resource again, only this time, the\nEtag is &quot;2&quot;.  If you do a GET of that same resource, you get back an\nEtag of &quot;1&quot; (since the transaction has not been committed).  What this\nsays to me is that the resource is existing in two different states at\nthe same time, all depending on which way you are looking at it.  Maybe\nI am just not grasping the finer details, but this doesn&#39;t seem like a\nvalid REST approach.  And to complicate it more, suppose that I had\nperformed a T-DELETE instead.  Now, the URI returns an Etag of &quot;1&quot; and\nthe T-URI is no longer mapped.  Again, this does not feel RESTful at all.\n\nNow, suppose we go back to the approach I suggested, where you\neffectively create an entire new address space for the same resource.\nIn this case, the above &quot;split personality&quot; issue would not arise.  If\nyou T-PUT an entity to the URI in the new address space, a GET (which is\neffectively a T-GET) would always return the same thing.\n\nThe address space doesn&#39;t even have to have the transaction resource&#39;s\nURI as the root (though it still could).  Instead, the transaction\nresource could indicate the constraints of the new address space, more\nspecifically that it could provide the mapping rules between the two\naddress spaces.  The transaction resource might look something like:\n\n&lt;transaction type=&quot;optimistic&quot; status=&quot;active&quot;\nuri=&quot;http://example.com/t/123&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;map uri=&quot;http://example.com/item&quot;\nto-uri=&quot;http://t.example.com/123/example.com/item&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;map uri=&quot;http://sample.com/*&quot;\nto-uri=&quot;http://t.example.com/123/sample.com/*&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/transaction&gt;\n\nWould this still be considered address munging?  Also, as I suggested\nearlier, it would still be a good thing to have the responses contain an\nHTTP header pointing to the related transaction resource, which would\nalso mean that there&#39;d be no need to un-munge (de-munge?) to get to that\nURI.\n\nFurther,  Roy suggests that using a second (and temporary) address space\npartitions users.  In this case, I don&#39;t see this as being a bad thing.\nYes, I realize that the lack of permanence means that the addresses are\nless useful over a long period of time.  But so what!  If one really\nwanted to, you could leave the new address space around &quot;forever&quot;.  Once\nthe transaction was completed, respond to every request with a 301\n(moved permanently) response.\n\nSeairth\nhttp://www.seairth.com\n\n\n\n"}}
