Did anyone anticipate Google Desktop Accelerator, which\ndoes DNS lookahead on various media types?  No, but everyone benefits\nwho uses ubiquitous types whose linking semantics are well-known.\nAlso, antivirus gateways may filter on media types, i.e. images.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If so, it must be the devil&#39;s own work trying to keep them up to date\n&gt; as the set of standard media types grows, after those intermediaries\n&gt; have been deployed.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s just it.  Many caches out there only care about a relative\nhandful of media types which have been around forever.  Media type\nproliferation is a problem; whereas the orderly evolution of new,\nstandardized types is not, because it gives intermediary vendors a\nfighting chance to keep up.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
