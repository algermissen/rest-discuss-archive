And you laid out the business process as a series of return \naddresses for subsequent conversational acts.\n\nDid the example referenced above depict a &quot;real&quot; business exchange?\n(I don&#39;t mean the contents, just the conversational acts.)\n\nAlso, I wonder if the idempotency of PUT might be a problem in a \nslightly more elaborate conversation:\nfor example, if the Acknowledgment of Submission were supposed to be \nfollowed by an explicit Acceptance or Rejection, e.g.\n\n== Submitting a purchase order ==\nPOST http://www.widgets.com/industrial/widgets/purchase-orders/ \nHTTP/1.1\nAck-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/ack/\nResponse-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/response/\n\nSo there would be a couple of ways to do it.  As above, where the \nresponse could say &quot;Accept&quot; or &quot;Reject&quot; or maybe &quot;Counter Offer To \nCome&quot; (we&#39;re negotiating, and the deal is still alive).  \n\nOr you could do:\nAcceptance-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/accept/\nRejection-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/reject/\n\nIn either case, couldn&#39;t you have an ambiguous state of the order \nwith more than one PUT, one indicating acceptance, the other \nrejection?  \n\nWould a POST to the order (handle this submission as a sub-resource) \nbe more semantically accurate?  How would that change the \nconversation process addresses?\n\nJust thinking about it...not sure I am thinking clearly yet.\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
