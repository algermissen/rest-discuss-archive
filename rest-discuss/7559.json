I did not add things to \n&gt; URIs, but I did try to subtract things. I want URI hacking \n&gt; that to always work at the websites whose URIs and \n&gt; information architecture I design. Where I depart from Mike&#39;s \n&gt; approach is that I would still pick one hierarchy from his \n&gt; many possibilities, and have one canonical URI for each resource.\n\nI&#39;m starting to come to the conclusion that the resources I think are the\nsame are actually different. Yes, they may have mostly the same content but\nthey have different breadcrumbs which mean one can&#39;t be cached and served\nfor the other. Of course someone might argue that because the content on the\ndifferent pages is so similar I should not create different resources; I\nshould only have one. But I think that would be being pedantic in trying to\noptimize the caching benefit in exchange to the detriment of usability.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
