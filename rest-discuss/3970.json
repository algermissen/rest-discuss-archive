Fwiw it&#39;s still a lot better that a recent and nasty \nhack I tried where DELETE and PUT were mapped onto URIs which is a \ncomplete mess.\n\nI know you said to me once that it&#39;s not a fundamental problem that \nHTML forms don&#39;t support DELETE and PUT. But the workarounds such as \nyours leaves me deeply unconvinced - I think the HTML designers and \nthe W3C set a very bad precedent and a lot of the goofy thinking \naround SOAP uber POST can be seen as coming from that precedent.\n\nI&#39;m working on a reliable delivery exchange over HTTP and I&#39;m \nrunning into similar problems as CarrotVsOrange. My take on that \ndebate is that RSS justifies using the full HTTP method set and \nworking around is shortsighted - it&#39;s not just that current lack of \nwidespread support for DELETE and PUT isn&#39;t a good technical \nargument, but for RSS it&#39;s a not a good expedient argument either, \nsince RSS is not anywhere like as dependent on HTML forms or \nbrowsers as CGI type technology was.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n"}}
