There is no way for agents to determine whether they\nunders=\r\ntand these rel value semantics without looking inside the body.\n\nSince XML =\r\nand JSON have zero semantic value, agents can only determine\nwhether they c=\r\nan safely handle the format - no prediction about the\nsemantics can be made=\r\n w/o looking inside the body. Both XML and JSON\ncan support the rel value m=\r\nodel for adding semantics.\n\nWhat does application/vnd.customer+xml or\nappli=\r\ncation/vnd.my-application+xml offer? The ability for agents to\nbetter predi=\r\nct whether the _semantic_ values of the body are\nunderstood w/o looking ins=\r\nide. What do you loose when adopting these\nmedia-types? Agents that do not =\r\nhave fore-knowledge of\napplication/vnd.my-application+xml will simply rejec=\r\nt the media-type\nand stop playing.\n\nFWIW, XML is &quot;custom media-type friendl=\r\ny&quot; as the specs adopted a\n&quot;+xml&quot; style for new media types. JSON has resist=\r\ned such as style up\nto this point. I think this makes it more difficult to =\r\nauthor new\nmedia-types with added semantic value when using the JSON data f=\r\normat.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Dec 18, 2009 at 09:56, wa=\r\nhbedahbe &lt;andrew.wahbe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;amaeze77&quot; &lt;amaeze@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Folks -\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There seem to be tw=\r\no schools of thought (I think) emerging with regards to the use of media ty=\r\npes. =A0One school of thought suggests coarse grained media types meaning u=\r\nsing application/xml, text/html etc etc. =A0While the other promotes and sh=\r\nows examples of refined media types that reflect the domain in which they a=\r\nre being used in e.g. application/vnd.order+xml.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I see possible pros/=\r\ncons to both approaches but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen an actual discussion tar=\r\ngeted at discussing this matter (other than certain threads on other topics=\r\n delving into the issue).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyone want to take the first shot at backi=\r\nng a certain approach publicly?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eb\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6596 ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; A key problem with =\r\nusing application/xml is that if everyone did that then how could you do an=\r\ny content negotiation between two distinct but XML-based formats?\n&gt;\n&gt; But I=\r\n don&#39;t think you need to be overly specific with the media types either. i.=\r\ne. application/vnd.store+xml rather than application/vnd.customer+xml, appl=\r\nication/vnd.order+xml and application/vnd.product+xml and so on is too fine=\r\n grained IMO. It becomes quite onerous to extend your application at that l=\r\nevel of media type granularity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Where to draw the line? If it is import=\r\nant to make the type distinction in an intermediary or a connector, or in c=\r\nontent negotiation then differentiate in the headers (use two distinct medi=\r\na types). If the distinction is only important when you are processing the =\r\ndocument anyways (e.g. in the client, server or an intermediary that does d=\r\neep content processing such as format translation) then you don&#39;t need to m=\r\nake the distinction in your headers.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s my take anyways. I&#39;m curiou=\r\ns to hear what others think.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
