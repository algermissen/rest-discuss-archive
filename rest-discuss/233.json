I asked for a REST consisten way of\n&gt; implementing terrorist_or_not.com (a made up\n&gt; application).\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea is that security checkpoints send front\n&gt; and side views of individuals to some server and\n&gt; the server sends back information about whether\n&gt; the person looks like a known terrorist in the\n&gt; database.\n&gt;\n&gt; We can add the complexity that processing the\n&gt; request may take long enough for the response to\n&gt; arrive back asynchronously (but sometimes the\n&gt; server can decide quickly).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the implementation is straightforward\n&gt; using MIME-RPC (because it can get much closer to\n&gt; application level semantics).  The REST\n&gt; implementation is much less obvious (at least to\n&gt; me).\n\nMy view is that HTTP is centered on read/write and it looks like you want\n&#39;find&#39;. I suppose you can do a &#39;find&#39; as a parameterized &#39;read&#39; - only your\nparameters are image bits, not text. That makes it kind of hard to use GET\nto do the read.\nOne way to do it is:\n\n(add a suspect) ==&gt;\nPOST http://www.terrorist_or_fed.com/suspects/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: mulitpart/related\n\n--- image 1 ---\n\n--- image 2 ---\n\n&lt;==\n202 Accepted\nLocation: http://www.terrorist_or_fed.com/suspects/12345/\n\n(get status of suspect) ==&gt;\nGET http://www.terrorist_or_fed.com/suspects/12345/ HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/xml\n\n&lt;==\n200 Success\nContent-Type: text/xml\n\n&lt;suspect&gt;\n &lt;status&gt;verified&lt;/status&gt;\n &lt;category&gt;terrorist&lt;/category&gt;\n&lt;/suspect&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
