You are effectively limited\nto\n&gt; &gt; using it as a storage mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why couldn&#39;t be possible to validate the request body (validating xml\n&gt; with a schema, checking value constraints, and so on) and returning an\n&gt; error if the body don&#39;t validate, say\n&gt; 412 Precondition Failed, 415 Unsupported Media Type or 400 Bad Request\n&gt; with a body explaining the reason of the failure...\n\nYes it is possible. My opinion is that it is much more difficult.\n\nThe process is analogous to inserting or updating a row in a database\ntable.\nThere are constraints that the Database Managment System applies to ensure\nthat structural and referential integrity are maintained. Such constraints\nare\npart of the business rules, but they are not all of the business rules.\n\nTo bring this back to the original example, there may be a business rule\nthat says\n&quot;A customer may not order widgets of more than $100 value unless he is a\nvalued\n(repeat) customer&quot;. This would be difficult to implement using database\nintegrity constraints alone and I content it would also be difficult to\napply to a\nPUT resource state.\n\nAlso, consider what happens if the customer replaces (PUTs) an existing\norder with a\nnew version that contains different widgets. The new order may be perfectly\nvalid but\nwhat if the original widgets have already been shipped.\n\nDeltas to a customer account, using POST, are far easier to implement and\nmanage.\n\nNone of this applies, of course, if the client implements the business\nlogic itself. Then\nthe server is implementing a data (storage) service and PUTs are fine. Note\nthat I am\nnot talking about a browser client here but rather the middle layer of a\n3-tier system.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
