The\n&gt; client asks for data in JSON-form=\r\nat from the server using a RESTful URL\n&gt; structure, and present it in the U=\r\nI. All is well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I&#39;m facing the problem of figuring out what the use=\r\nr is allowed to\n&gt; do with the data, both based on security (=3Ddoes the use=\r\nr have the\n&gt; correct role) and state (=3Dis an action valid given the state=\r\n). With an\n&gt; HTML client this would be easy, since then the HTML could chan=\r\nge\n&gt; depending on these things. In my situation, where the client just gets=\r\n\n&gt; JSON-data, it seems to me that I have to extend my usage of JSON so that=\r\n\n&gt; I can get both the data to view, and a list of what actions the client\n&gt;=\r\n is allowed to perform, and then enable/disable UI elements accordingly.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Something like this would be sent from the server:\n&gt; {&quot;commands&quot;:[&quot;cmd1&quot;,=\r\n&quot;cmd2],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}}\n&gt;\n&gt; With the above I can both get the data I n=\r\need to show, and know what the\n&gt; user is allowed to do with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has any=\r\none done this? Or should I skip directly to XHTML instead and use\n&gt; &lt;a&gt;&#39;s t=\r\no let the client know what it can do? And if so, how would the\n&gt; data be be=\r\nst transferred (key/value data)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any tips would be appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; /Ri=\r\nckard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
