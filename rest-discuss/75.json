IE, in a URL like:\nhttp://server_address/resource\n\nThe server address may itself be a URI.  In the strawman model, it&#39;s something\nlike smtp:joe@....  What I am trying to accomplish is to allow servers to\nbe addressed via any means that permits bytes to flow, under the assumption that\nHTTP can be more-or-less reconstructed as long as bytes can pass.\n\nHm, I wonder if such a compound URL can be expressed using a sequence of calls:\n1) POST http://localhost/stream (POST args are URI=smtp:joe@...)\n(drops the URI into saved state on localhost and returns a stream ID)\n2) GET http://localhost/stream?ID=234234&resource=/index.html\n\n&gt; &gt; * what is the status code for an emission that has been scheduled but not\n&gt; &gt; necessarily performed?\n&gt;\n&gt; This bit I understand. What&#39;s wrong with &quot;Emission pended&quot;.\n\nYes, but there&#39;s no such thing in HTTP.\n\n&gt; &gt; * need some analog for SMTP status codes, and probably those codes\n&gt; themselves if\n&gt; &gt; the transport happens to be SMTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do you need a transport?\n&gt; Obviously I don&#39;t understand enough of what\n&gt; you mean by asynch.\n\nMy working approach for the weekend is just to try to run HTTP over well known\nasynch infrastructure and see what, if any, problems are not solvable with\nexisting HTTP infrastructure.  I could have chosen UDP just as easily as SMTP.\n...this project is a reality check on the fairly abstract conversations we&#39;ve\nbeen having.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
