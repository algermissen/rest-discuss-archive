If this Body@REST would be created, this group would have to \n&gt; decide what it does. This group had quite a few discussions on the \n&gt; &quot;what&#39;s&quot; a body like this should do in the context of the REST-* \n&gt; discussions.  \n&gt;\n&gt; Here are some ideas from the thread:\n&gt;\n&gt;    1. Define what REST is, including appropriate literature\n&gt;    2. Rank RESTfulness\n&gt;    3. Define current patterns and best practices.\n&gt;    4. Collaborate with appropriate protocol committees\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d personally would like an official description of specific REST \n&gt; architectures, such as ROA, but I&#39;m not tied to that.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Sep 18, 2009 at 6:24 AM, Jon Hanna &lt;jon@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jon@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;      \n&gt;     Solomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Would it behoove the REST community to have a quasi-standards\n&gt;     body?
