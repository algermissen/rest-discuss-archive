Aristotle&#39;s \n&gt; definition was better:\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThe crucial point is that the URI space is \n&gt; \tcontrolled by the server and the server \n&gt; \talone; the client should not expect any \n&gt; \tparticular layout. \nThat Aristotle was one smart dude. Or maybe you are talking about a\ndifferent Aristotle.\nWhen considering HTTP - and I believe REST as well - the client is a\nparticipant in the URI space. For example the PUT request in HTTP supports\nthe client submitting the URI rather than ask the server to generate one.\nHow that URI is determined is de-coupled from the ability for the client to\nsubmit new URI though.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And in parrallel there has been complete resistence to some kind of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known hypermedia document formats.\n&gt; &gt; Complete resistance to HTML? Or Web forms?\n&gt; \n&gt; Resistence to defining (in essense) well known schemas or \n&gt; well known sets of microformats for use with web services.  I \n&gt; had long and length discussions on that subject on this list \n&gt; about nine months ago.\nI didn&#39;t pay too close of attention then. Were these format for /defining/\nweb services or for use /with/ web services?\n\n\n\n"}}
