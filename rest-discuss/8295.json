The format for documents is a\nlot more strategic to them than how you upload it to a service.\n\nThey&#39;ve also had RESTy stuff in the past, in Exchange, for example.\nThe company embraced SOAP but it was, in the early days, DCOM in XML.\n\n-steve\n\np.s, say what you like about SOAP, but in REST, the enemy of GET  is\nthe proxy server that thinks it knows better. The one that returns\n200+text/html when the far end 401s on you. The one that caches stuff\nfor weeks, even when the TTL is seconds. The one that caches an\nincomplete download and serves up to other callers.\n\n"}}
