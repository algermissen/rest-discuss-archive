Segment parameters perhaps? Others will have\nopinions on this.\n\n   /my-app/my-thing;content=pdf\n\nBut then there is the slicing up into pages which does not\nfit into content negotiation. If you use the analogy of a query\nis like asking a question of a resource then the question is\n&quot;can I see the first 10 of your items please&quot;.\n\n   /my-app/my-thing?range=1-10\n\nI notice that the way it is done on the rest-discuss web site\nis that this refers to a single message:\n   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4806\n\nand this refers to several messages starting at the one given:\n   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/messages/4806\n\nant the previous list looks like this:\n   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/messages/4805?viscount=-30\n\nThis seems a reasonably neat and understandable way of doing it.\nIt defines another set of resources, each of which is a list of\nmessages. This effectively moves one parameter from the query side\nto the path side of the URI.\n\nThere is no &#39;one way suits all&#39; in this, but I hope the suggestions\nabove are a help.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Elliot [mailto:jj5@...]\nSent: Tuesday, 15 March 2005 1:38 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] URIs and &#39;pagination&#39;\n\n\n\n\nI was wondering how one should construct a URI for a web page that\nprovides a &#39;paginated&#39; view onto some data. Typically I would pass a\nquery string, such as this:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page?page=1&pagesize=10&sortcolumn=1&desc=1\n\nI understand the problem of the atomicity of each &#39;page&#39; of data (as\nadditional items might arrive in the dataset while the user is viewing\neach page, something I could address with a &#39;version&#39; in the URI if I\nfelt it was necessary, however that is not presently my concern).\n\nIs the query string the correct place for these types of parameters? (I\nkind of have the impression that I&#39;m supposed to be avoiding parameters\naltogether, but I&#39;m not sure how to easily do that, especially when my\nrequest contains more than a strict &#39;hierarchy&#39;, being somewhat\n&#39;multidimensional&#39;).\n\nShould I flatten out my URI to something like this:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/\n\nThus allowing for variations such as:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/pdf/\n(a PDF representation of &#39;my-page&#39; for the first 10 items, ordered by\ncolumn 1 descending)\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/html-3.2/\n(a HTML 3.2 representation of &#39;my-page&#39; for the first 10 items, ordered\nby column 1 descending)\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/html-4.01/green/\n(a HTML 4.01 representation of &#39;my-page&#39; with a &#39;green&#39; theme for the\nfirst 10 items, ordered by column 1 descending)\n\netc..\n\nAs the &#39;sub-hierarchies&#39; are not strictly subordinates of their parent,\nis is poor design to represent a request for such a representation in\nthe path?\n\nIf the answer is that I should use the query to request pagination,\nformat, or style, then why wouldn&#39;t I create URIs like this:\n\nhttp://localhost/server?application=my-app&resource=my-page&page-options=1-1\n0-1-1&format=html-4.01&style=green\n\nCan anyone offer guidance on when I should prefer the &#39;path&#39; section of\na URI over the &#39;query&#39; section? Is there any material I should read on\nthis topic?\n\nAt what point does a &#39;resource identifier&#39; stop being a &#39;path&#39; and start\nbeing a &#39;query&#39;..?\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
