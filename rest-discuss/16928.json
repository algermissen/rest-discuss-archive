Actually, you\n&gt; just rarely see media types done right, period. I not sure if you\n&gt; could get a consensus on this list on how to succinctly describe what\n&gt; &quot;media types done right&quot; is though.\n\nIt seems, however, that there is no consensus on what it means to get\n&quot;media types done right&quot;.
