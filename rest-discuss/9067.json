Among\nother things, it has to maintain a list of read messages which it\ndoes, as is common, with a newsrc file. A run list is maintained for\neach newsgroup.\n\nResources are pretty obvious... user, newsgroup, article. We can do a\nPUT to the article(to which each user gets his &quot;own&quot; URL) modifying\nthe flag that indicates whether it&#39;s been read, and the app can update\nthe newsrc accordingly, and life is good.\n\nAt least, as long as we want to mark just one article at a time. Dumb\nbrowser can&#39;t be told &quot;fire off five PUT requests to mark this group\nof five articles,&quot; and we sure as heck don&#39;t want the user to click\nfive &quot;mark as read&quot; buttons, with dumb browser repainting the whole\npage in between. Even smart applications reeeeally don&#39;t want to send\na thousand or so PUT requests when the user says &quot;catch up&quot; on a new\nnewsgroup.\n\nSo if we make the newsrc a resource, we can spoon-feed dumb browser a\nform at the bottom of the page we server, that includes the newsrc as\nit would look like with the five articles marked read, and if the user\nwants to mark them read, dumb browser can PUT the preconstructed form\nto the newsrc, and the server&#39;s RESTfully happy.\n\nSo far, so good. But suppose Joe User&#39;s been paging through the\narticles. He&#39;s got a page with articles 1-5, a page with 6-10, a page\nwith 11-15. And then he decides to mark them read. Dumb browser sends\n(PUTs, or at least POST-overloadeds) the page 3 newsrc run list:\n11-15. Server&#39;s happy. Joe pages back to the second page, and marks\nthose read. Dumb browser says &quot;PUT that newsrc to &#39;6-10&#39;&quot;\n\nNow, we don&#39;t want to serve Joe a 409 Conflict, and we don&#39;t want to\nunmark articles 11-15, and we don&#39;t want to make it impossible for a\nsmarter application to say &quot;mark 6-10 read, unmark 11-15&quot; all at once\non purpose. It&#39;s not too difficult to cater to dumb browser and put\nsomething in the form that determines whether to union, xor, diff, or\nintersect the PUT run list with the server&#39;s existing run list, but\nI&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s an approach that eliminates the problem\naltogether.\n\n"}}
