Yo=\r\nu are _not_ &quot;given a URI for\n&gt; some resource in a system&quot;. You are given a =\r\nsimple identifier, a\n&gt; customer number, an order number, or a blog name. No=\r\nt the complete\n&gt; URL. That &quot;sitemap&quot; tells the client where it can find the=\r\n search\n&gt; forms for those numbers or names. By looking at the sitemap you c=\r\nan\n&gt; get a URL to the search form for customers. That search form tells\n&gt; y=\r\nou, that by doing a GET on a certain URL (the action) and passing\n&gt; the cus=\r\ntomer number as &quot;&numer=3D...&quot;, you will get a resource\n&gt; describing the re=\r\nquested customer.\n&gt; \n\nGiven 2010-03-20 as a simple identifier, how is the c=\r\nlient instructed\nto build an URL with it?\n\nNot REST:\nClient has previously =\r\nloaded some other document into memory (sitemap)\ninstructing it to make a G=\r\nET for /date?iso=3D2010-03-20 when it encounters\nan ISO date string.  Clien=\r\nt &quot;somehow knows&quot; this out-of-band info.\n\nREST:\nRetrieved representation li=\r\nnks to some other document (sitemap), which\nmay be cached locally, which co=\r\nntains a link for dereferencing.  Client\nfollows its nose -- i.e. checks an=\r\nother document for &lt;a id=3D&#39;2010-03-20&#39;\nhref=3D&#39;/date?iso=3D2010-03-20&#39;&gt;.\n\n=\r\nAlso REST:\nRetrieved representation contains some URL-construction code (pe=\r\nrhaps a\nform).  Client follows its nose -- the values &#39;2010&#39;, &#39;03&#39; and &#39;20&#39;=\r\n are\nentered where appropriate.\n\nAlso REST:\nRetrieved representation links =\r\nto some document (not a sitemap) which\ncontains URL-construction code.  Cli=\r\nent follows its nose -- in the case\nof my demo, the retrieved representatio=\r\nns link to an XSLT stylesheet\nwhich (as I posted before) contains the code =\r\nto convert ISO date-string\ninstances into URLs for dereferencing and transf=\r\normation.\n\nThe key here, is for the client to follow hypertext included in =\r\nthe\nrepresentation which returns the &quot;simple identifier&quot;, to learn how to\nd=\r\nereference an URL containing the &quot;simple identifier&quot;.  While a\n&quot;sitemap&quot; co=\r\nuld be used, that really just adds another round-trip\nbetween client and se=\r\nrver.\n\nWhat makes the Not REST example wrong, is that the client is expecte=\r\nd to\nknow how to create the mapping using some knowledge outside (not linke=\r\nd)\nthe dereferenced representation which contains the &quot;simple identifier&quot;.\n=\r\nFor example, using a browser&#39;s client-side storage to cache a lookup\ntable,=\r\n and using script to access name-value pairs from that client-side\nstorage =\r\nfor all subsequent requests.\n\nWhile such a solution would work, the problem=\r\n is that some prior URI\nmust be dereferenced to create this lookup table.  =\r\nA dereferenced\nrepresentation containing a script which references client-s=\r\nide storage\nwould fail, unless that prior URI had been dereferenced.\n\nWhen =\r\nthe condition is met, that the client can follow its nose (using\nhypertext)=\r\n to find everything needed to render a representation\ndereferenced from som=\r\ne URI, then no prior knowledge is needed beyond\nthe URI being derefernced.\n=\r\n\nOTOH, if the URI being dereferenced cannot be rendered without the\nclient =\r\nhaving prior knowledge of some other URI that the retrieved\nrepresentation =\r\ndoesn&#39;t link to, that prior knowledge is out-of-band.\n\nTo sum up, if your A=\r\nPI requires me to first dereference some sort of\nsitemap, before dereferenc=\r\ning any other URIs will work, then your API\nmust always be entered from the=\r\n sitemap URI, instead of from any URI.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
