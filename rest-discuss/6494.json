O=\r\nne main difference is that in REST &#39;dead&#39; \n&gt; representations of objects are=\r\n passed around, and in COM et al. live \n&gt; objects are passed around.\n\nFunny=\r\n... I&#39;d put &#39;live&#39; in quotes more so than &#39;dead&#39;.  ;)  In both\ncases, a cop=\r\ny of *something* is made.  In distributed object systems,\ngreat pains are t=\r\naken to have this notion of &#39;live&#39; objects that have\nthe same identity.  Fo=\r\nr a particular system that expense might be\njustified ... but it seems easi=\r\ner to me to think of separate things as\nseparate.\n\n\n&gt; In COM you get some o=\r\nbjects and then you make your operations directly \n&gt; on the objects. In RES=\r\nT, on the other hand, you have to go to one \n&gt; destination, the server, for=\r\n all operations. That makes COM appear to \n&gt; follow object orientation more=\r\n closely and easier to use, but I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure that&#39;s the case.\n\n(D)COM is=\r\n the (Distributed) Component Object Model, whereas REST doesn&#39;t\nput forth a=\r\nn object[-oriented] model in favor of resources,\nrepresentations and unifor=\r\nm interfaces.  It&#39;s pretty clearly the case\nthat COM follows object orienta=\r\ntion more closely.\n\n\n&gt; Is REST inherently more inefficient, in terms of per=\r\nformance and memory \n&gt; consumption? Regarding performance I&#39;m mainly thinki=\r\nng of generating / \n&gt; parsing the representations (XML or other format), bu=\r\nt perhaps \n&gt; marshalling in COM is equally expensive? Regarding memory cons=\r\numption \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking of the real objects and the representations, i.e. t=\r\nhe \n&gt; data&#39;s in two locations. Do you think REST can be used on a device wi=\r\nth \n&gt; restricted resources, such as a mobile phone or PDA?\n\nQuestions of ef=\r\nficiency -- especially between such different styles --\nare hard to judge. =\r\n For the points you make, I&#39;d say:\n\n{Object,structure}&lt;-&gt;octet conversion c=\r\nan be fast or slow in any\nenvironment, depending on bunches of things.  Nei=\r\nther approach here is\nnecessarily faster or slower for every application, t=\r\nhough...\n\nDon&#39;t forget about the efficiency of a set of fine-grained operat=\r\nions\nvs. coarse-grained operations in the context of a high-latency network=\r\n.\nAlso, consider the differences in the deployment scenarios of a bounded\ni=\r\nntranet vs. a dynamic, intermediated topology such as the internet.\n\n\nREST =\r\ncan definitely be used in a resource-restricted environment ...\nconsider an=\r\n HTTP request to a server from a cell phone,\ncontent-negotiating a more app=\r\nropriate representation of the homepage of\na website.  Or that request bein=\r\ng transparently proxied through a\ntranscoder that downsamples images to bet=\r\nter suit the\nresource-constrained device.\n\n\n&gt; Is it possible to put a REST =\r\nlayer on top of a COM solution?\n\nMaybe it&#39;s possible to put a &quot;REST-like&quot; l=\r\nayer on top of a COM solution\nand vice-versa.   But it&#39;s always going to be=\r\n a case of the solution not\nreally making full/appropriate use of the subst=\r\nrate protocol, treating\nit as a transport layer.\n\n-- \n...jsled\nhttp://async=\r\nhronous.org/ - `a=3Djsled; b=3Dasynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\r\n--=-1EnA3yQTyPjYDtcD8k3Z\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.asc\r\nContent-Description: This is a digitally signed message part\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--=-1EnA3yQTyPjYDtcD8k3Z--\r\n\n"}}
