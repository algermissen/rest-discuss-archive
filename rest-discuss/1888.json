I say this\n&gt; because obviously the server has to be able to interpret that URI to\n&gt; find the object.  Am I close here?\n\nI think that that is pretty much it!\n\nThere is a corner case where the server is just a &quot;file storage&quot; and\nsome other agent is actually inventing the URIs and storing information\nwith them. In that case, the agent inventing the URIs is of course the\none that can treat them as transparent rather than opaque.\n\nAlso, Jeff says that if the client and server negotiate somehow (prose\ndocument or something else), the server could delegate the right to\ninterpret the URIs. I don&#39;t think that this is very often necessary in\npractice but as long as permission was given explicitly it would be okay\nwith me.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
