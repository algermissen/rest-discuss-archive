The Astoria team uses=\r\n an agile \ndevelopment model, so the project moves fast and we encourage \ni=\r\nndividuals to take on a variety of roles and responsibilities. \nFurther, we=\r\n would really like to hire some external folks who are an \nactive part of t=\r\nhe Alt.Net community to mix things up a bit!\n\nFor more information, see her=\r\ne:\n\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/aconrad/archive/2008/03/24/astoria-team-is-\nhirin=\r\ng.aspx\n\nor feel free to contact me directly.\n\nAndrew Conrad\nDevelopment Lea=\r\nd\nProject Astoria\n\n\n\n"}}
