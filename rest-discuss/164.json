Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; A notification is a message that describes a request/response pair - the\n&gt; &gt; event that occurred.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess that&#39;s where we disagree fundamentally. A notification is a\n&gt; message that something has changed. Nothing more, nothing less. In\n&gt; general, there is no request/response pair. When a message comes through\n&gt; an EDI backchannel that a stock price (or temperature) has changed, that\n&gt; is reflected in a series of notifications being sent. There is no\n&gt; request/response pair to echo.\n\nWhen a message comes through saying that a temperature changed - that\nmessage is already a notification.\nWhen a message causes the temperature to change - that is a request, which\nmight spawn notifications.\nThe thing that originates the notification - what kinds of things would it\nwant to say?\nIt would say what resource was affected, how it was affected, possibly who\naffected it, etc.\nWhat structure and format of names/values would it use?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If this particular application thought that the details of the EDI\n&gt; message were important, then I guess that information could be sent in\n&gt; the BODY of the response. Similarly, if you feel strongly that\n&gt; request/response pairs should be sent to your clients then you could do\n&gt; that in a particular application. But I claim that the only\n&gt; responsibility of the underlying engine is to report that the resource\n&gt; has been changed or deleted.\nI underlying engine should only report that the resource has been changed or\ndeleted - I agree.\nBut how does it say &#39;changed&#39; or &#39;deleted&#39;? I am saying since the resource\nis reflected as a URI - otherwise you couldn&#39;t subscribe to it - the\nnotification should be cast in terms of URI modification operations, i.e.\nHTTP concepts.\n\n&gt; But in my mind, the logical model is just: &quot;That resource you asked\n&gt; about changed or disappeared.&quot; What caused the change is, in general,\n&gt; not the business of the watchers and will more often than not be through\n&gt; non-HTTP means anyhow.\nI&#39;m not talking about what caused the change, but the types of operations\nthat the resources experience - such as create, read, update, delete and\nadd/remove for collections. These resource manipulation operations are\navailable via HTTP and communicating the fact that a resource changed should\ntry to re-use those same concepts.\n\nI suppose you could define a new set of operations with the meaning &#39;this\nresource operation occurred&#39; that are distince from &#39;perform this resource\noperation&#39;, but my position is that you don&#39;t have to have a distinct set,\nyou just need to distinguish between &#39;request&#39; and &#39;notify&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
