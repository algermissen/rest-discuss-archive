I agree \nthat\n&gt; where your model is practical it is better because it is easier to \nlog,\n&gt; more visible for intermediaries etc. But it feels like there are \ncases\n&gt; where you would end up inlining a huge web of historical documents.\n&gt; Nevertheless, your distinction of referencing identity versus\n&gt; referencing state points out that EVERY link does not have to be\n&gt; inlined. I&#39;ll have to think about some examples more.\n\nI am still thinking about the alternatives, too.\nBut I think there is a distinction between &quot;the meaning of the \nmessage&quot; in the sense of its value as a speech act, that is, the \nvalues of its elements, and the &quot;residual effect&quot; of the message on \nthe whole business conversation.\n\nIn other words, if I offer to buy your Porsche for $100, the meaning \nof my message is clear, but in context, it&#39;s absurd.\n\nLikewise if the contract says &quot;you will deliver 100 pairs of shoes at \nnoon next Monday&quot;, and you send a Shipment Notification saying you&#39;re \nsending 50 pair on Tuesday, the meaning of the notification is clear, \nbut it does not fulfill the contractual commitment.\n\nSo should the Shipment Notification contain the signed representation \nof the commitment? Or just refer to it?  If it refers to it, if the \nbuyer changed it unilaterally from Tuesday to Monday and from 50 to \n100, how does the seller prove it?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
