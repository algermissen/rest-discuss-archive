It&#39;s resources a=\r\nre represented using xml and or json, so xsd and JSON Schema will be used t=\r\no describe representations. These requirements are basically things i have =\r\nto live with, so I need to figure out how to do my best here.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now what =\r\ni need to do is...\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. be able to version the service&#39;s resources\n&gt; 2. i=\r\nnclude a reference to an xml or json schema in my responses\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what=\r\n I&#39;m thinkin&#39;. I&#39;ll create custom vendor mime types for both xml and json. =\r\nEach will contain two mime type parameters; &quot;profile&quot; which points to the j=\r\nson or xml schema, and &quot;v&quot; which specifies the version of the representatio=\r\nn.\n&gt;\n&gt; Below is a simple example of what the wadl might look like. In short=\r\n, the example resource supports four different response representations, tw=\r\no of which are xml; versions 1.0 and 2.0, and the other two are json; versi=\r\nons 1.0 and 2.0. And each points to a schema via profile parameter.\n&gt;\n&gt; FWI=\r\nW - This approach is based on things I&#39;ve read around here, Peter William&#39;s=\r\n blog, Bill Burk&#39;s REST book, and the latest JSON Schema draft (recently 03=\r\n, congrats!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;resource path=3D&quot;example&quot;&gt;\n&gt; =A0 &lt;meth=\r\nod name=3D&quot;GET&quot; id=3D&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;response&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 &lt;repr=\r\nesentation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.app+json;profile=3D/path/to/=\r\nexampleV1.0.json;v=3D1.0&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 &lt;representation mediaType=3D&quot;=\r\napplication/vnd.custom.app+json;profile=3D/path/to/exampleV2.0.json;v=3D2.0=\r\n&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 &lt;representation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.a=\r\npp+xml;profile=3D/path/to/exampleV1.0.xsd;v=3D1.0&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 &lt;rep=\r\nresentation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.app+xml;profile=3D/path/to/=\r\nexampleV2.0.xsd;v=3D2.0&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;/response&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;/method&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/=\r\nresource&gt;\n\nI&#39;d advise against using parameters to describe the version.  As=\r\nsuming\nyou have defined your media type with &quot;must ignore&quot; semantics you on=\r\nly\nneed a new version when breaking changes are needed.  (Obviously,\nbreaki=\r\nng changes should be avoided when ever possible, but they are\nsometimes nec=\r\nessary.)  If you are introducing a breaking change then\nit is a different m=\r\nedia type by definition.  Putting important\ninformation about the semantics=\r\n of representation in a parameter is\ninappropriate.\n\nUsing parameters is al=\r\nso less than ideal from a practical standpoint.\nTool chains tend to provide=\r\n little or no support for media type\nparameters.  Putting important informa=\r\ntion in the parameters will\nrequire more work in both user agents and serve=\r\nrs than just minting a\nbrand new media type id.\n\nMint new a media type id e=\r\nvery time you are forced to introduce an\nincompatible media type into your =\r\nsystem.  They are cheap, you can\nhave as many as you need.\n\nPeter\nbarelyeno=\r\nugh.org\n\n"}}
