If someone POSTs/PUTs an &quot;text/xml&quot;\n&gt; request entity (that happens to not  be well-formed) and gets back a 415,\n&gt; how likely are they to know that it&#39;s the entity itself that&#39;s not valid,\n&gt; not necessarily the content-type they said it was?  I know you could\n&gt; convey this information in the response entity, but let&#39;s face it, the\n&gt; only successful use of this is with HTML, which isn&#39;t at all\n&gt; program-friendly. As a result, you have one of the following choices:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Use the code that&#39;s closest and hope the client understands it.\n&gt; 2) Use 400 generally and come up with an xml-based (since the request was\n&gt; supposedly xml) response entity that conveys all possible information.\n&gt; Then make sure all clients know how to use this xml-based specification.\n&gt; 3) Create a new 4xx response code that means *exactly* what you want it to\n&gt; mean.  Then make sure all clients now how to handle that response code (or\n&gt; fall back to 400 equivalence and rely on option #1).\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Alex Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;; &quot;rest-discuss&quot;\n&gt; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 04, 2003 12:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] 403 vs. 409\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why isn&#39;t the correct response 415 (Unsupported Media Type)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Your application requires that the POST conform to a particular schema\n&gt;&gt; and that schema has been violated.  2616 does not say that the value of\n&gt;&gt; the content-type header is bad, but that the actual media-type is bad.\n&gt;&gt; XML\n&gt; DTD\n&gt;&gt; and schema have already moved a lot of media-type information outside of\n&gt;&gt; the content-type header.

Currently, I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; using 403, saying that an invalid request entity (say, a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; non-well-formded XML document) would be &quot;forbidden&quot;. But the problem\n&gt;&gt; &gt; here is that the resource is what defines whether the request entity\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is valid or not (even the well-formedness of an XML document), so in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *some* sense, a bad request entity &quot;conflicts&quot; with the resource.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 403 for?  About the only example I could come up with was one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mirroring a filesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; marked &quot;read-only&quot;.  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; if it were not read-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not a\n&gt; conflict,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; necessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore\n&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; appropriate for a 409 response.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 31, 2003 at 09:11:23AM -0400, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Should a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d use 400.
