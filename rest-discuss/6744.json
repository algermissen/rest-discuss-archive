Fielding\nCc: Mike Schinkel; REST Discuss\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] RFC for REST - Leonard&#39;s book?\n\nHi all,\n\nOn Nov 7, 2006, at 10:57 AM, Roy T. Fielding wrote:\n&gt; I might write another book some day, assuming I ever get in the swing \n&gt; of writing on a regular basis (and ignoring email). I doubt that I \n&gt; would call it a REST book, though it would contain REST. I am sure the \n&gt; publisher would try to market it that way anyway.\n\nSo this is perhaps a good (if dangerous :-) time to ask what Roy and the\nrest of you (no pun intended) think of Leonard&#39;s new book proposal:\n\nhttp://www.crummy.com/2006/11/03/1\n&gt; I got the idea for a REST book when I started seriously trying to \n&gt; figure out what was and wasn&#39;t REST. I noticed that though certain \n&gt; best practices showed up repeatedly in REST folklore, they never \n&gt; really progressed beyond that point. I decided to write a book that \n&gt; would set down the folklore and hopefully create some new canon, some \n&gt; common ground.\nhttp://www.crummy.com/writing/REST-Web-Services/\n\n&gt; This is the book that puts the &quot;web&quot; back into &quot;web services&quot;. You can \n&gt; design a web service that uses HTTP, XHTML, and URIs. You just need to \n&gt; understand REST, the architecture of the web. REST Web Services gives \n&gt; you the tools you need to argue for sensible web services, and the \n&gt; strategies and code you need to create them.\nLeonard is may be overly-self-congratulatory (perhaps with deliberate\nirony), but it sounds like there is a lot of demand for such a thing.\nWhether there is a &quot;need&quot; for this book in particular is perhaps a more\ndifficult question. :-)\n\nStill, Leonard is actively soliciting feedback, so this is a chance for\ny&#39;all to put your money where your mouth is...\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\n"}}
