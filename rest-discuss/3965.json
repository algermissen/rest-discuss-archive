Moreover, this can&#39;t be automated. You have to look\nfor this schema. And finally, this suppose that your &quot;default&quot; (or\n&quot;main&quot;) type is application/shoe-order+xml, and I precised that is this\nexample case, default is text/html and the server can return many\nformats, thanks to, e.g. , server-side xslt, so there is *no* &quot;main&quot;\ntype.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So now you create a form located at /form.html\n&gt; it POSTs to /collection.xml\n&gt; \n&gt; The server responds:\n&gt;   201 Created\n&gt;   Location: postedobjectlocation\n&gt;   Content-type: text/plain\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank you for posting.\n&gt; \n&gt; The end user is never directly exposed to the application/shoe-orders+xml \n&gt; type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note: It would be more elegant if there was a variant of multipart/mixed \n&gt; that had a types parameter which constrained the set of types allowed in \n&gt; the mix, but I am not aware of an RFC that looks like that so we are stuck \n&gt; with the above.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
