And then try to do the same with (probably) Mule in the \nmiddle. And see what&#39;s simpler.\n\nSo I know how to do it with HTTP (actually several ways come to my mind) \nand I know how I&#39;ll do it from some of the other protocols if it was RPC \napp, or a intra-VM app, but I can&#39;t understand how to do it in a \nRESTfull way and without a ESB.\n\nProbably I&#39;m not seeing this right and probably the best solution *is* \nto use a ESB?\n\nThanks all for your cooperation.\n\n\n\n"}}
