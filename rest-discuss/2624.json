Mike Dierken; Paul Prescod\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Resources always exist\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Translated to response codes, the former says that if the\n&gt; &gt; server honors DELETE, then the response code is always 200; the\n&gt; &gt; second says that if the server honors DELETE but the resource\n&gt; &gt; was unmapped before the delete, then in that case the response\n&gt; &gt; is 404, else it&#39;s 200.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do I correctly understand the modelling task here?\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that captures it.  I&#39;m also left wondering: if subsequent \n&gt; DELETEs after an initial DELETE can return 200, does would imply that\n&gt; GET/HEAD should return 200/204 with an empty entity-body too?  Perhaps\n&gt; you could include that in your model also?\n\nI&#39;ll include it if I understand it well enough. ;-)  So you&#39;re saying\nthat if the nth DELETE of some resource (with no intervening operations\nthat could restore representation mapping) can return 200 (i.e., &quot;OK\nit&#39;s not mapped&quot;), then should a GET at this point (again, no intervening\noperations to change state) also return 200 (i.e., &quot;OK, the resource\nis here because resources always exist) with an empty entity-body (i.e.,\n&quot;just because it exists doesn&#39;t mean it maps to any representations&quot;)?\n\nThat&#39;s a different kind of modeling problem, and I&#39;m not sure modeling\nwill clarify anything.  I believe the rule is that 404 means no\nrepresentation was found, while it&#39;s implicit that any resource that\never existed still does.\n\nWalden\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
