It is very readable and besides defining REST it is  \nvery good material on software architecture and principled design in  \ngeneral. Changed my mind entirely.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me that, whatever acronym you want to use, the &quot;Hypermedia\n&gt; Engine&quot; is basically the concept that resources should include not\n&gt; just their actual data, but representations of State applicable state\n&gt; changes for that resource.\n\nThis is not what &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state is  \nabout&quot;, Stefan is correct. It refers to the notion that the (Web)  \napplication is driven by the client traversing links and that the  \ncurrent state of the application resides on the client. If the client  \ndoes not act, the application does not proceed. Think application==one  \nperticular book-buying process someone makes in Amazon. You can  \ninterupt the execution of the buying application at any time. When you  \nreturn toyour browser you can keep going. The application will have  \nwaited for you.\n\nYour use of the term &#39;command&#39; seems like you are thinking RPC - do you?\n\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Simply, resources include links for other operations.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are several reasons for this.\n&gt;\n&gt; One, is robustness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the commands are included within the resource, the actual\n&gt; mechanism for executing that command (the specific text of the link\n&gt; reference), can change over time without the client having to know or\n&gt; care about that detail. This maintains the &quot;URI are opaque&quot; concept.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, while systems move, and evolve, the clients can maintain  \n&gt; stability.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two, extensibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the resource is itself naturally extensible, i.e. XML, JSON, or\n&gt; some other format, then the command set for a resource can change over\n&gt; time but older clients can remain stable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Three, is discovery.\n&gt;\n&gt; When you have an extensible interface, bundling the available state\n&gt; changes can allow a developer of a client to be instantly aware of new\n&gt; functionality. This can happen before they&#39;re documented, before\n&gt; they&#39;re announced, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have all been to a website and seen new links and actions appear\n&gt; over time with perhaps hardly 2 line announcement from the site owner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, given this, there are some conditions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some formats simply aren&#39;t extensible. You can&#39;t augment a JPEG, for\n&gt; example. But opaque formats tend to get wrappers for that very reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no expectation for clients (and by clients, I mean programs)\n&gt; to necessarily &quot;intuit&quot; what new commands do, or when they should be\n&gt; used. If the command set changes, it&#39;s implied that someone,\n&gt; somewhere, will need to update their client code to make use of those\n&gt; new services.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, obviously, the extra command set adds data to the overall\n&gt; payload, making it less efficient.\n&gt;\n&gt; We tolerate this on a human driven web page because the\n&gt; discoverability is related to ease of use (no expectation that a user\n&gt; would want to type in the address bar\n&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/item/12345/reviews&quot; or whatever. No, they&#39;ll\n&gt; just click a link.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, arguably, if you want to maintain the extensibility and\n&gt; robustness of the system, and allow it to change beneath the clients\n&gt; feet, you as a producer are obligated to provide this information\n&gt; every time, in every packet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Given that, tho, there is no expectation that a resource format remain\n&gt; static at all. If one day the service sends back format A, and the\n&gt; next it sends out incompatible format B, then that&#39;s just the truth of\n&gt; it and clients will have to abruptly deal with that situation.\n&gt; Clearly, if you&#39;re using XML, it would be kind to change the schema\n&gt; declaration so that a client can &quot;fail fast&quot;, rather than slogging\n&gt; through unfamiliar XML.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be nice if the service provider sent out some notice about\n&gt; the pending change as well, so as not to disrupt clients. But, be that\n&gt; as it may, since the state changes are bundled within the payload, on\n&gt; the off chance someone is blind sided by a format change, the new\n&gt; packet maintains its &quot;discoverability&quot; ideally allowing a developer to\n&gt; adapt quickly to the format as is, without necessarily having the\n&gt; formal documentation from the provider.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, through these mechanisms, the network can remain robust, and even\n&gt; have a bit of &quot;self-repairability&quot;. Certainly not in an automated\n&gt; sense, humans will be involved, but the quality is still there and it\n&gt; can be effective.\n&gt;\n&gt; Imagine the format changes from a consumer on the opposite side of the\n&gt; world. That consumer may well be able to be back up and running with\n&gt; no input from the provider, rather than going through a length email\n&gt; exchange 12 hrs apart. Fixing the problem in 1hr vs several days of\n&gt; playing email tag because neither party is conscious the same time as\n&gt; the other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, that&#39;s the way I read this. This is my understanding of what\n&gt; is trying to be accomplished.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
