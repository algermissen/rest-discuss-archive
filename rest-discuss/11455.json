Any feedback is welcome.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://tinyurl.com/ddd7-rest\n&gt;&gt; [2] http://www.developerday.co.uk/\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting presentation.  A couple of thoughts, keyed by slide number\n&gt; in square brackets:\n&gt;\n&gt; * [14] The idea that all important resources are given one URI seems\n&gt;  more restrictive than need be -- I don&#39;t see a problem with having\n&gt;  multiple URIs for one resource (GET /orders/latestday and GET /orders/20081107\n&gt;  might return the same results, at least today), or having a URI that\n&gt;  returns a collection of resources.  When describing REST to newbies,\n&gt;  I prefer a statement like &quot;All interesting resources are given at least\n&gt;  one URI&quot; to get to the point I think you&#39;re trying to make here.\n\nInteresting. This is actually a direct quote from Roy&#39;s 2007 ApacheCon\ntalk (from which I have borrowed liberally - and acknowledged).\n\nI also don&#39;t have a problem with &gt; 1 URI per resource, for example in\nconneg having .atom, .html, and .fr.html so long as the\nContent-Location header is correctly set.\n\nPerhaps I should rephrase to &quot;All important resources are identified\nby at least one (uniform) resource identifier mechanism ...&quot; and\nprovide commentary on Content-Location.\n\n&gt; * [24] Although a particular system might have both REST and WS_* interfaces,\n&gt;  I would hope you make the point in your comments that it&#39;s unlikely you will\n&gt;  be able to use the same server side classes to process both kinds of requests.\n&gt;  Properly done, the two kinds of resource classes will be organized\n&gt;  quite differently, but developers new to this still think they can\n&gt; be combined.\n\nYes. The point is that a system can compose both, not a class.\n\n&gt; * [27] Maybe I just missed it, but I would have expected to see a discussion of\n&gt;  supporting multiple representations somewhere (maybe here).  Maybe its also\n&gt;  because this particular area is the most troubling about REST for me\n&gt; ... even if\n&gt;  you have agreed to an XML representation, how is the client supposed to &quot;know&quot;\n&gt;  that a &lt;link/&gt; element is actually a URI that can be used to\n&gt; instigate a state change,\n&gt;  as opposed to (say) a &lt;uri&gt; element instead?\n\nI didn&#39;t want to bog down into implementation details, to be honest. I\nwill be talking about the importance of media-types and the use of\nAccept* for conneg, but not as a Fallacy / Fact thing - just\ncommentary.\n\n&gt; Craig McClanahan\n\n"}}
