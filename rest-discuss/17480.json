Not jus=\r\nt a\ndatabase w/ links in responses, but one that _automatically_ produces\nt=\r\nhe hypermedia affordances appropriate for each response. In fact, I\nwonder =\r\nif this is desirable|possible. Right now my head is in a space\nwhere the hy=\r\npermedia controls are the real &quot;design work&quot; tied to a\nparticular set of us=\r\ne cases - not something that is native to the data\nbeing passed about. But =\r\nthat&#39;s just me (and where I am today).\n\nNot long ago I saw a Ted Nelson vid=\r\neo[1] where he talks about Zigzag\ndata[2]. It&#39;s interesting, but I don&#39;t ye=\r\nt think (from what I&#39;ve seen\nthere) that Zizag is a hypermedia database.\n\nS=\r\ntill, a true hypermedia database is an intriguing idea.\n\n[1] http://www.you=\r\ntube.com/watch?v=3DWEj9vqVvHPc\n[2] http://www.xanadu.com/zigzag/\n\nmca\nhttp:=\r\n//amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#m=\r\ne\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 19, 2011=\r\n at 09:49, Mark Baker &lt;distobj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, Apr 19, 2011 at 6:=\r\n35 AM, algermissen1971\n&gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; My take on it =\r\n(but maybe outdated by now).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, interesting. I&#39;ve been using it rec=\r\nently and had pretty much the\n&gt; same thoughts esp regarding the non-use of =\r\nhypermedia (and related,\n&gt; it&#39;s lack of hierarchy).
