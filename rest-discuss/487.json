This goes back to the meaning\nof PUT vs. POST.\n\nIf you assume that these notifications carry no information, which I\nbelieve you&#39;ve been doing, then I could understand why you&#39;d see them\nas equivalent.  But if you accept my &quot;optimization&quot; mentioned earlier,\nthat the body should carry some representation of the change, then\nthose representations mean different things when done with PUT or\nPOST.\n\n&gt; &gt; In this case, the server only needs to use POST, not M-POST, because\n&gt; &gt; the client provides the context (the callback URI) in which idempotence\n&gt; &gt; (or lack thereof) is determined.\n&gt; \n&gt; M-POST, isn&#39;t that a SOAP thing?\n\nNo, it&#39;s from RFC 2774.  It&#39;s what you were trying to do with RPOST\nearlier.\n\n&gt; I would say PUT would be the right method. You are &quot;PUT&quot;ting the binary\n&gt; notification that &quot;something changed&quot;. As an optimization you may\n&gt; include a diff of what changed. But the core semantic content of the\n&gt; message is idempotent. If you get it twice, ignore the second.\n\nPUT is *a* right method, but so is POST.  It depends on the app, and\non what the subscriber wants.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
