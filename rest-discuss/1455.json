He says that a client can\n&gt; provide the URI directly to the target Web service (resource),\n[...]\n&gt; &quot;We were able to have 2 web services on the same machines with different\n&gt; URI, using WebLogic.&quot;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t used WebLogic, so I can&#39;t verify his statement.\n&gt; Can someone settle this debate please?\n\nI was pointing out that most HTTP servers have configuration capabilities\nthat make it easy to target the same internal HTTP handler for many\ndifferent URI - which was the question of the original message. The question\nlooked to me like &quot;Can I have two SOAP listeners on the same web server at\ntwo different URI?&quot;\n\nI also pointed out that replicating the URI to within the SOAP message\n(either header or body) would be necessary. I didn&#39;t say it was a good idea\nor that it should be done this way, but rather that it would be required to\nwork at all.\nBut what I should have said was that it would only be necessary if the URI\nwere fine-grained and pointed to a resource to operate on rather than a\nservice. If the URI referenced the soap service itself, then that particular\nURI wouldn&#39;t need to be part of the soap message. Any data needed for the\noperation would already be bundled in the message, but then we get into the\nwhole non-addressable data issue.\n\n\n\n"}}
