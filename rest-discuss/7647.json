This\n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; you are posting the state of a new service (which includes\n&gt; &gt; configuration) to a service factory. It would create a resource to\n&gt; &gt; represent the ongoing state of the service. A DELETE would destroy\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; service, a PUT would change its state.\n&gt; There is a key difference with instantiation. In the case of \n&gt; blueprints, adding a blueprints did result in the creation of sub- \n&gt; resource.\n&gt; Example:\n&gt; http://server/host/blueprints/my_new_blueprint\n&gt; However, in the case of instantiation, there is no sub-resource \n&gt; assumption. Thus, the location of the new service could be:\n&gt; http://server/my_new_service\n&gt; I think the sub-resource relationship is key to the container \n&gt; patters, because it defines scope of influence. However, I can&#39;t \n&gt; apply this restriction to the Host service, which is peer to other \n&gt; services.\n\nMaybe to a human designer on the server side, but in practice from all\nperspectives... I don&#39;t think so. You might want to give the pattern a\ndifferent name when the resources aren&#39;t given a subpath under the\nfactory resource, but the mechanism and concept is the same. For this\nreason I usually talk about factories rather than containers. The state\nmay be demarcated by resources hosted under the factory&#39;s path, or\nelsewhere (Created). The new state may be added to the factory resource\ndirectly, or given no client-visible handle at all (OK, or No Content).\n\nI have heard about the container pattern described several times, but it\nonly really makes sense when we don&#39;t arbitrarily require new resources\nto live under the resource we POSTed to. Clients certainly can&#39;t assume\nit will be so. The semantics of POST don&#39;t include the restriction, and\nit is inadvisible to communicate to the client that they can make the\nassumption. After all, you might change your mind later.\n\nThe Location header in a POST could direct the client anywhere. It might\nbe a partner website. It might contain an authority that takes the\nclient to a different server cluster within your data centre. The client\nmay choose not to apply the same trust metrics to a new authority, or\neven to a different path structure under the same authority. The server\nshould take this into account as part of the design. However, the\nfreedom to decide where the new resource goes is part of the prerogative\nof the server.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
