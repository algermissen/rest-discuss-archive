PUTs are not appropriate to this resource,\n   however it may be appropriate for the resource to PUT to the\n   other resources depending upon their interfaces.\n   This resembles the facade pattern from the Gang of Four.\n\nExplicit composition:\n   The response returned by the resource contains explicit links\n   to its constituant parts. An example would be if the response\n   encoding was XML it could contain XLinks to the constituent\n   parts of the document.\n\n        http://infosystem.org/customers/66726\n\n        &lt;customer&gt;\n            &lt;primary title=&quot;Primary Customer Information&quot;\n                     href=&quot;http://store1.some.org/customers/6672&quot;\n                     show=&quot;embed&quot;\n                     actuate=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;secondary title=&quot;Secondary Customer Information&quot;\n                     href=&quot;http://store2.some.org/customers/6672&quot;\n                     show=&quot;embed&quot;\n                     actuate=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/customer&gt;\n\n   (Disclaimer - I know little about xlink aside from the examples\n    in my 1999 XML Pocket reference so the example above is\n    probably completely wrong, but you get the idea.)\n\n   The client requesting this resource must immediately retrieve\n   and embed the resources referenced by the response. The client\n   now has sufficient information to PUT or POST to the initial\n   resource or any of the embedded resources. Whether the client\n   has the authority to do so is a separate issue.\n\nI leave the pros and cons for each approach as an exercise for the\nreader, but I would point out that processing the explicit\ncomposition response requires a much more intelligent client,\nie. not a browser.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: jan@... [mailto:jan@...]On Behalf Of Jan\n&gt; Algermissen\n&gt; Sent: Friday, 9 July 2004 2:16 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Distributed Requests\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; in the work I currently do, the issue described below keeps popping up\n&gt; and I just can&#39;t figure out, what exactly REST&#39;s position about it is.\n&gt; I would be deeply thankful for any additional thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I am dealing with customer data that is distributed accross\n&gt; diverse data sources and I want to provide a single point of access\n&gt; in order to provide an integrated view on the various pieces of\n&gt; data about a single customer.\n&gt;\n&gt; While this is not a big deal in itself, I would like to do this as\n&gt; RESTful as possible; hence my questions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; First I &#39;create&#39; a resource for every customer on the host that\n&gt; is to be the single point of access, e.g.:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://infosystem.org/customers/66726\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The server application managing these resources, simply needs to\n&gt; distribute requests to the various data stores, integrate the results\n&gt; and send back whatever is appropriate (e.g. HTML or RDF).\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I want the interaction between the portal and the various\n&gt; data sources\n&gt; to also be done via HTTP and here is where the interesting part starts.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are two possibilities to ask a data source about information for\n&gt; the customer http://infosystem.org/customers/66726:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) Use the URL as a parameter to an indexable[1] (queryable) resource,\n&gt;     for example:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://store1.some.org/customerdata?identifier=http://infosystem.o\n&gt; rg/customers/66726\n&gt;\n&gt;     and make the &#39;portal URIs&#39; known to the wrapper application\n&gt; that exposes\n&gt;     the however-stored data via HTTP so it &#39;knows&#39; what customer\n&gt; is being asked\n&gt;     for.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Create resources for each customer on the various\n&gt; datastore-hosts, e.g.\n&gt;     http://store1.some.org/customers/6672 and make it known to the portal\n&gt;     server (or an intermediary) that, for example\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://infosystem.org/customers/66726 owl:same\n&gt; http://store1.some.org/customers/6672\n&gt;     http://infosystem.org/customers/66726 owl:same\n&gt; http://store2.some.org/customers/6672\n&gt;\n&gt;     so that the portal/intermediary can distribute the original\n&gt; request to all\n&gt;     the owl:same resources in order to send back a representation that is\n&gt;     the combination of all the representations retrieved by the\n&gt; distributed requests.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would clearly rule out (1), because if one starts doing this, I\n&gt; cannot see any\n&gt; advantage of having a unique addressing space. If (1) was a\n&gt; RESTful option, this\n&gt; could well be extended to arbitrary property/value constellations\n&gt; for communicating\n&gt; what one refers to, e.g.\nhttp://store.org/about?http://myprops/ISBN=0093661778\nThis would IMHO break the whole idea of simply &#39;uttering a URI&#39;.\n\nThe questions I have about (2) are:\n\n- although I have never heard any objections from the REST POV against a\nresource\n  spanning multiple authorities, I am still not sure that REST explicitly\nallows\n  the situation described in (2). I am thinking of this as to &#39;distribute\nthe\n  invocation of the representation-resource membership function&#39;....ok?\n\n- usually, several representations returned for multiple requests to a\nsingle\n  resource are understood to be mutually exclusive, but in the case\ndescribed in\n  (2), the various representations are *combined* to form another one.\n  Is this RESTful?\n\n- I would also like to do this the other way round (distributing POST,PUT\nand\n  DELETE) and while technically possible, I am also not sure if this case\n  would break any REST constraint.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\nJan\n\n[1] which is (thanks Mark :o) formally defined as\n    http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/Indexable/\n\n\n--\nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
