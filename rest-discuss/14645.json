When you follow some &lt;link rel=3D=\r\n&quot;/featured-product&quot; href=3D&quot;/products/3776&quot;/&gt; link and the servers sends an=\r\n HTML page back do you understand the meaning of the steady state from look=\r\ning at the Content-Type header or do you add-in the information that the se=\r\nrver told you the resource you just requested is &#39;the featured product&#39;?\n\n\n=\r\n\n&gt; As to the issue of steady-states, consider the browser.  The user\n&gt; foll=\r\nows one link, but the next steady-state may only be achieved by\n&gt; dereferen=\r\ncing pertinent URIs within the initial representation.  Your\n&gt; post implies=\r\n that there&#39;s a 1:1 relationship between that initial\n&gt; representation&#39;s re=\r\ntrieval and the next steady-state.\n\nNo. At least I did not want to imply th=\r\nat. The steady state is reached when all the outstanding sub-requests have =\r\nbeen made and then, when the client has no pending requests - on what basis=\r\n does it determine the meaning of the state?\n\nIn a machine client this woul=\r\nd mean: &quot;what information is taken into account to determine the next trans=\r\nition to follow? Just the media types of the steady state or also the conte=\r\nxt of the request?\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;algermissen1971&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen a client is in a steady state, what makes up the meaning of the\n&gt; &gt; sta=\r\nte (what information does the client use to determine the meaning)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a) The current representation (plus the understanding of the media\n&gt; &gt; ty=\r\npes) b) The current representation (plus the understanding of the\n&gt; &gt; media=\r\n types) and the request the client made (the knowledge of the\n&gt; &gt; semantics=\r\n of the resource that the representation has been obtained\n&gt; &gt; from) c) b) =\r\nand knowledge about all the requests it made before (this\n&gt; &gt; is wrong from=\r\n a REST POV, but I include it for completeness)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that b) inclu=\r\ndes knowledge about any conneg that might have\n&gt; &gt; happened.
