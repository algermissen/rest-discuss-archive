Thanks for the reply.\n&gt;    \n&gt; &gt; First,=\r\n why the resource is &quot;at&quot; one server. It should be location-less, or in IT =\r\nwords &quot;shared&quot;. Second, a resource may have all the URIs you want, or that =\r\nit needs, that is not a restriction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry - I don&#39;t understand this! =\r\n=3D0(\n&gt; \n\nOk. In your blog you mention that you have one resource in one se=\r\nrver. The location-less in this case is that a resource cannot be bound to =\r\none server, since that hurts scalability. So, the resources are usually &quot;sh=\r\nared&quot; by various servers.\n\nNow, I now understand you post, I think. You des=\r\ncribe a situation where two different applications are used, so each one ha=\r\ns its own resource, that happens to be the same (semantically, at least). W=\r\nell, not quite. Here you have actually two resources meaning different thin=\r\ngs, but a similar thing for the client. In this case, the client must work =\r\ntoward integration, by requesting from one app (A) and sending to the other=\r\n (B) what this B one requires.\n\nAnother way is to have the B able to talk d=\r\nirectly to A. Which I get from your post.\n \n&gt; &gt; Third, I plenty support tha=\r\nt resources are locatable and accessible by any node in a network, and REST=\r\n is for networking systems, so I don&#39;t see why is there a restriction for s=\r\nervers to be clients.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good... I think... !\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, as FOREST to be=\r\n a pattern and not an style, means it is applicable to tactic design. That =\r\nmeans it is local, and thus may not be applicable to the whole system. In f=\r\nact, as you actually go into details of implementation, it IS a pattern.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; No - it&#39;s a whole-system Pattern. If Patterns have to be local, then I h=\r\nave to stop calling it a Pattern. Any ideas? &#39;Sub-style&#39;? Ug.\n&gt; \n\nOk, I wou=\r\nld say it is local, since it is a pattern for integration.\nYou can read mor=\r\ne about the pattern, styles and idioms here http://wmp-archi.blogspot.com/2=\r\n009/10/styles-pattern-and-idioms.html. \n\n&gt; &gt; What I mean is that your REST =\r\napplications may contain parts implemented using FOREST and others using ot=\r\nher patterns. Thus, you need:\n&gt; &gt; 1. Identify the context where your patter=\r\nn can be used (as the title suggest, cases where we need integration may be=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yah - Enterprise Mashups! =3D0)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Identify the particular p=\r\nroblem it is solving.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK - this is tricky, because I think it has a ve=\r\nry wide applicability. It may even satisfy /all/ your Integration Needs! =\r\n=3D0)\n&gt;    \n\nI would check the particular problem of integration you are so=\r\nlving.\n\n&gt; &gt; 3. You already defined the solution, even getting down to propo=\r\nse implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wait till I write the FOREST prototype for Jetty...=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to call it &quot;a type of FOREST that begins with &#39;J&#39; - for Ja=\r\nva&quot;: &#39;Jungle&#39;! =3D0)\n&gt; \n\nGood one!\n\n&gt; &gt; 4. List the consequences of applyin=\r\ng it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ka-ching! $$ Profit!! =3D0)  \n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t really say this until I=\r\n&#39;ve got some real-world experience of applying &#39;Jungle&#39; and the FOREST Patt=\r\nern/Sub-Style.\n&gt; \n\nActually, that is the other part of a Pattern that is re=\r\nquired: a Pattern should be a proven solution that is normally used. So, I =\r\nguess you are proposing a solution and if everybody buys it, then you got y=\r\nourself a pattern! :D\n\n&gt; &gt; Will read it again, trying to understand each bi=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks - again, I really appreciate the feedback.. If it resonates =\r\nwith you (or anyone else) I&#39;d be really happy to explore the ideas with you=\r\n, and to be challenged on the details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Duncan Cragg\n&gt;  \n\nSure!. It wou=\r\nld be a pleasure! \n\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n\n"}}
