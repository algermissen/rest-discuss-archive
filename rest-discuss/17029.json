However, that still leads to the question another poster had made.. it&#39;s not guaranteed that a consumer of the api will always work. If anything it will ignore rel=&quot;&quot; values that it was not written to handle. So if the API evolves to include new rel=&quot;&quot; types, then only new consumers that know about those ahead of time will know what they mean and whether or not they should follow the href link or not. That is what I think is confusing to many. More so, I can provide my own non-known custom XML chunk back, complete with atom:link or my own link format, with rel/href/type attributes just as well as xhtml can with an &lt;a&gt; link. So even if an API uses XHTML as the media type, the &lt;a&gt; links (anchors) are not going to guarantee any client consuming that api that they will evolve with additional rel=&quot;&quot;\n&gt;  types. Probably more important is that they should not break. If the API keeps all the existing links, but adds new ones, then only new consumers that are written with the knowledge of the new API version/links, will make use of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence why, still, I am having a hard time with the idea of using xhtml as a response type for my data elements over just my own custom xml format with links embedded in it.\n\nA good mediatype like XHTML constrains the format of the message, the \nrepresentation of it, without constraining the actual message which is \nencoded.\n\nOften the problem is in tying down the definition of &quot;client&quot; or &quot;user \nagent&quot;, when you have a mediatype like XHTML there are many different \nlayers of client and user agent, you have one which handles the \nprotocol, then another which handles the mediatype, and then an \nunbounded set of agents which consult the message encoded within the \nserialization and act on different parts of the message, sometimes they \nneed to understand the whole message, but most of the time they only \nneed to understand part of the message, the part which answers the \nquestion they have been asked.\n\nLink relation are not exclusively part of the media type, sure the media \ntype can depend on a core set of relations like &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; to \nhandle certain media type semantics, but the set of link relations can \nbe unbounded as the rest apply to the message which is encoded, and not \nthe media type.\n\nThis allows agents which handle the display of a message to look for \nrel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; whilst custom agents/scripts may be looking for \nrel=&quot;acquaintance&quot; in one scenario or rel=&quot;mother&quot; in another, similarly \nthe rel&#39;s themselves aren&#39;t dumb tokens, they are mapped to full URIs \nwhich are universal identifiers for the relationship type.\n\nSo, the client&#39;s don&#39;t need to be upgraded, depending on your definition \nof client that is, because you have one client which understands the \nmediatype and it&#39;s semantics, then others which understand different \nkinds and parts of messages encoded.\n\nMake sense?\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
