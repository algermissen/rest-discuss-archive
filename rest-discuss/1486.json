That&#39;s\nwhy there is a benefit in separating the always-standadized bits\n(methods) from the sometimes standardized bits (representations). It\nwill be much easier to convince the world to standardize on your patient\nrecord vocabulary than on an &quot;API&quot; with more operational (workflow,\nbusiness model, ...) semantics.\n\n&gt; ... Some understanding between the two parties has to be achieved before\n&gt; you can start making use of it. RDF might change things but until then, I&#39;m\n&gt; resigned to the fact that it&#39;s impossible to expect to use a web service\n&gt; (SOAP or REST) without some development effort.\n\nI agree. I&#39;ll be even more pessimistic and say that semantic web\ntechnologies will not change this basic situation. When I walk into a\nbank wanting some foreign money, I need to know what an &quot;exchange rate&quot;\nis. If I write a currency trading client application it will need to\nknow that same thing. I.e. it needs to know the concept and it needs to\nknow either what term you will use for the concept or be able to map\nyour term into its concept.\n\nHere&#39;s what I hope the semantic web technologies will do:\n\n a) improve the extensibility of representations to allow protocol\nevolution\n\n b) raise the level of abstraction so that rather than working with\n&quot;elements and attributes&quot; we can more easily work with objects that\nreflect higher level concerns.\n\n c) allow declarative (rather than programmatic) ways of configuring\nclients and servers to talk to each other. &quot;When the server says\npatient_height, it means what the client calls the person&#39;s height\nproperty&quot; &quot;if the server says the order is shipped that implies that the\nclient cannot cancel any more.&quot;\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
