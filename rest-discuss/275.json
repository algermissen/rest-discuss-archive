To do so,\n&gt; Mallory subscribes to Bob, but gives Alice&#39;s URI to Bob as the\n&gt; Subscriber / EventTarget.  Even if Bob authenticates Mallory --- indeed,\n&gt; even if Mallory is a valid user from Bob&#39;s perspective --- that still\n&gt; doesn&#39;t prevent Mallory from using Bob to attack Alice.  Somehow, the\n&gt; &quot;client&quot; that requests a subscription needs to be verifiably the &quot;same&quot;\n&gt; in some sense as the Subscriber / EventTarget.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suggested solution:  the response to the Subscription POST SHOULD\n&gt; contain a SubscriptionID header with some arbitrary token.  The\n&gt; Subscriber MUST return this header in the responses to all notifications\n&gt; POSTED by the Publisher (server) to the Subscriber URI.  The Publisher\n&gt; MAY delete any subscription and cease notifications for any Subscriber\n&gt; that fails to return the appropriate SubscriptionID in the response to\n&gt; any notification.\n&gt;\nAnother way to think about this particular approach of creating\nsubscriptions is that it is creating a &#39;route&#39; from a source to a target.\nThe agent creating that route needs permissions to read from the source and\nwrite to the target. In addition, since the target is receiving information\nabout the source, the target needs permissions to read from the source. And\nif the permissions change, then the &#39;route&#39; needs to be updated to reflect\nthat - for example if Alice is denied permission to read the source, the\nroute/subscription should be disabled (if you can&#39;t &#39;see&#39; a resource, you\nshouldn&#39;t be able to &#39;hear&#39; it either). (you can argue that it should be\ndeleted, but re-enabling permissions isn&#39;t going to tell you what\nsubscriptions need to be re-created.)\ndetails details...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
