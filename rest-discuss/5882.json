For instance, RFC3253 (Versioning)  \n&gt;&gt; introduces separate URIs for version histories and versions (basic  \n&gt;&gt; versioning).\n&gt; \n&gt; They are all in the archives Julian.  WebDAV is history and my only\n&gt; interest in it is for legacy support.\n\nWell, in the last years I went through the archives several times, and \nnever found a complete proposal that would actually cover those use \ncases that PROPFIND and PROPPATCH try to solve (and do solve, for that \nmatter). So if anybody can provide a pointer, I&#39;d be really be interested.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with MOVE is that it is actually an operation on two\n&gt;&gt;&gt; independent namespaces (the source collection and destination\n&gt;&gt;&gt; collection).  The user must have permission to remove from the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; source collection and add to the destination collection, which\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can be a bit of a problem if they are in different authentication\n&gt;&gt;&gt; realms.  COPY has a similar problem, but at least in that case\n&gt;&gt;&gt; only one namespace is modified.  I don&#39;t think either of them map\n&gt;&gt;&gt; very well to HTTP.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; That seems to be a problem with the concept of moving resources  \n&gt;&gt; around, not with the actual definition of the MOVE method, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it is a problem with specifying multiple arguments when both the\n&gt; syntax and the access control mechanism assume there is only one.\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t quite fit in the original HTTP syntax.\n\nThat&#39;s correct. So are you suggesting that there&#39;s a way to model a move \noperation without specifying two arguments that should have been used to \ndefine a MOVE-like method?\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
