No\n&gt; &gt;support for installing extension functions on their servers, but with\n&gt; &gt;the document() function, you can call external services via http\n&gt; &gt;requests.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; They allow arbitrary user-supplied stylesheets to make arbitrary\n&gt; outgoing HTTP requests from their servers???!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow! That&#39;s an accident waiting to happen ... who needs a bunch of IRC\n&gt; zombies when you can hijack Amazons boxes for a DDoS.\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul, I suggest that until they fix it you _don&#39;t_ flag it up as an\n&gt; exemplar. Do you have a contact at Amazon?\n\nHijacking Amazon&#39;s boxes is not a &quot;DDoS&quot;. You can at best launch one \nattack per connection from your box to Amazon&#39;s. All you&#39;ve done is \ninsert Amazon as an intermediary. You could have done the same with \nBabelfish. I&#39;m not going to bug Amazon about this issue until I \nunderstand the danger myself. Babelfish has been doing GETs-on-my-behalf \nfor several years. I can see how the feature could be very useful for \ncombinign multiple information sources.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
