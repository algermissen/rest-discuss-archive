This is a great question, but most stateful\nservers today do the right thing.  They provide for the old version and the\nnew version, with a mapping between them.  Thus stateful server evolution is\nfine if the server has been built for evolution, and most of the &quot;real&quot;\nsystems do.   Heck, we do side-by-side deployment too with a ton of\nvariables to control how to direct.  \n\nProperly built stateful servers are often higher user-perceived performance\nin versioning when the server side state is migrated to a new version in\nbetween client requests, rather than at run-time as the client request with\nthe old state comes in.  \n\nThe question can be turned around a bit, and consider what happens when a\nstateful client is replaced in the middle of a conversation with a server by\na new client which is just like the old one but has no idea what state the\nserver is within its application.  \n\nI think the question of location of client vs server state and\nversioning/evolvability is a very complicated decision, and some of the\nfactors include how much the client is &quot;trusted&quot;, how much\ntime/processing/resource usage is on the client vs the server, the data set\nbetween the two, etc.  The Web works in many ways because the time on the\nclient is long compared to on the server (sub x second response time for\nthose humans), the client can go away at any time (ie not trusted to do\ngarbage collection properly), and the data sets are small (typically you\njust need to handle the amount of data that the client has entered to\nreconstruct the state).  The more you change those (and other) factors, the\nmore you lean towards server-side state.  There&#39;s trade-offs in network\nperformance, user-perceived performance, and other network and application\nproperties that get adjusted.  There&#39;s just no way that large data sets on\nthe server communicating a small data set to well behaved (from a gcol\nperspective) clients where the server does most of the computing are going\nto be made client-side stateful.   \n\nTo paraphrase somebody, you&#39;ve got to do the analysis for yourself and\nfigure out which architectural style makes sense given your applications\nrequirements.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n[mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Roy T.
