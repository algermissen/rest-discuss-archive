To pick a wire format for which there are dozens\n&gt; of toolkits poised to directly translate the protocol into readily\n&gt; consumable bits.\n\nAgreed.  I&#39;ve seen way too many XML apps traipse through raw DOMs\npicking out their data.  Getting the your data in readily consumable\nbits is a great service.\n\nIs the huge amount of SOAP infrastructure a means to simply get data\nin readily consumable bits?  What if RESTful toolkits with marshalling\ncode were common.  Where would we be in discussing the architectural\nstyles between &lt;that which SOAP generally exhibits but which has no\nname*&gt; and REST?\n\nIn simple implementations, like XML-RPC, marshalling is about half of\nthe implementation with procedure call semantics the other half.\nCreating an HTTP request library that just marhsalls data should be\nthat much simpler than one that relays calls.\n\n  -- Ken\n\n* I don&#39;t think of this as a SOAP vs. REST debate per se, maybe we can\n  come up with a better term for the SOAP style than &quot;that which is\n  not REST but is like messaging or RPC&quot;.\n\n"}}
