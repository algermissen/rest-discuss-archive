( I agree there&#39;s not enough discussion of the implications of Link=\r\ned Data and provenance or versioning, or also, how to denote the effects an=\r\nd semantics of updating linked data with POST or PUT).\n\nBut the basic jist =\r\nis this -- ontologies are similar to relational database schemas, and they =\r\nneed to be versioned like data models.  But the benefit is that they&#39;re &#39;op=\r\nen world&#39; and can thus be extended or made equivalent to concepts in other =\r\nontologies.    Which extensions or equivalences you want to consume comes d=\r\nown to the level of trust you place on them -- especially if they&#39;re consum=\r\ned dynamically over hypermedia. \n\nThe practice of using named graphs gives =\r\nyou a construct of creating multiple worlds of data that may have different=\r\n interpretations associated with them, and a language like SPARQL gives you=\r\n the ability to query across these named graphs with a &#39;dynamic closed worl=\r\nd assumption&#39;.   \n\nI suspect that, practically speaking, any agent is going=\r\n to have to bind to _some_ version of the ontology that it understood, perh=\r\naps dynamically extending it as it goes along (based on hypermedia sensing =\r\ntrusted links), but frankly we&#39;re (as an industry) far away from even level=\r\n of sophistication in our agents  :-)     There are some interesting papers=\r\n out there on &quot;knowledge programming with sensing&quot; that I think would be qu=\r\niet inspirational to anyone looking at how a next-generation linked data ag=\r\nent might work.\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Ju=\r\nlian Everett &lt;julian.everett@...&gt;\nTo: Simon Reinhardt &lt;simon.reinhardt@=\r\nkoeln.de&gt;; Rest List &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 3,=\r\n 2009 9:53:51 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Linked Data and REST architectural=\r\n style (was: This is REST)\n\n\nThe relevance of the REST architectural style =\r\nto Linked Data and\nOWL/SKOS/etc has been nagging away in the back of my min=\r\nd for the last\nfew months. \n\nThe idea of defining (and even considering the=\r\n maintenance overhead of)\nan OWL snapshot of a knowledge domain and binding=\r\n to it via restricted\nvocabulary metadata fills me with fear.

The best I can c=\r\nome up with is that the&lt;br&gt;\nDBpedia, Freebase, OpenCyc ontologies should be=\r\n viewed as the knowledge&lt;br&gt;\nrepresentation equivalents of standard MIME ty=\r\npes (or metamedia types?),&lt;br&gt;\nand that hypermedia should be used for runti=\r\nme binding to the immediate&lt;br&gt;\nsibling nodes of a concept within those sta=\r\nndard ontologies (thereby&lt;br&gt;\navoiding the versioned contract binding night=\r\nmare). Any approach like&lt;br&gt;\nthat would make me feel a lot more comfortable=\r\n that just tagging stuff&lt;br&gt;\nwith DBpedia URIs, which seems to violate a wh=\r\nole raft of basic&lt;br&gt;\narchitectural principles e.g. encapsulation and separ=\r\nate of&lt;br&gt;\ninterface/implement ation.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo my (clearly limited) mind=\r\n, these seem like really important questions&lt;br&gt;\nand I don&#39;t think they are=\r\n receiving enough consideration in linked&lt;br&gt;\ndata/semantic web circles at =\r\npresent?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nregards&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJulian&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-----Original Message---=\r\n--&lt;br&gt;\nFrom: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;re=\r\nst-discuss@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt; [mailto:&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rest-d=\r\niscuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;rest-discuss@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;\nOn Behalf=\r\n Of Simon Reinhardt&lt;br&gt;\nSent: 03 March 2009 15:58&lt;br&gt;\nCc: Rest List&lt;br&gt;\nSub=\r\nject: Re: [rest-discuss] This is REST&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSolomon Duskis wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nCraig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;rel&quot; seems like a good start and I think&lt;br&gt;\nthat=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; building on that idea can lead to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; complia=\r\nnt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; RESTful application.  I think it may be a problem that may be sol=\r\nved &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with an &quot;As Simple As Possible,&quot; well known media-type plus a gu=\r\nide on&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; how to develop &quot;rel&quot; dictionaries.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis is basic=\r\nally what RDF provides: a common data model (and a bunch of&lt;br&gt;\ndefined for=\r\nmats for it) and a simple, distributed way for defining your&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;rel&quot; valu=\r\nes, encouraging you to re-use the ones defined by others so&lt;br&gt;\nthat a Web =\r\nservice client needs less built-in knowledge about your&lt;br&gt;\nservice.&lt;br&gt;\nAn=\r\nd Linked Data [1] is all about taking one entry point and traversing&lt;br&gt;\nth=\r\ne data Web from there dynamically by following the links provided&lt;br&gt;\n(choo=\r\nsing those which have a &quot;rel&quot; type that matches your intentions).&lt;br&gt;\nLinke=\r\nd Data is mainly about linking up open data of course but its&lt;br&gt;\nprinciple=\r\ns can easily be applied to closed applications which, I think,&lt;br&gt;\nwould be=\r\nnefit from that.&lt;br&gt;\nJust one way of doing it, but I more and more think th=\r\nat the ideas&lt;br&gt;\nbehind Linked Data and REST overlap largely. :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nRegards,&lt;br&gt;\n  Simon&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[1] &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://linkeddata.org/&quot;&gt;http://linkeddata. org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- ------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYahoo!
