It isn&#39;t\nthe case that any protocol with generic interfaces is equal to any other\none. The one that is deployed is (all else equal) MUCH BETTER because of\nthe interoperability you get out of using it.\n\n&gt; ... I know that REST is a methodology and HTTP is an\n&gt; implementation.  I also know that a lot of people say that HTTP is an\n&gt; example of REST.  But that&#39;s where the relationship stops for me.  HTTP (in\n&gt; it&#39;s original incarnation, as I understand it) had a very simple purpose:\n&gt; provide a simple technique to allow researchers to share their works with\n&gt; other researchers.  \n\nBut what does it matter what HTTP was intended to do 12 years ago. HTTP\nhas evolved quite a bit if you look at the specifications. There is\nnothing in those specifications that is specific to some particular\nproblem domain.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; It seems to me that the &quot;REST effort&quot; would progress much better if all\n&gt; conversations would just drop HTTP and talk about implementations in\n&gt; general.  \n\nUntil there is a second REST-designed protocol, HTTP *is* about as\ngeneral as we can get. Plus, a big attraction of REST to me is the power\nof HTTP tools.\n\n * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2002Jul/0074.html\n\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
