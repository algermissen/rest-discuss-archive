If I make it\nanother subresource, e.g.,\n  .../thePerson/editform\nthere&#39;s the (theoretical) possibility of a namespace clash. So, I can\neither define sub-sub-resources\n  .../thePerson/attr/jpegPhoto\n  .../thePerson/other/editform\nwhich is icky, or I can use a query arg or attribute;\n  .../thePerson?repr=editform  --or--\n  .../thePerson;editform\n\nIn combination with the method and conneg hacks, then, I could have\n  .../thePerson?repr=editform&method=PUT&accept=text/xml\n(not really applicable to this representation, but you get the idea)\n\nI think I like using a parameter best; is there any semantic\ndifference worth noting (from a REST standpoint) between query args\nand parameters?\n\nRegarding putting the DN in the URI; I was concerned about\ntypability, etc., until it occured to me earlier today that I could\nhave a &quot;typeable&quot; interface optimised for people hand-typing URIs,\njsut as there&#39;s a search interface optimised for HTML form\nsubmission; e.g.,\n  http://addresses.example.org/name/Mark+Nottingham\nor somesuch.\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jan 16, 2002 at 08:01:03AM -0000, mdierken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, conneg is still useful to expose, but lack of support in\n&gt; &gt; browsers means that another means of doing this -- probably with\n&gt; &gt; query strings (or maybe path parameters?) -- will have to be hacked.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *sigh* \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve used the ?method= approach for a couple years (actually used \n&gt; do:method for collision avoidance) to tunnel methods.
