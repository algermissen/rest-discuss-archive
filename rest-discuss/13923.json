You are not querying the  \nresources but invoking the GET method.\n\n&gt; Logically, one would\n&gt; ASSUME they&#39;re identical.\n\nIt is a matter of what URI you communicate to the client as the &#39;entry  \npoint&#39;. If the client only relies on the knowledge of /resource then  \nthe server has more freedom to add more variants later or change the  \nURIs of the variants. In the &#39;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&#39; mindset / \nresource would be &#39;cool&#39; and the specific ones would just be URIs  \ndiscovered at runtime, likely to change at some point.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; From a caching point of view, they are separate requests. A cache that\n&gt; has the XML representation won&#39;t be able to answer a JSON query, so\n&gt; both have a similar caching impact in terms of ensuring that the cache\n&gt; is properly synced with both representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, on the surface, they really don&#39;t seem that much different to me.\n&gt; I was curious what other folks thought.\n\nThe approach is different. The latter one offers more flexibility. The  \nserver can even anser with an explanatory body if the request is Not  \nAcceptable, telling the client what variants are available. This\nhelps decoupling (less assumptions made by the client).\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
