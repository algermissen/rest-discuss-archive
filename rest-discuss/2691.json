I misinterpreted what Dan was saying.  We were in agreement all\nalong.\n\n&gt; I agree with the points you had made, but the current reading of &quot;Obligations&quot;\n&gt; here:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/get7#obligations\n&gt; \n&gt; would indicate that some GET operation even with Google&#39;s counter would\n&gt; be okay since the user agreed to those terms when obtaining a developer key.\n\nHmm, I don&#39;t read it that way.  Is it the part that says\n\n&quot;This is not to say that there are never any obligations related to following links&quot;\n\nthat leads you to believe this?  FWIW, I had to do a double-take on\nthat, but the word &quot;related&quot; is quite key there, as the example\ndemonstrates.\n\n&gt; Will this document be updated to reflect the issue you raised?\n\nThe only issue I raised, that for some reason got lots of support, was\nthat a pay-per-use example would probably be helpful to people.  But I\ndoubt it&#39;s a high priority item with the TAG - nor do I think it&#39;s very\nimportant.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
