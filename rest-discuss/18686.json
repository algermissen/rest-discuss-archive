decoration). my clients are &quot;coded to the rel&quot;\nand =\r\nthat&#39;s all.\n\nAlso, I am usually wary of people who say things like &quot;we coul=\r\nd just\nfigure that out implicitly&quot; as this often introducing &quot;coupling base=\r\nd\non assumption&quot; that can limit future mods/enhancements down the line.\n\nFi=\r\nnally, I don&#39;t use a &quot;type&quot; decoration since this leads my client\napps into=\r\n expecting strongly-typed &quot;objects&quot; in the response\nrepresentation. I try t=\r\no avoid this expectation. What clients get back\nis a representation in the =\r\nagree media type. Clients are then able to\nprocess the representation using=\r\n the media type rules and compute,\nrender, and when appropriate, activate t=\r\nhe hypermedia in the response.\nThe &quot;type&quot; is not needed for those steps.\n\nI=\r\nn your case, what is it that the &quot;type&quot; value is used for by the client app=\r\ns?\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.c=\r\nom/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 21, 2012 at 18:51, Ben Niven-Jenkins\n&lt;ben@ni=\r\nven-jenkins.co.uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Folks,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve defined a read only API where l=\r\ninks to other resources follow an Atom like model and include the media-typ=\r\ne & relation as well as the URI, so they look something like this in JSON:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; links: [ { href: &quot;/foo&quot;, type: &quot;fooType&quot;, rel: &quot;self&quot; },\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 { href: &quot;/bar&quot;, type: &quot;barType&quot;, rel: &quot;http://example.com/customeRel&quot; ]=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In a conversation with someone who is not entirely into the whole REST=\r\n thing they commented\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;including the type & relation in the link is ext=\r\nra complexity, if we did it in XML we could just figure that out implicitly=\r\n from the schema when we GET the linked resource&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving aside XML Vs =\r\nJSON arguments (which aren&#39;t relevant to my question) I justified it with a=\r\nn argument that explicitly including the relation meant you didn&#39;t need to =\r\nGET the resource to know what the relationship was (as the same type could =\r\nhave different relations to different resources, e.g. parent vs child relat=\r\nions) and including the type meant the client could know what it was going =\r\nto GET without actually getting it - e.g. &quot;I don&#39;t need to know about barTy=\r\npes right now so I won&#39;t bother getting them until I need to know about the=\r\nm&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; But afterwards I thought to myself while my arguments above seem rea=\r\nsonable there must be other good reasons (that I can&#39;t immediately think of=\r\n) for being explicit with types & relations in links in RESTful APIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; C=\r\nan you help me with your thoughts on what those other good reasons are?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Thanks\n&gt; Ben\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
