The client ac=\r\ntivating controls based on what it learned about resources.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This disc=\r\nussion I think focused on the latter. I am specifically curious of best pra=\r\nctices for the former case, when a RESTful API aims at letting consumer wor=\r\nk through a specific workflow (eg. buying a book online).\n\nThere is a commo=\r\nn confusion (I think - at least it was a confusion for me for years) with r=\r\negard to the idea that the server is prescribing a workflow which the clien=\r\nt follows.\n\nIn a RESTful system, the server actually has no idea about the =\r\napplication (the workflow) that the client executes. It is the client that =\r\nowns the state machine. It is just that the client is programmed not to bli=\r\nndly assume the availability of certain transitions but to make the best of=\r\n the controls it receives along the way.\n\nAt some point, it must give up, o=\r\nbviously - or reach a steady state and wait for a human to make the next mo=\r\nve based on the accumulated information in that steady state.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I thoug=\r\nht the best practice was to let user land ton an entry point resource (eg c=\r\nollection of books) and then let user evolve in the workflow: first by affo=\r\nrding user to initiate the workflow (eg. &quot;rel=3Dbuy&quot; which likely translate=\r\ns with GETing a &quot;buy-a-book-form&quot; resource, letting user discover which inp=\r\nuts are need to start the workflow). Then subsequently, each step in the wo=\r\nrkflow will afford user to confirm an order, select payment information, sh=\r\nipping details... Ultimately the server will confirm creation of an order r=\r\nesource (and maybe  provide a shipment resource allowing user to track ship=\r\nping status or to cancel order, etc.)\n\nIt is still the hard-coded or config=\r\nured decision tree that determines the application here.... it is just that=\r\n hypermedia is the *engine* :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In such typical workflow scenario, is=\r\n it a bad practice to expose rels as &quot;actions&quot; (thus verbs)?\n\nThat is alway=\r\ns bad practice.\n\n&gt; I think of having server sending relevant actions on eac=\r\nh step (as part of resource representations), letting user discover HTTP me=\r\nthods and target resource to interact with as a result of activating the hy=\r\npermedia control (action).\n&gt; \n&gt; In the example of AtomPub, we have a simila=\r\nr hypermedia control &quot;edit&quot; (verb)\n\nWhich is a naming mistake - that should=\r\n have been &#39;source&#39; or so. Meaning: &#39;edit&#39; links points to the resource tha=\r\nt is the &#39;master&#39; - the one you mutate - as opposed to the member entry res=\r\nources.\n\n&gt; to afford atom consumer a given feed entry can be edited. Which =\r\ntranslate with a PUT to the target href (the target feed entry).\n\nOr DELETE=\r\n or PATCH or whatnot.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, what is the best practice to ex=\r\npress hypermedia actions in a RESTful way, to allow consumer to control the=\r\n workflow while the server controls the affordances of the user (based on i=\r\nnternal application state)?\n\nUse link semantics (link rels, but also stuff =\r\nlike &lt;html:img src=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt; or &lt;atom:collection href=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;) to tell the consu=\r\nmer what a target *is* to the context. Let the client decide the rest ... t=\r\nhe server cannot know what the client is programmed to do anyhow. Instead o=\r\nf designing to prescribe application flow, design for max. re-usability.\n\nH=\r\nTH\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Phil\n&gt; \n&gt; Le 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58, Mike Kelly &lt;mikekelly321=\r\n@...&gt; a =E9crit :\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:31 AM, Jan Alge=\r\nrmissen\n&gt;&gt; &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On 0=\r\n8.11.2013, at 02:08, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; not sure i understand the Q, but i&#39;ll offer this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://example.com/rels/publisher&quot; describes the relationship between the sour=\r\nce and the target.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I like to try to emphasize what the targ=\r\net is *to the source* with the goal that the application-level effect of th=\r\ne HTTP methods falls into place.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This IMO helps a great deal with=\r\n avoiding to layer specialized application protocols on top of HTTP (which =\r\nalready is the application protocol).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; IOW, it helps prevent redef=\r\ninitions of the meaning of HTTP methods. POST means POST, it cannot mean &#39;p=\r\nublish the source resource&#39;. DELETE means DELETE, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish=\r\n the the source resource&#39;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Well, those methods have a general m=\r\neaning within the uniform\n&gt;&gt; interface of HTTP whose purpose is to add to t=\r\nhe self-descriptiveness\n&gt;&gt; of messages and, in doing so, to afford intermed=\r\niation across the\n&gt;&gt; system (e.g. web caching). The HTTP method definitions=\r\n attribute\n&gt;&gt; meaning designed for this purpose (e.g. establishing safety,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; idempotency, cacheability, etc).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Provided the link relations are =\r\nnot in conflict with the HTTP\n&gt;&gt; definitions, and are merely qualifying the=\r\n details of methods within\n&gt;&gt; the context of a given transition, then it is=\r\n wrong to think about\n&gt;&gt; that in terms of &quot;redefinition&quot;. It&#39;s qualificatio=\r\nn.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In practice, it&#39;s much easier for consuming parties if your\n&gt;&gt; do=\r\ncumentation is specific by providing an explicit description of the\n&gt;&gt; mean=\r\ning and structure of the various requests possible over a given\n&gt;&gt; link. Le=\r\naving your documentation so abstract that the reader is left\n&gt;&gt; with the ta=\r\nsk of inferring every part of each possible request does\n&gt;&gt; not seem like a=\r\n very pragmatic approach for custom link relations (but\n&gt;&gt; may be more appr=\r\nopriate for standardised link relations).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you find yourself in =\r\na situation that you absolutely must tell the client developer this, rephra=\r\nse the hypermedia semantic (here: the link rel spec).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no=\r\nthing to say againts hints regarding the intended &#39;canonical&#39; use case but =\r\nI can always only be a hint. AtomPub is an example, where the spec tells us=\r\n so much about the interactions between client and server that it looks lik=\r\ne a protocol when it is actually only hints about a canonical application f=\r\nlow. Focussing on resource semantics would have been much nicer, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One simply cannot constrain HTTP servers that way and still have REST=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The importance of HTTP methods from a REST point of view is t=\r\nhat they\n&gt;&gt; create **some** visibility of the client server interactions, s=\r\no that\n&gt;&gt; the messages can be understood to _a certain extent_ by\n&gt;&gt; interm=\r\nediaries. Provided that visibility is not impacted (i.e. a link\n&gt;&gt; rel&#39;s qu=\r\nalification of a method doesn&#39;t _conflict_ with HTTP&#39;s) then\n&gt;&gt; how does th=\r\nis have any bearing on the &quot;RESTfulness&quot; of the\n&gt;&gt; application?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Chee=\r\nrs,\n&gt;&gt; M\n&gt;&gt; \n\n\n"}}
