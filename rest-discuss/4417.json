Imagine an Artist structure with \nname, genre, albums, rating, etc.  I want to both search for Artists \nthat approximate the name or albums, or exactly match a genre or \nrating.  As well, I want to retrieve a given Artist&#39;s information.  \n\nThe retrieval is easy, with something like GET /Artist?\nname=thieverycorp retrieving the structure.  \n\nBut then if want to do a search, I was thinking the best rest way of \nmodeling is to make a Query structure that contains all the Artist \nqueryable information, maybe it&#39;s even the same type, and then have \nan ArtistList resource.  Then I could say that any of the ArtistQuery \nfields can be put in the URI, ie\nGET /ArtistList?name=thieverycorp or GET /ArtistList?albums=blue.\n\nI can&#39;t see a way of using the same URI base for both retrievals and \nqueries without doing some funky parameters in the URI.  There&#39;s a \nvariety of other techniques, like appending the requested return type \n(GET /Artist?name=thieverycorp&type=ArtistList), the number of \nresults to return (GET /Artist?name=thieverycorp&rows=1), etc. but \nthey all seem a bit .... goofy.\n\nAny help on the best way to model this would be appreciated.  I&#39;m \npretty sure this is almost an FAQ kind of question, so even a pointer \nwould be great.\n\nThanks,\nDave Orchard\n\n\n\n"}}
