As an\n&gt; example, The Wayback Machine at archive.org provides explicit\n&gt; details [1] on how users (and software) can construct strings to\n&gt; reference resources in the archive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why this this a bad, subversive, dangerous thing?\n\nNothing breaks. Things start to break if the *only way* to find out how\nto get information out of a web-based service is through generated URIs.\nThe first thing that would break if this convention became common on the\nWeb is the Wayback Machine itself (and Google!). After all, it collects\ninformation by spidering the web and spiders work through links, not\ngenerated URI names.\n\nI don&#39;t mind the half of your philosophy that says: &quot;consistent,\nguessable names are usually a good idea.&quot; The part that I disagree with\nis: &quot;Hey, if I use consistent, guessable names, I can get away without\nhypertext indexes of my data.&quot; If you have a collection of data on the\nweb that you want people to treat as a true collection then you should\nprovide an index to it.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
