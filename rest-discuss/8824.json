Bjorg wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but my mind is too stuborn to see the difference between\n&gt; the two. Are you saying that JSON is better b/c it encodes the type\n&gt; of a value (e.g. bool, numbe, string) in its representation? Isn&#39;t\n&gt; there otherwise a 1-to-1 mapping b/w JSON and XML?\n\nI tend to think that there&#39;s no obvious mapping between JSON and XML; or \nmore appropriately, the same type of mapping between JSON and XML as you \nwould get between C data structures and XML.  Almost nothing.\n\nBut more specifically, JSON has first class support for lists (arrays). \n  How do you represent a list in XML?  There are multiple ways.  Which \nyou will have to describe to someone.  The most compact representations \nusually aren&#39;t self descriptive (ie, &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;... is pretty self \ndescriptive, but not terribly compact).\n\n&gt; One thing that always bugged me about objects was that I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; encapsualte sub-properties without resorting to other objects. For\n&gt; instance, doing something like:\n&gt; doc.settings.alignment = &quot;left&quot;;\n&gt; \n&gt; Here, I would need to have a &#39;doc&#39; object and a &#39;settings&#39; object that\n&gt; contains a reference to &quot;left&quot;. This bugs me because the &#39;settings&#39;\n&gt; kind of object might not be useful anywhere else (I realize that in\n&gt; this example that might not be the case, but let&#39;s stick with it for\n&gt; argument sake).\n&gt; \n&gt; In XML, I don&#39;t have this limitation. Instead, I can say\n&gt; doc[settings/alignment] = &quot;left&quot;;\n&gt; It&#39;s all part of one object (or document; frankly, I don&#39;t see the\n&gt; difference between the two anymore, except that the latter seems to be\n&gt; an evolution of the former).\n\nI don&#39;t grok the example; perhaps it&#39;s XPath; which is part of my \nproblem here; I&#39;ve never bothered to fully learn all the minor XML \ntooling dialects: XML schema, Relax NG, XPath, etc.  Enough to scrape \nby.  Programming languages though ... no problem, I live and breath them.\n\nHaving &#39;objects&#39; poof into life like that is obviously quite nice, and \nsomething most programming languages don&#39;t directly support.\n\n&gt; Could you give a concrete example of where JSON makes life better?\n\nThe best example of making life better is getting people out of the \ndocument design business.  I suppose I&#39;ve suffered through too much \ncrappy XML in my life, that I&#39;ve come to see XML document design as an \nart more than a science.  Data design is usually easier, or at least \nmore obvious.\n\nBut here&#39;s a concrete example I used recently:\n\n     http://muellerware.org/projects/twit-growl/\n\nDownload the twit-growl.py file, then scroll down to line 89, where I \n&#39;load&#39; the JSON into Python objects.  The value for me is that I can \nlook at the JSON output when debugging, and figure out exactly what the \nstructure is that I&#39;ll be needing to use to access the data.  With XML, \nyou can either build XPath queries (which I&#39;m no good at), or use some \nkind of DOM accessor.  In both of those XML cases, I just had to make a \nmental switch to the XML model, instead of being able to stay in the \ndata model the whole time.  XML just got in the way.\n\nA better example would include accessing non-string values out of the \nJSON; in XML, you&#39;ll need to do some conversion from strings to \n[whatever].  In JSON, you get it for free (for numbers, booleans, \nstrings, null).\n\n-- \nPatrick Mueller\nhttp://muellerware.org\n\n\n"}}
