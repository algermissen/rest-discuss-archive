Which doesn&#39;t mean anyone has\nto parse that HTML, they can use XML or JSON directly.  The drawback is\nthat if you change that API, any user-agent directly accessing the raw\ndata will break; whereas if they&#39;re parsing your HTML they&#39;ll be updated\nautomatically.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess what I am grappling with is that for the most part, I would\n&gt; suspect most services like the one I am messing around with to learn,\n&gt; would be used by specific clients, not anyone and everyone out on the\n&gt; web.\n&gt;\n\nDoesn&#39;t matter.  Nobody coding a consumer for your API will understand\na custom media type without training.  Whereas if you express your API\nas HTML, you don&#39;t have this problem; anyone will be able to understand\nit provided they understand HTML (a safe assumption), and you won&#39;t\nneed any custom media types.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
