For example, we can post a DeleteOperationRequest\n&gt;  resource:\n&gt;\n&gt;  POST: http//example.com/deleteOperationRequest\n&gt;\n&gt;  passing the URI of the resource to be deleted.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This returns the URI of the new deleteOperationRequest resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;  GETting this resource will provide information on the operation: done,\n&gt;  failed, cancelled, running (with % done), invoked by, started at, and so\n\n\n&gt;  It is a little RPCish to use a &quot;DeleteOperation&quot;, but the fact that this\n&gt;  is an actual resource (&quot;DeleteOperationRequest&quot;), this seems RESTful\n&gt;  enough to me. I&#39;d like to hear cleaner solutions or comments on this\n&gt;  approach though.\n\nAnother variant.\nWe PUT a file for processing.\nGET on the same url for status.\nOnce the file has been processed a response\nis loaded to the url providing status.\nClearly the GET fails until the response is available.\n\nregards\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
