I think resources are much more like large-grained very\n&gt; &gt; generic objects in that they have methods and identity.  Even the\n&gt; &gt; representation does not need to be limited to &quot;just data&quot; (unless \nwe\n&gt; &gt; consider everything to be &quot;just data&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; I used &#39;data element&#39; because that was the term from Roy&#39;s \ndissertation.\n&gt; I think &#39;data element&#39; is a category of features of a networked\n&gt; architecture - as compared with message flow or processing \nunits/components\n&gt; or whatever.\n\nOk, I re-examined the dissertation and see where you got &quot;resource = \ndata element&quot;.  Table 5-1, right?\n\nSo who am I to say different?  Still don&#39;t make any sense to me, \nespecially if I read the next paragraph of the dissertation:\n\n&quot;5.2.1.1 Resources and Resource Identifiers\nThe key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any \ninformation that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, \na temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a \ncollection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), \nand so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an \nauthor&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a \nresource. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, \nnot the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular \npoint in time.\n\nMore precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership \nfunction MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or \nvalues, which are equivalent.&quot;\n\nDoesn&#39;t smell like a data element to me.  But I suppose the cat is \nout of the bag, huh?\n\n&gt; I would like to clear up the ambiguity though - how about:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The REST documents describe networked systems in terms of three\n&gt; architectural concepts: data elements, components and connectors.\n&gt; Specifically, REST uses these instances of the concepts:\n&gt;  data elements : resource, resource identifier, representation\n&gt;  (etc...)\n\nDoesn&#39;t resolve the problem in my mind, which is that resources are \ndifferent kinds of things from representations.\n\nI&#39;ll withdraw my objection, though, since I am but a pup amongst the \nbig dogs on this corner...\n\n\n"}}
