Mark went into this in his opacity investigations [1] \na bit. 2396 says:\n\n    The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by\n    the resource.\n\nTo me, this indicates that the query has a dual role; it has some \nidentifying properties in client systems, but the query component is \nalso interpreted by the resource in server systems.\n\n\n&gt; The problem I found was that a lot of server environments didn&#39;t nicely\n&gt; support using uri paths segments to acquire &#39;object request handlers&#39; or\n&gt; &#39;resource instances&#39;.\n\nTrue, although I think that by &quot;a lot of server environments,&quot; you mean \nJava ;)\nI haven&#39;t worked with ASP for a while; does it have the same problem? It \ncertainly seems to encourage people to lump all of their code in one \nresource, resulting in abominations like\n\n   \nhttp://www.example.com/scripts/thingy.asp?page=/templates/marketing/fluff.\nhtml\n\nIt would be interesting to do a survey of this (including Cold Fusion, \nPHP, etc.); I&#39;ve done surveys [2] of content generation engines in the \npast, but my focus has been more on HTTP compliance rather than URI \ncapabilities. This could probably be done by looking at documentation, \nrather than active testing.\n\n\n&gt; Another problem was the expectations and attitudes of\n&gt; the programmer community - putting everything into query terms is very\n&gt; popular, because generating URIs is the standard way of doing things - \n&gt; but\n&gt; hopefully this forum will help that issue.\n\nThere&#39;s definitely been an interest in REST since the wars on www-tag et \nal started; I just wish they weren&#39;t quite so negative. However, if it \ndoes the trick...\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n1. http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/01/UriOpacityInvestigation/\n2. http://www.mnot.net/papers/capabilities.html\n\n--\nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
