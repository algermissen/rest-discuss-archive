It was not rude, nor was it meant as a flame, nor \nwas it ill-considered -- those are &quot;typical&quot; behaviors I abhor as well.\n\nHad I thought your question stupid, I would not have said that it was an \ninteresting point, nor would I have engaged in further discussion about it.  \nNor did I chastise you for asking that question on this list.\n\nWhat I did was point out the essential fact, which is that you were asking \nabout an issue which was not architectural in nature, and as such is not \ncovered by REST.\n\nIt helps to learn what REST is by learning what REST is not, IMHO, so what \nhonest response could I give without pointing out that your question fell \nunder what REST is not?\n\nYou&#39;ve read some hostility into my response, where none existed.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
