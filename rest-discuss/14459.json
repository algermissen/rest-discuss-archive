However a transaction is =\r\na transaction, and either it is complete or it is not complete and is rolle=\r\nd back (or undone). If you want to model two transactions, that&#39;s fine, but=\r\n don&#39;t call one &quot;provisional&quot; when it has the exact same semantics as the &quot;=\r\nreal&quot; transaction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That is an inaccurate representatiton of the prov=\r\nisional-final\n&gt; pattern, leaving off the &quot;final&quot; part (the 2nd phase).\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nHere&#39;s one fairly early version.
