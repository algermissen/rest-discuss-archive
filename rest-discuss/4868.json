I ran into some trouble extracting the &quot;resources&quot; and \n&quot;representations&quot; from the requirements. Maybe you could give me some \nadvice?\n\nThe service should work like this:\nA user can upload a picture using PUT, add metadata (eg, GPS data) using \nPOST, DELETE the picture and attached metadata and GET a list of \npictures, the picture and the metadata.\n\nSo, my question is: Which resources would you identify? It may sound \ntrivial, but I&#39;ve some trouble with it.\n\nResources I would identify:\n  - Picture (/image/xyz)\n  - Picture-Metadata (/metadata/xyz)\n  - Picture-Collection (/index)\n\nRepresentations:\n  - Picture: binary\n  - Picture-Metadata: XML/RDF\n  - Picture-Collection: XML/RDF\n\nSince Picture and Picture-Metadata are closely connected, I&#39;m tempted to \nsee &quot;Picture&quot; as the resource, and &quot;binary&quot; and &quot;XML/RDF&quot; as two \ndifferent representations. The problem with this approach is that I \ncan&#39;t address representations of a resource, only a resource. What would \nyou suggest?\n\nTIA,\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n"}}
