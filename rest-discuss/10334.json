I believe the WG&#39;s \n&gt; current proposal puts REST designs at a significant \n&gt; disadvantage. The Working Group will be taking up this issue \n&gt; in its weekly teleconference this Wednesday and I hope \n&gt; feedback from the members of this mailing list might help \n&gt; communicate the importance of this issue for web developers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently, the Same Origin Policy limits the ways in which a \n&gt; web page served by one site, Site A, can communicate with \n&gt; resources hosted on a separate site, Site B. The WG aims to \n&gt; provide a way for Site B and the browser to agree on a \n&gt; loosening of these restrictions. For example, given the \n&gt; consent of Site B, the browser would allow a page from Site A \n&gt; to receive the response to a GET request on a resource hosted \n&gt; by Site B. Similarly, the page from Site A would be allowed \n&gt; to send an arbitrary POST to a resource hosted by Site B and \n&gt; receive the response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially, the WG&#39;s current proposal is for the server to \n&gt; express a cross-domain request policy (XDRP) for each hosted \n&gt; resource. Before sending a cross-domain, non-GET request to a \n&gt; particular resource, the web browser must query that \n&gt; resource&#39;s XDRP and enforce any expressed constraints. For \n&gt; more detail, please refer to the the WG&#39;s current draft \n&gt; proposal &lt;http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the problems with this design is that there is a \n&gt; mandatory network round-trip to fetch the XDRP for a resource \n&gt; before the browser can begin communicating with that \n&gt; resource. Essentially, there&#39;s a one network round-trip \n&gt; penalty for each distinct URI a web application uses. For \n&gt; example, consider the effect of this design on a mashup that \n&gt; uses the ATOM protocol to communicate with another site. When \n&gt; creating a new member resource, the server sends the client a \n&gt; distinct URI identifying the resource. In essence, the server \n&gt; is saying: &quot;Send your updates here&quot;. But before sending a PUT \n&gt; request to the specified URL, the mashup application must \n&gt; first send a request for the XDRP, in effect asking \n&gt; permission to use the resource it was just told to use.\n&gt; The same happens for each distinct URL the client uses. The \n&gt; result is a tragically comical network protocol in which the \n&gt; client repeatedly asks permission to do what the server just \n&gt; told the client it could do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve pointed out this problem to the WG and the response from \n&gt; one of the main contributors to the specification was:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian Hickson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I do not believe that we should change the API to optimise \n&gt; for the one \n&gt; &gt; case of an API that involves a lot of non-GET requests to unique \n&gt; &gt; resources. It is trivial to optimise the server&#39;s protocol in this \n&gt; &gt; case anyway (just use one URI and put the parameters in the \n&gt; body), and \n&gt; &gt; this more closely matches what most people will be doing anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; See: \n&gt; &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Jan\n&gt; /0297.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Members of this mailing list may see a similarity between \n&gt; this proposed design advice and the long-ago discussions \n&gt; about the design of SOAP where requests are all sent to a \n&gt; single URL and the actual target resource is identified by \n&gt; arguments in the message body.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also pointed out that this design advice discourages use of \n&gt; URIs, whereas webarch encourages use of URIs. The reply was *only*:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian Hickson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I disagree with much of Web Arch.\n&gt; \n&gt; See: \n&gt; &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Jan\n&gt; /0299.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Going forward, it seems likely that an important measure of \n&gt; the design quality of a web application will be how well it \n&gt; works in a mashup.\n&gt; Many designs that a REST proponent may favour involve heavy \n&gt; use of URIs. Under the WG&#39;s current proposal, these designs \n&gt; will be penalized with a network round-trip for each distinct \n&gt; URI. The proposal&#39;s main designer dismisses this design \n&gt; style. The WG&#39;s editor sees this issue as only a &quot;quibble&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt; See: \n&gt; &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Jan\n&gt; /0306.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Nottingham and I have proposed an alternate design for \n&gt; cross-domain requests that does not have these performance \n&gt; problems and negative design pressures. Essentially, the \n&gt; alternate proposal asks the host, instead of each resource, \n&gt; if it is willing to accept cross-domain requests. If so, \n&gt; these requests are then so labeled, in the same way as the WG \n&gt; currently proposes. The task of enforcing a per-resource \n&gt; policy is then managed solely by the host. Under such a \n&gt; design, there is one network round-trip before requests begin \n&gt; to flow, but it is one round-trip per host, not per resource. \n&gt; This way there is no penalty for heavy use of URIs. To date, \n&gt; the WG has rejected pursuing such a design.\n&gt; \n&gt; This design discussion is also taking place under the time \n&gt; pressure of the Firefox 3 release, which plans to implement \n&gt; the WG&#39;s current proposal. Should this release happen, this \n&gt; topic may be a done deal.\n&gt; Jonas Sicking seems to be the Mozilla representative \n&gt; participating on this WG.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion, the WG&#39;s current proposal would have a \n&gt; negative impact on the viability of REST design on the Web. I \n&gt; think members of this mailing list should consider these \n&gt; issues and make their voices heard on the WG&#39;s mailing list \n&gt; for public feedback. Before posting to this list, you must \n&gt; first subscribe by sending an email to:\n&gt; \n&gt; mailto:public-appformats-request@...?subject=subscribe\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully, significant feedback from this community will \n&gt; positively influence the discussion of these issues in \n&gt; Wednesday&#39;s telecon.\n\nWOW.  Having spent some time on the HTMLWG and dealing with Ian&#39;s and Anne&#39;s\ndismissive attitudes and authoritarian approaches, all I can say is &quot;Same\nshit, different day.&quot;\n\nI hope others on this list agree with Tyler and subscribe to the appformats\nlist and let your voices be heard.\n\n--\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
