I wouldn&#39;t say it was hard exactly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are only 2 hard things in computer science: cache entry\n&gt;&gt; invalidation and naming things.\n&gt;\n&gt;Plus, resource-space decomposition is largely an exercise in naming\n&gt;and classification.\n&gt;\n\nActually, I name my resources first, then design the resource space in \nterms of &quot;how the website looks&quot;.  I start with an identifier which may \nnot be dereferenced (because I say it&#39;s only an identifier):\n\n[1] http://example.org/2007-05-30.1\n\nI define this to mean the first resource created by the application on \nthe given date.  I can abstract this into a website in more than one \nway, though.  First, by extrapolating the identifier into a human-\nfriendly hierarchical resource space with hackable Cool URIs mixing \nnames and numbers like so:\n\n[2] http://example.org/2007/may/30/1\n\nOf course, I could also base my resource space on the content of the \nresource instead of the name of the resource.  If &quot;2007-05-30.1&quot; is \ndescribed by a representation in the Atom format containing hypertext \nmarkup which implements a &lt;category&gt; scheme for the site/service \n(whatever), then the contents of category tags found within those \nrepresentations might constitute the resource space:\n\n[3] http://example.org/foo\n\nA representation of /foo may describe several named resources included \nby the server, so the names of the resources themselves may not be \nexposed.  Or, they could be extrapolated out into webspace like this:\n\n[4] http://example.org/foo/2007-05-30.1\n\nOf course, I could use any or all of [1] - [4] at any given point in \ntime, or change abruptly from [4] to [2] without ever needing to re-\nname my resources.  In my case I would use [1] as my Atom ID and store \nthe hypermedia in an Atom Store.  This imposes no restriction on the \ndesign of the resource space intended to be dereferenced from the Web, \nnor does it impose any restriction on the media type chosen for any \nor all of [2] - [4], and of course I could always devise a [5]:\n\n[5] waka://example.org/2012/may/30/1\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
