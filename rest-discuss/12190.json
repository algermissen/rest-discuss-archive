It seem=\r\ns fraught with all the\n&gt; same contract versioning issues as WSDL, DCOM, etc=\r\n. Knowledge and\n&gt; meaning are continually evolving products of the dynamic =\r\nsocial context\n&gt; within which they exist, and that fact surely needs to be =\r\naddressed in\n&gt; any workable content binding approach...\n&gt;\n&gt; In REST terms, =\r\nconcepts can obviously be modelled as URI-addressable\n&gt; resources and publi=\r\nshed in different representation formats. For\n&gt; example, the location conce=\r\npt &quot;London, UK&quot; can be modelled as a resource\n&gt; with the address http://dbp=\r\nedia. org/resource/ London and then published\n&gt; in representation formats i=\r\nncluding RDF, N3, KML, GeoRSS, etc. However I\n&gt; am unsure how the self-desc=\r\nribing message and HATEOS constraints\n&gt; translate in this context? The best=\r\n I can come up with is that the\n&gt; DBpedia, Freebase, OpenCyc ontologies sho=\r\nuld be viewed as the knowledge\n&gt; representation equivalents of standard MIM=\r\nE types (or metamedia types?),\n&gt; and that hypermedia should be used for run=\r\ntime binding to the immediate\n&gt; sibling nodes of a concept within those sta=\r\nndard ontologies (thereby\n&gt; avoiding the versioned contract binding nightma=\r\nre). Any approach like\n&gt; that would make me feel a lot more comfortable tha=\r\nt just tagging stuff\n&gt; with DBpedia URIs, which seems to violate a whole ra=\r\nft of basic\n&gt; architectural principles e.g. encapsulation and separate of\n&gt;=\r\n interface/implement ation.\n&gt;\n&gt; To my (clearly limited) mind, these seem li=\r\nke really important questions\n&gt; and I don&#39;t think they are receiving enough=\r\n consideration in linked\n&gt; data/semantic web circles at present?\n&gt;\n&gt; regard=\r\ns\n&gt;\n&gt; Julian\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@ yahoogrou=\r\nps. com [mailto:rest- discuss@ yahoogroups. com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Simon Reinh=\r\nardt\n&gt; Sent: 03 March 2009 15:58\n&gt; Cc: Rest List\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discu=\r\nss] This is REST\n&gt;\n&gt; Solomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Craig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;rel=\r\n&quot; seems like a good start and I think\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; building on that idea can l=\r\nead to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; compliant\n&gt;&gt; RESTful application.

Subject: [rest-discuss] Linked Data=\r\n and REST architectural style (was: This&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is REST)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The rel=\r\nevance of the REST architectural style to Linked Data and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; OWL/SKOS/et=\r\nc has been nagging away in the back of my mind for the last&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; few month=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The idea of defining (and even considering the maintenance o=\r\nverhead of)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; an OWL snapshot of a knowledge domain and binding to it v=\r\nia restricted&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vocabulary metadata fills me with fear. It seems fraugh=\r\nt with all the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; same contract versioning issues as WSDL, DCOM, etc. Kn=\r\nowledge and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; meaning are continually evolving products of the dynamic =\r\nsocial context&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; within which they exist, and that fact surely needs to=\r\n be addressed in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; any workable content binding approach...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n In REST terms, concepts can obviously be modelled as URI-addressable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n resources and published in different representation formats. For&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exa=\r\nmple, the location concept &quot;London, UK&quot; can be modelled as a resource&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n with the address &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://dbpe=\r\ndia.&quot;&gt;http://dbpedia.&lt;/a&gt; org/resource/ London and then published&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in =\r\nrepresentation formats including RDF, N3, KML, GeoRSS, etc. However I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n am unsure how the self-describing message and HATEOS constraints&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tra=\r\nnslate in this context? The best I can come up with is that the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DBped=\r\nia, Freebase, OpenCyc ontologies should be viewed as the knowledge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; re=\r\npresentation equivalents of standard MIME types (or metamedia types?),&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; and that hypermedia should be used for runtime binding to the immediate&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; sibling nodes of a concept within those standard ontologies (thereby&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; avoiding the versioned contract binding nightmare). Any approach like&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; that would make me feel a lot more comfortable that just tagging stuf=\r\nf&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with DBpedia URIs, which seems to violate a whole raft of basic&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; architectural principles e.g. encapsulation and separate of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; interf=\r\nace/implement ation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To my (clearly limited) mind, these seem l=\r\nike really important questions&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and I don&#39;t think they are receiving e=\r\nnough consideration in linked&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; data/semantic web circles at present?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Julian&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----=\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@ yahoogroups. com [mailto:rest- discuss@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Behalf Of Simon Reinhardt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: 03 March 2009 15:=\r\n58&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cc: Rest List&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] This is REST&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Solomon Duskis wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Craig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;rel&quot; seems li=\r\nke a good start and I think&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; building on that idea can lea=\r\nd to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; compliant&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RESTful application. I thin=\r\nk it may be a problem that may be solved&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; with an &quot;As Simple As Possi=\r\nble,&quot; well known media-type plus a guide on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; how to develop &quot;re=\r\nl&quot; dictionaries.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is basically what RDF provides: a common =\r\ndata model (and a bunch of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; defined formats for it) and a simple, dist=\r\nributed way for defining your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;rel&quot; values, encouraging you to re-use=\r\n the ones defined by others so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that a Web service client needs less b=\r\nuilt-in knowledge about your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; service.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And Linked Data [1] is al=\r\nl about taking one entry point and traversing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the data Web from there=\r\n dynamically by following the links provided&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (choosing those which ha=\r\nve a &quot;rel&quot; type that matches your intentions).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Linked Data is mainly =\r\nabout linking up open data of course but its&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; principles can easily be=\r\n applied to closed applications which, I think,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; would benefit from th=\r\nat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Just one way of doing it, but I more and more think that the idea=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; behind Linked Data and REST overlap largely. :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regard=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Simon&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [1] &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://linkeddata.&quot;&gt;http://linkeddata.&lt;/a&gt; org/&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- ------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
