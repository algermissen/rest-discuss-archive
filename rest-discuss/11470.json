How can such a test harness assess\n&gt; HATEOAS without knowledge of the media-type exchanged? Without\n&gt; knowledge of HATEOAS, the test harness is unable to traverse the links\n&gt; between steady states.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some problems come to mind. In order to assess REST-over-HTTP,\n&gt; resource state changes must be made. In many, perhaps most, test\n&gt; subjects this will be either impossible (due to access control\n&gt; restrictions) or undesirable (filling a site with dummy data). The\n&gt; Code-on-Demand constraint further complicates the testability of\n&gt; subjects, as it reduces visibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Given the necessity to have knowledge of many media-types, I suspect\n&gt; this would not be a trivial development. Good idea though (my\n&gt; http-headers-status diagram grew out of just such a test suite,\n&gt; although that was very application-specific).\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan\n\nI recommend you use the test client closest to the app you will be\nusing: web browser for webapps, something based on java.net or\nHttpClient if you are using either java library, etc. I also quite\nlike HttpUnit and more recently HtmlUnit for functional web site\ntesting, because the latter handles javascript too.\n\nSome quick thoughts\n* Good failure reporting. Rather than the usual xUnit assert failure,\nthe fault reports should include the request and response\n* Testing a test harness is itself very hard. You need to make sure it\nhandles all forms of failure well, and reports meaningful messages in\nevery situation. Diagnostics can always be improved on.\n* Consider a proxy that can be controlled by the test harness to\nintroduce new failures, failures such as\n  - far end has an unsupported/wrong HTTPS certificate\n  - incomplete response\n  - timeouts\n  - stripping out of some headers (what does the client do if\ncontent-length isn&#39;t there)\n  - thin, unreliable network connections.\n  - simulate a proxy that rejects some verbs\n  The proxy could also log all messages so be used for diagnostics.\nBits of this are implemented in Axis Tcpmon, but it doesn&#39;t have the\nfull programmatic API that I&#39;d like.\n\nWith a test proxy you could run an out the box web browser under\nselenium, or your test app, but route it through a wide (but sadly\nstill incomplete) set of network/back end failures.\n\n"}}
