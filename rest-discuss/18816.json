If we consider the following\n&gt; &gt; two examples:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Example 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.example.com/orde=\r\nr&#39;\n&gt; &gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something &#39;order&#39;=\r\n-like at\n&gt; &gt; the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent=\r\n) to follow\n&gt; &gt; this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the re=\r\npresentation of\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as rendered in a specific media=\r\n-type).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Example 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.example=\r\n.com/new&#39; to\n&gt; &gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item=\r\n of the type\n&gt; &gt; communicated by it&#39;s current context. This is the problem,=\r\n I don&#39;t need to\n&gt; &gt; &#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific=\r\n URI, because the\n&gt; &gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the=\r\n resource. What I need\n&gt; &gt; to do is examine the permitted methods (either b=\r\ny inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39;\n&gt; &gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try =\r\nto convey the permutations of\n&gt; &gt; method in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that ma=\r\nke sense?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Paul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discus=\r\ns@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;wmartinez@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi nikonguy74!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Lin=\r\nks represent resources you can work with. The idea of links is that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yo=\r\nu can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actual\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What is this link referring to? What\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attrib=\r\nute to add more information about a link. I denotes a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; value, keyword, =\r\nhint of what relation the link has with the current\n&gt; &gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say =\r\nyou are in a book page, that is your current resources\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and it has a UR=\r\nI. A link with rel=3D&quot;next&quot; will hint that following that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; link will ge=\r\nt you to the next page of the book.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. It is important to underst=\r\nand that the rel is the relation the resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt; identified by the link&#39;s=\r\n URI, has with the actual resource/uri/document.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not good if you=\r\n use rel to denote other information, like saying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPos=\r\nt&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI with a POST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to create somet=\r\nhing. That is not the intended use and it is a bad\n&gt; &gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you the links poin=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start ask=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using PO=\r\nST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction =\r\nis\n&gt; &gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be sta=\r\ntically\n&gt; &gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. So, yo=\r\nu have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media\n&gt; &gt;&gt; types,=\r\n the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; P=\r\nlus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n may mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; that info you can program intelligent clients.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 6. Finally, som=\r\ne other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor and image are special links\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that have =\r\na standard meaning and established processing. If you found an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; t=\r\nag you automatically know that link is referring to an image, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; if y=\r\nou are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthat image with a GET and display it based on context and additional\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\nttributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you hav=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it clear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attr=\r\nibute\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will tell you everything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; William Mar=\r\ntinez.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.alger=\r\nmissen@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, niko=\r\nnguy74 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was=\r\n on rel link.
