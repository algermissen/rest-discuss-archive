It doesn&#39;t say that a\n&gt; bookselling application shouldn&#39;t model and expose those abstractions through the\n&gt; URI space.  Indeed, doing so is a RESTful thing, isn&#39;t it?   \n\nAgree. \n\n&gt; ... It also doesn&#39;t say\n&gt; that a set of book-oriented applications from various developers should not or\n&gt; could not agree on a conventional method of modeling books, collections of books,\n&gt; etc. as resources.\n\nThey can agree on the modelling, if it makes them feel good. But they\nshould not standardize it in software. If they want to be able to go\n(let&#39;s say) from a book&#39;s page to it&#39;s author&#39;s page, software should\nnot blindly add /author. Rather it should look for an\n&lt;author&gt;...&lt;/author&gt; XML tag. That allows the person maintaining the\nsite to move author elements to a totally different site if they decide\nthat is better. They update all of their &lt;author&gt;...&lt;/author&gt; tags and\nthey are done.\n\nConsider if the original web had said that after you are done with a\nform it is automatically POSTed to the original URI + /process_form. It\nwould have seemed fine at the time but then later when people wanted  to\nmake little form fields that search Google, they wouldn&#39;t have been able\nto.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
