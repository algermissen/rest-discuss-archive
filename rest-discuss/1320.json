Could\nyou provide one or two or six URLs with a concrete description of the\nOffer-Acceptance for Purchase Orders and similar problems? I&#39;ve got\ndistracted by other things as you discussed them with Mike Dierken and\ndidn&#39;t realize that you never came up with solutions you considered\ncomplete. If you can give me the URLs we&#39;ll all be at the same place\nagain (reset our state based on hypertext) and I&#39;ll add my thoughts.\n\nOne thing I remember is that some people were using &quot;transaction&quot; in the\nsense of transactional integrity and some people were using it merely to\nmean a &quot;Communication involving two or more people that affects all\nthose involved; personal interaction&quot;/&quot;The doing or performing of any\nbusiness; management of any affair; performance.&quot;\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=transaction&r=67\n\nWe had this same terminological problem during the REST/SOAP panel.\nLucas used transaction in the latter sense and Rohit thought he meant in\nthe database sense.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
