It is currently the &quot;paste after&quot; operation, as\n&gt; compared to PUT&#39;s &quot;paste over&quot;. The changed definition just means\n&gt; &quot;tunnel arbitrary stuff&quot;. As such, this changed definition of POST\n&gt; introduces non-self-descriptive messages into the core HTTP.\n\nHmm, I don&#39;t see it that way.\n\nPOST(p) isn&#39;t tunneling, and its use is fully self-descriptive AFAICT.\n It&#39;s operational semantics are just that the client has no visibility\ninto what the server might do with the provided representation (other\nthan &quot;process it&quot;). Tunneling - let&#39;s call it POST(t) - isn&#39;t\nself-descriptive because the effective operation isn&#39;t POST, it&#39;s\ngetStockQuote or whatever.\n\n&gt; In practice POST is usually used in this way. As such, the errata itself\n&gt; makes a fair degree of sense. However, I see it as a step backwards as\n&gt; far as REST is concerned.\n\nPOST(p) is still uniform.  If you want POST(a), you&#39;ll need a new\nmethod name ... or a new protocol - perhaps Waka will have a POST(a)\nequivalent?\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
