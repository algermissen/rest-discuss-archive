The state of the client is \n&gt; dependant upon the server, the state of the server is independent. It&#39;s \n&gt; not in any grey place, it&#39;s REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter how much prior knowledge is needed to work out what is done \n&gt; with the above to build the URI, it remains the representation that is \n&gt; controlling how it is built up. The markup is therefore hypertext (or \n&gt; hypermedia at last), hypertext is therefore the engine of application \n&gt; state, therefore we have that REST constraint met.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;youKnowWhatToDo&quot; isn&#39;t hypermedia but \n&gt; &quot;youKnowWhatToDo|http://example/goHere|some&quot; could be.\n\nI&#39;m not arguing against prior knowledge (see recent posts re \nself-description). I&#39;m suggesting that a sorites paradox which denies a \ndifference between URIs and EPRs* with forms somewhere in the middle of \nthe heap, on the one hand, combined with the notion that URI opacity is \nnon-contingent to the web architecture on the other, doesn&#39;t make sense. \nAnd we haven&#39;t talked about library lookup yet.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n* That EPR also stands for a paradox is quite cool.\n\n"}}
