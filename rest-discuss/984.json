The &quot;axiom&quot; of URI opacity is --- for\nbetter or worse --- a part of the REST &quot;doctrine.&quot;  This list is --- I\nthought --- for discussing REST.  Punting anything that questions any given\npart of the &quot;official&quot; REST dogma over somewhere else smacks of doctrinal\npurification, in some sense changing this list from a true, open discussion\nforum into an indoctrination forum.\n\nHaving said that, I do agree that the back-and-forth with me and Paul mostly\nceased to be useful or interesting some dozens of messages back.  I&#39;ll kill\nthat thread, and simply provide pointers to pages on the Wiki which are\nappropriately indicated as being &quot;heretical.&quot;\n\n:-/\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
