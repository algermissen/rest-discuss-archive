My question is:\nwhat&#39;s your RESTful login resource look like?\n\n  --pj\n\nOn Wednesday, Mar 24, 2004, &quot;mgvelvet&quot; writes:\n&gt;I have a business requirement to secure certain data within a \n&gt;resource. For example, in a personnel record, I must not return the \n&gt;salary amount unless the user is in an accounting or HR role. \n&gt;Another example: any collection of customers must return only the \n&gt;subset the user is authorized to see.\n&gt;\n&gt;I can vary the content based on who has authenticated, but I have an \n&gt;uneasy feeling that isn&#39;t RESTful. On the other hand, different URIs \n&gt;for each user seems to fragment the information space.\n&gt;\n&gt;Has anyone addressed a similar requirement? What are your thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt;  --m\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
