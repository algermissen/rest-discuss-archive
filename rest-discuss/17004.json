If there is no suitable format for the use case, then you \nmay have to create &gt;a new format. But you&#39;d likely want to get input and \nagreement from potential &gt;implementors and experts in the domain you are \ntargeting so that the format gets adopted &gt;and onto the target machines. \nYou also want to make sure that the spec can easily be &gt;found and when \nmachines communicate using the format, that it can be easily identified \n&gt;with a media type. That&#39;s why you standardize your format and register a\n media type for &gt;it.\n\nFunny, I just replied a second ago to Jurgen about this... since application/xml and application/json have no meaning, then what do I use to return my custom domain specific format of information? While one day it would be great for millions of users to make use of my service, I doubt outside of those using our service that our format would ever be adopted for anything else, thus, it doesn&#39;t seem like a new media type would be of any use.\n\nSo if I use application/xml, my API would not be considered truly RESTful? \n\n\n&gt;Now if you&#39;re saying: &quot;Hold on! Millions of machines? Different \norganizations? I just need &gt;to be able to talk to the server that Bob, \nwho sits 2 cubes over, is building&quot; then maybe &gt;REST isn&#39;t what you need.\n That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use many if not most of its &gt;principles and \nleave others out. Just be careful about calling it REST (well at least \non this &gt;list ;-).\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nI find that Java + Jersey is so easy, I use it for all my needs. I&#39;ve replaced my old MVC framework with it, in favor of allowing a HTTP based API as well as my site to use the API to build up a UI. Not that my test site for my own learning purposes will ever garner any more attention than just myself, but I like how easy it is to develop with.\n\nI am learning that many people on this list and others indicate that most APIs out there that say they are Rest based are really Http Api based, nothing more than a glorified RPC over HTTP. Fair enough I guess, but for my own stuff, I am not worried about it being 100% Rest compliant. However, and the reason I am asking all these questions is I do want to understand how a true rest implementation would be done, just in case I ever get lucky enough to be part of something (again) that may have an impact greater than my garage server. ;)\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-511561170-1291262102=:76023\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;Probably (b).
