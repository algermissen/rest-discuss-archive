Not all XML DB&#39;s are created equal.  \nWe are using BDBXML, where an embedded DB is called for, and eXist \nelsewhere.  But, these two applications have completely different \napproaches to the same concept -- storing XML natively.  If we were to \ntry using BDBXML where we are now using eXist, and vice-versa, we&#39;d be \nin a world of sh*t.  However, we could outright replace BDBXML with \nMarkLogic if we had to, as they take the same approach.  There is no \n&quot;best XML DB,&quot; only the XML DB that&#39;s best for your situation.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
