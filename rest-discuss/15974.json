To make a bit of=\r\n a devils advocate argument for it I&#39;ll say the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; The point of=\r\n code-on-demand is to allow the capabilities of the UA to be extended. Exte=\r\nnding it to understand a data format seems like quite a reasonable thing to=\r\n do. Using a base serialization format such as XML or JSON for your data fo=\r\nrmat (as well as the appropriate mime-type) does provide a reasonable amoun=\r\nt of visibility as well. There is also a certain amount of native support i=\r\nn the UA for these serialization formats as well. Javascript code that unde=\r\nrstand the schema and semantics of your XML/JSON is not significantly unlik=\r\ne a script that understand constraints that you&#39;ve put on your HTML, for ex=\r\nample, code that knows that some &lt;span&gt; elements will have a specific @clas=\r\ns value that will imply that certain behavior should occur when the element=\r\n is clicked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Where&#39;s the violation of REST&#39;s constraints? I would say y=\r\nou&#39;ve gone too far only when you are using code-on-demand to implement some=\r\nthing that the UA already does natively (with little or no gain in non-func=\r\ntional areas such as visible latencies or perhaps portability).
