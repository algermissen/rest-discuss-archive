I had to finish the job, so I redesigned to use POST.\n\n&gt;  - rest-discuss wondering why Lucas would encode the data to be PUT (you can\n&gt; send pure binary if you like)\n\nLucas wrong.\n\n&gt;  - rest-discuss members relate no problem receiving PUT with other\n&gt; environments (servlets, etc)\n\nTrue, with the caveat that the Atom group documented some common\nsituations where PUT is broken by default.\n\n&gt; Lucas - What are you using to host WebJay? Maybe someone has a similar\n&gt; environment & can make a suggestion.\n\nNo need, Mike.  I really didn&#39;t mean to be asking for debugging help.  But\nthanks.\n\n...\n\nMy own conclusions --\n\nAs Roy said, it&#39;s reasonable for ISPs to limit attack vectors like PUT.\nAt the same time, developers doing RESTful designs need to use the full\npowers of HTTP -- any of the designs we arrive at here should be fair game\neven without write permissions on httpd.conf.\n\nOne general fix is to find or create hosts configured specifically for\nRESTful web services.  Another, more appealing to app developers who need\nto use an existing account, is to create software that you can drop in\nplace.\n\nAn example of how servers would be specially configured is that PUT could\nbe enabled by default, with no restrictions, as long as features which\nturn it into an attack vector were disabled.  Features that turn it into\nan attack vector include mod_put and the PEAR Upload.php script.  These\nturn it into an attack vector by using it as a method for uploading files,\nwhich obviously entails a lot of danger.  There is nothing intrinsically\nmore dangerous about PUT than about POST; it is using PUT as a synonym for\nuploading that creates the danger.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Lucas Gonze&quot; &lt;lgonze@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &lt;lucas@...&gt;; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 28, 2004 1:47 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] PUT considered fancy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, 28 May 2004, Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, we&#39;re good.  I think the take-away point is this; it&#39;s useful to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both have an architectural guide and a grasp of the practical issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; involved in following such a guide, when designing Web apps (or anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; else, for that matter).  While most discussions on rest-discuss focus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the guide, that doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t understand, appreciate, or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even discuss on occasion, the practical side of things.
