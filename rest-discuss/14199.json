You mentioned categories which is another means, but it may be a  \n&gt; red herring in the M2M example.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, when you say GET /orders, you&#39;re implying an accept header of  \n&gt; */*.

That&#39;s just the\n&gt; fact of it. APIs are contacts. Change the contract, bad things happen.\n&gt; Design APIs with growth and flexibility in mind, and you can have a\n&gt; more forgiving client/server experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. I just think that we are making a mistake when we claim that  \n&gt; REST magically makes M2M interaction have the same amount of loose  \n&gt; coupling than human to machine interactions. Much of the reluctance  \n&gt; against REST in an enterprise context IMO results from the actually  \n&gt; existing contract in M2M scenarios notoriously being talked away.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you tell Joe developer to evolve that service, you better be able  \n&gt; to tell him what exactly he can do and what not. He should not have  \n&gt; to call the client owners because not having to bring the client and  \n&gt; server owners together when evolving is one of *the* top advantages  \n&gt; of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; By using media types and HATEOAS, the clients retain a bit of\n&gt; discoverability. It&#39;s not so much discoverability, as it is state\n&gt; awareness. It can &quot;know&quot; where it is at any point of the process, and\n&gt; it &quot;knows&quot; where to go from there. If it follows the links given with\n&gt; the types specified, the client will be told where to go next.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, that is true. But it also conflicts with the state machine that  \n&gt; the client itself has. It is not entirely driven by the service (as  \n&gt; the human user is). It at least makes use of a set of partially  \n&gt; ordered goals (e.g. you must order before you cancel an order, you  \n&gt; must order before you pay, etc.).\n&gt;\n&gt; This set of partially ordered goals is in a way exactly what e.g.  \n&gt; AtomPub establishes. The goal order is specified by saying what  \n&gt; outgoing transitions (== next available goals) to expect after  \n&gt; completing a certain goal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is key. The client isn&#39;t &quot;waiting to do the next thing&quot;. It&#39;s not\n&gt; got a &quot;list of things to do&quot;, and going through them one by one.\n&gt; Rather it has a list of guideposts that it&#39;s told to follow, and the\n&gt; actual PATH it takes isn&#39;t known to the client until it reaches a goal\n&gt; post.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah - good line of thought. OTH, I have not managed to code a  \n&gt; client that does not eventually have its own state machine that  \n&gt; inevitably drives the clients program flow. No matter how much you  \n&gt; make the client to be driven by the server.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now you can code all of that in to the client, it &quot;knows&quot; where to go,\n&gt; it build URLs, and when things change, the client breaks. Because the\n&gt; client is a stupid client and while it functioned, it did it all the\n&gt; wrong way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose you code a client to an AtomPub server that has a collection  \n&gt; of orders and you want the client to calculate the average order  \n&gt; amount. Can you show me how you do that without expecting the GET on  \n&gt; the order collection to return an Atom feed (or any other  \n&gt; *previously* known media type)?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /service-doc\n&gt;\n&gt; ... pick order collection based on category ...\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /orders\n&gt;\n&gt; And now - how do you code from here without relying on the fact that  \n&gt; AtomPub tells you that collections come as Atom feeds?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So, that&#39;s, to me, where some of the robustness of the whole thing\n&gt; comes from, even in a M2M world.\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------------\n&gt; Jan Algermissen\n&gt;\n&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; Blog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\n&gt; Home: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n&gt; --------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
