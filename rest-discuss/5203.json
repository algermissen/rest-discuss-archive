The ideas which are common currency here have not been \naccepted by implementors.  I know this because implementing them \nfrequently led me to bits of technology that were blatantly broken from \na RESTful perspective, yet the bugs were not known.\n\nFor example, PUT handling in PHP is treated as a synonym for file \nuploading.  The RESTful idea that PUT is only different from POST in \nterms of what it implies about state just didn&#39;t exist once I wandered \nfrom these environs over to #php. \n\nSimilarly, using a broad range of response status codes meant that many \nuser agents overwrote my error messages, so that I couldn&#39;t have an \ninterface which was both user friendly and RESTful.  I&#39;m not just \ntalking about browsers, either -- lwp-request makes the same mistake.\n\nAnother problem was that there was no prior art to glean design patterns \nfrom.  For example, there was no programmer-level documentation on the \n&#39;hypermedia as engine of application state&#39; constraint until Joe \nGregorio&#39;s &quot;Contructing or Traversing URIs?&quot;[1] column on xml.com.  That \nwas a great start, but it&#39;s only a start. \n\nI hope these comments won&#39;t be interpreted as a bitter rant.  These are \njust my notes from the field.\n\n- Lucas\n\n[1] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/04/06/restful.html.\n\n\n"}}
