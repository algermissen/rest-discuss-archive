Are you saying that the server could return *any=\r\nthing*, like for instance the representation of a car or an address book? O=\r\nr are you allowing the client to assume it is a sales order - without any a=\r\nssumption of the actual format it is represented in?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ha, Jorn! You are=\r\n right on.\n\n\nSo, I would say, it is fair to argue that:\n\n1) The client foll=\r\nows a link-rel &quot;this-is-the-sales-order&quot; and assumes it will get, well, a s=\r\nales order - in some yet unknown format.\n\n2) The client does not need to sp=\r\necify &quot;I want a sales order&quot; in the accept headers (it does so by the URL i=\r\nt has selected). \n\n3) The client should specify what general domain-indepen=\r\ndent format it expects using accept headers. For instance &quot;Accept: applicat=\r\nion/xml&quot;.\n\n4) The server replies with a sales order formated as application=\r\n/xml.\n\n5) The client looks into the XML and switches on something relevant =\r\nin the XML - for instance the root namespace.\n\n6) Based on the XML decision=\r\n in (5) the client decides how to decode the XML-formated sales order.\n\nAll=\r\n in all there is no need for a domain specific media type like application/=\r\nvnd.salesorder+xml.\n\nCombine this with statements like &quot;REST is software de=\r\nsign on the scale of decades&quot; and &quot;Many of the constraints are directly opp=\r\nosed to short-term efficiency&quot;.\n\nI would say that domain specific media typ=\r\nes are short term solutions - a thing like the sales order varies on the ma=\r\nrket/geographical region/politics and ... time, meaning it probably won&#39;t b=\r\ne stable over the decades.\n\nFurther more - it may feel like bending over an=\r\nd backwards not to use domain specific media types. But, well &quot;Many of the =\r\nconstraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency&quot;, so, yes, it hur=\r\nts now, but you will be a happy camper in ten years :-)\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
