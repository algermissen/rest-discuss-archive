First, the relational calculus per se\ndoesn&#39;t say anything about EXECUTE, and EXECUTE by itself has no impact on\nany data model.  IMO, whether any SQL has EXEC, EXECUTE, etc., its not\nreally accurate to think of it as a part of CRUD.  Instead, it&#39;s really a\nway to tunnel SQL through SQL...\n\nBut more troublesome:  it&#39;s perhaps dangerous to think of POST in this way,\ni.e. to think about it as a way to provide arbitrary data to a resource for\narbitrary purposes.  It&#39;s a slippery slope from there to RPC.  Before\n&quot;getting&quot; REST, I used to argue that we only really needed one protocol with\none method:  INVOKE, or POST, or EXEC, etc.  All other methods, I argued,\ncould and should be implemented by individual objects in terms of that\nsingle primitive method.\n\nAFAICT the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation of POST should really be:  update the\nstate of the resource in question given the following (potentially partial)\nrepresentation of what the new resource state should be.  This is a subtle\ndistinction, but IMO an important one:  POST isn&#39;t an arbitrary method\ndispatch interface, but rather a very specific method itself that consumes a\nrepresentation of the intended resource state and acts accordingly.\n\nAs with many of these issues, though, this is so subtle and slippery that in\npractice I find myself violating it all the time. ;-)  In WebKit, for\ninstance, in our administrative UI for the current product, we&#39;re using its\nmechanism for binding &quot;actions&quot; passed in via POST to methods in particular\nservlet method implementations.  This is the wrong way to do it:  we should\nreally be modeling things differently, but it&#39;s often not clear what the\nright model should be...  And the arguments in favor of doing it the right\nway often come across as rather academic.\n\nTrying to practice what I preach,\n\nJb\n\n\n\n"}}
