However, there&#39;s something\n&gt; slightly bigger at stake here. IMHO, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong about statements like &quot;the semantics\n&gt;&gt; of POST requests vary for different resources&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; The semantics of *what* about POST, exactly?\n\nNo, no - this is about the semantics of *specific requests* that use\nthe POST method. Not about the semantics of POST itself.\n\n&gt; This is where I see a subtle\n&gt; rift in the space-time continuum that threatens to divide RESTafarians\n&gt; everywhere. There&#39;s choices in resources as gateways into larger HATEOS\n&gt; frameworks or as those subtler resources themselves, resources as APIs\n&gt; themselves, and so on, all along the scale of correctness from bad to good;\n&gt; the only semantics that REST cares about is &quot;process this&quot;. Whatever you\n&gt; place on top is your business, and exist in the ontology layer (with vocab\n&gt; names / schemas / RDF(x) / whatever.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again; it is *important* to point out that *REST* has no more semantics on a\n&gt; resource than &quot;process this&quot;. Get this wrong, and you start blaming REST for\n&gt; problems that exists elsewhere.\n\nREST is an architectural style, I guess you mean HTTP. If so, I agree\nwith you and that was basically my point. There are more semantics in\na given request than those that HTTP gives us. HTTP gives us\nnetwork-visible semantics, that is its purpose. The additional\nsemantics in a given request are not network-visible (but,\nimportantly, so what?).\n\n&gt;&gt; The key is that those\n&gt;&gt; varying semantics are _not visible_ on the network and are derived\n&gt;&gt; only from the shared understanding between client and server. That&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; not a violation of REST constraints or the HTTP spec, it&#39;s a small\n&gt;&gt; clarification.\n&gt;\n&gt; You think it is small. Some of us think it is subtle - for sure - but rather\n&gt; important. As soon as you think REST (or your favourite REST implementation,\n&gt; like HTTP) carries semantics outside of the generic methods and the generic\n&gt; response codes, you will blame it for all of your own failings, and you\n&gt; might just miss out on the magic of REST in the process.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, all those semantics you talk about are supposed to be in the\n&gt; content-type of the request and the content negotiation with given\n&gt; resources. This is one area in which cool URIs are misleading.\n\nUnless you have a distinct media type identifier to cover every single\nsemantic in your application (or intent, etc.), then those semantics\nwill not be visible and can only be determined by the client and\nserver (via a contextual, shared understanding about the resource in\nquestion) - whether that shared understanding is buried within the\nsemantics of a media type or a preceding link relation does not change\nthis.\n\nThe actually important consideration (which I have tried to bring up\nseveral times now and had no response on) is whether or not this loss\nin network visibility of intended semantics in the request is actually\na concern. The argument in favour of using new specific types seems to\nimply that making the intent visible on the network is both possible\nand desirable. I don&#39;t think either of those assumptions holds true:\n\n1. network visibility is valuable because it facilitates intermediate\nprocessing (stuff like caching, ESI, etc.)  all of these mechanisms\nare generic and non-specific.\n2. as I argued above; unless you have a specific media type for every\nindividual semantic, there is still ambiguity in the message and you\nwon&#39;t get more &#39;visibility&#39; anyway.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
