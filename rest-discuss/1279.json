Quite frankly, it makes a\n&gt; rational discourse on the subject impossible.\n\nI won&#39;t apologize, because I think that that&#39;s pretty par for the course\non technical mailing lists on the Internet. After all, you aren&#39;t SOAP\nand SOAP isn&#39;t you. Therefore I haven&#39;t insulted you. Nevertheless,\nsince it bothers you I&#39;ll try to be more ecumenical in posts that I\nexpect you to see.\n\nStill, there have been occasions where you have taken my statements of\nfact as rhetoric. For instance, when I say that a Java client generated\nfrom a WSDL+HTTP client can be byte-for-byte the same as one generated\nfrom a WSDL+SOAP client, that&#39;s just a statement of fact. When I say\nthat Google&#39;s service would have become very popular (as long as they\ndocumented it and provided Java client libraries) even if it had been\nbased upon S-expressions or binary or totally proprietary XML, that&#39;s a\nstatement of opinion, but not, in my mind, empty rhetoric.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
