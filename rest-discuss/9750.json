A GET on these\n\nThis can be done with a &lt;link&gt; element in what is returned. Alternatively , \nthe next logical state that you mention can also be returned, like the way \nthe ATOM Pub sends the URI of the newly created blog post when you POST a new \nentry to it.\n\n\n&gt; For example, I could POST a &quot;ship&quot; instruction to &#92;orders&#92;[order_id]\n&gt; as the following:\n&gt; &lt;state&gt;ship&lt;/state&gt;\n&gt; &lt;qty&gt;5&lt;/qty&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, if I want to &quot;cancel&quot; that same order using the same\n&gt; resource (URI), the body of my POST would change to:\n&gt; &lt;state&gt;cancel&lt;/state&gt;\n&gt; &lt;qty&gt;0&lt;/qty&gt;\n\nI think what you are raising here is the problem that you are sending the \nverbs SHIP / CANCEL to the URI through the POST body. Note that this isn&#39;t a \nconstraint in REST , REST doesn&#39;t restrict you to use only the HTTP Verbs. \nThat is a constraint of HTTP, as in the HTTP writers think that these are all \nthe verbs you need for resources on the web. If you think that your \napplication needs more, it is perfectly RESTful to do so .. but don&#39;t use \nHTTP.\n\n&gt; In my opinion, a much cleaner design is to create distinct (sub)\n&gt; resources for each state transition i.e. &#92;orders&#92;[order_id]&#92;shipped\nThis is where you are going wrong. The URI points to resources / state not \nstate transitions. &#92;order&#92;[order_id]&#92;shipped is not a resource, so it is \nwrong to write a URI for it. /order/[order_id]/status is a resource, this \ncould be used.\n\n\n&gt; An interesting result of such design is that it forces a designer to\n&gt; look at a system (and the entities in system) in the context of a\n&gt; state machine.  State machines are powerful!\n\nExactly. So a POST to the /order/order_id/ changes its state from shipped to \ncancelled. What is wrong with this ?\n\n\nAgain, I am a newbie so I might be very wrong! but this is my understanding of \nREST.\n\n\nRegards\ndevdatta\n\n\n"}}
