I&#39;m\nthinking about a primitive operation that supports readers.\n\nOne writer alone could drive hundreds of readers. Just to pick an\nexample: one writer pushes positive integers and many readers check\nfor prime numbers. Not a very useful example on it&#39;s own, but that\nsingle writer could drive many, many readers.\n\nThis thread (and the reliable messaging proposals for REST) have\naddressed many issues (like network failures. Perhaps ordered\nmessaging isn&#39;t covered already.\n\nI don&#39;t know if a single generalized primitive operation is good\nenough to address this issue. This seems like a more variable problem\nthan &quot;many writers&quot;.\n\nOne of the things I&#39;ve been thinging about is how to re-implement the\nEIP patterns in RESTful systems, like Competing Consumers\nhttp://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html\n\nThis seems like a tough problem without another method. I haven&#39;t\nfound a really good example of what to base that on though. Reading\nthe GFS paper I realized that the append operation on GFS files\nsupports many writers, but GFS doesn&#39;t have an operation for many\nreaders.\n\nJohn Heintz\n\nOn 6/13/07, Mike Dierken &lt;dierken@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Outside of MOM I don&#39;t know of any generalized support for many readers.\n&gt;\n&gt; You mean, many readers (of a single resource/message) but only one\n&gt; consumer/processor of that one resource?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nJohn D.
