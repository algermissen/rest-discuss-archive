You mention that they &#39;tend to be applications&#39; ... do you mean flash games and the like?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; No. I don&#39;t mean that. Though that would be another example.\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean applications that don&#39;t conform at all to REST. There are quite a few. Hotmail for example? It&#39;s not very RESTfull is it?\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a lot of examples of non-RESTfull webapps, or at least\n&gt; webapps that are only dimly RESTfull. These examples tend to be apps that are trying to mimick a desktop app.\n&gt;   \nOkay, sure, but let&#39;s distinguish between non-RESTful webapps and those \nwhich &#39;clearly can&#39;t be restful&#39; ... examples of the former set are \nadmittedly abundant, however I&#39;m struggling to find examples of the latter.\n\nPut simply, unless you are truly perverting the use of HTTP (a-la SOAP, \nXML-RPC, etc.), and the WWW, *any* webapp is going to be at least \nsomewhat RESTful. Agreed that they are perhaps only &#39;dimly RESTful but, \nagain, a far cry from an inherent inability to be RESTful. An existence \nproof in the form of a URL would help ... but I think it would be \ndifficult to deploy a web application, accessible via a browser, that \n/couldn&#39;t/ be RESTful at all.\n\n&gt;&gt; [...] a(nother) oft-neglected constraint of REST, Code-On-Demand:\n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_7&gt;.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. Quite right. I&#39;ve been advocating it here for quite a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this excuses pushing architectural behaviour into such code though. I may be mistaken but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d find Roy advocating that either.\n&gt;\n&gt; What javascript and flash *are* useful for is user experience (AJAX driven apps etc...) and also things that the browser absolutely can&#39;t do such as reading from a camera\nRespectfully, I tend to disagree -- all of a systems components should \nrespect the\n broader system architecture. Javascript and AJAX are prime examples of \nthe code-on-demand style where one should avoid undermining the \nprinciples of REST. The chain only being as strong as the weakest link, \nand all that. ... For example, what good is it for the page containing \nthe Javascript to be cacheable, while all the niggling little AJAX \nrequests are not?\n\n\nCheerfully,\nElias\n\n"}}
