The application developer could\n&gt; &gt; have the server interpret the deletion of a collection, as a\n&gt; &gt; request to delete all member resources in that collection.  A user\n&gt; &gt; could then create a collection, like any other, for the purpose of\n&gt; &gt; deleting it and whatever entries it references.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tradeoff in such a configuration, is eliminating the ability to\n&gt; &gt; delete a collection *without* deleting its member resources.  Ask\n&gt; &gt; yourself if any reduction in API functionality is acceptable, for\n&gt; &gt; the purpose of optimizing DELETE -- a method whose traffic doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; amount to a very big slice of the overall network-traffic pie to\n&gt; &gt; begin with.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it your position that all resources which represent a collection of\n&gt; other resources violate REST constraints?\n&gt; \n\nNo, I was discussing the ramifications of treating requests made against\ncollections differently than requests made against members.  In a\nuniform connector interface, the goal is to &quot;constrain[s] the interface\nto a consistent set of semantics for all resources,&quot; whereas the\nexample in this thread would apply BDELETE semantics to collections and\nregular DELETE semantics to members.  I&#39;m talking about the nature of\nrequests made against collections, not the nature of collections.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
