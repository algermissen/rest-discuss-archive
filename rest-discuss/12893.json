Sure, I=\r\n will agree it *seems* innocuous but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s the difference between=\r\n a search service and a search application.  However, they still support th=\r\ne old &quot;google.com/search?&quot; URI, by the way.  This is probably why I never n=\r\noticed it sooner:  I always use a keyboard hotkey that triggers search acce=\r\nlerator that uses the old URI.\n\nI know GMail and others use this &quot;Kill The =\r\nQuestion Mark&quot; trick, but essentially its a big shift in abstracting out th=\r\ne browser and HTTP.\n\nBottom line: This replaces the browser&#39;s TransferAgent=\r\n object/service with the application&#39;s own InternalTransferAgent object/ser=\r\nvice, insulating the application from the browser&#39;s knowledge about how to =\r\nhandle URI requests.  This is a radical shift in architecture, even if seem=\r\ningly innocuous, and I call it _a change for the good of humankind_.\n\nThis =\r\ndegree of loose coupling is similar to not depending on STDIN/STDOUT, which=\r\n support for varies by OS, for your metaphor of coroutines.  Instead of suc=\r\nh coupling to I/O device, one might be seen using sockets instead (the port=\r\ns/connections metaphor of coroutines).\n\nSo &quot;just&quot; is unjustified.\n\nRight no=\r\nw browsers encourage a bias towards tight coupling with the transfer agent,=\r\n and it is only through coincidence that it is stable enough to meet most n=\r\needs, up until now.\n\nMaybe I am alone on this, but I think the ? and # syst=\r\nem is the hugest hack in HTTP, and feel it came as an afterthought for how =\r\nto handle what seemed like a small and simple problem.  (I reserve the righ=\r\nt to change my mind.)\n\n\n"}}
