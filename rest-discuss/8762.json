I think it&#39;s worth responding to at length:\n\n    I&#39;m perplexed why your transaction example in Chap. 8 didn&#39;t\nsimply create a transaction resource that included both checking &\nsavings account as well as the transfer amount w/ a PUT (defining the\nresource as XML in the request body). Then you could simply call\n/transaction/11a5/commit or even just assume that this is a request to\ncommit the transaction by default and avoid the 2nd call altogether.\nIs there a specific reason why it was not done this way? I can already\nsee the &quot;REST-haters&quot; rolling their eyes to this three\nrequest/response transaction pattern.\n\nThe short answer is that if I&#39;d presented it that way, the\n&quot;REST-haters&quot; would have an even better reason to roll their eyes: it\nwould look like I couldn&#39;t think of a resource-oriented way to do\ntransactions and I&#39;d had to fall back to the RPC style.\n&lt;/excerpt&gt;\n\n"}}
