At one time I thought &quot;TURN&quot; (ala \n&gt; SMTP) could be used, but support for that really needs to be \n&gt; baked in to the message syntax from day one since \n&gt; intermediaries would have to know not to balk at requests \n&gt; appearing where responses were expected.  CONNECT lets any \n&gt; intermediaries know that they&#39;re not supposed to understand \n&gt; what&#39;s going on, so that situation isn&#39;t a problem.\nIf the client application is more controllable than a browser, then this\napproach should work great. The client initiates the connection, does some\nchecking, then requests that the roles between server and client be\nreversed.\nYou would want a special server that not only understands how to interact\nwith the client in this manner, but also how to receive requests and forward\nthem down to the client - basically acting as a reverse proxy.\nSomeone could even host a cloud of these reverse proxies for any client\napplication to use as a &#39;service&#39;.\n\n"}}
