Maybe even if they are hash tables.  But I&#39;m not clear, if they \n&gt; are more complex data structures, how well these verbs would map.  \n&gt; There&#39;s no obvious way to do a search, for example.  If a book is at \n&gt; /books/2893, I can delete that book, or replace it, but how do I search \n&gt; for a book with &quot;REST&quot; in the title?  Maybe GET \n&gt; /book-search?title-contains=REST, but then, what&#39;s the resource? \n\n\nThe search results\n\n&gt; The \n&gt; book search?  What happens if I do PUT /book-search &quot;blah blah blah&quot;?  \n&gt; Does it change the code?\n\nPossibly. Or the server could refuse the request and respond with a 400 \nlevel code.\n\n\n&gt; Is it possible to apply REST to any other actions, besides data \n&gt; manipulation?  Suppose my HTTP server is a robot, and I want to tell it \n&gt; to ring the doorbell.  What verb would apply?  \n\nPOST, though I question whether this really falls within the HTTP model, \nwhich focuses more on what representations the server returns than on \nany side effect on the server. If by &quot;ring the bell&quot; you mean return a \nrepresentation of the bell as an MP3, then it would be GET.\n\n&gt; What&#39;s the resource - the \n&gt; robot?  It&#39;s arm?  Or the doorbell? \n\nThe resource is what the URI identifies. Resources are known only be \ntheir representations. Don&#39;t worry about what&#39;s really happening. It&#39;s \nlike the Coipenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Don&#39;t ask \nwhat&#39;s really going on inside the atom. that way lies madness. You tell \nme what URL you POST to. I&#39;ll tell you what representations you get \nback. What the resource really *is* simply doesn&#39;t matter all that much.\n\n&gt; Suppose I want to tell it to wait \n&gt; until the toast pops up, then put it on a plate.  What&#39;s the verb for \n&gt; that? \n\nWhat&#39;s &quot;it&quot;? What do you mean by &quot;wait&quot;? But regardless of the answer to \nthat question, this is likely POST.\n\n&gt; All these sorts of things are easy to cover with RPC, or OO-type \n&gt; predicates, where you can make up verbs at will.  Is REST just not \n&gt; suited to these sorts of situations? \n\nPerhaps the toast one. The &quot;wait&quot; is especially problematic. It can \neasily handle the others.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
