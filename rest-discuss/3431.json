How do I restrict access to that page?  If HTTP is the protocol\n&gt;&gt;used to access resources, then it has to provide some mechanism for\n&gt;&gt;controlling access.  Where else would you suggest putting the access\n&gt;&gt;control mechanism?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You POST credentials to a login resource and\n&gt;receive a redirect to the restricted URL.\n&gt;\nBut how do I relate that login resource to the resources that are protected?\n\n--Chuck\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
