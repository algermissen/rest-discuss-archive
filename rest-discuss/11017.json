RoR has a  \n&gt; similar convention, but there is nothing standard about it. It is all  \n&gt; about convenience to extract data (e.g. IDs) from path segments and/or  \n&gt; query strings in particular implementations.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nAgreed that it&#39;s just a convention, and that neither is &quot;standard&quot; in \nany sense.  But there is (at least) one important consideration that \nmight affect your choice of one format versus another ... caching.  The \nformat that includes the identifier in the URI itself, such as:\n\n    http://localhost/MyResources/{Id}/State\n\noffers you the opportunity (if you set your cache control headers \ncorrectly) to let the data for each particular value of {Id} to be \ncached by an intermediary between you and the client, while the \nparameter based format:\n\n    http://localhost/MyResources/State?id={Id}\n\ndoes not, because request parameters are not considered part of the key \nunder which caching occurs.\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;   \nCraig McClanahan\n\n&gt; On Jul 9, 2008, at 9:32 AM, Kevin Duffey wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; So I could be wrong here, but I thought what prashanthshenoyu  \n&gt;&gt; describes is infact standard... in that..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://localhost//MyResources/{Id}/State\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; would be parsed as MyResources/1/State would be a complete path to a  \n&gt;&gt; specific MyResources instance (1), and with that, the State resource  \n&gt;&gt; would be used?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At least in using the JSR-311 with Java, I would set up a path  \n&gt;&gt; handler for /MyResources/{id}/State and in that method handler I  \n&gt;&gt; could get the ID and from it determine the State resource to work  \n&gt;&gt; with, return, etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As for the other way around\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://localhost//MyResources/State?Id =1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This would be a completely different resource, where MyResources/ \n&gt;&gt; State would be comparable to the above example of MyResources/1, but  \n&gt;&gt; instead of a numeric id value, you&#39;re using State. From that, you  \n&gt;&gt; are passing in to the State resource a query string of id=1, thus a  \n&gt;&gt; key/value of id/1.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The first uri above seems to be a one extra resource handler. That  \n&gt;&gt; is to say, if you had a\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET /MyResources\n&gt;&gt; GET /MyResources/1\n&gt;&gt; GET /MyResources/1/State\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; each would return something different.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The 2nd URI is a little different.. you only have\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET /MyResources\n&gt;&gt; GET /MyResources/State\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know if this is correct, I am very new to all this too,  \n&gt;&gt; this is just my understanding of how it would work. If I am wrong, I  \n&gt;&gt; am very interested in knowing why/how so I can learn more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt;&gt; From: Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: prashanthshenoyu &lt;prashanthshenoyu@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 9, 2008 8:03:38 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Query string format\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is strictly implementation level detail.
