This is just the underlying data model; you can express it in a documen=\r\nt however makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; personally, i would feel more comfortable wi=\r\nth having a registry that is of equal value to people regardless of their i=\r\nmplementation language\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You&#39;re using &quot;language&quot; quite loosely here. \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; , but then again that means that the registry itself must define a =\r\n&quot;mini-language&quot; of its own.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -1.
