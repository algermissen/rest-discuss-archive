I&#39;ve\n&gt; followed the list for over a year now, but I&#39;ve never posted, and I\n&gt; know the subject of this message may cause some commotion, but that&#39;s\n&gt; not my intent, so please don&#39;t mistake me for a troll. This is a\n&gt; genuine question.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the design of the URL important to the REST architectural style?\n&gt;\n&gt; For a long time, I thought it was because I heard others saying it\n&gt; was, and I see a lot of people talking about designing &quot;RESTful URLs,&quot;\n&gt; but the more I dig into Roy&#39;s dissertation and the more I think about\n&gt; it, can a URL even be called &quot;RESTful?&quot; It seems to me that the term\n&gt; doesn&#39;t apply to URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, REST has the concept of resources, and resources have addresses,\n&gt; and those addresses on the Web are Uniform Resource Identifiers, but\n&gt; is the design of those identifiers important to REST?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m asking because I truly want to know if, over time, the design of\n&gt; the identifier has become a part of what it means to be RESTful.\n&gt; Perhaps it&#39;s become part of the concepts of REST over time as the\n&gt; community has evolved and discourse has taken place to define what is\n&gt; and isn&#39;t RESTful. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking here.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I discuss REST on my blog, in articles, in presentations, etc.,\n&gt; is it important for me to also discuss the design of the URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I do think well-designed URLs are important. That&#39;s not the\n&gt; question I&#39;m asking. I&#39;m asking whether they are part of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Ben\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
