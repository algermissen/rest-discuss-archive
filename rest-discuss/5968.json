Take a look at http://www.yahoo.com.  It&#39;s got a lot of \n&gt;&gt; resources on one page.  It&#39;s got a directory, a list of movies, stuff \n&gt;&gt; about small businesses, featured services, entertainment, buzz log, \n&gt;&gt; news, traffic, etc.  Are you saying the only RESTful way to do this is \n&gt;&gt; to give each of these separate URLs?  I guess the pictures are already \n&gt;&gt; being downloaded as separate resources, so maybe it&#39;s not too much of a \n&gt;&gt; stretch.  It just seems so much more efficient for the server to compose \n&gt;&gt; it on the fly.  \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I believe you&#39;re quite wrong. Pipelining and persistent connections\n&gt; negated the performance penalty of many resources years ago.\n&gt;   \nOK, I can accept that.\n&gt; And anyway, we&#39;re talking about scalability; not performance.\n&gt;   \nI&#39;m not sure why session state is not scalable.  It can be replicated \namongst servers like anything else.\n&gt; Note that REST isn&#39;t some new idea that was just dreamed up. There are\n&gt; many apps out there built with these techniques. They tend to be the\n&gt; highly scalable ones.\n&gt;   \nMaybe I need a good definition of scalability.\n&gt;&gt; If you want to have things like online banking, or personalized site \n&gt;&gt; pages (like Yahoo can do), or web mail, I don&#39;t see how you can avoid \n&gt;&gt; having two things.  E.g., the URL for your April bank statement is \n&gt;&gt; http://www.bank.com/statements/200604, and your identity is passed along \n&gt;&gt; some other way, say through a cookie. \n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Authentication is not tangenital to the resource. It is part of the\n&gt; resource. HTTP authentication is part of the header.\nPart of the header &lt;&gt; Part of the URL.  There&#39;s a lot of talk that it \nisn&#39;t RESTful unless the resource identification is in the URL, not just \nany place in the header.\n&gt;  You can even do\n&gt; cookie authentication this way (by keeping the auth details in the\n&gt; header).\n&gt;   \nSo cookies aren&#39;t really any different than HTTP authentication, right?  \nThey are both passed through the header.  They both require that the \nclient store state - the authentication details.\n&gt; But the caching model in HTTP works for resources. Nothing else. So\n&gt; a cache can handle resource changes... Last Modified resource caching\n&gt; is particularly easy to implement (hence it&#39;s inclusion in many\n&gt; frameworks).\n&gt;   \nSo I guess the caching model will be broken, if you use HTTP \nauthentication details to select a resource.  Doesn&#39;t that make HTTP \nauthentication non-RESTful?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
