By saying &quot;between them&quot; you&#39;ve opened the\n&gt; door for me to add hypertext that links the documents externally. In\n&gt; other words I&#39;m now allowed to use the tool I&#39;m supposed to compare.\n\nSorry, &quot;without links to them.&quot;  Bottom line, Paul --- although everything on the Web *can* be linked to,\nnot everything is.  Yet everything that is nameable by a URI --- regardless of whether it has inbound or\noutbound links in some hyperstructure --- is still part of &quot;the Web.&quot;\n\nThe Web enables hypertext.  It is not defined by it, nor is it intended to be constrained by it.  The\nstatement &quot;hypermedia is the engine of application state&quot; is another onion in the varnish, a hypermedia\nenthusiast&#39;s statement of opinion about the Web rather than a true principle of its design, IMO.  It seems\nto me that, by itself, HTTP is the application, not XML or HTML.  It seems to me, after months of\nconsideration, that the problem with Roy&#39;s formulation of REST is not that it is too constraining but rather\nthat it is *not constraining enough* --- it fails to separate the concerns of generic resource modeling and\nrepresentational state transfer from the concerns of a particular kind of state that might be transferred,\ni.e. hypermedia.  But that&#39;s a later argument.\n\nI&#39;m working on a set of examples for the Wiki beyond the one I&#39;ve repeatedly offered which illustrate how\ndispensing with the pretext of opacity enables some things that are not possible simply through graph\ntraversal from an opaquely-named entry point and how it simplifies and makes many other things more\nefficient.  I&#39;ll post here when that is ready for perusal.\n\n\n&gt; Now if I am JUST the spider writer and I have no opportunity to\n&gt; co-ordinate with the service creator then I may be reduced to hacking.\n\nYes, you are reduced to &quot;hacking&quot; in this case --- *because* of opacity.  (The limitation to being the\nspider writer should&#39;ve been clear in the original problem statement.)  Dispensing with opacity and\nintroducing explicit information about organizational schemes and the specific semantics of structured names\nelevates that activity to something more disciplined.\n\n&gt; Now that you&#39;ve stated the problem as a problem, I&#39;ve applied my hammer\n&gt; and as far as I can see it works fine.\n\nNo, you seized on a misstatement of mine (I incorrectly said &quot;between&quot; when &quot;to&quot; was the more limiting\nstatement I was going for, and indeed used in earlier formulations) and ran with it.  Further, you ignored\none basic premise that was clear, namely that your task was constrained by virtue of not being in local\ncontrol of the resources in question.\n\njb\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
