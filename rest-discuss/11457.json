Any feedback is welcome.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Hi Alan,\n&gt;\n&gt; great stuff. Some remarks specific to invidual slides:\n&gt;\n&gt; Slide 10: I think sometimes turning application state into resource\n&gt; state is perfectly fine because it actually creates value.\n\nI agree, so long as only the client knows about it. In effect it is\nsimply a persistence store for the client. If the application server\nknows about it (regardless that it may be actually hosted on the same\nphysical server) the I regard the Layered System to have been\nbreached.\n\n&gt; Slide 28: I would claim that using cookies to authenticate is just as\n&gt; good or bad as using a non-standardized HTTP auth scheme\n\nAgreed. I am using &quot;Cookies&quot; as a proxy for all non-standard auth in the slide.\n\n&gt; Slide 29: If the last bullet is supposed to say &quot;REST doesn&#39;t scale if\n&gt; access control is required&quot;, I disagree :-)\n\nReally? I&#39;m interested to hear why.\n\n&gt; General remarks:\n&gt; - I think you need to credit Paul Downey for the REST posse picture\n\nThanks, I didn&#39;t actually know where the posse picture cam from. Added credit.\n\n&gt; - Some day someone should re-draw Roy&#39;s hideous diagrams with a decent\n&gt; tool\n&gt;\n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Stefan\n\n"}}
