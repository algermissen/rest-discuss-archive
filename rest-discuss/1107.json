It makes for a nice code framework though.\nI built something with the same goals a number of years ago (with java in a\nservlet environment) and found that the system of objects exposed tended to\nbe addressed purely through path segments and the parameters tended to be\nnegotiation things (I wasn&#39;t able to use actual headers, as I was operating\nin a browser client environment) - for example I would put\n&quot;do:accept=text/xml&quot; in a query term in order to request an xml\nrepresentation. I like the approach and encourage you to keep on going with\nyour coding.\n\nThe problem I found was that a lot of server environments didn&#39;t nicely\nsupport using uri paths segments to acquire &#39;object request handlers&#39; or\n&#39;resource instances&#39;. Another problem was the expectations and attitudes of\nthe programmer community - putting everything into query terms is very\npopular, because generating URIs is the standard way of doing things - but\nhopefully this forum will help that issue.\n\n\n\n"}}
