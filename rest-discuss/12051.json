This is something I have come to\nunderstand/appreciate more fully recently.  If your API docs describe\na bunch of URL patterns, there&#39;s code smell (in the sense of REST),\nsince interactions should all be hypertext driven, not URL\nconstruction driven.  The client should only need to know about the\nmime types and the link relations offered by the service to make use\nof it.  My own take is that while well-constructed URLs may be the\nmark of a well-design application, they do not have much to do with\nREST.\n\nI highly recommend a recent blog post by Roy Fielding [1] on this matter.\n\n--peter keane\n\n[1] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n\nOn Sat, Jan 31, 2009 at 10:17 PM, Ben Ramsey &lt;benramsey.lists@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Please forgive this intrusion from an &quot;outsider&quot; to this list. I&#39;ve\n&gt; followed the list for over a year now, but I&#39;ve never posted, and I\n&gt; know the subject of this message may cause some commotion, but that&#39;s\n&gt; not my intent, so please don&#39;t mistake me for a troll. This is a\n&gt; genuine question.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the design of the URL important to the REST architectural style?\n&gt;\n&gt; For a long time, I thought it was because I heard others saying it\n&gt; was, and I see a lot of people talking about designing &quot;RESTful URLs,&quot;\n&gt; but the more I dig into Roy&#39;s dissertation and the more I think about\n&gt; it, can a URL even be called &quot;RESTful?&quot; It seems to me that the term\n&gt; doesn&#39;t apply to URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, REST has the concept of resources, and resources have addresses,\n&gt; and those addresses on the Web are Uniform Resource Identifiers, but\n&gt; is the design of those identifiers important to REST?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m asking because I truly want to know if, over time, the design of\n&gt; the identifier has become a part of what it means to be RESTful.\n&gt; Perhaps it&#39;s become part of the concepts of REST over time as the\n&gt; community has evolved and discourse has taken place to define what is\n&gt; and isn&#39;t RESTful. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking here.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I discuss REST on my blog, in articles, in presentations, etc.,\n&gt; is it important for me to also discuss the design of the URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I do think well-designed URLs are important. That&#39;s not the\n&gt; question I&#39;m asking. I&#39;m asking whether they are part of REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Ben\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
