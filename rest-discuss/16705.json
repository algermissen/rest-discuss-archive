Strings are not Internet Media Types,\n&gt; therefore they are not self-descriptive, therefore not standardized,\n&gt; therefore not uniform, therefore library-based instead of network-\n&gt; based, therefore not remotely the same style as REST.\n&gt; \n\nWe can discuss the theoretical importance of this for proprietary\nsystems until the cows come home, of course, provided that we agree on\nthe definition of &quot;media type&quot; vs. &quot;data type + identifier string&quot;.\nBut the ramifications of the constraint lead to this advice:\n\n&quot;[W]orking with the community and discussing the proposed media type\nwith experts on the ietf-types list in order to create something that\ncan be registered will probably lead to better results.  There are many\npeople who are happy to help create solutions for problems, and\nstandardization bodies + would-be communities that will gladly assist\nin creating a standardized solution.&quot;\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/16653\n\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with some outside review, even for proprietary\nsolutions, of any proposed media type (there&#39;s no such thing as an\nunregistered media type).  Even if the decision is made to continue\nsending a string in Content-Type in lieu of a media type, surely some\ninsight from experts in media type design would be of use.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n"}}
