In REST circles, you&#39;ll encounter the phrase\n &gt; &quot;HTTP != REST&quot; which means that REST is a subset of the things you can\n &gt; do with HTTP, not the entire set of things you can do with HTTP.  99%\n &gt; of &quot;REST APIs&quot; out there are really HTTP APIs, all hail the power of\n &gt; the buzzword...\n\nYes, that&#39;s the case and somehow an (mainly) accepted mistake in \nreality, or? I guess it&#39;s even harder to try to convince the majority \nfrom the opposite.\nSo the $1-million-question is (maybe asked periodical here all the time):\n\nWhich service (or in general application) is 100% RESTful? Please name \nme one service (I tried all the time hard to find one; even in the \n&quot;non-RESTful&quot;-blog from Roy T. Fielding, this question was asked several \ntimes in the comments; however, without a response). Is this even \npossible? Since even the &quot;referential implementation&quot;, the Web \n(especially the HTTP protocol as part of it), can&#39;t satisfy currently \nsuch constraints.\nDo we really need the &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot; \nfor services? Is it highly responsible for &quot;user-perceived performance&quot; \n(latency, which should be minimum as possible). Is &quot;hypermedia as the \nengine of application state&quot; only a feature for web-browser-like \napplications? However, there are much more applications out there that \ncommunicate nicely via the Web. Would e.g. XAML be an option that can \nfulfil that constraint?\nIs the set of REST constraints as a whole maybe overrated to emphasize \n&quot;scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, \nindependent deployment of components, and intermediary components to \nreduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy \nsystems&quot;?\nAll the so-called &quot;RESTful APIs&quot; live mainly without the &quot;hypermedia as \nthe engine of application state&quot; and can often scale quite well by \ndelivering a &quot;user-perceived performance&quot;. Isn&#39;t it often even more the \ndesign and utilization of the server-side hardware and the Internet \nconnection that is responsible for the scalability?\nSo, if I create an application that is fully REST compatible, does this \ninclude a &quot;guarantee&quot; for emphasizing the above stated features?\n\nI really like true-REST. However, the question is still: do we really \nneed it? Since not even &quot;all components of the deployed Web obey every \nconstraint present in&quot; the REST architectural design.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n"}}
