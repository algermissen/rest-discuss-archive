However, I have\n&gt; &gt; run i=\r\nnto a little problem, some issue trackers have workflow\n&gt; &gt; constraints tha=\r\nt depends on the state.. For instance an issue cannot\n&gt; &gt; be reopened if it=\r\n isn&#39;t resolved or closed. Furthermore, let&#39;s say I\n&gt; &gt; have a resolved iss=\r\nue but I&#39;m conducting a PUT with state =3D &quot;Open&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; This is not allowed,=\r\n unless I make my wrapper first reopen the issue,\n&gt; &gt; then start progress, =\r\nand then stop progress again. I might just\n&gt; &gt; implement this hack, but wha=\r\nt I want to know is how I should express\n&gt; &gt; these workflow constraints RES=\r\nTfully if i want to..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I figure one can use urls like: issues/open, =\r\nissues/resolved etc.. But\n&gt; &gt; how do I then move an open issue to /issues/r=\r\nesolved ? If I conduct a\n&gt; &gt; POST to /resolved I would create a new issues.=\r\n. and that would be\n&gt; &gt; wrong?
