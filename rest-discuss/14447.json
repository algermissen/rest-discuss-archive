My only doubt so far is that in this case the =\r\nclient should be fat enough to know how to deal with situations where it br=\r\neaks between the first and second step working with two resources.\n&gt; i.e. t=\r\nhe user wants to buy a set of products, which was broken by the client app =\r\nin two subsets, each one to be bought in two different suppliers. Both requ=\r\nest for quotations were sent successfully, one order is also fine, but the =\r\nsecond order breaks due to out-of-stock issues (someone just bought it.... =\r\nnot acid). The client is now responsible for trying to cancel that first or=\r\nder.\n&gt; Any workarounds/suggestions?\n\nIf I understand correctly, you are pos=\r\ning a situation where the\nprovisional phase (quotations) has become final (=\r\norders, which both\nbuyer and seller have agreed to) and now the second sell=\r\ner has failed\nto deliver so the buyer wants to cancel the first order.  Cor=\r\nrect?\n\nAin&#39;t no transaction protocol that will save you.  As Jan Algermisse=\r\nn\nsuggested, stuff happens...\n\nIf the orders had penalty clauses, the secon=\r\nd seller may need to make\ngood.  If the first order had a cancellation fee,=\r\n the buyer may need\nto pay it.  And the first seller may lose some resource=\r\ns of some type.\n\n"}}
