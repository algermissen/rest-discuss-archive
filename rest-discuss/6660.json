If the only way you\nwill get to product 345 is via direct links from other web pages on your\nsite and the sites of others, then the second form is fine and preferred\nby many. However, existing HTML forms technology prefers urls to have a\nquery part. As such, if you want your user to type &quot;345&quot; into a form and\nget your URL you should use the first url.\n\nAs a guess, I would think that this won&#39;t be a constraint for this\nparticular case. It would usually only affect the URLs that a search\nform looks up. These are more likely to be something like\n&lt;http://example.com/search?terms=cuddly+bear+toys&maxprice=15&gt;.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
