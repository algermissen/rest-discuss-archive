REST\nis an architectural style – it’s *two* abstractions removed from\nactual applications. (One too many for most people, as Roy often\nremarks in saying that.) HTTP is an architecture; one level of\nabstraction closer.\n\nSo if anything, it would have to be the other way around:\n\nUsing HTTP well is largely about doing representational state\ntransfer.\n\nBut there are aspects to using HTTP well (such as ETags and\nfriends) that don’t really have anything to do with REST at all\n(in any deeper sense than that more RESTful systems potentially\nbenefit more from them).\n\nAnd coming back to the original question: URI design – or, more\nbroadly stated, address design – is orthogonal to the transfer\nof state via representations. If you put all your emphasis on\naddresses, you get REST/RPC hybrids. Representational state\ntransfer is all about representations, as the name implies,\nnot about addresses.\n\nAll that said:\n\nI personally don’t mind any of these topics on this list.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
