And if, as in this  \n&gt; case, you want the collections to preserve their ordering, RFC3648  \n&gt; gives you an interoperable and tested way to do this.\n\nI agree with you in the sense that my action is essentially a MOVE,  \nand thus that would be better.\n\nNevertheless this is a web application and I need to come up with an  \nAPI for an ordered collection. The best I&#39;ve come with by now is  \nsomething like this (assume a task list):\n\n   # get task list\n   GET /tasks\n\n   # get the first task\n   GET /tasks/first\n\n   # get the last task\n   GET /tasks/last\n\n   # get a task by position\n   GET /tasks/{position}\n\n   # push a new task\n   POST /tasks\n\nBut I have no idea how MOVE fits there, or which would be the right  \nway to delete a task, because to avoid race conditions with the  \nposition I would like to be able to refer to them by ID as well.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
