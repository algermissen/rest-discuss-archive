Such dependencies\ncan be programmatically adjusted as whole trees of resources\njust as easily as any single resource.  However, that doesn&#39;t\nmean that REST implies one particular design of URI space\nis somehow &quot;more RESTful&quot; than some other design, which\nwas the original point being argued.  Aside from the legacy\ncache issues, any given organized structure is just as\ngood as any other organized structure, and both are better\nthan a disorganized structure. That&#39;s what we mean by\n&quot;it just doesn&#39;t matter to REST how you design your URIs.&quot;\n\nIIRC, the complaint was about APIs that have a standard\nURI structure.  The problem with that is not the structure,\nbut rather the way that the structure is communicated to\nclients (by antiquated agreement rather than by following\nyour nose).  The follow-your-nose style has the built-in\ncapacity for indirection and redirection at the time\nof the current interaction, whereas standard layouts\nencourage the client to bake-in assumptions that will\ninevitably break.\n\nThat does not mean it isn&#39;t RESTful to have permanent URIs.\nREST is still dependent on at least one starting URI, and\nthus it is always going to be better for the URIs to be\npermanent.  It just isn&#39;t necessary to structure the\napplication around such permanence.\n\nBookmarks are resource identifiers from a prior interaction.\nThey are bread-crumbs. Sometimes they get eaten.\n\nREST doesn&#39;t enter into the discussion until one of the\nURIs is actively traversed and the application enters one of\nits initial states.  After that point the user agent is led\nby the nose through the application.  If the application is\ndesigned correctly, then the only times that the user agent\nwill pause long enough to make a bookmark will be at one of\nthe application steady states, which should correspond to one\nof the cool URIs.  In other words, a RESTful architecture will\nexpose the cool URIs (and only the cool URIs) to the user.\n\nREST cannot remove all the points of coupling.  It can reduce\nthose points of coupling to the set of URIs that an organization\nis willing to maintain over time for bookmarks (cool URIs).\nHow many of those you have is entirely up to the organization.\nIt is certainly possible for all of the URIs to be maintained.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
