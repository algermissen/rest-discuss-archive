(great explanation)\n\n&gt; As well, the semantics of POST are still inappropriate, I think. \n&gt; There&#39;s no need for an unsafe, non-idempotent operation to enter the mix\n&gt; to handle, basically, a bunch of GETs.\n\nWell I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re adding anything to the mix by using POST.\nYou can just substitute the initialisation of the mumbleIds variable\nwith the POST of the mumbleIds resource.\n\nWorking back to where you get the mumbleIds value from; if its the\nresult of a computation, you have a line of code along the lines of\n\nmumbleIds = some_routine\nor\nsome_routine(mumbleIds)\n\nI think you could substitute\nPOST value_of(some_routine)\nfor that line.\n\nI&#39;m taking liberties with pseudocode here, if it needs clarification,\nask.\n\n&gt; Therefore, I&#39;m disinclined to create a resource or use POST for this\n&gt; batchGET.\n&gt; \n&gt; Plus the round-trip overhead of POST + GET; probably a small price to\n&gt; pay, though.\n\nI see it as O(1) where the variable is the the number of items to GET.\n\n&gt; At the same time, I&#39;m sympathetic to the desire to have a QUERY\n&gt; operation which takes a request body, which helps satisify a different\n&gt; class of queries.\n\nI try to eliminate the problem before thinking about a solution for it,\nso I may come to be sympathetic to this if the problem persists after a\nweek or two.  A real world example would be helpful, but I don&#39;t have\none.\n\nCheers for the helpful comments, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll end up referring to them\nsome day.\n\n"}}
