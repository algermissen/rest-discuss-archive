There&#39;s simply no\nplace to put another URI/method combination, except as instructions to\nthe server (in the message body instead of in headers).  But REST is\nnot about sending instructions to the server, it&#39;s about sending a\nrepresentation of an application state to the server.\n\nI don&#39;t care if a new resource for today&#39;s weather is created using PUT\nor POST, there is no header I know of that can be added to either method\nwhich would instruct the server to also do something to some other URI,\nlike &quot;also PUT a copy of this submission at /current-weather&quot;.\n\nTo clarify, REST makes no provision for the client to request more than\none action on one URI at a time.  The server may do whatever it wants,\nlike create or update some other resource when it creates a resource.\nBut the client cannot make such a request.  The client isn&#39;t prohibited\nfrom accomplishing the same thing the server does, it just has to use\nas many discrete requests as it takes to get it done, no corner-cutting\nbatch transactions allowed.\n\nSince the client can accomplish the same thing as server logic, using\nmultiple requests, I don&#39;t see what problem batch processing solves.\nOther than &quot;too many requests&quot; which is a side-effect of the\narchitectural style (it&#39;s a given), not a problem to be solved.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen comments  \n&gt; about visibility in this thread, but it is a matter of making  \n&gt; tradeoffs. In a lot of real-world applications, reads and writes do  \n&gt; have side effects, and it would be unreasonable to leak those side  \n&gt; effects to the client.\n&gt; \n\nI haven&#39;t suggested otherwise.  What I&#39;m saying is those side-effects\ncan&#39;t be controlled by the client.  If the creation of one resource\nhappens to cause the creation of another resource, that&#39;s a perfectly\nallowable application behavior.  What is _not_ allowed is for the\nclient to dictate that its request to create a resource also must\ncreate or update some specific other resource.  And so on.\n\nI&#39;ve tried to keep it simple by stating that if you&#39;re sending\ninstructions to the server (like a list of URIs to delete), that\nrepresentation doesn&#39;t begin to resemble an application state, so the\ninteraction is, by definition, something other than REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
