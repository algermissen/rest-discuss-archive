The client nevertheless has to understand\nwhat to do with that specific resource in order to reach its goal - whether\nit&#39;s LE or LO doesn&#39;t really matter IMO. Or am I wrong?\n\n\n&gt; if i understand you, you are making a case for representations that\n&gt; indicate variance in what selections clients have; what action they\n&gt; can take. this _seems_ to be at odds w/ what peter indicated to me in\n&gt; his reply.\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;We have the uniform interface so any method may be called on any\n&gt; resource.&lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; do you think i am mis-representing peter&#39;s reply here?\n\nI think so. I think Peter was referring to HTTP methods which are uniform\nand available on all resource. Nevertheless those methods might not be\nsupported and/or allowed for certain resources (at certain times).\n\n\n&gt; let&#39;s steer clear of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; here. i am not making any\n&gt; claims or requirements of this type.  what i have stated to this point\n&gt; is that there are two types of _information_ i am interested in\n&gt; including in messages sent from server to client: protocol-level\n&gt; information and domain-specific information. I have given examples of\n&gt; protocol-level information that i can include in message designs. i\n&gt; have asserted that i am unable to clearly indicate that same level of\n&gt; protocol information when using RDF-based media types. am i incorrect?\n\nThat question here that arises for me is if you can really separate it that\nway!? Protocol level information is in my opinion in most cases quite\ntightly coupled to the domain-specific information, i.e., the application\ndomain. In HTML e.g. it&#39;s hypertext documents and there it surely makes\nsense to have general hyperlinks and forms. In RDF you are talking about raw\ndata which is interlinked. Since the way of presenting this data is entirely\nup to the client I doubt that a &quot;form&quot; is an adequate abstraction.\n\n\n&gt; i also concede that you and Peter question whether the protocol-level\n&gt; information i have identified is _needed_ in messages from servers.\n&gt; Peter states:\n&gt; &quot;I am not sure why protocol method is important. &quot;\n&gt; and\n&gt; &quot;Why would a media type need to encode [idempotency] information?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And you say:\n&gt; &quot;The difference between LO and LE ... just matters if a human being is\n&gt; looking at a rendered representation of the data &quot;\n&gt; and\n&gt; &quot;[templates are] part of the presentational logic which is unimportant\n&gt; in M2M scenarios.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t question whether they are needed but whether it makes sense to\nseparate them from the domain specific information. A MIME type is\nspecifying a format for a more or less specific application domain. That\nMIME type also specifies how the protocol-level information has to be\ninterpreted so I&#39;m not sure if you can really separate them in the way you\npropose (as I understand it). IOW for me both are at the same level of\nabstraction.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclusively a H2M (human-to-machine)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; affordance, i use &quot;x:include&quot; quite often in M2M cases\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hmm... Could you elaborate a bit on this? Why don&#39;t you simply\n&gt; include it,\n&gt; &gt; i.e., merge it into the response instead of just linking to it?\n&gt; \n&gt; i think the scenario i cited at the top of this reply answers to this\n&gt; point.\n\nI still don&#39;t really understand the difference. It is up to the domain\nsemantics what the client does. Whether the protocol-level information says\nembed or link doesn&#39;t make any difference IMHO. But maybe you are more\nthinking of splitting the semantics into two parts which are: embed (the\nclient *has* to follow this link) + process it according the remaining\ndomain semantics!?\n\n\n&gt; in the implementations i create, not all possible variables are\n&gt; acceptable in call cases, even if all variables are _known_\n&gt; beforehand. in my work clients look in the message to see which of the\n&gt; client&#39;s known variables are valid for this instance and (in some\n&gt; cases) which are required/optional. there is even at least one case\n&gt; where variables are group--dependent (if you supply x you MUST supply\n&gt; x, etc.). these are time/instance dependent cases.\n\nI don&#39;t see why this should be a problem..\n\n\n&gt; i program clients as state machines to be able to recognize\n&gt; affordances and respond to them. some are quitre simple (immutable\n&gt; links for navigation). others are more involved (mutable templates for\n&gt; completing request bodies, URI templates, choices of one or more &quot;next\n&gt; steps&quot; evaulated against a goal or other workflow of the client,\n&gt; etc.).\n&gt; \n&gt; the work i do right now is not a fixed set of  actions w/ static,\n&gt; pre-defined parameters. knowing a set of static state transitions\n&gt; ahead of time is insufficient for this work. instead clients need to\n&gt; be prepared to respond to representations returned by the server.\n\nMaybe you misunderstood me slightly here. All I wanted to say is that it\ndoesn&#39;t matter whether your client looks for a link with rel=&quot;payment&quot; or a\nJSON property &quot;payment&quot;: &quot;URI&quot;. It&#39;s just a different syntax, that&#39;s all..\n\n\n&gt; &gt; But I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary to\n&gt; describe\n&gt; &gt; basic control flows - something I planned to work on rather sooner\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; later.\n&gt; \n&gt; i look forward to hearing more on this.\n\nIf I just would have a bit more time :-(\n\n\n\n--\nMarkus Lanthaler\n@markuslanthaler\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
