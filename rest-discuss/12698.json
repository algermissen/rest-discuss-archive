It seems to have two strengths.\n\n   * It&#39;s a very convenient way of documenting the interface, for  \nhumans.  Given that someone actually wants to use your service,  \nthey&#39;ll want to know what &#39;things&#39; are available, and giving   \n&quot;HATEOAS&quot; as the answer to every question isn&#39;t going to win you  \nfriends.  That is, you _do_ need human documentation, and WADL  \nprovides a reasonable structure for that.\n\n   * You can generate test cases from it.  Part of the build system  \nfor the service described in [1] transforms the WADL file into a test  \ncoverage function, which is called by the hand-written tests to verify  \nthat (a) none of the test cases use an interaction that isn&#39;t  \ndescribed by the WADL (that is, the WADL is telling the truth), and  \n(b) all of the interactions described by the WADL are tested at least  \nonce (that is, the tests have a basic completeness).\n\nI suppose you could generate client code from the WADL, but I can&#39;t  \nthink why you&#39;d want to do that.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nNorman\n\n\n[1] http://myskua.org/doc/qsac/interface-http.html\n\n-- \nNorman Gray  :  http://nxg.me.uk\nDept Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester\n\n\n"}}
