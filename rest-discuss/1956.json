I think that the\nrough concensus is that this is okay but you lose some benefits of the\nWeb if you rely on it too heavily. In particular, hyperlinks are great\nbecause they are discoverable. Query parameters require a little more a\npriori knowledge of how to construct the query values. On the other\nhand, rendering everything as hyperlinks can be unacceptably inefficient\nsometimes. For instance, to find the kinkos in a particular zip code,\nyou could either use a query parameter or build a big hypertext document\nthat associates zip codes with documents. The former is better from a\nperformance point of view. The latter is better from a discovery and\n&quot;semantic web&quot; point of view. Given sufficient time and money, I would\nsuggest you do both. Otherwise, just weigh the costs and benefits and do\nwhat makes sense.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n\n\n"}}
