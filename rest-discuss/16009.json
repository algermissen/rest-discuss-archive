Same sort of problem applies equally to a URL.\n\nThe URL that you give for the book from Amazon, they might define as the\n&quot;customer-facing&quot; view of a book - they might have an alternate internal\nview of a book that gives additional information about vendors that\nprovide the book, which vendor is preferred, the stock, the ordering\ntime/delay, etc.  However, there&#39;s no need for their definition and your\ndefinition of what they put out there to be the same.
