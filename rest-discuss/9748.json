But I don&#39;t see it\nas being a tradeoff at all. Unless you assume we have limited time to\nspend posting to the list, I suppose.\n\nBut really, most of the time when it looks like we&#39;re discussing the\ntrivialities of URI definition, what we&#39;re really looking at is\ndefining the resources that are being exposed. And that&#39;s a big deal,\nI think, and there is more depth there than the simplicity of\nhypermedia&#39;s &quot;put in links!&quot; The latter&#39;s not unimportant, it&#39;s just\nthat there&#39;s seldom anything to consider there.\n\n&gt; Rather, I want to know if more emphasise should be put on the\n&gt; hypermedia aspect.\n\nI won&#39;t argue with that. And it&#39;s something I struggle with in\nWirebird: you can request a representation of any given resource...\nno, wait.  TOO DARN MANY RE* WORDS IN REST!\n\nAhem.\n\nYou can request a page in any flavor (&#39;scuse me while I sidestep\njargon), either by specifying HTTP_ACCEPT or, if there are multiple\nvalid choices there, by the extension, with text/html being the\ndefault (because Wirebird is both a web site and a service, intended\nfor use with dumb semi-compliant browsers as well as\nas-yet-hypothetical smart/automated clients).\n\nThe HTML version, logically enough, is intended for human consumption.\nIn some ways, it&#39;s more hypermedia-complete than other versions,\nbecause it has forms defining precisely how it expects its POSTs and\nPUTs and DELETEs to happen (okay, so they&#39;re all overloaded POSTs, but\nyou work with what you have, y&#39;know?). In other ways, it has the\npotential to be less complete, since it&#39;s template-driven, and\nsometimes you don&#39;t want to overwhelm the user with options - but\nunless a template is actually broken, you can always &quot;get there from\nhere.&quot;\n\nThe Perl and JSON versions, and the generic-XML version when I get off\nmy lazy butt and implement it (yeah, you can tell where I fall on the\nJSON vs. XML wars: the lazy side), all just do a big fat dump of every\nvalue they&#39;ve come up with for that particular representation... so\nthey should be hypermedia-complete (when everything&#39;s finished,\nanyway), sometimes redundantly (&quot;there&#39;s more than one way to get\nthere from here.&quot;) In practice, they&#39;re not as complete as the HTML\nversion because I can alter things in the template: &quot;a href=&#39;&lt;tmpl_var\nsome_link&gt;/addendum.html&#39;&quot; and such, but when I&#39;m not being lazy those\nare supposed to find their way back into the raw values.\n\nIt&#39;s the RSS and Atom versions that bother me.  And maybe they\nshouldn&#39;t, since RSS (especially) isn&#39;t exactly a standard designed\nfor such general use. (Atompub, on the other hand, is high on my list\nof &quot;things I really need to investigate and, no doubt, implement&quot;)\nThey don&#39;t really stand alone, though there&#39;s an RSS and Atom version\nof every page in the magic &lt;link&gt; headers. But, just as a\nfor-instance, the RSS feed for a single &quot;page&quot; (in the Wirebird sense,\nmeaning a single mailing-list/forum/newsgroup post, wiki page, blog\nentry, or blog comment) has no external links at all, since it&#39;s a\nleaf node:\n\nhttp://forum.wirebird.com/page/gamehawk/main/00000050.rss\n\nThe feed is for page 50, which is also the sole entry in the feed.\nNow, granted, it doesn&#39;t make a great deal of sense to even *have* a\nfeed at leaf-node level, but if you look at the HTML version:\nhttp://forum.wirebird.com/page/gamehawk/main/00000050.html\nyou see there&#39;s twenty or thirty links to various other bits of\nWirebird, near and far. Granted I don&#39;t need to stuff the entire\ncategory/group/topic tree into every RSS feed, but at least the\nbreadcrumb trail would be nice. And packing it all into HTML in\ndescription fields seems like cheating. I know there&#39;s more RSS fields\nthan I&#39;ve gotten around to using (lazy!) but I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s\nenough to be hypermedia-complete across all the things Wirebird can\nserve (categories, groups, topics, threads, pages, author profiles,\netc.).\n\nOr do I just rely on the fact that any RESTful client ought to be\nsmart enough (on seeing the &quot;Vary: Accept&quot; and &quot;Content-Location:\nhttp://forum.wirebird.com/page/gamehawk/main/00000050&quot; headers) to ask\nfor a different flavor, knowing that XML or JSON is more likely to get\nit something hypermedia-complete?\n\n"}}
