The whole idea that media types are **the only** contract (besides URI, HTTP,..) in RESTful systems has completely, absolutely not made it into the current REST-hype bandwagon. Neither has the fact that designing media types is consequently *the* design activity to engage in when doing RESTful systems design.\n&gt; Media types are not the only &#39;contract&#39;. You&#39;re forgetting link relations.\n\nhave to agree with mike here. representations are something that people \nat least are dimly aware of. link relationship types and the fact that \nwithout them, nothing works at all, is even more obscure than \nrepresentations. so advertise link types as well! don&#39;t bury link \nrelationship types in media types (or tightly couple them to a schema), \ninstead design and document and publish link relationship types. not \ncontroversial at all, i just wanted to voice my support for this.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n"}}
