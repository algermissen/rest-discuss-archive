If you do this,\n&gt; all calls\n&gt; to the url.getURLConnection() will then pass those calls through the\n&gt; specified cache.\n&gt; see:\n&gt; http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0085.html\n&gt;\n&gt; On 9 Nov 2007, at 18:11, John Kemp wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Could you achieve the same (or similar anyway) effect by running a\n&gt; &gt; caching HTTP server to perform the actual caching, and just make your\n&gt; &gt; regular HTTP requests of the local server, which would then decide\n&gt; &gt; whether to use the local version or make a network request? Instead\n&gt; &gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; (Java) API call you&#39;d be making HTTP calls only.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks John and Subbu for this idea. It does seem like a good way to\n&gt; get going.\n&gt; As more and more applications become web enabled, one even wonders if\n&gt; this should\n&gt; not come with the operating system...\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone know of a small proxy cache for clients written in java?\n&gt;\n&gt; My client probably will need to keep close track of all the headers\n&gt; and redirects of the call, so that it\n&gt; can help people debug the services they encounter on the web, and also\n&gt; because it will be useful to know which things are information\n&gt; resources and which are not. For example Tim Bray is not an\n&gt; information resource - though he is very resourceful source of\n&gt; information - as you can see by querying\n&gt;\n&gt; curl -i -L -H &quot;Accept: application/rdf+xml&quot; http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Bray\n&gt;\n&gt; Henry\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 11/9/07, Story Henry &lt; henry.story@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am writing a hyperdata web browser client, and was wondering if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there were client side java libraries  to cache http responses, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that I could ask the local cache for a URL and it would return me\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cached version if there were no reason to get something fresh from\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web, or go out and get something on the web. It would be nice if it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knew everything about HTTP redirects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would also like to be able to browse the cache easily for\n&gt; &gt; debugging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purposes. I would like to be able to pull up a window of of cache\n&gt; &gt; &gt; history, find the last request made, and be able to trace all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; request that were made as part of a request.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is important to be able to browse the message exchanges easily so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as to make it easy to debug all of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Henry\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [snip the never ending appended messages]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
