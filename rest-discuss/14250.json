If a \nhuman meets some unexpected state during shopping they either give up or \nreturn to the home page and try again - something you could make the \ncomputer do as well.\n\n&gt; The do not have their own state machine.\n&gt; The do not follow an overall goal.\n\nI think the issue is just the same for humans as well as for computers. A \nhuman usually have a goal - if I go to a shop I want to buy something (or \ncompare prices). I might just be bored and surf around, but that&#39;s another \nsituation - you don&#39;t program computers to be bored :-)\n\nRemember websites back in approx. year 2000 - at that time most people \ndidn&#39;t know about webshops, all webshops were different, there was no \nagreed-upon idea of the UI for a shop, and people *really* had a hard time \nfiguring out how to browse, shop and pay. But over time we, as users, has \nlearned, just like the webshops has become more similar. We, the users, look \nfor a search text field if we want to search by a text, or we look for a \nmenu to browse by category. Then we figure out where the price is located, \nthen we look for the &quot;buy&quot; button ... an so on. We keep looking for more or \nless well defined markers (relations) of how-to-do-what-to-do-next.\n\nWe have *learned* to recognize the &quot;webshop media type&quot; - it consists of \ntext/shop.categories+html, text/shop.item+html, text/shop.order+html and so \non. It&#39;s not exactly standardized, but as humans it&#39;s good enough for us.\n\nIf you were to program a computer such that it could by a book, then you \nwould teach it how to behave when presented with a text/shop.categories+html \n(or rather application/shop.categories+xml) document. In all of the shop \nmedia types there would be a general &quot;navigation&quot; part and this would be \nused to navigate to the place where the program could do what it wanted.\n\nFirst your program would be looking for an application/shop.categories+xml \nressource: given the root URL, it would browse around until it found it, \nexactly like any human would do. Then it would browse for a category, or \nsearch for a word etc. until it found a suitable application/shop.item+xml \nressource with attributes enough for the program to recognize it as the item \nit was looking for. Then it would look for the &quot;buy&quot; relation, and this \nwould lead it to a application/shop.orders+xml ressource and so on and so \non.\n\nI see no difference between the human&#39;s or the computer&#39;s way of interacting \nwith the shop, except for one thing: standardization - a human is extremely \nmore flexible than a computer when trying to recognize a thing. But besides \nthat it&#39;s same same.\n\nSo in my point of view everything is fine. The human web is RESTful, \ncomputers can work in same way, ergo the computer web is RESTful to.\n\nWhat did I miss?\n\nRegards, J�rn\n\n\n"}}
