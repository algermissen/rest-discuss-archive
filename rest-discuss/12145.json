POST /orders\n   &lt;order&gt;&lt;item id=&quot;10&quot;/&gt;&lt;/order&gt;\n\n&lt;- 202 Accepted\n   Location /pending-orders/19\n   &lt;order processingStatus=&quot;pending&quot;/&gt;\n\n\nClient then periodically polls /pending-orders/19:\n\n\n-&gt; GET /pending-orders/19\n\n&lt;- 200 Ok\n   &lt;order processingStatus=&quot;pending&quot;/&gt;\n\n[wait]\n\n-&gt; GET /pending-orders/19\n\n&lt;- 200 Ok\n   &lt;order processingStatus=&quot;pending&quot;/&gt;\n\n[wait]\n\n&gt; GET /pending-orders/19\n\n&lt;- 301 Moved Permanently\n   Location: /orders/188\n \n\n-&gt; GET /orders/188\n\n&lt;- 200 Ok\n   &lt;order id=&quot;188&quot;&gt;&lt;item id=&quot;10&quot;/&gt;&lt;/order&gt;\n\nThe client or server can close the TCP connection between any of these requests.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nJan\n\n\n \nOn Monday, February 23, 2009, at 11:39AM, &quot;Stefan Tilkov&quot;

OK, I&#39;m abusing the term &quot;asynchronous&quot; here but it seems I need to  \n&gt;&gt; in order to describe my problem :).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We have a set of Java applications that take anywhere from 5 min to  \n&gt;&gt; 60 min to execute.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One of the solutions we implemented had the server write the request  \n&gt;&gt; to a database, send a 202 to the client and work the request later  \n&gt;&gt; on a different thread.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The constraint we have is that we are using Jersey and we need to  \n&gt;&gt; take advantage of the load balancing features provided by Apache and  \n&gt;&gt; Tomcat/Jetty, so we end up with a large number of long lasting  \n&gt;&gt; simultaneous connections.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Asynchronous&quot; approaches I have found are trying to solve a  \n&gt;&gt; different problem. Since a servlet is blocking, a request makes the  \n&gt;&gt; thread wait. The proposed solutions look to release threads back  \n&gt;&gt; into the pool and be made available for other requests not to keep  \n&gt;&gt; it running for a long time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How do you, in a RESTful way and using standard load balancing  \n&gt;&gt; techniques (i.e. those provided by Apache + Tomcat/Jetty), work  \n&gt;&gt; requests &quot;asynchronously&quot; so that you can release client connections?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; +Adolfo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
