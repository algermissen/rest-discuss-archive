For example, instead of having the client create an order and\nPOSTing it to the order container, the URI represents a resource that in\nfact creates the order and automatically sends it to the order-taker.\n\nI am starting to realize that this may be too much of a conceptual shift to\nkeep clean because people automatically think RPC when it comes to verbs.\nThere is a subtle but fine distinction between giving &quot;verbs&quot; URIs and doing\nRPC.  RPC requires a explicit binding process to work requiring that the\nparties agree on the parameters and procedure call.  Verb URIs do not\nrequire this type of tight coupling.\n\nGiving verbs URIs is still loose coupling.  It is as loose in coupling as\ncreating properties which has a set of acceptable values that you must set.\nUltimately, the two parties will still need to &quot;understand&quot; each other for\nthis to work, but this need for understanding is pushed out from the\nprotocol.  And it allows certain other types of application to manipulate\nthese URIs without that understanding (which RPC does not support).  This\nloose coupling will allow verb URIs to scale in ways that RPC can not.\n\n//Joe\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\nSent: Tuesday, June 18, 2002 10:10 AM\nTo: Philip Eskelin\nCc: Roger L.

Is there a more RESTful way to approach this example?\n\nYes.  What you and Joe have been discussing is not REST, it&#39;s RPC\nwith the method in the URI rather than in the body.\n\nWith REST, a common way of ordering a part would be by POSTing a\nrepresentation of that part to an order-taking container resource\nthat has previously advertised its role as an order-taker.  Your\napproach misses some critically important steps, such as the\naforementioned advertising of roles (the &quot;offer&quot; in &quot;offer-\nacceptance&quot;).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
