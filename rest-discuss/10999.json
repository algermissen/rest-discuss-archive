The fact that a\nRESTful web framework h=\r\nas to use conneg to determine what response\ncode to use is a symptom of som=\r\nething being broken. If a POST creates\na resource, shouldn&#39;t you be able to=\r\n return a 201, regardless of what\ntype of representation the client accepts=\r\n?\n\nI don&#39;t feel that this problem is specific to 201 either. The same\nappli=\r\nes to 200 (if I want to indicate that my POST did *not* create a\nnew resour=\r\nce). The root of the problem is that it has become\nbest-practice to always =\r\nreturn a 303 in response to a POST (when\nwriting an HTML application). Rath=\r\ner than using a response code that\nreflects the semantics of the outcome, t=\r\nhe preferred behavior is to\nredirect (via GET) to a URL in order to avoid a=\r\nll the pitfalls of\nhaving content in your POST response.\n\nEspecially if you=\r\n are using HTML w/ MicroFormats as your content type,\nwouldn&#39;t it be ideal =\r\nif your web site and your web service were one\nand the same? The redirect o=\r\nn POST best-practice seems to stand in the\nway of that.\n\nI believe that the=\r\n right &quot;fix&quot; here would either 1) resolve the\nbrowser problems that require=\r\n redirect on POST so that you are free to\nuse the response code that best m=\r\natches your semantics; or 2) allows a\n&quot;next&quot; URL to be communicated with an=\r\ny response to a POST/PUT/DELETE\nrequest.\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\n\n"}}
