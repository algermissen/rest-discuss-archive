Am I missing something? What do you think is strange\n&gt; &gt; about it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Just the concept that users assign awards.  I could understand if\n&gt; they voted for their favourite actor in each category based on\n&gt; nominations. Anyway, its not important to the real discussion...\n\nI see, just forget about the details of the application, they are pretty \ndumb anyway. The only purpose is for me to explore tools and techniques.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do that, Dave^H^Hrrel. The problem is that there\n&gt; &gt; are too many potential recipients. Say the user starts dragging a\n&gt; &gt; Best Actor in a Leading Role award. There are literally thousands\n&gt; &gt; of potential recipients and the choice is only restricted by what\n&gt; &gt; the client is currently displaying to the user. Thus, the client\n&gt; &gt; needs a way to ask the server which of these candidates really are\n&gt; &gt; hopefuls.\n&gt;\n&gt; So create a hierarchy.  The first representation returned could have\n&gt; 10 categories of recipients.  You render those categories on the\n&gt; client and, as the client hovers over the category, you do another\n&gt; request and drill down into that category and render the results.\n\nNow I can&#39;t follow. The problem is not that I still need to render \nanything. Everything already is rendered. The problem is about which \ninteractions between these things are possible and that depends on  \nstate only the server knows.\n\nA version of the same problem, simplified to the core, is this: There \nare 100 buttons on the screen each triggering a specific action (state \ntransition). Only some of these actions are really possible at any one \ntime and only the server knows which ones they are. Also, the server \ndoes not know what is shown on the screen. For a pleasant UI, I&#39;d like \nto enable only those buttons of which the server tells me that their \nassociated actions are most likely possible.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
