Once an item is\n&gt; bookmarked the user agent need not care about the actual composition\n&gt; of the URI - as long as it continues to resolve properly.\n\n+1. It is about being able to safely replay a given GET.\n\n&gt; Third, URI templating is also orthogonal to URI design. Sure, a sane\n&gt; design makes automating the generation of URIs easier to deal with,\n&gt; but that&#39;s as far as I see it going. A server-side URI generator that\n&gt; produces random numbers is no better/worse than one that goes to great\n&gt; pains to build a more complex URI that contains separators and the\n&gt; like - as long as it continues to resolve properly.\n\nRight. Bookmarking applies to URIs and not templates. Bookmarkable  \nURIs include root-level URIs applications may publish, and URIs found  \nlinks and Location headers. In a pure app-app to scenario, these are  \nthe URIs that client apps &quot;remember&quot; so that they can get back to a  \ngiven application state at a later time. T\n\n&gt; Fourth, resolving URIs properly is the work of the server and, while\n&gt; &quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot; [2], implementing a design that *requires*\n&gt; URIs never change is a (possibly fatal) self-inflicted wound. If the\n&gt; server finds a need to start generating different URIs for existing\n&gt; resources, it is the server&#39;s responsibility to deal with the &#39;old&#39;\n&gt; URIs that might still be out in the wild. URI rewriters are a\n&gt; wonderful thing. Also, there are many cases where bookmarked URIs\n&gt; should return 410 Gone. This is not a bad thing and should not be\n&gt; discouraged.\n\nWell said.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
