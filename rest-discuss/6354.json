These are  \n&gt;appended to the page, the scroll bar is adjusted to reflect the new  \n&gt;height of the page, and you can keep scrolling down for more. This is  \n&gt;in contrast to the traditional &quot;Page 2&quot; / &quot;See Next n Items&quot; method  \n&gt;of advancing the list.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s quite anti-REST, but it got me thinking about how the  \n&gt;traditional numbered-page method also breaks with REST. My feeling is  \n&gt;that the URL should point to a consistent resource, which changes in  \n&gt;a paged environment. Page 2 means one thing one day, something else  \n&gt;on another, depending on what new items have been added to the list  \n&gt;in the meantime.\n&gt;\n&gt;I can think of two ways to change this:\n&gt;\n&gt;Instead of using page numbers, use item identifiers. The permanent  \n&gt;URL for a set of items wouldn&#39;t change.\n&gt;\n&gt;Instead of numbering from the most recent, number from the oldest.  \n&gt;Page 1 will always have the same set of oldest items, while the page  \n&gt;number for the newest items will grow indefinitely. Of course this  \n&gt;only works if there is a clear beginning to things.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thoughts?\n&gt;-mike.\n&gt;\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;michal migurski- contact info and pgp key:\n&gt;sf/ca            http://mike.teczno.com/contact.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
