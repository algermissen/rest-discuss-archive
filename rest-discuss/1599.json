If you\ninvoke the verb, then it is RPC-ish.\nHey, having a resource which is a script on a server & doing a PUT to set\nits contents isn&#39;t &#39;wrong&#39;. Associating that script resource with a schedule\nor event via other HTTP methods isn&#39;t a bad idea - but I think to get the\nactual behavior specified by the script text to be performed, you will need\na different URI.\nOne URI for messages that act upon the content of the script and one URI for\nthe messages that the script acts upon.\n\nI know this isn&#39;t what you mean by a URI representing a verb, but that&#39;s as\nclose as I can get with REST.\n\n"}}
