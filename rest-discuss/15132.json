In REST, the application is\n&gt; defined as &quot;what the user is trying to accomplish&quot;, and the user&#39;s\n&gt; agent is the &quot;client&quot;.  The client never decides what to do next, only\n&gt; the user does.  The client is there to carry out the user&#39;s orders.\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;user&quot; of course, is not required to be human.  But, this thread is\n&gt; as clear as mud, because &quot;user&quot; and &quot;user-agent&quot; are being combined\n&gt; into &quot;client&quot;.  When I as a human am driving a REST application, I am\n&gt; not the &quot;client&quot; nor am I part of the &quot;client component&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nEric, I agree with, and like, your distinctions among &quot;application,&quot; &quot;user&quot;,\nand &quot;user agent&quot;. But what needs the terminology scrub is not just this\nthread, but (at least) the 5.3.3 Data\nView&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_3_3&gt;section\nof Roy&#39;s Thesis. Here is an example of what I mean:\n\nThe model application is therefore an engine that moves from one state to\nthe next by examining and choosing from among the alternative state\ntransitions in the current set of representations. Not surprisingly, this\nexactly matches the user interface of a hypermedia browser. However, the\nstyle does not assume that all applications are browsers. In fact, the\napplication details are hidden from the server by the generic connector\ninterface, and thus a user agent could equally be an automated robot\nperforming information retrieval for an indexing service, a personal agent\nlooking for data that matches certain criteria, or a maintenance spider busy\npatrolling the information for broken references or modified content\n[39&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/references.htm#ref_39&gt;\n].\n\n\nTwo observations:\n\n   1. Saying that a &quot;user agent&quot; can be a bot, a personal agent (presumably\n   an automated one, not a human one), or a spider suggests that Roy is NOT\n   making your distinction between user (human) and user agent (automaton).\n   2. Roy appears to use &quot;application&quot; in two different (inconsistent?)\n   ways. First, to refer to &quot;a cohesive structure of information and control\n   alternatives through which a user can perform a desired task&quot; (earlier in\n   section 5.3.3). Second, to refer to a software component. For example, &quot;does\n   not assume that all applications are browsers.&quot;\n\nI&#39;d be curious to know if you agree with my observations, and if so, would\nyou be willing to edit section 5.3.3 to clear up the confusion between user\nand user agent and between application as &quot;information and control\nalternatives&quot; vs application as informal expression for a software component\nsuch as a browser.\n\nThanks.\n\n-- Nick\n\r\n--001485f1e9665078ac04838d2f50\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Apr 5, 2010 at 2:24 AM, Eric J.
