Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt;:\n\n&gt; &gt; Yes. I&#39;m of the opinion that the main reason we use the word &quot;resource&quot;\n&gt; &gt; rather than the word &quot;thing&quot; is that using the former makes us seem a\n&gt; &gt; bit smarter than if we use the latter. However the nuances of &quot;thing&quot;\n&gt; &gt; are probably more apposite than the nuances of &quot;resource&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; We use the term resource because &quot;thing&quot; includes those that have yet\n&gt; to be named or described, and thus cannot be individually considered\n&gt; a resource by any system.\n\nCorrect in a spec or a paper, but correct in a tutorial?\n\nTo many people &quot;Resource&quot; implies ownership and belonging. To many others\n&quot;Resource&quot; implies membership of some sort of category. Hence we frequently get\ndiscussion of how &lt;http://example.net/Ireland&gt; could or could not be the same\nresource as &lt;http://example.org/Ireland&gt; when the former is &quot;owned&quot; by\nexample.net and the latter by example.org and talk of REST resources vs. RDF\nresources vs. OWL resources vs. DAML resources.\n\nSince generally people don&#39;t try to say anything about things they don&#39;t have an\nidentifier for I think &quot;thing&quot; has it&#39;s place in non-normative descriptions of\nresources (unless there are further ways in which thing is wrong).\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
