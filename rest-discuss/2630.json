A side-effect sounds more like a state\ntransition than a state designation, but I&#39;m sure Dr. Fielding\nmeant the latter, not the former.\n\nSaying that DELETE is idempotent with respect to the function\nthat maps the deleted resource&#39;s pre-DELETE state to its post-\nDELETE state is not implying anything about the response\ncode for the DELETE request-response.  Perhaps this should be\nspecified; perhaps it shouldn&#39;t.\n\nExciting news!  I just finished an extended design session with\nfour other developers in re-designing the web interface to the\nproject we&#39;re working on.  Several of them had epiphanies today\nin which they discovered the meaning (and coolness) of &quot;hypertext\nas the engine of application state&quot;.  Witnessing that was a\nterrific experience for me.  Made my week.  Our new design (2nd\ncut at hitting the REST mark) is quite good.\n\nMore exciting news!!  Roy is right.  Sequences of idempotent \noperations need not be idempotent.  I build an Alloy model tonight\n(finally) which demonstrates this.  I have a pdf which I&#39;ll post here \nas soon as I can find my way into a mail client.  So stay tuned...\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
