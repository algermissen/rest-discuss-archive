This query is not simple enough to put in the \nURI (too long, too complex,...)\n\nI&#39;ve been reading through previous messages on this mailing list and \nnoticed that this issue has been talked about multiple times here, but I \nstill haven&#39;t found a solution I&#39;m completely satisfied with.\n\nThese are the options I have gone through:\n\n1. GET with a body\n\nIsn&#39;t supported by application servers and proxy&#39;s.\n\n2. Assume the query, or the result of the query (doesn&#39;t really matter) \nto be a resource by itself, do a POST to create it. The resource is now \nremembered by the server and still accessible through a GET (maybe only \nfor a certain time).\n\nI don&#39;t like this option, because I didn&#39;t want to change the state of \nthe server, in fact I intrinsically just wanted to do some kind of a \nGET, which shouldn&#39;t change the state of the server.\n\n3. Overload POST, don&#39;t change the server&#39;s state by POSTing the query\n\nThis is the most practical solution that I can come up with, but it&#39;s \nnot really REST... The uniform interface is broken since I use POST \nalready for creating resources.\n\n\nI hope this opens the discussion again, I&#39;d really like to find a \nRESTful solution to this problem.\n\nThanks!\nBarbara\n\n"}}
