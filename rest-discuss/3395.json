Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Hey - I just found out there was a note back in 1999 about using HTML forms\n&gt; to do authentication.\n&gt; I haven&#39;t read it fully, but this is one of my pet peeves with HTTP and the\n&gt; &#39;visual Web&#39; - no visibility of security information in messages. (leading\n&gt; to sessions, cookies, wacky urls, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/NOTE-authentform-19990203\n&gt; \n&gt; [...]\n&gt; This proposal suggests extensions to HTML forms to overcome their present\n&gt; security problems by integrating them with HTTP (or other security sublayer)\n&gt; mechanisms. It calls for a new type of form; the AUTHFORM and new values for\n&gt; the TYPE attribute of the INPUT element and SELECT block.\n&gt; [...]\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking about this as well. I&#39;m due to give an\nevangelizing talk about REST for a client and I know that this is\ngoing to come up.\n\nMy experience of HTTP authentication is that the fixed user interface \nmakes it unpopular with users (or at least website designers) and that\nhas a knock on effect on the architecture of web services components\nbuilt as part of the same application.\n\n\nIt seems the ideas put forward in the link above were not\npopular. Adding stuff to HTML doesn&#39;t seem like the right thing to do\nanyway.\n\nI&#39;ve always wondered why an authentication response couldn&#39;t have an\nentity associated with it, either in the response body or referenced\nvia some content-location like header.\n\nIf it were possible to associate an entity with the authentication\nthen browsers could render it when they find it and use the standard\ndialog box when they don&#39;t.\n\nWould that sort of scheme violate REST principles in anyway?\n\n\nNic\n\n\n\n"}}
