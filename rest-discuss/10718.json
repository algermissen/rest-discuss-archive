For instance an issue cannot\nbe reopened if it is=\r\nn&#39;t resolved or closed. Furthermore, let&#39;s say I\nhave a resolved issue but =\r\nI&#39;m conducting a PUT with state =3D &quot;Open&quot;.\nThis is not allowed, unless I m=\r\nake my wrapper first reopen the issue,\nthen start progress, and then stop p=\r\nrogress again. I might just\nimplement this hack, but what I want to know is=\r\n how I should express\nthese workflow constraints RESTfully if i want to..\n\n=\r\nI figure one can use urls like: issues/open, issues/resolved etc.. But\nhow =\r\ndo I then move an open issue to /issues/resolved ? If I conduct a\nPOST to /=\r\nresolved I would create a new issues.. and that would be\nwrong? Furthermore=\r\n I would probably have to delete the issue from\n/open too? \n\nAny good ideas=\r\n / best practices? \n\n\n"}}
