E.g. when you decide to turn each &quot;customer&quot;  \n&gt;=\r\n into its own identifiable resource - http://example.com/customers/1234  \n&gt;=\r\n - what does http://example.com/customers/{id} describe? Both &quot;resource  \n&gt;=\r\n class&quot; and &quot;resource type&quot; would work, but don&#39;t seem really convincing.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n\nHi. I&#39;m r=\r\neposting this to the whole group.\n----\nHi Stefan.\n\nAs it has been said in t=\r\nhe long list of messages here, a resources is a typeless thing. The problem=\r\n I see implicit in the question, is the confusion of REST design with Domai=\r\nn design.\n\nThere is a mapping of domain objects or elements into resources,=\r\n which leads the designer to map properties of the elements to the resource=\r\ns, just like the class or type. That is not a good practice.\n\nFirst, URI de=\r\nfinition does not have to bear any semantic for the user! So, http://exampl=\r\ne.com/customers could not mean customers at all, and the client should not =\r\nbase its action on the customers word. It could be the same http://example.=\r\ncom/pas9132ad where pas9132ad means customers to the server.\n\nIn the same l=\r\nine, knowing you are accessing a resource is surely enough. There is not ne=\r\ned for the client to know that resource is a client, neither its type or cl=\r\nass in general. That type should be discovered, the same as the actions tha=\r\nt can be performed upon it.\n\nSo, how do you describe that in a design? Well=\r\n, the discussion may start by asking what a RESTfull design is! You can mod=\r\nel your inner systems as you like, you can have types, classes, and use any=\r\n other styles not REST for your applications. Then, you may want to go web,=\r\n and create a full architecture in top of all those little systems. You the=\r\nn simply define resources (typeless) and then the operations upon them, and=\r\n the way all that is discovered. See? I see no type thinking there.\nSame if=\r\n your application is architected using REST. Then, your components are the =\r\nREST components, and the resources definition and operations is a lower lev=\r\nel (tactic design) process, not at architecture level, and thus not a REST =\r\nlevel-\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n\n"}}
