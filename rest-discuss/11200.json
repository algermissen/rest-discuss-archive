Be that =\r\nas it may, I take your point.\n\n&gt; Could you highlight where the specificatio=\r\nn, which allows delegation of semantics of reserved characters to the deref=\r\nerencing algorithms, talks about syntax?\n\nMost of RFC 3986 is about syntax.=\r\n I don&#39;t want to start collecting\nphrase after phrase as evidence. If you r=\r\neally want that I do so, please\nask; if I have time and energy, I&#39;ll begin =\r\non that effort.\n\n&gt; Again, the [RFC mentions] that those reserved characters=\r\n MAY be used as delimiters, either by the dereferencing algorithm or the sc=\r\nheme.\n\nWhich characters do you mean by &quot;those reserved characters&quot;? The squ=\r\nare\nbrackets (U+005B, U+005D) are reserved by RFC 3986 for exactly one\nusag=\r\ne, and that usage involves the &quot;host&quot; subcomponent, not the &quot;path&quot;\ncomponen=\r\nt. The curly brackets (U+007B, U+007D) are not allowed at all in\na URI; the=\r\ny are neither reserved nor unreserved.\n\n&gt; I won&#39;t get into the debate of [w=\r\nhether &quot;http&quot; URIs are URLs or URNs], so will give you that one.\n\nYou misse=\r\nd my point. We are discussing URIs in general, not &quot;http&quot; URIs.\nI was tryin=\r\ng to stick to the jargon of RFC 3986, using &quot;URI&quot; instead of\n&quot;valid delimit=\r\ned [URL]&quot;, because I know what a URI is and don&#39;t really\nknow what &quot;valid d=\r\nelimited URL&quot; means. If &quot;URI&quot; and &quot;valid delimited\nURL&quot; are not equivalent,=\r\n please tell me. What do you mean by &quot;valid&quot;?\nDoes your notion of validity =\r\nallow for &quot;http:bork&quot; (which is a URI but\nis contrary to the definition of =\r\nthe scheme that the URI uses)? Does\nyour notion of validity allow for &quot;http=\r\n://mistake.invalid./&quot; (which is a\nURI that adheres to scheme-specific synta=\r\nx but does not identify a\ndeployed host)? What do you mean by &quot;delimited&quot;?\n=\r\n\n&gt; For your other points, [except] for you highlighting the [RFC &quot;reserved&quot;=\r\n] delimiters that are not used in [the &quot;http&quot; URI scheme], I don&#39;t see wher=\r\ne your point is[.]\n\nI didn&#39;t address the &quot;http&quot; scheme except insofar as it=\r\n is a URI scheme\nlike all other URI schemes. And, for what it&#39;s worth, the =\r\n&quot;http&quot; URI\nscheme allows for URIs that include all of the characters in the=\r\n\n&quot;reserved&quot; set: &quot;http://[::127.0.0.1]/?@!$&&#39;()*+,;=3D#&quot;.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d really lik=\r\ne for you to expand on your claims.\n\nURIs cannot include U+003C, U+003E, U+=\r\n007B, or U+007D. URIs can include\nU+005B and U+005D only as proper prefix a=\r\nnd proper suffix, respectively,\nin IP-literals in the &quot;host&quot; subcomponent o=\r\nf the &quot;authority&quot; component.\nThat is the sum total of what I was originally=\r\n trying to say.\n\n&gt; Are you considering that the dereferencing algorithm is =\r\n*not* a subordinate of the scheme, and that as such any reserved character =\r\nin URIs that is not used by the scheme [has] to stay reserved for some reas=\r\non I missed?\n\nIn my message, I was neither presuming that premise nor drawi=\r\nng that\nconclusion.\n\nThe simple fact remains that some characters cannot ap=\r\npear in URIs and\nother characters may appear in URIs only in certain positi=\r\nons.\n\n-- \nPlease do not include my address in public replies. I will read p=\r\nublic\nreplies on the list.\n\n\n"}}
