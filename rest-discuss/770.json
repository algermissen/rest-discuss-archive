I was working on something similar a few months ago\n&gt; but lost momentum on it. Here&#39;s the thoughts that I had while reading your\n&gt; proposal.\n\nThanks!\n\n&gt; Can we see a full WRDL document as an example? An XML Schema would be nice,\n&gt; too.\n\nWill do. But someday...\n\n&gt; Will there be a way to bind URIs to resourceTypes in WRDL? Or are you not\n&gt; going down the route to avoid what WSDL has become? I can definitely see the\n&gt; benefits to NOT hardcoding a specific WRDL file to one set of URIs.\n\nYeah, I don&#39;t know if I see the advantage. I do think it might be neat\nif there were an HTTP \n\n&gt; Is WRDL strictly limited to sending and receving XML documents? \n\nNo. It&#39;s just that it can only extract hyperlinks from XML. And of\ncourse XHTML....\n\n&gt; ... I can\n&gt; understand reducing scope if it is. However, it might be very useful to\n&gt; allow for form-data inputs. I&#39;d like to be able to do a GET on a resource\n&gt; that returns an HTML form so that I could do a POST interactively or (using\n&gt; WRDL) programmatically. Of course, if I was using WRDL, I wouldn&#39;t need to\n&gt; GET the resource for the HTML form.\n\nRight. So I&#39;m not sure what you are asking for or if you are just\nthinking aloud. WRDL is for a client of the service figuring out its\nbehaviour in advance. HTML form parameters are not necessary because the\nservice description has the parameters in it.\n\n&gt; For uniformity, extra headers, query parameters, and form-data variables (if\n&gt; supported) should always be allowed.\n\nform-data variables are query parameters.\n\n&gt; Should we leverage XML Schema datatypes for the types of inputs? Do types\n&gt; default to strings if unspecified?\n\nYes and yes.\n\n&gt; Not all languages support default values for parameters. \n\nIn some sense they all do. Remember that you will probably be generating\na client library so the generated library can fill in the default\nvalues.\n\n&gt; ... Do we really need\n&gt; default and fixed? If it&#39;s fixed, why would it be an input? XML has a case\n&gt; for it but I&#39;m does WRDL?\n\nI just wanted to be the same as XML Schema. I think the case is about as\nstrong or weak (both) as XML. You could define a WRDL for a service you\ndidn&#39;t control in order to generate a client library. Maybe you want to\nhard-code a parameter. Not a majorly useful feature but not in XML\neither...\n\n&gt; Will there be a way to define input-sets (like XSLT&#39;s attribute-sets)?\n\nMaybe. Have to see if there is a need for it.\n\n&gt; &lt;input-set name=&quot;my-input-set&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;query name=&quot;my-int-query&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;header name=&quot;my-string-header type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/input-set&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;method name=&quot;GET&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;input use-input-sets=&quot;my-input-set&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/method&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If we allow something like input-sets, maybe instead of a representations\n&gt; attribute on the input element, there should be a body element (as a child\n&gt; of input) with a representations attribute just for uniformity.\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt; Will there me any sort of support for modularity? wrdl:include?\n\nYes, certainly.\n\n&gt; You have a creates attributes on a POST method and also a\n&gt; created/@representations child element but only mention the creates\n&gt; attribute. Is there supposed to be only one of them?\n\nYeah...but I don&#39;t remember which right now. You pick. ;)\n\n&gt; Is it representation or representationType? You have some representationType\n&gt; elements with match attributes (instead of test).\n\nI went back and forth on that one....representationType I guess.\n\n&gt; Should we be able to specify an XML Schema for a representationType?\n\nMaybe you should be able to specify arbitrary extra validation\ninformation.\n\n&gt; I think that you&#39;re trying to do too much with simple binding references.\n&gt; Why not leverage some other specification? I think I would actually prefer\n&gt; WRDL to stay simple and not specify any binding mechanism at all. Binding to\n&gt; an XML document should be orthogonal to how you received it. Having said\n&gt; that, I have a few comments on references as they are written.\n\nReally the question isn&#39;t binding to the XML document but binding to the\n*resource*. Subtle but important difference. Note that hyperlinks in\nWRDL are from resourceTypes to resourceTypes. A pure XML binding\nlanguage would go from XML elements to XML elements.\n\n&gt; If reference/@name is optional, how would you refer to it? Your sample API\n&gt; looks like the reference name gets converted into a method name. I think it\n&gt; should be required.\n\nMaybe that&#39;s just something you couldn&#39;t refer to. I could go eithre\nway.\n\n&gt; reference/@match should is closer to XSLT&#39;s xsl:value-of/@select attribute\n&gt; than xsl:template/@match. match attributes are restricted to a subset of\n&gt; XPath that can only evaluate to node sets.\n\nIsn&#39;t that what I want? I want to get a node set representing a set of\nnodes to annotate.\n\n&gt; Speaking of node sets, what if your reference&#39;s match (or select) attribute\n&gt; evaluates a node set? Does it return an array? Only if maxOccurs is greater\n&gt; than 1? \n\nYeah, that&#39;s actually why I added the concept of maxOccurs.\n\n&gt; ... These are the types of questions that I believe shouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; answered by WRDL.\n\nBut they are. ;)\n\n&gt; Should WRDL support HTTPEvents so that languages that support events can\n&gt; seamlessly subscribe to them? Or is that too SOAP-ish?\n\nYes, WRDL should support subscription to HttpEvents. The client binding\nmay or may not help you to actually respond to events.\n\n&gt; I hope this helps. I&#39;ll be glad to work on an implementation as it gets\n&gt; hammered out.\n\nGreat!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
