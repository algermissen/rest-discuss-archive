I have limited time to write, but I wanted to send out\nsome comments and my latest thinking (influenced heavily by your\ncomments)\n\n1. Mike suggested that a Web service should treat visual clients (i.e.,\na client sitting at a browser) different from automation clients (i.e.,\na client that is a program - no eyes involved).  Mike may be right, but\nI hope not.  My vision is an HTML-less Web.  I envision a Web in which\nthe only documents flying across the Web are semantic-rich XML\ndocuments.  If the consumer of one of those XML documents happens to be\na visual client then automatically the client&#39;s browser fetches the XSLT\nstylesheet and produces a nice visual rendition of the XML data.  If the\nconsumer is a machine, then the raw XML is just fine.\n\n2. Seairth made a very nice exchange protocol.  However, there are\nseveral things that bother me about that:\n\na. Seairth wrote in his initial message:\n\n&gt; [The first thing that happens is] CompanyA creates a PO in their system.\n\nBut wait, if I am the client and I am sitting at a browser I don&#39;t want\nto create a PO from scratch.  I want CompanyB to provide me a nice order\nform to fill out.\n\nb. The second objection I have is that CompanyA needs a Web server (or\naccess to some Web server).  The typical client isn&#39;t going to know what\na web server is, let alone how to stand one up, and put the PO into the\ncorrect location on the server.  \n\nc. I don&#39;t agree with calling it a purchase order on the CompanyA side\nand a sales order on the CompanyB side.  In my business, when a client\nsends me a purchase order I still call it a purchase order.  How I treat\nthe PO may be different than how the client treats the PO.  But I still\ncall it a PO.\n\nSeairth&#39;s approach may be the correct REST one but I would like\nsomething more applicable to the masses.  Here&#39;s the idea that is\ncurrently brewing in my head:\n\nA client (the client could be a visual or automation client) is\ninterested in purchasing something from CompanyB.  So, the client\nrequests an &lt;&lt;order form&gt;&gt; by issuing this GET:\n\n    http://www.CompanyB.com/orderForm ------&gt;\n\nPrior to giving the client an orderForm CompanyB requests\nidentification, so it responds with a login form, loginForm.xml\n\n   &lt;----------------  loginForm.xml\n\n(Note, for visual clients the browser will automatically grab the XSLT\nstylesheet that the XML document references and provide a nice visual\nrendition of the login form, i.e., a login screen)\n\nThe loginForm.xml specifies what data the client must provide to create\nan idCard.xml.  The client thus returns idCard.xml to CompanyB:\n\n   ------------------&gt; idCard.xml\n\n(Note, for visual clients idCard.xml is automatically generated using,\nsay, JavaScript, from the info that the user enters at the browser)\n\nNow CompanyB gives the client the order form.  However, the order form\nhas a customized return address (based upon data in idCard.xml)\n\n   &lt;------------------- orderForm.xml (with customized return address)\n\nThe orderForm.xml describes what data the client must provide in his\nPO.  For example, it tells the client that he must provide the ID of\neach part desired and the quantity desired, and he must provide credit\ncard info - type of card, card number, expiry date.  [This is quite\ninteresting - the data in orderForm.xml is data about the data (i.e.,\nmetadata) that must be provided in the PO.  Likewise for loginForm.xml\nabove.]  The client constructs a PO using the info in orderForm.xml. \nThe client submits (PUTs) the completed PO to the URL provided in\norderForm.xml:\n\n   PO.xml ----&gt; http://www.CompanyB.com/PurchaseOrders/costello --&gt;\n\n{Note, for visual clients the XSLT stylesheet provides a nice form that\nthe client simply fills in.  When the client hits Submit some Javascript\ncode harvests all the data that the user entered and constructs PO.xml)\n\nI hope this makes sense.  I apologize for not writing more explicitly. \nHopefully, you can get the gist of what I am saying.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
