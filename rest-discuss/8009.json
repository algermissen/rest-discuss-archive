I think this is pos=\r\nitive to see\nnew RESTful frameworks in the Java world, as long as they brin=\r\ng in new\nideas or better designs. This is a sign of vitality and it should\n=\r\nprobably only help to broaden the adoption of REST ideas. \n\nI don&#39;t see any=\r\n interoperability issue as long as we all agree on\nusing HTTP 1.1, standard=\r\n URIs, and don&#39;t force on users specific\nformats/media types for resource r=\r\nepresentations.\n\nConcerning portability from one framework to another, ther=\r\ne is a risk\nof lock-in and also a need for experimentation. This is why we =\r\nall\nneed to support standard APIs like JSR-311 (Annotations for RESTful\nWeb=\r\n Services). \n\nThe Restlet framework [1] has a separation between the Restle=\r\nt API and\nthe reference implementation (Noelios Restlet Engine). This means=\r\n that\nwe are encouraging alternative implementations of the API, that I\nwou=\r\nld like to submit to the JCP in 2008 or later this year. \n\nThe approach of =\r\nJSR-311 should be complimentary to the Restlet\napproach [2]. The JSR-311 ci=\r\ntes some potential supporting technologies\nlike Servlets and JAX-WS. The Re=\r\nstlet API will also be a very natural\nfoundation. There could be an opportu=\r\nnity for integration between\nRESTEasy and Restlets based on JSR-311. \n\nI&#39;m =\r\nalso planning to experiment with annotations during the work of\nthe JSR-311=\r\n expert group and to add support for them in a later\nrelease of Restlets. F=\r\nor now, we are focusing on releasing the final\n1.0 version, with a new Web =\r\nsite and a professional support.\n\nAll the best,\nJerome \n\n[1] http://www.res=\r\ntlet.org\n[2] http://blog.noelios.com/2007/02/14/\n\n\n\n"}}
