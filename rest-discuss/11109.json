Other\n&gt;&gt; than the early blogging APIs being based on XML-RPC and eventually\n&gt;&gt; evolving into AtomPub I don&#39;t really know why forms with well-known\n&gt;&gt; query params aren&#39;t a a de-facto standard.\n\nhere&#39;s that 15-minute exercise:\nhttp://blog.labnotes.org/2007/08/16/the-simple-publishing-protocol/\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Because forms are expressed using HTML, and HTML deals with\n&gt; presentation and content, which is clearly different from what APIs\n&gt; are about.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, before we discuss how well in holds, this wasn&#39;t a statement but\n&gt; an attempt to summarize in one line the gist of the reactions I got\n&gt; when suggesting that people just use forms.  There are obviously some\n&gt; limitations to current specifications, HTML 4 not the most capable\n&gt; form language, but even for use cases which it does very well, that\n&gt; was pretty much the knee jerk reaction I always received.\n&gt;\n&gt; I once illustrated how easily you can use forms to update a blog post\n&gt; by using curl instead of a Web browser.  The query parameters are\n&gt; actually common enough that the same code would work on different\n&gt; blogs, at least the two I tested with (WP and Blogger).  I got sent to\n&gt; look at AtomPub and XML-RPC, because regardless of how many posts I\n&gt; created that way (around a thousand), forms are apparently unable to\n&gt; scale to the grueling demands presented by APIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it&#39;s mostly -- again, speaking of cases where forms are\n&gt; successfully used -- a matter of perception.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assaf\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
