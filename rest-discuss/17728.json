I recently read Roy&#39;s dissertation and blogged my interpretation=\r\n of it.\n\nI saw that yesterday - looks like you picked a good start and had =\r\npeople pointing you in the right directions and to the right resources.\n\nRe=\r\ngarding the Twitter example: The important thing that is missing from the T=\r\nwitter API is the definition and the use of a media type that would make th=\r\ne message self describing. Without that, the client needs to rely on out-of=\r\n-band knowledge about the format that Twitter will send[1]. Effectively, yo=\r\nu need to bake this Twitter-specific knowledge into the client side code. T=\r\nhat&#39;s the coupling the hypermedia constraint aims to remove.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m alwa=\r\nys striving to learn and improve and I would appreciate getting this lists =\r\nexpertise feedback on my post.\n&gt; \n\nYou might find the document at [1] helpf=\r\nul when comparing RESTfulness of APIs.\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://www.nordsc.com/ext/=\r\nclassification_of_http_based_apis.html#http-type-one\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; You can find it=\r\n here:\n&gt; http://kellabyte.com/2011/09/04/clarifying-rest/\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks so mu=\r\nch in advance!\n&gt; Kelly Sommers\n&gt; \n&gt; Blog: http://kellabyte.com\n&gt; Twitter: h=\r\nttp://twitter.com/kellabyte\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
