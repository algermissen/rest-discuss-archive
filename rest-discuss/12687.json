If you have a media type,\nyou impement that media type from the spec (or codegen some of it through\nxsd or however you want to model the representation). You still have to\nimplement how the agent will present links and transitions to the users.\n\nWhat&#39;s the use case for WADL? Human documentation can be served using xhtml\njust as well. Tool automation, beyond generating xsd-based classes and\nentrypoint discovery (and the latter is a chicken and egg problem, you still\nneed to discover the wadl file), cannot be done unless you standardise\nlinks. And even then, i&#39;d argue that it hasn&#39;t bought you much: retrieve a\ndocument, modify it, discover the link to update it and you still need a way\nto display that link to the user.\n\nUnless you want to standardise how the link itself is displayed, which is\nwhat html does. In which case you don&#39;t really need WADL to do that: your\nmedia type can define this.\n\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing the point, but i&#39;ve almost killed the wadl\nimplementation in OpenRasta because I couldn&#39;t justify the use case. I have\nkept it for only one scenario, a non-restful one: being able to use the list\nof all possible URIs, and together with data ranges pulled from an external\nsource, hit the server with test scenarios and their expected outcomes. It\nis however mostly a CI / test scenario, and as such probably shouldn&#39;t ever\nbe made public. \n\nSeb\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Craig McClanahan\nSent: 21 May 2009 15:42\nTo: Bill Burke\nCc: REST-Discuss Discussion Group\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] To wadl or not to wadl\n\nOn Thu, May 21, 2009 at 5:55 AM, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just put some of my thoughts together on the subject:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com/2009/05/21/to-wadl-or-not-to-wadl/\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt;\n\n(Also replied on your blog, awaiting moderation)\n\nI happen to have asked Marc Hadley (JAX-RS spec lead, author of the\nWADL spec) about how WADL might be used to describe a REST service\ndriven by self-discovered embedded links, rather than by URI template\npatterns.
