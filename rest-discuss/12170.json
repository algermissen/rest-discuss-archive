That&#39;s level of\ndiscoverability that I&#39;ve only heard about discussed in WS-* systems, but\nhave never seen in practice.  Web sites and other human consumable\napplications can fulfill this requirement because they have the ultimate\n&quot;discovery engine&quot; we know of as an implicit part of the &quot;system,&quot; namely\nthe human brain (or human mind if you&#39;d like to be philosophical about it).\n\nThe system-to-system interaction that I know about generally require a some\nlevel of coupling that make discoverability a much more complex issue.  The\ntechniques with which I am familiar almost seem inadequate to the task.  Roy\nrecently said on rest-discuss:\n\nA lot of people think of systems as static things. Dead things.  REST is not\ngoing to appeal to those people. All of its constraints are designed to keep\nsystems living longer than we are willing or able to anticipate.\n\nPerhaps I&#39;m simply not familiar with the fitting techniques and technologies\nto create more life-like systems.  Do you know of any APIs that implements a\nfew features and are used in system-to-system that fully embrace the REST\nhypertext constraints?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nSolomon Duskis\n**\n\r\n--0015175d6708f66d9604642a12a6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nAre there any multi function, data oriented APIs out there that fully embra=\r\nce Roy Fielding hypertext constraints - &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://roy.gbiv.com/unta=\r\nngled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://roy=\r\n.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nI&#39;m still a bit fuzzy on the last point he makes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\nmargin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge be=\r\nyond the initial URI (bookmark)... &lt;i&gt;Failure here implies that out-of-band=\r\n information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ni&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;I have a few ideas, but no concrete examples of driving system-to=\r\n-system data-oriented &quot;services&quot; through in-band information.=A0 =\r\nThat&#39;s level of discoverability that I&#39;ve only heard about discusse=\r\nd in WS-* systems, but have never seen in practice.=A0 Web sites and other =\r\nhuman consumable applications can fulfill this requirement because they hav=\r\ne the ultimate &quot;discovery engine&quot; we know of as an implicit part =\r\nof the &quot;system,&quot; namely the human brain (or human mind if you&#39=\r\n;d like to be philosophical about it).&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The system-to-system inter=\r\naction that I know about generally require a some level of coupling that ma=\r\nke discoverability a much more complex issue.=A0 The techniques with which =\r\nI am familiar almost seem inadequate to the task.=A0 Roy recently said on r=\r\nest-discuss:&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;A lot of people th=\r\nink of systems as static things.
