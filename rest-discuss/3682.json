I&#39;m wondering if \nanybody&#39;s got preferred formats / standards / conventions for how to \ndescribe:\n\nthe set of resources that are available\ni.e. the permutations of URIs that are allowed / meaningful\nthe set of methods each one takes\nfor POST and PUT, the formats and constraints of allowed input\ndescriptions of representations / result codes returned by each method \n/ input permutation per resource\n\nLove to see what people are doing in this sense.  I would hazard an \nintuitive guess that a lack of even a semi-formal set of conventions \nfor declaratively describing / documenting resource models is one of \nthe main sources of friction that we (the REST community) experience in \ntrying to communicate with the unenlightened. ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
