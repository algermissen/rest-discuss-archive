Better would be &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot;. 8-)\n\n&gt; I fear MIME type pollution. I also fear lots of application level sniffing\n&gt; of types. If anyone&#39;s got some experience or opinion on the matter, I&#39;d\n&gt; appreciate hearing pros and cons.\n\nThe issue is that XML by itself doesn&#39;t provide a sufficiently rich\nframework that would allow one to solve the &quot;media type explosion&quot;\nproblem.  RDF/XML is one such &quot;better XML&quot; which attempts to solve that\nproblem, but lots of folks don&#39;t like the tradeoffs it seems.  The work\nwe&#39;re doing in the W3C Compound Document Formats WG is another stab at\ndoing a similar thing.\n\nUnfortunately, content sniffing (and assuming the root XML namespace\nreplaces the need for a media type) for XML for the generic XML media\ntypes is pretty much pervasive, at least in browsers[1].  A lot of XML\ncontent also uses the generic types, from what I&#39;ve seen, though lots\nof &quot;+xml&quot; media types are being registered which is good.\n\n [1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2004/01/XmlDispatchTest/\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
