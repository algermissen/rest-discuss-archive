It is ok if the\n&gt; &gt; media type is only standard in you or=\r\nganisation.

Loo=\r\nk at the work involved in\n&gt; mapping gdata/activitystreams/odata into Atom o=\r\nr microformats/rdfa into\n&gt; HTML. Those are global/community efforts that dw=\r\narf the caabilities of a\n&gt; time-constrained business that needs to solve it=\r\ns problem rather than\n&gt; its industry&#39;s problem. \n\nAgreed.  &quot;Semantic tunnel=\r\nling&quot; is a good phrase.  The benefits, in the case of Atom/AtomPub include =\r\nviewing in feed reader, validating w/ feed validator, and testing w/ Tim Br=\r\nay&#39;s APE. But often individual implementations became Frankensteins of add-=\r\nons, etc. for which those benefits are not really significant (or just don&#39;=\r\nt work). I still think the process of developing Atom/AtomPub was a hugely =\r\nuseful exercise, many of the lessons of which are applicable elsewhere. (Gi=\r\nve me the AtomPub spec over any API docs I&#39;ve ever seen any day).\n\nTo say &quot;=\r\nuse Atom or HTML&quot; is getting to sound pedantic to me.  &quot;Modeling&quot; my resour=\r\nces into one of those two if rife w/ challenges & pitfalls.  And heretical =\r\nas it sounds, what is the real value of a shared media type?  To me, it&#39;s t=\r\nhe definition of link semantics (the protocol, e.g. HTTP defines the unifor=\r\nm interface).  Perhaps we don&#39;t need a Web Application Description Language=\r\n, we need a &quot;Media Type Description Language&quot; or even a &quot;link semantics&quot; la=\r\nnguage (how to indentify links and their &quot;relations&quot; in the representation)=\r\n. \n\nI&#39;m convinced that there is another highly useful, broadly applicable m=\r\nedia type (or media meta-type) waiting to emerge alongside HTML.  And it is=\r\n going to look a lot like JSON.  How we get link semantics defined is an im=\r\nportant consideration. \n\n--peter keane\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What would be &#39;wrong&#39; with wi=\r\nth having a link to WADL in your media\n&gt; type? Until such a time as the RDF=\r\n singularity that is, although frankly\n&gt; TDF looks more and more like a bet=\r\nter option than blocking the\n&gt; &#39;applications&#39; and the &#39;service under develo=\r\npment&#39; on some non-existent\n&gt; &#39;standard&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
