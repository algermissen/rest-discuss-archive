Each one (where one exists) describes a\nprocessing model that was approved by IANA at one time or another, as\nbeing exactly what is meant by &quot;media type&quot;.  The demo I posted uses a\ndozen different media types.  Reading all those documents takes a day,\nbut provides much enlightenment on approved media type design.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Back to the question at hand, I find myself struggling with what I\n&gt; lose if the type is not registered. Saying it must be registered\n&gt; implies some big loss. For a proprietary system where I control who\n&gt; the clients are, or I use code on-demand to deploy the user-agent\n&gt; code, why do I care if the type is registered or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you point out exactly what I lose in such a system if I don&#39;t\n&gt; register it.\n&gt; \n\nNo, I can&#39;t, only the system designer is in a position to judge what&#39;s\nbest for the system being designed.  I can point out that you&#39;re asking\nthe wrong question, though...  the proper questions are what properties\nare you seeking to induce, and what constraints do you apply to achieve\nthose properties?  From REST Chapter 6.5:\n\n&quot;Why is this important?  Because it differentiates a system where\nnetwork intermediaries can be effective agents from a system where they\ncan be, at most, routers.&quot;\n\nIf you honestly don&#39;t care about traversing network boundaries, or re-\nuse by intermediaries if you do, then I can think of at least three\nREST constraints off the top of my head which are irrelevant to your\nneeds -- IOW, why choose REST as an architectural style if it&#39;s\nfundamentally inappropriate to your design goals?\n\nEveryone keeps asking if it&#39;s OK to ignore the uniform interface in\nsituations where the uniform interface is irrelevant to their needs...\nsure, just don&#39;t call the result REST, or obsess over it not being REST.\n\nThe first three chapters of Roy&#39;s thesis lay out a terminology and a\nrationale for deriving networked application architectures (including\nbut not limited to hypermedia applications).  The next two chapters lay\nout the design concerns of the REST style, and the methodology used to\nderive it based on the terminology and rationale from Chapters 1-3.\n\nIf your concerns are different, then following Roy&#39;s methodology won&#39;t\nlead you to REST, but to some other style -- all that matters is that it\nleads you to an architectural style that&#39;s appropriate for your system.\nYou can name it whatever you want, because an architectural style is\nreally just a named set of interdependent constraints -- which is why\nomitting any constraint results in a different style.\n\nStart with the null style (as described in Chapter 5).  Apply the subset\nof architectural constraints which result in the properties you seek to\ninduce (as described in Chapter 3).  Ignore the subset of architectural\nconstraints whose properties don&#39;t advance you to your goal.  The result\nis an architectural style appropriate to serve as a design guideline\nwhen modeling and implementing your system.\n\nIf that style doesn&#39;t require media types, so be it, but the REST style\nsure does -- most intermediaries only care about a limited subset of\nmedia types (meaning registered).  Which is why self-descriptive\nmessaging is essential to the REST style -- it allows traversing of\nnetwork boundaries (not guaranteed without using media types, could be\nseen as tunneling) while enabling intermediaries to act as intelligent\nagents (participate in the communication beyond being routers).\n\nSaying you don&#39;t care about those properties, means you have no need\nfor the full set of REST constraints, means you have some other set of\nconstraints, which isn&#39;t the same set of constraints defined by the term\nREST.  Which is not to say you shouldn&#39;t follow Roy&#39;s thesis, only that\nyou can&#39;t *expect* that methodology to result in the same architectural\nstyle Roy defines for purposes you state aren&#39;t relevant to your\nsystem&#39;s needs, anyway...\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
