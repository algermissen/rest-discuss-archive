If there is &#39;public relevance&#39; in your use case, your\n&gt; new type might even become a standard type. IOW, don&#39;t be afraid to\n&gt; ceate a new type if you have to (but think long and hard if you really\n&gt; have to :-)\n\nDoes it make any sense to qualify the link with the verb and the data type?\n\nA client doesn&#39;t need to know the content type of a GET, as it can ask\nfor what it wants.\n\nBut do you think for a PUT or POST, the data type can (should?) be\nreferenced in the link?\n\nThe Atom link can look like:\n&lt;link href=&quot;http://example.com/resource&quot; rel=&quot;create&quot; type=&quot;xml/ubl-invoice&quot;/&gt;\n\nI guess the media types for both POST and PUT should ideally be the\nsame, as they&#39;re typically closely related. I was just thinking if\nthey were different, how would you best communicate that to a client.\n\nAnd it&#39;s up to the standard interface, to know what you can do with\nthat media type at that link.\n\nI don&#39;t see how you could simply have &quot;xml/application&quot; as a media\ntype for most cases, especially for creating or changing resources.\nIt&#39;s just too generic.\n\nI suppose it&#39;s up to the client to &quot;know&quot; what schema\n&quot;xml/ubl-invoice&quot; is, through some internal mapping. Or, the service\ncan post a resource that provides the mapping.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
