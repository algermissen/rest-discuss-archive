For example,\nsel=\r\nected users (admins) might see diff inputs than others (guests).\nDuring cer=\r\ntain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does\nsupport writes) inp=\r\nuts could simply be removed from forms for a time.\nWorkflows could be alter=\r\ned to move inputs from one form to another;\nindicating when selected data e=\r\nlements are valid.\n\nAll of the variances I&#39;ve listed here work with a &quot;fixe=\r\nd&quot; set of\ninputs (or app-level vocabulary); IOW, there is no need to introd=\r\nuce\nbrand new input &quot;names&quot; That means the set of variances I&#39;ve defined\nwo=\r\nrk w/ user-agents there there is not human directly driving the\ninteraction=\r\ns (i.e. M2M cases).\n\nIf you add a human at runtime (i.e. H2M cases), you no=\r\nw have the\npossibility of introducing entirely new inputs (i.e expanding th=\r\ne\napp-level vocabulary) and continuing to evolve the app.\n\nIn fact, as Jon =\r\nMoore (I think it was him) has pointed out, as long as\nyou code an M2M user=\r\n-agent to treat all &quot;unknown&quot; input elements as\n&quot;pass through&quot; (i.e. contin=\r\nue to include them in URI templates\n(HTML.FORM@method=3D&quot;get&quot;) and body tem=\r\nplates (HTML.FORM@method=3D&quot;post&quot;)\nAND provide defaults for these brand-new=\r\n input elements, then even M2M\nuse cases support evolution over time that i=\r\nncludes &quot;unknown&quot; inputs.\n\nAre there other features you have in mind that h=\r\nave not been included here?\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-input-elem=\r\nent.html\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://ma=\r\nmund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Jor=\r\nn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt;\nDate: Fri, Jan 27, 2012 at 05:21\nSubject: Re: =\r\nWhat does a form tell my program?\nTo: mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt; =\r\nwhat is it about those other things (ops, encoding, URL) that\n&gt; remains &quot;us=\r\neful&#39; at runtime?\n\nAt runtime I can read action=3D&quot;{url}&quot; and method=3D&quot;{me=\r\nthod}&quot; from the\n&lt;form ...&gt; tag. From that my program can decide what the se=\r\nrver wants\nit to do. No need for a hard coded &quot;post here&quot; URL in my client.=\r\n So\nthese elements are &quot;useful&quot; at runtime because it makes it possible\nfor=\r\n the server to influence the client&#39;s behavior.\n\nBut I cannot see how tags =\r\nlike &lt;input name=3D&quot;{name}&quot;/&gt; can change be\nclient&#39;s behavior at runtime. T=\r\nhe client must have hard coded\nknowledge of &quot;{name}&quot; - it cannot discover w=\r\nhat &quot;{name}&quot; is at\nruntime. So, at compile time, the developer reads the fo=\r\nrm, and using\nhis eyes and brain, decides what input tag is used for someth=\r\ning. Then\nhe hard codes &quot;{name}&quot; into his client.\n\nSo, can the client disco=\r\nver something useful from &lt;input\nname=3D&quot;{name}&quot;/&gt; at runtime?\n\nDid that ex=\r\nplain it?\n\nWhile writing this I was reminded of default values in &lt;input&gt; t=\r\nags.\nSo, one useful, discoverable, feature of a input definition, is the\nde=\r\nfault value for that input. And hidden inputs adds other extra\nvalues that =\r\nthe client need not know about. More?\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n"}}
