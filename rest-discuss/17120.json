In most of =\r\nthe discussions, it is taken for granted that WSDL is simply wrong. In othe=\r\nrs, as you mention, it is depicted as non RESTful because actual implementa=\r\ntions are static binding, build time code generation things. Totally agree,=\r\n just that WSDL implementation may not be what was intended.\n\nSee, if we ar=\r\ne able to hit a URL looking for data about how to continue my flow, I can h=\r\nave many resources that can help me. One could be an XFORM. The other one c=\r\nan be a WSDL. Both should tell me what to do next. But wait, for that a WSD=\r\nL should be something I can consume dynamically. There is nothing in the sp=\r\nec that says it should be static. Implementations do not follow that, and t=\r\nhus All implementations of WSDL are unRESTFul. But that is not WSDL&#39;s fault=\r\n, is it?\n\nActually, it may be. You see, prior WSDL 2.0 we had a very static=\r\n definition of a WS consumption process. Now, WSDL 2.0 provides some patter=\r\nns or profiles that are not forcing you to use POST, for instance, and may =\r\neven work for defining HTTP interactions. That is why I say &quot;lately&quot;. \n\nSti=\r\nll, not much development on WSDL 2.0 has been done, and not much using it i=\r\nn a RESTful way. I posted an example of a REST services described using WSD=\r\nL 2.0 some time ago, I found in IBM&#39;s developers works. Bad news is you can=\r\n build your client using WSDL as an static description to generate a stub, =\r\nor create your client to consume the WSDL as any other resource, as part of=\r\n a larger RESTful web services. Now, guess how many people actually do any =\r\nof both things? Yep.\n\nAt the end, it may be a client implementation problem=\r\n.\n\nHere you have you links to similar ideas, using WSDL to define a &quot;RESTFu=\r\nl&quot; implementation. If you look closer, you will see we may end up again wit=\r\nh static stubs, but again it is a client problem, isn&#39;t it?\n\nhttp://www.ibm=\r\n.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-rest1\nhttp://www.ibm.com/develop=\r\nerworks/webservices/library/ws-restwsdl/\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares \n\n--- In=\r\n rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Willia=\r\nm:\n&gt; \n&gt; I did a quick scan an found about 50 discussion threads dating back=\r\n to\n&gt; mid 2007 on REST-Discuss that at least mentioned WSDL/WADL in some\n&gt; =\r\nway. WE&#39;ve certainly been talking about it quite a bit&lt;g&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;snip&gt; I st=\r\nill look for someone that explains in clear terms why is\n&gt; WSDL so bad. &lt;/s=\r\nnip&gt;\n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t find WSDL to be &quot;bad.&quot; I do, however, assert tha=\r\nt\n&gt; the WSDL pattern is not compatible w/ Fielding&#39;s particular arch\n&gt; mode=\r\nl. WSDL, as I&#39;ve experienced it (and continue to experience it)\n&gt; does not =\r\nemploy hypermedia to drive the transfer of application state.\n&gt; The WSDL im=\r\nplementations I see today still assume design-time\n&gt; consumption and bindin=\r\ng of a static, strongly-typed schema. I have yet\n&gt; to find WSDL implementat=\r\nions that induce the &quot;Architectural Properties\n&gt; of Key Interest&quot;[1] Fieldi=\r\nng outlines; especially Modifiability. For\n&gt; these reasons, when working in=\r\n an arch model that follows the\n&gt; Fielding&#39;s REST, I resist adding  WSDL|WA=\r\nDL implementations to the\n&gt; architecture.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;At the end the answer =\r\nis usually it supports RPC, which is not\n&gt; the case lately.&lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; I find=\r\n this interesting. I still see WSDL delivered to me by\n&gt; third-party integr=\r\nators that is in the RPC style. In fact, I cannot\n&gt; recall ever implementat=\r\ning a document-style WSDL integration for\n&gt; production use. I&#39;d very much l=\r\nike to see some examples of this. The\n&gt; closest I&#39;ve been able to come to a=\r\nny &quot;document-style&quot; w/ WSDL I&#39;ve\n&gt; been given is to implement a single XML =\r\nmessage-handler that treats a\n&gt; range of calls eash as a unique &quot;message fo=\r\nrmat&quot; instead of a single\n&gt; document model for a related set of request/res=\r\nponse interactions.\n&gt; Maybe I am simply working w/ rather dull folks who ar=\r\ne not keeping up\n&gt; on WSDL evolution. Please feel free to pass along any po=\r\ninters you\n&gt; have on document-style WSDL implementations (here or off-list,=\r\n if you\n&gt; like).\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertatio=\r\nn/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://tw=\r\nitter.com@mamund\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #RESTFest 2010\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://rest-fest.googlecode.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Dec 23, 2010 at 09:54,=\r\n William Martinez Pomares\n&gt; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; I sti=\r\nll look for someone that explains in clear terms why is WSDL so bad. At the=\r\n end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which is not the case lately. A=\r\nctually, it never was, as document style services should be the ones to use=\r\n. Oh, well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why is WSDL needed? To describe the actual service cons=\r\numption process. Where do we find the service? Where do we find the documen=\r\nt format we need to send or expect to receive? Where do we find the message=\r\n send a receive pattern? It is there, in the WSDL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, REST allows=\r\n that flow to be discovered, rather than written in one place. Ian&#39;s descri=\r\nption of the use of XForms achieves that, so they are similar in the goal, =\r\nmay not be so similar in the process. Both will required some out-of-band i=\r\nnformation. XForms is not forcing the POST method, actually. Is is a way to=\r\n describe the expected data in a known format, reducing coupling. You may l=\r\nater change the XFORM given some data for the request is changed, and nothi=\r\nng breaks (as a matter of fact, with WSDL should happen the same, but peopl=\r\ne use compile time binding, stubs, that break that possibility).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nat said, I think the benefit of this form is it avoid, at least a little, t=\r\nhe early binding that WADL or WSDL have. So, you are creating totally dynam=\r\nic clients instead of static ones, pre-build with stubs and things like tha=\r\nt. There is still one problem to solve, though, the semantics of the data f=\r\nields in the Form. But that should be managed as a pre defined context, wit=\r\nh a general, agreed upon, glossary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; William Martine=\r\nz Pomares.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J=F8rn Wildt &lt;jw@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I was reading Ian Robinsons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (=\r\nagain, it&#39;s a good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; read) at http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-t=\r\nyped-links-to-forms/.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here he introduces the idea of adding XForms to =\r\na link relation, such that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instead of having only:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 &lt;link=\r\n rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot; title=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and document out of ban=\r\nd how to post data to that link, one could have an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; XForm at the end of=\r\n the link and then use that information as the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; online/inline/in-band d=\r\nocumentation. I think that&#39;s quite a neat idea, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it strikes me that=\r\n it&#39;s getting awfull close to a WSDL spec.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Both XForm and WSDL de=\r\nfines how to POST data adhering to a specific XML\n&gt; &gt;&gt; schema. If you then =\r\nadd a list of links to XForms, the list would be much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like the WSDL li=\r\nst of methods/messages. The rel=3D&quot;&quot; types would specify WSDL\n&gt; &gt;&gt; message =\r\nnames.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In all we could =A0have an HTML 5 list like the one below =\r\nand call it the WSDL\n&gt; &gt;&gt; method list:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 &lt;dl&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 &lt;dt&gt;=\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 &lt;dd&gt;Description=\r\n&lt;/dd&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 &lt;/dl&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Each of the achors then points to an XForm w=\r\nhich in turn points to an XML\n&gt; &gt;&gt; schema definition and defines POST urls =\r\n- just like WSDL does.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is this good or bad? Is it better or worse=\r\n than WSDL and WADL?
