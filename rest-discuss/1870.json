SOAP 1.2 defines Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs).  MEPs are templates that define patterns for the exchange of \nmessages between SOAP nodes.  Part 2 of the SOAP 1.2 spec describes the MEPs provided with SOAP [1].  One of these appears to be somewhat similar to REST \n(based on my rather limited knowledge of REST) [2].\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/#soapsupmep\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/#WebMethodFeature\n\n"}}
