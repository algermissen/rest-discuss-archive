This does bring up the question of whether REST is common sense\n&gt; or not (I know that&#39;s not what Walden was actually saying).\n\nthis is an interesting question.\n\ni often wonder how many programmers/developers/whatever you want to call\nthem actually understand the Web itself.  i mean, i only really\nappreciated its fundamental qualities when i read timbl&#39;s _weaving the\nweb_ a few times 2+ years ago.  i feel there are many people out there\nwho just view HTTP as a request/response mainframe protocol like CICS or\nwhatever, but more graphical.  URIs don&#39;t really feature in their\nthinking at all, apart from as a path in the filesystem on the web server.\n\nthen i hear people with titles such as &quot;web application developer&quot; gush\nabout how flash should replace html (or foo should replace bar), and\nwonder &quot;what sort of &#39;web applications&#39; do *you* develop!?&quot;\n\nwhen i first read the RESTWiki (following a link from some oreillynet\narticle a few months ago) i was saying &quot;YES, this makes perfect sense&quot;.\n i had been struggling to build coherent web sites consisting of\nresources since late 2000 and lots of the theoretical and practical\nproblems i had just evaporated when i read the RESTWiki and the\ndissertation.  the other great thing was that there was a like-minded\ncommunity to go with REST and i have found that a big help in my efforts.\n\ni&#39;m rambling on a bit here, but my main point is that &#39;common sense&#39; may\nbe a subjective thing.  most people would agree that the Web has been a\nfabulous success so far (so the web being viewed as a Good Thing is\n&#39;common sense&#39;) but this would not have been &#39;common sense&#39; in 1992.\nmaybe &#39;common sense&#39; can be viewed as a function of how much new ground\nyour breaking when introducing a new concept?  how much are you\nchallenging people&#39;s current way of thinking?  in my view REST is &#39;just&#39;\nboiling lots of distributed application theory down to a very simple\ncore, but this is a radical step in itself.\n\nit seems to me that many distributed application architectures have\ntried to make the network look like one big computer, where you just\ncall functions on other computers the way you call them on your own.\nbut i think history has taught us that this doesn&#39;t work because it\nignores the strengths and weaknesses that networks bring to the table.\n\n-v\n\n\n\n"}}
