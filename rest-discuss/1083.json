In REST a resource represents a service or a \ndata element, and every significant resource should have a URI.  In \nthe given system there were two services: &quot;availabiltiy amount&quot; \nand &quot;is quantity available&quot;, and one data element: the BlueShoe \nproduct.  It seems that each of these should have their own URI so:\n\nAvailability amount service: \nhttp://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity\n\nIs quantity availabilty service: \nhttp://www.myinventory.com/services/isavailable\n\nBlueShoe: http://www.myinventory.com/product/blueshoe\n\nThen to do the queries the following URIs would be used:\n\n1) http://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity?\nproduct=http://www.myinventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow\n\n2) http://www.myinventory.com/services/isavailable?\nproduct=http://www.myinventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow\n&above=100\n\nLike I said, this seems a little more RESTful to me, and I&#39;m trying \nto figure out what the advantages of this approach would be other \nthan that it just seems to be the right way.  One thing is that it \nuses a standard way of naming the products (via URIs) instead of \nnaming them by adding to a sub-path of an existing URI.  This seems \nmore extensible: to add new products into the system, you don&#39;t add \nnew paths to the URI, just use new query strings.  I\n\nIs this a real advantage? Are there any other advantages to doing it \nthis way?  Opinions would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nToivo Lainevool\nNew Iron Systems\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., &quot;S.

POST might be used \nto\n&gt; allocate out of the availability - but a business document probably \nwill\n&gt; have that information & so you&#39;d just submit it to the &#39;orders&#39; \ncollection &\n&gt; let the values be updated via business logic (meaning that the \nvalues from\n&gt; these two sample queries are &#39;synthetic&#39; properties, derived from \ndata\n&gt; manipulated via other actions)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;bhaugen32&quot; &lt;bhaugen32@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 04, 2002 10:42 AM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Restifying Available to Promise\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assuming this group is still alive (I know everybody&#39;s been busy\n&gt; &gt; evangelizing in W3C lists), I have a followup question on the\n&gt; &gt; purchase order scenarios.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is a standard function in an ERP system called Available to\n&gt; &gt; Promise, or ATP for short.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Available&quot; means &quot;not already promised to somebody&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is used to decide if a purchase order can be fulfilled or not.\n&gt; &gt; It is usually used for purchase orders for products, so that is \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; I will describe here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are a variety of APIs and algorithms, but they boil down to \ntwo\n&gt; &gt; main queries, which I will describe in plain English, not code:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.  How much of a product is available to promise at a future \ntime?\n&gt; &gt; For example, how many blue shoes can I get by tomorrow?\n&gt; &gt; The answer is a quantity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Is a specified quantity of a product at a specified time?\n&gt; &gt; For example, can I get 100 blue shoes tomorrow?\n&gt; &gt; The answer is a boolean.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This query might be offered to a customer to use before they \nplace an\n&gt; &gt; order, or it might be used by the order-taking Web resource before\n&gt; &gt; accepting an order.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In REST terms, I assume this is a GET with parameters, and the Web\n&gt; &gt; resource to address is the Product (i.e. BlueShoe).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How would you say it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Bob Haugen\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
