I&#39;d be happy to check out some REST-ful examples built w/ \nWCF,\n&gt; if you=\r\n have any to recommend.\n\nThere is &quot;better&quot; support in the 3.5 framework so =\r\nyou may want to \ntake a look at that.  I&#39;m working on something right now b=\r\nut there \nisn&#39;t much too much out there.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As for my comment on text/xm=\r\nl...\n&gt; text/xml is a pretty &#39;non-informative[g]&#39; mime-type. when i see \nAto=\r\nm,\n&gt; RDF, RSS, i know a great deal about the document - what&#39;s required,\n&gt; =\r\ndata types, etc. All that without using a schema or other document \nto\n&gt; te=\r\nll me that. It would probably have been better for me to use a\n&gt; custom con=\r\ntent-type for my example:\n&gt; &quot;application/vnd.amundsen.tasklist+xml&quot; or some=\r\nthing like that. But,\n&gt; as long as the client and server already understand=\r\n the schema, \nthere\n&gt; is no big deal.\n\nAgreed.  Unfortunately Atom and RSS =\r\nare not always the best types for \nconveying representation of a resource. =\r\n I&#39;m not sure I agree with \nthe need to share schemas of represenation with=\r\n clients - what if the \ntype is JSON or something else?  Then I couldn&#39;t us=\r\ne a schema.\n\n\n"}}
