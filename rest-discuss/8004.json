How many different \n&gt; web servers do we have nowadays?  App servers? Servlet \n&gt; containers?  Maybe I haven&#39;t been paying attention, but I \n&gt; didn&#39;t realize there were any major interoperability issues \n&gt; between them \n\nI&#39;m talking about the implementation level on server, not at the HTTP level.\nI&#39;ve been studying Python lately, so I&#39;ll use it for an example. If I use\nDjango, I can&#39;t use SQLObject or SQLAlchemy.  Or Kid or Cheetah or Myghty\nfor templates.  Etc.  So I have to use Django, or I get to have access to a\nmix-and-match approach.  But I can&#39;t do both. And I have to spend an\nincredible amount of time evaluating the differences and trying to decide\nwhich solution is going to meet my needs and not box me in.\n\n&gt; I say bring on the frameworks.  Each will have its own \n&gt; approach for facilitating RESTful development - some will use \n&gt; annotations, some will let you use URI-templating, others \n&gt; will make it easy to map database records to resources; I&#39;ll \n&gt; pick the one I use based on the needs of my current project.  \n\nAnd what I&#39;m asking is that people don&#39;t needlessly proliferate without\nhaven&#39;t some clear and obvious added value, and if possible find and use\nsome common interfeces with existing frameworks.\n\n&gt; If it turns out that the framework I&#39;m using doesnt suit my \n&gt; needs, at least I&#39;ll have some options.\n\nAnd if people heed my concerns, you&#39;ll have a far easier time switching.  If\nthey ignore my concerns, your momentum on one framewok may well make it\nimpossible for you to switch.\n\nSaid another way: Many of us lived through the days of proprietary lockin by\nvendors; why would you champion proprietary lockin by open-source projects?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
