There were a lot more\nprototype methods in the hypertext &quot;as implemented&quot; spec.\n\nWhat you are probably thinking of is the set of methods in the\noriginal HTTP/1.1 proposal, which were later trimmed by the WG to\nfit the scope of what the WG considered could be standardized\nat that time.\n\n&gt; Whether or not all WebDAV methods have been defined *well*, and  \n&gt; whether\n&gt; they are all needed, is a separate discussion. But just because\n&gt; something doesn&#39;t appear in RFC2616 doesn&#39;t make it not &quot;restful&quot; per\n&gt; se. Consider LINK or PATCH, for example.\n\nBoth of which are RESTful, as designed by me in the original\nHTTP/1.1 proposal.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
