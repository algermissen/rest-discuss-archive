Any information\nthat can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal\nservice (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a collection of other\nresources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other\nwords, any concept that might be the target of an author&#39;s hypertext\nreference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a\nconceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds\nto the mapping at any particular point in time\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nHowever, you write:\n\n&lt;quote&gt;\nLet&#39;s quickly go over some of the basics of REST.\n\nA resource is an Object that exists on a network.\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nSo apparently your views and Roy Fielding&#39;s are quite different.\n\n\nOn Sun, 16 Feb 2003, inthedarkplace &lt;inthedarkplace@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really want to bring the dreaded &#39;What do URIs identify?&#39;\n&gt; debate which consumes the tag-list every once and a while to this\n&gt; peaceful list, but I find myself in a position where I must integrate\n&gt; RDF into a REST based system.
