The *generic* semantics of NOTIFY is to tell\nthe server that the resource is now out-of-date.\nThis is generic to all resources.  Whether the\nserver knows or cares to resolve the situation is\nan entirely separate question.\n\nThis is very different from POST which tells the\nserver that the target URL should change in some\nmanner.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
