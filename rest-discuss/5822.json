I&#39;ve thought about this and believe I have  \nfound a way to combine digest auth with my cookie/URL rewriting  \napproach that would give me the best of both worlds. In theory it  \nwill work whether or not JavaScript and/or cookies are enabled in the  \nclient.\n\nFirst, on rereading the Http Auth spec, I think there is a protocol  \nin place already that would cause the client to reprompt the user for  \ndigest auth credentials. If you respond with a stale=false in the WWW- \nAuthenticate header of your 401 response:\n\n...If stale is FALSE, or anything other than TRUE, or the stale  \ndirective is not present, the username and/or password are invalid,  \nand new values must be obtained.\n\nftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt\n\nSo I believe that even though you have no way of logging the user off  \nthe client, if you have a way to detect an expired authentication  \nsession, you have a good chance of triggering the client&#39;s auth  \ndialog to show up again forcing the user to re-enter a username and  \npassword. By combining digest auth with cookies/URL rewriting, I can  \nuse the cookies/URL rewriting to detect an authentication session  \ntimeout. That would satisfy me on that concern.\n\nOn my concerns about a usable sign in form, I&#39;m thinking of sending a  \npage that starts out explaining that when they press on the &quot;Show  \nSign In Dialog&quot; button, it will show a dialog and to put their Artima  \nID in the User Name, etc... And I&#39;ll have links for Forgot Your  \nPassword and Sign Up and so on that page. If JavaScript is enabled,  \nJS in the page will run that will replace the explanation and &quot;Show  \nSign In Dialog&quot; button with the usual login form. JS will intercept  \nthe submission, and do the HTTP auth behind the scenes. I expect the  \nvast majority of clients will have JS enabled.\n\nThe servers will always only sign users in via HTTP digest auth. But  \non each successful authentication, they will send the cookie auth  \ntoken (or use URL rewriting if cookies aren&#39;t enabled) that I was  \nplanning to do before. The cookies/URL rewriting will give me all the  \npersonalization I want, and much of the single sign on. The digest  \nauth will be checked on  pages I need to really be concerned about  \nprotecting, which means I don&#39;t need to worry about hijacked cookie  \nsessions anymore.\n\nThe only thing I feel I&#39;ve sort of lost is some of single sign on,  \nbecause although the cookie/URL rewriting session will follow users  \nanywhere they go in our network, they&#39;ll have to do the digest auth  \nagain at each site. But they will only have to do the digest auth  \nagain if they try to go to a protected page at a site, and when using  \ncookies I was feeling the need to ask them for their password again  \nanyway because of the fear of session hijacking. So that&#39;s acceptable  \nto me, because I don&#39;t expect it to happen that often so as to become  \nthat annoying to the user, and it is a bit of a boost to security.\n\nIt sounds like this approach will make things much simpler while  \nmeeting my requirements. So maybe HTTP auth is not so bad after all  \nso long as you know how to use it. But I will need to try it to find  \nout how well the theory will work in practice. Thanks for all of your  \nfeedback.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
