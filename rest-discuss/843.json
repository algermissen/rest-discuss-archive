You can&#39;t ever\naddress representations directly.  At the same time while resources are\naddressible they still remain abstract in some important sense:  sans DAV\nsemantics, even a PUT on the resource has an indirect and semantically vague\ninteraction with the underlying object, semantics subject to interpretation and\nintermediation by some unspecified and non-addressible layer(s) of software.\n\nI waffle between believing this is a hugely powerful and important (if\nunderspecified) concept and thinking it&#39;s another HTTP &quot;wart.&quot;\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\nPaul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;S.

Why not? I would think just the opposite - alternate representations\n&gt; &gt; are nothing but a transformation of a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; I meant that the PUT is not semantically a transformation. It is a\n&gt; transformation only in the sense that you transform from the\n&gt; representation to the underlying bits that comprise the resource. It\n&gt; isn&#39;t semantically an HTML to GIF transformation. It&#39;s an HTML to\n&gt; &quot;graphical object&quot; converter, which happens to generate GIF\n&gt; representations if you ask for them.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
