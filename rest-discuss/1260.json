Mike says that you CANNOT statically\n&gt; type a URI-described resource before the URI. Do you agree that this is\n&gt; impossible?\nThat&#39;s not what I was saying. I don&#39;t have a problem with discovering the\ndata definition of a resource before any instances exist. I&#39;m only concerned\nwith discovering what the URI for the future resource is.\n\nTo clarify, I was saying that you can&#39;t get a list of resources from a\nserver and expect that list to contain the URI for the resource you are\nabout to create. I want to PUT a comment to a discussion group - what URI\nshould I use? How do I use hyperlinking to discover the URI of the resource\nthat I want to create? Doing discovery on the resource representing the\ndiscussion group will not provide the URI desired. Doing some other process\nis needed - GET on a &#39;gimme the next uri please&#39; resource followed by PUT,\nusing POST and having the server respond with the URI, etc.\n\nIt seems that PUT should only be used for update and not create - you still\nhave to have the server determine the URI and use a multi-step operation or\na different method. A client & server that have priviliged knowledge can\ncoordinate on the URI structure - and I&#39;m fine with that - but I don&#39;t think\nthe broadest scope, most general solution would take that approach.\n\n&gt; You aren&#39;t listening. Of course you can&#39;t get a pointer to an object\n&gt; before it exists. But you CAN statically declare the object before you\n&gt; have a pointer to it.\nIs this static declaration describing the structure of the state of a\nresource? I know that getting the definition of the structure of a resource\nis easy - but once I fill in the blanks, where do I PUT the data?\n\n\n\n"}}
