I&#39;d expect that HTML is far and away the most\n&gt;&gt; popular format.  RSS is probably the most popular XML based format,\n&gt;&gt; but way behind HTML.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I should clarify that I&#39;m looking at REST from the standpoint of \n&gt; being\n&gt; an alternative to SOAP, not as a way of constructing a web app. In that\n&gt; setting it seems much more desirable for a REST service to return XML \n&gt; than\n&gt; HTML, correct?\n\nIt depends on the consuming application.  In any case, REST is an\narchitectural style and SOAP is a protocol, so you can build REST-based\napplications using SOAP.  You will have to be more specific, such as\nREST-based HTTP applications versus RPC-based SOAP applications.\n\n&gt; I assumed that using REST as an alternative to SOAP was the most \n&gt; common use\n&gt; of REST. Is that wrong?\n\nCompletely wrong -- hypertext browsing on the Web is the most common\nuse of REST-based applications.  The only reason that SOAP even enters\nthe discussion is because some people tried to fix the major problems\nwith SOAP that caused its resources to be unusable on the Web, and\nwhen they did so they used REST as the basis of their arguments.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
