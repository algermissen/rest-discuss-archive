Any representation of a resource can\ncontain a form if the data format supports it.  If you want to edit\nthe representation, you can do so and then attempt to PUT it back.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The same applies to getting a blank form for creating a new resource.\n\nWhy a blank form?  You&#39;d want a form that pointed (URI) you to the\nresource which performs the resource-creation side effect.  The form\nwould also have to tell you the media type that should be used for\nthat.  The URI from which you got the form via GET might be the same\nto which you POST back though.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
