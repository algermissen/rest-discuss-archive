My initial approach was to use XHR for HTTP  \n&gt; auth but I&#39;ve encountered a couple of limitations doing it that way:\n&gt;\n&gt; - If the user provides incorrect login credentials XHR provides no  \n&gt; means to handle the authentication failure and they&#39;re presented with  \n&gt; the browser&#39;s auth dialog\n&gt; - Can&#39;t logout once authenticated (a problem for users of public  \n&gt; computers such as internet cafes)\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s been a few references to using cookies with digest  \n&gt; authentication on the list recently, I&#39;m wondering if somebody could  \n&gt; explain to me how to actually implement this for a web application.\n\nYou can do it... I&#39;m going to have an article published on onlamp.com\n(that sounds clumsy doesn&#39;t it?) about how to do it.\n\nBut if you do it you have to reimplement the authentication\nstack... ie: you have to throw away the existing basic authentication\nhandlers.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
