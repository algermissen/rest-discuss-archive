That&#39;s the key: the\nrelationship *is* a resource all to itself. Same with a transaction\n(the example in the REST book).\n\n&gt; How might I then reverse that operation when I realize I was wrong and that activity 18 is actually not part of subject 5? I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to do this:\n&gt;\n&gt;   DELETE  /subjects/5/activities/18\n\nThat&#39;s why the resource is just the relationship.\n\n&gt; What I was looking for was a way of specifying the association without having to update the activity 18 resource itself.\n\nThat may not be the URL you want to use, of course. But yes, just\nspecify the association.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like this much unless I am also storing other information in this association resource -- perhaps a strength-factor for the association or a user_id to keep track of who created the association.\n\nWhy?  I mean, you can if the app seems to need it, of course. But it&#39;s\nokay to have a resource that&#39;s very simple.\n\n&gt; When making an association between two resources where the relationship is many-to-many a common implementation might be to just use a join table with each row holding just two values: the ids of the two related resources. At least with this implementation the association doesn&#39;t really have much of an independent existence.\n\nThe association doesn&#39;t need to map directly to a database resource.\nThat&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s hard to let go of, or at least was for\nme. There&#39;s nothing wrong with exposing, for instance, a single flag\nout of a database record as its own separate resource, if it makes\nsense to need it that way.\n\nI ended up doing this to maintain a newsrc-type list of read messages.\nThe newsrc list might, for instance, look like this: &quot;1-50, 52, 54-55,\n57&quot;. Send a DELETE to http://blahblahblah/55 and internally the newsrc\nline gets changed to &quot;1-50, 52, 54, 57&quot;. The &quot;resource&quot; isn&#39;t even an\nentire *field* in the database in this case.\n\n&gt; This implies that Restfully the only operations would be GET and PUT.\n\nPerhaps. Or you could use existence or not as your true/false value -\neffectively the newsrc example does that, where if the number exists\nin the range, then &quot;read=true.&quot; But yeah, not all resources,\nespecially very simple ones, justify all HTTP methods.\n\n"}}
