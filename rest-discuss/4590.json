In [1] you *seem* to differentiate three\nexpectations on POST accepting resources yourself:\n\n1. Composite state resources\n2. Identity-preserving composite state resources\n3. Processing resources\n\nI understand how the query scenario is a specific specialization of, hmm, 3.\nabove, but I actually do not understand how it differs from POSTing\na purchase order and expecting the returned Location: URI to identify\nthe newly created purchase order resource.\n\nGiven the three resource &#39;types&#39; above, I wonder\n\n- in what sense they allow a uniform expectation and what it is that *every*\n  user agent can expect doing a POST\n\n- how the query scenario is an extension of the above differentiation that\n  breaks this uniform expectation\n\nAnyhow, I have a hunch that you are saying the right thing, I maybe just don&#39;t look\nat it the right way...\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-state-model-01.txt\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What you&#39;ve outlined seems to go way beyond what Fielding defines\n&gt; &gt; &quot;substitutability&quot; to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But at least the architectural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideal has been identified, which permits one to more easily see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tradeoffs being made with alternate solutions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You seem to be saying that any client-side application that is\n&gt; &gt; hard-coded\n&gt; &gt; to process a specific response ideally should use a new method.\n&gt; \n&gt; To be self-descriptive by describing its expectations in the message,\n&gt; yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  How is\n&gt; &gt; this any different from RPC then?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not.  Erm, well, it&#39;s actually *worse* than RPC; it&#39;s non\n&gt; self-descriptive RPC.  That was my point when I responded to Roy saying\n&gt; that it&#39;s a slippery slope towards services specific interfaces, even\n&gt; if previous information gathered from the server told a client something\n&gt; about the service which provided this expectation, and even if the\n&gt; client&#39;s resultant message had this expectation marked a mandatory\n&gt; extension.  I believe that such communication should be constrained to\n&gt; informing the client of *extended* expectations, not entirely new\n&gt; non-uniform semantics.\n&gt; \n&gt; FWIW, I&#39;ve spent an unhealthy amount of time pondering, specifying[2],\n&gt; and implementing[3], the intricacies of this exact issue over the past\n&gt; three or so years, so I&#39;m fairly confident I&#39;m on solid ground.
