But now, I think it would be\nbest for clients to have a &#39;delete&#39; button on the address bar, which is\ngreyed out unless the response headers include Accept: DELETE.  Either\nway, the issue of unintentional DELETE requests comes up, but more so\nwith a button in the browser chrome I would think.\n\nWhat do y&#39;all think about, if a server receives a DELETE request,\nresponding with a 202 Accepted with a message body including some sort\nof confirmation form?  Could this be a simple HTML form with a POST, or\nshould the confirmation form make a DELETE request also?  Whichever\nway, the response to the confirmation would be 204 No Content, right?\n\nThis group talked me out of the double-DELETE thing which was the topic\nof my original &quot;Fun with DELETE&quot; thread, btw.  :-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
