But I&#39;ve come to learn\nthat there&#39;s a very fine line - but a line nonetheless - between a\nretrieved representation which provides link metadata which presents\ncues for document exchange, and a description of a service specific\ninterface (e.g. an IDL or WSDL file).  Consider this declaration;\n\n  &lt;x:StateSetter rdf:about=&quot;http://example.org/foo/bar/&quot;/&gt;\n\nHere, &quot;StateSetter&quot; indicates to the recipient that the identified\nresource does the semantic equivalent of PUT with a POST.  So now the\nclient has a choice to make about setting the state of the resource;\ndoes it use PUT, or does it use POST with &quot;StateSetter&quot; as the\nmandatory expected role/type?\n\nI claim that the former is more RESTful, primarily because the latter\nexhibits less-than-RESTful visibility, telling me that at least one of\nREST&#39;s constraints that impacts visibility is being disregarded.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
