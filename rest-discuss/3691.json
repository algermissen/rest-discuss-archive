I&#39;m not sure I share your\noptimism in this, although I do like models myself.  The problem\nis that group is adept at avoiding the stimulae that result in\na change of position, and they&#39;re getting better and better with\npractice.\n\nThe people who really want to learn REST end up on this list\nthrowing stones at it until either they win or they learn.  Most if\nnot all also dabble in concrete implementations of the pattern. You\ndon&#39;t see the WSA group members doing that;  I think it&#39;s doubly\ndoubtful they&#39;d engage in a formal models-based inquiry.\n\nThanks for the reference; I want to check it out when I get\na chance.\n\nWalden\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Tyler Close&quot; &lt;tyler@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 20, 2003 4:35 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Documenting REST resource models\n\n\n&gt; On Tuesday 20 May 2003 15:16, Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would hazard an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intuitive guess that a lack of even a semi-formal set of conventions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for declaratively describing / documenting resource models is one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the main sources of friction that we (the REST community) experience\nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to communicate with the unenlightened. ;-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree. I think a great deal of the friction is based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illogical arguments. With a more rigorous model, these arguments\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be more easily and decisively refuted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which arguments?\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, I have repeatedly seen the claim that REST may be\n&gt; good for simple applications, but that larger applications are\n&gt; better done using the SOAP-based web-services machinery.\n&gt;\n&gt; You and Mark Baker were just involved in a go-round of this\n&gt; permathread on the www-ws-arch list. Mark responded to the\n&gt; challenge with a simple sketch of how additional functionality\n&gt; could be added to a purchase order application. I have seen\n&gt; similar answers in the past. I suspect the critics will remain\n&gt; unsatisfied with this response and the permathread will continue\n&gt; another day.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a rigorous model, it could be more convincingly shown that a\n&gt; REST model is at least as expressive as a SOAP-based model. For\n&gt; example, in the web-calculus spec, I show that the web-calculus\n&gt; encompases the functionality of DEM. See:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/#Document_Exchange_Model_(DEM)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully, people will find such an analytic answer more\n&gt; convincing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
