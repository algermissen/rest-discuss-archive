I think REST is a good name ---\nnotwithstanding the problem with existing English terms, it states\nspecifically and tersely *the* core idea.  (I.e., I think you&#39;re wrong --\nREpresentational State Transfer *is* the single, clear, defining\ncharacteristic, and the key differentiator between the original Web concept\n(transfer object state / representations, all objects have a generic and\ndistributable interface and semantics) and any of a number of appropriate and\ninappropriate technologies that have accreted around the Web.  WWWAS sound\nlike yet another bs tech-elite jargon / acronym, and surely we&#39;ve had (a)\nenough of those, and (b) enough of those with &quot;www&quot; embedded in them.\nReferring to something as WWWAS also runs the risk of being a hotbed of\ndisagreement as to what constitutes the Web&#39;s architecture;  REST runs this\nrisk, too, but is potentially much more contained.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\nPaul Prescod wrote:\n\n&gt; My article is going to be published in a couple of weeks and I&#39;d like to\n&gt; think of that as the first wave in a marketing campaign that will get\n&gt; the web services world to start re-evaluating what we have. The rest of\n&gt; you geeks are probably more concerned with substance over style so I\n&gt; doubt I&#39;ll get much uptake on this suggestion. Nevertheless...it&#39;s worth\n&gt; a try.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frankly, I think the name &quot;REpresentational State Transfer&quot; sucks. Maybe\n&gt; when I get more REST-Zen I&#39;ll think that the core idea in the web\n&gt; architecture is the transfer of state representations but right now I\n&gt; think that&#39;s just one issue, along with unified naming conventions,\n&gt; generic methods, standardization of content types, client-side\n&gt; scripting, etc. The whole architecture has no single clear defining\n&gt; characteristic so I don&#39;t think it should be named after a particular\n&gt; one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, REST isn&#39;t going away but maybe we can have a different name when\n&gt; the style is applied to so-called &quot;Web services&quot;. I propose World Wide\n&gt; Web Architectural Style : WWWAS\n&gt;\n&gt; Using the full form of &quot;the Web&quot; may get people thinking back to roots.\n&gt; It is not an English word so a single essay will score easily in Google.\n&gt; WWWAS would individuate itself (informally) from REST over a while by\n&gt; adopting standardized XML formats that apply to web services problems.\n&gt; Or maybe WWWAS is REST+XML and everything XML allows.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
