That makes COM appear to\n&gt; &gt; follow object orientation more closely and easier to use, but I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; sure that&#39;s the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; (D)COM is the (Distributed) Component Object Model, whereas REST doesn&#39;t\n&gt; put forth an object[-oriented] model in favor of resources,\n&gt; representations and uniform interfaces.  It&#39;s pretty clearly the case\n&gt; that COM follows object orientation more closely.\n\nYou can think of HTTP as object-oriented if you like; it just\nleverages a very constrained *interface* so as to help clients\npredictably handle different types of objects. That interface states\nthat all objects have a universally addressable location (the URL);\nare serializable using a selectable protocol (the content-type or mime\ntype); and implement one or more of a constrained set of methods (GET,\nPOST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.).\n\nThe constrained-ness of the interface is where REST (and HTTP in\nparticular) win over CORBA and DCOM. Furthermore, HTTP goes to great\npains to optimize the common case (the GET method) so as to minimize\ndelivery overhead. That&#39;s why it scales better.\n\n"}}
