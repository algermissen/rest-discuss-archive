I&#39;m just frustrated at having to choose between my own UI\nand playing RESTfully.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;  Are there any people from browser development teams here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. But Mozilla and WebKit are open source. So, why aren&#39;t more\n&gt; people on this list part of the teams? :)\n\nBecause we&#39;re too busy building apps?\n\n\n&gt; Mozilla&#39;s authentication facilities are pluggable. It&#39;s easy to add\n&gt; your own schemes as extensions.\n\nCould it be done through extensions?\n\n\n&gt; No real reason. It&#39;s a chicken/egg situation. FWIW, I&#39;m working on\n&gt; several HTTP authentication issues right now. I hope some of that work\n&gt; will make into Firefox 3. There&#39;s also a W3C group working on UI\n&gt; issues, and it seems like they have a clue. That will probably miss\n&gt; Fx3, unless they happen to finish quickly AND produce something\n&gt; useful... but it is a standards body, so that is a tall order.\n\nI just want the existing authentication system but without the UI.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
