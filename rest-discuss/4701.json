AAA is handled here as in most web applications I know of via\nserver sessions. I am not clear at all how to implement REST in a\nbrowser-based environment where the only way to keep client-side state\nis to stuff server-generated pages with state information on each\nrequest and return it in subsequent POSTs, which violates the\n&quot;separation of GET and POST&#39; commandment; either that or the GET urls\nare gonna get pretty big. Or am I missing something? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
