(...honest question, still learning.)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Of a mistake?\n&gt; \n&gt; How about an example of a mistake. ;-)\n\nHere&#39;s an entire spec:\n\n  http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/\n\nthe culmination of 5 years worth of controller based designs in Java? \nUse POST for everything. More on contollers in a minute.\n\nHere&#39;s another:\n\n  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/\n\nand everything that came after which we now know as WS-*.\n\nBack to feedburner:\n\n   POST http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/ModifyFeed\n\nwhich is representative of a number of Web API approaches. The thing is \nthat this translates in OO-speak to:\n\n  manager.modifyFeed(id, args)\n\nthe problem is, people competent in OO don&#39;t write code like that. \nThey&#39;d only write code like that if they weren&#39;t allow ctors or \nfactories to begin with, so everything would have to go through a \nmanager. Managers are a sign of a design problem; it&#39;s almost standard \nmaterial for tech interviewing.\n\nIn the place where the Web and OO meet this design problem is called a \nController. Except in that world, Controllers are a hailed as a top \ndrawer idea - think MVC or Model2 patterns.\n\nHere&#39;s an entire enterprise platform&#39;s architectural premise for the web:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html\n\nThe common strand is GET for clicks, and POST for everything else. Forms \nreally /are/ everything else for most server side web developers. .NET \nis much different. I&#39;ve met at least 3/4 ASP devs who thought *not* \nputting everything through a single URL was a bad idea.\n\nHere&#39;s why I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s on telly without buying a copy of \nthe Sunday Times:\n\nhttp://www.rte.ie/arts/tvradio.html\n\n\n\nYou&#39;re talking about web stars like jfried not getting it. I&#39;m talking \nabout repeated generations keying off html forms as the primary usecase \nto have to deal with. That gets baked into frameworks in the form of \naction controllers. The biases of web frameworks heavily influence how \nserver side apps get written, how they are designed and what gets put \ninto books and articles...\n\n...a million sprayed web monkeys later...\n\n...in turn that bleeds into specs like SOAP and XML-RPC. And most \nrecently web apis.\n\nAnd then there&#39;s all the clients that don&#39;t support other than GET/POST. \nLike maybe 100-500M mobile phones. We went through that with APP, two \nyears ago it must be - how to deal with J2ME. Because J2ME implemented \nhtml forms support instead of HTTP support.\n\n\nOk. Sometimes you need controllers as a place to start the app state \nmachine. For example the Rails &quot;/thing/new&quot; idiom is a reasonable place \nto create new things. APP kind of has them in the form of service \ndocuments, but thereafter you deal with the resources themselves.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
