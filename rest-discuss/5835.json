POST is RESTful too, when it is used correctly.\n\nThis is what confuses me.  My (naive) understanding is that every URI  \nrepresents a noun, that is, a resource.  The URL:\n\nhttp://myhost.com/convert\n\nseems like it represents a verb, especially when given parameters:\n\nhttp://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf\n\nor even when given other nouns:\n\nhttp://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/ \nget_it_here.html\n\nSo, if I read Roy correctly, the service described by that URL is --  \nor at least could be -- RESTful. Does this mean that the belief &quot;URLs  \nmust represent nouns&quot; is a complete myth?  Or is there something else  \ngoing on here?\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
