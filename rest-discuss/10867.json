I&#39;ve\nnot seen many clear descriptions of HATEOS and your feedback is\nhelpful.\n\nYou say &quot;The application state is in the client. It&#39;s not the same\nthing as the resource state on the server...&quot; So you are saying that\nhypermedia is the way the client changes the client&#39;s state, right? I\ndon&#39;t read Fielding as talking about client state here. Maybe\nsomewhere else?\n\nYou say &quot;...the client can change the state machine as well as\nnavigate it...&quot; when I am saying the client can change the state of\nthe application. Are we really talking about two different things or\njust the same thing w/ different names?\n\n\nFinally, I&#39;m fully on board with the &quot;state machine&quot; concept. I have\nanother short piece I&#39;m working on that centers on that.\n\nMikeA\n\nOn Sat, May 31, 2008 at 12:50 AM, wahbedahbe &lt;andrew.wahbe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well done -- complex subjects are always hard to summarize like that.\n&gt; I like the images you added to each subsection too -- it&#39;s a nice touch.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your description of the HATEOAS constraint doesn&#39;t match my\n&gt; understanding of it however. The application state is in the client.\n&gt; It&#39;s not the same thing as the resource state on the server (which is\n&gt; how I interpreted your description). The simplest way to think about\n&gt; it is as a web of connected resources being a state machine. The\n&gt; client navigates the state machine by executing GETs -- the current\n&gt; state of the application is determined by the resource representation\n&gt; it is currently &quot;viewing&quot; (it&#39;s actually defined by multiple resource\n&gt; representations at one time, such as images and scripts linked from an\n&gt; HTML doc, but let&#39;s ignore that complexity for now). The hyperlinks in\n&gt; the representation are the possible transitions through the state machine.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the state machine has more to it -- the client can change the\n&gt; state machine as well as navigate it. A POST allows a client to add a\n&gt; state (and usually navigate to that new state in one step). A PUT\n&gt; allows a client to change a state and a DELETE lets it remove a state.\n&gt; The changes that a client can make at any time are also governed by\n&gt; the representation that it is currently viewing. This is usually done\n&gt; through forms embedded in the representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; At least that&#39;s my take on it...\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew Wahbe\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mike amundsen&quot; &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve posted a short article (@1000 words) on REST that encapsulates my\n&gt;&gt; own understanding of the style.
