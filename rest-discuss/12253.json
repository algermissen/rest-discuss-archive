This results in a &quot;consistent set of semantics for\n&gt; &gt; all resources&quot; and avoids the problems of the early Web which\n&gt; &gt; precluded caching, as per Fielding 5.1.4.\n&gt; \n&gt; The web is a global hypertext system. To my mind, it doesn’t seem to\n&gt; make any sense to distinguish between “resources controlled by the\n&gt; application” and other resources (presumably controlled by other\n&gt; applications). Either there is a global constraint, or there is no\n&gt; constraint.\n&gt; \n\nThe goal of REST is a uniform interface, not a global interface.  One\nAPI may assign &quot;create&quot; semantics to POST and &quot;update&quot; semantics to\nPUT.  Another API may assign &quot;create&quot; semantics to PUT and &quot;update&quot;\nsemantics to PATCH.  Neither is wrong, yet neither are they compatible,\neven if both applications do exactly the same thing.\n\nWhat&#39;s &quot;global&quot; to me, is whether a given method is idempotent or not,\nplus GET and DELETE, which leaves plenty of room for interpretation --\nthe gist of an architectural style.  Split-level-ranch houses come in\nall shapes and sizes.  So do REST APIs.  By &quot;resources controlled by\nthe application&quot; I mean &quot;resources inside the same house&quot; like having\nuniform wiring throughout.\n\nOne house may be 110 volts, another 220, neither violates specs but\nneither are they compatible, due to the lack of a global constraint on\nvoltage.  All the outlets should be the same within the house, although\none house may have spade prongs and another, cylindrical.  The\nconstraint is that one or the other is chosen and adhered to throughout.\n\n(A house with both 110 and 220 would be un-RESTful in my example.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
