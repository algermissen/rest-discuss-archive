I don&#39;t agree!   ...  [everyone in party stops laughing and looks a=\r\nt me in shock].\n\nNo - I&#39;m not an unreasonable dogmatic REST zealot, but I /=\r\nam/ passionate about the possibilities for the more declarative programming=\r\n and distribution style that REST or &#39;ROA&#39; enables.\n\nROA is a &#39;dual&#39; of SOA=\r\n and requires a corresponding inversion in your thinking - from verbs to no=\r\nuns, from actions, messages and commands to resources, open state and inten=\r\ntions.\n\nObviously, when you make the jump, things that would be easy before=\r\n (verbs, actions, messages, commands) have to be recast in the style (nouns=\r\n, resources, state, intentions), and that may seem like &#39;convolution&#39; at fi=\r\nrst, especially since 99% of our programming is imperative.\n\nActually, you =\r\nmay have picked on a bad example of when REST may strain to model your appl=\r\nication: surely Atom is great for &#39;reliable messaging&#39;? I&#39;ve never missed a=\r\n thing in my feed reader. And you say you want timely &#39;one-to-one&#39; delivery=\r\n of your pizza order? No problem, use POST. \n\nIn fact, create an Order Reso=\r\nurce, stick it in an Atom list and then also POST the new list directly to =\r\nthe pizza parlour. If the POST fails then you could POST again, and anyway =\r\nthere&#39;ll be a poll along soon enough to cover your back. Not too convoluted=\r\n, especially if there&#39;s library support for Atom and for, well, POSTing stu=\r\nff.\n\nBenefit: your state is now visible; you&#39;ve got an Order Resource and a=\r\nn Orders List Resource.\n\nNotice that this illustrates how REST style is abo=\r\nut state transfer, /not/ messaging, reliable or otherwise. REST can do reli=\r\nable or unreliable state transfer, and it can do ongoing state-changed tran=\r\nsfer, with GET and/or POST. Just got to think in terms of resources and ope=\r\nn state.\n\nIf you&#39;re going for REST, for its benefits of interoperability, e=\r\ntc, it /is/ flexible enough to be used in /all/ of your system, even withou=\r\nt convoluted zealotry!  However, we all acknowledge that a little library s=\r\nupport for RESTful patterns and idioms would go a long way to help.\n\nAnd, y=\r\nes, there may be instances where modelling verbs, actions, messages and com=\r\nmands is a little too declarative in an ROA, in the same way that modelling=\r\n nouns, resources, state and intentions is a little too imperative, too ope=\r\nration-driven, in an SOA.\n\nDuncan Cragg\n-- \nhttp://duncan-cragg.org/blog/\nh=\r\nttp://twitter.com/duncancragg\n \n\n\n\n"}}
