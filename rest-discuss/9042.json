Heintz wrote:\n&gt; Bill,\n&gt; \n&gt; You certainly could be right, but I don&#39;t understand how having a\n&gt; time-bounded lease would make systems any harder to formally describe\n&gt; (given systems can get disconnected anyway). \n\nThat&#39;s a very good point; I hadn&#39;t thought of modeling a lease expiry as \na failure. And I should say that in the case where a client &#39;sends&#39; a \nmessage in HTTPLR, you can have what I called &#39;phantoms&#39; which are open \nexchanges that won&#39;t complete because the client has for that exchange \n&quot;gone away&quot; and isn&#39;t coming back. I punted on that on the basis that \n(roughly) because you can GET the exchange, an admin could do something \nabout these, but it&#39;s a heuristic as to a) whether the client is coming \nback, b) how to do it on a given server. A lease arguably automates that \nby putting a constraint on the client to complete in a given timeframe.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
