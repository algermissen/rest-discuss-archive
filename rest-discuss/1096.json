The business entity can always summon \nup a representation of its current state.\n\nPermission for PUT and DELETE would be up to the resource, and may \ndepend on its current state (for example you can&#39;t delete the \nresource for an airline ticket after it&#39;s been issued, and even \ncancellation may invoke a penalty).\n\n-BH\n\n\n"}}
