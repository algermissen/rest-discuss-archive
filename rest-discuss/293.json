In addition, since the target is receiving\ninformation\n&gt; &gt; about the source, the target needs permissions to read from the source.\nAnd\n&gt; &gt; if the permissions change, then the &#39;route&#39; needs to be updated to\nreflect\n&gt; &gt; that - for example if Alice is denied permission to read the source, the\n&gt; &gt; route/subscription should be disabled (if you can&#39;t &#39;see&#39; a resource,\nyou\n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be able to &#39;hear&#39; it either). (you can argue that it should be\n&gt; &gt; deleted, but re-enabling permissions isn&#39;t going to tell you what\n&gt; &gt; subscriptions need to be re-created.)\n&gt; &gt; details details...\n&gt;\n&gt; All good thoughts.  For the most generic purposes, though, I think this is\nmore\n&gt; complexity than is required.  It takes the task out of the realm of simple\n&gt; authentication --- not of principal but of transaction --- and into a\nrealm of\n&gt; authentication + authorization.  (To clarify the distinction:\nauthentication\n&gt; is proving continuity of identity for some purpose, authorization is\ndeciding\n&gt; whether / proving that some authenticated principal has permission to do\n&gt; something.)\n&gt;\n&gt; With a scheme similar to the one I proposed, you&#39;re only doing the most\nbasic\n&gt; kind of authentication --- you&#39;re simply proving that the Subscriber event\nsink\n&gt; &quot;knows&quot; and (continuously) &quot;approves of&quot; the subscription that was\nrequested on\n&gt; its behalf.  With Mike&#39;s more sophisticated scheme, it seems that you need\nto\n&gt; introduce some notion of permissions and authorization vis-a-vis those\n&gt; permissions.  This may be useful or even necessary for some applications,\nbut\n&gt; IMO it&#39;s not really necessary for the most basic uses of HttpEvents.  And,\nit\n&gt; can be built on top of the simpler mechanism.\n&gt;\n\nYou are probably right. I wasn&#39;t intending that these authorization concepts\nbe visible in any message exchange - just that there are many applications\nof subscribing that need to take these issues into consideration. The\nminimal communication is just authentication aware. For example, when the\nsubscription is used to deliver an event, and the event server provided the\nauthentication credentials of the creator of the subscription, the receiver\nmay reject the events (401, etc) - the event server (as an intermediary) may\ndisable that subscription and perhaps echo that rejection back to the\nsubscriber so they can deal with the delivery error.\n\nIs an event server that we are talking about in reality an intermediary -\nwith issues of credential hand-off, etc.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
