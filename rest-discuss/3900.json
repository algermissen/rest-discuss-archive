In one, you POST an entry to an\nindex, which updates the index without necessarily changing the\nresource which it indexes.  In the other, you POST a message\nto a container, making the message subordinate to (and contained\nwithin) the container.\n\nIf the index above indexes the container above, it is likely that\nthat latter operation affects both resources (the index and the\ncontainer), as evidenced by later GETs.\n\nThe problem here is an ambiguity between a representation of\nthe container and the index resource itself.  Let me clarify.  If there\nwas only one URI in the system and it identified the container\nand you did a GET on it, it might be reasonable to call the served-\nup representation an &quot;index&quot; or &quot;directory&quot; of the container.\n\nStill assuming only that one URI, there is no defined operation\nfor POSTing to the index, because the index is a representation,\nnot a resource.  So although the resource is represented as an index,\nyou would still be POSTing to a container.\n\nYou can identify a resource which behaves as an index for the\ndesignated container, and you could allow it to proxy for the\ncontainer, handling POSTS as if it were the container itself, if you\nwant to.  This would be legal HTTP, because HTTP also allows\nresources to simply act as data processors, unconstrained by\nnotions of subordination, annotation and extension.\n\nBut I think I&#39;ve drifted off the subject.  The main point is not to\nconfuse the container resource&#39;s representation (an index) with\nsome other resource (an index) which may not be implemented,\nor which may be implemented with a semantics other than the\nproxy one I mentioned above.\n\n-Walden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Justin Sampson&quot; &lt;justin.sampson@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;rest-discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 13, 2003 3:54 AM\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] ReST vs MoST Messaging\n\n\n&gt; Alex Jacobson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The wording in HTTP is &quot;subordinate resource&quot;. Why can&#39;t a message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resource be &quot;subordinate&quot; to an index resource?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources. You\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; PUT a message somewhere else and then updating the index. You can add\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; entry to the index for a URL that does not currently resolve. In\n&gt; contrast,\n&gt; &gt; the only way to add a message to a container is... to add a message to\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; container, making the message subordinate to the container. Indexes\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; imply subordination. Containership does.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, you&#39;re using &quot;container&quot; as distinct from, say, &quot;collection&quot; in\n&gt; WebDAV.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s how directories work, right?  If I GET a directory, I expect\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hyperlinked list of its contents, not all the contents together in\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; archive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since HTTP URLs are hierarchical, an enumeration of all subordinate\n&gt; URLs\n&gt; &gt; is sufficient to communicate &quot;whatever information&quot; the directory URI\n&gt; &gt; designates.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Notably, because indexes don&#39;t themselves imply subordination of\n&gt; indexed\n&gt; &gt; resources, you can&#39;t take an index to imply that you add a file to a\n&gt; &gt; directory by POSTing to it. To get an entry to appear in the index,\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; must put a corresponding file in the directory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So you can view my objection to POSTing to Yannicks message indexes as\n&gt; &gt; equivalent to objecting to POSTing to directory URLs. The semantics\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t there to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP still leaves POST pretty open. As Yannick just quoted, RFC 2616\n&gt; says,\n&gt; &quot;The posted entity is subordinate to that URI in the same way that *a\n&gt; file\n&gt; is subordinate to a directory containing it*, a news article is\n&gt; subordinate\n&gt; to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a\n&gt; database&quot; (emphasis mine). But you&#39;re right that I wouldn&#39;t think of\n&gt; POSTing\n&gt; a file to a directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; Justin S.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
