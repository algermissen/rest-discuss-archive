WebDAV does indeed use new methods where \nnew resources may have worked as well, but that&#39;s a completely separate \nargument :-).\n\n&gt; URI proliferation is about multiple names for the same resource.\n&gt; I don’t understand how this applies to my proposed protocol\n&gt; design. From a REST point of view, URI starvation (where you\n&gt; don’t expose sufficient state as separate resources and overload\n&gt; aspects of other messages instead) is worse.\n\nYes.\n\nI&#39;m still not sure what the two-stage delete is good for in practice, \nbut if you want to be able to undo the first one, you better implement \nit internally by assigning a URI, and then allow to MOVE (gasp!) it back.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
