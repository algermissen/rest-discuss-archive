It was implemented\nas an HTTP proxy, and was also usable as a surrogate (reverse proxy).\n\n&gt; - since the remote host likely won&#39;t understand MONITOR, does your\n&gt;   proxy pull the resource in certain time intervals?\n\nIt first asks the origin server if it supports MONITOR, and if so passes\nit on.  If not, yes, it polls.\n\n&gt; - Most importantly: what is the format (DTD/schema/namespace/mime-type)\n&gt;   that the reply-to container accepts? Propably some RDF-Form might help\n&gt;   here ;-)  Or some additional &#39;Accept-Reply&#39; header?\n\nIIRC, I think we extended Accept semantics (ick!) to apply to the\neventual POST request to the Reply-To URI, rather than the response to\nthe MONITOR request.  That&#39;s obviously a hack though.\n\n&gt; Anyhow...very nice!\n\nThanks.  FWIW, MONITOR is going to be part of Waka;\n\n  http://gbiv.com/protocols/waka/\n\nand has also been discussed here several times.
