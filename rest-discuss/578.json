I just think we shouldn&#39;t necessarily specify listener\n&gt; management in the same context as just plain notifications.  With you all the way to (6)\n&gt; with the exception that we aren&#39;t assuming NOTIFY, we&#39;re assuming POST.\n\nI agree we should not be specifying listener\nmanagement.  That is why I want notification to be\na distinct method (so as not to get confused with\nwhatever listener management the client\nimplements).\n\nIf I understand you correctly, the only issue here\nis whether the new method should be one for the\nclient to update the state of the listener or\nwhether it should be to notify the listener of a\nchange to the subscribed resource.\n\nI think that it is more natural to use POST to\nmodify the listener (because we don&#39;t want to\nwrite a listener management spec).\n\nHowever, you don&#39;t like NOTIFY because it only\napplies to listener URLs and not all URLs are\nlistener URLs.\n\nSo, my question to you is whether all HTTP methods\nhave to apply to all resources.  The spec has\nvarious 50x status codes, like 501 Not Implemented\nor 503 Service Unavailable that I think make it OK\nto define methods that don&#39;t apply to all\nresources.\n\n&gt; &gt; 6. client requests changes by e.g.\n&gt; &gt;      http://intermediarty.com/getLogs?user=client\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Resource model alert!  I have no idea what this means. ;-)\n\nYeah.  Me neither.  My point is simply that the\nclient uses the intermediary to retrieve all of\nits notifications.  I am not trying to specify\nthat interface.  Just provide a simple example.\n\n&gt; &gt; 7. client decides that foo.com info is really\n&gt; &gt;    important and would like to be sent a page\n&gt; &gt;    when foo.com changes.  Client issues a POST\n&gt; &gt;    to\n&gt; &gt;      http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that this has to be something other than POST, as the POST on that resource\n&gt; indicates changes on http://foo.com.\n\nAs I said above, I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t use\nNOTIFY to indicate a change on http://foo.com\nand leave POST for the listener to manage itself\nin the normal HTTP way.\n(Otherwise you start defining a listener\nmanagement protocol)\n\n&gt; Can&#39;t assume NOTIFY.  It&#39;s a bad idea, because\n&gt; not all resources are listeners.\n\nSee above.  Why does that matter?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
