That is, they make it so\n&gt;  &gt; that there isn&#39;t enough information in the HTTP message to understand\n&gt;  &gt; what it does, because it depends on the information represented by\n&gt;  &gt; the cookie which is invisible to everybody but the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a nit. The second part of that sentence is true, but the first\n&gt; part is not the issue. Any individual HTTP message need not contain\n&gt; the state, let alone let you understand what it does.  The state\n&gt; should be contained in representations that are accessible via GET (or\n&gt; maybe POST).\n\nNo, the first part is the issue (though I could have chosen a better\nword than &quot;does&quot;).  You appear to be confusing &quot;stateful interaction&quot;\nwith &quot;stateful service&quot;.\n\nJust take a message, and ask yourself this question; &quot;Will this message\nmean the same thing in 20 years?&quot;.  If so, then that is stateless.  If\nyou use cookies with HTTP, then the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because the cookie\nwould have expired in that time, and that would change the meaning of\nthe message.\n\nNote that the &quot;meaning of the message&quot; is not the same as &quot;the result\nof the message being processed&quot;.  Obviously a message sent now, versus\nthe same one sent 20 years from now, will do something different.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
