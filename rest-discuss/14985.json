If you did not have this information, how would =\r\nyou then know what to do with the &quot;2010-03-04&quot; value?\n\n&gt; If both datasets h=\r\nave a &quot;peter&quot; blog, they should still have different\n&gt; atom:id&#39;s, so it&#39;s e=\r\nasy to create &quot;peter_a&quot; and &quot;peter_b&quot; resources.\n\nYes, I understand that. A=\r\nssuming we keep the original hostname, you could create new resources named=\r\n http://rest.mysite.com/blogs/peter_a and http://rest.mysite.com/blogs/pete=\r\nr_b based on the ATOM ids.\n\nBut what if I don&#39;t want to create a new resour=\r\nce &quot;space&quot; for the two companies? I want to keep the old http://rest.mysite=\r\n.com/feeds/peter and http://rest.anothersite.com/feeds/peter ... well, neve=\r\nr mind, I was trying to argue why a URI in a URI could be useful - not disc=\r\nus how to merge companies :-)\n\n&gt; BTW, your website must have this a priori =\r\nknowledge of the relationship,\n&gt; otherwise it can&#39;t instruct the client abo=\r\nut it.\n\nNot really. I could do a search for &quot;peter&quot; and get back a URL.\n\nTh=\r\ne search itself would of course be through the REST API and it could return=\r\n yet another ATOM feed of the search result (using open search for instance=\r\n).\n\nLets see what should be in the search result. Links! Certainly, but lin=\r\nks to what? It cannot return links to the www site since that would imply m=\r\ny REST API knew something about it&#39;s client. So it must return links to RES=\r\nT API resources. This mean we would get the REST API URL http://rest.mysite=\r\n.com/feeds/peter back.\n\nNow, what should my www site do with the http://res=\r\nt.mysite.com/feeds/peter URL in order to generate a browser link to itself =\r\nthat can display the feed? My www site knows nothing about the URL format, =\r\nso I has no way to figure out how to select &quot;peter&quot; and present a http://ww=\r\nw.mysite.com/blogs/peter URL to the end user. And here is my point: the onl=\r\ny thing the www site can do, is to include the full REST URL in the www URL=\r\n.\n\nYou could argue that the REST search should return both the complete res=\r\nource URL as well as the feed name &quot;peter&quot;. But then, again, the www site w=\r\nould have to know how to transform &quot;peter&quot; into the REST API URL http://res=\r\nt.mysite.com/feeds/peter.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
