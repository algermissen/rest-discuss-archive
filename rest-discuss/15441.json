Don&#39;t fight that--embrace caching instead (or\ndon&#39;t use REST if you=\r\n really really need small messages).\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve had a look at the Google APIs,=\r\n and Google has a &#39;fields&#39;\nparameter\n&gt; in the URL.  I&#39;ve had a go at implem=\r\nenting this, but it makes my\nlovely\n&gt; tidy RESTUL URLs look ugly and diffic=\r\nult to read/review.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, I&#39;m considering alternative options.  I coul=\r\nd put the fields\n&gt; attribute in the http header attributes instead of the U=\r\nRL.\n\nAllowing the client to configure which fields are returned sounds like=\r\n a\nrecipe for cache invalidation headaches galore.\n\n&gt; Alternatively, I coul=\r\nd analyse my application to determine the bare\n&gt; minimum set of fields that=\r\n meet the different UI requirements.\n\nThat analysis can only help--in my ex=\r\nperience, 9 times out of 10 you&#39;ll\nfind pretty clear boundaries between the=\r\n attribute sets, and you can go\non your merry way. That&#39;s one reason why I =\r\nput explicit support for\n&quot;attribute subsets&quot; (which I call &quot;fragments&quot;) in =\r\nthe Shoji Catalog\nProtocol [1]. Having that subsetting baked into the proto=\r\ncol constrains\nwhat cache entries you need to invalidate when the parent en=\r\ntity\nchanges. You might consider a similar constraint for your own API/medi=\r\na\ntypes.\n\nThe other one time out of 10, overlapping attribute sets are a &quot;r=\r\nesource\nsmell&quot; that will lead you to refactor your resources into a better\n=\r\ndesign.\n\n&gt; Another option would be to introduce a &#39;short&#39; boolean parameter=\r\n -\n&gt; that when true returns an agreed short set of fields, and when false\n&gt;=\r\n returns the full set.\n\nThat might be a reasonable solution, although you m=\r\night be better off in\nthat case just making a separate URL for the &quot;base se=\r\nt&quot; and another for\nthe &quot;extra data&quot;, omitting those fields which are in the=\r\n &quot;base set&quot;.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n[1] http://www.aminus.org=\r\n/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-01.txt\n\n"}}
