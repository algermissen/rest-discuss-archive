There\nare different extents to which a REST-based application will use HTTP\nmethods, but that doesn&#39;t mean the architectural style has two different\nsets of constraints.  The application is either obeying the REST\nconstraints or it is not, and POST in particular has the meaning\n&quot;process this&quot; regardless of how REST-compliant it may be because\nREST does not define the meaning of POST (HTTP does).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
