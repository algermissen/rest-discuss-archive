For example suppose that this is the URL to a Web service\nresource that returns a list of parts:\n\n    http://www.parts.com/parts\n\nNow suppose that you do an HTTP OPTIONS to that URL:\n\n    OPTIONS http://www.parts.com/parts\n\nand somehow you specify in the OPTIONS method &quot;give me the service\ndescription&quot;.  What do you expect to receive back?  Are you expecting to\nreceive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS\nresponse?  Let&#39;s assume that you do get the service description back as\nthe payload.  Fine.\n\nBut, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,\ne.g., \n\n    http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata\n\nHow would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?\n\nFurther, we would like to allow other people to independently provide\nmetadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink\nto my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your\ncompany wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF\ndescription of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go\noff and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here&#39;s\nyour URL:\n\n     http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata\n\nNow you need some way to link your service description back to the parts\nservice.  That&#39;s the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.\n\nTo recap, \n- we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate\nfrom the resource it is describing.\n- we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,\ni.e., distributed resource description\n- we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its\n(primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is\ndescribing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About\nHTTP headers, respectively.\n- we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata\nresources using standard HTTP GET.\n\nI hope that helps.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
