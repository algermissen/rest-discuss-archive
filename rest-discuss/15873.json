IOW, they allow for punctual experimentation and \n&gt; when they turn out to be useful, they should flow back into the \n&gt; type.\n\nIf the type cannot be extended, extensions cannot flow back because\nextensions cannot exist to begin with. I think the reasoning is\ncircular.\n\n\n&gt; At the very least, profile parameters \n&gt; should IMHO be used to make conneg explicit.\n\nPractical examples?\n\n \n\n&gt; The fact that a client chooses to interact with a \n&gt; certain resource is something that happens at the &#39;intent&#39;-level. If the goal \n&gt; is to submit an order, you turn to an order accepting resource, not \n&gt; just any resource. This decision and HTTP standard semantics should\n&gt; usually be enough to construct the request.\n\nIf the order method is uniform then media type does not need to signal\nit for the resource. If the order method is not uniform, then the media\ntype must somehow convey that intent beyond the uniform interface for\nthe resource according to your architectural technique.  Again I think\nthe reasoning is circular and the notion of an &#39;intent- level&#39; seems\nvery vague for a software intensive system unless you mean it&#39;s done out\nof band. \n\n\n&gt; Can you provide an example what WADL could describe at \n&gt; runtime that needs to be described?\n\nIgnoring the faux-Socratic technique and hence no sense of feeling\nobliged to provide an example - I have no clear idea what you&#39;re asking\nfor. \n\nBut let&#39;s say I can&#39;t provide one and there isn&#39;t anything WADL can\ndescribe &#39;at runtime&#39; - given the two ogical holes above, what would be\nthe point? \n\n\n&gt; &gt; Until such a time as the RDF singularity that is, although frankly\n&gt; &gt; TDF looks more and more like a better option than blocking the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;applications&#39; and the &#39;service under development&#39; on some non-existent\n&gt; &gt; &#39;standard&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think that in the case of AtomPub it would have been better to create an \n&gt; AtomService and have that service define and own the format?\n\nNo. And I suspect that doesn&#39;t help reduce your sense of ambivalence -\ntrue?\n\n\nBill\n\n\n"}}
