But no toolkit I can think of supports\n&gt; the RESTfull behaviour.\n\nConsider this dissension. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s specced for HTML and as a \nresult, the mod_python people have a reasonably behaving codebase in not \nsupporting forms over PUT. Further no toolkit ought to be required to \nsupport what you&#39;re looking for.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n\n"}}
