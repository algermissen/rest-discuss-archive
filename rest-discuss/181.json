It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; not clear to me that a generic subscription / notification mechanism justifies\n&gt; &gt; polluting the method space rather than just coming up with some generic\n&gt; &gt; conventions, nor is it clear that adding such a method will spur universal\n&gt; &gt; development and interoperability of async HTTP applications.  IMO, it&#39;s a losing\n&gt; &gt; proposition all the way around, compared to other alternatives.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its hard to believe, but I find myself in raging\n&gt; agreement with Jeff here.  A big reason why is\n&gt; the degree of control applications need over the\n&gt; meaning of change and the potential volume of data\n&gt; being transmitted.\n\nI agree that there must be a way for applications to implement\nfiltering. I don&#39;t think that means that the basic behaviour cannot be\nstandardized. When I &quot;PUT&quot; a purchase order, the HTTP spec. doesn&#39;t tell\nme what I should do once I get it. The basic model is that the thing is\navailable like a file for subsequent GETs. But a particular application\ncould do much more sophisticated stuff.\n\nAlso, how do I &quot;filter&quot; Google when I do a search? It doesn&#39;t return the\nwhole Google database, right? There are an essentially infinite number\nor URIs available. So what if you use query parameters to say that the\nresource you want to watch is one that only changes every fifteen\nminutes, or only changes when a price goes beyond a particular value.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
