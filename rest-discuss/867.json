Presumably, where necessary, one would use transient resources\n&gt; that expire when the workflow is complete, or a step in the workflow that\n&gt; invalidates this resource is taken. Would it make sense to have an archetype\n&gt; in the taxonomy for such resources?\n\nExcellent question.  Yes, I believe so.  It would be quite simple too,\nbasically;\n\n:Process rdfs:subClassOf :Container\n\nI just posted an XML based example of a workflow[1].
