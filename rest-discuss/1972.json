The puchase order, payments,\netc, are messages that change the state of the trade.\n\nThe trade can also contain at any one time, information that describes\nhow to make a valid state change from the current state. In other\nwords, it can contain information that allows the customer to\nacknowledge receipt of the item, or for the supplier to send the bill,\nor for either to cancel the trade.\n\nThe question that this raises in my mind is that if the &quot;trade&quot; is\naddressed through a single URI, how is the view of each party, the\nsupplier or the purchaser, restricted to the state changes that they\ncan make.\n\nBill\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
