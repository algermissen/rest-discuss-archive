I ask because using fragments such as &quot;not  \ntoo neutral&quot; seems to indicate there might be an issue with the chosen  \nword to begin with.  Maybe I&#39;ve spent too much time around Swiss  \ncolleagues and friends, but there is no such notion as &quot;too neutral.&quot;   \nSomeone/something either is neutral or it is not neutral (i.e. leaning  \ntowards one side or another, however discreetly).\n\nIIRC, the notion of &quot;neutral&quot; was introduced as an alternative to  \n&quot;generic.&quot;  If I rewrite your response above using &quot;generic&quot; instead,  \nwe get the following:\n&gt; &quot;Application generic&quot; is to be applied to all aspects of an  \n&gt; interface. All aspects should be as generic as possible (but not too  \n&gt; generic), not JUST the data and the data model.\n\nThis statement is something that my brain can understand in  \ngraduations: make the IFaPs too generic and your application will not  \nwork (insufficient information density); make them too specific (too  \nmuch information density) and only your application will understand  \nthem.  In other words, tune the IFaPs for the &quot;necessary and  \nsufficient&quot; amount of information density to optimize for long term  \nbenefits.  Now, let&#39;s see if this formulation also aligns with  \nexperience.\n\nThe terms &quot;generic&quot; and &quot;specific&quot; intuitively describe the spectrum  \nof information density from low to high, respectively.  In practice,  \nit is also the case that more generic formats or encodings require  \nmore bits than specific ones.  This aligns with the more formal  \ndefinition of information density as well (or entropy/complexity as it  \nis also referred to in the literature).\n\nLet&#39;s start with generic XML which has a negligible information  \ndensity.  It&#39;s technically non-zero, but if we only look at XML-based  \nformats, it&#39;s the lowest we can get.  The information density of the  \nIFaP increase with each additional constraint.  One measure for the  \neffective increase could be the inverse of the number of people who  \nunderstand it.  Thus, a constraint understood by nobody adds infinite  \ndensity, while one understood by everybody adds none.  With this  \ndefinition, adding HTTP as a constraint adds very little density.   \nAdding APP adds a bit more, and so on.\n\nNow, we can also see why optimizing for necessary and sufficient  \ndensity is the optimal solution.  It means that the IFaP can be  \nunderstood by the largest number of people while still meeting the  \nminimum application&#39;s requirements.  Interestingly, it also accounts  \nfor changes in popularity.  If a specialized format/protocol gains  \npopularity, using it will have a lower density increase.  Over time,  \nit may result in a lower density requirement for the application, and  \nthus it would make sense to switch over to the new format/protocol,  \nbecause it&#39;s more optimal.\n\nGetting back to the original point though.  Framing this discussion in  \nterms of graduations between &quot;generic&quot; and &quot;specific&quot; feels a lot more  \nintuitive than &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;too neutral.&quot;  The latter being a notion  \nthat my brain just refuses to comprehend for now.  Furthermore,  \n&quot;generic&quot; vs. &quot;specific&quot; nicely feeds into the notion of &quot;information  \ndensity,&quot; which we can use to turn what I believe to be your initial  \npoint into a semi-formal definition.  At first blush, this semi-formal  \ndefinition also aligns with the expected benefits of being as &quot;generic  \nas possible w/o being too generic.&quot;\n\nSo, I&#39;m back to where I started.  What is the motivation for using  \n&quot;neutral&quot; instead of &quot;generic?&quot;  Maybe it would make sense for  \n&quot;neutral&quot; to take on the meaning of optimal balance between generic  \nand specific IFaPs?\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
