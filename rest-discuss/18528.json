Both you and Ben seem to be saying the=\r\n same thing.. some sort of job queue resource. I probably should have added=\r\n that all of our API calls other than GETs are async. They return immediate=\r\nly.. so essentially our API becomes one big job queue. We also support call=\r\nbacks. Consumers register a URL with us that we then send notifications bac=\r\nk to. We will eventually support polling as well, and in doing so we&#39;ll nee=\r\nd to respond with resource IDs, and in some cases we do so that when we sen=\r\nd notifications via the callback to them, they can match up the request we =\r\nmake to their callback handler (with body) with the ID that they were given=\r\n when they made the async request to our API. IOW, some of our resources cr=\r\neate a resource to generate the id, send that back right away, then process=\r\n the bulk of the request in an EJB 3 async method. Some of our calls will r=\r\nequire possibly several seconds of time to process for one user and we\n don=\r\n&#39;t want to tie up the pipes.. some of them may even take minutes to days (a=\r\ngain..can&#39;t provide the details I wish I could..but it&#39;s possible they migh=\r\nt take some time before a response could be given back to the consumer).

I can send it to you and you could respond almost imme=\r\ndiately if you are there..but if you&#39;re not, you may respond with an auto-r=\r\neply immediately then send me an email later with more details. Anyway, I d=\r\no like the idea of a job queue of sorts.. primarily because it gives an act=\r\nual resource ID a consumer can then use to poll, and more so in our callbac=\r\nk scenario, associate with to a callback we send with an id they can use to=\r\n match to one they were given when they sent the initial request to us.

You can u=\r\nse these idempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodi=\r\nes to the server for processing of all kinds including comparing the data a=\r\ngainst data on the server, logging for later use, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I often &quot;model&quot;=\r\n actions such as &quot;login&quot;, &quot;ticket request&quot;, &quot;queue up a job&quot;, etc. as a &quot;wr=\r\nite-record&quot; pattern. IOW, if you attempt to log into the server, I might lo=\r\ng the action (date, time, username, other context data) for later audit rev=\r\niew. When I do this, it makes good sense to use a POST w/ body to send the =\r\ndata. These actions often result in a new &quot;resource&quot; which hold the results=\r\n of the attempt (&quot;here&#39;s your ticket&quot;, &quot;you job has been added to the queue=\r\n&quot;, etc.) and sometimes this resource will be updated/refreshed over the lif=\r\ne of the job, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that would fit your scenario just fine. you=\r\n need not save all the data sent by the user (i.e. password, etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;m=\r\nca\n&gt;http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;http://twitter.com@mamund\n&gt;http://mamund.com=\r\n/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tue, Feb 7, 2012 at 14:47, Kevin Duffey &lt;andjarn=\r\nic@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am trying to do the best=\r\n I can for our API needs to avoid making some REST calls basically be RPC c=\r\nalls. I can&#39;t explain in detail regarding the company I work for as we&#39;re s=\r\ntill in stealth/startup mode so I&#39;ll do the best I can to make sense.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;Our API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to &quot;scrape&quot; some web sites. Basically we pu=\r\nll down a sites login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed t=\r\no us, and attempt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not =\r\ntrying to randomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of o=\r\nur API will ask their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a RES=\r\nT call and we&#39;ll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending back=\r\n a response to the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far as I=\r\n can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on our =\r\nserver side. It&#39;s basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to tr=\r\ny validating user credentials for different services. The consumer gets the=\r\n benefit of being able to avoid having to do the page scraping and/or using=\r\n other service APIs..they just use our one API and specify the service and =\r\npass the credentials. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The problem is.. we cant use GET since yo=\r\nu can&#39;t pass a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but that seem=\r\ns hacky to me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in credentia=\r\nls (possibly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above, we&#39;re no=\r\nt storing these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we&#39;re me=\r\nrely checking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service selec=\r\nted (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag=\r\n of whether or not the creds worked changes..but that&#39;s not really the reso=\r\nurce.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So I am asking you experts.. how is something like this done =\r\nvia REST? I know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve read the past few years, I fit t=\r\nhat mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially if the commu=\r\nnity was &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax with the ease of REST calls, I wou=\r\nld be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the community balks at using =\r\nREST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am left to figuring out if=\r\n there is some way to do this with REST. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Feel free to slap me a=\r\nround a bit if I am completely missing some key points about using REST. I =\r\nthink I have a pretty good understanding of it, but no doubt there is room =\r\nto learn.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thank you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\r\n---781490481-1710801017-1328649124=:83633\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;t=\r\nab&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the replies.

These actions often result in=\r\n a new &quot;resource&quot; which hold the results of the attempt (&quot;here&#39;s your ticke=\r\nt&quot;, &quot;you job has been added to the queue&quot;, etc.) and sometimes this resourc=\r\ne will be updated/refreshed over the life of the job, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font f=\r\nace=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;I think that would fit your scenario j=\r\nust fine. you need not save all the data sent by the user (i.e. password, e=\r\ntc.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;mca&lt;br&gt;http://amundsen.com/blog/&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;http://twitter.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;@mamund&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://mam=\r\nund.com/foaf.rdf#me&quot;&gt;http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv652993450gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Feb 7, 2012 at 14:47, Kevin =\r\nDuffey &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:andjarni=\r\nc@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:andjarnic@...&quot;&gt;andjarni=\r\nc@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yiv652993450gmail=\r\n_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:=\r\n1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;=\r\nfont-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi all,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am trying to do the best I can for our API needs to avoi=\r\nd making some REST calls basically be RPC calls. I can&#39;t explain in detail =\r\nregarding the company I work for as we&#39;re still in stealth/startup mode so =\r\nI&#39;ll do the best I can to make sense.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our API use=\r\ns HtmlUnit (Java) to &quot;scrape&quot; some web sites. Basically we pull down a site=\r\ns login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed to us, and atte=\r\nmpt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not trying to rand=\r\nomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of our API will as=\r\nk their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a REST call and we&#39;=\r\nll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending back a response to=\r\n the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far as I can tell\n thi=\r\ns does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on our server side. =\r\nIt&#39;s basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API to try validating =\r\nuser credentials for different services. The consumer gets the benefit of b=\r\neing able to avoid having to do the page scraping and/or using other servic=\r\ne APIs..they just use our one API and specify the service and pass the cred=\r\nentials. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is.. we cant use GET si=\r\nnce you can&#39;t pass a body. I thought of query params for the creds, but tha=\r\nt seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the logical method to use, passing in cre=\r\ndentials (possibly other values too) in the body. Only, as I said above, we=\r\n&#39;re not storing these values, changing any data on our API server side.. we=\r\n&#39;re merely checking to see if what was sent to our API works at the service=\r\n selected (lets say yahoo, gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolea=\r\nn flag of whether or not the creds worked changes..but that&#39;s not\n really t=\r\nhe resource.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I am asking you experts.. how is s=\r\nomething like this done via REST? I know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve read the=\r\n past few years, I fit that mold of those trying to turn an RPC into REST. =\r\nEssentially if the community was &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax with the e=\r\nase of REST calls, I would be ok with this. Because it seems a lot of the c=\r\nommunity balks at using REST in lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am=\r\n left to figuring out if there is some way to do this with REST. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely m=\r\nissing some key points about using REST. I think I have a pretty good under=\r\nstanding of it, but no doubt there is room to learn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left=\r\n:2px solid rgb(16,16,255);margin-left:5px;margin-top:5px;padding-left:5px;&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-si=\r\nze:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---781490481-1710801017-1328649124=:83633--\r\n\n"}}
