It=\r\n&#39;s perfectly okay to\n&gt; map it as a redirect from a GET - that entities retu=\r\nrned from  \n&gt; resources\n&gt; change over time is one of the inherent features =\r\nof REST and this can\n&gt; just as easily be between every single request as it=\r\n can over more\n&gt; clearly marked times of modification.\n\nWhat initially irri=\r\ntated me (and still does so) was the consideration  \nthat GET has to be ide=\r\nmpotent. I had the impression that redirecting  \nto different locations wou=\r\nld mean issuing entirely different  \nresponses (and thus violating GETs ide=\r\nmpontence). I suppose I&#39;ve been  \nwrong on this? But what&#39;s the meaning of =\r\nidempotence than in this case?\n\n&gt; Hence a 307 Temporary Redirect from the &quot;=\r\ndice&quot; resource would be\n&gt; apposite. Note that by default 307 responses are =\r\nnot cacheable (which\n&gt; suits your purposes) though there is nothing to stop=\r\n the target of the\n&gt; redirect being cached (which is a good thing, if chanc=\r\ne does mean a\n&gt; repeat on the dice there&#39;s no reason why the cache shouldn&#39;=\r\nt be used).\n\nDo you also agree with the 302 Found response that Alan propos=\r\ned?  \nLooking at the HTTP spec, am I right that there&#39;s no difference  \nbet=\r\nween these both responses as far as GET requests are concerned?\n\n&gt; If you n=\r\need to guard against cheating then a different model would be\n&gt; required be=\r\nyond a purely simple 307.\n\nNo, cheating is not a design consideration right=\r\n now.\n\nThanks again for answering!\n\n\n-- \nsven fuchs\t\t\tfon:  +49 (58 45) 98 =\r\n89 58\nartweb design\t\t\tfax:  +49 (58 45) 98 89 57\nbreite stra=DFe 65\t\twww: h=\r\nttp://www.artweb-design.de\nde-29468 bergen\t\tmail: svenfuchs@artweb-design.d=\r\ne\n\n\n\n"}}
