When\n&gt; the user executes the drop, the script will concatenate the name of\n&gt; the box image and the name of the creature image and update the src\n&gt; attribute of the box image:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;animal_fish.png&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;veggie_granite.png&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Upon receiving the GET request for the &quot;new&quot; image, the server can\n&gt; use rules on the server to evaulate the validity of the URI and\n&gt; return the proper response.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example:\n&gt; GET /animal_fish.png could return 200 OK and an image that indicating\n&gt; success (green check mark)\n&gt; but\n&gt; GET /veggie_granite.png could return 404 Not Found and an image\n&gt; indicating failure (a red X)\n\nThat&#39;s too late. I don&#39;t want to annoy users by indicating failure of an \noperation that wasn&#39;t going to succeed to begin with. That is, I don&#39;t \nwant to tell the user that their drag & drop failed, rather, as soon as \nthey start to drag, I want to indicate where they might drop with a very \nlarge chance of success (modulo actions of concurrent users).\n\nAs I wrote in response to Darrell, it won&#39;t work to ask for all possible \ntargets for award assignment as there are too many of them. The client \ndoes know about an eligible subset, but the server does not. The client \nhas its own state, unknown to the server, and that&#39;s as it should be, in \ngeneral, as long as the conversational state is maintained through \nnavigational requests following links.\n\nYou may compare this technical problem to a human conversation. It is \nthe difference between asking the waiter to recount the entire menu vs. \nasking whether two specific dishes are available.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
