We just use an existing library, and\n&gt; cut and paste from the sample code that came with the library documentation.\n\nAha! So what you are lacking is sample code and documentation. That&#39;s\nvery different than a toolkit.\n\n&gt; SOAP/XML-RPC/CORBA etc. all come as pre-packaged bundles, both\n&gt; physically and conceptually. You import the library, read +cut+paste the\n&gt; docs, and return a nicely massaged array or whatever. Then you and your\n&gt; boss go home, on time, happy.\n\nSOAP doesn&#39;t work that way if you actually want to get any of the\nbenefits described for it (loose coupling, asynchronous sends, etc.).\nBut if you just want to use it as a new-fangled, less-powerful CORBA,\nthen sure. Against the recommendations of everyone who understands SOAP\nyou can use the Visual Studio wizards out of the box and get\ntightly-coupled web service without support for references or pointers.\n\n&gt; With REST, you have to independently research all the pieces and grok\n&gt; the concepts, then find an appropriate library that provides\n&gt; GET,POST,PUT etc. e.g. a default PHP install will *probably* only\n&gt; include GET functionality (unless you build something up from the basic\n&gt; socket functions, or include something like CURL - which doesn&#39;t mention\n&gt; REST anywhere in it&#39;s docs). \n\nI don&#39;t believe that PHP is really that limited. The method that comes\nin should be encoded as a CGI environment variable. And PHP can make\noutbound HTTP requests out with any method.\n\n&gt; .... Then you have to parse the page returned,\n&gt; which might mean having to learn DOM/SAX/REGEXP.\n\nIf you want the benefits of XML you have to learn some XML processing\ntechnology. I have some ideas about XML serialization/deserializtin\ntechniques that are easier in some ways than the stanard techniques, but\nit doesn&#39;t save you from learning anything whatsoever. In Web Services\ntechnology that hides the XML from you (XML-RPC, VS.NET) is hiding your\nbest hope for extensibility.\n\n&gt; No, it isn&#39;t really hard (except the &#39;groking REST&#39; part ;), but it\n&gt; requires more time, more initiative and more brave, independent thought\n&gt; (explain to your boss why you don&#39;t want to use this &#39;Industry Standard&#39;\n&gt; SOAP thing and want to &#39;make up&#39; your own interface)\n\nThere&#39;s no doubt. REST will not be easy to sell to your boss until it is\nclear that SOAP is either easy or extensible, but not both, and scarcely\ninteroperable.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to get into a debate on the state of the industry/IT\n&gt; training, just observing human nature as I see it. If people have the\n&gt; option of being spoon-fed, they will go for it, regardless of what is on\n&gt; the spoon.\n\nI certainly agree.\n\n&gt; Based on this, the idea of creating a sample &quot;REST Library&quot; might be a\n&gt; good one?\n&gt; 1, It would theoretically be very simple to implement - just wrappers\n&gt; round existing functions (the debate would probably take longer than the\n&gt; writing ;)\n\nI have a few concerns with your proposal:\n\n 1. Duplicating the &quot;toolkit&quot; in .NET, Java, PHP, etc. is a bunch of\nwork. They all have their own ways of dealing with XML and HTTP. And\nwrapping them consistently will hide whatever virtues each platform has.\n\n 2. Whatever environment we left out would feel like it &quot;couldn&#39;t do&quot;\nREST until they were given a toolkit. I&#39;d rather teach people that they\nare not dependent.\n\n 3. I don&#39;t have a clear picture of what the toolkit looks like because\nit really is the sum of the platform&#39;s HTTP capabilities plus the\nplatform&#39;s XML capabilities.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; 5, I find there is nothing like actually building something to show up\n&gt; the potential holes and pitfalls that people might fall into. Very Useful!\n\nSure, we need more demos and documentation. We need people using many\ndifferent platforms to make wildly varying REST apps, using wildly\nvarying tools and techniques. There was no one toolkit for the HTML web\nand I don&#39;t think there will be one for the XML Web.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
