wrote:\n&gt; Hi all:\n&gt;\n&gt; To start, this is not about the &quot;Is REST=CRUD?&quot; debate.  This is me asking\n&gt; how to create a typical CRUD module for a web application that is RESTful.\n&gt; And forgive the fact that this has probably already been answered 1000 times\n&gt; before; if it has I haven&#39;t seen it.\n&gt;\n&gt; What started this was someone asked the following on the TurboGears list:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been refactoring my admin interface and trying to get it\n&gt; &gt; nice and RESTful ( oh the buzzwords! ). As I am new to this\n&gt; &gt; resting business, I&#39;m wondering, is there a compelling reason\n&gt; &gt; to need to do:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; page/7/edit\n&gt; &gt; vs\n&gt; &gt; page/edit/7\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The example in the book uses the first, but I&#39;m finding the\n&gt; &gt; second would be much easier to do with CherryPy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks helpful gurus!\n&gt;\n&gt; Several people replied with mechanics of TurboGears but nobody mentioned the\n&gt; use of the edit verb so I decided to clarify and then realized that, while I\n&gt; could tell him what not to do (i.e. &quot;don&#39;t use verbs&quot;), I couldn&#39;t tell him\n&gt; how to do it correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the past when I have written such modules I would typically write them\n&gt; like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;         http://examples.com/pages/{page_id}/?mode={mode}\n&gt;\n&gt; Where {mode} was one of:\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;nothing&gt;\n&gt;         add\n&gt;         insert\n&gt;         edit\n&gt;         update\n&gt;         list\n&gt;         delete\n&gt;         confirm\n&gt;\n&gt; And maybe a few more.  BTW, these are not that &quot;well designed&quot; URLs, but\n&gt; it&#39;s how I coded before I heavily researched URL concepts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that there are several interesting pairs: &quot;add&quot; and &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;update&quot;, and &quot;delete&quot; and &quot;confirm&quot;   Both &quot;add&quot; and &quot;edit&quot; displayed a\n&gt; data entry form whereas &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;update&quot; insert and update from those\n&gt; forms, respectively, with the latter 302 redirecting to &lt;nothing&gt; (a.k.a.\n&gt; &quot;show&quot;)  and &quot;confirm&quot; displaying a delete confirmation screen with &quot;delete&quot;\n&gt; performing the actual delete and 301 redirecting to &quot;page/list&quot;  And when\n&gt; &quot;add&quot; mode was requested it contained {mode} as a hidden field with a value\n&gt; of &quot;insert.&quot; When &quot;edit&quot; mode was requested, the hidden {mode} fields got a\n&gt; value of &quot;update.&quot;  It all works well and good, but I now understand its not\n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt; To be RESTful, we GET &quot;page/{page_id}&quot; for display, PUT to &quot;page/{page_id}&quot;\n&gt; for an update, DELETE &quot;page/{page_id}&quot; for a delete, and GET &quot;page/list&quot; for\n&gt; a list. But how do we deal with getting an edit form before the PUT?  How do\n&gt; we handle delete confirmation?  How do we handle requesting a data entry\n&gt; form designed for a new page (POST to &quot;page/new&quot;?)   Answer both assuming\n&gt; AJAX and also no AJAX, if you will.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S.
