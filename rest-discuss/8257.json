I was \n&gt; talking abstractly in that Amazon.com stores your shopping cart items \n&gt; in a database.  It is the restoration of the database records that is \n&gt; not RESTful.\n\nErmmm....\n\n\n\n\n&gt; But the state (namely, your shopping cart) IS stored on the server.\n\nBut it&#39;s not stored as a resource. It&#39;s hidden. Or at least the\ninteractions with it are.\n\n\n\n&gt; I searched the list and found an example.  It used cookies, but more \n&gt; interestingly was the response by Roy T. Fielding.  It makes some \n&gt; mention of how customization on the web (personalization) is not \n&gt; RESTful.\n\nNot so. Personalization can be done RESTfully. I think you\nmisunderstood Roy.\n\n\n&gt; Thank you for the resource pointers.  It has helped me gain a better \n&gt; understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; As in the shopping cart example, to be truly RESTful, \n\nWhoa Nelly! Don&#39;t go down that road.\n\nThere is no &quot;truly RESTfull&quot;. REST is more like the pirate code, just\nguidelines. Using RESTfull principles can make your app more\nscalable more cost effectively.\n\n\n&gt; 1. User browses to store site\n&gt; 2. User adds an item (GET http://store.com/cart/item/?id=5)\n&gt; 3. The server responds with another page which has each link \n&gt; reference the fact the user has item 5 in their shopping cart.\n&gt; 4. The user browses to another page (again, carrying with it the \n&gt; state that it has item 5 in the cart).\n&gt; 5. The user adds another item (http://store.com/cart/item/?id=5&id=9\n&gt; 6. The server responds with another page which has each link \n&gt; reference the face the user now has item 5 and item 9 in their \n&gt; shopping cart.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t sound right. You seem to be using GET to alter state\nwhich is a big no no, not just in REST but more generally.\n\nHow about:\n\n1. nic browses to store site\n2. nic hits &quot;buy me&quot; button on book about Orcas\n3. AJAX sends a POST with the book url to /nicferrier/basket\n4. nic browses to another page\n5. nic hits &quot;but me&quot; button on sandwich toaster\n6. AJAX sends a POST with the sandwich toaster url to /nicferrier/basket\n\nWhen I want to look at my shopping basket I can just:\n\n  GET /nicferrier/shoppingbasket\n\nWell. This isn&#39;t much different from what you can do with\ncookies. There are benefits that REST has given you:\n\n1. it is more scalable because now everybody&#39;s shopping basket can be\nmoved from server to server... 1 per server if you really wanted\n\n2. it enables shared shopping baskets - something that\ncookies/sessions really have trouble doing unless they are serialized\nto a single point (which is bad for latency reasons).\n\n\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t this be a RESTful shopping cart?  There are many pitfalls of \n&gt; course in this example (user goes to another computer, or browser \n&gt; does not maintain cache, bandwidth when user has many items in \n&gt; shopping cart, etc).  However, it is scalable because it would not \n&gt; matter what server the request goes to, the request contains the \n&gt; state of the users shopping cart and is therefore RESTful.\n\nNo... it wouldn&#39;t be RESTfull particularly I don&#39;t think. The state is\nstored in the URLs. This is just like a form of URL re-writing with\nsession IDs.\n\nThe trouble with that is that it makes the site difficult to cache by\nproxies and other intermediaries. This is a big deal because such\nthings are a key way to cope with disconnectedness.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
