If it is a &quot;blind&quot; toggle then it is like the pull\nhandle of a slot machine. And I agree with you and Mike for a POST in\nthat case.\n\nCheers,\n\nDong\n\nOn Wed, Jul 9, 2014 at 10:52 AM, Erik Wilde &lt;dret@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hello dong.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2014-07-09, 16:46 , Dong Liu wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I assume it is like a push button with no up/down or in/out lock.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; exactly. and as such, the button itself does not have a state. you can\n&gt; activate it, and it will toggle stuff. it probably would make a lot of sense\n&gt; to make that activation non-idempotent, and i think mike has pointed that\n&gt; out already.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anytime you push it and release, the state switches to the opposite of\n&gt;&gt; what you see. Robby was concerned about &quot; both the overhead\n&gt;&gt; and latency this entails as well as the potential for a race condition\n&gt;&gt; (what if /state changes between the GET and the PUT?)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; i don&#39;t think PUT is a good model for a toggle service, as there&#39;s no state\n&gt; to PUT. toggle inherently has race conditions, and if you don&#39;t like them,\n&gt; then maybe toggle is not a service you should provide. just provide the\n&gt; usual GET/PUT on the resource itself, and get rid of the toggle resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; dret.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; erik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n&gt;            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n&gt;            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
