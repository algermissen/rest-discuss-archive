An example is 2PC transaction management.  Still,  \n&gt; these\n&gt; services can benefit from having their distributed interface defined\n&gt; RESTfully.  The nomenclature will be RESTful Service vs. RESTful  \n&gt; Interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; * 2PC transactions would be considered a RESTful interface under\n&gt; REST-*.org.  Meaning using it makes your stuff less-RESTful, but at\n&gt; least the service has a restful interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; * Messaging, compensations, and workflow services would be considered\n&gt; &quot;RESTful Services&quot; that fit in the model.\n&gt;\n&gt; __GUIDELINES SECTION__\n&gt;\n&gt; This is where I want to talk about how existing patterns, RFC&#39;s and  \n&gt; such\n&gt; fit in with the rest of what we&#39;re doing.  An example here could be\n&gt; Security.  What authentication models are good when?  When should you\n&gt; use OAuth and OpenID?  How could something like OAuth interact with\n&gt; middleware services?\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of this stuff is already up on the website. (You may have to  \n&gt; reload\n&gt; it to see it due to cache-control policies.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, apologies for the jboss.org redirection.
