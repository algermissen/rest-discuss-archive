Don&#39;t know if my interpretation of Roy&#39;s thesis(*) is right\n&gt; then.  My reading was that &#39;scalability&#39; meant the quantity of clients\n&gt; that a single server can handle.\n\nFor me - and this isn&#39;t directly reflecting the wording in The Thesis (tm) -\nscalability has technology aspects and social/organizational aspects. Pure\nperformance, number of clients or &#39;participating nodes&#39;, amount of data,\ndiffering data types, etc. are some of the technical scalability areas,\nwhereas the number of organizational domains that can participate in another\naspect of scalability.\n\nAnyway... as long as multiple messages on one connection is a performance\nenhancement, rather than a requirement for basic functionality, I&#39;m not too\nworried about it.\n\nAs a note - which you are probably familiar with - it&#39;s not too difficult to\nget on the order of 10K concurrent connections on a good size machine. This\nisn&#39;t the same as 10K full-bore, saturated data streams, but it is a\nboundary condition to be aware of.\n\n"}}
