In=\r\n Dream, a \nservice is to a blueprint what an instance is to a class in \nOOP=\r\n.  In general, the relationship is 1-to-1 in that each \nservice is manifest=\r\ned by an instance, but this is neither \nenforced, nor mandated.\n* A feature=\r\n is a relative URI + HTTP method that has \nbehavior.  The OOP equivalent wo=\r\nuld be an instance method.\n* A signature is the relative URI identifying th=\r\ne feature. A \nsignature can also contain wildcards for path-parameters.\n* A=\r\n verb is the HTTP method used on the URI.\n* A method is an instance method.=\r\n\n\n\nA blueprint is registered with a host so that services of its \nkind can =\r\nbe created.  The blueprint describes the features of \nthe service in terms =\r\nof relative URIs since it can&#39;t know \nwhere a service will be anchored.\n\nSo=\r\n, let&#39;s assume we create an instance of the \nEightBallService at http://mys=\r\nerver/8ball.\n\nThe above blueprint now states that you can do the following =\r\n\noperations.\n\nGET http://myserver/8ball/answer\n-&gt; returns an answer\n\nGET ht=\r\ntp://myserver/8ball/@config\n-&gt; returns configuration information about this=\r\n service (who is the\nhost, what is the blueprint, etc.)\n\nGET http://myserve=\r\nr/8ball/@inspect\n-&gt; uses the service blueprint to show a human readable des=\r\ncription of\nall the features on the service with links to additional docume=\r\nntation\n\nDELETE http://myserver/8ball\n-&gt; stops and deletes the service\n\n\nSo=\r\n, in essence, the parts in between the &lt;method&gt; tags don&#39;t \nmatter to outsi=\r\nde consumers since they represent \nimplementation details just like the &lt;cl=\r\nass&gt; tag, but I can \ncertainly see how they can cause confusion.  Unfortuna=\r\ntely \nthe host needs these details and splitting them across \ninterface and=\r\n implementation sub-sections felt overkill.\n\nI hope the above explanation m=\r\nakes sense.  Let me know what \nyour thoughts are.  I&#39;m eager to learn how t=\r\no make this \nbetter or explain it better.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n- Steve\n\n\n"}}
