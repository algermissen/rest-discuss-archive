Seriously.  But I&#39;ll try.\n\nIt&#39;s far easier to develop interoperably for the web than for the desktop.\nWhy do you think that is?  HTTP, content-types, etc. Basically: REST.  IMHO,\nanyway. ;)\n\nInteroperability on desktop apps is not great just as SOAP webservice\ninteroperability is not great.  Using REST principles applied judiciously to\nthe desktop could bring the same interoperability we see on the web to the\ndesktop.  Secondly, I&#39;m always, always, always pining for some way to go\nback to a particular (course grained) point in an application.  Having that\npoint available in an LRL (Local Resource Locator) would be wonderful, just\nlike having a path I can copy and paste from Windows Explorer to file open\ndialogs is wonderful.  Thirdly it could unify the desktop and the web and\neliminate the (in the future more and more) arbitrary distinction between\nlocal and Internet.\n\n&gt; &gt; I use Windows and on\n&gt; &gt; Windows the closest thing to it (besides the browser itself) is \n&gt; &gt; Windows Explorer when &quot;Display full path in title bar&quot; is turned on.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m completely missing the connection here.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s something similar to a REST view in some of the more \n&gt; recent windows views on folders where they use hypermedia to \n&gt; link to related objects but that&#39;s one tiny piece of \n&gt; hypermedia-style navigation that is more reminiscient to REST \n&gt; than actually RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see how the full path in title bar helps.\n\nThe path in the title bar is analogous to the URL that one can save and/or\ncopy from one context and paste into another.  If I want to go to the\nc:&#92;foo&#92;bar&#92;baz&#92;wa&#92;zoo directory I don&#39;t have to click, click, click, click,\nclick to get there, I can cut & paste a saved URL, or just select one from\nhistory and Windows Explorer takes me right there.  I really wish I had such\na thing in my email client, for example.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\nP.S. Please note that I&#39;ve just been musing on this subject for a while.\nMaybe I&#39;m totally off-based.  I could well be.  I dunno.  It just seems like\na good idea right now.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
