If you want to take\nadvantage of REST architectural strengths like caching or conneg, then\nthere&#39;s only one protocol which supports it worth speaking of, and that\nis, of course, HTTP 1.1 -- no other well-known protocol has these\nfeatures.  You can build a REST system using FTP if you want, but it\nwon&#39;t scale like HTTP, even with less overhead.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; When doing small-scale internal services, I still find a RESTful\n&gt; architecture still useful, however, the overhead of HTTP seems to be\n&gt; noticable. I was wondering if there widely used alternatives that\n&gt; focus on performance in the same manner that some RPC tools do\n&gt; (Protocol Buffer, Thrift).\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve only very recently been pointed to NetKernel and NetKernel\nProtocol.  Perhaps this is what you&#39;re after?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, on media-types, are there well-known media types that are\n&gt; relatively cheap to parse? For one, I&#39;m keeping my eye on\n&gt; BSON:http://bsonspec.org/ as an alternative to JSON.\n&gt; \n\nNot that I know of; however, parse efficiency isn&#39;t a REST concern.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
