One in the context of relevant RFCs (such as for\n&gt; MIME, which you note merely discourages use of unregistered types)\n&gt; where actual conformance criteria exist, and the other in the context\n&gt; of REST.  REST, as an architectural style, doesn&#39;t really have\n&gt; &quot;violations&quot;\n&gt;\n\nSure it does.  Using cookies to store application state, clearly goes\nagainst REST.  Whether that&#39;s called a mismatch, a violation, or a\nfailure to implement a constraint, is just debating semantics.  Using\nan opaque, unregistered media type identifier can&#39;t even remotely be\nconsidered RESTful, because REST constrains messaging to be self-\ndescriptive.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - there are approaches which look more like the style, and approaches\n&gt; that look less so.  The word &quot;violation&quot; completely undercuts your\n&gt; argument, as REST (as described by Roy), as near as I can tell never\n&gt; embraces the notion that &quot;conformance&quot; exists.  Nor can it, so far as\n&gt; I can tell, because as a style, it is at least two levels of\n&gt; abstraction removed from actual design/implementation.\n&gt; \n\nTo quote Roy:  &quot;What needs to be done to make the REST architectural\nstyle clear on the notion that hypertext is a constraint? In other\nwords, if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not\nbeing driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a\nREST API. Period. Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to\nbe fixed?&quot;\n\nClearly, then, Roy believes that failing to meet a constraint (in this\ncase, the hypertext constraint) means the system cannot be RESTful.  I\nconstantly emphasize that REST is a tool for guiding the long-term\nevolution of a system.  A system may not meet all of REST&#39;s constraints\nwhen introduced, but REST provides the means to identify mismatches,\nwhich can then be dealt with over time (unless they aren&#39;t recognized\nas such).  The long-term goal is conformance with the constraints of\nREST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, absolutely yes. REST has a constraint called &quot;self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; messaging&quot; which can&#39;t be met if nobody can look up your media type\n&gt; &gt; identifier. REST is not based on opaque, anything-goes strings as\n&gt; &gt; media type identifiers. REST *is* based on self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; messaging where anyone can figure out what your media type\n&gt; &gt; identifier means, because its presence in the IANA registry makes\n&gt; &gt; it transparent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought of mentioning this before, but with the onslaught of mobile\n&gt; applications, we have the perfect situation for those applications to\n&gt; develop new media types without first getting an IANA registration. \n&gt; Specifications are frequently in development for *years* before the\n&gt; registration might be finalized, so the notion that early versions of\n&gt; those specifications cannot be used across the internet, to figure out\n&gt; how well/poorly they actually work, is just silly.\n&gt; \n\nI agree.  I also never said anything along the lines of, &quot;Thou shalt\nnot use unregistered media types.&quot;  The point is, that until the media\ntype identifier is common knowledge it isn&#39;t part of a uniform\ninterface.  Early adoption of Atom meant using an early form of media\ntype identifier -- these still aren&#39;t RESTful to use.  Once Atom was\nfinalized, it included a new media type identifier, systems using that\nidentifier once it evolved to refer to a standard never violated the\nself-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree transparency is good.  Your strawman seems to be that this\n&gt; must mean IANA registration, which is a separate question, and REST is\n&gt; certainly not restricted to those.\n&gt; \n\nREST unequivocally requires self-descriptive messaging.  Simply put,\nthis means that media type identifiers must be registered somewhere.\nIn Gopher, identifiers are baked into the spec.  In HTTP, the IANA\nregistry is baked into the spec.  Whatever protocol you choose to\ninstantiate REST must support the notion of self-descriptive messaging.\nIf you&#39;re using HTTP, the _only_ way to meet that constraint is by\nusing IANA-registered media type identifiers, because no other\nmechanism is defined for correlating identifiers to media types.\n\nREST is not based on opaque identifiers only understood by producer and\nconsumer, it is based on re-using identifiers that are commonly\nunderstood by all parties to the communication, including\nintermediaries.  If your REST system uses HTTP over the Internet, then\nthere is no exception to using IANA-registered types -- there is simply\nno other way to meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
