Aren&#39;t humans interested in orders?  I&#39;ve seen hundreds of e-\ncommerce interfaces which prove that orders can be modeled as HTML.\n\nWhile I think you&#39;re on the right track by stating that your custom\nmedia type can be used within atom:content, to gain the benefits of\nAtom&#39;s standard semantics, link relations and processing model, you&#39;ll\nstill need some sort of hypertext control API which instructs user\nagents how to interact with orders if you need to use methods beyond\nGET.\n\nAllowing DELETE on those Atom resources by user agents that &quot;just know&quot;\nyour resource type can be deleted, isn&#39;t the same as providing a\nhypertext control which allows one or more resources to be selected\nfrom a list, and deleted one-at-a-time or as a batch by instructing the\nuser agent what resource or resources need what method called to\nachieve that goal.\n\nAtom Protocol doesn&#39;t define DELETE on collection resources.  How does\nyour system handle DELETE on collection resources?  More importantly,\nhow do I know how your system handles DELETE on collection resources,\nor in what situations such batch deletion should occur, if that does\nindeed result in batch deletion of members?  If that documentation is\nout-of-band, but not part of the media type definition, then it isn&#39;t a\nREST API.  You can bring it in-band using HTML, where Xforms and HTML 5\nprovide the hypertext controls needed to define this behavior.\n\nYour Atom resources containing application/order aren&#39;t providing any\nhooks for alternative user agents (screen readers and such) to make\nyour data accessible, thus imposing a &#39;sighted&#39; requirement on any\nhuman needing to look at an order for any reason.  Actually, if we&#39;re\njust talking about reading not manipulating, a standard Web browser\nwith Atom capability will adapt your content to its accessibility API,\nso this isn&#39;t a showstopper.  But... \n\nTry to imagine how you might maintain your own system in a few years\nif, like too many people I know, your failing eyesight prevents you\nfrom accessing or manipulating data that has no inherent eyesight\nrequirement?  Or manipulating data that does, like images, by providing\n@alt and such?\n\nYou can allow accessible human interaction with these orders, and\nprovide me that in-band information I&#39;m looking for about deleting\ncollections and such, using HTML.  Which is not to say you shouldn&#39;t\nuse application/order, embedded in Atom or not, just that it&#39;s an\nincomplete solution from a REST perspective, unless it&#39;s GET-only.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
