The use of POST follows naturally, because what else would you use? A client is free to try a PUT and will find out at run time whether that works.\n\nagreed here, if you say it&#39;s a collection, then clients may implicitly \ntry a POST, if that&#39;s what collections imply. but.... {see further down)\n\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re assuming that by exposing collection semantics this inherently\n&gt;&gt; means you can POST to create. again, that&#39;s not something that HTTP\n&gt;&gt; tells you. for example, AtomPub says that in order to create, you have\n&gt;&gt; to POST to an &quot;edit&quot; link, and not just to the collection itself.\n&gt; Huh? Seems you are mixing editing with creating entries, or?\n\nyes i did. my apologies for the confusion!\n\n&gt; That aside, the interaction descriptions the AtomPub spec gives, are an over specification, because the server is free to do what it wants and the client has to be able to deal with that. Constraining the methods to use is a kind of coupling you cannot have (in a REStful system).\n&gt; It is interesting that people usually seem to think specification of the method to use is necessary to implement clients and servers, but when you think about it, the choices are so limited that a developers knows the method to use anyhow.\n\naren&#39;t you contradicting yourself a little bit here? it seems to me that \nabove you&#39;re saying that a client needs to understand something is a \ncollection (this would be signaled by the media type, right?) that might \nsupport POST. so we need this level of shared understanding, and i agree \nthat one possible design is to not have an explicit link and instead say \nthat &quot;a create link is implied to the same URI, so that clients can try \nPOST.&quot; but that needs to be specified somewhere, and it needs to be in \nthe media type, right? the media type can use an &quot;implicit link&quot; (&quot;use \nthe same URI and POST to it&quot;) or an explicit one (&quot;follow the &#39;create&#39; \nlink and POST to that URI&quot;), but one way or the other, there is a &quot;typed \nlink&quot; and there is a rule what HTTP method to use when following it.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
