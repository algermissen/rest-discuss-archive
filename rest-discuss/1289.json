I don&#39;t claim to be a REST wizard, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; been following this discussion for 3 months, and I haven&#39;t known anyone\n&gt; to suggest such a thing. In fact, one of the core principles of REST as\n&gt; I understand it is that the implementation of a REST resource is opaque\n&gt; to the client, which implies that it would be quite appropriate to\n&gt; generate a representation using any of the above technologies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or are you referring to the fact that CGI apps and such tend to use a\n&gt; lot of query strings? But that&#39;s really a matter of common usage, not\n&gt; an intrinsic feature of any of those technologies. And it seems to me\n&gt; that the consensus--to the extent there is one--is that query strings\n&gt; are discouraged because they obscure the relationships between resources,\n&gt; but are by no means forbidden.\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html\n\nThis was written by the same Roy T.
