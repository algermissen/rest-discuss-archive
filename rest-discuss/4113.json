What I meant was that when\nit comes to manipulating disparate data formats, having a bi-directional\nconversion between it and a common data syntax can be quite handy.\nObviously this is impractical for data like an MPEG stream but it works\nfor simple things like CSV, cookies, URI query strings, exception\nstacks, primitive types to name a few that I have used.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; While I acknowledge that XML is useful to a lot of systems,\n&gt; it is also a rather complex beast to work with.  I think the\n&gt; collective experience with RSS feeds (just to cite an example\n&gt; I am familiar with) shows that many software and content\n&gt; authors still have trouble with basic interoperability issues\n&gt; like character encoding and entity escaping.\n\nYes, I agree. XML does have complex corners. Some say it is carrying a\nbit too much baggage with it. But on the plus side it is flexible enough\nfor the job and it has been widespread adoption.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would not be comfortable calling this a universal data syntax.\n&gt; I still wonder whether such a syntax exists.  Perhaps if it does\n&gt; indeed exist, we can do better than XML in a decade or two.\n&gt; I sure hope so, but even if we did, we would have oceans of data\n&gt; in XML files by then, so we would still need the ability to\n&gt; accommodate representations with different syntaxes within our\n&gt; architecture.\n\nXML is the closest thing we have today in terms of adoption and\nflexibility. But exactly, the ability to accommodate representations\nwith different syntaxes is essential- both to be future proof and to\naccommodate what we have today.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think there is a need to couple REST to representations\n&gt; that use XML as a language syntax.  I regard the fact that REST\n&gt; doesn&#39;t dictate any particular representation syntax as a feature.\n&gt; \n&gt; What benefits would standardising on a single syntax bring?\n\nI don&#39;t think there is need to couple REST to XML either. But I think\nthat pragmatically, given what I believe about XML, good support for XML\nin a REST toolkit is, if not essential, then extremely useful. \n\n-- \nTony Butterfield &lt;tab@...&gt;\n1060 Research\n\n\n"}}
