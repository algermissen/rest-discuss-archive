The user\n&gt; &gt; follows one link, but the =\r\nnext steady-state may only be achieved by\n&gt; &gt; dereferencing pertinent URIs =\r\nwithin the initial representation.  Your\n&gt; &gt; post implies that there&#39;s a 1:=\r\n1 relationship between that initial\n&gt; &gt; representation&#39;s retrieval and the =\r\nnext steady-state.\n&gt; \n&gt; No. At least I did not want to imply that. The stea=\r\ndy state is reached when all the outstanding sub-requests have been made an=\r\nd then, when the client has no pending requests - on what basis does it det=\r\nermine the meaning of the state?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a machine client this would mean: =\r\n&quot;what information is taken into account to determine the next transition to=\r\n follow? Just the media types of the steady state or also the context of th=\r\ne request?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Eric\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;algermissen1971&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a client is in a steady state, what makes up the meaning of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; state (what information does the client use to determine the meani=\r\nng)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a) The current representation (plus the understanding of =\r\nthe media\n&gt; &gt; &gt; types) b) The current representation (plus the understandin=\r\ng of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; media types) and the request the client made (the knowledge =\r\nof the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; semantics of the resource that the representation has been obt=\r\nained\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from) c) b) and knowledge about all the requests it made before=\r\n (this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is wrong from a REST POV, but I include it for completeness)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that b) includes knowledge about any conneg that might hav=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened. E.g. the client might have asked for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  GET /p=\r\nroducts/6676\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Accept: application/xhtml\n&gt; &gt; &gt; +xml;profile=3D&quot;http://=\r\nfoo.org/my-html-product-representation-uformats-profile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and th=\r\ne server might have just answered with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  200 Ok\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Content-=\r\nType: application/xhtml+xml\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing that it serves the request=\r\ned profile. (it did not say: your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; request for HTML with tht profile i=\r\ns 406 Not Acceptable). From the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pure representation it is not detecta=\r\nble that the server sent this as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a response to a request for &#39;a produ=\r\nct representation&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is b) but I am not =\r\nentirely sure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
