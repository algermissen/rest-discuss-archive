However, we don&#39;t always nee=\r\nd to encode reserved characters. It depends on whether they have a special =\r\nmeaning for the actual scheme (here, http) in the actual component they are=\r\n in. I&#39;m not 100% sure whether this is actually the case in the given examp=\r\nle... In doubt, I could percent encode it, but for readability I would rath=\r\ner not do it if it is not really needed.\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n"}}
