I understand that \n&gt; the subject can be a user or a session.\n\nThanks. :)\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not clear why the subject and object can&#39;t both be represented in \n&gt; the URL. Multiplexed, so to speak. E.g., \n&gt; http://www.example.com/sessions/29823/buybooks.html, or \n&gt; http://www.example.com/buybooks.html?session=29823. By naming the \n&gt; subject using a cookie, you render the page uncacheable.\n\nI have to confess to not being sufficiently well appraised of HTTP&#39;s \ncaching mechanisms, and also say that my web applications are &#39;low \nvolume&#39; compared to most others. I.e. Ad-hoc TPS Reporting systems and \nACME Inc. Data Entry systems with a few thousand users (as in humans) \nper week.\n\n From my point of view if you can leave the &#39;object&#39; as the resource \n(i.e. the thing that is in the URI) and the &#39;subject&#39; as the session \ntoken (i.e. the only part of the context that isn&#39;t in the URI) then you \nare going to have the safest, clearest, most intuitive for the user, \nURLs. That&#39;s about the best I can say.\n\nI&#39;d try very hard to keep the session context out of the URL. That said, \nprovided you realise all the implications of what it might mean for you \nto put it in there, then you might feel it&#39;s worthwhile if cookies are \nnot an option for some reason.\n\n&gt; If I send someone a bookmark to \n&gt; http://www.example.com/sessions/29823/buybooks.html, but they do not \n&gt; have permission to view that session, the server can create a new \n&gt; session (say 33472) and redirect them to \n&gt; http://www.example.com/sessions/33472/buybooks.html.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or does that break the GET rule? Perhaps it should redirect them to \n&gt; http://www.example.com/start.html, from which they can click a button to \n&gt; POST a new session.\n\nI&#39;d just use a session token that was an encrypted &#39;session id&#39; and \nstick it in a non-persistent cookie (this has long been a standard for \nmanaging session tokens w/ HTTP). As I have the cookie, I&#39;d tend to \ninfer the &#39;user&#39; from the session token. That would create a pretty big \nproblem for you if you put the session token in the URL. I.e. if the \nuser gave the URL to someone else, then clicking on it would be \ntantamount to logging in as the original user.\n\nYou can optionally do heuristics on user agent, IP address, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
