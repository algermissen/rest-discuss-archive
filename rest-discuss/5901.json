That use case surely does not \n&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to each and every web resource, but it does exist, and WebDAV \n&gt;&gt;&gt; makes it possible to do it through HTTP.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Surely it&#39;s possible with HTTP as well?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; X-headers or resources which describe other resources.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is one of the fundamentals of REST as web architecture isn&#39;t it?\n&gt;\n&gt; It could be done and it is certainly done in many cases. I&#39;m just not \n&gt; aware of any specification that is widely implemented, and that would \n&gt; allow implementing it in a generic client, such as the\n&gt; MacOSX or Windows WebDAV clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; So what I&#39;m really looking for is that people stop complaining about how \n&gt; WebDAV works, and instead make a *concrete* proposal for a different \n&gt; design, that could be objectively tested and compared with what WebDAV \n&gt; does today.\n\nBut we don&#39;t NEED it.\n\nI&#39;m not complaining from the point of view of &quot;I need this... but I\ndon&#39;t want to use WEBDAV because blah blah blah&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t want people to complicate REST with WEBDAV because WEBDAV\nisn&#39;t needed.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
