File systems tend to think first about local data\nand then about making remote data look like local data. \n\n&gt; &gt; #2. The price of double or triple or quadruple dereferencing a file name\n&gt; &gt; is cheap compared to the price of parsing markup in a file system.\n&gt; &gt; Whereas the price of parsing markup is trivial on the web compared to\n&gt; &gt; the price of following one redirect to another redirect to another\n&gt; &gt; redirect etc. Better to plan for the need to move things in advance by\n&gt; &gt; &quot;indirecting&quot; through markup.\n&gt; \n&gt; This I buy.\n\nGreat. Then we agree. ;)\n\n\n&gt; This indicates a limited view of filesystems.  In a hypothetical semantic\n&gt; filesystem, the operation is conceptually similar operation to what you do on\n&gt; the Web.  With rich names, names are queries.  &quot;Moving&quot; a file isn&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily a valid concept in current filesystem research;  rather, you\n&gt; annotate or fiddle with the properties of a file such that the pathname\n&gt; (query) that is used to access it is different.\n\nFiddling the markup is like fiddling the metadata for the file. Given\nthe pseudo-resource\n\nhttp://www.foo.com/processes#xptr(/status/@href)\n\nI &quot;move&quot; the pseudo-resource by changing the value of the href\nattribute. I use the term pseudo-resource, not resource, because the\nactual resource identified by the link changes when I update the href.\n\nAnyhow, at the URI (not markup) level, the web is not a query-centric\nsystem it is an address-centric system. We find things first and\nforemost through a domain name and an associated IP address. A decent\ndistributed file system would rather not expose the machine name or IP\naddress for files. So URIs should be viewed as more like the\nbook-keeping identifier that the file system uses (inode) and less like\nthe file name.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
