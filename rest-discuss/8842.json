Indeed, I find it impossible to see how \nwe cannot have partial PUTs allowed.\n\nWhen we put we transfer *a* representation of the resource from client \nto server, just like when we GET we transfer *a* representation of the \nresource from server to client.\n\nSince a resource can have more than one representation, and we can only \never PUT one representation, any PUT is potentially affecting an \ninnumerable number of representations as these may all depend on the \nserver&#39;s knowledge of the resource - which we have just changed.\n\nAll PUTs are therefore partial in this way.\n\nFollowing from that there is no reason why one may not send a \nrepresentation that omits some information (it is indeed very common for \none representation of a resource to contain information another does \nnot). There is nothing faulty with such a representation and therefore \nno reason why it may not be used.\n\nTherefore whether partial PUTs may or may not be used becomes solely a \nmatter of whether partial knowledge of a representation may be expressed \nin a particular content type.\n\nOne can also do partial PUTs using content-range but this either \nrequires either the entity to be of a type where over-writing a fixed \nnumber of octets makes sense, or else the use of a custom range-unit.\n\n\n"}}
