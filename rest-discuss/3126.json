&lt;j.winter@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=117929308\r\n\r\nI&#39;m certainly no expert on HTTP caching, but the definition of PUT\ndoes include the line:\n\n    If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI\n    identifies one or more currently cached entities, those\n    entries SHOULD be treated as stale.\n\nNotice that this doesn&#39;t say &quot;MUST.&quot;  This would seem to imply\nthe a cache *could* simply update it&#39;s entry without marking\nit stale, and hence respond to another request without revalidating\nagainst the origin server (depending on the cache control headers\nof the request and the original response).\n\nIf the origin server had changed &quot;&lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;&quot; to\n&quot;&lt;number&gt;one&lt;/number&gt;&quot; things could get ugly.\n\nIf PUT did require the entity to be stored as-is (which we keep\nhearing it does) then this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.\n\nI could be completely wrong about this and would appreciate\nhearing about where I went awry.\n\n- Winter\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot;

From: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If someone can find, somewhere in the body of standards, clear\n&gt; &gt; language to the effect that the resource implementation is expected to\n&gt; &gt; store a PUT value in bit-literal form, and that a subsequent GET on\n&gt; &gt; a resource that has suffered a PUT at some time in its life is required\n&gt; &gt; to serve out bit-literal representations...\n&gt;\n&gt; I have had problems with this as well.  So far, I just cannot see how this\n&gt; could be enforced.  Between the moment that the PUT was completed and a\n&gt; subsequent GET was requested, the resource could have been updated (via\n&gt; PUTs, if you want) several times.  There is no mechanism in HTTP to\nperform\n&gt; a PUT-followed-by-GET as an atomic operation.  As a result, it seems that\n&gt; one should *ever* expect the representation sent with a PUT to be the same\n&gt; as the representation retrieved with a GET, at least as a general rule.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
