HTTP&#39;s REST replaces the\ndoSomething concept with a &quot;make something so&quot; concept. If you think\nabout it, all doSomething can be modelled this way. Instead of &quot;make\nthis kind of state transition&quot;, just &quot;make your state this&quot;. You have to\nget into specific examples to see how this works. The first example of\nstarting or stopping a function is the same as setting a running\nresource to false or true. Do you have more examples in mind? What kind\nof process would you like to create?\n\nThe general approach to process creation would either be:\nPOST a representation of the process to a factory resource to create it.\nPUT a representation of the process to the process resource to change\nits operation.\nDELETE the process to destroy it.\nPUT a false to the process&#39;s &quot;running&quot; resource to suspend it.\netc ...\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
