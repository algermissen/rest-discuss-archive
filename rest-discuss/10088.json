I&#39;m using the version identifier as the ETag for\nthe related resources, so far so good. As the clients update the\nentities, they send a PUT request with a IF-MATCH header with their\nlast version identifier so we can avoid some concurrency problems with\noptimistic locking. To create the versioning identifier I&#39;m digesting\n(SHA-256) the resource state: I&#39;m exchanging a very small chance of\ncollision against the chance to detect previously sent updates. When a\nclient send a PUT request I have the IF-MATCH ETag and I compute the\nnew ETag automatically. Now suppose this sequence of events:\n\n\n1. Client A sents PUT ... (IF-MATCH: &quot;XXX&quot;) ... FOO ...\n2. Server process the request and sends the new ETag: YYY\n3. Client B sents PUT ... (IF-MATCH: &quot;YYY&quot;) ... BAR\n4. Server process the request and sends the new ETag: ZZZ\n5. Client A retries the first PUT (network problems, double submit, it\ndoesn&#39;t matter) sends ETag: YYY\n\n     My application can compute the new version identifier for FOO and\nit will always be YYY, so doing a quick check it finds this version\nalready persisted and it can safely assume that it&#39;s a duplicate\nsubmission. My question is: can it return a 200 to this duplicate\nrequest or it must return a 412, as per section 14.24? AFAICT\nreturning 200 should be OK, but I don&#39;t want to take chances of going\nagainst the Internet ;) or messing with some subtle implicit rule\nabout caching (e.g. some intermediate cache between both client A and\nclient B overwrite B&#39;s update and become inconsistent).\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel Yokomizo.\n\n"}}
