One could argue that\n&gt;&gt; having only one single world-wide registry for MIME types is actually\n&gt;&gt; against the spirit of the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; Decentralized approach might work, but an approach like\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;application/data-format;uri=http://mediatypes.example.com/foo/bar&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; seems problematic. Since the &quot;uri&quot; parameter is not specified,  \n&gt; almost all processors will ignore it, and will therefore interpret  \n&gt; the media type as &quot;application/data-format&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nUnderstood; maybe there&#39;s a better place to put the URI. But I think  \nit&#39;s obvious that only clients that know how to handle application/ \ndata-format would be able to understand the parameter, which is sort  \nof the whole purpose.\n\n&gt; Taking a step back, the problem for the client is (a) to find the  \n&gt; specification of a media type, and (b), then use that information  \n&gt; (and upon learning all the application rules) to write processing  \n&gt; code. Both these steps happen at development time. Once the client  \n&gt; sees the Content-Type header, it can invoke the right branch code to  \n&gt; process it. So, the first problem I think is to get developers\n&gt;\n&gt; (a) assign media types, and\n&gt; (b) document the media types in whatever form convenient for that  \n&gt; media type\n&gt;\n\nI agree. But I think it makes sense to standardize how to get from a  \nContent-type or Accept value to the resource that describes it.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n&gt; [ (c) and not tell that Atom and GData have already solved these  \n&gt; problems :) ]\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt; ---\n&gt; http://subbu.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
