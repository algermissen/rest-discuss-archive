It is not possible\n&gt; to GET/POST/PUT a partial/subset of a resource using the resource. If a\n&gt; partial or subset of a resource is needed then it is a resource itself and\n&gt; hence must have it&#39;s own URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that correct?\n\nNot quite. As previously discussed it is possible to use\ncontent-ranges to restrict the data intra-resource.\n\nHowever, it&#39;s not advisable to use them because of caching problems.\n\nAnd infact, content-ranges are quite difficult to use.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
