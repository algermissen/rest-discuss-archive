The \none thing that is nice about Cocoon is the sitemap, which is a mapping \nof logical URIs to physical resources.  But, as of about a month ago, \nyou couldn&#39;t use the sitemap to look at the incoming XML to make decisions.\n\nYou can match on the URI string to direct to certain physical things on \nthe web server, but you can&#39;t use XPath on the incoming document to make \nthose decisions.  Once that happens, Cocoon will be very powerful.\n\nI&#39;m also not sure on Cocoon&#39;s support of PUT and DELETE.  I think it \nonly handles GET and POST (since it&#39;s all build on Servlets, and they \nhave a doService(), doGet() and a doPost()).\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
