But the hyperlink model is complete, in the\nsame way that GET/PUT/POST/DELETE is complete. In the same way that\nlambda calculus primitives are complete. So Jeff needs to show that his\nway is simpler. Rather, he&#39;s shown how he can recreate all of the\ncomplexity of markup (namespaces, interfaces, generative schemas) in\nnamespaces. So we double the complexity without increasing the\ndescriptive power at all.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Take the example of 100K user profiles, indexed by email address. JeffB &\n&gt; PaulP - show me each of your approaches. More than one example is fine,\n&gt; since that helps explain things to me.\n\nI thought I did this already. There are 100K user profiles. There are\n100K email addresses somewhere else. Somehow we have to communicate from\nthe client to the server that there is a mapping from email addresses to\nURIs. I can only roughly guess at Jeff&#39;s approach (he hasn&#39;t elaborated\nit except in bits and pieces) but it seems like it would involve sending\nsomething like this from server to client:\n\n&lt;uri_remapping&gt;\n  &lt;variable name=&quot;userid&quot; type=&quot;EmailAddress&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;remapping href=&quot;http://www.userprofiles.com/profiles/$userid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/uri_remapping&gt;\n\nThe client needs to know how to interpret this as an assertion that\nemail addresses can be plugged in to get back URIs.\n\nWhereas, I would send something like:\n\n&lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot; target=&quot;http://www.profiles.com/profile_for_id&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;input name=&quot;userid&quot; type=&quot;email_address&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nA three-line servlet returns a redirect to\nhttp://www.userprofiles.com/profiles/$userid\n\nMy solution is equally powerful, uses only currently-deployed\ntechnologies and lets the server name things however it wants.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
