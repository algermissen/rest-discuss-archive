Is this due to the fact that most discussions are\n&gt; also talking about HTTP (see my last post), or is there something about a\n&gt; URI that is particularly RESTful in of itself?\n\nFor me, REST is a about remote, untouchable &#39;resources&#39; - and in order to\ninteract with them, they need to be identified. This &#39;identity&#39; aspect seems\nfundamental to REST. And it seems easier to talk about noun-oriented things\nwhen you talk about things with identity. Really /anything/ can be\nidentified - methods, operations, transactions, etc. - but when you have\nidentity, it seems to &#39;noun-ify&#39; whatever you are talking about.\n\n"}}
