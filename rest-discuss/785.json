I am thinking about a simple templating feature for\n&gt; XML:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;foo bar=&quot;{height}&quot;&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;width&gt;{width}&lt;/width&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/foo&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It probably doesn&#39;t make much sense to go beyond that.\n\nThis almost looks like XForms. They have an element that lets you specify\nmodel instance data where elements get replaced with the actual form values\nwhen the form gets submitted.\n\nWould these be different kinds of inputs? You can certainly still have query\nand header inputs. Maybe you don&#39;t need the {variables} in your template if\nyou put XPath expressions on the elements (variable? parameter?) that\nspecify these.\n\nWould you be able to specify an output template as well?\n\nI think this is really cool but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s really necessary for\nWRDL. At least for an initial release. By the way, do you have a list of\ngoals or requirements for the first release of WRDL? We certainly don&#39;t want\nto succumb to feature creep or we might have to change the R to an S. ;-)\n\n&gt; I think I will also rename it to reference-type, because really we&#39;re\n&gt; classifying references. Make sense to you?\n\nSounds good. Are you switching to lisp-style identifiers instead of\ncamelCase? I don&#39;t care which one you use but they should probably be\nconsistent.\n\n&gt; &lt;!ELEMENT reference-type (documentation?, appinfo?)&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST reference-type name %Name; #REQUIRED\n&gt;                     match %XPath; #REQUIRED\n&gt;                     use %XPath; #REQUIRED\n&gt;                     resourceType %QName; #REQUIRED&gt;\n\nMaybe the use attribute should be optional. I can imagine some resources\ncontaining a list of references with no obvious key. And perhaps some\napplications won&#39;t care about the keys.\n\nWill the spec specify any sort of rules for compliant APIs? The question I\nhave now is this: should the collection of references maintain the same\norder they were found in even if keyed? If so, we&#39;d have to use a fancier\ndata structure than a Hashtable or Map since those usually destroy the\nordering. I would tend to think that the answer to this would be use but I\ndon&#39;t have any particular use cases to justify it.\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
