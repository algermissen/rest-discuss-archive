It claims to require a WEBDAV-enabled Web\nserver to publish to.\n\nAaron and I did some testing of it tonight, and discovered that it&#39;s\nperfectly possible to use with a PUT/DELETE-enabled Web server; it only\nseems to use MKCOL from WebDAV to make sure that the containing resource\nis present.\n\nQuestion: has anyone done a writeup of WebDAV to see what the additional\nfunctionality over REST is, and how often it&#39;s required? To my knowledge,\nthe only notable bits are MKCOL and properties (which IIRC have been\ndiscussed here as capable of being modeled in a more RESTful manner).\nAnything else?\n\nP.S. iCal supports Digest Auth; yippee!\n\n--\nMark Nottingham\n\n\n"}}
