A request and response are \n&gt; recognizable without a notification or special flag.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know of only two problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; - finding a way for clients and servers to signal that they can use the \n&gt; socket in either direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; - handling &quot;Connection: close&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nWell, just to throw you for a further loop, I&#39;m doing it with one-off \nconnections.  So, the client periodically sends a POST to the server, \nwhich responds with any pending &quot;reverse request&quot;.  End of connection.  \nWhen the client finishes processing the reverse request, it does another \nPOST to the server to send the result.  The server either responds with \nanother reverse request, or indicates there are no more pending reverse \nrequests.\n\nI&#39;m doing it this way because my HTTP server is single-threaded, so I \ncan&#39;t tie it up with an open socket.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
