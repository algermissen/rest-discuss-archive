We write to each of\n&gt; &gt; them via the same interface, and the interface semantics are the same.  What\n&gt; &gt; happens as a result of that write differs depending on the particular &quot;file.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok. If we are going to analogize to UNIX.  NOTIFY\n&gt; is like Make.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I know that a specific executable is out of\n&gt; date (or think it might be), I do Make file.\n&gt; The Make system knows how to check dependencies\n&gt; and will update the file if necessary.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the better analogy is that NOTIFY is like\n&gt; having a Refresh button that works on\n&gt; arbitrary servers rather than just Browser caches.\n\nSilly rabbit.  NOTIFY is &quot;touch.&quot;\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
