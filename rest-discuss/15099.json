If that works, why bother trying to ma=\r\nke it work as REST if that complicates things without adding much benefits?=\r\n Well, REST was made to obtain some particular benefits, given a very parti=\r\ncular architecture: the web. So, if you don&#39;t need those benefits, but some=\r\n others you can get with simpler things, then it is common sense to go KISS=\r\n. \n\nThe question is still the same. REST discussions are held in the SOA ar=\r\nena, as if REST is a SOA sub product. If SOA is dead, is then REST dead the=\r\n same? Does REST lives only in the SOA realm? Is REST just a web services a=\r\nlternative? Is Services the only topic we can talk about in REST?\n\nI wonder=\r\n.\n \nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Kevin Duf=\r\nfey &lt;andjarnic@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting... when I first heard of REST=\r\n a few years ago, I thought I created a REST api. I used POST for all calls=\r\n, and it was basically in the form or &lt;url&gt;/method aka.. HTTP RPC. I hadn&#39;t=\r\n read anything else about it.. just that it was basically a much easier way=\r\n of doing xml-rpc using http.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then I learned about Jersey almost 2 yea=\r\nrs ago or so.. and started to understand the use of the various methods for=\r\n CRUD like operations. I still used it much like HTTP RPC, only now it was =\r\nto resources and I avoided query params except for filtering results on a G=\r\nET call to a collection resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lately, as Jan and others can testif=\r\ny to, I&#39;ve been asking a lot of questions to try to grasp the real REST mea=\r\nning, and I&#39;ve struggled with a few remaining concepts of it, but I have le=\r\narned a lot from this forum and the jersey forum, a few books, and such. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I tend to think most developers read a little bit about REST and come a=\r\nway with much the same thing I did.. an easier RPC like mechanism using HTT=\r\nP methods and headers. Even the use of media types is not very common as th=\r\nose I talk to just use application/xml or application/json for request and =\r\nresponse types.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be honest.. learning the &quot;true&quot; RESTful API style=\r\n has put me off a little bit. For example, while working on a service that =\r\nyou would make a REST call to enable/disable something, it seemed less like=\r\nly that REST was the proper architecture to use, yet I wanted to provide a =\r\nsingle API, not two disjointed APIs. I am still not 100% clear on if such t=\r\nhings are within the realm of using REST to change application state to tur=\r\nn something on or off for example, I think it&#39;s fine, but I do see how it c=\r\nan be quite confusing trying to learn about resource state and application =\r\nstate, especially with many of us coming from the servlet/httpsession state=\r\nful side of things and trying to grasp this concept of the client maintains=\r\n the state (when there are two states) and so forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
