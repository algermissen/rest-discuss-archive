If you want to specifically accuse someone of handwaving, then \ndo so.\n\n\n&gt; 1.  Authentication. Far as I can tell, all the options that are both \n&gt; RESTful and secure require something more than vanilla Web 0.1, and so \n&gt; I&#39;m stuck with Apache Basic Auth or something cookie-based. I think I&#39;m \n&gt; going to go with the latter, because being able to log out is pretty \n&gt; important, I think. Tentatively, I&#39;d go with a scheme wherein there&#39;s a \n&gt; login form with a username/password, host returns a username/session \n&gt; token. A bit RESTless, but nothing beyond the token itself is stored in \n&gt; the server-side session, so I&#39;m thinking the damage to RESTfulness is \n&gt; minimal. So is security, but it&#39;s better than transmitting the password \n&gt; in the clear every time. Slightly.\n\nUse cookies; abstract your login code out of the view so that it can be \nreused when some a non-browser client wants to authenticate.\n\nIf you want to see a system that does cookies + www-authenticate, look \nat Zope2/Plone. There&#39;s plenty of implementation in there.\n\nWhen you do log out, be sure to reset the cookie, clear down any session \nstate, and redirect the user off the logout. That&#39;s so you don&#39;t get to \nlog in via the back button. Most frameworks I&#39;ve seem expect you to do \nthis yourself. Try not to log users out with GET (if you must show a \nlink, at least trap it and call POST via javascript).\n\n\n&gt; 2.  That darn &quot;there&#39;s something beyond GET and POST?&quot; thing. I&#39;m pretty \n&gt; much stuck with overloaded POST, I think. Happily, the application I&#39;m \n&gt; writing is naturally heavier on true POSTs than PUTs, at least. And I&#39;m \n&gt; not at all clear on what horrible things can happen (again, in \n&gt; *practice*) with overloaded POST, at least in an environment where dumb \n&gt; browser is constrained (barring malice/stupidity) by the forms fed to it \n&gt; by a server aware of its dumbness.\n\nLive with POST, understand the implications of overloading. Mostly, the \nimplication is that frameworks (and standards) that derive from the \nworldview that everything&#39;s a form or a CGI suck. They are optimized for \nyou to write stupid code by default. To be clear, that&#39;s a lot of \nframeworks, and a lot of specs. If you&#39;ve only ever worked inside such \nframeworks and to such standards (eg if your experience is limited to \nRPC WS-* stacks and/or Struts action controllers), you might think it&#39;s \nfine in the same way Blub programmers think Blub is fine.\n\nYou can workaround HTML forms limitations using Javascript:\n\n   http://www.mnot.net/javascript/json_form.js\n\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
