Bowman:\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand.  HTML and Atom define HTTP method operations\n&gt; (beyond the default retrieval operation), SemWeb doesn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n\nHTML and Atom define the processing model for the operations, when \nviewing the &#39;small set of operations&#39; for HTTP as these one defined in \n[1] (by checking the reference, I&#39;m seeing that they used the term \n&#39;method&#39; there, however I saw Roy T. Fielding often using the term \n&#39;operation&#39;; so, sorry for any disaccord).\n\n\n&gt; Media types are meant to explain the processing model of a data type to\n&gt; humans, who then write code implementing that processing model.  Media\n&gt; types are not targeted towards machine readability, an architectural\n&gt; requirement I can&#39;t begin to fathom when mentioned as a deficiency.\n&gt; The scope of the effort to fix the registry does not include machine-\n&gt; readable media types.\n\nGenerally, I think the TAG mailing list is currently a better place for \nthe ongoing &quot;URIs for media types&quot;-discuss. Only, I small note: I don&#39;t \nthink that Roy T. Fieldings REST definition somewhere excluded machines \nfrom understanding media type specifications, which are from my POV can \nalso be realized via a RDF Model based description. Please remember also \nthe Web is a &quot;universal hybrid information space&quot;, where hybrid intents \nhere the inclusion of human and machine agents.\n\n&gt; The constraint is &quot;self-descriptive messaging&quot; and has nothing to do\n&gt; with the self-describing messages (payloads) of SemWeb.  All a\n&gt; component needs to be able to do, when it comes to Content-Type, is\n&gt; recognize the token to determine if it has the corresponding codec.\n&gt; The component takes that token to be self-descriptive of the sender&#39;s\n&gt; intended processing model, thus hopefully rendering HTML as plaintext\n&gt; if the representation was labelled as text/plain.\n\nI guess, grasping the difference between &#39;self-descriptive&#39; and \n&#39;self-describing&#39; is hard a hard task. Since I can imagine to utilize \nfor both Semantic Web knowledge representation languages e.g., RDF in \nHTTP Link header field. Especially, when seeing Roy T. Fielding \nsuggesting the usage of RDF Model for getting processing model \ndescription that are beyond that of the media type specifications (see [2]).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\n[2] \nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-754\n\n"}}
