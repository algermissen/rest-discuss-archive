To use PUT,\n&gt; &gt; you need to know a good url for the new task to PUT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This depends on implementation.  I suggested a list of tasks, to which\n&gt; tasks may be added or removed.  So the list&#39;s URI is known.  Each\n&gt; change to the list, replaces the list.  Simple, and un-RESTful to assign\n&gt; replacement semantics to POST when that&#39;s what PUT is for.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, if we&#39;re talking about a list which is a collection of individual\n&gt; task resources, then we&#39;re talking about some other implementation.  If\n&gt; adding a task involves the creation of a resource, instead of replacing\n&gt; the existing list with an appended list, *then* POST is correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or PUT, since PUT may also be assigned creation semantics.  This\n&gt; depends on whether or not the URI for the created task is known in\n&gt; advance.  It may very well be included in the hypertext representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, again, I thought we were discussing a simple list of tasks with a\n&gt; known URI.  In such a model, with replacement semantics assigned to\n&gt; PUT, creating a new to-do-list resource would fall to POST at some\n&gt; other URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\r\n--00c09f88cf086abd68048bc5b7b7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nI was thinking each task is a resource, hence why I said POST not PUT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 19, 2010 at 2:39 PM, Eric J.
