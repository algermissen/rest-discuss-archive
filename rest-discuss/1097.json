PUT/POST/DELETE\n&gt; could also be used for modifying/deleting the product information.\n&gt;\n&gt; The client could then also use these same product names in the query\n&gt; part of the availability URIs, as I explained earlier, like this:\n&gt; http://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity?product=http://www\n&gt; .myi\n&gt; nventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow\n&gt;\n&gt; In the earlier suggestion where the following URI was used:\n&gt; http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/?when=tomorro\n&gt; w\n&gt; The &quot;blueshoe&quot; product would be known by two names by the client, the\n&gt; URI and the name &quot;blueshoe&quot;.\n&gt;\nYou are right about the need for two names - I&#39;m just not sure what the best\nway of doing it is. It seems that using a URI for everything is a bit\nexcessive, but I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time in this area.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
