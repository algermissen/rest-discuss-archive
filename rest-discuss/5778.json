I knew saying the above was a slippery slope :o)\n\n\nIt is treating it as a transport protocol though.\n\n &gt; Yes, but an equivalent case to mine would be a search engine\n &gt; answering e.g. 400\n &gt; for supplying a syntactically correct but somehow unprocessable\n &gt; query. I am\n &gt; really not sure that all errors should be indicated by HTTP error\n &gt; codes. But if not\n &gt; all of them...which (of those without an appropriate code) should be\n &gt; handled by HTTP?\n\nWhy not. It tells us that the request cannot be successfully tried \nagaint without alteration. It tells proxies that too.\n\nThough search engines tend to pass queries in the URI for GETs. If \n/?search=someBadQuery can&#39;t return anything useful for some reason a 404 \nwould be more appropriate - the URI does not have a means of returning a \nrepresentation of a resource.\n\nOf course, the actual error message would have to be appropriate for the \nuser (&quot;This search cannot blah blah&quot; rather than a server&#39;s default 404 \nmessage.\n\n &gt;&gt;Consider the classic example of running a server-side script that\n &gt;&gt;throws\n &gt;&gt;and exception. It&#39;s not HTTPs fault that this happened, it&#39;s HTTPs job\n &gt;&gt;to respond to the (correctly formed) HTTP request with a (correctly\n &gt;&gt;formed) 500 error stating that an error happened at the server.\n &gt;&gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Hmm...isn&#39;t that a &#39;connector failure&#39;, informing the client that the\n &gt; request did not reach the component that would normaly handle the\n &gt; request?\n\nIt did reach the component, and the component went b0rk in an unexpected \nway (if it was an expected way, based on bad input, then the error \nshould have been trapped and an appropriate error from the 4xx range \nreturned).\n\n"}}
