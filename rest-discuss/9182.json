I suspect that it&#39;s very hard to come up with a \n&gt; language that isn&#39;t &quot;information complete&quot;. Essentially if you have at \n&gt; least two states and an infinite space, anything can be encoded. I \n&gt; suspect the only languages that are not &quot;information complete&quot; would be \n&gt; ones with a finite number of strings.\n\n\nActually I now recall, you don&#39;t even need two states. One will do. You \nsimply count the number of marks made. Unary data encoding is not very \nefficient, but as long as you have infinite space, it&#39;s fully able to \nexpress anything you can express in binary.\n\nI do wonder why we&#39;ve limited data storage to binary systems. It seems \nmoving to a quaternary or higher encoding would exponentially increase \nthe amount of data you could store on the space, though there&#39;d be some \nincrease in complexity of the reading and writing hardware. However off \nthe top of my head the only system I can remember that used more than a \nbinary encoding would be analog modems with higher than 2400 bps.\n\nPerhaps quantum computing will finally break us out of the binary ghetto.\n\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
