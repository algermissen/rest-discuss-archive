Is the distinction between the GET and  \nPOST in this instance that requested resource is viewed through a  \ndifferent client than the one requesting it? The user just clicks a  \nbutton to get a view of a resource, but instead of returning to the  \nbrowser the view is returned to an email client.

Is that a side effect? If not, why not?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Rob\n\n\n"}}
