Any Post =\r\nOffice in the system can handle that request. There are no\nprerequisites.\n\n=\r\nAll it requires is a properly filled out form. If the form is not valid,\nth=\r\ne System will reject the form. At which point you can go fix the form and\ns=\r\ntart over (get back in line). Or you can come back tomorrow. Or you can\nmai=\r\nl it in. Or you can drive to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and drop it off\nthere. T=\r\nhe end effect is the same, your address will be changed. The fact\nthat you&#39;=\r\nve tried before, and where you&#39;ve tried before, has no bearing on\nthe reque=\r\nst itself, nor who you gave the request too.\n\nOf course the Post Office mai=\r\nntains, somewhere, somehow, the relationship\nbetween you and where you live=\r\n.

No big deal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My current understanding of statel=\r\ness is that there should not need to be\n&gt; &quot;state&quot; on the server that will c=\r\nause a different behavior based on a user\n&gt; might take.  So POSTing to &quot;new=\r\n item&quot; resource changes the server state\n&gt; because if a user then issues a =\r\nPUT with a value of\n&gt; &quot;status=3Dorder-submitted&quot; something different happen=\r\ns than if they had NOT\n&gt; first POSTed to the new item resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further=\r\n, if lots of users are adding items to shopping cart resources\n&gt; (think Ama=\r\nzon-scale) then the server has to scale up to hang on to these\n&gt; shopping c=\r\nart states.\n&gt;\n&gt; So how is that &quot;stateless&quot;, honest question?\n&gt;\n&gt; However, e=\r\nach of the transactions that manage that resource are themselves\n&gt; stateles=\r\ns. Resource value is not the same as state.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t follow the distin=\r\nction between resource value and state.  Maybe I\n&gt; need an example of &quot;reso=\r\nurce value&quot; that differs from what you are calling\n&gt; state?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You can e=\r\nasily see having any of a zillion web servers fronting the\n&gt; resource store=\r\n that manages the Shopping Cart. Since there&#39;s no transaction\n&gt; state maint=\r\nained with any one server, you can switch back and forth across\n&gt; them with=\r\nout any semantic change to the application.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But one database server h=\r\nas to keep track of the cart contents, right?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just like when you go t=\r\no the Post Office. You get in line, and when you\n&gt; get to the clerk you ask=\r\n to change your address. They tell you to fill out\n&gt; a form, and you go bac=\r\nk in line. When you get back to a clerk, any clerk,\n&gt; the process continues=\r\n. The state itself is the form you&#39;re holding. You\n&gt; don&#39;t have any require=\r\nment to go back to the same clerk.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But the post office has a central =\r\ndatabase somewhere and maintains that as\n&gt; &quot;state,&quot; no?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The transacti=\r\non is the same thing. Think of the transaction as renting\n&gt; bowling shoes. =\r\nIn order to go bowling, you must have bowling shoes. So you\n&gt; &quot;check out&quot; t=\r\nhe token (bowling shoes), and give them YOUR shoes as an\n&gt; &quot;identifier&quot;, th=\r\nen you go back and swap them out. When you check your\n&gt; bowling shoes back =\r\nin, you&#39;re done bowling. Any person at the counter can\n&gt; handle this transa=\r\nction. The actual transactions themselves are stateless.\n&gt; You&#39;re just push=\r\ning resources back and forth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So the &quot;bowling shoes API&quot; has to keep =\r\ntrack of the &quot;shoes&quot; it lends with\n&gt; an internal IDs.\n&gt; How is this differe=\r\nnt from a session ID other that it&#39;s specific to\n&gt; aspects of the applicati=\r\non vs. general?\n&gt;\n&gt; To be clear, I&#39;m asking these questions to help underst=\r\nand not to\n&gt; challenge your assertions.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n-- \nCONFIDENTIAL=\r\nITY NOTICE: The information contained in this electronic \ntransmission may =\r\nbe confidential.

Resource value is not the s=\r\name as state. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nlockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&#39;t follow the distinction between resource val=\r\nue and state. =A0Maybe I need an example of &quot;resource value&quot; that=\r\n differs from what you are calling state?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You=\r\n can easily see having any of a zillion web servers fronting the resource s=\r\ntore that manages the Shopping Cart.=A0Since there&#39;s no transaction sta=\r\nte maintained with any one server, you can switch back and forth across the=\r\nm without any semantic change to the application.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/block=\r\nquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;But one database server h=\r\nas to keep track of the cart contents, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquot=\r\ne type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just like when you go to the Post Off=\r\nice. You get in line, and when you get to the clerk you ask to change your =\r\naddress. They tell you to fill out a form, and you go back in line. When yo=\r\nu get back to a clerk, any clerk, the process continues. The state itself i=\r\ns the form you&#39;re holding. You don&#39;t have any requirement to go bac=\r\nk to the same clerk.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the post office has a central database somewher=\r\ne and maintains that as &quot;state,&quot; no?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The=\r\n transaction is the same thing. Think of the transaction as renting bowling=\r\n shoes. In order to go bowling, you must have bowling shoes. So you &quot;c=\r\nheck out&quot; the token (bowling shoes), and give them YOUR shoes as an &q=\r\nuot;identifier&quot;, then you go back and swap them out. When you check yo=\r\nur bowling shoes back in, you&#39;re done bowling. Any person at the counte=\r\nr can handle this transaction. The actual transactions themselves are state=\r\nless. You&#39;re just pushing resources back and forth.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/block=\r\nquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the &quot;bowling shoes API&=\r\nquot; has to keep track of the &quot;shoes&quot; it lends with an internal =\r\nIDs.=A0&lt;/div&gt;How is this different from a session ID other that it&#39;s sp=\r\necific to aspects of the application vs. general? =A0&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;T=\r\no be clear, I&#39;m asking these questions to help understand not to challe=\r\nnge your assertions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;-Mike&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n =\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot; size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this =\r\nelectronic transmission may be confidential.
