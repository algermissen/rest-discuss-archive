(leading\n&gt; &gt; to sessions, cookies, wacky urls, etc.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/NOTE-authentform-19990203\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; This proposal suggests extensions to HTML forms to overcome their present\n&gt; &gt; security problems by integrating them with HTTP (or other security sublayer)\n&gt; &gt; mechanisms. It calls for a new type of form; the AUTHFORM and new values for\n&gt; &gt; the TYPE attribute of the INPUT element and SELECT block.\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about this as well. I&#39;m due to give an\n&gt; evangelizing talk about REST for a client and I know that this is\n&gt; going to come up.\n&gt;\n&gt; My experience of HTTP authentication is that the fixed user interface\n&gt; makes it unpopular with users (or at least website designers) and that\n&gt; has a knock on effect on the architecture of web services components\n&gt; built as part of the same application.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems the ideas put forward in the link above were not\n&gt; popular. Adding stuff to HTML doesn&#39;t seem like the right thing to do\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why an authentication response couldn&#39;t have an\n&gt; entity associated with it, either in the response body or referenced\n&gt; via some content-location like header.\n&gt;\n&gt; If it were possible to associate an entity with the authentication\n&gt; then browsers could render it when they find it and use the standard\n&gt; dialog box when they don&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would that sort of scheme violate REST principles in anyway?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nic\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
