I&#39;d \nlove to hear anyone&#39;s considered responses.\n\nIn REST, and with HTTP, it is taken that a single request is &#39;explicit&#39;. \nWhat this means is that a single request expresses everything a \nprocessing server needs in order to generate a response. Conceptually, \nthis means that the request specifies a &#39;context&#39; for a server which \n&#39;implies&#39; a response. It is the server&#39;s responsibility to get from the \n&#39;context&#39; to a &#39;representation&#39;. I.e. the server needs to understand the \n&#39;implications&#39; of a single request and respond with an appropriate result.\n\nREST and HTTP say that the requests sent to servers include the \nfollowing things:\n\n  A verb.\n  A resource.\n  A collection of headers.\n\nI&#39;m not going to deny this is what&#39;s there, because that *is* what is \nthere. Those things are the tools at our disposal for understanding the \n&#39;context&#39; in which a server carries out processing. What I&#39;m trying to \npresent is a case for viewing those things as:\n\n  A subject.\n  A verb.\n  An object.\n\nIn my view, it is certainly the case that this is what you do regardless \nof whether you choose to conceive of it this way or not.\n\nThese are just two different ways of labelling the &#39;parts&#39; of a transfer \nrequest which create the context which implies the response.\n\nNow, it&#39;s fairly easy to translate one to the other. In doing so, we \narrive at &#39;clues&#39; about how to come up with desirable interaction models \nover HTTP.\n\nFirstly, the verb just directly translates from one conceptualisation to \nthe other.\n\nSecondly, the resource, by rights, translates to the &#39;object&#39; of the \nrequest. (The implication of what I say next is that the resource should \nnot identify anything which can be implied by the &#39;subject&#39; of the \nrequest, but we&#39;re getting to that).\n\nThirdly, the collection of headers are a mixed bag. The headers \ndefinitely do create all sorts of specialised context. For example, what \nformat will an agent accept, does the agent already have a cached copy, \ndo we know what security principal the agent represents, etc.\n\nThere are all sorts of things that HTTP headers might do to modify the \n&#39;context&#39; of a request. This becomes complicated, and complicated is \nbad. What I&#39;m trying to do is show that ultimately the context created \nby these headers should be entirely abstracted away into the form { \n&#39;subject&#39; &#39;verb&#39; &#39;object&#39; }. That form is remarkably simple and 100% \neffective at encapsulating the form of every single combination of the \nabove.\n\nNow, lets just simplify a little bit and say that when a server receives \na request for processing it can do one of two things: respond or \nredirect. We&#39;ll stick with analysing the verb &#39;GET&#39;, for simplicity.\n\n&#39;Respond&#39; means that a 200 class message with an attached entity is \nreturned as the result of the request.\n\n&#39;Redirect&#39; means that a 300 class message with no entity is returned as \nthe result of the request.\n\nWe ignore all other concerns for the moment.\n\nOur goal is to find a way to derive,\n\n   { &#39;subject&#39; &#39;verb&#39; &#39;object&#39; }\n\nfrom,\n\n   { &#39;verb&#39; &#39;resource&#39; &#39;headers&#39; }.\n\nThe tools we have to communicate results are &#39;respond&#39; and &#39;redirect&#39;.\n\nThere are two motivations for getting into the form { &#39;subject&#39; &#39;verb&#39; \n&#39;object&#39; }. The first is that this creates a very simple context for \nwhich application programmers can write programs which generate results \nimplied by such requests. The second is that this model is conducive to \na simplified programming API when programming the web and querying it \nfor information. I freely admit that each of these motivations are \nsubjective and open to scrutiny, but I think it&#39;s worth hearing me out.\n\nWhat I want to be able to do, conceptually, is use two URIs and a single \nverb to imply a response.\n\nI want to be able to say, or, the way I want to interpret the context \nwhich implies a server&#39;s response, is:\n\n  http://www.example.org/session/42 GETs http://www.example.org/resource\n\nTogether the &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;verb&#39;, and &#39;object&#39; of the request will imply \nthe response.\n\nWhat I actually have is considerably more complicated than that. I have \nAccept, Referer, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, If-Modified-Since, \nUser-Agent, Host, Connection, Cookie (!), etc., etc.\n\nThat is, there&#39;s all this &#39;extra&#39; stuff in there which, if I&#39;m not \ncareful, I might start to depend on. This stuff is complicated.\n\nI&#39;m willing to accept that it will often be necessary (appropriate, \neven) to acknowledge the content of these headers. However, my view is \nthat if the context created by the headers deviates from &#39;subject&#39; \n&#39;verb&#39; &#39;object&#39; then the only response I want to generate is a &#39;redirect&#39;.\n\nThat&#39;s important to stress, I think. The goal is to make sure that if \nthere is a GET request which actually &#39;responds&#39; with an entity and a \n200 class code, then I want to make sure I know what the &#39;subject&#39;, \n&#39;verb&#39; and &#39;object&#39; of the request were. In any other case the &#39;subject&#39; \n&#39;verb&#39; and &#39;object&#39; may be deemed to have been too inexplicitly \nspecified, in which case a &#39;redirect&#39; to a more explicit URI is desirable.\n\nThe implications of this approach are:\n\n  - A &#39;session token&#39; is all that is required for a server to understand \nthe &#39;subject&#39; of a request. From this token the server can derive \ninformation about which user the request applies to, which shopping \nbasket the request applies to, what application specific settings or \noptions are known about the account this session is for (e.g. locale, \ntime-zone, theme, accessibility considerations, etc.) Because I have a \nsession token I have the option to separate into two groups the source \nof the implications of a request. That is, perhaps whether the &#39;theme&#39; \nis &#39;pink&#39; or &#39;blue&#39; will be something my application models as \ninformation implied by the &#39;subject&#39; of the request (i.e. the theme is a \nuser option associated with their account) or whether it&#39;s specified in \nthe &#39;object&#39; of the request (i.e. the URL contains the information about \nwhich theme the page should be rendered in).\n\n  - With one notable exception, the full &#39;API&#39; exposed by my application \ncan be completely encapsulated in hypermedia. As a case in point, there \nwill be a place in my URLs for specifying whether a link to a French \ntranslation should be on the page, or whether help for mobile users \nshould be on the page, etc. The exception to this is when it is not the \n&#39;object&#39; of the request but rather the &#39;subject&#39; that is the context \nwhich implies the suitability of &#39;French translation link&#39;, or &#39;Mobile \nhelp info&#39;. In such a case the lack or the availability of such data in \nresponses would be inferred by the server based on what it can derive \nfrom the &#39;session token&#39;.\n\nEr... I&#39;m going to have to cut this short. It&#39;s getting too long. \nHopefully someone on the list can see what I&#39;ve explained and &#39;infer&#39; \nthe blanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
