I would like to hear your experiences.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In particilar, the system I am writing will have output in XML and\n&gt;  &gt; JSON (input format is still TBD), so standard browser testers are not\n&gt;  &gt; as useful. Also there will be validation for some of the XML outputs.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Don&#39;t know what kind of environment you are in, but I&#39;ve had some good\n&gt;  success with Test::HTTP::Syntax[1] in perl. It requires a server be\n&gt;  running, but should be extensible to accept a mocked up HTTP request.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve started looking at twill[2] in python, which is supposed to be\n&gt;  able to intercept wsgi interactions (thus not requiring a running\n&gt;  server). It&#39;s very browser and form oriented rather than request,\n&gt;  resources and response, so it&#39;s not making me happy yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The benefit of both of these, especially Test::HTTP, is that you can\n&gt;  construct some requests, evaluate the responses and effectively\n&gt;  validate what you&#39;re getting back. Test::HTTP::Syntax gives you a\n&gt;  little DSL that has worked wonders in some situations.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think there&#39;s lots of room for improvement in these and similar tools.\n&gt;\n&gt;  [1] http://search.cpan.org/~mml/Test-HTTP-0.10/\n&gt;  [2] http://twill.idyll.org/\n&gt;\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Chris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nSubhash Chandran S\n\nhttp://rest-client.googlecode.com/\n\n"}}
