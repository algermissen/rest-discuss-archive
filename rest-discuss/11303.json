Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Ryan Tomayko wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to compile a list of gateway proxy cache implementations. I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; interested in anything that can plop down in front of an origin\n&gt;&gt; server and use the basic freshness and/or validation mechanisms\n&gt;&gt; defined in RFC 2616 Section 13 to serve up cached representations of\n&gt;&gt; resources generated by the origin (e.g., things that describe\n&gt;&gt; themselves as a &quot;reverse proxy cache&quot;, &quot;accelerator&quot;, or &quot;surrogate\n&gt;&gt; cache&quot;).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, if you find enough examples to warrant it, you could split the\n&gt; matrix into standalone cache components (reverse proxy with squid), and\n&gt; cache connectors for server components (Apache w/ mod_cache).\n\nSure will.\n\n&gt; One for the second category is Resin Pro, \n\nGreat. I assume this is it?:\n\nhttp://caucho.com/resin/doc/proxy-cache.xtp\n\n&gt; which meets all your criteria, unless you&#39;re restricting to open-source?\n\nNope. Non-free stuff is fine for my purposes. The goal is to see how \nwidespread support is for some of the more interesting caching features \n(like validation / invalidation) in modern systems. I figure non-free \nsoftware will be around for a few more years &lt;grin&gt; so I still include \nit in my definition of &quot;modern&quot;.\n\n&gt; If not, there are also plenty of appliances to consider, such as:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.juniper.net/products_and_services/app_performance.html\n\nThat&#39;s perfect. Thanks.\n\nRyan\n\n"}}
