A bit\ntricky, but I see how that&#39;s &quot;hyperlinking...&quot; and, thus RESTful.\n\nAnd the ETag issue can be handled if the server will send a hidden\nfield with the ETag value and deal with it on the PUT as it would the\nheader.\n\nMakes sense.\n\nMikeA\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Assaf Arkin &lt;assaf@...&gt;\nDate: Jan 2, 2008 10:43 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: Partial Updates\nTo: mike amundsen &lt;mca@...&gt;\n\n\nYou&#39;re replying off-list, not sure if it&#39;s intentional or accidental\n(it happens to me all to often with rest-discuss)\n\nOn Jan 2, 2008 5:15 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mca@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From my perspective, the representation of the resource (in my\n&gt; examples XML) doesn&#39;t change the pattern.  In my examples, the\n&gt; representation is just a medium (i rarely *store* data in XML anyway).\n&gt; I could be JSON, Atom, form-encoded, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thinking about your example (and imagining HTML FORMS *and browsers*\n&gt; finally allow PUT) still leads me to the same conclusions. Partial\n&gt; updates are risky when you want to ensure the integrity of the object\n&gt; being updated. The risk goes up as you add more users to the system.\n\nWhen it comes to forms, the server is in control of the exchange, so\nit directs the client to that subset of values it find acceptable.  So\nin this particular example, the server finds the risk not to be an\nissue, otherwise, it would serve a form with all the values.  And so\nfar, this seems easier (for me) to test and implement than partial\nresources of the form /resource/{id}/subset.\n\n\n&gt; To reduce the risk, I prefer to:\n&gt; - use only full PUT and use ETags to prevent updating a record that\n&gt; was already updated by someone else\n&gt; - using a new resource for updating sub-sections of the resource (PUT\n&gt; /resource/{id}/shippingaddress)\n&gt; - using atomic resources for optional, non-critical elements (PUT\n&gt; /resource/{id}/favorite-color)\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW - in all three examples, i still use the ETag to ensure update integrity.\n\nSo would I, except that hForms don&#39;t support ETag, but there are ways\naround it, maybe faking an _etag query parameter.\n\nAssaf\n\n\n&gt; Mike A\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 2, 2008 6:33 PM, Assaf Arkin &lt;assaf@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; To me, the use of XML is confusing, it leads to thinking of the\n&gt; &gt; resource in terms of a closed, well-formed document, coloring the\n&gt; &gt; decision.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s easier to start by talking about forms and URL-encoded\n&gt; &gt; updates, with XML being an alternative encoding.  For that, I can find\n&gt; &gt; a lot of interesting examples in the wild.  (Ignore the fact that\n&gt; &gt; hForms uses POST for now, think HTML 5 and PUT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * I can create a form that will update all the values associated with\n&gt; &gt; the resource, but also a form to update some of these values, or offer\n&gt; &gt; both alternatives for the same resource.  Is one better than the\n&gt; &gt; other?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * I can allow the form to mark which part of the resource gets\n&gt; &gt; updated, much the same way printed forms have an optional &#39;change of\n&gt; &gt; address&#39; part with a checkbox.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * I can pre-fill the form with existing values from the resource, and\n&gt; &gt; just write over the resource from all the request parameters.
