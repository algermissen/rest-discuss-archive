I&#39;m not sure\nwhat is considered best practice for JSON types. I would imagine that\nmost bets are off for plain text types.\n\nFor XML versioning, there are a number of schools of thought. One\nschool of thought puts a version number in the root element (Dave\nWiner likes to do this, I&#39;ve noticed). Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of\nthis approach - your mileage may vary. Another school of thought is\nthe hammer things down against a &#39;type-safe&#39; schema. I&#39;m not a fan of\nthis either (I have found XML Schema to be very brittle in the face of\nchange. Again, your mileage may vary. The school of thought that I\nsubscribe to uses what I call a &#39;loosely-typed&#39; schema (there may be\nmore correct terminology, I don&#39;t know). For me, loose schema typing\nuses the simplest possible element / attribute typing you can\nreasonably get away with (often this will simply be string) and makes\neverything optional. This way, the schema simply sets out what might\npossibly be in the message. I have found this to be far more robust in\nthe face of change. Admittedly, server implementations have to do\nharder work but client implementations will generally be simpler (a\ndivision of labour I approve of).\n\nIt&#39;s always worth keeping in mind Postel&#39;s Law (The Robustness\nPrinciple) of &quot;Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you\naccept from others.&quot;\n\nHere is some additional reading you might find useful:\n\n&quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\n\n&quot;[Editorial Draft] Extending and Versioning Languages: Terminology&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/versioning\n\n&quot;Compatibility articles&quot;\nhttp://pacificspirit.com/Authoring/Compatibility/\n\n&quot;Evolvability&quot; (TBL)\nhttp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Evolution.html\n\n&quot;Version Identifiers Reconsidered&quot; (W3C Q&A Weblog)\nhttp://www.w3.org/QA/2007/12/version_identifiers_reconsider.html\n\n&quot;Tolerance&quot; (Sam Ruby)\nhttp://intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/13/Tolerance/\n\nMore of my links on delicious\nhttp://delicious.com/alan.dean/versioning\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\n\nOn Fri, Aug 8, 2008 at 12:14 AM, vedams97 &lt;vedams97@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello All,\n&gt;\n&gt; Any one worked on REST versioning.
