Using HTTP/1.1 as a P2P protocol - the search for the \nResource could take some time, so either the Response takes a minute and \nkeeps the Request open (risking proxy timeout), or the line is &#39;pinged&#39; \nwith void chunks while the peer is waiting. (GET \nhttp://p2psystem/britney32541)\n\nExample 2.  Using HTTP/1.1 as a media streaming protocol: there is \n/never/ any content length - the channel just goes on and on, sending \nchunks... (GET http://britney-radio/)\n\nExample 3.  The Resource being fetched is not a simple file, but comes \nfrom a user interface (GET \nhttp://turing-test/is-it-britney?favourite+colour)\n\nExample 4.  The Resource is a user typing into a chat field at random \ntimes (GET http://britney-oracle/what-she-says-now)\n\n\nI&#39;m as interested in &#39;REST compliance&#39; as HTTP/1.1 compliance in the above.\n\n\n| Related issues in HTTP/1.1 context :\n|\n| (a) Was chunked transfer encoding designed for streaming media, or is \nthat usage a hack?\n| (b) Are proxies actually required to remove transfer encodings in \nHTTP/1.1?\n| (c) What does HTTP/1.1 say about request-response timeouts?\n| (d) What about inter-chunk timeouts?\n\n(OK, you can redirect me to an HTTP list for these!!  I couldn&#39;t find \nanything about the above from scanning RFC2616.)\n\n\nHope this all makes sense and I&#39;m not being too demanding with a big \nlist of questions, coming up to holiday time... :-)\n\n\nDuncan Cragg\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
