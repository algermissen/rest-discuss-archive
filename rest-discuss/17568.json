I&#39;m trying to improve my understanding\nof REST in exactly this area myself lately.\n&gt; From my reading, Amundsen is NOT using a generic type (such as\napplication/xml) - he is using a vendor specific but well documented type:\napplication/vnd.phactor+xml.  You can see the documentation here:\nhttp://amundsen.com/media-types/phactor/\n&gt; I don&#39;t know to what extent this is a real world media type or a sample of\nwhat a good one would look like, but it is definitely a vendor-specific\nmedia type.  To me, his slides are advocating for a looser coupling of\nclients and servers by defining the media type in terms of HOW you are going\nto relay information, not WHAT information you are sending/receiving.\n&gt; So, in the case of the maze example, every maze element is just a list of\nlinks that you could follow to another maze element.  Rather than define it\nin terms of\n&gt; &lt;maze&gt;&lt;connectedNodes&gt;&lt;maze id=&#39;m1&#39;/&gt;&lt;maze id=&#39;m2&#39;/&gt;&lt;maze\nid=&#39;m3&#39;/&gt;&lt;/connectedNodes&gt;&lt;/maze&gt;\n&gt; He defines it as\n&gt; &lt;maze&gt;&lt;collection href=&quot;http:/www.example/mazes&quot;&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;\nhttp://www.example.org/mazes/1&quot; rel=&quot;maze&quot; id=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;...&lt;/collection&gt;&lt;/maze&gt;\n&gt; Now, if you had a program that already understood the\napplication/vnd.phactor+xml media type, it would be able to understand this\nquite well.  Of course, if you want to do something particularly &quot;mazy&quot; with\nit, you would have to understand specifically the media type of\napplication/vnd.amundsen.maze+xml, but there&#39;s no getting around that I\nthink.\n&gt; That&#39;s the way I read it, but as I said, I&#39;m trying to get my head around\nthis stuff, too, so I&#39;d be interested in others&#39; thoughts on this just like\nyou.\n&gt; On Jun 6, 2011, at 10:54 AM, albertwylde wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am somewhat new to the REST architectural style, so please go easy on\nme.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am having difficulty understanding how a machine agent would understand\nthe content of my payload when using a generic media type.
