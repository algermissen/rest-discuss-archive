A client can  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; use  the URI of any steady-state and just proceed through the  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; application  from that point on without the need for any knowledge  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; about prior  interactions. If it can&#39;t, the representation is just  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; badly designed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; Are we drawing a distinction here between steady-state and entry- \n&gt;&gt; point?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, IMHO each steady state is a potential entry point.\n&gt;   \n\nI can&#39;t agree with that - and don&#39;t think the quote you dug up is \nreferring to this specific issue.\n\nFor a machine client, RESTing at a given steady state and establishing \nits &#39;meaning&#39; is a much more delicate affair than for a human client. We \nhave fuzzy methods of inference and contextualization with humans that \nwe just don&#39;t have the luxury of with machines.\n\nI think we need to agree on the definition of &#39;meaning&#39; in this \ncontext.. because, to me, it includes more than just the current set of \navailable link relations, and since we&#39;re not supposed to type resources \n- the only approach I can see working is predefined application flows \n(which may or may not contain several &#39;steady states&#39;) driven by link \nrelations.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
