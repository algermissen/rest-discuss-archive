I use atompub\nto expose different hierarchical collections of members.I would like\nthe client being an interactive command line tool. Additionally to be\nused as a feed reader, a consumer of the CLI would probably use it\nfor: bookmarking a collection; refreshing bookmarked collections;\nusing diff tools to compare local files and then POSTing the output\ncontent to a collection; etc.\n\nThe biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client\nenvironment executables files restfully?\n\nI need to access the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it\nfail any constraints the fact that the CLI would try to access the\ndiff executable tools under the hood? I would provide to the consumer\nthe hypermedia controls necessary to fill in the arguments that will\nbe passed to the executables. Just like HTML forms. What about\ncode-on-demand instead? The client would executes, as an example,\nshell scripting fragment depending on the client environment setup\ncapabilities. Just like the browser executes JavaScript? It has some\nadvantages that the client could be partly able to update itself.\n\nOtherwise I would need to let the server do the diff which will be\nretrieve by the client. But the client and the server will most of the\ntime be on the same machine or local network. The client needs to\naccess the file system and do operations on files, which the local web\nserver could do.\n\nAny advices? Thanks.\n-- Philippe\n\n"}}
