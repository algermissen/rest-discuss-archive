The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\n&gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http\n&gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\n&gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\n&gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n\nYep.\n\nAny application of cookies breaks REST, because they are by definition\nstateful, and all REST interactions are stateless.  That doesn&#39;t mean\nthey don&#39;t have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of doing\n&quot;sessions&quot; statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
