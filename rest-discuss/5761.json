If I  \nauthenticate a user for a request, I send that user a personalized  \nversion of the resource that says, &quot;Welcome, Chuck!&quot; If no user  \nauthenticates, then I send the same version I send to any  \nunauthenticated person, that says, &quot;Welcome, Guest!&quot; The single guest  \nversion gets an ETag and each personalized version gets a distinct ETag.\n\nAs another example, I agree with Claude Montpetit&#39;s recent post (in a  \ndifferent thread) that the same content expressed in different human  \nlanguages should have different URIs. In other words, I don&#39;t believe  \nin doing content negotiation on the Accept-Language header (for  \nusability reasons). However, I have been considering using that  \nheader to decide whether to include a prominent pointer to a  \ntranslation of the content, if one exists. If a user requests the URI  \nfor the English version of an article, for example, but indicate via  \nthe Accept-Language header they prefer French, and I have a French  \ntranslation at a different URI, I&#39;ll send them the English article  \nbut include a a prominent link to the French one. Here the user is  \nnot authenticated, but I see this as a kind of personalization of the  \ncontent. It would get an ETag of its own, because it has that extra  \nlink to the French translation.\n\nAnother way I&#39;ve imagined personalizing a resource is if a user lands  \non a page from a search engine. If a user hit an article after  \nsearching for &quot;spumoni&quot; on Google, I&#39;m considering sending a version  \nof that article with all occurrences of &quot;spumoni&quot; highlighted. In  \nthis case the representation is customized for the user because the  \nrequest headers indicated they are currently searching for spumoni.  \nThis representation would get its own ETag.\n\nIf a user authenticates as Chuck, has configured their browser to  \nindicate they prefer French via Accept-Language, searches Google for  \nspumoni, and lands on my English article, then I&#39;d send them back a  \npage that says &quot;Welcome, Chuck!&quot;, includes a link to the French  \ntranslation, and has all occurrences of the word &quot;spumoni&quot;  \nhighlighted. This would get an ETag of its very own, because it is a  \ndistinct personalization from the previous three in that it is the  \nintersection of the previous three.\n\nWould this be the RESTful way to think about personalization of  \nresources based on content negotiation?\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
