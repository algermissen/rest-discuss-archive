Cos tomorrow, the other server\n&gt; could stop serving that particular content-type from that resource? In\n&gt; that case, the URL should contain the Content-type, imho.\n&gt; \n\nThe server can&#39;t know the preferences or capabilities of clients from\none request to the next.  If a link to a negotiated resource is in\nquestion, and that resource stops serving a particular representation,\nthen clients can fall back to a representation in another MIME type it\nmay very well Accept.  Unless Content-Type is encoded in the URI, which\ncouples things together such that the client can&#39;t fall back, defeating\nthe entire purpose of the negotiated resource in the first place.\n\nAgain, an HTML author or generator can simply link directly to the\nspecific resource by linking to the URI returned in Content-Location\ninstead of linking to the negotiated URI.  If that resource ceases to\nexist the response will be 410 Gone, but the negotiated URI won&#39;t\ndisappear:  it will just serve a different set of representations.  If\nan author or generator only ever wants a specific MIME type, then they\nshould link to that resource directly instead of the negotiated\nresource, no encoding of Content-Type in the URI is necessary.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My  argument is : there is server side negotiation and there is agent\n&gt; driven negotiation (in RFC i.e). An Accept: in the &lt;a&gt;,&lt;img&gt; links in\n&gt; neither.\n&gt; \n\nIf @accept is used to override one Accept header with another before\nthe client sends the request, then it&#39;s still server-side negotiation\nat the protocol level.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
