Costello wrote:\n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt;  \n&gt; My question is with regards to the role of a Web site in supporting\n&gt; queries.  Let me give an example to demonstrate what I mean.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose that a Web site implements this &quot;hierarchical model of\n&gt; resources&quot; for a bombing mission:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mission\n&gt;     Plan1\n&gt;          ...\n&gt;     Plan2\n&gt;         Aircraft\n&gt;             AA36\n&gt;                 ...\n&gt;             BB06\n&gt;                 Payload\n&gt;                     Bomb1\n&gt;                         ...\n&gt;                     Bomb2\n&gt;                         Fuze5\n\n&gt;  \n\nThat said, I understand the desire to enable a user to query to a Web\nsite for information such as &quot;what aircraft carry Bomb1?&quot;. \n&gt; That&#39;s not a particularly satisfying solution.  Perhaps there a way to\n&gt; rephrase the question so that it involves an exchange of resources,\n&gt; rather than a query exchange?    \n&gt;  \n&gt; I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this issue. \n\n*An* approach Roger.\n  Perhaps just a variant view of a query?\nThe url is &#39;missing&#39; some bits.\n\n/mission/*/X/Payload/Bomb1\n\nThe question is, what is X?\n\nI know I can capture the url sought from the get,\nso perhaps I can return a list of url&#39;s for which X is valid?\n\nregards DaveP\n\n\n"}}
