You&#39;ve been here long enough to know that Seairth! 8-O\n&gt; &gt; With REST, you&#39;re constrained to using methods that you could use on\n&gt; &gt; anything.  So &quot;CREATE&quot; isn&#39;t a REST method, because I don&#39;t know what\n&gt; &gt; it would mean to invoke that on a URI identifying a stock quote.\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh?  This is the first time I&#39;ve heard that all RESTful methods must be\n&gt; usable on *anything*.  All I understood of REST was that you should use a\n&gt; few, generic methods.  Within the domain that Groove is functioning, their\n&gt; choice of methods are RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; *sigh* Just when I thought that I understood this REST thing...\n\nOops. 8-(\n\nYah, that&#39;s what &quot;uniform interface&quot; means.  If a method doesn&#39;t mean\nsomething to everything you can invoke it on, then it&#39;s not uniform!\nIt&#39;s like being restricted to interacting with Java objects by using\njava.lang.Object.\n\nThe uniform interface constraint is really two constraints in one.\nFirst, there&#39;s the constraint that you need to prespecify the methods\nyou&#39;ll use, for visibility and low-coordination cost reasons.  Second,\nthere&#39;s the additional constraint that the interface will be the most\ngeneral one possible, which you get by constraining that all methods\nare usable on everything.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; While HTTP is RESTful, not all things RESTful are HTTP.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s true, but largely irrelevant today; it&#39;s all we&#39;ve got that is.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it is largely irrelevant today, then why do we talk about REST at all?\n&gt; Why not just talk about HTTP Best Practices instead?  If HTTP is the only\n&gt; RESTful thing we will be using for any forseeable future, REST concepts\n&gt; would get much further if we were to just put it aside and get people to\n&gt; focus on HTTP...\n\nThat&#39;s what some of us are doing, but it&#39;s also useful to focus on REST\nto explain how some HTTP related things are broken. e.g. cookies.  Plus,\nsometimes it&#39;s not obvious from just looking at RFC 2616 why things are\nthe way they are.  That&#39;s where REST helps.  For example, statelessness.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.  Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca             http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
