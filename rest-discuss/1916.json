Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kind of a catch-22 sure, but the &#39;not change state&#39; constraint has to do\n&gt; &gt; with the intent of the GET - sending a GET request in order to modify\nstate\n&gt; &gt; and as the documented mechanism for that resource is what should be\navoided.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The hit-counter problem is a fuzzy area of the &#39;GET is safe and\nidempotent&#39;\n&gt; &gt; requirement, but I don&#39;t think the requirement is so constraining that\n&gt; &gt; hit-counters are not allowed. I believe a resource can be defined in\nterms\n&gt; &gt; of the history of that resource and not just some static data values\n&gt; &gt; somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. Here is the way I think about it: if you make a POST operation\n&gt; with side effects and some stupid client calls it a million times, any\n&gt; side effects are THEIR fault. If you make a GET operation with side\n&gt; effects and some stupid client calls it a million times, any side\n&gt; effects are YOUR fault and YOUR problem. If you don&#39;t mind a massively\n&gt; inflated hit counter then go ahead, use GET. If it is important to\n&gt; maintain an accurate count of intentional client actions, then use POST.\n\nSo... the difference between GET and POST in terms of &quot;dynamic&quot; resources is\nentirely in the intent.  GET say &quot;given this identifier, give me whatever\nyou&#39;ve got&quot;, while POST says &quot;given this identifier and addtional data, do\nwhatever you are going to do with it, then give me whatever you&#39;ve got\nafterwards&quot;.  Either can return a representation of a resource that changes\nwith each request, but only POST does this by intent.  Yes?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
