I understand you want to tell me that\nour products should follow RFC document. But unfortunately, in most\ncases, we take these documents as a reference instead of following it\ncompletely. Anyway, I agree with you that Cache-Control tag is not\ndirectly related to ETag.\n\nI&#39;ve discuss the issue with a senior engineer in our team. According\nto the discussion, we decide to feedback your issue to our product\nteam. However, the request may takes a long time for the product team\nto handle as they have to decide if there is any side effect for this\nmodification. Furthermore, I can&#39;t determine whether they will fix it\nor not. In any stage of the process of the fix request, the product\nteam may have authority to reject this request. This is completely out\nof my control. Sorry for that.\n\nI&#39;ll keep you update about the latest status of the request. Your\npatience will be greatly appreciated!&quot;\n\nSo, at least they acknowledge the issue (although with no promise to fix).\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
