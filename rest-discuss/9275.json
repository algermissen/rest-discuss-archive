I don&#39;t see a clear winner.\n\nThat&#39;s inaccurate. First, Content-Range is known to be ignored by\n*origin servers*. Second, I wonder how many proxies block PATCH, but\nnot PUT. I know there are several that explicitly block PROPFIND, etc.\nbecause Microsoft security bugs. There are also several that block\neverything except for GET, POST, and HEAD. If you really want to\ntunnel around obnoxious proxies, just add an X-No-Really: header to\nPOST requests. This would work on TMobile USA, for instance, but PUT\nwith Content-Range would not. Or use HTTPS, which is impervious to\nproxies.\n\nThere are several choices that don&#39;t require broken standards.\nTransparency is a good thing. There is a trade-off, in that cheap and\nobvious request routing is more prone to proxy meddling on insecure\nchannels. Who desperately needs to deploy insecure PUT requests on a\nmassive scale?\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
