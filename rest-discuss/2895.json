One could also code up an evaluator that \n&gt; determined if the transaction evidence followed the rules or not.\n\nRight.  And as I remember us talking about before, it&#39;s very important\nthat all this be done in the context of stateless interaction.  How that\nwould look, given the complexity of the stuff you listed, could be\nquite gnarly.  It&#39;s the issue about whether the meaning is encapsulated\nin the identifier, or in what the identifier might resolve to at any\ngiven time.  Sometimes, it might be necessary to include some of the\nthings you mentioned by *value* in a message, rather than just by\nreference with a URI.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
