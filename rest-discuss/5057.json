Has anyone explored this aspect of interface design\nat all?   A GET at /=\r\nservices could return an XOXO document that\npoints to and describes the var=\r\nious other available services.\n\nIt would be nice if, using XOXO and RDF For=\r\nms, the entire \ninterface description could be discovered by crawling the \n=\r\nservices as opposed to declaring them all a priori.

RDF F=\r\norms is used in a manner similar to an HTML form in that\n&gt;    they are obta=\r\nined at &quot;runtime&quot; in order to construct an actual\n&gt;    request at a particu=\r\nlar URI.  WRDL on the other hand, \n&gt;    (while still obtainable using a GET=\r\n) is more geared towards \n&gt;    declaring the entire service interface befor=\r\ne hand.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Actually then, they could be used together.\n&gt; \n&gt;    If both=\r\n were used to describe a particular service, the \n&gt;    WRDL would be declar=\r\ned to return an RDF Form with the GET,\n&gt;    and presumably the WRDL would a=\r\nlso declare the same type\n&gt;    of representation/document that the RDF Form=\r\n would \n&gt;    construct for a POST and GET query string.  In that regard\n&gt;  =\r\n  there would be some overlap.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Are these statements accurate?\n\nI su=\r\nppose there&#39;s some ambiguity, but I see them as doing pretty much\nthe same =\r\nthing.  If you made the value of WRDL&#39;s &quot;representations&quot;\nattribute, media =\r\ntypes, then I think we&#39;d be declaring almost exactly\nthe same thing.  RDF F=\r\norms just goes a bit more abstract using class\nnames to suggest operational=\r\n semantics, whereas WRDL uses the operations\nthemselves.\n\n&gt; 2. With WRDL it=\r\n is possible to specify multiple possible \n&gt;    document types that could b=\r\ne submitted with POST.\n&gt;   \n&gt;    Is it possible to declare an RDF Form that=\r\n allows multiple\n&gt;    document types?  E.g., the ability to submit a Book o=\r\nr a\n&gt;    CD representation to an Order resource?\n\nYup, just specify multipl=\r\ne acceptedMediaType triples.\n\n&gt; 3. Is there a way to define a PUT operation=\r\n in RDF Forms?\n\nIt was in there initially (as a Replaceable class), but I r=\r\nemoved it,\nfiguring that PUT wasn&#39;t parameterizable so didn&#39;t need it (i.e.=\r\n it&#39;s\nuse was implicit).  I&#39;ve recently thought about adding it back in to\n=\r\nsupport declaring the accepted media types.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
