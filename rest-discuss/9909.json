(but the\n&gt; /user/current/ is just a local state file).\n\nLike a newsreader&#39;s newsrc file, you mean?  Because yeah, exactly, is\nwhat I&#39;d do with JS *if* I could depend on it being there, and didn&#39;t\nmind the overhead of two http requests: pull the newsrc-line\nequivalent with a user-specific URL (to continue the newsrc analogy,\nthat would be part of the subscription resource), and run down the\nlist of posts on the thread page and flag all the ones that are unread\nbased on that newsrc.\n\nExcept then that leads to the question of whether it&#39;s really much of\na leap to ask the server to do combining that for you, to support\nthose dumb clients.  Perhaps http://domain/threadlocationbit for the\ncanonical and ...threadlocationbit?someflag=set for the customized\none, where the latter returns the canonical version in the\nContent-Location header, and such other stuff as is needed to make\nsure smarter clients don&#39;t mistake it for other than the compromise it\nis.\n\n"}}
