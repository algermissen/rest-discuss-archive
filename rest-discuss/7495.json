But I think you are\n&gt; trying to design a web in which clients learn you rules of hierarchy\n&gt; and then navigate your site by synthesizing URL&#39;s by following\n&gt; the rules.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, URIs are supposed to be opaque from the client\n&gt; angle, and it should by hypertext that is guiding them along the\n&gt; path from one resource to the next.  Have you read up much on\n&gt; these concepts?\n&gt;\nURIs are supposed to be opaque from the client program perspective,  \nbut may not be opaque from the client user perspective. People may  \nuse the URI to glean information about the information architecture  \nof the site. Jakob Nielsen talks about this topic here:\n\nhttp://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html\n\nIn observing my own behavior while using other people&#39;s web sites, I  \nnoticed I occasionally find myself hacking off pieces of a URI in the  \nhopes of finding something conceptually higher up in the hierarchy.  \nIt usually didn&#39;t work, but I tried. I did not add things to URIs,  \nbut I did try to subtract things. I want URI hacking that to always  \nwork at the websites whose URIs and information architecture I  \ndesign. Where I depart from Mike&#39;s approach is that I would still  \npick one hierarchy from his many possibilities, and have one  \ncanonical URI for each resource.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
