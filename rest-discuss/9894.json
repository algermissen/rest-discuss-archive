It&#39;s the \n&gt; cookie (to be used only in the XHR &#39;personalizing&quot; request) that handles \n&gt; identity (and NOT as part of the page request).  Requesting the page URI \n&gt; returns the exact same resource no matter who the user is (and thus it&#39;s \n&gt; cacheable).  It&#39;s the CLIENT that &quot;decides&quot; if it wants to take the next \n&gt; step and personalize the page by firing an XHR.\n&gt; \n\nThere&#39;s a fuzzy issue here of just what exactly constitutes a resource. \nThere&#39;s a line beyond which sufficient client personalization has \ncreated a new resource, and such a resource should have its own URL.\n\nAs a practical matter, I think sites work better when there are more \nURLs rather than fewer. States of an application/resource should be \nidentified by URLs. Too few URLs is often problematic. I&#39;ve yet to \nencounter a site where there were so many URLs I had problems using it, \nbut I daily encounter sites that use one URL to identify things I&#39;d like \nto link to or bookmark individually.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
