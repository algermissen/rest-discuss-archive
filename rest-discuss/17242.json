However, I thought, it might also be worth asking a REST=\r\n community for clarifying this issue.\nI know there are also already some di=\r\nscussions on this mailing list that are related somewhere, somehow to this =\r\ntopic (see [2,3,4,5] at least, especially in the recent past). Nevertheless=\r\n, I didn&#39;t found any information resource that satisfiable (from my POV) co=\r\nvered the related topic.\nSo, here we go. Here are my findings and thoughts =\r\nabout the relation of Linked Data/Semantic Web to REST (cf. [1]):\n\n\nHow are=\r\n\n\n    * the principles of Linked Data as data publishing guide (independent=\r\n of Semantic Web technology) and\n    * the Semantic Web as common, standard=\r\nized technology stack for machine-processable knowledge representation and =\r\nmanagement in the Web [6]\n\nrelated to the\n\n    * the principles of REST as =\r\nan architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems?\n\nLet&#39;s take the =\r\nconstraints of the REST architectural style as figured out [7]:\n\n    * Reso=\r\nurce Identification\n    * Uniform Interface\n    * Self-Describing Messages\n=\r\n    * Hypermedia Driving Application State\n    * Stateless Interactions (se=\r\ne [8] for a good explanation what stateless in this context mean)\n\n\nResourc=\r\ne Identification is clearly address in point 1 (URIs) and 2 (HTTP URIs) of =\r\nthe Linked Data principles as defined by timbl[9]. However, the explicit su=\r\nggestion of the use of HTTP URIs is against the REST feature of a uniform g=\r\neneric interface between components (&quot;A REST API should not be dependent on=\r\n any single communication protocol&quot;, see [10]). Identification is separated=\r\n from interaction.\n\n\nIs the common, layered Semantic Web technology stack a=\r\n implementation of a Uniform Interface re. REST principles? Or is it only H=\r\nTTP as communication protocol? And what does &quot;The same small set of operati=\r\nons applies to everything&quot; then mean? Do I have to enable an processing of =\r\nevery operation on every (information) resource? Or does this mean, that I =\r\nonly have to provide a uniform behaviour of processing of operations on (in=\r\nformation) resource, i.e. if a specific operation is not possible or allow =\r\non a specific resource, then the component has to communicate this in a uni=\r\nform way?\nA verification re. the issue of how the small set of operations o=\r\nf the Uniform Interface have to be support (on the implementation example o=\r\nf HTTP):\n\n    HTTP operations are generic: they are allowed or not, per res=\r\nource, but they are always valid. (see [11])\n\nThis is in accord with my las=\r\nt statement.\n\nAs the common, layered Semantic Web technology stack uses HTT=\r\nP as communication protocol, it uniformly defines/provides also the small s=\r\net of operations of the Uniform Interface. However, the media types define =\r\nprocessing models (&quot;Every media type defines a default processing model.&quot;, =\r\nsee [12]). Thereby, layered encoding is possible (see [13]) e.g., &quot;applicat=\r\nion/rdf+turtle&quot;: RDF Model as knowledge representation structure (data mode=\r\nl) and Turtle as syntax (other knowledge representation languages, i.e. RDF=\r\n Schema are provided &quot;in-band&quot;, via namespace references). Furthermore,\n\n  =\r\n  The media type identifies a specification that defines how a representati=\r\non is to be processed. (see [14])\n\nSide note: I know, there is some progres=\r\ns in providing media type specification as resources with a URI. However, a=\r\ns far as I know, there their resource URIs lack of a good machine-processab=\r\nle, dereferencable specification description, i.e. the lack of a machine-pr=\r\nocessable HTML specification that enables a machine agent to know that &quot;the=\r\n anchor elements with an href attribute create a hypertext link that, when =\r\nselected, invokes a retrieval request (GET)&quot; (this issue is derived from co=\r\nmmunity statement and is not really verified, however, I currently would ag=\r\nree with it ;) ; please correct me, if this assertion is wrong). All in all=\r\n, an agent must be able to automatically learn the processing model of a pr=\r\neviously unknown media type, if wanted (analogues the HTTP Upgrade header f=\r\nield). I know, that there is also some progress (discussion) in the TAG com=\r\nmunity re. a better introduction of new media types.\n\nTo summarize, the imp=\r\nortant aspect is that the media type specifications and the knowledge repre=\r\nsentation language specifications in general have to the define the process=\r\ning model of specific link types (e.g. href in HTML) also in a machine-proc=\r\nessable way (is this currently really the case? - I would say no!). This is=\r\n addressed by the constraints &quot;Self-Describing Messages&quot; and &quot;Hypermedia Dr=\r\niving Application State&quot; (a.k.a. HATEOAS).\nThat means, I would (currently) =\r\nconclude that only the methods of the HTTP protocol are an implementation o=\r\nf a set of operations of a Uniform Interface and Semantic Web knowledge rep=\r\nresentation languages are related to the other two constraints.\n\n\nSelf-Desc=\r\nribing Messages are enforced for machine processing by using as basis the c=\r\nommon knowledge representation languages of the Semantic Web (i.e. RDF Mode=\r\nl, RDF Schema, OWL, RIF) and all knowledge representation languages (incl. =\r\nfurther Semantic Web ontologies) are referenced in this &#39;message&#39;. This is =\r\nsomehow generalized in the third Linked Data principles as defined by timbl=\r\n[9] (&quot;provide useful information, using the standards&quot;).\n\n\nThe forth Linked=\r\n Data principle as defined by timbl[9] (&quot;Include links to other URIs &quot;) is =\r\nsomehow related to Hypermedia Driven Application State of the REST principl=\r\nes. This principle can again be powered for better machine processing by us=\r\ning the common knowledge representation languages of the Semantic Web as ba=\r\nsis. However, I&#39;m a bit unclear how the links drive my application state. A=\r\nlthough, I guess that the application state would change when navigating to=\r\n a resource by dereferencing a link (HTTP URI).\nThis is explained in the in=\r\ntroduction section of Principled Design of the Modern Web Architecture[13]:=\r\n\n\n    The name &quot;Representational State Transfer&quot; is intended to evoke an im=\r\nage of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a network of Web pages =\r\nforms a virtual state machine allowing a user to progress through the appli=\r\ncation by selecting a link or submitting a short data-entry form, with each=\r\n action resulting in a transition to the next state of the application by t=\r\nransferring a representation of that state to the user.\n\n\nStateless Interac=\r\ntion is not really covered by the Linked Data principles as defined by timb=\r\nl[9], or? Although, when realizing &quot;state as a resource&quot; (cf. [15]), I can =\r\nuse again the common knowledge representation languages of the Semantic Web=\r\n as basis for describing states and using HTTP URIs to make these resources=\r\n also accessible.\n\n\nWould you agree with (parts of) my interpretation?\nFina=\r\nlly, are the principles of Linked Data really only intended to be read-only=\r\n. I though read and write would better fit to the principles of REST, or?\n\n=\r\nSource, where this topic is also discussed somehow:\n\n    * Linked Data for =\r\nRESTafarians [16]\n    * Linked Data and REST architectural style [2]\n    * =\r\nRESTful Design Patterns, httpRange-14 & Linked Data [17]\n    * Principled D=\r\nesign of the Modern Web Architecture [13]\n\n\nThanks a lot for all your effor=\r\nts in participating in this discussion and clarifying this issue.\n\nCheers,\n=\r\n\n\nBob\n\n\n[1] http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/2763/the-relation-of-=\r\nlinked-data-semantic-web-to-rest\n[2] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/res=\r\nt-discuss/message/12181\n[3] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss=\r\n/message/17057\n[4] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/=\r\n16403\n[5] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/16971\n[6]=\r\n http://smiy.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/the-common-layered-semantic-web-techn=\r\nology-stack/\n[7] http://dret.net/netdret/docs/soa-rest-www2009/rest#%2811%2=\r\n9\n[8] https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3D6432484966567158349&postID=\r\n=3D3673658851645058486\n[9] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html\n[=\r\n10] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n[=\r\n11] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#c=\r\nomment-732\n[12] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypert=\r\next-driven#comment-730\n[13] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/documents/2002-R=\r\nEST-TOIT.pdf\n[14] http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hype=\r\nrtext-driven#comment-754\n[15] http://dret.net/netdret/docs/soa-rest-www2009=\r\n/rest#%2843%29\n[16] http://webofdata.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/linked-data-f=\r\nor-restafarians/\n[17] http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2009/07/=\r\nrestful-design-patterns-httprange14.html \n\n\n"}}
