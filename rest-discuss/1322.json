So go ahead and use one. My\nonly complaints are:\n\n a) they don&#39;t generate events in my inbox\n\n b) the editing user interface is so brutal.\n\nThere are so many web-based forums out there these days that the\nlimitations of web browsers as text editors are becoming really\nannoying. One day I have to think about whether this is purely an\nimplementation issue or a lack of standardization. For instance maybe\nthere should be an attribute that would indicate whether a textarea can\ncontain HTML, so that the editor could use its HTML editor. Maybe there\nshould be a way to say &quot;UserWillWantSpellCheck&quot;.  Also as an\nimplementation issue it is bad that the &quot;back button&quot; can lose your\nedits. But I know these are not problems with wiki in particular and I\nwill be happy to work on the Wiki.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
