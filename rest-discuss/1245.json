(I&#39;m not arguing, just thinking about it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anything transactional.\n\nQuestion for you:  what do you mean by &quot;transactional&quot;?\nI tried to explain what I mean below.  \nI don&#39;t think anything like the database concept of a transaction is \nappropriate across trust boundaries.  (I thought from earlier \ncomments that you agreed.)\n\nClarification of my earlier question: I don&#39;t deny that sessions may \nbe the best way to go sometimes.  The question was if they are \nactually necessary, that is, if you can&#39;t get the same results from \nmaking the interaction into a resource some way.  Possibly dumb way: \nmake the transaction itself into a resource. (Or maybe not so dumb...)\n\n&gt; &gt; By the way, when I use the word &quot;transaction&quot; here, I \nmean &quot;business \n&gt; &gt; state alignment&quot; not database.  So there is no rollback.  The \n&gt; &gt; resources just fail to advance to the next state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rollback could still be attempted.  It doesn&#39;t mean it has to\n&gt; successful, but just knowing that it isn&#39;t may be useful\n&gt; information to signal that that some compensatory type action\n&gt; needs to be taken.  But if it does work, then that&#39;s even better!\n\nBut what would you roll back? (Or maybe, what situations do you have \nin mind where rollback would be an appropriate concept?)\n\nExample:  in an offer-acceptance transaction, let&#39;s say the offer \nstarts out in a &quot;pending&quot; state. \nIf the transaction ends normally, the offer advances to \nthe &quot;accepted&quot; state or the &quot;rejected&quot; state depending on the \nresponse.\n\nIf the transaction does not end normally (times out, etc.) the offer \nis still &quot;pending&quot;.  No rollback, it just doesn&#39;t change to \neither &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;rejected&quot; - although the practical equivalent \nof &quot;rejected&quot; might be inferred.\n\nIn RosettaNet (and ebXML copying RNet) there is a &quot;Notification of \nFailure&quot; that is sent via a different channel in cases where the end \nof the transaction might not be clear to both parties.  It&#39;s a \ncompensatory action.  Might be considered rollback if one party had \nthought the transaction succeeded.\n\nI know RNet and ebXML are EDI-mailbox-style, but they also pretty \nclosely adhere to commercial law and customs, so there are some real \nbusiness requirements behind their ways of doing things.  So I&#39;m \ntrying to see if I can get the same adherance to commercial law and \ncustoms from a purely REST configuration, and in this case, with no \nsessions or conversation or transaction dispatch tags.\n\nThere are reasons for wanting to do this that I could try to explain \nif they are not obvious.  I&#39;m still not sure how far it is necessary \nor wise to push the idea, thus these questions on this forum where \npeople seem to know how to think about it.\n\n\n"}}
