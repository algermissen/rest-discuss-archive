T=\r\nhe server occasionally gets duplicate \n&gt; requests from clients, which, sinc=\r\ne these requests are not idempotent, \n&gt; causes problems. I hypothesize that=\r\n the double-requests are occuring \n&gt; when the server gets busy, and doesn&#39;t=\r\n respond to a request within a \n&gt; certain time frame, so the client (someti=\r\nmes IE, sometimes our own \n&gt; software) decides to resend the request. The t=\r\nwo get queued up and \n&gt; handled one right after each other by the server.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I want to change the state-effecting operations to use POST, but to \n&gt; =\r\njustify the change in the software, I&#39;m seeking evidence that using\nPOST \n&gt;=\r\n might resolve this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are web browsers prone to automatically r=\r\nesending GET requests, if they \n&gt; don&#39;t hear back from the server within, s=\r\nay 5 seconds?  Or 30 seconds?  \n&gt; Will the same thing happen with a POST?  =\r\nThanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lyle Kopnicky\n&gt; Software Project Engineer\n&gt; Veicon Techn=\r\nology, Inc.\n&gt;\n\nFirefox is especially prone to this as there are various add=\r\n-ons that\nprovide auto-refresh functionality for example: see\nhttps://addon=\r\ns.mozilla.org/firefox/115/\n\nThis is why the GET and HEAD methods should be =\r\nsafe (see\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):\n\n&quot;In part=\r\nicular, the convention has been established that the GET and\nHEAD methods S=\r\nHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action\nother than retrieval.&quot;\n=\r\n\nAlan Dean\nLead Developer, OnlineTravel.com\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
