From our perspective that&#39;s a lot better than\n&gt; have to duplicate the photo controller behavior for stuff under our\n&gt; user controller (and again where ever else we end up have sets of photos).\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think of this choice and reasoning?\n\nI&#39;m working on a project in which we faced a similar challenge. The URIs we \nlaunched the project with follow your /users/100 and /photos/201 approach, with \nno hierarchy information for photos belonging to users. However, we are changing \nthis.\n\nWe will still maintain the /photos/201 URIs, but they will simply redirect to \nour canonical /users/100/photos/201 URIs. We settled on this structure because \nwe believe it conveys the proper hierarchy.\n\nAs far as programming goes, we&#39;re using the routing features of the framework we \nuse to allow us to keep the same controller structure we currently have, but the \nroutes are set up as such that we don&#39;t have to duplicate any code.\n\n&gt; Our second problem has to do how an item that is part of a collection\n&gt; of items (say a particular photo in the big list of photos from the\n&gt; above example) can carry the context of it&#39;s containing set and yet\n&gt; meet the needs for canonical uris that seem to be an important part of\n&gt; designing REST websites. Here&#39;s an example of what I mean.\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; Now here&#39;s our idea of what a similar resource would be like if the\n&gt; user navigated to a photo via a user:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /photos/201/user/100\n\nTo me, this URI looks as if you are viewing a user resource via a photo and not \nthe other way around, as you have suggested. The hierarchy here isn&#39;t logical to me.\n\nIn our case, again, we settled on conveying the ownership of the photos in the \ncanonical URIs, so in every place that &quot;photos&quot; appear in a collection of items \n(for example, at /photos), they still link to /users/100/photos/201.\n\nOf course, you can contrast this with flickr, which uses /photos/{username}/201, \nbut, in this case 201 refers to the photo resource, which I think is logical.\n\n-- \nBen Ramsey\nhttp://benramsey.com/\n\n"}}
