Can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; someone point me to a good definition of &quot;application state&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s literally the *state* of the *application*.  If you&#39;re looking  \n&gt;&gt; at\n&gt;&gt; your bank balance, that&#39;s a different state than if you were  \n&gt;&gt; preparing\n&gt;&gt; to submit a bill payment, and once you&#39;ve submitted the payment,\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re in yet another state in the application state machine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mark.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to add to Mark&#39;s definition, and put it in the context of  \n&gt; &quot;application&quot; and &quot;application protocol&quot;: if we think of an  \n&gt; application as being computer behavior that achieves a particular  \n&gt; goal, we can describe an application protocol as the specification  \n&gt; of the legitimate interactions necessary to realize that behavior,  \n&gt; and application state as a snapshot of the instance of execution of  \n&gt; an application protocol.\n\nThanks for the definitions. I&#39;m still a bit confused though, so I&#39;m  \ngoing to try to use an example:\n\nLet&#39;s say we have an client/ua that is filling out an order (order +  \nline items). In a traditional web application, the order would be in  \nthe http session, and we would add/remove line items to that order,  \nand finally place the order. In that case I clearly see that we are  \ntalking about application state that is placed on the server. The  \nserver keeps track of it, and it&#39;s literally the state of the client/ \napplication.\n\nBut if we were to store and address the order like any other resource,  \nwould that change the nature of the state? It would simply be another  \nway of storing the same state, but nevertheless it would be  \n&quot;resources&quot; with the same properties induced by the stateless  \nconstraint (visibility, reliability, and salability) - given that they  \nwere stored in the a way that make that possible. To me, this looks  \nlike exactly the same kind of state (application state), simply stored/ \nmodeled differently. But in that case I don&#39;t see how or if it  \nviolates the stateless constraint.\n\nWould you say that the order in this example is always a &quot;snapshot of  \nthe instance execution of an application protocol&quot;, and that it will  \nalways be application state - no matter how it&#39;s modeled? And by  \nplacing it on the server it would be in violation of the REST  \nprinciples, even though the stateless constraint is dealt with?\n\n--\nThanks,\nKristian\n\n"}}
