In other words, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\n&gt; correct to use:\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://example.org/bob\n&gt; [2] http://example.org/virginia\n&gt;\n&gt; If /bob and /virginia are not equivalent resources, i.e. aren&#39;t the same\n&gt; type, or as I prefer to say, not in the same set.  But the subdirectories,\n&gt; as far as I&#39;m concerned that REST is concerned, could be named /xyzzy/ and\n&gt; /yxzzx/.\n&gt;\nHow about rather than assessing an approach being a boolean REST or\nnot-REST, we just assign points based on how many aspects of an\napproach are commonly seen as being useful around the Web?\nSo in your example, using identifiers for resources gets you one\npoint, and if you add a document pointing to each resource with\nmetadata on those pointers that hint at the &#39;type&#39; of resource you\nwould have gotten another point. In this case, some XML (or other\nformat) like the following would help indicate how to interact with\nthat resource.\n &lt;stuff&gt;\n  &lt;person href=&quot;/bob&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;location href=&quot;/virginia&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\nWhich means that we should not be so worried about &quot;being REST&quot; as we\nshould about solving the actual problems with reasonably well\ndemonstrated approaches.\n\n"}}
