Running code has definitive\n&gt;&gt; behaviour: http://caniuse.com/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is a defined architectural style.  The link you&#39;ve posted is all\n&gt; about where a set of moving-goalpost features overlap at a moment in\n&gt; time, which is hardly the same thing.  While system behavior may be\n&gt; definable, it&#39;s a by-product of the design process, as opposed to goals\n&gt; used to guide the design process.  What I mean by defined architecture\n&gt; would be some sort of Taylor-school definition of just what&#39;s trying to\n&gt; be accomplished, like REST was the model for the move to HTTP 1.1.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What is it, specifically, that you feel may be about to render\n&gt;&gt; browsers infeasible as the basis for a RESTful system?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Silent error correction, content sniffing being used as a reason to\n&gt; deprecate Content-Type, any number of RFC 3986 violations -- we&#39;re\n&gt; clearly off into uncharted territory with little or no resemblance to\n&gt; REST, and I&#39;ve just scratched the surface.  What else to make of this\n&gt; move to just not mention &quot;resource&quot; and redefine URIs to identify\n&gt; either documents or services?  How is it possible to be more anti-REST?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there anything missing that would make it feasible and if so why\n&gt;&gt; is it missing? e.g. why did the efforts to introduce PUT and DELETE\n&gt;&gt; to &lt;form&gt; fail?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s missing is browser-vendor knowledge of architecture, or any HTTP/\n&gt; URI interoperability issues not involving browsers.  I won&#39;t speculate\n&gt; as to why, it&#39;s not as if Roy didn&#39;t used to waste his breath explaining\n&gt; to these people the finer points of why ad-hoc changes to WebArch are\n&gt; short-sighted.  Sufficient explanation to me of why no PUT, DELETE,\n&gt; Xforms, list goes on -- not to mention feature removal...\n&gt;\n&gt; Clearly, the future of REST no longer lies with the browser.  My status\n&gt; nowadays is &quot;on sabbatical&quot; to recover my health, after recently &quot;re-\n&gt; homing&quot; the last of my clients -- that one since 1994 which is how long\n&gt; I&#39;ve been developing Web sites for consumption in browsers.  I have a 9-\n&gt; week-old Alaskan Malamute to help me drop at least a couple stone before\n&gt; I return, may take a few years.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll continue to participate here, but when I return to Web development\n&gt; it certainly looks like I&#39;ll be forsaking the browser for the native\n&gt; app, where I can continue to bring my clients positive returns on their\n&gt; online investments by leveraging REST to deal with the realities of the\n&gt; netowrk currently being denied by the browser vendors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Should be interesting to watch, but the &quot;new direction&quot; has caused me\n&gt; to pull my horse from the race; I no longer have any vested interest\n&gt; nor do I care about the future of browsers.  Only a sense that we&#39;ll be\n&gt; cleaning up the mess for a long time to come -- corporate production\n&gt; cycles, marketing imperatives, and bottom lines are no way to guide\n&gt; the Web&#39;s architectural development, and this era can&#39;t end well.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
