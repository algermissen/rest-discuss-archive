The main focus\nis Flask, but it seems Flask is most useful in a REST context; for Web\nGUI&#39;s, one would probably use Django or something instead.\n\nI&#39;m interested in &quot;real REST&quot;, because I&#39;ve heard repeatedly that\n&quot;real REST&quot; isn&#39;t just RPC, and I&#39;d like to use a decent example.\nWhat specific area of REST isn&#39;t really that important to me.\n\nI thought the calculator might be good, because you could design a few\nURL&#39;s that play nicely with a web cache.  I have gotten the impression\nthat this was one measure of RESTfulness.\n\nThanks.\n\n"}}
