A distributed application is as distr=\r\nibuted as it needs be; it&#39;s not restricted to the interactions between a cl=\r\nient and a single server.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even more: the resources state graph =\r\nmay indicate restrictions between states, actions and trigger events. The i=\r\ndea of the client inferring the next step given the actual state of the res=\r\nource, can be also ported to the server! That is, if a client requests an i=\r\nllegal action for the current state (adding a line to a closed order), the =\r\nserver may check first the resource state and send an error back to client.=\r\n But it is clear that the server is not keeping the client state internally=\r\n, it is just responding to the request in that particular moment, thus allo=\r\nwing us to scale nicely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This reminds me of a great piece in Dunc=\r\nan Cragg&#39;s REST Dialogues (http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/ws-are-you-sur=\r\ne-rest-dialogues/), where he says: &quot;You [the client] start by declaring you=\r\nr intention that some state be true, which puts the system in tension - a t=\r\nension that can only be resolved by the application of business logic const=\r\nraints over each player in parallel, until the whole system settles or reso=\r\nlves into a new, consistent state.&quot; That is, the server, on receipt of a re=\r\nquest, checks the resource state and any constraints that only it may be aw=\r\nare of, before bringing the system in line with the request&#39;s declaration o=\r\nf future state.\n&gt; \n&gt; ian\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
