Location independence of services\n2.  Modeling state changes as distinct resources (auditing)\n3.  Simpler code, as messages don&#39;t have to be inspected to derive intent.\n4.

Potentially better mapping to business processes\n\nSuch an approach is not always warranted, but may be more useful than I \nat first imagined.\n\n-- Pete\n\n"}}
