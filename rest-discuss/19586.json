It was built for seri=\r\nalizing representations of resources for the Web archiving domain (Internet=\r\n Archive, etc) but it seems like it might have some relevance for your use =\r\ncase? Basically a WARC is a concatenation of HTTP responses, but you can al=\r\nso layer in the requests that generated them, DNS lookups, etc. Each WARC r=\r\necord has an id, which amounts to a manifest, and you have the ability to l=\r\nayer in arbitrary metadata if necessary.\n\nWARC is ISO 28500:2009 and ISO ma=\r\nke you pay for the spec :-( But implementors generally know you can get the=\r\n latest draft before it went to ISO for free from the Biblioth=E8que nation=\r\nale de France who (along with a lot of other national libraries) also use i=\r\nt for the Web archiving efforts [3]. ArchiveTeam also have a decent list of=\r\n software packages that support WARC [4].\n\nThe ResourceSync effort might al=\r\nso be of interest, in particular their idea of a Resource Dump [5] =97 alth=\r\nough I believe work on ResourceSync is ongoing, and may be in flux. Last ti=\r\nme I looked ResourceSync added some extensions to Google Sitemaps that let =\r\nyou point at a file in a ZIP archive, and list its media type, byte length,=\r\n and hash =85 which sounds a bit like what you might want out of a manifest=\r\n?\n\nI=92d be interested to hear what you come up with, whether you use eithe=\r\nr of these options or not.\n\n//Ed\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARC=\r\nhive\n[2] http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=3D44717\n[3] h=\r\nttp://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf\n[4] http:/=\r\n/www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=3DThe_WARC_Ecosystem\n[5] http://www.op=\r\nenarchives.org/rs/0.9.1/resourcesync#ResourceDump\n\n\nOn Jan 10, 2014, at 5:3=\r\n5 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am =\r\nthinking about a media type for bundling together a bunch of resources[1] i=\r\nnto a single file. With these files I want to store a manifest file.\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nne option would be to just use a zip-based format and an manifest file with=\r\n a well known name.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with this is that useful stream proces=\r\nsing of such a file can only be done by ensuring that the manifest is the f=\r\nirst entry when unzipping. Apparently it requires some stunts to control th=\r\ne ordering of the zip entries and who knows whether the other end uses a co=\r\nmpatible implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Solution would be to unpack to disk first and=\r\n go from there. Not nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; A possible alternative would be to use a mul=\r\ntipart format where I can simply require the manifest to be the first part.=\r\n Then just zip that file or rely on transfer encoding to reduce the bytes o=\r\nn the wire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice things about that:\n&gt; - Ordering is guaranteed\n&gt; - Ful=\r\nl support for per-part MIME headers\n&gt; - Content-Length enables fast splitti=\r\nng of the parts\n&gt; - cid: URIs make for natural, standard URI-references ins=\r\nide the file\n&gt; - stream processing without temporary storage\n&gt; \n&gt; I am inte=\r\nrested in reactions to the two alternatives or any ideas beyond that.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] Well, obviously their entities at some point in time\n&gt; \n&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
