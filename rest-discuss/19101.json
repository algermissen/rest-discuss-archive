These\n&gt; instructions are made available, say, as &quot;text/html&quot; (written\n&gt; description of what to do), &quot;application/pdf&quot; (step-by-step instructions\n&gt; in illustrations) and &quot;application/mp4&quot; (video showing what needs to be\n&gt; done).\n&gt;\n&gt; All the things basically represent the same resource, the same content,\n&gt; in just different representations. There&#39;s two things that make me think:\n&gt;\n&gt; - As far as I understood content negotiation by now, this is sort of a\n&gt; client-driven procedure: Client provides a more or less lengthy weighted\n&gt; Accept: header, server delivers the kind of representation content type\n&gt; that seems to suit the client best, based upon Accept:, language, and of\n&gt; course the kind of stuff the server is capable of providing, after all.\n&gt; While this is neat when making client and server quietly make up whether\n&gt; to transfer and render image/gif or image/png, it seems to fall short in\n&gt; a case as the one outlined before. Here, I would kind of expect a\n&gt; standards based approach allowing for the client to determine which kind\n&gt; of representations a server is capable to provide, to by then know\n&gt; &quot;there&#39;s text, there&#39;s a pdf, and there&#39;s a video clip of the same\n&gt; content, too&quot;. What is the best way of dealing with such a requirement,\n&gt; both in terms of interoperability and in terms of &quot;clean-ness of design&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Right now, I make use of Atom &lt;entry&gt;&#39;s and rel=&quot;alternate&quot; links to\n&gt; keep such things together. Apart from at least _feeling_ a bit strange\n&gt; (now the different &quot;representations&quot; of the same thing are linked as\n&gt; &quot;alternate&quot; from an Atom &lt;entry&gt; which does not represent but just\n&gt; describe that actual resource) I am left with another question: Right\n&gt; now, with this approach, I easily can provide a client system with the\n&gt; information which media type representations are available for that very\n&gt; resource. However this just (obviously) works whenever accessing the\n&gt; &lt;entry&gt; resource first, to by then see a structure like\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table\n&gt;\n&gt; having link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; to\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.mp4\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.pdf\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table/file.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; which works. However, in such a situation, to tell which alternate\n&gt; representations are there, I always will have to access the\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-table\n&gt;\n&gt; resource first, which means that I have to know this one. I so far\n&gt; haven&#39;t figured out an obvious, portable way how to, in example starting\n&gt; out with the &quot;application/pdf&quot; representation, tell that there are\n&gt; alternative media type representations available, as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm. Maybe I am missing something essential / fundamental / trivial\n&gt; about that, or I made a fundamental mistake in thinking about my\n&gt; resource design. Inspirations / thoughts, anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt; TIA and all the best,\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
