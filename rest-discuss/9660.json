Pagaltzis\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 4:13 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Hypermedia-driven app state, \n&gt; bookmarks, and coupling in REST\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was listening to Roy Fielding&#39;s &quot;A little REST and Relaxation&quot;\n&gt; presentation as given at the Jazoon &#39;07 conference:\n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; http://www.parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/A%20little%20REST%20and\n&gt; %20Relaxation\n&gt;     http://jazoon.com/en/conference/day2.html\n&gt; \n&gt; At 21:50, he goes into a point that Mike Schinkel made here a \n&gt; while ago:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Important to REST was the notion of minimizing coupling between \n&gt; &gt; systems. There&#39;s a lot of talk in object-oriented language research \n&gt; &gt; about the importance of minimizing coupling and it&#39;s \n&gt; interesting for \n&gt; &gt; me sometimes because generally what some people do in the language \n&gt; &gt; research in terms of coupling is so much more extensive \n&gt; than the level \n&gt; &gt; of requirements that we had for minimizing coupling. We needed a \n&gt; &gt; system that could be developed independently by 500-1000 different \n&gt; &gt; companies, and each of the things that they added to the \n&gt; web could be \n&gt; &gt; extended and deployed independently without affecting \n&gt; anyone else on \n&gt; &gt; the web, again without actually knowing what those \n&gt; extensions will be. \n&gt; &gt; And the only way you can do that is completely eliminate coupling \n&gt; &gt; between clients and servers. The only coupling that exists in a \n&gt; &gt; REST-based architecture is that the first address that you \n&gt; access has. \n&gt; &gt; ah. basically a bookmark, and you need to keep track of \n&gt; that bookmark. \n&gt; &gt; So essentially the rationale behind the &quot;Cool URIs Don&#39;t Change&quot; is \n&gt; &gt; essentially that&#39;s the last remaining bit of coupling in the \n&gt; &gt; architectures that are based on REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yeah. Decoupling via hypermedia-driven app state does not \n&gt; extend backward past the beginning of a client-server \n&gt; interaction in a way that rather reminds me of how causality \n&gt; within this universe does not extend backward past the big \n&gt; bang pinhole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
