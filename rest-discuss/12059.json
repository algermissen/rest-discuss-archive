What does\n&gt; a particular form of link mean? Ie. what does it imply about the\n&gt; operations you can expect to be able to perform on the target of\n&gt; the link? These are the things that a client has to know in order\n&gt; to operate a REST service.\n&gt;\n&gt; The structure of URIs, in contrast, is a server implementation\n&gt; detail that the client neither need nor should care about.\n\n(I know I&#39;m going to regret asking this, but it&#39;s been bothering me for so\nlong that I have to ask it.)\n\nI think the concept of (promiscuous) bookmarking means that the client\neffectively does care (or at least becomes dependent upon) the structure of\nURIs.\nWhat&#39;s been bothering me for a long time is that I think there is a\nfundamental tension between REST&#39;s concept of &quot;bookmarks as limited set of\nentry points&quot; and the Web&#39;s concept of &quot;URIs for everything&quot;.\n\nWhen I read some of the posts in this list, including those by Roy Fielding\nhimself, I sometimes get the sense that &quot;entry point&quot; URIs should be kept to\na bare minimum in order to minimize the &quot;dependency surface area&quot; between\nclients and servers. For example, Roy made this comment about\nbookmarks&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10740&gt;\n:\n\n&quot;REST is limited to the client being told what to do next by the current\nstate of where they are now, aside from the entry point(s) we call a\nbookmark.&quot;\n\nIn other words, bookmarks are an aside -- only a relative handful of URIs\nshould be &quot;bookmarked&quot; by clients. But isn&#39;t one of the core principles of\nthe Web the idea that any URI should be bookmarkable and that bookmarking is\nto be encouraged? And remember, bookmarking doesn&#39;t just mean putting the\nURI into a list of favorites in a browser. It also means the client\nembedding that URI into a representation that it passes along to some other\nclient. Sometimes the REST talk of URI &quot;entry points&quot; seems like an implicit\nrejection of deep linking &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking&gt;, ie\nforbidding linking to any site page other than a site&#39;s main or home page.\nAnd a rejection of deep linking is fundamentally at odds with the core\nprinciples of the Web.\n\nIf promiscuous bookmarking is indeed encouraged by the Web (and by REST),\nthen a well designed system must assume that any URI that appears in any\nrepresentation it returns could someday be used as an &quot;entry point&quot;. In\nwhich case the system must assume that the world of clients is potentially\ndependent on the entire structure of its initial &quot;network&quot; of  URIs -- not\njust a handful of designated &quot;entry point&quot; URIs. In other words the ratio of\nbookmarked (entry point) URIs to all the URIs returned in representations\nisn&#39;t extremely small, its potentially one-to-one.\n\nTo put it another way, what&#39;s the difference in the degree or nature of the\ndependency, from the server&#39;s POV, between:\n\n   1. The entire set of URIs it has ever returned in representations being\n   bookmarked by clients and then used later as entry points; and\n   2. Clients generating such entry-point URIs via URI templates and a\n   scripting language\n\nConceptually the difference is that (2) can generate novel URIs that were\nnever returned in any representation. For example, a geospatial system could\nhave returned millions of lat/long URIs in various representations over the\nyears, but never returned one with the specific lat/long that a client\nscript generates, eg no one had ever asked about THAT part of the Pacific\nyet.\n\nBut pragmatically there seems to me to be no difference at all. In other\nwords, the idea that one can substantially reduce the dependencies between\nclients and servers by returning a network of URIs in representations\n(HATEOAS) instead of explicitly documenting the URI templates that could\ngenerate them, seems only to work if one prohibits or at least discourages\npromiscuous bookmarking of URIs, ie prohibits deep linking by REST clients.\n\nThis is why I think the structure of URIs IS important and the use of URI\ntemplates is NOT suspect. Do others see this as a tension as well, or I am\njust misunderstanding something?\n\r\n--00221504700f3672dd0461f15273\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Feb 2, 2009 at 8:42 AM, Aristotle Pagaltzis &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:p=\r\nagaltzis@...&quot;&gt;pagaltzis@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; If anything is imp=\r\nortant in that sense, then it&#39;s the design of&lt;br&gt;&gt; your resource represe=\r\nntations: where do hyperlinks go?
