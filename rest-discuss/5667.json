Does anyone know about  \nadditional (earlier) mentionings of this concept besides the  \nfollowing ones?\n\nHTTP specifies the Expect header:\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.20\n\nMark used intent in the former version of RDFForms:\nhttp://markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/rdf-forms-old1.html\nThere he mentions SOAP 1.1&#39;s SOAPAction and SOAP 1.2&#39;s action  \nattribute as being a means to communicate an intent between client  \nand server.\n\nMark has also written &quot;Unraveling the Mystery of SOAPAction&quot;:\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2331?wlg=yes\nThis essay contains the Panel example with the use of an explicit  \ncast to communicate intent beyond the generic add() method (makes me  \nwonder of the concept of intent originates from the OO paradigma or  \neven from the basic idea of type casting)\n\nThat is all I know has been written about &#39;intent&#39; in the broadest  \nsense. Any additional pointers would be apprecieated.\n\nAside:\nIn this same essay Mark mentions that SOAPAction/action-feature  \nactually does not behave as he describes (Mark, correct me if I am  \nmisrepresenting you). Looking at the SOAP specs I found that it  \nrefers to routing as one possible use and I wonder if that is so  \ndifferent from what one would actually use &#39;intent&#39; for?\n\nI think a distinction must be made between receivers that hold state  \nthat is changed by the data submission (receivers the identity of  \nwhich is important) and receivers that just perform a certain kind of  \nprocessing. I have allways thought of intent as being primarily  \nuseful when communicating with the latter ones since intent would  \nallow (a) receiver discovery by type (intent) and (b) distribution of  \nrequests across any receiver of the same type (e.g. for load  \nbalancing). If I for example want to send an email, I do not really  \ncare which SMTP server actually sends it.\n\nSo, maybe the notion of routing (based on intent) is not so different  \nafter all?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n_______________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer                         \nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;   \nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
