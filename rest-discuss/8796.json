Oh, the irony. The reason there&#39;s no REST support in WCF is\nprecisely because of the effort invested in classic WCF instead, a lot\nof which isnt even mainstream interoperable WS-* over HTTP. Just think\nhow different things would be if they had chosen a different path.\n\nThe talk has a bit of a firefighting feel to it, an unexpected change\nof direction. However, if there is one thing that MS has excelled in\nin the past, it is in changing direction successfully.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
