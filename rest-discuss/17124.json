But first, let me clarify =\r\nI&#39;m not in favor of WSDL as a hard believer it will make the world happier,=\r\n or that it is the only way to work on REST. It is just that, without a con=\r\ntext, running away from it with no reason is such non-sense that makes me w=\r\nonder, and I end up like a defender of the lost cause.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now. Let&#39;s see:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; =A0Well, any arch discussion will have a context. In the conte=\r\nxt of the REST arch model, I find the WSDL pattern (WSDL, WADL, GData Pytho=\r\nn API, etc.) to be inappropriate. I&#39;ve already mentioned a handful of reaso=\r\nns. Possibly one I did not emphasize is the lack of hypermedia in this exte=\r\nrnal definition pattern.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting POV. I would n=\r\not to see WSDL as a pattern, linked to external additional things. Just thi=\r\nnk of it as a document format for a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; While WSDL can do =\r\na good job of expressing the request and response details, I&#39;ve yet to see =\r\nWSDL do a good job expressing the state transition details. IOW, which step=\r\ns are first, second, third, etc. These &quot;steps&quot;, in my experience almost alw=\r\nays depend on the state of things at the moment and are not at all easy to =\r\nproperly express in a static document.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Totally agree with you=\r\n. I would not recommend either trying to define the complete state machine =\r\nin one doc, unless you have particular need to have instances of a state ma=\r\nchine that may run longer and in parallel with other instances (versioning)=\r\n. And that is beyond REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; For REST, all the transitions may be based o=\r\nn the actual state. I would not use WSDL for a one place description of tho=\r\nse transitions, and it is not made for that. It is made for defining the do=\r\ncument formats, bindings and message delivery patterns.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess what ge=\r\nts confused here with REST transitions is the message pattern idea. Those p=\r\natterns may go beyond the REST style, as they were not designed for that. A=\r\nctually, the messages are one way, delivery, while a REST interaction in HT=\r\nTP implementation requires a request and a response.\n&gt;\n&gt; And you are right,=\r\n the articles I posted are just an example of how WSDL is thought to be com=\r\npatible with REST, but following that philosophy of enclosing all the inter=\r\nactions. That, let&#39;s say, is a pattern (or antipattern, so to speak).\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nsnip&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been toying with pulling more and more details on these transi=\r\ntions out of client code and into the message. I&#39;ve even been experimenting=\r\n with putting some of the state transition detail in _external_ documents, =\r\nbut have yet to find the WSDL pattern helpful for that work.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; Ye=\r\ns, actually I cheer the state transition info IN the message. Not in the co=\r\nde nor in external docs. If the WSDL is part of it, then the WSDL should be=\r\n THE message, not an external doc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Last point on WSDL and REST: WSDL is=\r\n not the whole, but a document you may get in one get operation, that shoul=\r\nd tell you the format of the document you need to send next, the URI, and a=\r\nny expected response, if any, once you get the response, that one should dr=\r\nive you to the next one and so on. Just like an XFORM, but yes, awfully ver=\r\nbose.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, about what architectural style may WSDL be suitable? Well so=\r\nme SOA of course. WSDL was meant to be a web services implementation defini=\r\ntion, describing the messages in XML format, the message exchange pattern a=\r\nnd the underlying protocol binding. If you have a system not totally built =\r\non top of HTTP, with complex exchange patterns and a mix of data and proces=\r\nsing intensive operations, then WSDL may (MAY) help you with little bits of=\r\n automation for client construction. WSDL was not built for REST, and surel=\r\ny REST was not defined for the system I describe, although one or two of th=\r\ne nodes are on the web. Still, WSDL is not magical and may not fit all impl=\r\nementations, may work for integrated application, not necessarily for distr=\r\nibuted ones.\n&gt;\n&gt; But describing about the essential SOA constrains and prop=\r\nerties may take longer in this comment.\n&gt;\n&gt; And, I hope you now know that I=\r\n&#39;m not totally comfortable with the idea of REST being the natural SOA solu=\r\ntion. It isn&#39;t, and maybe that is a discussion we need to start in another =\r\nthread.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW even Wooden seems=\r\n abandoned, so that is why you see almost no practical work on this. Frank =\r\nCohen, when I told him WSDL 2.0 was official, smiled back and said: &quot;Who ca=\r\nres?&quot;. =A0Oh, well.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yaho=\r\no!
