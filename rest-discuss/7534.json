I&#39;ve got many printed pages from list discussions and\nweb articles on the subject. But I wanted to get people&#39;s direct opinions\nbecause it is easier to get direct responses than to ferret out opinions\nbased from context when the discussion was on other topics.\n\n&gt; If you could put what you find on the RESTwiki (the FAQ \n&gt; page  in particular), it would be appreciated.\n\nI ultimately plan to blog about it, but could also reference it on the\nRESTwiki.\n\nHowever, the reason I was asking was because I was trying to gather evidence\nto present to Ian Hickson to support adding URI Template support to the\naction method of the form element in Web Forms 2.0.  I sent an email to\nuri@... to that effect[1], but got to response.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2006Dec/0028.html\n\n\n\n"}}
