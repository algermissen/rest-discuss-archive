Goddd)\n\nhttp://www.pacificspirit.com/Authoring/wsdl/ArtistWSDL2uriformencoding.html\n\nSomebody might bookmark that. Or even post that to the Wiki. Anyway it&#39;s\nby the world renowned Dave Orchard.\n\nIt highlights the fact that EVEN WSDL 2.0 wasn&#39;t expressive enough to\nhandle simplest REST-ish semantics such as URI, path info, and query\nstrings. And that&#39;s also my concern when trying to use WSDL 2.0 as the\ndescription/interface language for REST/SHARE-ish service.\n\nI hope this is already fixed in the last call for WSDL or at least the\nupcoming WSDL 2.0 spec.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
