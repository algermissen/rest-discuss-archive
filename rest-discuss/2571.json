It requires less client-side knowledge to \n&gt; navigate a hyperlink.\n\nThat would have been my first choice, but there seem to be\ninfinitely many of them, as in your description before of resources\nso large they can only be addressed reasonably through search\nparameters.  I think this is the same, because &#39;as of&#39; is\nnot constrained to any particular time segment or time granularity\n(even though I indicated business-day granularity before).\n\nMaybe I don&#39;t understand what you mean by &quot;consider using a\nhyperlink instead.&quot;\n\n&gt; Common wisdom (Jeff Bone would say &quot;dogma&quot;) in the Web architecture \n&gt; world is that the client should not construct the URI for latter from \n&gt; the former. Basically if you tell the client to do that, then you are \n&gt; committing to that exact naming scheme forever.\n\nWhat if the client is following a set of (dynamic) instructions\nfrom the server on how to construct such a URL?  If the naming\nscheme changes, then so does the instructions.\n\n\n&gt; For instance someone \n&gt; could make a hyperlink today to a document that will come \n&gt; into existence \n&gt; in 2003. On the other hand, if you put in a level of \n&gt; indirection between \n&gt; the resources then the client is told that you reserve the right to \n&gt; change your naming convention any time. Here&#39;s how you do that:\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; GET /Portfolio?asof=20020916\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020916&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020916&quot;/&gt;\n\nOkay, I get the indirection bit, but along the way I wondered\nhow the client knew how to do that GET.  Did I tell her how to\nformat that?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Then client applications dereference through that query to get at the \n&gt; concrete resource associated with a particular date. The \n&gt; query language \n&gt; could be arbitrarily complex. As in:\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; GET /Portfolio?from=20020913;to=20020918\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; &lt;resources&gt;\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020913&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020913&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020914&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020914&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020914&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020915&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;resource asof=&quot;20020914&quot; href=&quot;/Portfolio/20020916&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/resources&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Admittedly the indirection has costs. But essentially your \n&gt; &quot;contract&quot; is \n&gt; now only to maintain the indirection service, not to keep the \n&gt; same URI \n&gt; naming scheme forever. Your successor might appreciate the \n&gt; freedom. The \n&gt; same might go for anyone implementing duplicates of your service \n&gt; elsewhere in the world. Maybe they want to serve portfolio snapshots \n&gt; through ftp: or from a seperate server @....\n\nHmmm.  I think you&#39;re still assuming that there is a finite\nnumber of these resources and that given the right question,\nthe server can dish up a finite set of references for getting\nat them.  Time ain&#39;t like that.\n\nWhile asking the original question, I realized that a better\napplication design on the server side keeps a versioning history\nand so could offer a list of versions as you have above. \nUnfortunately, the legacy app hiding behind my web service\nwasn&#39;t that smart. 8-(\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
