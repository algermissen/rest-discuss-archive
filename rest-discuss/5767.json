In other words, I don&#39;t believe\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in doing content negotiation on the Accept-Language header (for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; usability reasons).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t *think* that&#39;s what Claude said. Having a separate URI and NOT\n&gt;&gt; doing content neg is not the same thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I may have misinterpreted what Claude was saying, but I think you  \n&gt; understood what I was saying. What do you mean by, &quot;Having a separate  \n&gt; URI and NOT doing content neg is not the same thing.&quot;?\n\nJust because there IS a separate URI for a resource doesn&#39;t mean you\ncan&#39;t still do content-neg with a different URI; eg:\n\n  http://www.example.com/somepage\n   has i18n representations:\n     fr\n     en\n   which are represented by different resources:\n\n    http://www.example.com/somepage.fr.html\n    http://www.example.com/somepage.en.html\n\nthe content neg request can indicate the location of the real resource\nwith the Location header.\n\n\n&gt; I know my philosophy goes against the approach that seems recommended  \n&gt; by the HTTP spec by its examples of content negotiation being done on  \n&gt; Accept-Language. From a usability perspective, however, I believe  \n&gt; taking that approach in my particular design case inappropriate.  \n&gt; We&#39;re creating a network of sites, and each site will have one and  \n&gt; only one locale. So if there&#39;s a English article on site A, the  \n&gt; French translation of it, if any, would be on site B. Since each one  \n&gt; of these sites will be mono-lingual, it doesn&#39;t make sense to do  \n&gt; content negotiation on Accept-Language. Nevertheless, I will know if  \n&gt; there&#39;s a French translation, and if they mention they prefer French  \n&gt; over English in the Accept-Language header, I&#39;d like to be nice and  \n&gt; mention to them that there&#39;s a French version of this article over at  \n&gt; this URI at site B. I may decide to do that if I notice that the  \n&gt; request is coming from an IP address in France, if that&#39;s something  \n&gt; users find useful.\n\nOk. What I find hard is the dynamic bit... why not just put the\nlanguage links directly into the page statically? Client side could\nhelp pull that out as well in terms of UI I guess (not sure if script\ncan see the i18n prefs).\n\n\n&gt; I think I am supporting the standard. In my case there isn&#39;t a French  \n&gt; representation of the English article at that URI. By requesting that  \n&gt; URI you are asking for an article in English, and I&#39;ll send you one.\n&gt;\n&gt; I definitely want to have lots of different languages being spoken in  \n&gt; our network, but as I said, each site will be for users&#39; who can  \n&gt; interact in a particular language.\n\nWhy not follow what the specs want you to do and make one site but\nmulti-lingual? Is there a business reason for having different sites?\nOr are they really the same site?\n\nI am really interested in this.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Would this be the RESTful way to think about personalization of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resources based on content negotiation?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think so. I think that you&#39;re methods won&#39;t be idempotent and\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s anti-REST.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t the methods be idempotent?\n\nBecause the results of the requests would be different depending on\nwho you are. If I get the resource with my lang preference set one way\nthen I&#39;ll get one thing, but if I get it another way I&#39;ll get another\nthing.\n\nAnother thing: authentication methods are supposed to be flexible with\nHTTP but you&#39;re going to tie the system to one form of authentication\n(one where the username is transmitted to you). I&#39;m not sure if this\nis against REST per se... but it would not be best practice.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; However, I will admit I have a hard time undestanding how\n&gt;&gt; personalization can fit into REST. Client side script seems to be the\n&gt;&gt; best solution.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard. The reason I brought this up is I can&#39;t  \n&gt; personally see much difference between customizing a resource for  \n&gt; user&#39;s preferred language (via Accept-Language content negotiation)  \n&gt; and customizing it by mentioning their first name in a Welcome  \n&gt; message. Why would one be a blessed-by-the-spec representation of the  \n&gt; resource and the other be blatant disrespect of the spirit of HTTP  \n&gt; and REST? One reason I can imagine this might be the case is that  \n&gt; these kinds of customization are not intended by (or mentioned by)  \n&gt; the HTTP designers.\n\nBecause one works for everybody with the header set that way and the\nother works for only one person.\n\nServer side storage of state outside the framework of resources is bad\naccording to Roy. Most of us here believe he&#39;s right.\n\n\n&gt; What I&#39;d like to do over HTTP, though, is give the user the best  \n&gt; experience by looking at whatever information comes in with a request  \n&gt; (IP address, cookies, Accept-Language, referrer, whatever) and  \n&gt; provide the most useful representation of the requested resource.\n&gt; If I give a unique ETag to each variant, then I think caching should  \n&gt; work, and conceptually to me it just feels like each of these are  \n&gt; personalized representations of a resource. What would doing this  \n&gt; break? What would be the downside?\n\nCaching will work in as much as there will be almost no\ncaching. Intermediaries won&#39;t be able to cache your pages because\nevery single one (or nearlly every single one) will be unique.\n\n\nClearly, scalability and personalization are a trade off. You should\nconsider client side personalization though... it&#39;s really quite\npowerfull these days.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
