E.g.\nBuyer posts offer to buy with link for seller to post acceptance or\nrejection, receives acknowledgement.\nSeller posts partial acceptance (one item available, another not) with\nlink for buyer to advise on whether to continue or not.\nEtc.\n\nBoth agents are both clients and servers.  As servers, don&#39;t they want\nto be stateless?\nSo maybe it&#39;s not a loop but a step at a time.\n\n"}}
