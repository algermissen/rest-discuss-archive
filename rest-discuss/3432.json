For starters, I\n&gt; intend to support the following specs:\n&gt;\n&gt; RSS 0.92\n&gt; RSS 2.0\n&gt;\n&gt; However, how would I RESTfully determine which version to return to a given\n&gt; request?  Getting a request Accept: header value of &quot;text/xml&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;application/rss+xml&quot; wouldn&#39;t necessarily do any good (would it?).  As a\n&gt; result, I have implemented a query parameter called &quot;rss&quot; which can have the\n&gt; values of &quot;0.92&quot; or &quot;2.0&quot;.  However, I have seen some other blog systems\n&gt; (most notably Sam Ruby&#39;s [1]) that use pseudo-extensions (&quot;.rss&quot;, &quot;.rss2&quot;)\n&gt; to acheive the same goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, either way you look at it, a given resource could have three URIs.  Each\n&gt; URI returns a slightly different representation of the resource (e.g.\n&gt; additional data in RSS 2.0 that&#39;s not in RSS 0.92, etc.).  To some extent, I\n&gt; think this is okay, RESTfully speaking.  However, this brings into question\n&gt; the need for content negotiation.\n&gt;\n&gt; When should one technique be used above another?  When conneg is not an\n&gt; option, what is the best technique to use, and is that technique nothing but\n&gt; a kludge?\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.intertwingly.net/rss/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
