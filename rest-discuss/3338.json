For example if I remember correctly\n&gt; HTML forms can only submit POST and GET requests,\n\ncorrect.\n\n&gt; so if the system is\n&gt; set up to use PUT and DELETE do I have to put in a intermediary to do\n&gt; the translation or is there a JavaScript trick that I haven&#39;t seen yet?\n\nyes.  i believe xforms will allow you to send put/delete, paul prescod \nmentioned this a while back.\n\nwith html forms, you can use both approaches.\n\nwith javascript on the client, you can use an XmlHttpRequest object (at \nleast i think thats what its called; *weird* name, why not just \n&#39;HttpRequest&#39;?) to send a PUT or DELETE.\n\nbecause i prefer to avoid client scripting, i prefer to use an \nintermediary on the server which &#39;pre-processes&#39; the request body.  \napproaches i have used include sending the put/delete flag in a hidden \nform field, or using the value of a submit form field.  (i didn&#39;t \nwidely test browser behaviour with submit field values.)  this then \nforms the basis of an ifThenElse/switch structure which you can use to \ncall either PUT or DELETE code.\n\nHTH,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
