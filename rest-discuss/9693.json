Much of the research I have read on the\n&gt; Semantic Web is about extending the standard SOAP WS-* stack. This\n&gt; includes WSMO and OWL-S amongst others.\n&gt;\n&gt; My opinion is that one could create the Semantic Web with RESTful Web\n&gt; Services by just adding semantic annotations to existing Web pages.\n&gt; This is an oversimplification I know, but I can&#39;t help feeling\n&gt; frustrated about all the effort that are spent on OWL-S and WSMO etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Initiatives such as OWL-S and WSMO has got to be dead ends, I cannot\n&gt; imagine how anyone would create a service for accessing even 20% of\n&gt; the information being available on the Web today. Adding some semantic\n&gt; tags to regular Web pages however, that one can cope with.\n&gt;\n&gt; RDF is after all, called Resource Description Framework, not\n&gt; Complicated Web Service Description Framework ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you agree?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-73-87082376\r\nContent-Type: application/pkcs7-signature;\n\tname=smime.p7s\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=smime.p7s\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-73-87082376--\r\n\n"}}
