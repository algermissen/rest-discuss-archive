However, there are a lot of privacy  \n&gt; concerns with transmitting SSNs in plain text.  How would I be able  \n&gt; to design a REST service when my primary identifier is information  \n&gt; that I don&#39;t want to be part of the GET URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; I was envisioning the service to have something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; https://example.com/Customer/444556666\nSince URIs are completely opaque to the consuming services, you can  \nequally well use arbitrary IDs in your URIs and do a server side  \nmappingto SSNs.\n&gt; (Where 444-55-6666 is the customer&#39;s SSN)\n&gt;\n&gt; I see some alternatives:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Don&#39;t use SSN as a primary identifier.  Easier said than done.   \n&gt; The industry is moving this way, but it may be many years (if ever)  \n&gt; before they are not used at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Use Post for queries also because then the SSN would be  \n&gt; encrypted with the SSL request.  This isn&#39;t very consistent with  \n&gt; the REST patterns.\n&gt; 3) Walk the service tree.  Have requests start at https:// \n&gt; example.com/Customers and then return the list of URLs with the  \n&gt; address to get the specific customer information.  However this  \n&gt; doesn&#39;t scale.  We currently have over 50 million customers.   \n&gt; Searching on common name doesn&#39;t work either because it isn&#39;t even  \n&gt; close to unique.\nIf I understand you correctly, you intend to have the client actually  \nconstruct the URLs based on SSN knowledge? That is not good REST  \npractice anyhow (URI would not be treated as being opaque).\nCan you say more about the intended interaction between client and  \nserver?\n\nIf the intent is a query, then maybe POST is really the way to go in  \nyour case.\n\nJan\n&gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
