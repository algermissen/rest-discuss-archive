For example, when\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m publishing something on the web with a web framework like\n&gt;&gt; RubyOnRails or whatever, I have a model of something, say a User, and\n&gt;&gt; a URL route like /user/:id, and some controller code that goes and\n&gt;&gt; fetches that model instance and delivers up some HTML for the user\n&gt;&gt; using a template. Every time I do something like this it just isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; feasible for me to think, hmmm is this URL identifying a real world\n&gt;&gt; object? Is the database record for the User an Information Resource?\n&gt;&gt; Or is my database record about a Real World Thing or a Document?\n&gt;&gt; Should I really have two URL paths here, one for the Document about\n&gt;&gt; the User and one for the User themself? Should I use a # in that URI,\n&gt;&gt; or use the 303 redirect to indicate it is the Real World Object?\n&gt;\n&gt; I know exactly what you mean! In the applications and web services I&#39;ve\n&gt; been involved in recently, I haven&#39;t ever needed to stop and ask the $64m\n&gt; metaphysical question, &quot;is this an information resource or not?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; All you end up caring about is, can my user or client get the data they need,\n&gt; and can they follow their nose from there to do whatever they need to do next\n&gt; (get more data/modify some data/process some data/...)?\n&gt;\n&gt; One reason why I&#39;ve liked using content-based extensions to Atom recently\n&gt; is that it gives you a fairly intuitive convention for separating metadata\n&gt; from data. E.g., when you GET /person/123 you receive...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;published&gt;2010-10-14T18:29:48+01:00&lt;/published&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;updated&gt;2010-10-15T19:39:01+01:00&lt;/updated&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;link rel=&quot;edit&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;author&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;email&gt;jane.bloggs@...&lt;/email&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;/author&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;content type=&quot;application/x.exampleapp+xml&quot;&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;user xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;givenname&gt;Jane&lt;/givenname&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;familyname&gt;Bloggs&lt;/familyname&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;!-- etc. --&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;/user&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;/content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/entry&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ...and it&#39;s fairly intuitive that things like published, updated and author\n&gt; in the &quot;head&quot; of the representation are *about* the data, and things like\n&gt; givenname, familyname, etc., *are* the data (in the same way that it&#39;s\n&gt; intuitive that stuff in the&lt;head&gt;  of an HTML representation is *about*\n&gt; the content, and stuff in the&lt;body&gt;  element *is* the content to be rendered).\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, say your clients want to be able to navigate to relatives of Jane. You\n&gt; might do something like...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;link rel=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/rel/mother&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;link rel=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/rel/father&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/789&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt; &lt;/entry&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ...or you might do...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;entry xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;id&gt;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/123&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;title&gt;Jane Bloggs&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;content type=&quot;application/x.exampleapp+xml&quot;&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;user xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;              ...\n&gt;              &lt;mother href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;father href=&quot;http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/789&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;              ...\n&gt;          &lt;/user&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;/content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/entry&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ...and it&#39;s an interesting side question which is better, but the point is\n&gt; that from a hypermedia constraint point of view it doesn&#39;t really matter\n&gt; I don&#39;t think, because either way clients will have what they need to be\n&gt; able to make appropriate state transitions, and it certainly doesn&#39;t matter\n&gt; whether http://example.org/fooapp/service/person/456 identifies an information\n&gt; resource or not. In fact, if you then told me I had to do 303s from that URL\n&gt; to some other, as a web service engineer I&#39;d get frustrated, because that\n&gt; would start introducing extra round trips which would slow everything down.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I totally sympathise with people who say &quot;don&#39;t conflate\n&gt; yourself with your homepage&quot;, but I guess I&#39;m saying that I can see how a\n&gt; linked data engineer and a restful web service engineer would both look at\n&gt; each other&#39;s systems and go, &quot;you did what?&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s exactly, what I also got, get and will get in mind all the time. \nOn the one side, services that don&#39;t use the common, layered Semantic \nWeb technology stack get it to work without the extra round trips. On \nthe other side, they are also able to express nearly the same content.\nI can imagine, that I can model the example from above also with \nSemantic Web ontologies, so everything is RDF Model based (I can write \nyou that example, if you like). I also wouldn&#39;t have a problem with \nserving a representation of a description of a resource, because I treat \ninformation resources as an abstract description (cf. [1]).\nThe representation, that would be delivered to the client, contains this \ninformation resource then in a realized form, i.e. a semantic graph in \nRDF Model which is serialized as RDFa. Furthermore, I can also clearly \nseparate between data that describes the requested resource (via the \nresource URI) and data that describes the concrete representation (via \nthe RDFa document URI), and if I want also data that describes the \nconcrete description (via the RDF Model realization URI).\nThe &quot;only&quot; we maybe should accept, as might already do, is a kind of \nloose coupling between the resource one requests and the response \n(representation) one gets delivered. I feel more comfortable with &quot;200 \nOK ... GET an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in \nthe response; &quot; (as defined in [2]) as with &quot;200 OK ... GET a \nrepresentation of the target resource is sent in the response;&quot; (as \ndefined in [3]), where the &#39;target resource&#39; must unchangeable \nidentified by the given resource URI (see [4], whereby for other methods \nthe Content-Location header can used and loose coupling is accepted; cf. \nalso the related discussion about that topic [5]).\nSo, I can only reply myself in saying that a client more or less want \nonly something processable when requesting a resource URI. In addition, \nI had the feeling that Roy T. Fielding neglected the &#39;description part&#39; \na bit, when formulating the REST principles. However, the &#39;description \npart&#39; is omnipresent.\nFor example, I can map a concrete natural language text description to a \nconcrete hypertext representation e.g., HTML. The concrete hypertext \nrepresentation contains then the concrete natural language text \ndescription. In addition to that, I can map a concrete natural language \ntext description to a concrete formal semantic graph description. Both \nconcrete descriptions have then in common an abstract description (which \nI would name &#39;information resource&#39;, cf. [1]), which can have multiple \nconcrete realizations.\n\nAll in all, there&#39;s not much difference between the goals, or?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n\n[1] \nhttp://infoserviceonto.smiy.org/2010/11/25/on-resources-information-resources-and-documents/\n[2] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.1\n[3] \nhttp://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-12.html#status.200\n[4] http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-12#section-6\n[5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2011Jan/0002.html\n\n"}}
