But that&#39;s another\nmatter.  Jill&#39;s PDA has a USB port, so she excuses herself, goes\nto the ladies room and patches into the HP InkJet printer they\nkeep in there* (this Restaurant is not even in Zagats!), prints\nthe URL on her choice of paper (there are at least 4 trays!),\ncomes out and hands the paper to John, who is so impressed he\nswallows his olive down the wrong pipe.  Jill can&#39;t remember the\nHeimlich Manouver, but no worries, the URL to that is also filed\nsomewhere on her PDA...\n\n* This is all done via a complex setup involving an SMC Barricade\nfirewall router -- you don&#39;t need to know the wiring details, do you?\n\nMeanwhile, at a table in the corner all by himself sits Jeff, who\nappears to have lost his napkin, of all things.\n\n(heh)\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jeff Bone [mailto:jbone@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 25, 2002 4:12 PM\n&gt; To: Mathews, Walden\n&gt; Cc: John Fletcher; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Retraction, advice sought, code offered\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wednesday, September 25, 2002, at 02:55  PM, Mathews, Walden wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I object to your desire for URI readability; it implies that you\n&gt; &gt; are planning to do something unsafe, like use a URI as though it\n&gt; &gt; was a function call with parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; See ---  THIS is exactly why I rant about URI opacity.
