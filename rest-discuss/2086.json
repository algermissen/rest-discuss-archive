Another great article, Paul!\n\nYour ideas on this extended topic have been very stimulating to me.\nI&#39;ve been fumbling in the same direction ever since ebXML, where I \nwas pretty heavily involved in ebXML-BPSS, one of the bad examples in \nyour article.  I take no offense, it was a learning experience for \nme, and I learned a lot.\n\nI continue to like the RosettaNet-UNCEFACT-ebXML &quot;state alignment&quot; \ntransaction model, which we&#39;ve explored some on this list, and think \nit can both be RESTful and have the unit-of-work transaction property.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the choreography or orchestration in ebXML \nBPSS - the stuff that orchestrates between the transactions - I get \nmore skeptical every day.\n\nIn fact, there were several factions in the ebXML Business Process \nproject, which produced ebXML-BPSS among other things.  One faction \nwent over to UNCEFACT-eBTWG and is working out a better way to \norchestrate conversations focused on states of business objects.\n\nI think that if you take the gist of that &quot;better way&quot; and translate \nthe business objects into REST resources, you will get something that \nis very close to where your train of thought is going.  (We&#39;ll see \nsoon enough if I&#39;m right.)\n\nOne aspect of the eBTWG work is a business ontology based on Bill \nMcCarthy&#39;s REA (Resource-Event-Agent) model (with which Mark is \nfamiliar, since we used to kick it around in the dist-obj list).\n\nI think the REA ontology is the semantic basis for the declarative \nlanguage you are looking for.\n\nFor example, the REA model for a business exchange (or even barter) \nis Give and Take, where I Give you some economic resources and Take \nfrom you some other economic resources in exchange.  (E.g. usually \nproducts or services in exchange for money, but it wouldn&#39;t have to \nbe money.)\n\nIn REA, Give and Take are economic events.\n\nIn business, economic events are usually preceded by Commitments, \nwhich are promises to perform economic events in the future.\n\n(An Order is a collection of Commitments.)\n\nSo if the Commitment exists, you can post the Give and Take economic \nevents to it.  If the Give event is supposed to appear first, then \nthe Take event could be posted to it.\n\nThey&#39;re all speech acts that refer to previous speech acts.\nIf the referent doesn&#39;t exist, you can&#39;t refer to it.\n\nAgain, little or no choreography required.  \n\nBut the rules should also be REST resources.\n\nAm I following your train of thought?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\nReferences, almost all more verbose than you want:\n\nREA Ontology source page:\nhttp://www.msu.edu/user/mccarth4/rea-ontology/index.htm\n\nUNCEFACT-eBTWG Business Entity Type project draft paper:\nhttp://www.collaborativedomain.com/standards/documents/BET%20Draft%\n20Technical%20Specification_v012.zip\n(watch out for word wrap)\n\nRDF version of all this stuff due in fall.\n\n\n\n"}}
