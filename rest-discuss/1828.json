It&#39;s interesting that it&#39;s also \nin the bag of socket-level modifications.  HTTP is exactly what it always \nwas, but there are extensions happening underneath it in the transport \nlayer.\n\n(Aside to Mark: I think that Allan&#39;s comment is not about a set of\nrequest/response pairs, but a single pair where the reply is sent in a\ntime frame _completely_ different from the browser timeframe.\n\nAside to Allan: correct me if I&#39;m putting words in your mouth.)\n\n\n\n"}}
