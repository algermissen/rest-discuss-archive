Essentially, you are appending items to a list of read pages\naren&#39;t you?=\r\n Seems very POSTy to me.\n\nThe rule of thumb should be to use the method wit=\r\nh the strongest\nsemantics that fits what you are doing. But at the same tim=\r\ne, I don&#39;t\nthink there&#39;s a lot of real benefit from driving yourself crazy =\r\nto\nreplace POST with PUT/DELETE. The penalty for using semantics that are\nt=\r\noo strong (e.g. using a GET for an unsafe operation) are really bad.\nThe pe=\r\nnalty for using weaker semantics are that you might lose out on\nallowing in=\r\ntermediaries to optimize or do other handy things with your\nrequest (e.g. c=\r\nache the result or re-apply a request for reliability\nreasons).\n\nUsing a PO=\r\nST has weak semantics but shouldn&#39;t be considered a bad\npractice IMO.\n\n\n"}}
