In this case=\r\n I should probably use\n&gt; the sare URL for both cases, and specify a differe=\r\nnt Accept header.\n&gt; In the latter scenario though, I wouldn&#39;t be able to ea=\r\nsily build an\n&gt; html page showing thumbnails, because html &lt;img&gt; tag simply=\r\n doesn&#39;t\n&gt; allow to specify request headers in the &quot;src&quot; attribute, but sim=\r\nply a\n&gt; url.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I just answered myself, but I was wondering if anybo=\r\ndy had an\n&gt; opinion (or better yet, experience) on this matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n=\r\n&gt; Stefano\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
