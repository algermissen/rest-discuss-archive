Example: a blog entry with a list of comments\nand an &#39;add comment&#39; form at the bottom.\n\n2 Multiple resources\nA representation may display both that resource and a link to a second\nresource used for editing or appending to the first resource. Example: a\nblog entry with a list of comments and an &#39;add comment&#39; link at the bottom.\nThis is an example of &#39;hypertext as the engine of application state&#39;\n(hateoas)\n\n3 Other resources\nYou could also have a third resource with references to both the &#39;data&#39;\nresource and the &#39;editing&#39; resource. The &#39;data&#39; could be included in the\nclient (like an image) or included on the server (some sort of\nserver-side-include).\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Scott Chapman\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 05, 2006 9:58 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] How to GET a &lt;form&gt; for editing in \n&gt; RESTful design?\n&gt; \n&gt; If hitting a URL with GET is supposed to give you a view of \n&gt; the resource and it&#39;s not a form by default, then how to do \n&gt; you get a &lt;form...&gt; view of it for editing?\n&gt; \n&gt; The same applies to getting a blank form for creating a new resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; How are people handling these situations in their RESTful designs?\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
