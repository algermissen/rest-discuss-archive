If I was creating a \nservice that mixed banking and farming then I am quite sure my consumers \nwould want to know when they received a representation of a bank account \nversus a tractor.\n\nBut maybe this is what content negotiation would be good for? If I pointed \nmy browser at the resource I would get xhtml - if I pointed my farmbank \nclient at it I would get application/farmbank+xml.\n\nBut now we are missing the documentation for the application/farmbank+xml \nmedia type which must be shipped as a separate PDF. That kind of nullifies \nthe benefits of automatic documentation we got from the xhtml API.\n\nNow we could add a standard XSL transformation from application/farmbank+xml \nto xhtml:\n- If application/farmbank+xml used atom:link then these could be converted \nto &lt;a&gt;-elements.\n- All unknown XML elements could be converted to &lt;div class=&quot;X&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\n- XForm elements could be served as-is assuming the browser could handle \nthem. A reason for using XForm can be found here: \nhttp://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/\n- And so on ...\n\nIn this way we can help the API consumers a lot, with little effort, by \ndocumenting our XML API using automatically generated xhtml. That way we get \nthe best of both worlds ... or what?\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;J�rn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Scott Banwart&quot; &lt;sbanwart@...&gt;; &quot;Mike Kelly&quot; &lt;mike@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Rest Discussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, December 03, 2010 10:14 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Link relations [was: A media type for case \nfiles, dossiers and documents]\n\n\n&gt; Everytime I read these posts I always end up feeling like I get it ...\n&gt; almost. You know; it&#39;s that feeling of &quot;almost, but not quite entirely\n&gt; unlike tea&quot; - you understand the words, but don&#39;t really get the complete\n&gt; meaning.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway ... talking about representing resources in xhtml - here is one \n&gt; point\n&gt; I find very interesting:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really see how an autonomous client\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can be built without some sort of out-of-band knowledge of those\n&gt;&gt;&gt; semantics.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Am I missing something?\n&gt;&gt; no\n&gt;\n&gt; I absolutely agree with this - the client must be told how to understand \n&gt; the\n&gt; semantics. This is what programmers are for - we read documentation and\n&gt; write code (among other things). But who says documentation only exists in \n&gt; a\n&gt; separate PDF-document? Why not put it right there in the API using xhtml?\n&gt; Someone mentioned &quot;browsing the API&quot; in a previous mail. That&#39;s a concept \n&gt; I\n&gt; find truely interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the API *is* the documention then it might be that the total time spent\n&gt; on writing the API plus the documentation is less than the extra time we\n&gt; spend on writing a slightly different style of API - namely an xhtml API\n&gt; instead of a application/vnd.xxx+xml API. With an xhtml API we just mail \n&gt; the\n&gt; root URL to the consumers - and that&#39;s all they need.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, &quot;hey&quot;, you say, &quot;the consumers still need to know the sematics?&quot;. Yes\n&gt; they do - but all that information can be exposed in humand readable text,\n&gt; formated using xhtml, right inside the API.\n&gt;\n&gt; /J�rn\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
