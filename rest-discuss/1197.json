As I said\nearlier, hypertext has advantages and the primary one is that it is more\ndiscoverable and navigable than a query (or API or messaging interface\nor...).\n\nI do think that queries are an important optimization. Sometimes finding\nout equivalent information through hypertext would take significant\neffort. For instance in the Google case, they have so many word indexed\nthat for bandwidth reasons their hypertext &quot;tree&quot; would probably have to\nbe something like this:\n\np\n pr\n   pre\n    pres\n     prescod\n      prescod+p\n       prescod+pa\n        prescod+paul\n\nThey could of course us balancing algorithms to minimize the size of it\nbut still it would take several back and forth messages to get to the\npoint where we have the information available from:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=prescod+paul\n\nThis hypertext view may be too slow for much real-world use. But on the\nother hand, the hypertext view gives the client access to all kinds of\ninteresting information. For instance by spidering &quot;prescod&quot; I can find\nout all words associated with my name. I could pretty easily find\nGoogleWhacks that use my name. ;) I could scan for first names to find\nother Prescods. The information available in the hypertext version is a\nstrict superset of the information available in the query version, but\nnavigating it may be too inefficient. So I think that in many\ncircumstances, both views are warranted.\n\nGoogle might also want to have the query view be a free service and the\nnavigable view be something that people pay to use for data mining.\n\nOther opinions?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
