What he means may be best explained by a simple example.\n\nAssume we have a resource that represents a folder, and by issueing a POST request, I can attach a file. What, however, if that post request wrongly goes to, let&#39;s say, another document resource instead of our folder, and the document resource also accepts POST (for some reason)?\n\nIn a RPC world, the document type would not understand an &quot;addDocument()&quot; call, and consequently return an exception. But what about REST? Of course, the POST&#39;s attributes most likely wouldn&#39;t be understood and something like 400 Bad Request returned. But what if they were understood?\n\nSo, are there means or patterns, to achieve (some sort) of type safety?\n\nThanks so much,\nJuerg \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
