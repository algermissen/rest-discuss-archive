When I POST\nan HTTP message of that media type  to an HTTP server it seems  \nreasonable to interprete this\nrequest as an intent to order something. The request is self- \ndescribing and its meaning is independent\nof the receiver.  Especially does the self-descriptiveness protect me  \nas a sender from changes of\nthe receiver, changes that could otherwise assign a different meaning  \nto my request.\n\nNow, if I make use of APP, wrapp my oder inside an Atom entry  \ndocument and POST it to an APP\ncollection, I&#39;d interprete that as a request for &#39;storage&#39;,  \nregardless of the entrie&#39;s content being\nan order.\n\nBut what if I POST the order to an APP server as media (not using the  \nenrtry envelope) thus\nbasically asking for the same thing as above? Isn&#39;t the meaning of  \nthe request actually the\nplacement of an order (see above) and not the request for storing my  \nangle brackets order?\n\nThe &#39;201 Created&#39; I am likely to see in both cases isn&#39;t helping  \nmuch, to check the cients\nexpectations.\n\n\nMaybe this seems far-fetched, but if it the receiver side actually  \n*is* capable of affecting the\nmeaning of my request, then I could send my orders in application/xml  \nright away, effectively\nusing HTTP as transport as opposed to transfer (to achieve  \ncoordination of peers).\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
