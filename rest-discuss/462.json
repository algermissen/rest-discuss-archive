The body could just be a URI, for example.\n&gt;\n&gt; You might noticed an apparent contradiction there.  I was assuming that\n&gt; by &quot;update&quot; you meant that the POST body was used in determining how\n&gt; the state of the callback resource was modified.  This may not be the\n&gt; case, because it&#39;s possible that all that resource needs to know to\n&gt; make a state change is *that* a POST was invoked, not the contents of\n&gt; the POST body.\n&gt;\n&gt; MB\n\nI did.  It left me mightly confused.  :)\n\nThe case that boolean notifications are idempotent is that they are flags with\nidentical meaning.  So when a sink receives 2 of them it has the same effect on\nstate as when it receives one, and therefore it is not true that the resource\nidentified by the callback URI necessarily changes state.  On a more literal\nlevel I defer to RFC 2616:\n   9.1.2 Idempotent Methods\n\n   Methods can also have the property of &quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside\n   from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical\n   requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,\n   PUT and DELETE share this property.\n\n0 boolean notifications are not the same as 1 notification, but any N &gt; 0\nnotifications have the same effect as 1 notification.\n\nNow, there _is_ an error in my thoughts from this morning, which is that boolean\nnotifications overwrite whatever the previous state of the flag (as held on the\nsink).  So the proper method is PUT, not GET.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
