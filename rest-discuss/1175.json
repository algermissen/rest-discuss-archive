The \n&gt; Web is not a programming language. Why would you even want to make\n&gt; that comparison?\n\nYes, but just because Paul (or anyone else) makes such a comment doesn&#39;t\nmean that it&#39;s true or useful.  (I.e.: it may be that this is an apples\nand elephants comparison, but there may be many conversational contexts\nin which it useful to compare, contrast, or consider similarities\nbetween apples and elephants.)  I&#39;ve found it particularly instructive\nto compare REST to programming language paradigms, and here&#39;s why:\n\nREST is an &quot;architectural style&quot; --- in some circles (e.g. component /\nframeworks researchers) also called a &quot;compositional style.&quot;  As it\nturns out, all programming languages inherently embody one or another\n(or maybe even many) architectural / compositional styles, so it&#39;s\nuseful to abstract those styles away from particular programming\nlanguage implementations and compare them.  Functional programming is\none such style;  OOP is another, dataflow is another, etc.  (NB:  it&#39;s\neasy to argue that dataflow styles are a subset of functional styles).\n\nAll of these things are mechanisms for decomposing functionality into\ndiscrete pieces and then building up programs by &quot;plugging&quot; these pieces\ntogether and letting them talk to each other.  The abstract model of how\nyou do this is what defines a given style, and whether that is embodied\nin a programming language or a distributed system design is, at some\nlevel, irrelevant.  You can usefully talk about (some of) the\ncharacteristics of one model or the other independent of its specific\ninstantiation.\n\nAnyway, I happen to have found the process of such consideration\ninstructive in understanding REST.  Your (or Paul&#39;s, etc.) mileage may\nvary, but before you jump the gun, consider the following sentence:\n\n   &quot;OOP is to CORBA as ??? is to the Web.&quot;\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
