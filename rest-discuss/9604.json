We want the system to queue such\nrequests to retry them in a batch job later, so when this happens, the server\nis meant to return a 202 Accepted response to the client. All fine and dandy.\n\nThe problem I&#39;ve ran into, and combing the HTTP/1.1 spec isn&#39;t helping here,\nis that it&#39;s not entirely clear how the server should indicate the location\nto poll the status from. To me, it makes sense, unless the request was a batch\nrequest (which, in this case, isn&#39;t so) to use the Location header. However,\nthe spec says:\n\n    &quot;The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the\n    request&#39;s current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some\n    estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.\n\nWhich, to me, makes things a little awkward for the client.\n\nThe prior art I have to support my thoughs on this are Paul Prescod&#39;s\nRESTmail[1] example and the REST goes to Maui[2] example on RestWiki. Can\nanybody think of any reasons why I shouldn&#39;t go down this route?\n\nK.\n\n[1] http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/\n[2] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestGoesToMaui\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
