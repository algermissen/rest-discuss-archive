They&#39;re just not used\nmuch on classic Web sites, and then only when the Web site is being\ntreated more like a filesystem (and the Web ain&#39;t a filesystem, I say).\n\nAs far as I&#39;m concerned, the distinction between GET and POST is both\nnecessary and sufficient for the self-description of request &quot;semantics&quot;.  \nIn any transactional system it&#39;s useful to distinguish between read-only\n&quot;queries&quot; and read-write &quot;updates&quot;. A read-only operation is known to be\nsafely repeatable as well as cacheable, while a read-write operation is\nexpected not to be. PUT and DELETE are superfluous; I&#39;d rather use POST.\n\nFor those who are uncomfortable with the &quot;do something&quot; meaning of POST,\nremember, as always, that HYPERTEXT is our friend. On the Web, you never\njust put together a POST request out of the blue. You browse to a page\ncontaining a form surrounded by text that tells you what posting the form\nis going to accomplish. The request itself needs no more information than\nthe POST method and the URI to which it applies to identify its &quot;meaning&quot;;\nthe users&#39; expectations are set by whatever the page containing the form\ntells them.\n\nThat&#39;s probably not what you meant, Josh, but I&#39;ve just been waiting for\nan opportunity to bash PUT and DELETE. ;}\n\n(And don&#39;t even get me *started* on &quot;CRUD&quot;.)\n\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
