Atom&#39;s format only considered the read/syndication usecase. That\n&gt; was awkward when it came to specifying AtomPub. LINK is similar - how a LINK\n&gt; relationship is created/managed/destroyed is undefined.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this analogy.\n\nThe problem with the atom:id element is not how to add the element to an Atom\ndocument, it is presumably how to generate the value. However, with the LINK\nheader, the question that has been raised is how to manipulate the value, not\nhow to derive the relationships between resources.\n\n&gt; &quot;UNLINK&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; what resource is that method applied to?\n\nI have only lightly followed this thread, so I apologise if I am covering old\nground. I don&#39;t understand why this ID should cover the manipulation of the\nheader value any more than any of the other common HTTP headers have values that\ncan be manipulated with HTTP itself. What is the problem with saying that any\nLINK headers should be managed at the server&#39;s discretion?\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I would want to configure the LINK headers via some static\nApache configuration on the server. I can understand why others might want to do\nit over HTTP, but the server is free to expose some hypertext system for that.\n\nBest,\n\n-- \nNoah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n\n"}}
