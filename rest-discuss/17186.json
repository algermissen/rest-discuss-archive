That is my opinion and nothing more. I can only say that, for the\n&gt; use cases I have encountered, [specific|custom] media types work quite\n&gt; well and I have no immediate plans to stop [using|creating] them as I\n&gt; find the need.\n&gt; \n\nSaying something is or isn&#39;t REST is not a value judgment.  If your\nneeds aren&#39;t served by REST, that&#39;s fine and I&#39;m not one to override\nyour opinion there.  But REST clearly and repeatedly states that it&#39;s a\nstyle based on constraining data elements to a limited set of\nstandardized types.  Nobody has explained to me how it&#39;s following REST\nto ignore this...\n\n&quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\nefficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\nrather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n\n...in favor of developing optimized data types on a per-application\nbasis, except to state that it&#39;s only my &quot;opinion&quot; that REST indeed\nsays exactly what I keep saying it says.  That paragraph does NOT read,\n\n&quot;There is no trade-off, since the uniform interface is optimized for\ntransferring data in application-specific forms.&quot;\n\nI still fail to see how both diametrically-opposed approaches can\npossibly be based on the same thesis.  Roy&#39;s examples have never been\nbased on the creation of custom data/media types.  If REST were worded\nin a completely different way than it is, and Roy&#39;s examples always\n(instead of never) started with the creation of custom types, then I&#39;d\nbe wrong.  But, REST and Roy are both quite clear that the style is NOT\nabout creating custom media/data types, but is in fact the exact\nopposite of that approach.\n\nFollowing REST means taking the thesis literally, in the dozen places\nwhere it calls for STANDARDIZED types.  It has yet to be explained to\nme how it&#39;s possible that using custom types is the same style, or even\nremotely related to Roy&#39;s thesis.  I didn&#39;t define REST, I&#39;m just\nstating the obvious, which is so carefully spelled out as to leave no\nroom to claim that this is only &quot;my opinion&quot;.\n\nSeriously, what&#39;s the argument in favor of calling customized types the\nsame style as REST, again?  As I recall, the argument was a bunch of ad-\nhominems thrown my direction backed up by pointing to O&#39;Reilly books as\nnormative reference.  I refer again to the thesis, and ask where it\nsays anything about data types *without* emphasizing standardization in\nthe same breath.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
