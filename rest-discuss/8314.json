I \n&gt; mean seriously, what is there to get? How can an *entire industry* not \n&gt; get REST until Q406 or thereabouts? I don&#39;t buy it. I think the wheels \n&gt; are falling off the WS industry wagon, and SOA will be next. We&#39;re \n&gt; witnessing one of those once a decade industry re-alignments.\n\nI often think that REST can be difficult for people to understand \nbecause it&#39;s so simple.\n\nMy experience as someone who was (and still is) mainly a web person was \nthat REST codified a lot of stuff I&#39;d learned the hard way in much the \nsame way that when one learns a new software pattern it&#39;s often \nsomething one has already used many times, but now it has a name it&#39;s \neasier to think about.\n\nWith that background when I had to make two computers talk to each other \nover an HTTP connection I&#39;d come up with something relatively RESTful \nwithout a second thought. To someone with a different background of \novercoming different problems, it could indeed seem very foreign.\n\nThe mental block that gets me isn&#39;t so much the one over &quot;how does this \nwork?&quot; but the obstinate belief that the web will never really work \ndespite all of the evidence to the contrary. I sometimes feel like \nJohnson addressing Bishop Berkeley&#39;s theory of the non-existence of \nmatter by kicking a stone and saying &quot;I refute it thus&quot;.\n\nPlenty of people on this list had made computers talk to each other over \nHTTP and in accordance with HTTP before there was any hype around \n&quot;REST&quot;, but people still insist that the web doesn&#39;t work and we need \nrubbish like SOAP to &quot;fix&quot; it, so we need something with an actual name \nbefore they can even dare to belief in it. Similarly, in other aspects \nof the web we have &quot;Web2.0&quot; which, as far as I can see, is the radical \nnotion that the technology we&#39;ve all been using for over 15 years might \nactually work and maybe we should just use it rather than trying to win \nthe glory of being the person who fixes it.\n\n\n"}}
