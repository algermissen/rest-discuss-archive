I concur with Alex about notification messages identifying the type of\n&gt; change made - but I would like all six noted here.\n&gt; Paul wants only &#39;changed&#39;, but I see little extra cost to identifying the\n&gt; type of change and I do see cost using further messages to identify the type\n&gt; of change. I&#39;m thinking of pub/sub with many many listeners - you&#39;d get an\n&gt; &#39;implosion&#39; of &#39;was that change a delete or not?&#39; \n\nFine. So you admit that it is an optimization. All I want to do is leave\nthe precise details of the optimization to the application. If it wants\nto send Unix-format diffs, then it can. If it wants to have six event\ntypes, then it can. If it wants twenty event types, then it can. All I\nask is that the information about what happened also exist in some form\non the web server so that people who miss a message can get caught up.\n\n&gt; ... If listeners almost never\n&gt; care or try to find out, then it&#39;s not as big a deal.\n&gt; Another thing, while I&#39;m up here in the ivory tower, since I would like a\n&gt; notification for &#39;read&#39;, that wouldn&#39;t make sense via a &#39;change&#39;\n&gt; notification. (The reason I want a &#39;read&#39; is that when coupled with a\n&gt; response status of &#39;security error&#39; you can detect security issues and\n&gt; stuff. And I know that non-http based modifications don&#39;t have these\n&gt; concepts, but they can be mapped.)\n\nYou could do a regular CHANGE watch on the file that logs READs. Then if\nyou miss a notification you can always get caught up by reading the\nREAD-logfile. If the only place that information is stored is in the\nnotification then one lost notification and you won&#39;t know that some\nhacker broke into your system.\n\nAs an optimization, notifications about the logfile could of course\ninclude a summary of what happened. The client would only resynch from\nthe actual logfile resource if it realized that it missed a\nnotification.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
