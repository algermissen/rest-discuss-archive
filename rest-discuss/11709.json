I consider myself a REST beginner and I like seeing the\n&gt; advanced discussion on here. I&#39;ve found the discussion to be helpful,\n&gt; informative and friendly.\n&gt;\n&gt; That being said I would love to see the http://restpatterns.org wiki\n&gt; (or something like it) used more.I think it would be valuable to write\n&gt; up strawman proposals, ideas, patterns etc on the wiki to center\n&gt; discussion on here -- similar to how the AtomPub folks used their wiki\n&gt; and Paces to center discussion about AtomPub. Perhaps what&#39;s missing\n&gt; from restpatterns is something that connects the wiki with this\n&gt; discussion list community, something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/HowToGetInvolved\n&gt;\n&gt; As for web forums, don&#39;t we kind of have one already?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/\n&gt;\n&gt; //Ed\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
