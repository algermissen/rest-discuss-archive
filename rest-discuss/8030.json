I&#39;ll respond at greater length once I&#39;ve re-read a\n&gt; &gt; couple of times and thought a bit... but there is one point I can pick\n&gt; &gt; up on right away, from Benjamin:\n&gt; &gt; [[\n&gt; &gt; I challenge the effectiveness of RDF on a number of points\n&gt; &gt; * The effectiveness of the graph structure for conveying data machine\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; machine\n&gt; &gt; ]]\n&gt; &gt; The Web is a graph structure.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s fine in the abstract sense,\n\nMore than that, my user agent (even if it&#39;s just a browser) can wander\naround that graph.\n\nbut\n&gt; * An atom document has an atom structure\n&gt; * A html document has a html structure\n\nBoth of these will describe part of a graph-shaped model, because of\nthe links they contain.\n\n&gt; * A train list document has a train list structure\n\nOk, a list can be expressed directly in a tree or a graph.\n\n&gt; These are the structures I really want to get at when I process\n&gt; information from another component in the network.\n\nAre all your local data models trees?\n\n If these are encoded\n&gt; directly in XML I can extract this information use tree-walking\n&gt; algorithms. If they are encoded into RDF I need a tool that does\n&gt; tree-walking to build up an RDF graph, then I need to do graph-walking\n&gt; to build the structure I really want to extract.\n\nSame question as above.\nNote also that there are several non-XML RDF syntaxes, and that many\nnon-RDF syntaxes can be interpreted directly as RDF (e.g. Raptor has\nan Atom parser).\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; If it is a prerequisite of the machine-processable web to have fully\n&gt; self-describing documents, then we can always translate these to RDF for\n&gt; our storage needs if we really want to. In the mean-time, I would\n&gt; suggest that RDF complicates the common case in favour of an uncommon\n&gt; case that can be solved in a different way once the common case is dealt\n&gt; with.\n\nI would see that the other way around, that RDF doesn&#39;t complicate the\ncommon case because there&#39;s no conflict with passing around XML. But\nwhen you need to integrate data across domains, RDF is mighty handy.\n\n&gt; I believe Mark Baker has a different perspective on this, one which I\n&gt; would like to understand better.\n\nMe too :-)\n\n&gt; I see the claim that RDF provides uniform data, but it really doesn&#39;t.\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t any more than XML provides uniform data. It just provides a\n&gt; uniform way of creating different data types. Uniform data only comes\n&gt; about with RDF when you add vocabulary to it. Uniform data only comes\n&gt; about with XML when you add both vocabulary and structure to it.\n\nRDF uses a uniform naming scheme for entities and relationships\nbetween entities, the same naming scheme as the web, URIs.\n\n&gt; Thus, I suggest that RDF and REST are not an automatic fit to each\n&gt; other. It is necessary to prove that RDF facilitates better ways of\n&gt; constructing uniform kinds of data than XML does. RDF&#39;s uniform\n&gt; structure is not in and of itself a clear win for REST.\n\nRDF is a data model designed with the web in mind, XML is a document\nformat. Both can used to advantage on the web.\n\nCheers,\nDanny.\n\n-- \n\nhttp://dannyayers.com\n\n"}}
