But \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the server authors are aware of this and are adding the Location \n&gt; &gt;&gt; header for both PUT and POST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right. You can&#39;t interpret the ETag of a 201 response correctly \n&gt; &gt; without the Location header.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that it is possible for several resources to be created \n&gt; and each of the urls being presented in the entity body. The \n&gt; Etag of a 201 response would only apply to the entity body of \n&gt; that response, a different resource than the one created.\n\nNo. &quot;A 201 response MAY contain an ETag response header field indicating the\ncurrent value of the entity tag for the requested variant just created.&quot;\nThis section will be clarified in HTTPbis but basically if there is an ETag\nthen it is an ETag for one of the resources created, presumably the resource\nlisted in the Location header. However, there is also no defined meaning for\nwhen the 201 response to a PUT has a Location header that is different than\nthe Request URI; most clients treat PUT as creating a resource always at the\nrequest URI.\n\nThe important point is that the precise meaning of the ETag response header\nis dependent on the request method and the response code. There are many\ncases where the ETag doesn&#39;t have a well-defined meaning and in those cases\nwe are better off ignoring it entirely.\n\nRegards,\nBrian\n\n\n"}}
