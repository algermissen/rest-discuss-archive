I can see real value of not \ncontinually reinventing the weel and at least minting some standard domain \nspecific types like for procurement. I always go back to the vcard example \nwhich although it has no real hypermedia, is very useful as a general way to \nhave systems exchange information (if it happens to be contacts).\n\n\nOn Fri, Dec 30, 2011 at 3:32 PM, Jan Algermissen \n&lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nOn Dec 31, 2011, at 12:22 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n\n&gt; Personally, if there was no concern over minting new types, I would opt \n&gt; the minting model.

I didn&#39;t say that either. I&#39;m saying there are design and\n&gt; &gt; implementation aspects of system interfaces that are not covered by\n&gt; &gt; HTTP. At some level developers (human beings) need to communicate and\n&gt; &gt; reason about the software they write. Every web service provides\n&gt; &gt; information about something. Apart from the practical integration of a\n&gt; &gt; client with a server we need to be able to discuss the &quot;something&quot;\n&gt; &gt; rationale behind a given service.\n&gt;\n&gt; No. You discuss the rationale behind service &#39;kinds&#39; and that is part of \n&gt; setting up the media type. The kind &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess) \n&gt; defined in the media type spec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service \n&gt; X of organization Y. All you need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; \n&gt; and then you say Accept: application/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off \n&gt; you go. There is no need to talk about *that* service any further. The \n&gt; description of the service *is* in the media type. There are *no* (thatis: \n&gt; none whatsoever) service specific descriptions in RESTful systems.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise I as a developer won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if the information of a given service is of interest to me. This\n&gt; &gt; reasoning between developers (human beings) is at a conceptual level.\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore software is not only meant for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant\n&gt; &gt; for humans to read and understand and reason about.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right - but this is intent (&quot;I want to buy a book, therefore I direct my \n&gt; browser to http://amazon.de and not http://weather.info). No architectural \n&gt; style will help to ensure the Amazon is still selling books tomorrow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe the term &quot;conceptual type&quot; was unfortunate. My point in the\n&gt; &gt; discussion was that it may be of interest to talk about the concepts\n&gt; &gt; and information a service is meant to provide in order to then be able\n&gt; &gt; to reason about what media types to use or invent for a given service.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, &#39;entities&#39; such as feeds, feed-entries, images, products, orders, \n&gt; contact-info (vcard), events (icalendar) etc. surely are part of designing \n&gt; media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say it again: the problem that is being tried to solve does not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this your way of saying there is nothing to discuss?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes :-) The whole strict point of &#39;specific media types are a bad idea&#39; is \n&gt; simply confusing people trying to understand REST. Maybe the discussion is \n&gt; useful after all, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or are you\n&gt; &gt; saying there is no problem in deciding whether to define new media\n&gt; &gt; types or not? My understanding of the discussion was that we were\n&gt; &gt; discussing heuristics for inventing (or not inventing) new media\n&gt; &gt; types.\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing is, that it is actually pretty clear that generic media types + \n&gt; embedded specific stuff + a new means for negotiating that stuff is silly \n&gt; because the mechanism for negotiation such stuff is the media type \n&gt; identifier in the first place. It is the mechanism built into HTTP for \n&gt; that purpose.\n&gt; (Not to question the usefulness of standard general link relations \n&gt; orthogonal to media types, of course)\n&gt;\n&gt; Specific media types is what one should do and there is no problem with \n&gt; them. Yet, some people make it sound as if there is a problem - and this I \n&gt; find is adding confusion for others that try to learn REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /Paul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Paul Cohen\n&gt; &gt; www.seibostudios.se\n&gt; &gt; mobile: +46 730 787 035\n&gt; &gt; e-mail: paul.cohen@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
