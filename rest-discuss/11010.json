Let me try to\nclarify. (=\r\nApologies if I&#39;m just repeating myself...)\n\nI&#39;m talking about the best prac=\r\ntice described in the following pages\n(found randomly w/ a google search):\n=\r\nhttp://www.theserverside.com/patterns/thread.tss?thread_id=3D20936\nhttp://w=\r\nww.ervacon.com/products/swf/tips/tip4.html\n\nIt&#39;s often called &quot;POST-REDIREC=\r\nT-GET&quot; or &quot;Redirect After Submit&quot;.\n\nIMHO this pattern exists to get around =\r\nweb browser shortcomings. You\ndon&#39;t use the 303 response to the POST becaus=\r\ne it conveys the right\nsemantics; you do it to prevent double submits when =\r\nthe user plays\nwith the back and reload buttons.\n\nIt would really be nice t=\r\no not have to worry about this and return 200\nor 201 to the POST regardless=\r\n of whether the client is a browser or a\nweb service client. Or maybe have =\r\nsome way to convey the right\nsemantics as well as trigger the redirect.\n\nI =\r\nthink its especially important if you want to use the same HTML w/\nMicrofor=\r\nmats for both your web site and your web service -- i.e.\nbrowsers and web s=\r\nervices clients are accessing the exact same URLs\nand representations. In b=\r\noth cases the client will be asking for HTML\nso how could you use conneg to=\r\n tell them apart?\n\nAnyways... how could I use the Location header or link h=\r\neader to solve\nthis? Could you give me an example?\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\n--- In re=\r\nst-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sebastien Lambla&quot; &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; shoul=\r\ndn&#39;t you be able to return a 201, regardless of what\n&gt; &gt; type of representa=\r\ntion the client accepts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Uh, you can. That&#39;s what conneg is for. Brows=\r\ner gets an html\nversion, maybe\n&gt; redirecting if it makes sense, others get =\r\nwhatever the client and server\n&gt; agreed upon?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Especially if you are =\r\nusing HTML w/ MicroFormats as your content type,\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t it be ideal i=\r\nf your web site and your web service were one\n&gt; &gt; and the same? The redirec=\r\nt on POST best-practice seems to stand in the\n&gt; &gt; way of that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t s=\r\nee how it does that. And the idea that you ahve pages and\nservices\n&gt; seems =\r\nto forget that conneg, 300 and 303 is there *exactly* to ensure\n&gt; several r=\r\nepresentations (vcard, html, json, xml, image) are all\navailable\n&gt; for the =\r\nsame entity. See httpRange-14 et al.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that the right &quot;fix&quot; =\r\nhere would either 1) resolve the\n&gt; &gt; browser problems that require redirect=\r\n on POST so that you are free to\n&gt; &gt; use the response code that best matche=\r\ns your semantics; or \n&gt; \n&gt; I fail to see where a POST always triggers a red=\r\nirect? I happily\nsend back\n&gt; whatever code I want based on the scenario, 20=\r\n4, 200, 201 etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) allows a &quot;next&quot; URL to be communicated with any =\r\nresponse to a\n&gt; POST/PUT/DELETE\n&gt; &gt; request.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s the problem with t=\r\nhe Location: header, the Link: header or simply\n&gt; leveraging the content ty=\r\npe? Like &lt;link&gt; ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
