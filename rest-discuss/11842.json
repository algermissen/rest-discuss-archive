It&#39;s utterly ridiculous, but it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; the was things are... :(\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s two sides of it, one is indeed IIS that blocks a lot of path\n&gt; modifiers and encodings (but that can be deactivated for the most  \n&gt; part), the\n&gt; other one on .net is the Uri class itself that unencode encoded /  \n&gt; everytime.\n&gt;\n&gt; For many of those reasons I&#39;ve departed from relying on asp.net too  \n&gt; much,\n&gt; and the next beta of OpenRasta will just part from the Uri class  \n&gt; alltogether\n&gt; and replace it with something that only decodes when needing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n\n\nAs long as you&#39;re in .NET land (not even ASP .NET), you&#39;ll run into  \nthese issues.  HttpHandlers suffer from the same paranoid URI- \nrejection problem.  The only alternative is HttpListener, which  \ndecodes slashes, but does preserve the original URI as an alternative  \nproperty.\n\nI haven&#39;t used the Uri class in years.  We have our own wrapper that  \ncombines Uri and UriBuilder into a single class, making Uri  \nmanipulations a breeze and safe since it&#39;s an immutable object.  The  \nclass stands on its own with no external dependencies on other Dream  \nfiles.  And like the rest of Dream, it&#39;s distributed under Apache  \nLicense 2.0.  So, reusing it painless.
