Is there a way to do this so that a gener=\r\nic client\n&gt; could deal with it?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The thought then occurred that =\r\nthere doesn&#39;t seem to be a standardized\n&gt; way to define a hypermedia format=\r\n. For example, while everyone agrees\n&gt; what a link looks like in HTML, this=\r\n is not the case for XML or even\n&gt; JSON (or YAML, or ...). Some blogs have =\r\nbeen written about\n&gt; &lt;http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/1054&gt;   this\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/04/hypermedia-and-json&gt;   and\n&gt; suggestions=\r\n have been made, but as far as I can tell, no consensus has\n&gt; emerged.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; And it&#39;s not only links, it&#39;s also parameters that aren&#39;t defined i=\r\nn a\n&gt; standardized way. For example, compare the definition of parameters h=\r\nere\n&gt; &lt;http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/1054&gt;   (not containing info\n&gt;=\r\n about types and default values) with the definition of parameters here\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nhttp://restx.mulesoft.org/restful-server-api&gt;   (includes type, default\n&gt; a=\r\nnd is-mandatory info). \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; So, the question then is: Could/should =\r\nwe try to come up with a standard\n&gt; to describe a custom hypermedia format?=\r\n I&#39;m not talking about a\n&gt; blow-by-blow definition of all available service=\r\ns and resources of a\n&gt; particular application, but about something one leve=\r\nl higher up: For\n&gt; example, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could agree on THE st=\r\nandard way to\n&gt; describe a link in JSON? Or in XML? And then strive to alwa=\r\nys use this?\n&gt; One could then say: I&#39;m using application/json+foo for this =\r\n(some custom\n&gt; format), but it follows the standard way to describe links a=\r\nnd\n&gt; parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether this description itself can be formali=\r\nzed to the point where it\n&gt; is machine readable is another story. It would =\r\nforce clients to be a bit\n&gt; more generic, but would also allow for quick ad=\r\naptations of a format if\n&gt; for whatever reason the standard doesn&#39;t quite f=\r\nit. However, I&#39;d be\n&gt; happy to just know that there is an agreed upon stand=\r\nard way to define\n&gt; links, parameters and whatever else you need in JSON, X=\r\nML and other\n&gt; &#39;base&#39; formats.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Consider also that it would be v=\r\nery nice to point people that are new to\n&gt; REST to such a &#39;standard documen=\r\nt&#39;, since this topic often seems to be\n&gt; very mysterious and odd them.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought...\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Juergen\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; http://r=\r\nestx.mulesoft.org\n&gt; \n&gt; RESTx &lt;http://restx.org&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
