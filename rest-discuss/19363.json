An approach =\r\nthis is not stateful?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Remember the days before electronic banking =\r\nwhen we had to fill out\n&gt;&gt; slips and submit them to a teller?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; POST /t=\r\nransfer-request\n&gt;&gt; {&quot;from&quot;: &quot;http://example.org/acct/12345&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;to&quot;: &quot;http=\r\n://example.org/acct/12346&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;amount&quot;: 300 }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of course.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n But you did what I was afraid of as I was writing my question; you took my=\r\n example where I deliberately broke out into multiple requests to *illustra=\r\nte* situations where state across requests is required and you changed it t=\r\no be trivial which seems to imply there are no applicable use-cases that ne=\r\ned multiple requests.\n\nI hear you, but part of the reason I did that was be=\r\ncause I think it&#39;s\nnot required as often as you claim.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The 2nd reas=\r\non I chose that example is because it was effectively the same as the recom=\r\nmendation for &quot;batch operations&quot; that Richardson & Ruby used on page 230 of=\r\n RESTful Web Services, First Edition which followed page 222 that explained=\r\n why &quot;stateless&quot; is so important.  This implies either batch operations are=\r\n not the same kind of state that Roy admonishes against, or that Richardson=\r\n & Ruby where blissfully unaware of the irony of that recommendation juxtap=\r\nosed with the discussion of the stateless requirement just 8 pages apart. A=\r\nnd if the latter then I would ask it is even possible to create a RESTful s=\r\nystem that has batch operations?\n\nThey sent me a free copy, but I admit to =\r\nnot having read that section.\n\nAs far as batch goes though, as a means of p=\r\nroviding atomicity over a\nstateless protocol, no, I can&#39;t imagine that it c=\r\nan be done RESTfully.\nSomebody might prove me wrong though as I haven&#39;t giv=\r\nen it much\nthought.\n\nIf I can say, you seem to be coming from a very soluti=\r\non-driven place,\nwhere you have a solution in mind and then try to map it b=\r\nack onto\nREST. I would suggest trying the other way; starting only with you=\r\nr\n&quot;business&quot; requirements and moving forward from there, staying within\nthe=\r\n constraints of REST to inform you what a solution might look like.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nAnyway, let me take your example which I assume is RESTful and ask my quest=\r\nion another way. It seems to me that if I started with a state of &quot;500&quot; in =\r\naccount &quot;12345&quot; and &quot;0&quot; in account &quot;12346&quot; and do your POST example I end u=\r\np with &quot;200&quot; and &quot;300&quot; in the accounts, respectively.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However if I no=\r\nw do your POST example *again* it will fail, because I don&#39;t have enough mo=\r\nney in the &quot;from&quot; account to complete the transaction.  So how are the acco=\r\nunt balances not &quot;state&quot; in the context of Roy&#39;s &quot;stateless&quot; requirement?\n\n=\r\nThat&#39;s getting to the point, but as I was suggesting to Brian, I don&#39;t\nthin=\r\nk that&#39;s a very productive question to ask.\n\nThe &quot;fail&quot; there is not a prop=\r\nerty of the message but of one\nimplementation&#39;s reaction to receiving and p=\r\nrocessing the message. The\nlatter is an implementation detail that REST car=\r\nes nothing about. What\nREST does care about is that the message itself is u=\r\nnambiguous about\nits meaning, and that the meaning - &quot;transfer 300 from A t=\r\no B&quot; -\ndoesn&#39;t change when the account balance changes. That&#39;s what makes i=\r\nt\nstateless.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you tell me the reality is that most non-trivial use=\r\ns-cases for a web APIs actually need to be stateful in some ways and that t=\r\nhe &quot;stateless&quot; requirement for REST is an ideal that has benefits when it c=\r\nan be achieved but is often impossible to realize then I think I&#39;d be final=\r\nly coming to an understanding of the stateless requirement.  :-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But =\r\nif you say &quot;No, stateless can be achieved in most cases&quot; then I&#39;m even more=\r\n lost than when I started asking questions on this thread a few days ago. :=\r\n-(\n\nI think it can be achieved in most cases, and IME, most of the cases\nit=\r\n *can&#39;t* are due to efficiency concerns, not because of any\nconflicting bus=\r\niness requirement.  Businesses have been communicating\n(internally and exte=\r\nrnally) statelessly long before computers came\naround.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
