Note\n&gt;&gt;that this statement is about the behavior of the server; it is not about\n&gt;&gt;behavior that an arbitraty client might be able to observe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But if PUT means that the server maps the request-entity &quot;as is&quot; to the\n&gt;request-URI, then the only way that a resource state can change between\n&gt;those two operations is via a client.  From what some are saying, the\n&gt;&quot;behaviour&quot; of the server for PUT will never cause a state change before the\n&gt;subsequent GET (assuming no other external operations are performed in\n&gt;between). Am I wrong about this?\n&gt;\n\nYes.  I didnt say that the server won&#39;t cause a state change.  I just \nsaid that if a state change does occur, then the rule no longer holds. \n In other words, if a state change does occur, then there can be no \ngarantees about the content of a GET following a PUT.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
