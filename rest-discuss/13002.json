Atom&#39;s format only considered the read/syndication \n&gt; usecase. That\n&gt;  &gt; was awkward when it came to specifying AtomPub. LINK is similar - how \n&gt; a LINK\n&gt;  &gt; relationship is created/managed/destroyed is undefined.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand this analogy.\n\nIt&#39;s about managing the state of resources - with atom you have to have \nan id for the entry before the entry resource is created (and that was a \nbootstrap problem for the people who worked on AtomPub). With link you \nhave to have the relationship created and it&#39;ll have to be done out of band.\n\n\n&gt; I have only lightly followed this thread, so I apologise if I am \n&gt; covering old\n&gt; ground. I don&#39;t understand why this ID should cover the manipulation of the\n&gt; header value any more than any of the other common HTTP headers have \n&gt; values that\n&gt; can be manipulated with HTTP itself. What is the problem with saying \n&gt; that any\n&gt; LINK headers should be managed at the server&#39;s discretion?\n\nBecause the thread is about how to manage them without hypertext, as per \nthe title.\n\n\n&gt; I can understand why others might \n&gt; want to do\n&gt; it over HTTP, but the server is free to expose some hypertext system for \n&gt; that.\n\nThat&#39;s the point - I saying it&#39;ll have to.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
