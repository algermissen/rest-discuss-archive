Maybe I was reading into what=\r\n you were saying a little, but you seemed to be implying that the link head=\r\ner should be preferred over using hypermedia, the hypermedia only expressin=\r\ng links that could not be expressed with a link header. That is what I have=\r\n issue with.\n\nI think having links in both the headers and the hypermedia i=\r\ns ok too if you think you need it. I think we&#39;ve been writing spiders for y=\r\nears now with out it so I&#39;m not totally sold on the utility but I don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk it&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot;. The HEAD optimization you mention is interesting, but I wo=\r\nnder how useful the yeilded links are in practice when you lack the context=\r\n of the resource representation. You end up knowing that there&#39;s this &quot;thin=\r\ng&quot; that links to this other &quot;thing&quot; with a certain class of relationship, b=\r\nut you know very little about the &quot;things&quot;. But I suppose it all depends on=\r\n what you are trying to do.\n\nYour statement on how the &quot;human&quot; web and the =\r\n&quot;machine&quot; web are different and require a paradigm shift needs backing up -=\r\n- at least to elaborate on why link headers etc. are the right shift to mak=\r\ne. Yes, I think you need new hypermedia formats for these new types of clie=\r\nnts (and clients negotiating the format they need is built into HTTP and RE=\r\nST) or maybe evolve existing formats, but it&#39;s not immediately obvious why =\r\nyou need to change more than that. Could you elaborate?\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew W=\r\nahbe\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A couple of things:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Link headers aren&#39;t only useful for repres=\r\nentation formats that don&#39;t \n&gt; support linking.  They also help clients tha=\r\nt don&#39;t know (or care) how \n&gt; to process the relationships to a resource, b=\r\nut do know how to \n&gt; manipulate the relationships.  For the situation where=\r\n the client \n&gt; doesn&#39;t care what the representation is and is only interest=\r\ned in the \n&gt; relationships, it can just do a HEAD request to obtain the met=\r\nadata.\n&gt; \n&gt; * IMO, there&#39;s no reason that a link relationship couldn&#39;t be p=\r\nublished \n&gt; both as a LInk header and embedded within the representation.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; * IMO, the established practices of the web were done to solve the \n&gt; i=\r\nssues with the human interactions with a browser.  The programmatic web \n&gt; =\r\nwhere your clients are machines will need different ways to consume the \n&gt; =\r\nsame data so that it can efficiently operate.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Finally, links are met=\r\nadata.  Other established headers define \n&gt; metadata about the resource as =\r\nwell (ETag, Last-Modified for instance). \n&gt; Why not just one more?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bil=\r\nl\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkec=\r\nentral.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
