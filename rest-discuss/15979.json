It is a style, suitable for=\r\n some problems, not for all. When we start changing our solution into a &quot;co=\r\nnvoluted REST&quot;, just for the sake of being Restful, then we are wagging the=\r\n dog.\n\nCheers.\n\nWilliam Martinez. \n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Er=\r\nic J. Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I wrote (as it turns out) a REST applic=\r\nation in 1995 that&#39;s long-since\n&gt; disappeared, but serves to make a point. =\r\n A pizza parlor wanted its\n&gt; customers to be able to order pizza for pickup=\r\n or delivery, from their\n&gt; website.  The order page allowed size, style and=\r\n toppings to be\n&gt; selected.  The confirmation page re-stated the order, add=\r\ning a total.\n&gt; Cancelling the order returned the customer to the blank orde=\r\nr form;\n&gt; placing the order went as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; The customer saw a &#39;thank=\r\n you&#39; page informing them they would receive\n&gt; an &#39;order confirmed&#39; e-mail,=\r\n and a phone call shortly before the order\n&gt; was ready in the case of a pic=\r\nkup.  This page linked back to the menu.\n&gt; The server, upon receiving a POS=\r\nT of the data in hidden input fields\n&gt; from the confirmation page, executed=\r\n a Perl script to convert the name/\n&gt; value pairs into a human-readable ord=\r\ner.\n&gt; \n&gt; This order text was then e-mailed to the pizza parlor, where it wo=\r\nuld\n&gt; be printed out.  The incoming mailbox would only receive from the Per=\r\nl\n&gt; script, so it would only receive orders, so the printout was automatic,=\r\n\n&gt; as was the autoresponder confirming to the customer that the order was\n&gt;=\r\n received by the kitchen, not just the website (by using the customer&#39;s\n&gt; e=\r\n-mail as reply-to).  The frontend customer application was REST.  The\n&gt; bac=\r\nkend m2m process was NOT REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why should it have been?  The need was =\r\nfor reliable messaging that HTTP\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have (if I&#39;d been concerned abou=\r\nt message order, then I&#39;d have\n&gt; used multipart), and a one-to-one connecti=\r\non rather than HTTP&#39;s one-to-\n&gt; many.  So the correct choice of protocol, t=\r\nhen and now, was and is SMTP\n&gt; which is not a RESTful protocol.  REST is no=\r\nt the solution to all\n&gt; problems in Web services development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could an=\r\nother protocol, perhaps HTTP, be used to make this m2m process\n&gt; RESTful?  =\r\nSure!  But it would be convoluted, so what&#39;s the point?  I&#39;ve\n&gt; never advoc=\r\nated REST for the sake of being RESTful, or bending over\n&gt; backwards to sol=\r\nve a problem with REST that&#39;s better and more easily\n&gt; solved otherwise.  F=\r\nor the pizza problem, REST is only relevant to the\n&gt; customer interaction. =\r\n Applying REST elsewhere may be possible, but if\n&gt; the purpose and benefit =\r\nof REST is simplicity, such a complex REST\n&gt; solution misses the point of t=\r\nhe style completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe there&#39;s a problem out there, where syst=\r\nems have been designed\n&gt; for SOA and are now converting to ROA as if it&#39;s m=\r\nerely a different\n&gt; &quot;serialization,&quot; if you will.  So we see efforts to app=\r\nly REST to\n&gt; problems that REST isn&#39;t meant to solve, instead of re-archite=\r\ncting\n&gt; systems in terms of problems REST can solve, while recognizing that=\r\n\n&gt; parts of the system are better off being NOT REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I&#39;ve said bef=\r\nore, saying REST/NOT REST is not a value judgement.  In\n&gt; fact, sometimes, =\r\nfor something to be RESTful can be a mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
