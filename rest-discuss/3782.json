Tell me if this\nlooks good or not:\n\nKey:\n    {id} would be something like &quot;seairth&quot; or &quot;bob&quot; or &quot;cmhinson&quot; or\nwhatever.\n    {abc} is currently a 32-hex character representation of a random 16-byte\nnumber.\n    {uri} is a URL-Encoded URI to be used in a query string\n    &quot;Auth-&quot; indicates these methods require HTTP Authentication.\n    note: almost all of the names are changable (at least until there are\n        resources bound to them).\n\n/{id}\n    POST agreements, GET user-defined page (likely HTML)\n/{id}/inbox/{abc}\n    POST notifications (e.g. send {id} a notification)\n/{id}/notifications/{abc}\n    GET notificaction (e.g. notification sent to others)\n\n\n/{id}/access\n    Auth-GET returns the list of URIs to access the following resources\n    (e.g. /{id}/received, /{id}/agreements, etc.)\n/{id}/notifications\n    Auth-GET returns the list of notifications user has created\n    Auth-POST to create a new notification.\n/{id}/received\n    Auth-GET returns list of URIs to received notifications\n/{id}/received/{abc}\n    Auth-GET returns a received notification\n    Auth-DELETE deletes a received notification\n/{id}/agreements\n    Auth-GET returns list of URIs to existing agreements\n    Auth-POST to create a new agreement returns agreement URI\n/{id}/agreements/{abc}\n    Auth-GET returns an agreement\n    Auth-PUT updates an agreement\n    Auth-DELETE deletes an agreement\n/{id}/sent\n    Auth-GET returns a list of individuals sent notifications\n    Auth-POST to send a notification (after creating the notification)\n/{id}/sent/{abc}\n    Auth-GET returns &quot;record&quot; on the sending of a notification to an\nindividual\n    Auth-PUT updates the &quot;record&quot;\n    Auth-DELETE deletes the &quot;record&quot;\n/{id}/settings\n    Auth-GET returns settings\n    Auth-PUT updates settings\n\nThe above URIs are broken into two groups.  The first group of URIs are\nthose that are accessible by anyone (as long as they know the actual URI),\nand are defined by the RNA spec.  The second group of URIs are those that\nare accessible only to the &quot;owner&quot; of {id}.  Only XML documents are passed,\ncontaining only data (no presentation).  This group of URIs would likely be\naccessed by a client program and not directly by a user.\n\nNow, I am also trying to write a web-based (html) client to demonstrate the\napplication.  Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or less\nmapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,\nsince I needed additional things like edit windows and\n\n/client?uri={uri}\n    Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation\n    {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The\n    &quot;/{id}/access&quot; URI would be the &quot;main&quot; URI, which would return\n    the entry page, main menu, etc.\n/client/addform?uri={uri}\n    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form\n    Auth-POST submits the form\n    {uri} must be one of the &quot;container&quot; URIs (e.g. &quot;/{id}/agreements&quot;)\n    mentioned above that accepts POST (client internally POSTs XML to the\n    target {uri}).\n/client/editform?ur={uri}\n    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form\n    Auth-POST submits the form\n    {uri} must be one of the individual resource URIs (e.g.\n    &quot;/{id}/agreements/{abc}&quot;) mentioned above that accepts PUT (client\n    internally updates using PUT to the target {uri}).\n/client/delete?uri={uri}\n    Auth-POST submits form\n    {uri} must be a parent URI of the URI that will be deleted (which is\n    passed in the form itself).  Response returns the equivalent of\n    &quot;GET /client?{uri}&quot; (minus the deleted resource).\n\nIn general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value\nof {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:\n\n    GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}\n        returns the main menu options\n    GET /client?uri={/{id}/settings}\n        returns a static view of the current settings.\n    GET /client/editform?uri={/{id}/settings}\n        returns a form for editing changes.\n    GET /client?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n        returns a static list of the agreements.\n    GET /client/addform?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n        returns form to add an agreement.\n    etc.\n\nOtherwise, the client is designed to work with any implementation that uses\nthe XML documents associated to the second group of URIs above.  As a\nresult, it would be possible to use the same client to access entirely\ndifferent servers as long as the XML interface stayed the same.  Of course,\nthis is all conceptual now, so I am sure there are some details that I have\noverlooked which may make some or all of this approach difficult to do.\n\nBut, as a general pattern, what does everyone think?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
