Wouldn&#39;t it make sense\nto ask the resource =\r\nwhat it is capable of?  The HTTP specification\ndetails &quot;OPTIONS&quot; as \n&quot;The O=\r\nPTIONS method represents a request for information about the\ncommunication =\r\noptions available on the request/response chain\nidentified by the Request-U=\r\nRI. This method allows the client to\ndetermine the options and/or requireme=\r\nnts associated with a resource,\nor the capabilities of a server, without im=\r\nplying a resource action or\ninitiating a resource retrieval.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.w=\r\n3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.2\n\nSo, it would make sense a=\r\nt this point to return some sort of service\ndescription listing the other m=\r\nethods, what those do, and required and\noptional parameters they each suppo=\r\nrt.  \nI&#39;m not going to argue which description language is the best, but I\n=\r\ndo think that this method should not be ignored.  It could also vary\ndepend=\r\ning on if the request contained an Accept header.  For\ntext/html, it could =\r\nreturn something very human readable.  For\napplication/xml or text/xml, it =\r\ncould return a standardized resource\ndescription in XML.  (For application/=\r\njson, it could return the above\nin JSON notation, etc.)\n\nHas this been disc=\r\nussed somewhere and ruled out and I just haven&#39;t\nfound it, or is this a goo=\r\nd idea?\nThank you,\nAndy Bay / IMarvinTPA\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
