Pagaltzis&quot; &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;And with that we return to PUT: RFC 2616 is perfectly clear\n&gt; &gt;that by using PUT, the client means that omitted parts of the\n&gt; &gt;entity are to be removed. This is 100% unambiguous. By PUT the\n&gt; &gt;client means &quot;replace.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; 100% unambiguous?! This is what I&#39;m just not seeing. Where in\n&gt; section 9.6does it unambiguously say &quot;replace&quot; or &quot;omitted\n&gt; parts of the entity are to be removed&quot;? All I see are:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1. &quot;be stored&quot; 2. &quot;considered a modified version&quot; 3.\n&gt;   &quot;existing resource is modified&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Neither of which means &quot;replace&quot; 100% unambiguously. There&#39;s\n&gt; plenty of ambiguity in both phrases. (BTW, even &quot;replace&quot; is\n&gt; still somewhat ambiguous, since it could mean &quot;partial\n&gt; replacement&quot; or &quot;complete replacement&quot;.) If the spec meant to\n&gt; be 100% unambiguous, why didn&#39;t it just say, &quot;If the\n&gt; Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the\n&gt; enclosed entity SHOULD be considered [a complete replacement]\n&gt; version of the one residing on the origin server.&quot; Now THAT&#39;S\n&gt; unambiguous.\n\nAs Robert Sayre would say, that’s why specs today are so much\nharder to read than 10 years ago.\n\n&gt; By no stretch of the imagination does &quot;modified version&quot;\n&gt; unambiguously mean &quot;complete replacement version&quot;.\n\nIt may be useful to remember that this discussion is about why\nPATCH must be a method separate from PUT, and to then consider\nwhat the wording would look like if you were writing this\nsentence in relation to PATCH.\n\nFor the purposes of PATCH vs PUT, the two wordings you consider\npolar opposites are almost indistinguishable.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
