[ducking for cover]\n\nOf course I have no proof for this - I don&#39;t even know how widespread it is \ntoday ... so feel free to ignore me :-)\n\nSome will argue that we have the uniform interface - that&#39;s \ninteroperability! To some degree they would be right - in REST (HTTP) we \nhave uniform operations GET/POST etc. (verbs) and combine this with \nresources (nouns) and get a uniform interface that everybody knows how to \nuse.\n\nWhat is missing in the equation is the formats we use to encode data. There \nis not only a bunch of different media types - there is also different ways \nto use those media types. That&#39;s where interoperability is missing in REST!\n\nAs Eric puts it in \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18159 : &quot;even though \nthat isn&#39;t how _I_ build\nsystems&quot; and Mike does it in \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18202 : &quot;i usually \nuse the Atom message as a &quot;wrapper&quot; for an embedded payload based on \nXHTML&quot; - exposing the problem with REST (at least in M2M scenarios) that \neverybody simply does it their own way - even when sticking to the REST \narchitecture constraints.\n\nSome systems are going to use XHTML with RDFa while others will use XHTML + \nMicroformats, HAL, JSON, raw XML and so on. In the end developers will have \nto handcraft parsers for each and every piece of data on the web - spoiling \nthe fun of having a uniform interface.\n\nCompare this to the SOAP world where there is no doubt about what format to \nuse: It is XML/SOAP, you get a WSDL, and from this you auto-generate code \nand is up and running in a few minutes. There is exactly(*) one way to parse \nthe data and there is good tooling for it. In the beginning this was not so, \nbut then Microsoft, IBM and others sat down and laid out guidelines for \ninteroperability &quot;WS-Interop&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-I), and \nthings got easier.\n\nNow, I don&#39;t want to turn this into a REST vs. SOAP debate, that&#39;s not the \npoint! What I am trying to say is that maybe REST is missing a set of \n&quot;RS-Interop&quot; guidelines for M2M scenarios?\n\nRight now its like in the early days of SOAP where every vendor had their \nown way of encoding data inside the SOAP envelope. I mean - the community \ncannot even decide on whether minting new media types is a good or a bad \nthing! And that&#39;s a key feature of REST! Come on - we can do better than \nthat!\n\nNeither am I touching upon the problem of semantically understanding the \ndata - that is a different problem that occurs after data has been extracted \nfrom the response - and no interop profiles are going to solve that. I am \nonly focusing on getting the numbers, the strings, the dates, the classes \nand so on out of the response.\n\nIn the time I have spent trying to understand REST and decide on suitable \nrepresentations and media types for my work, I could have created five \ndifferent SOAP APIs of roughly the same complexity. You may call me stupid \nfor that, but at least I don&#39;t think I am alone.\n\nI fear that REST will be a fad - something (maybe not so) soon to be \nforgotten - if nothing is done to make it easier to consume the data found \ninside REST resources. Hopefully it won&#39;t be so - personally I love the \nbenefits that we get from REST, but something is missing for it to get its \nreal break-through.\n\nAnd, please tell me that I am wrong ... that would make REST more perfect \nfor me :-)\n\nThanks for listening.\n\n/J�rn\n\n(*) And, yes, SOAP has its interoperability issues too - I know.\n\n\n"}}
