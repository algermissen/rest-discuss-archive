I understand that the hypothetical I\nprese=\r\nnted is not a simple one and I appreciate your willingness to\naddress it. T=\r\no that end, I found this line in your reply helpful:\n\n&lt;snip&gt;Making deletion=\r\ns happen any other way is _invisible_ to\nintermediaries since what&#39;s really=\r\n going on is not wholly contained\nwithin the headers of the request and the=\r\n response.&lt;/snip&gt;\n\nWhile my assumptions accounted for this particular behav=\r\nior my\nindicating the origin server emits &quot;Control-Cache: no-cache&quot; w/ the\n=\r\nresponses, I take your reply here to be a part of the definition of\n&quot;visibi=\r\nlity&quot; of which I asked earlier  And, even thought my\nhypothetical example w=\r\nas not limited to DELETE actions (i.e. COPY), I\nstill find your example imp=\r\nortant to my line of questioning.\n\nI understand you to say actions on the o=\r\nrigin server that\ninsuffciently inform intermediaries of the status of (pos=\r\nsibly) cached\nrepresentations are thought to be un-REST-ful (such an abuse =\r\nof the\nacronym!). In the case of DELETE this seems rather clear for the\nind=\r\nividual item itself, but not for any related GET-able resource\nrepresentati=\r\nons that might include the target of the DELETE in their\nbody. In other wor=\r\nds, when composite documents are returned upon a GET\n(/get-last-ten-entires=\r\n, etc.), at what point do intermediaries know\nthat these composites are inv=\r\nalid due to the proper use of DELETE\nagainst one of the items that appears =\r\nin the composite resource?\n\nTo my knowledge the answer is that intermediari=\r\nes do not know the\nproper status of any cached representation of composite =\r\nresources that\nare affected by the proper use of DELETE upon a single resou=\r\nrce that\nis included in the GET-able composite. I do not find this conditio=\r\nn\nun-REST-ful, however. For that matter, using PUT to create a resource\n(PU=\r\nT /entires/123) or POST against a factory resource (/POST entires/)\nposes t=\r\nhe same challenge to the viability of any composite resource\nthat intermedi=\r\naries might retain their cache. It it my understanding\nthat there is more t=\r\nhan one way to mitigate this problem using HTTP\nHeaders to indicate the cac=\r\nhe-ability of the (composite) resource,\nwhether the intermediaries must re-=\r\nvalidate the resource before\npresenting the cached version as a response, e=\r\ntc.\n\nThus, it seems to me, that when it comes to the test of &quot;visibility&quot;\nm=\r\ny hypothetical example matches the same behaviors as DELETE, PUT (as\ncreate=\r\n), and POST. In other words, I understand my hypothetical to\ncontain the pr=\r\noper mitigations such that visibility is not violated.\nWith that in mind, I=\r\n conclude my hypothetical, while possibly\ndistasteful to some, does not vio=\r\nlate the principles of Fielding&#39;s\nwork.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\n=\r\nOn Wed, Mar 18, 2009 at 19:16, Eric J.
