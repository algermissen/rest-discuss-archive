A blog feels right for delivery, but raises  \n&gt; the question of who would maintain it and how. A collaborative  \n&gt; approach where everyone would send links to a single person which  \n&gt; would compile the blog post would work. An alternative would be  \n&gt; creating a wiki page for collaborative link gathering, but leaves  \n&gt; the question of how the overview would be delivered on a weekly  \n&gt; basis. Another alternative would be to use this group for both  \n&gt; gathering links (as replies to a single request-for-links weekly  \n&gt; post) and publishing the weekly overview (as a new weekly post).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, what do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Ivan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
