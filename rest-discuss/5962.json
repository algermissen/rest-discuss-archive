And the\n&gt; &gt; informatio=\r\nn which allows you to see how it is different is not\n&gt; &gt; available in the r=\r\nequest, it&#39;s stored in the &quot;session&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; Well, every time I access a =\r\npage representing a stock ticker, it could \n&gt; be different, too.  Every tim=\r\ne I access a Wikipedia article, it\ncould be \n&gt; different.  And the informat=\r\nion about how the Wikipedia article is \n&gt; different, if I&#39;m lucky, is burie=\r\nd in the form of English text in the \n&gt; related discuss page.\n\n\nIndeed. The=\r\n content of a resource can vary and still be the same\nresource according to=\r\n the identifier, e.g. a wikipedia entry\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repres=\r\nentational_State_Transfer  is still\nthe same resource if the entry is edite=\r\nd.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; The above example is also a good illustration of why sessions are\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; bad. It is clearly unscalable to do the above. You can start fixing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n that scalability problem by throwing money at bea or whoever... but\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat way is very expensive. \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing you mean because the sessi=\r\non state is presumably kept\nlocal \n&gt; to one server.  I don&#39;t know how the &quot;=\r\nsession&quot; object in JSP is \n&gt; implemented.  For all I know it could come fro=\r\nm a distributed database.\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier message, session is=\r\n usually stored near\nthe web server (either in memory or in a session store=\r\n/database)\nseparate to the persistent store.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose, instead of usi=\r\nng a &quot;session&quot; object in JSP, I used a separate \n&gt; resource, accessible by =\r\na URL.  Then if that resource was changed, how \n&gt; would the change be propa=\r\ngated to all the other servers in the farm?  \n&gt; Seems you have the same pro=\r\nblem, with a session object, or with a \n&gt; &quot;resource&quot;.\n\n\nThe problem is not =\r\nthe same, because to be a resource the data will\nnot be volatile (in that i=\r\nt may simply disappear with the passage of\ntime) but instead would be store=\r\n in the persistent database and still\nbe available at any future point in t=\r\nime provided that no DELETE\nmethod is used.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; By designing RESTfully yo=\r\nu get to write less cheques.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS note th=\r\nat keeping data in the cookie header is ok. As long as it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; always pres=\r\nented in the cookie header. You have to be able to do\n&gt; &gt; shopping carts so=\r\nmehow.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; Well, I&#39;ve seen examples where people put the shopping cart=\r\n ID into the \n&gt; URL explicitly.  E.g., a POST to http://www.example.com/car=\r\nts/23892\nputs \n&gt; a new item in cart #23892.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lyle Kopnicky\n&gt; Soft=\r\nware Project Engineer\n&gt; Veicon Technology, Inc.\n&gt;\n\nThe example above of an =\r\nidentified cart is a good example of an\napproach that explicitly deprecates=\r\n session (this doesn&#39;t necessarily\nmean that it is RESTful, of course: that=\r\n would depend on the\nappropriate support for the necessary RESTful HTTP met=\r\nhods). I would\nhave an issue with the security weaknesses of exposing the r=\r\nesource\nidentity in a manner that opens a large attack profile but that is =\r\na\nseparate matter ;-) \n\nAlan Dean\nLead Developer, OnlineTravel.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
