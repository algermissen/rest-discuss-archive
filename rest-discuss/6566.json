It seems\nlike an =\r\nexcellent combination of REST theory and realistic\nbest-practices. (It does=\r\nn&#39;t hurt that our own internal REST APIs look\nvery similar.) I may have a f=\r\new comments after a closer reading later,\nbut for now, after a quick scan, =\r\nall I have to say is: Bravo!\n\nAvi Flax\nArc90\nNew York\n\n--- In rest-discuss@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Scott Raymond&quot; &lt;sco@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m getting ready to =\r\nrelease documentation for a REST-style API for\n&gt; Blinksale.com, an online i=\r\nnvoicing application. I&#39;d be keen to get\n&gt; this group&#39;s feedback on the des=\r\nign before formally announcing it to\n&gt; the world. Any and all criticism or =\r\nsuggestions for improvement, both\n&gt; of the documentation and the API itself=\r\n, is welcome. Have a look:\n&gt; \n&gt;    http://www.blinksale.com/api\n&gt; \n&gt; And if=\r\n the service is up your alley, feel free to start building on it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Scot=\r\nt Raymond\n&gt; Blinksale.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
