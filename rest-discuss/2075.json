A central \nmonitoring computer wants to know when a particular driver has entered \nthe car AND through what door did that driver enter.  In this scenario I \nhave two resources, and each one is changing state.  The Car&#39;s child \nresource Door has changed from Closed to Open (and back to Closed).  The \nDriver&#39;s location property has changed from OutsideCar to InsideCar.  I \nneed to know both resources and their state changes to correctly know \nwhich Driver is in the car and what door was used.\n\nI&#39;m having problems connecting these two state changes together to \nprovide the central monitoring computer the correct information.  I \ndon&#39;t want to transmit them separately, since then I can&#39;t always know \nthe two events are related.\n\nI don&#39;t want to say in the Door Open state change that a particular \nDriver opened it because that information (the actor in this scenario) \nisn&#39;t really part of the state change of the door.  I want to keep the \ncommunication primarily state changes of resources, not Events that \ndetail &quot;How, What, Where, and Why&quot;.\n\nI am missing something of the puzzle?  How can I communicate two pieces \nof information in one state change, or link two state changes?\n\nYour help and insight is greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks very much,\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms040504020103070401040405\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms040504020103070401040405--\r\n\n"}}
