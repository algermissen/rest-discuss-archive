It seems like a good desktop HTTP host components and the\n&gt; ability for URIs and XML to be first class language elements.  Would you\n&gt; agree?\n\nOh yes, I certainly would. From the .NET perspective, we really need\nsome &quot;Remote Reference&quot; support as easy as the WS-* support to win\nover developers to the cause. For thoughtpad, I am having to write\nclient classes myself to wrap up the complexity of fully-fledged HTTP\nrequests (including If-Modified-Since and so on). Maybe that is a\nproject for me to consider in 2007 ...\n\nFunnily enough, I was thinking about this general area the other day\nand a little bird was twittering at the back of my brain that maybe,\njust maybe, the LINQ additions to the .NET Framework can be bent to\nthis purpose.\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
