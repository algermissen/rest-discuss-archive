In\n&gt; a S-F model, once the message is emitted there is software to make every effort\n&gt; to get it delivered, including queueing, retries, expiration, failure\n&gt; notification, etc.  Note that SMTP infrastructure already covers all of this,\n&gt; and that the SMTP/HTTP binding I proposed should support it as well.\n\nThat isn&#39;t what I mean by reliability though. If I email you a purchase\norder for a million dollars of work, are we guaranteed that it will\narrive once and only once? I don&#39;t think so. If the last packet of your\nSMTP response does not arrive then I don&#39;t know whether you got it or\nnot. The only safe thing is to send it again. But then I might have\npurchased two million dollars worth of work.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
