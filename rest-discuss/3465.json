The paper describes a RESTful interface\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for tradeable electronic credit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m at a disadvantage here since I really don&#39;t understand the\n&gt; &gt; capability model that&#39;s being described.\n&gt;\n&gt; The basics of the model are fairly simple. Based on your next\n&gt; sentence, it looks like you&#39;ve already groked the main point.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, reading the paper, I got the sense that security is\n&gt; &gt; provided as a result of traversing a graph.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s correct. The graph basically says: &quot;If a user has access to\n&gt; this resource, they are also authorized to use these other\n&gt; resources.&quot; You can tell which resources the user is not\n&gt; authorized to use by noticing that there is no way to get to those\n&gt; resources by traversing the graph. Having a simple and\n&gt; well-defined model like this makes it a lot easier to study your\n&gt; application security and make sure you got it right.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This doesnt seem terribly useful - why should I have to traverse\n&gt; &gt; a graph to get to a resource every time I want to access the resource?\n&gt; &gt;  Why can&#39;t I just directly access it.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can directly access it. Any resource in the graph can have a\n&gt; URI associated with it. You can use this URI to directly access\n&gt; the resource. The graph defines how you get additional URIs, given\n&gt; the ones you&#39;ve already got.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I really dont get this.  Perhaps I&#39;m dense, but it just doesn&#39;t seem\n&gt; &gt; useful to have a world where everybody gets their own URI to a single\n&gt; &gt; resource.  What happens to sharing and linking?\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re not dense, just a little hard of hearing. ;) As I said in\n&gt; the last message, you&#39;re right, you wouldn&#39;t use this model to\n&gt; give everyone their own URI to a single, shared, read-only\n&gt; resource. You use this model to protect and share access to\n&gt; private resources.  Think more about your online banking interface\n&gt; than your Wall Street Journal subscription.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, you might have a capability URL for your bank\n&gt; account. From this resource, you can navigate to resources that\n&gt; let you pay bills and view your withdrawal/deposit history. The\n&gt; account history might be composed of a different resource for each\n&gt; of the calendar months. At tax time, you might give your\n&gt; accountant the URIs for your January to December account history\n&gt; resources. Your accountant can then do up your tax forms, but\n&gt; cannot pay bills from your account.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
