It is quite nice, but isn&#39;t there one  \nproblem with it? Statements like:\n\nGET \t/resource \tRetrieve the entire resource.  Query parameters may  \nbe available to retrieve only parts of the resource.\n\nAnd:\n\nFor example, the following GET operation retrieves the definition of  \nthe EightBallService (Dream SDK/Tutorials/8-Ball):\n\nGET http://myserver/host/blueprints/ \nMindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService\n\nThis operation will return the following XML document:\n\n&lt;blueprint&gt;\n...\n&lt;/blueprint&gt;\n\nTo obtain the output in JSON, simply add the dream.out.format=jsonp  \nquery parameter to the URI:\n\nhttp://myserver/host/blueprints/ \nMindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService?dream.out.format=jsonp\n\n({\n...\n}\n\nMy understanding as that URIs in HTTP are opaque, and that each URI  \nreferences a *different* resource. Therefore:\n\nhttp://myserver/host/blueprints/ \nMindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService?dream.out.format=jsonp\n\nDoes not retrieve a different format of the resource at:\n\nGET http://myserver/host/blueprints/ \nMindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService\n\nIt retrieves a different resource. In other words, my understanding  \nof the HTTP spec&#39;s use of the term &quot;resource,&quot; and also Roy&#39;s use of  \nit in his thesis, gives no special meaning to a question mark in a URI.\n\nI do exactly what you are describing, because the user trying to  \nfigure out our information architecture from the URIs may indeed  \napply special meaning to that question mark. (In my model for URI  \ndesign, the part of the URI left of the question mark defines a  \nconceptual thing from the user&#39;s perspective, but not a resource from  \nthe HTTP or REST perspective.) So I think it makes sense to do what  \nyou&#39;re doing from a usability perspecitve, but my feeling is your  \narticle may be inaccurate when it says you can apply query parameters  \nto a URI to get a subset or different format for a single resource.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\nOn Jan 1, 2007, at 9:27 PM, Steve G.
