They might also be a source of\n&gt; inspiration for anyone interested in putting together a full-blown REST\n&gt; toolkit. PICT and Nomadic PICT are probably the most interesting ...\n&gt; implementations for Linux available here,\n\nCf. Piccola instead.  Much more approachable for most of the folks who \naren&#39;t steeped in that particular lit, I&#39;d imagine.
