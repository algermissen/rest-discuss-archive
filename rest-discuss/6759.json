Roy, you really really ought to review the MetadataInURI  \n&gt; finding.  You were on the TAG, it&#39;s about URIs and metadata, you  \n&gt; don&#39;t like the first sentence, you know everbody..  &#39;nuff said.\n\nYeah, but I left the TAG in order to get some important work done, and\nthat isn&#39;t going to get done if I try to stick my head back into the\nTAG editorial process.\n\n&gt; 2.  There are at least a few obvious questions you didn&#39;t answer,  \n&gt; fair enough.  The &quot;think for yourself&quot; line is always good advice.   \n&gt; But I want to poke a little more at the question of representations  \n&gt; of REST and versioning. Is REST fully completely captured for all  \n&gt; time in your thesis, or is your thesis a representation of REST at  \n&gt; a point in time?  That is, is the REST resource immutable or  \n&gt; mutable?  Obviously your dissertation will not change but I have  \n&gt; thought that the dissertation was a capture at a point in time.\n\nHeh, I deserve a little wishful thinking.  REST is an architectural  \nstyle.\nIf people can explain the style better, then yes the representation will\nchange even if the dissertation doesn&#39;t.  Note, however, that the first\nthing anyone (other than me) does when they start describing REST is\ncome up with some extremely lame excuse for why the style should change\nto fit their latest pet example, as opposed to just being honest about\nit and describing a new style that fits their new constraints.\n\nThe habit of glomming onto the REST name, as opposed to doing what I ask\nand thinking about each new architecture as an opportunity to define a\nnew style when the existing ones don&#39;t fit, is particularly annoying.\nIt is possible to completely lose most of REST&#39;s beneficial properties\nby adding a single contrary constraint or relaxing one that doesn&#39;t\nseem as &quot;important&quot; as the others, and very few people are capable of\nrecognizing that because the interrelationships in trade-offs are\nactually very complex (even with a simple style).\n\nAt the same time that I encourage people to follow the design thinking\nin my dissertation to discover their own styles, I would prefer that\npeople not use the REST name to associate those different styles with\nwhat I defined.  Wishful thinking, perhaps, but that is what I prefer.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
