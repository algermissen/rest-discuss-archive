But some are more widely used than others. That&#39;s the point I\ncontinue to press: Start with the most widely used application\ninterface &quot;framework&quot; (eg APP -- by framework I mean nothing more than\na set of constraints) that could possibly work for your application.\nWhen you specialize it to your needs, find the most general way to\nspecialize it that can possibly work. If you recursively follow this\nprocess, you stand a better chance of having the interface you&#39;ve\ndesigned become widely used as well.\n\n&gt; Ok, so let&#39;s take RDF and OWL. These two are linked via rdf:class, but\n&gt; they have different semantics (in the formal sense, their model theories\n&gt; are not the same). What this means is that if you serve OWL content\n&gt; using an RDF media type, consuming clients are not expected to consume\n&gt; it with an OWL reasoner and if they do, any inferences drawn by an OWL\n&gt; applying client can be repudiated by servers. It&#39;s not actually OWL\n&gt; according to Web architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now add in the XML media type. If I serve an RDF document as\n&gt; application/xml can you apply an RDF reasoner to it? What about FOAF? Or\n&gt; an HTML page with hCard, SVG, RDFa and hAtom? It&#39;s all undefined.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dropping down to lexical forms and namespaces, if I serve an Atom feed\n&gt; as application/xml, are you allowed to consume it as Atom? And if you\n&gt; are, in what can clients reasonably expect servers to stand over? What\n&gt; about those DRM and other extensions people are going to add as AtomPub\n&gt; sees wider adoption for integrations?\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I can tell, this is a big gap in the Web&#39;s as-deployed\n&gt; architecture. XML formats can be mixed up without any guidelines as to\n&gt; what downstream clients can assume of the data. Semantic web formats\n&gt; have significant variation in what they can deduce. JSON is arguably in\n&gt; an even worse place as it has no technical basis for anything other than\n&gt; code on demand. I don&#39;t know where to start with RDFa - how is lexical\n&gt; tunneling any better than transport tunneling?\n&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t a problem now as we don&#39;t ship around much content that needs\n&gt; reasoners. We deal with low level bugs like encoding screwups and\n&gt; malformed content, but technically Content-Type supersedes any claims\n&gt; made inside the content itself. Yes, there&#39;s RFC3023, but it&#39;s a\n&gt; technical description of a switch block for HTTP+XML that deals with\n&gt; encoding issues, and not semantics. So give it time.\n\nNo argument. The HTTP/MIME media type declaration architecture is\nserious need of a major overhaul.\n...\n\n&gt; &gt; I hope that in delving into all these details, we don&#39;t lose sight of\n&gt; &gt; the main issue: the meaning of the &quot;application neutral&quot; constraint and\n&gt; &gt; the motivation behind it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Understood. But I think the content and semantic mixing issues are real,\n&gt; not just theoretical and are more likely to occur as user agents become\n&gt; more automated.\n\nPerhaps that&#39;s the nub of the issue. I have VERY low expectations\nregarding user agents doing sophisticated automatic interface\ninference and negotiation any time soon. IMO too much wasted effort\ngoes into this AI-hard problem. CORBA tried it. WS-* tried it.\nSemantic Web is trying it. Such attempts add major complexity in\nreturn for little or no results -- so far. Someday? Maybe.\n\nI&#39;m just looking for better MANUAL approaches to ensuring better\ninteroperability. We have so far to go in this regard, why waste time\ntrying to automate what human beings don&#39;t yet know how to do well?\nLet&#39;s walk before we run. So even if the use of APP and other widely\nused application interface frameworks are applied and slightly\nspecialized in purely INFORMAL ways, we can still make progress. If we\ncan clean up mechanisms like media type declarations along the way,\nI&#39;m all for it. But I don&#39;t want to wait for such mechanisms to be\nfixed before proceeding with informal &quot;social&quot; mechanisms.\n\nThe Web has evolved a lot faster with sloppy agreements (&quot;rough\nconsensus and working code&quot; -- and general protocols) than lots of\nattempts based on (overly) formal agreements. Let&#39;s keep going: Just\nenough formalization just in time.\n\n-- Nick\n\n"}}
