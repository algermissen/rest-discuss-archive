Th=\r\nat is, for scalability, the server needs to avoid keeping session informati=\r\non. IN other words, server should not remember the clients, and operations =\r\nshould not be required to have past state on the server to work. \n\nIf the c=\r\nlient needs to perform a second operation based on a past state, the client=\r\n should send to the server all that is needed.\n\nUsually, session is used in=\r\n security to authenticate once keep a conversation with the server once aut=\r\nhenticated. That breaks a little REST, as it may force the server to learn =\r\nabout you and keep session information. If you really need that, you then h=\r\nave an unrestful section in your solution. Is that bad? Not really.\n\nCAn be=\r\n done differently? Yes, in several ways, including sending credentials each=\r\n time or adding an identifier, being a token or a digital signature. REST I=\r\nn Practice book (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829/ref=3Dcm_cr_re=\r\nv_prod_title) has a full chapter in security that may help.\n\nWilliam Martin=\r\nez.\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Zhi-Qiang Lei &lt;zhiqiang.lei@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a new comer to REST.
