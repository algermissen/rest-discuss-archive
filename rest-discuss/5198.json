Why does an intermediate &#39;config file&#39; have\n&gt; to be generated?\n\nWell, mostly because\n\n- there will need to be manual additions\n- nagios just needs that file and there is likely no chance to install\n   a modified (with REST interface) nagios\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have imagined doing this with a DHCP server and nagios or similar.\n\nYou mean adding a REST interface?\n\nAnd....what role does the DHCP server play? (sorry to be slow...but this\nsounds interesting)\n\n&gt; It would be nice if all networking hardware and software was exposed\n&gt; as resources over HTTP with RDF representations.\n\nYes, it would. OTH, I am working in an environment where sometimes  \nall you\nhave is bash (do not even think of an HTTP server) and no chance to  \ninstall\nany libraries that are not already on the hosts.\n\nHell...I am even facing the need to sort of &#39;tunnel&#39; HTTP through  \nemail+someone\nusing a floppy to get data from one network to the other due to  \nrestrictive\npolicies. (not sure whether this is doable at all with clever caching).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [snip]\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hmm...maybe that  is the principle already: greater reusability or\n&gt;&gt; being able to\n&gt;&gt; plug in filters between the GET and the POST in case there is a\n&gt;&gt; semantic change in\n&gt;&gt; the RDF graph I GET.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &#39;Semantic change&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt; By the principle of &#39;partial understanding&#39;, if predicates you don&#39;t\n&gt; understand are used in the RDF, its OK to ignore them.\n\nRight. I mean a change that is not downwards compatible, such as one\npredicate being substituted by a (set of) new ones.\n\nThanks - these are stimulating thoughts.\n\n&gt;\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n_______________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer                         \nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;   \nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
