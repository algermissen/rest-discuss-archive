However, there are a lot of privacy concerns with tran=\r\nsmitting SSNs in plain text.  How would I be able to design a REST service =\r\nwhen my primary identifier is information that I don&#39;t want to be part of t=\r\nhe GET URL?\n\nI was envisioning the service to have something like:\n\nhttps:/=\r\n/example.com/Customer/444556666\n(Where 444-55-6666 is the customer&#39;s SSN)\n\n=\r\nI see some alternatives:\n\n1) Don&#39;t use SSN as a primary identifier.  Easier=\r\n said than done.  The industry is moving this way, but it may be many years=\r\n (if ever) before they are not used at all.\n\n2) Use Post for queries also b=\r\necause then the SSN would be encrypted with the SSL request.  This isn&#39;t ve=\r\nry consistent with the REST patterns.\n\n3) Walk the service tree.  Have requ=\r\nests start at https://example.com/Customers and then return the list of URL=\r\ns with the address to get the specific customer information.  However this =\r\ndoesn&#39;t scale.  We currently have over 50 million customers.  Searching on =\r\ncommon name doesn&#39;t work either because it isn&#39;t even close to unique.\n\nAny=\r\n suggestions?\n\nThanks,\nTim\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C570EA.EDABAE4C\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 6.0.6603.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITLE=\r\n&gt;Confidential information in GET URLs&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;!-- Converted=\r\n from text/rtf format --&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;I work in an in=\r\ndustry where the primary identifier for a customer is a Social Security Num=\r\nber.&nbsp; However, there are a lot of privacy concerns with transmitting S=\r\nSNs in plain text.&nbsp; How would I be able to design a REST service when =\r\nmy primary identifier is information that I don&#39;t want to be part of the GE=\r\nT URL?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;I was envisioning the s=\r\nervice to have something like:&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;A HREF=3D&quot;https://example.com/Customer/444556666&quot;&gt;https://example.com/Cu=\r\nstomer/444556666&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;(Where 444-5=\r\n5-6666 is the customer&#39;s SSN)&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;=\r\n&gt;I see some alternatives:&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;1) =\r\nDon&#39;t use SSN as a primary identifier.&nbsp; Easier said than done.&nbsp; T=\r\nhe industry is moving this way, but it may be many years (if ever) before t=\r\nhey are not used at all.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;2) Us=\r\ne Post for queries also because then the SSN would be encrypted with the SS=\r\nL request.&nbsp; This isn&#39;t very consistent with the REST patterns.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;3) Walk the service tree.&nbsp; Have =\r\nrequests start at &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;https://example.com/Customers&quot;&gt;https://example=\r\n.com/Customers&lt;/A&gt; and then return the list of URLs with the address to get=\r\n the specific customer information.&nbsp; However this doesn&#39;t scale.&nbsp;=\r\n We currently have over 50 million customers.&nbsp; Searching on common nam=\r\ne doesn&#39;t work either because it isn&#39;t even close to unique.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Any suggestions?&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=\r\n=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Thanks,&lt;/FONT&gt;\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;/BODY&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C570EA.EDABAE4C--\r\n\n"}}
