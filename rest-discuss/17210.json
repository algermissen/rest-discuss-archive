I tried to search it using Google, but couldn&#39;t find a=\r\nny\n&gt; clear explanation about this.\n&gt; Does anyone know whether I have the ri=\r\nght conclusion or not?\n&gt; Could anyone refer me to an academic reading for t=\r\nhis matter,please?\n&gt; Thanks alot.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Reza Lesmana.\n\n"}}
