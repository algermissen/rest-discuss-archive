You see, from\nmy point of view what we do now (or part of =\r\nwhat we do now) and\nspecially in companies like Google, *is* designing for =\r\nthe future. If\nyou don&#39;t invent the future now, somebody else will do it an=\r\nd you&#39;ll\nbe history soon enough (when I mean you, it&#39;s a generalized you, n=\r\not\nyou personally :)\n\nSo HTML will work today?
