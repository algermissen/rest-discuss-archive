The server is\n&gt; holding state on the client&#39;s behalf.  That&#39;s the problem.\n&gt;\nSince the Web has migrated on its own to a system where the server holds\nauthentication information on the client&#39;s behalf, doesn&#39;t this indicate an\nactual benefit to that approach?\n\nWhy is it that nobody uses HTTP Auth? Regardless of the &#39;Basic&#39; auth-type\nbeing unsecure, why do so many systems use something else?\nAnd why isn&#39;t there an RFC describing/standardizing current practice? The\nservlet engines I know have a servlet config for authentication called &#39;form\nauth&#39; which makes it easy to use POST to authenticate & then pass down a\ncookie.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it make sense to describe a use of HTML FORM that indicated to the\nuser-agent (the browser) that it was &#39;authentication&#39; information and then\nthe browser could send it in the correct header? Or maybe a new HTML element\nlike &lt;AUTH&gt; or something...\n\n\n"}}
