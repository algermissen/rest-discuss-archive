I&#39;m positive that our interpretation of GET will\n&gt; remain unscathed.  I *expect* POST will be fine too, but I&#39;m not\n&gt; certain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow, somebody should write this model down so that an extended\n&gt; interface could be properly designed to support it.  It could end\n&gt; with a clutter of new methods like SET, REMOVE, etc.. but should\n&gt; ultimately be pretty valuable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to design the interface after the model has been\n&gt; described, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the best person to design the\n&gt; model, since my first stab at my &quot;abstract model&quot; is clearly\n&gt; lacking in important ways, as this discussion has revealed.\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Sep 13, 2002 at 11:47:59AM -0400, Mathews, Walden wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Does Roy mean that all resources exist always, even prior to\n&gt; &gt; their identification by the relevant naming authority?  Or does\n&gt; &gt; he mean that once a resource is born, it always exists, even\n&gt; &gt; after it&#39;s been deleted?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it must be the latter, else we have to ask what the\n&gt; &gt; meaning of &quot;Created&quot; is in response to some PUT or POST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As an implementation detail, it may be difficult for server software\n&gt; &gt; to keep track of all deleted resources that may have once existed,\n&gt; &gt; given that resource space is effectively infinite.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If someone does a DELETE on a resource that has never existed,\n&gt; &gt; should the server discriminate that case against the case of a\n&gt; &gt; deleted resource?  I don&#39;t think so...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps a better way to think of it is thus:  DELETE is idempotent\n&gt; &gt; in the sense that it describes an end-state of a resource, not\n&gt; &gt; a method.  So, the existence of a resource is not an important\n&gt; &gt; pre-condition for DELETE.  A 200 response to DELETE always means\n&gt; &gt; &quot;okay, it&#39;s not mapped (now)&quot;.  And who cares how we got to that\n&gt; &gt; state.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Walden\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, September 13, 2002 9:25 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] [fielding@...: Re: Resources always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So it looks like DELETE should not return 404.
