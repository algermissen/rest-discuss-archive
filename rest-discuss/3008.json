Registries are not required for Web Services but are\n&gt; useful. But the same could surely be said for RESTian services too?\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I misunderstanding something?\n\nWell, there&#39;s registries, and then there&#39;s registries.  Unfortunately\nI was asked to be brief, so I couldn&#39;t elaborate much in the interview.\n\nI&#39;m referring to the &quot;link database&quot; form of registry, where to even\ncreate a service requires registration, rather than registries for\nthings like media types which are just trusted identifiers published by\nan authority to demonstrate that it meets some minimum level of quality\n(e.g. text/html vs. text/x-foofoo).\n\nFWIW, the prevalence of WSDL-over-GET, despite the push for UDDI, shows\nhow strong the forces of decentralization can be.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
