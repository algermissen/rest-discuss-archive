Remember that part of the genious of HTTP is\n&gt; &gt; that basic implementations are so simple. MUST&#39;s start raising the bar.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s true.  Perhaps SHOULD.  The problem with MAY is that nobody\n&gt; implements it, and application developers can&#39;t depend on it.\n\nSHOULD also means they can&#39;t depend upon it. Anyhow, here is the\noriginal proposal:\n\n(4) It might be useful to require an appropriate validator\n(entity tag or last-modified header) in every notification.  In a\nsense, clients are simply caches for particular representations,\nand the HttpEvents &quot;protocol&quot; is just a push-based cache\ninvalidation protocol.  We should reuse the appropriate pieces of\nHTTP in this capacity.\n\nMaybe you can go into more detail about why this is important for\nclients, servers, intermediaries, how you expect it to be used etc. so\nwe can figure out how important it is.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
