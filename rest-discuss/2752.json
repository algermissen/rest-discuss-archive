(I don&#39;t know the Apache\nsyntax)\n\nThis is a good idea even independent of REST since the public URL doesn&#39;t\nhave name of the implementation file (one.cgi) which could change if the\nsystem migrates to another technology (e.g. one.jsp). The URLs have a longer\nlifetime and this is good.\n\n\n\n"}}
