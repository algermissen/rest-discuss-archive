There seem to be two common\n&gt;     bryan&gt; approach=\r\nes: stuff the versions into the URI somewhere and\n&gt;     bryan&gt; version the =\r\nmedia types and use content negotiation. What\n&gt;     bryan&gt; are the pros and=\r\n cons of each approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; I fail to understand this I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you=\r\n have a PUT of a resource with a field that is new, and the old\n&gt; API witho=\r\nut that field is still valid, you can somehow make up that\n&gt; new field, rig=\r\nht?\n\nI could default it to something reasonable when it&#39;s not present, like=\r\n null, or &quot;N/A&quot; !?!?\n\n&gt; So why can the existing API not handle that new fie=\r\nld?\n\nAdding a field might be the kind of extensibility that does not result=\r\n in a compatibility problem. Clients can ignore fields they don&#39;t understan=\r\nd and servers can default them if not provided. No problem.\n\nWhat about cha=\r\nnges that cannot be backwards compatible?\n\n&gt; So my point is that if the old=\r\n API still has to work, you can always\n&gt; differentiate between calls doing =\r\nit the old/new way, and make up for\n&gt; the differences transparently.\n\nYeah,=\r\n this &quot;differentiate between calls doing it the old/new way&quot; thing is what =\r\nI&#39;m asking about.\n\n&gt; If thinks have to break, you can&#39;t use versioning anyw=\r\nay.\n\n\n\n"}}
