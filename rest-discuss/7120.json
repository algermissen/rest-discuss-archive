Resource creation upon POST is mand=\r\natory for an APP \ncollection.\n\nWhen designing a system using HTTP *and* APP=\r\n (meaning: assuming them both to be \npervasive) this has an (IMO) interesti=\r\nng effect on the options you have when designing how \nto &#39;get stuff done&#39;. =\r\nIf I want to launch a rocket for example, I can only do this through \nmanip=\r\nulation of resource state and not through having a rocket-launcher-processo=\r\nr \nprocess some rocket-launch-control data. I either need to set the state =\r\nof a given rocket-\nresource to &#39;launch&#39; or I need to ceate a rocket-resourc=\r\ne, maybe with some appropriate \ncontrol data (which is IMHO equivalent to i=\r\nntended-resource-state-after-creation - see \napp:draft[2][).\n\nActually, I w=\r\nonder if actions that are performed through &#39;process this&#39;-POST (and not \nt=\r\nhrough manipulation of resuorce state) aren&#39;t in fact hidden RPC anyhow and=\r\n thus are \nagainst REST&#39;s architectural principles. In which case APP would=\r\n rather be setting matters \nstraight as opposed to adding an additional con=\r\nstraint.\n\nPractically, I think that having less design options for how to g=\r\net an action done in a \nsystem helps people understand how to approch syste=\r\nms design with REST.\n\nNow, if that does make any sense at all, I&#39;d be very =\r\ninterested in comments on this.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1] http://bitworking.org/projects/=\r\natom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-11.html\n[2] http://bitworking.org/projects=\r\n/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-\nprotocol-11.html#rfc.section.12.1.1\n\n\n\n"}}
