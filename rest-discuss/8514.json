Therefore, gradual accumulation of \n&gt; shopping cart contents conflicts with the context-less (or stateless \n&gt; in other words) requirement.\n\nNot at all.\n\nA server can maintain a shopping cart resource identified by a URI. The \nstate of this resource would include what authentication information is \nneeded to access it, it&#39;s contents and so on.\n\nThe client can then use the cart&#39;s URI to identify it to the server. The \nimportant thing is that the cart is being identified explicitly by the \nclient, rather than the server identifying the client (through session \nkeys, cookies etc) and then finding the cart for that client.\n\n\n"}}
