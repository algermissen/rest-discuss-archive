This happens \nto be a particular English-language text/plain document in the encoding \nus-ascii. It is one of the rules of RFCs that this document has a \nnormative status that does not apply to other plausible representations \nof the RFC.\n\nThere could be other English language text/plain;charset=us-ascii \ndocuments that are not normative (say, with added commentary). Different \nresource.\n\nIt is not a matter of content-negotiation. The normative version of any \nRFC refers to an actual bunch of 1s and 0s.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying \n&gt; you can&#39;t do it your way, I&#39;d just rather do it mine because it seems to \n&gt; makes a lot more sense.\n\nYou can&#39;t do it your way because it makes absolutely no sense.\n\nIf the way to refer to the normative version of an RFC is to use a \ncombination of a URI and an accept header (and an accept-language \nheader, there will only be one normative language version). Then no \ntechnology apart from HTML5 will be able to reference the normative \nversion of an RFC.\n\nThere are other cases of this. Here in Ireland English is &quot;an official \nlanguage&quot; and the language most commonly spoken, but Irish is &quot;the \nofficial language&quot;. Laws are generally discussed in English, but the \nnormative version of any statute, ordinance or constitutional amendment \nis the Irish-language version.\n\nIts generally true of other jurisdictions as well that only one, or a \nsmall subset, of translations of a law are normative, but the Irish case \nis significant in this regard because the language most obviously used \n(people are working with Accept-Language: en) is different to the \nnormative one. Do you not see how this makes the &quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann \nas gaeilge&quot; a different resource to &quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann&quot;?\n\n&gt; Needlessly doing URI-based content negotiation \n&gt; and creating multiple URIs for the same resource seems to imply that \n&gt; separating the concepts of resources and representations is not only \n&gt; unnecessary - but undesirable.\n\nIdentifying multiple things seems to indicate that they are multiple things.\n\n&gt; And by your logic - only &quot;representations \n&gt; we don&#39;t care about should be made available via HTTP conneg, every \n&gt; important representation should be it&#39;s own resource&quot;. It just doesn&#39;t \n&gt; make any sense and you don&#39;t provide any substantial rationale for your \n&gt; opinion either, you just state it.\n\nIt depends on what you mean by &quot;important representation&quot;. If you are \ndeeming to talk about a representation its already become a resource. \nIt&#39;s a thing, it&#39;s not a shadow.\n\n&gt; Could please explain why you feel that HTTP content negotiation \n&gt; undermines content negotiation.\n\nHTML content negotiation (&quot;content dictation&quot; would be a more accurate \nterm) undermines HTTP content negotiation.\n\nYou are proposing to do away with content negotiation because we use the \nthe Accept header to perform it, which your proposal is hi-jacking to \nserve as part of an identifier.\n\nWhat do we use to perform content-negotiation?\n\n&gt; How are intermediaries and caches supposed to know whether a PUT to \n&gt; /document.xml means that changes have been made to /document.json, or \n&gt; /document.pdf ?\n\nWhy are they supposed to care? Either staleness in this regard is okay \n(and the cache-related headers say so) or they will need to re-check \n(and the cache-related headers say so) and receive a 200 rather than a 304.\n\nIf this were a problem then how would they also know that a PUT to \n/document.xml also changes / (because / contains a list of documents) \nand /users/1234 (because this contains a list of documents recently \nchanged by /users/1234) and /users/1234/documents (because this contains \na list of all documents changed by /users/1234) and /search?q=sumpsimus \n(because /document.xml now contains the word &quot;sumpsimus&quot; but it hadn&#39;t \nbefore) and /search?q=mumpsimus (because /document.xml now doesn&#39;t \ncontain the word &quot;mumpsiums&quot; but had before) and /documents/recent and \n/document.rdf (which contains Dublin Core and FOAF metadata \nautomatically generated from processing /document.xml) and \n/documents.rdf (which contains the same for all documents in a single \nRDF file), /users/2341/watchlist (because criteria have indicated user \n2341 is likely to find this document of interest in some way) and /xe2s3 \n(&quot;another department put that in for their uses, we&#39;re agnostic to \nwhatever its doing&quot;) /sitemap.xml, /docs.kml and so on?\n\nFor that matter. How are they even going to know that a PUT to \n/document.xml that didn&#39;t go through them means that /document.xml has \nchanged?\n\nIt can&#39;t. But we can do things RESTfully and this won&#39;t be an issue.\n\n\n"}}
