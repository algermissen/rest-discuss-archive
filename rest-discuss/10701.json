I infer from &quot;we do not guarantee that [any observation interval]\n&gt;       URL will exist in the future&quot; that you&#39;ve decided that such URLs\n&gt;       should be considered ephemeral, ie not &quot;cool URLs&quot;. Since cool\n&gt;       URLs are good practice according to the AWWWv1 and TBL, can you\n&gt;       share the thinking behind not following good practice? Would users\n&gt;       never want to bookmark such observation intervals?\n\nIn practice these URLs are &quot;cool&quot;, I suppose.  When we change the shapes \nof URLs we always implement redirections from the old to the new shapes.\n\nMy statement about them not being guaranteed arose from the fact that we \nencourage automated agents not store URLs unless it is absolutely \nnecessary.  That policy is mostly about avoiding having many URLs in the \nwild that are obsolescent and taking the multi request overhead of \nredirection.\n\n&gt;    2. I assume that the URLs to the metrics are cool, eg\n&gt;       http://foo.example/ metrics/232/ &lt;http://foo.example/metrics/232/&gt;\n&gt;       . If not, what is the cool URL that bootstraps me into the system\n&gt;       and how do I navigate to metric URLs like this one? And again, why\n&gt;       was the decision made to not follow good practice by making metric\n&gt;       URL ephemeral.\n\nAs with observations, any particular metric URL will be supported for a \nlong time.  However that longevity may be achieved by the use of \nredirection should we need to change the disposition of the resource.\n\nAs for how to navigate to the metric, we have implemented a resource \ndiscovery mechanism which we generally use as the main entry point.  I \nhave describing it at \nhttp://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2008/01/restful-service-discovery-and-description/ \nif you are interested.\n\n&gt;    3. I am trying to measure the coupling of your approach in terms of\n&gt;       fixed points: dependencies that must be established &quot;out of band&quot;\n&gt;       before the client and server can share information. In other\n&gt;       words, these are long-lived, static dependencies that are NOT\n&gt;       dynamically and ephemerally established in the course of a\n&gt;       sequence of request/replies between the client and server. I count\n&gt;       five fixed points required to access an observation interval using\n&gt;       the indirect method you describe:\n&gt;          1. the metric authority:http://foo.example/\n&gt;          2. the metric relative URL: metrics/232/\n&gt;          3. the JSON name/value pair for the URL template: observations_\n&gt;             in_interval_ href: &lt;template&gt;\n&gt;          4. the template variable name: start_time\n&gt;          5. the template variable name: stop_time\n\nI am not sure I would count 1 and 2 as separate.  I generally conceive \nof URLs as atomic entities.  Other than that it looks about right.\n\n\n&gt;    4. Direct use of an observation interval template alone has only four\n&gt;       fixed points:\n&gt;          1. the observation authority: http://foo.example/\n&gt;          2. the observations relative URL: /metrics/232/ observations?\n&gt;          3. the URL argument name: start\n&gt;          4. The URL argument name: end\n&gt;    5. Given that your approach has more fixed point dependencies than a\n&gt;       simple direct use of a URL, can you explain what dependencies you\n&gt;       were trying to eliminate and why? For example, is observations_\n&gt;       in_interval_ href less likely to change than /metrics/232/\n&gt;       observations? Is start_time less likely to change than start?\n\nThe main thing we were trying to achieve is to allow the server a great \ndeal of freedom in the disposition of resources.  For example, if a \nserver becomes overloaded we need the freedom to relocate the \nobservations for any metrics we choose.  While we can, and do, continue \nto support obsolesce URLs via redirection, having the original location \nof the resource forced to handle the initial requests and redirection is \nless optimal than just having agents go to the right place in the first \nplace.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As I wrote this up, it dawned on me that establishing the use of \n&gt; server-generated ephemeral URLs in returned representations as a good \n&gt; practice is effectively contradicting the cool URL good practice. The \n&gt; former seeks to minimize the number of cool (long lived) URLs and the \n&gt; latter practice seeks to maximize them. Put another way, proponents of \n&gt; server-generated ephemeral URLs appear to believe that long-lived URLs \n&gt; are not cool because they create long-lived dependencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; So which is the better design -- a hypermedia application rich in long \n&gt; lived URLs or a hypermedia application poor in long lived URLs, just a \n&gt; few &quot;bootstrap&quot; URLs? Up til now I always assumed the former, but now \n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure. Again this reminds me a bit of the deep-linking debate, \n&gt; eg a building with many doors vs a building with few doors.\n\nI tend to prefer having as few long lived URLs as possible.  Each long \nlived URL represents an additional maintenance burden for the system \nover time.   In my experience, however, it turns out that most URLs in a \nsystem do need to be long lived.  It is probably easier and safer to \njust assume that all the URLs in a system will have to be supported for \na very long time.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://pezra.barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
