It is not clear.\nThe context of this discussio is cache\ninvalidation.  The notion is that the cache\ncontains some set of resources and we want the\ncache to request only the documents which have\nchanged.  Is there another application for this or\ndo we think this particular application is\nsufficiently common to warrant special spec.\nfeatures?\n\n&gt; When subscribing to a container, there are two possible kinds of\n&gt; notification of interest:  changes to the contents of the\n&gt; container (i.e., what is in it) --- potentially recursively ---\n&gt; and changes *in* the contents of the container (i.e., changes to\n&gt; the things in it) --- again potentially recursively.\n\nSo a client can subscribe either to pages\ngenerated with this:\n\n(1)    find -newer lastcheck htdocs -print0\n\nor pages generated with this:\n\n(2)    find -newer lastcheck htdocs -exec cat;\n\n\n&gt; So we need two\n&gt; mechanisms:  a notification-time specifier that indicates which\n&gt; resource has changed, and a subscription-time specifier that\n&gt; indicates the &quot;depth&quot; of the subscription.\n\nWhether the cache wants (1) or (2) depends on\nwhether the it can update itself using sub-file\nlevel diffs.\n\nBut, I am not seeing why this stuff isn&#39;t already\ncovered in the existing notification spec?\n\nWhy do need need a special protocol for\ncontainers, when I can define resources that\ncorrespond to arbitrary container semantics and\nsubscribe to them?\n\nI think the issue here is really specifying a\ncommon use case for diff and is irrelevant to\nwhether the resource is a container or not.\n(I am with Mark here; the notion of container is\nsort of meaningless in HTTP)\n\n\nOn Fri, 1 Feb 2002, Jeff Bone wrote:\n&gt; NOTIFICATION SPECIFIER\n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; This one&#39;s easy.  A container which generates notifications\n&gt; SHOULD include a header &quot;Changed-URI&quot; that gives the full URI for\n&gt; the resource which has changed, generating this event.  The\n&gt; Changed-URI MAY be a different URI than the Subscribed-URI /\n&gt; Watched-URI associated with the subscription.  A Changed-URI in a\n&gt; notification SHOULD (?) be a sub-URI of the Subscribed-URI, i.e.,\n&gt; a URI that has as a leading substring the full Subscribed-URI.\n\nThis just seems like a special case of where to\nretrieve the diff.\n\n\n&gt; SUBSCRIPTION SPECIFIER\n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; This one is tricky.  At a first pass, it might be acceptable to\n&gt; simply allow two kinds of container subscriptions:  subscriptions\n&gt; to change notifications when the top-level contents of the\n&gt; container change, and subscriptions to changes to the top-level\n&gt; contents or to any of the contained objects, recursively.  I.e.,\n&gt; a &quot;recursive&quot; boolean.  There are perhaps two ways to do this.\n\nI think there are more.  Look at all the options\nto the unix &#39;find&#39; command.\n* last modified\n* last accessed\n* last created\n* depth\n* file patter (e.g. only .html)\n* file owner/group\n\nThis seems like a minefield.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
