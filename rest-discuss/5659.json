Encouraged by the\nquality of the feed-back since the first public release, I am  happy to\nannounce the release of version 1.0 beta 1. The project is now entering a\nphase of code stabilization, bug fixing and minor enhancements. A final\nversion 1.0 ready for production is scheduled for Q2 2006. Here is a summary\nof the changes since 0.19 beta:\n \n - Noelios Restlet Engine is now automatically registered with the Restlet\nAPI if no other implementation is specified. A flexible registration\nmechanism was also added based on a system property naming a factory class.\nAlso, many factory methods were added to the Manager class helping the\ndecoupling of your applications from a particular implementation.\n \n - The Restlet API was simplified in many ways. First, the RestletCall\ninterface has been absorbed by the UniformCall. As a result, Maplets,\nChainlets and Restlet containers can now delegate directly to any handler\nimplementing the UniformInterface, not just Restlets. In addition, a\n&quot;redirectRef&quot; property was added, removing the old way of passing the URI in\nthe call output. For consistency purpose, the getPaths, getPath and\ngetMatches methods were renamed to getResourcePaths, getResourcePath and\ngetResourceMatches. Then, the client preferences were refactored into a\nPreferenceData interface accessible via the &quot;preference&quot; property. Finally,\nRestletException was removed and existing JDK exceptions are used instead. \n  \n - The support for cookies was completed. Custom readers and writers were\nimplemented allowing a homogeneous behavior across all connectors (HTTP\nclient and servers). Also, the Cookies interface was replaced by\nList&lt;Cookie&gt; and lazy parsing was implemented to prevent unnecessary parsing\nand list creations when cookies are not actually used.\n \n - The connectors were refactored, especially the HTTP client and servers.\nThe Connector interface now implements UniformInterface and shortcut methods\n(get, post, put and delete) were added to the Client interface. Also, thanks\nto some remarks from Benjamin Carlyle, I decided to provide a set of HTTP\ncall interfaces allowing direct interaction with HTTP connectors and access\nto low-level artifacts like HTTP headers. The new HttpCall also has a static\nlist of all HTTP statuses and header names. Finally, JavaMailCall and\nJdbcCall were replaced by factory methods on their respective connector\nclass.\n \n - The default HTTP client connector was significantly enhanced to support\ncookies, conditions, preferences, output representation metadata,\nredirection reference, server name and basic HTTP authentication.\n \n - The Jetty connectors were refactored to prevent logic duplication and to\nsupport multiple listener types (HTTP, HTTPS and AJP). Also, the Jetty 6\nconnector was updated to version 6.0 beta 7. Finally, the HttpServer\ninterface now as a standard method to configure HTTPS/SSL. \n \n - Support for media type encoding modifiers was added to\nRepresentationMetadata, allowing pre-compressed files and dynamic\ncompression of any representation. The support for encoding file extensions\nand default encoding setting is already available in the DirectoryRestlet.\nThanks to John D. Mitchell for the suggestions.\n \n - The tutorial and sample code were nicely simplified using the latest API\nchanges.\n \nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n \n--- \n \nProject home:\n &lt;http://www.restlet.org&gt; http://www.restlet.org\n \nDirect download link:\n &lt;http://www.restlet.org/downloads/restlet-1.0b1.zip&gt;\nhttp://www.restlet.org/downloads/restlet-1.0b1.zip\n \nFor further change details, see the change log:\n &lt;http://www.restlet.org/docs/changes&gt; http://www.restlet.org/docs/changes\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0029_01C62299.0A501940\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.2802&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D406574415-26012006&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;H&lt;SP=\r\nAN \nclass=3D406574415-26012006&gt;i all,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D406574415-26012006&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The \nRestlet =\r\nproject has reached an important milestone.
