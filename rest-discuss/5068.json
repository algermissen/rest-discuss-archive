You will probably still\n &gt; lose the battle, but it beats arguing religion hands down.\n\nYou were right. I&#39;m covered in bubbles, and it ain&#39;t pretty.\n\nSo what did I learn? (This is probably not news to anyone on \nrest-discuss, and I&#39;m feeling slightly cynical at this point in time.)\n\n1. Some developers do not understand HTTP, URIs or the concept of \nresources, but they understand function calls.\n\n2. Some developers do not understand XML, and do not want to learn it. \nTherefore expecting them to use a REST style and XML resources for \nservices is futile.\n\n3. When using SOAP some developers initially expect to not have to \nunderstand the details, and they will do their best to avoid \nunderstanding XML, SOAP, XSD, WSDL, etc. But, sooner or later they are \ngoing to have to understand the XML that is moving across the wire and \nunderstand how to get their SOAP toolkit to produce the required interface.\n\n4. Unless someone has the authority to impose a particular architectural \nstyle the developers will use the development tools that promise to make \ntheir life easier and which will look good on their resume.\n\nAh well...\n\nAndrew\n\n"}}
