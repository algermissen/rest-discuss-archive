You won&#39;t find a constraint about &quot;nouns&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n anywhere in my dissertation.  It talks about resources, as in\n&gt; *re*source=\r\ns, because that is what we want from a distributed\n&gt; hypermedia system (the=\r\n ability to reuse those information sources\n&gt; through the provision of link=\r\ns). ...  The really interesting\n&gt; services provide many resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note=\r\n that this is just another way of restating Reed&#39;s law in\n&gt; relation to Met=\r\ncalfe&#39;s law.\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law\n\nSimilarly, L=\r\nayer Stripper Bill de Hora recently flirted in this way:\n\n&quot;Some people when=\r\n faced when a distributed programming problem, think\n&#39;I know, I&#39;ll expose a=\r\n new service interface.&#39;\n\nNow they have n-squared problems.&quot;\n\n&lt;http://www.d=\r\nehora.net/journal/2006/03/now_they_have_nsquared_problems.html&gt;\n\nView Sourc=\r\nerer Joe Gregario almost in passing shined a light on some\ncobwebs (caching=\r\n and authentication):\n\n&quot;In the process of implementing httplib2 I also disc=\r\novered some rough\nspots in HTTP implementations.&quot;\n\n&lt;http://www.xml.com/pub/=\r\na/2006/03/29/httplib2-http-persistence-and-authentication.html&gt;\n\nPutting th=\r\nese together and handwaving as usual...\n\nIt strikes me that the first two s=\r\ntatements are all about changing the\nframe and making economic arguments fo=\r\nr REST, namely constraining\nsystem design to resources, identifiers and uni=\r\nform interfaces in\norder to lower coordination costs... ergo the web style =\r\nas an enabler\nof Reed&#39;s Law.\n\nI hadn&#39;t seen such explicit harkening to Metc=\r\nalfe and Reed in the past\neven though there&#39;s has always been this notion o=\r\nf REST as\nincorporating end-to-end principles. I too have argued in this ve=\r\nin\nabout a complexity and integration argument for REST.\n\nIn a similar thre=\r\nad Benjamin Carlyle put it thusly &quot;Uniformity is key.\nSimplicity at the net=\r\nwork level is key. Managing state transparently\nas resources is important f=\r\nor its own reasons&quot;\n\nIntuitively, the argument about applying architectural=\r\n constraints to\nget payoffs in terms of leverage has a lot of appeal to eng=\r\nineers. It\nseems however that we need some economists to weigh in here with=\r\n some\noptions pricing theory or other to give more heft to these arguments.=\r\n\nOften, decisions about software systems are not made by engineers but\nrath=\r\ner by financiers and it helps to speak their language.\n\nInstead of Reed&#39;s n=\r\notion of group forming, it seems the argument by\nanalogy for REST is about =\r\napplication integration and the barriers\nthat obtain in that sphere.\n\nNow I=\r\n like the large numbers that we can throw out in these\nreformulations. The =\r\nthing is that Andrew Odlyzko says that both\nMetcalfe and Reed&#39;s law are bun=\r\nk despite their evident appeal and\nability to dazzle venture capitalists.\n\n=\r\n&lt;http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf&gt;\n\nIn that paper he sets o=\r\nut to get quantitative measurements and hard\ndata and puts the value of com=\r\nmunication networks at nlog(n) which is\nnothing to sneeze at, better than S=\r\narnoff&#39;s linearity but far less\nthan Metcalfe and Reed&#39;s estimates. Now Odl=\r\nyzko was measuring the\nutility of the internet which encompasses more than =\r\nthe web and you\ncan argue following Sam Ruby that the email and peer-to-pee=\r\nr styles,\nwhether expressed as, Bittorrent, Skype or usenet, are the true\nw=\r\ninners in his numbers... Also you could argue with his methodology\nand I ha=\r\nve my own quibbles, but it&#39;s a brave man who takes on\nOdlyzko... Thus I&#39;ll =\r\ntake his numbers in my handwaving, acknowledging\nafter all that the web was=\r\n the key enabler and popularizer of the\ninternet.\n\nThis gets me to the thir=\r\nd quote from Joe, namely the perennial rough\nspots and implementation quirk=\r\ns that are our daily bread as engineers\ntrying to design and produce system=\r\ns for the web.\n\nWe see daily abuse of HTTP and there are annoying glitches =\r\nwith the\nlibraries and implementations that exist and also with what is\ndep=\r\nloyed in the real world. Perhaps this is because REST is the web\nstyle rath=\r\ner than the programming model and consequently enforces very\nfew presciptio=\r\nns.\n\nNow it seems to me that this is about the place where theory meets\npra=\r\nctice and we get into the realm of pragmatism and leverage. In the\nwild we =\r\nsee\n\n- the difficulties of interoperation\n- differing interpretations of sp=\r\necifications if indeed specs are read\n- backward compatibility constraints =\r\ne.g. for leverage and adoption,\nHTTP 1.1 had to accomodate some of the pitf=\r\nalls in HTTP 1.0\n- difficulties in authoring structured data\n- configuratio=\r\nn and deployment issues (mime types, content negotiation etc)\n- competition=\r\n with other styles, the web style exists in a marketplace\nof architectures\n=\r\n- vested interests and economic models e.g. limits imposed by shared\nhostin=\r\ng providers, assymetry of some broadband networks etc\n\nWith this in mind, I=\r\n wonder if I can come up with a stab towards\nKoranteng&#39;s postulates on coor=\r\ndination costs\n\n1. there is a natural dampening factor in the utility of di=\r\nstributed computing\n\nWe can use Odlyzko&#39;s numbers as the lower bound in pra=\r\nctice of network\neffects and Reed&#39;s law as the theoretical limit (with Metc=\r\nalfe being a\ngreat popularizer).\n\nI happen to be reading Graham Green&#39;s The=\r\n Human Factor and, looking\nthrough some of the issues that hinder adoption,=\r\n many of them could be\nsummarized as comprehension or human variability hen=\r\nce I&#39;ll\ncharacterize the issue as the human factor. All that is left is to\n=\r\naugment with some Black-Scholes options thinking and finacial\nderivatives t=\r\no package to CEOs\n\n2. the human factor in technology adoption is sizable an=\r\nd its effect\ncan be measured. Moreover I would argue that it should be reco=\r\ngnized\nas an explicit architectural constraint in the design on software\nsy=\r\nstems.\n\n3. In the realm of distributed computing, this human factor is boun=\r\nded\nby Odlyzko&#39;s limit and Reed&#39;s law.\n\nMathematicians can derive the corre=\r\nct coefficient for me... 1 / n log(n) ?\n\nThe rest as they say is advocacy a=\r\nnd implementation details...\n\nWe are operating with imperfect specification=\r\ns, imperfect frameworks\nand imperfect implementations. REST as laissez fair=\r\ne distributed\ncomputing doesn&#39;t acknowledge these costs as architectural co=\r\nnstraints\nbut rather seems to go about it by encouraging best practices and=\r\n\nhoping that by existence proof, people will come to it... If you look\nat t=\r\nhe high level requirements that have been articulated\n\n- Simple protocols f=\r\nor authoring and data transfer\n- textual formats for protocol and some exch=\r\nanged hypermedia\n- Sensitive to user-perceived latency\n- Mark Baker&#39;s talk =\r\nabout &quot;principled sloppiness&quot; (i.e. &quot;must-ignore\nstyle extensibility&quot;)...\n\n=\r\nWe don&#39;t tend to enforce much of these things in protocol. I wonder\nwhat ot=\r\nher best practices can lower coordination costs and if they can\nbe encoded =\r\nin protocol to remove the human factor...\n\nAnyway food for thought...\n\nIf a=\r\nnything this enables me to add Reed&#39;s insight to my growing\ntaxonomy of the=\r\n web style which some in this list may have come\nacross.. namely\n\nthere&#39;s a=\r\n tag: REST\n\nthere&#39;s a slogan: the web style\n\nthere&#39;s a Holy Book: Architect=\r\nural Styles and the Design of\nNetwork-based Software Architectures\n\nthere&#39;s=\r\n a Reverend: HTTP\n\nthere&#39;s a choir: the HUHXtable quartet (HTTP, URI, HTML,=\r\n XML)\n\nthere are Four Horsemen: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\n\nthere are prophets:=\r\n (you know who you are)\n\nthere are pillars: Resource Modeling, Idempotency =\r\netc\n\nthere are priests and tax collectors: the caching and other\nintermedia=\r\nries. Ergo &quot;Render unto Ceasar that which is Ceasar&#39;s&quot;\nrecast as the notion=\r\n of &quot;giving visibility to intermediaries&quot;.\n\nthere are angels and demons: a =\r\nband of Apaches and various HTTP\nlibraries which are alternately sources of=\r\n delight and exasperation\n\nthere&#39;s a Messiah: the browser (which comes with=\r\n various pretenders,\nFirefoxes, Great Explorer&#39;s, Viking Operas and Fruity =\r\nSafaris)\n\nthere are red herrings: url opacity etc\n\nthere are false gods: WS=\r\n-*, crusty old architectures of appropriation etc.\n\nthere&#39;s the wilderness =\r\nand prodigal children: WebDAV?\n\nthere&#39;s immaculate conception: the virtuous=\r\n XML\n\nthere are worldly travellers: the three mobile kings JavaScript, Java=\r\n\nApplet, ActiveX (some discredited)\n\nthere are scrappy offspring: Atom, RSS=\r\n and Atompub\n\nthere are gruesome Philistines: implementation details such a=\r\ns\nStructured Data, Character Encoding, Security\n\nthere are elevator pitches=\r\n, Cliff&#39;s notes and ballads: Sir Tim&#39;s\nlullaby of Web Architecture 101 is q=\r\nuite reasonable\n\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/1110-iswc-tbl/#(4)&gt;\n\nthere&#39;s=\r\n myrrh and frankincense: the web as conversation\n\nand now there&#39;s the promi=\r\nsed land: Reed&#39;s Law as the land milk and honey\n\nParting digression: I noti=\r\nced last year that Roy produced a white\npaper about JSR 170 (Java Content R=\r\nepository) for his day job (pun\nintended) applying principled constraints t=\r\no the modeling of content\nrepositories.\n\n&lt;http://www.day.com/etc/medialib/d=\r\nay_download_documents/white_papers.Par.0001.File.tmp/JSR_170_White_Paper.pd=\r\nf&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve been curious about the surprising inertia behind that\nspecificatio=\r\nn having played with IBM implementations in the past few\nyears. Perhaps tho=\r\nugh the immaturity of that space is a tribute to\nsome of these arguments ab=\r\nout coordination costs applied to the\nmarketplace of data (relational, obje=\r\nct relational, XML, SQL, XPath,\nXQuery, ActiveRecord, ODMA, Spring, Hiberna=\r\nte, SDO etc).\n\nI wonder if the Atom store dream is the way to go, namely ra=\r\nther than\napply the constraint of an api and a language, Java, in a world i=\r\nn\nwhich we have a Tower of Babel of languages and persistence\nframeworks, i=\r\nt makes  more sense to focus on wire protocol (as in Atom\nPublishing protoc=\r\nol) and wire format say Atom. In other words the\ngreater payoff would be no=\r\nt in establishing a programming model (the\nJCR) but rather in moving to Ato=\r\nmpub which is agnostic on the\nunderlying programming model and lowers the c=\r\noordination costs by\nstripping a layer of comprehension from the mix. All t=\r\nhis of course is\nmodulo the quirks of compound documents, media collections=\r\n etc...\n\nAnyway having written this much, it&#39;s probably worth blogging at s=\r\nome point...\n\nComments welcome...\n\n--\nKoranteng\n--\nKoranteng&#39;s Toli  - http=\r\n://koranteng.blogspot.com/\n\n"}}
