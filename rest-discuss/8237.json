That&#39;s one of the\n&gt;&gt; primary REST constraints in HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not quite; that treads close to implementation dependence. GET safety is \n&gt; about accountability. You can&#39;t stop server owners doing stupid things \n&gt; in their implementations, but you can assume it won&#39;t be your fault when \n&gt; they do.\n\nIn my own awkward way, that&#39;s part of what I was trying to say. The kind of\nside-effects I was thinking of as OK would be things like logging requests:\nit&#39;s a side effect, but it&#39;s not externally visible and if the server\nstopped doing it, the client would know none the better.\n\nK.\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
