It does not\n&gt; impose restrictions whether you must do a GET or POST or whatever method.\n&gt; All it knows is just a bunch or URIs with associated methods, and some\n&gt; semantics.\n\nAh, but the problem is that the semantics -- and benefits that the\ninfrastructure can provide -- caching, transformation, standardized\nheaders and response codes, &c. -- come specifically from /constraining/\nthe operations that can be performed.\n\n\n&gt; In that view REST is also SHARE. And even SOAP Web Services are also\n&gt; SHARE. Well I guess I&#39;m trying to confuse things :-P\n\nWell, since I&#39;m saying &quot;SHARE&quot; is what the service providers are doing\nthat is specifically _not_ their SOAP interface, it&#39;s hard to argue that\nSOAP is SHARE. :)\n\nThe line you&#39;re trying to draw is the architecture/implementation line,\nI think.  As in, one can express either an RPC or REST [or\nmessage-passing or ...] architecture via a particular technology like\nHTTP or SOAP or RMI.  But SHARE isn&#39;t either an architectural style or a\nspecific implementation-description, so much as a description of the\nclass of RPC interfaces which are trying to use HTTP in a very simple\nmanner.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; My argument is that -- from what we&#39;ve seen so far -- either GET _or_\n&gt; &gt; POST is being used.  HEAD doesn&#39;t really seem to be used by any of these\n&gt; &gt; services.\n&gt; Yeah... true... Nobody uses HEAD in web scripts. Actually almost everyone\n&gt; ignores the HTTP request method used.\n\nThat&#39;s more general than what I said.  HEAD is used by many services\nacross the wider internet.  It&#39;s not _commonly_ used in day-to-day\nweb-browsing, but that doens&#39;t mean it&#39;s not used.\n\nAnd I consider the fact that some web-app frameworks seem to go out of\ntheir way to ignore HTTP methods a bug... :)\n\n\n&gt; That leads me to some problem..... what&#39;s the name of this &quot;thing&quot;?\n[deletia]\n&gt; As I use it to develop Gado-gado, I might use something like Gado-gado\n&gt; Service Description or whatever... but I don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s not\n&gt; Gado-gado specific.\n&gt; \n&gt; And in that sense I want this &quot;thing&quot; to have a class... I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; use &quot;Web Services&quot; since it&#39;s related tightly with SOAP and XML, and my\n&gt; Web Service isn&#39;t SOAP, it isn&#39;t XML, it is actually REST without strict\n&gt; REST semantics and it&#39;s more SHARE but I can&#39;t use the SHARE name. And\n&gt; even so I can&#39;t say &quot;this is a SHARE-like service&quot; since nobody knows what\n&gt; SHARE is...?\n\nThat&#39;s all true, especially the last part. :)\n\nYou could recognize that no matter how much I _want_ people to not label\nthese APIs REST, they will probably continue to do so, and do the same\nyourself at least for consistency and understandability.\n\nYou could just not give it a name, and say &quot;here&#39;s the API...&quot;\n\nIf you do want to come up with a name, I suggest makeing it short,\npronounceable and relatively general.  Recursonyms are worth extra\npoints. If you don&#39;t want a strong association to Gado-gado, then I\nwould recommend not making that part of the name, as well as staying\naway from using &#39;G&#39; [or 2 of them, next to each other] to prevent\nconfusion in the name.  That all assumes an acronym, of course ... you\ncould pick an existing word that&#39;s particularly descriptive of the\nnature of the design...\n\nBut, yeah, there is a call for what you want; it&#39;s getting increasingly\nloud, too.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
