(i.e. in a forum =\r\napp, we have &quot;Forum&quot; resource,\n&quot;Thread&quot; resource & &quot;User&quot; resource)\n\nResour=\r\nce looks quite object-oriented, will it be efficient to just use\nobject-ori=\r\nented techniques & tools (i.e. UML) in order to figure out\nall needed resou=\r\nrces for each app?\n\nHow are we going to describe these resources to allow f=\r\nurther\ndiscussion between community? What we need to describe? (resource&#39;s\n=\r\ncharacteristic, relationship between resources, version of resource?)\nWhat =\r\nwe use to describe, and how? (RDF, WSDL, TopicMap? and agree with\na standar=\r\nd describing convention?).\n\n\n2) Figure out basic needs to build ReSTful app=\r\ns\n\nWhich part of codes that we repeat in every restful web app? (URL\nMapper=\r\n, Resource Manager, HTTP Authentication, HTTP Cache, URL\nParser?)\n\nBuild (o=\r\nr reuse any?) a API library to handle HTTP (Cache,\nAuthentication, ConNeg, =\r\nURL Parser, Request & Response etc)?\n\nAnalyze and list out what essential t=\r\nhings needed in a ReSTful\napplication framework, next build frameworks for =\r\ndifferent platforms\n(or reuse current frameworks?)\n\n\n3) Start to build and =\r\nrun ReSTful apps in Web\n\nWill it be nice to start with building some killer=\r\n web apps, to allow\nourselves to experience & understand what&#39;s the real be=\r\nnefits of\nadopting ReST? to figure out what we missed and things to fix in =\r\n(1)\nand (2).\n\nIs it possible to see an app as a collection of resources rat=\r\nher than\na whole? And we can always remove them or reassemble them to custo=\r\nmize\nour app.\n\n\n4) Is this a right direction to start?\n\nIf yes, where to st=\r\nart, when to start, who will join?\nIf no, any suggestions? :-)\n\nIt&#39;s just a=\r\n *utopia*, and I think it has been re-appearing in ppl&#39;s\ndreams long before=\r\n CORBA, RMI, and ReST... and it will keeps repeating\nin future. A dream of =\r\nno barrier in communications (the babel tower?)\n\nCheers, :-)\n\n--\n-toydi-\n\n"}}
