I personally don&#39;t see anything wrong with that but If\nyou really don&#39;t want something like this happening, then you can ask\nthe client to send the hash or something of the resource it wants to\ndelete. Or maybe the pop could be done via a POST instead of DELETE.\nMy orignal point was that making the DELETE on the element instead of\n&#39;top&#39; would break the semantics with which a stack is thought up and\nused. whatever you do with the stack has to be via the TOP and not\nthrough the individual resource.\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n\n&gt; Or each GET is a different element and somehow the DELETE is\n&gt; correlated to that GET. Where is that state conveyed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Assaf\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Delete the TOP just does that .. delete the current top. How does it\n&gt;&gt; matter if after that another element becomes the top?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, there might be arguments against what I just said , but the\n&gt;&gt; increase in coupling caused by any other solution imho makes for an\n&gt;&gt; overwhelming choice for this option.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In short, I like the OPs solution.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards\n&gt;&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
