Mike Dierken [mailto:mdierken@...]\n\n&gt; A network effect occurs when many participate in a limited arena -\neverybody\n&gt; uses TCP/IP, rather than netbios, netbui, banyan, etc. By having many\nverbs,\n&gt; there is no limited arena - no network effect.\n\nIt is probably better to say that it is commonality that creates network\neffects as opposed to limitations, though limitation can have the\nside-effect of creating de facto commonality.\n\nRegardless, I think we&#39;re talking different verbs.  I am not talking about\nadding more &quot;verbs&quot; to HTTP&#39;s GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, though there can be\njustifiable reasons for doing that.  I&#39;m talking about not getting hung up\non what can be a resource.  I see no reason why a resource can&#39;t represent\nan action as oppose to data.\n\n&gt; Its an object+method approach rather than a function-only approach, and\nthe\n&gt; object+method are separately identifiable. If you don&#39;t separate\n&gt; object+method, you get object1.invoke(), object2.invoke(), etc. It is a\n&gt; /workable/ system, but with the slight change to object.method1(),\n&gt; object.method2(), you get more benefit - but the benefit drops off if you\n&gt; have object.method99(), object.mymethod99(), etc.\n\nI am actually not encouraging one programming approach over the other.  As\nyou said, there are trade-offs.  I am merely saying that there isn&#39;t a good\nreason to unilaterally discourage making functions URI-accessible.  In OOP,\nthere are times when you want to pass a function as parameter.  If URIs can\npoint to actions, there are interesting applications that can be built on\ntop of these URIs.\n\n&gt; This is unclear to me - what is different between &#39;access&#39; and &#39;action&#39;?\nThe\n&gt; internal implementation of the interface can have any number of custom\n&gt; actions - but the public contract and observed behavior is a\ncommon/standard\n&gt; one. Exposing internal action names and assumptions is not necessary and\n&gt; fragments the total space of addressable things.\n\nOne way to view the current basic HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) is\nas basic addressing mechanisms that are not much different than core OOP\nobject get, deletes, assign.  That is what I mean by access.  Actions would\nbe something like a car.drive() method invocation.\n\nWhy do you think exposing action names would fragment the total space of\naddressable things?  It is just another resource to be accessed using the\nsame set of public contract methods.\n\n&gt; The fundamental shift of thinking &#39;Web&#39; is that we aren&#39;t asking Google to\n&gt; do a search - I bet you it&#39;s cached with some form of consistent hashing\nand\n&gt; they /don&#39;t/ actually search anyway. What we are asking for are the\n&gt; /results/ - and those results are just plain data blobs. You can think of\nit\n&gt; as &#39;do search&#39; - but that doesn&#39;t apply to all other systems, whereas the\n&gt; &#39;get results&#39; /will/ apply to all other systems. The Google search URI\n&gt; points to the results, not the query engine.\n\nThere is no question some searches are cached, but surely you are not\nsuggesting that all possible queries to Google are precached? 8-)  Whether\nGoogle is doing a real search action may be debatable, but there is no doubt\nthat there is a need for action invocation in certain types of applications.\nHow would you advise that we think &#39;Web&#39; on a post that purchases a stock?\nIs the URI pointing to a purchase result?  That would be a rather awkward\nway to look at it, don&#39;t you think?\n\nIf we insist that thinking &#39;Web&#39; means we never think in terms of invoking\nactions, then we are severely limiting the potential of the web, and we\nforce people to go &quot;outside of the web&quot; to write applications that are\ntransaction oriented.\n\nLet&#39;s not forget that &quot;the web&quot; is only one application on the internet.\nSOAP does not need the web to be successful or to benefit from &quot;network\neffect&quot;.  The web may have fueled the build-out of the internet, but it\nisn&#39;t guaranteed to remain the dominant application that runs over the roads\nit helped build.  The web needs to evolve to support the needs of the user\ncommunity or they will turn to other means to accomplish what they need.\n\nI see problems with SOAP, but I also see that REST lacks clear guidelines\nand support for transactional applications and I sense many people\nstruggling to write these types of applications in a RESTful way.  The\nchallenge is to provide a clear programming model and tools for developers\nas opposed to listing ways in which applications are not be RESTful or\nviolate web principles.\n\n//Joe\n\n\n\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
