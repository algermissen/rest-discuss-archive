scripts to the filtering w/o the need to call back to the server.  in\n&gt; this case the lists were quite static (product-related filters) and\n&gt; relatively small (tens of items in each list, not hundreds).\n\nyes, for small pick lists, including the allowable values is an option \nand is a good option to avoid additional requests.\n\n&gt; caching\n&gt; makes composing and shipping this representation to the clients\n&gt; relatively inexpensive (after the first delivery to a client).\n\nthe problem is that dependent lists can get huge; imagine the scenario i \nused which, when fully expanded, lists all cities in all countries \nworld-wide. clearly, that&#39;s not something you want to ship to the \nclient, so there needs to be some iterative process. you could probably \nsay that this is very similar to faceted navigation, only that the \nprocess in this case is driven by form fields, and not by search-based \ninteractions. we have tons of scenarios where we must have value-assist \nas a service, because these things also can be computed by server-side \nlogic, so they don&#39;t even exist without input parameters provided by the \nclient.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
