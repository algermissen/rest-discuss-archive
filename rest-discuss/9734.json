I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to do this:\n\n  DELETE  /subjects/5/activities/18\n\nWhat I was looking for was a way of specifying the association without having to update the activity 18 resource itself.\n\nPractically I&#39;d like to be able to do this in a restful way without having to first load the activity 18 resource just to save all the same data back.\n\nIf I treat the association itself as a resource I could do something like this:\n\n  POST /subject_activity_association\n\nand in the body specify subject 5 and activity 18 (with ids or urls).\n\nI don&#39;t like this much unless I am also storing other information in this association resource -- perhaps a strength-factor for the association or a user_id to keep track of who created the association.\n\nWhen making an association between two resources where the relationship is many-to-many a common implementation might be to just use a join table with each row holding just two values: the ids of the two related resources. At least with this implementation the association doesn&#39;t really have much of an independent existence.\n\nBrainstorming ...\n\nPerhaps if separate association declarations from the join table implementation and treat them as a separate resource ... ?\n\nIn this case if I started from scratch and created 3 activities and 3 subjects and didn&#39;t create any associations between these two types of resources I might also need to create association declaration resources with the following values:\n\n activity subject associated\n------------------------------\n  1        1       false\n  2        1       false\n  3        1       false\n  2        2       false\n  3        2       false\n  3        3       false\n\nIn this implementation there is always a resource that relates any activity to any subject and it&#39;s value is true or false. In this model there would be no meaning to a POST or DELETE to one of these resources, they would be creaqted and destroyed as a dependent action on the creation and destruction of the resources they relate.\n\nThis implies that Restfully the only operations would be GET and PUT.\n\n"}}
