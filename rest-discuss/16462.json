It is not OK to advise\nagainst self-descriptive messaging, it only causes confusion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike was spot on with his comments. Why not simply leave it at that\n&gt; and try not to have the last word?ï»¿?\n&gt; \n\nBecause I&#39;m right; why should I let the last word call my position\n&quot;dubious&quot;?  Get real.  In the context of the feedback sought, the Web,\nit is absolutely vital to point this out, because self-descriptive\nmessaging isn&#39;t an optional constraint:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6569\n\nIn that context, the custom media type solution _violates_ REST because\nit is _not_ self-descriptive.  Why should I back down, when it&#39;s\nfundamentally correct, yet taboo to the point of being flamed into not\nposting, to point that out?\n\nREST is what it is, not what it isn&#39;t, and REST is not about sending\nopaque identifiers over the Internet with HTTP -- that is not at all\nwhat is meant by &quot;standard types&quot;.  Again quoting Roy:\n\n&quot;If we want to call one more RESTful than the other, then we have\nto take the goal of evolution into account. I would say it is more\nRESTful to use a specific standard type when applicable or to define\na new type that is specific to a given purpose AND intended to be\nstandardized for that application type (i.e., proprietary types are\nless RESTful than industry-wide standard types, but new standard\ntypes are not less RESTful than old standard types). But that is\nreally only my personal preference, since the style does not\nconstrain REST-based architectures to a single standard.&quot;\n\nWhy is there endless pushback against the notion that Roy&#39;s personal\npreferences regarding the instantiation of REST-the-style are reflected\nin HTTP and Web architecture?  Why is it confusing to the point of\ntelling me to shutup already, to insist that opaque identifiers aren&#39;t\nself-descriptive on the Web?  They aren&#39;t!  Making them incompatible\nwith REST on the Web.  Why can&#39;t that _fact_ be the last word?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
