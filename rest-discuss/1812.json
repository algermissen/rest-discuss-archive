Keeping the server from chewing\n&gt; up memory is a problem - I&#39;ve stopped running mine.\n\nDo you mean writing the javascript client from scratch or using the KN \nlibrary, Mike?\n\n&gt; Why is tunneling HTTP through HTTP a bad idea? If the resource is a queue of\n&gt; messages - and the representation of the message is mime type &quot;message/http&quot;\n&gt; , then that is exactly what you are /supposed/ to do. Right?\n\nAnytime I&#39;ve tried to work out the details things got messy.  I have yet \nto see a situation where message-in-message made sense.  It doesn&#39;t make \nsense because messages are about streams rather than resources.  \n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m thinking of Roy&#39;s dissertation, where he is very clear that there was\n&gt; &gt; an expected granularity of content, which is the granularity of hypertext.\n\n&gt; Hypertext on the web has no &#39;bounded object set&#39; - so the granularity is\n&gt; infinite. An individual message corresponds to about the size of a single\n&gt; portion of hypertext we normally call a document, so I don&#39;t see the\n&gt; problem.\n\nHm, I need to think about this.  Is my sense that hypertext is a different \nthing just a mental block?  There&#39;s a lot of blather about hypertext \nas a specific kind of content, but now I realize that I really don&#39;t \nknow what it means.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
