If a \nrepresenation has links to other resources, that represenation is \nasserting some sort of relationship between the resource it represents \nand another resource (whether semantically significant or a matter of a \nrepresentation&#39;s implementation). A client that knows what it is talking \nabout is in as much of a position to make such an assertion as anything \nelse.\n\nServer&#39;s can also say, &quot;this client knows what it is talking about, but \nI&#39;d phrase this bit differently, and I know better than it does on that \nbit&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
