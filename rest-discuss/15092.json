One =\r\narticle about the REST maturity levels, and one news item about REST securi=\r\nty. Oh my...\nI thought there was some mistake, that those two items belong =\r\nto the REST channel, and then I realized that there was no REST channel in =\r\nInfoQ!\n\nThen, I had a quick twitter chat with Ryan Sloboyan, Editor from In=\r\nfoQ. It seems, REST is seen just as a way to create services, opposite to S=\r\nOAP / WS-* lineage. Ryan told me there is always a possibility to create a =\r\nREST only channel, but he thinks that will be a narrow one, with not so man=\r\ny readers. The expectation is then REST readers will come just to learn how=\r\n to create easy services nos using SOAP.\n\nNow, Jack Vaughan from SearchSOA =\r\nwas in a fireside chat with me, at the Java Symposium from TheServerSide, w=\r\nhere I was to talk about REST apis, and their real meaning. He told me his =\r\nidea of REST was similar to that one of the new way of doing services for S=\r\nOA. We got a full room, and I asked if someone as ever read Roy&#39;s dissertat=\r\nion. None, and some with faces of &quot;who the hell is that Roy guy?&quot;. The ques=\r\ntion of how many thought REST was a new way of doing services yield to seve=\r\nral hands up. Also the one about REST as an HTTP driven RPC.\n\nSo, all in al=\r\nl, it seems the idea of REST as an Easy Services Creation technique is stro=\r\nng, even influenced in the InfoQ categorization of articles and news.\n\nI kn=\r\now some of you do post on InfoQ, and are even editors. \nWhat are your thoug=\r\nhts? Do you think it is good to keep that idea?\nDo you think that is actual=\r\nly the idea? \nWhat do you think of posting REST as an architectural style?\n=\r\n\nI want to hear your opinions, since I feel that would be an interesting di=\r\nscussion.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n\n"}}
