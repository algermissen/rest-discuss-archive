Fielding &lt;fielding@gbiv.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yes, we are all a cloud of atoms -- what&#39;s the point of distin=\r\nguishing\n&gt; us into types, shapes, or names?\n\nTo point out that people make =\r\nsemantic mistakes all the time, that\neverything is, indeed, miscellaneous, =\r\nand that that should be a place\nof collaboration rather than bickering. And=\r\n to point out that\nsemantics, albeit small and puny and carries great signi=\r\nficance, is\neasy to get wrong. People do it all the time, in technical term=\r\ns as in\nother walks of life.\n\n...\n\n&gt; No, that&#39;s not what middleware means (=\r\nit certainly isn&#39;t tied to OO).\n\nI said &quot;traditional middleware&quot;, as in wha=\r\ntever ilk sprung out of the\nenterprisey world, mostly. Yes, sure, that&#39;s no=\r\nt what middleware means\nfor the anal retentive, but I suspect that&#39;s what i=\r\nt means to Red Hat\net and enterprise developers throughout the world, a rat=\r\nher large\ngroup of people. And I was being a bit tounge-in-cheek assessing\n=\r\nstructures (resources, hierarchies, categories, tags, whatever) to\n*simulat=\r\ne* OO more than anything, and certainly wasn&#39;t saying\nmiddleware=3DOO. Shee=\r\nsh.\n\n...\n\n&gt;&gt; People whinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias. Um, c=\r\nomputer\n&gt;&gt; scientists have a bias too, even people who have no bias have a =\r\nbasic\n&gt;&gt; philosophical bias, and these semantics *will* affect (as oppose t=\r\no\n&gt;&gt; mere observatory notions) the work that is done. The argument of bias\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; is mostly moot (but not completely, of course). I personally get the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nfeeling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only\n&gt;&gt; b=\r\nusiness bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went\n&gt;&gt; with=\r\n it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and\n&gt;&gt; as such=\r\n I *really* welcome it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you welcome it if you went to a car deale=\r\nr, asked to see a\n&gt; new Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago =\r\ninstead?\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a\n=\r\n&gt; filet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?\n&gt;\n&gt; WTF is wr=\r\nong with you people?\n\nI think you&#39;re jumping your gun and seeing opposition=\r\n and weird shit\nwhere there isn&#39;t any, well, not in my camp, anyway. Let&#39;s =\r\nchange the\nallegory to fit better with my point; Would you welcome it if yo=\r\nu went\nshopping and realized you had bought the wrong kind of salami?\n\nEh, =\r\nscrew the allegories. All I was saying is that even if they are\nmisguided, =\r\nkicking them in the shin is no good way to convince them\notherwise. All you=\r\n&#39;re doing is creating enemies, and as much as we all\nhave our buckets of pa=\r\ntience with people grasping what REST is all\nabout filled up pretty high, d=\r\non&#39;t let it overflow.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you trademark REST and just be done with i=\r\nt? Should be easy\nto suss out any disputes if you really wanted to then? Yo=\r\nu know, just\nfor laughs? Linus did it, and so can you ...\n\n&gt; Red Hat (or, m=\r\nore accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set\n&gt; themselves up as the e=\r\nquivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards\n&gt; organization on a topic for =\r\nwhich they not only had NOTHING to\n&gt; do with creating and know NOTHING abou=\r\nt, but for which they\n&gt; actually sell products that are the exact opposite =\r\nof RESTful\n&gt; architecture.\n\nYeah, I think most people here is in agreement =\r\nwith that. It was a\nstupid move, especially without some anchoring with har=\r\ndcore REST\npeople or organisations. Or, you know, you.\n\n&gt;=A0The organizatio=\r\nn claims that it will specify REST\n&gt; standards, that such standards will be=\r\n led by benevolent dictators\n&gt; in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlappi=\r\nng proposals would be\n&gt; allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire t=\r\nopic as BDFL),\n&gt; and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the=\r\n board\n&gt; to ensure that never changed.\n\nBill has said they&#39;re open to chang=\r\ne it, and no matter how evil you\nthink RH is, anything has to start somewhe=\r\nre. Why not just see it as a\nhonest starting point? The truth will be flush=\r\ned out *extremely* quick\nif we all jumped on it and made it truly RESTful, =\r\nno? (Assuming fixing\nthe governing model, of course, which Bill says they a=\r\nre happy to do.\nI don&#39;t know these people, and can only take them at face v=\r\nalue)\n\n&gt; And, guess what -- the organization starts with a couple Spec Lead=\r\ns\n&gt; owning the topics that JBoss wants to SELL YOU as REST, because\n&gt; they =\r\nknow damn well that their current market is shrinking: their\n&gt; entire produ=\r\nct architecture is based on J2EE, the giant black\n&gt; hole of Java that is su=\r\ncking itself into oblivion.\n\nDoesn&#39;t a lot of innovation happen this way, t=\r\nhough? (And I&#39;m not\nstating their two specs are innovative; they&#39;re not)\n\n&gt;=\r\n But, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that\n&gt; is found i=\r\nn my dissertation. =A0This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,\n&gt; AssHat version o=\r\nf REST\n\nWell, yes, unless others get involved. They&#39;ve thrown out the\ninvit=\r\nation to us, too. Join it, and make sure it doesn&#39;t end up as\nAssHatMiddleW=\r\nare(TM) or something.\n\n&gt; Bill Burke is not evangelizing REST throughout the=\r\n Java world.\n&gt; What he is evangelizing is the same old architectures that h=\r\ne\n&gt; evangelized as J2EE and WS-* -- the only difference is that now\n&gt; he st=\r\narts off calling them REST. =A0All he is doing is making\n&gt; people like you =\r\nconfused over what is REST and what is not, in\n&gt; the hope of making a busin=\r\ness out of clambering onto yet\n&gt; another buzzword.\n\nPeople like me confused=\r\n about REST? I&#39;m a RESTafarian of over 5 years,\nso no, that&#39;s not it. I thi=\r\nnk you&#39;re mistaking my meeker approach to\nthis hubbub as an embracing their=\r\n ways. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just saying,\ndon&#39;t be a jerk even if you think they are=\r\n jerks. The RESTafarian\nmovement needs less jerking off, and more stability=\r\n and acceptance,\nespecially in the enterprise area (IMHO). If this could be=\r\n tweaked\ninto such a channel, then I&#39;m all for it.\n\n&gt; No, I see no reason t=\r\no appreciate that nonsense. =A0Not in the least.\n&gt; I don&#39;t care if it was a=\r\nn &quot;honest mistake&quot; or a deliberate attempt\n&gt; at fraud -- the result is the =\r\nsame. =A0Only a complete idiot would\n&gt; participate in such a forum.\n\nWell, =\r\nouch, and ouch, indeed. So &quot;honest mistake&quot; is unforgivable and\nunworkable =\r\nin your world?\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n-- \n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alc=\r\nhemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n--- http://shelter.nu/blog/ -----------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n------------------ http://www.google.co=\r\nm/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n\n"}}
