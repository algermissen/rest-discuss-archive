Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;&gt;Since Picture and Picture-Metadata are closely connected, I&#39;m tempted to\n&gt;&gt;see &quot;Picture&quot; as the resource, and &quot;binary&quot; and &quot;XML/RDF&quot; as two\n&gt;&gt;different representations. The problem with this approach is that I\n&gt;&gt;can&#39;t address representations of a resource, only a resource. What would\n&gt;&gt;you suggest?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How about using another aspect of REST - hypertext as the engine of\n&gt; application state - combined with content-negotiation in HTTP?\n&gt; \n&gt; Use a markup language to indicate the usage of the resource\n&gt; &lt;picture&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;http://my.foo.com/images/27&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;about href=&quot;http://my.foo.com/images/27&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And have the client application use a request header such as &quot;Accept:\n&gt; image/png&quot; for the &lt;img&gt; element. This assumes the client applications\n&gt; understands the schema.\n\nThanks for the suggestions, the content negotiation feature feels not \nright here, but if we could describe which representations are available \nfor a particular resource it would be more feasible.\nMaybe like this:\n\n&lt;picture about=&quot;http://my.foo.com/images/27&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;representation type=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;text/xml&lt;/representation&gt;\n  &lt;representation type=&quot;binary&quot;&gt;image/jpeg&lt;/representation&gt;\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\nHow does that sound?\n\n\nMy actual structure looks like this:\n\nMetadata: /picture/ID\nPicture: /picture/ID/binary\nList: /picture/index.rdf\n\nThe metadata for the picture would look like that (I omitted the \nnamespaces. RDF is just an example, it could also look like your XML \nfrom above.):\n&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;\n&lt;rdf:Description about=&quot;http://localhost/ws/picture/11091187245626/binary&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;s0:creator&gt;test&lt;/s0:creator&gt;\n   &lt;s0:type&gt;image&lt;/s0:type&gt;\n   &lt;s0:identifier&gt;http://localhost/ws/picture/11091187245626&lt;/s0:identifier&gt;\n   &lt;s0:format&gt;image/jpeg&lt;/s0:format&gt;\n   &lt;map:longitude&gt;16.3221&lt;/map:longitude&gt;\n   &lt;map:latitude&gt;48.199&lt;/map:latitude&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n\nAll picture relevant operations are carried out on the &lt;s0:identifier&gt; \nURI (like POST and DELETE).\n\nThe index.rdf looks similar, it just contains more than one \n&lt;rdf:Description&gt; element.\n\nThanks for the answers,\nMichael\n\n"}}
