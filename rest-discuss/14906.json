Wonder if Flickr is going to give you a call? :D \n\nOf a=\r\nll the types, the Type II you list gives me the hardest time accepting. You=\r\nr red box indicates that the client side is aware of the state ahead of tim=\r\ne, thus it fails the REST test. I don&#39;t quite get this tho. I understand th=\r\nat if I call a single URI, and it returns me with some dynamic list of link=\r\ns I can call based on the representation at that time.. that I can only use=\r\n those links. That should remain REST based correct?\n\nI don&#39;t understand wh=\r\ny, ahead of time a client might not know the possible outcomes. Let&#39;s say y=\r\nou call a get on /orders. It returns a list of orders. For each order you c=\r\nan call GET on it, PUT to update it, or DELETE. As well, you can call POST =\r\non /orders to create a new order. I am confused on why it is UN-RESTful if =\r\na client knows ahead of time that these are ALL the actions that can happen=\r\n at this point. By this I mean, let&#39;s say the GET /orders did NOT return a =\r\nURI to allow a user to create a new order. Ok..that&#39;s fine, the client wrap=\r\nper that says order.create() simply wont work. If I am a client wrapping a =\r\nRESTful api into an couple of classes to provide a java based api, so that =\r\nother client users can simply use my classes and not try to figure out REST=\r\n... I would check the URIs and if a user of my wrapper classes tried to cal=\r\nl order.create(), I would simply fail immediately because the URI did not c=\r\nome back from the first get /orders. \n\nI can&#39;t imagine Amazon, Flickr or an=\r\nyone would simply publish a single URI and say &quot;Hey world.. here is the pub=\r\nlished URI.. go have fun&quot; and then make clients guess what is possible with=\r\nin the realms of the API. There has got to be some sort of knowledge about =\r\nwhat this API will allow. I think as long as it stresses in the document th=\r\nat a client must never assume all possible calls are available.. there shou=\r\nld be no reason why this wouldn&#39;t work.\n\nFor example, if I go to a certain =\r\nweb site, I can easily jot down the list of href links I can click on. Most=\r\n of the time, those are going to be the same based on a given state. If I l=\r\nog in, a web site lists some menus/links I can click. They are pretty much =\r\nalways the same thing. I could write a client side test system to automate =\r\ntesting of this. I might have to do something like &quot;get me all links&quot;.. and=\r\n then a &quot;if this link.. click it.. I know it does this..&quot;. sort of thing.. =\r\nso that in case I log in and a new News link is available, I can handle it,=\r\n possibly based on the media type.\n\nI guess my point is, I don&#39;t understand=\r\n how a client is supposed to go into a RESTful API completely blind. There =\r\nhas to be some idea of what is possible with the API and that if you create=\r\n an order, the possible links coming back might be these.. they may or may =\r\nnot all be present, but at most it&#39;s these so you can at least know ahead o=\r\nf time what you might have and can do.\n\nthanks.\n\n\n--- On Thu, 2/25/10, Jan =\r\nAlgermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Jan Algermissen &lt;algerm=\r\nissen1971@...&gt;\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Differentiating HTTP-based APIs\n=\r\nTo: &quot;REST Discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nDate: Thursday, February =\r\n25, 2010, 5:19 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Hi,\n\n\n\nI h=\r\nave put together a table classifying HTTP-based API-types according to the =\r\nREST constraints they adhere to:\n\n\n\n&lt;http://nordsc. com/ext/classifi cation=\r\n_of_ http_based_ apis.html&gt;\n\n\n\nHope this is useful.\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n------------ =\r\n--------- --------- -----\n\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n\n NORD Software Con=\r\nsulting\n\n\n\nMail: algermissen@ acm.org\n\n Blog: http://www.nordsc. com/blog/\n=\r\n\n Work: http://www.nordsc. com/\n\n------------ --------- --------- -----\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-60774554-1267113459=:63568\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hi Jan,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good info.
