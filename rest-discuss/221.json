If the action you were completing is\n&gt; &quot;idempotent&quot; then by definition it is safe to try again and again until it\n&gt; succeeds. The HTTP GET, PUT and DELETE methods are idempotent. If you think\n&gt; about them as if they were file system commands it should be clear why. It\n&gt; never hurts to read a file over and over again. It also does not hurt to\n&gt; write a file over and over again as long as you are writing the same data.\n&gt; And deleting a file repeatedly will at most give you an error message.\n\nPUT is idempotent, but it also has side effects.  You have to be wary of\nthat.
