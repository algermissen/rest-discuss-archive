And \ndoing so, you contradict yourself several times and you&#39;re turning this \ndiscussion in a serious of personal insults. That you don&#39;t want to \ndiscuss things I said is up to you, you don&#39;t have to answer them anyway.\n\nBottom line on this thread, my point is that a REST Client does not have \nto be a HTTP Client. So a thread that start as &quot;Generic REST client&quot; \nshould had been named &quot;Generic HTTP client for REST&quot;. What I did was to \npoint that out.\n\nI could comment some of your points - to which in some cases I agree as \nI said in the earlier post -  and in some cases clarify what I said or \nwhat you say I said (which is not the same), but it&#39;s visible that \nyou&#39;re not interested in coming down from your high-horse and you just \ndismiss as &quot;trolling&quot; anything that doesn&#39;t fit your way of thinking.\n\nNote that you started your *first* response to a post of mine by saying\n\n&quot;BTW, if you re-check this group&#39;s charter, you might find that\nrest-discuss is dedicated to discussions about the REST architectural\nstyle as described in Roy&#39;s thesis.  While you may try to redefine\nREST as a reference to the community, everyone else here thinks REST\nspecifically refers to Roy&#39;s thesis.  So either accept that and stop\nmaking snarky comments about the thesis and criticizing answers that\ntry to explain said thesis, or go start rest-discuss-discuss.  Please\nread and try to understand the thesis, instead of cherry-picking from\nit to support your arguments without any understanding of context.)&quot;\n\nNow, if you read my previous posts on this thread, where did I tried to \nredefine REST, made snarky comments, criticizing answers, cherry-picking \nwhatever?\n\nIf what you&#39;re wrote as the beginning of your answer isn&#39;t trolling, \nwhat is it? Who&#39;s trolling who?\n\n\nEric J. Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Ant�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Now what you can argue is that my interpretation is different then \n&gt;&gt; yours, and you can even argue that yours is more close to the\n&gt;&gt; intentions of Mr Fielding, and that&#39;s OK, maybe you&#39;re right. But\n&gt;&gt; even then, you should say that &quot;my understanding of Roy&#39;s thesis is\n&gt;&gt; different from yours&quot; instead of &quot;you&#39;re misunderstanding Roy&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; thesis&quot;... Unless you&#39;re Roy...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; So REST dies with Roy, because it&#39;s utterly incomprehensible to anyone\n&gt; else?  Please.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are plenty of examples on this list of people who have taken the\n&gt; time to struggle with this subject, and believe it or not, learned what\n&gt; REST is.  Since we all use the same definitions of the same terms, we\n&gt; can even have conversations about REST without resorting to &quot;agreeing\n&gt; to disagree&quot; because, believe it or not, there are right and wrong\n&gt; answers -- due to the clarity with which Roy&#39;s thesis describes his\n&gt; subject matter to *anyone* who makes the effort to understand the\n&gt; Computer Science basis of REST, even if that means reading one or more\n&gt; of the footnoted reference materials.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only definition of REST is Roy&#39;s thesis, and it is *not* open for\n&gt; interpretation.  There&#39;s plenty of room to flesh out the things that\n&gt; aren&#39;t in the dissertation, but there is no room to re-define REST to\n&gt; fit your own definition of whatever you want it to be -- REST is not so\n&gt; abstract a notion that anything goes.  If I&#39;m wrong about something, I&#39;m\n&gt; quite certain Roy will correct me if nobody else here (who knows what\n&gt; they&#39;re talking about) does first.  REST isn&#39;t so theoretical that the\n&gt; only person capable of giving an answer here is Roy himself -- if that\n&gt; were the case, I seriously doubt anyone else would be much interested\n&gt; in REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; You, however, have not studied your ass off for years learning this\n&gt; material -- so stop reducing everything to a semantic debate.  You have\n&gt; lots more listening and reading to do, before you&#39;re in a position to\n&gt; correct or even criticize the posts of others.  You&#39;d be a lot farther\n&gt; along with REST if you spent half as much time studying REST as you do\n&gt; criticizing and arguing with people on rest-discuss.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Neverthless, my interpretation actually is similar to the bigger part\n&gt;&gt; of what you said, but what you&#39;re describing at the end of your post\n&gt;&gt; is what is referred as &quot;tunnelling&quot; and that&#39;s not we&#39;re doing. We\n&gt;&gt; are not tunnelling HTTP over other protocols or other proctocols over\n&gt;&gt; HTTP. We could have done that, it had been more easy for us, since\n&gt;&gt; we&#39;re partially based on Jersey and Jersey kinda support that.\n&gt;&gt; Instead, I&#39;v rewrited significant parts of what Jersey does with HTTP\n&gt;&gt; in order to decouple the HTTP part from the REST part, in order to\n&gt;&gt; use the later with other connectors that work over other protocols.\n&gt;&gt; Basically, we&#39;re applying the same RESTfull constraints that are\n&gt;&gt; &quot;natural&quot; in HTTP to other protocols. Of course that in order to do\n&gt;&gt; so we loose something, but that&#39;s not the point.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; What I described has nothing to do with tunneling.  Modeling a system\n&gt; on the Uniform Interface means that you&#39;re using methods which are as\n&gt; well defined as methods come.  If you have some other method you need,\n&gt; then you redevelop your system to make it work with the Uniform\n&gt; Interface instead -- what you *don&#39;t* do is resort to tunneling custom\n&gt; methods over POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; How on Earth can you read what I read, and conclude that I&#39;m talking\n&gt; about tunneling?  Oh yeah, you spend more time rebutting what others\n&gt; say than you do actually reading what they&#39;ve written, let alone\n&gt; trying to understand it.  As a result, you simply don&#39;t make any sense\n&gt; when you talk about applying the constraints of REST to a protocol like\n&gt; JMS -- a result of failing to take the time to learn what REST&#39;s\n&gt; constraints actually are.  That or you&#39;re a troll -- I don&#39;t know quite\n&gt; know what else to make of someone who has spent exponentially more time\n&gt; arguing about REST than they have spent trying to learn it.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; But then again, in my understanding of Roy&#39;s thesis, the constraints\n&gt;&gt; are to be applied to the architecture, not to the communication or\n&gt;&gt; the protocol. That the communication and thus the protocol is part of\n&gt;&gt; that architecture, that is true. That some protocols are are more\n&gt;&gt; &quot;natural&quot; fits for those constraints, that is also true. But people\n&gt;&gt; here focus too much in &quot;protocol&quot; and less in &quot;user-agents&quot; and\n&gt;&gt; &quot;connectors&quot;, that also are part of the architecture.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; REST is defined as a set of constraints -- you don&#39;t apply constraints\n&gt; to an architecture, an architecture is defined by the constraints it\n&gt; imposes on a system.  You apply REST&#39;s constraints to the communication\n&gt; between network connectors, independent of protocol.  The hypertext\n&gt; constraint is applied to the message entity, and this has absolutely\n&gt; nothing to do with what network protocol is involved. Again, if you\n&gt; want to make every thread a discussion of the collective shortcomings\n&gt; of this group as a whole, please start rest-discuss-discuss.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; I understand that there are some superiors minds in this list that \n&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t interested in these minor questions and doubts, but then again \n&gt;&gt; this is rest-discuss, not rest-philosophical-discuss...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Enough already with all the boring ad-hominem *whining* in your posts.\n&gt; Please. REST is an architectural style, so of *course* discussions here\n&gt; are going to be philosophical in nature.  Again, plenty of people on\n&gt; this list have managed to get REST sorted out over the years, with less\n&gt; help than is available to those just getting started now.  But you seem\n&gt; to have a chip on your shoulder against anyone who *has* learned, and\n&gt; you seem like a troll for constantly demanding special treatment that\n&gt; none of the rest of us needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The rest of us had to learn the hard way, find the REST wiki by reading\n&gt; the archive of this list or simply lurking here for awhile (instead of\n&gt; being told of it, but only *after* griping that no such thing existed,\n&gt; etc.)... what makes you so special?  REST is hard, there are no\n&gt; shortcuts, you simply need to invest the time (most often measured in\n&gt; years) that it takes to learn any complex subject matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I want to learn the Theory of Relativity, and actually use it in\n&gt; professional life, then there&#39;s no way around reading Einstein&#39;s work,\n&gt; and no way around reading and studying Physics before even getting to\n&gt; that point.  It doesn&#39;t take an Einstein to grasp relativity theory (to\n&gt; come up with it in the first place, sure), nor is Einstein the only\n&gt; person capable of answering questions about it.  Stephen Hawking can\n&gt; explain it to you, but only after you&#39;ve taken the effort to learn\n&gt; Physics.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet somehow, it&#39;s a failure of the REST community for not providing\n&gt; authoritative &quot;Cliff&#39;s Notes&quot; which offer some easier alternative than\n&gt; reading Roy&#39;s thesis, for people who haven&#39;t studied software\n&gt; architecture.  Your trouble learning REST is nobody&#39;s problem but your\n&gt; own, so stop trying to assign blame to others, or demanding that others\n&gt; accept &quot;your interpretation&quot; of terms as valid before trying to answer\n&gt; your questions, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Learn the terminology, and REST won&#39;t seem nearly so ambiguous as it\n&gt; must seem, in order for you to think that it&#39;s somehow open for\n&gt; interpretation.  It isn&#39;t, but you can only know that *after* studying\n&gt; your ass off.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
