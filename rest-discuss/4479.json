Doing Generative Naming and add the capability\n&gt; in the query string?\n\nWhat access-control properties are you trying to achieve?\n\nSince you want Generative Naming, I assume the user submitting the query \nhas the authority to access all resources in the namespace. Is this \ntrue? When the user passes the generated URL to another user, does the \nother user:\n\n1. receive access to just the identified resource\n2. receive access to all resources in the namespace\n3. receive no new authority\n\nSo far, I haven&#39;t felt a need for Generative Naming in web-calculus \napplications. The pattern I currently use is:\n\n--&gt; POST search terms\n&lt;-- redirect to search result\n--&gt; GET on redirect URL\n&lt;-- search results\n\nThis pattern provides the access control properties of #1 above.\n\nA Generative Naming pattern might be able to optimize out a network \nround-trip, while still providing the same access-control properties, \nbut I haven&#39;t yet felt the need to design such a solution. This use-case \ndoes not seem prevalent in applications that have access-control \nproperties. Generative Naming seems more important in applications with \nno access-control properties.\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe web-calculus is the union of REST and capability-based security.\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
