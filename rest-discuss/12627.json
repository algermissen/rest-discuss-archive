A lot faster than initial load.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I violently agree. Then, how do you express RESTfully a query\n&gt; inquiring about the possibility of a set of ~100, or for the sake of\n&gt; argument arbitrarily many, state transitions? The &quot;question&quot; is too long\n&gt; to stuff everything into the URL for a GET request. POST or PUT requests\n&gt; are technically, RESTfully not appropriate.\n\n2 possibilities come to mind:\n\n1. You got all the states etc from the server in the first place.\nCould you express a shorter query that would fit into the URL for a\nGET request, since you do not have to repeat everything for the\nserver?\n\n2.  Personally, I would not hesitate to user POST for this situation,\nif I could not make it work with GET.  Caching is not an issue anyway.\n But I am sure somebody else will disagree.\n\n(I am not a purist, and treat REST as guidelines which allow variances\nif I know what I am doing and the price of the variance is\nacceptable.)\n\n&gt; That is all my question is about and I thought I had made this clearly\n&gt; initially. Judging by the amount of misunderstanding, however, I&#39;ve made\n&gt; a very bad job of it.\n\nCommunication is difficult.  I think I finally understand, altho I\nwouldn&#39;t bet on it...\n\n"}}
