This only matters for\n&gt; non-idempotent methods (primarily POST). As far as I know, the only\n&gt; protocol issue (as opposed to software issue) is some form of ID that\n&gt; ensures that the same thing (e.g. purchase order) is not POSTed twice.\n&gt; Should there be a convention for doing it so that it need not be always\n&gt; done at the application level? There must be a reason that HTTP doesn&#39;t\n&gt; have this already.\n\nYup, there is.\n\nIf you use that header, you want to be able to know that that the other\nend of the pipe understands it.  Because most will just ignore it and\nnot tell you they are doing so (per RFC 2616).  Enter the need for a\nmandatory extension mechanism, such as in RFC 2774 (M-*) or in SOAP\n(though with SOAP headers).\n\nSee the example at the end of this;\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-discuss/2001Dec/0008.html\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
