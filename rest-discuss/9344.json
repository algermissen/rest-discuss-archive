Resource Exists.\n&gt;2. DELETE -&gt; Resource doesn&#39;t exist.\n&gt;3. DELETE -&gt; Resource exists even less?\n&gt;\n\nOn my workstation, I&#39;m always deleting files twice.  The first time I \ndelete a file, the file itself is not altered or moved, yet now it \nappears in my &quot;trash&quot; until I delete it for a second time.  When the \nfile is in the trash, its status is &quot;used to exist&quot; but after it&#39;s \nbeen deleted from the trash its status is &quot;not known to have existed.&quot;\n\nI&#39;m simply applying this everyday computing paradigm to an HTTP server.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The state of a resource returning 404 or 410 is identical - null.\n&gt;\n\nGranted, the state of the resource between those messages is identical, \nyet those two messages have different meaning.  It is reasonable to \nprovide the user with a means to change from one to the other, just \nlike it is reasonable for a file system to implement a trashcan to \ndistinguish between &quot;used to exist&quot; and &quot;not known to have existed&quot; as \na result of user action.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;All that is different is metadata about a resource that used to exist.\n&gt;This is primarily a convenience to a client trying to understand why a\n&gt;GET or POST failed.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you want to manipulate the metadata of a resource that doesn&#39;t exist\n&gt;you&#39;d be best to make that metadata a resource in itself.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t follow.  There is no requirement that a resource must first \nexist, before I can manipulate it.  I have an URL, dereferencing it \nyields a response code indicating the resource doesn&#39;t exist.  That \ndoesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t send that URL an HTTP request.  The objection \nhere seems limited to the fact that the state of the resource doesn&#39;t \nchange as the result of the second DELETE, only the response code.\n\nBut I&#39;m not seeing where that requirement is set in stone.  OTOH, I \nsee where REST is flexible enough to allow innovation, even if the \nresult is unorthodox, because orthodoxy is in the eye of the \nbeholder.  What matters, is whether or not I&#39;ve violated a standard \nor broken a constraint of REST.  I don&#39;t believe I have.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
