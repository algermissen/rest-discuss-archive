Any\n&gt; &gt;*thing*,  period, can have an identifier\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a meaningless statement. As soon as you&#39;ve stated **that\n&gt; thing** you&#39;ve identified it.\n\nYou&#39;re confusing identity with identification. Someone will be the first \nperson to call me on the phone tomorrow, I&#39;ve no idea who (ie. I \ncouldn&#39;t identify them), but whoever it will be is (and always was and \nwill be) a satisifer of x = x. That&#39;s all identity is, nothing more, \nnothing less.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
