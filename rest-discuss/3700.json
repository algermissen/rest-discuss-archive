And that\nincludes strategic business to business integration services. Many\nbusinesses today run RosettaNet over SSL (I&#39;m tempted to say most RN\nimplementations do but all I can say is 100% of my small sample [4] do).\n\nThe article suggests that using SSL makes it impossible to implement\nnon-repudiation schemes because you can&#39;t get at the encrypted bits.\nBut non-repudiation schemes I have dealt with of rely on digesting the\nplain text of the message. You can send a signed multipart message or\nuse XMLDSIG across SSL and that is as reliable a nonrepudiation scheme\nas any -- you don&#39;t need to digest the encrypted bits. \n\nAs far as encryption goes, few scenarios gain anything from encrypting\nthe application level message as opposed to encrypting at the\ntransport level. The endpoint argument isn&#39;t really very interesting.\nThe article says ISPs often can&#39;t set up a multihomed server properly.\nSet up a new endpoint or get a competent ISP! And I mean, are you\nreally running this strategic business app on a multihomed server your\nISP configures?\n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
