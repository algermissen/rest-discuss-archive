Each &#39;Buy Me&#39; link could be a POST to a shopping cart\n&gt;=\r\n resource, say, http://example.com/users/alice/shoppingcart, to\n&gt; increment=\r\nally accumulate purchases by changing shopping cart\n&gt; resource&#39;s server-sid=\r\ne state each time.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, when checking out, you could get the current ca=\r\nrt state from the\n&gt; server to present to the user.
