It\n&gt; may be good as a learning aid, but no more. In fact, meeting certain\n&gt; qualities takes a lot more in practice than simply following the\n&gt; script. That aside, I don&#39;t find the assertion that &quot;is an either-or\n&gt; thing&quot; useful. \n&gt; \n\nDisagree.  I see REST as the long-term goal of an evolving system, an\nideal against which to measure development.  If REST mismatches are\nignored, what yardstick is the system&#39;s development to be measured by?\nSo I see REST as black-and-white, but with no implied criticism towards\nsystems which don&#39;t measure up.  There are aspects of my own system\nwhich aren&#39;t RESTful:  in some cases they&#39;re considered bugs, while in\nothers I simply don&#39;t care because being strictly RESTful brings nothing\nto the table -- but my understanding of the mismatches is critical to my\nknowing the difference and being able to categorize/prioritize.  I don&#39;t\nsee what is to be gained by pretending those mismatches don&#39;t exist.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
