And we&#39;ve gone all REST-irrelevant, \n&gt; as far as I can tell.\n\nYes, thanks for stepping in, and sorry. I came here to discuss RESTful\ndesign issues and got accosted by the XML+XSLTists preaching complete\nsalvation, but only for those who truly believe.  But it was my fault; I\ntook the bait.  Honestly, I&#39;ll really just want to discuss the REST-related\nissues and leave the unrelated religions at home. I&#39;ll try to wrap it up now\nbelow.\n\nAristotle Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt; You&#39;re being rather too harsh on Mike there. I *like* XSLT, \n&gt; but the Result Tree Fragment concept is utterly braindead. \n&gt; It&#39;s naught but premature optimisation by committee; the WG \n&gt; thought that requiring implementors to return full node sets \n&gt; from templates would be an undue burden. The upshot is that \n&gt; nearly every single XSLT 1.0 processor has an extension \n&gt; function to convert RTFs to node sets - such as \n&gt; `msxsl:node-set`. Looks like the committee guessed wrong. \n&gt; Indeed, XSLT 2.0 does away with the RTF brain damage.\n\nThank you for agreeing that XSLT&#39;s Result Tree Fragment concept is utterly\nbraindead.  I really do appreciate your coming to my defense here. It is\nquite annoying to have people tell me that I don&#39;t have relevent experience\nwhen they have no idea, and then when I prove my experience they change\ntactics and attempt to discredit my experience by saying I &quot;just don&#39;t get\nit&quot; rather than propose tangible alternatives to the very problems that\nresulted in my criticism.\n\nSo thank you. \n\n&gt; (I almost never write XSLT without reaching for EXSLT. Some \n&gt; things are impossible without `exsl:node-set`, and trying to \n&gt; mung text content with bare XSLT is an exercise in pain and \n&gt; suffering. Also, processing Atom without EXSLT&#39;s datetime \n&gt; functions is lots of unfun.)\n\nI discovered EXSLT toward the end of my XSLT ordeal, but it was\nunfortunately too little, too late at the time.  If I were forced to use\nXSLT again, I&#39;d certainly start there.\n\nAlexander Johannesen wrote:\n&gt; You *did* get lots of answers, and a lot of them pointed to \n&gt; your lack of understanding of what &lt;apply-templates /&gt;...\n\nThen we&#39;ll just have to say I don&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot;  But I&#39;m quite content with\nthat now, as long as I don&#39;t have to deal with the XML+XSLT evangelism,\nespecially on a list devoted to another topic: REST.\n\nBut I know that my simple requesting it won&#39;t stop the aggressive\nprosthelitizing of the true believers. So tell you what Alex, Rusty,\nAristotle, Eric, et. al.; rather than dishing out admonishions about my\napparent lack of cognition and presume I would be a true believer too if I\nonly &quot;got it&quot;, and rather than not discussing actual solutions to the\nproblems I previously posed on XSLT-related lists, why not take a crack at\nmy prior use-case and prove that I really didn&#39;t get it after all and that\nXML+XSLT truly is the savior in our midst?  \n\nThe goal of the challenge will be to take the XML source for both [1], [2],\n[3], [4], [5], and [6]  and create an XSL Transform that reproduces what was\npublished with full fidelity and produce it in a manner from any XML\ndocument matching the same input schema. And yes, the HTML for those\ndocuments was generated with an XSL transform so it is possible (note the\ntransform only produced the inner-content, not any of the ads for menus or\nwhatever.)  \n\nIf anyone accepts this challenge I&#39;ll go back and make sure I have\neverything needed to make it work (xml source, xsd schema, xslt app, and\nanything else needed) and I&#39;ll package it up, and post it on my blog for all\nto download (I&#39;d do it proactively but it will take some time so why make\nthe effort if nobody takes the challenge?) Then we can all have a &#39;naked\nconversation&#39; about it and take it OFF [rest-discuss] and you can prove the\n&#39;obvious&#39; benefits of XSLT, as well as your XSLT prowess and my obvious lack\nthere-of.\n\nAnd who knows?  Maybe you&#39;ll convert me and I&#39;ll become an XML+XSLT true\nbeliever too. Stranger things have happened.  But I won&#39;t hold my breath.\n\nBTW, don&#39;t think I&#39;m trying to get you to do my work for me; hardly. The\nlatest timestamp on the project files is Feb 8th 2006, the code is not\ncurrently in use, I had/have no current plans to resurrect it, and wouldn&#39;t\nuse XSLT again if and when I do.\n\nSo, LET US TAKE THIS XML+XSLT DEBATE OFFLIST AND TO OUR BLOGS, if need be,\nand clear the virtual airwaves so we can resume mutually-agreeable\ndiscussions of RESTful solutions and RESTian best practices. \n\nIf you want to take up the challenge you can email me directly at\nmikeschinkel@... and I&#39;ll go about preparing the files and blog post.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/ormapping/ \n[2] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/ormapping/tables/ \n[3] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/pdf/\n[4] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/pdf/tables/\n[5] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/charting/\n[6] http://www.howtoselectguides.com/dotnet/charting/tables\n\n\n"}}
