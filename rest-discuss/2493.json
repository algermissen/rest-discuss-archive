However, I keep coming to one conclusion in partcicular.\nThis conclusion may not be very popular within this list, esp. since this\nlist is generally pro-HTTP.  But I like sticking my neck out, so here\ngoes...\n\n\nThe most common &quot;proof&quot; that REST works is HTTP.  This makes sense\nconsidering that Fielding had been looking at HTTP when he did his work on\nREST.  Also, considering that he helped author HTTP 1.1, this would lend\neven more credence to the statement that &quot;The Web proves that REST works.&quot;\n\nBecause of this, I have focused on learning REST as it applies to HTTP,\nthough I had initially started by trying to learn REST independent of any\napplication or protocol.  In this learning process, I continually run into\nquestions that do not seem to have clear, understandable answers.\nConsidering that HTTP was considered RESTful, I thought this to be an odd\nthing.  I would expect a RESTful protocol to clearly show how the REST\narchitecture works.\n\nThen it hit me.  I have let myself fall victem to marketing hype!  And here\nis why I say that.  I took it as gospel that HTTP === REST.  I believed in\nthe statement that &quot;The Web proves that REST works.&quot;  But I kept coming up\nwith these &quot;issues&quot; I couldn&#39;t reconcile.  So I sat down this weekend and\ninstead of considering *what* wasn&#39;t reconciling, I considered *why* it\nwasn&#39;t reconciling.  And I think I finally hit upon the reason.\n\nHTTP is not as RESTful as we would all like to believe.  For years, people\nhave been building web sites, mostly static pages.  Did these people use\nHTTP PUT to update the server?  Absolutely not!  They used FTP.  They used\nthe access to their HTTP server through their local network.  To some\nextent, they even used HTML Form-base file uploads via POST.  But PUT?\nHardly.  The exact same could be said for DELETE.\n\nSo, then we are left with POST and GET.  How do their &quot;typical&quot; usage play\nout in the REST arena?  Well, as has been pointed out by many, many threads\non this very list, POST is often missused.  I&#39;d even be willing to bet that\nthe vast majority of uses for POST are wrong in the eyes of REST.\n\nThis leaves us with GET.  GET is probably the one HTTP verb that generally\nconforms to the REST architecture.  This is a good thing, considering that\nprobably 90% or more of the web traffic uses GET.\n\nSure, there *are* more and more implemenations of REST showing up, but in\nratio to the existing &quot;non-REST&quot; implementations already on the web, this is\nprobably quite a small number.\n\nSo, how can people say that &quot;The Web proves that REST works&quot;?  It&#39;s because\none (GET) of the four major HTTP verbs provides for 90% or more of the\nproof. POST provides the most of the remaining percentage, and even though\nmany consider its usage to often be non-RESTful, we&#39;ll conveniently ignore\nthat.  And, as usual, PUT and DELETE are pretty much non-existant (in terms\nof actual usage).\n\nIn the end, this does not make the Web a killer app that proves REST works.\nIf anything, it proves that certain aspects of REST work (i.e. GET).  Beyond\nthat, I am beginning to feel that HTTP has as much to prove as a truly\nRESTful tool as does just about any other web-based technology out there\nright now....\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
