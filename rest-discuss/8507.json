That&#39;s not the only way to do it, but it&#39;s one way.\n\nThe key is that this shopping cart does have its own URI. The contents \nof the cart are not referenced by some sort of session token like a \ncookie that maps to the resource. The URI is the identifier, and \ndifferent shopping carts have different URIs.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
