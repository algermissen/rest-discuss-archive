I think the best way to do that would be to encode\nthe subscribers into the snapshot resources somehow.\n\nOr just have a transactional queue that allows complete arbitary\nviews... so two clients can take snapshots and other client can\ncontinue committing...\n\nWhatever. I&#39;m pretty sure the answer is transactional snapshots.\n\n\n\n\nI looked at the apache project you mention last year and was going to\ndo something with transactions... but until someone pays me to just do\ncool stuff I&#39;m stuck with having to earn a living   /8-&gt;\n\nIf there are any billionaire&#39;s out there reading REST discuss then\nplease consider me for the &quot;someone to employ to sit around doing mad\nscientist stuff in the attic&quot; position in your household.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
