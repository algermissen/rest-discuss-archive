If the state was transferred such that it was &quot;processed&quot;, then\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s a success.  One can, I believe, quite reasonably define &quot;processed&quot;\n&gt; &gt; to include determining whether an XML document was well-formed or not\n&gt; &gt; ... if that meets your needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, in that case your resource is just an XML parser, not an\n&gt; application that consumes well-formed and perhaps valid XML.\n\nEven in the latter case, I&#39;d say it&#39;s just fine.  If your application\nonly consumes well formed XML on POST, then you *may* want to use 400,\nbut 200 would be valid as well.\n\n&gt; &gt; No, you got it, that&#39;s what I meant.  &quot;Back&quot; from the &quot;400 page&quot;, so to\n&gt; &gt; speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, then the application still has the same means for proceeding\n&gt; through the application that it did before the error.  Should be no\n&gt; problem in terms of state machine.\n\nExcept that the 400 response is supposed to describe the error, so it\nshould be a dead-end from the POV of progressing the application.\n\nThere&#39;s probably a more accurate way to describe that in terms of\napplication state, but I can&#39;t come up with it right now.\n\n&gt; &gt; Dunno, you&#39;ll have to ask the editors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay.  Editors?\n\nFWIW, 2xx is also like this, as 202 doesn&#39;t mean &quot;processed&quot;.  Henrik\ntold me this was a legacy issue that wasn&#39;t felt to warrant changing\nthe first-character rule.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
