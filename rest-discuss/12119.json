Is the distinction between the GET and\n&gt; POST in this instance that requested resource is viewed through a\n&gt; different client than the one requesting it? The user just clicks a\n&gt; button to get a view of a resource, but instead of returning to the\n&gt; browser the view is returned to an email client. Is that the\n&gt; distinction?\n&gt;\n&gt; I accept that it should be a POST, but, if side effects like caching\n&gt; and request logging are OK for GET, why not sending an email?\n&gt;\n&gt; Apologies for my newbie ignorance,\n&gt; -Rob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Feb 12, 2009, at 8:55 PM, Robert Koberg wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Feb 12, 2009, at 8:32 PM, Jon Hanna wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Robert Koberg wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; What method should be used if the request is for an email to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sent?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, you have a &#39;forgot password&#39; view. The user enters\n&gt;&gt;&gt; their\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; email address, submits the form and an email is sent with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; instructions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; on how to reset their password.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems like this is a GET. Before REST, I would have probably\n&gt;&gt;&gt; used a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; POST.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; May I ask, why this seemed like a GET to you?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (I keep forgetting to hit reply all)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Because I am dense :) I understand now that sending the email is a\n&gt;&gt; side effect outside of the request/response cycle and so not safe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking that since the actual send of the email was not the\n&gt;&gt; responsibility the app server(s) that it is a safe and idempotent.\n&gt;&gt; It falls to the mail server to handle it so the app server can wash\n&gt;&gt; its hands of the situation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, say a GET request is cached (on the originating server or at\n&gt;&gt; any hop along the way). Is that a side effect? If not, why not?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Rob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
