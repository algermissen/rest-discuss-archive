It at least\n&gt; requires POST for add/delete/modify, so will avoid problems of doing\n&gt; so with GET (with caches and accelerators[1]). But it&#39;s putting the\n&gt; real operation name in the URI, which means that resource\n&gt; identification isn&#39;t being done properly, and that makes it unRESTful.\n&gt; Hypermedia doesn&#39;t seem to apply to this API though (AFAICT) because\n&gt; there doesn&#39;t seem to be much of an application there; but I might not\n&gt; be looking closely enough.\n\nHmm:\n\nPOST http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/ModifyFeed\nPOST http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/DeleteFeed\nPOST http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/ResyncFeed\nPOST http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/AddFeed\n\nare problematic (but I could take or leave ResyncFeed).\n\nI don&#39;t see a big deal with:\n\nGET http://api.feedburner.com/management/1.0/GetFeed?*\n\nas it&#39;s nothing more than redundant.\n\nThe thing to bear in mind is the Feedburner API design falls naturally \nout of HTML forms. I&#39;m utterly convinced HTML forms is the most damaging \nWeb technology standard ever conceived - it demands. Nothing else is \nremotely close. It&#39;s confused maybe half a dozen web technologies (cgi, \nbrowsers, SOAP/WS, xml-rpc, web-mvc, Web2.0 apis). It coerces developers \nto the do the wrong thing; either with apps or framework designs.\n\nAs the W3C are looking at their HTML strategy I hope this is on top of \nthe pile. People learn web programming via forms, not theses.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
