Roy Fielding&#39;s\n&gt; dissertation has following comment on cookie based state mechanism\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A state mechanism that involves preferences can be more efficiently\n&gt; implemented using judicious use of context-setting URI rather than\n&gt; cookies, where judicious means one URI per state rather than an\n&gt; unbounded number of URI due to the embedding of a user-id.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any examples of this? In particular, what does URI per\n&gt; state means? \n&gt; \n\nThe state of the resource and the state of the application are not\nalways the same in REST.  A personalized page is really the same\nresource state for all users, although each user&#39;s application state\nvaries by username.  Instead of assigning each application state a URI\nlike http://example.org/joe/welcome_page, use one URI per resource\nstate, i.e. http://example.org/welcome_page, and vary its output based\non the username present in HTTP Digest authentication headers (instead\nof cookies).  That&#39;s just one example.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
