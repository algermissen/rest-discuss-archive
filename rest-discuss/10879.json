(Or anybody else?)\nhttp://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Certified_HTTP_Project\n\n(They do cite http://www.dehora.net/doc/httplr/draft-httplr-01.html )\n\nThey appear to claim RESTfulness, but not exactly explicitly:\n&quot;The bigger-picture goal is to make a simple way to conduct reliable\ndelivery and receipt such that general adoption by the wider community\nis possible. This means that we have to respect HTTP where we can in\norder to take advantage of existing tools and methodology, and to\nnever contradict common conventions in a REST world.&quot;\n\nSee also:\nhttp://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Certified_HTTP#reliable_application_logic_in_body\n\n&quot;This includes technologies like httpr and ws-reliable.\n\n&quot;These tend to be thoroughly engineered protocol specifications which\nregrettably repeat the mistakes of the nearly defunct XMLRPC and the\nsoon to join it SOAP -- namely, treating services as a function call.\nThis is a reasonable approach, and is probably the most obvious to the\nengineers working on the problem. The most obvious path, which is\nfollowed in both of the examples, is to package a traditional message\nqueue body into an HTTP body sent via POST. Treating web services as\nfunction calls severely limits the expressive nature of HTTP and\nshould be avoided.\n\n&quot;Consumers of web services prefer REST APIs rather than function calls\nover HTTP. I believe this is because REST is inherently more\ncomprehensible to consumers since all of the data is data the consumer\nrequested. In one telling data point, Amazon has both SOAP and REST\ninterfaces to their web services, and 85% of their usage is of the\nREST interface[1]. I believe ceding power to the consumer is the only\npath to make wide adoption possible. In doing so, we must drop the\nentire concept of burying data the consumer wants inside application\ndata.&quot;\n\nAlso, what do you think of their attempt at a distributed transaction protocol?\nhttp://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Certified_HTTP_Escrow\n\nIt claims to be atomic, but not ACID.  (As far as I know, you must\nrelax the ACID guarantees to do distributed agreement protocols among\nmultiple independent agents.)\n\n"}}
