Now they are almost at CR stage and \nwill resist changes even more strongly.\n\nPerhaps XHTML 2.0 is the next opportunity to attack the problem. Another \noption is to just write a W3C NOTE ... or if anyone is ambitious enough \n(and works at a member company) to try to push the NOTE through the \nprocess as its own WD. &quot;HTTP Authentication extensions for XForms and \nXHTML&quot;.\n\nWhen I mentioned the problem to Dan Connolly at a conference he slapped \nhis head and said something like: &quot;We STILL haven&#39;t fixed that? Damn.&quot; \nIt&#39;s a little thing but with a wide impact on how people build websites...\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
