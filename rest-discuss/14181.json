By using well-known\n&gt; media-types (as xhtml and atom):\n&gt; \n&gt; - (positive) intermediate layers are able to understand its\n&gt; information and act accordingly, although it does not know the meaning\n&gt; of a, i.e., class=&quot;contract&quot; within a div\n&gt;\n\nCorrect, self-descriptive messaging refers to the HTTP headers involved,\nincluding a well-known method and media type.  The entity itself is\nignored.  The media type is irrelevant to intermediaries, unless of\ncourse content negotiation is involved.  The reason for using well-\nknown media types is for visibility (I can&#39;t tell by looking what\n&#39;application/vnd.*&#39; means, like I can with, say, &#39;text/html&#39;) and\nserendipitous re-use.  If, to use your service, I have to code a client\nto some completely new media type versus just coding a client to handle\nextensions to a well-known media type, I&#39;m much less likely to bother\nwith your service.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - (positive) classes can represent what in other custom formats would\n&gt; be an xml element\n&gt;\n\nOr attribute.  Don&#39;t forget that the success of the Web is predicated\nupon displaying all sorts of documents using the limited set of\nelements and attributes provided by HTML.  Instead of creating new\nelements, figure out which existing elements can serve the purpose, and\ndecorate them with @id, @class, @role etc. to provide specific\nsemantics not offered by the host language (HTML, SVG, Atom etc.).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - (positive) we can use schematron to validate it on the server and\n&gt; client side\n&gt;\n\nYou can create your own media type that&#39;s just as easily validated by\nRELAX NG + Schematron, or XSD.  If you&#39;re extending XHTML, then first,\nyour document should validate normally.  Then, instead of creating an\nentirely new schema for an entirely new markup language, you just need\nto flesh out an existing schema to account for extension attributes and\ntheir allowable values.  Much easier for others to serendipitously\nre-use.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - are intermediate layers schematron-aware? (might be negative?)\n&gt;\n\nThe only validating intermediaries I know of are specific to wireless\nmobile networks.  If your representations aren&#39;t well-formed XML,\nthey&#39;ll be run through Tidy (or somesuch) to make the content well-\nformed before being sent on to XML-based clients.  Mostly, though,\nintermediaries could care less about payload content / media type.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - (positive) no custom media types - intermediate layers are able to\n&gt; understand everything which passes by\n&gt;\n\nNot so much for intermediaries, but for existing clients and developers.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Any negative points that you have seen so far by using\n&gt; xhtml/atom+xml/subset+xml?\n&gt; \n\nI can&#39;t even imagine any.  The only time I&#39;ve seen a negative impact\nresult from choice of media type, is when using media types that aren&#39;t\nwell-known.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
