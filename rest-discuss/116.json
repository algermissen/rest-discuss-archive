A practical reason is that the meaning is\n&gt; &gt; more obvious, especially to most firewalls that permit blocking based\n&gt; &gt; on methods.\n\nHere&#39;re what I hope are a few *really, really* good arguments against introducing\na WATCH method for subscription.\n\n(1)  It doesn&#39;t make sense for all resources to support subscriptions;  the naive\nbehavior --- send me the entire new state anytime the resource changes --- doesn&#39;t\nmake sense for all resources, particularly ones that change with high frequency.\nMore sophisticated cases --- such as &quot;send me only the changed state&quot; --- probably\ncannot be defined generically for all (or even many) application domains and\nmodeled resources.\n\n(2)  Supporting subscriptions for a substantial portion of resources hosted by a\nparticular domain has costs which may not be justified for a given service /\napplication.\n\n(3)  Recognizing (1) and preventing (2) would require a kind of fine-grained,\nper-resource configuration to allow or disallow WATCH behavior.  Sure, global DENY\ncould be overridden by local ALLOW, but do you *really* want to burden the server\nadministrator with defining what is probably more accurately an application\nconfiguration issue?  Is the cost of moving that configuration duty out into local\nconfig space e.g. Apache htaccess files really worthwhile?\n\n(4)  Adding new methods to HTTP requires changes to many different server\nimplementations, firewall implementations, etc.  This has a very high cost in\nterms of delaying the propagation and limiting the reach of the new functionality\nin question.\n\n(5)  It&#39;s not clear at all that a new method is required in order to preserve the\nend-to-end semantics of HTTP.  For example, you could simply model the list of\nsubscriptions to a given resource as a sub-URL of the resource, i.e.\n\n   POST /some/resource/subscriptions?reply-to=http://foo.com/notices/1\n   POST /other/resource/subscriptions?reply-to=http://foo.com/notices/2\n\nIn this case, the subscription list for /interesting/resource is itself a resource\non which GET, POST, and PUT all make sense without modification.  The relationship\nbetween this subscription list and the resource it refers to is conventional\nrather than programatic, but it makes sense in a RESTful modeling sense.  (At\nleast, so it seems to me.)  This is *no longer* an RPC because you aren&#39;t\noverloading POST semantics on the original resource of interest, but rather\nfurther reifying the notion of subscription in the domain of things to which URI\nrefer.\n\nSubscription / notification is really a rather application-specific thing.  It&#39;s\nnot clear to me that a generic subscription / notification mechanism justifies\npolluting the method space rather than just coming up with some generic\nconventions, nor is it clear that adding such a method will spur universal\ndevelopment and interoperability of async HTTP applications.  IMO, it&#39;s a losing\nproposition all the way around, compared to other alternatives.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
