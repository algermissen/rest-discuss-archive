That\n&gt; way, as you said, I can just DELETE the resource and it will be idempotent\n&gt; as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, the twitter REST API you&#39;re trying to build will have to use the\n&gt; official &quot;REST&quot; API of twitter at the backend, right?It feels a little odd\n&gt; to create an api on top of another api for the same purpose as I&#39;m also\n&gt; trying to do something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Mar 21, 2011 at 11:52 PM, Duncan &lt;rest-discuss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, what if you want to un-friend &#39;B&#39; in the &quot;POST /A/friends /B&quot; approach?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You first need to understand the POST body as a declaration of your\n&gt;&gt; intention - here&#39;s a slight adjustment to clarify that:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET /A/friends\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [ /M, /F, .. ]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; POST /A/friends\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; friend /B\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET /A/friends\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [ /B, /M, /F, .. ]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Note the change to &quot;friend /B&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Note also that this is declarative and idempotent, where the imperative\n&gt;&gt; &quot;add /B&quot; approach could potentially cause repeated /Bs if the POST were\n&gt;&gt; repeated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can now say:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; POST /A/friends\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; unfriend /B\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to declare that you intend B to be missing now from your friends list.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These examples are sketches, and the Media Type for the POST body should of\n&gt;&gt; course be widely-recognised, which means the form type, or JSON, or whatever\n&gt;&gt; your collaborators are happy with. I don&#39;t know of any standards that can be\n&gt;&gt; re-used to do &#39;friend&#39; and &#39;unfriend&#39; - you may have to drop down to less\n&gt;&gt; semantic data editing formats.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, just &quot;PUT /A/friends [ /M, /F, .. ]&quot; would work, but that&#39;s a\n&gt;&gt; pattern that really only applies to smaller lists that you have control\n&gt;&gt; over, rather than large lists or lists that are changing a lot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or do the alternative I suggested, of a new resource parameterising your\n&gt;&gt; friendship, which can be DELETEd.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Duncan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
