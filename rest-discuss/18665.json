Links represent re=\r\nsources you can work with. The idea of links is that you can usually follow=\r\n them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are lots of questions you m=\r\nay have about them: what do I do with the actual resource (say, web page) I=\r\n&#39;m in? What is this link referring to? What other operations apart from GET=\r\n can I execute with it? Can I add query parameters to it? What media type w=\r\nill it return? What media type may it expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...=\r\n\n\n2. rel is an attribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a =\r\nvalue, keyword, hint of what relation the link has with the current resourc=\r\ne/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is your current resources and it ha=\r\ns a URI. A link with rel=3D&quot;next&quot; will hint that following that link will g=\r\net you to the next page of the book. \n\n3. It is important to understand tha=\r\nt the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has wi=\r\nth the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denot=\r\ne other information, like saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent t=\r\no use the link&#39;s URI with a POST to create something. That is not the inten=\r\nded use and it is a bad practice.\n\n4. You may need actual business intellig=\r\nence in your client. If you are looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot;=\r\n will tell you the links points to the actual blog post. Having that inform=\r\nation, you can start asking that parent for information, or even send a com=\r\nment to it using POST operation. That is natural simply because much of thi=\r\ns interaction is already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need =\r\nto be statically programmed, but it will need intelligence.\n\n5. So, you hav=\r\ne there standard metainformation (like how to handle media types, the seman=\r\ntics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have b=\r\nusiness specific semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something =\r\napplicable only to, say, banking applications). With that info you can prog=\r\nram intelligent clients.\n\n6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor an=\r\nd image are special links that have a standard meaning and established proc=\r\nessing. If you found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is refer=\r\nring to an image, and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed pr=\r\nocessing it to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context =\r\nand additional attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody =\r\nin the world knows it.  So, links are difficult to understand at first but =\r\nonce you have it clear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link r=\r\nel attribute will tell you everything.\n\nCheers\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n--- In re=\r\nst-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know one of =\r\nthe first questions i had was on rel link. I understand the basic premise b=\r\nehind rel attributes(to provide a general documentation for how to interact=\r\n with the link provider).\n&gt; \n&gt; The premise of the rel attribute on links is=\r\n (in the case of the HTML or Atom media types) to provide information about=\r\n the meaning of the link beyond &#39;this is a link&#39;. If you register your rel =\r\nname in the IANA registry, you can use the short name you registered, e.g. =\r\n&#39;next&#39; or &#39;up&#39;. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI=\r\n. Simply for the matter of making your rel unambiguous.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that URI po=\r\nints to a human readable page explaining the relation, then that is even be=\r\ntter.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to=\r\n implement in code (or configure) what the user agent should do when it see=\r\ns your link rel value.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://foo/customerDetails&quot; ... /&gt;=\r\n is conceptually the same as &lt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; .../&gt; and also as H=\r\nTML&#39;s &lt;img src=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt; or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;. It is jus=\r\nt hypermedia ... that a user agent needs to be programmed to do something w=\r\nith ... in order to have it do something with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; IOW, your browser do=\r\nwnloads that image because it is programmed to do so. This same concept als=\r\no applies to other hypermedia - your user agent component will act on the h=\r\nypermedia it comes across in the way it is programmed (or configured) to do=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; No magic.\n&gt; \n&gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually m=\r\nore felt in the obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react =\r\nto the hypermedia you actually come across instead of the one you presume t=\r\no come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST m=\r\nostly makes explicit that there isn&#39;t any control over the server side in n=\r\networked systems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather than magical=\r\nly solves a problem that cannot be solved. And on top of that, REST provide=\r\ns a number of mechanism that optimize for *dealing with* the problem (e.g. =\r\ncontent negotiation).\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The question is what would =\r\nyou see if you go to the rel link? Is it something a person is suppose to i=\r\nnteract with (say to get documentation for new links added to a specific re=\r\nsponse) or something code can interact with to determine what it needs to d=\r\no? Unfortunately in the book they don&#39;t give an example of what a &quot;rel&quot; pag=\r\ne would look like. For example the link:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://relations.=\r\nrestbucks.com/payment&quot;\n&gt; &gt; href:=3D&quot;http://restbucks.com/payment/1234&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you typed in &quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot; into your =\r\nweb browser what would you see? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
