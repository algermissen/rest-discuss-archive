Instead =\r\nhe recommends using a forward proxy. His reasoning appears to be that corre=\r\nct implementation of caching is non-trivial and that getting reuse of a cli=\r\nent-side proxy is easier, safer, and less risky.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if others a=\r\ngree with his views. Are there any client side libraries that handle the tr=\r\nickiness for you? Is &quot;it&#39;s hard to get right&quot; a good enough reason.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
