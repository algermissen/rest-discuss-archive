Is there a W3C finding that docume=\r\nnts this, or some other paper?  I&#39;ve been doing a significant amount of res=\r\nearch on URLs and URI best practices in the past 3+ months and have found n=\r\nothing like this (though I could have missed it.) \n\nTo me, is appears on th=\r\ne surface to be a sound engineering principle, but in practice an unreasona=\r\nble constraint.  Given my research I&#39;ve come to the conclusion there is a n=\r\need for additional metadata standards that would allow better determination=\r\n of URL equivalence when the expense of retrieving the resource is not proh=\r\nibitive.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nConsider a blog with the =\r\nfollowing URL structure:\n\n\thttp://www.myblog.com/{author}/{year}/{month}/{d=\r\nay}/{post-name}/\n\nNot let&#39;s assume those are hackable URLs, which mean that=\r\n all of the following will provide appropriate lists of posts with each one=\r\n having a breadcrumb path at the top:\n\n\thttp://www.myblog.com/{author}/{yea=\r\nr}/{month}/{day}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {author} &gt; {year} &gt; {month} \n\n\thttp://www.myblog=\r\n.com/{author}/{year}/{month}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {author} &gt; {year} \n\n\thttp://www.mybl=\r\nog.com/{author}/{year}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {author} \n\n\thttp://www.myblog.com/{author}=\r\n/\n\t\tHome \n\nNow given that, I might also want to have the following, each wi=\r\nth it&#39;s own appropriate breadcrumbs\n\n\thttp://www.myblog.com/{year}/\n\t\tHome =\r\n\n\n\thttp://www.myblog.com/{year}/{month}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {year} \n\n\thttp://www.mybl=\r\nog.com/{year}/{month}/{author}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {year} &gt; {month}\n\n\thttp://www.mybl=\r\nog.com/{year}/{author}/{post-name}/\n\t\tHome &gt; {year} &gt; {month} &gt; {author}\n\n(=\r\nWe are ignoring the problem of duplicates on a day or for an author within =\r\na year. I have strategies for handling but would make my reply much longer =\r\nand isn&#39;t important for this discussion of this issue.)\n\nSo a user decides =\r\nto drill down the year/month/author path and then selects a post. They read=\r\n the post and then look to click the breadcrumb to go back to author&#39;s page=\r\n.\n\nBut wait, the year/month/author breadcrumb isn&#39;t there because the serve=\r\nr redirected them to the author/year/month version of the URL.  The user is=\r\n rather confused, and frankly a but pissed off because they had seen an art=\r\nicle they wanted to read but were not sure where it was now. So they leave =\r\nthe website in a huff vowing never to return.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nConsider another set of URLS:\n\n\thttp://www.mycarsite.com/{mak=\r\ne}/{model}/{year}/\n\nBut it&#39;s also logical to have:\n\n\thttp://www.mycarsite.c=\r\nom/{year}/{make}/{model}/\n\nOr even:\n\n\thttp://www.mycarsite.com/{make}/{year=\r\n}/{model}/\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nAnd those are but two =\r\nexamples, I have (literally) tens if not hundreds more examples I could pro=\r\nvide.  I can&#39;t imagine it would be good human interface to bounce users aro=\r\nund like you are suggesting.\n\nBasically we are talking about information th=\r\nat can be viewed as a heirarchy but for which the heirarchy is mutable. Ess=\r\nentially we are talking about Matrix URIs [1] where the only difference is =\r\nslashes instead of semi-colons (the semi-colon syntax never caught on and a=\r\nt this point I would guess both web developers and users are more comfortab=\r\nle understanding slashes in their URLs compared with semi-colons.)\n\nSo woul=\r\ndn&#39;t Matrix URIs violate the principles you mention above?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schin=\r\nkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1=\r\n] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html\nSo it seems to me there is=\r\n a \n\n\n\n\t\n\tWalden\n\t\n\t----- Original Message ----- \n\tFrom: &quot;Elliotte Harold&quot; =\r\n&lt;elharo@... &lt;mailto:elharo%40metalab.unc.edu&gt; &gt;\n\tTo: &quot;REST Disc=\r\nuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n\tSent: Sunday, December 31, 2006 8:24 AM\n\tSubject: [rest-discuss] Determi=\r\nning the equality of two URLs\n\t\n\t: How would one determine the deep equalit=\r\ny of two URLs?
