My solution is to use browser-resident XSLT to transclude\npersonalized content from a resource implementing authentication-\nbased conneg redirection, using HTTP Digest authentication.\n\nGET /A responds with an XHTML stub, which calls a static XSLT file.\nThat XSLT file transforms Atom content from /B into XHTML, and also\ntransforms an XML personalization file from /C .  Resource /C does not\ninitiate challenge-response in absence of an Authentication: header, it\nresponds 200 OK with &#39;Cache-Control: public&#39; and its anonymous-user\nvariant.\n\nWhen the request has an Authentication: header, /C may use role- or\nuser-based logic to redirect to role- or user-based variants whose\nLocation: is inside a directory which does initiate challenge-response\nwhen no Authentication: header is present.  This redirect can also use\nHTTPS to secure HTTP Basic authentication, but I use Digest and Cache-\nControl: private.\n\nThus, /A may securely expose an individual user&#39;s password in its\nrendered steady-state, despite the fact that /A is a public-cached\nresource.  The drawback is that must-revalidate is required on /C , but\nthe browser-resident XSLT architecture effectively mitigates this,\nallowing /A to scale anarchically, despite personalized content.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
