The framework is built upon this core API and\n&gt; provides you with reusable classes that allow, among other things, for\n&gt; connection between components and exchange of representations.  If you\n&gt; read Fielding&#39;s dissertation, it should be easy for you to imagine other\n&gt; classes that might exist in this framework as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Alex Jacobson [mailto:alex@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 04, 2003 6:14 PM\n&gt; To: Phil Eskelin; &#39;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [rest-discuss] OT: terminology?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not simply talk about document types?
