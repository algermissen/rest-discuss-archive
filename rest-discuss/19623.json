Goo=\r\nd points. And it makes me think we could make the conversation less theoret=\r\nical and more concrete if we turned our attention to what clients and serve=\r\nrs will be able to do with Uber without deeper knowledge of data payloads. =\r\nDo you have some implementation underway?\n\n&gt; Now, to back up a bit. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1=\r\n) is this really about programmer optimization? id yes, a few bits of code =\r\nthat translates the internal data into Uber is not a big deal and could sol=\r\nve that problem.\n\nMaybe it&#39;s a local optimization, but IME, many programmer=\r\ns will not take that step. If it were in a library that would help. I&#39;m ima=\r\ngining passing an arbitrary object to the Uber library and getting an escap=\r\ned string representation suitable as &quot;value&quot; data out. \n\n&gt; 2) is this about=\r\n payload size? i don&#39;t think uber adds much weight at all here (the JSON fl=\r\navor is certainly more compact than the XML one). and when you&#39;re talking a=\r\nbout 180,000 data points. that&#39;s a pretty big chunk of data anyway. you&#39;re =\r\nfree to use compression on the outbound with will greatly reduce the added =\r\nweight since repeated chars compress very nicely.\n\nWithout incentives or co=\r\nnstraints, IME, many developers would skip the compression step. If you&#39;re =\r\nin control of both clients and servers in your system you can use conventio=\r\nn to ensure compression. But it seems we&#39;re aiming at a format for distribu=\r\nted development. \n\n&gt; 3) finally, what format are you using now? have you lo=\r\noked at HAL? it is designed to host arbitrary objects in a wrapper.  I&#39;d be=\r\n interested to see some comparisions (custom format, HAL, Uber) not just of=\r\n size of the representation but also the size of the compressed response an=\r\nd the cost to process (surely the Uber will be the most costly to process, =\r\nright?)\n\nIndeed, we are using HAL. What you suggest would be good tests. \n\n=\r\nMatt\n"}}
