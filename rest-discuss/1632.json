Path-based\nrouting is the version that takes the most new syntax so it is what I\nhad trouble envisioning as part of REST. I already know how the other\nstuff (proxies, namespace remapping, redirection, etc.) work.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; These are just a few of the possibilities.  When you introduce asynchrony,\n&gt; the possibilities get even richer.  My $0.02:  let&#39;s not jump to the\n&gt; conclusion that SOAP routing == &quot;SOAP Routing&quot; / &quot;WS-ROUTING&quot; in the Henrik\n&gt; et. al. sense, or that routing HTTP requires path-based addressing...\n\nIt isn&#39;t a quesion of whether &quot;routing HTTP requires path-based\naddressing.&quot; It doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s a question of whether there are problems\nthat require routing where the client specifies the list of nodes in\nadvance and then waits for the completion of hte action. If so, what is\nthe syntax for supporting that.\n\nIf Rohit is not enamored of WS-Routing then I don&#39;t know what he sees in\nSOAP at all.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
