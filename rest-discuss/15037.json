I was just thinking this today. If I\n&gt; &gt; provide a s=\r\ningle URI point of entry, and an OPTION or GET request is\n&gt; &gt; sent, it retu=\r\nrns some relevant links that can be called based on the\n&gt; &gt; state of the re=\r\nsource. Now, to get those links, I have to first\n&gt; &gt; access the point of en=\r\ntry URI. What happens if say a bot program (or\n&gt; &gt; even a client developer)=\r\n decides to cache/save these URIs that\n&gt; &gt; return. Then at some point later=\r\n, call those URIs directly instead\n&gt; &gt; of the point of entry URI first to g=\r\net those URIs back. They could\n&gt; &gt; even navigate some links for a while, th=\r\nen save the various URIs\n&gt; &gt; deeper down. Later, call those directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nA URI that is saved -- iow, bookmarked -- counts as an entry point\n&gt; URI.  =\r\nThis sort of bookmarking is required to implement many kinds of\n&gt; systems c=\r\nomposed of multiple components that expose REST style\n&gt; interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of=\r\n course, there is no guarantee that URIs saved by a client will\n&gt; remain va=\r\nlid over time.  Clients that save URIs must accept that the\n&gt; resources tho=\r\nse URIs name may disappear as any point in the future.\n&gt; Well behaved serve=\r\nrs do not disable URIs capriciously (see Cool URIs),\n&gt; but resources do hav=\r\ne life-cycles that are governed by their domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My confusion of =\r\nthis is because the server side is stateless. It\n&gt; &gt; retains no state. So h=\r\now can I validate a URI that a client/bot\n&gt; &gt; saved from some previous use,=\r\n to make sure it&#39;s valid at the time of\n&gt; &gt; call? I have no state on the se=\r\nrver side that says &quot;this URI is\n&gt; &gt; being called BEFORE the URI that retur=\r\nns this URI was called.. it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; a bad call&quot;. So I am unsure as to how to =\r\nvalidate every single URI\n&gt; &gt; call to make sure it was called at a time whe=\r\nn it should be called,\n&gt; &gt; and not just randomly out of order. I suppse we =\r\ncan use some sort of\n&gt; &gt; timestamp on every single URI that goes back, not =\r\nsure entirely how\n&gt; &gt; that would work at this point, but I suppose the serv=\r\ner would check\n&gt; &gt; this value when it came back in to the current server ti=\r\nme stamp and\n&gt; &gt; make sure it&#39;s within so many minutes of when it was issue=\r\nd. But a\n&gt; &gt; smart client developer/bot could possibly figure that out, and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; update this value before making the request, and since the server\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nkeeps no state, if the modified timestamp is within the right time\n&gt; &gt; of t=\r\nhe server, it would void that route of validating a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do you ca=\r\nre if the resources are accessed &quot;out of order&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; If there are domain r=\r\neasons for a resource to be available for a\n&gt; limited time, the application=\r\n logic should destroy/deactivate the\n&gt; resource once it is no longer valid.=\r\n  In that case, this hypothetical\n&gt; client with get a 410 or 404 when it at=\r\ntempts to make requests of the\n&gt; now nonexistent resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is=\r\n no domain reason for the resource to expire why is it a\n&gt; problem for a cl=\r\nient to save a URI and the access it later?\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; http://barelyenoug=\r\nh.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
