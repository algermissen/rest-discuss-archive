The only criticism I&#39;d have of  \n&gt; the\n&gt; URL design here is that &quot;dream.out.format&quot; is long to type.\n&gt;\nThanks very much for that pointer. You&#39;re right about 3.2.2, and that  \nchallenges my understanding of HTTP terminology. So whether I GET:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles\n\nor\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?p=7\n\nI get back a representation of the *same* resource (which from the  \nuser&#39;s perspective is a collection of articles). Is it correct to  \ncall these different &quot;representations&quot; of the same resource? It says  \nin the spec that a representation is &quot;An entity included with a  \nresponse that is subject to content negotiation, as described in  \nsection 12. There may exist multiple representations associated with  \na particular response status.&quot; Tacking on a &quot;?p=7&quot; is not content  \nnegotiation as defined by the spec. So I think all I can say is I get  \nback *a* representation of the same &quot;collection of articles&quot; resource  \nfrom any URI that is &quot;http://www.artima.com/articles&quot; to the left of  \nthe question mark.\n\nI looked again at 3.11 in the spec, and I see they left sufficient  \nwiggle room for entity tags and caching. Given that the spec says  \nentity tags are per-resources, my understanding to date had been that  \nI could have a unique set of entity tags per URI. But since the above  \ntwo distinct URIs really refer to the same resource, their entity  \ntags should really taken from the same set. But the spec says that &quot;A  \ngiven entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by requests  \non different URIs. The use of the same entity tag value in  \nconjunction with entities obtained by requests on different URIs does  \nnot imply the equivalence of those entities.&quot; This says a cache can  \nonly rely on identical entity tags meaning the entity is identical if  \nit is from the same URI. So in practice it worked like I had  \nimagined: I can have a unique set of entity tags per URI, and If-None- \nMatch requests from caches will really work per-URI, not per-resource.\n\nDoes that sound correct?\n\nBill\n\n&gt; cheers\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
