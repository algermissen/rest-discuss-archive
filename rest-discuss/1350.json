Four, six, \n&gt; ten, fifty. It \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t matter much =\r\nas long as they are general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, I *do* believe this number is c=\r\nritically important. \n&gt;  That number is an exponential factor, not a multip=\r\nlicative \n&gt; constant, in determining the compositional complexity of any \n&gt;=\r\n software system.  At some point --- maybe, modulo more \n&gt; commercial conce=\r\nrns --- I may trot out the mathematical \n&gt; argument here.  But I think this=\r\n is the under-recognized and \n&gt; supremely important aspect of the meta-theo=\r\nry behind REST:  \n&gt; the &quot;width&quot; and variety of interfaces has a direct and =\r\n\n&gt; geometric impact on the overall complexity of systems that \n&gt; use those =\r\ninterfaces...\n\nAll this assumes that verb count at least correlates with ma=\r\nnaging\ncomplexity if not actually reducing it.\n\nIn the not unrelated world =\r\nof speech act theory, the prevalent view\nseems to be that there is no natur=\r\nal restriction on performatives\n(verb) count; as soon as we&#39;ve written down=\r\n all the ones we think\nwe need, we&#39;re done. The main thing is to clearly de=\r\nfine what those\nverbs mean. I haven&#39;t seem arguments against extending the =\r\nverb set\nover time. The original KQML took some flack, not dissimilar to\nth=\r\nat of RDF&#39;s by logicians, for having imprecisely defined verbs.\nFIPA-ACL at=\r\ntempts to address this by having clear semantics for its\nverbs (and one ass=\r\numes then, shared behaviours). There are quite a\nfew verbs in KQML and FIPA=\r\n-ACL. I imagine there is an assumption\nthat if the verb set is well grounde=\r\nd, the meaning and intention of\nnew verbs can be inferred, not unlike the a=\r\nssumptions surrounding\nRDF and semantic web entities. That&#39;s a different ki=\r\nnd of software\nthan is written in the middleware trenches today. Contrast t=\r\nhis\nwith the RPC extension mechanism, the procedure, which is the\nad-hoc ad=\r\ndition of new verbs. \n\nBill de h=D3ra\n\n \n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVer=\r\nsion: PGP 7.0.4\n\niQA/AwUBPPN/W+aWiFwg2CH4EQLcEgCg6XlQrMltwf2Ar3+H4qyEUbr3uP=\r\n4AoJFc\nkFoKLnH1kVNpl5Iaz9SHBFRe\n=3DIZVq\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
