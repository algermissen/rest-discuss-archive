In most cases there&#39;s\nplenty of wiggle-room on response codes, so that&#39;s left to the API to\ndescribe.  A system&#39;s security implementation isn&#39;t described by its\nmedia types, so your API has to describe the use of HTTP Digest, user\nroles, and such.  Your API does this via hypertext -- descriptive error\nresponses with links instead of the default 4xx response message, for\nexample.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In [1] Roy writes\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in  \n&gt; defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and\n&gt; driving application state, or in defining extended relation names\n&gt; and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types.\n&gt; [...]&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I am reading too much into this, but then...usually Roy\n&gt; chooses his words quite carefully:\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know why it is &quot;*almost* all of its descriptive effort&quot;  \n&gt; and not simply &quot;all of its descriptive effort&quot;? What else is there\n&gt; to be described than the media types?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [1]\n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n&gt; \n\n"}}
