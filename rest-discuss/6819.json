I am developing an architecture with its own name which is a \nsubset of the constraints in REST, with further constraint, and applied to a \nsingle use case.  Which makes it REST-derived or REST-inspired but not REST.\n\nWhich brings us to the same frustration I recently experienced with trying to \nput part of REST in lay terms, the result is a lay explanation of something \nwhich isn&#39;t REST.  I&#39;m stuck on that problem myself, sorry I can&#39;t be of any \nhelp to you with it...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;P.S. Regarding a constraint model on REST, maybe *that* could transcend\n&gt;&quot;just an architecture style&quot; and move into being a recommendation.\n&gt;\n\nIf you look at the uri@... list archive, there has been discussion about \ncreating a URI templating standard, which can serve as the basis of \ndescribing (somehow) a site&#39;s URI structure.  I think this approach, of \nfiguring out a way to define a site&#39;s URI structure which is machine-\nreadable, is what should be standardized rather than standardizing any one \n&quot;reference implementation&quot; of REST.\n\nOr, for that matter, defining either singular or plural pathnames as a best \npractice.  You are most certainly welcome to research and create a body of \nwork regarding that issue, and the usage of metadata in URI allocation \nschemes in general, and I would be greatly interested in reading the result. \nBut that result would be your system of &quot;wellformedurls&quot; as defined at \nwellformedurls.org, not REST as defined in Roy&#39;s thesis.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
