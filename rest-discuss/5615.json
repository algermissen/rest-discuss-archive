What is &quot;stored context&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve read this to mean anything being stored about a &quot;connection&quot;. \n&gt;&gt;Cookies give the appearance of stateful connections over the stateless \n&gt;&gt;connections of HTTP.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think HTTP authentication is completely innocent in this regard \n&gt;&gt;either, though it brings less brutality to HTTP than cookies.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Depends what you do with cookies doesn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; You *can* associate state with authentication details... you *can* do\n&gt; authentication similar to basic auth just with cookies.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any argument purely against using cookies? \n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s just against having state orthongonal to the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m saying is that a cookie is no different to a client\n&gt; certificate or an established authentication session.
