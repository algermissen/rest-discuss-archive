While hRESTs is a way to embed that vocabulary in an HTML =\r\nfile, however this is not entirely correct.\n\nThere is as you pointed out an=\r\n overlapping between the two and neither of them is clearly or completely d=\r\nefined.\n\nI think the overlapping is because SA-REST came slightly before hR=\r\nESTs and now they are saying that SA-REST can be viewed as an extension to =\r\nhRESTs that offers things like p-lang-binding and data-format which strange=\r\nly enough isn&#39;t mentioned in their W3C submission, so maybe it&#39;s something =\r\nthey dropped or added later, I guess dropped according to dates but I&#39;m not=\r\n sure.\n\nAbout SA-RESTs lifting/lowering they mention it in a paper (older t=\r\nhan the W3C submission) this is the paper\nSA-REST: Semantically Interoperab=\r\nle and Easier- to-Use Services and Mashups\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/=\r\nabs_all.jsp?arnumber=3D4376235\nand in it there is a simple example of SA-RE=\r\nST (I suspect an old one). (if u can&#39;t access the paper I can send the exam=\r\nple to u)\n\nSo it seems SA-REST is not established yet, they keep on changin=\r\ng it without stating how it changed.\n \nI hope this is helpful,\n\nRegards,\n\nA=\r\nreeb\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Sean Kennedy &lt;seandkennedy@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;       I am trying to write up a section  of my thesis on S=\r\nA-REST. As far as I \n&gt; can see SA-REST has similar goals  to hRESTS i.e. ma=\r\nrkup HTML Web API \n&gt; descriptions with semantic metadata. I  have a few q&#39;s=\r\n that I am looking for \n&gt; help with:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Where does SA-REST fit in? The=\r\n service model [1] looks very similar to the \n&gt; service model of hRESTS [2]=\r\n. According to the diagram at the start of  [2], \n&gt; SA-REST sits on top of =\r\nhRESTS - why then does SA-REST  define a similar service \n&gt; model? \n&gt; \n&gt; 2.=\r\n According to [2], SA-REST supports faceted search. Where are &quot;p-lang-bindi=\r\nng&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;data-format&quot; [2] coming from? Why is there no mention of them i=\r\nn the W3C \n&gt; Submission ? [3].\n&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is no  =\r\nlifting/lowering. How is this done \n&gt; when using SA-REST?\n&gt; 4. Are there to=\r\nols such as SWEET [4] for annotating HTML with SA-REST?\n&gt; 5. I am strugglin=\r\ng to find a nice simple HTML example (not in RDFa), such as the \n&gt; hotel ex=\r\nample [2].\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] SA-REST service model http://www.w=\r\n3.org/Submission/SA-REST/#sec_7\n&gt; [2] hRESTS: an HTML Microformat for Descr=\r\nibing RWS \n&gt; http://knoesis.wright.edu/research/srl/projects/hRESTs/#restfu=\r\nlExample\n&gt; [3] SA-REST service model http://www.w3.org/Submission/SA-REST/\n=\r\n&gt; [4] SWEET http://coconut.tie.nl:8080/dashboard/#1304592891993\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
