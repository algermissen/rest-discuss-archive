I thought I said the same thing.  \n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the difference?  Where am I wrong?\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t get it at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s your use of the word &quot;request&quot;.  The client can&#39;t request it.  \nIt\n&gt; just sends the data, and it&#39;s up to the container to do it, or not.\n\nI meant &quot;request&quot; in the sense of HTTP Request.\n(Not the everyday use of the word.)\nI thought HTTP was a Request-Response protocol.\nThe URI for the new resource comes back on the Response.\n\nNo?\n\nBut I&#39;m happy to change the word.\nWhat would you say instead?\n\n&gt; I suppose you could consider the use of SOAPAction with a URI\n&gt; identifying the expected type (in this case, a\n&gt; StatePreservingContainer), a &quot;request&quot;.  But I didn&#39;t get the \nimpression\n&gt; that that&#39;s what you were suggesting.  If so, then you were right.\n\nNo, I want to stay away from SOAP in these discussions as long as \npossible.\n\n&gt; &gt; Also, the name StatePreservingContainer is not very clear, at \nleast \n&gt; &gt; to me. Nor is IdentityPreservingContainer. But maybe that&#39;s \nbecause \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still missing some subtlety.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it could be the name.  If you&#39;ve got any suggestions after this,\n&gt; I&#39;m all ears.\n\nThe feature we are discussing is the creation of a new resource in \nresponse to a POST, right?  &quot;IdentityPreserving&quot; sounds like it \nalready has an identity, and the container is preserving it, whereas \nthe server is creating the identity.  How long the identity is \npreserved is another consideration; &quot;forever&quot; may not be needed.\n&quot;ResourceCreatingContainer&quot; would work for me, if that is the main \ndistinguishing feature of this type.\n\n\n\n"}}
