So, RESTAuthenticat=\r\neBank is\n&gt; &gt; RESTful, but CookieBank is not.\n&gt;\n&gt; Authentication is orthogon=\r\nal. Cookies are also orthogonal when they\nare\n&gt; simply used for content neg=\r\notiation or authentication. However, Cookie\n&gt; authentication is not allowed=\r\n in REST because it lacks visibility,\nwhich\n&gt; causes security problems beca=\r\nuse the other components don&#39;t know it is\n&gt; sensitive information.\n\nCan tha=\r\nt prohibition be more stated more specifically, to say that\ncookie\nauthenti=\r\ncation is not allowed in REST applications using HTTP as\ncurrently\ndefined,=\r\n simply because Cookie is a nonstandard header that proxies\nignore?\n\nThat i=\r\ns, assuming that I were to implement cookie authentication with\nsome\nkind o=\r\nf secure token not requiring any server state, and Cookie was a\npart\nof the=\r\n HTTP standard, and proxies were to treat Cookie similarly to how\nthey\ntrea=\r\nt Authorization for caching, would such use of cookies be consistent\nwith R=\r\nEST?
