REST doesn&#39;t need a &quot;description\nlanguage&quot; as Web services folks know them, because what&#39;s describable\nis either already described (e.g. the HTTP and URI specs, data\nformat specs), or described at runtime (e.g. specific URIs, form\ninstances, etc...).\n\nBest case, a description of a RESTful service risks providing duplicate\nand/or stale information.  Worst case it yields violating REST\nconstraints like &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;, which\nisn&#39;t a good thing for a &quot;RESTful description language&quot; to do, or at\nleast encourage by its very existence.\n\nIf you&#39;re really interested in supporting REST, you might want to\nconsider what it would mean to use these &quot;descriptions&quot; at runtime as\nyou would a form.\n\nMark.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 03, 2005 at 09:30:02AM -0000, Vivek krishna wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;  I am trying to find out if any descriptive schemas exist to describe\n&gt; a REST service,esp the request uri and the response xml formats.What I\n&gt; am looking for would be something similar to WSDL for SOAP web services.\n&gt; I guess it would be a good idea to have some kind of WSDL extensibilty\n&gt; to describe REST services as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to include REST support in my web services client library\n&gt; at http://wsdlpull.sf.net.Thats one of the reasons why I was\n&gt; interested in some kind of WSDL desriptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate some response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; Vivek\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
