But\n&gt; if that is true, we will need an alternative architecture for the web to\n&gt; support the procedural programming model.\n\nThis might be a circular argument, but the Web uses/should-use/is-defined-by\nREST principles.\nThe term &#39;REST&#39; explicitly means &#39;transfer state&#39; - and if you use an\napproach to invoke\narbitrary functions then it is not a &#39;transfer state&#39; approach - it isn&#39;t\nREST. (of course, this is only my opinion).\n\nThere can be value in invoking functions over a network, and there are a lot\nof technologies to do it (rpc, corba, dcom, xml-rpc, soap-rpc, etc.), and\nmany make it easy to use in many languages. However, the whole REST position\nis that transfering state via a small number of functions is a different but\nfully functional approach and many believe it is better at large scales.\n\nBuilding more/better toolkits for invoking functions over a network is fine\nand there are interesting things that can be done, but that approach is\nfundamentally different than one where your primary goals are to transfer\nstate and identify resources. It may be that there are some problems that\nare hard to cast into a resource-modelling/state-transfer approach, and I&#39;ve\ngot no problem shifting to an &#39;invoke function&#39; approach for those problems,\nbut I do have a problem with calling that approach &#39;web compatible&#39; or &#39;part\nof REST&#39; or whatever. There&#39;s nothing wrong with having networked\napplications &#39;outside the Web&#39; or not using REST when its too hard to make a\nparticular problem fit into the Web architecture.\n\n\n\n"}}
