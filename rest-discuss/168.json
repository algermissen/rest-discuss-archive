It&#39;s\n&gt; not clear to me that a generic subscription / notification mechanism justifies\n&gt; polluting the method space rather than just coming up with some generic\n&gt; conventions, nor is it clear that adding such a method will spur universal\n&gt; development and interoperability of async HTTP applications.  IMO, it&#39;s a losing\n&gt; proposition all the way around, compared to other alternatives.\n\nIts hard to believe, but I find myself in raging\nagreement with Jeff here.  A big reason why is\nthe degree of control applications need over the\nmeaning of change and the potential volume of data\nbeing transmitted.\n\nFor example, an application subscribing to the\ncurrent value of the S&P 500 index might not want\nto recieve an update on every trade of every stock\nin the S&P 500, but rather might prefer an update\nevery minute during the trading day (and none when\ntrading is not happening).\n\nAlternatively, suppose an application subscribes\nto a document enumerating the current value of\nevery stock traded on the exchange.  Repeatedly\nsending the URL of this page is much less useful\nthan just sending the content of each trade.\n\nIn theory one might define a generic notion of\nsparse (time based) notification, but I am not at\nall confident that it would cover all required\napplication semantics.  Moreover even if one\ncould, I don&#39;t think you could then avoid having\nto specify the meaning of delta.\n\nAs an aside, doesn&#39;t Chunk encoding also cover\nsome of the application domain.  i.e. open a\nconnection to some URL and get streamed deltas as\nlong as the connection is open.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
