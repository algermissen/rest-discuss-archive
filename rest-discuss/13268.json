I brought REST to JBoss because I believed in it.  I thought it \ncould be a way to fundementally change how our users consume our \nprojects, products, and services.\n\n\n&gt; Distributed transactions are an architectural component of\n&gt; non-REST interaction.  \n\nDistributed 2pc transactions are not RESTful.  I don&#39;t think I or anyone \nat Red Hat ever claimed that.  But why isn&#39;t a RESTful interface for a \n2PC transaction manager useful?  Cannot a transaction manager itself \nhave a RESTful interface?  The application that is using the transaction \nmanager will not be RESTful, but the interaction with the service will be.\n\nBut that&#39;s just 2pc.  I think there is a lot of potential for \ncompensation models (do/undo) in large integration.\n\n&gt; Message queues are a common integration\n&gt; technique for non-REST architectures.  \n\nSo you think services like Amazon SQS and S3 can&#39;t have RESTful \ninterfaces?  Are not useful for application developers?  Can&#39;t be \nconsumed restfully?\n\n&gt; To claim that either one\n&gt; is a component of &quot;Pragmatic REST&quot; is the equivalent of putting\n&gt; a giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as\n&gt; if it were the latest fashion statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea that the community would welcome such a pack of\n&gt; marketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply\n&gt; ridiculous.  Just close the stupid site down.\n&gt; \n\nI took me a long time to get REST taken seriously internally at JBoss. \nAfter a hard fought battle I just want to say thanks for the moral \nsupport. :)\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
