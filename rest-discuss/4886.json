Soap + WSDL may be\nthe Hot New Thing, but it doesn&#39;t really let you do anything you couldn&#39;t\ndo before using other technologies -- if you had a reason to. All that\nDistributed Services Nirvana the architecture astronauts are blathering\nabout was promised to us in the past, if we used DCOM, or JavaBeans, or\nOSF DCE, or CORBA.\n\n--\n\nI&#39;ll try to stick everything he had to say in my little mind. Most of what\nhe said make sense to be, in a very good way. The &quot;problems that they\nthink they can solve, not problems which are useful to solve&quot; thing really\ncatches my eye.\n\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
