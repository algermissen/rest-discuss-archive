This is part of the reason why it&#39;s deprecated in\n&gt; XForms. Sending around bits of XML is a much better way to go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes indeed:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice11.html#rpm-send\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The HTTP &quot;get&quot; protocol is deprecated for use in form submission. Form\n&gt; authors should use &quot;post&quot; for greater compatibility.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Insofar as XForms will most often be used to submit data to be stored,\n&gt; this isn&#39;t a crisis, but when XForms replace HTML forms in general, this\n&gt; is going to be a big problem.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n\nI&#39;m not worried about this at all.  GET forms and POST forms are\ncompletely different beasts.  The latter is for submitting resource\nrepresentations, while the former is an assertion that the specified\nresource is a logical container for other resources, and is indexed by\nsome set of names encoded into a query term.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
