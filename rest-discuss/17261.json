It&#39;s easier\n&gt;&gt; to tell a client to understand the token &quot;edit&quot; rather than 43\n&gt;&gt; different URIs and all the equivalent types which may have the same\n&gt;&gt; meaning (random numbers, hopefully you follow).\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think that extensibility via URI referenced descriptions \n&gt; contradicts media types or link relation types specifications that are \n&gt; provided via a standard registry. It rather complement one another, or? \n\nyes, as you know I suggested just that to the TAG today (you replied :p)\n\n&gt; Just consider the possibility of machine-processable IETF RFC media \n&gt; type/link relation type specifications.\n\nthat&#39;s a/the goal!\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that such developments should happen in the near future. \n\nwhy not?\n\n&gt; However, we should keep our mind open for such extension options, or?\n\ndefinitely.\n\n"}}
