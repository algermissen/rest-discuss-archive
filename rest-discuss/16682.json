Should I be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reading 5.2.1.2 as &quot;most commonly known as a media type,&quot; i.e. as\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; an example and not as a definition?  In which case, should &#39;media\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type&#39; be read as &#39;data type&#39; elsewhere in 5.2.1.2?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then what good does it do? your protocol\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and the messages sent would be incompatible with the entire\n&gt; &gt;&gt; deployed stack of everything we have on the Internet/Web \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (clients/servers/agents/intermediaries/caches/apps), how is being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; incompatible with pretty much everything RESTful?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; +1, but it may help in understanding the distinction between the\n&gt; &gt; style and the implementation, to better decouple the definition of\n&gt; &gt; the style from the implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; could be worth doing if it&#39;s practical in any way, maybe somebody\n&gt; needs to fork and make &quot;REST Strict&quot; packed full of a load of MUSTs.\n&gt; \n\nActually, my thinking is more along the lines of clarification through\nlight editing, i.e. RESTbis -- but please note that I read REST at\nleast two dozen times over a dozen years before presuming to edit the\nthesis, including this earlier effort at editing 5.3.3:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/15146\n\nThe nature of REST as a dissertation means it will never get edited, but\nI don&#39;t think REST is the holiest-of-holies such that it couldn&#39;t stand\na little clarification here and there, over time, in response to issues\nwhich arise demonstrating actual confusion surrounding its wording.\nThis is meant as conversation fodder, not &quot;REST is wrong.&quot;\n\nHere&#39;s all I&#39;d do to 5.2.1.2:\n\n&quot;The data format of a representation is known as a media type [48] on\nIP networks.  A representation can be included in a message and\nprocessed by the recipient according to the control data of the message\nand the nature of the data format. Some data formats are intended for\nautomated processing, some are intended to be rendered for viewing by a\nuser, and a few are capable of both. Composite media types can be used\nto enclose multiple representations in a single message.\n\nThe design of a data format can directly impact the user-perceived\nperformance of a distributed hypermedia system. Any data that must be\nreceived before the recipient can begin rendering the representation\nadds to the latency of an interaction. A data format that places the\nmost important rendering information up front, such that the initial\ninformation can be incrementally rendered while the rest of the\ninformation is being received, results in much better user-perceived\nperformance than a data format that must be entirely received before\nrendering can begin.&quot;\n\nAgain, I&#39;m just winging it on the wording of that first sentence, not\nputting doctoral-thesis-level forethought into it, it&#39;s only a\nsuggestion and not meant as criticism.  But, I think this is more\nconsistent with the wording of Table 5-1 -- media type is representation\nmetadata, not the representation itself, which is a data format.  I\ndon&#39;t think a composite data format (i.e. Atom containing HTML) is what\nRoy meant, so I left &quot;composite media types&quot; alone.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
