Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry.  I was waayy too strident (too little\n&gt; sleep).\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, the question remains: Is it RESTful for\n&gt; resources to be parametrized by authentication\n&gt; information?\n\n\nI don&#39;t believe it is.  The identity of a thing shouldn&#39;t be coupled to \nany Access Control List information I have about that thing.\n\nAnother reason: try to write RDF statements about a bank account, where \nthat bank account is identified in a relative way.\n\nRelative ID: http://example.bank.com/account\n\nYou can&#39;t write anything about that account because to truely identify \nit, you need ACL information.  And in the HTTP world, the authentication \nis done outside the URI.\n\nIf you had an absolute ID for a bank account, then you can actually say \nthings about it.\n\nAbsolute ID: http://example.bank.com/account/12345\n\nThen, this becomes possible (in RDF):\n\n&lt;bank:Account rdf:about=&quot;http://example.bank.com/account/12345&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;bank:ownedBy rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/person/88888&quot;/&gt;\n   &lt;bank:balance&gt;$1,334.23&lt;/bank:balance&gt;\n&lt;/bank:Account&gt;\n\nYou can&#39;t do the above w/ the Relative ID.  All the RDF statements would \nend up saying that *everyone* owns account http://example.bank.com/account.\n\nThis is all true, because HTTP&#39;s authentication is done at the protocol \nlevel, and independent of the URI.  The ID of the thing you are trying \nto operate on is not affected by any ACL information.\n\nNow, having said that, this is a perfectly valid Absolute ID:\n\nhttp://example.bank.com/account?owner_id=88888\n\nBut, of course, not as friendly w/ some caches and search engines.  And, \nyou still have to supply a password (or some authenticating token).\n\nHope that helps,\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
