You take a processing model (eg \ntransactions) you think is necessary and fundamental solution to a \nproblem (eg value exchange).  After a while, you figure that model isn&#39;t \ngoing to work out in the new environment. You conclude that the WWW (or \nREST) is only suited for simple things. A more accurate conclusion is \nthat said model might be contingent to states of affairs, no matter how \nknowledge or tooling you have build up around it. One then might want to \nseek a model that solves the problem and whose semantics will hold on \nthe WWW. Feel free to replace &quot;WWW&quot; with &quot;Internet&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve discussed transactions a few times on this list, and I\n&gt; understand the new REST book has a treatment as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think:\n&gt; * RESTful transactions are impossible, or\n&gt; * some attempts at RESTful transactions have been nonsensical, or\n&gt; * assertions that you need WS-* to do transactions are nonsense, or\n&gt; * something else?\n\nI thinking starting with transactions as /the/ way to solve value \nexchange is starting from the wrong place; people seem to end up \ncomplaining that the web is only good for simple things, or that the web \nneeds to be fixed, and go down the same rathole the RPC and BPEL crowds \nwent. Except for controlled cases (like Subversion commits) the WWW is \nthe wrong environment for ACID semantics.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
