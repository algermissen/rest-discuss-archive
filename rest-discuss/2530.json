REST (the description of the architecture\nstyle of the same name) describes certain properties of the\n&quot;legacy&quot; web, but not others.  For instance, it describes stateless\nclient-server interaction all the while widely deployed web\ntechnologies like servlet support session state.  (You can add\nother examples.)  So REST is *selectively* descriptive, with an\nimprovement goal espoused by its author.\n\nAt the same time, REST seems to describe resources at a level of\nconceptualness that perhaps leads implementation by a few steps.  We\ntrip over little pieces of the HTTP spec that still make resources\nsound like documents instead of the concepts behind them.  The\nverbatim relationship between PUT and GET representations, e.g..\n\nSo, while REST is not *prescriptive* in the sense that it offers\nprocess guidance or method for designing web applications, it&#39;s also\nnot *descriptive* without the above qualifications.  In other words,\nthere may be a large intersection between REST and the deployed\nweb in the large, but there are also significant differences (in\nthe set theory sense of the word -- adds and deletes).\n\nFielding said that REST emerged through analysis of the web and\nproposals to enhance it, and that REST has provided useful guidance\nin settling on enhancements.  That in itself tells you that REST\nis not *just* a description of what exists.  It also tells you\nthat REST &quot;works&quot;, at least for Fielding.  But Fielding is doing\na job somewhat different than the job we, individually, are\ntrying to do.\n\nI think that to address the question of whether REST &quot;works&quot; in\nthe sense of offering you valuable guidance in designing an\napplication, it&#39;s important to ground that in specific problem\nscenarios.  We can get lost in theories about idempotence and\nwhere resources end and representations begin, but do those\nweaknesses in the description really bring the design to a halt?\nI&#39;m as guilty as the next man of attacking on theoretical\ngrounds only.  So far, my implementations have only benefitted\nfrom keeping REST in mind.\n\nThanks,\n\nWalden\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chuck Hinson [mailto:cmhinson@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 13, 2002 12:03 AM\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST and the Web\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Miles Sabin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;As Walden said: have a cookie ... or an unsafe GET, or an \n&gt; abused POST. \n&gt; &gt;Like it or not, they&#39;re everywhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; But I dont think HTTP == REST.  HTTP is one part of an \n&gt; application whose \n&gt; architectural style is described by REST.  HTTP is what defines the \n&gt; semantics of GET and POST.  REST only says that the command \n&gt; set should \n&gt; be small and general and that messages should be stateless.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think if you look at why people claim the web is \n&gt; successful, you can \n&gt; probably relate most of those claims to some principle of a \n&gt; REST-style \n&gt; architecture.\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, it seems to me that a large part of the web&#39;s \n&gt; scalability \n&gt; (performance-wise) is related to the pervasiveness of caches and \n&gt; proxies.  I don&#39;t think caches and proxies would work very \n&gt; well if they \n&gt; couln&#39;t rely on the majority of messages being stateless.  \n&gt; (Caches are \n&gt; great for detecting deviations from REST.)  And, I think caches and \n&gt; proxies would be much harder to implement if the set of \n&gt; commands in HTTP \n&gt; was much larger than it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
