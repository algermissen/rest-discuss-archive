Like most architectural choices, the stateless constraint\nreflects a design trade-off. The disadvantage is that it may decrease\nnetwork performance by increasing the repetitive data (per-interaction\noverhead) sent in a series of requests, since that data cannot be left\non the server in a shared context. In addition, placing the\napplication state on the client-side reduces the server&#39;s control over\nconsistent application behavior, since the application becomes\ndependent on the correct implementation of semantics across multiple\nclient versions ...&quot;\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_3\n\n&quot;... The trade-off, however, is that a cache can decrease reliability\nif stale data within the cache differs significantly from the data\nthat would have been obtained had the request been sent directly to\nthe server ...&quot;\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_4\n\n&quot;... The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\nefficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\nrather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs ...&quot;\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\nhttp://simplewebservices.org\n\n"}}
