Thoughts?\n&gt; \n\nI think this gene=\r\nral approach is pretty solid -- I&#39;ve thought about\nusing the microformats v=\r\nariant of this myself.\n\nBut this approach always has me asking: is this rea=\r\nlly so different\nfrom RPC? \n\nA form microformat or a set of standard query =\r\nparameters aren&#39;t that\ndifferent than a standard function call. Your form i=\r\ns just saying &quot;you\ncan make that standard function call here&quot;.\n\nSo it offer=\r\ns a little more than straight RPC as you can discover when\nand where you ca=\r\nn make that call as you move through the hypermedia\nstate machine. But this=\r\n model isn&#39;t quite right in my mind as it\nconstrains the server&#39;s interface=\r\n too much.\n\nLet me explain with an example: Say you wanted to facilitate ma=\r\nchine\nto machine travel booking (hotels, car rentals, and flights). REST\nsh=\r\nould allow any automated client that supports a standard hypermedia\nformat =\r\n(and a transfer protocol -- HTTP) to book travel given nothing\nother than a=\r\nn initial URL to start at.\n\nThere should be no constraints on the servers o=\r\nther than that they\nsupport the uniform interface of HTTP and the hypermedi=\r\na format. i.e.\none service could provide one giant form for the whole trans=\r\naction,\nanother might offer multiple forms (one for hotel reservation, one =\r\nfor\ncar rental and one for booking flights) all posted to different servers=\r\n.\n\nFor some reason, most &quot;RESTful&quot; machine to machine techniques don&#39;t\nreal=\r\nly give us this. I think most hypermedia formats being used are\nmissing mec=\r\nhanisms to translate from the client&#39;s model of the problem\nto the HTTP req=\r\nuests of the service. In UI-oriented hypermedia, this\ntranslation is left t=\r\no the user. Don&#39;t you need to do something more\nin the machine to machine c=\r\nase?\n\nAnyways, one interesting example of a solution to this can be found i=\r\nn\nCCXML (http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml/). Are there other good examples\n(maybe=\r\n the topic map is one -- I don&#39;t know too much about it)?\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\n\n"}}
