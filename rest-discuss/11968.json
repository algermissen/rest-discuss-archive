IF he wants to be able to &quot;address each\ntranslation as a seperate resource&quot; then he should use his current\ndesign. More than all the arguments you have put forward, my main\nargument for having a separate resource for each translation is that\nbrowser&#39;s don&#39;t allow me to quickly and simply select a language.\n\n\nAnd regards to the URI design, I haven&#39;t really understood the OP&#39;s\nuse case but pray what is the difference between -\n\nwhatever.com/translation/en\nwhatever.com/?translation=en\n\nusing / over ? and = doesn&#39;t make any readability difference*. I\nstrongly argue this point because I have seen a some people change\nover from the second URI design to the first and say their design is\nnow &#39;RESTful&#39;\n\n\nCheers\nDevdatta\n\n\n*In fact for me, the first case is *less* readable\n\n"}}
