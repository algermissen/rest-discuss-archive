This would\nplay better with components that don&#39;t expect (or send)\nacknowledgments.\n\nAlso: how about using message URIs rather than IDs? What are the\ntrade-offs?\n\nI wonder about the GET idempotency constraint sometimes. I think\nthat maybe it can be relaxed for things like &#39;I (the server) want\nto write the request to a recovery log, because I consider it to\nbe a transaction&#39;. That doesn&#39;t seem to me to be as much of a\nviolation as say, non-query, side-effecting HTML forms that use\nGET.\n\nPS: my apologies for mis-understanding the question earlier.\n\n"}}
