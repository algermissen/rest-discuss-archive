Web-thinking is that\n&gt; &gt; every resource (i.e. email message!) represents an endpoint and you send\n&gt; &gt; *them* HTTP messages. That&#39;s why I still don&#39;t think that &quot;mailto:&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; particularly REST-y. Arguably a better name is &quot;mailbox:&quot; and then\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re addressing the mailbox but it is an incredibly course-grained\n&gt; &gt; object.\n&gt; That&#39;s what I was getting at. Since e-mail doesn&#39;t have a single protocol\n&gt; for all operations (SMTP to post, IMAP or POP to get), I thought maybe a\n&gt; user-agent could infer &#39;mailto&#39; meant &#39;try imap or pop if doing a get&#39;.\n&gt; The mailto uri spec might not provide identifiers for tasty sub-resources -\n&gt; like folders and messages within those folders - but we could pretend it\n&gt; did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the &#39;mailbox:&#39; example, I&#39;d love to see\n&gt; GET mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/\n&gt; GET\n&gt; mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/3C48DE11.222C668A@...\n&gt; DELETE\n&gt; mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/3C48DE11.222C668A@...\n&gt; POST GET mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/\n&gt; (this is where a MOVE might be handy)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm... I&#39;m not asking for a new wire protocol, but a client library that had\n&gt; similar abilities as an HTTP client library, but used smtp/pop to do the\n&gt; resource manipulation.\n&gt; \n&gt; You know, maybe i&#39;ll write a servlet that proxies http requests over a set\n&gt; of resources that mailbox servers this way...\n\nYou&#39;re exactly right here.  The mailto: URI *does* uniquely identify a\nmailbox, but that&#39;s not sufficient for resolution.\n\n&quot;http://www.markbaker.ca/&quot; is a URI that uniquely identifies me, but had\nthe HTTP URI scheme not described how to use that string so that\nresolution could be automated, it wouldn&#39;t make it any less valuable as\nan identifer of me.\n\nThe mailto URI scheme could have said something like a POP3 server\nshould be running on the host corresponding to the domain portion\nof an email address (in practice, it would have to be lot more\nconvoluted than that due to MX/A record differences, and other issues).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
