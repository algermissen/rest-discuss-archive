The translator has added\n&gt; various interpretational decisions based on the appropriate\n&gt; cultural contexts. The various documents may even need to relate\n&gt; to each other in different ways.\n\nSo &quot;Beggars in Spain&quot; by Nancy Kress *in English* is not the same \n*novel* as &quot;Beggars in Spain&quot; by Nancy Kress, translated to Russian?\n\nIf not, then why do we speak of them as the same, while talking about \nthe translations as just that --- translations?  I.e., the identity is \nglued to the work;  we specifically speak of the variants of that work \nas variants of that work.\n\nThe point is this:  if the difference between two things is significant \nenough to consider the two things as having separate *identities* then \nthey should have two different names, i.e. URIs.  If not, then they are \nthe same thing --- even if there are multiple variant representations \nof that thing.\n\n&gt; I can still choose from the crappy electronic translation, the\n&gt; poetic Shakespearean translation, the contemporary readable\n&gt; translation, etc. What the original author wrote is one thing;\n&gt; any particular translation of it is quite another. The question\n&gt; is not whether they are the same &quot;novel&quot;, but whether it is\n&gt; useful and desireable to return representations of all of them\n&gt; from GETs on a single URI.\n\nThat all depends on whether you believe that the differences between \nthese representations is enough to convey a separate sense of identity \nbetween them *in the mind of the user.*  That&#39;s going to depend on the \nnature of the resource.  In this case, I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not clear \nthat there is such a separate identity.\n\nAs you yourself pointed out:  the URI doesn&#39;t say how something is \ngenerated.  Nor should it say how something is represented.  It should \nmerely *name the thing.*\n\nAnother way to look at it:  if various users should be able to \nindependently refer to multiple versions of the same abstract thing, \nthen there&#39;s enough &quot;identity&quot; there and purpose there to warrant \nmultiple names.  But if it&#39;s purely a conneg / dynamic decision, then \nall the various translations in the world don&#39;t matter, and the work \nitself has the name.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
