But it is in your mind, not Tim&#39;s. The\nopacity axiom applies to *software*. One should not write software that\nbreaks when the form of an HTTP URI changes. It&#39;s like not writing a\nfunction that breaks when its first argument is a variable named &quot;foo&quot;\ninstead of one named &quot;bar&quot;. You don&#39;t own the caller&#39;s namespace and\nshould make no assumptions about it. Similarly client and intermediary\nsoftware does not own the server&#39;s namespace and should make no\nassumptions about it.\n\nTim was talking about a *human* reading the URI. That&#39;s why he said that\nit is a &quot;clue&quot;. He&#39;s talking about the Web equivalent to variable naming\nconventions. As in, you SHOULD use m_ as a member prefix because this\nwill make reading your code simpler. But I would kill you if you sent me\na piece of software that depended upon member variables starting with\nm_. So variable names are opaque, except when they aren&#39;t, in exactly\nthe same way.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
