As has been described elsewhere the resource-centric\napproach allows the use of existing ACL-based security - I&#39;m interested in\nthe influence this has on the resource model. A concrete example, as always,\nis a good thing....\n\nLets say our requirements for a medical system include the ability to attach\ndocuments to a patient record e.g. specialists reports, police and social\nworkers investigations, etc. This is quite a natural thing for a REST-based\nsystem to handle, with each of the documents being linked to from the main\npatient record. Adding attachments would simply be a matter of a POST to the\npatient record URI of an xml-structure containing the link to where the\ndocument resides. A similar approach can be taken to change or delete the\nlink (i.e. PUT & DELETE). (Note that attachments are not identified as a\nsub-resource in their own right as they are simply links and as such it is\nnot really necessary to expose them separately).\n\nNow the security issues come into play. Suppose that for obvious reasons you\nwant to be able to restrict who can add, update or delete particular types \nof attachments.\nWithout having individual sub-resources for each of the types in question\nthere appears to be no way to setup this style of security using ACL. If you\ndo choose the sub-resources approach, what happens when your security\nrequirements change? Do you then have to change your resources to match?\n\nIs there something I am missing in my understanding of the use of ACL in\nREST, as this approach appears too fragile and inter-dependant for my liking?\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n"}}
