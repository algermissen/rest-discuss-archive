They have parts and those parts have syntax,\nand those parts also have semantic relationships with each other.  However, due perhaps\nto some early failures in putting *inappropriate* information into URI, we&#39;ve apparently\ndecided as a Web community to chuck the endeavor entirely.  And some (at least) among us\nhave done this in relative ignorance of current research regarding semantic naming in\nother more-or-less analogous contexts.\n\n&gt; http://foo.com/~joeuser/archive/www.att.com/1999/04/19\n&gt;\n&gt; This would best be;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://foo.com/~joeuser/archive?host=&quot;www.att.com&quot;&date=&quot;1999/04/19&quot;\n&gt; etc..\n\nI fail entirely to see why this is objectively preferable to the former.  It&#39;s got more\nsyntax, that&#39;s for sure. ;-)  OTOH, a &quot;smart&quot; namespace manager might provide all of the\nfollowing as potential well-formed synonyms for the object of interest:\n\nhttp://foo.com/~joeuser/archive/www.att.com/1999/04/19\nhttp://foo.com/~joeuser/www.att.com/archive/1999/04/19\nhttp://foo.com/~joeuser/1999/04/19/archive/www.att.com\nhttp://foo.com/~joeuser/1999/04/19/www.att.com/archive\n\nThe Principle of Explicit Transparency\n----------------------------------------------\n\nMark, in your opacity investigation you state that you believe the Opacity Axiom to be\nfundamental because it forces &quot;publishers to be explicit about the relationships between\ntheir resources through any mechanism that allows them to state those relationships.&quot;  I\ntotally buy that this is desirable...  however that doesn&#39;t mean that URI cannot be\n*other* than opaque.  How about this for a relaxed statement:\n\n&quot;URI are required (modulo existing exceptions to this rule in RFC2396) to be treated by\nall parties other than publishers as if they were opaque, except when the publisher is\nexplicit about the relationships between those resources and the names they may have\nthrough any mechanism that allows them to state those relationships and rules for forming\nnames.  In all cases, URI are required to be treated as opaque by any party to an\ninteraction other than the ultimate endpoints involved.&quot;\n\nI.e., publishers could easily provide to others generative grammars or other mechanisms\nthat would allow them to construct well-formed and meaningful references without a-priori\nrequiring a link to some root in the site&#39;s namespace.\n\nIndeed, relaxing opacity would allow for easier introduction and proliferation of naming\nschemes which deviate from the traditional hierarchical containers-and-objects metaphor.\nThe explicit information about the organization of the (name)space could be used to\ndescribe the specific relationships of the various syntactic parts, just like RFC2396\ndoes but in a machine-processible fashion.  The kinds of problems you were discussing\nearlier re: mapping to the relational model might be more easily addressed by allowing\napplications to define what the relationship between parts separated by &#39;/&#39; is intended\nto be.  A particular application might treat these parts as order-independent sets and\n&#39;/&#39; as set-theoretic intersection, and explicit information about this would allow\napplications to construct their own &quot;queries&quot; against this namespace.\n\nThat&#39;s my story for tonite, I&#39;m sticking to it. ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
