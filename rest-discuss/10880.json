So if the server responds to a DELETE with 404,\nwhat it’s saying is that the DELETE was a no-op: there was no\nresource bound to that URI before, and there isn’t one now.\n\n2xx is the right response to DELETE when the server wants to say\n“this URI used to be bound to a resource, but at your request, it\nno longer is.” In other words, 2xx is the status to return in the\ncase of an actual, successful deletion.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
