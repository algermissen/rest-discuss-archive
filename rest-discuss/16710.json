What URIs to have wget fetch, are determined by the text\nconfiguration files (patches, prerequisite packages, options etc.).\n\nIf a URI is unavailable, an alternate is selected and processing\ncontinues -- the user selecting these application state transitions\nexpressed as URIs, is the installer process (i.e. ports/pkgsrc), no\nhuman involved except to select options and initiate the installer (via\nhypertext API of course).\n\nThe media type of each patch tells us the encoding of its tarball, not\nthat when extracted it&#39;s part of a numbered set of patches for some\nother tarball.  This processing model may be standards-worthy -- as a\nmultipart media type which allows each tarball to be a set of alternate\nlinks in order of preference (or via net heuristic), and establishes\nthe order in which the patches are to be applied.\n\nJust a thought -- while a RESTful-m2m fork of pkgsrc would be fun, I\nhardly have the time.  Instead of downloading a tree of stub files, the\ninstaller dereferences the package manifest of the requested package\nfrom some host, the representation is this new multipart media type,\nwhich defines the sender&#39;s intended processing model -- guiding the\ninstaller&#39;s use of wget as its agent, extracting and patching together\nthe returned tarballs.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
