This is largely due to the\nfact that REST is specific to HTTP (i.e. HTTP has an action header\nthat can be used for the same purpose, or an associated URI) whereas\nWeb services are multi-protocol and therefore need all information to\nbe contained within the envelope. Some of the fundamental differences\nresult from these different assumptions: REST assumes HTTP while WS-*\nassumes protocol neutrality. Others result from the fact that HTTP\nintentionally designs out features of existing IT systems (e.g.\nsession based security, transaction coordination, reliability, etc.)\nand that the WS-* specifications basically amount to an attempt to put\nthem back in.&quot;\n\n\nfunniest quotes\n\n&quot;the major goal of WS-* is interoperability and if you don&#39;t need\ninteroperability you don&#39;t really need WS-*.&quot;\n\nAnd, after much praise of WS-Addressing and its rapid standardisation\n(==the reality that there are 3-4 different versions out there, and\nWS-DM 1.0 depends on two different versions), finally a note that\n&quot;there was consensus surrounding EPRs was that vendors should show\ncare in using EPRs&quot;\n\nso, lots of interesting papers, but this summary is pretty\ndisappointing. I wonder if this was the actual outcome of the\nworkshop, or merely the opinons of those who volunteered to write it\nup. As it is, it is more a &quot;there are some problems with WS-*, but we\ncan fix them&quot; rather than some discussion on how best to use REST as\nan architecture for behind-the-firewall systems.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
