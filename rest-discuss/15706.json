UDDI is =\r\nstill present in some middleware, and the idea is for you to publish the en=\r\nterprise web services in a repository and handle information about statisti=\r\ncs, sanity and such for governance. One great example for public repository=\r\n would be Amazon web services. They may have published all the services usi=\r\nng an UDDI server, but the way you access is reading the documentation and =\r\ndownloading the SDKs. See?\n\nStill, all that falls into developers hands, an=\r\nd those are not as happy with discovery and dynamic binding, so in general =\r\nall was done static. That means the WSDL is the least published thing in th=\r\ne world. Usually, you create a class with a method. Then you ask your IDE t=\r\no generate a WSDL for that method to be called (RPC), then you copy the WSD=\r\nL and ask you IDE to generate a client stub, and then you forget about WSDL=\r\n!\n\nFor publishing services, you may get the WSDL sending the wsdl parameter=\r\n in the service URI to get the WSDL, or you can request it by email. \n\nI su=\r\nggest you to look at the current middleware products, and do a quick resear=\r\nch to list the current repository methods and protocols.\n\nCheers.\n\nWilliam =\r\nMartinez Pomares\n \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Sean Kennedy &lt;sean=\r\ndkennedy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;     I work in academia so would be grateful =\r\nfor the industry perspective. I am working on a thesis which includes both =\r\nWS-* and REST. If UDDI is in fact dead http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2010/03=\r\n/uddi_rip.html how are enterprises communicating the WSDL files? Are we tal=\r\nking email, publishing on a Web site, inserting into a db??\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; =\r\nSean.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS Would the same apply for WADL files?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
