The HttpRequest class has a PathInfo property. The\nproblem\n&gt; (to me) is the &quot;.asp&quot; in the middle of the path. IIS uses extensions (and\n&gt; only extensions) to route requests to the appropriate ISAPI DLL. Is it\njust\n&gt; me or doesn&#39;t it seem like Microsoft is afraid of regular expressions?\nYeah - Sun did the same thing with JSP. It used to work, then it didn&#39;t. I\nmight be able to get pathInfo() to work in a JSP if I re-map the URI for the\nJSP into a servlet (or something) via the config file for that application -\nbut I hate digging through config file formats.\n\n\n\n"}}
