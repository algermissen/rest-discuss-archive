Why not just\nopen connections to the relevent servers whenever\nthey connect?  Edge class machines probably won&#39;t\nhave too many subscriptions in any case.\n\n&gt; * The servers at the center of a persistent-GET topography would still need\n&gt; notifications.  The persistent GET at the last mile wouldn&#39;t have anything to\n&gt; persistently GET otherwise.\n\nWhy?  The server exposes a URL that represents\nthe stream of notification messages.\n\n&gt; That said, I agree that persistent GET is the one solution for nodes behind\n&gt; firewalls.  ...both persistent GET and http notifications are needed.\n\nAgain, I don&#39;t see why.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
