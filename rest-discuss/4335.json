The values in the set may be resource\n: &gt; representations and/or resource identifiers.\n: \n: That&#39;s my definition for a resource within a REST-based information\n: system.  That is because such a system creates an interface that\n: causes that mapping to be the only observable definition of a resource.\n: What the resource actually *is*, within a larger scope, is a different\n: topic.\n: \n: &gt; This leads me to a conclusion I don&#39;t like: Two resources that are\n: &gt; owl:sameAs must respond to the same requests at the same time with the\n: &gt; same representations, because the resource *is* the membership\n: &gt; function.\n: \n: That depends on what you mean by &quot;is&quot;.  ;-)\n\nOkay, that covers the case where the HTTP + OWL scope is to\nbe considered a &quot;larger scope&quot; than REST, and so the true definition\nof &quot;resource&quot; lies elsewhere, perhaps.\n\nBut even scoped to REST, where does one find in Roy&#39;s definition\nof resource a promise that two clients will ever receive identical\nrepresentations of a single resource?  The fact that they are dereferencing\nthe same mapping is not enough to constitute such a promise.  Hence\nhow do you test the assertion &lt;/resource1&gt; &lt;owl:sameAs&gt; &lt;/resource2&gt;, \nand what good is it in the design of systems if it cannot be tested?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
