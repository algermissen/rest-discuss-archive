At least starting with Frege,\n&gt;\n&gt;   (Vx)(x = x)\n&gt;\n&gt; has been taken as a logical truth. IOW, *everything* has identity. Or to\n&gt; quote Quine, &quot;No entity without identity&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seeing as RFC 2396 is coming up for revision I think now would be a good\n&gt; time to get rid of this silliness once and for all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Miles\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
