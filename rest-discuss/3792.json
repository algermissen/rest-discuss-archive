Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; cookie-based and HTTP auth are identical when the\n&gt;&gt; client is software.  The only difference is the\n&gt;&gt; name of the HTTP header in which the\n&gt;&gt; authentication token is passed.  But really the\n&gt;&gt; whole premise of HTTP auth is unreasonable for\n&gt;&gt; automated clients.  Clients just send a secret\n&gt;&gt; token.  They don&#39;t need a mnemonic separating\n&gt;&gt; usernames from passwords.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For human users, the login form that comes in the\n&gt;&gt; 401 response is as visible as you want.  In\n&gt;&gt; practice Mozilla appears to auto-fill most login\n&gt;&gt; forms I reach correctly and without issue which\n&gt;&gt; makes me think that visibility is a non-issue.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm.  I thought visibility was about the ability of\n&gt; components/intermediaries to understand the meaning of the message.\n&gt; I.e., a proxy can&#39;t tell whether or not a cookie contains auth info\n&gt; since it doesnt know the syntax of what&#39;s been packed in the cookie.\n&gt; However, it does know what the HTTP auth header means, and thus knows\n&gt; what it can or cant do with the message (and its response).  (This all\n&gt; may be moot as far as auth headers and cookies go since I think many\n&gt; proxies wont cache things with cookies in them).\n&gt;\n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, 24 Jul 2003, Chuck Hinson wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Alex Jacobson wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --On Wednesday, July 23, 2003 2:53 PM -0700 &quot;Roy T.

That is why\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality in another field?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With all due respect, given that HTTP authentication is fundamentally\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; broken*, that cookies are a defacto standard, and that HTTP-auth is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poorly supported by actual UAs.  The bigger question is why duplicate\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cookie functionality with auth-specific headers?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I would think that while cookies may be a defacto standard, cookie-based\n&gt;&gt;&gt; authentication is not (i.e., there is no standard implementation of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; authentication using cookies).  Thus, it would seem to me that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; visibility still suffers.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --Chuck\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
