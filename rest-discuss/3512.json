Must&#39;ve outsourced the\nmarketing literature...\n\n===\nSpeakers\n Ed Bratt Sun Microsystems\n\nAbstract\nThis presentation compares and contrasts Web service integration styles as\ndescribed by Relational State Transfer (REST) and SOAP-based Web services.\nAdvantages and challenges of each style are compared and integration\nexamples are reviewed in the context of the Sun TM Open Net Environment (Sun\nONE) platform Integration Server. Is it really possible to use GET and PUT\nexclusively to integrate both with and across my firewall? What do I gain by\nusing the traditional Web service architecture approach? These and other\nissues are presented.\n\n\n"}}
