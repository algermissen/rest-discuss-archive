Web\n&gt; applications that need long lived streams imply a less scalable web!\nI sort of agree - apps that just won&#39;t work without long-lived streams are\ngoing to suffer, but allowing long-lived streams is a nice optimization that\nimproves scalability (from a performance point of view).\n\n\n"}}
