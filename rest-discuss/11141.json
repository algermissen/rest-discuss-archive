Suddenly you =\r\nimpose having an xml parser and\n&gt;&gt; other semantics in a container format an=\r\nd get dragged into\n&gt;&gt; wrapping your content-types within yet another conten=\r\nt-type to\n&gt;&gt; manage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure. All I&#39;m saying is that people *will* misuse =\r\nit and trying\n&gt; to ward that off is not going to achieve anything.\n\nI inter=\r\nact with people who are very knowledgeable in what they do.\nWhat they do is=\r\n not REST, so that&#39;s something they&#39;re not\nknowledgeable about, and with al=\r\nl the constraints they have to deal\nwith, they often don&#39;t even have time t=\r\no find out where to learn more\nabout it.  So they end up picking soundbytes=\r\n without proper context,\nand often applying them wrong.\n\nMuch the same way =\r\nI wrongly apply technologies I don&#39;t know much\nabout.  So I ask them to tea=\r\nch me about their area of expertise, and I\ntake the time to teach them as m=\r\nuch as I can of what I know.  And just\nthis little act, repeated a few time=\r\ns over, can save a lot of people\nfrom misusing technologies.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The so-c=\r\nalled reuse of content-types that atom provides is an\n&gt;&gt; illusion as  your =\r\nentities will still need to exist in a format\n&gt;&gt; you have to define.\n&gt;\n&gt; I =\r\nwasn&#39;t referring to that. The same thing that applies to HTTP\n&gt; messages ap=\r\nplies to Atom Entries: to maximise serendipity the\n&gt; content needs to be in=\r\n a commonly understood format, not an\n&gt; application-specific one. AtomPub c=\r\nhanges nothing about this.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Saying the complexity is being absorbed by =\r\nthe frameworks is\n&gt;&gt; like saying  transactions will magically all scale bec=\r\nause we\n&gt;&gt; have WS-AtomicTransactions. It&#39;s not true, it requires more and\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; more layers of tools and toolkits and increase the price you\n&gt;&gt; pay for =\r\nyour first shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to be clear, I never said any of that. I like Ato=\r\nmPub\n&gt; because it&#39;s a nice protocol to directly code against, without\n&gt; any=\r\n abstraction layers.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Be it in flash, XHR or plain Html forms, atom is =\r\nnot supported,\n&gt;&gt; and it  should probably never be.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t be so qu=\r\nick to make that judgement=85\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want to pass atom because the for=\r\nmat makes sense and the\n&gt;&gt; client negotiated, that is quite fine. If you pa=\r\nss everything\n&gt;&gt; wrapped in ATOM saying that somehow putting an entity in a=\r\nn xml\n&gt;&gt; feed is fine, in the name of so-called commoditization of\n&gt;&gt; frame=\r\nworks (something that companies that have been known to\n&gt;&gt; *create* the WS-=\r\n* mess are now pushing very hardly for), and\n&gt;&gt; not even providing other al=\r\nternate content types that make\n&gt;&gt; sense, is going against the simplicity a=\r\nnd capability discovery\n&gt;&gt; that REST support out of the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; People hav=\r\ne been abusing HTTP in that exact fashion for a very\n&gt; long time. It&#39;s harm=\r\nful, but to the perpetrators more than the\n&gt; wider web as a whole.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wou=\r\nld you wrap a jpeg file in an atom entry and base64 it? So\n&gt;&gt; why do it wit=\r\nh anything else but namespaced composable xml\n&gt;&gt; languages, of which very f=\r\new are actually composeable?\n&gt;\n&gt; No, of course not. AtomPub is explicitly d=\r\nesigned to allow using\n&gt; any Content-Type, not just Atom.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s not at=\r\n all how I meant my remark anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I meant is that it&#39;s RESTful sy=\r\nstems work better when\n&gt; representations are of generic media types, even w=\r\nhen the generic\n&gt; media type is not an exact fit for the application and ma=\r\ny be\n&gt; more complex than the application&#39;s immediate needs demand. Just\n&gt; i=\r\nn the same way, having fewer application protocols is better\n&gt; even when th=\r\ne protocol in question may not be an exact fit for\n&gt; each application and m=\r\night be more complex than the application&#39;s\n&gt; immediate needs require.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nOf course, this doesn&#39;t mean that application/octet-stream is the\n&gt; best ch=\r\noice of media type. So too does having fewer protocols not\n&gt; mean that usin=\r\ng a single one for every last thing is a good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both absence and ab=\r\nundance of diversity are harmful.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for Assaf&#39;s comparison to WS-*, th=\r\ne fact is that it is both\n&gt; practical to write code directly against AtomPu=\r\nb (which was never\n&gt; even a consideration in the design of WS-*) *and* like=\r\nly to\n&gt; achieve very good interoperability on the first try. (The interop\n&gt;=\r\n meetups of early implementers demonstrated that very clearly; the\n&gt; major =\r\npain point was HTTP Auth, not AtomPub per se.) Comparing\n&gt; AtomPub to the W=\r\nS-* stack is therefore a mere rhetorical device;\n&gt; in absolute terms, there=\r\n is a vast chasm in complexity between\n&gt; the two.\n\nI do use WS-* as a rheto=\r\nrical device.  And separate from SOAP (the\nliteral part), which I think did=\r\n a good job saving us from\nmultiplicity of, sometimes badly designed, envel=\r\noping wire formats,\nall targeted at the same problem set.  It&#39;s pretty good=\r\n at solving the\n&quot;less content type&quot; problem, and it&#39;s very easy to code aga=\r\ninst.\n\nSOAP expanded into WS-* because, instead of limiting where it should=\r\n,\nwhat it should be used for and keeping to the simple thing that could\npos=\r\nsibly work, it became The Answer.  Apply liberally.  It doesn&#39;t do\neverythi=\r\nng, but because it&#39;s The Answer, you just keep lumping until\nyou end up rei=\r\nnventing REST and XMPP whatnot into the WS-* stack.\n\nI don&#39;t want to see At=\r\nomPub going there.  I&#39;m not saying it is, I&#39;m\nsaying, let&#39;s make sure it do=\r\nesn&#39;t.  We should be critical in where we\nuse it, and we should help other =\r\npeople apply the same critical\nthinking.  And sometimes the answer is &quot;yes,=\r\n use AtomPub&quot; and\nsometimes the answer is &quot;no, don&#39;t&quot;.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And I th=\r\nink AtomPub hits a sweetspot in that respect. It is\n&gt; complex enough to be =\r\nuseful for *a LOT* of use cases (a lot more\n&gt; than a simple application/x-w=\r\nww-url-encoded protocol would be),\n&gt; but it still doesn&#39;t try cover them *a=\r\nll*, and in this way it\n&gt; does =96 IMO anyway =96 avoid being prohibitively=\r\n complex for the\n&gt; simple cases, while offering them the advantages of conf=\r\normity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
