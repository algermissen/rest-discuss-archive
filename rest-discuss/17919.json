I realize and\nbasically agree that URL:s should be opaque. But the question of how\ntrailing slashes can/should be handled (or not) could make a REST\nservice easier to use for a developer. It also has consequences for\nhow a client can follow (relative) links.\n\nOne could interpret:\n\n   GET /books\n\nas getting a resource representing all books; basically a summary of\nthe &quot;books&quot; resource and:\n\n   GET /books/\n\nas getting a list of all resources &quot;contained&quot; in /books, ie\nsub-resources, in the form of a list of URL:s to all individual book\nresources.\n\nBut it feels like introducing out-of-band knowledge/conventions. I\nguess an orthodox restafarian would make no assumptions at all and\nsimply treat &quot;/books&quot; and &quot;/books/&quot; as two completely different\nresources which just happen to have identifiers that differ in a\nsingle character.\n\nComments?\n\n/Paul\n\n-- \nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
