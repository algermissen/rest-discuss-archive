How else can you explicitly set state and have\n&gt; &gt; intermediaries know about it (so they can cache it)?  You can&#39;t do that\n&gt; &gt; with POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this intermediary argument realistic? Let&#39;s say I&#39;m going through a\n&gt; big honking cache at AOL. I do a PUT. Now all AOL users in the world\n&gt; have an updated view of the world because our cache recorded the PUT.\n&gt; But everyone else in the universe is out of date. Why should AOL users\n&gt; get a priviledged view of the world?\n\nIt only takes one person at MSN to do a GET on that same resource, and\nfor MSN to cache that response, to have the same effect.\n\nThis is a really small advantage in a write-few/read-many environment.\nI wouldn&#39;t worry about it.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
