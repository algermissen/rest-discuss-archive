Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t consider it that annoying that clients have to remember\n&gt;&gt;mappings.  When you design so that state is not stored on the server,\n&gt;&gt;naturally it will have to be stored elsewhere-- it&#39;s part of the\n&gt;&gt;client&#39;s job.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have 40M+ resources, so I wasn&#39;t considering this as feasible.\n&gt; I also think that HTTP indicates that part of a server&#39;s job for handling\n&gt; PUT is for the client to be able to specify the URI.\n\nI wasn&#39;t suggesting you store all your resources on the client, so \nperhaps we misunderstand each other.  I&#39;m not sure what your meaning is \nin that second sentence.\n\n&gt;&gt;In any case, you can make this plan more robust as follows: when the\n&gt;&gt;server creates a record for a new document, also store the digest of the\n&gt;&gt;request that caused it.  Then, if it receives a duplicate request from\n&gt;&gt;the client, ignore it and return the exiting resource location.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not really worried about duplicate requests - the behavior would be to\n&gt; determine if the submitted content already had been submitted before. Either\n&gt; via the URI having the client-managed identifier or having the content\n&gt; contain the client-managed identifier.\n\nThat&#39;s surprising to me.  From your original post, case c:\n\n    - requests can be safely re-tried. Bonus.\n\n From what I gathered, you hadn&#39;t considered that this could be covered \nin case b also.\n\n&gt;&gt;Also, assuming that input documents are not shared, the server could\n&gt;&gt;provide a query function that returns the output resource given an input\n&gt;&gt;resource URL.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would that look like? It&#39;d be a compound URI, right? Whatever it would\n&gt; look like, I hadn&#39;t considered two resources - one for the stored input\n&gt; document and one with references to the synthesized output document, but in\n&gt; order to know about this second resource either the client generates that\n&gt; resource identifier or that identifer is contained in a representation of\n&gt; the stored input document - and I might as well point to the synthesized\n&gt; output document directly.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where your concern comes from, as this is exactly what \nqueries are for.  For example:\n\n   GET /myapp/outputs?input=/myapp/inputs/a98a6799 HTTP/1.1\n   Host: example.net\n\n   HTTP/1.1 302 Found\n   Location: http://example.net/myapp/outputs/14f322410\n\nThis is exactly the same as going to &lt;http://example.net/myapp/outputs&gt;, \nentering &quot;/myapp/inputs/a98a6799&quot; in the &quot;input&quot; field of a form, and \nbeing automatically redirected to \n&lt;http://example.net/myapp/outputs/14f322410&gt;.\n\n-John\n\n-- \nhttp://giftfile.org/  ::  giftfile project\n\n"}}
