What idioms are \n&gt; people using to add (and remove) items to the collection, or in\n&gt; general tell a server to relate two resources?\n&gt; \n\nI consider this a &quot;tagging&quot; problem.  Assuming /document/bar is Atom, I\nwould GET it, and PUT it back with the following line added:\n\n&lt;category term=&#39;foo&#39;/&gt;\n\nActually, I use PATCH and &#39;application/atomcat+xml&#39; to add and remove\ntags, but PUT can also be used to remove &lt;category/&gt; tags. The &#39;scheme&#39;\nattribute contains the /collection/ path, while the /document/ path is\nimplicit in the request URI.\n\nThe server logic is written such that /collection/foo is a stored search\nfor documents containing &lt;category term=&#39;foo&#39;/&gt;.  This search is re-\nexecuted and given a new Etag as required by the server, which detects\nre-tagging in PUT (or PATCH) requests.\n\nSince no resources are being created or deleted in tagging operations,\nI wouldn&#39;t use POST or DELETE at all.  But this solution is still REST,\nand Atom Protocol (except for the PATCH bit).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
