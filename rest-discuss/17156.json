By adding\n&gt; layers of RDFa onto HTML the API becomes more difficult to =\r\nconsume\n&gt; compared to a straight forward XML format. If I present a REST AP=\r\nI to\n&gt; my customers that makes it (a lot) more difficult to consume than a\n=\r\n&gt; SOAP API then I loose some of my selling points.\n&gt; \n\nWhat I&#39;ve been tryin=\r\ng to explain, is that RDFa exists separately from\nthe REST API.  Complexity=\r\n ensues when the solution to m2m is the\ncreation of custom media types boun=\r\nd to the nature of the data -- REST\nsays it&#39;s simpler to use a generic medi=\r\na type, and solve m2m at another\nlayer.\n\nThe point of REST is that the &quot;eas=\r\ne of consumption&quot; isn&#39;t tied to the\napplication stack, like SOAP is -- do S=\r\nOAP solutions work in general,\nor do they only work for the particular vend=\r\nor stack they target?  I\nsuppose &quot;ease of consumption&quot; is a selling point, =\r\nbut only for coupling.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am probably wrong though - I do not think Fie=\r\nldings thesis says\n&gt; anything about being simple, but that certainly is par=\r\nt of the\n&gt; percived goodness of REST amongst most people.\n&gt; \n\nThe thesis de=\r\nfines simplicity here:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/=\r\nnet_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3_3\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
