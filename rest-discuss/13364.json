The REST-* community \naims to re-examine which of these traditional services fits within the \nREST model by defining new standards, guidelines, and specifications. \nWhere appropriate, any end product will be published at the IETF.&quot;\n\n__Governance changes__\n* No more trying to be a better JCP.  We&#39;ll let the IETF RFC process \ngovern us when we&#39;re ready to submit something.\n* An open source contributor agreement similar to what Apache, Eclipse \nor JBoss has to protect users and contributors.\n\n(FYI we already required ASL, open source processes, NO-field-of-use \nrestrictions, etc...)\n\nIf you have any other suggestions, let me know:\n\nhttp://www.jboss.org/reststar/community/gov2.html\n\n\n__RESTful Interfaces for Un-RESTful Services__\n\nMany traditional middleware services do not fit into the RESTful style \nof development.  An example is 2PC transaction management.  Still, these \nservices can benefit from having their distributed interface defined \nRESTfully.  The nomenclature will be RESTful Service vs. RESTful Interface.\n\n* 2PC transactions would be considered a RESTful interface under \nREST-*.org.  Meaning using it makes your stuff less-RESTful, but at \nleast the service has a restful interface.\n\n* Messaging, compensations, and workflow services would be considered \n&quot;RESTful Services&quot; that fit in the model.\n\n__GUIDELINES SECTION__\n\nThis is where I want to talk about how existing patterns, RFC&#39;s and such \nfit in with the rest of what we&#39;re doing.  An example here could be \nSecurity.  What authentication models are good when?  When should you \nuse OAuth and OpenID?  How could something like OAuth interact with \nmiddleware services?\n\nSome of this stuff is already up on the website. (You may have to reload \nit to see it due to cache-control policies.)\n\nFinally, apologies for the jboss.org redirection.  It is a problem with \nour infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
