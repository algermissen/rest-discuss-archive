Having a mechanism that can simultaneously\n&gt; allow existing browser to render stuff prettily and app specific\n&gt; consumers to request the specific document types might be worth it.\n&gt; \n\nThe major &quot;browsers we have&quot; these days come with XSLT built-in.  It\nisn&#39;t too difficult to attach an XSLT transformation to any ad-hoc XML\ndocument, causing browsers to transform and render it as HTML.  Non-\nbrowsers interested in the underlying document can just skip the\nXML PI.\n\nThere are existing MIME types which support this, no need to define a\nnew one for each application of XML.  Content negotiation can also be\nused, where a client that groks application/vnd.foo+xml gets that,\nwhile other clients are served an HTML representation.  Browsers also\nsupport an extension mechanism, where a plugin handles the rendering of\napplication/vnd.foo+xml...\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
