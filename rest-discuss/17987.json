We&#39;re (hopefully) going to h=\r\nave a collection of many services in multiple domains and we&#39;ll be expected=\r\n to have a standard &#39;template&#39; for defining/documenting a service. I&#39;m curi=\r\nous if anyone in an &quot;enterprise&quot; situation has run into that and has any ad=\r\nvice.\n&gt;\n\nHi Carlos,\nIf your intent is to document REST services for people =\r\nthat might develop clients of those services, WADL isn&#39;t an option as it wo=\r\nuld lead to unrestful coupling. One reason is that WADL specifies the URIs =\r\n(or URI templates) for your resources. While communicating such information=\r\n between services and clients dynamically at run-time is fine, communicatin=\r\ng it at design time will lead clients to hardcode it, which will make them =\r\nbreak when it changes. This is probably the biggest unrestful documentation=\r\n pattern I see around these days for Web API that are supposedly RESTful.\n\n=\r\nWhen documenting my own REST services I&#39;ve found a lot of interesting inspi=\r\nration in the documentation for the SUN Cloud API at http://kenai.com/proje=\r\ncts/suncloudapis/pages/Home (still, this doc isn&#39;t perfect as it over-speci=\r\nfies a few things).\n\nThere is also this quote from Roy Fielding that is use=\r\nful when planning for documentation: \n&quot;A REST API should spend almost all o=\r\nf its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representin=\r\ng resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation=\r\n names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types. =\r\nAny effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest sh=\r\nould be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a med=\r\nia type (and, in most cases, already defined by existing media types)&quot;. (cf=\r\n http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven).\n\nB=\r\nest,\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n"}}
