It was the notion that applications would run in the\nnetwork. That the user interface could be downloaded and used on the fly on\nany Internet-connected device (most likely a PC), and that substantial\nportions of the application --- in particular those that were focused on\nlogic and data --- could be exposed and used by other applications easily.\n\nI love the idea of being able to use a high-quality, desktop-like,\nmedia-rich software application over the Internet --- to have a means to\nhave that application cached on my local computer; to work offline; to\nsynchronize new versions when needed, and the ability to easily consume and\nintegrate logic and data in other applications on the network. &quot;\n\nThis is a concise description of the kinds of problems that REST-based\nsystems are good at solving.\nForget the HTML/browser mess that we have today - build for the future.\nSolve these problems with clean design and strong automation capabilities.\n\n"}}
