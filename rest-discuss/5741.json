In this case, resources are hidden\n&gt; behind a single URI, therefore it&#39;s hard to identify them explicitly.\n&gt;   \nSee, I think this is where we are coming from two points of view.  You \nare saying that these are separate resources.  I am saying that they are \nfacets of the same resource.  For you, there is a need to have separate \nURIs, which is expected when you have more than one resource.  For me, \nonly one URI was needed since I was saying it&#39;s all one resource.\n&gt; For instance, when I use conneg to retrieve the p3p document and\n&gt; bookmark the URI; after a month Joe or I follow the same URI, I may\n&gt; get back a HTML homepage.\n&gt;   \nYou shouldn&#39;t get back an HTML document if you asked for the p3p \ndocument.  If you didn&#39;t ask for the p3p document the second time, then \nit means that your bookmark doesn&#39;t also track the content-type you \nasked for in the first place.  The limitation of the bookmarking tool \ndoes not mean that conneg is the problem.\n\nSeairth\n\n"}}
