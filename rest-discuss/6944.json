I thought\nI heard that to be RESTful you needed to PUT/POST an entire representation,\nnot just part of it. So using fragments would theoretically not give you the\nentire resource and thus be non RESTful?\n\nAlso on the web isn&#39;t a fragment just a bookmark (a pointer) as opposed to a\nportion of a resource where the URI sans fragment points to the entire\nresource?  If so, wouldn&#39;t that make it invalid it use a fragment to get at\njust a small part of a resource? And don&#39;t clients process fragments as\nopposed to servers too?\n \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
