Imagine two interfaces that\n&gt; &gt; the universities *may* implement:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (1) http://university.edu/ws/list - returns a list of links to each student.\n&gt; &gt; (2) http://university.edu/ws/search - accepts a keyword and returns a list\n&gt; &gt; of links to each student that contains &#39;keyword&#39; in it&#39;s name.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sample response:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;students&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;student link=&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/001&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;student link=&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/002&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;student link=&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/003&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/students&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since each university might implement neither, one or both interfaces,\n&gt; &gt; I would like to define a way for each university to &quot;say&quot; which\n&gt; &gt; interfaces they implement... something like WSDL, that would allow\n&gt; &gt; automatic service discovery among universities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there any standard way of doing this within the REST arch. style?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; S�rgio Nunes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
