And I also agree that if you are trying to\n&gt; make &quot;copy&quot; the semantics of PUTing to a URI, that URI should represent a\n&gt; container of object for which the method would act.  However, I think this\n&gt; creates a conflict with a normal semantics of PUTing to a noun resource.\n\nYes, I agree with you.  This is a concern of mine, and one of the reasons I&#39;ve\nasked the group about their thoughts on it.  What I really wanted to do was\ncreate a way for people to easily invoke behavior on any node accessible to\nthem.  So here would be some example code on how that is done:\n\n  CMethod order_parts(&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/order&quot;);\n  CStringTable params;\n  params.addItem(&quot;partNumber&quot;, &quot;01234&quot;);\n  order_parts.execute(params);\n\nThe above URI is clearly *not* a noun resource, unless you see the method as a\nnoun resource that can be invoked like a verb.  Bit of a stretch.  In general,\nmy aim is to make it easy as possible for programmers to invoke behavior in\ntheir distributed while being as RESTful as possible.  I guess what people are\nadvocating is something more like this:\n\n  CMethod order_parts(&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/01234&quot;);\n  CStringTable params;\n  params.addItem(&quot;action&quot;, &quot;order&quot;)\n  order_parts.doPost(params);\n\nIf this is more RESTful, then it would be easy to refactor my method concept to\nwork this way.  Is there a more RESTful way to approach this example?\n\n&gt; Not being certain how often one would want to copy method code to another\n&gt; node in this way, I would say that it might not be worth the trouble to\n&gt; support this semantic for PUTing to a verb/method URI.  A nice idea, though.\n\nTrue.  It seems that the concept is more relevant to resources (nouns).\n\n&gt; Again, please let us know when you&#39;re ready to reveal your toolkit as I am\n&gt; quite interested in how it works.\n\nThe only thing holding me back is making sure it&#39;s coherent enough for us to\nwork with.  Then I hope we can really sit down and hash through these concepts.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
