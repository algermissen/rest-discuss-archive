I \nthink the only way to constrain the meaning enough for the server to \nunderstand the client&#39;s intentions is via content-type.  If you can think \nof another constraint, please say so.\n\nIf you cannot provide another constraint, then you must conclude that \ncontent-type is the only way to constrain meaning, that the client must \nunderstand the content-type of the resource in order to POST to it, that \ntherefore HTTP is about transferring the resource-model via content-type \n(the MoST thesis is correct), and that the server may NOT arbitrarily \nreinterpret the meaning of HTTP methods in a way that is visible to the \nclient (the REST thesis is either vague or wrong).\n\nQED\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS I am heading to Burning Man tomorrow and will be off-grid for the next \n10 days so don&#39;t be offended if I don&#39;t reply.  If you are attending \nBurning Man as well, I&#39;d love to meet up.  I will be in  Camp \nDisorient/Ishkabibble at Esplanade and 10:00/Sacred.  I hope to see you \nthere.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
