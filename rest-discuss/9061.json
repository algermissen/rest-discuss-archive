You can&#39;t compromise unless you know what\n&gt; you are compromising between (the ideal and the possible).\n\nRight. I&#39;m trying to compromise only where I have to. Figure it&#39;ll\nsave trouble down the line.\n\n&gt; Digest?\n\nUm... I looked at it, and I can&#39;t remember now why it wouldn&#39;t work\ndown at the dumb browser (and dumb web server, as I just re-emphasized\nin my previous post) level. What Would Lynx Do?\n\n&gt; You can do that with Basic or Digest. Would be nice if we didn&#39;t have to\n&gt; do the hacky trick that&#39;s necessary with almost every browser (Lynx is\n&gt; the only one I can think of that has a proper log-out option by default).\n\nYou know, I didn&#39;t know you could log out with Lynx.\n\n&gt; Pretty heavy damage in most cases. This is a big scalability crippler in\n&gt; many systems.\n\nReally?  It&#39;s a database-intensive app already, so in a high-usage\nsituation you&#39;d already be dealing with multiple servers, and the\nsession database would be pretty trivial in comparison to other stuff.\n99% of the time, auth wouldn&#39;t be required so the server would be\nignoring the cookies and not making the lookup. Plus, Javascript would\nhijack the non-dumb browser and go to a properly-RESTful authen mode,\nso it&#39;s only going to be happening for the small percentage of people\nwithout JS.\n\n&gt; Security with these schemes is at best dependant upon you getting every\n&gt; right (assuming yet another problem with cookie security isn&#39;t found).\n\nYeah, it worries me a bit. I wish I knew either a lot more, or a lot\nless about security.\n\n&gt; The only reason for using cookie-based security is one is busy and lots\n&gt; of toolkits come with built-in support. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable for a\n&gt; developer to make that call IMO, but pretty crappy of the toolkits to\n&gt; have that flaw. I blame the toolkits, but not the developer.\n\nI think of it as a kludge, like overloaded POST, not to be used unless\nthere&#39;s nothing better. (And I started this thread because I really\nwant to be *sure* there&#39;s nothing better.)\n\n&gt; My first question on that score is &quot;why?&quot;\n\nBecause it&#39;s there!\n\n(Seriously? I&#39;m not serious. Other than a lot of the functionality of\nthe app will also be accessible by email, and probably some of the\ndecisions on how *that* works will be influenced by the architecture\nof the web side of it.)\n\n"}}
