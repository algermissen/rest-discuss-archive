To me, the\n&gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\n&gt; has identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\n&gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\n&gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n &gt; ...\n &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want\n &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be dragging\n &gt; any URI into court.\n\nYes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed \nmessages_ into courts. Let&#39;s say you have a very precise (specific) and \n  URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation. \nThen you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed. \nThe interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it \nin the database. You&#39;ll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally \nsigned message with the old value.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n\n"}}
