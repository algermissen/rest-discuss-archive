Message self- \n&gt; &gt; descriptiveness is an\n&gt; &gt; architectural constraint of REST and thus, if your messages are not \n&gt; &gt; self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; (aka standardized all the way through) your system does not comply \n&gt; &gt; with REST.\n&gt; I strongly disagree with this assertion. I don&#39;t have a link to Mark&#39;s\n&gt; article where he makes a claim that &quot;self-descriptive&quot; means\n&gt; &quot;standardized&quot; so I can&#39;t really refute it. But I do refute the\n&gt; assertion.\n\nWell, standard and standardised are two different words. REST constrains\ncontent types to be standard. Approximately, understood by everyone who\nwould want to understand it. In particular, not something you just made\nup for your own application. There need to be a bounded number of\ncontent types in the world relative to the number of applications. The\nnumber of content types should not increase in proprortion to the number\nof applications:\n\n�REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be\nself-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard\nmethods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange\ninformation, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability.�\n        �Roy Fielding\n\n&gt; As far as I can see, in the field, people are using mostly simple XML\n&gt; based systems and HTML based systems.\n\nI think that these nearly-RESTful implementations are an important\nprecursor to actual REST. They allow developers to get into the feel of\nhow RESTful systems will work and act as sampling points that can be\nused as the basis for the definition of standards.\n\nTo take a leaf from my REST Tutorial[1], these implementations have\nlearned lesson three. Four is the hardest and most social lesson to\nlearn on the way to conforming to REST&#39;s constraints. A lot of value is\nachieved without lesson four, but there is a difference between a lesson\nthree app and a lesson four app.\n\nBenjamin\n[1] \nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BenjaminsRESTTutorial\n\n\n\n\n"}}
