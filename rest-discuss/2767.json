The slides are at [1] - I&#39;d be\n&gt;interested in any feedback this group has to help me improve the talk. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks especially to all the participants in this group (which I&#39;ve been\n&gt;lurking in for ages now :-)) for helping to shape my thinking on REST &\n&gt;SOAP. I&#39;m hoping that RESTful SOAP will start to gain traction as people\n&gt;figure out that REST & SOAP can be complimentary and that RESTian\n&gt;thinking contains some important ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt;--Peter\n&gt;http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog\n&gt;http://staff.develop.com/peterd\n&gt;\n&gt;[1] http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2002/10/22.html#a362\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
