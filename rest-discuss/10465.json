There are \nonly 4 methods, using HTTP, 5 if you include patch and a few more if you use \nWebDav.  Those rarely map to object methods which are much more prolific in \nany domain model I have seen.  OO does not enforce REST constraints, so \ntrying to shoehorn and OO model into a REST approach is suboptimal at best.\n\nREST is not just resources per se, meaning URI-based addressing (which point \nto a conceptual resource), but also implies the representations that are \nreturned when you reference a resource (uring a URI). \n\nRepresentations could be a direct mapping from OO models, but are unlikely to \nfit the needs of more complex machine to machine integration scenarios, since \ndifferent systems will have different domain/object models, thus \nnecessitating transformations between them.  The better way to handle that is \ntypically to have a canonical representation format between systems.  It \nresolves the n-squared transformations issue if you don&#39;t go that way.\n\nBTW...my comments and focus tends to be oriented to the integration space, \nand not to the Web UI space, the latter being a much simpler issue to solve.\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
