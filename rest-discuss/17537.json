I&#39;m not firm on the new URL -=\r\n but say it&#39;s ws/users/{userid}/config/savedCriteria.  \n\nWhen an older clie=\r\nnt makes a request to ws/savedCriteria with an authenticated user =3D foous=\r\ner, should I return a 301 with ws/users/foouser/config/savedCriteria? Every=\r\n distinct user who requests ws/savedCriteria will be redirected to a differ=\r\nent URL, so a &quot;Moved Permanently&quot; seems not quite right.  However, 302 impl=\r\nies moved temporarily, which is also wrong.  303 looks technically correct =\r\nsince the RFC says, &quot;The new URI is not a substitute reference for the orig=\r\ninally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the res=\r\nponse to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.&quot;  However, I h=\r\nave never seen 303 used this way.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
