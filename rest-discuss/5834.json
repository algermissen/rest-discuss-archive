The naive RPC method would seem to be to\n&gt; create a special URL string for each type, e.g.:\n&gt;\n&gt; \t/convert.cgi?format=pdf&document=mydocument.html\n&gt; \t/convert.cgi?format=doc&document=mydocument.html\n&gt; etc.\n\nThat is confusing.  Why &quot;document=mydocument.html&quot;?  Is the server\ntranslating the input file or is it getting the file from somewhere\nelse?  I could understand a gateway form like\n\n    /convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/get_it_here.html\nor\n    /convert/http://example.com/get_it_here.html\n\nOTOH, a translation service like\n\n    /convert?format=pdf\n\ncan simply be a POST of file-upload with the response being the\nconverted representation.\n\n&gt; However, that doesn&#39;t seem very RESTful.\n\nWhy?  POST is RESTful too, when it is used correctly.\n\n&gt;  I would imagine the RESTful\n&gt; alternative would be to:\n&gt; a) PUT the initial resource; get a URL back\n&gt; b) &lt;do something to that URL&gt;\n&gt; c) Return the URL describing that resource\n&gt; d) GET the final resource\n&gt;\n&gt; But, if so, I can&#39;t figure out the RESTful way to do (b). Is there?\n\nThat would only make sense if you want the document to be stored\nas a new resource that is available from then on, and the converted\nforms are available via different links and/or negotiation.\nIn that case, you want the Alternates header field, though similar\nfunctionality can be accomplished within the body of a 201 response.\n\nIt is relatively easy to create an HTTP server module that\nprovides content-conversion on the fly for anything stored within\nthe system.  It then becomes a resource discovery problem (how does\nthe client know where to obtain all of these other formats?), which\nis what Alternates or Link was intended to supply.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
