This isn&#39;t extremist, it&#39;s central\n&gt; to having the entire m2m discussion; the point is, the discussion must\n&gt; be framed properly as &quot;how does the user-agent inform the user of its\n&gt; options&quot; not &quot;how does the API instruct the user of the next step&quot;\n&gt; (which leaps right across the user-agent layer, while standing the\n&gt; definition of &quot;REST application&quot; on its head, you see).\n\n\nI think I agree with the layered dichotomy between &quot;user&quot; and &quot;user agent&quot; components here.  Taking it further, it may be useful to think about these discussions as extending REST to consider the user as a component and the existence of connector(s) between the user and the user agent.   \n\nIn such an extension, I do believe that media type design has a major impact on the connector between a machine user and a user agent.   HTML, for example, could be seen as being conducive to a &quot;render&quot; connector to a human user, or a &quot;spider&quot; connector to a search engine user.   Whereas Atom, Atompub, etc. may have a different sort of User component & User/UA connector.\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n      __________________________________________________________________\nBe smarter than spam.
