Jan was asking what allowed a given URI in a given\ncontext to identify a *person*, as opposed to a more expected\nconsequence, like identifying a document.  My point was simply that\neven defective identifiers sometimes work well, provided a supportive\nenough context. You know, it begs the question: What allows identifiers\nto work at all?  And then: Is REST doing/promising something other\nthan the usual in that department?  I don&#39;t think so.\n:\n: Walden, are you saying the question is meaningless and cannot be asked, at\n: least within the context of a REST architectural discussion?\n\nNo.  BTW, I think when Roy said &quot;author&quot;, he was referring to the\nperson or agent who composed the hypertext snippet.\n\n:\n: That the word &quot;author&quot; is a typo for some other correct word?\n\nNo.  Hmm, what author word might the author have intended?\n\n-Walden\n\n\n\n"}}
