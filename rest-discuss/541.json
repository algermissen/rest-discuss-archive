We either need to define a really\n&gt; hairy, Turing-complete filter language or we need to leave it up to the\n&gt; application. I claim that the &quot;HTTP solution&quot; is to leave it up to the\n&gt; application to do with resource modeling. Now why is your seemingly\n&gt; reasonable request any different in kind, not just degree, from the guy\n&gt; who wants to filter by IP address or time of day or content-type or ...\n\nIt isn&#39;t. That is the kind of filtering I would like to be able to do (other\nthan the IP example, unless it is framed as an http uri). Just like HTTP\nallows me to send JPEG when everybody else is doing HTML. There is a slot\nfor the concept - not everybody uses it, but its there. Just like not\neverybody would use the &#39;watch for this operation+status on this resource&#39;.\nThere could be a default to &#39;watch for method=POST|DELETE|PUT status=2xx on\nthis resource&#39;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; That content-type example is particularly interesting because it is\n&gt; purely in the domain of HTTP so it falls into the same category as the\n&gt; method. Should people be able to filter on content-type as well as\n&gt; method? What about filtering on Host:. etc. etc.\nYes.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Just do it with the URI and be done with it! Reformulating queries and\n&gt; filters as URIs is one of the most brilliant things about the Web and I\n&gt; want to emulate it.\nPerhaps - let me think about it and write down some samples. I like that\nidea too - but I&#39;m not sure if that looseness would hurt a &#39;watch&#39;\npseudo-method (the appearance of being custom/proprietary/non-standard may\nslow adoption). A more rigorous/burned-into-the-protocol approach is harder\nto do and also harder to deploy, but it might make some people more\nconfident that it is okay to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
