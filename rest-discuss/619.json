I haven&#39;t thought through all of the\n&gt; issues, but\n&gt;  I&#39;m worried about scalability and robustness.\n&gt;\n&gt;  1. it must be possible to be able to piggy-back resources (and/or\n&gt; deltas?) in notifications\n\nNeed more info here to know what you mean.  In general, if the notification\ncontains anything but a TRUE value, it&#39;s an update.  If the notification is used\nto push changed resources, including via deltas, then it is an update.\n\nI am very much for dealing with the need for updates, but not now.  It&#39;s an\nentire layer of complexity.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  2. it must be possible to re-subscribe in the response to a\n&gt; notification\n\nagreed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  3. the last point implies that the server must tell the client in the\n&gt; notification that it is &quot;pre-authorized&quot; for re-subscription.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that the sink is pre-authorized to resubscribe often\nenough to consider it the default.  Plus it doesn&#39;t really cause damage to have\na re-subscribe fail.  So it is parsimonious to leave authorization to the usual\nHTTP means, i.e. by having the source return 401 (Unauthorized) when the need\narises to deny a sub request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
