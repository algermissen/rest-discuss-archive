A request to the trainer would mean:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;give me the next exercise you want me to complete&quot;. The trainer \n&gt; &gt; responds with one of many exercises most of the time.\n&gt; &gt; After having completed a certain number of exercises the \n&gt; trainee would \n&gt; &gt; be directed to some kind of summary or statistics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How should I model this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the response of the trainer ressource is meant to change \n&gt; randomly \n&gt; &gt; for each request, should I POST to this ressource?\n&gt; &gt; Or should I GET it and redirect the client through a \n&gt; location header? \n&gt; &gt; Or do something else that I&#39;m missing?\n&gt; The response is not meant to change randomly - you said &quot;... \n&gt; want me to complete&quot;. Until you&#39;ve indicated that your state \n&gt; is &#39;complete&#39;, then the response should remain unchanged (in \n&gt; order to take into consideration the failure to retrieve the \n&gt; initial response completely).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
