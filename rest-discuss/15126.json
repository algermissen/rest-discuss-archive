Taking it further, it may be useful to think abo=\r\nut these discussions as extending REST to consider the user as a component =\r\nand the existence of connector(s) between the user and the user agent.   \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; In such an extension, I do believe that media type design has a major i=\r\nmpact on the connector between a machine user and a user agent.   HTML, for=\r\n example, could be seen as being conducive to a &quot;render&quot; connector to a hum=\r\nan user, or a &quot;spider&quot; connector to a search engine user.   Whereas Atom, A=\r\ntompub, etc. may have a different sort of User component & User/UA connecto=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n\nStuart,\nThis layering is _exactly_ what I was getting at in my discu=\r\nssion with you on your blog: http://www.stucharlton.com/blog/archives/2010/=\r\n03/building-a-restful-hypermedia.html#comments\n\nI was calling the &quot;user-age=\r\nnt&quot; the &quot;hypermedia processor&quot; and the &quot;user&quot; the &quot;client platform&quot;. I didn=\r\n&#39;t call it &quot;user&quot; because I think even with a web browser, there are more l=\r\nayers to go through immediately beneath the user agent before you get to th=\r\ne user, e.g. the window manager or OS. Also, in some standards-based REST c=\r\nlients (e.g. CCXML clients) there is no &quot;user&quot; (well there&#39;s a user, but th=\r\ney are so far removed that you wouldn&#39;t think of them making &quot;decisions&quot; ab=\r\nout what links to follow).\n\nI really believe that the nature of this connec=\r\ntor between the &quot;user-agent&quot;/&quot;hypermedia processor&quot; and the layer below is =\r\nabsolutely central to media type design. As I was saying in the blog commen=\r\nts, I believe that the messages sent &quot;up&quot; to the user-agent must be designe=\r\nd so that they do not impose processing constraints on the user-agent that =\r\nare carried over to the service (as this would over-constrain the services =\r\npreventing service heterogeneity or service evolution).\n\nThe means for doin=\r\ng this is restricting the messages to being events (as opposed to commands =\r\nas defined here: http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/avoid-command-messa=\r\nges.html ) or if they are commands, they shouldn&#39;t have processing semantic=\r\ns beyond those of the uniform interface. For example, if they message from =\r\nthe &quot;lower&quot; layer was a &quot;BuyBook&quot; command message, then the processing cons=\r\ntraints requiring that a book must be ordered would be imposed on the servi=\r\nce. A &quot;BookDesired&quot; event would allow an application to do other things (e.=\r\ng. survey what books clients are interested in).\n\nI think the &quot;client error=\r\n handling&quot; expressed by Jan in other threads is just another way of saying =\r\nthis. Requiring that the &quot;client&quot; should handle the service not doing what =\r\nit expects is the same thing as weakening the command message processing se=\r\nmantics to the point where they become events -- e.g. BuyBook becomes BookD=\r\nesired.\n\nThe messages &quot;down&quot; from the User-agent to the layer below can be =\r\ncommands -- e.g. &quot;draw this on the screen&quot; or just &quot;data&quot; (document message=\r\ns in Bill Poole&#39;s nomenclature. Anyways, I&#39;m starting to repeat what I said=\r\n in the blog comment thread (sorry to subject you to this twice Stuart, you=\r\nr posting here just happened to be the one where I connected the dots betwe=\r\nen the two threads). In a nutshell: the user-agent is a mediator (in GoF te=\r\nrms) between the user/platform and the uniform interface; however the media=\r\ntor logic is dynamic, controlled by hypermedia. This, IMO, is the root of R=\r\nESTful client-server decoupling.\n\nThe impact on hypermedia design is that y=\r\nou need to think about how the hypermedia document is translated into the c=\r\nommand/document messages to the layer below and how the events coming up ar=\r\ne translated into requests to the service. This means that links (via relat=\r\nions or other info) should identify the event types they map to -- some lik=\r\ne &lt;link&gt; with &quot;stylesheet&quot; relations are triggered by a user-agent internal=\r\n event like page load to supplement the client steady state with extra data=\r\n and others (like &lt;a&gt; links) are triggered by events from the platform.\nReg=\r\nards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
