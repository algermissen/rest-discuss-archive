There&#39;s a RESTfull API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, resources mean\nthings, etc...) and an AJAX client dealing with this API.\n\nOne of my developers comes to me and says &quot;I can&#39;t commit from inside\nthis big coproration that I happen to be sitting in&quot;\n\nI investigate and it seems the only access to the web from inside this\nwell known large british communications company is via a proxy server\nthat does not support PUT.\n\n\nOh dear.\n\nI wonder how many other large organizations have ancient proxy servers\n(or not so ancient) that don&#39;t support PUT.\n\n\nWhat is a RESTafarian to do in such a situation? Should I add a\nnon-RESTfull (POST based) gateway API ? Is there another solution?\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\nPS I feel empty not putting a pirate gag in here but I don&#39;t have the\ntime to think of one.
