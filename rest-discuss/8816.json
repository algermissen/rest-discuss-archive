RPC communication is stateful, in my case, &quot;each request from \n&gt;&gt; client to server... contain(s) all of the information necessary to \n&gt;&gt; understand the request, and (does not) take advantage of any stored\n&gt; context \n&gt;&gt; on the server&quot; which is a stateless, RESTful interaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like RPC to me because it looks like your making a function\n&gt; call rather then requesting the a resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; RPC does not have to be stateful.\n\nTreat the URI as opaque. Verbs in a URI might be a bad smell, a very bad\nsmell, but there&#39;s nothing RESTful or unRESTful about them. What matters is\nwhich verb counts: the method verb (in the case of HTTP, GET, PUT, &c.) or the\none in the identifier. A URI is just an identifier for a resource, and as long\nas clients are able to treat it as such, there&#39;s no problem with having\nanything it it.\n\nThat aside, that&#39;s one ugly URI!\n\n&gt;&gt; Well, that&#39;s another way to do it.  But my way is still self-describing \n&gt;&gt; because there is a service document which clearly lays out the\n&gt;&gt; existence and usage of parameters for each language the service is\n&gt;&gt; available in, no guesswork involved.  I&#39;m a bit confused on where\n&gt;&gt; self-describing services enters into REST, though.\n\nAs an addendum to what Eoin wrote, REST is self-describing because responses\nand requests included information in them, in the case of HTTP, Content-Type\nand other headers, which tells the client and server how to parse the message.\n\nOne of the reasons why service documents don&#39;t really gel with REST is that\nclients aren&#39;t meant to care what the identifiers look like. All they&#39;re meant\nto care about is that there are URIs present that can be dereferenced. Where\nthis isn&#39;t the case, you&#39;ve got two choices: hardwire the clients or get\nthe server to tell the client how to build the URIs by including a template\n_in the response_. This keeps the client and server decoupled from one\nanother--a service document is a form of strong coupling--and allows the\nserver and client to vary without breaking.\n\n&gt; One way REST is self describing is way a user can traverse links from\n&gt; one resource to another related resource rather then knowing the rules\n&gt; on how to construct the URLs.\n&gt; And you have things like OPTIONS which is supposed to say what\n&gt; operations are allowed on a particular resource.\n\nPity OPTIONS is so underspecified though.\n\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, in terms of REST constraints, it&#39;s the messages that are to be \n&gt;&gt; self-descriptive, not the service itself.\n\nOnce the messages are self-descriptive, so too is the service itself.\n\nK.\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
