POST-only SOAP services may be the HTML \nFrames of the next generation Web.\n\nJust as framed Web sites became popular for a few years after \nframes-capable browsers were deployed, we&#39;ll probably see a lot of \nPOST-only SOAP services in the near future. But if the REST critique of \nPOST-only services is right, we can expect to see these replaced by more \naddressable, GET-accessable SOAP services, just as we saw Frames pretty \nmuch vanish from mainstream use. Most Web sites don&#39;t use HTML Frames, \nbecause using them turns out to be a pain. The critiques we&#39;re hearing \nabout POST-only SOAP have a lot in common with the various critiques of \nframes (URIs, addressability etc). Maybe we&#39;ll see a similar \nadoption/migration curve...?\n\nDan\n\nps. my sense that frames were quite widely adopted and then slowly \nabandoned is based on memory, anecdote etc. Does anyone know of a survey \nthat puts hard figures to this claim?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQE9RsblPhXvL3Mij+QRAhh6AJ9TmYrau7XASsOF7e11vb4pgCVDsACdFik/\nlACzD6ycTr6MkFrkUniks9c=\n=mxqH\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
