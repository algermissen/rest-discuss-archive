Either HTTP&#39;s synchronous calls are fundamental and\n&gt; asynchronous communication is built atop this with full visibility to the\n&gt; underlying synchronous mechansim, or the asynchronous mechanism is\n&gt; fundamental and\n&gt; we map HTTP onto it while preserving visibility for the asynchronous\n&gt; mechanism.\n&gt; IMO they can&#39;t effectively be on par, one has to be more essential;\n&gt; and the task\n&gt; of layering asynchrony on top of HTTP seems easier and more\n&gt; productive to me than\n&gt; trying to force-fit synchronous HTTP semantics on top of SMTP.  Lucas\n&gt; seems to have\n&gt; arrived at mostly the same conclusion...?\n\n\nMy feeling is that HTTP&#39;s synchronous calls are fundamental and asynch should be\nbuilt atop this with full visibility.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t attempt to merge HTTP semantics into SMTP -- already tried it, didn&#39;t\nwork.  What I don&#39;t know is how good an idea it is to build general purpose\n&quot;asynch/notifications/store-and-forward HTTP&quot; as a web app, but that&#39;s the\ncurrent plan.  If there are people interested in collaborating on design or\nimplementation, I would welcome you.  See\nhttp://gonze.com/asynch-http/aREST_frame.htm\nfor the current state of the design.  I definately have not yet gotten the HTTP\ncalls correct, and blame Visio export for the heinous HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
