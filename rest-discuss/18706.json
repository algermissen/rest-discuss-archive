This has led to\n&gt;&gt; a lot of controversy and demands from the RDF community for solutions\n&gt;&gt; to problems that apparently don&#39;t exist for REST or anyone else\n&gt;&gt; outside of &#39;RDF land&#39; - a good example of a this is range-14.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; httpRange-14, as its name suggests, is an HTTP issue not an RDF one. RDF is\n&gt; useful to describe informational and non-informational resources in a\n&gt; uniform way. Linked Data, in using RDF with HTTP, encounters this issue but\n&gt; does not cause it.\n\nThat weird forced distinction between informational vs\nnon-informational resources is fabricated by RDF-think.  HTTP has no\nrequirement to make this distinction otherwise, therefore range-14 is\naddressing a would-be-non-issue-for-http that is inflicted on the web\nby RDF.\n\nBasically, in range-14, the issue for HTTP is that it is the\nunfortunate victim of RDF&#39;s web-insanity being taken way too\nseriously.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
