However I&#39;d\nlike to continue the discussion here first.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 31, 2012 at 6:55 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think registering a link relation w/ the IANA that conveys the meaning of\n&gt; &quot;use this URL to create a new resource of the type you are currently\n&gt; viewing&quot; would be valuable. I&#39;d would prefer the value &quot;create&quot; over &quot;add&quot;\n&gt; or &quot;new&quot; as I think it a broader value that covers not just adding new items\n&gt; to a collection, but also creating new stand-alone content, etc.\n\nI have previously designed and implemented a few &quot;read-only&quot; HTTP\nAPI:s (as REST-ful as possible!) and I have only had the need for\nusing the methods GET HEAD and OPTIONS. This has made the linking\naspect of the API rather straight forward for me. I have been able to\nuse established link relation types without any significant problems.\n\nHowever, now I&#39;m designing a more interactive HTTP API for a\ncompany-internal production system and I have the need for\ncreating/adding new resources. I now find that for more interactive\nHTTP API:s there seems to be a lack of established link relation\ntypes.\n\nTo elaborate a bit on you suggestion Mike, and based on my current\nneeds, I would like to propose:\n\n1. &quot;create&quot;: &quot;Use this URL to create a new resource (possibly without\nproviding any data)&quot;.\n\n2. &quot;add&quot;: &quot;Use this URL to add an existing resource by providing data&quot;.\n\n3. &quot;remove&quot;: &quot;Use this URL to remove an existing resource&quot;.\n\n4. &quot;start&quot;: &quot;Use this URL to start an &#39;execution&#39; resource&quot;. Eg:\ntransaction, update, dump, backup etc. These resources are typically\ntransient. In my case I have an resource representing a ongoing\ndownload of various data sets.\n\n5. &quot;stop&quot;: Use this URL to stop an execution resource&quot;.\n\n/Paul\n\n-- \nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
