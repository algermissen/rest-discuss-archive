A simple way to do\n&gt; &gt; this might be to kill queries that took longer than X seconds, a la simpledb\n&gt; &gt; [3]. My colleage Graham Klyne and I had a chat with Andy Seaborne about doing\n&gt; &gt; this with Jena TDB, which wasn&#39;t possible at the time, and Andy seemed to\n&gt; &gt; think it was doable (?) but there were details around how TDB executed queries\n&gt; &gt; and also how TDB&#39;s various optimisers worked that I didn&#39;t fully understand,\n&gt; &gt; and we never had the time to follow this through. I haven&#39;t done any recent\n&gt; &gt; work on SPARQL, so it may be that there are query engines out there that\n&gt; &gt; support this kind of thing out of the box.\n&gt; \n&gt; That would certainly work in the sense of bringing the cost down, but\n&gt; it would be a shadow of a SPARQL endpoint from the point of view of\n&gt; client expectations, no?  Its proper functioning would be dependent on\n&gt; far too many variables that the client has no control over.\n&gt; \n&gt; That could be remedied by the publisher documenting a set of queries\n&gt; which it can guarantee will complete in a reasonable time, because it\n&gt; has optimized specifically for them (indexes, caching, etc..) ... but\n&gt; then that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;d be doing if they put an HTTP interface\n&gt; in front of that data.\n\nThat&#39;s a good point. But I do wonder if there is still a middle-ground worth\na bit of exploration. By that I mean, for any given endpoint, based on my\nexperience with Jena TDB and the FlyBase dataset (~180m triples) [1] there\nwill probably still be quite a large space of possible queries that will\nexecute with low cost even without the service making indexing or caching\noptimisations specific to the data.\n\nE.g., try doing the example search at\nhttp://openflydata.org/flyui/build/apps/expressionbygenebatch/ with firebug\nopen to see the underlying SPARQL queries. These queries are not trivial\nbut usually complete in less than a few seconds (some are sub-second), and\nthe endpoints are all hosted on a modest EC2 m1.small instance. No specific\noptimisations were made for any of these endpoints, beyond the use of the\ngeneric TDB statistics-based optimiser.\n\n(In case you were wondering, those are fruit fly embryos and testes you&#39;re\nlooking at :)\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not trying to claim SPARQL will revolutionise the\nWeb, and I haven&#39;t done any work with SPARQL since 2009, so I have nothing\ninvested in it.\n\nBut I do wonder if, for people who have an interesting dataset that they&#39;d\nlike to share with others, exposing their dataset via a SPARQL endpoint\nwould be worthwhile, even if they limited resource usage. I.e., the data\npublisher would say, &quot;here&#39;s my data, you can execute x queries per second,\nany queries longer than y seconds will get killed, here&#39;s some statistics\nabout the data to help you figure out what&#39;s there, go explore&quot;. Any third\nparties then interested in re-using the data could try a few sparql queries to\nsee if they were efficient, and if so, query the SPARQL endpoint directly in\ntheir mashup/... application. If the queries they needed turned out not to be\nso efficient, then they could begin a dialogue with the data provider about\nan HTTP interface that is optimised for a particular set of requirements,\nor they could harvest (via the SPARQL endpoint?), cache and index the data\nthey need and do their own optimisation.\n\nI think this is especially interesting where a dataset is widely\napplicable. E.g., FlyBase stores reference data on the fruit fly genome,\nwhich is central to genomic research in Drosophila and is re-used in an\nextremely diverse range of applications. For FlyBase, they serve their\ncommunity better by providing more flexible interfaces to their data, because\nthey cannot possibly predict all requirements. (In fact, FlyBase currently\nprovide an SQL endpoint on a best-effort basis, which anyone can use if you\nknow where to find it.)\n\nAnd providing a query endpoint is a nice way of lowering the costs for third\nparties re-using your data. E.g., if it&#39;s a SPARQL endpoint, then re-using\nthe data is as simple as writing a bit of Python/Perl/..., or putting\nsome HTML and javascript on a web server, very low infrastructure costs\nor complexity. This is more relevant where there are lots of small-scale\ndata re-users that don&#39;t have access to hosting infrastructure, which is\nparticularly the case in biological research.\n\nHaving said all that, I&#39;ve found a fair few queries that SPARQL is just crap\nat, and will never work without data-specific indexing and caching. Graham\nKlyne got some funding recently work with the Jena guys to look at extending\nSPARQL endpoints with multiple data-specific indexes [2], that could be\ninteresting, and I&#39;m sure others are working in the same space.\n\nA few shades of grey worth talking about here?\n\nCheers,\n\nAlistair\n \n[1] http://code.google.com/p/openflydata/wiki/FlyBaseMilestone3\n[2] http://code.google.com/p/milarq/\n\n-- \nAlistair Miles\nHead of Epidemiological Informatics\nCentre for Genomics and Global Health &lt;http://cggh.org&gt;\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics\nRoosevelt Drive\nOxford\nOX3 7BN\nUnited Kingdom\nWeb: http://purl.org/net/aliman\nEmail: alimanfoo@...\nTel: +44 (0)1865 287669\n\n"}}
