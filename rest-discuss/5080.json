This is\n&gt; exacerbated if the invocation is going across the internet.\n&gt; \n&gt; In that situation, it is usually considered very poor design to hold a\n&gt; transaction and tie up the resources on the back end.\n&gt; \n\nIt would be astonishingly poor design if your server held open a transaction\nin the underlying database across these calls. But you don&#39;t have to\nimplement it that way. Nic&#39;s original post modeled the transaction as just\nanother resource, so you could come back and commit that resource even days\nlater -- I&#39;m sure the implementation would just implement its own simple\nsort of transaction log and execute it on commit -- easy. You&#39;d probably\nwant to combine this model with one of the reliable HTTP ideas floating\naround.\n\n&gt; Better bet is to keep the granularity of your REST (or WS) calls coarse\n&gt; enough that the transaction is handled entirely by the back end.\n&gt; \n&gt; It points to your colleage thinking of the world in local RPC terms.  That\n&gt; doesn&#39;t fly very well in a distributed system.  You might want to point\n&gt; him\n&gt; at the Fallacies of Distributed Computing  (from Peter Deustch, extended\n&gt; by\n&gt; James Gosling):\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The network is reliable.\n&gt; 2) Latency is zero.\n&gt; 3) Bandwidth is infinite.\n&gt; 4) The network is secure.\n&gt; 5) Topology doesn&#39;t change.\n&gt; 6) There is one administrator.\n&gt; 7) Transport cost is zero.\n&gt; 8) The network is homogeneous.\n&gt; \n\nExcellent list!\n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
