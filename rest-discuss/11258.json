Resource prototypes? Maybe even resource\narchetypes? I actually like that last one. Certainly it has\nlittle compsci / s/w-eng baggage…\n\n* Ben Davies &lt;omarshariffdontlikeit@...&gt; [2008-09-04 10:25]:\n&gt; Am I missing the point your making?\n\nI think so.\n\n&gt; You are not POSTing an ArticleResource to /articles; you are\n&gt; POSTing a representation of the ArticleState, a representation\n&gt; of how you would like the application to internally visualise\n&gt; the State of your new Article. There is no such thing as an\n&gt; ArticleResource; only a Resource that acts on the internal\n&gt; application state on your behalf.\n\nCareful with terminology. I will assume you meant resource state\nhere, because Stefan is talking about server implementation; I\nhope you did not *actually* mean the REST meaning of application\nstate.\n\nIn which case yes, you are right, the client sends a\nrepresentation and the resource then acts on the resource state\nto reflect that representation. But the server implementation can\nonly map a particular set of states for any particular resource.\nPosting a JPEG to a resource that can only map to one of the\nstates that comprise an article is likely to be useless, because\nthe resource will not be able to deduce which one of the states\nit is able to assume you are asking it to take.\n\nNow, the shape of the space of states that any one resource can\nmap is probably common across a large number of resources in any\ngiven server implementation, but distinct from several other such\nshapes that the same implementation is also capable of mapping,\nf.ex. a set of states that can describe an article, another set\nof states that can describe a user, and various sets of states\nthat can describe collections of these respective other sets.\n\nEach of these share implementation in the server code.\n\nThe question is, can we find a name to express the concept of\nparticular distinct spaces of resource states?\n\n&gt; You simply pass it a representation of the desired state, and\n&gt; the Resource manipulates the internal state to reflect your\n&gt; request. Thats what I mean when I say there is no\n&gt; ArticleResource, because as far as the application code goes,\n&gt; all Resources are identical in type, it&#39;s merely the actions an\n&gt; individual Resource can perform for you that differ.\n\nThis is true from the client perspective. Stefan is talking about\nthe server perspective, where the platonic ideal of resources has\nto map back to some kind of code that actually implements them.\n\nThe question is what terms to use when talking about how the\nsausage is made rather than about how to think of it after it\ncomes out of the factory…\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
