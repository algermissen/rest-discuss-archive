Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a\n&gt; link. Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by\n&gt; itself, but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt; \n\nLinking to a procedure call, doesn&#39;t make that procedure call a REST\nresource.  What happens if you GET /cancelled?  What is it a\nrepresentation of?  The resource?  Or some action, i.e. remote\nprocedure?  If you aren&#39;t transferring representations of resources in\norder to change their state, then you aren&#39;t using REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
