Pagaltzis &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; An example of what I was thinking of is when a client PUTs a\n&gt; representation that cannot, due to the format used, describe the\n&gt; entire state of the resource. In that case, the server has to\n&gt; fill in the rest of the state somehow, and it may or may not use\n&gt; previous resource state to do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, there may be aspects of resource state that the server does\n&gt; not allow clients to modify, ever. An obvious example of the\n&gt; latter would be the app:edited element in an Entry stored by an\n&gt; Atompub server. But it&#39;s easy to imagine a variation of this\n&gt; element that contains not a datetime, but an edit counter. The\n&gt; new value of this counter after a PUT would then obviously be\n&gt; based on its previous value and would not be based on anything\n&gt; that the client included in its request.\n&gt;\n&gt; So there are various legitimate ways in which new resource state\n&gt; may derive from previous resource state.\n\nSo how would you define a partial update to distinguish it from a full\nupdate?  And when would you force clients to use PATCH instead of PUT?\n\n-- Assaf\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However, in no such scenario are the semantics of PUT affected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
