Obviously, there has to be\nsome sort of information flow between the people and software that\nuse the information and the database that stores the information.\n\n&gt; opens up can of worms from security perspective.\n\nYes, it does, but it&#39;s not a can of worms that you can avoid.\nThere are security issues whenever you build software. This\nreality is what makes having a robust security model so important.\nThe web-calculus was built starting from a security model:\ncapability-based security. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/\n\n&gt; It allows hackers just the open door access to steal us.\n\nThis all depends on how good your application security is. If you\nbuild your application without any kind of security model, as\ncurrent web services are, you are indeed building an open door.\n\nThe main reason the web-calculus is so interesting is that it was\nbuilt starting from a security model.\n\n&gt; I agree it may work as an example, but please correct me if this\n&gt; is indeed used or supposed to be used in real world scenarios.\n\nThe Waterken RDB Webizer tutorial shows how the tool is meant to\nbe used in real world scenarios. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/Tutorial/\n\n&gt; As discussed earlier on\n&gt; service-oriented-architecture@yahoogroups.com, there are bound to be lots\n&gt; of wrong implementations with SOA (just like we see lots of ill-developed\n&gt; HTML websites, there are bound to be lots of ill-developed XML websites).\n\nA great deal of the design effort that went into building the\nWaterken RDB Webizer was focused on reducing the likelihood of\nsuch errors. The tool is designed such that the way developers\nnaturally use it encourages the construction of secure and\nauditable software. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Methodology/\n\n&gt; I was a proponent of the discussion that database must not be\n&gt; opened as in the UI above. I&#39;d like to hear thoughts.\n\nCan you link to the specific email, or summarize your argument\nagain here?\n\n&gt; (Just want to generate a learning experience. I could be more\n&gt; wrong than I think.)\n\nGreat, that&#39;s what a good mailing list is for.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
