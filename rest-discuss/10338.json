I\nalso wanted to set up the idea of using UriPatterns mapped directly to\nthe resource class (instead of to particular methods or via a resource\nmap. I didn&#39;t find that too easy to do with WCF. Also, I secretly\nharbor the idea that this pattern might catch on and would like to see\nit go beyond the MS space. That would be not getting tied to a\npre-existing MS tech. Lastly, I didn&#39;t want to use WCF only to have it\ndrift or stagnate somewhere down the list and then be &#39;stuck&#39;\nsomewhere down the pike.\n\nBTW - It&#39;s been a while, so I might have mised the forests for the\ntrees. I&#39;d be happy to check out some REST-ful examples built w/ WCF,\nif you have any to recommend.\n\nAs for my comment on text/xml...\ntext/xml is a pretty &#39;non-informative[g]&#39; mime-type. when i see Atom,\nRDF, RSS, i know a great deal about the document - what&#39;s required,\ndata types, etc. All that without using a schema or other document to\ntell me that. It would probably have been better for me to use a\ncustom content-type for my example:\n&quot;application/vnd.amundsen.tasklist+xml&quot; or something like that. But,\nas long as the client and server already understand the schema, there\nis no big deal.\n\nMCA\n\nOn Jan 29, 2008 10:23 AM, Ebenezer Ikonne &lt;amaeze@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mike amundsen&quot; &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I posted a live sample app and an associated tutorial article that\n&gt; &gt; covers building REST-ful apps over ASP.NET/IIS w/ C# here:\n&gt; &gt; http://exyus.com/articles/tasklist/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Feedback is appreciated here or @ http://groups.google.com/group/exyus\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TIA\n&gt; &gt; MikeA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Mike -\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious to know why you didn&#39;t use REST features available in WCF\n&gt; since it seems your work is being done in .NET.\n&gt;\n&gt; Additionally, can you provide an explanation on the following statement:\n&gt;\n&gt; It should be noted that XML (text/xml) is not a very useful &quot;content\n&gt; type&quot; for building HTTP applications. Other content types that would be\n&gt; more useful would be Atom (application/atom+xml) or RDF\n&gt; (application/rdf+xml). However, for this example, we&#39;ll use XML to keep\n&gt; things as simple as possible. If you wish, you can use this example as\n&gt; a starting point to add support for your favorite content type.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
