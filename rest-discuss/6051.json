But cacheability \nis tied to persistence.  If you dynamically generate the response each \ntime, it&#39;s not cacheable anyway.\n&gt; That&#39;s the whole reason sessions are considered un-RESTful. To be\n&gt; RESTful all the information relating to the request has to be in the\n&gt; request. With sessions that&#39;s not the case.\n&gt;   \nI don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;relating to the request&quot;.  Is the \nresponse &quot;relating to the request&quot;?  Then the request must contain the \nresponse.  What about a session is not &quot;in the request&quot;?  Certainly the \nsession ID is in the request.  The state of the session is not.  But the \nstate of the resource isn&#39;t in the request either.  So I don&#39;t see your \ndistinction.\n&gt; If you look back on the list archives over the last few days you&#39;ll\n&gt; see this point argued through quite comprehensively.\n&gt;   \nIt hasn&#39;t convinced me.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
