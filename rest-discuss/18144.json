No matter how=\r\n generic your media types is, you always end up putting in your code the kn=\r\nowledge about the domain.\n\nWe have to do some work! ;-)\n\n&gt;&gt; As Paul states =\r\nit &quot;The web is not recompiled every morning - yet it works!&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; Sure! But =\r\nwe do not recompile it because humans are so good at adopting to\n&gt;&gt; whateve=\r\nr they see on a screen. But for a M2M system to work it surely must\n&gt;&gt; be r=\r\necompiled in order to understand new or changed semantics of the domain\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nit works with.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, this is not true thanks to content negotiation and w=\r\nell designed\n&gt; extension rules for payload formats.\n\nExactamente! Content n=\r\negotiation is another underestimated and often\noverlooked feature in REST/H=\r\nTTP.\n\nThe robustness principle or Postel&#39;s law\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wik=\r\ni/Postels_law) is fundamental to designing\nand implementing good clients an=\r\nd servers:\n\n    Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you=\r\n send.\n\nSo assume as little as you can about the server in your design and\n=\r\nimplementation of a client. And always assume the server will change.\nLook =\r\non server data as duck-typed\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). If=\r\n the data looks like\nuseful domain data you can assume it is.\n\nWe are talki=\r\nng about cross-enterprise system interfaces here. We can\nnot expect all ent=\r\nerprises to march in order with regards to system\nreleases and upgrades!\n\n&gt;=\r\n The cases where a server needs to switch from application/procurement-v1 t=\r\no\n&gt; application/procurement-v2 instantly, without a transition period of su=\r\npporting\n&gt; those application/procurement-v1 enabled clients is extremely ra=\r\nre. (Feel free to\n&gt; construct an example).\n&gt;\n&gt; The cool thing about REST is=\r\n that any form of evolution can take place without\n&gt; coordinating the chang=\r\ne between clients, servers and intermediaries.\n\nNot only cool. But to me th=\r\nis is the *core* business rationale for\nchosing REST over RPC-style API:s f=\r\nor cross-enterprise system\ninterfaces.\n\n&gt; This is so natural to use Web use=\r\nrs and I continue to find it astonishing that\n&gt; business systems owners are=\r\n not jumping like mad on that feature regarding their\n&gt; internal IT systems=\r\n.\n\nI agree.\n\n/Paul\n\n-- \nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 =\r\n035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
