What are some use cases where REST should not be used? Since I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; advocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d like to\n&gt; &gt; know if my use cases falls into this category!\n&gt; \n&gt; To be honest, probably not. ;) ;(\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s why I say that: REST has its own kind of interaction model, just\n&gt; as tuple spaces do. I think that putting one on top of the other will\n&gt; degrade the benefits of both. It is a little like putting objects in a\n&gt; relational databases or relations in an object database etc.\n\nHmmm... It may be that I am confusing a networked implementation using\ntypical networking protocols with a REST architecture (and its interaction\nmodel). On the other hand, http GET looks a lot like Linda OUT. Couldn&#39;t\nthe Linda space be just another client? What benefits do you think will be\nlost (to Linda and to REST) with this approach? (I am after massive\nscaleability, I don&#39;t care about network latency) within reason.))\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of any)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be very illuminating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds like religious\n&gt; &gt; enthusiasm to me....\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that REST is not appropriate for first person shooters (as an\n&gt; example). Performance would be a huge problem in trying to maintain\n&gt; REST&#39;s statelessness. Realtime 3D video games cannot even afford to be\n&gt; &quot;stateless enough&quot; to meet their own security requirements (that&#39;s why\n&gt; the send extra information before it is needed and that informatio is\n&gt; used by cheater software).\n\nSo it isn&#39;t network latency but the cost of expressing stateless messages\n(if that is the right word) that is at issue. (Sounds like one wouldn&#39;t\nwrite an authoring system with versioing RESTfully either, since it would\nbe simpler to send the diffs around rather than a complete document? If\nthat example isn&#39;t too crude....) \n\nNot sure about this notion of &quot;messages&quot; (?) being stateless (ie, being\ncontext free? Or having their entire context with them??) It sounds a lot\nlike the old SGML issue of self-describing tag names ... Well, yes, they\nwere self-describing ... Up to a point determined by context (operational\ndefinition: &quot;that which I have to talk to a lot of people about but can\nnever pin down.&quot;)\n\n\nSam Hunting\neTopicality, Inc.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;Turn your searching experience into a finding experience.&quot;(tm)\n\nTopic map consulting and training: www.etopicality.com\nFree open source topic map tools:  www.goose-works.org\n\nXML Topic Maps: Creating and Using Topic Maps for the Web.\nAddison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-74960-2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"}}
