The parts-depot accepts parts orders.  \nThe RPG\n&gt; game server accepts &quot;action&quot; orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; I submit that this is not much different than invoking a method of \nan\n&gt; object.  \n\nI&#39;ll only speak to the parts-order example.  I really have no \nabsolute objection to verbs in URIs, but an order is not the same as \ninvoking a method on an object.\n\nThere is a reason that purchase orders are documents and not remote \nprocedure calls, and that the business protocol is called &quot;offer-\nacceptance&quot; and not &quot;download the goods&quot;.\n\nThe purchase order is an offer to buy.  The seller is not required to \naccept it. Your credit might be bad, the seller might not have enough \ngoods, you may want it faster than the seller can deliver, or \nwhatever.\n\nYou do not have any control over the seller.  All you can do is \ntransfer the state of your offer.\n\nI suspect this is similar to some of the other instances of verbs in \nURIs.  A verb is not really the most accurate way to describe the \nsituation.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
