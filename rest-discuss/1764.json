However, GTP is just as much an academic\neffort as anything else (at this point, anyhow).  I am trying to grasp what\nREST means without specifically looking to HTTP for examples.\n\nSo, back to the original question (and it&#39;s corrolaries): Is GTP RESTful?\nIf not, what is lacking?  What REST principals does GTP not address?  What\nparts of GTP do not fit into the REST principles?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\np.s.
