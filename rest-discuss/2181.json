If you can model your security\nconcerns in terms of principal, method and resource, then you can use\nthe existing security framework in servlet/HTTP.  If Seth becomes\na resource instead of a principal, you&#39;re screwed.  If what Seth wants\nto do to the Store is something that needs more granularity than\n{GET, PUT, POST, DELETE}, then you&#39;re screwed.  &quot;Screwed&quot; in the\nsense that you have to write an application. :-)\n\nThat sounds like a bottom line to me.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seth Ladd [mailto:seth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 22, 2002 11:50 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Security in a REST world?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mathews, Walden wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think, in your example, the car is irrelevant.  Seth wants to put\n&gt; &gt; himself at the movies, and that&#39;s not allowed.  Movies is \n&gt; the resource,\n&gt; &gt; Seth is the principal, PUT is the method, and NO is the answer,\n&gt; &gt; presumably because Seth is in the wrong *role*, if we&#39;re \n&gt; talking servlet\n&gt; &gt; authorization.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s an excellent point!\n&gt; \n&gt; If we split this into two questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; Can Seth Use Car?\n&gt; Can Seth Go To Movies?\n&gt; \n&gt; Then it&#39;s easier, because each resource (car, movies) controls their \n&gt; destiny.  How would the car know whether or not I can go to \n&gt; the movies?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; state), then the application has to decide, via its \n&gt; business rules, whether\n&gt; &gt; he can drive to the movies.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I bet this is where distributed security models come in.  If the \n&gt; whole system is wired together and very smart, the car could \n&gt; then pass \n&gt; the PUT request all the way to the movie theatre.  If the \n&gt; movies said NO \n&gt; to Seth being there, the car could then say &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m not going to \n&gt; drive you there&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW your thoughts are excellent understand not only the \n&gt; security model \n&gt; but REST in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now the question becomes:\n&gt; \n&gt; Seth hasParent Mother\n&gt; Mother grants Permission1\n&gt; Permission1 allowsActor Seth\n&gt; Permission1 allowsMethod Enter\n&gt; Permission1 allowsActee Store\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, who does Mother tell this Permission1 to?  We decided up \n&gt; above that \n&gt; the car doesn&#39;t know/care about that.  In a real world, would Store \n&gt; allow Mother to PUT Permission1 there?  Or would Store delegate those \n&gt; permission questions back to Mother?\n&gt; \n&gt; We can take this offline or drop this any time you want.  \n&gt; It&#39;s getting \n&gt; fuzzy but I think the lessons learned are excellent ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Seth\n&gt; \n\n"}}
