One answer is that because part of /Subscriptions\n&gt; &gt; is out of bounds of that user, the entire resource is \n&gt; &quot;Unauthorized&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Another answer is that the representation given to a user \n&gt; is filtered,\n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; on his authenticated identity.  In that case, two different users\n&gt; &gt; accessing /Subscriptions via GET will see disjoint subsets of the\n&gt; &gt; resource.  By extension, an entire resource schema (application) may\n&gt; &gt; be implicitly constrained by the security properties of the access.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What does REST have to say about this, if anything?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cool... filtered views. Good question.\n&gt; My guess is that with HTTP you might be able to indicate how \n&gt; the response\n&gt; was dependent on the request - I think the &#39;vary&#39; header is \n&gt; used for that.\n&gt; So you could say that the response varies according to the \n&gt; auth header. This\n&gt; is useful for caching, etc. It essentially creates a &#39;meta-key&#39; or\n&gt; &#39;meta-identifier&#39; that can be used to a small degree as an \n&gt; identifier for\n&gt; the transient representations.\n\nOkay, that&#39;s ringing a bell (I&#39;m not sure which bell, but one\nhaving to do with shared caches I think), but it doesn&#39;t really answer\nmy question.  My question is whether that sort of filtering\nis consistent with the constraints of REST, or whether it violates\nthe latter in some subtle way that I can&#39;t seem to put my finger\non.\n\nUnless you answered that when you said &quot;Cool..&quot;.\n\nThis has got to be an awfully common pattern in web applications.\nJesus, I&#39;ve only developed two such, and it&#39;s in both!\n\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
