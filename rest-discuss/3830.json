Currently, I am using 403, saying that an\ninvalid request entity (say, a non-well-formded XML document) would be\n&quot;forbidden&quot;. But the problem here is that the resource is what defines\nwhether the request entity is valid or not (even the well-formedness of an\nXML document), so in *some* sense, a bad request entity &quot;conflicts&quot; with the\nresource.\n\nSo, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is 403\nfor?  About the only example I could come up with was one mirroring a\nfilesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is marked\n&quot;read-only&quot;.  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid if it were not\nread-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is not a conflict,\nnecessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore not\nappropriate for a 409 response.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jul 31, 2003 at 09:11:23AM -0400, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.\nShould a\n&gt; &gt; 403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d use 400.
