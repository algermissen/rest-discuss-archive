My company has a REST web service that accepts  \n&gt; POSTed data to it.  We wanted to return a 400 response code in cases  \n&gt; where the data being sent is invalid for some reason ( invalid XML,  \n&gt; invalid business rules, etc.. ) .  We also wanted to return specific  \n&gt; validation messages as part of the response body.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, we&#39;re running into problems with some java clients because  \n&gt; apparently the HttpUrlConnection class in the JDK swallows the  \n&gt; response bodies when a 400 or higher return code is sent back:\n&gt; \n&gt; From HttpUrlConnection ( around line 970 )\n&gt; \n&gt; if (respCode &gt;= 400) {\n&gt;    if (respCode == 404 || respCode == 410) {\n&gt;        throw new FileNotFoundException(url.toString());\n&gt;    } else {\n&gt;       throw new java.io.IOException(\n&gt;                          &quot;Server returned HTTP&quot;\n&gt;                          + &quot; response code: &quot; + respCode\n&gt;                          + &quot; for URL: &quot; + url.toString());\n&gt;    }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So my question: Is what we&#39;re trying to do not really correct?\n\nIt is correct.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve  \n&gt; looked in the HTTP spec and it says that an Entity Body may be  \n&gt; returned with a 400 error, so maybe it&#39;s just a bug in the Java  \n&gt; implementation?\n\nIt&#39;s more of a pain to do with the way that HttpURLConnection is\nspecified. There is a workaround: HttpURLConnection.getErrorStream -\nsee the Javadoc for this - but most developers probably don&#39;t know\nor ignore this.\n\nJust a poor design.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
