If that&#39;s the reality, then there will\nbe fewer people over time who understand it as science, increasing the\nS/N ratio on groups like www-tag and http-wg -- where REST is currently\npracticed by introducing more IANA registries to draw a clear line\nbetween what&#39;s self-descriptive and what isn&#39;t.  Seems like a valid\ntopic to blog about...\n\nCalling me out as full of myself or pedantic or whatever, is not backed\nup by my grand total of two posts on http-wg; one caught a typo, the\nother is an open issue.  I have one post on www-tag this year reminding\nthe TAG that they can&#39;t recommend against RFC 2616, and one thread this\nyear questioning the propriety of specifying barth-sniff in a variety of\nspecs, which led to those specs being changed to not define any sniffing\nalgorithm (with only the lightest prodding on my part).  Tautological?\nGuilty as charged.  :-)\n\nWhile I do believe that I understand REST, I&#39;m out of my depth on those\nlists, which is to say that I recognize that the participants in\ngeneral have more knowledge and experience than I do in these matters.\nWhat I try to do here, is explain to others the &quot;ideal form&quot; of the Web\ndescribed by REST, to promote understanding of the style by discussing\nwhy the Web has evolved the way that it has, and is evolving the way\nthat it is.  I only participate on http-wg or www-tag if I feel\nsomething important is being overlooked, and wouldn&#39;t make a big deal\nhere over something trivial, either.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
