If an order is accepted, work begins,  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; goods are shipped.  I&#39;ve seen it happen in EDI environments with no\n&gt;&gt;&gt; transactional controls, and it&#39;s expensive to undo.  Much better to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mark it provisional and only start work once the transaction  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; commits.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ah, here we go again ;-) Just remember: one size does not fit all ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; My opinion remains the same, but maybe I can explain it better now  \n&gt; (or not).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think at the protocol level (the interactions between coordinator\n&gt; and participants) one size can and will fit at least most.\n\nI think it&#39;s the definition of &quot;most&quot; that we will end up debating  \nuntil the cows come home. If we can agree that there will be a need  \nfor multiple protocols then that&#39;s a good start.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the implementation level, e.g. the internal workings of the\n&gt; participants, many variations will happen.\n\nAgreed. But mixing and matching implementations that obey different  \nprotocols can cause problems, so the basic assumptions under which the  \nparticipant works, e.g., do/undo, provisional/final, would still need  \nto be available in meta-data for instance.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, I think the same basic coordinator-participant\n&gt; interactions can happen for compensation or provisional-final\n&gt; patterns.  The participant can handle the two phases differently.\n\nOnly if the participant knows the &quot;type&quot; of transaction in which it  \nhas been enlisted. For instance, enlisting a strictly ACID-based  \nparticipant in a compensating transaction is not necessarily the most  \nefficient thing to do.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Different participants in the same transaction can handle them\n&gt; differently.\n\nDid you ever take a look at the WS-CAF BP protocol :-) ? The genesis  \nof that is very close to what you are outlining, though of course it  \nmay not have been as clearly articulated back then.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But the value of keeping the interaction protocol uniform is the same\n&gt; as the uniform interface constraint in ReST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying it has to be that way, nor that exceptions won&#39;t exist,\n&gt; just that a single simple RESTful transaction protocol will get a lot\n&gt; more takeup than a group of battling protocols.\n\nThey don&#39;t need to be &quot;battling&quot;. I&#39;ve always preferred the style of  \nusing the right tool for the right job. If that tool is a Swiss army- \nknife then great (as long as it doesn&#39;t become too bloated) as that  \nalso doesn&#39;t preclude the addition of other tools in your armory.  \nWe&#39;re going to try to develop this tx+REST approach entirely in the  \nopen, so it&#39;d be good to have you participate. I think this also  \nallows us to remove one of the other areas where we failed in BTP (and  \nelsewhere): getting real users involved! The barrier to entry for  \nOASIS, W3C and OMG is/was far too high.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think another place we disagree is that is partly why I think the\n&gt; earlier transaction standardization efforts went into a hole and never\n&gt; found their way out.  Too many variations, too many arcane theoretical\n&gt; arguments (some of which I participated in, and would like to get\n&gt; those months of my life back...)\n\n&quot;months&quot;? Did you come in towards the end ;-) ? I measure it in years!\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
