Suppose the following:\n\nCompanyA wants to submit an Purchase Order to CompanyB.  CompanyB must first\nbe able to review (according to it&#39;s internal business rules) the PO request\nbefore is creates a matching order in it&#39;s own system.  Upon reviewing the\nPO request, CompanyB must indicate to CompanyA what it&#39;s decision was.\n\nNow, here is the process I have been mulling over...\n\nCompanyA creates a PO in their system.  The system assigns the following URI\n(please ignore the whole http thing, in case you are also reading the\nxml-dev list lately) to it:\n\n    http://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12345\n\nThe system then connects to a pre-arranged URL\n(http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests) at CompanyB.  It POSTs the above URI\nto CompanyB.  CompanyB returns the following URI as an ack response:\n\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests/12123\n\nCompanyB now turns around and submits a GET request to CompanyA at\n&quot;http://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12345&quot;.  CompanyB goes off to think\nabout it.  At any time, CompanyA can submit a GET request at\n&quot;http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests/12123&quot; to determine the current status\nof the request.\n\nA bit later, CompanyB agrees to the PO.  It creates a matching sales order\nin their system and assign the following URI to it:\n\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/55824\n\nCompanyB then submits a POST request to\n&quot;http://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12345&quot;, where the content is the URI of\nthe new sales order in their system.  CompanyA now updates their internal\nrecords to indicate that the PO has been accepted.  From this point on,\nCompanyA can submit GET requests to &quot;http://CompanyB.com/Orders/55824&quot; to\ndetermine the status of the order.\n\n\nNow, here is why I have been thinking about this pattern...  We talk about\nthe PO that CompanyA submits to CompanyB.  In other discussions, we have\nthought of POSTing the PO to a URL at CompanyB, where the URL represented...\nwell.. no one can really agree what it represents.  However, in the flow I\nillustrated above, the resources are very clear:\n\n    http://CompanyA.com/PurchaseOrders/12345  : This is the URI of the PO\nresource.  Period.  The PO is owned by CompanyA and so is the URI.\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests  : This is the URI of the resource\nthat PO requests are submitted to.  This is owned by CompanyB, as is the\nURI.\n    http://CompanyB.com/Orders/Requests/12123  : This is the URI of the\nspecific request made be CompanyA.  It is owned by CompanyB, as is the URI.\n\nAt this point, both parties have the URIs necessary to query each other as\nneeded.  Once CompanyB makes the decision and creates new resource (the\nsales order), it then give the associated URI to CompanyA.  Again, at this\npoint, both parties have the URIs necessary to query each other.\n\nAnother thing I should point out here is that at no time was any data POSTed\nother than URIs.  CompanyA never POSTed their PO to CompanyB.  This is\nbecause they are sending a representation of their resource to another\nresource owned by CompanyB.  Likewise, CompanyB did not return a status.  It\nreturned a URI.  Later, CompanyB POSTs a URI, not the order itself.  At all\ntimes, CompanyA and CompanyB exclusively use GET to get the representation\nof the resource they want.\n\n\nAs I think about this model, it seems extremely clean to me.  There is no\nambiquity about what is the resource, what is the representation of a\nresource, etc.  I would think this approach to be quite flexible, scalable,\neasy to implement, etc.  So, what am I missing?  ;~)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
