There&#39;s a significant overhead\n&gt; that comes with Java development (and I could recount a number of\n&gt; failures stemming from a perception that Java was simply &quot;better&quot;\n&gt; somehow, when if fact PHP turned out to be the much more practical, and\n&gt; ultimately successful, choice).\n\nThe original point was that mod_php is somehow the better alternative,\nbecause Ruby and Java don&#39;t have the same level of support for shared\nhosting.  But that feature is also a liability, it focused PHP in a\nparticular direction at the expense of other capabilities that are\nwell developed in the Java, .Net, Ruby and Python worlds.\n\nYou can get too involved in Java to miss on opportunities where PHP is\nthe much better choice, but in reverse you can get too involved in PHP\nto miss on opportunities where PHP simply doesn&#39;t cut it.  And the\nshared hosting model, while really great for a lot of things, is also\npoor perfomer on others.\n\n&gt; Ruby is another matter. I don&#39;t feel like deployment is completely\n&gt; settled yet. If/when it is and deployment &quot;best practices&quot; are well\n&gt; understood and well established, I do think it&#39;s benefits over PHP would\n&gt; be salient.  But it&#39;s not the case just yet.\n\nAgain it depends on what you&#39;re doing.  I had an easier time setting\nup reverse proxy into Rails than setting up PHP so it executes code\nbut never accidentally serves the script over to the client.  YMMV.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --peter keane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I am not the world&#39;s hugest fan of PHP -- I prefer Perl myself and am\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  constantly amazed at the community surrounding Python (though I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  not yet had the pleasure of deploying a Python web application). I just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  think that discussions of &quot;what&#39;s the best programming language for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  web application development&quot; are quite often asking the wrong questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  When debates about batch capabilities in the AtomPub discussions came\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  up, I was charmed by a Roy Fielding post where he mentioned that he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  likely reach for &quot;a shell script and curl&quot; when faced with the task of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  posting 10,000 entries. It just got me thinking -- the language, to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  large extent, just doesn&#39;t matter. Do what&#39;s simple & practical.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  --peter keane\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  [0] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/os-php-flexobj/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  [1] http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg01117.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; I wouldn&#39;t say one is more Web than the other.
