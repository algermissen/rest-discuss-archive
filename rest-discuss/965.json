An XML document is a data structure;\n&gt; the hyperstructure of the Web is a data structure.  Some data structures can\n&gt; encode algorithms --- for example, an XSLT transform is an XML data structure\n&gt; that is also a Turing-complete algorithmic language.  The hyperstructure of the\n&gt; Web is not an algorithmic language.\n\nSounds like hand waving to me. As you admit below, Turing-completeness\nis irrelevant because neither model is Turing-complete.\n\n&gt; It is well-known that algorithms can represent things that cannot be explicitly\n&gt; represented without computation.  If URIspace is intended to contain all possible\n&gt; information --- and I assume that it is --- then non-generative naming and\n&gt; hypermedia are not sufficient by themselves to refer to all the things URIspace\n&gt; is intended to contain.  Generative names are not Turing-complete algorithmic\n&gt; languages either, of course, but they do provide a mechanism by which references\n&gt; to objects may be computed. \n\nAs do query parameters.\n\n&gt; ....  Without generative names, the Web can contain things\n&gt; that cannot be referred to without a priori knowledge of the thing.\n\nIf someone tells you that his website is organized as\n/foo/$year/$month/$index then you HAVE a priori knowledge of all of the\nthings so addressed. It&#39;s just a very compact syntax for that knowledge.\nUsing a query you can reference the *same thing*, through one level of\nindirection.\n\ndocument(http://www.foo.com/bar?year=...&$month=...&index=...#xptr(//@href))\n\nThe only question is whether the $-variable to URI mappings happens on\nthe client or the server. The set of addressable objects is exactly the\nsame.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
