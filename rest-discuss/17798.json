Clients do not rely on a list of procedures (RPC),\nan object-graph=\r\n (OO), or a list of fixed URIs, etc. in order to make\nrequests and process =\r\nresults. Clients are &quot;bound&quot; not to the object\nmodel, view, etc, but to the=\r\n media type and the hypermedia elements\n(links and forms, etc.) within that=\r\n media type definition.\n\nThis binding to the hypermedia controls within a m=\r\nedia type means\nchanges on the server in the RPC list, object model, URIs u=\r\nsed to\nexpose functionality, etc. will have no &quot;breaking effect&quot; on the\ncli=\r\nent (since the client only cares about the hypermedia controls\nthemselves).=\r\n And that means the two parties and independently evolve\nover time (use new=\r\n procedure lists, add/remove object models, etc.)\nw/o running the risk of &quot;=\r\nbreaking&quot; each other (as long as it is the\nhypermedia controls that are use=\r\nd as &quot;shared understanding&quot;).\n\nFor this reason, what is represented by a re=\r\nsponse *does* matter, but\nnot in ways traditionally understood by &quot;local&quot; p=\r\nrogramming models\n(RPC, OO, etc.). What is represented is that _state_ of t=\r\nhe app, not\nthe programming style (OO, etc.) of the server implementation.\n=\r\n\nHopefully that makes some sense&lt;g&gt;.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://=\r\ntwitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 26, 2011 =\r\nat 02:57, danhaywood@...\n&lt;dan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ... =\r\nor doesn&#39;t it matter?\n&gt;\n&gt; The consensus would seem to be to for the former =\r\n(use cases + view models). =A0On the other hand, all representations have a=\r\n media type, the point of which is to allow the client and server to evolve=\r\n independently. =A0That being the case, why does it matter what is being re=\r\npresented?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; Dan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
