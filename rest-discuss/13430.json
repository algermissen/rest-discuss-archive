Media type versioning assumes that the same server instance\n&gt; &gt; sup=\r\nports all versions. But larger systems may not be able to support\n&gt; &gt; multi=\r\nple versions on the same runtime.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many times a single cluster can serve=\r\n all the versions that are\n&gt; supported. On the other hand, there is no reas=\r\non requests could not\n&gt; be dispatched to different environments based on th=\r\ne mime type.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; b. It further assumes versioning changes can be represen=\r\nted by\n&gt; &gt; representations. In reality, versioning changes do bring in new\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; resources and new processing flows.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, many changes require=\r\n the introduction of new flavors of\n&gt; resources. That would usually indicat=\r\ne the need for a new media type\n&gt; because new flavors of resources obviousl=\r\ny mean new (or significantly\n&gt; changed) process flows. I don&#39;t really see h=\r\now either media type or\n&gt; URI based versioning would be better or worse in =\r\nthis situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; c. The purported benefit of versioning by media types=\r\n is that client-\n&gt; &gt; side databases don&#39;t need to be changed since the URIs=\r\n are the same.\n&gt; &gt; This is fine in small systems, but migrating a client fr=\r\nom one version\n&gt; &gt; to another version may require not just code changes, bu=\r\nt database\n&gt; &gt; upgrades. This may be due to changes in the information cont=\r\nent of\n&gt; &gt; representations that the clients need to store,.\n&gt;\n&gt; Migrating a=\r\n client from one version of an API to another does often\n&gt; require many cha=\r\nnges. However, many changes will not necessarily\n&gt; invalidate of all the bo=\r\nokmarks (ie, persisted references to\n&gt; resources) that clients have collect=\r\ned. URI based versioning\n&gt; effectively locks clients that require bookmarki=\r\nng into the version\n&gt; they started with.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; d. Not every HTTP level soft=\r\nware can distinguish between\n&gt; &gt; representation of a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe, f=\r\nortunately all the HTTP software i am familiar with has\n&gt; support for speci=\r\nfying and retrieving the values of HTTP header\n&gt; fields. Any software that =\r\ndoes not support this very basic feature\n&gt; does not really support HTTP reg=\r\nardless of its claims. With that\n&gt; capability you can implement content neg=\r\notiation pretty trivially.\n\nWhile it may be somehat tangential to this thre=\r\nad, the fact that some\ncommon browsers (IE and Firefox if memory serves??) =\r\nsend bad Accept\nheaders ended up being a deal breaker for conneg in our cas=\r\ne.\n\n--peter\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Given all these, even though URI based versioning looks=\r\n inelegant, URI\n&gt; &gt; based versioning is more pragmatic, and is proven to wo=\r\nrk.\n&gt;\n&gt; Things often look inelegant because they are. URI based versioning\n=\r\n&gt; can be made to work for some situations and many applications, but not\n&gt; =\r\nwithout a disproportionate level of effort. URI based version is not\n&gt; more=\r\n pragmatic, just more common. It has many downsides and the only\n&gt; thing it=\r\n has going for it is that it is more common. Despite the\n&gt; implication othe=\r\nrwise, media type based versioning has been used\n&gt; successfully in the real=\r\n world.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Peter Williams\n&gt; http://barelyenough.org\n&gt; \n\n"}}
