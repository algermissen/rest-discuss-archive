The trick with that is\n&gt; that you have to retrieve the object before knowing what type it is if you\n&gt; want to provide a representation.\n\nYou&#39;re right. The UUIDs are unique even across &quot;types&quot; of resources. So the\npatients/ or orders/ &quot;prefixes&quot; aren&#39;t really necessary. Since we have to\nhave some URI to list all resources of a given type to start with, I guess I\nthought that it would make sense to use those URIs as &quot;containers&quot;. Of\ncourse, since all of these URIs are retrieved via links in representations,\nit doesn&#39;t really matter what they look like as long as they&#39;re unique.\n\nWith regards to your &quot;trick&quot; are you talking about the implementation of the\nservice? I wasn&#39;t trying to think that far ahead yet but I think I see what\nyou mean now. If all that&#39;s specified is the UUID in the URI, the code\nimplementing the service would need to figure out what table to query into\nin the database before it can get the information to return a\nrepresentation. That could be costly. So having the type in the URI makes it\neasier for the implementation to dispatch to different code for different\ntypes of resources (while still being opaque to the client).\n\n&gt; Another issue is what happens if a user\n&gt; replaces &#39;patients/UUID&#39; with &#39;doctors/UUID&#39; but uses the UUID of a\npatient.\n&gt; (you are going to make doctors into numbers too, not just patients,\nright?)\n\nShouldn&#39;t you get a 404?\n\n&gt; &gt; What I really love about the idea is that each representation could\n&gt; contain an xml-stylesheet PI so that\n&gt; &gt; we could easily traverse the model using IE6\n&gt; Yeah - cool stuff. I haven&#39;t played with this much in the past few years,\nso\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the best way to get &#39;device independence&#39; - essentially\n&gt; user-agent detection. Should the URI of the XSL return different XSL for\n&gt; different devices? Should there be multiple PIs in the XML? Should the PI\nin\n&gt; the XML be different for different user-agents? etc...\n\nThat&#39;s a good idea. Of course, working in a Microsoft-only shop makes this\nreally easy. (But living in a fully standards-compliant world would make it\neven easier.)\n\nJason\n\n\n\n\n"}}
