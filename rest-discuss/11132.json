While you are\nright - this is nothing new or special, it is something that i think\nshould be considered when designing public resources. In the example\nthat started this thread, I assumed that:\n   /team/cubs?view=csv\n   /team/cubs?view=json\ndid, in fact share the same data and therefore made my comments\nregarding this case.\n\nSecond, I agree that, in the above example, each representation is a\nactually different resource. I also agree that just because two\nresources *look* like they share the same underlying data, they may\nnot, in fact share the data and should not be assumed to share that\ndata. I also agree they should be treated as their own resources for\ncaching purposes.\n\nThanks for the chance to clear up my remarks.\n\nMikeA\n\nOn Mon, Aug 4, 2008 at 8:41 PM, Sebastien Lambla &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; My OpenRasta framework maps the following urls per resource.
