Bowman wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But on the server side you need to make an &quot;XPointer query&quot; URL:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;PUT /foo.xml?xpointer=//root/child/text()\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;How would you handle ETags and If-Match:?Â  (Would the ETag be for that \n&gt;&gt;specific subset, or for the base resource?Â  Etc.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The idea is to separate out the contents to be updated, into its own \n&gt; resource with its own URL.  So the ETag would be for the new resource, not \n&gt; the base resource.  A conditional PUT would do nicely.  From the client \n&gt; perspective, the semantics are &quot;full replacement&quot; and the client doesn&#39;t \n&gt; need to care that the new nodeset gets merged into another resource.  \n&gt; Repeating the server-side XPointer GET reflects the changes and assigns a \n&gt; new ETag.\n\n\nBut in practice I think many clients are likely to have a full \nrepresentation from the base resource (locally cached with its etag) and \nwant to update just one field.  If they simply want to blast the value \nin and overwrite any other updates for that field, they&#39;re fine.  If \nthey want to say &quot;update this one field, but only if the overall \nresource hasn&#39;t changed since I last retrieved it, because I want to \nmaintain local consistency within the resource&quot;... there&#39;s nothing they \ncan do, really, except PUT the entire resource with its etag.\n\nThis is one of the attractive propositions of PATCH:  Presumably the \netag you use is the one for the entire resource, even though you&#39;re only \nupdating a subset.  This is useful.  It&#39;s also one of the requirements \nfor Web3S apparently (they allow ETags to apply to URL hierarchies to \nsolve the issue).\n\n&gt; But this is what I really want to do...\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_darcs:Patch_theory\n&gt; \n&gt; DARCS&#39; strength over other RCS solutions are its powerful merge and undo \n&gt; capabilities.  I keep thinking along these lines, but applying DARCS patch \n&gt; theory to XML trees seems a bit daunting.  I&#39;d like to PATCH using Content-\n&gt; Type: application/darcs+xml if only it existed...\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
