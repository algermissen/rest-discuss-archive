I&#39;ve worked with a few different clients that treated 201\nor 204 as an exception. Obviously those were non-conforming clients,\nbut they still had to be dealt with.\n\nI deal with clients like that by checking if they sent a Request\nHeader called X-crippled-client with a boolean true value; if so, I\nalways send back a 200 OK, regardless of what the correct Status Code\nshould be, and I include the correct Status Code in a Response Header\ncalled &quot;X-true-status-code&quot;.\n\nAvi\n\nOn 7/2/07, Tim Olsen &lt;tolsen718@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On 6/27/07, James Gray II &lt;lists@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Are there any good rules of thumb about when to use the 204 status?\n&gt; &gt;  Is a response to a DELETE action not an appropriate time to use it?\n&gt;\n&gt; RFC 2616 covers both these questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; See:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#status.204\n&gt;\n&gt; http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#DELETE\n&gt;\n&gt; -Tim\n&gt;\n\n-- \nAvi Flax\nLead Technologist\narc90 | http://arc90.com\n\n"}}
