I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I\n&gt; used REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database.\n\nI think that the primary cause of your confusion is trying to map CRUD\nto PGPD (Post, Get, Put, Delete).  This is not necessarily so; POST can\ncreate, update OR delete, it can also do other non-CRUD things like, for\nexample, update a list of RSS feeds or get the latest version of a\nsoftware release from a SVN repository.  PUT can create a new resource,\nor it can update an existing resource.  The difference between a PUT and\na POST is that a POST will not necessarily act on the resource that it\nis POSTed to, but a PUT will always act on the named resource.\n\nFor example:\nPUT /sometable/somedata updates or creates the somedata resource\nPOST /sometable maybe creates or updates a somedata resource\n\nOr at least, that is how I understand things.\n\n\n"}}
