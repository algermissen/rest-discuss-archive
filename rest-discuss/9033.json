I&#39;m not very well-versed\nin the literature on how/why leases would complicate this more,\nreferences appreciated.\n\nRecently I&#39;ve been reading Mark Mc Keown et. el. paper on HARC and\nco-allocation (http://www.allhands.org.uk/2006/proceedings/papers/624.pdf)\nand then also the Promises in\n(http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p36.pdf).\n\nMy random ideas here are just me trying find the underlying concept\n(intuitively) from the papers I read and two obvervations:\n* reserving things (like a hotel room, or spot to get my hair cut) is\na successful and very old practice.\n* I haven&#39;t found a distributed system with direct support for\nmultiple readers (besides MOM which uses transaction)\n\nI think in a previous message in this thread I said there might not be\nan answer, or a viable REST method to fill this gap. It might just be\na problem that must always be solved explicitly by the client and the\nserver; without infrastructure support.\n\nJohn\n\nOn 6/14/07, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; John D.
