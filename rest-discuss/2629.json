The problem with DELETE does not apply for GET.\n&gt;\n&gt; While RFC 2616 says that &quot;the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical\n&gt; requests is the same as for a single request&quot;, this is not the case\n&gt; with DELETE, regardless of response codes, unless the representation\n&gt; being deleted never existed (In which you can always return a 404 -\n&gt; while not stated explicitly as legal in the spec in regards to\n&gt; DELETE, it seems to be implied from other areas).\n\nHuh? The side effect for the single DELETE is that the URI mapping is\nremoved. The side effect for N DELETEs (where N &gt; 1) is the same -- the URI\nmapping is removed. What&#39;s the problem here?\n\n&gt; On the first DELETE, there is a side-effect - a representation is un-\n&gt; mapped.  On the second and subsequent DELETEs, there is no\n&gt; representation to un-map, so the side effect /cannot/ take place.  It\n\nIt doesn&#39;t have to anymore.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nJulian\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n"}}
