So, your collections would become:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot; action=&quot;/search&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;query&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;select name=&quot;limitSets&quot; multiple=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;option value=&quot;http://example.org/collections/2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;option value=&quot;http://example.org/collections/54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/option&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;/select&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/form&gt;\n\nyes, exactly. That is fine, because the client only reacts to what it  \nhas been given by the server. The problem with that for me is the  \namount of possible identfiers in my case.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; or something like that anyway.  The advantage being the media type\n&gt; definition provides the semantics of how to put things together as\n&gt; opposed to out-of-band knowledge...\n\nMy concern is not so much regarding the out-of-band knowledge I think  \nbecause the use of the URIs as parameter values can be specified in  \nthe parameter or link relation spec.\n\nI think my concern is more around the lifetime of the URI since it is  \nnot presented by the server as part of the definition of the next  \ntransition (the form submission) but (possibly a long time) before.\n\nI am also not sure if there is a self-descriptiveness issue, because  \nthe meaning of the submission depends on the current state of the  \nresource identified by the URI.\n\nIIRC there has been a thread somewhere (cannpt find it right now) that  \ndiscussed the placement of an order with just the shopping cart URI as  \nopposed to an explicit listing of the intended items.\n\nPOST /orders\n\ncart=/users/65525/cart\n\nas opposed to\n\nPOST /orders\n\n&lt;order&gt;\n   &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n   &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n   &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --tim\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
