But no, I have the same\n&gt; &gt;issue with either, a) expecting the query results in the POST response,\n&gt; &gt;and b) expecting the query results in a GET on the returned Location\n&gt; &gt;URI.  The issue is not the mechanism, it&#39;s the additional expectation,\n&gt; &gt;since it&#39;s not one that can be met by other resources and therefore\n&gt; &gt;neither uniform nor RESTful.  \n&gt; \n&gt; But in this case it&#39;s not being handled by a single\n&gt; resource but a set of resources, each that behaves\n&gt; uniformly with respect to the methods used.\n\nThe first resource - the one to which the query document is POSTed -\ndoes not present the same interface as other resources because it&#39;s\nmeeting an expectation which other resources do not meet.  If it were\nto do it completely self-descriptively, its interface would have\nanother method, such as &quot;QUERY&quot; or some such which makes the difference\nin expectations explicit rather than implicit.\n\nFWIW, this is the same point the &quot;document oriented SOA&quot; proponents have\nyet to absorb.\n\n&gt; Said another way, I couldn&#39;t POST a query\n&gt; &gt;document to any old resource and expect it to understand that I expect\n&gt; &gt;back the results, nor could I assume that anything I got back from an\n&gt; &gt;arbitrary resource was the results of the query document being processed\n&gt; &gt;as a query.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what do you think would be the most RESTish way to handle this?\n\nThere isn&#39;t a way to handle this RESTfully, I don&#39;t believe.  That\nleaves a handful of &quot;almost RESTful&quot; solutions (including the two I&#39;ve\noutlined), and which one is best certainly depends upon your\napplication.\n\nI think the idiom I describe in that message you referenced is a good\none because it gives you a URI for the results of a query.  But it also\ncosts you an extra network round trip.  A superior hybrid approach might\nreturn the query results on the POST response and also provide the URI\nvia Content-Location.  I haven&#39;t tried the hybrid approach though.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
