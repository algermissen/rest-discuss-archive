By processing I mean parsing and\ndealing with the XML, so nor=\r\nmal http caching isn&#39;t going to help.\n\nWhat&#39;s been requested is that the cl=\r\nients can customize the\nrepresentation to contain only what they need. They=\r\n want to be able to\nsay don&#39;t send me these nodes, only go this deep with t=\r\nhose nodes,\netc. So, in essence, they want to personalize the representatio=\r\nn.\n\nI see a couple of options to accomplish this.\n\nAssuming the URI is:\n\nht=\r\ntp://example.com/v1/foo/{id}\n\n1) Have preset levels of granularity:\nhttp://=\r\nexample.com/v1/foo/{id}/shortform\nhttp://example.com/v1/foo/{id}/mediumform=\r\n\nhttp://example.com/v1/foo/{id}   &lt;--- default long form\n\n2) Use a complex =\r\nquery string:\nhttp://example.com/v1/foo/{id}?shownode1=3Dtrue;node2depth=3D=\r\n3\n\n3) Allow the client to post a set of rules and get a separate URI\nspace =\r\nfor that rule set:\n\nPOST to http://example.com/v1/\n  shownode1=3Dtrue\n  nod=\r\ne2depth=3D3\n\nResult:\n201 Created\nLocation: /vi/{rulesetid}/\n\nThen the clien=\r\nt would traverse to:\nhttp://example.com/v1/{rulesetid}/foo/{id}\n\nNote: the =\r\nrule set would not be unique to each client. If two clients\nhad the same ru=\r\nles, they would use the same URI.\n\n\nOption 1 would be the easiest, but it&#39;s=\r\n limiting due to the fixed set\nof granularity levels.\n\nOption 2 would requi=\r\nre a rather complex query string but would provide\nthe flexibility.\n\nOption=\r\n 3 seems the slickest but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s as RESTful as I\nthink it is.=\r\n\n\n\nHas anyone else had to deal with unusually large representations that\nne=\r\ned to be trimmed down on a client by client basis? Personally, I&#39;d\nrather a=\r\nvoid the whole issue and add more hierarchy to the URI space\nand have the c=\r\nlients act a little less dumb. That may be an option in\nthe end but for now=\r\n this is all I have to work with so any opinions\nwill greatly appreciated.\n=\r\n\nCheers,\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
