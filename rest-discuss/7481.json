All we can observe are  \n&gt; the URIs and representations. Based on these we can predict server  \n&gt; behavior without ever understanding what a resource really is.  \n&gt; Unlike quantum mechanics, it&#39;s not true that there really aren&#39;t  \n&gt; any hidden variables, but it&#39;s very useful to act as if there  \n&gt; aren&#39;t any.\n&gt;\nI think the way Roy defined resource in his thesis was as the mapping  \nover time of the values or entities, the actual data returned. I  \nthought that made sense, and it really is something. The resource is  \nthat mapping over time. He doesn&#39;t define it as the conceptual thing  \nbehind the curtain that whose representations result in that mapping.  \nIt *is* that mapping.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
