The main advantage =\r\nas I see it is that they will have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; less to learn and that we will will =\r\nconverge on a more stable set of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; relations which in turn will make it p=\r\nossible to create more generic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; code for indexing, crawling etc. Just ma=\r\nke sure you create and define\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your own rel types according to the atom =\r\nspec [2].\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Personally i don&#39;t much like atom:link. =C2=A0It trades cla=\r\nrity for a false\n&gt;&gt; promise of re-use. =C2=A0The idea that a great deal of =\r\nleverage will be\n&gt;&gt; gained by reusing atom:link in other formats seems not =\r\nbe born out in\n&gt;&gt; reality. =C2=A0Parsing arbitrary xml documents, looking f=\r\nor link elements\n&gt;&gt; and then doing things with them without understanding t=\r\nhe semantics of\n&gt;&gt; the overall representation sounds pretty far fetched to =\r\nme. =C2=A0(Is that\n&gt;&gt; edit link for the requested resource, or is it for a =\r\ndifferent\n&gt;&gt; resource whose information is contained in the requested one.)=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The `&lt;{name} href=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt;` pattern promotes the meaningful name of th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; item to the highest possible level. =C2=A0This increases the clarity o=\r\nf the\n&gt;&gt; representation. =C2=A0As a client writer i care about semantics of=\r\n the\n&gt;&gt; various parts of the representations far more than i care about the=\r\nir\n&gt;&gt; types. =C2=A0I can guess with little effort that an element named &#39;ed=\r\nit&#39;\n&gt;&gt; will contain a link. =C2=A0With a link element i must scan to the ri=\r\nght\n&gt;&gt; until i find the @rel in order to understand the purpose of the\n&gt;&gt; e=\r\nlement. =C2=A0I&#39;ll take clarity over vague, unrealistic, promises of\n&gt;&gt; re-=\r\nuse any day.\n&gt;\n&gt; To me &lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;{name}&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt; is equal to &lt;{=\r\nname} href=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt;.\n\nI agree they are semantically equivalent.  However, the=\r\n arrangement of\ninformation in an atom:link element increases the effort re=\r\nquired to\nunderstand it.  Not much of course, but a little.  I prefer not t=\r\no\nintentionally increase the complexity of my representations unless it\npro=\r\nvide a very real benefit.\n\n&gt;&gt; Besides, we have the link header[1] which is =\r\nbetter, in every\n&gt;&gt; imaginable way, than atom:link for expressing common re=\r\nlations. =C2=A0It\n&gt;&gt; does not require the client be able to parse a particu=\r\nlar format and\n&gt;&gt; it unambiguously relates the link to the requested resour=\r\nce as a\n&gt;&gt; whole.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1]:&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; L=\r\nink headers is mostly useful for linking *entire resources* to other\n&gt; *res=\r\nources* while atom:link gives you a more fine grained linking mechanism.\n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;m not against link headers in anyway, just saying it&#39;s a slightly\n&gt; diffe=\r\nrent thing.\n\nExactly.  The ambiguity of link elements (due to their fine\ngr=\r\nainedness) works against any real world re-use of them.  Clien have\nto unde=\r\nrstand the whole representation that contains link elements in\norder to use=\r\n those links.  Therefore, there is little, or no,\npractical benefit to usin=\r\ng atom:link elements but there is some cost.\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
