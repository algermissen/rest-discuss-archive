Does REST  \nsuggest a way to think about the responses of POST? The response of a  \nGET is a representation of the resource at that URI. What is the  \nresponse of a POST?\n\nClaude, for example, may be returning a request ID in the post  \nresponse, or maybe the URI of the request resource he created, after  \nsomeone posted a request to the sensor. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if a  \nPOST response should be thought of as a kind of method return value.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
