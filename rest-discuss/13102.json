I have one part of my\ndesign\n        &lt;br&gt;\nright now where I&#39;m unsure what a good RESTful approach would be.\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nI have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some parts that\n        &lt;br&gt;\nclients are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an uncommon\ncase;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nI would think that navigation links, for example, would typically not\nbe\n        &lt;br&gt;\nmodifiable in a PUT.) So is it better to:\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n1. Require clients to submit all the read-only parts unmodified in a\nPUT,\n        &lt;br&gt;\nand respond with an error code if they are absent or altered?\n        &lt;br&gt;\n2. Take advantage of the leniency allowed in a server&#39;s implementation\nof\n        &lt;br&gt;\nPUT to ignore the read-only elements (or their absence)?\n        &lt;br&gt;\n3. Separate read-only elements into a sub-resource that only supports\nGET?\n        &lt;br&gt;\n(This may not be feasible for resources which must be created as a\nwhole.)\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nor something else?\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nSecond, there are some elements that are modifiable or not depending on\n        &lt;br&gt;\nthe privileges held by the (authenticated) user. I would think this\nwould be\n        &lt;br&gt;\nexpressed by a difference in the representation returned to the client,\nbut\n        &lt;br&gt;\nwhat should that difference be?

Is there a\n        &lt;br&gt;\ngenerally accepted way to do this, perhaps with form templates or\nXForms?\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;d be interested in any comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m\njust\n        &lt;br&gt;\nlooking at it from the wrong angle.\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\nThanks,\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n-- Jim\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n      &lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
