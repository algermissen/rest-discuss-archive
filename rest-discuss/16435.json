We\n&gt; want the knowledge barrier needed to be as low as possible because it&#39;s good for business.\n\nI am not sure we really do want to allow people to mis-use HTTP base\nservices in a way that increases the maintenance costs of both the\nserver and client.  That being said, if you really feel such support\nis required a media type based extension is a good way to provide it.\nFor example, &lt;http://example.com/foo.msv&gt; for version 1 and\n&lt;http://example.com/foo.msv2&gt; for version 2.  The use of extensions\nimplies to the humans involved that these two resources are basically\nthe same except for the the format of their representations.  Your\nserver development platform might even provide this for free.  (RoR\ndoes, for example.)\n\nIt is worth noting that it is better, whenever possible, to extend the\nexisting media type rather than creating a new incompatible version.\nHowever, that is not always possible.  When a break with the past is\nrequired creating media types is the best available solution.\n\nPeter\n&lt;http://barelyenough.org&gt;\n\n"}}
