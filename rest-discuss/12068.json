If you want bookmarking of\ntemplates, as a specific jump through hypertext to a resource\nrepresentation, you would need template + identifiers, which results in one\nURI.\n\nWhy would you go through the extra effort?\n\nYou don&#39;t bookmark the way to build a search, you bookmark the result of the\nsearch.\n\nIf you wanted to store URI template and associated values, then you\neffectively have the semantic equivalent of a URI and I would question why\nyou need that.\n\nTo put it into laymen&#39;s terms, while you can choose the name of your kids\nusing whatever process is contextually acceptable in your family, a\ngovernment form registering your baby&#39;s name shouldn&#39;t have to care about\nhow you came to the name, but only about the name itself. While the process\nmay be repeatable that by applying it you would end up with the kid, the\nlevel of indirection has no value. And it&#39;s brittle because for your next\nkid you may change the way you chose the name, without changing the name of\nyour first kid. And other families would adopt a completely different way.\n\nSo as far as the government bookmarking people with their name, they treat\nit as a fairly opaque identifier, even if you don&#39;t.\n\nSeb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
