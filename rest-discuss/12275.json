The same resource\n&gt; state can be overlayed by multiple resources, just as an XML document\n&gt; can be represented as a sequence of bytes or a tree of individually\n&gt; addressable nodes. Likewise, a single resource can be the equivalent\n&gt; of a database stored procedure, with the power to abstract state\n&gt; changes over any number of storage items.\n&gt; \n\nA collection resource can handle a DELETE request made against the\ncollection, as a stored procedure to delete all member resources of the\ncollection (composite resource, if you will).  The problem in this\nthread, is the desire to have the client request that the server delete\nmembers 2, 5 and 9 from a collection.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you find yourself in need of a batch operation, then most likely\n&gt; you just haven’t defined enough resources.\n&gt; \n\nTrue enough.  A collection resource can be created which contains only\nmembers 2, 5 and 9 and treats DELETE as a stored procedure to delete all\nmembers along with the collection resource itself.  No problem.  But,\nhypothetically, why?  I still see no compelling reason to optimize\nDELETE at the expense of the visibility which allows proper cache\nbehavior.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I see this as a validation of the idea that whenever you&#39;re trying to\n&gt; &quot;batch&quot; operations, you should probably have another resource that,\n&gt; when acted upon, has the power to change multiple states behind the\n&gt; scenes, without letting the client or intermediaries know what\n&gt; happened.\n&gt; \n\nThe problem is, the nature of a batch operation is that of a client\nrequest for multiple actions to be taken. This is different, in my\nmind, than a stored procedure. A stored procedure doesn&#39;t need to tell\nthe client anything about actions the client didn&#39;t request, true\nenough.  But, if the client is requesting a batch job, then the client\nneeds to be notified of the results of each aspect of the batch job.\nSee BDELETE. You can&#39;t claim that something like /deleteFactory is a\nstored procedure, when it&#39;s accepting variable input from clients.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Just because your operation may cause caches to serve staled\n&gt; representations doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re unrestful. Quite the opposite,\n&gt; the power of REST is indeed in its capacity to be  temporarily\n&gt; inconsistent.\n&gt; \n\nTrue enough, but...\n\nThere&#39;s nothing to be done about caches serving stale data, not with\ncache control headers anyway.  But there is the special case of DELETE,\nwhich allows immediate cache expiration on those specific caches between\nthe user requesting the DELETE and the origin server.  Deleting members\n2, 5 and 9 from a collection in any way other than three separate DELETE\noperations eliminates even the *possibility* of prompt expiration of 2,\n5 and 9 from those specific caches pertinent to the user who requested\nthe DELETE (other users have no compelling need for immediate\nexpiration). You&#39;ve gone from 99% probability that deleted resources\nwill be expired from the cache of the user who requested the delete, to\n0%.\n\nNot using DELETE to delete may be allowed as a stored procedure, but\nit brings about none of the desirable behavior of DELETE and has no\nadvantages other than saving what&#39;s most likely a trivial amount of\nnetwork round-trips -- requests that don&#39;t even have message bodies.\n\nIf a client is requesting multiple deletions, then the client needs to\nissue multiple DELETE requests.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
