I do have a couple of minor comments.\n\n[15] Fact: POST is insufficiently defined\n\nI wouldn&#39;t make that claim.  Rather, much of the activity done today  \nvia POST would have much greater advantage if it instead used one of  \nthe more constrained methods.  However, POST as a kind of &quot;process  \nthis&quot; catchall method has great value when used well -- especially for  \nwell-defined protocols resting (ha ha) on top of HTTP.  AtomPub makes  \none very good and well-defined use of POST, and a future HTTP  \nextension or application may make another.  POST&#39;s relatively open  \nspecification is what allows this growth.\n\n[29] Fact: access control precludes scalability\n\nI&#39;m with Stefan and Bill in disagreement on this one.  This is only  \ntrue if your access control method scales poorly, and at that point is  \nequivalent to saying &quot;poorly-scaling systems scale poorly&quot;.  There is  \nnothing essential to access control that makes this true.  Many  \nsystems happen to implement access control in a centralized way, but  \nthese implementations do not reflect any true general fact.\n\nEnjoy giving the talk.  I&#39;m interested to hear how it goes.\n\nBest,\n\n-Justin\n\n\n\n"}}
