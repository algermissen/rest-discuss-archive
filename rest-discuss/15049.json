Here&#39;s an example:\n\n&lt;link rel = &quot;royalhope.nhs.uk/linkrels/appointment/updateContactInfo&quot;\n        uri = &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n\nI find the link relationship to be very specific, reducing the value\nof a uniform interface (a client would need to be familiar with this\nspecific rel type). In addition, the naming of the rel type in the\nexample looks suspiciously much like another place to put a method\nname. I would be more comfortable with something like:\n\n&lt;link rel = &quot;edit&quot;\n        type=&quot;vnd.contact.info&quot;\n        uri = &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n\nBut, there some very smart people who have reviewed the article, so\nI&#39;m sure there&#39;s a good reason for that example being that way it is.\nIt would be very interesting to hear your views on this.\n\n/niklas\n\n"}}
