For instance, &quot;defining the media type&quot; refers to existing,  \n&gt; universally known media-types or the definition on (extended) new  \n&gt; ones?\n\n\nIn my understanding, it refers to defining new media types such as  \n&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; Since he later refers to &quot;existing standard media types&quot; I guess the  \n&gt; first part refers to &quot;new&quot; media-types, that will point to a  \n&gt; solution like the one Subbu used in his article.\n\n\nYes, although I found it easier to interpret Roy&#39;s remark in the  \ncontext of Web-scale applications instead of those that might be  \ninternal in an enterprise.\n\n\n&gt; And what exactly are &quot;extended relation names&quot;? Or for that matter,  \n&gt; what are &quot;relation names&quot;?\n\n\nIn &lt;link rel=&#39;XYZ&#39; ref=&quot;http://example.org/1234&quot; /&gt;, &quot;XYZ&quot; is the  \nrelation name.\n\nSo my interpretation is: Whenever you design a RESTful application,  \nyou should primarily be thinking about the content types. Whether  \nthey&#39;re completely proprietary, re-use some existing media type or  \nsomething in between is orthogonal.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
