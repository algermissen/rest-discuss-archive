Although\nthis is not allowed in FTP, HTTP isn&#39;t the same paradigm -- HTTP isn&#39;t\na filesystem, and filesystems don&#39;t allow the late binding of\nrepresentation to resource.\n\nHTTP has been extended over the years to include both WebDAV and Atom\nProtocol.  While it leaves the issue of deleting a collection\nunaddressed, AtomPub does constrain DELETE to the semantics of FTP\nDELETE -- confirming my expectation that DELETE should behave as FTP\nDELETE in a generic interface.  But then there&#39;s WebDAV...\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-9.6.1\n\nUgh.  Then again, that makes perfect sense if your goal is to use HTTP\nfor filesystem operations.  This use of DELETE works, because WebDAV\nisn&#39;t concerned with the late binding of representation to resource.\nBut, &quot;expected&quot; behavior is a subjective notion.  IMHO, the &quot;common\ncase of the Web&quot; contains far more applications which allow member\nresources to belong to multiple collections, than there are Web\napplications implementing a filesystem paradigm over HTTP.\n\nSo let&#39;s take a look at another, unrelated protocol... IMAP:\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-6.3.4\n\nWhile DELETE is used to delete mailboxes, this is only allowed if the\nmailbox is empty.  To remove all member resources, a flag is set on\neach one and the EXPUNGE method is called.\n\nI suppose my definition of expected behavior, is the difference between\na generic interface and a uniform interface.  You can have a uniform\ninterface where DELETE removes all members of a collection, but I\nwouldn&#39;t call that a generic use of DELETE, since so many other methods\nhave been defined to accomplish that specific task, not to mention\nprotocols like FTP and IMAP clearly disallowing DELETE&#39;s use for\nremoving all members of a collection.\n\nSo, in a generic sense, I don&#39;t expect DELETE to remove member\nresources, because in the common case of the Web (as opposed to that of\na filesystem), members may belong to more than one collection, while\nprotocols either leave the deletion of collections undefined or assign\nthis task to some other method.  The generic semantics of DELETE are\ndefined by FTP, IMHO.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
