The filter criteria cannot be specified as part of t=\r\nhe\nURI as it is a fairly complex object that needs to get into the request\n=\r\nbody.  So my request-line will be GET &#92;data with the filter criteria\ncoming=\r\n in via the entity body. However, from various sources, I gathered\nthat it =\r\nis not recommended to send data as part of the entity body when\nusing GET, =\r\nDELETE and so on. However, I could not find this mentioned\nexplicitly in th=\r\ne HTTP standard. If that is correct, then would it be\nadvisable to model th=\r\ne Filter as a resource to which I POST my criteria\nand it then gives back t=\r\nhe result set? The request-line then would be\nsomething like POST &#92;filter w=\r\nith the filter criteria coming in via the\nentity body.\n\nThanks in advance\nS=\r\nuyog\n\n\n\n"}}
