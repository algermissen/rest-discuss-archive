The format that the links are occurring within, or the targets of the links themselves? I&#39;d argue the latter. You can take that argument too far, of course, but generally I see profiles as describing format conventions, and link relations as describing behaviours of resources. Of course, some of those behaviours can be &quot;produce this format&quot; and some of the formatting conventions can be &quot;link to something with this behaviour&quot;.\n\nwith atompub i think you&#39;re right about &#39;edit&#39; links in entries, so if i \naggregate atompub-capable feeds, then my aggregate feed may not be \natompub-capable, but the entries may very well be. but if my feed is \nindeed able to accept POST requests to create new entries, then there \nsimply is no link to represent that fact, and a profile URI would be one \nway to represent that capability in the feed itself.\n\nwhile i see your point about profile more being about format conventions \n(this is where HTML started this idea, and in that case my podcast \nexample might better fit your bill), i think eventually the line between \nformat conventions and behavior is fuzzy. maybe the best way for me to \ngo forward is to finish the examples section, and then we can start more \nconcrete discussions whether this would be the kind of scenario we&#39;d \nlike to encourage for &#39;profile&#39; links.\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
