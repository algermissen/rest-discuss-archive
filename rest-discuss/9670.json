My question is which redirect to use. My\n&gt; &gt; first thought is that I would use a 301, but then, the more I\n&gt; &gt; thought about it I think a 302/307 is the correct choice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What does the group think?\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a temporary redirect, so 307 would be correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, where&#39;s the point in forcing the redirect at all?\n&gt;\n From the POV of a GET a 303 and 307 are very similar.  However, a 307 \nis a &quot;temporary redirect&quot; which to me implies &quot;I&#39;ve moved the resource \nover there for a little while, but next time you need it it might be \nback here.&quot;  While a 303, &quot;see other,&quot; says to me &quot;I understand what \nyou&#39;re looking for, and I&#39;m sending you over there to get it.&quot;\n\nWhy redirect?  Quoting the RWS book &quot; The 303 status code is a good way \nto canonicalize your resources. You can make them available through many \nURIs, but only have one &quot;real&quot; URI per representation. All the other \nURIs use a 303 to point to the canonical URI for that representation. \nFor instance, a 303 might redirect a request for \nhttp://www.example.com/software/current.tar.gz to the URI \nhttp://www.example.com/software/1.0.2.tar.gz.&quot;\n\n From the same source, 302 is to be avoided due to ambiguity issues.\n\n-- Pete\n\n"}}
