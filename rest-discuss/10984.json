This is like the PATCH\n&gt; discussion. I think most people thought it was wrong to PUT a\n&gt; special differences document -- but I was unconvinced.\n\nThe reason to have PATCH is that if the only way to patch a\nresource is to PUT the patch, then clients have no way to *store*\npatch documents (ie. use PUT for PUT semantics).\n\nThat might not be a concern in *your* web app, since yours might\nbe able to accept only a limited range of media types in PUT\nrequests, so the question of disambiguating patching from storing\nmight not come up. But in the general case it is an issue.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s wrong to suppose that any agent is going to PUT these\n&gt; documents to some unsuspecting server and something bad will\n&gt; happen. I&#39;m not going to let my agent PUT these anywhere I\n&gt; haven&#39;t been instructed to by some hypertext I received\n&gt; earlier, or by reading the documentation.\n\nIf S3 is the only place that demands as well as understands such\nrequests, you are not engineering for serendipity.\n\nAlso, keep intermediaries in mind.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
