I&#39;ve failed to find comprehensible demonstrations\n&gt; of a simple use of rest.\n\nA Web browser is a simple use of REST.\n\n&gt; Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why so few understand it.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t seem likely.  I think that if I were in the business of\nselling REST as an idea, just as thousands of consultants have sold\nOOSD/CORBA/COM/DCOM/WS, one after another, then a lot of people would\nknow about something called REST (though it would be a bit mangled).\n\nSoftware development is still driven by fads and fashion.  In order\nto become well known, you need to hire some sexy models and generate\npress.  Personally, I&#39;d rather that people just learn a little more\nabout software architecture and principled design.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
