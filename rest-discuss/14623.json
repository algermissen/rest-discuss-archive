Following all REST-related developme=\r\nnt on the WWW is somewhat a hassle since there&#39;s a lot to follow: this disc=\r\nussion group, a lot of blogs covering both REST and non-REST stuff and a lo=\r\nt of other pages (projects, frameworks, news articles, scientific papers...=\r\n) which are hard to search for since &quot;REST&quot; is not a very good query.\n&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nhat I&#39;d like is a brief overview of only and all things REST that happened =\r\nin the last week and to be able to receive that overview through my feed re=\r\nader. A blog feels right for delivery, but raises the question of who would=\r\n maintain it and how. A collaborative approach where everyone would send li=\r\nnks to a single person which would compile the blog post would work. An alt=\r\nernative would be creating a wiki page for collaborative link gathering, bu=\r\nt leaves the question of how the overview would be delivered on a weekly ba=\r\nsis. Another alternative would be to use this group for both gathering link=\r\ns (as replies to a single request-for-links weekly post) and publishing the=\r\n weekly overview (as a new weekly post).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, what do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Cheers,\n&gt; Ivan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
