Since I don&#39;t see the point of an IDL when using the\nhypertext constraint, I don&#39;t see the point of IDL-as-microformat,\neither.  I&#39;ve also never seen the point of a machine-readable service\ndocument as an endpoint user-agents need to consult before taking\naction -- what results is some other architectural style (where the\nsemantics of the URI mappings vary based on some hash table at an\n&quot;entry point&quot; URI, instead of remaining RESTfully static).\n\nSo I can&#39;t answer your questions, since I don&#39;t know how this &quot;fits in&quot;\nwith REST, either.  What hRESTS/SA-REST look like to me, is kludged-in\ntooling support to more efficiently produce the HTTP APIs most folks\n*call* REST APIs these days.  Remember, I don&#39;t judge APIs by whether\nthey&#39;re RESTful, only how well they&#39;re suited to their purposes, so I&#39;m\nnot scorning any project which may result in better APIs -- my *opinion*\nis that this approach may even lead some people _to_ REST&#39;s hypertext\nconstraint, so it&#39;s probably a good thing, just mis-labeled.\n\nWe&#39;ve also discussed machine-readability many times; there are those\nwho prefer machine-targeted data types, and those who prefer RDFa.  I\nsee RDFa as a superior solution to microformats, for any purpose, and\nhRESTS is another example of why -- instead of a general-purpose parsing\nmodel, each microformat has its own unique parsing model, usually\ndefined as XSLT -- as is the case with hRESTS/SA-REST, which GRDDL-maps\nits microformat to RDF, begging the question &quot;why not just use RDFa?&quot;\n\nInteroperability is a concern; modular XHTML encompasses Xforms, which\ngives the ability to &quot;describe&quot; more HTTP-method-rich APIs, but those\ntokens collide with hRESTS -- which really shouldn&#39;t use class=&#39;label&#39;\nbecause that collides with &lt;label&gt;, as well.  The reason it&#39;s easier to\ncreate RDF vocabularies than it is to create markup languages (or even\nmicroformats), is the vocabulary author doesn&#39;t have to worry about if\nbrowsers&#39; javascript forms-modules reserve &#39;label&#39; as a keyword, etc.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don&#39;t see how using hRESTS/SA-REST would result in the\nRESTful APIs I&#39;ve done using Xforms/RDFa; although by solving what I\nwho doesn&#39;t use tooling for API development considers a non-problem, I\ncan see how I could&#39;ve produced functionally-equivalent HTTP APIs in a\nfraction of the time.  Which seems to be the problem with any effort to\nmass-produce RESTful APIs, what&#39;s lost in translation is all the design-\nfor-longevity goodness which distinguishes REST APIs from HTTP APIs.\n\nThe hRESTS/SA-REST approach intrigues me from an HTTP tinkerer\nperspective, supporting server-parsed server-configuration-on-the-fly.\nOn one hand, this would philosophically violate separation of concerns;\nOTOH, long-term maintenance of Web systems based on static files may\nbenefit from having fewer files to edit.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Where does SA-REST fit in? The service model [1] looks very\n&gt; similar to the service model of hRESTS [2]. According to the diagram\n&gt; at the start of  [2], SA-REST sits on top of hRESTS - why then does\n&gt; SA-REST  define a similar service model? \n&gt; \n\nPerhaps you should ask this of the authors, since they&#39;re the same?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. According to [2], SA-REST supports faceted search. Where are\n&gt; &quot;p-lang-binding&quot; and &quot;data-format&quot; [2] coming from? Why is there no\n&gt; mention of them in the W3C Submission ? [3].\n&gt;\n\nThat is a good question, and if it&#39;s machine readable, then where are\nthose tokens like PHP and Java defined and how is versioning accounted\nfor?  I understand the problem of mashing up services which use\ndifferent formats, but I don&#39;t understand the rationale of solving this\nby making services searchable by data format (or any other &quot;facet&quot;),\nlet alone what it has to do with REST other than attaching that name to\nnew IBM products which support this feature.  Seems like tight coupling\nto me, hence my confusion on calling it REST...\n\nParticularly when their example of a RESTful Web Service is a JSON-RPC\nendpoint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is no  lifting/lowering. How is\n&gt; this done when using SA-REST?\n&gt;\n\nWhat *are* lifting and lowering?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
