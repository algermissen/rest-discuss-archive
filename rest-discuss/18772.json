You may still be able to achieve a truly RESTful system with this, b=\r\nut you may also end up with an RPC based thing. The question is if we can b=\r\nlame the framework? Should we also take into account the restrictions the f=\r\nramework can add to avoid this situation?\n\nInteresting!\n\nWilliam.\n\n--- In r=\r\nest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Apolo=\r\ngies for my phone :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Possibly. I didn&#39;t think of this as much when I =\r\nwas reviewing the article.\n&gt; The problem I see with the progression model i=\r\ns that it has a black and\n&gt; white sense to it, you are either level 0, leve=\r\nl 1, level 2. The more I\n&gt; think about it though it breaks down.\n&gt; \n&gt; For e=\r\nxample take the hypermedia case. You can build a hypermedia based\n&gt; system =\r\nthat is not RESTful. I can have a framework that makes it easy to\n&gt; offer u=\r\np links, but yet it does not support the other constraints of REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nother example is the whole client thing. OK, my REST framework supports\n&gt; a=\r\nn HTTP client, but the server implementation is pretty lousy. What level\n&gt; =\r\nis it? And how is that information useful?\n&gt; \n&gt; Have some sort of point sys=\r\ntem across different categories helps me to make\n&gt; an informed decision abo=\r\nut how well this framework will support my needs if\n&gt; I am looking to build=\r\n a RESTful system.\n&gt; \n&gt; My $.02\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 7, 201=\r\n2 at 2:30 PM, William Martinez Pomares &lt;\n&gt; wmartinez@\n\n\n"}}
