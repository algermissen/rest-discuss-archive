It&#39;s easy to add\nyour own schemes as extensions.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  If so can you explain why you can&#39;t support a non-UI authentication\n&gt;  scheme?\n&gt;\n\nNo real reason. It&#39;s a chicken/egg situation. FWIW, I&#39;m working on\nseveral HTTP authentication issues right now. I hope some of that work\nwill make into Firefox 3. There&#39;s also a W3C group working on UI\nissues, and it seems like they have a clue. That will probably miss\nFx3, unless they happen to finish quickly AND produce something\nuseful... but it is a standards body, so that is a tall order.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n"}}
