They would get my version instead\n&gt; &gt; of theirs, and may not even be authorised to do so. It is really a\n&gt; &gt; perversion of the URI system.\n&gt; I tend to think of the personalized page as a separate resource that \n&gt; indeed deserves a separate URL. For instance,\n&gt; http://www.examplestore.com/shoppingcarts/elharo\n&gt; is one resource and\n&gt; http://www.examplestore.com/shoppingcarts/johnsmith\n&gt; is another. Indeed in some context I might want to send such a \n&gt; personalized page to another user. For instance I might fill up my \n&gt; shopping cart and then fire off an e-mail to the purchasing dept. \n&gt; containing the URL http://www.examplestore.com/shoppingcarts/elharo and \n&gt; ask them to complete the transaction.\n\nAgreed. However when I said &quot;personalised&quot; I was not referring to the\nshopping cart url for john smith. I was referring to the\nhttp://www.examplestore.com/tshirts/akira\nproduct url that recognises elharo is the user, and provides a link to\nhis shopping cart as part of the html. The naieve implementation is not\nrestful, however the use of client-side includes could lead to a restful\nimplementation:\n\n1) elharo downloads &lt;http://www.examplestore.com/tshirts/akira&gt;, getting\nthe same version as everyone else does\n2) Some Javascript contained or linked in the returned html causes the\nbrowser to look up http://www.examplestore.com/personalisedlinks/elharo\n3) The two documents are sewn together on the client side. REST is\npreserved at the network level. Caching works properly for everyone.\n4) When eharo sends the &lt;http://www.examplestore.com/tshirts/akira&gt; link\nto johnsmith, johnsmith sees a link to his own shopping cart on the\npage. He doesn&#39;t see a link to elharo&#39;s page.\n\nThat&#39;s the difference between personalisation and ownership. If it is my\nurl and only applicable to me, it should have my name or anonymous user\nid lodged in there somewhere. If it is a url that has meaning\nindependant of who is looking at it but is more friendly if it includes\ndata pertaining to myself, then the friendly version is a personalised\nurl.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
