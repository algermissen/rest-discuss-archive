Here is an excerpt of my\n&gt; conversation with Steve:\n&gt; \n&gt; [quote]\n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to agree with one aspect what you are saying Steve - namely\n&gt; that the SQL analogy is a red herring.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I am going to disagree with the thrust of the statement that\n&gt; &quot;reducing PUT to bitblt() is a pretty limiting view of HTTP.&quot;\n\nThis is all down to server policy. If a server doesn&#39;t want a client to be\nable to create arbitrary resources without first going through, it can\ncomplain vehemently that the request is Forbidden along with an explanation\nof why. That said, if it makes sense for the application running on the\nserver to allow clients to create resources with arbitrary URIs, all&#39;s well.\n\nPurity is for schmucks. Unless there&#39;s a good reason why PUT shouldn&#39;t be\nallowed create resources, the application should accept it.\n\nK.\n\n"}}
