But HTTP is not a transport protocol,\nit&#39;s an application protocol, and moreover is the only application\nprotocol around, AFAIK, which embodies the REST constraint of the\nuniform interface (amoungst others).\n\nI like to say that REST requires that you use other protocols as if you\nwere using them through an HTTP proxy.\n\n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t mandate the use of XML for the content of request and response\n&gt; messages, but XML is the most common data representation used in messages.\n\nNot by a long shot.  I&#39;d expect that HTML is far and away the most\npopular format.  RSS is probably the most popular XML based format,\nbut way behind HTML.\n\n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t mandate the use of absolute URLs for links to related resources\n&gt; included in response messages. Clients can assume that relative URLs in a\n&gt; response can be resolved relative to the URL they used to send the request\n&gt; that returned the response.\n\nIt&#39;s a bit more complicated than that, but you&#39;re right that REST\ndoesn&#39;t mandate that.  REST only mandates self-descriptive messages\nwhich, and as it relates to URIs, requires that all of them be able to\nbe interpreted absolutely in the context of a given message.  See\nsection 5 of 2396bis;\n\nhttp://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#reference-resolution\n\n&gt; REST frowns upon responses like this that require clients to know how to\n&gt; construct URLs to retrieve additional data.\n&gt; &lt;musicCollection&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;owner name=&quot;Mark Volkmann&quot;&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;artist id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;artist id=&quot;43&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/musicCollection&gt;\n&gt; In this example, a client would construct a URL like the following to\n&gt; retrieve a representation of an artist in the collection.\n&gt; http://host:port/webapp/artist/19. \n\nWell, if the processing rules behind the media type used described how\nto construct URIs based on information contained within the document -\ne.g. if &quot;id&quot; were defined to accept relative URIs - then that would\nbe RESTful, I&#39;d say.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
