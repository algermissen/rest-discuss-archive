It&#39;s resources are repre=\r\nsented using xml and or json, so xsd and JSON Schema will be used to descri=\r\nbe representations. These requirements are basically things i have to live =\r\nwith, so I need to figure out how to do my best here. \n\nNow what i need to =\r\ndo is...\n\n1. be able to version the service&#39;s resources\n2. include a refere=\r\nnce to an xml or json schema in my responses\n\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;m thinkin&#39;. I&#39;l=\r\nl create custom vendor mime types for both xml and json. Each will contain =\r\ntwo mime type parameters; &quot;profile&quot; which points to the json or xml schema,=\r\n and &quot;v&quot; which specifies the version of the representation. \n\nBelow is a si=\r\nmple example of what the wadl might look like. In short, the example resour=\r\nce supports four different response representations, two of which are xml; =\r\nversions 1.0 and 2.0, and the other two are json; versions 1.0 and 2.0. And=\r\n each points to a schema via profile parameter. \n\nFWIW - This approach is b=\r\nased on things I&#39;ve read around here, Peter William&#39;s blog, Bill Burk&#39;s RES=\r\nT book, and the latest JSON Schema draft (recently 03, congrats!).\n\nAny tho=\r\nughts?\n\n&lt;resource path=3D&quot;example&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;method name=3D&quot;GET&quot; id=3D&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n   =\r\n   &lt;response&gt;\n         &lt;representation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.=\r\napp+json;profile=3D/path/to/exampleV1.0.json;v=3D1.0&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;represent=\r\nation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.app+json;profile=3D/path/to/examp=\r\nleV2.0.json;v=3D2.0&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;representation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vn=\r\nd.custom.app+xml;profile=3D/path/to/exampleV1.0.xsd;v=3D1.0&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;re=\r\npresentation mediaType=3D&quot;application/vnd.custom.app+xml;profile=3D/path/to=\r\n/exampleV2.0.xsd;v=3D2.0&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/response&gt;\n    &lt;/method&gt;\n&lt;/resource&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
