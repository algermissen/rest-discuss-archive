This can be used to offset the style&#39;s costs \nin efficiency.&quot;\n\nIn a similar way you wouldn&#39;t call evolvability a constraint\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\nAlan Dean wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt; Within REST, Caching is both an optional and a highly desirable \n&gt; constraint.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is optional in that it is easy to imagine a RESTful implementation \n&gt; that never actually expects caching by User-Agent or any \n&gt; intermediaries (this would be the same as implicitly labelling \n&gt; everything as non-cacheable). Such an implementation would, however, \n&gt; be inefficient to some degree which is why adding the constraint is \n&gt; desirable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Apr 15, 2010 at 12:28, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:mike@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;      \n&gt;\n&gt;     Is caching a necessary constraint from an arch style pov?\n&gt;\n&gt;     It seems like a consequence/benefit of the other constraints\n&gt;     (cs/layered/stateless/uniform interface) rather than one in its\n&gt;     own right\n&gt;\n&gt;     Cheers,\n&gt;     Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
