I guess one way to solve it is, \n&gt;&gt; that the page downloaded would be a sort of &quot;shell&quot; with JavaScript that \n&gt;&gt; downloaded the common features (e.g. page layout in HTML), and the \n&gt;&gt; customer-specific features (e.g. statement line items in XML), from \n&gt;&gt; different URLs, and then combined them.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Or xml with an attached xslt. The look of the page is always the same\n&gt; but the data is always different.\n&gt;   \nRight.\n&gt;&gt; It seems that REST, at least in the HTML context, relies heavily on \n&gt;&gt; client-side processing, like JavaScript.  It discourages server-side \n&gt;&gt; construction of pages.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Not necessarily. In dynamic applications like this one yes it\n&gt; does. But javascript isn&#39;t the end of client side processing.\n&gt;   \nTo what else are you referring?  Java applets?  ActiveX?  Flash?
