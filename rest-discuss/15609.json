Every written text needs\ninterpretation beca=\r\nuse it is a expression of what the author thinks,\nnot the thinking itself (=\r\nI was almost going to say that the written\ntext is a representation of what=\r\n the author thinks, not the thinking\nitself) because no one can go into ano=\r\nther people&#39;s mind, and even if\nit could the mental processes of reasoning =\r\nwill probably be different.\nThere is even a philosophical discipline for it=\r\n, Hermeneutics\n(Heidegger, etc...). For me there is even a additional layer=\r\n of\ninterpretation, since I&#39;m a Portuguese native reading in English...\n\nIn=\r\n this issue, although I do understand the benefits regarding cache\nthat Eri=\r\nc points, I fail to see why that - assigning URI to each and\nevery represen=\r\ntation of a resource - should be the norm and not the\nexception. Because th=\r\nat defeats the purpose of &quot;manipulation of\nresources through representation=\r\ns&quot;. Because if you assign a URI to\neach representation they are in fact res=\r\nources, not representations...\n\nNow Roy Fielding clearly separates these tw=\r\no concepts in 5.2.1.1\nResources and Resource Identifiers and 5.2.1.2 Repres=\r\nentations, and\nagain in 6.2.1 Redefinition of Resource and 6.2.2 Manipulati=\r\nng\nShadows, and as far as I remember he only advocates the attribution of\na=\r\n URI to a specific representation when that representation is so\nimportant =\r\nthat should be considered as a &quot;thing&quot; on it&#39;s own (don&#39;t\nhave a quote for =\r\nthis, thou, so I may be wrong).\n\nEven in respect to caching - and I don&#39;t k=\r\nnow much about it since we\nwork in a intranet where that problem is not pre=\r\nssing - why would you\nwant to cache a specific representation? Doesn&#39;t that=\r\n defeat the\npurpose of content-negotiation? Suppose a UA send a Accept of\na=\r\npplication/pdf, application/html\nwith the pdf having more quality, and the =\r\nserver at that time is only\ncapable of serving html. And that one week late=\r\nr the same client makes\nthe same request and the server is now capable of p=\r\nroducing pdf.\n\nIf the html representation has it&#39;s own url, wouldn&#39;t a inte=\r\nrmediary\nsend back the html representation when if the same request reach t=\r\nhe\nserver it will be back with pdf? Isn&#39;t that the purpose of\ncontent-negot=\r\niation? Again, by no means I have a good understanding of\ncache mechanisms.=\r\n..\n\nSince I know this is a subject easily &quot;flammable&quot; let me say in\nadvance=\r\n that I&#39;m trying to clarify myself, because my understanding\ndoes not match=\r\n what people with more knowledge in this area than me\nare saying (even if o=\r\nften they don&#39;t agree themselves) - not flame\nanybody...\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like t=\r\no make a pseudo-argument from authority. Normally, arguing\n&gt; from authority=\r\n is a logical fallacy. However, in the case of REST,\n&gt; there is one person =\r\nwhose word must be taken as fact, and that&#39;s Roy.\n&gt; Over the years that I&#39;v=\r\ne participated here, this topic has come up\n&gt; often. The list always explai=\r\nns that best-practice is to follow the\n&gt; Identification of Resources constr=\r\naint by assigning URIs to variants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, if I or anyone else had been w=\r\nrong about this, I can guarantee\n&gt; with certainty that Roy would&#39;ve jumped =\r\nin, called us out, and\n&gt; explained how we were getting Identification of Re=\r\nsources wrong, or why\n&gt; the follow-best-practice advice was wrong. But, tha=\r\nt hasn&#39;t happened.\n&gt; Given all the opportunities to correct this informatio=\r\nn, if it were\n&gt; truly wrong, one must assume that Roy would be leading the =\r\ncharge to\n&gt; point out our error.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fact that Roy hasn&#39;t stepped in an=\r\nd declared assigning URIs to\n&gt; variants &quot;bad practice&quot; or a violation of RE=\r\nST, over the years, implies\n&gt; that such advice is indeed correct. So I&#39;m sa=\r\nying, don&#39;t take my word\n&gt; for it, but do think twice about pointing out RE=\r\nST errors here -- if\n&gt; that were the case, I highly doubt it would have esc=\r\naped Roy&#39;s notice\n&gt; and fallen to others to point out...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
