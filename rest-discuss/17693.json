I&#39;m might be off here, but it seems like a smell where your ob=\r\nject relationship semantics that hide behind your resource space are leakin=\r\ng on the client side. This knowledge is and should be hypermedia driven by =\r\nthe server. I might considering modeling the resource interaction different=\r\nly.\n\nAssuming that there is a need to construct these relationships on the =\r\nclient side using resource identities; I wonder how one might construct the=\r\nse resource identities and their representations (relative or absolute) giv=\r\nen that they may be represented differently for different content types? \n\n=\r\nRegards,\nDilip Krishnan\ndilip.krishnan@...\n\n\n\nOn Aug 23, 2011, at 4:1=\r\n3 PM, Robert Brewer wrote:\n\n&gt; Jim wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m currently implementing an A=\r\nPI which requires some requests to\n&gt;&gt; reference other resources exposed by =\r\nthe API.
