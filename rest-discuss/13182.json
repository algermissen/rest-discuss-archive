I&#39;ve created fully RESTful SOA infra-structures in a few\norganisations, =\r\nbut of course they&#39;re mostly hidden behind firewalls\nand whatsnot. As to mo=\r\nre open infra-structure, it&#39;s around and\ngrowing, like AWS, Google and Atom=\r\nPub, and lots of &quot;Web2.0&quot;\napplications these days have a REST API (well, mo=\r\nre REST than RPC is\ngrowing these days). And note that in a RESTful world, =\r\nthe traditional\nnotion of what an API is is also a bit shady.\n\n&gt; You can&#39;t =\r\njust take the REST constraints into account. =A0You have to take the\n&gt; curr=\r\nent sets of supporting techonologies, which may not support the full set\n&gt; =\r\nof concepts behind the REST constraints.\n\nDo you here mean the limitation o=\r\nf browsers with GET and POST? I guess\nthat is sort of true, although I susp=\r\nect the world wasn&#39;t ready for\nDELETE and PUT at the time. Of course, the u=\r\npgrade should have\nhappened by now, but this will all change (and I spsect =\r\nrather\nrapidly) as HTML5 / XHTML2 enters the field. I&#39;m excited! :)\n\n&gt;&gt; The=\r\n REST constraints either require or encourage coarse-grained,\n&gt;&gt; self-descr=\r\niptive, resource-oriented, hypermedia-driven, loosely-coupled\n&gt;&gt; interactio=\r\nns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed in theory, but I haven&#39;t seen that in practice.\n\nWhat do you=\r\n mean, &quot;in practice&quot;? Is there some part of your daily\nonline life where yo=\r\nu don&#39;t interact with a system that might be doing\nsome proper REST magic? =\r\nAny Google, Yahoo or Amazon service or system,\nfor example?\n\n&gt;&gt; If you want=\r\n a widely-distributed system tolerant of\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries, can exploit cac=\r\nhing, is inherently stateless (allowing\n&gt;&gt; many scaling possibilities) with=\r\n lazy upgrading, REST fits rather well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say that I have those nee=\r\nds. =A0I know that the current REST oriented\n&gt; platforms can support some o=\r\nf these features, but I can&#39;t say that there is\n&gt; any platform that can imp=\r\nlement those features really, really well.\n\nOk, so what are they missing or=\r\n not doing well? What does &quot;well&quot; mean?\n\n&gt;=A0However, I keep on talking to\n=\r\n&gt; experts that express that there&#39;s some disconnect between REST principles=\r\n\n&gt; and practice.\n\nWho are you talking to? :) I think most of us would think=\r\n that a lot\nof claims of being RESTful isn&#39;t actually RESTful, but there&#39;s =\r\nplenty\nof stuff out there (and growing every day as people understand the\np=\r\nrinciples more) that is.\n\nA suggestion would be to search the net for syste=\r\nms with AtomPub\nsupport, and Voila! you got lots of examples of well-done R=\r\nEST.\n\n&gt;=A0So my question is how do we get from the ideals you describe\n&gt; (a=\r\nnd I agree are the goals of REST) into a road map that a business can\n&gt; imp=\r\nlement?\n\nStart by implementing AtomPub, and the rest will follow. It has a\n=\r\nbasic model which works for a lot of things (no, it&#39;s not just about\nbloggi=\r\nng) and is extendable. Google use it, others use it, and it&#39;s\nRESTful.\n\nOf =\r\ncourse, if you want to, you can abuse any &quot;right&quot; technology to\nmake it go =\r\n&quot;wrong&quot;, so there are no guarantees anywhere. But that&#39;s\njust life and orga=\r\nnic growth. :)\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n-- \n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alc=\r\nhemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n--- http://shelter.nu/blog/ -----------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n------------------ http://www.google.co=\r\nm/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n\n"}}
