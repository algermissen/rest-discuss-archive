I think you&#39;re making my point. Indeed, putting a one-off  \n&gt; representation inside a generic media type is &quot;stepping off the  \n&gt; generality cliff&quot;. But adding a few extension elements to a fairly  \n&gt; general purpose media type like SensorML is taking gentle step down  \n&gt; the generality slope.\n\nNope :)\n\nPutting a one-off representation of a one-off media type inside a  \ngeneric media type is NOT stepping off the generality cliff. That is  \nwhat media types are meant for. Media types describe the &quot;type&quot; of a  \nrepresentation.\n\nIn fact, folks coming from the WS-*/schema background should love  \nmedia types. Concrete media types describe the data. Where as,  \nextensions added to general purpose media types do so only weakly.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; representations for each new application. An example of this is  \n&gt; the RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a transport protocol,  \n&gt; but rather an &quot;application protocol&quot;, albeit a VERY application  \n&gt; neutral one. What we haven&#39;t seen yet, even from the REST &quot;camp&quot; is  \n&gt; much in the way of fairly generic ATOM entities to go\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am really confused by this. By adding a &quot;fifth constraint&quot; I  \n&gt; thought this report is agreeing with the other four constraints, and  \n&gt; hence that HTTP is an application protocol. Not so? How does WOA  \n&gt; treat HTTP? As an application protocol or as a transport protocol?\n&gt;\n&gt; WOA treats HTTP as an application protocol. What&#39;s wrong with  \n&gt; &quot;nested&quot; application protocols? APP is an application protocol  \n&gt; &quot;nested&quot; in HTTP. And GData is nested in APP. Or how would you put it?\n\nIt is not a &quot;nested&quot; application protocol. APP is just a profile of  \nHTTP for a certain class of resources, viz., feeds and entries. GData  \nis an APP like protocol, and in Google&#39;s words &quot;GData is a new  \nprotocol based on the Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0 syndication formats, plus  \nthe Atom Publishing Protocol.&quot;\n\nThe statement on &quot;RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a transport  \nprotocol&quot; prompted my question. Now I understand that it is rhetorical.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  inside the ATOM &quot;envelope&quot;. Many REST examples using ATOM step  \n&gt; off the same cliff.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you give an example please? How would you build an app that  \n&gt; does not fall of this cliff.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I was going to use APP for a contact management protocol.  \n&gt; Contrast putting my own one-off, not well thought through,  \n&gt; idiosyncratic schema for contact information as the payload of an  \n&gt; APP entity (stepping off a cliff) vs. using the hCard microformat as  \n&gt; the basis for contact information inside the APP entity (stepping  \n&gt; down the slope).\n\nThat is a choice that the server app will have to make based on the  \nkind of clients it is expecting to serve. If its its clients are  \nbrowsers, it may of course, choose to use this microformat for the  \ncontact info. But if it is a different kind of machine client, the  \nserver might choose a specific media type for that purpose. Or it may  \ndo both.\n\nBut this is all rehashing a general principle of reusing shared  \nstructs for representations when it makes sense.\n\nI wish this report chose a more direct term to describe what you  \nmeant. IMHO, the term &quot;application neutrality&quot; is extremely vague and  \nbroad, and it appears to mean something that it is not.\n\nSincerely,\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://www.subbu.org\n\n\n\n\n"}}
