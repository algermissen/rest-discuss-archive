I have a feelin=\r\ng there&#39;s a mismatch between my semantics and the community&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve se=\r\nen it said over and over again that passing session IDs (typically in a coo=\r\nkie) is generally considered unRESTful.  I&#39;ve also seen it said over and ov=\r\ner again that passing credentials along with every request is considered ve=\r\nry RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reasonings are unclear to me, though.  Considering the=\r\n &quot;statelessness&quot; principle of REST, if I think of a RESTful architecture as=\r\n one in which every request passes all the information needed for the serve=\r\nr to fulfill the request, then I don&#39;t see how passing session IDs (for ins=\r\ntance) in requests violates that principle.\n&gt; \n&gt; To me, a session ID is a s=\r\nimple alphanumeric string.  Authentication credentials are (typically expre=\r\nssed as) a simple alphanumeric string.  Both strings persist on the client.=\r\n  Both strings are received by the server and are compared to information h=\r\neld on the server in order to make decisions on the server about how to pro=\r\ncess the request, and thus the content of the strings can dramatically affe=\r\nct the server&#39;s response to the request.\n&gt; \n&gt; When approached from this way=\r\n, I lose the meaning behind the distinction.  What am I misunderstanding?\n&gt;=\r\n\n\nIs your cookie passing all the application state it needs to pass or is s=\r\nome of that state held by the server, such that your request could not be l=\r\noad balanced between multiple servers?\n\nCheck out http://www.ics.uci.edu/~f=\r\nielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm section 6.3.4.2.\n\nEb\n\n\n"}}
