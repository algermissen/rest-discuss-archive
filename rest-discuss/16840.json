I thought through the implications of some of the alternatives\n&gt; and wrote up my thoughts as a blog post\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html&gt; . This triggered a very deep debate in the comments,\n&gt; revealing a number of subtleties that I had missed. I feel that the\n&gt; debate deserves a bigger forum than the comments of my blog, so I&#39;m\n&gt; moving it here.\n\nFifth option, DELETE then POST\n\n"}}
