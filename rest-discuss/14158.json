I&#39;ve written up some of these\nissues at:\n\nhttp://alimanfoo.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/rest-not-so-easy-data-sharing-networks-and-the-atom-publishing-protocol/\n\nEd Summers kindly pointed me at the rest-discuss list, and I see I\nhave a lot of catching up to do! In the mean time, any help or\nsuggestions of places to start would be extremely gratefully\nreceived. We need to move fairly quickly, so pointers to working\nsolutions and existing open-source implementations would be especially\nuseful.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAlistair\n\n-- \nAlistair Miles\nCentre for Genomics and Global Health &lt;http://cggh.org&gt;\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics\nRoosevelt Drive\nOxford\nOX3 7BN\nUnited Kingdom\nWeb: http://purl.org/net/aliman\nEmail: alimanfoo@...\nTel: +44 (0)1865 287669\n\n"}}
