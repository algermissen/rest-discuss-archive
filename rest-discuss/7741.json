Even if you  \ndid, you can always bootstrap it with one that isn&#39;t required to be  \nreliable.\n\n&gt; * POST is consumed on the POE resource, and can&#39;t be used for other  \n&gt; normal purposes. For example, I can&#39;t use this mechanism to create  \n&gt; a factory resource.\n\n201 Created + Location.\n\nCheers,\n\nP.S.
