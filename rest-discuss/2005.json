The\ntransaction idea came to me a couple days back.  The frequent PO example\nseemed like a good way to convey it.  Having said that....\n\nFrom: &quot;Roger L. Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [The first thing that happens is] CompanyA creates a PO in their system.\n&gt;\n&gt; But wait, if I am the client and I am sitting at a browser I don&#39;t want\n&gt; to create a PO from scratch.  I want CompanyB to provide me a nice order\n&gt; form to fill out.\n\nI agree.  This approach will not necessarily work for the basic browser\nenvironment you were talking about.\n\n&gt; b. The second objection I have is that CompanyA needs a Web server (or\n&gt; access to some Web server).  The typical client isn&#39;t going to know what\n&gt; a web server is, let alone how to stand one up, and put the PO into the\n&gt; correct location on the server.\n\nWell, I would not expect someone expecting to use nothing more than a\nbrowser to deal with a web server.  However, suppose instead that you worked\nfor a company (CompanyA) that did have a web server (or access to one).\nInstead of pointing your browser to CompanyB&#39;s server, you could point it to\nyour own, where a PO form(s) would take you through the process to create a\nPO for CompanyB.  The resultant PO would be stored on ServerA and you would\nthen be able to use the scenario I mentioned.\n\nOkay, this may still be more complicated than you are looking for, but I\nthink there are a number of extensions to / variations on the theme that\nwould allow the technique to be used at some level...\n\n&gt; c. I don&#39;t agree with calling it a purchase order on the CompanyA side\n&gt; and a sales order on the CompanyB side.  In my business, when a client\n&gt; sends me a purchase order I still call it a purchase order.  How I treat\n&gt; the PO may be different than how the client treats the PO.  But I still\n&gt; call it a PO.\n\nBut my model does not disagree with your view.  There is no reason you can&#39;t\ncall it a purchase order on your side.  Regardless, your PO is a different\nresource than your client&#39;s related PO.  I chose to use PO and SO to make\nthe separation of resources more clear (within my example).\n\nMore important than PO&#39;s, though, is the fact that they model itself is\nquite generic.  The use of two servers like this is quite clean (IMO),\nwhether implementing ordering systems, mail systems, collaboration systems,\netc.  The only real issue I have not been able to resolve is how to\neffectively handle access and security issues.\n\n&gt; Seairth&#39;s approach may be the correct REST one but I would like\n&gt; something more applicable to the masses.\n\nHeh.  I doubt my model is the &quot;correct&quot; one.  As you point out above, there\nare scenarios (e.g., browser only) that do not fit this model.  And it is\nnot realistic (yet) to have everyone use the model I gave.  Maybe years from\nnow, when everyone is &quot;always on&quot;, have their own web servers, etc., then\nthis model might be more universally applicable... but that&#39;s still a big\nmaybe.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
