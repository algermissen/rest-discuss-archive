The idea was to find an individual\n&gt; order by traversing an n-ary tree of uris.  Inner nodes of the tree map\n&gt; a range of order numbers to a child node of the tree.  The desired\n&gt; order&#39;s uri would be found in a leaf of the tree.\n&gt;\n&gt; I took this (baroque?) approach because the uri /order/by-number/2275 is\n&gt; so not opaque!  It felt more ReSTful to act like a browser and follow\n&gt; a chain of links to get where I needed to go.  The performance cost is\n&gt; not likely to be significant, given the predicted order load.  Plus,\n&gt; if the process that traverses the tree has any kind of lifetime, it can\n&gt; cache everything, as none of the links change.\n&gt;\n&gt; Too weird?\n\nNot weird. Sounds very hypertextual. I&#39;m not sold on that being the best\napproach though.\nMy reasoning is that the client needs to know the document format and\nmeaning - particular element names and the fact that they are relative\nreferences to more data that needs retrieval. Requiring that the client know\nthe URI format and meaning - particular path segments or query terms - seems\nvery similar to being coupled to document format.\nThe client and server both share knowledge of a value space - the actual\norder number. This shared knowledge is required in both scenarios - you need\nto know what order number to look for in the list of leaf nodes for example.\nIf knowledge of particular order numbers did not exist then finding a\nparticular order is not possible.\nDescribing that the server accepts order numbers in a portion of a URI as\nopposed to describing that the server reports the order numbers in a portion\nof XML content isn&#39;t much different to me.\nPerhaps I&#39;m just biased to using URI query terms to do lookup because it is\nsimple to code and easy to understand.\n\n\n&gt; That makes sense.  One of the next steps will be associating a status\n&gt; with each order so this is very relevant!  Using POST as you describe\n&gt; sounds like the way to go for updating the order status.  If I think of\n&gt; NOT_SEEN as the initial status, I could use the POST as you describe to\n&gt; set the status to SEEN.  So if the order is located at /order/2345,\n&gt; I could post to /order/2345/status, for instance.\nYou could POST to /order/2345 directly - POST can be used for partial update\nof a resource. If you have a resource which represents the status directly,\nyou could PUT to that instead (but I have problems with the defined behavior\nof PUT).\n\n\n\n\n"}}
