In production systems, things have to be \n&gt; well planned out and predictable or it will just be a disaster.\n\nI certainly agree with you that there are very, very few apps that *do*\napproach integration in this manner, but I don&#39;t agree that you can&#39;t\nhave apps that *can* approach integration in this manner, even in highly\nstructured, regulated and mission-critical deployments.\n\nYou bring up a great point:  &quot;if things aren&#39;t well planned out and\npredictable...things will be a disaster.&quot;  However, if you stop and\nthink about it, do you know why this is true?\n\nI&#39;ve been doing both large & small system integration for over 10 years,\nand I&#39;ve both lived through the reality you described, and also been\ntrying to find ways to make systems less brittle and more resilient to\nchange because there&#39;s two core axioms of large systems development:\n\n1) Things are going to change between when you start the system and when\nyou get it &quot;finished&quot;, if ever....\n\n2) The system is likely to live far longer than you expect it to\n\nIf your integration is based on lots of out-of-band shared knowledge\nabout the system state transitions, you do need a lot of formal planning\nand predictability in the way they work, because you code the endpoints\nbased on those assumptions.  It&#39;s really a self-fulfilling prophecy,\nactually.\n\nHowever, if you take the approach that you need to identify and expect a\nparticular number of states and transitions, each of which are specified\nwell rather than working from an API reference manual and system user\nguide (or functional specification), then you can potentially have more\nscalable, flexible and long-lived systems.  You can also end up with a\nbig mess if you don&#39;t manage it properly...\n\nI&#39;m not saying that you still won&#39;t have to go through a similar amount\nof organizational management, politics and pain to arrive at these\n&quot;interface&quot; definitions any less than you will for a more traditional\nintegration approach, but it&#39;s the difference in perspective (and\noutputs) that matter.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not saying that this approach makes sense for every system on\nthe planet, but I think it&#39;s critical to start thinking differently\nabout the way we design, implement and extend the large-scale, cross\norganisational (and multi-national, in some cases) systems used by every\none of us as businesses and individuals (directly or indirectly) each\nday.\n\nAnother key point to remember:  I&#39;m not talking about altering the\nmission profile of the particular application or system, I&#39;m simply\nfocused on taking a (perhaps radically) different approach to how those\nsystems interact to deliver the system&#39;s mission profile and the\ncorresponding long-term business objectives of those who built and\noperate it.\n\nCheers,\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S.
