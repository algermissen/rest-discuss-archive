So an item has a position in its parent list to  \nrepresent its current position. In this case there&#39;s a single list: a  \nconfigurable list of proposal status for a CRM.\n\nSo the idea is to be able to represent more or less &quot;move item {id} to  \nposition {position} and let the ones after {position} adjust their  \nindex accordingly&quot;.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
