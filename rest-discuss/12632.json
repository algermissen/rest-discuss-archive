My answer will be governed by the following\n&gt; assumptions. 1&gt; Initially when the ~100 candidate state transitions\n&gt; were presented to the client, it was the server that defined this set\n&gt; of state transitions to the client.\n\nThat&#39;s not the case. The possible transitions accumulate over time. I&#39;d \nsay it&#39;s putting too much of a burden on the server to ask it to keep \ntrack.\n\n&gt; Provided 2 is true and 1&gt; holds, a record of that set could be store\n&gt; on the server prior to sending it to the client, and a unique\n&gt; identifier (URI) that represents this set could be created on the\n&gt; server.  The end effect is that for this particular client&#39;s request\n&gt; there will exist a resource (URI) on the server that keeps track of\n&gt; the entire list of candidates in the set sent to the client.\n\nThat is a valid technique, I surmise, but it doesn&#39;t seem to fit in this \ncase. Creating such a process resource, e.g. for opening a transaction \nthat accrues further details before being committed, is reasonable when \nthere is a definite intend that it be committed sooner or latter. \nCreating numerous such resources just in case they might be needed, \nlooks like a design mistake.\n\n&gt; Another approach would be to make the selection criteria (logic) to\n&gt; be sent along with the data. This would mean that the assumption I\n&gt; made in 2&gt; is no longer valid.  JavaScript would be a particularly\n&gt; good choice for this, since it can be run on the browser and on the\n&gt; server.\n\nI have no clear opinion about shuttling business logic around between \nclient and server. However, in this case it doesn&#39;t apply as the \ndecisions to be made require access to the server&#39;s state.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
