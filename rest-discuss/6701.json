When understandability \nrequires a long URL, overall usability suffers. Language barriers and \nlocalizations introduce a set of problems. Consider the following three \nIRIs. Which most understandable? Which is most usable? Do the answers \nvary based on the context?\n\n&quot;http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A7%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%B1_%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82_%CE%9D%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%82_%CE%98%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CF%82&quot;\n\n&quot;http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Χειρόγραφα_της_Νεκράς_Θάλασσας&quot;\n\n&quot;http://tinyurl.com/wwr23&quot;\n\n&gt; I am still unclear as to what hypermedia exactly looks like\n\nHTML is a form of hypermedia. There are other forms: Atom, XHTML, \nRDF/XML, N3, SVG, ...\n\n&gt; (I&#39;ve seen zero real world examples in anything I&#39;ve read online)\n\nIf you’ve seen a Web page, you’ve seen hypermedia.\n\n&gt; I do understand the proposed benefits of REST; i.e. it is easier and faster\n&gt; to redirect one URL than all of them\n\nI’m uncertain of your meaning. It is indeed easier and faster to manage \none redirection than it is to manage more than one redirection. How does \nREST affect the number of redirections that managers must manage?\n\n&gt; it is (very arguably) easier to\n&gt; define &quot;selectors&quot; (my term) for the different services that will not change\n&gt; than it is to define URIs for the different services that will not change,\n&gt; right?\n\nI’m uncertain of your meaning. However, REST requires identification of \nresources. Applied to the Web, the constraint requires allocating at \nleast one URI for each service. (Having multiple URIs for a given \nservice is probably lousy practice.)\n\n&gt; Further, all the articles I have read about REST[,] including \n&gt; [those] on XML.com[,] do not\n&gt; say anything at all about a hypermedia requirement.\n\nXML.com published Joe Gregorio’s “Constructing or Traversing URIs?” \n(&lt;http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/04/06/restful.html&gt;).\n\n&gt; If people are\n&gt; implementing http-based web services that are like REST except for the\n&gt; hypermedia constraint:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.) Is it really a _requirement_, or is it just to incorporate hypermedia\n&gt; into the implementation?\n\nIs the use of hypermedia as the engine of application state a \nrequirement? Yes. Is it a requirement that every representation be \nhypermedia? No. A resource representation that is not hypermedia does \nnot offer state transitions. A resource representation that is not \nhypermedia is like a dead-end road. Dead-end roads are fine as part of a \nlarger system of linked roads and pathways.\n\n&gt; 2.) What happens when Real World implementations don&#39;t implement a\n&gt; requirement?\n\nThat which happens depends on the requirement and on the implementation \nchoices. If the requirement is sound, the violation of the requirement \nhas a negative effect.\n\n&gt; Is it possible that would call into question if it is a\n&gt; _requirement_ or just a recommendation?\n\nIt is not possible that a lack of implementation would call into \nquestion the status of a requirement. A lack of implementation would \ncall into question the merit of the requirement. A lack of \nimplementation would call into question the evangelical skill of people \nwho believe that the requirement has merit.\n\n&gt; 3.) Why is it a requirement? \n\nIf you’re asking about what Roy Fielding was thinking when he wrote his \ndissertation, I’ll leave the answering to him.\n\nIf you’re asking about the benefits of using hypermedia as the engine of \napplication state, I’ll give a thin answer: using hypermedia as the \nengine of application state induces desirable architectural properties. \nI hope that somebody will present a fuller answer, but I’ll work on a \nfuller answer if nobody presents one.\n\n&gt; Is it possible that in hindsight it isn&#39;t really a requirement?\n\nIt is not possible, with hindsight or without, that the constraint is \nnot a requirement. It is possible that hindsight question the merit of a \nthe requirement. It is possible that hindsight inform the development of \nnew requirements. It is possible that hindsight inform a choice to \nabandon an architectural style.\n\n&gt; 4.) If hypermedia is an [absolute] requirement, then [what] about all those\n&gt; http-based web services that don&#39;t incorporate hypermedia but that are doing\n&gt; real world legitimate work? Are they invalid?\n\nHTTP-based services that don’t incorporate hypermedia but that are doing \nreal-world, legitimate work do not conform to REST. I think that \nconforming to REST is not a requirement for validity (in the lay sense).\n\n&gt; 5.) And if everyone uses the term REST for something this group says in not\n&gt; REST, where does that leave us?\n\nI don’t know where common misuse of the term “REST” leaves us.\n\n&gt; * I believe a hypermedia requirement raises the bar with respect to the\n&gt; requirements to use.\n[...]\n&gt; * I believe [that,] in other contexts, the costs of hypermedia far\n&gt; [outweigh] its benefits, [...] too much must be learned and/or too\n&gt; much code must be written.\n\nIs there too much to learn or too much code to write in order to use \nHTML, Atom, XHTML, RDF/XML, N3, or SVG? I think that (to varying \ndegrees, respectively) these forms of hypermedia are known and that \nthere exist software libraries to manipulate hypermedia of these forms.\n\nWhat is an alternative to hypermedia?\n\n&gt; * URI Opacity - Is it okay to construct URI assuming the URI authority\n&gt; published specifications?\n\nConsider an agent constructing a URI.\n\nIf the agent is not a piece of software, then REST has no bearing. REST \nis an architectural style for software. If the agent is a person, then \nthe agent can construct any URI for any use without violating REST. For \nsome URIs, some uses are okay. As an example, I have just constructed \nthe URI &quot;http://example.net/explanation&quot; to use as an explanatory aid.\n\nIf the agent is a piece of software doing nothing more than hastening a \nperson’s construction of the URI, then the situation is tantamount to \nthe situation just described and REST has no bearing. As an example, I \nenter “rfc 3986” in my Web browser, the browser constructs the URI \n&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&quot;, and the browser sends a “GET” \nrequest with the constructed URI as the Request-URI.\n\nIf the agent is a piece of software doing something more than hastening \na person’s construction of the URI, then REST has a bearing.\n\nSuppose that the agent is a piece of software doing something more than \nhastening a person’s construction of the URI.\n\nIf the agent relies on hypermedia of a standard media type to provide \nrules for the construction, then the agent is within REST. As an \nexample, consider the following hypothetical transcript of HTTP exchanges.\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:31 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 154\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nGET /books HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:32 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 425\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Books&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot; action=&quot;status&quot;&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot;\nname=&quot;book&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&gt; Teach Yourself Representational\nState Transfer in an Hour&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot;\nname=&quot;book&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt; Web 3.14: A Fond History&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;\nvalue=&quot;Check status&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nGET /status?book=1 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:33 GMT\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 271\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Status of &quot;Teach Yourself\nRepresentational State Transfer in an Hour&quot;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 4 copies of &quot;Teach Yourself\nRepresentational State Transfer in an Hour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nImplicit in the transcript is the agent’s use of the HTML form. This use \nis both URI construction and using hypermedia as the engine of \napplication state.\n\nThe other construction, also obedient to the constraint of hypermedia as \nthe engine of application state, stems from the representation of \n&lt;http://example.org/&gt;. Yes, resolving a URI-reference against a base URI \nis URI construction.\n\nIf the agent is not an origin server and relies on anything other than \nhypermedia of a standard media type to provide rules for the \nconstruction, then the agent does not conform to REST. Examples include \nrelying on hypermedia of a nonstandard media type, relying on resource \nrepresentations that are not hypermedia, and relying on transition rules \nthe agent’s creator programmed into the agent’s code.\n\nIf the agent is an origin server, then the agent can construct any URI \nwithin the agent’s scope of authority and still conform to REST. As an \nexample, consider the following hypothetical transcript of HTTP exchanges.\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:31 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 155\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Web site&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;Alice&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nPUT /Alice HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 283\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head profile=\n&quot;http://www.w3.org/2006/03/hcard&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Alice&#39;s\nstuff&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;address class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn n&quot;&gt;Alice\nMcWebby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/address&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:32 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 283\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head profile=\n&quot;http://www.w3.org/2006/03/hcard&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Alice&#39;s\nstuff&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;address class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn n&quot;&gt;Alice\nMcWebby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/address&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:33 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 202\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Web site&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;Alice&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\n&quot;Alice/card&quot;&gt;business card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;html&gt;\n\nGET /Alice/card HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:12:34 GMT\nContent-Type: text/directory; profile=VCARD; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 77\n\nBEGIN:VCARD\nVERSION:3.0\nFN:Alice McWebby\nN:McWebby;Alice;;;\nEND:VCARD\n\nEntry into a system of hypermedia is outside the scope of REST. REST \ndoesn’t forbid any points of entry. REST doesn’t mandate any points of \nentry. REST doesn’t constrain whether or how people pass URIs for points \nof entry to other people or to software. REST doesn’t constrain whether \nor how software stores URIs for points of entry (bookmarks, history).\n\nNavigation within the system is what REST would constrain. Even at that, \nif a person discovers a URI during the course of navigation, the person \ncan enter the system anew using the discovered URI.\n\n-- \n\n\n"}}
