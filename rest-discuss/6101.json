Suppose my HTTP server is a robot, and I want to  \n&gt;&gt; tell it\n&gt;&gt; to ring the doorbell.  What verb would apply?\n&gt;\n&gt; POST, though I question whether this really falls within the HTTP  \n&gt; model,\n&gt; which focuses more on what representations the server returns than on\n&gt; any side effect on the server. If by &quot;ring the bell&quot; you mean return a\n&gt; representation of the bell as an MP3, then it would be GET.\n&gt;\nThe way I&#39;ve come to think of this is that resources are things, just  \nas objects (in an object-oriented program) are things. The verbs you  \ncan do on resources over HTTP are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The  \nway you call arbitrary &quot;methods&quot; on a resource is by POSTing to it,  \nand including in the post data information about what to do. For  \nexample, you could have a URI representing your robot resource. Doing  \na GET of that URI could return some robot status information. You  \ncould POST to the robot URI and include in the post data a key  \n&quot;command&quot; with the value &quot;ringDoorbell.&quot; That is analogous to  \ninvoking ringDoorbell() on a Robot object, in an object-oriented  \nprogram or distributed RPC system. A robot resource could expose any  \nnumber of &quot;methods&quot; this way to HTTP clients.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
