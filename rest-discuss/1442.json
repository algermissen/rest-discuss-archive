In\n&gt; other words, you don&#39;t need to rewrite an application, you can \n&gt; simply choose to expose something later or hide something\n&gt; as your needs change or the needs of you partners change.\n\nWow!  This is a really interesting idea.  Let me see if I understand\nyour idea.  I work best with a concrete example, so let&#39;s consider the\nfictitious company, Parts Depot, Inc. One of the services it has\ndeployed is a service to enable clients to get detailed info about a\nspecific part.  For example, if the client is interested in part 00345\nthis is the URI that it would use:\n\n     http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345\n\nHere&#39;s a representation for that Part 00345 resource:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Part xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot;   \n        xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part-ID&gt;00345&lt;/Part-ID&gt;\n      &lt;Name&gt;Widget-A&lt;/Name&gt;\n      &lt;Description&gt;\n         This part is used within the frap assembly\n      &lt;/Description&gt;\n      &lt;Specification\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;UnitCost currency=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;0.10&lt;/UnitCost&gt;\n      &lt;Quantity&gt;0&lt;/Quantity&gt;\n&lt;/p:Part&gt;\n\nAs you can see, at the moment Parts Depot is out of Part 00345 [Note\nthat &lt;Quantity&gt; is 0].\n\nIn those cases where a part is out of stock Parts Depot may wish to\nadditionally provide a URL to a shipping schedule of that part as a\ncourtesy to its clients.  For example, rather than sending the above\ndocument, this one is sent:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Part xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot;   \n        xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part-ID&gt;00345&lt;/Part-ID&gt;\n      &lt;Name&gt;Widget-A&lt;/Name&gt;\n      &lt;Description&gt;\n         This part is used within the frap assembly\n      &lt;/Description&gt;\n      &lt;Specification\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;UnitCost currency=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;0.10&lt;/UnitCost&gt;\n      &lt;Quantity&gt;0&lt;/Quantity&gt;\n      &lt;ShippingSchedule\nhref=&quot;http://www.parts-depot/parts/00345/shipping-schedule&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/p:Part&gt;\n\nNote the new element, &lt;ShippingSchedule href=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;\n\nThus, the shipping-schedule resource is exposed when the &lt;Quantity&gt; is\n0, and hidden otherwise.\n\nIs this the kind of scenario that you are envisioning?  If so, I have\nsome questions:\n\n1. In actuality, wouldn&#39;t Parts Depot need to deploy the\nshipping-schedule resource at design time?  Isn&#39;t the only run-time\naspect of this scenario the decision of whether or not the URL to the\nshipping-schedule resource is to be provided within the Part document?\n\n2. If the answer to (1) is &quot;yes&quot;, then couldn&#39;t this also be done using\nSOAP?\n\nInteresting idea!  I look forward to your thoughts (to everyone&#39;s\nthoughts)!  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
