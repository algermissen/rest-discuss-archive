Does anyone have experience with integrating \n&gt; Chiba?  (One of the chiba authors suggested the 1060 folks had done \n&gt; this, which is why I&#39;m posting to this list.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -bryan\n\nThe latest version of Chiba XForms we integrated was 0.9.5. This is\navailable in the latest NetKernel Standard Edition download. \n\nThe basics of what we did was to abstract three things away from the\nChiba engine:\n1) servlet dependence\n2) XSLT stylesheet (xforms xml -&gt; HTML ) dependence\n3) session state\nWe did this so that the XForms engine became stateless and more\nflexible.\n\nI know that we had to make some patches to the source to acheive what\nwe needed. It wasn&#39;t me that did the work but I can pass on the\ndetails of a collegue that did if you want to discuss.\n\nTony Butterfield\nwww.1060.org\n\n\n"}}
