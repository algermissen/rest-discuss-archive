I&#39;m not sure where I was coming from, put it down to a \nlong tiring week.\n\nWhen I was talking about &quot;safe&quot; operations, I was talking about POST(p) \nbeing safe in the way that it gives the Web application control over \nwhat a particular POST request means to it and how to alter its \nresources in response, not that it is safe as described in RFC2616 (an \nunfortunate use of the word &quot;safe&quot; on my part).\n\nOf course, PUT and DELETE also give a Web application the same control, \nthe method is just applying semantics to the request, not forcing an \nexpected behaviour (ie. that a new representation given in a PUT must be \nblindly accepted).\n\nSo that also kind of ruins my argument for not supporting other HTTP \nmethods in HTML forms, so does anyone know why they were originally left \nout?\n\r\n\n"}}
