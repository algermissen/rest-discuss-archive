Wow.&quot; because that is the personal \n&gt; reaction you can see when &#39;the light switches on&#39; and the \n&gt; worldview shifts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The technical value\n&gt; &gt; needs to be squarely protected from vendors, analysts marketing \n&gt; &gt; departments and on-the-wagon rpc coders.\n&gt; \n&gt; *sigh* methinks that&#39;ll happen whatever we do!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve set my bozo bit for WS and SOA types who are repositioning \n&gt; &gt; themselves as REST stalwarts. Spotting a bandwagons is not an \n&gt; &gt; indicator of competence.\n&gt; \n&gt; /me nods\n&gt; \n&gt; But, at the same time, let&#39;s not let the door slam shut in \n&gt; the face of those, like Tim, who are really getting onboard \n&gt; with the style.\n\n+1\n\nThis is somewhat what I brought up last October, but if REST is not to be\nmisintrepretted I think it&#39;s going to take a group of &#39;RESTafarians&#39; to get\ntogether, discuss, agree, and publish detailed documention as to what is\ngood REST and what it is not.  Certainly Roy&#39;s thesis is the final word on\nREST but it is not approachable for most, and it is definitely not a REST\ncookbook that explains how to handle various use-cases.  Further, I believe\na cookbook is what ~99% of people need to successfully implement an\narchitecture style (and I am one of these 99%.)   But the cookbook would\nneed to be authoritative.\n\nEither the core REST community is going to come together with Roy&#39;s\nblessing, to shepherd the market maturation and to define an authoritative\ninterpretation of the REST architecture style of common use cases, or it\nwill all devolve into chaos and the term REST will be much sullied.  This\ncould take many forms, but one form could be providing proper guidance for\nand control of the &quot;REST&quot; (or someother associated) brand.\n\nI view what I&#39;m suggesting as being analogous to when the web was at a\ncrossroads back in the early 90s and TimBL had the foresight to form the\nW3C, an organization designed to shepherd the market maturation of the web\nand define protocols and provide guidance to ensure the web&#39;s\ninteroperability and scalability.  I&#39;m not suggesting a parallel\norganization; this hypothetical group could be associated with or eventually\neven under the W3C, whatever works.  But if ensuring that the industry\nimplements REST sarchitecture according to the Roy&#39;s principles is\nimportant, as I think most of us here agree it is, then such as an effort is\nimperative.\n\nWho wants to do this? I raise my hand and I pretty sure from private\nconversation that Alan Dean does too...\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
