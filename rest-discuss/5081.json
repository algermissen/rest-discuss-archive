Or at least\nsomething a lot like transactions.\n\nIf=\r\n you abstract the idea or pattern of a transaction protocol away\nfrom the d=\r\netails of database implementations, they get easier.  In\nparticular, 2-phas=\r\ne outcomes no longer require holding locks for the\nduration of the &quot;transac=\r\ntion&quot;.  Nor does the server need to keep track\nof the state of the transact=\r\nion.\n\nFor example, see \nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9=\r\n836/business_transaction-btp-1.1-spec-wd-04.pdf\n\nOne way to deal with trans=\r\nactions RESTfully is to PUT or POST the\nfirst phase result in a provisional=\r\n state, and the second phase final.\n In other words, the resource state is =\r\nthe transaction state.\n\nFor a business example, a quote is a provisional st=\r\nate, an order is final.\n\nAnother aspect of transactions from a RESTful poin=\r\nt of view is that\nthe actual transaction protocol involves only two compone=\r\nnts at a\ntime, one client which acts as the transaction coordinator, and on=\r\ne\nserver which acts as the transaction participant or resource manager.\n\nTh=\r\ne client may also coordinate other participants in the same logical\ntransac=\r\ntion, but only needs to interact with one at a time, and none\nof the resour=\r\nces need to interact with or know about each other.  All\ndistributed state =\r\nmanagement can be done by the client/coordinator.\n\nI don&#39;t know if a transa=\r\nction tree would be RESTful - where a\nserver/resource manager/participant i=\r\ns also a sub-coordinator. But in\nfact that is what happens when Amazon auth=\r\norizes your credit with\nVisa.  In this case, the credit authorization is th=\r\ne provisional\nstate, and the drawdown is the final state.\n\nYou could also u=\r\nse compensations, where the provisional state is the\nsame as the final stat=\r\ne, and you undo the action if the transaction\naborts, but compensation ofte=\r\nn doesn&#39;t work.\n\nSee also http://www.choreology.com/standards/standards_btm=\r\n_spectrum.htm\n- it&#39;s written in terms of Web service transactions, but the\n=\r\nprovisional-final and do-compensate patterns will work for REST, too.\n\n\n\n"}}
