Users must (and mostly do, I think) understand the implications\n&gt;  of shoulder surfing.\n\nUh, I understand the general point of what you&#39;re saying, but, umm, if\nyou sat next to me and I put my creditcard into the URL, would you be\nable to remember it? It&#39;s a long number. :) I guess one can say this\nis security by obscurity, as someone might use their cameraphone and\nsnap a picture.\n\n&gt;  They already understand them with ATMs.\n\nWell, actually they don&#39;t as you don&#39;t put in your credit-card number\nin those machines. I&#39;m even inclined to say that you could read your\nnumber out loud to someone slowly, and they still wouldn&#39;t remember\nit.\n\nBut back to the point, and here&#39;s what I would do to hide the\ncard-number in following transactions ;\n\n   GET https://bank.com/card/1234567890\n\ndoes a 30x redirect to ;\n\n   https://bank.com/statement/$1234\n\nwhich is a hashed version of whatever the card &quot;1234567890&quot; is linked\nto (which could be a session indicator, a bank account, etc. depending\non how your internal system is designed).\n\nIf POSTing secret form data is the issue (as someone has pointed out),\nI would connect the form to a hash of a login session, and pass the\nhash in. So ;\n\n   GET http://bank.com/login (returns form, with action to the URL below)\n\n&lt;form action=&quot;https://bank.com/session&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n   Create a session&lt;br /&gt;\n   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;input type=&quot;secret&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n   POST https://bank.com/session (create session: returns 30x +\nsession hash $1234)\n\nnow you can use the hash to ;\n\n   GET https://bank.com/statement/$1234\n\nuntil ;\n\n   DELETE https://bank.com/session/$1234 (or passed through by some form)\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchymist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
