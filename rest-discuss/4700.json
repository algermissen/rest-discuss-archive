The problem is that each call to GET\ncould potentially return a new message.  The GET has\nside-effects, and is therefor not RESTful.\n\nI was wondering if the inclusion of an acknowledgement\nheader, an &quot;ack&quot;, would allow side effects in this way.\n\nNote: Mod-pubsub does a similar thing, but they never\nreturn from the GET and it seems to me that there is no\nway for them to ensure delivery.   With mod-pubsub,\ncontext can be lost and not recovered.  With some for\nof acknowledgement, the ActiveMQ approach could be more\nrobust in that regard.\n\nIf the &quot;ack&quot; were somehow unacceptable, each GET could be\nfollowed by a DELETE which would accomplish the same thing,\nbut having an &quot;ack&quot; header would require fewer requests\nobviously.\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Vincent D Murphy&quot; &lt;vdm@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jeffrey Winter&quot; &lt;JeffreyWinter@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 15, 2004 3:47 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] RESTful Queues\n\n\n: Jeffrey Winter wrote:\n: &gt; I&#39;m wondering if it would be okay to use\n: &gt; a extension header to indicate acknowledgement\n: &gt; of receipt of a resource in order to trigger new\n: &gt; state.\n: &gt; [..]\n: &gt; Does this violate idempotency in anyway that\n: &gt; anyone can see?\n:\n: I don&#39;t think you would need to do this if your transfer\n: protocol was reliable.\n:\n: http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html\n: \n\n\n\n"}}
