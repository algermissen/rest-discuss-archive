In any other\n&gt; circumstances you must limit the communication to\n&gt; GET/POST(p).\n\nI came to a similar conclusion a while back but I have since changed\nmy mind. I do not believe that is the case although it might seem like\nit is given the current state of the web infrastructure built around\nREST.\n\n&gt; PUT is analogous to a write of the entity body to the\n&gt; resource URI. A high level of trust is required that the\n&gt; user agent will not unintentionally or maliciously\n&gt; corrupt the resource that is being replaced. The resource\n&gt; cannot be amended or extended by a PUT, it must be replaced.\n&gt; This places a greater burden on the user agent to understand\n&gt; the internal state of the resource and to maintain its\n&gt; consistency within itself and in relation to the resources\n&gt; that surround it.\n\nThe client deals with a representation and not a resource and it has\nto know nothing about a resource other than what the representation\nconveys.\n\nI&#39;ll have to leave it at that for now as I&#39;m in a hurry. Will get back\nto you tomorrow...\n\nSandeep Shetty\n\n"}}
