In theory, it may be\nuseful to return a 302 response back to this primary URI; in practice,\nit&#39;s certainly not worth the extra round trip, so probably fine to\njust return the same representations on a 200 until new parameters\nare supported.\n\nIf you expect your primary key may change, then a 404 approach\nprobably makes good sense.\n\nThat&#39;s just my first thoughts on the subject.  It&#39;s a pretty\ninteresting question though; a real mental-model stress test.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
