The application itself is\n&gt; formed when the components (user agent, servers, intermediaries) start\n&gt; working together. IOW, the media type is not for *this* application\n&gt; but for the domain (even if that is a rather loose term :-). Take\n&gt; AtomPub or HTML as examples: when these are specified the stuff that\n&gt; will later on be done with them (the applications) is not known. HTML\n&gt; can be used for displaying a Web page in a browser or for crawling and\n&gt; indexing a site. Both are applications and they *use* HTML is not made\n&gt; *for* them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Should such mime type become a standard?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. It must be. However, &#39;standard&#39; in this sense means more\n&gt; &#39;application independent&#39; than &#39;IETF or W3C standard&#39;. It is ok if the\n&gt; media type is only standard in you organisation. Important is that it\n&gt; is not defined by the service under development.\n\nWhy is that important?\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seem a little too complex...\n&gt; \n&gt; Why does this seem complex?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there some example of such a process worked?\n&gt; \n&gt; HTML\n&gt; AtomPub\n&gt; OpenSearch\n&gt; NewsML (to some extend)\n\n\nWhich result in semantic tunnelling. Look at the work involved in\nmapping gdata/activitystreams/odata into Atom or microformats/rdfa into\nHTML. Those are global/community efforts that dwarf the caabilities of a\ntime-constrained business that needs to solve its problem rather than\nits industry&#39;s problem. \n\nWhat would be &#39;wrong&#39; with with having a link to WADL in your media\ntype? Until such a time as the RDF singularity that is, although frankly\nTDF looks more and more like a better option than blocking the\n&#39;applications&#39; and the &#39;service under development&#39; on some non-existent\n&#39;standard&#39;.\n\nBill\n\n\n"}}
