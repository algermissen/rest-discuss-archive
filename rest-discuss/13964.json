Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; I understand exactly what you&#39;re after. =A0The problem here is that y=\r\nour\n&gt; proposed solution may be perfectly valid HTTP, but it isn&#39;t REST.\n\nTh=\r\nat&#39;s an interesting point. I&#39;m mostly concerned with not totally\nabusing th=\r\ne HTTP spec and implementing something really non-standard\nthat no general-=\r\npurpose client understands. Technically a &quot;naive&quot;\nclient that had no idea o=\r\nf how the if-last-modified header was\nemployed (and thus didn&#39;t use it) wou=\r\nld just get the resource in it&#39;s\nentirety. But I guess that isn&#39;t strictly =\r\nrestful and perhaps a bad\nidea in general because a naive client that did s=\r\nubmit an\nif-modified-since header might not understand what to do with the\n=\r\nresponse body.\n\nI guess I will just stick to sending the entire resource if=\r\n it has\nchanged and not deal with partial resources and merging as all of t=\r\nhe\nother options seem overkill for this application. Your ideas on XSLT\npat=\r\nching is pretty neat though.\n\n-mike\n\n-- \n________________________________\nM=\r\nichael E.
