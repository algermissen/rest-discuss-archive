To simplify\n&gt; the case I will assume I have one-click purchasing turned on. What\n&gt; happens then is that with a single POST of x-www-form-urlencoded\n&gt; data I can purchase a book. (In the process at least two new URIs\n&gt; are created, one to reflect my purchase and another to track\n&gt; the shipment.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Were I to POST that same x-www-form-urlencoded data to a different \n&gt; server (google, ebay, etc) I probably wouldn&#39;t purchase a book. \n&gt; Does that imply that to be perfectly RESTful we should have a new\n&gt; method, &quot;PURCHASE_BOOK&quot;, that carries the sematics of book purchasing\n&gt; in a uniform manner?\n\nNo.  The difference here, I believe, is between the following two\napplication semantics;\n\n  &quot;Purchase a book&quot;\n\n  &quot;Process this document as if you were a book order processor&quot;\n\nThe former, as you note, would map to HTTP with a new method (but that\nwouldn&#39;t be RESTful since it isn&#39;t uniform, though it would be more\nself-descriptive).  The latter would map to HTTP POST with a header\n(mandatory, due to deployment issues) declaring that the expected\nrole/type of the resource identified by the Request-URI, is that of a\nbook order processor.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
