I&#39;d be happy to hear why I&#39;m wrong if I am.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That was my position in the argument with Mark Baker that I lost.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I say &quot;I lost&quot;, I decided I agreed with Mark that to be stateless\n&gt;&gt; and self-describing, the message to the server *did* need to include\n&gt;&gt; all the detail of the cart contents, payment method, etc. etc. etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; My line of thought, too. Until this thread:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18998\n&gt;\n&gt; Since then I try to follow Roy&#39;s advice.\n\nYah, I never did follow up to that. I had to take time to think about\nit, then forgot to respond.\n\nI concluded that I disagreed with Roy about the lack of visibility in\na POST message. Certainly POST semantics are entirely opaque beyond\nthe oft-discussed-here &quot;process this&quot; practically-transport semantic,\nbut that doesn&#39;t impact the meaning of the rest of the message for\nmany purposes, e.g. archival (consider the previously discussed\nHTML/CSS in a POST request rather than a GET response). On the other\nhand, I agree that most of the interesting and important properties to\nconcern one&#39;s self with are those that derive from - as Roy says -\n&quot;representation by reference&quot;, though AFAICT, that is synonymous with\n&quot;stateful&quot;.\n\nP.S. yes Bob, I agree that exchange is stateless.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
