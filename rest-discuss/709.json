I&#39;ll clarify that.\n\n&gt; &gt; But, more\n&gt; &gt; important, they can apply to an infinite number of logical entities\n&gt; &gt; called &quot;Resources&quot;. URIs are just their addresses.\n&gt; [mike] it&#39;d be neat to have a &#39;sidebar&#39; talking about &#39;names .vs. addresses&#39;\n\nMight be a distraction.\n\n&gt; &gt; Some REST advocates\n&gt; &gt; call the process of bringing your applications into this model Resource\n&gt; &gt; Modeling. This process is not yet as formal as object oriented modeling\n&gt; &gt; or entity-relation modeling but it is related to those. The strength and\n&gt; &gt; flexibility of REST comes from the creative use of URIs.\n&gt; [mike] &#39;creative&#39; implies un-designed, how about &#39;consistent&#39; or &#39;strong&#39; or\n&gt; &#39;intelligent&#39; or something positive.\n\n&quot;pervasive&quot;\n\n&gt; &gt; HTTP&#39;s extensibility stems primarily from the ability to distribute any\n&gt; &gt; payload with predefined or new headers using predefined or (on occasion)\n&gt; &gt; new methods. What makes HTTP really special among all protocols,\n&gt; &gt; however, is its implicit understanding of URIs and resources.\n&gt; [mike] is it &#39;implicit understanding&#39; or &#39;central focus&#39;/whatever?\n\n&quot;built-in support for&quot;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; later merely by manipulating the ACLs. Another model for security is\n&gt; &gt; called capabilities. This less popular model is more flexible than ACLs\n&gt; [mike] popular -&gt; prevalent (it isn&#39;t as widely known, so &#39;popularity&#39; isn&#39;t\n&gt; quite correct - KragenS might be able to provide more detail on how it ties\n&gt; in with ReST)\n\nOkay, prevalent.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Of course HTTP-based Web Services can go through firewalls easily. But\n&gt; &gt; that is the only point of similarity with RPC tunnels through HTTP such\n&gt; [mike] &#39;rpc tunnels through http&#39; -&gt; &#39;rpc tunneling through http&#39; (&#39;tunnel&#39;\n&gt; is both verb and noun, would be nice to clarify)\n\nOkay.\n\n&gt; &gt; as XML-RPC or SOAP-RPC over HTTP. When you use HTTP over a firewall, you\n&gt; &gt; are being very explicit about what is going on. Your system\n&gt; &gt; administrator can look at her logs to determine what services are\n&gt; [mike] &#39;her&#39; -&gt; &#39;the&#39; (overly p.c. is distracting for me...)\n\nThis isn&#39;t the only reference to &quot;her&quot;. Eventually I&#39;ll need to use a\npronoun. Shame about the English language. ;) The truly PC use &quot;hir&quot;.\nWhich is more distracting: &quot;She&quot; or &quot;(S)he&quot;? Yes, I know they are both\ndistracting...which is MORE.\n\nhttp://www.vexen.co.uk/words.html#HIR\n\n&gt; &gt; delete_* and save_*. This pattern is ubiquitous.\n&gt; [mike] &#39;this pattern is ...&#39; -&gt; &#39;this pattern of a small number of methods\n&gt; on a large amount of data is ...&#39; (can&#39;t hurt to re-iterate the point of\n&gt; rest)\n\nOkay.\n\n&gt; &gt; know when they will get a request from a client.\n&gt; [mike] &#39;get&#39; -&gt; &#39;receive&#39; (get might imply proactive processing or polling)\n\nOkay. \n\n&gt; &gt; Writing reliable-delivery software with HTTP is relatively easy. Thanks\n&gt; &gt; to the guarantees of TCP, you can always know for sure if you received\n&gt; &gt; an appropriate response. If you did not, then in many cases it is safe\n&gt; &gt; to repeat the message send, due to the principle of idempotency.\n&gt; [mike] another sidebar with concrete examples and &#39;idempotency&#39; would be\n&gt; good here...\n\nI will provide a URI.\n\n&gt; &gt; not an issue then you should certainly use the simpler approach.\n&gt; [mike] &#39;use&#39; -&gt; &#39;consider&#39; (don&#39;t recommend an approach that is short term\n&gt; and non-interoperable)\n\nIf that&#39;s what you need....sometimes I use XML, but others Word.\nSometimes REST but other times RPC.\n\n&gt; &gt; HTTP is also not appropriate in some circumstances. Because HTTP runs on\n&gt; &gt; top of TCP, it can have high latency.\n&gt; [mike] &#39;high&#39; is relative, give some concrete numbers so people don&#39;t make\n&gt; decisions based on the wrong assumptions\n\nOkay, I&#39;ll try to be more explicit.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
