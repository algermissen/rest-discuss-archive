Among \n&gt; &gt; other things, it has to maintain a list of read messages which it \n&gt; &gt; does, as is common, with a newsrc file. A run list is \n&gt; maintained for \n&gt; &gt; each newsgroup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Resources are pretty obvious... user, newsgroup, article. \n&gt; We can do a \n&gt; &gt; PUT to the article(to which each user gets his &quot;own&quot; URL) modifying \n&gt; &gt; the flag that indicates whether it&#39;s been read, and the app \n&gt; can update \n&gt; &gt; the newsrc accordingly, and life is good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At least, as long as we want to mark just one article at a \n&gt; time. Dumb \n&gt; &gt; browser can&#39;t be told &quot;fire off five PUT requests to mark \n&gt; this group \n&gt; &gt; of five articles,&quot; and we sure as heck don&#39;t want the user to click \n&gt; &gt; five &quot;mark as read&quot; buttons, with dumb browser repainting the whole \n&gt; &gt; page in between. Even smart applications reeeeally don&#39;t \n&gt; want to send \n&gt; &gt; a thousand or so PUT requests when the user says &quot;catch up&quot; \n&gt; on a new \n&gt; &gt; newsgroup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So if we make the newsrc a resource, we can spoon-feed dumb \n&gt; browser a \n&gt; &gt; form at the bottom of the page we server, that includes the \n&gt; newsrc as \n&gt; &gt; it would look like with the five articles marked read, and \n&gt; if the user \n&gt; &gt; wants to mark them read, dumb browser can PUT the \n&gt; preconstructed form \n&gt; &gt; to the newsrc, and the server&#39;s RESTfully happy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But suppose Joe User&#39;s been paging through the \n&gt; &gt; articles. He&#39;s got a page with articles 1-5, a page with \n&gt; 6-10, a page \n&gt; &gt; with 11-15. And then he decides to mark them read. Dumb \n&gt; browser sends \n&gt; &gt; (PUTs, or at least POST-overloadeds) the page 3 newsrc run list:\n&gt; &gt; 11-15. Server&#39;s happy. Joe pages back to the second page, and marks \n&gt; &gt; those read. Dumb browser says &quot;PUT that newsrc to &#39;6-10&#39;&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, we don&#39;t want to serve Joe a 409 Conflict, and we \n&gt; don&#39;t want to \n&gt; &gt; unmark articles 11-15, and we don&#39;t want to make it \n&gt; impossible for a \n&gt; &gt; smarter application to say &quot;mark 6-10 read, unmark 11-15&quot; \n&gt; all at once \n&gt; &gt; on purpose. It&#39;s not too difficult to cater to dumb browser and put \n&gt; &gt; something in the form that determines whether to union, \n&gt; xor, diff, or \n&gt; &gt; intersect the PUT run list with the server&#39;s existing run list, but \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s an approach that eliminates the problem \n&gt; &gt; altogether.\n&gt; Something like this was discussed a few weeks ago .  If I \n&gt; recall correctly, the consensus was that PUT did not have to \n&gt; contain the entire resource representation, but could just \n&gt; contain affected items.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, if PUT contained an XML document (or equivalent \n&gt; thereof) that looks as follows:\n&gt; &lt;status&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;item id=&quot;10&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;item id=&quot;11&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;item id=&quot;12&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;item id=&quot;13&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \t&lt;item id=&quot;14&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/status&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The server could apply the changes to only the supplied \n&gt; items.  That is, item 1-9 and 15+ would remain unaffected.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Steve G.
