I am assumi=\r\nng yes, but I want to make sure.\n\nMost trivial examples show (for example) =\r\nthe sending of an order&#39;s \nrepresentation when the order is being updated. =\r\n But what if the user \nneeds to send credentials so that the server can val=\r\nidate before \nactually updating the order?  How does this information get s=\r\nent?\n\nIn other cases, &quot;processing instructions&quot; need to be provided so that=\r\n \nthe system knows exactly what to do the resource being manipulated - \nthe=\r\nse processing instructions are not really part of the resource.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
