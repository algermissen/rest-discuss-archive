The idea of the service -- a generic\n4k/4k-byte/item queue -- is pretty sweet: simple, powerful and generic.\n\nBut the &quot;REST&quot; API leaves something to be desired.  It seems like all\noperations -- mutation as well as retreival are done via GET, with the\nmagic &quot;Operation={whatever}&quot; ... let alone REST &quot;Level 1&quot; , this doesn&#39;t\neven make a &quot;get/post&quot; distinction!\n\nQueues are identified by parameter name rather than as a resource...\n\nI haven&#39;t played with it, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the\nresponses always come back 200, with the actual error code in the\nresponse body.\n\nThere&#39;s no /hypermedia as engine of application state/ involved, unless\nyou count the API docs as such. :(\n\nSo, we have a major vendor promoting a REST interface [yay!] that shares\nZERO components with the architectural style of the same name, nor any\nfurther conceptualization of it people on this list seem to have [boo!].\n\n...jsled\n\n\n[1]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/sdk/102-1177876-7264137?s=AWSSimpleQueueService&v=1%2d0\n[2]: http://asynchronous.org/blog/archives/2004/08/25/levels_of_rest.html\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
