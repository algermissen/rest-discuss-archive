I think I&#39;d like\n&gt; to use URLs as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;   htt=\r\np://example.com/docs/doc\n&gt;\n&gt; for &quot;the resource&quot;; and atom, csv, rdf, zip:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;   http://example.com/docs/doc/atom\n&gt;   http://example.com/docs/doc/csv\n&gt;=\r\n   http://example.com/docs/doc/rdf\n&gt;\n&gt; appended for &quot;formats&quot;. Probably I&#39;l=\r\nl use rel tags/URI templates and a\n&gt; howto page to document that you can ge=\r\nt at representations in multiple\n&gt; forms.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know there&#39;s conneg at the =\r\nHTTP level, but it seems to have miserably,\n&gt; utterly, and completely faile=\r\nd* on the web.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n\nA lot of the time when people publish human a=\r\nnd machine-readable  \nformats, conneg doesn&#39;t seem appropriate, because the=\r\n formats are  \nreally not substitutable for each other.  Eg, imagine the su=\r\nrprise  \nthat someone gets when they try to run XSLT over an XML representa=\r\ntion  \nbut get a zip file because their XSLT processor isn&#39;t setting the  \n=\r\nAccept headers in exactly the way that the server expects.\n\nI think that us=\r\ning multiple URLs is a good thing in that sort of  \nscenario, but a weaknes=\r\ns is that they become more difficult to manage.  \n  Agents and languages li=\r\nke RDF can&#39;t easily tell whether two formats  \nrefer to the same concept.\n\n=\r\nA compromise is to additionally provide a URL for the concept, eg:  \n&quot;http:=\r\n//example.com/docs/doc&quot;, that 303-redirects to an appropriate  \nrepresentat=\r\nion, which also has the advantage of being compatible with  \nthe httpRange-=\r\n14 resolution. [1]\n\nUsing the Link header [2] to point from the information=\r\n resource (the  \nfile), to the non-information resource (the concept), seem=\r\ns like a  \ngood idea, but I&#39;m not sure whether any of the predefined rel va=\r\nlues  \nare appropriate.\n\nHow about\n\nLink: &lt;http://example.com/docs/doc&gt;; re=\r\nv=3Dalternate\n\n(notice the rev instead of rel)\n\n\n[1] http://lists.w3.org/Ar=\r\nchives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html\n[2] http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rf=\r\nc2068.html#sec-19.6.2.4\n\n-- \nDave\n\n\n\n"}}
