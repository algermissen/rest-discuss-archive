One main difference is \n&gt; that in REST &#39;dead&#39; \n&gt; representations of objects are passed around, and in COM et \n&gt; al. live objects are passed around.\nIsn&#39;t &#39;passing&#39; and being &#39;alive&#39; sort of mutually exclusive? I mean, when a\nperson has died, people say that they have &#39;passed&#39;. I think it&#39;s the same\nfor objects. If an object has passed, you can pretty much assume it&#39;s dead.\n\nOkay, that was a weak attempt at humor. \nTo appreciate any new dramatically different approach you have to avoid\ndirect comparison to previous approaches - REST is like that. Viewing things\nas objects tends to obscure other aspects of REST (and HTTP) so that the two\nare comparable. They really aren&#39;t evenly comparable - they are different\narchitectural styles.\n\n\n"}}
