However, I feel that the caching limitation only applies \n&gt; to\n&gt; intermediaries.  Otherwise, the verb would be practically useless.  You\n&gt; could certainly use a 303 as well, but the only advantage I see to \n&gt; that is\n&gt; allowing intermediaries to cache the response.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey, Roy:  if you happen to read this, what is your take on this?  Is\n&gt; OPTIONS supposed to be non-cachable for everyone or just \n&gt; intermediaries?\n\nIt is only non-cacheable by default.  Use cache-control to change that.\n\nThe Web had a notion of external links, but nobody could agree on the\nHTTP syntax so it didn&#39;t make the cut.  WebDAV added properties.\n\nAdding a new header field to every GET response would increase latency\nfor no benefit to the common case and only marginal benefit to the\napplications being discussed.  It is therefore more efficient to have\nthe client request that information only when it is desired.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
