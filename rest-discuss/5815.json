But I really want to\n&gt;&gt; require a second password for administration for the same reason that\n&gt;&gt; UNIX administrators have a separate password for root.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s not a good analogy. Unix needs su because it doesn&#39;t have a\n&gt; good acl implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; And even with unix, sudo is now so popular because it solves some of\n&gt; the problems of su.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; want one root password for the whole network. Each user that is given\n&gt;&gt; admin privileges would chose their own admin password, which they\n&gt;&gt; would need to supply after having already logged in with their\n&gt;&gt; regular password to escalate their authentication to admin. (And each\n&gt;&gt; user would get certain specific admin roles by escalating their  \n&gt;&gt; auth.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds way too complicated to me. But it&#39;s your app and this is really\n&gt; OT.\n&gt;\nUnfortunately I think it is on topic if HTTP versus cookie auth is on  \ntopic. Because doing something like this is I think kind of forced by  \nusing cookie auth. If you go to Yahoo mail right now, they ask you to  \nlog in with a user name and password. They submit your auth data over  \nHTTPS, give you back an auth cookie, and redirect you to your mail  \nhome page over HTTP. If you then click on My Settings at the top of  \nthat page, they ask you for your password again, even though you just  \nsupplied it about 30 seconds earlier.\n\nI suspect they are forcing you to reenter your password because the  \ncookie auth token can be easily hijacked. If they didn&#39;t do that, I  \ncould take my screwdriver and install a listener outside of  \nYahoo.com, wait for auth tokens to come by, then use each one to do a  \nGET of the user&#39;s settings data. I could just sit there and collect  \nprivate user data all day long, and Yahoo could be liable for the  \nbreach of privacy. If Yahoo were to use HTTP digest auth instead of  \ncookies, then this kind of attack wouldn&#39;t be possible (as far as I  \nunderstand it).\n\nIn my admin example I feel forced by the cookie hijacking security  \nhole to reauthenticate users when they go to administer, as well as  \nwhen they go look at or edit their private data. You&#39;re right that it  \nmay be paranoid overkill to ask my users to remember an admin  \npassword for administration tasks separate from their normal  \npassword, but even if I were to drop that, I would still feel forced  \nby the hijack problem to ask them for their normal password again  \njust before letting them administer, and doing all the administration  \nover HTTPS so the stronger authentication can&#39;t be hijacked.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
