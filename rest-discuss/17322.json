At least in business scenarios:\n\n1. Think abo=\r\nut changing your application protocol due to business changes. Can a client=\r\n be generic enough to compensate this? The link rel semantics of &quot;next&quot; are=\r\n very clear. But what if i need a relation type, which is not yet described=\r\n? Which is too domain specific.\n\n2. What about the cross-cutting concerns l=\r\nike security? If i switch from HTTP Basic auth to OAuth, can a generic clie=\r\nnt adapt to this situation automatically? \n\n3. What if i have to evolve a m=\r\nedia type, which i=B4m using, and i need a new one? (for example by adding =\r\nnew link relations or data fields)\n\nIn my opinion, i don=B4t see a business=\r\n value in supporting 100% REST style. It might work with &quot;simple&quot; applicati=\r\non protocols like ATOM (which is very nice, but also very generic).\n\nMaybe =\r\nsomeone can enlighten me...\n\n[1] http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_ht=\r\ntp_based_apis.html\n\n\n"}}
