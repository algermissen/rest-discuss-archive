Specifically, I&#39;m working in a standards body (the Zig=\r\nBee Alliance) that has classically used a binary protocol that does not rea=\r\nlly adhere to any true architectural design (IMHO).  I&#39;ve been engaged in w=\r\nork that started in ZigBee and has now moved to IEEE (2030.5) that (attempt=\r\ns to) rigidly stick to a RESTful HTTP design.  One request that has come up=\r\n is to port toggle switch capability to this standard.  Home automation man=\r\nufacturers have actually implemented toggle switches this way in the past (=\r\nsee http://zigbee.org/Products/ByStandard/ZigBeeHomeAutomation.aspx).\n\nSo, =\r\nin short, I myself am not manufacturing a specific toggle switch, but rathe=\r\nr have been working in a standards body where others have requested the inc=\r\nlusion of toggle switch functionality.  We also have some use cases for a s=\r\nimple button press, which I see as a similar problem.\n\nThanks,\nRobby\n\nFrom:=\r\n &quot;Nick Gall nick.gall@...&lt;mailto:nick.gall@...&gt; [rest-discuss]&quot;=\r\n &lt;rest-discuss-noreply@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss-noreply@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt;&gt;\nReply-To: Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&lt;mailto:nick.gall@gmail.c=\r\nom&gt;&gt;\nDate: Wednesday, July 9, 2014 at 11:14 AM\nCc: Rest List &lt;rest-discuss@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt;\nSubject: Re: [rest-di=\r\nscuss] RESTful Toggle\n\n\n\nRobby, I&#39;d like to know more about the real world =\r\nneed for such an API. Sure, mechanical light switches DID work this way, bu=\r\nt do home automation systems really offer a &quot;toggle&quot;? I&#39;m trying to imagine=\r\n why I would ever want to simply change the state of the lighting in my roo=\r\nm, without caring if the result was lights on or lights off. I can&#39;t.\n\nSo a=\r\nre you programming a home automation system? If so, do you really need togg=\r\nle, given my observation above?\n\nOr is this just a hypothetical question ab=\r\nout the generic behavior of toggle and how it maps to REST? If so, then it =\r\nkind of feels like the perennial, &quot;Can REST do THIS?&quot; questions that skepti=\r\ncs of REST would lob from time to time in the good old REST v WS-STAR WARS =\r\ndays. It kind of reminds me of the old chestnut, &quot;How can I do two-phase co=\r\nmmit in REST?&quot;\n\nOr is your need for toggle behavior truly needed in some ot=\r\nher actual domain? If so, could you please tell us a bit more about the dom=\r\nain and it&#39;s REAL need for toggle behavior. With such context in mind, we c=\r\nan perhaps help you better map it into a RESTful API.\n\nThanks.\n\n-- Nick\n\nNi=\r\nck Gall\nPhone: +1.781.325.8370\nOther Contact Info: http://bit.ly/nickgall\n\n=\r\n\nOn Tue, Jul 8, 2014 at 5:28 PM, &#39;Simpson, Robby (GE Energy Management)&#39; ro=\r\nbby.simpson@...&lt;mailto:robby.simpson@...&gt; [rest-discuss] &lt;rest-discus=\r\ns-noreply@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss-noreply@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; wro=\r\nte:\nHi,\n\n\nI&#39;ve been scratching my head over this one for a while and am hop=\r\ning I can\nget some help.\n\n\nImagine a light switch with one simple resource:=\r\n /state , where state can\nbe &quot;On&quot; or &quot;Off.&quot;\n\n\nOne can PUT to /state , chang=\r\ning /state to either &quot;On&quot; or &quot;Off.&quot;\nSimilarly, a GET to /state will tell yo=\r\nu if the light is currently &quot;On&quot; or\n&quot;Off.&quot;\n\n\nWhere I&#39;m struggling is with a=\r\n safe &quot;Toggle&quot; mechanism.  That is, if\n/state is &quot;On&quot;, change it to &quot;Off&quot; a=\r\nnd vice versa.\n\n\nI understand that one solution would be to simply perform =\r\na GET on /state\nand then PUT the opposite.  However, I am concerned with bo=\r\nth the overhead\nand latency this entails as well as the potential for a rac=\r\ne condition\n(what if /state changes between the GET and the PUT?).\n\n\nAny so=\r\nlution I&#39;ve looked at thus far seems to violate RESTful principles,\nparticu=\r\nlarly regarding idempotency.  In short, can one safely toggle?\n\n\nAny sugges=\r\ntions?\n\n\nThanks,\nRobby\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\nPosted by: =\r\n&quot;Simpson, Robby (GE Energy Management)&quot; &lt;robby.simpson@...&lt;mailto:robby.=\r\nsimpson@...&gt;&gt;\n------------------------------------\n\n\n-------------------=\r\n-----------------\n\nYahoo Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
