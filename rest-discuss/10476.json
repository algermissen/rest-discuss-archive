If the status code is 404 then\n=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; is free for use. If username isn&#39;t the UID for users in the URI you\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; can use queries for that: HEAD /user?username=3D{username}. For email\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; something similar can be used. You can have both username and email\nas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; UID to find a single user with HEAD /user/{uid}, if both identifiers\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n give an unique user, there&#39;s no reason to choose just one.\n&gt; But we do not=\r\n want that users can use the email-address of another\nuser\n&gt; as username. A=\r\ndditionally we validate email-addresses slightly\ndifferent\n&gt; than usernames=\r\n. So it&#39;s important what&#39;s validated - username of\n&gt; email-address.\n&gt; But j=\r\nust for the username HEAD sounds well. So 404 would be the status\n&gt; code if=\r\n the username is still available, 409 if the username is\nalready\n&gt; taken, a=\r\nnd 400 if the username is not well formed?\n&gt;\n\nHmmm, since you have relative=\r\nly complex validation, you could think of\nvalidation as a process - a proce=\r\nss that you will complete with your\nactual back-end implementation, which i=\r\ns irrelevant right here. You\nsimply have to trigger that process - IMHO, a =\r\nsimple POST to a resource\nlike /validator might do the trick.\n\nCheers,\n    =\r\n Miran\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
