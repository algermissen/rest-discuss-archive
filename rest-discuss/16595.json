The dissertation says &quot;standard methods and\n&gt; representations&quot; but I understand this[1] as Roy clarifying that he\n&gt; meant specified not necessarily standardized. It seems far-reaching\n&gt; to me that an architectural style could go so far as to constrain the\n&gt; governance model of formats. The goal is shared understanding, which\n&gt; can be effectively achieved regardless of how the format was crafted\n&gt; (this is the same as the ubiquitous types line of reasoning too:).\n&gt;\n*snip*\n&gt;\n&gt; o) &quot;the type is registered and the registry points to a specification\n&gt; and the specification explains how to process the data according to\n&gt; its intent&quot; **\n&gt;\n&gt; To answer the original question, the vnd/prs trees can lead to shared\n&gt; understanding and satisfy that part of self-descriptiveness.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] -http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6594\n\nThat seems a much more &quot;common sense&quot; approach to the issue of registration.\n\nIt needs to be registered, somewhere, and that registry needs to point\nto a specification.\n\nBut there are a lot of registries, a lot of standard bodies, used in\nall sorts of domains.\n\nIANA will register anything in the vendor/personal tree. And IANA\ndoesn&#39;t maintain or assert any validity of these registrations.\nThere&#39;s an example of an IANA registered text type that apparently\nhave no surviving specifications. Both links associated with the media\ntype are dead. So, even if something is up on IANA, it can well be an\nincomplete registration, and IANA doesn&#39;t seem to have any vetting or\nmaintenance process to prevent that from happening.\n\nNow, &quot;the Web&quot; is often referred to, and tied to IANA. If &quot;the Web&quot;\nmeans standards that Web Browser creators use, and standard HTTP\nservers use when targeting Web Browser clients, then perhaps it is\nfair to consider IETF, via IANA, authoritative for that domain.\n\nBut REST is not &quot;the Web&quot;, HTTP servers can (and do) serve clients\nother than web browsers. And other domains and industries will be\nleveraging HTTP servers, and REST(-like?) architectures, and they will\nbe negotiating and standardizing their traffic through organizations\nand working groups other than IANA and IETF.\n\nSo, either the definition of REST needs to be clarified, or relaxed,\non this point, or there needs to be some new term to describe these\nother systems.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
