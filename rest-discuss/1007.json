And the way that is\n&gt; &gt; currently asserted is if you see a HTML FORM that says;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;form action=&quot;http://www.dierken.com/email/&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;/form&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; So:  in order to access the resource in question, a &quot;client&quot; needs to be able to\n&gt; understand not only URI+HTTP, but also HTML?\n\nNot at all.  I said &quot;currently&quot;.  Any machine processable format would\nsuffice.  I don&#39;t know that RDF has anything to say about query terms\n(hmm), but things like WRDL and WSDL do.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
