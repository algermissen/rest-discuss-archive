Performance-wise, it would probably be dog-slow without =\r\nreinvesting the years of effort that went into current browsers implementat=\r\nions.  Also, most clients wanting native apps do so because they feel that =\r\na web app would feel alien or be less visible.  I can tell that we have mad=\r\ne applications in the past which could have been better served by a web app=\r\n (or as well as); but don&#39;t forget the marketing aspect of being &quot;on the ap=\r\np store&quot;.  The nature of the beast is that clients as much as users prefer =\r\nnative application to web apps in most cases.\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Eric J.
