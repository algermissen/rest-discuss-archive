Why not just\n&gt; code the application to the bare metal if you&#39;re not amortizing any\n&gt; costs.\n\nYou got it.  Yes, it may allow for some interesting things to occur,\nsuch as replacing IP and DNS.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, I suspect that people will always resist\n&gt; resource-modelling their application so TCP will be a rich home for RPC\n&gt; applications forever.\n\nYah, just like all those renegade SNA and DECNET users. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
