If it happens anyway, without such an\nexpectation, then that&#39;s RESTful.\n\n&gt; but then later you seeem to suggest that the \n&gt; post-invocation visibility might be optional depending on your needs \n&gt; (and thus POST might be OK).\n\nWhat I meant is that if you *need* that visibility - aka if you need\nthe shared expectation I just spoke of - then you should use PUT.\n\n&gt; Given that there are all kinds of resources with varying semantics, \n&gt; etc., I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with blanket statements about the \n&gt; suitability of using POST for partial updates.  For instance, what about \n&gt; resources with read-only/unmodifiable components to their state.  It \n&gt; seems to me that PUT would be inappropriate for those resources, so how \n&gt; do I update them?    Or do you just not call that sort of thing a \n&gt; partial update?\n\nPUT would still be appropriate.  I suppose what would be inappropriate\nwould be if the PUT request was specifying an invalid state of the\nresource - i.e. changing one of those immutable things you mentioned -\nin which case the server can always say &quot;Bzzt!&quot; via a 4xx response.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
