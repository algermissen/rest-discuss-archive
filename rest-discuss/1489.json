Some understanding between the two parties has to be achieved before\n&gt; &gt; you can start making use of it. RDF might change things but until then,\nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; resigned to the fact that it&#39;s impossible to expect to use a web service\n&gt; &gt; (SOAP or REST) without some development effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. I&#39;ll be even more pessimistic and say that semantic web\n&gt; technologies will not change this basic situation. When I walk into a\n&gt; bank wanting some foreign money, I need to know what an &quot;exchange rate&quot;\n&gt; is. If I write a currency trading client application it will need to\n&gt; know that same thing. I.e. it needs to know the concept and it needs to\n&gt; know either what term you will use for the concept or be able to map\n&gt; your term into its concept.\n\nYou&#39;re absolutely right. Since everything in RDF is identified using URIs,\nhowever, all you really need to know is the URIs for the classes and\nproperties that you&#39;re interested in. The format (whether it be RDF in XML,\nN3, or arbitrary XML vocabularies augmented with RDF-aware attributes--a pet\nproject of mine) isn&#39;t as important--you can just extract the assertions out\nof whatever representation you&#39;ve requested and then process them\naccordingly. I&#39;m probably simplifying thinks too much to be practical but it\nsure sounds nice, doesn&#39;t it?\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
