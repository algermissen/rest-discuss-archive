Browsers know that user name and password fields on\n&gt; HTML forms usually have consistent names. And Google Toolbar saves\n&gt; some common personal info about you and auto-populates your name,\n&gt; address, etc, based on a common vocabulary. You just program a client\n&gt; to map information it has, to fields identified by name -- a\n&gt; vocabulary.\n&gt; Misconception: &quot;Forms are schemas&quot;\n&gt; Correction: Forms are  queries made by the server to the client. &quot;Give\n&gt; me the data you have named &#39;author-email&quot;.  Schemas describe relations\n&gt; among objects. They describe models, not messages.\n\nThe actual query made by the server to the client is:\nPut a text box next to the human-readble text &quot;Please enter your email\naddress&quot;. Return what the user enters into that box as the\n&quot;author-email&quot; element of an xml document. Oh, and by the way. Don&#39;t\nsubmit it back until that xml document maches this xml schema I supply.\n\nThe kind of client atompub is designed to support already has a text\nbox. It&#39;s called &quot;author&quot;. Now your form says &quot;give me author-email&quot;...\nbut there is no author-email box in the application. The application has\nalready been written and its data model doesn&#39;t match yours. Now what\nwould you like the client to do about it?\n\nIf you just want to supply a form to a user, you can do that. You don&#39;t\nneed atompub for that. You don&#39;t need any standardisation past HTML\nforms or XForms. Atompub is what you are looking for when you want to\nwrite a clever and easy to use thick-client atom authoring client.\nSupplying a form to this thick client isn&#39;t going to help. You say you\nwant an author-email box next to the &quot;Please enter your email address&quot;\ntext? Hey! my interface has already been designed. Where do you expect\nme to put that text box? If you want to design your own interface, just\nsupply the form to a web browser and be done with it. For me, I have my\nown user interface. The purpose of atompub is to allow that client with\nits complete user interface to submit articles to a server that has also\nbeen written.\n\n&gt; Starry-eyed delusion: A Standards process can capture the union of all\n&gt; the semantics any server could manifest.\n&gt; Corollary: Exchanging these documents is &quot;scalable&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Real world experience: RosettaNet PIP 3A4. Thoroughly specified\n&gt; schemas describing almost every possible Purchase Order Request and\n&gt; Response. Guess how long it takes one large computer manufacturer to\n&gt; shake out enough impedance mismatches to get going with each new\n&gt; trading partner? 30-60 days, and that is a dedicated team of experts\n&gt; exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and resolving\n&gt; the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents. So that&#39;s one\n&gt; or two months per partner. How long does it take to ramp on just 100\n&gt; partners? Years. Not  web scale, is it?\n\nBad standards exist, therefore standards are bad. Nice logic. Next I&#39;m\nsure you&#39;ll tell me about how bad HTML is and why it will never be\ndeployed or understood by anyone. We should require that web browsers\nprovide a form for the server to fill out that informs the server of the\nclient&#39;s capabilities. That will help. When the client says it doesn&#39;t\nunderstand &lt;h3&gt;, the server will know exactly what to do. It&#39;ll just\ntranslate those h3 elements into h2 elements. Of course the programmer\nwho wrote the server will have anticipated this and written the\ncapability into it.\n\nOf course the first round of standardisation is a shambles. It hardly\never works until the authors of clients and servers have some\nimplementation experience and have developed some mutual trust in their\nmutual interests. That is why standards like atom have defined\nmechanisms for evolvability, and why atom has been so long in\ndevelopment despite person-decades of experience in related precursor\nstandards.\n\nDocument standards represent a conversation between document producers\nand consumers about their needs. It is a compromise between features and\ncomplexity in problem domains that are rarely mapped out well enough to\nhave a sane conversation about. Trying to carry on a conversation\noutside of the process however between your server and my client isn&#39;t\ngoing to get anywhere. Machines can&#39;t communicate unless their\nprogrammers already can. Unless the author of the client software and\nthe author of the server software agree out of band, communication\ncannot happen.\n\n&gt; Exchanging pre-defined special purpose documents, as APP does,\n&gt; satisfies REST&#39;s definition, but it&#39;s not webby.  Forms have proven\n&gt; their scalability on the web, because they promote loose coupling.\n&gt; They offer hope that web services could be deployed at web scale.\n\nWhat you are saying is that server-provided user interfaces have proven\nuseful on the web because they don&#39;t require prior agreement with the\nclient software about what the user interface will look like. That is\nall well and good, but doesn&#39;t translate into good practice for machine\nto machine communications. When a machine has an atom document it wants\nto submit to another machine, it is too late to start messing with the\ncontent. The client machine doesn&#39;t know how. It has to rely on out of\nband agreement with the server to what is acceptable.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
