I have a set=\r\n of draft posts and published posts. In order to change a draft post to a p=\r\nublished post I need to &quot;publish&quot; it. How should I represent one such comma=\r\nnd in REST?\n\nAtomPub has native support for that use case: http://tools.iet=\r\nf.org/html/rfc5023#section-13.1.1\n\nUse &lt;app:draft/&gt; to mark the posting as =\r\ndraft and simply update the posting (without &lt;app:draft/&gt;) to have it publi=\r\nshed.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is my thoughts so far:\n&gt; \n&gt; The two sets are represe=\r\nnted by two different ATOM resources, each having their own URL. Each indiv=\r\nidual post also has it&#39;s own resource URL. Nothing special here.\n&gt; \n&gt; In or=\r\nder to publish a post I can do:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Use a new HTTP verb called &quot;PUBLISH=\r\n&quot; and send that to the draft post I want to publish.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) POST the compl=\r\nete blog post representation on the &quot;published posts&quot; URL, thereby adding t=\r\nhe blog post to the published list, and implicitly remove it from the draft=\r\n list.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Do an empty POST to a sub-resource of the blog post named &quot;p=\r\nublish&quot; indicating that I want to &quot;publish&quot; that resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Expose t=\r\nhe single &quot;published&quot; state value as a sub-resource of the blog post and PO=\r\nST true/false to that resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Mainting a non-ATOM list of publish=\r\ned blog post identifiers. When publishing a blog post I can POST that post&#39;=\r\ns identifier to the &quot;published&quot; identifier list (instead of sending the com=\r\nplete set of blog post data).\n&gt; \n&gt; What are your suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, =\r\nJ=F8rn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
