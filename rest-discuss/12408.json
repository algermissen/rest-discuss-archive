The article Subbu provided\n&gt;&gt; (http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/10/generalized-linking) is a great\n&gt;&gt; example of what is possible with JSON in that regard.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kris Zyp&#39;s efforts on JSON referencing, whilst maybe not as\n&gt;&gt; extensible as Subbu&#39;s proposal, have been implemented on the client\n&gt;&gt; side in the Dojo toolkit\n&gt;&gt; (http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/06/17/json-referencing-in-dojo/),\n&gt;&gt; and they seem to provide an adequate hypermedia mechanism for &#39;basic&#39;\n&gt;&gt; HATEOAS.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I know Kris&#39;s articles and, indeed, I&#39;m using Dojo for a client \n&gt; accessing a RESTful service. However, unless I&#39;m much mistaken, these \n&gt; proposals only address linking, which, of course, is essential for \n&gt; HATEOAS, but not all of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nHi Michael,\n\nSubbu&#39;s proposal addresses media-type and language based content \nnegotiation, so it&#39;s more than just linking.\n\nEither way, I think it&#39;s fair to say that the uniform interface and URIs \nprovide everything required to build a RESTful interface that leverages \nHATEOAS.\n\nAdditional hyperlink markup is icing on the hypermedia cake that makes \nserver-driven negotiation possible but, as I understand it, HTTP is \nfairly liberal in defining how negotiation should be approached \n(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html) which is a good \nindication that HATEOAS can actually be agent or server driven (or both).\n\nThe most common solution is to use dot notation tacked-on to the end of \na URI (document.xml, document.json) and to perform agent-driven or \ntransparent content negotiation - I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of this \napproach because it dilutes the meaningfulness of URIs, and makes life \nmore complicated for intemediaries like caches - e.g. how does a cache \nknow whether or not a PUT to document.xml invalidates the cache for \ndocument.json? There are solutions to this problem by teaching \nintemediaries about your special URI patterns, but this is unnecessarily \ncomplicated and expensive when HTTP provides an adequate protocol level \nalternative. It&#39;s also not very uniform.\n\nDespite this, putting content negotation in URIs and leaving it to \nagents is extremely common - so in some respect you could actually \nconsider linking &#39;all of HATEOAS&#39;.\n\n&gt;&gt; The most significant difference I see between Subbu and Kris&#39;\n&gt;&gt; proposals are the optional content negotation properties - namely\n&gt;&gt; &#39;type&#39; and &#39;hreflang&#39; - I absolutely agree with Subbu that these\n&gt;&gt; properties are important for extensbility, but clearly (since they\n&gt;&gt; are optional) they are not &#39;crucial&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly; other hypermedia formats like HTML provide no concrete\n&gt;&gt; markup for content negotation either, although they probably should\n&gt;&gt; in my opinion! HTML5 is not adding markup for this at time of writing\n&gt;&gt; :(\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; IOW, the experts haven&#39;t decided on how things should be done, yet. \n&gt; That&#39;s fine, but as I&#39;m looking for practically applicable guidelines \n&gt; and examples, I realized that I&#39;m too early and just have to wait some \n&gt; more. As much as I&#39;m interested in the results, I don&#39;t want to enter \n&gt; this particular discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nI only really mentioned HTML as an example that this ambiguity in \nhyperlink semantics exists in well established markup, not just in \nnewbies like JSON. The cake&#39;s fine in both though so don&#39;t worry! :)\n\nSo, practically, I think the best thing to do is pick a markup and \nclient library that provide &#39;basic HATEOAS&#39; and allow for backward \ncompatible extension of the hyperlink markup. Whether Dojo and JSON \nreferencing provide this, I&#39;m not sure. Subbu&#39;s markup looked pretty \ngood but I don&#39;t know of any existing clients for it.\n\nCheers,\nMike\nhttp://twitter.com/mike__kelly\n\n"}}
