I\ndon&#39;t know why http doesn&#39;t have this discovery piece - I hope wrdl becomes\nworkable and popular.\n\nIf a request or response blob is node addressable you can write simple maps\nthe extract interesting properties. If the content is xml, you can extract\nthem from the body as well. So on the server side, you can say &#39;username\ncomes from (in xpath syntax) /request/header/authentication/user or\n/request/query/userid or wherever. This causes the set of names you want to\nextract (like &#39;username&#39; or &#39;resource&#39;) to become the interface for\ninteroperation and these little maps become mini-adapters. It&#39;ll only go so\nfar in capability, but will help cover many situations. You&#39;ll also get into\narguments about how fine grained to make the request and response.\n\nSo what I&#39;m thinking is downloading a &#39;template&#39; of an HTTP request, with\nportions filled in (like the URL, etc.), and a separate &#39;interface def&#39;\nprovides names and pointers within that template. The &#39;interface def&#39; could\nhave &#39;username&#39; (a mutually agreed upon set of names - probably from http\nconcepts itself) and point to where that particular service expects the\nvalue to show up - sometimes people use HTTP auth, sometimes they use query\nterms, sometimes they use URIs, etc.\n\n\nMike &quot;on vacation sitting by the pool working through the glare&quot; Dierken\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Paul Prescod &lt;paul@...&gt;\nTo: S.

In that the form is served\n&gt; up at runtime but this thing is more about declaring things in advance\n&gt; like a schema.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n"}}
