The fact that the source file \nstill exists is neither here nor there, there is no requirement that the \nserver delete _anything_ in response to a DELETE method, the only \nrequirement is that a resource that has been successfully deleted responds \n4xx instead of 2xx.\n\nYou make a good point that a PUT or a POST can set an expiration date for \na resource, in which case it switches from 2xx to 4xx without a DELETE, \nbut in my case I see no reason to add complexity when I simply want a \nDELETE to change a resource&#39;s status from 200 to 410.  The debate here is \nabout changing a resource&#39;s status from 410 to 404 using HTTP.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
