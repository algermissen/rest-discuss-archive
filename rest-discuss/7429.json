Is there a \n&gt; W3C finding \n&gt; &gt; that documents this, or some other paper?  I&#39;ve been doing a \n&gt; &gt; significant amount of research on URLs and URI best \n&gt; practices in the \n&gt; &gt; past 3+ months and have found nothing like this (though I \n&gt; could have \n&gt; &gt; missed it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#avoid-uri-aliases\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;URI owner SHOULD NOT associate arbitrarily different URIs \n&gt; with the same resource.&quot;\n\nThanks for the link.  \n\n*Sigh*  I think that finding optimizes one aspect of the web at the expense\nof others. It certainly places limits on what can be done from a URL\nusability perspective.  While I do understand the rationale behind it, I\nplan to advocate that the finding needs be reconsidered in the future.\nHowever I know that the current state of web specifications makes that\nimpractical, I want to look at root cause of why it&#39;s not practical and see\nwhat we can do to address it. The research I&#39;m doing has been heading me\ndown this path and I will be writing about it at length in the near future.\n\nBTW, I&#39;d argue that a worst problem exists with respect to URL aliases from\nthe perspective of web apps being sloppy. Web apps that use query parameters\nin different orders, that use sessionIDs and userID as query parameters\nwhere it doesn&#39;t change the content, and so on create lots of URI aliases\nunintentionally. Ironically, nobody says much about that. That&#39;s another\nproblem that I also think really should be addressed at the same time.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
