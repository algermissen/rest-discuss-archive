Ease of use\n&gt; is an important architectural aspect to consider.  There is dissonance\n&gt; that developers feel when switching between OO and REST.  In other words\n&gt; switching between OO and REST is a major paradigm shift.  Switching\n&gt; between &quot;dynamic objects&quot; and &quot;generic objects&quot; is not that big a deal.\n\nMy experience is exactly the opposite.  I was never comfortable with the\nCORBA style SOA based architecture.  Whenever I did any substantial\nwork in it, I always found so many integration problems due to the\ndifferent assumptions about each object&#39;s internal exposed through its\ninterface; failure model, concurrency, etc..  When I realized what the\nWeb was, and that &quot;all&quot; I was doing was ensuring that each object had\nthe same interface, I immediately &quot;got it&quot; because I realized just how\neasy it was going to make my job as developer of distributed objects.\n\nIMO, REST is more &quot;OO&quot; (whatever exactly that means - things with\nbehaviour, state, identity, I say) than SOAs.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
