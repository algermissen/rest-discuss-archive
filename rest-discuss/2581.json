My conclusion has been that this is a good thing.\n&gt; What&#39;s more,\n&gt; as I was falling asleep last night, additional thoughts occurred\n&gt; to me that\n&gt; I now feel the need to share with the list.  Tell me what you think...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I contend that PUT does not fit well with the REST model.  First, there is\n&gt; the issue of resource creation.  PUT is allowed to submit a &quot;non-existing&quot;\n&gt; request-URI as if it did exist.  This request-URI has no identity\n&gt; whatsoever\n&gt; (not even with the request-entity that will become the new\n&gt; resource).  From\n&gt; my ever-evolving understanding of REST, allowing the usage of URIs in this\n&gt; manner is just plain wrong.  I absolutely agree with this regardless of\n&gt; REST.  As I recently mentioned [1], I feel that using POST to create all\n&gt; resources is just as effective and keeps the URI rules simple.\n\nIMHO,\n\nthe URI exists all the time. It just isn&#39;t mapped to a particular resource.\n\nKeep in mind that *one* usage of HTTP is *authoring* of web sites, and\nthat&#39;s where PUT is already heavy usage (through WebDAV/Microsoft\nWebfolders/IIS/Apache moddav), and I don&#39;t see any problem with that (a part\nfrom how to handle authoring of varying resources, as recently discussed on\nthe URI mailing list).\n\nJulian\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n"}}
