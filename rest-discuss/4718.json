I don&#39;t remember what the actual\napplication was -- or did anyone bother to ask or mention it? How does\nthis queue thing fit into your Web site / Web application / Web service?\nUsually when I implement a queue in a Web application (say, for sending\nemail reliably) the producers are the request handlers in the server\n(exposing a more interesting semantic than &quot;queue&quot; to the clients) and the\nconsumer is a daemon thread also in the server, so it can do whatever\narbitrary atomic transactions it needs to do under the covers. It seems\nmore than a little silly to implement a raw queue as a RESTful Web\nservice. REST, and the Web it describes, is about lots of clients talking\nto semanticful resources... A single consumer talking to a raw queue isn&#39;t\nvery interesting in that context, so any solution you come up with is\ngoing to be awkward.\n\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
