That is why I want notification to be\n&gt; &gt; a distinct method (so as not to get confused with\n&gt; &gt; whatever listener management the client\n&gt; &gt; implements).\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem with this is that (a) *new methods impose unnecessary adoption friction*,\n\nThat was MY argument before.  YOU pursuaded me\nthat new methods are OK. If you want, I can go\nrehash YOUR arguments :-)\n\n&gt; and (b)\n&gt; *NOTIFY to a listener is not a reasonable part of the generic interface of resources, as not\n&gt; all resources can be listeners.*\n\nYeah, thats what I think we are disagreeing about.\n\n&gt; New methods should only be created for generic operations\n&gt; that are universally meaningful to all potential resources.\n\nI don&#39;t think LOCK works on all resources.\nI don&#39;t think POST makes sense for static files.\n\n&gt; I believe this to be the case.  Whether or not a particular resource supports a particular\n&gt; method should be an authorization concern, not an interface concern.\n\nHow do you explain the differences between:\n401 Unauthorized\n403 Forbidden\n405 Method Not Allowed\n501 Not Implemented\n503 Service Unavailable\n\nIt certainly seems like the HTTP spec contemplates\nnew non-universal methods.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
