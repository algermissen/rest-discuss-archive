Intermediaries would have to parse an XML entity body\nto route the request and caches will never know to invalidate\neither of the actual resources involved.\n\nI consider explicit addressing the primary criterion to preserve\nwhen straining against the uniform interface. So the solution I\nproposed is bad insofar as it puts the verb in the entity body\nrather than in the HTTP method, but at least it exposes one of\nthe resources being operated on at the HTTP level. That’s the\nbest that can be done within the confines of the HTTP uniform\ninterface. (If you do it by introducing a new general-purpose\nmethod that covers these semantics then you have done better but\nyou also have a different uniform interface than the HTTP one –\ntradeoffs, tradeoffs…)\n\nPS.: in case someone wants to propose minting a new processor\nresource for each node so one can POST the URI to something like\nthis:\n\n    /node/new/subsumer\n\nI considered and rejected that because it merely essentially\nlifts the verb from the entity body to the URI (which is a minor\ngain as it allows intermediaries to specifically route such\nrequests without inspecting the body) at the cost of misdirected\ncache invalidation in intermediaries and clients (which is a big\nloss).\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
