I don&#39;t have my thoughts formalized but I find myself asking myself: =\r\n&quot;how would I layout this out for human navigation&quot;?\n\nIn other words, if thi=\r\ns was a web page (providing the same capabilities) would I really have a pa=\r\nge with all these state transitions (links) available on it or would I mode=\r\nl the solution completely differently?  If it would be different for the hu=\r\nman usage scenario, why isn&#39;t that applicable in the machine/API usage scen=\r\nario?\n\nObviously, the situations do differ but I think I would need to figu=\r\nre out where designing for human consumption fails to meet the needs of mac=\r\nhine consumption and then make changes there.\n\nEb\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Tim Williams &lt;williamstw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m having challenges=\r\n in certain situations because of the numerous\n&gt; allowable state transition=\r\ns.  For example, if I have an &quot;phone book&quot;\n&gt; search application, I might be=\r\n able to expose the initial search like:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://myphonebook.com/search=\r\n?q=3D{searchTerms}\n&gt; \n&gt; Which might respond with a list of people.  But the=\r\n service doesn&#39;t\n&gt; want to return them all, so it pages them and provides l=\r\ninks to the\n&gt; next/previous page.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;previous&quot; href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//myphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;next&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D3&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; But then a client comes in and sa=\r\nys she needs some additional state\n&gt; transitions for sorting some metadata =\r\nfields.  So, the service exposes\n&gt; them:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;previous&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;next&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D3&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.lastnam=\r\ne&quot; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?s=3Dlastname&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=\r\n=3D&quot;sort.firstname&quot;\n&gt; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?s=3Dfirstn=\r\name&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.city&quot; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123=\r\n?s=3Dcity&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.county&quot; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/res=\r\nults/123?s=3Dcounty&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Later, another client comes and says he needs t=\r\no provide direct links\n&gt; to 10 pages of results (e.g. page 1 - 10).  So, th=\r\ne services exposes\n&gt; those too:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;previous&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.1&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.2&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D2&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.3&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D3&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.4&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D4&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.5&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D5&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.6&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D6&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.7&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D7&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.8&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D8&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.9&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nmyphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D9&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;page.10&quot; href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/myphonebook.com/results/123?p=3D10&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.lastname&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?s=3Dlastname&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.=\r\nfirstname&quot;\n&gt; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?s=3Dfirstname&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.city&quot; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?s=3Dcity=\r\n&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;sort.county&quot; href=3D&quot;http://myphonebook.com/results/123?=\r\ns=3Dcounty&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even later... well, you get the point.  So, how do folks=\r\n generally\n&gt; deal with resources that happen to have many potential next st=\r\nates?\n&gt; At a certain point the list of links can get ridiculous, leading to=\r\n\n&gt; the temptation to templatize the URL - but then that parameterization\n&gt; =\r\nfeels wrong.  Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also concerned about the tight-coupling of=\r\n it.  I mean, it seems\n&gt; that URI Templates are less than ideal because it =\r\ncreates a tighter\n&gt; coupling between service/client.  On the other hand, it=\r\n seems that\n&gt; I&#39;ve basically transferred that coupling from the templated U=\r\nRL over\n&gt; to the &quot;rel&quot; attribute.  Any thoughts on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; --t=\r\nim\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
