They just use it at design time by making the server&#39;s state machine static. This information is then published as *hypermedia* for *design time* consumption instead of runtime consumption.\n\nThe consequence is of course that client and server are coupled by their original design[1]. However, systems still benefit from the induced simplicity by this &#39;style&#39; so it should not be ruled out as such, just be correctly understood.\n\n\nAn appropriate name would maybe have to emphasize the satic nature of the use of hypermedia?\n\nResource Orientation with Static Hypermedia (ROSH)\nResource Oriented and Coupled (ROAC)\n\netc.\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/8377\n\n\nOn Feb 16, 2010, at 9:39 PM, Jan Algermissen wrote:\n\n&gt; Given that the creation of APIs that ignore the hypermedia constraint is undeniably an ongoing activity wouldn&#39;t it be nice to give those a name in order to differentiate them from RESTful APIs?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that it can in various circumstances be argued to be to have HTTP based APIs that define some URI layout and maybe only use generic media types. It is certainly more useful than doing the same API with RMI, SOAP or CORBA.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, given there is no name for them, they simple become &#39;REST-APIs&#39; which obfuscates the fact that systems using those APIs will *not* have the properties induced by REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we name them, differentiation between the two becomes a lot easier.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What I lack is a compelling name that sounds cool enough so API owners can still be proud even if they are not (yet) in the REST-Olymp of things :-) ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP-base APIs\n&gt; Fixed-URI-APIs\n&gt; \n&gt; Both *not* cool....\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt; NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt; Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
