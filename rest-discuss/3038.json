So, it would be RESTful to have\n&gt; those two URIs for example\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.physicists.org/html/list-of-physicists\n&gt; http://www.physicists.org/xml/list-of-physicists\n&gt; \n&gt; although the representations they return are\n&gt; representations of the same resource (concept) and only differ\n&gt; in the markup language used ?\n\nthe trouble (IMHO) with this is that you have different representations\nof the same resource using different URIs.  i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s not\nRESTful, but i do think it dilutes the RESTfulness.\n\nbecause most UAs, be they RSS aggregators or web browsers, seem to be\nbrain-damaged when it comes to content negotiation, i believe the best\ncompromise is to use a query-string parameter to do the\ncontent-negotiation instead.  i see that joe gregorio uses this\ntechnique for RSS representations in RESTLog[0].  you can use\n/RESTLog.cgi?rss for example.\n\ni prefer to use a more explicit query-string, i.e. ?_type=xml.  the\nunderscore before type is to reduce the potential for a namespace\ncollision with a &#39;real&#39; query parameter name.  the reason to use a\nquery-string name/value pair is to ease integration with URIs that have\n&#39;legitimate&#39; query-strings.\n\nfor content-negotiation-capable UAs, you just leave that querystring\nparameter out.  i think this is more RESTful than having a different URI\nfor every single representation.  i think it would be useful if people\nbuilding RESTful systems used a standard querystring parameter for this\npurpose  (the same way google uses ?q=foo for a keyword search and\nothers have copied this) so content-negotiation capable UAs know they\ncan discard it, keeping a &#39;cleaner&#39; URI.\n\n-vincent\n\nreferences:\n0. http://wellformedweb.org/\n\n\n"}}
