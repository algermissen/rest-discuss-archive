I don&#39;t think its right to say that &quot;REST is better than RPC&quot; or\n&quot;RPC is better than REST&quot;.  It really depends on context.  Sometimes one\nmakes sense, sometimes the other does.  If you&#39;re integrating a bunch of\nlegacy apps, SOAP/RPC probably makes more sense than REST.  If you&#39;re\npublishing a widely available, general interest service on the Web, REST\nprobably makes sense.\n\nI don&#39;t consider myself a strong advocate of either view.  Being in one\n&quot;camp&quot; seems like a religious war that can never be won.  I think the\nproper way to proceed is to clearly enumerate the strengths and\nweaknesses of all approaches and then provide guidelines on when to use\nwhich architectural style.  Sounds like it might be a good article :)\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Paul Prescod [mailto:paul@...]\n \n&gt; Interestingly, there are roughly three main camps in the web services\n&gt; world, RPC, &quot;messaging&quot; (I use scare quotes because the term doesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem to be very well defined) and REST. Standard OO (with addressable\n&gt; object interfaces and type-specific interfaces) isn&#39;t really\nrepresented\n&gt; at all. Procedural, single-endpoint RPC may &quot;seem like&quot; the closest\n&gt; pattern but its limitations are also the most obvious and severe.\n&gt; --\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
