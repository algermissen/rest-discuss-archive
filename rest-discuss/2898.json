One could also code up an evaluator that \n&gt; &gt; determined if the transaction evidence followed the rules or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.  And as I remember us talking about before, it&#39;s very \nimportant\n&gt; that all this be done in the context of stateless interaction.  How \nthat\n&gt; would look, given the complexity of the stuff you listed, could be\n&gt; quite gnarly.  It&#39;s the issue about whether the meaning is \nencapsulated\n&gt; in the identifier, or in what the identifier might resolve to at any\n&gt; given time.  Sometimes, it might be necessary to include some of the\n&gt; things you mentioned by *value* in a message, rather than just by\n&gt; reference with a URI.\n\nIt would be possible to include things by value, but you could get \ninto conflicts if your included value differed from the reference.\n\nOne of the simplifications in some of that discussion was Paul&#39;s \nsuggestion for the reference to include the hash of the canonical \nrepresentation of the referenced resource.  \n\nBut do you have any examples in mind of what you think would need to \nbe included by value?\n\n\n"}}
