With full hyperlinking, it isn&#39;t necessary to make the UI be\na query string off of the &#39;data&#39; resource - possibly handy, but not\nrequired.\n\nThis suggests that rather than thinking about the &#39;edit vs view&#39; HTML as\nbeing different representations of the same &#39;data resource&#39;, that they are\nin fact two different &#39;user interface&#39; resources. The &#39;view&#39; one could be a\nrepresentation of the data resource and use the user-agent and Accept:\nheader information to come out as intended.\n\n&gt; That I want to submit the update as a POST to\n&gt; http://server.com/users/userid seems obvious.  However its not so\n&gt; obvious to me that a GET of http://server.com/users/userid?mode=edit\n&gt; is the way to implement my edit view.\nFinding the URI for the &#39;edit mode&#39; has to happen via a hyperlink from some\nstarting point. It doesn&#39;t in fact have to be &#39;data-uri?mode=edit&#39; it could\nbe somewhere completely different. Its the tags/location within the\n&#39;starting point&#39; that tells you. You can implement the editing page any way\nyou want and don&#39;t have to worry about &#39;clean uri syntax&#39;.\nThere are implementation details that suggest you keep the URI on the same\nhost and if you use HTTP Auth or cookies, that you &#39;root&#39; those above both\nresources - you can just use &#39;/&#39; for the path of the cookie to do that.\n\nIts a tough problem, but I find it helps to think of the UI as a separate\nspace with its own URI - which don&#39;t necessarily have to be textually\nsimilar to the &#39;data resources&#39;.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nmike\n\n"}}
