I know one may simply use some HTTP client and work\n&gt; from there. However, I tend to see this practice as being quite\n&gt; tedious. In the SOAP/WSDL world, for instance, there&#39;s code\n&gt; generation. Though many of you would hate that (and it&#39;s\n&gt; understandable why), perhaps in the REST world, there is one that\n&gt; automatically reads the proper hyperlinks we give them on some parts\n&gt; of the resource representations provided in some URL. Of course, all\n&gt; this is done dynamically. Given one thing to do for instance, this\n&gt; client would go from some URL (perhaps &#39;/&#39; of the site), then follow\n&gt; some link from there and so on. Of course, should the server advice\n&gt; the client to cache the response, it would do so accordingly. Again,\n&gt; doing all these by hand may seem tedious.\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI though, from the server perspective, I see webmachine\n&gt; (http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/\n&gt; &lt;http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/&gt;\n&gt; ) as a pretty good example as to what I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan Vincent Liwanag\n&gt; jvliwanag@... &lt;mailto:jvliwanag%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--------------050702030908080204000301\r\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n name=&quot;LinkedDataCrawler.java&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n filename=&quot;LinkedDataCrawler.java&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------050702030908080204000301--\r\n\n"}}
