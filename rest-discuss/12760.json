More often than not what your CEO is interes=\r\nted in is\nnot your transactional objects but roll ups etc and analysis perf=\r\normed\nupon them. I understand the argument for OLAP but using this as an\nar=\r\ngument for REST seems to me to be like using the fact that they\nwhere skate=\r\ns as an argument for why I should watch tennis.\n\nBeyond that for a transact=\r\nional system there is still a &quot;black box&quot; in\nterms of how data affects othe=\r\nr data. Consider an example of a\nresource that tells me sales for the day a=\r\nnd a resource that accepts\nsales. There is a direct link between these two =\r\nthat may or may not be\nexposed.\n\n\nBTW the solutions I use are fairly far fr=\r\nom imperative. Currently I am\nusing what would be categorized as MEST (yes =\r\nthere can be argument if\nMEST is just the new buzzword for messaging). I ha=\r\nve lately been using\nresources on my read side and messaging on my transact=\r\nional side. I\nhave attempted at using REST more completely but am running i=\r\nnto the\nfact that it just doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense whatsoever in a\nco=\r\nmplex transactional situation.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 4, 2009 at 2:50 AM, johnzabrosk=\r\ni &lt;johnzabroski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Greg Young &lt;gregoryyoung1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s assume for a moment tha=\r\nt the following supposition is true: At\n&gt;&gt; their heart many systems that we=\r\n develop are behavior not data\n&gt;&gt; centric.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST is essentially a data=\r\n centric interchange. We can in various ways\n&gt;&gt; build behavioral interfaces=\r\n as data representations. Seb gave good\n&gt;&gt; examples using his rel links, an=\r\nother good example would be modelling\n&gt;&gt; a resource as a state machine. The=\r\nse solutions do however offer a\n&gt;&gt; rather large impedance mismatch with tha=\r\nt of our behavioral system\n&gt;&gt; (often times creating a large language gap as=\r\n an example).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When does this impedance mismatch become appropriate to=\r\n take on?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Greg\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the first step is to recognize this is not at =\r\nall a REST question. Put\n&gt; it to you this way, at what point does it make m=\r\nore sense to write things\n&gt; declaratively than imperatively?\n&gt;\n&gt; With decla=\r\nrative, you are saying &quot;be&quot;; with imperative, you are saying &quot;do&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This=\r\n is a pretty huge consequence. In order to be, you need to answer what.\n&gt; I=\r\nn order to do, you need to answer how. If you can make the leap from do to\n=\r\n&gt; be, then &lt;s&gt;do&lt;/s&gt; be it. For one, I think you can reason about reliabili=\r\nty\n&gt; of your systems much easier if everything is declarative. Most softwar=\r\ne\n&gt; problems are related to poorly configured software, in part because we =\r\noften\n&gt; don&#39;t know what our settings do, or we can&#39;t easily understand how =\r\nour\n&gt; production environments differ from development environments.\n&gt;\n&gt; For=\r\n me, the value of a declarative system is that my CEO can query and\n&gt; drill=\r\n-down into any aspect of my system&#39;s design. There are no blackboxes;\n&gt; jus=\r\nt mathematical reasoning.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think &quot;modeling a resource as a state =\r\nmachine&quot; is an\n&gt; oversimplification. There are many ways to implement a sta=\r\nte machine, not\n&gt; all of them correct from a decoupling standpoint. Moreove=\r\nr, modeling\n&gt; programs as Finite State Automata is not easy, however once d=\r\none correctly\n&gt; the end result is highly robust software that correctly reu=\r\nses itself. You\n&gt; can very easily stick guards everywhere in your state mac=\r\nhine and then say,\n&gt; &quot;Look at this state machine I built&quot;, and &quot;mommy might=\r\n stick it on the\n&gt; fridge&quot;, but you&#39;ve just littered your architecture with=\r\n termites eager to\n&gt; decay every arch.\n&gt;\n&gt; A state machine without guards i=\r\ns effectively a declarative solution, by the\n&gt; way. Provided, of course, th=\r\nat the state machines it cooperates with are\n&gt; designed the same way. Pat H=\r\nelland actually has a CIDR paper that sort of\n&gt; addresses such a theme: Can=\r\n we really continue building reliable components\n&gt; out of unreliable ones? =\r\nHe uses a quick sand metaphor, and doesn&#39;t deal\n&gt; directly with object stat=\r\ne machines, but the lesson applies regardless.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nIt is the mark o=\r\nf an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought\nwithout accepting it.\n=\r\n\n"}}
