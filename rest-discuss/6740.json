Whether there is a &quot;need&quot; for this book in particular is\n&gt;  perhaps a more difficult question. :-)\n\nI&#39;ll second the &#39;need&#39; for such a book. Yes, I&#39;d love to read a\npragmatic version.\nI will question the accuracy, perhaps backing up what Roy and one or two\nothers keep pointing out. REST isn&#39;t easy to grasp for the typical\nweb monkey / casual user.\nREST for dummies (IMHO) sounds like a non starter.\nHitting the right level will be hard.\n\nThere are enough clever people on this list making mistakes\nto guarantee that mistakes will be made.\n\nRoy as a tech editor would drive me nuts, I&#39;m far too sloppy, but\nit sounds like that&#39;s what is needed (unless Roy makes time himself to write\na REST book).\n\nI might suggest an OSS book as per Eric Van der Vlists Relax NG book.\nUp on the web for a few months prior to publication, for critique and\nfeedback. Great idea.\n\nWhether it hurt the book sales I don&#39;t know. Three people who&#39;ve done\nthat believe it not to be the case.\n\nI guess it depends on the motives for writing the book?\n\n\nHTH\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
