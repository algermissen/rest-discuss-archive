Instead, you are dropping names.\n\nCould you please elaborate with =\r\na short discussion of how the design of Jersey encourages an architectural =\r\nstyle?  Ditto for Piston.\n\nOtherwise, again, I see it as mere namedropping.=\r\n\n\nEspecially as you apparently have experience with &quot;REST frameworks&quot; you d=\r\nislike, you should be able to form a qualitative if not quantitative analys=\r\nis of what makes them good or bad.\n\n\n"}}
