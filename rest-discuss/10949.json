In that case, the transaction could be\ncorrected and PUT back again singly.\n\nThe transaction resources could also be found from other parents, e.g.\nthe inventory item that they modified, the parties involved, the\nlocations, a resource which listed all transactions, a search\nresource, etc.\n\n"}}
