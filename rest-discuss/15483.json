I=92d be interested to hear if there is any cons=\r\nensus on how to =91best=92 enable content negotiation where the negotiation=\r\n includes different formats of the same media type?\n\nRegarding your require=\r\nments:\n\n- are the two versions really so different that you cannot serve on=\r\ne kind and just use a subset of the data in the special use case?\n\n\n- is th=\r\nis really a conneg issue or could you link to a different resource in the p=\r\nrevious representations received by the special user agent (e.g. determined=\r\n from the User-Agent header)?\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some possible options include:\n&gt; Usin=\r\ng a type/format parameter on the standard media type, e.g. application/json=\r\n;type=3Duigrid\n&gt; Using a specific media type, e.g. application/json+uigrid =\r\nor something from the vnd space\n&gt; Using a query string parameter, e.g. http=\r\n://mydomain/widgets?format=3Duigrid\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please bear in mind that this is =\r\nfor use within an enterprise and not on the internet.\n\nI&#39;d always make the =\r\nvariants different resources and link to a negotiated &#39;parent&#39; resource. Re=\r\nquests to the parent then perform conneg and serve the representation of th=\r\ne best variant and a Content-Location header to tell the user agent the &#39;re=\r\nal&#39; URI. (See my last posting here)\n\nOnly use a different media type if the=\r\n processing semantics are different.\n\nJan\n\n\nP.S. Make sure you do not use a=\r\npplication/json but mint your special type. Esp. sincle you are behind clos=\r\ned doors.\n\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Phil\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Philip N.
