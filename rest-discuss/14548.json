And I what I&#39;m trying to get at here is that the media type is the\n&gt; client&#39;s contract not the service&#39;s. In the customer support example above,\n&gt; both VoiceXML and HTML are mandated by the respective clients. The service\n&gt; is conforming to those media types in order to be able to interact with\n&gt; those clients. The client is not coupled to the service at all -- just the\n&gt; media type, URI and HTTP. The service has the freedom to support whatever\n&gt; representations it chooses -- it is not coupled to any one client&#39;s media\n&gt; type.\n&gt;\n\n\nWhile I think I agree with you (to an extent), this does suggest that\nclients are built in isolation which I do not believe is the case in\npractice.  Maybe the mistake is that we should look at what capabilities the\nclient needs to have and then use (or create a new) a media type that\nsufficiently expresses those capabilities.  I see media type as the\n&quot;language spoken&quot; (excuse my poor expression) between a client and server\nand for anything meaningful to happen, they must both speak the same\nlanguage.  From that perspective, a client is indirectly coupled (only) to\nservices that speak its media type(s) and vice versa.\n\nWhere this gets interesting is that it seems to me that for every standard\nmedia type that exists, clients (and servers) have been hard wired to\nunderstand the media type in the context that the media type was created\nfor.  Browsers were written to understand HTML for a purpose.  Sure, I can\nuse HTML (or XML or Atom) to represent anything I want but does that mean\nthat just because my service and browser and client agree on text/html that\nmy browser will be able to do anything meaningful with the representation if\nthe semantics have nothing to do with display (for example)?  I don&#39;t think\nso.  This is why I would still have to document (out of band) the semantics\ncontained in my representation even if I used a standard media type.  Now\nthere are positives, such that the browser could possibly render aspects of\nthe representation etc etc, but that&#39;s not the major point at the moment.\n\n\nAs always, I would love to be corrected. :)\n\n\nEb\n\r\n--000e0cd11aaaae58bb047d1d58be\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHello Andrew -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Wed, Jan 13, 2010 at 11=\r\n:05 PM, Andrew Wahbe &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:andrew.wahbe@g=\r\nmail.com&quot;&gt;andrew.wahbe@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin=\r\n: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;backg=\r\nround-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_q=\r\nuote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sure, but you are basically=\r\n saying that the media type forms the contract right?
