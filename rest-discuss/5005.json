I have been\ndoing web services for a while now, am Web Service track chair at\nSDWest, speaker at various other conferences and general supporter of\nREST.\n\nGranted I like SOAP and WSDL, but no more than that!  I tend to be\nvery skeptical of all the WS-* specs.  Reminds me of the &quot;bad ol\nCORBA&quot; days when you had tons of specifications and two ORBS still\ncould not exchange information.\n\nChristian Gross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
