I would be very surprised if a \n&quot;DISSERTATION submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for \nthe degree of DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in Information and Computer Science&quot;  \nhas only one interpretation\nNow what you can argue is that my interpretation is different then \nyours, and you can even argue that yours is more close to the intentions \nof Mr Fielding, and that&#39;s OK, maybe you&#39;re right. But even then, you \nshould say that &quot;my understanding of Roy&#39;s thesis is different from \nyours&quot; instead of &quot;you&#39;re misunderstanding Roy&#39;s thesis&quot;... Unless \nyou&#39;re Roy...\n\nNeverthless, my interpretation actually is similar to the bigger part of \nwhat you said, but what you&#39;re describing at the end of your post is \nwhat is referred as &quot;tunnelling&quot; and that&#39;s not we&#39;re doing. We are not \ntunnelling HTTP over other protocols or other proctocols over HTTP. We \ncould have done that, it had been more easy for us, since we&#39;re \npartially based on Jersey and Jersey kinda support that. Instead, I&#39;v \nrewrited significant parts of what Jersey does with HTTP in order to \ndecouple the HTTP part from the REST part, in order to use the later \nwith other connectors that work over other protocols. Basically, we&#39;re \napplying the same RESTfull constraints that are &quot;natural&quot; in HTTP to \nother protocols. Of course that in order to do so we loose something, \nbut that&#39;s not the point.\n\nOur aim here is to provide a service to our clients so they can give us \nmoney in return. That is provided partially by our software \napplications. We build software to that aim. We don&#39;t build protocols, \nwe use them. And we&#39;re trying to do it in a Restfull way because we \nunderstand that there is value for us in doing so.\n\nBut then again, in my understanding of Roy&#39;s thesis, the constraints are \nto be applied to the architecture, not to the communication or the \nprotocol. That the communication and thus the protocol is part of that \narchitecture, that is true. That some protocols are are more &quot;natural&quot; \nfits for those constraints, that is also true. But people here focus too \nmuch in &quot;protocol&quot; and less in &quot;user-agents&quot; and &quot;connectors&quot;, that also \nare part of the architecture.\n\nRegarding your commentary about what you think are my intentions, and \nignoring your disdain  and tone of superiority, let me assure you I&#39;m \nnot trying to redefine anything nor have I the intellectual capabilities \nto do so, but I do am trying to understand REST. But more than that I&#39;m \ntrying to apply REST to a real world case scenario, not trying to \nphilosophize about it. And as so, I have to learn as I&#39;m doing, because \nunfortunately I don&#39;t have the time nor the money to do it otherwise.\n\nI understand that there are some superiors minds in this list that \naren&#39;t interested in these minor questions and doubts, but then again \nthis is rest-discuss, not rest-philosophical-discuss...\n\n\nEric J.

We do it, using diferent connectors to \n&gt;&gt; connect to our resources, in protocols like JMS and IMAP and intra-VM \n&gt;&gt; and I think some more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re misunderstanding Roy&#39;s thesis.\n&gt;\n&gt; (BTW, if you re-check this group&#39;s charter, you might find that\n&gt; rest-discuss is dedicated to discussions about the REST architectural\n&gt; style *as described in Roy&#39;s thesis*.  While you may try to redefine\n&gt; REST as a reference to the community, everyone else here thinks REST\n&gt; specifically refers to Roy&#39;s thesis.  So either accept that and stop\n&gt; making snarky comments about the thesis and criticizing answers that\n&gt; try to explain said thesis, or go start rest-discuss-discuss.  Please\n&gt; read and try to understand the thesis, instead of cherry-picking from\n&gt; it to support your arguments without any understanding of context.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; REST does not restrict communication to a particular protocol, but it\n&gt; does constrain the interface between components, and hence the scope of\n&gt; interaction and implementation assumptions that might otherwise be made\n&gt; between components. For example, the Web&#39;s primary transfer protocol is\n&gt; HTTP, but the architecture also includes seamless access to resources\n&gt; that originate on pre-existing network servers, including FTP [107],\n&gt; Gopher [7], and WAIS [36]. Interaction with those services is\n&gt; restricted to the semantics of a REST connector. This constraint\n&gt; sacrifices some of the advantages of other architectures, such as the\n&gt; stateful interaction of a relevance feedback protocol like WAIS, in\n&gt; order to retain the advantages of a single, generic interface for\n&gt; connector semantics.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What this means is, if you aren&#39;t using HTTP, then you&#39;re limited to\n&gt; using only those aspects of some other protocol that match the\n&gt; semantics of a generic REST connector.  If I have a URI and I want to\n&gt; allow others to GET a representation of that resource, then I can just\n&gt; as easily implement it as FTP -- provided that no content negotiation,\n&gt; caching, or other benefit of REST is required for the interaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; This does not mean that any protocol can be used to build a REST\n&gt; system, and it does not mean that any operation of some other protocol\n&gt; can be made RESTful.  If you build a REST system, that doesn&#39;t mean you\n&gt; should be able to swap FTP for HTTP on every operation -- that is not\n&gt; what protocol independence means.  FTP is *not* a RESTful protocol, but\n&gt; for some application interactions FTP may very well be substituted for\n&gt; HTTP without breaking the uniform interface constraint, while there&#39;s no\n&gt; way to model FTP&#39;s MGET method as a single, RESTful interaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP 1.1 is the only protocol out there which was specifically designed\n&gt; as a REST application protocol. FTP is just a transport protocol.  I&#39;m\n&gt; not counting Atom Protocol since it requires HTTP.  A REST protocol\n&gt; like AtomPub couldn&#39;t have been based around any other protocol,\n&gt; because there aren&#39;t any other REST application protocols to choose\n&gt; from (at least until Roy gets off his butt and finishes Waka... ;-).\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; I mean, what company doesn&#39;t use now email, or JMS for instance, in \n&gt;&gt; their day to day operations? We do it, using diferent connectors to \n&gt;&gt; connect to our resources, in protocols like JMS and IMAP and intra-VM \n&gt;&gt; and I think some more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all fine and good, provided that you&#39;re implementing a generic\n&gt; interface as seen from the outside world.  REST certainly allows you to\n&gt; implement a layer between your internal JMS, IMAP or whatever other\n&gt; components you have, and the WWW, using HTTP.  Roy&#39;s thesis again:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; A disadvantage of the uniform interface is that it may reduce network\n&gt; performance if the data needs to be converted to or from its natural\n&gt; format.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; IOW, if you have some JMS or IMAP component, you may need to implement\n&gt; a layer to convert from that &quot;natural format&quot; to one that&#39;s compatible\n&gt; with HTTP. REST doesn&#39;t imply that IMAP interactions can be made RESTful\n&gt; -- it does imply that you can use HTTP to access a resource that&#39;s\n&gt; normally managed by IMAP.  Think Webmail, where you can use HTTP to\n&gt; interact with your e-mail account from any Web browser, instead of\n&gt; being limited to using an e-mail client that speaks IMAP.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you can&#39;t make IMAP wholly RESTful, but you can design a REST system\n&gt; using HTTP to accomplish the same goals for a user, by encapsulating\n&gt; your IMAP system within a REST layer.  (Not that I&#39;ve ever seen a\n&gt; RESTful Webmail system, but there&#39;s no reason one can&#39;t be built.)\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
