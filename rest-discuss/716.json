There&#39;s a general problem of watched resources not wanting to be\n&gt; watched.

But I am\ndisclined to deal with that in the spec:\n\n 1. Already a problem on the Web. c.f. Slashdot effect. I&#39;ll bet there\nare some sites (e.g. dynamically generated using TeX) where even a FoRK\nposting could kill them.\n\n 2. Server can limit connections (admittedly suboptimal &quot;solution&quot;)\n\n 3. Very hard to engineer maliciously on a large scale because where did\nyou find all of those subscription URIs? You&#39;d have to do a hell of a\nlot of sniffing and hope that the subscription URIs are static. etc.\netc.\n\n 4. Not a real &quot;security hole&quot; in the sense that it doesn&#39;t expose data,\ncauses no harm at all to the client and it won&#39;t seriously harm a\nwell-written server either.\n\n&gt; ... It seems to me that there&#39;s an existing\n&gt; mechanism for handling this -- robots.txt.  Interesting.\n\nrobots.txt is similar but too different to be directly reused in my\nopinion. The one is about crawlers. The other is about subscribers. I\ndon&#39;t think that they are the same...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
