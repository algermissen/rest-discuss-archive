AFAICT none of \nthe\n&gt; existing standards are implemented using this approach.\n\nRobert, I don&#39;t know what kind of standards you want, but:\n\nThere is a set of &quot;Business Entity&quot; standards being developed in \nUN/CEFACT that I think would be a good basis for a suite of business-\noriented REST resources.  An RDF representation is in the works.\n\nHere&#39;s the latest draft:\nhttp://www.collaborativedomain.com/standards/documents/BET%20Draft%\n20Technical%20Specification_v008.zip\n\nYou can watch for further developments at:\nhttp://www.collaborativedomain.com/standards/\n\nUN/CEFACT grinds exceedingly slow, but the work is free for use.\n\nIt&#39;s one of those cases of a verbose and seemingly complex spec with \na terse and simple one wanting to get out.\n\nDisclaimer:  I was involved heavily at one point.\n\n\n"}}
