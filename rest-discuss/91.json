Encapsulation is always a dicey\n&gt; &gt; proposition, because it can all too easily become tunneling.

To not break it would require treating the encapsulated\nmessage as transparent rather than opaque, and doing stuff like\nstripping the Connection header on the first hop (etc.., etc..,\netc..)\n\n&gt; I was trying to find some way for client initiated exchanges to have\n&gt; requests flow from server to client. This helps enable peer to peer between\n&gt; two firewalled nodes - with the assistance of a middleman.\n\nWell, with WATCH, you&#39;re doing that, but I guess you mean that you want\nthem coming back on the same connection.\n\n&gt; For software behind a firewall, how would you suggest we maintain\n&gt; RESTfullness if we attempt client initiated messaging?\n&gt; Especially if you want to maintain existing programming models.\n\nUse GET and a persistent connection rather than WATCH.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
