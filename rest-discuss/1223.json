I think the example you \nused was a travel site where your itinerary and ticket were resources \nwith URIs so you could return to them and take subsequent actions.\n\nHow far do you think this idea could be pushed?\nWhat are the drawbacks?\nCould it eliminate cookies and other session-management kludges?\nI&#39;m also thinking of &quot;conversation ID&quot; and other tags in message-\noriented SOAP that are addressed to hidden resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
