NB:  we should\nprobably work on making terminology consistent with the general\nmetaphors, roles, and activities of pub / sub.\n\n----\n\nSubscription lifetimes are problematic.  They shouldn&#39;t last forever;\ndoing so places an undue and unnecessary burden on the resource in\nquestion.  The server for a subscribable resource (Publisher?) should be\nable to indicate when a subscription expires, and should provide a\nmechanism by which the subscriber can renew the subscription.  (Note\nthat this is an *extremely* useful concept in modeling presence, for\nexample.  It&#39;s also simply a good idea rom a robustness and scalability\nperspective.)\n\nSuggested solution:  when a Subscriber (client) obtains a subscription\nvia the URI indicated in the &quot;Subscription&quot; header, the response SHOULD\ncontain a header &quot;Expiration&quot; which indicates when the subscription\nexpires.  If an Expiration is indicated, the Subscriber MUST &quot;renew&quot; the\nsubscription at some point before the Expiration date in some fashion.\n(How?  Presumably via a POST of some sort to the particular\nsubscription&#39;s Location: URI?)  If a Subscriber fails to renew a\nsubscription by the indicated expiration, the server MAY at any\nsubsequent point remove the subscription resource and stop sending\nnotifications to the Subscriber.\n\n----\n\nThe mechanism Paul describes is potentially very dangerous;  it needs a\nkind of authentication beyond simple principal / session\nauthentication.  Consider:  Mallory wants to DoS Alice.  To do so,\nMallory subscribes to Bob, but gives Alice&#39;s URI to Bob as the\nSubscriber / EventTarget.  Even if Bob authenticates Mallory --- indeed,\neven if Mallory is a valid user from Bob&#39;s perspective --- that still\ndoesn&#39;t prevent Mallory from using Bob to attack Alice.  Somehow, the\n&quot;client&quot; that requests a subscription needs to be verifiably the &quot;same&quot;\nin some sense as the Subscriber / EventTarget.\n\nSuggested solution:  the response to the Subscription POST SHOULD\ncontain a SubscriptionID header with some arbitrary token.  The\nSubscriber MUST return this header in the responses to all notifications\nPOSTED by the Publisher (server) to the Subscriber URI.  The Publisher\nMAY delete any subscription and cease notifications for any Subscriber\nthat fails to return the appropriate SubscriptionID in the response to\nany notification.\n\n----\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
