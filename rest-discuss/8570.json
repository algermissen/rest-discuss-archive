More\n&gt; dangerously, it assumes that the resource can immediately start a\n&gt; synchronous state transition, which may or may not be the case.\n\n&quot;more dangerously&quot;... well if it couldn&#39;t you&#39;d clearly have to code\nfor that wouldn&#39;t you?\n\nAll I&#39;m saying is that this sort of thing is possible with RESTfull\nsystems and not even that complicated. \n\nThe client asks the resource to set it&#39;s status to &quot;on&quot;... presumably\nthe resource can recieve that message and can start to reflect that\nfact, at least, that the transition has been requested.\n\n\n&gt; In long-haul comms, when you put something into a state it begins an\n&gt; async operation to enter that state, then either enters it or fails.\n&gt; You can queue up state change requests if that is what you want.\n\nThat&#39;s all we have here I think, unless I am missing something. The\nstate reflected in the select could be &quot;switching to on&quot; for as long\nas it takes to confirm the next state (or whatever).\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
