Mark]\n\nhello mike.\n\nOn 2011-06-14 9:17 , Mike Kelly wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve now produced an initial draft of a spec for a minimalist, generic\n&gt; media type. Love to get some feedback + pointers on this\n\nthis looks very interesting! it has many similarities to something rosa \nalarcon and i worked on that we called the &quot;Resource Linking Language \n(ReLL)&quot;, which probably had pretty much the same starting point. \nhowever, one important difference may be that we see ReLL mostly as a \ndescription language (even though we usually don&#39;t say that because this \nis a seriously bad word in RESTful circles) that allows clients to \ntraverse across an interlinked set of resources, extracting links from \nthem through media-type specific selection languages (mostly XPath for \nXML right now), and understanding those links based on link semantics \ndefined in ReLL. the main idea behind ReLL is that you can produce a \nReLL description of a set of interlinked resources without any need to \nchange them, so clients can start using ReLL without server/publishers \neven knowing about it. we used that capability when we described web \npages via ReLL, and than had a ReLL-steered crawler harvesting RDF from \nthose pages, directed only by the declarative ReLL overlay on top of the \nweb pages.\n\nwe are still working on ReLL and unfortunately, there is no recent \npublication (or let alone a specification) we could point you to, but \nhttp://dret.net/netdret/publications#ala10a and \nhttp://dret.net/netdret/publications#ala10c should be sufficient to \nprovide an overview of our approach and our language.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n--\n\nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-6432253 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
