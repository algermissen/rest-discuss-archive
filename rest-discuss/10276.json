And there are a lot of\n&gt; &gt; different opportunities, it can be written in human form,\n&gt; &gt; have a visual notation, have a bunch of machine processable\n&gt; &gt; syntaxes, etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I fear that every discussion directed towards this goal\n&gt; &gt; starts out by bikeshedding the choice of language.  Picking a\n&gt; &gt; language upfront you run the risk of getting bogged down in\n&gt; &gt; the implementation details: can I represent this RDF as JSON?\n&gt; &gt; elements or attributes? inheritence or composition?  Good\n&gt; &gt; intentions that end up leading to an almost good enough\n&gt; &gt; solution due to the inability to choose a color.  Some WS-*\n&gt; &gt; specs are a good example for that, solving the problem in\n&gt; &gt; whichever way the XML syntax makes easy or elegant looking.\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s not go there again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If we can figure out the best practices for what you intend\n&gt; &gt; to describe, it then becomes easier to come up with different\n&gt; &gt; styles for expressing it, and avoid the language turf wars.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m with you there, as I said to John in a prior email.  I think the HTML5\n&gt; WG came up with a brilliant solution for a similar problem, i.e. that of\n&gt; defining HTML5 as an abstract DOM and then defining different serializations\n&gt; for it.  Similarly I think we might want to consider focusing on defining a\n&gt; SOM (Service Object Model) and only later worry about the exact\n&gt; serializations of it. Does that not work with what you were saying?\n\nGo a step backward into the HTML5 conceptual model:\n1.  Forms should support all HTML verbs.\n2.  Elements for specific content types like audio and video.\n3.  Should be possible to break document into sections.\nAnd so forth.\n\nThose are the things we need to decide on first, before we even get to\ncreate an abstract model.  We might even have several abstract models,\nmaybe one is optimized for tooling and another for people, one for\nstatic languages another for dynamic languages.  Each abstract model\ncan have different serializations.\n\nXML Schema allows you to specify the structure of a document.  It has\nan abstract model, from which you get XML serialization, Java API, RDF\nrepresentation, etc.  RelaxNG is also a language that allows you to\nspecify the structure of the document.  Turns out there are some\nthings you can say in XML Schema but not in RelaxNG and vice versa.\nTheir abstract models are not identical, we can&#39;t say one is a\nserialization of the other.  But they both have a similar enough\nconceptual model that, if I need to describe a given service, I can\nchoose either one (or both).\n\nDocBook allows you to specify the structure of a document.  You can\nlist sections in a particular order, and you can group sections into\nlarger sections.  But that&#39;s a fundamentally different conceptual\nmodel than XML Schema or RelaxNG.  For one, XML Schema is separate\nfrom the document it describes, DocBook is self-describing; for\nanother, XML Schema is good at describing which address fields are\nmandatory in a purchase order, DocBook not so.\n\nFrom what I&#39;m hearing, some people expect the description language to\nbe an XML Schema/RelaxNG of sort, while others expect it to be\nDocBook.  That&#39;s the first thing we need to nail, the conceptual\nmodel.  There are obviously more details to it, more points of\ncontention, I&#39;m just using this as example.\n\nAssaf\n\n"}}
