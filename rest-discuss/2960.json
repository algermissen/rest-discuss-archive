Does such a thing even make sense?\n\ni haven&#39;t found a situation where it has made sense so far.  it&#39;s a\nphenomenon i have observed in practice; i&#39;ve been meaning to ask\nrest-discuss but hadn&#39;t got around to it.\n\ni think this is because most of the time when you would want to POST to\na resource that you can already PUT to (e.g. /accounts/[id]), you are\nprobably better off POSTing to a &#39;sub-resource&#39; which is a collection\ninstead (e.g. /accounts/[id]/withdrawals).  (cf. my post from yesterday.)\n\ni have used this fact to implement a browser workaround or hack.\nBecause browsers can&#39;t send PUT, e.g. as the method of a form submit, I\n&#39;pre-process&#39; the request at the server so that the POST is changed to a\nPUT.  i then continue with processing as normal.  this means I can use\nthe same code for browsers and machine clients (modulo differences\nbetween representations, but i&#39;m working on seperating that concern\ncleanly as well, and joe gregorio has already done a nice job with\nRESTlog).  it also means that i can support PUT operations using HTML\nforms, which is important for my app.\n\nwhen i saw REST first i wondered, &quot;but how the hell can REST work when\nbrowsers don&#39;t send PUT&quot;?  (using client-side XMLHttpRequest-ish objects\ndoesn&#39;t count, IMO.)  but it seems to be mostly a non-issue because you\ncan effectively overload the semantics of POST to include PUT for broken\nuser agents, depending on the URI in question.\n\n\n"}}
