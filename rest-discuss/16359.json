It doesn&#39;t magically\nmake all clients understand all those types. It&#39;s just a place where\nyou can go to find the official definition of the type. And when you\nfeel like it, you could possibly implement a proper handler for it.\n\nIn that case: Isn&#39;t the real requirement that an explanation of the\ntype should be available &#39;somewhere&#39;? And if it&#39;s not an official\nIANA type, should it not suffice if you can provide a place where\nthat definition can be retrieved? Maybe a link to the definition\nof your &#39;non standard&#39; media type could be included every time you\nsend an object with that media type?\n\nIn that case, clients would be free to examine that definition so\nthat they can start to make sense of it. For a public type, they\nwould go to the IANA site and read up on it, in your particular case\nthey go to your server and read about it.\n\nIf your client is unable to understand that definition, then offering\none of the standard types as an alternative (as mentioned by some\npeople in this thread) seems to be reasonable.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nJuergen\n\n\nOn Mon, 2010-08-23 at 02:18 -0600, Eric J.

The worst and perhaps most common\n&gt; REST advice throws these unregistered media types around like there&#39;s\n&gt; nothing amiss; this must stop because it&#39;s at odds with the style.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re tossing out a media type nobody&#39;s ever heard of in your REST\n&gt; advice, please note that your advice is intranet-specific, while the\n&gt; public Internet is (in REST) restricted to IANA-registered types.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nArchitect, MuleSoft Inc.\nhttp://mulesoft.com \n\n\n\n"}}
