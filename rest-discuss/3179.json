Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t adding a query term &quot;received-since&quot; unRESTful?\n&gt; I don&#39;t think so. But I am not bothered by constructing URIs on the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I meant &#39;modified-since&#39; - I mis-edited the paragraph before sending\n&gt; it. It is intended to represent a resource that is a list of items that have\n&gt; been modified since a certain time.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understand what you are trying to do, you have a single resource with a\n&gt; list of messages. The content of the response may change somewhere in the\n&gt; middle - e.g. the href attribute of the fifth item.\n&gt; You would like to talk to this same resource, yet receive only those\n&gt; portions (or items) that have changed since some previous response,\n&gt; indicated by either eTag or last-modified or something.\n&gt; The change to the resource isn&#39;t that a new message has arrived - you can\n&gt; use the &#39;mark and move&#39; approach to clean out the inbox for that - but that\n&gt; the storage location of attachments has changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have multiple collections of messages, then each collection of\n&gt; messages probably needs to support this &#39;list only changed items since xyz&#39;\n&gt; capability.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t help but think that using byte-range is fragile - deltas on dynamic\n&gt; content seems problematic. I&#39;d recommend a content format that is more\n&gt; suited to having the client merge updates to a list of items.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
