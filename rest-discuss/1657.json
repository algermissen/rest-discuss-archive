I&#39;ve been thinking about this problem off and on for a\nwhile (cf. Old FoRKposts, etc.) and am very much in line with your\nsuggestion.  Let me toss out a couple of additional ideas / extensions:\n\n1.  Security\n\nIt&#39;s trivially possible to achieve a MUCH higher level of security and\nauthentication / authorization with this scheme than with existing mail\nprotocols.  A simple extension suffices:  the principal who sends a mail\ncryptographically signs it;  this signature is attached both to the message\nstashed in the outbox *and* to the notification that is sent to the\nrecipient&#39;s inbox.  The fetch operation performed by the recipient to fetch\nthe message is also signed.  Both parties verify the other&#39;s identities at\nappropriate points in the process.\n\n2.  Groups / Lists / List Archives\n\nThis scheme subsumes much of the functionality of today&#39;s newsgroups,\nmailing lists, and list archives.  If you assume that multiple principals\nmay be associated with a given inbox, then that&#39;s all you need for the\nlatter;  a newsgroup is merely an inbox that&#39;s open to anybody.\n\n3.  Retractable E-mail\n\nIt is possible to regard inboxes as caches of the contents of other parties&#39;\noutbox contents.  If to be the case, it becomes possible to consider the\nability of a sender to &quot;retract&quot; a message after it has been sent.  A sender\nmay mark a message as being non-cacheable;  it stays in his outbox as the\nauthoritative copy of the message no matter how many times the recipient\nfetches it.  If the sender wishes to retract, he merely deletes it.  This of\ncourse does not prevent any recipient from saving a persistent copy, but\nwell-behaved clients should honor caching hints.\n\n4.  Principals\n\nWhile not strictly necessary for any of the things discussed above, this\n(like most collaborative communication schemes / tools) simply begs for the\ndefinition of and integration with a reified notion of principal.  If we can\ncreate a reasonable HTTP resource model for principals and their presence\ninformation, many interesting things become possible:\n\n  * Presence-enabled &quot;smart&quot; mail delivery and feedback\n  * Subsumption of IM functionality\n  * Tight end-user control over inbound communication\n\nIn general, a resource model for principals is useful in a huge variety of\ncontexts...  An application-neutral mechanism / model is something worthy of\nconsideration.\n\n5.  Lifestreams-like Information Architecture / Management Metaphor\n\nIt&#39;s already the case that many people tend to &quot;live out of their\nmailboxes,&quot; i.e., use e-mail as both storage and organizational metaphor for\nmost important information.  Lifestreams and similar systems take this\nnotion to its logical conclusion, and in the process provides a pleasantly\nsimple yet powerful metaphor for personal information management.  In\naddition, though not much has been said about this in the lit, IMO the\n&quot;addressable journal stream + views&quot; model provides a general information\narchitecture that can be used to build loosely-coupled systems of\ncommunicating agents / components.  The mail mechanism proposed above is\nvery close to something that could be used as the basis for the above.\n\nJust some thoughts, cheers...\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
