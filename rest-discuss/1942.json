Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think Roy&#39;s paper talks about this directly, but it does talk\nabout\n&gt; the critical &#39;loose coupling&#39; that URI opacity provides. The conclusion\nthat\n&gt; I make from this is that whenever two system coordinate on something which\n&gt; should be loosely coupled, then you should try to make that area of\n&gt; coordination loosely coupled as well. In the case of constructing URIs,\nthen\n&gt; I would interpret that to mean provide an explicit description of the\n&gt; construction rules.\n\nLet me make sure I have this correct.  If a browser were to use a URI as it\nwas given, then this is loose coupling.  This is due to the fact that the\nbrowser can be entirely brainless and will take whatever it gets.  The URI\nis opaque.  On the other hand, if the browser modifies the URI (by adding a\nquery, for instance), then the particular system is not as loosely coupled\nand the URI is no longer considered to be opaque.  This is because the\nbrowser and the server now have to agree on a &quot;standard&quot; modification\npractice (e.g. &quot;?&quot; plus a URL-encoded string where each field is separated\nby a &quot;&&quot; and each name is separated by it&#39;s associated value with a &quot;=&quot;),\nwhich effectively binds them together.\n\nThe more loosely coupled the system is, the more RESTlike it is (ignoring\nall other issues).\n\nIf this is the case, then does it make sense to always use POST in an html\nform, regardless of whether the actual request is idempotent (and therefore\ncould be handled with a GET) or not?  POST would treat the URI as opaque,\nwhereas the GET would not.  POST would be more loosely coupled than GET.\n\nFrankly, I agree with this view.  Quite coincidentally, I follow this this\npractice in my web applications.  The only way a URL contains a query string\nis if the server created it.  As far as the browser is concerned, the URL is\nentirely opaque.  What would people who say that POST is often misused say\nabout this? (I can already imagine...)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
