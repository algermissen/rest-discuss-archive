While I agree with it, I&#39;m wondering just how strong an axiom it\n&gt; is, and trying to find any exceptions, caveats or boundaries that might exist.\n\nI think the &quot;Do not put actions in URIs&quot; maxim is not so much about \nnouns vs. verbs, as it is about how link traversal is done in REST.\n\nIf you have a resource that links to another resource, the RESTful way \nfor this link to be traversed is for the client to fetch a \nrepresentation and then use a generic method on the contained URL.\n\nWhen the &quot;someuri?action=delete&quot; pattern is used, it typically means \nthat there is a resource at &quot;someuri&quot; that links to another resource \nthat can initiate some server-side process, such as a deletion. Having \nthe client append &quot;action=delete&quot; to &quot;someuri&quot; effectively creates a new \nform of link traversal. The client is asking the &quot;someuri&quot; resource to \ntraverse a link on the client&#39;s behalf and deliver an operation to the \ntarget resource. This is a bad thing. Providing a uniform interaction \nmodel across all applications is one of the main virtues of REST. A \nparticular application should not create unique mechanisms that replace \nuniform ones.\n\nThe &quot;verb in the request&quot; pattern is so common because it mirrors a link \ntraversal form used in OOP. In OOP, an invocation target is identified \nby a pointer and method name pair. The runtime environment implicitly \ndispatches on the method name, to determine the invocation target. \nMethod dispatch is a second form of link traversal in OOP, one that is \nalways done by the server.\n\nIn contrast, REST has only one form of link traversal, that is always \ndone by the client. Perhaps a more accurate way of stating the &quot;Do not \nput actions in URIs&quot; maxim is &quot;In REST, method dispatch happens on the \nclient side, not the server side&quot;. After all, our software doesn&#39;t know \nverbs from nouns, but must know the difference between link traversal forms.\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe web-calculus is the union of REST and capability-based security.\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
