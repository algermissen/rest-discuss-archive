For instance, suppose you have the\n&gt; following URL:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.seairth.com/time.php\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, suppose that this each time the URL is submitted, it returns the\n&gt; current time in GMT.  From what I understand, GET is ideally suppose to\nhave\n&gt; the same resource/representation returned each time it is submitted.\nActually it is supposed to be the current value of the resource - if the\nresource has changed, a new value will be sent.\n\n&gt; However, this would not be the case here.  So is GET not the appropriate\n&gt; verb to use here, or does it not matter what is returned each time?\nIf the resource is &#39;current time&#39; then it the content will always vary over\ntime. Using GET is just fine.\nIf you have a resource that is a clock and you want to re-set the time to\nsome value, then GET is not the right method.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand that GET is not supposed to change the state of the the\n&gt; resource being requested.  Suppose you had the following URL:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.seairth.com/hitcount.php\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, in this case, each time it the URL is submitted, the server\nincrements\n&gt; an internal hit counter and returns the current hit count.  In this case,\n&gt; the actual act of making the request has cause the state to change.\nShould\n&gt; GET not be used in a case like this, or is the GET request not actually\nthe\n&gt; thing which is changing the resource state?\nKind of a catch-22 sure, but the &#39;not change state&#39; constraint has to do\nwith the intent of the GET - sending a GET request in order to modify state\nand as the documented mechanism for that resource is what should be avoided.\n\nThe hit-counter problem is a fuzzy area of the &#39;GET is safe and idempotent&#39;\nrequirement, but I don&#39;t think the requirement is so constraining that\nhit-counters are not allowed. I believe a resource can be defined in terms\nof the history of that resource and not just some static data values\nsomewhere.\n\n\n"}}
