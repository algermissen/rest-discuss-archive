It has scaled pretty well. Has\n&gt; a constrained interface. Has a strong infrastrutre base of tools. Is\n&gt; representation oriented and media-type aware. Pretty ubiquitous.\n\nI think someone picked up on that a while ago [*] (although it probably \ndoesn&#39;t quite match all your requirements.)\n\nPerhaps something could be done on this basis.\n\nThe Subject line could be the first line (say &quot;GET /...&quot; or &quot;HTTP/1.1 \n200 ...&quot;). The other headers could be added to the e-mail headers, \nperhaps prefixed (say &quot;X-HttpGateway-Host: &quot;, ...), and matching which \nresponse corresponds to which request could use &quot;In-Reply-To: &quot;.\n\nThat would only be for &quot;http:&quot; URIs. I suppose &quot;mailto:&quot; URIs could be \nused directly. In this case, you could just put the verb in the subject \n(since there wouldn&#39;t be a path).\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBruno.\n\n[*] http://www.faqs.org/faqs/internet-services/access-via-email/\n\n\n"}}
