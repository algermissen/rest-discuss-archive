That number is in the millions.\n\nActually, it&#39;s the number of _types_ of web-based services. Those types \n_potentially_ number in the millions, but I think we&#39;re a long way from \nthat at the moment. And many of those types are of extremely narrow \napplicability and have a correspondingly narrow constituency with \ncorrespondingly more entrenched vested interests.\n\n&gt; The number of people who &quot;agreed&quot; on the details of HTTP are in the\n&gt; hundreds. I don&#39;t see how you can plausibly argue that there is an\n&gt; O(2^N) relationship there.\n\nRight, but that&#39;s because HTTP is general purpose infrastructure, and \nthat gets you a natural split between the producers and the largely \npassive consumers. The hundreds who were involved in the process \nrepresented a significant slice of the producers of that \ninfrastructure.\n\nBut not everything is general purpose infrastructure. The closer you get \nto the domain-specific the more the biases and interests of the \nparticipants come to the fore. And that&#39;s when consensus forming is \nneeded.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
