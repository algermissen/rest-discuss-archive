I first  \nread about the term &#39;specification&#39; in the book &#39;Domain Driven  \nDesign&#39;[]1].\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://domaindrivendesign.org/books/#DDD\n\n\n\n\nOn Sep 2, 2008, at 7:41 AM, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n\n\n&gt; What do you call the concept of &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;types&quot; of resources in\n&gt; your RESTful designs?
