Hmmm.  All links are wishful thinking.\nGuessed links are just somewhat more wishful than others.\n\n&gt; These URI templates aren&#39;t URIs, clearly. They represent a family of\n&gt; related URIs: an infinite family if arbitrary substitutions into the\n&gt; template positions are acceptable; a finite family if the substutions\n&gt; should be drawn from a restricted set as in an HTML &lt;select&gt;.\n\nEr, don&#39;t think too hard about it.  All URIs are URIs -- some resources\njust don&#39;t (currently) have a representation.\n\n&gt; But they do seem like identifiers for all that, even if only virtual/\n&gt; derived and parasitic on the &quot;true&quot; identifiers which support them.\n&gt; What would support a clients expectation that substutions into,\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://example.invalid/foo?foo=$1\n&gt;\n&gt; would be likely to generate dereferencable URIs other than an \n&gt; assumption\n&gt; that the URI template effectively identifies a _process_ (or something\n&gt; equivalent) which is able to perform the inverse operation on the URI\n&gt; and extract the substitued-in value as a parameter for a computation?\n\nA hierarchical namespace typically assigns semantics to each name in\nthe hierarchy, and a well-written server-side application will\nrespond consistently to requests throughout that namespace, keeping\nin mind that &quot;not found&quot; is a consistent response if, in fact, there\nis no associated representation for that name.  It is often harder\nto interpret the same of query info because it is unordered, which\nis why developers should not hide hierarchy inside queries.\n\n&gt; I wonder if something like the above would go some way towards tweaking\n&gt; RFC 2396 3.4 in a REST-consistent direction?\n\nIt is difficult to write good descriptions for URI components given\nthat schemes frequently differ in some uses.  The descriptions in\nRFC 2396 give the intent, even though they can be misused in practice.\nI suspect that most of the spec will have to be rewritten before all\nof the authors will agree, let alone the IETF reviewers.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
