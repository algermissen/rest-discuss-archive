I would like to \nbe able to merge the two accounts, say:\n\n  http://myservice//account/1:\n\n  &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;savings&gt;100&lt;/savings&gt;\n    &lt;checking&gt;200&lt;/checking&gt;\n  &lt;/account&gt;\n\n  http://myservice//account/2:\n\n  &lt;account id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;savings&gt;50&lt;/savings&gt;\n    &lt;checking&gt;75&lt;/checking&gt;\n  &lt;/account&gt;\n\nSuch that the result is a single resource:\n\n  http://myservice/account/1:\n\n  &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;savings&gt;150&lt;/savings&gt;\n    &lt;checking&gt;275&lt;/checking&gt;\n  &lt;/account&gt;\n\nThe second account is silently deleted.\n\nWhile I could perform the updates on the client\nand post/put the new representations back to the server,\nI would not have any auditing on what actions where\nperformed against the accounts, nor that they were\ndone in a single transaction.\n\nInstead I&#39;d like to POST to some &quot;transaction&quot; resource, \nsay /merge, and create a new resource that represents\nthe transaction details\n\n  Request:\n\n  POST /merge/ HTTP/1.1\n  Host: http://myservice\n\n  &lt;accounts&gt;\n    &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;account id=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;/accounts&gt;\n\n  Response:\n\n  HTTP/1.1 204 Created\n  Location: http://myservice/merge/93914\n\nPOSTing would perform the required merge, and the \ncreated resource would be a record of the transaction.  \n\nThe only available operation on the created\nresource would be GET since it only holds the transaction\ndetails.\n \nDoes this violate principle #4 above?  What other\nsolutions would there be otherwise?\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n"}}
