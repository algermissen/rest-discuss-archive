It&#39;s entirely up to the \n&gt;server to move, remove, copy or do whatever else it fancies on the \n&gt;DELETE-ed resource as long as client can no longer GET it using the \n&gt;same URL.\n&gt;\n\nSorry, but it&#39;s REST that dictates the server&#39;s behavior.  The line in \nRFC 2616 about the server can do anything is not relevant because \nHTTP is not REST.  If I request a DELETE, then the response code from \nthat request should tell me success (2xx) or failure (4xx) to my \nrequest that the resource be removed from the server.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The semantic of DELETE is still the same in Aristotle&#39;s example: the\n&gt;resources is no longer accessible under that URL. DELETE in his\n&gt;example effectively deletes the resource identified by the URL such\n&gt;that you can&#39;t get it anymore with subsequent GET.\n&gt;\n\nYou guys may have a point, that the result of the DELETE action itself \ncan be a 30x redirect, but that can&#39;t be the _response_ to the DELETE \nrequest itself, only subsequent GET requests.\n\nThe only time the response to a DELETE request being a 30x redirect \n_might_ be valid, is to indicate to the client to re-try the DELETE on \nthat other resource, like a 30x response to a PUT request.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
