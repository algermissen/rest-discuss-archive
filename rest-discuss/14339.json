Quoting from one of Roy&#39;s posts [1]:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I should also note that the above is not yet fully RESTful, at least\n&gt; how I use the term. All I have done is described the service\n&gt; interfaces, which is no more than any RPC. In order to make it\n&gt; RESTful, I would need to add hypertext to introduce and define the\n&gt; service, describe how to perform the mapping using forms and/or link\n&gt; templates, and provide code to combine the visualizations in useful\n&gt; ways. I could even go further and define these relationships as a\n&gt; standard, much like Atom has standardized a normal set of HTTP\n&gt; relationships with expected semantics, but I have bigger fish to fry\n&gt; right now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems to me that even Roy believes standardization is a desired, but\n&gt; not mandatory, property of RESTful systems.\n&gt; \n\nMy interpretation of that post is quite different from yours.  Roy\ndescribes how to implement a sparse-bit array, as a representation of a\nstandard media type like image/gif or image/png.  The problem is, there\nis no hypertext, and the media types don&#39;t support methods other than\nGET.  The solution is to wrap these images within Atom, but Roy is\nhardly going to spend the time working on someone else&#39;s problem by\nfleshing his example out to be RESTful.\n\nI see no support for your statement that Roy doesn&#39;t see\nstandardization as mandatory, since the gist of his entire solution is\nto use standard media types and link relations which encompass the\nexpected semantics of HTTP methods.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
