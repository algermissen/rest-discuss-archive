At =\r\nthe end of the day, if you have identified a version, you will still need t=\r\no write specific code to handle it. That causes redundancy the most of the =\r\ntime, and as Zachman says, redundancy drives to chaos, system&#39;s entropy.\n\nW=\r\nhen you don&#39;t need version identification simply because a new version will=\r\n not break the system, you just achieved modifiability. \nAll at all, it all=\r\n depends on what is the change that creates a new version. \n\nThanks, Mike, =\r\nyou just gave me an idea for a blog post on types of changes that require v=\r\nersioning, and how to solve them without version identification.\n\nWilliam M=\r\nartinez.\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; For me, it helps to think about versioning is a _technique_ and no=\r\nt a\n&gt; goal or system property to be attained.\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually when talking abo=\r\nut &quot;versioning&quot; we are really trying to deal\n&gt; with the issue of modifiabil=\r\nity at the system (arch) level. Fielding&#39;s\n&gt; dissertation does a good job o=\r\nf identifying &quot;System Properties of Key\n&gt; Interest&quot;[1] and one section deal=\r\ns with Modifiability[2] in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once I started thinking about vers=\r\nioning in this way, I was able to\n&gt; look to other techniques to improve the=\r\n general modifiability of an\n&gt; implementation. And sometimes these other te=\r\nchniques (identified in\n&gt; 2.3.4) made the use of versioning superfluous.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; [1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#=\r\nsec_2_3\n&gt; [2] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_ar=\r\nch.htm#sec_2_3_4\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://twitter.com@=\r\nmamund\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #RESTFest 2010\n&gt; http://rest=\r\n-fest.googlecode.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
