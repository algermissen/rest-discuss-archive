Sometimes they aren&#39;t even setable by the client.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; If you have flags other than some kind of =93active/not active=94\n&gt; stat=\r\nus, probably by exposing them as separate resources for the\n&gt; client to PUT=\r\n to, when it is allowed to.\n&gt;\nThat would be: I have a resource &quot;budget&quot;, an=\r\nd to &quot;approve&quot; it I send  \nits representation via PUT to /budgets/approved/=\r\n{id}, where the ID is  \nthe one of the original resource?\n\nWouldn&#39;t be a RE=\r\nSTful way to express this RPC-style action\n\n   Set the approved flag of bud=\r\nget with URL foo to &quot;approved&quot;\n\n? That is you pass the URL, not the represe=\r\nntation.\n&gt; And remember that the server does not need to store a bit-for-bi=\r\nt\n&gt; copy of what the client sends in PUT. If the server includes\n&gt; those fl=\r\nags in the representation it returns on GET, that doesn=92t\n&gt; mean clients =\r\nhave to be able to change them. If the client\n&gt; includes them in a PUT the =\r\nserver can simply pretend they weren=92t\n&gt; there or 400 the request or do w=\r\nhatever.\n&gt;\nYeah thank you.\n\nMy question in that regard was more having to d=\r\no with the possibility  \nof dealing with &quot;cancelled&quot; as a non-distinguished=\r\n attribute. In that  \ncase you&#39;d use a PUT request to its URL with the enti=\r\nre representation  \nand the service would have separate logic when that par=\r\nticular  \nattribute changed. That smells like a wrong approach to me for  \n=\r\nattributes like these ones which are kind of metadata so to speak.\n\n-- fxn\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
