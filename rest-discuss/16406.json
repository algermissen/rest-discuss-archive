Suppose the application is to index a bunch of web sites then the intended server side component type is something like &#39;any&#39;.\n\nIt is, I think, also reasonable to ask whether there is some sort of primary application for a given server component that defines its type.\n\nReactions to this brain dump are most welcome...\n\nJan\n\n"}}
