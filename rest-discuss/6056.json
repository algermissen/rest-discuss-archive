I have explained these as the &#39;subject&#39; and the\n&gt; &#39;object&#39;. REST states that the &#39;resource&#39; (the object) is the  \n&gt; &#39;semantic\n&gt; thing&#39; which a URL describes (which is true), but then it says that\n&gt; state representations of the resource are generated for a request  \n&gt; (which\n&gt; I contend). It&#39;s superficial (in my view) to say that the response\n&gt; entity is a representation of the state of the resource because this\n&gt; other thing, the &#39;subject&#39;, can modify response semantics. I.e. a\n&gt; response isn&#39;t just for,\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET /resource\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s for either,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Someone GETs /resource\n&gt;\n&gt; Or,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Joe GETs /resource\n&gt;\n&gt; In each case, the overall semantics of the request (and the\n&gt; representation generated) may be varied by this additional context.  \n&gt; The\n&gt; simplest case in point being that we put &quot;Good Morning %Username%&quot; at\n&gt; the top of every page. So it&#39;s not just a representation of the  \n&gt; state of\n&gt; a resource. It&#39;s the representation of the state of the resource at a\n&gt; point in time *with respect to a user&#39;s session*.\n&gt;\nAh, perhaps I finally see what you&#39;ve been trying to say, and I  \nbelieve I recently brought up the same issue, though in a different  \nway. If you look back in the archives there&#39;s a thread I started  \ncalled &quot;Personalization as Representation&quot; that explores this issue.  \nMy question to this list was whether a personalized instance of a  \nresource should be considered a representation of that resource. I  \neven used the welcome message as an example of a personalization of a  \nresource.\n\nAlthough the responses I got back on this list tended to fight me on  \nthis notion of viewing personalization as representation, I concluded  \nnevertheless that it is a useful way to think about personalization,  \nbut to maximize cache-ability I should minimize the number of  \npersonalized representations (which minimizes the number of ETags for  \npersonalization). The main technique is to do that minimization is to  \nuse JavaScript to go back and grab personalized pieces, and that&#39;s  \nwhat I currently plan to do for the welcome message. If the client  \ndoes not have JavaScript enabled, they will get a generic welcome  \nmessage. But I do want clients to know they&#39;ve signed in, even if  \nJavaScript is not enabled on the client. So for each page I currently  \nplan to have two personalized representations: one for when your  \nsigned in, and one for when your signed out. If you have JavaScript  \nenabled on the client, some JavaScript will replace the generic  \nwelcome with a more friendly welcome that includes your name.\n\n&gt;&gt; What it showed me was that a good way to think about designing web\n&gt;&gt; applications is &quot;resource-oriented design,&quot; to give it a name. In\n&gt;&gt; designing a C++ program, I might ask myself, &#39;What are the objects?&#39;.\n&gt;&gt; In designing a web application, I would ask myself, &#39;What are the\n&gt;&gt; resources?&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your case, what you&#39;re trying to do is get a shopping basket\n&gt; resource. But this isn&#39;t such a thing:\n&gt;\n&gt;   /basket?z=9sdf23kj5has\n&gt;\n&gt; This is:\n&gt;\n&gt;   /basket?o=(P23,1,US$3)&o=(p42,3,US$7)\n&gt;\n&gt; The latter is the resource that you probably want if you want to be a\n&gt; REST officiando. The resource that you propose conflates an estranged\n&gt; notion of &#39;session key&#39; with some semi-immutable transient server side\n&gt; state.\n&gt;\nBoth URIs reference a shopping basket resource. The second one  \ndoesn&#39;t require a snapshot of conversational state, the first one  \ndoes. The first one is also a reasonable-length URI, so I would  \nprefer it if I can be sure that people only are going to put a small  \nnumber of items in their shopping cart. As I mentioned earlier, the  \ntrouble is that sometimes, storing conversational state on the server  \nis the best design choice, for several reasons. One of them is that  \nthe URI can get too long using the approach your suggesting here.  \nPointing out one example in which storing conversational state in the  \nURI is a better design choice does not in any way prove that one  \nshould never store conversational state on the server. Moreover, I&#39;m  \nnot saying you should always and only store conversational state on  \nthe server in snapshots, just that in situations in which you do want  \nto store such state on the server, an alternative to sessions is  \nsnapshots.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
