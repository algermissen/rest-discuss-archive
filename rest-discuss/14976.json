We end up doing the\n&gt;&gt; same thing that everyone else does, which is to use journaling\n&gt;&gt; of orders and either compensating transactions or strict\n&gt;&gt; separation of inventory between sites (with periodic rebalancing\n&gt;&gt; of inventory as stocks decrease).\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t think notifications would work?  Or do you think of them as\n&gt; compensating transactions?\n\nMessage (distributed) notifications or database notifications?\nThey might work -- it depends on how fast the orders are being\nprocessed and how reliable the delivery.  Notification-based\nsystems tend to fail spectacularly at peak times, and are\nusually overkill during non-peak times.   *shrug*  There&#39;s a\ngood chance that you could build a good enough system for family\nfarms using nothing more than email.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking, by the way, that one resource gets nominated by the\n&gt; farmer as their inventory resource, and the other markets just display\n&gt; a representation and then send an update to the inventory resource,\n&gt; which could respond with an over-order notice.\n\nI thought the sites were independent.  Yes, a single inventory\nresource accessed by both sites should be fine as long as the\nstate changing requests are queued by the implementation.\nThe implementation of that resource could even be an atomic\ntest+decrement.  But how are you going to teach the markets\nto use such a resource?\n\n&gt;&gt;  I think the farmer could\n&gt;&gt; be provided with a RESTful application for tracking and\n&gt;&gt; rebalancing inventory across multiple sites, but I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; call that a RESTful solution to the inventory problem itself.\n&gt;&gt; It just works well enough to keep the farmer happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well enough&quot; is all I need.  Farming is like that, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; But all the separation and rebalancing would have to happen\n&gt; automatically, without farmer involvement.  So one inventory resource\n&gt; consumed by multiple markets is an attractive idea, if it can work.\n\nYes, if you can make the markets use a shared resource that\nis much easier.  If not, then it should also be possible to\nautomate a balancer even if the farmer&#39;s interface to the\nmarkets is two different web pages.   You could then provide\nthe farmer with mash-up interface that treats the markets as\ngateways.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
