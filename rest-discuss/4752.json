to produce a real REST app -- because there\n&gt; &gt; is no mechanism available for resources to communicate...\n\n Jan Algermissen &lt;jalgermissen@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Maybe rephrase your question, I feel I am missing something.\n\n     perhaps I&#39;m giving the REpresentational State Transfer theory\ntoo much credit -- the &quot;current&quot; http-server/http-client model for\ndoing a &quot;GET&quot; -- follow links, or fill out a form,  &quot;POST&quot;, the\nserver \ngenerates a new page...the &quot;application&quot; flows along (blah, blah...)\n\n    but my impression (and this is where I could be giving the whole\nidea too much credit) is that the concept behind the REST model is \nadvance web technology by building network  &quot;resources&quot; that can\nbe used ((and re-used), and linked together) to form distributed\nclient \napplications.\n\n    Debating the finer points of human-readable formats versus binary\nAPI&#39;s, or the semantic difference in RFC2616 between a http PUT and\na POST does not effect people looking to build something truely new.\n\n    I can see some benefit to breaking a web applications into\nresource manipulations -- you&#39;re buying a new iPod on a \ncommerce-site, and it wants a mailing address -- so your \nclient queries your network address-book resource (say,\nhttp://addresses.yahoo.com/ ) and ships the appropriate\ninformation to the shipping-address resource on the commerce \nsite.\n\n    I don&#39;t see how you can make a web-browser talk to distributed\nresources (especially when part of the power of the internet is \nthat *I* may use address.yahoo.com, you may use your .mac address\nbook -- someone else may have their own apache server at home \nto provide that resource.)\n\n    build me a distributed set of resources (and a client-application\nthat can query/integrate the results from each)   -- and then you&#39;re \non to something...I want to send a book to my dad, so I type in part\nof the title -- ship that to a search-resource on Amazon, \nget the ISBN number, query my address-book for my dad&#39;s mailing\naddress...push that to the Barnes and Noble web-site order \nresource...plug in my credit card number and BOOM \n-- sale pending.\n\n    --erik\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n"}}
