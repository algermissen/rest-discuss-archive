I would like to see a design example for an e-commerce site \nor banking app.  How would the URLs be encoded?  How would a shopping \ncart be implemented?  A login page?  What are the HTTP requests \ninvolved, if you want to do it the REST way?\n\nFielding uses the term &quot;session state,&quot; which is fuzzy.  He says &quot;each \nrequest from client to server must contain all of the information \nnecessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any \nstored context on the server.&quot;  But what does &quot;understanding the \nrequest&quot; mean?  What is &quot;stored context&quot;?\n\nCouldn&#39;t any data on the server be considered &quot;stored context&quot;?  If we \nshouldn&#39;t have any state on the server, it doesn&#39;t even have, say, a \nlist of books available for purchase.  Because that&#39;s state.  It should \njust have a purely functional algorithm, like a mathematical formula.  I \ndon&#39;t think that&#39;s what Fielding meant, but he doesn&#39;t show where to \ndraw the line.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
