Try to view yourself as a machine client and the human targetted links as part of some some online shopping specific media type. Consider Amazon&#39;s home page as the service document that tells you where search is, where to browse categories, etc.\n\nBasically, it is all about the media types (and link relations of you use those) you define for your domain. Look at AtomPub service documents which is about the best you can find at the moment.\n\nYou can also go and read some stuff I wrote on service documents[1][2]. But I suggest you take a look at the other stuff first.\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?p=80\n[2] http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?cat=13\n\n\n\n\nOn Mar 25, 2010, at 12:34 AM, Kevin Duffey wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think I&#39;ve done this before,  but I am working on a service now and want to make sure I am doing it &quot;as right&#39; as it could be to remain a true REST based API. If this should be under a different thread, that is fine, I just figured it&#39;s along the discussion we&#39;re having here now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, I have this service that I provide a single URL http://www.mycompany.com/service\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought that a OPTIONS should be requested before anything else? A GET could be used too I suppose, but basically am I understanding correctly that with this single URL, the right call to discover the services that can then be acted on is to send OPTIONS? If not, what is the &quot;right way&quot; a client should make the first call to the initial published URL?\n&gt; \n&gt; In response, I hope I am right in understanding that zero or more services should be returned. How exactly I am still at a loss due to this thread... but how I have my service right now is like such:\n&gt; \n&gt; OPTIONS /service\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;service&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;links&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;link rel=&quot;resource1&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mycompany.com/resource1&quot; type=&quot;application/vnd.com.mycompany.resource1+xml&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;link rel=&quot;resource2&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mycompany.com/resource2&quot; type=&quot;application/vnc.com.mycompany.resource2+xml&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/links&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/service&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite what this thread has talked about, I am  not quite sure what to respond with.. which is why the above is what I assumed was ok. Short of knowing prior to the call to the published URL what services are available... I figured this gave back a discoverable list of links that a client can use. Is this correct... if not, please explain what should come back from the published URL. I am also still trying to figure out, from various posts here and other threads, how do you &quot;discover&quot; the media type to set the Content-Type to for specific resources if they don&#39;t provide a type=&quot;&quot; in the links that are in the response.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, assuming my above response is not too far off... a client can then use any of those service URLs to, according to Jan I believe post/put/get/delete/head/options to. This is where I was arguing that it would be beneficial to avoid multiple round trips if the above returned with specific methods allowed on a given resource. Regardless of the outcome of that argument, for the sake of this we&#39;ll assume that with any resource returned, ALL method types can at be called on it, naturally, with some possibly returning responses that that require yet another call to the server with a different request method. Generally speaking, the initial URL resources should be to a collection, and thus a GET call can pull ALL /resource1 types, a POST to it can create a new one, and a PUT to /resource1/&lt;item&gt; can update an existing one if it exists.. and so on. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll stop there to avoid continuing on in the wrong direction if that is wrong. I am hoping Jan/et all will provide some constructive criticism and corrections to how the initial first call to the published URL should work.. how it should respond. I&#39;d appreciate an example of XML snippet on what the response would look like if what I have above is incorrect or not RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
