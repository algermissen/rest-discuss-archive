Am I right? My main concern is scaling:\n&gt; will this scale? I need to have the ability to horizontally scale each\n&gt; of these seperate services by simply adding another node. \n\nScaling across servers with a single namespace can be achieved by\nhaving a load balancer distribute requests to appropriate servers\nbased on some uri-&gt;server mapping. This is one of the advantages of\nREST, or at least a RESTful approach to URLs. By exposing the data\nmodel in URIs it&#39;s possible to abstract the handling of that data\nmodel.\n\nTo give you a specific example of this you could use mod_rewrite to\nload balance between 2 servers A and B such that:\n\n  POST customer.ben.com/nic.ferrier/purchase-history/\n\nwent to server A and\n\n  POST customer.ben.com/caroline.ferrier/purchase-history/\n\nwent to server B.\n\nBecause the data model is (at least partially) in the URI it&#39;s trivial\nto parse and hand off elsewehere.\n\nSo, in terms of scale I can answer your question. Your system would\nbe massively scalable.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought that maybe replacing the overall user-group SERVICE with\n&gt; specific user-groups based on specific service types, for example\n&gt; LIB-SERVICE, CUSTOMER-SERVICE and SHOP-SERVICE, thus allowing me to\n&gt; give each node a seperate username and password.This would allow me to\n&gt; track which specific node connected and performed the transaction.\n\nCould you not do that by the client IP?\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
