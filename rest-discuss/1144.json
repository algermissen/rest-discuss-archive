The criteria with which one evaluates a\ndistributed architecture is *entirely* different than the criteria\nwith which a software program is evaluated.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not convinced that REST&#39;s reliance on HTTP primitives  \n\nIsn&#39;t that the other way around? 8-)\n\n&gt; necessarily restricts flexibility of function.
