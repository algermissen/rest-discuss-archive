For\n&gt; instance an issue cannot be reopened if it isn&#39;t resolved or\n&gt; closed. Furthermore, let&#39;s say I have a resolved issue but I&#39;m\n&gt; conducting a PUT with state = &quot;Open&quot;.\n\nThen the server should return 409, since trying to PUT the status\nOpen to the bug conflicts with the current state of the resource.\nThat is a textbook application of 409, in fact.\n\n\n* erlingwl &lt;erlingwl@...&gt; [2008-05-05 11:45]:\n&gt; Okay, but doesn&#39;t this break with the REST Server-side\n&gt; statelessness principle? Hmm.. I thought maybe that\n&gt; incrementing state would be just as wrong as incrementing a\n&gt; value.. but as you say, the client do know the state, and it\n&gt; sends the new state with the PUT.. \n\nThe statelessness issue is highly misunderstood. The server\nobviously *has* to keep state *somehow*, no? Otherwise, how could\nit ever store the content of a PUT?\n\nNo, what statelessness means is that the server should not keep\ntrack of what the client has done in previous requests\nimplicitly. State on the server should be resource state, ie.\nexposed through a resource available under a URI and manipulated\nby the client explicitly via the verbs other than GET. Client\nstate, or application state in REST lingo, remains on the client.\n\nRemember that REST means Representational State Transfer? That is\nexactly what that term means: the server affects the application\nstate on the client by sending a representations of a resource,\nand likewise the client affects resource state on the server by\nsending a representation of a resource.\n\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
