If you really want Push, then you\n=\r\nshould stick to using XMPP, imho. XMPP is a very well tested , well\nused pr=\r\notocol around the world. I don&#39;t think that doing Push and REST\nis a nice i=\r\ndea.\n\nBut I personally would recommend you to think about your problem more=\r\n\nand think up ways to do it without Push, but just by using a Pull\napproach=\r\n.\n\nFrom Roy&#39;s post\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidd=\r\nen-dragons\n&quot;People need to understand that general-purpose PubSub is not a\n=\r\nsolution to scalability problems =97 it simply moves the problem\nsomewhere =\r\nelse, and usually to a place that is inversely supported by\nthe economics.\n=\r\n... Web architects must understand that resources are just consistent\nmappi=\r\nngs from an identifier to some set of views on server-side state.\nIf one vi=\r\new doesn&#39;t suit your needs, then feel free to create a\ndifferent resource t=\r\nhat provides a better view (for any definition of\n&quot;better&quot;).\n&quot;\n(if you have=\r\nn&#39;t read the whole post already, you really should )\n\n\n\nMy 2c, imho\n\n\nThank=\r\ns\nDevdatta\n\n2008/9/11 Andreas Heck &lt;aheck@...&gt;:\n&gt; Am Donnerstag, den 11.=\r\n09.2008, 07:12 +1200 schrieb Berend de Boer:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Andreas&quot; =3D=3D An=\r\ndreas Heck &lt;aheck@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Andreas&gt; I can&#39;t decide if this is =\r\nRESTful and doesn&#39;t violate HTTPs\n&gt;&gt; Andreas&gt; GET semantics.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It defin=\r\nitively doesn&#39;t scale. Why do you want to keep the connection\n&gt;&gt; open? And =\r\nwhy is polling such a problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Polling is a problem because most of the=\r\n clients will be mobile devices\n&gt; and constant polling would drain the batt=\r\nery in a very short time.\n&gt;\n&gt; The web service will be implemented in Java a=\r\nnd run in Tomcat on top of\n&gt; Linux. So it will use threads instead of proce=\r\nsses and in theory it\n&gt; should scale better than an Apache that is configur=\r\ned to use only\n&gt; processes for concurrency. Does someone know what&#39;s the co=\r\nnnection\n&gt; overhead for the OS and how Java/Tomcat scale under such conditi=\r\nons?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andreas\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
