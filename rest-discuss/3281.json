This sounds appealing,\nbut I have not seen a document specifying the\nconventions necessary to achieve this.\n\nQuestions that I think need to be answered:\n1. How do you know what MIME-types one may POST or\nPUT to a given resource?\n\nMy proposal is that servers return accept-POST and\naccept-PUT headers in response to GET requests,\nhowever these headers are not actually defined\nin any standard so perhaps there is another\napproach.  An issue with this approach is that it\nimplies that it is incorrect to have a resource\nto which one is permitted to POST but not GET.\nso...\n\n2. Is it permitted to have a resource that exposes\nPOST but not GET?\n\n3. What is the correct RESTful response to a POST\nor PUT?\n\nMy feeling is that if one returns a 200 OK, one\nshould return the result of a GET to that\nresource.  Otherwise return 204, or 201 or 303\nwith the relevant URLs.  Is that correct?\n\n4. How does one achieve transactional semantics\nwith REST?\n\nPerhaps this is entirely application level.\nCreate a transaction URL and POST commit to it\nwhen complete.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
