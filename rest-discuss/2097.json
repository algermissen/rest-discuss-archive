If you look at RFC 2616 section\n9.5 [1], you will see no mention of canonically-encoded name-value pairs as\nthe only type of entity supported.  The type is determined by Content-Type.\nMost importantly, however, you will notice that the RFC defines POST as\nbeing used to:\n\n    &quot;...request that the origin server accept the entity\n     enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the\n     resource identified by the Request-URI in the\n     Request-Line&quot;\n\nThis is a key feature of the REST style.  POSTing to a subordinate of a\nknown resource is an important feature, because it allows you to POST a\nrepresentation without knowing what the resource at the origin server will\ndo with it.\n\nIf you didn&#39;t have POST, having only GET and PUT would overcomplicate the\nprotocol.  Everyone would need to create their own way of perhaps using\nmultiple GETs to discover the URI of a subordinate resource and use PUT to\nsend their representation to it.\n\n-Philip\n\n1. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Roger L. Costello [mailto:costello@...]\nSent: Friday, August 16, 2002 9:24 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nCc: Costello,Roger L.\nSubject: [rest-discuss] No POST in an XML-based Web?\n\n\nHi Folks,\n\nMy vision of the next generation of the Web is that all HTML document\ninterchanges will be replaced by XML document interchanges.  Thus, the\nWeb evolves from an HTML-based Web to an XML-based Web.\n\nIn an XML-based Web I question the utility of the HTTP POST method.  The\nHTTP GET method allows a client to cleanly retrieve an XML document. \nThe HTTP PUT method allows the client to cleanly send an XML document to\nthe server.  The HTTP POST method, however, requires name/value pairs in\nthe payload.  A client could submit an XML document using a name/value\npair, where the value is an XML document.  However, that doesn&#39;t seem\nvery clean.  In an XML-based Web I just want to exchange XML documents. \nThe payload is clean - just an XML document.  \n\nI would like to (boldly) assert that the name/value pair style is a\nremnant of HTML and is not suitable for an XML-based world!  Thus, I\npropose that in The New Web that HTTP POST be dropped.  \n\nI know what you are thinking: &quot;Okay Roger, how do you do an update\noperation if you dump POST?&quot;  I am not sure.  Perhaps it is specified in\nthe XML document itself?  Perhaps we need a new HTTP method for doing an\nupdate using an XML document?  Thoughts?  Comments?  /Roger\n\n\nYahoo!
