For the case of simple GET, you would simply \nsupply RDFS describing your schema. For the case of PUT/POST/GET \nwith query parameters, you could invent a REST RDF vocabulary \ndescribing the accepted and returned documents. Below would be a \ndescription of a reservations service:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot; \nxmlns:rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot; \nxmlns:rest=&quot;http://hughw.net/20030524/rest-schema#&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;rest:Service \nrdf:about=&quot;http://www.bigreservations.com/service&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rest:Method&gt;POST&lt;/rest:Method&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rest:Accept rdf:type=&quot;#ReservationRequest&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rest:Response rdf:type=&quot;#ReservationResponse&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/rest:Service&gt;\n\t&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;ReservationRequest&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;ReservationResponse&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;CustomerID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;FlightID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;ReservationID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;Customer&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;#ReservationRequest&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&quot;#CustomerID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;\n\t&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;Flight&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;#ReservationRequest&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&quot;#FlightID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;\n\t&lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;Reservation&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;#ReservationResponse&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&quot;#ReservationID&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/rdf:Property&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n\nYou would have to design markup describing how to map e.g. the \nReservationResponse class to some xml schema. (Mapping Definition \nLanguage is one approach to that problem, could be overkill here).\n\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Bone &lt;jbone@d...&gt; wrote:\n...snip...\n&gt; the set of resources that are available\n&gt; i.e. the permutations of URIs that are allowed / meaningful\n&gt; the set of methods each one takes\n&gt; for POST and PUT, the formats and constraints of allowed input\n&gt; descriptions of representations / result codes returned by each \nmethod \n&gt; / input permutation per resource\n\n&gt; jb\n\n\n\n"}}
