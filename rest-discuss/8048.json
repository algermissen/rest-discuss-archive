For example, RFC 2617 (Basic and Digest)\nrequires the client to look into the path of the URIs\nbeing accessed since a client is allowed to send\ncredentials preemptively to a path deeper in the tree\nfrom a point that has already be authenticated.\nSimilarly HTML requires a client to construct URIs,\nfor example, from a form with method=&quot;GET&quot;.\nOne of the original violations of URI opacity was\na certain browser seeing .html at the end of a URI\nand assuming that the content returned was HTML,\nwhich is obviously not supported by any standard.\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
