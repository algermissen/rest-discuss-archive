Not exactly the response I was hoping for, but not a complete\nwash out :-)\n\nPossibly the greatest virtue of the Jabber protocol is that it\nimplements the truest form of &quot;push technology&quot; (that I know of) to\ndate.  One aspect of this is (and arguably its most powerful use) is\npresence management - just simply being able to subscribe to a service,\nand know when it is available (without polling) is a very valuable thing\n(for example - I could subscribe to several similar services, but know\nwhich ones are available right now, when I want to choosing one to use).\n\nThe Jabber community is allready looking at the use of http for file\nrelated transfer &quot;out of band&quot;, where by a URL is transmitted and the\nclient chooses when and how to access the data.  This lends itself very\nnicely to event notification for things like business workflow.\nAlso, the resource part of a jid can be anything, so it is a prime\ntarget for embedding http style uri&#39;s if you so desired.\n\nSo where does this leave us?  Not much further along, but perhaps I can\nconvince one or two people to have a closer look at Jabber, and I think\nwe could concentrate on how to do the bridging between XMPP (the JSF\nname of the Jabber Protocol), and the HTTP requirements of REST?\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2002 at 02:22:09PM -0800, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; Piers Harding wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Yannick - I&#39;d certainly like to get the lists opinion on this too. \n&gt; &gt;  I have ( as have others in the Jabber community ) wondered about \n&gt; &gt; Jabbers&#39; place in the REST world.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard that the hard-line REST point of view is that IM \n&gt; functionality should be rolled into HTTP (or HTTP-NG or Waka) or built \n&gt; on top of HTTP (or ...). That sounds very intolerant even to me but \n&gt; there are important principles that we&#39;re trying to encourage. A major \n&gt; one is that there should be a single address space for objects so that \n&gt; any component can talk to any other component in a unified way. By the \n&gt; way, this means that I would only support Waka if I were convinced that \n&gt; it could completely replace HTTP or work beside it so seamlessly that it \n&gt; didn&#39;t fragment the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m probably not going to convince you that most existing protocols can \n&gt; and should be collapsed into one address space and protocol and you \n&gt; aren&#39;t going to convince me that the price is acceptable for the \n&gt; advantages that the Jabber protocol (as opposed to the Jabber \n&gt; architecture and implementation).\n&gt; \n&gt; But there are certainly productives avenue of cooperation. Jabber is \n&gt; designed to go through firewalls bidirectionally and asynchronously. I \n&gt; could imagine a gateway that would allow me to access an asynch P2P \n&gt; REST-based service running on  my laptop by contacting me through a \n&gt; HTTP-&gt;Jabber-&gt;HTTP proxy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until we&#39;ve got the pieces in place to do easy bidirectional, \n&gt; cross-firewall asynch in a designed-for-REST protocol, I&#39;m certainly not \n&gt; going to say anything against Jabber. If people are building and \n&gt; installing bidirectional asynch services I think that&#39;s a good thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably HTTP could help Jabber in similar ways. Obviously there are \n&gt; already some HTTP-&gt;Jabber bridges if only for tunnelling out through \n&gt; firewalls, but I&#39;m not sure how sophisticated they are. Does anyone run \n&gt; a service that allows Jabber URIs to embed HTTP URIs so that a &quot;get&quot; on \n&gt; the URI?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
