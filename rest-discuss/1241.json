With pure\nhypertext, this can be done fairly easily - in fact MS Windows does this for\nfile system browsers - you type something in the address bar of File\nExplorer or a common file dialog and it pops up choices. (of course Unix\ncommand line file completion has been doing this for several years.) It\ndoesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to hack a web browser to do this for HTTP -\nfetch the page and show the list of anchors with href&#39;s that match (which\nwill fail miserably on the &#39;real web&#39; because everybody uses javascript...\nwhatever).\n\nThe drawback to hypertext discovery is that it is instance based. The\nresources identifiers have to already exist in order to discover them. You\ncan&#39;t talk about things outside their lifetime - before they exist or after\nthey are removed.\n\nTo program the &#39;idealized web&#39; from the kind of development environements\nthat many people like it seems that a blending of instance based and\n&#39;pattern based&#39; discovery (the generative naming JeffB talked about) would\nbe ideal for the programmer.\n\nThe popup thingee would be really useful when its too hard or you&#39;re too\nlazy to build a decent discovery system. I&#39;m not too conversant with WSDL,\nso maybe it can do a large part of this - or maybe a mix of pure URI\ndiscovery and WSDL may be useful.\n\nWhat do you think Paul?\n\n\n"}}
