You can use it as it was designed to be\n&gt; used without tricking it. Any of us could implement an HTTP-based\n&gt; notification scheme in a couple of hours.\n\nAgain, please re-read the discussion from before.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Note, if HTTP intermediaries decide to group\n&gt; &gt; chunks in awkward ways, that is not a problem with\n&gt; &gt; HTTP.  It is a problem with the intermediaries\n&gt; &gt; implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Infosar as the HTTP implementation says to treat the chunks as *one\n&gt; logical stream* it is perfectly legit for an intermediary to re-chunk\n&gt; however it wants. It also might blow away the connection when it feels\n&gt; like it has timed out.\n\nRe-chunking does not affect the protocols\nperformance (except perhaps in a good way).  If it\nblows away the connection, the client can just\nreconnect it.  This is certainly lighter weight\nand more sane than repeatedly connecting just to\nrequest subscriptions.\n\nBut, again, I refer you to the discussion of\nimplementing chat and knownow in the discussion we\nhad when I arrived.\n\nMark and Jeff, where are you on this issue?\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
