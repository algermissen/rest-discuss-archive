Mike Dierken said:\n&gt;&gt; I have to agree with you. Actually I like the idea of PUT, DELETE, etc.\n&gt;&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; implementing it is easy as GET. Maybe if all browsers have a &quot;Delete\n&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; page from the Web&quot; (or similar) button, that&#39;ll be the day when REST\n&gt;&gt; rises.\n&gt; Look beyond the legacy Web browser clients.\n\nYou can&#39;t ignore them... If everybody is touting REST as &quot;the One(tm) who\nmade Web successful&quot;, it just seems natural that it is &quot;the founding\ntechnology&quot;. That means it should&#39;ve been supported by anything BEFORE\nnow.\n\n&gt; MS Windows has &#39;Web folders&#39; - the delete key on the keyboard does an HTTP\n&gt; DELETE request.\n&gt; MS Exchange has WebDAV support - deleting info can be done via HTTP\n&gt; DELETE.\n&gt; Subversion version control uses DELETE.\n&gt; And so on...\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s already there - just invisible, like any successful technology.\n\nCool! I didn&#39;t think of that... However, aside from the fact that these\ntechnologies are &#39;new&#39; (and the fact that the underlying HTTP techology is\nvery old), they treat the Web EXACTLY like a filesystem, just like one\nmember of this group said earlier. And nobody treats the Web like a\nfilesystem, the idea is just not something like that.\n\nI don&#39;t the REST idea. I just hate that people don&#39;t think RESTfully about\nthe Web.\n\nBut any great techology has its own history. 10 years ago nobody knew what\nFlash is. Now you can force visitors to use the latest Flash 7 and nobody\nis going to complain. Maybe that can happen several years from now where\nyou won&#39;t be able to log in to your Gmail if your browser doesn&#39;t support\nREST. :-P\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
