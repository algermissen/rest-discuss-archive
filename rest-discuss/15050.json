Here&#39;s an example:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link re=\r\nl =3D &quot;royalhope.nhs.uk/linkrels/appointment/updateContactInfo&quot;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0uri =3D &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I find the link relation=\r\nship to be very specific, reducing the value\n&gt; of a uniform interface (a cl=\r\nient would need to be familiar with this\n&gt; specific rel type). In addition,=\r\n the naming of the rel type in the\n&gt; example looks suspiciously much like a=\r\nnother place to put a method\n&gt; name. I would be more comfortable with somet=\r\nhing like:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel =3D &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0type=3D&quot;vnd.contact.in=\r\nfo&quot;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0uri =3D &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But, there=\r\n some very smart people who have reviewed the article, so\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there&#39;=\r\ns a good reason for that example being that way it is.\n&gt; It would be very i=\r\nnteresting to hear your views on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; /niklas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
