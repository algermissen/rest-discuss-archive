It&#39;s cur=\r\nrently a one to one.\n&gt; We could set up the cert and check it by phone as a =\r\none off,\n&gt; then add it to the client keystore.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; At a high level I gue=\r\nss the overall view doesn&#39;t change\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but the code must change.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n I&#39;m looking for an explanation of what changes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In each case:\n&gt;&gt; 1. =\r\nthe client has a backend store of trusted certificates used by the\n&gt;&gt; HTTP =\r\nconnection mechanism\n&gt;&gt; 2. the client has a configured trust authorisation =\r\ninterface\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand this one Chris?\n\nMeaning, there is a callbac=\r\nk handler installed such that when the  \nclient asks the question &quot;do we tr=\r\nust this certificate?&quot;, someone is  \nthere to answer yes or no, whether thi=\r\ns is done by a GUI dialog,  \nvoice interaction, a Bayesian network or whate=\r\nver.\n\n&gt;&gt; 3. the client accepts the certificate\n&gt;\n&gt; Then uses it to PUT cont=\r\nent to the server I guess.\n&gt; Makes sense.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t use it to PUT content=\r\n, it just uses it to decide whether  \nit trusts the server (if not, it abor=\r\nts).\n\nYou (or your security people) may be wanting to do HTTPS client  \naut=\r\nhentication as well. (Maybe that&#39;s the point?) In that case, the  \nserver m=\r\nust have a store of valid client certificates and will refuse  \nrequests un=\r\nless the client provides a certificate in this store.\n\nIn all these cases i=\r\nt&#39;s simply a transport-level detail, like HTTP  \nauthentication. Your appli=\r\ncation code shouldn&#39;t need to change  \nproviding it uses an API at a suffic=\r\niently high level (e.g.  \njava.net.URL, Apache HTTP client, GNU inetlib).
