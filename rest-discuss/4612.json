But I&#39;ve come to learn\n&gt; that there&#39;s a very fine line - but a line nonetheless - between a\n&gt; retrieved representation which provides link metadata which presents\n&gt; cues for document exchange, and a description of a service specific\n&gt; interface (e.g. an IDL or WSDL file).  Consider this declaration;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;x:StateSetter rdf:about=&quot;http://example.org/foo/bar/&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Here, &quot;StateSetter&quot; indicates to the recipient that the identified\n&gt; resource does the semantic equivalent of PUT with a POST.  So now the\n&gt; client has a choice to make about setting the state of the resource;\n&gt; does it use PUT, or does it use POST with &quot;StateSetter&quot; as the\n&gt; mandatory expected role/type?\n\nWell, in the HTML forms case, the hypermedia is quite explicit about\nwhat operation should be used:\n\n  &lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;/foo/bar&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;methodName&quot; value=&quot;setState&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;!-- `setState` arguments...   --&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n\nOf course, the semantic provided by this particular hypermedia type\n[HTML] really doesn&#39;t allow the client to have any say in the matter,\nnor are PUT and DELETE ever used.  If the server finds it adventageous\nto do queries with POST, then who&#39;s the client to even _understand_ let\nalone complain ... that&#39;s what makes REST(dissertation) so successful.  \n\nFor some other hypermedia, it might be quite appropriate for the client\nto determine which verb to use in which situation, given only the URI\nand an ingrained knowledge of the semantics of the transfer protocol.\n\n&gt; I claim that the former is more RESTful, primarily because the latter\n&gt; exhibits less-than-RESTful visibility, telling me that at least one of\n&gt; REST&#39;s constraints that impacts visibility is being disregarded.\n\nIt&#39;s hard to say ... Roy&#39;s dissertation seems to describe one world\n[GET/POST web ca. 1999] as an implemtnation of a different world\n[document/literal exchange via a semantically rich\nuniform-operatation-set], so it&#39;s hard to say which is &quot;more&quot; RESTful. \n\nI&#39;d say the fomer better fits with what the web does regularly, while\nthe latter better fits the architectural constraints outlined.  \n\nBut they are two different things [1].\n\nI, too, would like to see more of the latter in the world. :)\n\n...jsled\n\n[1]: http://asynchronous.org/blog/archives/2004/08/25/levels_of_rest.html\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
