But I\n&gt;  keep bumping into cases where it looks like I need to alter the state\n&gt;  on  more than one resource in one hit.\n\nIn my opinion, sometimes agreed to by others on this list and\nsometimes not, what the server does behind the scenes is the server&#39;s\nbusiness.\n\nI can think of many many cases where a change to one resource will\nresult in changes to other resources, e.g. I buy something and it\nchanges the inventory resource as well as my order and kicks off a\nshipping process and charges my credit card, etc.\n\nI don&#39;t think it violates REST in any way.\n\n"}}
