If the Request-URI refers to an already\n&gt;    existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a\n&gt;    modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the\n&gt;    Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI \nis\n&gt;    capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user\n&gt;    agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. \nIf a\n&gt;    new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user \nagent\n&gt;    via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is \nmodified,\n&gt;    either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be \nsent\n&gt;    to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource\n&gt;    could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an \nappropriate\n&gt;    error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the\n&gt;    problem.\n\n\n"}}
