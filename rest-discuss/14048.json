Rickard&#39;s question is\nactually the same as my que=\r\nstion, I just tried to make it a bit more\ngeneric to avoid getting into any=\r\n CQRS discussions.\n\nI&#39;m actually come to the opinion that if the reason for=\r\n the change is\nimportant, it would probably be better to model the change i=\r\ntself and\nthe set of changes that have taken place as a resource.  So, for =\r\nthe\naddress case we&#39;d want a collection of address changes, a way to\ncreate=\r\n a new change and a representation of address changes.  Then we\ncould POST =\r\nto the collection with an address change.  The server would\ncreate the new =\r\nresource but would also cause the customer resource to\nbe updated.  Then th=\r\ne address change representation could contain as\nmuch or as little detail a=\r\nbout why the address was changed as we need.\n\nThanks,\nRich\n\n"}}
