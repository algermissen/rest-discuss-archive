Most charitably, I would refer\n&gt;you to all the people who want URL&#39;s for the\n&gt;different variants produced in\n&gt;content-negotiation.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I think that authentication is very different\n&gt;from content negotiation.  The notion that mailing\n&gt;the URL of a WSJ article means something different\n&gt;from mailing the URL of a bank savings register is\n&gt;a little odd.\n&gt;\n&gt;Using HTTP-auth for customization is abusive.\n&gt;Now, I can define all sorts of resources\n&gt;parametrized by username password.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rather than adding a id=thingid to the query\n&gt;string.  In the future, I can simply pass thingid\n&gt;in the username...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI respectfully disagree, and I&#39;ll leave it at that.\n\n--Chuck\n\n&gt;-Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________\n&gt;S.
