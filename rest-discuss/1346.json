I too agree that the OO nature of REST is quite\n&gt; interesting.  A REST component basically does all the things you&#39;d\n&gt; expect of an object; has identity, encapsulated behaviour, supports\n&gt; inheritance through a type system such as RDF.  Generic interfaces\n&gt; are also a feature of component based OO systems, such as Java Beans.\n&gt; The only thing REST doesn&#39;t do from an OO POV is hide data.\n\nIMO, the problem -w- REST v. OOP is identical to the problem which has long\nplagued me [1] -w- OOP v. generative communication ala Linda.  This is not\nto say that REST and generative communication are identical or directly\nanalogous, but IMO they bear many interesting similarities...\n\nJb\n\n[1] \nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?q=linda+oop+jguy&hl=en&lr=&selm=1220%40jethr\no.Corp.Sun.COM&rnum=1\n\n\n\n"}}
