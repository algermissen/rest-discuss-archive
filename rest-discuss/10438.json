URI as *U*I has very different\n&gt; concerns from URI as *AP*I; the former is desirable, the latter\n&gt; is anything but.\n&gt;\n\nI have discovered an interesting side-effect of a RESTful design.  I have \na digital asset management tool for which I created a simple search \nsyntax, based on Opensearch and SRU/CQL [0].  A form helps the user \n&quot;compose&quot; the URL string and parameters (although they could do it by \nhand as well) and returns the resulting set of items. Internally, the \nsearch actually creates an Atom feed that is run through some XSLT to \ncreate the results page.  With a slight change to the search request \n(adding &quot;atom&quot; to the base url), the user can see the Atom result and can, \nfor instance, subscribe to a search.\n\nI have a simple plug-in module system that other developers can use to\nbuild new search/display interfaces on top of the system. Originally,\nplugins made database requests by way of the object model & ORM. We\neventually realized that almost *every* database call can be as easily\nexpressed as an http request using our url search syntax (returning an\nAtom document which is XPath/XSLT&#39;ed into the desired xhtml). So the \n&quot;controller&quot; code need be nothing but a url fetch and a pass-off to an \nXSLT &quot;view&quot;.\n\nPerhaps this is not &quot;URL as API&quot;, but it is certainly &quot;URL search syntax\nas API (not just *UI*).  To that extent, it has been incredibly useful\nas a way to &quot;separate concerns&quot; and has had real impact on the way we\nhave been able to staff our projects.\n\n--peter keane\n\n[0] http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql-bibliographic-searching.html\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\r\n--0-2122635897-1205123729=:3845--\r\n\n"}}
