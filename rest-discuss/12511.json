HTTP applications are not=\r\n required\n  to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, thoug=\r\nh such\n  understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n =\r\n understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n  digit=\r\n, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n  x00 stat=\r\nus code of that class, with the exception that an\n  unrecognized response M=\r\nUST NOT be cached. For example, if an\n  unrecognized status code of 431 is =\r\nreceived by the client, it can\n  safely assume that there was something wro=\r\nng with its request and\n  treat the response as if it had received a 400 st=\r\natus code. In such\n  cases, user agents SHOULD present to the user the enti=\r\nty returned\n  with the response, since that entity is likely to include hum=\r\nan-\n  readable information which will explain the unusual status.\n\n\n\n______=\r\n_________________________________________\n\nMelhores cumprimentos / Beir bea=\r\nnnacht / Best regards\n\nAnt=F3nio Manuel dos Santos Mota\n\n__________________=\r\n_____________________________\n\n\n\n\n2009/4/27 harmaarts &lt;harmaarts@...&gt;=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; List,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am creating a RESTful API for my service. I have a laun=\r\nching customer\n&gt; testing the API from their perspective. Just now a develop=\r\ner of theirs ran\n&gt; into my office. He wanted to catch (4xx and 5xx) errors.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now my application can return a 403 response code for several reasons.=\r\n In\n&gt; the body of the response I have a human readable error message explai=\r\nning\n&gt; why things went awry.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem, he wants to act differ=\r\nent on different types of 403\n&gt; response codes. If only to notify the user =\r\nin different ways. My error\n&gt; message can not (always) be copied 1-to-1 to =\r\ntheir frontend.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is he to do? Match on the possible changing human =\r\nreadable error\n&gt; message? Obviously this is very brittle.\n&gt; Pass my error m=\r\nessage to their frontend? More often than not this is not\n&gt; desirable.\n&gt; Or=\r\n should I include an error identifier in the response body? So that he may\n=\r\n&gt; match on that. This introduces a fair bit of coupling which I don&#39;t like =\r\nat\n&gt; all and feels very unRESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only semi-helpful post I found w=\r\nas this one:\n&gt; http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/4009\n&gt;\n&gt; I would very much app=\r\nreciate your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; With kind regards,\n&gt; Harm\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
