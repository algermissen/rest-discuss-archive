However, I wasn&#39;t specified as such. :)\n\n\n&gt; So here&#39;s the sticky bit in interpreting this.  An HTTP URI includes an\n&gt; abs_path...  which resolves to segments, not paths...  however both\n&gt; ultimately resolve to pchars, for which &#39;@&#39; is an acceptable character.\n&gt; Here&#39;s the ambiguous bit:  tracing from\n&gt; \n&gt; abs_path -&gt; path_segments -&gt; segment -&gt; pchar, params -&gt; pchar\n\nRight. \n\n\n&gt; *it doesn&#39;t appear from the grammar defined in 3.2.2 that an authority\n&gt; component may be included.* \n\nWhoa; what makes you say that? 3.2.2 constructs the authority in,\nwith\n  host [&#39;:&#39; port ]\n\nI&#39;d note that this BNF rule isn&#39;t used anywhere in 2616. It also\nappears to be specific to protocol use; it doesn&#39;t include fragment\nidentifiers, for example.\n\n\n&gt; However, 2616 5.1.2 identifies a correctly formed Request-URI as\n&gt; being:\n&gt; \n&gt;        Request-URI    = &quot;*&quot; | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority\n&gt; \n&gt; ...which is even more mysterious, as it says you can pass an authority\n&gt; component *but only as the only component of a Request-URI?*\n\nThat&#39;s a bit weird, but I imagine it&#39;s left as a hook for future use\n(Apache doesn&#39;t seem to support it, for example).\n\n\n&gt; My conclusion is that, grammatically per RFC 2396 and 2616,\n&gt; \n&gt;         http://foo.bar.com/users/joe@...\n&gt; \n&gt; probably *should* and is probably *intended* to be a valid URI, but\n&gt; strictly speaking it&#39;s impossible to determine whether in fact it is or\n&gt; it isn&#39;t.  Comments?  Dangers of using this form of URI?  Etc.?\n\nI don&#39;t understand what your concern above is, but my reading is that\nit&#39;s allowed, as per RFC2396 Section 3.3.\n\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
