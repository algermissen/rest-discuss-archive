To me, the\n&gt; &gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\n&gt; &gt; has identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\n&gt; &gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\n&gt; &gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n&gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt;  &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want\n&gt;  &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be dragging\n&gt;  &gt; any URI into court.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed\n&gt; messages_ into courts. Let&#39;s say you have a very precise (specific) and\n&gt;   URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation.\n&gt; Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed.\n&gt; The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it\n&gt; in the database. You&#39;ll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally\n&gt; signed message with the old value.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
