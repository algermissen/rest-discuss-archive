You know -\n&#39;architecture&#39; &#39;design&#39; &#39;implementation&#39; - there is a reason that there are\nthree different words... I don&#39;t think it is a pedantic/semantic argument\neither. Other architectures (&#39;event based integration&#39;, &#39;remote procedure\ncall&#39;) do not define the details - a particular design or implementation of\nthe architecture does (there are several RPC systems that have different\nrepresentations - yet they are all recognizably &#39;rpc&#39;).\n\nAs an implementation of a large-scale system that exhibits the\ncharacteristics enumerated by REST - HTTP does define the way in which state\nis represented by the protocol: content-type, content-length, accept, etc..\nThe architecture does not constrain which representations to use, only that\nyou must use some and be clear about what representation you are using.\n\n\n\n"}}
