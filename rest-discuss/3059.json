This is what KnowNow does. In a somewhat proprietary way\n(meaning it isn&#39;t an RFC or fully header based) their system lets you &#39;get&#39;\npast and future events for a resource via a query term &#39;do_max_age&#39;. Larger\npositive numbers indicate older events - farther into the past.\n\nFor example, I wrote a sample app that polls Amazon (via their XML over HTTP\ninterface) to get popular sales items and post events to a messaging server.\nA simple client subscribes to this stream of events using a &#39;max_age&#39; to\nonly get recent events. It&#39;s an IE5+ app, but its a &#39;live events in the\nbrowser&#39; thing...\n\nhttp://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn_apps/amazonpop/\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 1.  Using HTTP/1.1 as a P2P protocol - the search for the\n&gt; Resource could take some time, so either the Response takes a minute and\n&gt; keeps the Request open (risking proxy timeout), or the line is &#39;pinged&#39;\n&gt; with void chunks while the peer is waiting. (GET\n&gt; http://p2psystem/britney32541)\nIt doesn&#39;t keep the Request open, it keeps the connection open. If a\nResponse could be sent on a separate connection, then you wouldn&#39;t risk\nproxy timeouts. Adding some way to correlate request message and response\nmessage is an increase in complexity but it pays of in increased\nfunctionality. This list discussed ways to do the correlation (and provide\ncallback location in the request, etc.) sometime in the past...\n\nI&#39;m interested in pursuing the p2p angle with pure http. I&#39;ve looked at\nGnutella & I see some obvious ways to use GET for much of the node discovery\nand searching aspects - but I&#39;m not sure what aspects of the behavior of\nGnutella are important to preserve. I need to frame these questions & ask\nLucasG/etc. on the decentralization list... sometime.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 2.  Using HTTP/1.1 as a media streaming protocol: there is\n&gt; /never/ any content length - the channel just goes on and on, sending\n&gt; chunks... (GET http://britney-radio/)\n&gt;\nYes, that would work too.\n\n&gt; Example 3.  The Resource being fetched is not a simple file, but comes\n&gt; from a user interface (GET\n&gt; http://turing-test/is-it-britney?favourite+colour)\n&gt;\nHuh?\n\n&gt; Example 4.  The Resource is a user typing into a chat field at random\n&gt; times (GET http://britney-oracle/what-she-says-now)\n&gt;\nIf the &#39;what-she-says-now&#39; has state of what she said in the past N minutes,\nthen doing a GET for a snapshot would work. But if it is a buffer that gets\ncleared out pretty fast, doing a GET would result in getting from an empty\nbuffer.\nIt&#39;s easy to model the chat session as a resource and get message. Once\nagain, see KnowNow&#39;s stuff.\n\n\n"}}
