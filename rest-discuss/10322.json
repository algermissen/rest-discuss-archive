However, I see that all the answers \nfocuses on HTTP, and since REST is a protocol-agnostic style I wonder \nhow to apply your answers to other environments.\n\nWe are going to use, for sure, at least HTTP, JMS, POP and FTP. And for \nall those I have to have Monitoring and Traceability. So I don&#39;t see how \ncan I have this without a centralized piece of software, either a ESB or \nat least some kind of Queue (ActiveMQ maybe).\n\nOr can I have some kind of &quot;hybrid&quot; solution, where instead of having \none end-point per service with the conectors needed for that service, \nand instead of one &quot;big&quot; middle end-point, I could have 4 end-points, \neach for one of the connectors needed?\n\nOr even better, can I have 3 end-points for JMS, POP and FTP, and route \nthen to a single HTTP point where all the Monitoring/Traceability will \nbe made? But then again, isn&#39;t that creating a bottleneck and a single \npoint of failure?\n\nI&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m asking stupid questions, but I do have very limited \nexperience with these kind of architecturing stuff.\n\nThanks all.\n\n\n\nSteve Loughran wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 27, 2008 9:33 PM, Antï¿½nio Mota &lt;amsmota@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:amsmota%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi again:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Friday I had a big discussion with my team, and I *almost* convince \n&gt; my team\n&gt; &gt; leader of the merits of a &quot;REST-only&quot; solution - 3) below. On the other\n&gt; &gt; hand, I think he *almost* convinced me of the merits of using a ESB...\n&gt;\n&gt; The ESB is the vision of the one, true, unified message bus, no?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have one question. After rolling it out across your company, what\n&gt; happens if you merge with another? One that also has an ESB? A\n&gt; different one?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are two features that are essential for any solution, and my \n&gt; TL said\n&gt; &gt; if a RESTfull solution could implement it than we could go for it. Those\n&gt; &gt; are:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Monitoring of all services\n&gt; &gt; - Traceability of all requests made by any client\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now the &quot;feature&quot; that concerns me about such solution, and could \n&gt; influence\n&gt; &gt; me for the ESB solution, is the kind of support I can get on public \n&gt; forums\n&gt; &gt; like this list. Although I have no doubt about the merits of this \n&gt; list, it\n&gt; &gt; is not a list devoted to &quot;implementation&quot;, as is for instance the \n&gt; Mule user\n&gt; &gt; list, that would be probably our choice for ESB.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So bear with me again, but can someone shred some light these questions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is Monitoring/Traceability achievable with a &quot;REST + decentralized,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;powerful&quot; end-points&quot; solution?\n&gt;\n&gt; -yes if you route via proxies (and the proxy has the ability to\n&gt; generate its own trusted SSL certs for intercepting HTTPS)\n&gt; -yes if you run REST over XMPP and then monitor at the XMPP server\n&gt; farm (it has to be a farm, otherwise you have a single point of\n&gt; failure for your entity)\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
