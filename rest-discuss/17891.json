In some systems I\n&gt; also support PUT for updati=\r\nng the state of resources created using the\n&gt; factory, but do not want to a=\r\nllow creating such resources with PUT. \n&gt; In such contexts, which HTTP stat=\r\nus code do you advise to return when an\n&gt; attempt is made to PUT to a reque=\r\nst URI that does not identify an already\n&gt; existing resource? In other word=\r\ns, how do you signal that creation at that\n&gt; URI with PUT isn&#39;t possible be=\r\ncause of this particular application design? \n&gt; I have often used 404, but =\r\nI&#39;m also seeing 405 or even 403 being used.\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about the collect=\r\nive wisdom of this group on this subject. \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Philippe Mougin\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
