This is a valid design choice and is entirely appropriate, when \n&gt;&gt; the message is something you need to &quot;monitor the status of&quot;.  You don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; &quot;monitor the status&quot; of a GET request by GETting another resource.  What \n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re doing is not unlike SOAP - where an HTTP POST is used to package \n&gt;&gt; up another message.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re using REST when you can, but not \n&gt;&gt; using it where it doesn&#39;t fit.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Claude&#39;s system looks exactly like a RESTful transaction API:\n&gt;\n&gt;    POST /someplace\n&gt;    =&gt; /someplace/resourcexx\n&gt;\n&gt;    GET /someplace/resourcexx\n&gt;    =&gt; state of resourcexx\n&gt;\n&gt;    PUT /someplace/resourcexx\n&gt;    =&gt; altered state of resourcexx\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why is it not RESTful?\n&gt;   \nIt is mostly RESTful.  It is fully RESTful if you are willing to think \nof an action as a resource, instead of as a verb.  But REST says actions \nare verbs, and resources are identified by URIs.  In\n\n    POST sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId\n\nthe verb is nominally POST.  But what are you really doing?  Telling a \nsensor to download something.  And that verb is in the URI.  It&#39;s like \nan RPC call, where &#39;sensorDownloadOperation&#39; is the procedure name, and \n&#39;sensorId&#39; is the parameter.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
