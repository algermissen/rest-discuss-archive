If so, that\n&gt; might be a nice first step.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nWhat I would need to feel comfortable about security with HTTP auth  \nis the ability to:\n\n1) Send a timeout from the server to the client when prompting for  \nauthentication on a particular Realm. After that timeout, the client  \nwill clear the authentication for that realm. Each time they hit the  \nsite and I send back the auth prompt, I can move the timeout forward.\n\n2) Send in a response a directive to clear the authentication at a  \nparticular realm. This allows me to have a log out button integrated  \nin the UI of the site.\n\n3) Send in the prompt a requirement that the user has to enter the  \ncredentials again, even if the authentication session hasn&#39;t expired,  \nwhich enables me to make sure the real user didn&#39;t walk away and  \nleave the browser logged in at a public terminal before I let them do  \nsomething like look at and edit their personal data.\n\nWhat I would like to be happy about personalization with HTTP auth  \nwould be the ability to:\n\n4) send a prompt to send credentials if the user already  \nauthenticated, which means that if they have already supplied  \ncredentials for the realm, to send them, else don&#39;t prompt them for  \nit and let me know they haven&#39;t done so yet.\n\nThese all would require changes to the protocol. Just having one  \nbrowser plug-in that enables a log out button by no means will be a  \nstep along a path that would eventually convince me to use HTTP auth.  \nI think there needs to be a new version of the protocol, and it needs  \nto be very widely adopted, before I&#39;ll be ready to switch.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
