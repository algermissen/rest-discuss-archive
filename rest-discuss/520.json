The application designer can use the body\n&gt; &gt; for hints that avoid GET storms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ugh.  If you are doing this, then you should allow\n&gt; notification messages to specify alternative\n&gt; servers (preemptive redirect).\n\nI may do that but it is also easy to do that at the application\nlayer...anyhow, I call it &quot;watched-URI&quot;. You call it\npreemptive-redirect. It&#39;s a URI where you can get the resource.\n\n&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;ll take it out and see if a need for it arises. My main\n&gt; &gt; concern is that while you are retrying one event you don&#39;t want to build\n&gt; &gt; up a larger and larger queue of events you are retrying for the same\n&gt; &gt; missing subscriber until you start to interfere with network\n&gt; &gt; performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the client misses notifications, that is OK.\n&gt; Why not just drop them?\n\nWhat if the notification is for an important email that just arrived?\nLate is better than never. Retry is just a MAY. If a publisher doesn&#39;t\nwant to implement it, they don&#39;t have to. Depends on the\nmission-criticality of the application.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul, this thing should be really easy to\n&gt; implement.\n&gt; The pure URI version with message dropping allowed\n&gt; means that each time a watched resource is changed\n&gt; it just iterates through a notification list\n&gt; issuing ___ requests with no content.\n\nVersus tagging each URI with &quot;Watched-URI: $uri &#92;nSubscription-URI:\n$sub_base?$uri&quot;. It&#39;s not hard either way.\n\n&gt; I think this gets you almost everything you want.\n&gt; \n&gt; Adding all sorts of negotiation seems annoying.\n\nA few flags are not a major deal. We&#39;re talking about implementing in\ntwo hours or three!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
