I\nunderstand the only way to do so is by adding the media-type somehow\nto the URIs, as in:\n\nhttp://server/myresource.xml\nhttp://server/myresource.html\nhttp://server/myresource?format=json\netc.\n\nHowever, if we define a Resource as a non-typed conceptual mapping to\na named information (as per Roy Fielding&#39;s definition\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1,\nfurther clarified in his post\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven),\nshould not the different available representations be identified using\nthe same URI? Is it not incorrect to &quot;name&quot; differently the original\nconcept the client was looking for under different URIs just because\ndifferent representations are available? Is it not more appropriate to\nuse server-driven negotiation after the specific agent-driven\nnegotiation stage has been done?  For instance, once the user agent\nreceives the list of available/acceptable representations by means of\nthe agent-driven negotiation, it selects one of them by issuing a new\nrequest under the same URI, setting the Accept header only with the\ndesired media-type, already known to be accepted by the origin server.\n\nI would really glad to hear your comments in order to get a better\nunderstanding of the spec.\n\nKind regards,\nAlejandro Nicolas Mascarell\n\n"}}
