I don&#39;t find them humiliating either (at least, that was not the intent=\r\nion). I&#39;m still surprised for the reaction. And maybe that is why many peop=\r\nle overlooked the post as not interesting, failing to start a good discussi=\r\non.\n\nAnyway, as you say, it may help someone to investigate even further of=\r\n whether what it is believing is the complete thing or not. And that is a p=\r\nlus.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n--- In rest-discuss@...=\r\nm, Erling Wegger Linde &lt;erlingwl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, I a=\r\nlso interpreted this as humorous. (Personally, I&#39;m probably\n&gt; something lik=\r\ne a &quot;loose coupling addict&quot;. )\n&gt; \n&gt; However, using humor to achieve a (seri=\r\nous) goal is a good thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I imagine one could have all sorts of &quot;so y=\r\nou think you know\n&gt; REST&quot;-checklists / personal assessment tools (you can p=\r\nrobably take this too\n&gt; far..). Having some way of giving developers feedba=\r\nck on which &quot;fan types&quot;\n&gt; they might be, could be a good thing. Let&#39;s say y=\r\nou end up as a\n&gt; &quot;URI-juggler&quot;, you might realize that you should read up o=\r\nn HATEOAS etc. And\n&gt; by using humor, it might encourage more people to do s=\r\no etc. etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Erling\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
