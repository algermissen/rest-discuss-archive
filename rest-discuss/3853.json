My point is that\nwe should not need an Atom API and a RSS API and a\nWiki API and a RNA/Notification API and a Foo API.\n\nIf servers exposed the underlying data model in a\nconsistent syntactic format, e.g. XML then the\nonly API you would need is the API for\nmanipulating that syntactic model.  The meaning of\nchanges to the model would be defined entirely by\nthe XML schema.\n\nSo, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to\nRSS2 to RNA to ...., the API shouldn&#39;t change.\nIts always be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE against XML node\nids and you know that this is the API because the\ncontent-type is text/XML!\n\nMy objection to ReST is precisely that:\n1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes\nwithout out-of-band communication\n-and-\n2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent\n*meaning* accross URI so API documentation ends up\nbeing extensive.\n\nYou have 13 pages of documentation simply to\nupdate an XML document with a well defined schema.\nYou are clearly a smart person. You should find it\nfrustrating to be spending your time writing such\na document and your should find it even more\nfrustrating to think about the number of\nprogrammers who have to spend time reading and\nunderstanding that document for your time\ninvestment to pay-off.\n\nIf we just agreed that having content-type:\ntext/xml implied the GET/PUT/POST/DELETE semantics\nagainst node ids that I described, it would save\neveryone a lot of time and would fulfill the\nsimplicity promise that people have been looking\nto ReST to deliver.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
