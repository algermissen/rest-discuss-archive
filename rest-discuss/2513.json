No?\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;quote&gt;In other words, any concept that might be the target of an \n&gt; author&#39;s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a \n&gt; resource&lt;/quote&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; What?  That means my air conditioner isn&#39;t a resource, because I \n&gt; can&#39;t reference it through hypertext (HTTP).  \n\nIf the air conditioner has a URI then you can reference it through \nhypertext. When you dereference you don&#39;t get back the air conditioner, \nthough, you get back a representation of it (perhaps a webcam snapshot, \nperhaps a static HTML document, perhaps an RDF instance)\n\n &gt; ...\n&gt; Ah, the resource is nothing I can ever get my hands on.  The resource \n&gt; is the &#39;concept&#39; that maps to reporting/changing temperature in my \n&gt; bedroom (and/or humidity, if my air conditioner was fancy enough).  \n&gt; So the air conditioner itself, the physical, plastic reality of the \n&gt; thing, is not a resource.  But by the act of mapping some of its \n&gt; functions as URIs, it becomes conceptually a resource, providing \n&gt; representations of its functions.  \n\nWhen you give URIs to the functions, the functions become Web resources. \nBut if you want the air conditioner to be a Web resource then it needs \nits own URI.\n\n\n&gt; 1) Define a resource, conceptually\n&gt; 2) Define representations of that resource\n&gt; 3) Map one URI to each representation - two representations being \n&gt; equivalent at some time does not confuse the issue, they are \n&gt; representations I have chosen to present.\n&gt; 4) Give the URIs to others to play with  :-)\n\nNote that there is nothing wrong with having multiple representations at \none URI. That&#39;s what HTTP content negotiation allows. Then your air \nconditioner can report itself in XML to XML clients and JPEG to \ngraphically oriented clients.\n\n&gt; A note:\n&gt; Reading RFC 2068 Section 9.6 on PUT, I see a lot of stuff about \n&gt; PUTting resources, not representations.  \n\nThe HTTP spec uses the term &quot;entity&quot; not representation for historical \nreasons. And in fact it does talk about PUTting entities, not resources.\n\n&gt; Roy says I can&#39;t GET the time functions that I just PUT, though, \n&gt; because you can&#39;t GET resources.  I can, however, GET a \n&gt; representation which seems to me like a fine compromise - the RFC \n&gt; says nothing about GETting back what you put, so that&#39;s OK (an indeed \n&gt; necessary by definition of a resource).\n\nI disagree. I do think that GET and PUT are meant to be symmetrical. \nResources can not be GOT nor PUT. Only representations/entities.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
