Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My colleague responded saying that many (if not most) Web applications\n&gt; today use this paradigm of funneling all requests though a single URL.\nAs others have pointed out, the single URL isn&#39;t that common, but a single\nrequest handler is.\nThe query terms are part of the resource identifer. They are not &#39;parameters\nto the method&#39; - even though that is a handy mental bridge between the\nprocedural programming world and resource modelling.\n\nThere might be many sites that DO use a single URL - if you see everything\ndone with POST and other data in form fields - like the identifier in a form\nfield - then that would be an example (and exactly analagous to many SOAP\napproaches). You wouldn&#39;t be able to hit &#39;refresh&#39; on these pages or\nbookmark them, which is a pain for end-users, so site designers naturally\navoid the &#39;one URL to rule them all&#39; approach.\n\nmike\n\n"}}
