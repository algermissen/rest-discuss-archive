I was in=\r\ncorrect to write that RFC 3986 prohibits\nthe square brackets. Rather, RFC 3=\r\n986 permits the square brackets in\nexactly one case: where the &quot;host&quot; subco=\r\nmponent (of the &quot;authority&quot;\ncomponent) takes the form of an &quot;IP-literal&quot;. W=\r\nhen the &quot;host&quot;\nsubcomponent identifies a host by IPv6 address or an &quot;IPvFut=\r\nure&quot; token,\nU+005B must appear as a prefix of the &quot;host&quot; component and U+00=\r\n5D must\nappear as a suffix of the host component.\n\n&gt; So is &quot;/&quot; [a general d=\r\nelimiter]. That doesn&#39;t stop us using\n&gt; using &quot;/&quot;. Why should it stop us us=\r\ning &quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot;?\n\nThe status of the square brackets as general delimiters is=\r\n not, per se,\nwhat prevents the use of the square brackets where you want t=\r\nhem.\nRather, it is simply impossible to produce a string with either square=\r\n\nbracket appearing in the scheme, path, query, or fragment given the\ngramma=\r\nr G =3D (Sigma =3D {U+0000..U+007F}, N =3D {URI, scheme, hier-part,\nquery, =\r\nfragment, authority, path-abempty, path-absolute, path-rootless,\npath-empty=\r\n, userinfo, host, port, IP-literal, IPvFuture, IPv6address,\nh16, ls32, IPv4=\r\naddress, dec-octet, reg-name, segment, pchar, query,\nfragment, pct-encoded,=\r\n unreserved, reserved, gen-delims, sub-delims}, P\n=3D the set of production=\r\n rules enumerated in the ABNF of RFC 3986, S =3D\nURI).\n\n&gt; Also, where in RF=\r\nC3986 are &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; reserved? They aren&#39;t in section\n&gt; 2.2 and I have sear=\r\nch through the document for &quot;&lt;&quot;.\n\nThe less-than sign and greater-than sign =\r\nare not reserved. They are\nexcluded. It is impossible to produce a string t=\r\nhat contains either the\nless-than sign or the greater-than sign given gramm=\r\nar G as above.\n\nFrank Ellerman pushed repeatedly to have RFC 3986 account e=\r\nxplicitly for\nall characters in the ASCII repertoire. (Or something like th=\r\nat, as I\ndon&#39;t remember the details and won&#39;t bother to trudge through the =\r\nmail\narchives.) Roy Fielding declined to do so. It&#39;s now up to the reader t=\r\no\nuse the process of elimination.\n\nRather than skimming or searching the en=\r\ntirety of RFC 3986, focus just\non Appendix A, the collected ABNF\n(&lt;http://g=\r\nbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html#collected-abnf&gt;).\n\n-- \nPlease do not=\r\n include my address in public replies.
