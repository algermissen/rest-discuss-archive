Sounds like disapp=\r\nrovement, due to the negative conception of the &quot;stereotype&quot; word. Not even=\r\n sure of your idea of my idea by writing the list.\n\nLet me state it again:\n=\r\n&quot;I love doing so sometimes (Naming things) to know what am I referring to&quot;\n=\r\n&quot;I guess it helps understand where are we standing in terms of REST usabili=\r\nty and knowledge.&quot;\n\nI had been in hundreds of discussions. Most of the time=\r\n, two people discuss about different things that are named the same. So, my=\r\n first action is to clarify what I mean by that name. Just as I did now wit=\r\nh my idea in the lines above.\n\nOk, let&#39;s start again: I&#39;ve created a classi=\r\nfication of the common understandings people that I&#39;ve read and discussed w=\r\nith, had shown related to REST. The intention is to identify how is the RES=\r\nT term used and understood. It makes no sense to put a face on each class, =\r\nwhen we want common behavior for analysis. \n\nSorry if taken as a bad thing.=\r\n Not my intention.\n\nWilliam.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bill de =\r\nhOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Assign a person to each of your stereotypes, let=\r\n them and everyone else \n&gt; know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still a good idea?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; wil=\r\nlmarpo wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; Reading through all this good mater=\r\nial about REST, I find some old time \n&gt; &gt; discussions around. Someone sugge=\r\nsted naming things is not so good, but \n&gt; &gt; I love doing so somethings to k=\r\nnow what am I referring to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I =\r\nwanted to present a classification \n&gt; &gt; I did two days ago while riding the=\r\n bus to work. Silly? It may be, but I \n&gt; &gt; guess it helps understand where =\r\nare we standing in terms of REST \n&gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *AP=\r\nI Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually not \n&gt; &gt; bui=\r\nlt thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually think \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nREST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.\n&gt; &gt; /Subcategories:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This are the ones that think REST is all about \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So their discussions are solely focused =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; on URIs, and their presentations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt; &gt;  - *R=\r\nPCers*. Bad group that think REST is a way to map RPC in disguise \n&gt; &gt; usin=\r\ng URIs in a web API. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak RPC at all.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  - *Exposers*: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhink you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST is an \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAPI for exposing things on the web.\n&gt; &gt;  - *CRUDers*: Another repeated grou=\r\np. They think REST is a web api for \n&gt; &gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Mappers*: =\r\nThis other category may use the API idea, but they actually \n&gt; &gt; thing REST=\r\n is a representation type and the work to be done is to map \n&gt; &gt; all that i=\r\ns know used to that new type. Interesting?\n&gt; &gt;  - *CRUDers*. Again, the ide=\r\na is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to \n&gt; &gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt; &gt;  - *HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enoug=\r\nh.\n&gt; &gt;  - *Exposers*. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, data =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call their systems RESTful=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t he reminders of the types=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n&gt; &gt;  - *Standard Haters*: Here =\r\nyou have all those that think Standards are \n&gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an a=\r\nnarchy where you have the freedom to do \n&gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they fol=\r\nlow REST doing whatever they want.\n&gt; &gt;  - *KISS lovers*. This are the ones =\r\nthat like thinks to be simple. And \n&gt; &gt; someone told them REST is easy, so =\r\nthey follow doing easy things with \n&gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots of URI juggler=\r\ns in this group.\n&gt; &gt;  - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and someo=\r\nne told them REST \n&gt; &gt; is a way to do services without SOAP. So they follow=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so t=\r\nhey \n&gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is cool and all people talk about it. =\r\nThere \n&gt; &gt; are some Buzz creators too, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA=\r\n. No pun \n&gt; &gt; intended on REST-*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? We=\r\nll, yes, probably the group that knows \n&gt; &gt; REST as it actually is and unde=\r\nrstan ds it. That may be a one person \n&gt; &gt; group (yes Roy).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m ma=\r\ny not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT \n&gt; &gt; saying =\r\nthey are good, at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think? Do you find yourself in =\r\nany of those groups?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
