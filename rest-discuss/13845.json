But now suppose we want to  \n&gt; update the order - to confirm that it has been paid, and that the  \n&gt; ordered items should now be shipped.\n\nWhy would the client want to confirm that it has paid? Usually the  \nseller would initiate shipment once the payment has been made. The  \nclient would just wait for the goods to arive at her doorstep.\n\nIn general, for these kinds of business transactions I think that  \nPOSTing business documents is the way to go. Look at UBL (http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/ \n) for examples. Even order changes I think should be done by sending  \nan OrderChange document to an appropriate resource (e.g. the one that  \nthe server told the client would be the target for order change  \nrequests).\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Coming from an OOP perspective, it feels as if we would like to send  \n&gt; a &quot;complete&quot; message to the Order object. But &quot;complete&quot; is not a  \n&gt; bit of order state - it&#39;s an instruction to some system to change  \n&gt; the state of an order and make sure a number of side-effects are  \n&gt; taken care of into the bargain.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen one purportedly &quot;RESTful&quot; interface, that has operations  \n&gt; like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST &gt; /Orders/Ord001/Complete\n&gt;\n&gt; {\n&gt;    shipping: &quot;express&quot;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; - but this seems wrong (&quot;complete&quot; is a verb, not a noun). Another  \n&gt; option might be this:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST &gt; /Orders/Ord001\n&gt;\n&gt; {\n&gt;    cmd: &quot;complete&quot;,\n&gt;    shipping: &quot;express&quot;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; - which seems reasonable, but is still a bit more like RMI than  \n&gt; feels quite right.\n&gt;\n&gt; The third option I&#39;ve considered is to say that an Order has  \n&gt; associated with it a Completion form, which one can fill in and  \n&gt; submit by POSTing to it. Here, a GET to the Order might return a  \n&gt; completion-uri (amongst other order details), and we might POST our  \n&gt; shipping options to that URI to get the Order completed. But now we  \n&gt; are updating the state of one resource (the Completion form) in  \n&gt; order to set in progress a chain of side-effects that will include  \n&gt; the updating of another resource (the Order itself). It seems a  \n&gt; little forced, compared to the RMI-ish example.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any really RESTful alternative I haven&#39;t considered?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; Dominic Fox\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
