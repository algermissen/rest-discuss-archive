Don&#39;t know if this clashes\n&gt; &gt; with DELETE semantics.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is clever, but it does clash.  From rfc2616 sec 9.7:  &quot;The DELETE method\n&gt; requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the\n&gt; Request-URI.&quot;  If the URI in question represents the object being subscribed to\n&gt; rather than the subscription itself, then the meaning of the DELETE is now\n&gt; ambiguous and probably not easily disabiguated.\n\nThis is a straw man! I asked Lucas to reify the subscription as its own\nresource. THAT was what I said could be DELETEd.\n\n&gt; My suggestion:  if the resource of interest is\n&gt; \n&gt;    /resource\n&gt; \n&gt; then its server-side subscriptions are represented under a collection\n&gt; \n&gt;   /resource/subs\n\nI think that specifying URI structures is bad mojo. HTTP doesn&#39;t do that\nanywhere else. Opaque URIs and all of that. I&#39;m learning this stuff by\nosmosis. Consider roy&#39;s suggestion here:\n\nhttp://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-September/004712.html\n\n&quot;What I would have done (and this was proposed at an early DAV meeting)\nis\ndefine a single resource metadata field for HTTP responses that gave a\nURI\nprefix for operations on properties of that resource.  E.g.,\n\n   Properties: &quot;http://example.com/this_resource;props&quot;\n\nand then simply define that namespace in the same way as old server-side\nimage maps were defined.  You could then do\n\n   GET http://example.com/this_resource;props?lock HTTP/1.1&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t want to build on WebDAV but I like the basic idea that the\nserver says where a resource&#39;s properties go. I think we could use the\nsame mechanism for subscriptions.\n\nSubscriptions: http://example.com/this_resource/subs\n\nYou POST to that to get a new sub.\n\n&gt; * Getting a subscription is a process of doing a POST to /resource/subs.\n\nAgree. Just think that the server should choose the subs location.\n\n&gt; * Getting the list of subs ifor resource s a GET on /resource/subs.\n\nAgree with same caveat.\n\n&gt; * The state of a sub can be changed by an appropriate POST to\n&gt; /resource/subs/&lt;someid&gt;.\n\nPOST or PUT??? Changing the state of a resource is done with PUT.\n\n&gt; * A sub can be cancelled via a DELETE on /resource/subs/&lt;someid&gt;\n\nAgree.\n\n&gt; Authentication of any / all of these operations is an orthogonal issue, handled in\n&gt; any of the usual ways.\n\nAgree.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
