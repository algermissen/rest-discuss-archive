That client is now ti=\r\nghtly\n&gt;&gt; coupled to a particular representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m still not seein=\r\ng the problem. =A0Any developer who coded a client\n&gt; against v1 of my examp=\r\nle, will still have a functional client when v2\n&gt; is rolled out -- they&#39;ve =\r\ncoded an automaton which knows what data to\n&gt; plug into what variables, for=\r\nmatted as an urlencoded query URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any human can manipulate v2 as easil=\r\ny as v1, because the user-agent\n&gt; automatically updated. =A0I wouldn&#39;t expe=\r\nct an m2m client to auto-\n&gt; update. =A0But any developer can update the cod=\r\ne of such an m2m client by\n&gt; following the annotated template the HTML of v=\r\n2 provides, at their\n&gt; leisure. =A0The client is coupled to the API, not th=\r\ne representation; how\n&gt; is this avoided outside of REST? =A0Those are the s=\r\nuper-AI clients I&#39;m\n&gt; failing to understand...\n&gt;\n&gt; What out-of-band knowled=\r\nge is required to interpret the v2 API, aside\n&gt; from the media type, which =\r\nlays out explicitly that &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;th&gt; are\n&gt; metadata, while &lt;dd&gt; and &lt;td&gt; =\r\nare data, etc. allowing the name-value\n&gt; pairs in the representation to be =\r\neasily discerned?\n\nLet my try to continue your example.  Say i write a scri=\r\npt to crawl my\nwiki and apply for media types based on the documentation th=\r\nere.  Of\ncourse, i point my script to the iana page.\n\nScenario (a):  Iana a=\r\ndds a &quot;donate&quot; form.  My script breaks because it\nexpected only one form on=\r\n the page.  The out-of-band knowledge was\nthat where is only one form on th=\r\ne page.  Adding a second form to a\npage is perfectly legal in (x)html.  The=\r\nre is no way for my script to\ntell the server it can only work with the sin=\r\ngle form version of the\npage.\n\nScenerio (b):  I point my script to your pag=\r\ne.  It does not work, of\ncourse, because there is no input named &quot;name&quot;.  Y=\r\nour page is a\nincompatible derivative of the iana page.  However, that is n=\r\not\nsurfaced explicitly anywhere.  Worse yet, what the script can/should\nexp=\r\nect is not documented anywhere.\n\nIn both cases the fundamental issue is tha=\r\nt my script is coupled to a\nspecific service implementation rather than a m=\r\nedia type.  Any change\nin the specific implementation is likely to cause is=\r\nsues.  (Browsers,\non the other hand, are coupled to the html media type.  T=\r\nhey can take\nany valid html document and render it successfully.)\n\nPeter\nba=\r\nrelyenough.org\n\n"}}
