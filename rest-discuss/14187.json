In order to being able to make such=\r\n an assumptions, the  \n&gt; classification information must be made available =\r\nby the service. In  \n&gt; addition, when client developers should be enabled t=\r\no develop clients  \n&gt; before the services exist this information is needed =\r\nas some form of  \n&gt; service type description. The specification of applicat=\r\nion/atomsrv+xml  \n&gt; is a good example of such a service type description.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; But however this is approached, it essentially comes down to telling  \n=\r\n&gt; the client what kinds of resources (IOW: kinds of application states)  \n&gt;=\r\n to expect on the server. I just cannot code to update the resource  \n&gt; foo=\r\n:status when I have now clue that this user goal is applicable to  \n&gt; the r=\r\nesource in the first place.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have an idea how to align this=\r\n (IMHO fact) with the  \n&gt; constraint that no information about resource typ=\r\nes must be made  \n&gt; available to clients in RESTful systems?\n&gt; \n\nYou are ma=\r\nking the mistake of starting with the service. You need to start with the c=\r\nlient... tell me more about this client. What event causes a search for tic=\r\nkets to occur? Where does the data that goes into the search parameters com=\r\ne from? Where does the new value for the status come from? What happens aft=\r\ner the status is updated?\n\nThe hypermedia format drives the client. How can=\r\n you define your hypermedia format without first understanding and defining=\r\n your client? \n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
