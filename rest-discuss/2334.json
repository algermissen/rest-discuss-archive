It talks about side-effects, but \ndoesn&#39;t clearly indicate whether those effects are effects on the \nserver or effects on the client.\n\nI&#39;m reasonably sure that the primary intention was only to refer to \nside-effects on the server (if nothing else this would be consistent \nwith the way &quot;idempotent&quot; is used in the context of ONC RPC), and that \nthe client-visible results of a GET and any client-side side-effects \nare irrelevant.\n\nHowever, this is somewhat confused by the discussion of &quot;idempotent \nsequences of methods&quot;,\n\n  However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non-\n  idempotent, even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are\n  idempotent. (A sequence is idempotent if a single execution of the\n  entire sequence always yields a result that is not changed by a\n  reexecution of all, or part, of that sequence.) For example, a\n  sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a value that is\n  later modified in the same sequence.\n\nwhere &quot;yields a result&quot; seems to be refering to effects on the client. \nThat can&#39;t be right tho&#39;, because if it were, DELETE wouldn&#39;t be \nidempotent: even tho&#39; the effect of multiple DELETEs of the same \nresource is the same as just one on the server, it&#39;s likely that the \nclient-visible result would differ: a 200 for the first invocation and \n404s subsequently.\n\nOn the server-side-relevant-only interpretation, a GET can return  \ndifferent results on every invocation so long as no server-side state \nis mutated by the GETs themselves. There are quite a few ways that \ncould happen: if there are multiple clients, one might POST \nconcurrently with another GETing; or there might be out of band content \nupdates; or the result of the GETs might be generated by some process \nwhich is not itself affected by the GET, eg. a clock or a random number \ngenerator. Clearly in these kinds of case care has to be taken with \nExpires: and Cache-Control:, but that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.\n\nFor all that this is reasonably coherent and consistent, I&#39;ve never yet \nbeen able to square it with the elaboration in the last sentence quoted \nabove,\n\n  For example, a sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a\n  value that is later modified in the same sequence.\n\nFor example, here&#39;s a sequence of methods which are each individually \nidempotent,\n\n  GET /foo\n  PUT /foo\n\nIntuitively this is the kind of case that the clause is intended to \nexclude: a sequence which is non-idempotent even tho&#39; it&#39;s constituents \nare. If we reexecute the sequence, the result of the second GET will \nhave been affected by the first PUT ...\n\n... but hang on a minute: that&#39;s _only_ true with respect to client- \nvisible results. If we&#39;re only paying attention to the effects of the \nsequence on the server, then this sequence is perfectly idempotent, and \nany number of reexecutions will have exactly the same effect as the \nfirst.\n\nIn truth, paying attention only to server-side effects of idempotent \nmethods, I&#39;ve not been able to come up with a single example of a \nnon-idempotent sequence. I&#39;d be interested to know if anyone else can. \nIf not, does that mean that client-visible results _do_ play a role in \nidempotency? In which case, whither PUT, DELETE and GETs which return \nnon-constant results?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
