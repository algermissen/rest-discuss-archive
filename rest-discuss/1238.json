(I&#39;m not arguing, just thinking about it.)\n\n&gt; &gt; We discussed this once before, in the context of EDI-mailbox-\nstyle \n&gt; &gt; SOAP, where messages have &quot;conversation&quot; and &quot;transaction&quot; tags.\n&gt; &gt; In that discussion, (I think) we agreed that these tags could be \n&gt; &gt; replaced by making the subjects of the conversation into Web \n&gt; &gt; resources with URIs.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And that there were advantages to the transformation: from one \n&gt; &gt; centralized mailbox with a dispatcher, to individual addresses \nfor \n&gt; &gt; each conversational subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t remember that conversation exactly.  But I recall mentioning\n&gt; possible &quot;CHECKPOINT&quot; and &quot;ROLLBACK&quot; methods, though I decided that \nGET\n&gt; and PUT could be used instead.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1094\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1095\n\nBH:\n&gt;&gt; So if I make the Order into a Web resource, created by \n&gt;&gt; the initial POST, then all subsequent POSTs or GETs are \n&gt;&gt; addressed either to that Order resource or one of its \n&gt;&gt; sub-resources (LineItems, Deliveries, Invoices, Payments, etc.)\n&gt;&gt; I consider Transactions to be business entities, \n&gt;&gt; so they could be sub-resources.\n&gt;&gt; So I no longer have one gateway URI with a dispatcher behind it, \n&gt;&gt; I am directly addressing the relevant business resource.\n&gt;&gt; Does this make sense to anybody else?\n\nMB:\n&gt; Yep, that&#39;s exactly my thinking too.\n&gt; Plus, because you&#39;re identifying the mailbox at a more \n&gt; granular level than just a catch-all mailbox, GET, PUT, \n&gt; and DELETE makes sense.\n\nBy the way, when I use the word &quot;transaction&quot; here, I mean &quot;business \nstate alignment&quot; not database.  So there is no rollback.  The \nresources just fail to advance to the next state.\n\n\n\n"}}
