So really the &lt;...concat&gt; URI is a verb.\n\nIf dereferenced it would (if it returned anything) presumably return \nsomething which documented this action. When dereferencing we are \nusing it as a noun - it&#39;s a &quot;thing&quot; and we are finding out something \nabout it, but when used in the mergeType element it is a verb, or at \nleast an adverb.\n\nNone of this is new of course, but I&#39;ve been wondering how it fits as \nfar as verb-URIs-are-a-Bad-Thing and I&#39;m struck by a conflict between \nthe two.\n\nIt seems to me in this case though that there is a slight analogy to \nC/C++ function pointers, C++ function objects, Javascript function \nreferences, etc.. I don&#39;t want to make too much of that analogy \n(comparing web services to programming languages, leads to - well it \ndoesn&#39;t lead to REST) but I&#39;m finding some peace with this type of \nverb URIs.\n\nAgreements?, Disagreements?\n\n\n\n"}}
