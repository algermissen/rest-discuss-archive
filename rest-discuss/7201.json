Fielding wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it is more accurate to say that a resource cannot change\n&gt; &gt; its interface as part of an evolution because all resources have\n&gt; &gt; the same interface. (405 doesn&#39;t change the interface -- it is an\n&gt; &gt; answer to the request via the same interface.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok. Would it then be reasonable to say that a style that constrains  \n&gt; the\n&gt; interface (to be uniform) increases evolvabiliy because changes\n&gt; resulting from evolution are only visible as data element changes and\n&gt; such changes are easier to cope with than interface changes?\n&gt;\n&gt; That has actually been my thinking over the past years, but admitedly\n&gt; I still lack a compelling reasoning why for example an incompatible\n&gt; data element change is less complex than an incopatible inerface  \n&gt; change.\n&gt; (Hence I though the question of the caller being in a defined state\n&gt; after\n&gt; an evolution induced faulure would be the answer).\n&gt;\n&gt; Or is it as simple as &quot;the complexity with data elements is inherently\n&gt; lower, e.g. because there are never issues like method call  \n&gt; sequences or\n&gt; because it is easier to standardize a data element type than to\n&gt; standardize\n&gt; an interface, etc&quot;)?\n&gt; Intuitively I have no problem really, but as said, it is the\n&gt; reasoning that\n&gt; I find to be incomplete (in my head).\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But REST does not\n&gt; &gt; require use of a single interface protocol, so in that sense the\n&gt; &gt; interface could change dynamically (e.g., HTTP Upgrade).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
