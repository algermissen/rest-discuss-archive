Let me see if I\ncan reframe my argument in terms you can agree with.  First, here is the\nAxiom of Opacity:\n\n&quot;The only thing you can use an identifier for is to refer to an object. When\nyou are not dereferencing you should not look at the contents of the URI\nstring to gain other information...&quot;\n\n(I eliminated &quot;as little as possible&quot; as it&#39;s a typical TBLism that is\nneither quantifiable nor objective.)\n\nMy point is this:  this is *clearly* inaccurate even with respect to\nexisting standardized practices.  As you yourself agree, there are at least\ntwo other semantics:  comparison (a form of deconstruction) and construction\nfrom relative URI.  So URI do *not* only support dereference;  it is\nnecessary to look at the contents of the URI string in some contexts to gain\nthe information necessary to use them the way they need to be used.\n\n.:, URI are not opaque in any sense consistent with the Axiom, and perhaps\nnot opaque in any meaningful sense.\n\nDespite this, you and I share and agree on an &quot;intuitive&quot; definition of\n&quot;opacity&quot; that we believe is desirable for URI.  A better way to put this,\nrather than calling it &quot;opacity,&quot; would be:  URI do NOT have any implicit\nsemantics.  All operations and semantics on URI *must* be explicitly\nspecified.  I would even go further and say that these semantics must not\nonly be explicit, they must be universal within a given URI scheme.  In this\nsense, I perhaps advocate &quot;opacity&quot; (really, its intent) even more strongly\nthan you.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If *applications* stick to those three methods then you will not\n&gt; accidentally treat XML as HTML by sniffing the file extension, you will\n&gt; not accidentally infer hierarchical relationships that don&#39;t exist, you\n&gt; will not accidentally treat a .jsp as code rather than data, you will\n&gt; not accidentally make code that works with HTTP but not HTTPS (or any\n&gt; other REST-compliant protocol) etc.\n\nHere we agree on desired outcome but disagree on how to get there.  We agree\nthat URI should not e.g. have content type semantics embedded in them.  URI\nare names - not type descriptions.  Parsing URI to determine type is a bad\nthing, and indeed it is historically the motivation for the &quot;Axiom&quot; in\nquestion.  In general, lots of problems result when you start assuming\nthings about the semantics of URI.\n\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean that URI *should* or even *do* have only the semantics\nof dereference, or even the set of { deref, compare, construct-relative }.\nThere may well be other semantics of construction and deconstruction that\nare both generic (universal) and useful / desirable.  My argument is\ntherefore the following:\n\nGiven any universal / useful mechanism for use / construction /\ndeconstruction of URI beyond { deref, compare, construct-relative }, there\nis *no* particular reason to reject such a mechanism out of hand on the\nbasis of the clearly defective &quot;Axiom&quot; of URI Opacity alone.\n\nSure, such rejection is &quot;safe&quot; --- if we assume just those three operations,\nwe can be sure that programs that use just those operations work correctly.\nAnd this is a good thing.  In general, constraints are a good thing --- the\nWeb gains much of its power through its constraining mechanisms.  However,\nconstraints should not be arbitrary, and IMO rejecting the possibility of\nadditional explicit / universal semantics for URI is just such an\nunacceptable, arbitrary constraint.  By itself, the existence of the\nso-called Axiom is not sufficient to reject the possibility that other\nuniversal and useful semantics might be explicitly specified at some point.\n\n$0.02,\n\nJb\n\nPS - one other important bit.  It&#39;s important to distinguish between HTTP\nURI and URI in general.  The Axiom of Opacity is intended to apply to all\nURI, not just HTTP-scheme URI.  And while it may (or may not) be desirable\nto ignore the hierarchical semantics of the path part of an HTTP URI, it&#39;s\n***NOT*** the case that this is desirable in all conceivable URI schemes.\nFilesystem related schemes like smb:// and nfs:// absolutely *require* that\nclients of those protocols be able to deconstruct and comprehend URI\naccording to their hierarchical structure.  So another problem with the\nAxiom of Opacity --- and its dogmatic interpretation --- is that it is\noverly biased to the-Web-of-HTTP-and-hypertext.  It assumes things that it\ncannot assume about non-HTTP URI schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
