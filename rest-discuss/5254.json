I make the resource mean the same thing to all\n&gt; people, and represent=\r\n extra authorities as separate resources. For\n&gt; example, my wiki home page =\r\nis at:\n&gt;\n&gt; https://yurl.net/id/home\n&gt;\n&gt; I have the authority to edit that p=\r\nage and you don&#39;t; however, when I\n&gt; do a GET on the above URL, I see the s=\r\name thing that you do. I have a\n&gt; separate URL that I use for editing the p=\r\nage.\n\nOk, so I might have a logical &quot;resource&quot; that knows about lots of\noth=\r\ner logical &quot;resources&quot;, but my YURL design might need to have many\ncapabili=\r\nty-based resources for each logical &quot;resource&quot;.\n\nFor example, if my logical=\r\n resource was a Purchase Order, it might be\nlogically  linked to my supplie=\r\nr&#39;s Sales Order, which might be\nlogically linked to my supplier&#39;s manufactu=\r\nring schedule, which might\nbe logically linked to my supplier&#39;s suppliers, =\r\netc.  I might have\ncapability YURLs for the Sales Order but probably not al=\r\nl the way back\nto my supplier&#39;s suppliers.\n\nSo the capability or YURL desig=\r\nn would be a major upfront project\nphase for any new Web system.  I can see=\r\n this becoming a big\nbottleneck, full of pitfalls and errors from lack of f=\r\noresight,\nunderstanding, wrong guesses as to future requirements, etc.  We&#39;=\r\nre\nback in waterfall territory, which has proven to be a bad way to\ndevelop=\r\n software.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"}}
