It suggests to me that its meaning\n&gt; can have a wider scope than just the URI to which it&#39;s appended. \n&gt; If so, that&#39;s pretty darned useful, though less opaque (which is\n&gt; ok, as long as its interpretation is uniform).  It appears to work\n&gt; like a HTTP header.  But it is not itself a URI, so perhaps a\n&gt; registry is needed, or we can figure out a way of making it a URI.\n\nDo you have any references for these uses? I was under the impression\nthat parameters were just as opaque as any other URI component;\nservers certainly seem to treat them as such. IIRC they were\noriginally introduced to enable VMS files (with versions) to be\neasily URIified.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard that deployed URI support is actually pretty good, except\n&gt; maybe in some funky cases like http://foo.com/bar;q?a=b\n\nPython&#39;s urlparse is broken; it assumes that you can only\nparameterise the last path segment, not every path segment. As a\nresult, \n  http://www.example.com/foo;bar/baz?bat\ngets parsed as\n (&#39;http&#39;, &#39;www.example.com&#39;, &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar/baz&#39; &#39;bat&#39; &#39;&#39;)\n\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
