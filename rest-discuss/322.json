If you are just building a\n&gt; one-off app then by all means, use whatever software you&#39;ve got laying\n&gt; around. Do asynch FTP if it is convenient.\n\nSure.  Post the PO to a URL.  Or... email the PO\nto an email address.  This is a file format issue,\nnot a protocol issue.\n\n&gt; &gt; Asynchronous delivery may be one of your  problems\n&gt; &gt; and SMTP does a decent  job.\n&gt;\n&gt; You claim it does. But who do you know using SMTP for these kinds of\n&gt; jobs? I know about thousands of complicated ecommerce apps using HTTP\n&gt; and none using SMTP. Even inside of organizations, most companies do not\n&gt; use SMTP for asynch delivery of business-critical information. They use\n&gt; MQseries etc.\n\nThats because SMTP implementations typicall suck.\nCheck out http://ironport.com.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; ... The hard problems of security and\n&gt; &gt; accountability are orthogonal issues.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the crux of our communication problem. You think asynchronous\n&gt; delivery is hard and using HTTP makes it harder. I think it is easy and\n&gt; using HTTP makes no difference.\n\nNo.  I just don&#39;t see why you are reinventing the\nwheel.\n\n&gt; I think security and accountability are brutally hard and I think that\n&gt; reifying objects as addressable entities makes them much more managable.\n\n&gt; Thirty years of Unix and even Windows NT supports my position. How do I\n&gt; make it possible for a user to print or not to print? I treat the\n&gt; printer (or print queue) as a resource and give them permissions to it.\n&gt; How do I cancel jobs? I reify them as objects and then delete them. How\n&gt; do I know who did what? I look at the logs for those addressable\n&gt; objects.\n\nOk.  So I think SMTP is like the network transport\nlayer.  Windows is perfectly happy to use TCP/IP\nrather than NetBIOS as its transport.  These\nissues are orthogonal to the procedures for\naccessing server logs.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
