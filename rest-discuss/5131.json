Instead, it just serves as a warning to the\nresource publisher to keep in mind that any mutation action they take is\nat their own peril.\n\nIn other words, logging GET requests is fine, just don&#39;t expect to be\nable to seek damages from Google if you&#39;re hard drive fills up with\nGooglebot requests.\n\nMark.\n\nOn Fri, Jul 08, 2005 at 07:38:58AM -0500, Dimitri Glazkov wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am just getting into this REST thinking, and kicking around\n&gt; theoretical questions and basic puzzlers seems to help tremendously in\n&gt; getting the thinking straight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s one: the absolute majority of all Web Servers will generate a\n&gt; server log entry for each request.
