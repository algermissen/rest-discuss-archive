Either that or &quot;application state&quot; or maybe &quot;session\nstate&quot;.  I used to prefer &quot;session state&quot;, but &quot;application state&quot;\nhas grown on me despite many people thinking it means data.\n&quot;conversational state&quot; is arguably better, especially when talking\nto Web services folks, since, of course, &quot;conversations&quot; are a big\ndeal.\n\n&gt;  When you propose to capture conversational\n&gt; state as a globally addressable resource, you&#39;re promoting it\n&gt; to something &quot;higher&quot; than conversational state.  Indeed, you&#39;re\n&gt; likely factoring out the conversation in doing that, maintaining\n&gt; only the points of agreement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Think: If clients were responsible for *all* application state, then\n&gt; there would be no need for servers.\n\nI like to call that &quot;application data&quot;.  &quot;application state&quot; should\nrefer to the state of the application (duh!), such as &quot;waiting for\ninput from user&quot;, etc..\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.
