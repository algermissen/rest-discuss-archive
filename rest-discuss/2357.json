Would you argue that a GET that bumped up a\n&gt; counter was safe?\n\nFor me, this is the key question (and perhaps a little too tempting not\nto address).\n\nA safe operation is one that&#39;s not intended to modify the resource.\nThe resource in this Google example is the results of a search query. The\nGET does not modify those results. \n\nThe &#39;counter&#39; isn&#39;t related to the resource being requested. Nor is it\n(necessarily) exposed to the user. It&#39;s just a way for Google to work out\nwhether to allow you to make the query; it doesn&#39;t affect the query itself,\nyou can either make it or you can&#39;t. This is not significantly different\nfrom a restriction based upon time of day, IP address of the client, or \nsomesuch. I think there&#39;s perhaps a temptation to treat this &#39;1001st request&#39; \nexample differently, because there&#39;s a loose sense of &#39;state&#39; brought about\nby association of state with previous calls. \n\nWhat if Google had performance problems (goodness forbid) and suddenly \ndecided to restrict answering calls that day to clients that hadn&#39;t yet\nmade any ... and returned 500 (or another non-200 status) to those that\nhad - would the same &#39;unsafe&#39; philosophy apply?\n\nTo bring in a point I made in a comment to the question/discussion [1]:\nThe Axioms document states \n\n  &quot;It is wrong to represent the user doing a GET as ... doing any\n  operation which effects the state of the Web or the state of the\n  users relationship with the information provider or the server.&quot; [2]\n\nReturning (e.g.) a 403 on the 1001st GET underlines, not undermines, the\nrelationship with the information provider and server.\n\nIn all, I&#39;m having difficulty seeing this as an idempotency/side-effect\nissue. I&#39;d be grateful for any comments on the above.\n\nKind regards\ndj (still learning)\nhttp://www.pipetree.com/qmacro\n\n\n[1] http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/?entry=784\n[2] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms#state\n\n\n\n\n"}}
