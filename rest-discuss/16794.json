If a person who wanted =\r\nto create players then had the serendipity to come across your API, they wo=\r\nuld know exactly where to find documentation on your new type. \n\nThe above =\r\nis probably the most RESTful.\n\nOther approaches include:\n\n1) create a resou=\r\nrce catalog that provides type information for all entities in your system\n=\r\n\n2) something similar to your suggestions - /players/types\n\n3) this one is =\r\na little more involved....\nso, in theory, the /players resource could respo=\r\nnd to a GET request with some hypermedia containing links and/or representa=\r\ntions of all known players.  Ideally, you&#39;d like to be able to filter those=\r\n players.  You could add query parameters that control:\n\na) pagination\nb) s=\r\nearch - the fabulous q=3D from open search\nc) what we called projections - =\r\nfiltering the fields of the entities\nd) ...or some query parameter that wou=\r\nld return type information\n\nHowever, all of these other approaches violate =\r\nthe uniform interface constraint to some degree.  Users must somehow discov=\r\ner how to parse the resource catalog, how to add a trailing /types or how t=\r\no add a types query parameter.\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;skil=\r\nlzero&quot; &lt;skillzero@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a resource /players where you can =\r\nPOST to create a new player /players/{id}, but I also want a way to report =\r\nthe supported types of players. I&#39;m struggling with the correct, RESTful wa=\r\ny to do that. Here&#39;s the ways I&#39;ve thought of and they all seem to have pro=\r\nblems:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. /players/types. This seems the closest to other things I&#39;ve =\r\nseen out there (e.g. atom categories), but it looks weird to me because I e=\r\nxpect /players/{id}, but &quot;types&quot; isn&#39;t really an id.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. /players/{id}/=\r\ntypes. This seems okay if you already have an id, but since players are cre=\r\nated dynamically, the client won&#39;t know the id beforehand. And you need to =\r\nknow the type of player to create one. Additionally, the types supported by=\r\n a specific player instance may mean something else (e.g. it could mean the=\r\n types its compatible rather than types you can create).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. /player-ty=\r\npes. This seems a little ugly to me, but maybe it&#39;s fine?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a g=\r\nood way to do this?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
