A blueprint is an XML\ndocument that tells =\r\nthe host what assembly/library to use and what\nservice definitions it conta=\r\nins.  Registering a blueprint is done by\nsending a blueprint to:\nPOST /host=\r\n/register\n\nThe second operation is instantiating a service.  In order to\nin=\r\nstantiate a service, a configuration XML document must be sent to\nthe Host.=\r\n  This is achieved by doing:\nPOST /host/start\n\nIn both cases, the document =\r\nsent has &quot;application/xml&quot; as mime type. \nIf another type gets sent, it is =\r\nconverted to &quot;application/xml&quot; if\npossible (e.g. application/json, text/jav=\r\nascript, text/php, and other\nsupported XML mappings).\n\nSo, what would be th=\r\ne alternative?\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
