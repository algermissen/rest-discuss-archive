A connector presents an abstract interface\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; component communication, the generality of which enables substitutability:\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; the users&#39; only access to the system is via an abstract interface, the\n&gt; &gt; IMPLEMENTATION can be replaced without impacting the users.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, implementation substitution will result in a different application\n&gt; which should &quot;impact the users&quot;, but I suspect you just misspoke there.\n\n\nNo. I quoted verbatim from the dissertation:\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_2\n\nYou are again using the words client application and connector interchangeably!\nSubstitutability applies to the CONNECTOR and not the CLIENT APPLICATION which\nhappens to be a COMPONENT in REST.\nImplementation substitution does not necessarily mean a different application!\nIf I have an application that uses a specific API and I then go and change the\nimplementation of that API, note that I said implementation and not the\ninterface, that does not change the application because the application still\nhas the same API to deal with. It&#39;s just the internal implementation that has\nchanged.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Now, resources can change over time but the semantics of the conceptual\n&gt; mapping\n&gt; &gt; to a set of entities is required to be static, since the semantics is what\n&gt; &gt; distinguishes one resource from another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I understand, you guys are confusing the semantics of a request\n&gt; (as\n&gt; &gt; indicated by standard methods and media types) with the semantics of the\n&gt; &gt; mapping to a set of entities that is a resource.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think, this is what Roy meant in an earlier mail when he said:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The interface is substitutable. Resources are not substitutable. Nobody\n&gt; has an\n&gt; &gt; expectation that you can replace one resource with a different resource\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; have continuation of semantics.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, that&#39;s what I assumed he meant.  Like I said above, you&#39;ve\n&gt; composed a new application; &quot;different stuff happens&quot;, so to speak.\n\n\nRight! What you are talking about ARE different applications which has nothing\nto do with REST. REST doesn&#39;t tell you what your application should do, as long\nas &quot;all of REST&#39;s constraints are being obeyed&quot; like Roy says.\n\n&quot;Different stuff can happen&quot; as long as it is not happening between\ncomponents/connectors which are constrained by REST but between the component\nand the its consumer.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; In the case of performing a query over POST, the semantics of the request\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; therefore of the interaction between the components are uniform because\n&gt; nothing\n&gt; &gt; in the response control data was non-uniform and completely covered in\n&gt; REST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that REST does not say anything about resource expectations being\n&gt; uniform,\n&gt; &gt; it just talks constrains connector/component interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when you say:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If you write a client application that presumes the resource returned in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Location header is a query result, and attempt to do further processing\n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; on that presumption, your client will fail against arbitrary resources.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What you guys are talking about is the semantics of the mapping to a set\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; entities that is a resource and not the semantics of the interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nope, we&#39;re definitely talking about the interface, and specifically a\n&gt; nuance of POST semantics.\n\n\nI still think you are confusing the two.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s like saying that if I expect a java applet from a GET request to a\n&gt; &gt; specific resource I should expect a java applet at any other arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; resource!\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that would be very silly!\n\n\nYet, that is exactly what you are saying from my perspective.\n\n\nSandeep\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
