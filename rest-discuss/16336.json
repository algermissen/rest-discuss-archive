I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a user agent concern, application/svg+xml is\na ubiquitous media type, so any stakeholder with an interest knows what\nprocessing model any user agent needs to support, regardless of intent\n(render vs. introspect for links).\n\nI&#39;d say that the needs of the resource drive the choice of media type,\nnot the needs of the user agent.  Modeling a telephony system in HTML\nso that it may be driven by a human using a browser is inappropriate to\nthe needs of the resource.\n\nIf user agent = telephony device, then choice of device should be\ndriven by support for the media types the service uses.  Just as choice\nof browser should be driven by support for application/svg+xml if the\nresource representations are best modeled as hypertext controls embedded\nwithin vector graphics.\n\nThe obvious problem with my logic is that it depends upon free will.\nIf the corporate intranet only allows IE, then the representations\ncan&#39;t be application/svg+xml, so the needs of the user agent are\nnot driving choice of media type, but imposing artificial restrictions\non that choice.  Which I see as a bad thing, hence my advocacy for\ngoing the other way around...\n\nSo, yeah, make &quot;supported media types&quot; a function of resource modeling,\nwithout considering client concerns.  Choosing HTML should be driven by\nits appropriateness to the resource, letting user agents take whatever\nform they need to take, using the common knowledge of a ubiquitous\nmedia type to inform them of available state transitions, etc.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
