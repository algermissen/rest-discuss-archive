As for version control\n&gt; I was thinking more along the lines of git/hg/svn over http, however\n&gt; rfc5829 is a good example.\n\nRe. version descriptions and usage, I can also imagine the utilization \nof Semantic Web ontologies (cf. discussion on semanticoverflow.com [1], \nrather then a central spec with a restricted set of defined link \nrelations types for version descriptions.\n\nGenerally, please correct, when I&#39;m getting wrong here, but I do not \nreally understand all the hassle with the link relation types. As I \nalready stated in a comment in dret&#39;s blog [2]:\n\n&quot;For me a link is a binary relation in its nature, which can be type (if \nits not typed, then we have at least one type ;) ). When looking behind \nthe scene of RDF Model, one will also find that binary relation, that is \nidentified by the predicate position of an RDF triple. Due to its \nmetamodel they are called properties, which are typed. So every property \nassigns a specific relation type. I don&#39;t see any need for a central \nlink relation type registry, since one can simply resolve the property \nURI and should ideally get a description that describes the processing \nmodel of that link type human and machine understandable (processable). \nFurthermore, I thought decentralization is one of main success criterias \nof the Web. So why working against this constraint?\nAll in all, why not simply applying RDF Model for that issue, i.e. as it \nis propagated recently with RDFa? I think the knowledge representation \nstructure of RDF Model is quite ideal therefore.&quot;\n\nOkay, one can argue today link relation type / property definitions \ndoesn&#39;t include a description of the processing model alï¿½ HTML &quot;anchor \nelements with an href attribute create a hypertext link that, when \nselected, invokes a retrieval request (GET) on the URI corresponding to \nthe CDATA-encoded href attribute&quot;. However, please correct when I wrong \nhere, also the quoted processing model description from above isn&#39;t \navailable in a machine-processing-able form. But, I can imagine such \ndescriptions also for this type.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n[1] \nhttp://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/2815/how-do-i-know-model-the-applied-version-of-an-ontology-specification\n[2] \nhttp://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2010/11/web-linking.html?cid=6a00d8341f066253ef0147e218c59e970b#comment-6a00d8341f066253ef0147e218c59e970b\n\n"}}
