Or to just add a GET that returns an entity of just \n&gt; t=\r\nhe comments, or simply say &quot;well, if I made GET do anything it would be \n&gt; =\r\nto return an entity that shows just the comments, but since it&#39;ll never \n&gt; =\r\nbe used I&#39;m not going to bother implementing it=94.\n\nInteresting option ind=\r\need.\n\n&gt; The main reason I&#39;d argue in favour of posting to /posts/43 is that=\r\n the \n&gt; relationship between /posts/43 and /posts/43 is obvious, while the =\r\n\n&gt; relationship between it and what is (relative to it) ./43/comments is \n&gt;=\r\n less so. Had the post had the URI /posts/43/ with a trailing slash, then \n=\r\n&gt; this would be less so pressing.\n\nTrue. It is easy to make the relationshi=\r\np from the blog post to a comment, and from each comment to the collection =\r\nof all comments. But from the blog post to all comments is less convenient,=\r\n all the more since we would serve all the comments in the post=92s represe=\r\nntation anyway.\n\n&gt; All of this is about niceties though. /adfs/d32rsdf/1ras=\r\n89%20sfdakl \n&gt; would be just as good as either from a purely REST perspecti=\r\nve, but \n&gt; niceties do matter.\n\nI beg to differ here: the question is not a=\r\nbout the exact URI used, but about the resource that is identified by that =\r\nURI.\n\nI my example /posts/43 was the resource =93blog post 43=94 and /posts=\r\n/43/comments the resource =93comments to blog post 43=94.\nNow whether the U=\r\nRI to these resources is /posts/43 and /posts/43/comments or /bar and /foo =\r\ndoesn=92t matter; but they *are* different resources.\nTherefore, my questio=\r\nn was to which resource I should POST, i.e., what resource does /adfs/d32rs=\r\ndf/1ras89%20sfdakl identify?\n\nBest,\n\nRuben\n"}}
