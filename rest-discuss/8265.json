If you did that you would have a usable, RESTfull service.\n\nThere is debate here about what that XML should be. But any XML is\nacceptable. The BEST XML is a matter of some debate.\n\n\n&gt; 2) I do not see the need for the mvc pattern to be implemented here \n&gt; as my service is not a true web application.\n\nSeems fair.\n\nMVC is *just* a programming pattern. You don&#39;t need to use it.\n\n\n&gt; 3) I do not see the need to use Restlet Frame Work since my intent \n&gt; is to use the web container ONLY to support Soap based web service. \n&gt; Also I do not want to embed the overhead of routers and resources \n&gt; and servletconvertor.\n\nThat&#39;s fine. You don&#39;t need to use Restlet to make a REST service. I\nhave *never* used Restlet&#39;s and I&#39;ve been designing REST based\nservices since 2002.\n\n\n&gt; Also an example code of the Rest based web service is appreciated.\n\nHave a poke around on the REST wiki... there are good examples of\nbasic REST technologies.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
