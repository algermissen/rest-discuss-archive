The article Subbu provided\n&gt; (http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/10/generalized-linking) is a great\n&gt; example of what is possible with JSON in that regard.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kris Zyp&#39;s efforts on JSON referencing, whilst maybe not as\n&gt; extensible as Subbu&#39;s proposal, have been implemented on the client\n&gt; side in the Dojo toolkit\n&gt; (http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/06/17/json-referencing-in-dojo/),\n&gt; and they seem to provide an adequate hypermedia mechanism for &#39;basic&#39;\n&gt; HATEOAS.\n\nYes, I know Kris&#39;s articles and, indeed, I&#39;m using Dojo for a client \naccessing a RESTful service. However, unless I&#39;m much mistaken, these \nproposals only address linking, which, of course, is essential for \nHATEOAS, but not all of it.\n\n&gt; The most significant difference I see between Subbu and Kris&#39;\n&gt; proposals are the optional content negotation properties - namely\n&gt; &#39;type&#39; and &#39;hreflang&#39; - I absolutely agree with Subbu that these\n&gt; properties are important for extensbility, but clearly (since they\n&gt; are optional) they are not &#39;crucial&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly; other hypermedia formats like HTML provide no concrete\n&gt; markup for content negotation either, although they probably should\n&gt; in my opinion! HTML5 is not adding markup for this at time of writing\n&gt; :(\n\nIOW, the experts haven&#39;t decided on how things should be done, yet. \nThat&#39;s fine, but as I&#39;m looking for practically applicable guidelines \nand examples, I realized that I&#39;m too early and just have to wait some \nmore. As much as I&#39;m interested in the results, I don&#39;t want to enter \nthis particular discussion.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
