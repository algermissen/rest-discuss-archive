There is a few things that I want\nto respond to.\n\nThanks David for pointing out that not every domain name is necessarily\na website, and that the idea of a &quot;web site&quot; in general is a rather\nvague notion that defies definition.  Thanks also goes to Mark for point\nthat standardizing URI structure is counter to the constraints laid out\nin the REST model.  Mark, do you remember where that is specified in\nFieldings paper?  Apparently I have more homework to do...\n\nEven if standardizing the URI isn&#39;t RESTful, perhaps it could be\nsomething that may be useful when applied to REST.  Just as if you are\nwriting a contact page, using hCard would be a good idea, but if you\ndon&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re giving up XHTML conformance.\n\nIn terms of dealing with the issue of where exactly a website is located\n (such as a domain, or many &quot;directory&quot; levels deep into a domain), why\ndoes it even matter?  Perhaps we could instead define a &quot;Resource\nCollection&quot; as being the root of a URL, or a &quot;subdirectory&quot; from that\nurl--side stepping the question of what a web site is, and where it is\nlocated.\n\nI&#39;ve also run across a few more glaringly obvious in-the-wild examples\nof &quot;cowpaths&quot;\n\n&lt;resource-collection&gt;/images\n&lt;resource-collection&gt;/css\n\n\n\n"}}
