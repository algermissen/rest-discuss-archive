Welcome to rest-discuss!  ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Here, the archives are full of list regulars being told directly by the\n&gt; likes of Roy and Mark dozens of times that we&#39;re wrong.  Gradually,\n&gt; this group has become _the_ place to get schooled on REST as intended\n&gt; by Fielding.  There, I don&#39;t see many answers from those who&#39;ve put\n&gt; their knowledge to the test, here.  What I do see are attempts to define\n&gt; REST in terms of implementation rather than style, i.e. Wikipedia REST,\n&gt; not Fielding REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; So pick the place that best suits your needs -- there if you want\n&gt; implementation, here if you want architecture; there is a difference,\n&gt; which comes down to the proportion of answers from those who&#39;ve been\n&gt; &quot;vetted&quot; by Roy (and Mark, and others) over the years, and understand\n&gt; REST as an architectural style as opposed to implementation guidelines.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just my two cents.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n\n"}}
