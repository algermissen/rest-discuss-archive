And the\n&gt; second. And parts of the others too...\n&gt;\n&gt; However, and I di=\r\ndn&#39;t want to say this because its going to piss people\n&gt; here and it is not=\r\n that my intention, and also because it&#39;s just my feeling\n&gt; and I dont have=\r\n evidence to support it, I suspect that it was this &quot;purist&quot;\n&gt; approach tha=\r\nt drove all those auto-denomitade REST frameworks to simply\n&gt; ignore the fu=\r\nndamentals and go with the REST moniker all the same. Because\n&gt; if what the=\r\n experts only say is &quot;if you don&#39;t apply this then its no REST&quot;\n&gt; without a=\r\n sound explanation of the why&#39;s, they probaly follow the easy path\n&gt; of app=\r\nlyng what they can, leave the rest, and still call it REST because of\n&gt; mar=\r\nket reasons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now if the experts instead of just repeating that, could c=\r\nome with a\n&gt; sensible explanation of what each constraint gives, and most i=\r\nmportant, what\n&gt; the system looses for each constraint dropped or relaxed -=\r\n instead of\n&gt; immediatly say &quot;its not REST, call it other thing&quot; - maybe a =\r\neffort of\n&gt; classification like the one &quot;Type I, Type II...&quot; (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m=\r\n on my\n&gt; mobile, is hard to google for it) would be generalized enough as t=\r\no be\n&gt; accepted by the industry, and we could have a REST Maturity Model (I=\r\n think\n&gt; it was that&#39;s called) that inequivocly said that REST Type I is no=\r\nt fully\n&gt; REST because misses constraint A,B,C and REST Type II misses cons=\r\ntraint X,\n&gt; and REST Type V, or whatever, does indeed follow all the constr=\r\naints and\n&gt; thus indeed complies with Roy thesis.\n&gt;\n&gt; And if that was recog=\r\nnalizable and accepted by the industry maybe companies\n&gt; will had the hones=\r\nty of explicitly call their applications to conform with\n&gt; REST Type I, whe=\r\nre everibody knew a priori what that means. And they still\n&gt; have the marke=\r\nting buzzword...  They could even leverage that marketing tool\n&gt; - mine is =\r\nmore Restfull then yours - or present thenselves as the good guys\n&gt; - our a=\r\npplication is REST Type II but we aim to turn it fully REST in the\n&gt; next m=\r\nonths and the upgrade will be only a small fee...\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead, what do we h=\r\nave? Confusion!!! Companies claiming its REST, experts\n&gt; claiming its no, c=\r\nompanies not giving a crap to what the experts say... All\n&gt; this because th=\r\ne all-or-nothing, don&#39;t call it REST attitude of the\n&gt; experts...\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t=\r\n get me wrong, I do care about REST, I do appreciate the experts, and\n&gt; wha=\r\nt I&#39;m saying does not have the single purpose of pissing them off as they\n&gt;=\r\n probably think it is. I just think more flexibility and clarity or\n&gt; trans=\r\nparencie will be good for everyone...\n&gt;\n&gt; But the truth is, it seems I&#39;m al=\r\nready hearing, I don&#39;t have years of rest,\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to redefine rest, I=\r\n&#39;m not willing to learn from what the  experts\n&gt; say, I&#39;m just criticising =\r\npeople who knows what they&#39;re talking about, I&#39;m\n&gt; not paying my respects t=\r\no the experts...\n&gt;\n&gt; But its not, I care, I really care :)\n&gt;\n&gt; On 20 Jul 20=\r\n10 23:11, &quot;Will Hartung&quot; &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I hear you Antoni=\r\no.\n&gt;\n&gt; But a core tenet (IMHO, not being one who &quot;knows what he&#39;s talking a=\r\nbout&quot;)\n&gt; of REST is the limitations and constraints imposed by it, and what=\r\n, by\n&gt; assuming those constraints, the system enables you to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s i=\r\nmportant, perhaps less now than in the past, to keep REST &quot;pure&quot; for\n&gt; a re=\r\nason. REST has been horribly muddied. Most feel that it&#39;s nothing more\n&gt; th=\r\nan POX over HTTP, as witnessed by the myriad of &quot;REST&quot; apis that have been\n=\r\n&gt; published, but really aren&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the adherents have been quite vocal=\r\n, rightly I think, to try and keep\n&gt; the term &quot;REST&quot; meaningful, and not lo=\r\nst.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is not like pornography, in that &quot;we know it when we see it&quot;, =\r\nbut\n&gt; otherwise can&#39;t describe it in detail. It has been described in detai=\r\nl. And\n&gt; the only way to measure its effectiveness, specifically, IMHO, in =\r\nB2B\n&gt; systems doing M2M transactions (i.e. not just &quot;browsers&quot; and &quot;the web=\r\n&quot;), is\n&gt; to see it practiced as described. That&#39;s the only way we can find =\r\nout if\n&gt; it&#39;s actually usable and useful (in that domain).\n&gt;\n&gt; So constrain=\r\nts are important, and calling out when discussion drifts from\n&gt; those const=\r\nraints is also important. Otherwise, really, it&#39;s just Stuff over\n&gt; HTTP. A=\r\nnd I don&#39;t think we need a dedicated list just for that.\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally, m=\r\nost here will be the first to admit that REST is not the only\n&gt; architectur=\r\ne, nor should it be the only architecture. Another reason to try\n&gt; and &quot;sta=\r\ny pure&quot; with the notions of REST. If what is needed for a specific\n&gt; system=\r\n does not &quot;work&quot; with the REST idiom, then by all means, finish your\n&gt; syst=\r\nem, but simply don&#39;t call it REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (wil=\r\nlh@...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e659f6f6db0027048bda86a3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;snip&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now if the experts instead of just repeating th=\r\nat, could come with a sensible explanation of what each constraint gives, a=\r\nnd most important, what the system looses for each constraint dropped or re=\r\nlaxed - instead of immediatly say &quot;its not REST, call it other thing&q=\r\nuot; - maybe a effort of classification like the one &quot;Type I, Type II.=\r\n..&quot; (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m on my mobile, is hard to google for it) wou=\r\nld be generalized enough as to be accepted by the industry, and we could ha=\r\nve a REST Maturity Model (I think it was that&#39;s called) that inequivocl=\r\ny said that REST Type I is not fully REST because misses constraint A,B,C a=\r\nnd REST Type II misses constraint X, and REST Type V, or whatever, does ind=\r\need follow all the constraints and thus indeed complies with Roy thesis.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/snip&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think you may know of the=\r\n Richardson Maturity Model [1].=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jan Algermissen=\r\n has also taken some time to devise a table for comparing various Web imple=\r\nmentations using a &quot;Type&quot; system[2].&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A =\r\nwhile back I summarized (bullet points, really)[3] the pros/cons of the var=\r\nious top-level REST constraints identified in Fielding&#39;s Dissertation[4=\r\n].=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The WS-REST Workshop @ WWW in Raliegh, NC th=\r\nis past April had a number of interesting papers on REST[5].

All this because the all-or-n=\r\nothing, don&#39;t call it REST attitude of the experts...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;=\r\nt get me wrong, I do care about REST, I do appreciate the experts, and what=\r\n I&#39;m saying does not have the single purpose of pissing them off as the=\r\ny probably think it is. I just think more flexibility and clarity or transp=\r\narencie will be good for everyone...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, it seems I&=\r\n#39;m already hearing, I don&#39;t have years of rest, I&#39;m trying to re=\r\ndefine rest, I&#39;m not willing to learn from what the=A0 experts say, I&#=\r\n39;m just criticising people who knows what they&#39;re talking about, I&#3=\r\n9;m not paying my respects to the experts...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But its not, I care, =\r\nI really care :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote t=\r\nype=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;On 20 Jul 2010 23:11, &quot;Will Hartung&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:willh@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;willh@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear you Antonio.=A0&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But a core tenet (IM=\r\nHO, not being one who &quot;knows what he&#39;s talking about&quot;) of RES=\r\nT is the limitations and constraints imposed by it, and what, by assuming t=\r\nhose constraints, the system enables you to do.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;It&#39;s important, perhaps less now than in the past, to keep REST &quot;=\r\npure&quot; for a reason. REST has been horribly muddied. Most feel that it&=\r\n#39;s nothing more than POX over HTTP, as witnessed by the myriad of &quot;=\r\nREST&quot; apis that have been published, but really aren&#39;t.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, the adherents have been quite vocal, rightly I think,=\r\n to try and keep the term &quot;REST&quot; meaningful, and not lost.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;REST is not like pornography, in that &quot;we know it w=\r\nhen we see it&quot;, but otherwise can&#39;t describe it in detail. It has =\r\nbeen described in detail. And the only way to measure its effectiveness, sp=\r\necifically, IMHO, in B2B systems doing M2M transactions (i.e. not just &quo=\r\nt;browsers&quot; and &quot;the web&quot;), is to see it practiced as descri=\r\nbed. That&#39;s the only way we can find out if it&#39;s actually usable an=\r\nd useful (in that domain).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So constraints are i=\r\nmportant, and calling out when discussion drifts from those constraints is =\r\nalso important. Otherwise, really, it&#39;s just Stuff over HTTP. And I don=\r\n&#39;t think we need a dedicated list just for that.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;And finally, most here will be the first to admit that REST is not th=\r\ne only architecture, nor should it be the only architecture. Another reason=\r\n to try and &quot;stay pure&quot; with the notions of REST. If what is need=\r\ned for a specific system does not &quot;work&quot; with the REST idiom, the=\r\nn by all means, finish your system, but simply don&#39;t call it REST.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Hartung&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:willh@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;willh@...&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blo=\r\nckquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0016e659f6f6db0027048bda86a3--\r\n\n"}}
