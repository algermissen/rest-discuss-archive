Sampson &lt;justin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Th=\r\nis page would appear to be a simple HTML\n&gt; representation of Joe&#39;s profile,=\r\n but clicking a little Edit button\n&gt; in the corner triggers some DOM tricks=\r\n to reconfigure the page to\n&gt; display a form for editing Joe&#39;s profile, wit=\r\nhout loading any\n&gt; other URL.\n\nThat&#39;s interesting. I have been thinking abo=\r\nut this kind of UI\nimplementation after I saw what they did in Gmail. :)\n\nS=\r\nome questions that have been running around my mind:\n\n1. javascript and on-=\r\nfly form creation\nIs there any js app framework that will simplify the job?=\r\n It will be\nhard to maintain when there are more forms in an application, i=\r\nf we\nhardcode those forms into client script.\n\nI have been thinking about u=\r\nsing AHAH. For example, to create the\nProfileEdit form on-fly, we first GET=\r\n a html representation of the\nform (from another URL), grab data from origi=\r\nnal Joe&#39;s Profile page &\nfill-in the fields using DOM tricks (by matching t=\r\nheir ids?), then\nreplace the page with the form. Or maybe we can fill-in th=\r\ne fields\nstraight away at server-side before sending the form to browser?\n\n=\r\n2. javascript and multi-level authorization\nUsing the same example, if we h=\r\nave 3 users, one is normal reader (no\nauthority to edit/delete the profile)=\r\n, one is the secretary (able to\nedit only) and the manager (authorized to e=\r\ndit/delete).\n\nHow do we manage the client-script so that the script does no=\r\nthing\nmore than what they need (or no script at all). For example, the\nsecr=\r\netary will receive a script with codes about edit ONLY, no\ndeletion part. I=\r\nt will be terrifying when an app needs to support up\nto N-level authorizati=\r\non. Or, it doesn&#39;t really matter, if we just\nsecure the object itself ( /pe=\r\nople/joe )?\n\nCheers,\n--\nTeo HuiMing (toydi)\n\n"}}
