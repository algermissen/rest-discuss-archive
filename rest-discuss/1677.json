Web came about because everyone added to\n&gt; it.  Much of current focus on web services came about because Dave Winer\n&gt; evangelized XML-RPC and everyone started adding to it.\n\nReally? What large-scale services depend on XML-RPC to the extent that\nthey do HTTP, FTP or SMTP? I don&#39;t think I have any mainstream software\nusing XML-RPC (or SOAP) on my computer at all.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, I can&#39;t say the same about REST.  All I see is a few\n&gt; whitepapers describing an abstraction of HTTP protocol which does not\n&gt; address the full range of web service applications.  Where are the REST\n&gt; equivalent of WSDL, UDDI, and XKMS specs?  \n\nDon, first you have to step back and ask whether WSDL, UDDI and XKMS are\ngood things. Then once you&#39;ve decided that, it makes sense to ask for\nequivalents. They aren&#39;t so there isn&#39;t. The issue should be a\nno-brainer for UDDI. Who do you know who is using UDDI? For what? \n\nFor WSDL, it is more subtle. Some days I think it might add to REST a\nlittle bit, but most days it doesn&#39;t seem to add much. I don&#39;t see it as\na flaw of REST that it simplifies problems to the extent that WSDL\nbecomes marginally useful at best.\n\nXKMS might be useful. I don&#39;t know anyone using XKMS so haven&#39;t had\nreason to reinvent it as REST yet. It looks like it uses as little of\nSOAP as possible.\n\n&gt; ... Where are the REST tools and\n&gt; libraries?  \n\nJ2EE and Expat are all you need for a &quot;REST toolkit and library.&quot; I&#39;m\nsorry to be so anticlimatic but the basic REST tools have been deployed\nfor around eight years now. It&#39;s pretty hard to do better when the\nindustry has already spent a *billion dollars* on REST toolkits.\n\nWhen Rael Dornfest wanted to build Meerkat he didn&#39;t go to Microsoft and\nask them for a toolkit. He just said: &quot;XML + RSS + HTTP = great app&quot;.\nThe same goes for other REST apps like pkg_add in OpenBSD or Microsoft\nExchange Server or Outlook Express. If the fact that people will build\napps without making a big deal about it means REST is a &quot;failure&quot; then\nyou&#39;re right, maybe it is doomed to fail.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; While it disturbs me to see complex SOAP messages bearing very little\n&gt; resemblance to the simple XML-RPC messages, I prefer SOAP over REST.\n\nI&#39;m curious, have you read the SOAP spec?\n\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
