This is an\n&gt; &gt; apples-to-oranges comparison (possible more like fruit-to-apples). \n&gt; &gt; There is no REST toolkit because REST is not an implementable \n&gt; &gt; specification, just an architectural style.  It seems to me that \n&gt; &gt; Dave&#39;s comments do nothing more than show he doesn&#39;t understand what \n&gt; &gt; REST is.  I would have given a bit more credit to his opinion if he \n&gt; &gt; had instead asked/answered why SOAP isn&#39;t RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the one hand, it is true that Dave doesn&#39;t understand what REST is.  \n&gt; On the other hand, he has been told what it is several times, and it\n&gt; would only take a willingness to read his own inbox to understand why\n&gt; the things he said are BS.  \n\nTruly bad arguments, especially when made by otherwise itnerllgient\npeople, come generally from fear rather than ignorance.\n\n&gt; In fact, I&#39;m sure as he was writing them, he knew what the\n&gt; counter-arguments were. But he sees everything in political terms and\n&gt; REST was not properly designed to be a political technology. \n\nThank heavens for that! Of course, if a major investment of your\nintellectual capital has been invested in politics, well ...\n\n&gt; It has an unweildy acronym and it is more about telling people to use\n&gt; stuff in the right way rather than selling them something new and\n&gt; improved.\n\nNothing wrong with the acronym! A &quot;rest&quot; is just what I want! A rest from\nall the hype, a rest from &quot;solutions&quot; that don&#39;t work, etc.\n\n&gt; &gt; REST doesn&#39;t make the things you use.  REST makes the things you use \n&gt; &gt; better.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
