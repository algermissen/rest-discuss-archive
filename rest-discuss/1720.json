This tends to be more of a user-agent\nissue, but still there needs to be the ability to hide or disable\nfunctionality that the current user cannot perform. A declarative mapping\nfrom resource permissions to functionality could be useful, but the user\nagent would need to be able to discover what the resource permissions are.\n\nHmm... if the resource permissions were available as a resource in their own\nright, then a user-agent could retrieve them and do the mapping as required.\nSounds vaguely plausible and is certainly RESTful is it not ?\n\n&gt;there are a lot of choices on how to implement permissions.\n\nIndeed there are, unfortunately none of which appear to be ideally suited to\nREST out of the box :-(\n\n\n&gt;There&#39;s something important in there somewhere...  permissions and\n&gt;subscriptions are tangled somehow.\n\nIf you think HTTP Events then the permissions are intimately tied to \nsubscriptions - if you don&#39;t have permission to access a resource then you \ncannot subscribe to it. The issue of the composite resources, i.e. the \n/site/changes resource is more problematic, the publisher would need to \nfilter notifications based on the subscribers permissions.\n\n&gt;These are the four foundations of\n&gt;applications I enjoy building - information, users, permissions and\n&gt;subscriptions - and they way you manage messages into or out of this system\n&gt;makes it a holistic system.\n\nIt&#39;s a concern that we as an industry need to keep on building users,\npermissions and subscriptions. Why have we still not\nstandardized/componentized these things sufficiently well that we can\nconcentrate on the information, which is where the real value and\nbenefits lie?\n\nRobert\n\nPS And why is it that my systems end up more as hole-istic rather\nthan holistic :-)\n\n\n"}}
