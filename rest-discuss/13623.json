In principal I  \n&gt; get the theoretical difference, but I think the examples you give  \n&gt; don&#39;t necessarily illustrate the point, and in one case confuses me.\n\nI&#39;m also struggling with the difference between application state and  \nserver state (which I assume is the same as &quot;resource state&quot;). Can  \nsomeone point me to a good definition of &quot;application state&quot;?\n\nWill some kinds of state never stop being &quot;application state&quot;, no  \nmatter how or where it&#39;s stored? If I were to move for instance  \ntypical session state into it&#39;s own resources, and treat those  \nresources as any regular resource in my application - will those  \nresources for some definitions of state still be application state  \n(and a violation of the stateless constraint)? Or does the fact that  \nI&#39;ve re-modelled it as resources make it resource state?\n\n&gt; Taking Bill&#39;s credit card transaction example, if the client  \n&gt; authorizes the server to charge the credit card and a record of that  \n&gt; charge is created, this means that the number of resources on the  \n&gt; server side will increase every time a client authorizes a charge to  \n&gt; its credit card.  What kind of state is this, application or service?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also looking at your pessimistic locking example, it seems to me  \n&gt; that the requirement to &quot;clean up&quot; locks on the server is not a  \n&gt; necessary requirement.  It should suffice to have the locks expire,  \n&gt; and to have the server ignore the presence of all expired locks.  It  \n&gt; seems to me that this could be done in a manner that would not  \n&gt; require the server to remember the state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you see why I am confused?  In reading your post, it seems that  \n&gt; the pessimistic lock example could be implemented in a style that  \n&gt; would not break the guidelines you suggested.  It also seems that in  \n&gt; the case of a credit card transaction authorization, according to  \n&gt; your example, that storing it as a resource would be simply be an  \n&gt; attempt to transfer what could be considered trying to convert  \n&gt; application state into service state.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am struggling with this concept, and would value any input you (or  \n&gt; anyone else) may have that would help to clarify this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course if the answer is simply &quot;restful statelessness means no  \n&gt; server side database dummy&quot; then I completely understand.  I hope  \n&gt; that isn&#39;t the answer however. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Sep 30, 2009 at 6:06 PM, Benjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@... \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill,\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are mine: http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2009/06/13#stateless\n&gt;\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/9/22 Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s my thoughts on the compatibility of Transactions and REST.  \n&gt; Maybe\n&gt; now you can see where I am coming from.\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com/2009/09/21/credit-cards-transactions-and-rest/\n&gt;\n\n--\nCheers,\nKristian\n\n"}}
