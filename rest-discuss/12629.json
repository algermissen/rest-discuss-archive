Practically speaking, wouldn&#39;t you (for the sake of the user) have to significantly constrain the UI?\n  For instance, you could create a bounded draggable area containing (drop target) nominees for a category and the (draggable) award for that category. This simple design decision eliminates the problem of deciding whether a user action was legal or not, because you just don&#39;t provide the user with illegal options.\n\n&gt; In other words, which one of the, say, 100 potential drop\n&gt; targets are \n&gt; really eligible, is a highly dynamic decision best left to\n&gt; the server. \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
