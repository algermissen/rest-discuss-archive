(Granted, Polyphonic C# is a re-hash of some \nthoughts that have been showing up in theory-land (the join-calculus \noffshoot of Milner&#39;s pi-calculus) and in language-land (some offshoots \nof O&#39;Caml) but this simplifies, unifies, and brings this to real-world \nprogrammers.\n\nBut I&#39;m concerned about it.  While it does tackle the coordination / \norchestration problem, it does so within the traditional framework of \ntype-specific interfaces / OOP.  I&#39;m worried that this might \nsignificantly increase coupling and impede composition.  It seems to \nmove counter to the nuevo-retro feel of e.g. REST and the newish \nemphasis on generic interfaces, composibility, and &quot;wide&quot; values.)  In \ncontrast, the pi-calculus lays groundwork for solving the coordination \nproblem while keeping coupling dynamic (potentially run-time \nconfigurable) and while explicitly emphasizing composition.  Linda, in \ncontrast, didn&#39;t have much to say about orchestration per se (states \nare implicitly captured in the history-driven use of the Linda \nsublanguage) but made decoupling in both time and space paramount.\n\nI&#39;m conflicted on this.  It sure does look new, neat, and useful.  But \nI&#39;m worried that it takes a fundamentally broken model and hides the \nwarts under a sexy new veneer --- tackling one rather smallish problem \nwhile actually exacerbating several other existing problems.\n\nExtending this idea to the Web would seem to me to be pushing down that \nnasty SOAP-RPC road.\n\nMaybe there&#39;s a way to capture this kind of declarative \ninterface-driven orchestration in something like Mark&#39;s RDF-Forms.\n\nJust musing out loud...\n\njb\n\nPS - mention of something called &quot;Web combinators&quot; in the refs in one \nof those.  Anybody here w/ first-hand info on this?  I can chase links, \nbut a paragraph summary of the above would be useful.  My guess is that \nit&#39;s nasty type-specific adaptoid stuff, no?\n\n\n\n"}}
