I&#39;d like to have a formal notation\nfor the protocol operations I&#39;m working on. The Z Notation is pretty\ngood since it gives me functions, typed variables, and sets -- which\nis not bad since RDF models are essentially sets and I think I can\ntreat protocol operations as functions.\n\nBut I&#39;d really like something more specific to the problem domain. I\nwill be spelling out the formalisms in the specification in terms of\nactual HTTP bits (headers, status codes, media types, etc.), but\nsomething formal would be really helpful. (For one thing, I can do\nformal manipulation of the sentences of a formal notation in a way I\ncan&#39;t do with strings like &quot;GET /model-uri HTTP/1.1&quot;.)\n\nHas anyone found anything that would work here?\n\nThanks,\nKendall Clark\n\n"}}
