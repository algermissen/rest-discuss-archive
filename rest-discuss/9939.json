I&#39;ll recommend it to people looking for information.\n\nAn aside:\n\nOne of the responses to the article raised what seems to be a standard \nobjection to REST-over-HTTP:  The &quot;parameters too big&quot; problem, wherein \nthe number of parameters needed to specify a URI for a resource exceeds \nthe practical limits of today&#39;s tools (*cough* IE). \n\nIt seems to me that the standard response to this should be that if the \namount of data needed for a query is that large and complicated, you \nmight well want to represent it as a resource in its own right with its \nown (small) URI anyway.  Certainly the example I saw recently of an \nimage search application, which requires an image as an examplar to base \na search on, seems to fall into this category.  Is this a reasonable answer?\n\nStefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve written an introductory article about REST for InfoQ:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction\n&gt;\n&gt; Feedback is most welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW: InfoQ is still looking for article contributions regarding REST,  \n&gt; Web-style, RESTful Web services (or whatever your favorite moniker for  \n&gt; &quot;using the Web as it&#39;s supposed to be used&quot; is).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
