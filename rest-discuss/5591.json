I still see  \nrf:indexedBy on your site[1]; is that by intention?\n\nWhat is the reason for adding rf:From and rf:method? Do they add  \ncapabilities not possible with Container, Indexable or Settable (are  \nthey intended to provide generic support for other methods, such as  \nDELETE or WATCH)?\n\nNow that you have removed the intent related parts, the genericity of  \nPOST is becoming very clear (all you know about the resource that you  \nsend your data to is that it supports POST accepts certain media  \ntypes. The shoe order example from the last version made it quite  \neasy (at least for me) to miss the implicit intent aspect.\n\nOTH...do you still think that the clients should/could base their  \nchoice of container on additional information about known containers  \n(such as their type)?\n\nIf not, what is your idea of how an application should communicate to  \na client where to send the show-orders and where to send refund  \nrequests for bad shoes?\n\nThanks.\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/indexedBy/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
