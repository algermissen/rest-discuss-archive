And\n&gt;also, I&#39;d like to point out that you can dereference URNs... various\n&gt;protocols do exist and are in use to do that. \n&gt;\nWell, many namespace names are URIs.  While there is some (much) debate, \nI think many don&#39;t expect to dereference a namespace name.\n\nThere seems to be a desire on some people&#39;s part to be able to say that \nif a URI uses a scheme that is dereferencable, the you must be able to \ndereference the URI.  Or conversely, if I have a name that I don&#39;t want \nto be dereferenced, then I shouldn&#39;t use a URI with a dereferencable \nscheme.  Personally, I don&#39;t understand the problem - a name is a name. \n Some will dereference, other will not.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I know the problem I&#39;m trying to solve is this: given a set of of HTTP\n&gt;resources, how can orthogonal &#39;metadata&#39; that real clients don&#39;t care\n&gt;about be associated with the resources in a clean, simple manner that\n&gt;doesn&#39;t involve radical alterations to the pre-existing web.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is another one I don&#39;t really understand (the general case, not \nyour specific problem).  How do you determine what is metadata and what \nis data?  (One person&#39;s metadata is another&#39;s data).  Why isnt a chunk \nof metadata for a resource just another resource?  And does it really \nmake sense to only allow the owner of a resource to provide metadata for \nthat resource.  To me, the question of how do I find metadata for a \nresource sounds a lot like &#39;how do i find out what resources point to \nthis resource?&#39;\n\n--Chuck\n\n&gt;- itdp\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, dave.cantrell@g... wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A URI, even an HTTP URI, that cannot be dereferenced nonetheless \n&gt;&gt;&gt;provides a unique name for an abstract resource that can be \n&gt;&gt;&gt;distinguished from all other names for resources.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yes, believe me I do get that point. :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Maybe I can re-phrase this somehow...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;REST is an architectural style for referencing resources across\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;HTTP, right?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So then, what good does &quot;urn:i-am-foo&quot; do me when I can&#39;t (a) GET\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;it, (b)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;POST to it, (c) PUT it, or (d) DELETE it? How do these URIs fit into the\n&gt;&gt;scope of REST?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Or are we talking about two different things?
