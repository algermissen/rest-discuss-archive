A response looks like a request, but without the first line -\nthe\n&gt; &gt; method and resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; No no, because what I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t have the request line, just\n&gt; the headers (unencapsulated) and body.  So content-type would be like\n&gt; application/xml, or whatever.  Not message/http.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure that would do what I want - but I can definitely see that it\nwould be useful.\nFor what I am trying to do - and there may be better ways of doing it - it\nseems that I need a request line (the URI and method).\nIf a server managing a collection of resources cannot receive inbound\nrequests, yet can fetch arbitrary data, how would receiving headers and body\nhelp service request upon that collection of resources? Maybe its a\ndifferent problem. What does your (response) body actually look like? Are\nyou doing client initiated retrieval of requests?\nColor me confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
