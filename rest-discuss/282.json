Idempotency means\nthat I need do nothing with GET and PUT because by definition, eleven\ndeliveries are the same as one. Locking, ordering, lost updates etc. are\nall orthogonal issues.\n\n&gt; You might want to call the protocol Reliable\n&gt; Delivery of POST requests.  But even then, you\n&gt; still need a semantic for delivery failure (which\n&gt; MAY happen).\n\nThe client will know if it failed to deliver. How coud the protocol\nhelp? You want an HTTP server to report to an HTTP client that the\nnetwork cable is unplugged?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
