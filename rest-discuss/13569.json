Some resources are hit counters that increment every time a client GETs them. Most web servers log every incoming request to a log file. These are side effects: the server state, and even the resource state, is changing in response to a GET request. But the client didn&#39;t ask for the side effects, and it&#39;s not responsible for them. A client should never make a GET or HEAD request just for the side effects, and the side effects should never be so big that the client might wish it hadn&#39;t made the request.&quot;\n&gt;   \n\nI don&#39;t agree with permitting a GET to affect resource state - it is ok \nfor a GET request to trigger an intermediary mechanism to update some \nother related resource (e.g. POST to a related hit counter resource), \nbut the state of the target resource should not be altered as a result \nof a GET request.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
