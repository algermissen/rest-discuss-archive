Patterns lack uniformity. There&#39;s an \nexisting specified mechanism. Someone might might write &quot;.jpeg&quot; or \n&quot;/jpeg&quot;. The server URLs need to be supported. The client code needs to \nbe supported. Supporting relation schemes for embedding in \nrepresentations are needed for linking to to avoid clients treating said \npatterns as APIs. Multiple such schemes are needed for each \nrepresentation type. That could be tricky for non-textual media. \nSemwebbers get into description/denotation headaches and need to write a \nlot of owl:sameAs (actually it wouldn&#39;t be same:As). A shadow \ndescription system to the media type is created. There&#39;s a history of \nbaking file names into URLs not working out well. These problems are \ncompounded as a function of how  well adopted such patterns become. URI \ntemplates are mostly fictional; they need to be extended to support \nmedia types. The eventual standard would probably look like content \nnegotiation, but maybe in XML.\n\nAll that said, for one&#39;s own site, file extensions will work. But it \nwill be for one&#39;s site. Which brings us back around to URI opacity, and \nuniformity.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
