Would it be possible to put the date of each\ndraft at the top so that we can tell when you&#39;ve made changes?\n\nThe DTD has a bad mixed content model for the documentation element (you\nneed a * at the end). Wouldn&#39;t making it ANY be easier? What if I want to\nuse DocBook for my documentation? (This is why I prefer a single annotation\nelement with a content model of ANY--I could then put multiple elements in\nthere with different names or attributes to indicate mediaType or language\nor anything else I wanted.)\n\nThe links to the Babelfish example and Python implementation are broken.\n\nRegarding the new namespace attribute on representationType elements: My\nfaith in being able to use namespaces to reliably identify a document is\nvery slim. I see them (as Patrick Stickler recently pointed out) as merely\npunctuation. The mediaType attribute seems much more capable of identifying\na representation. What would we use the namespace attribute for?\n\nRegarding the new schema elements: Do we really want to embed schemas in\nWRDL documents? Wouldn&#39;t it be more maintainable if we could reference them?\n\nRegarding the occurs attribute on reference elements: Should there be a way\nfor the generated proxies to require that a reference appears? I might\nsuggest regular expression-like values &quot;?&quot; for zero or one, &quot;*&quot; for zero or\nmore, and &quot;+&quot; for one or more. The absence of an occurs attribute could\nimply that only one reference is required (what happens if there&#39;s more than\none? Does it only match the first?). This makes it possible for proxies to\nthrow exceptions if a required reference is missng.\n\nRegarding the key attribute: You don&#39;t mention it but I assume that it&#39;s\nimplied, does the presence of a key attribute always indicate that multiple\nreferences are allowed? Would the occurs attribute then apply to the number\nof values that can be associated with each key?\n\nRegarding the type attribute on reference elements: The description is\nsomewhat vague. If I do a GET on a URI identified by a reference, is it like\ndoing a GET on a resourceType with the same name as the type attribute? What\nhappens when the type is missing? What would the proxy generator generate\nthen? Would it return something generic like a byte stream?\n\nHope this helps,\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
