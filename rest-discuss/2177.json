Seth wants to put\n&gt; himself at the movies, and that&#39;s not allowed.  Movies is the resource,\n&gt; Seth is the principal, PUT is the method, and NO is the answer,\n&gt; presumably because Seth is in the wrong *role*, if we&#39;re talking servlet\n&gt; authorization.\n\nThat&#39;s an excellent point!\n\nIf we split this into two questions:\n\nCan Seth Use Car?\nCan Seth Go To Movies?\n\nThen it&#39;s easier, because each resource (car, movies) controls their \ndestiny.  How would the car know whether or not I can go to the movies?\n\n&gt; state), then the application has to decide, via its business rules, whether\n&gt; he can drive to the movies.\n\nAnd I bet this is where distributed security models come in.  If the \nwhole system is wired together and very smart, the car could then pass \nthe PUT request all the way to the movie theatre.  If the movies said NO \nto Seth being there, the car could then say &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m not going to \ndrive you there&quot;.\n\nBTW your thoughts are excellent understand not only the security model \nbut REST in general.\n\nSo now the question becomes:\n\nSeth hasParent Mother\nMother grants Permission1\nPermission1 allowsActor Seth\nPermission1 allowsMethod Enter\nPermission1 allowsActee Store\n\nNow, who does Mother tell this Permission1 to?  We decided up above that \nthe car doesn&#39;t know/care about that.  In a real world, would Store \nallow Mother to PUT Permission1 there?  Or would Store delegate those \npermission questions back to Mother?\n\nWe can take this offline or drop this any time you want.  It&#39;s getting \nfuzzy but I think the lessons learned are excellent ones.\n\nThanks,\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms020501070206090507080302\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms020501070206090507080302--\r\n\n"}}
