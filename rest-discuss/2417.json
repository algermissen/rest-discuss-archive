REST, as I understand it, looks to\n&gt; &gt; have a more natural fit with the resource before-and-after state\n&gt; &gt; view. So does that mean that REST is in conflict with part of RFC\n&gt; &gt; 2616? If it is in conflict, is that a problem for REST, or is it the\n&gt; &gt; inevitable consequence of an inconsistency in RFC 2616?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, which part of 2616 do you think is in conflict with REST over\n&gt; the issue of idempotence?\n\nREST operates only in terms of resource/server state (ie. the resource \nbefore-and-after state view) and understands idempotence in only those \nterms. RFC 2616&#39;s understanding of idempotence seems to defined in \nterms of both resource/server state and client-visible results.\n\nThat means it&#39;s likely that there will be cases which are idempotent \naccording to REST, but not according to RFC 2616 (and possibly vice \nversa). My proof that on the resource/server state view (which I take \nto be the REST view) all sequences of idempotent requests are \nidempotent sequences looks like being an example because it rules out a \npossibility explictly mentioned by RFC 2616.\n\nIt could be that RFC 2616 is wrong to suggest the possiblity of \nnon-idempotent sequences of idempotent methods. OTOH, it could mean \nthat there&#39;s a disconnect with REST, and that RFC 2616 really does mean \nto include client visible results in it&#39;s definition of idempotence \n(tho&#39; if that&#39;s the case there are some delicate issues with client \nvisible results of PUT and DELETE).\n\nI&#39;d like to know which. If nothing else, it&#39;d make implementing HTTP/1.1 \nrequest piplining a lot easier if the REST view is right.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
