Hence, I&#39;ve got URIs like:\n&gt;\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=editor-xhtml\n\ni just thought i would chime in and mention that i am using a similar \ntechnique for web editing interfaces.  i have found that it doesn&#39;t \nmake sense to have only a form-oriented HTML representation because \ne.g. drop-downs are problematic (read: impossible) to use hyperlinks \nwith, and a pure HTML representation (with no form HTML) doesn&#39;t let \nyou do any editing unless you&#39;re running some fringe client agent like \namaya.\n\nso i have a HTML representation, and put the form-HTML representation \nin a seperate resource.  i look at the form as a subordinate resource \nrather than just another representation.\n\ni would be interested in hearing what others think of this, pros/cons \netc.  my original thought process was that HTML forms don&#39;t have their \nown mime-type, (e.g. text/html+forms) so conneg was not an option.  \n&lt;shrug&gt;\n\nso i would have something like:\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33/form\n\na GET on this gets you a HTML page with a form rather than &#39;normal&#39; \nHTML; this form&#39;s target attribute is set to\n\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33\n\nthe form does a POST but i pre-process this on the server to actually \nmean PUT.\n\n&gt; /~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rdf-factset\n&gt;\n&gt; This allows all of these things to be directly accessed by simply\n&gt; GETting them, rather than having to dip into conneg.  AND it works well\n&gt; for alternate representations that have some associated functionality,\n&gt; beyond just this or that static format.\n\ni was going to suggest that perhaps &quot;Content-type&quot; or something would \nbe a better name than &quot;repr&quot; but deja-vu tells me this has come up on \nthis list before.\n\noff-topic tangent: try\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=rest-discuss+Content-type+Vincent\ngoogle doesn&#39;t seem to have crawled any archives of rest-discuss; \nbummer.  sometimes i hate yahoo groups.  i wonder whether the archives \nare hidden from crawlers behind their ads.\n\ni do think its important that people use standard attribute name/values \nfor this though.  otherwise interoperability will suffer big time, IMHO.\n\n\n"}}
