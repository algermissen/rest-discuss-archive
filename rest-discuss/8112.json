Support for OPTIONS is extreemly sketchy,\n&gt; \n&gt; So MOVE is right out.\n\nThe proposal that started this thread did a PUT+DELETE instead if MOVE. \nSo it was using DELETE already.\n\nI&#39;ve been doing customer support for a WebDAV server for several years \nnow, and I honestly never had a problem because of a broken proxy (there \nwere case where methods were disabled on *purpose*, but that&#39;s a \ndifferent story). I believe you that those proxies do exist, but maybe \nthey aren&#39;t anyway as widely deployed anymore as you think. And in the \nworst case, using HTTPS gets you around that.\n\nI do expect that with deployment of the APP we will see more evidence of \nrestricted proxies, servers, firewalls and client libraries. That will \nbe interesting to watch.\n\n&gt; Maybe a move would be as simple as a POST to a resource with a\n&gt; specified Location header expecting a 301; eg:\n&gt; \n&gt;    POST /sourceresource HTTP/1.1\n&gt;    Location: /destresource\n&gt;    =&gt; 301\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t that all you&#39;d need? \n&gt; \n&gt; It would be supported by most clients, most servers and most\n&gt; intermediaries.\n\nHow would a client ever know without out-of-band information that a POST \nwithout request body is a move operation? And since when is Location a \nrequest header?\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
