It is business-level \n&gt; but should be done quickly and automatically and the contents can be \n&gt; stereotyped.  It may require non-repudiation of receipt (e.g. digital \n&gt; signature).  The contents would be archived in a transaction log, \n&gt; which I think should be part of the resource model.\n&gt; \n&gt; There could be other complications, too, but I&#39;ll spare you for now.\n\nOk, so let&#39;s say we have this resource which is the thing that is\nbeing negotiated for;\n\nhttp://company1.com/thing\n\nSo company2 becomes aware of this thing, and wants to make an offer for\nit.  So it does a GET on that URI and retrieves some RDF asserting that\nit is of type http://stds.org/product.  company2 knows this means that\nit can submit an offer document to that URI, so it puts one together and\nPOSTs it there.  company1&#39;s software receives the offer, and can do\none of two things;\n\n- respond with an &quot;Acceptance&quot; document immediately\n- respond with an &quot;Ack&quot; document, which includes a URI that refers\nto the Acceptance or Rejection document in the future.\n\nHow&#39;s that?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
