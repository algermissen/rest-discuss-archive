If you define a media type for =\r\na service, i.e. so &gt;that it can only describe the data and control options =\r\noffered by &gt;that one service, then a client that consumes that media type i=\r\ns &gt;obviously coupled to the service.\n\nNick -\n\nWhat does &quot;type of client&quot; re=\r\nally mean?
