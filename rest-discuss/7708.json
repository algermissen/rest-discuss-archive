Not having the parameter value, but having the 1234 determined\n&gt; by the server and then the client informed by the 303 response works well.\n\nI was entailing a POST to /items would create a 201 (&#39;created&#39;) with\nan ETag of either the redirect URL or the resource identifier\n(although none feels &quot;best&quot; to me). If I do a 303 on the /items URL\nthen that&#39;s saying the /items resource has moved permanently\nelsewhere?\n\n&gt;  Either is RESTful, since no particular relationship between\n&gt;  http://example.com/item/1234 and http://example.com/item is entailed.\n&gt;  However it can certainly be guessed at, so it seems better URI design to\n&gt;  have one &quot;up the path&quot; from the other, though using the plural in both\n&gt;  cases may make more sense http://example.com/items identifies the items\n&gt;  and http://example.com/items/1234 identifies that one of the items\n&gt;  numbered 1234.\n\nAgreed, and I&#39;m probably heading that way. The reason this question\ncame up was that applications might be trying to GET a /items/1234 to\ncheck if a session resource is still available with 404 for not\ncreated, 410 for lost/timed-out, or 200 if it&#39;s still there. If a 410\nis given, they could POST to the same URL again to put it back (200).\nI guess a POST is ok for 410 but not for 404 in this case. Hmm, maybe\nI should try to avoid that, and just allow another POST to the /items\nURL and use the session hash (1234) as a parameter to override the\ncreation of a new and instead use the one I know about. Thoughts?\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchymist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
