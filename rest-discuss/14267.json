For example: search, pick item, buy - the only way you  \n&gt;=\r\n can code that is by expecting, for example, buying to be available  \n&gt; fro=\r\nm the application state &#39;viewing item&#39;. \n\nPlease re-consider my media-type/=\r\ngoal approach. The machine client should not be driven by expectations of t=\r\nhe flow, it should not assume search+pick+buy is the one and only sequence.=\r\n It should not have a set of actions - it should have a set of goals. Achie=\r\nving those goals is then dependent on the returned ressources. This means t=\r\nhe server gets to decide the current state, not the client. The current sta=\r\nte is defined by the media-type/goal combination and the client only contro=\r\nls one of them.\n\nLets assume our client knows the new &quot;terrorist check&quot; med=\r\nia type. It has browsed to an item and so the current state is: mediatype=\r\n=3Ditem, goal=3Dbuy. The client decides the next step by looking for the &quot;b=\r\nuy&quot; relation - but the server decides the next state by returning a media t=\r\nype of it&#39;s own choice. The next state might be mediatype=3D&quot;terrorist chec=\r\nk&quot; or mediatype=3D&quot;order&quot; plus goal=3D&quot;buy&quot;.\n\nBut, yes, ultimately the mach=\r\nine client must be pre-configured with a knowledge of how to reach it&#39;s cur=\r\nrent goal given any of the media-types returned. But it should not be pre-c=\r\nonfigured with any assumptions about the exact workflow - the server decide=\r\ns the workflow, whereas the client decides the goals. \n\nSome Amazon items m=\r\nay require terrorist-checks, but some may not. Some items may require an ap=\r\nproval of a kind, some may not - it all depends on the current ressource ty=\r\npe, not an expectation of a precise workflow. This plus content negotiation=\r\n makes it possible to evolve the service as long you accept to teach your c=\r\nlient how to handle new ressource types (and that is actually RESTful).\n\n/J=\r\n=F8rn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
