Haven&#39;t read it in deep, just over read, and I see =\r\nfirst that we try the API as a normal RPC API to begin with. Then we go int=\r\no defining what we need, for instance a data structure, that is not more th=\r\nat a resource actual representation. \n\nAll that is fine for me, but I feel =\r\nit needs the mapping explanation. Since I come from the architectural side,=\r\n I would start by defining why we need the API, and how the API is RESTFull=\r\n in the REST sense. Then I may come with this regular API and explain what =\r\nchanges should I make to create a RESTFull one. Then I explain what the res=\r\nources would be (a data dictionary fits fine), and then the possible repres=\r\nentations (structure) and then etc. \n\nThis is more work, I know, and probab=\r\nly a developer wants to have the code to just copy paste, but if we intend =\r\nto teach about REST I would suggest to include the what (concept) and then =\r\nthe how (in dev terms). In other words, do not replace, add.\n\nWill read it =\r\nin calm and post more about it later.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares  \n=\r\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Tim Williams &lt;williamstw@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 2010/4/6 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re going to be pi=\r\nssed with me because I didn&#39;t even read the entire article (I&#39;ll do it at h=\r\nome\n&gt; &gt; tonigth) but after reading this sentence\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;this API will def=\r\nine a simple list management service.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and since I just said in ano=\r\nther post that IMO &quot;API&quot; and &quot;service&quot; should not be used to describe\n&gt; &gt; R=\r\nEST, I tried this simple semantic analysis\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; CTRL+F resource\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand no single result was found!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, should a description of a REST=\r\n-something have more emphasis in &quot;resources&quot; rather than\n&gt; &gt; &quot;services&quot;?
