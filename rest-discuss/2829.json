You have to close ALL browser\n&gt; windows to get it to forget the authentication.\nSame thing with cookies.\nTypical cookie based (distributed) apps send a response that has a cookie\nwith negative duration or something that signals the browser to delete the\ncookie. There should be a corresponding capability in the HTTP Auth\napproach.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the web browser had a statusbar icon (similar to\nthe\n&gt; lock for HTTPS) indicating that it was currently sending authentication\n&gt; information with each request?  Clicking on this icon would allow the user\nto\n&gt; &quot;manage&quot; their current logins, including an easy way to logout from a\ngiven\n&gt; site (where logout simply means no longer sending authentication\n&gt; information).\nGiving the users control over highly technical issues usually doesn&#39;t work.\nLet the web app author present to the user the most appropriate form for\n&#39;log out&#39;.\n\nOkay... sounds like everybody wants this.\nWho knows how to write a W3C NOTE?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
