Looks like we are going to be stuck \n&gt; with cookies for a long time.\n&gt; \n\n\nYes, they prefer a shiny new car that gets 10 miles a gallon and breaks \ndown every couple of days to a old clunker that runs great and causes \nlittle pain. I&#39;ve never understood that attitude. I do wish browser \nvendors and the W3C had spent a little more effort on addressing the \nminor, cosmetic issues with HTTP authentication, and perhaps enabling \nlogouts, instead of some of the pointless things they have wasted years on.\n\nThe effective abandonment of HTML at the W3C didn&#39;t help, nor did IE&#39;s \nstagnation, or the frequent lack of clue and feck among the other \nbrowser vendors. They&#39;re still \n&lt;http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/&gt; expending huge effort \non relatively trivial concerns. The low hanging fruit remains to be plucked.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
