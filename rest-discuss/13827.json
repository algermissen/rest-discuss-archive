You either need to track the\nconfirmation or  you don&#39;t.\n\nFor many systems, the fact that the resource is deleted implies confirmation.\n\nWhat it sounds like to me is that you&#39;re working on some user\ninterface aspect (i.e. the &quot;are you sure&quot; dialog), but you really\ndon&#39;t care whether they&#39;re sure or not. That&#39;s why this is &quot;an\nartificial resource&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s why a lot of systems do that confirmation solely in the client,\nit&#39;s not an aspect of the &quot;application&quot; API at all.\n\nBut you can look at the confirmation problem in the same light as a\nsecurity problem. The system needs confirmation that you are allowed\nto visit a resource. Typically this is done by granting the user a\ncredential that it can represent to the system to demonstrate the user\nhas the appropriate privilege.\n\nBy the same notion, you can make the users jump through the hoop of\ngetting a delete credential, however short lived it may be.\n\nBut, consider, there&#39;s nothing stopping a client from performing the\nproper actions to get that credential, and then forward that\ncredential to the system in order to delete a resource, and during\nthat operation, an actual User never needs to be prompted for the &quot;Hit\nOK to continue&quot;.\n\nSo, you can make the DELETE confirmation a first class concept in the\nunderlying API, so you can track those confirmations, or you can\nsimply add a confirmation step in to the interactive workflow, a step\nthat the DELETE operation is completely ignorant of.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
