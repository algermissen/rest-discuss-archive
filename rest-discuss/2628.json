On the second and subsequent DELETEs, there is no \n&gt; representation to un-map, so the side effect /cannot/ take place.  It \n&gt; seems impossible to me to maintain idempotence across requests 1 and \n&gt; 2 with DELETE, and impossible not to (as far as effects on the server \n&gt; go) on all requests &gt; 1.\n\nWhat&#39;s the problem? After one request the state of the universe is that \nthe resource does not exist and/or is unmapped. After ten requests, the \nresource does not exist and/or is unmapped. That&#39;s idempotence!\n\n &gt;...\n&gt; &quot;the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is the same as for a \n&gt; single request [ except in the case of DELETE, where N &gt; 1 ]&quot;\n\nThe *side effect* is the same. There is no resource. The response may be \ndifferent.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
