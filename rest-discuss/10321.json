Thos=\r\ne\n&gt; are:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Monitoring of all services\n&gt; - Traceability of all requests =\r\nmade by any client\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the &quot;feature&quot; that concerns me about such soluti=\r\non, and could influence\n&gt; me for the ESB solution, is the kind of support I=\r\n can get on public forums\n&gt; like this list. Although I have no doubt about =\r\nthe merits of this list, it\n&gt; is not a list devoted to &quot;implementation&quot;, as=\r\n is for instance the Mule user\n&gt; list, that would be probably our choice fo=\r\nr ESB.\n&gt;\n&gt; So bear with me again, but can someone shred some light these qu=\r\nestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is Monitoring/Traceability achievable with a &quot;REST + decentral=\r\nized,\n&gt; &quot;powerful&quot; end-points&quot; solution?\n\n-yes if you route via proxies (an=\r\nd the proxy has the ability to\ngenerate its own trusted SSL certs for inter=\r\ncepting HTTPS)\n-yes if you run REST over XMPP and then monitor at the XMPP =\r\nserver\nfarm (it has to be a farm, otherwise you have a single point of\nfail=\r\nure for your entity)\n\n-Steve\n\n"}}
