And\nyou probably want to give a *person* a clue about what&#39;s wrong -- the person\nmight be an end-user that another application displays an error message to,\nor it might be a developer who pours thru error logs or runs debuggers to\nfigure out what went wrong.\n\nSo, when I&#39;m doing this, I always include a description of the error in the\nresponse body, typically just plain ol&#39; HTML that can end up displayed to a\nuser. I can certainly imagine providing a smarter, machine-readable\ndescription for some remote non-human agent, but I haven&#39;t seen that in\naction.\n\n-Lee\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Lucas Gonze\n  To: Walden Mathews\n  Cc: lucas@... ; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Saturday, May 22, 2004 8:00 AM\n  Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] error numbers\n\n\n\n  Well, see, that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m frustrated here -- 4xx is for client\n  errors, but there aren&#39;t any 4xx status codes that express that meaning.\n\n  On Sat, 22 May 2004, Walden Mathews wrote:\n\n  &gt; Bad values in form arguments is client error: 4xx.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n  &gt; From: &quot;Lucas Gonze&quot; &lt;lgonze@...&gt;\n  &gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Sent: Friday, May 21, 2004 5:20 PM\n  &gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] error numbers\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; :\n  &gt; : I&#39;m building a restful api, and am finding that the response error\ncodes\n  &gt; : are all specific to http aspects of the transaction.
