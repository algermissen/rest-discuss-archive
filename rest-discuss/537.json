Before that, I&#39;d say they were most influenced by the deisre\nto support versioning a la VMS.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m not clear on their current use, and was a bit surprised\n&gt;to see 2396 say that each path segment could have its own parameters, so\n&gt;that you could get:\n&gt;  http://www.foo.com/bar;a=1;b=2/baz/bat.gif;g=5\n&gt;and so forth. If anyone could clear up the history here, I&#39;d be grateful.\n\nThink of it as an issue of precedence.  In almost all URL parsers,\nthe slash characters have precedence over any other character during\nroutine parsing of components.  The result is that the path is\nseparated into path segments before anything looks at the semicolons.\n\n&gt;With that in mind, a more HTTP-specific question: How should an\n&gt;origin server treat a request that includes parameters? Some trival\n&gt;testing suggests that current practice is to treat them as part of\n&gt;the path, so that an error is returned. Would it be better to have\n&gt;them ignore parameters that aren&#39;t understood?\n\nThat is entirely dependent on the nature of the resource.  A server\ncan interpret its own namespace however it wants.\n\nCheers,\n\n....Roy\n\n\n----- End forwarded message -----\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
