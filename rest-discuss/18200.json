Thanks a lot to everybody who has contributed! Hopefully you now under=\r\nstand the problem :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; The suggested solutions has been:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Mint a n=\r\new media type.\n&gt;\n&gt; Apparently there are two different schools here. Some sa=\r\ny, yes, go for a new media type. Some say, no don&#39;t. And there is no agreem=\r\nent upon which is best. See http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss=\r\n/message/18183 for a discussion of this.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Use different URIs for the =\r\ndifferent vocabularies.\n&gt;\n&gt; This seems like an easy and well understood sol=\r\nution. As Mike puts it: &quot;in my experience, attempts to do &quot;multiple things&quot;=\r\n while using the same URI are not often successful&quot; (meaning, &quot;go for multi=\r\nple URIs&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Switch on a media type parameter in the accept header (a=\r\ns for instance &quot;application/xhtml+xml;profile=3Dxxx&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; To me this seems=\r\n like the most elegant solution - if it works. Some people argue that the &quot;=\r\n;profile=3Dxxx&quot; parameter may get stripped by intermediaries in the network=\r\n. It has the advantages of minting a new media type, but none of the drawba=\r\ncks since it is still a well known media type (if this is the right interpr=\r\netation of the syntax!)\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) Switch on other headers like for instance th=\r\ne user-agent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not a generally used solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) Use all vocabularie=\r\ns in the same document.\n&gt;\n&gt; To me this seems too clumsy.\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
