It=\r\n is for monitoring purposes only. No payment-per-ID or throttling involved.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you have any thoughts or experiences doing something similar?\n\nIn m=\r\ny case we will have multiple installations of the same software\nclients acc=\r\nessing our API. My idea is to use User-Agent for\nidentifying the software a=\r\nnd its version but use Authentication header\nor possibly an application key=\r\n passed as a query parameter to identify\na specific client (instance or ins=\r\ntallation).\n\nIt seems there are three types of client identity that can be =\r\nrelevant\nfor an API to keep track of; software identity, software installat=\r\nion\nidentity and end user identity.
