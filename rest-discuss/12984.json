If it&#39;s a problem for you then recreate the cache when the first\nentries come in (but keep an eye out for clients breaking in the\ninterim when they get 404s).\n\n&gt; That&#39;s my point - if this makes sense, I consider the semantics of\n&gt; DELETE to be violated: The resource isn&#39;t deleted, its content is\n&gt; being replaced with an empty representation. Hence my preference for\n&gt; PUT.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that DELETE makes even more sense if\nyou&#39;re allowed to delete individual entries - why would you want to\nhave two completely different processes? Sure, if the cache is a blob\nyou could PUT an empty entity-body but then it makes even more sense\nto do a DELETE. Further, some of the POST proposals feel very RPC-like\nand require clients and servers to understand rules (which should\narguably be avoided).\n\n&gt; But admittedly the spec is pretty vague on this (&quot;The DELETE method\n&gt; requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the\n&gt; request-target.&quot;). To me, this means that the resource should be GONE,\n&gt; but YMMV.\n\nAs Mike just said, you&#39;re deleting the *resource*, not the identifier.\nThe thing that&#39;s not clear to me is what the spec wants us to do with\nthe subordinates (e.g. /cache/123)... I guess that&#39;s up to the\nimplementation (for example, if I DELETE an article I probably also\nwant to delete its dependencies - images and so on).\n\nIn any case I don&#39;t follow how you figure that PUT makes any sense in\nthis context.\n\nSam\n\n"}}
