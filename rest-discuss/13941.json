And there&#39;s no expectation that a web browser would\ndo that, is there?\n\nWith Firefox, if you use the in built RSS feed tool, it gives you a\nchoice of which format to read. I don&#39;t use it, but since you, the\nuser, are telling the browser what format you want, ideally it will\nask for that format. (I have no idea what it does to try and\nsubscribe).\n\nBut when I see what you have above, identical URLs with different\ntitles, clearly as a user if I click on either, I&#39;d get the same\nresult since the actual client (the browser in HTML link click mode)\nwill be pretty much mostly be interested in HTML, and that&#39;s what it\nwill ask for.\n\nIf you were building an automated client, then observation of the\npayload by a you (as human) will tell you where you can get an Atom\nfeed (it says so, documented in English), and ideally you&#39;ll ask for\nthat type explicitly.\n\nDo you want to add type information to the link to coerce the client\nto change its type?\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;My Blog Page (HTML)&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;&gt;My Blog Page (Atom)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDo you think that if you clicked on the second that the browser would\nview, or subscribe?\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
