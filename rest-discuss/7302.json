You would need an xforms p=\r\nrocessor on the client that\n&gt; &gt; allowed code to tweak form controls and sub=\r\nmit the form through an\nAPI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So instead of publishing URIs (or URI =\r\ntemplates) and schemas in a\n&gt; &gt; description of your resources/service you e=\r\nmbed forms in the resource\n&gt; &gt; content.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep. No WSDL needed. Schemas f=\r\nor the XML documents you plan to\n&gt; exchange: you do need some shared unders=\r\ntanding of the meanings of\n&gt; elements. But no, you don&#39;t need to declare th=\r\nat a certain URI accepts\n&gt; POST of documents of a certain type. The applica=\r\ntion itself will tell\n&gt; you what to POST.\n\nI find this idea very intriguing=\r\n and it has been slushing around my\nmind for a few weeks.  It&#39;s simple to i=\r\nmagine a form with a few fields\nthat either need to be filled out or select=\r\ned.  But what about\nservices that support submissions of variable length (i=\r\n.e. multiple\nrecords).  How would the form express that?\n\nIn other words, I=\r\n can see how the form can be generated from the\nschema (modulo input field =\r\ndescriptions), but I&#39;m not sure how to\ninfer the complete schema from a for=\r\nm.  Are there examples of this?\n\nWhile I&#39;m at it, has someone already creat=\r\ned a RelaxNG-to-Form\nconverter?  I have it currently on my drawing board fo=\r\nr our Dream\nservice infrastructure.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n- Steve\n\n\n"}}
