It turns out that WebDAV is not\nrequired to do distributed authoring, and its complexity means that it\nis not sufficient to do distributed authoring. In practice the web does\nperfectly well without COPY, MOVE, and even LOCK. They might appear on\ncursary analysis to be required, but we have plenty of existence proofs\non the web today that they are not. The WebDAV of today is little more\nthan an NFS alternative with little relationship to the web at large.\n\nI am an advocate of not dogmatically sticking to the classic four\nverbs[1][2][3]. I think there are cases where it is useful to try and\nextend the verb set in order to add new features to HTTP. I am, however,\na believer in using the verbs we have in use today wherever they are\napplicable. In the end, almost all new features will be able to collapse\ndown into the standard cut-and-paste verbs.\n\nBenjamin\n[1] http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2005/08/27#httpFunctionCall\n[2] http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2005/08/30#arbitraryMethods\n[3] http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2006/04/03#loHiREST\n\n\n"}}
