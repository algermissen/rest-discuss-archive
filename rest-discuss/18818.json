Maybe that is out of band knowle=\r\ndge, but then again,\n&gt; knowing what @method=3D&quot;POST&quot; means\n&gt; could be consi=\r\ndered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere\n&gt; and agreed t=\r\no.  So the sharing of the semantics\n&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  H=\r\nence a public link relations registry.\n&gt; It is the shared semantics that al=\r\nlows us to\n&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come ac=\r\nross a\n&gt; particular hypermedia construct.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe it is important that wh=\r\nen a GET is done on a resource, that the\n&gt; response metadata also declare t=\r\nhe available methods.\n&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.\n&gt;\n&gt; But you shou=\r\nld not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth,\n&gt; and the r=\r\nepresentation format has already\n&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (=\r\nin the instance in which you find\n&gt; the href) the (possibly implicit) metho=\r\nd availabilities.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the=\r\n relation the resource\n&gt;&gt; identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual=\r\n resource/uri/document.\n&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other in=\r\nformation, like saying\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use t=\r\nhe link&#39;s URI with a POST\n&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended =\r\nuse and it is a bad\n&gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems reasonable to me, I don&#39;t see=\r\n why it is a bad practice.

If we c=\r\nonsider the following\n&gt; two examples:\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as=\r\n &#39;http://relations.example.com/order&#39;\n&gt; reasonably conveys to the user-agen=\r\nt that there is something &#39;order&#39;-like at\n&gt; the target URI. It is then up t=\r\no the client (the client intent) to follow\n&gt; this rel (using an implicit GE=\r\nT request) to retrieve the representation of\n&gt; the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as r=\r\nendered in a specific media-type).\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;h=\r\nttp://relations.example.com/new&#39; to\n&gt; (unreasonably) convey that the user a=\r\ngent can POST an item of the type\n&gt; communicated by it&#39;s current context. T=\r\nhis is the problem, I don&#39;t need to\n&gt; &#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that it can P=\r\nOST at a specific URI, because the\n&gt; available HTTP methods tell me what I =\r\ncan do with the resource. What I need\n&gt; to do is examine the permitted meth=\r\nods (either by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39;\n&gt; header, or an OPTIONS request) A=\r\nND not try to convey the permutations of\n&gt; method in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does th=\r\nat make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot;\n&gt; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi ni=\r\nkonguy74!\n&gt;&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:\n&gt;&gt; 1. Links represent r=\r\nesources you can work with. The idea of links is that\n&gt;&gt; you can usually fo=\r\nllow them (issuing a GET operation), but then there are\n&gt;&gt; lots of question=\r\ns you may have about them: what do I do with the actual\n&gt;&gt; resource (say, w=\r\neb page) I&#39;m in? What is this link referring to? What\n&gt;&gt; other operations a=\r\npart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query\n&gt;&gt; parameters to it? W=\r\nhat media type will it return? What media type may it\n&gt;&gt; expect if I can is=\r\nsue a POST?, etc...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add more information ab=\r\nout a link. I denotes a\n&gt;&gt; value, keyword, hint of what relation the link h=\r\nas with the current\n&gt;&gt; resource/IRI. Say you are in a book page, that is yo=\r\nur current resources\n&gt;&gt; and it has a URI. A link with rel=3D&quot;next&quot; will hin=\r\nt that following that\n&gt;&gt; link will get you to the next page of the book.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relation the resou=\r\nrce\n&gt;&gt; identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual resource/uri/docum=\r\nent.\n&gt;&gt; It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, like say=\r\ning\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI with =\r\na POST\n&gt;&gt; to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your cl=\r\nient. If you are\n&gt;&gt; looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell y=\r\nou the links points\n&gt;&gt; to the actual blog post. Having that information, yo=\r\nu can start asking\n&gt;&gt; that parent for information, or even send a comment t=\r\no it using POST\n&gt;&gt; operation. That is natural simply because much of this i=\r\nnteraction is\n&gt;&gt; already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need =\r\nto be statically\n&gt;&gt; programmed, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 5. So,=\r\n you have there standard metainformation (like how to handle media\n&gt;&gt; types=\r\n, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc.\n&gt;&gt; Pl=\r\nus, you have business specific semantics (the actual value of the rel\n&gt;&gt; ma=\r\ny mean something applicable only to, say, banking applications). With\n&gt;&gt; th=\r\nat info you can program intelligent clients.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;=\r\nlink&quot; tags like anchor and image are special links\n&gt;&gt; that have a standard =\r\nmeaning and established processing. If you found an\n&gt;&gt; &lt;img&gt; tag you automa=\r\ntically know that link is referring to an image, and\n&gt;&gt; if you are in HTML =\r\npage in a browser, the supposed processing it to fetch\n&gt;&gt; that image with a=\r\n GET and display it based on context and additional\n&gt;&gt; attributes. All that=\r\n is told by the tag name, and everybody in the world\n&gt;&gt; knows it. So, links=\r\n are difficult to understand at first but once you have\n&gt;&gt; it clear they ar=\r\ne simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attribute\n&gt;&gt; will tell you =\r\neverything.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt;&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; O=\r\nn Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of t=\r\nhe first questions i had was on rel link.

This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - your user agent=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the way it is=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; programmed (or configured) to do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No magic.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The e=\r\nffect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; obliga=\r\ntions you have as a client side programmer (to react to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hypermedia=\r\n you actually come across instead of the one you presume to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; come acros=\r\ns) than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; REST mostly m=\r\nakes explicit that there isn&#39;t any control over the server\n&gt;&gt; &gt; side in net=\r\nworked systems.
