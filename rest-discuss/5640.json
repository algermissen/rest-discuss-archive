Its semantics are=\r\nn&#39;t necessarily grounded\n&gt; in universal concepts. On the other hand, text/h=\r\ntml is grounded in the\n&gt; universal text concept. Other forms of html (no ma=\r\ntter how they are\n&gt; categorised in any current perverted MIME) also contain=\r\n universal\n&gt; semantics. They are part of REST for me.\n\nAnother question jum=\r\nps into my mind about media type semantics.\n\nHow will you express this requ=\r\nest below in HTTP syntax:\n&quot;I prefer a ATOM formatted representation of the =\r\nblog entry with its\nURL: /foo/bar&quot;.\n\nNow, what about this:\n&quot;I prefer a hAto=\r\nm microformatted XHTML representation of the blog\nentry with its URL: /foo/=\r\nbar&quot;.\n\nWhen we are transferring representations, isn&#39;t it a good practice t=\r\no\nspecify exactly what media type we prefer to receive or what\ncontent-type=\r\n we sent? If not mistaken, some had advised not to use\n&quot;application/xml&quot; me=\r\ndia type while transferring a representation,\nsince it does not describe se=\r\nmantics about the representation.\n\nWithout the help of Forms (e.g RDForm, H=\r\nTML FORM etc) provided by\nservers, it seems to be important to state the &quot;s=\r\npecific&quot; accepted\nmedia-types, or else clients would have no clue what they=\r\n required to\nsend. For example, how will Server express that it accepts ATO=\r\nM\ndocument but not any other XML document formats?\n\nIn this case, when talk=\r\ning about &quot;universal semantics&quot;, do you mean a\ngood media-type should be wi=\r\ndely deployed, or recognized as standard\namong majority. Or do you mean med=\r\nia-type should be as general as\npossible even to sacrifice its capability o=\r\nf describing the semantics\nof a representation?\n\nThere is another overloadi=\r\nng situation, where we just use a single\n&quot;application/xml&quot; media type in co=\r\nmmunications, when we actually mean\nATOM, RSS or SOAP. The same thing which=\r\n bothering me is overloading\n&quot;text/html&quot; or &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; when we=\r\n actually means hAtom,\nhCard. The problem is Server could not inform Client=\r\n that it accepts\nhAtom and not other XHTML document.\n\nThis overloading conf=\r\nusion starts bothering when I attempt to use HTTP\nas publishing protocol fo=\r\nr microformats. How to post a hAtom when\nServer can&#39;t even express that it =\r\naccepts hAtom? I am certainly\nwalking on the wrong path. ;-)\n\nCheers,\n--\nTe=\r\no HuiMing (toydi)\nteohuiming.work at gmail dot com\n\n"}}
