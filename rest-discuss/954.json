There are a lot of people learning REST via the Wiki.

I have now marked the documents in question in\nthe following manner, at the top of the page:\n\n    Note:  THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS REST HERESY.\n\n&gt; But back to Jeff&#39;s ideas.  Ignoring the so-called dogma for the moment,\n&gt; here&#39;s a couple of very practical concerns.\n&gt;\n&gt; First, internationalization.\n\nIt&#39;s no more or less a problem here than it is in agreeing on XML tag name\nchoices in &quot;standardized&quot; schemas, etc., and then dealing with\ntransformations between language representations of tag name choices.\n\n&gt; You need a layer\n&gt; of indirection here, something to assert &quot;this URI is of this type&quot;.\n\nAs mentioned, the semantic information about what particular name elements\nneeds to be represented elsewhere.  I&#39;ll go further:  not only do complete\nURI need to be typed, but their parts need to be typed.\n\n&gt; Second, if my namespace already includes a &quot;/help&quot; - perhaps I use it\n&gt; as the name for my &quot;happy elves love partying&quot; resource - does that mean\n&gt; that I can&#39;t use the help/contact/search system?\n\nGood question.  The answer at first seems to be yes, and this seems to be a\nweakness.  The mechanism for avoiding this problem is the same as it is in\nXML:  introduce namespaces inside URI components to avoid collision.  But we\ndon&#39;t even have to do anything to introduce those;  the &#39;;&#39; property space\ndoes our job for us.  Instead of namestd:help you have help;namestd or what\nhave you.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
