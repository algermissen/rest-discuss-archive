The server returns a URL to\nthe\n&gt; newly created resource.\nIf you use PUT, then the URI you PUT to /is/ the created resource. It may be\npossible that some response headers to PUT provide for a more &#39;canonical&#39;\nlocation, but I don&#39;t know much about that.\nIf you use POST, then the server would/could return the URI of any new\nresource created.\n\n&gt; Later, we realize that we need to change a part of\n&gt; the resource, so we want to update only that part.  So why not just POST\nthe\n&gt; entire &quot;resource&quot; (the same that was PUT earlier, but now with the change)\n&gt; to the given URL for the resource?  The server can then compare them and\n&gt; determine if the change is allowed or not.\nSounds reasonable, but PUT means the same thing and is more specific.\nFor modifying portions of a resource, you could URI-ify those via sub-uris\nor &#39;segment parameters&#39;.\n\nFor example: &quot;property32&quot; could be the name of the shipping address of a PO\nor something.\nhttp://www.example.org/resources/resource27;property32/\nor\nhttp://www.example.org/resources/resource27/property32/\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As an alternative, when the original resource is PUT on the server, the\n&gt; server could return a series of URLs.  The first URL would be for the\n&gt; resource itself.  The additional URLs would be for different\nrepresentations\n&gt; of the resource that effectively allow limited interaction with parts of\nthe\n&gt; resource.  For instance, you may get a response like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;purchaseOrder&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;URL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345&lt;/URL&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;editable&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&lt;ShippingAddressURL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345/shipTo&lt;/Ship\n&gt; pingAddressURL&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&lt;ShippingMethodURL&gt;http://sample.com/path/purchaseOrders/12345/shipVia&lt;/Ship\n&gt; pingMethodURL&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/editable&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/purchaseOrder&gt;\nSure. I&#39;d use POST, and relative URIs but the concept is sound. You might\neven be able to &#39;annotate&#39; existing PO schemas with href attributes and not\nhave to invent too much on your own.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, you could POST to any of the above URLs the parts that you want to\n&gt; update.\nPUT may make more sense. PUT = set, POST = add/extend/remove/etc.\n\n&gt; If the requested update is in the shipping address only, then you\n&gt; could use &lt;ShippingAddressURL&gt; and send only that part of the\npurchaseOrder.\n&gt; This technique would allow each business to determine how much or how\nlittle\n&gt; of the resource can be edited simply by returning only the URLs that allow\n&gt; editing.\nVery nice. Or provide the URI - so people can &#39;get&#39; - but have permissions\nfor the other operations.\n\n&gt; Of course, this technique is that it requires both parties to know\n&gt; a common vocabulary, which may or may not be a good thing.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Or has all of this been covered already?  :)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
