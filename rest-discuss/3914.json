For example, it is meaningful to talk \nabout POSTing a log-entry to a log-file because we understand that \nlog-entry can be a subordinate of a logfile (even if the log-entry never \ngets its own URI).\n\nIn contrast, I&#39;m still waiting for you to explain how an RNA notification \nis subordinate to an RNA inbox.  Is it subordinate &quot;in the same way that a \nfile is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is \nsubordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is \nsubordinate to a database?&quot;  Unless you define what an inbox is, you can&#39;t \nreally POST to it.\n\nAnd, my more general point is, once you define what an inbox is, you don&#39;t \nneed specifically to document POST as it is defined entirely by the \nsemantics of RFC2616 and your definition of an inbox.\n\n&gt; Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.\n\nThere is no way to violate the semantics of POST under this interpretation; \nit has no meaning.  If POST means nothing in particular, why not use \nanother verb name?  At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED \nto determine whether or not the resource has the behavior you expect from \nyour method.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

For reference (RFC2616 9.5):\n&gt;\n&gt;     The POST method is used to request that the origin\n&gt;     server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a\n&gt;     new subordinate of the resource identified by the\n&gt;     Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that this does not say that the request entity is a &quot;subordinate\n&gt; resource&quot;.  It only says that it is &quot;a new suboridnate of the resource&quot;.\n&gt; Though some may disagree, that&#39;s a world of difference.  POST never once\n&gt; claims that the request entity is a resource.  All it claims is that the\n&gt; target resource can make a resource out of the request entity.  This is\n&gt; evident by the variety of functions that POST can handle:\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Annotation of existing resources;\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,\n&gt;       mailing list, or similar group of articles;\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Providing a block of data, such as the result of\n&gt;       submitting a form, to a data-handling process;\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Extending a database through an append operation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Make special note of the third example.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, the POST definition also says:\n&gt;\n&gt;     The actual function performed by the POST method is\n&gt;     determined by the server and is usually dependent on\n&gt;     the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to\n&gt;     that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to\n&gt;     a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate\n&gt;     to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n&gt;     subordinate to a database.\n&gt;\n&gt; When trying to clarify what the definition means by &quot;subordinate&quot;, it\n&gt; focuses on easily visualizable concepts where &quot;subordination&quot; is already a\n&gt; well-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive\n&gt; clarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is\n&gt; that the request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other way\n&gt; around. A record cannot insert itself into a database, the database must\n&gt; insert a record into itself.  The same can be said for file/directories\n&gt; and articles/newsgroups.\n&gt;\n&gt; The next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not\n&gt; itself treat the request entity as a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;     The action performed by the POST method might not\n&gt;     result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In\n&gt;     this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the\n&gt;     appropriate response status, depending on whether or\n&gt;     not the response includes an entity that describes\n&gt;     the result.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also, I\n&gt; would argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid\n&gt; response, but that&#39;s a minor issue.)\n&gt;\n&gt; And the last relevant part of the specification is:\n&gt;\n&gt;     If a resource has been created on the origin server,\n&gt;     the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain\n&gt;     an entity which describes the status of the request\n&gt;     and refers to the new resource, and a Location header\n&gt;     (see section 14.30).\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity to a\n&gt; resource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to the\n&gt; definition, the response entity is the &quot;status&quot; of the request, not a\n&gt; representation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even if\n&gt; the POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST itself\n&gt; is still nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In\n&gt; other words, the response is still just the output of the target resource\n&gt; function based on the input.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And that&#39;s it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of\n&gt; additional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.  Boring, but\n&gt; quite useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
