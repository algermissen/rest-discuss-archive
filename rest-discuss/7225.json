But unless you can generate the WADL from the HTTP you would\nstill be saying things twice.\n\nI guess if the WADL could generate server stubs (including OPTIONS\nreturning itself) that would be a good approach.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I would like to develop more tools based on the HTTP discovery process\n&gt;&gt; and the patterns that are being developed around REST. It would rely\n&gt;&gt; on a sort of duck-REST (if it looks like REST - it must be) approach\n&gt;&gt; but it would be interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you elaborate a bit more on these ideas?\n\nSure.\n\nIf RESTfull patterns are used then the whole of a service can be\nexposed RESTfully.\n\nWe know that GET can be exposed. POST is a bit more tricky and\nrequires the pattern:\n\n  POST to a resource\n  =&gt; get a new skeleton resource back\n\n  PUT updated state of resource back to new resource\n  =&gt; get your updated resource back\n\nIn effect it&#39;s like a 2 stage commit.\n\nIf this pattern is used then a discovery agent can walk through a\nRESTfull service learning about the interface and that knowledge can\nthen be used to derive a client (or another server).\n\n\n&gt; The WADL project already contains a wadl2java tools to generate client \n&gt; stubs: https://wadl.dev.java.net/wadl2java.html\n\nYep. But I&#39;m talking about generating from the interface itself.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
