That is, if successful, all\n&gt; resources are deleted, or if failed, none of the resources is\n&gt; deleted. Separate DELETE request one after the other can not  achieve\n&gt; this goal.\n&gt; \n\nOK, we each mean a different thing by &quot;atomic&quot;.  What you&#39;re suggesting\nisn&#39;t the sort of thing REST supports.  BDELETE can&#39;t even meet your\ngoal.  What you&#39;re after is a server behavior that the client can\ncontrol by sending instructions to the server.  Nothing wrong with\nthat, but that aspect of your API does deviate from REST, which isn&#39;t a\nsolution to every problem out there.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
