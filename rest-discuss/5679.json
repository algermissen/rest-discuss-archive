I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I \nu=\r\nsed REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database.\n\nOn the su=\r\nrface, looks like a good match but how do I use REST to make \nmultiple upda=\r\ntes in a single atomic operation? I can see how I&#39;d pull \nthe entry for bne=\r\nwport from a cache, but what about all the records \nwhose age is &gt; 37?\n\nWha=\r\nt about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC? \nLooks li=\r\nke the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records per server \ninteraction=\r\n and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I could solve it \nusing multiple RP=\r\nCs but alas, thats rarely the case.\n\nThere&#39;s also the atomic multiple updat=\r\ne issue. I see lots of \nadvantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data =\r\nserver protocol. \nHow do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, comm=\r\nit?\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
