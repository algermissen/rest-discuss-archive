If we can agree that there will be a need for multiple\n&gt; protocols then that&#39;s a good start.\n\nFor the most part, I don&#39;t.  I think one generic protocol will be most\nuseful, although I can believe that outliers will happen.\n\n&gt;&gt; At the implementation level, e.g. the internal workings of the\n&gt;&gt; participants, many variations will happen.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. But mixing and matching implementations that obey different\n&gt; protocols can cause problems, so the basic assumptions under which the\n&gt; participant works, e.g., do/undo, provisional/final, would still need to be\n&gt; available in meta-data for instance.\n\nWhy does the coordinator need to care whether a given participant is\nusing do/undo or provisional/final?\n\nAnd it certainly is not any business of any other participant&#39;s.\n\n&gt;&gt; For example, I think the same basic coordinator-participant\n&gt;&gt; interactions can happen for compensation or provisional-final\n&gt;&gt; patterns.  The participant can handle the two phases differently.\n&gt;\n&gt; Only if the participant knows the &quot;type&quot; of transaction in which it has been\n&gt; enlisted. For instance, enlisting a strictly ACID-based participant in a\n&gt; compensating transaction is not necessarily the most efficient thing to do.\n\nI don&#39;t think ACID rules work on the open Web, so I would leave those\nparticipants out of a RESTful transaction protocol by design.\n\n&gt; Did you ever take a look at the WS-CAF BP protocol :-) ? The genesis of that\n&gt; is very close to what you are outlining, though of course it may not have\n&gt; been as clearly articulated back then.\n\nI did, fairly deeply, back in the day, but remember it as more\ncomplicated than it should be for REST, I think.  Could look again if\nit comes back to life in RESTful guise.\n\nBTP is too complicated for REST, too.\n\nI liked Peter Furniss&#39;s dirt simple abstract protocol sketch, will try\nto find it again and post it.\n\n&gt; &quot;months&quot;? Did you come in towards the end ;-) ? I measure it in years!\n\n2001-2002, but I did not spend all of those two years in arguments.\n\n"}}
