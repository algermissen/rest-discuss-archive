Web researchers and engin=\r\neers working on API servers and clients\nWhat?   A full-day workshop on curr=\r\nent and future challenges for Web APIs and their interaction\nWhy?    Web AP=\r\nIs are more important than ever, yet many unsolved problems demand our atte=\r\nntion\nWhen?   Full-day workshop on 7 April 2014 =96 paper submissions befor=\r\ne 7 January (hard deadline)\nWhere?  At the WWW2014 conference in Seoul, Kor=\r\nea\n\n\nThousands of APIs exist and their number is growing tremendously, whil=\r\ne use cases become increasingly complex. In contrast to the human-oriented =\r\npart of the Web, Web APIs are designed to be used by machines. This makes i=\r\nssues surrounding their design and integration significantly different from=\r\n those of the traditional Web. However, this also enables the provisioning =\r\nof new added-value automated solutions on the Web.\nThe discussion surroundi=\r\nng Web APIs and RESTful services is often held outside of research communit=\r\nies. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners by providi=\r\nng an open discussion forum around the design and use of the programmable W=\r\neb. It is the principal venue for discussing latests findings and research =\r\nand development results around the issues, practices, and best principles s=\r\nurrounding Web APIs design and their use.\n\n\n# PRESSING TOPICS #\nWe especial=\r\nly welcome research and engineering work in the following areas:\n- developm=\r\nent of intelligent and generic Web API clients\n- dynamic combination of and=\r\n interactions between Web APIs\n- novel hypermedia-driven solutions\n- tackli=\r\nng the tremendous growth and heterogeneity of APIs\n- analysis and understan=\r\nding of the social and economic factors surrounding the development, use, a=\r\nnd adoption of Web APIs and mashups\n- novel solutions for the automated dis=\r\ncovery and profiling of Web APIs\n- novel technologies for facilitating the =\r\ndevelopment of mashups and services for the Web of Things\n- lessons learnt =\r\nfrom the deployment, maintenance and evolution of Web APIs and mashups\n\n\n# =\r\nALL TOPICS #\nIn addition to the topics above, this workshop is also open to=\r\n:\n- applications of the REST architectural style to novel domains\n- design =\r\npatterns and anti-patterns for Web APIs\n- automated Web API composition\n- i=\r\nnverted REST (REST for push events)\n- integration of pub/sub with REST\n- RE=\r\nST-compliant transaction models\n- frameworks for Web API implementation and=\r\n consumption\n- modeling Web APIs\n- resource design and granularity\n- evolut=\r\nion, versioning and extension of Web APIs\n- REST-protocols beyond HTTP\n\n\n# =\r\nDETAILS AND DEADLINES #\nWe welcome full papers (8 pages) and vision papers =\r\n(4 pages) in the WS-REST ACM template,\navailable at http://ws-rest.org/2014=\r\n/cfp.\n\nPaper submission:  Jan 7, 2014 through EasyChair\nNotification:      =\r\nFeb 4, 2014\nCamera-ready:      Feb 12, 2014\nWorkshop:          Apr 7, 2014 =\r\nat WWW2014 in Seoul, Korea\n\n\nWS-REST2014 is organized by:\n- Ruben Verborgh,=\r\n Ghent University =96 iMinds, Belgium\n- Thomas Steiner, Google Germany GmbH=\r\n, Germany\n- Carlos Pedrinaci, The Open University, UK\n\nThe WS-REST2014 prog=\r\nram committee consists of the following people (and a few more pending):\n- =\r\nJim Webber, Neo Technology\n- Steve Vinoski, Verivue\n- Steve Klabnik\n- Ivan =\r\nZuzak, GitHub\n- Joe Gregorio, Google\n- Mike Amundsen, Layer7\n- Stefan Tilko=\r\nv, innoQ\n- Benjamin Carlyle, Siemens\n- Vlad Stirbu, Nokia\n- Erik Wilde, EMC=\r\n\n- Rosa Alarc=F3n, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile\n- Cesare Pautas=\r\nso, University of Lugano\n- Stefan Dietze, L3S Research Center\n- Markus Lant=\r\nhaler, Graz University of Technology\n- Sylvia Schreier, FernUniversit=E4t i=\r\nn Hagen\n- Yves Lafon, W3C\n- Tomas Vitvar, Oracle\n\n\nGet the latest updates a=\r\nt http://ws-rest.org/2014/cfp or via @wsREST.\nDon&#39;t hesitate to e-mail us w=\r\nith questions or proposals.\n\n\nPlease consider a submission =96 we really lo=\r\nok forward to seeing your work!\n\n"}}
