So, it seems\n&gt; &gt; like the right thing is to have /Subscriptions return different content\n&gt; &gt; (representations) depending on user.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s a tradeoff, of course.  It&#39;s my understanding that many\n&gt; caches can&#39;t handle this type of use very well (though maybe it&#39;s\n&gt; improved).\n\nSo, the caches are built to only support negotiation on the Accept and\nAccept-* headers? The set of headers the cache looks at is built in? And\npresumably if the response Vary header specifies some other request header,\nthen the response isn&#39;t cached?\n\n&gt; &gt; But, is there some hard technical reason that makes limiting the range\n&gt; &gt; of Vary a requirement? I.e., if you allowed Vary response to indicate\n&gt; &gt; any header in the request (extension headers as well as request headers)\n&gt;\n&gt; Vary can name any header, even extension ones.  Just like Connection.\n\nSo, am I misreading the rfc: &quot; Field-names listed in Vary headers are those\nof request-headers.&quot;.  (Sect 14.3) Instead, you&#39;re saying that Vary can name\nany of the headers present in a request message? (sect 5)\n\n           Request       = Request-Line              ; Section 5.1\n                           *( general-header         ; Section 4.5\n                            | request-header         ; Section 5.3\n                            | entity-header )        ; Section 7.1\n                           CRLF\n                           [ message-body ]          ; Section 7.2\n\nSo, Vary can include anything from general-header + request-header +\nentity-header?\n\n(BTW, the def for Connection appears to allow any header from the message.)\n\nthanks,\nLee\n\n\n\n"}}
