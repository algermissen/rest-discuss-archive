However there may still be a need to state the period of\ntime in which a requester wants to receive that one notification.  For example,\nan expiration date in the request and/or response.\n\nSince this is a minor issue I don&#39;t want to get bogged down in it.  Here are the\noptions:\n1) no expiration date\n2) expiration specified by requester and either accepted or denied by the\nresponder.\n3) hoped-for expiration sent in request and actual expiration sent in response.\n\nI lean towards #1 but don&#39;t have strong feelings.  #3 is really not bad either.\n\nThere is a secondary issue, even more trivial than the first, which is what the\nstatus code should be in the case of #2 above when the responder denies a\nrequest based on expiration field value in the request.  I propose a new status\ncode, 418 &quot;Requested expiration unacceptable.&quot;  I can&#39;t think of any damage this\nwould cause, and extension codes are acceptable within the RFC.  The reason to\nhave a new status code is to allow clients to diagnose and repair the error.\n\nThe best reason to support #1 is that expiration is irrelevant nit picking at\nthis early stage, and just introduces complication.\n\nIn the interest of finishing with this not very interesting feature, up or down\nvotes for any of the above would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n"}}
