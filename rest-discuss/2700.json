Some clients can\nperform periodic queries against the server to obtain this data, these others\ncannot.\n\nOne idea would be to use some peer-to-peer protocol such as BXXP to alert that\nclass of client that new information was available, perhaps supplying them\nwith the URL in the message; that client could then GET the representation\nusing HTTP.\n\nObviously there are all the attendant scalability issues with EBI, but I can&#39;t\nsee how to avoid it in this circumstance.\n\nWhat does REST have to say about this class of problem?\n\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
