I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like the post to service, get an id, and then post back\n&gt; &gt; to the same service at an interval to get the response\n&gt; &gt; approach. We have a feature that was implemented like this\n&gt; &gt; and it is a pain. The polling thread wakes up every hour to\n&gt; &gt; check for results. It has a fair amount of complexity and\n&gt; &gt; wastes a lot of CPU (not that I&#39;m really counting). But I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; cool with the callback approach so it&#39;s a non issue next time.\n&gt; &gt; ##########\n\nThe one thing to remember with callbacks as you describe and REST is\nthat you&#39;re making the assumption that your client is also capable of\nrunning a webserver too.  With polling, you can have really thin clients\nwhich have very different operational capabilities than the server they\nconnect to without affecting the overall message delivery capabilities\nof your architecture.  In practice, you&#39;ve a lot of potential things\nthat can get in the way, and defeat some part of your loose coupling\nbenefits of async delivery, e.g. firewalls, software requirements, SLA\nrequirements, etc.  With &quot;pull&quot;, you don&#39;t have these constraints and\nyour architecture only needs to worry about the resources under your\ncontrol.\n\nWe&#39;ve done the polling client approach with everything from JavaScript,\nC# and Java to a Bourne shell script built using the curl command-line\nutility.  Mind you, these things just transfer the message, which is the\nimportant part, and then they may hand it off to an event-driven\nconsumer of the message for doing some real work or write it to a file\ndrop, or whatever for the next step in the processing chain.\n\nI guess the key point is that you can do asynchronous service\nimplementations over an inherently synchronous transport, but you just\nneed to make sure you have the right separation of concerns.\n\nCheers,\n\nast\n-- \nJoin me in Dubrovnik, Croatia on May 8-10th when I will be speaking at\nInfoSeCon 2006.
