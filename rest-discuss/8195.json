Problem \n&gt; solved :)\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, if there was no issue with id&#39;s getting lost then I see no \n&gt; problem in GETting it as long as it is clearly marked as not cacheable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Resources can change over time (the fact that time is a factor in REST \n&gt; is often neglected). Conceptually you have a resource that changes so \n&gt; quickly that it will never have the same representation from one GET to \n&gt; the next.\n\nThe difference being that a GET can&#39;t cause those resources to change in\nany significant way, but that&#39;s not to say that they can&#39;t change due to\nsome other stimulus, be it internal or external.\n\n&gt; The fact that it&#39;s the actual GET that causes this change to be apparent \n&gt; is just an implementation detail :)\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a tad facetious perhaps, but consider the case where each time \n&gt; the GET is done it calls into a UUID algorithm - you&#39;ve no side-effects \n&gt; from the GET, but you&#39;re still getting a different ID each time. \n&gt; Updating a sequence based on when a GET is done has the same effects. As \n&gt; far as the bytes on the wire are concerned, both just give you a \n&gt; different response each time.\n\nBut if the resource represents a counter, a GET updates that counter, and\nyou really, really care about each request giving a unique value, you&#39;re\nin trouble. The counter increment, in that context, becomes a non-trivial\nside-effect.\n\n&gt; If however the way in which the GET causes changes is important (e.g. \n&gt; it&#39;s important that items in the sequence aren&#39;t lost) then the nature \n&gt; of the side-effect becomes important, and GET ceases to be appropriate.\n\nBingo!\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
