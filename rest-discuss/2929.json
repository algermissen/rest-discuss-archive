REST is typified by HTTP/URI and \n&gt; SOA is typified by UDDI/WSDL/SOAP.  I&#39;m not exactly sure where XML-RPC \n&gt; fits in to this mix, probably in place of SOAP in the SOA stack.\n\nExcept that XML-RPC is hardly ever used with UDDI or WSDL.\n\n&gt; I think this would be a useful comparison to make.  I&#39;ve tried to \n&gt; broach this subject on the rest-discuss list before, but got slammed \n&gt; pretty hard because of the understandably REST-oriented view of the \n&gt; list.  Cananyone suggest an appropriate forum for such a discussion? \n&gt; Is there some mailing list where people would be willing to discuss \n&gt; the merits and shortcomings of both REST and SOA?  \n\nYou could try &quot;distributed objects&quot;.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to get into a war\n&gt; about this on the rest-discuss list because things would be pretty\n&gt; lopsided.  Maybe it would be worthwhile to start some kind of\n&gt; &quot;Machine-to-Machine Architectures for the Internet&quot; group on Yahoo to\n&gt; discuss this?  Topics like REST, SOA and Grid Computing could be\n&gt; discussed, with proponents of each approach and neutral people (like \n&gt; me) discussing the issues involved.  Or is this just too much of a \n&gt; religious issue for everyone?\n\nI would not be surprised if it continually degraded into flame wars but \nyou could give it a try.\n\nI&#39;ll start the flaming by saying that I have never understood, from even \nbefore I had heard of REST, why it makes sense to distinguish some \nresources as &quot;services&quot; and treat them differently than other resources. \n  Most of the justifications here:\n\n  http://www.developer.com/db/article.php/1010451\n\nseem illogical to me.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
