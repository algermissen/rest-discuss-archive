This is good, simple, and gets you a l=\r\nong way.\n\nBut is everything just CRUD? Isn&#39;t that too limiting? What about =\r\nsituations where CRUD isn&#39;t sophisticated enough or just doesn&#39;t fit with w=\r\nhat you&#39;re trying to do? I&#39;ve heard that everything that can be expressed i=\r\nn a RESTful URL, but I&#39;m not buying that.\n\nLike I said, I do believe in and=\r\n love REST, and that it covers a LOT of situations. But I don&#39;t think that =\r\nREST applies to everything.\n\nWhat do other people think?\n\nThanks.\n\nTom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
