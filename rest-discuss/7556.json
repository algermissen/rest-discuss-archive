GETting answers an XML document of the active\n&gt; configuration, PUTting a new one causes the server to reconfigure its\n&gt; mode of operation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the model and I hope adminstrators will like the\n&gt; curl-vi-curlMinusT cycle.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, does someone know of a browser plugin that could make this even\n&gt; nicer? Something that offers an edit button and an option to PUT the\n&gt; edited document? All my online searches have been to no avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Matthias\n\nSome time ago I was thinking about making a Firefox extension for that \n(+ some WebDAV features).
