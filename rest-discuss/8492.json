It&#39;s just that in order to do  \nso you need a blank node, ie an\nunnamed resource to describe it. The need for blank nodes suggests a  \nbadly architected web application\n(if you are looking at it from the REST perspective of course).  \nWhenever you have one resource that produced\nwidely varying representations for each user, then it is an  \nindication that there are a number of resources\nhiding behind that one resource. This is known to be the major  \ncriticism of SOAP btw.\n\n\nHenry\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As an example, try describing a web resource using RDF. If you find\n&gt; it difficult to do, it&#39;s probably that the application is badly\n&gt; architected.  So for example on dev.java.net all users have the same\n&gt; start page url\n&gt;\n&gt;          https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage\n&gt;\n&gt; so what is that page really naming? How is one going to describe it ?\n&gt; One needs to describe it using some blank node such as\n&gt;\n&gt;       [] :representationOf &lt;StartPage&gt;;\n&gt;          :ownedBy &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt;;\n&gt;          ....\n&gt;\n&gt; ie, there is no way to refer to the resource uniformly. The same is\n&gt; true of xmlrpc or soap messages.  Of course the correct way to set\n&gt; this up would be to give every person their own start page\n&gt;\n&gt;     @prefix sioc: &lt;http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns# &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;https://www.dev.java.net/people/bblfish&gt; a sioc:User ;\n&gt;                sioc:email &lt;mailto:henry.story@... &gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
