Added note to that effect.\n\n\n&gt; What does &quot;note: URL encoded body&quot; mean? Do you mean that you&#39;re running\n&gt; the URL encoding algorithm over the XML? Or that the XML is an\n&gt; approximation of something that really uses ampersands and semicolons?\n\nNot important -- removed that note.\n\n&gt; The stocks example is not clear on how the service decides when to send\n&gt; notifications. I think something more compelling would be to send a\n&gt; notification when the stock passes a floor or ceiling.\n\nAdded &quot;floor&quot; param.\n\n\n&gt; Is there a way to put some prose on each example describing the\n&gt; application?\n\nDone.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; At the bottom of the first page of &quot;Store and Forward&quot; you&#39;ve got the\n&gt; Responder responding to the Requester. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got a\n&gt; connection to each other, so I think that&#39;s a typo. It should be\n&gt; responding to the Email Service thingee.\n\nCorrect.  Fixed.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s about where I get lost\n&gt; in that whole example. Why do we need store and forward for this\n&gt; application? Here&#39;s where I would use store and forward. My laptop is\n&gt; going to be off the network so I ask a web service to contact me via a\n&gt; store and forward web service instead of directly.\n\nNeed to pick a better app.  Will do.\n\n\n&gt; But you have the requester (e.g. my laptop) contacting the responder\n&gt; through a store and forward service.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a graphical thing, is it possible to have the thing closest to the\n&gt; requester (end-user) always on the left hand side and the thing closest\n&gt; to the real service always on the right?\n\nTodo.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And maybe it would be cool if you could add a &quot;time passes&quot; bubble to\n&gt; differentiate the asynch parts from the sync parts.\n\n:)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A fundamental part of this is the mail-&gt;HTTP gateway. The important\n&gt; thing is that the mail software does the queuing, retry etc. But if the\n&gt; HTTP target of the message is offline is there a way for the &quot;Email\n&gt; service&quot; to let the MTA know that it has failed to deliver? I guess I\n&gt; don&#39;t know whether the &quot;email service&quot; is a separate process working\n&gt; through mail protocols or a milter or a thing pointed to from the\n&gt; .forward or ... Whatever it is, it needs to be able to translate HTTP\n&gt; failures into mail delivery failures.\n\nThese are good points.  I stopped short of that level of detail in order to hit\nthe main points first.\n\nThe thing that I am most concerned about is getting the REST modeling right.\n\n\n\n"}}
