I see nothing wrong with using Accept: to choose the\n&gt; representation you want - its much cleaner than using a filename,\n\nYet Accept: (and all header-based approaches) do nonetheless introduce \nanother namespace and a fair bit of complexity as well.  IFF the \nparticular representations in question can / should be regarded as \n&quot;first-class&quot; entities in their own right, distinguishing them from \neach other via different URI is certainly do-able.\n\nI&#39;m playing with this with a current application.  I&#39;ve got a mess of \nlittle resources, all of which have various representations.  This goes \nbeyond mere MIME type to functional types;  for example, a given piece \nof content might also have an &quot;editor&quot; representation which \nencapsulates the content in a Web-based interface for editing and \nsaving said content.  Hence, I&#39;ve got URIs like:\n\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=editor-xhtml\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=printable-xhtml\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rss2.0\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=xml-raw\n/~jbone/Journal/2003/03/01/33?repr=rdf-factset\n\nThis allows all of these things to be directly accessed by simply \nGETting them, rather than having to dip into conneg.  AND it works well \nfor alternate representations that have some associated functionality, \nbeyond just this or that static format.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
