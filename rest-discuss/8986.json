I really can&#39;t imagine MS, Sun and IBM accepting\n&gt; that the spec stack now built on top of SOAP should be unwound.\n\nWhat makes you think they have a choice?\n\nIf you look at the MS story, they are embracing it, admittedly by\nshowing how WCF can be tweaked to handle it.\n\nAs for IBM, well, they make lots of money off SOA, and so are fully\ncommitted to it as a concept. But at the same time. other players in\nthe enteprise -MS, Sun, BEA, oracle- must see that money and want a\nslice of it. If IBM can retain it by sticking with SOA, then REST is a\nway to level the playing field, just a SOAP was a response to EJB.\n\nSun are working on WADL, which leaves IBM as the odd one out. Yet they\nare deeply involved in Atom and such like, so parts of the company are\nready if/when the rest of the org changes direction.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
