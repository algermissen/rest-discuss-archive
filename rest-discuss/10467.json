So =\r\nthe question is how to provide this functionality in a\nRESTful way...\n\nWoul=\r\nd one create a resource &quot;validation&quot; and use the kind\n(username/email/passw=\r\nord) as subresource, so that there were URLs\nlike /validation/username/{use=\r\nrname}, /validation/email/{email} etc.\nthat would allow GET?\n\nOr would it b=\r\ne better to have it at s.th.\nlike /username/validation/{username}, /email/v=\r\nalidation/{email}\n\nAnd what were possible response status codes? I&#39;d think =\r\nthis could\nalways be 200, with more details in the response body, as even a=\r\n GET\nwith a username that is syntactically not correct would be a valid\nreq=\r\nuest. Or should 200 be only returned if everything is ok, and 400 if\nthe em=\r\nail address is not correct, and 409 if the username is already\ntaken?\n\nI fi=\r\nnd it really hard to model such operations as resources, just to\nmention th=\r\nis :)\n\nI&#39;m very thankful for any suggestions/advice!\n\nCheers,\nMartin\n\n\n\r\n--=-s7n5Gx0nan7geB7m7OIu\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.asc\r\nContent-Description: This is a digitally signed message part\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--=-s7n5Gx0nan7geB7m7OIu--\r\n\n"}}
