However, it is important to u=\r\nnderstand that you do *not* gain the system properties induced by REST if y=\r\nou violate a constraint. It is important to understand what the consequence=\r\ns of omitting a certain constraint are.\n\nSee my analysis: http://www.nordsc=\r\n.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html\n\n(Server currently down, ho=\r\npefully it reboots normally. Otherwise use google cache).\n\n&gt; As you said, i=\r\nf it&#39;s useful, use it. What&#39;s wrong with clarifying such an approach is not=\r\n, therefore, RESTful? By definition, it&#39;s not. But if it works, why do you =\r\ncare?\n\nI care because I am pretty sure that people usually propose some &quot;ha=\r\nlf-REST&quot; approach because they think doing REST is somehow difficult. I see=\r\n no burdon in applying Web architecture correctly. The only thing that need=\r\ns to happen that one must develop that different point of view regarding th=\r\ne design of networked applications.\n\nDoing &quot;Half-REST&quot; does not help that a=\r\nt all. In fact, it only makes the necessary shift of mind harder because it=\r\n causes the impression that the rest of REST is just a scientific excercise=\r\n.\n\nAnd: there is always the question whether it is really better to build a=\r\n half-REST system than it is to go with traditional RPC (given that the cou=\r\npling and complexity easily amounts to the same).\n\nThe consequence can be t=\r\nhat people in the end are disappointed by REST because it causes them the s=\r\name problems they set out to solve.\n\nThat is why I care and why I recommend=\r\n using REST as defined by Roy.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent from my iPhone\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jul =\r\n15, 2010, at 2:10 AM, Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m n=\r\not arguing again purity, actually I&#39;m not arguing against\n&gt;&gt; anything nor t=\r\nrying to start a discussion about it.
