Depending =\r\non your scenario that cost may be justified or not. HTML browsers have full=\r\n justification for this, and if you disagree that HTML forms were a good th=\r\ning then I&#39;ll just agree to disagree with you.\n\nI&#39;ll also disagree that imp=\r\nlementing form-based interaction has to be complicated. Be it in a markup w=\r\norld or a json world, those things can be built and extended fairly cheaply=\r\n, and that includes using a small subset of xforms as IanR has shown many t=\r\nimes.\n\nForms are a tool that has proven itself valuable for those that have=\r\n implemented them, for their scenarios, and blanket statements are helping =\r\nno one on this list or elsewhere implement anything that matches their need=\r\ns any better.\n\n\n________________________________________\nFrom: rest-discuss=\r\n@yahoogroups.com [rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] on behalf of Mike Kelly [mi=\r\nke@...]\nSent: 25 October 2011 18:29\nTo: Nick Gall\nCc: Glenn Block=\r\n; mike amundsen; rest-discuss; hypermedia-web@...\nSubject: Re:=\r\n [rest-discuss] Definition of a Hypermedia Client\n\nOn Tue, Oct 25, 2011 at =\r\n6:08 PM, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, Oct 25, 2011 at 1=\r\n2:54 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Oct 25, 2011 =\r\nat 5:43 PM, Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On Tue, Oct 25, 201=\r\n1 at 12:30 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the li=\r\nnk relations are dereferenceable URIs, you can use HTTP to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hint\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n to clients about the freshness of the semantics (i.e. with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cache-Con=\r\ntrol,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ETags, etc.)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Indeed.
