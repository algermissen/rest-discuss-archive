Here&#39;s an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel = &quot;royalhope.nhs.uk/linkrels/appointment/updateContactInfo&quot;\n&gt;        uri = &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I find the link relationship to be very specific, reducing the value\n&gt; of a uniform interface (a client would need to be familiar with this\n&gt; specific rel type). In addition, the naming of the rel type in the\n&gt; example looks suspiciously much like another place to put a method\n&gt; name.\n\nIt depends how this relation is defined (the actual name is meaningless). What the relation definition should do is to tell the client what the semantics of the target resource are. These semantics might include that a PUT to such a resource results in an update of something. This certainly makes not very much sense with PUT because PUT already means update.\n\nPersonally, I dislike such a design because it is (or at least looks like) yet another approach to give the usual OO-damaged developers what they think they need - instead of providing proper education.\n\nSo, +1 to your suspicions :-)\n\n\n&gt; I would be more comfortable with something like:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel = &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt;        type=&quot;vnd.contact.info&quot;\n&gt;        uri = &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n\n\nWhat the above is missing is the semantics of &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;. The correct way of doing it would be:\n\n&gt; &lt;link rel = &quot;royalhope.nhs.uk/linkrels/appointment/ContactInfo&quot;\n&gt;        uri = &quot;patients/jsmith/contactInfo&quot;/&gt;\n\nto tell the cient where the contact info resource is. Given that, the client already knows that a PUT will do the update - if the client allows it.\n\nThe &#39;edit&#39; link relation is used to tell clients where the single authorable resource is that should be used for a resource in question. For example, an Atom entry might appear in several collection s and thus have several member resources. The single one resource intended by the server for authoring can be linked to using the edit link.\n\nThe server could just as well acept a PUT to each member resource but redirect the PUT to the edit resource.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But, there some very smart people who have reviewed the article, so\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a good reason for that example being that way it is.\n\nI do not see one - I think it is bad design.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; It would be very interesting to hear your views on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; /niklas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
