I&#39;ve thought about this and believe I have  \n&gt; found a way to combine digest auth with my cookie/URL rewriting  \n&gt; approach that would give me the best of both worlds. In theory it  \n&gt; will work whether or not JavaScript and/or cookies are enabled in the  \n&gt; client.\n&gt;\n&gt; First, on rereading the Http Auth spec, I think there is a protocol  \n&gt; in place already that would cause the client to reprompt the user for  \n&gt; digest auth credentials. If you respond with a stale=false in the WWW- \n&gt; Authenticate header of your 401 response:\n&gt;\n&gt; ...If stale is FALSE, or anything other than TRUE, or the stale  \n&gt; directive is not present, the username and/or password are invalid,  \n&gt; and new values must be obtained.\n&gt;\n&gt; ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; So I believe that even though you have no way of logging the user off  \n&gt; the client, if you have a way to detect an expired authentication  \n&gt; session, you have a good chance of triggering the client&#39;s auth  \n&gt; dialog to show up again forcing the user to re-enter a username and  \n&gt; password. By combining digest auth with cookies/URL rewriting, I can  \n&gt; use the cookies/URL rewriting to detect an authentication session  \n&gt; timeout. That would satisfy me on that concern.\n\nHang on... you can do that with normal auth. Just send a 401 when you\nthink the timeout has occured.\n\nThe problem is that you can&#39;t stop the silly box from showing up. So\nwhen you want to end the session you send 401 and the login box shows\nup again and the user logs in again (because they&#39;re confused).\n\nThis could be solved by spec that added a new error code for ending\nthe session.\n\nI doubt that will happen (and hope it will not) because sessions are\nbad and we shouldn&#39;t add them to HTTP.\n\n\n\n&gt; On my concerns about a usable sign in form, I&#39;m thinking of sending a  \n&gt; page that starts out explaining that when they press on the &quot;Show  \n&gt; Sign In Dialog&quot; button, it will show a dialog and to put their Artima  \n&gt; ID in the User Name, etc... And I&#39;ll have links for Forgot Your  \n&gt; Password and Sign Up and so on that page. If JavaScript is enabled,  \n&gt; JS in the page will run that will replace the explanation and &quot;Show  \n&gt; Sign In Dialog&quot; button with the usual login form. JS will intercept  \n&gt; the submission, and do the HTTP auth behind the scenes. I expect the  \n&gt; vast majority of clients will have JS enabled.\n\nThis is the argument that I always have against HTTP auth when people\nlike Elliotte say that it is better than cookie auth.\n\nElliotte was quite rude about designers, suggesting that the ordinary\ndowntrodden user is simply confused by the design of authentication\nforms and there would be a usability revolution if only the awful\ndesigners would leave such things alone and use the superb, well\nthought out authentication mechanism that is included with the\nprotocol.\n\nWell of course he&#39;s right because the HTTP auth system is so well\nthought out that it doesn&#39;t include any way of creating authentication\ndetails. Ah, actually he&#39;s wrong isn&#39;t he?\n\nDo users really want one type of box for logging in and another type\nof box for registering? Designers know the value of lumping related\nfeatures together and making their use consistent. \n\n\n&gt; It sounds like this approach will make things much simpler while  \n&gt; meeting my requirements. So maybe HTTP auth is not so bad after all  \n&gt; so long as you know how to use it. But I will need to try it to find  \n&gt; out how well the theory will work in practice. Thanks for all of your  \n&gt; feedback.\n\nSeems very complicated to me.\n\nStill, as long as you thinks it&#39;s simple.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
