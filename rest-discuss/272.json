But no new HTTP infrastructure is needed, really.\n\n&gt; For Reliable delivery (a subcategory of Asynch), I\n&gt; would again rather rely on SMTP than HTTP.\n\nOkay.\n\n&gt; For the basic terrorist_or_not.com, HTTP is a\n&gt; great protocol, but, as we have seen, REST\n&gt; is not.\n\nYou want to run that through by me again?  REST is the overall architectural\nstyle of HTTP.  I don&#39;t see how you distinguish the two.\n\n&gt; For many applications, RPC (over HTTP) makes\n&gt; sense, but REST does not.\n\nIt only makes sense because you don&#39;t understand REST yet. ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
