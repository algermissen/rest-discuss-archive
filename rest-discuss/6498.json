In REST, on the other hand, you hav=\r\ne to go to one\n&gt;&gt; destination, the server, for all operations. That makes C=\r\nOM appear to\n&gt;&gt; follow object orientation more closely and easier to use, b=\r\nut I&#39;m not\n&gt;&gt; sure that&#39;s the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; In COM you get distribution, marsha=\r\nlling, serialisation and a few  \n&gt; other\n&gt; things. In REST you get distribu=\r\ntion - again the comparison isn&#39;t  \n&gt; quite\n&gt; right.\n\nThe issue here is tha=\r\nt the relationship between &quot;operation on an  \nobject&quot; and &quot;operation on a r=\r\nemote resource&quot; are not quite the same  \nthing. You can retrieve a represen=\r\ntation that incorporates many  \nindividual objects and/or associations betw=\r\neen them and/or other  \nremote objects (for instance, a weather feed that i=\r\nncorporates many  \nindividual timestep objects). You can perform multiple o=\r\nperations to  \nmanipulate the relationships between these objects, exclude =\r\nsome or  \nadd others, and submit a representation of the new state of affai=\r\nrs  \n(or even a representation of the delta) back to the server. There&#39;s  \n=\r\nnothing &quot;un-object-oriented&quot; about this, but you can clearly see that  \nthe=\r\nre are many operations on the objects themselves, yet only two  \noperations=\r\n on the remote resource. You can design the system  \neffectively to suit th=\r\ne granularity of the domain and the efficiency  \nand timing requirements of=\r\n the network-dependent operations.
