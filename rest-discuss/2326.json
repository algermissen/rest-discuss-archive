Embedding meaning in URIs can often be helpful, and\n&gt; improve application performance by avoiding the need for extra lookups\n&gt; in your code.  But this is outside of the scope of REST.\n\nBy definition.  But definitions are created by people, and people are \nfallible.\n\nOpaqueness is dogma, but it&#39;s not necessarily good engineering.  I \ndon&#39;t want to start another philosophical debate, but suffice to say \nthat there are times when embedding information in URI is the path of \nleast resistance (at worst) or perhaps even the best solution to the \nproblem.\n\nDogma evolves, and is (hopefully) eventually replaced by engineering \nand best practices.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
