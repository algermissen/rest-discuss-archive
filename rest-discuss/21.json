Does PUT\nhave a place in REST?\n\nMy instinct is that there is; while POST has the benefit of\nseparating the data and representations, there are times when it&#39;s\nbeneficial to say &quot;here&#39;s a representation; when people request this\nresource in the future, give it to them.&quot; Does having such a direct\nrelationship violate REST?\n\n\n\n[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2002Jan/0078.html\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 15, 2002 at 01:33:41PM -0800, Mark Nottingham wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve raised an issue [1] with the XForms WG regarding their lack of\n&gt; support for PUTing xml instance data.
