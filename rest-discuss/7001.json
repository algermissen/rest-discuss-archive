Both 1 and 3\n&gt; lead to safe results.\n&gt;\n&gt; But your statement was that you could not log-off. You can and it does\n&gt; not depend on the particular client. Logging-off without dialog box is\n&gt; client dependent.\n\nYou can&#39;t de-authenticate. You simply force the browser to\nre-authenticate. Not the same thing surely? Even if it has the same\nresult.\n\n\n&gt; The only scenario that is acceptable is that the customer is really,\n&gt; really logged off. Custom dialogs, non-standard interfaces, etc. make\n&gt; that unclear. A single dialog box that is the same accross all sites\n&gt; is the best solution.\n\nNo it isn&#39;t. Hardly anyone uses it because they don&#39;t like it. No\namount of architectural justification is going to work with the people\nwho hold the purse strings in development shops.\n\nHow many times have you sold browser based authentication to a client?\n\n\n&gt; It is exactly the same when people log-off there desktop, they also\n&gt; get a login prompt again.\n\nYes. But at least it looks nice.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
