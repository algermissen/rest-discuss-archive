REST is a description of the principles\nthat made the Web architecture so successful, and guidelines for keeping\nit that way. As we build more and more dynamic Web sites (that is, &quot;Web\napplications&quot; and &quot;Web services&quot;) we should keep in mind why the Web works\nin the first place. Too many Web applications and Web services are\nimplemented in total ignorance of the architecture of the Web itself,\nresulting in awkward, unscalable systems.\n\nThat&#39;s my take on it, anyway.\n\nJustin\n\n\nOn Thu, 13 Jan 2005, elseielstad wrote:\n\n&gt;   Ok, I haven&#39;t made it through the original disertation -- but I&#39;ve\n&gt; gone through some of the posts here -- and read up on the wiki -- I\n&gt; think I grok the basics of the REST concepts.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Am I correct in assuming that, the existing web-browser/web-server\n&gt; model are too limited to produce a real REST app -- because there is no\n&gt; mechanism available for resources to communicate...\n&gt; \n&gt; except through the client --and basic web-browsers don&#39;t have any\n&gt; mechanism to handle that sort of transaction.  ( that&#39;s not a bad thing\n&gt; - it just means that you need to understand that a &quot;RESTful&quot; client is\n&gt; not a typical web-browser-- but the REST resources can be talked to\n&gt; using web-protocols )\n&gt; \n&gt;    --erik\n\n\n"}}
