You don&#39;t right=\r\n?\n\nI would say that the best way to deal with robots would be to have the\nr=\r\nobot do content-neg on every page and for the correct content-neg\nresponse =\r\nto be the location of the robots.txt for that &quot;site&quot;. With\nevery request fo=\r\nr robot info the cache strikes will increase.\n\nBut I really don&#39;t expect th=\r\ne methodology to change. It is good\nenough. I think I&#39;ve said that quite a =\r\nfew times now.\n\n\n&gt; And then you will have to solve, what is a &quot;web site&quot;?\n&gt;=\r\n A web site is not a domain name.\n&gt; A web site is not an IP.\n&gt; A person can=\r\n own many web sites with the same Domain name.\n&gt; A collection of distribute=\r\nd documents on different sites can  \n&gt; consitute a Web site.\n&gt; etc.\n\nIndeed=\r\n. All of which is currently ignored by the current robots.txt\nstandard AFAI=\r\nK.\n\nA content-neg approach *could* solve that issue because it addresses\nth=\r\ne concept of &quot;site&quot; by saying:\n\n  a resource *could* be a &#39;site&#39; by simplyi=\r\nng accepting neg for &#39;site&#39;\n  representations\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
