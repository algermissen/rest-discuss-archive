They may although be\n&gt; &gt; referring to different scenarios?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dunno. I *think* that Mike&#39;s and my thinking is rather aligned and\n&gt; that Eric is a tiny bit more in favor of doing stuff with link rels\n&gt; than suitable for my personal taste. (Just my impression over the\n&gt; years)\n&gt; \n\nDon&#39;t know how you got that impression; every time a new link relation\nis minted to express semantics already standardized in generic media\ntypes, a cat gets its tail stepped on.  I&#39;ve pushed back against &quot;magic&quot;\nlink relations plenty.  Don&#39;t worry about my cat, he&#39;s 19 and quite used\nto all the abuse...\n\nA proper nutshell summary of me, is that Atom / HTML+RDFa provide\nsufficient semantics for most any generic object interface.  I have yet\nto create a media type, and object strongly to the notion that REST\ndevelopers should mint new media types for every project.\n\nWhen Roy says, &quot;A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive\neffort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources\nand driving application state&quot; I interpret that to mean something like,\n&quot;HTML &lt;object&gt; syntax is used to communicate URI templates&quot; suffices as\ndocumentation.  Not, &quot;a new media type has been created to drive\napplication state using URI templates.&quot;\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
