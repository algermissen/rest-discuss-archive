That is unRESTful coupling because the=\r\n client must not rely on such information but react to whatever it gets at =\r\nruntime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you mean the Service -&gt; Feed -&gt; Entry hierarchy?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s what it comes down to.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You said yourself in that=\r\n thread that &lt;collection&gt; and &lt;image&gt; played conceptually similar roles. Is=\r\nn&#39;t Page -&gt; Image a similar two-level hierarchy? What is wrong with that?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;collection href=3D&quot;&quot;&gt; points to &#39;a collection&#39;, that is ok. But predef=\r\nining the media type that comes back from the collection is not. Might well=\r\n be RSS or text/uri-list\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess what I&#39;m wondering is if At=\r\nomPub really defines an \n&gt; &gt; &quot;application flow&quot; or do client writers mistak=\r\ne the hierarchy for one?\n&gt; \n&gt; A truly RESTful client would do a GET on the =\r\ncollection and treat any response as &#39;correct&#39; from a server POV (except fo=\r\nr non-Collection representations, for\n&gt; example an audio file).\n&gt; \n&gt; Only i=\r\nf we do that the server&#39;s independent evolvability is preserved.\n&gt; \n\nOk... =\r\nagree on the above, but how do you define &#39;collection&#39;? To me it&#39;s somethin=\r\ng that has a set of &#39;entries&#39;. So you get the hierarchy don&#39;t you? A &#39;good&#39;=\r\n client can/should be flexible on the media types though (and the spec shou=\r\nldn&#39;t try to restrict them). Perhaps the variability in media type means th=\r\nat the entries may be exclusively inline for some representations which jus=\r\nt means that the hierarchy might not map to your addressable resources, but=\r\n it&#39;s still there.\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
