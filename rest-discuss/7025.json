Microsoft&#39;s excuse for going to personalised domain may be\n&gt; lame. But the end product, personalised domain, is far from being lame\n&gt; and has yet to be taken advantage of by public.\n&gt;\n\nYes, I do seem to have come across as advocating against personalized \ndomains in my anti-M$ rant... but I only meant to criticise their use of a \nmigration-to-temporary-URI strategy to accomplish a simple rebranding. Their \nend result wasn&#39;t personalized domains, it was personalized pathnames, just \nlike before.\n\nI can&#39;t see how following the tenets of the REST architectural style \nwould ever lead to such a ridiculous requirement regardless of the scale of \nthe service.  My point being that if you&#39;re backed into a corner where that \nprocedure really *is* a requirement and not just ignorance, it&#39;s a result of \npast screwups wherein deviations from best practices have obviously occurred, \nlikely out of ignorance.\n\nSorry to self-promote, but I have an upcoming service offering on my groo.vi \ndomain.  Personalized subdomains of {user}.is.groo.vi and {group}.are.groo.vi \nare under discussion, so yeah I&#39;m all in favor!\n\n-eric.is[at]groo.vi\n\n\n\n\n"}}
