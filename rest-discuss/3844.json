If someone POSTs/PUTs an &quot;text/xml&quot;\nrequest entity (that happens to not  be well-formed) and gets back a 415,\nhow likely are they to know that it&#39;s the entity itself that&#39;s not valid,\nnot necessarily the content-type they said it was?  I know you could convey\nthis information in the response entity, but let&#39;s face it, the only\nsuccessful use of this is with HTML, which isn&#39;t at all program-friendly.\nAs a result, you have one of the following choices:\n\n1) Use the code that&#39;s closest and hope the client understands it.\n2) Use 400 generally and come up with an xml-based (since the request was\nsupposedly xml) response entity that conveys all possible information.  Then\nmake sure all clients know how to use this xml-based specification.\n3) Create a new 4xx response code that means *exactly* what you want it to\nmean.  Then make sure all clients now how to handle that response code (or\nfall back to 400 equivalence and rely on option #1).\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Alex Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;; &quot;rest-discuss&quot;\n&lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, August 04, 2003 12:52 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] 403 vs. 409\n\n\n&gt; Why isn&#39;t the correct response 415 (Unsupported Media Type)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Your application requires that the POST conform to a particular schema and\n&gt; that schema has been violated.  2616 does not say that the value of the\n&gt; content-type header is bad, but that the actual media-type is bad.

Currently, I am using 403, saying\n&gt; &gt; that an invalid request entity (say, a non-well-formded XML document)\n&gt; &gt; would be &quot;forbidden&quot;. But the problem here is that the resource is what\n&gt; &gt; defines whether the request entity is valid or not (even the\n&gt; &gt; well-formedness of an XML document), so in *some* sense, a bad request\n&gt; &gt; entity &quot;conflicts&quot; with the resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is 403\n&gt; &gt; for?  About the only example I could come up with was one mirroring a\n&gt; &gt; filesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is marked\n&gt; &gt; &quot;read-only&quot;.  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid if it were\n&gt; &gt; not read-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is not a\nconflict,\n&gt; &gt; necessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore\nnot\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for a 409 response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 31, 2003 at 09:11:23AM -0400, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.\n&gt; &gt; Should a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d use 400.
