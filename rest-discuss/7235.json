OTOH, the spec does say that for OPTIONS: &quot;A 200\nresponse SHOULD include any header fields that indicate optional features\nimplemented by the server and applicable to that resource (e.g., Allow)&quot;.\n \n&gt; &gt; I was also thinking of URIs with dynamics segments, URIs \n&gt; with query strings\n&gt; &gt; not encoded like HTML Forms \n&gt; (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), URIs using\n&gt; &gt; matrix-style encoding for parameters, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can expose those through links. But URIs should be opaque yada\n&gt; yada.\n\nI&#39;m not buying this opaque URI argument in the context of introspecting an\napplication. It&#39;s like saying that you can&#39;t describe how an URI is\ngenerated by an HTML Form (GET) by encoding the parameters. What about\nlisting of the potential queries of an HTML Form as links? ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I prefer to rely on WADL rather than HTML Forms \n&gt; to provide such\n&gt; &gt; metadata. It&#39;s easier to process, allows any HTTP method \n&gt; (HTML Form are\n&gt; &gt; currently limited) and supports more URI formatting styles.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTML FORM as a microformat is not limited in what it can describe.\n\nSure, that&#39;s a good approach, maybe WADL could also be embedded as a\nmicroformat as well?\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
