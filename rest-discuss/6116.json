We only have\n&gt; resources pointed to by URIs.\n\nI&#39;ve just spent the last few days telling you why I don&#39;t think REST is \ngood enough for this reason.\n\nHTTP can certainly have separate subject and object by way of HTTP \nheaders for indicating &#39;subject&#39; (e.g. cookie, auth) and leaving the URI \nfree to model the &#39;object&#39;. A great number of successful web \napplications (I&#39;d speculate a strong majority) take advantage of this fact.\n\nREST specifically denies the possibility of features such as &quot;Hello \n%Username%&quot;, &quot;Welcome back&quot;, etc., because it defines a resource as \n&quot;temporally varying membership function MR(t), which for time t maps to \na set of entities, or values, which are equivalent&quot;. This means it is \nimpossible, per REST, to vary representations over anything but time. I \nbelieve it is better to allow representations to vary by subject too. \nThis allows you to model your domain resources (&#39;objects&#39;) independent \nof the context which accesses them (&#39;subjects&#39;). According to REST I \nshould conflate &#39;subject&#39; and &#39;object&#39; and squeeze them into its \ndefinition of &#39;resource&#39;.\n\nAt any rate you&#39;ve shot yourself in the foot, because you said earlier \nthat cookies aren&#39;t considered non-RESTful. Cookies delineate a \ncomponent of a request&#39;s context which is not expressed in the URI. If \nyou&#39;re going to be contrarian, I&#39;d at least appreciate some consistency.\n\nSaying &quot;That&#39;s not REST&quot;, is not a defence of REST.\n\n&gt;&gt;I draw a firm distinction between these. Because I draw a firm \n&gt;&gt;distinction I can say that the &#39;subject&#39; can be transferred &#39;out of \n&gt;&gt;band&#39;, \n&gt; \n&gt; What does that mean? I&#39;m not sure what you mean by out of band.\n\nBy &#39;out of band&#39; I mean &#39;not in the URI&#39;. I.e. in a HTTP header.\n\n&gt; What are the advantages of sessions?\n\nI&#39;ve already answered this question.\n\nIn short leaving the &#39;subject&#39; out of the URI addresses security and \nprivacy considerations and makes for more enduring and transferable URIs \nwhich solely represent the &#39;object&#39; of the request.\n\nI.e. the model is Who GETs What, which I believe is superior to GET \n/Who/What.\n\nI think I&#39;ll crawl back into my blissfully non-RESTful hole now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
