And I think it is /required/ to get\napplications built to the REST approach.\nI&#39;d like to use existing HTTP software - clients and servers - as a base,\nbut there are a lot of landmines left from the Browser Wars.\nEven so, many existing software tools can be used as is and the ones that\nhave &#39;issues&#39; usually can be adjusted.\n\nThe push I&#39;d like to make is for an &#39;Automatable Web&#39;. I&#39;m not into the\nSemantic Web, and the existing &#39;Visual Web&#39; just doesn&#39;t cut it - the tools\nhave led people down the path exposing user interface via resources (rather\nthan exposing the information) and handling messages in a &quot;one resource, one\nmethod&quot; approach (rather than full function get/put/post/delete). Simple RPC\ntools help scripters achieve some amount of networked automation, but to go\nto the next level you need to build on a strong foundation - the Web - and\nthe features that give it strength.\n\n\n\nThere has been talk in the past about APIs that are REST friendly - we\nshould start a page on the Wiki.\n\nHere is one page that has psedo-code to describe REST ideas - but a new page\nis needed for full API discussions.\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/PseudoCodeForRest?action=high\nlight&value=api\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
