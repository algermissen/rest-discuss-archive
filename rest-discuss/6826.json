How should I move an existing person to an existing location?\n&gt; Originally I did a POST on location like so:\n&gt; curl -d &quot;bob&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: text/plain&quot; -X POST\n&gt; http://localhost:8182/location/virginia\n&gt; \n&gt; This says move person &quot;bob&quot; to location virginia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I&#39;m thinking it would be more &quot;resource-ful&quot; to PUT the person\n&gt; with the updated location?\n\nI think you&#39;re getting confused. First you say you have a person\nresource, then you&#39;re POSTing to a location resource with a data\npayload, &quot;bob&quot;. The text &quot;bob&quot; is not a resource.\n\nIf you want to model relationships between resources then you need to\nuse an appropriate modelling metaphor such as RDF (perhaps in this\nsimple case you could use WebDAV bindings instead). Thus, you would have\nresources:\n\n  http://foo/person/bob\n  http://foo/location/catalonia\n  http://foo/location/virginia\n\nYou would have an initial state of affairs at t1:\n\n  @prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n  @prefix world: &lt;http://foo/&gt; .\n\n  world:person/bob world:has_location world:location/catalonia .\n\nYou would then PUT the new representation of the world at t2 (to\nwhatever resource handles the ontology of your world:\n\n  @prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n  @prefix world: &lt;http://foo/&gt; .\n\n  world:person/bob world:has_location world:location/virginia .\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
