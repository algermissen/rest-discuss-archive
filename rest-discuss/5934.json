And I think creating  \n&gt; a new\n&gt; resource to r=\r\nepresent state this way is much cleaner that redirect  \n&gt; after\n&gt; POST hack=\r\ns via controllers (an idiom that seems to be common in the  \n&gt; Java\n&gt; world=\r\n).\n&gt;\nI have never thought of redirect after post to be a strategy to  \nprev=\r\nent duplicate posts, although that is the context in which Lyle  \nKopnicky =\r\nbrought it up in this thread. I have considered redirect  \nafter post only =\r\nas a way to prevent the user-unfriendly pop up dialog  \nthat asks whether o=\r\nr not the user wants to repost old data. That  \ndialog is confusing to most=\r\n users, and makes the site feel  \nunprofessional in my opinion. Redirecting=\r\n to a get after a post  \nprevents that dialog box. I consider duplicate pos=\r\nts a separate  \nissue. Even if you do redirect after get, the user could st=\r\nill back  \nup and press submit again.\n\nTo me the /12345 approach contrasts =\r\nwith the deja vu token, which is  \nmentioned as a J2EE pattern. As far as I=\r\n know, the deja vu token has  \ntraditionally been submitted to the server a=\r\ns part of the post data,  \nrather than being embedded in the URI. So instea=\r\nd of posting to:\n\n/accounts/bob/orders/12345\n\nYou would post to:\n\n/accounts=\r\n/bob/orders\n\n...but include in the post data (likely from a HTML hidden for=\r\nm  \nfield) a parameter named dejavu with the value 12345.\n\nIn either approa=\r\nch, the deja vu token is private to the server,  \nopaque to the client. In =\r\neither approach, the server must keep track  \nof the deja vu tokens they&#39;ve=\r\n already seen. What I think placing it  \nin the URI does is enable the POE =\r\nstuff. But so long as POE isn&#39;t  \nwidely supported, however, I don&#39;t see mu=\r\nch difference between the  \ntwo, though the J2EE way has slightly cleaner U=\r\nRIs.\n\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean by &quot;incorporate 410 to emulate ttl?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean t=\r\nhat for this to work you need to keep a record of URLs that\n&gt; could be POST=\r\ned to and might be rePOSTed to. Servers need to be  \n&gt; able to\n&gt; release th=\r\nose resources heuristically as there&#39;s no guarantee the  \n&gt; client\n&gt; will c=\r\nome back. It&#39;s nicer if they have a means of letting the client\n&gt; know what=\r\n&#39;s happened.\n&gt;\nDisks are pretty cheap these days. To me if keeping track of=\r\n the  \ntokens is required for the correct functioning of the application,  =\r\n\nI&#39;d put them in the database and keep them forever. You could  \nassociate =\r\nthem with the data being saved or updated as a result of  \nthe post, and ju=\r\nst check each time.\n\nBut even if you were to store the tokens in memory, an=\r\nd release them  \nafter a while, I don&#39;t understand what you would accomplis=\r\nh by  \ntelling the client the timeout. What would the client do with that  =\r\n\ninformation? Oh, do you mean that after the resource is released,  \nand /1=\r\n2345 doesn&#39;t exist anymore, that&#39;s when you send the 410?\n\nBill\n----\nBill V=\r\nenners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
