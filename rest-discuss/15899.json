Instead, think about this=\r\n from the perspective of a) building a new kind of browser and associated m=\r\nedia type(s); and b) designing &quot;sites&quot; for that new kind of browser.\n\nSome =\r\nother quick points: \n\n1) &quot;Standard&quot; doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means in=\r\n the context of REST. New standards come from somewhere, often grass roots =\r\nefforts. What is important is that in whatever domain the client and server=\r\n are working, there is a well-understood way to get to map a media type ide=\r\nntifier to a specification. That&#39;s the IANA registry on the open Internet. =\r\nIf you are doing something within the enterprise it could be something as s=\r\nimple as &quot;All our internal media types are described on Bob&#39;s wiki page&quot;. I=\r\nn that &quot;in between&quot; stage, a community could adopt a &quot;standard&quot; pre-registr=\r\nation but as the format grows it needs to get registered so folks not part =\r\nof the original community become part of the eco-system.\n\nThe main problem =\r\nwith &quot;application/xml&quot; is that it maps to the XML specification which is li=\r\nkely not the right thing required to process the format properly.\n\n2) You d=\r\non&#39;t want a media type for each kind of resource -- that makes evolution ha=\r\nrd. It&#39;s better to design media types around client domains than service do=\r\nmains. For example, a web browser is happy to see every resource in the Web=\r\n as marked-up text + forms + graphics (etc) because that is sufficient to l=\r\net it do what it needs to do with the information and navigate the app. Oth=\r\ner types of clients will likely have their own ways of looking at the data =\r\n-- design your media types around those views and you will give the service=\r\ns & resources a lot more room to change and evolve -- just as they can on t=\r\nhe Web. Also, this mapping from raw resource data to the &quot;client&#39;s view&quot; of=\r\n data gives you data encapsulation.\n\n3) WADL is the opposite of what I desc=\r\nribed in (2) -- it specifies precisely what the service does. If this is th=\r\ne agreement between the client and server, then every change of the service=\r\n changes the agreement. It just makes the cost of change high. You don&#39;t ha=\r\nve that on the web. The HTML spec doesn&#39;t change because Facebook added a f=\r\neature. If the browsers start adding features then the HTML spec changes as=\r\n we are now seeing with HTML5.\n\nMy recent blog entries might help you here:=\r\n \nhttp://linkednotbound.net/2010/06/09/hypermedia-is-the-clients-lens/\nhttp=\r\n://linkednotbound.net/2010/07/19/self-descriptive-hypermedia/\n\n(Hmm that wa=\r\nsn&#39;t so short after all!)\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n"}}
