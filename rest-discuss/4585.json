Thanks, Hugh.\n\n&gt; Mark suggests a new interface, adding the QUERY-WITH-POST method to the\n&gt; usual HTTP methods. If you want to write a client that can operate\n&gt; against arbitrary resources, and presume the response will be a query\n&gt; result it can process, you would have to use that new method. If the\n&gt; server responds 200 or 201 in that case, you can process the response as\n&gt; a query. This interface exposes uniform semantics to all such clients.\n&gt; This approach seems the most robust way for Bud (the original poster on\n&gt; the thread) to implement his query.\n\nWell, I&#39;m not sure about that.  In a greenfield situation, certainly,\nbut I expect he&#39;s got to deal with established browsers, clients,\nservers, toolkits etc.. which might make using a new HTTP method\nawkward, difficult, or impossible.  But at least the architectural\nideal has been identified, which permits one to more easily see the\ntradeoffs being made with alternate solutions.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
