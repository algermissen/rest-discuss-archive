Or if the\n&gt;&gt; XmlHttpRequest object follows the spec and assumes that if a GET/HEAD on\n&gt;&gt; a resource once returned a 410, it doesn&#39;t make sense to access that URI\n&gt;&gt; again?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe every HTTP client in existence is broken.  Point any web \n&gt; browser, on any platform, at a 410 response.  Now, hit &quot;reload&quot;.
