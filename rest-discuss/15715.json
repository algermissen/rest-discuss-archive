The product page should be the=\r\n same for all users, but the shopping cart should be individual for each us=\r\ner. But if the page is the same for all users, it cannot contain an individ=\r\nual URI for the user&#39;s shopping cart!\n&gt;\n&gt; My idea is to store the cart URI =\r\nin a cookie and request the cart form the server with content of that cooki=\r\ne. The process looks like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Client: GET /product\n&gt; 2. Server: Ok=\r\n, product page\n&gt; 3. Client: POST /cart (requested with JavaScript)\n&gt; 4. Ser=\r\nver: Created, Location: /cart/93a41fe545b, set_cookie: /cart/93a41fe545b\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; ... on the next page:\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. Client: GET /another_product\n&gt; 6. Server: Ok=\r\n, another product page\n&gt; 7. Client: GET /cart/93a41fe545b (requested with J=\r\navaScript after reading the cookie)\n&gt; 8. Server: Ok, user&#39;s shopping cart\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Maybe the actual creation of the shopping cart can be deferred until the=\r\n first item is placed into the cart, but that is not important for my examp=\r\nle. Important is the mechanism to store the cart URI in a cookie and reques=\r\nt and display the cart with JavaScript.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to do something =\r\nsimilar without JavaScript?\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think of this approach?\n\nThat a=\r\npproach is pretty clean - clients are allowed to maintain their\nown state, =\r\nit&#39;s driven by hypertext, and you&#39;re using code on demand\n(because you have=\r\n to).\n\nI prefer an approach with a 3xx redirect as Jan described, you could=\r\n\nprivate cache the 3xx response and you end up with the same effect as\nthe =\r\ncookie approach.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t bother trying to &#39;store the cart on the client=\r\n side&#39; though\n- you&#39;ll gain virtually nothing from it (apart from a headach=\r\ne and a\ndeep hatred for the browser &#39;platform&#39;) and more than likely still =\r\nend\nup storing the cart state to the server anyway.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
