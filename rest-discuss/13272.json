Cannot a transaction manager itself\n&gt;  &gt; have a RESTful interface? The application that is using the\n&gt;  &gt; transaction\n&gt;  &gt; manager will not be RESTful, but the interaction with the service\n&gt;  &gt; will be.\n&gt; \n&gt; The transaction manager can have its own interface. \n\nThank you.  And thats all I really wanted to hear.\n\n&gt; But it still does\n&gt; not make sense to expose raw transaction managers to clients when you\n&gt; are building loosely coupled distributed systems (whether RESTful or\n&gt; not). WS-Tx specs have done this mistake, and we know how well they\n&gt; are adopted. When a server has broken down its use cases to low-level\n&gt; operations like transactions and compensations, the server designer\n&gt; may have over-abstracted the interface for clients. In such cases, it\n&gt; is better to take a step back, and see why you had to think of\n&gt; transactions in the place. The same is true for a number of so-called\n&gt; hard problems in REST such as partial updates, batches, copying,\n&gt; merging etc. Most of these problems go away or become simplified when\n&gt; you think in terms of application-level use cases and not low-level\n&gt; operations.\n&gt; \n\nYou are preaching to the choir.  I wrote this back in 2007:\n\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com/2007/09/18/distributed-compensation-with-rest-and-jbpm/\n\n\nSpecifically:\n\n&quot;Reading this fed more fuel to my idea that compensations really \nbelonged as part of a process model.&quot;\n\nThe &quot;Transaction&quot; section probably need to change to position 2pc \ntransactions as an anti-pattern.\n\nBut, this idea that everything has to be handcrafted isn&#39;t right either. \n  The right solution is somewhere in the middle (hence middleware). \nThis is why I like REST better than the way CORBA and WS-* has gone \nabout describing things.  Concepts like HATEOAS change the game a bit \nand makes things more flexible.\n\nThis is why REST-* is so important to me.  How do these traditional \nmiddleware services change with the introduction of RESTful Web Services?\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
