Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OK, Bob, OK, Mike. My frustration is that nobody can even succinctly\n&gt; explain to me what the argument against my position even *is* anymore.\n&gt; Or rather, what is the rationale behind ignoring self-descriptive\n&gt; messaging, defined as standardized types with registered identifiers?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve given an example of my own use of application/xbel+xml on the Web\n&gt; for the intended purpose (the exchange of hierarchical collections of\n&gt; annotated links) of the standardized type it *allegedly* points to.\n&gt;\n&gt; My contention is that this is not self-descriptive messaging, because\n&gt; Roy states that the constraint requires the identifier to be registered.\n&gt; It may become self-descriptive, if it&#39;s registered. But currently, it\n&gt; is a REST mismatch, because it is not registered and does not point to\n&gt; anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other side of this debate, then, would be that it *is* self-\n&gt; descriptive despite not being registered, because? Seriously. I&#39;d\n&gt; like to know the rationale behind *not* calling this a REST mismatch.\n\nThe problem becomes that basically if you have a system that walks,\nquacks, swims, flies and looks like a duck, the fact that it doesn&#39;t\nuse a data type registered with a specific entity (rather than simply\nbeing available and documented equally well some place else), is not a\nduck. It&#39;s a non-duck, an un-duck, the Anti-duck.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that if I write a client or server that\ntalks over, say, port 80, and sends all these headers and follows the\nother details of the HTTP spec, but I happen to use data/mystuff as a\ndata type, a data type not registered with IANA, then I&#39;m not using\nHTTP. I can&#39;t say &quot;yea, you can talk to my service via HTTP&quot;.\n\nBecause of this clause in the HTTP spec:\n\n&quot; Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number\n   Authority (IANA [19]). The media type registration process is\n   outlined in RFC 1590 [17]. Use of non-registered media types is\n   discouraged.&quot;\n\nTherefor I&#39;m using...I dunno, the NHTTP, &quot;Not HTTP&quot;, protocol. The\nHTTP police will darken the skies around my office were I to dare\nsuggest that I was using HTTP(r)(c)(tm)(reg.us.pat.off.) protocol for\nthis process. Or maybe they&#39;ll simply come over with big sticks to\n&quot;discourage&quot; me.\n\nOr, I guess, if I&#39;m doing all of this sacrilege behind a firewall\n&quot;well you can call it whatever you want&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s what this seems to be all boiling down to.\n\nIf you use a data type that&#39;s not IANA registered then, well, that&#39;s\nthe ball game. It&#39;s over. You can&#39;t call it REST. It&#39;s not 1% or 99%\nREST. It&#39;s unREST. May as well file it under POX RPC over HTTP (oh\nwait, it&#39;s not HTTP either...). Same thing. All that other stuff\nregarding the architecture and the style is nothing compared to using\na registered data type.\n\n2 O&#39;Reilly books on REST, almost 800 pages. And all they talked about\nwas how to use registered data types from IANA. Wait, that&#39;s not right\neither.\n\nHow can that be? How can they write all that text when they&#39;re clearly\nmissing most important aspect of REST? Sure, they mention using\nstandard payloads, but it&#39;s not like the cornerstone of their work.\nThey talk about all sorts of other things. Stuff folks seem to have\nreal issues grasping and have lots of questions on. Obviously, that&#39;s\nall just padding and filler for the book.\n\nSeems to me that if you&#39;re using a data type, and that it&#39;s well and\npublicly documented, that&#39;s likely more than acceptable to anyone\nwishing to leverage and access the service. Seems odd that you can\nhave an entire system designed, coded, and in operation, and the only\nthing keeping it from being &quot;REST&quot; is a, perhaps pending, registration\nat IANA. And if and when the data type IS registered, shazam, from\nzero to hero, from &quot;POX RPC over (not)HTTP&quot; to &quot;REST&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s where the &quot;shades of gray&quot; come in to play. Why many do not\nfeel REST is a black and white tag. Why it&#39;s not all or nothing.\nEspecially over something as minor as where the documentation is\npublished. In contrast to everything else that goes in to designing\nand structuring a capable REST system.\n\nMake no mistake, Eric, I enjoy your posts and your insight, and point\nof view. Your posts have given me a new look at how things can be\ndone.\n\nBut when I saw this thread take off, I knew to stay away, because I\nknew what it was all about without looking at it.\n\nSo, my argument is that, despite whatever it may say, whatever the\n&quot;letter of the law&quot; may be regarding where a data type is published\nand its &quot;RESTiness&quot;, the SPIRIT of having it publicly available and\naccessible trumps something as pedantic as the specific site where\nthis information is available.\n\nI argue that a data type can be &quot;self descriptive&quot; as long as its\nregistered SOMEWHERE, and not NECESSARILY IANA.\n\nFor example, I do not see someone from the Healthcare IT industry\ndropping the megabytes of data specifications on to the IANA some day,\nand I don&#39;t see a system trafficing in those payloads any less &quot;REST&quot;\nthan an identical system that happens to use an IANA registered data\ntype. In the Healthcare domain, those data types are routine, and\nubiquitous. If you&#39;re in HIT, you know how to work with them (as well\nas anybody anyway -- they are non-trivial documents).\n\nBest Regards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
