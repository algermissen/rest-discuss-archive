Dream is dream.. )\n\nAnother night, I dre=\r\named again, about the early stage of *utopia*. I\nsaw developers are using a=\r\n kind of method to model and identify\nresources for each web apps.\n\nNext, t=\r\nhey use a kind of _common_description_language_ to describe\neach resource, =\r\nto record their characteristics (i.e. which request\nthey process, what repr=\r\nesentation they accept & return).\n\nThey even record relationships between r=\r\nesources (i.e. resource A\ncreates resource B), allow new resources derived =\r\nfrom current\nresources, and even support versioning in resource description=\r\n.\n\nThe same time, I saw developers have already identified a list of\n_essen=\r\ntial_needs_ in order to adopt ReST style in apps. Based on the\nlist, they s=\r\ntart to build _application_ frameworks_ in different\nlanguages, creating _s=\r\ntardard_libraries_ and porting to each\nlanguages.\n\nUsing the frameworks & l=\r\nibraries, they start to select resources\nneeded for their application from =\r\na resource description list and turn\neach resource into binaries. Rather th=\r\nan re-write the codes, they also\nreuse the available resource binaries.\n\nAn=\r\nd i saw, more and more open communities are rapidly publishing\nresource pac=\r\nkages for particular web apps. Developers will choose\nresources they need a=\r\nnd assemble them into their apps. Rather than\nmaintain their own resources,=\r\n some apps decide to simply subscribe\nother apps&#39; resources via web...guess=\r\n what, i even saw IDE toolkits\navailable!\n\n(am i too naive to believe this =\r\nday will come?)\n\nIn a sudden, I woke up and immediately, I ask myself, was =\r\nthat a dream?\nI crawled back to my desk, booted up my old p3 box, googled a=\r\n quoted\nstring &quot;restful web utopia&quot;.\n\nGoogle replied:\nYour search - &quot;restfu=\r\nl web utopia&quot; - did not match any documents.\n\n\n--\n-toydi-\n\n"}}
