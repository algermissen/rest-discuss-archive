I don&#39;t think it is that complex compared to other APIs I&#39;ve\n=\r\nseen: \n\n   Client client =3D new Client(Protocol.HTTP);\n   client.get(&quot;http=\r\n://www.restlet.org&quot;).getEntity().write(System.out);\n\nHere is the simplest R=\r\nestlet server you can build, no XML config\nneeded, no annotation, no contai=\r\nner required, just a couple of JARs in\nyour classpath:\n\n        Restlet res=\r\ntlet =3D new Restlet() {\n            public void handle(Request request, Re=\r\nsponse response) {\n                response.setEntity(&quot;Hello World!&quot;, Media=\r\nType.TEXT_PLAIN);\n            }\n        };\n\n        // Create the HTTP serv=\r\ner and listen on port 8182\n        new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8182, restlet)=\r\n.start();\n\nOf course, we support more complex cases like routing based on U=\r\nRI\ntemplates, virtual hosting, transparent content negotiation.\n\n&gt; Programs=\r\n that act as both HTTP clients and servers are rare. \n&gt; Usually I&#39;m either =\r\nwriting a client or a server, not both.\n\nI have seen other usages but that =\r\nis not the most important point.\nJust the fact that you can reuse your know=\r\nledge of the API when\nwriting a pure client then later a pure server seems =\r\nuseful no?\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; Now are there times when I want both? Yes, as you poin=\r\nt out; but it \n&gt; would be easier if I could learn them separately and treat=\r\n them as \n&gt; separate pieces. Or if I could easily use one but not the other=\r\n. For \n&gt; instance, I might want to use RESTlet for the server side but Apac=\r\nhe \n&gt; HTTPClient for the client.\n\nNothing prevents you from doing that if y=\r\nou feel like it. The Restlet\nframework never forces you to use the more com=\r\nplex artifacts if you\ndon&#39;t need them. But it seems nice to know they are h=\r\nere when needed.\n\nBest regards,\nJerome\n\nPS: The exact spelling is &quot;Restlet&quot;=\r\n instead of &quot;RESTlet&quot; :-)\n\n\n"}}
