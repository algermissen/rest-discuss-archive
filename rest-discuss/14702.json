The client need to retrieve the command \nfrom the server and then send the response of the device to the server \nto check its validity. Then the server says if it is ok or not.\n\n  Device      client     Server\n                    ----&gt;      Get command\n        &lt;-----      &lt;-----\n\n        ----&gt;       ----&gt;      Response from device\n   \t\t   &lt;-----     Response from server indicating\n                               if it is ok or not the execution\n\nIt would be like: client calls authenticate of device. then the server \nsends the command to be sent to the device for authentication. The \nclient send this command to the device and the response is sent back to \nthe server. The server then replies.\n\nI have thought on:\n     /device/{id}   as resource\n     /device/{id}/authenticate\n          GET will retrieve the command and blank state\n              &lt;command&gt; value &lt;/command&gt;\n              &lt;state&gt; not defined &lt;/command&gt;\n          PUT will send the response and get the real state\n              ---&gt; &lt;response&gt; value &lt;/response&gt;\n              &lt;--- &lt;state&gt; not defined &lt;/command&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t know if this is REST. Is it better to create another resource as:\n     /device/{id}/authenticate/command  (only GET available)\n     /device/{id}/authenticate/response (only PUT available)\n     /device/{id}/authenticate          (only GET avaliable for status)\n\nAny help is welcome.\nTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
