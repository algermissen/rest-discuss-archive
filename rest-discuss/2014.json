For those\nwho couldn&#39;t be there, I had a couple of fairly well attended talks on\nREST topics, Matt Seargent did a talk which concluded that REST is a\nbetter model than SOAP RPC if you can get your boss to agree to let you\nuse it and generally it seems like the REST meme is spreading well. A\nyear ago REST was a FORK phenomenon. Six months ago it was an FORK,\nrest-discuss and xml.com phenomenon. Now it&#39;s worldwide baby!\n\nFurthermore, the addition of WebMethods to SOAP allows a change in\ntactics. Rather than attacking SOAP we can offer REST as an\narchitectural style to make your SOAP services scalable, interoperable,\ndiscoverable and all that other good stuff.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
