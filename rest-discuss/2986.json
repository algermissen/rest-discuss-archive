I hope it&#39;s clear that I am relating defenses I hear, from \nan evolutionary-next-step viewpoint. I am not arguing for their \nengineering validity.\n\nBut I think those are two reasons why people who now do EDI (or think \nin terms of EDI) find EDI-mailbox-style Soap a more-convenient \nevolutionary next step than REST.  REST may seem like a scarey leap \ninto the unknown.\n\n&gt; Data is either on the Internet or it isn&#39;t. If there \n&gt; is some configuration of message bits that will get the data, then \nyou \n&gt; need to make sure your cracker can&#39;t send you those bits (i.e. use \n&gt; passwords). What does it matter whether you use a standardized \n&gt; addressing mechanism (URIs) versus a non-standard one? I&#39;ve argued \nin \n&gt; the past (and would rather not do it again) that using a \nstandarized \n&gt; mechanism is actually better because your infrastructure \nunderstands \n&gt; what is going on better and can provide more support (e.g. ACLs on \n&gt; resource types).\n\nI agree.  But again, somebody who is now doing EDI will already have \ncontrol mechanisms in place for EDI-style interaction, and so will \nfeel like they are covered.  (Regardless of the actual strength of \ntheir coverage.)  And the standardized mechanisms for protecting Web \nresources may be new to them.\n\nIt&#39;s the best I could do to respond to your challenge.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
