Part of it for a lot\n&gt; of people is certainly &quot;mob mentality&quot;; that there&#39;s comfort in knowing\n&gt; that the person beside you believes the same thing.  There&#39;s also the\n&gt; issue that mental models are hard to change, and getting this point for\n&gt; many people requires a new one.  Combined, they&#39;re nasty.\n\nI look at the list above and it occurs to me that an &quot;aha&quot; moment may not be\nneeded in the end.  As RPC-style infrastructures proliferate, the features\nyou mention (caching, firewalls, simple interface, etc) will begin to\ncrumble (e.g. ineffective caching, overloaded firewalls, administrating a\nnever-ending list of interfaces/methods, etc.) around them.  They will throw\nmore hardware and more complex software at the problem.  And when they\ndiscover that this isn&#39;t solving the problem (and they *will* discover\nthat), they will start to look around for alternatives.  And they will see\nREST.  They will see applications running in ways that their own can&#39;t.  And\nthey will finally begin to see the light...\n\nWhat better way of showing how REST is better than RPC than to let them see\nhow bad RPC can get?\n\nThen again, if people don&#39;t want to see, then they won&#39;t see.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
