Clients and intermediaries may\ncount on that. POST is not defined to be idempotent, so clients and\nintermediaries may not count on POST messages being idempotent. \n\nHere people start to differ.\n\nStefan Tilkov wrote:\n| PUT is nice because it&#39;s [supposed to be] idempotent. POST is not.  \n| This means that a client is allowed (within REST&#39;s constraints) to  \n| retry a PUT if it hasn&#39;t received a response.\n| If you have only POST - for whatever reason - you need to do  \n| something else. Examples include http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/ \n| draft-nottingham-http-poe/ and http://www.goland.org/draft-goland- \n| http-reliability-00.text\n\nI wrote:\n| ... POST isn&#39;t necessarily non-idempotent: it may be \n| idempotent or not. In fact, reliability approaches such as \n| the ones you refer to below are\n| ways of making POST idempotent. \n\nStefan, and later Alan Dean, agreed.\n\nJan Algermissen wrote:\n| Actually, I&#39;d say that every single invokation of POST is \n| significant from a client&#39;s POV and it explicitly expects \n| multiple POSTs to have distinct effects, or?\n| \n| IMO, POST *is* in fact non-idempotent...always. Per definition.\n\nand Mark Baker joined:\n| Not quite.  POST is defined to be non-idempotent, i.e. if you see an\n| HTTP message with a POST request method, then that message is a\n| non-idempotent message.  \n\nSo the question is: must every POSTed message be non-idempotent? Or: if I\nhave a idempotent message, may I use POST?\n\nThe importance is in the reliability aspect. If all POST messages are\nnon-idempotent by definition, reliability protocols such as POE [1], SOArity\n[2] and HTTPLR [3] (POST variant) are wrong: they make POST messages\nidempotent. If POST messages can be either idempotent or not, there is\nnothing wrong with them, nor with the idea of using a protocol on top of\nHTTP to make POST messages idempotent. I would like that.\n\nJoe Gregorio:\n\n| Agreed, POST is non-idempotent, and GET is idempotent, which is one\n| of the key aspects of self-descriptive messages, that when an \n| intermediary\n| sees a POST it &#39;knows&#39; that it isn&#39;t idempotent, while it \n| does &#39;know&#39; that\n| a GET is idempotent.\n\nI&#39;d say the intermediary knows it must treat the message as if it were\nnon-idempotent. You and Mark both agree the intermediary does not know\nanything about the actual message and what it does. I think RFC2616 defines\nthree knowledge levels about messages for clients and intermediaries:\n1) I know nothing (POST), and must take all possible precautions.\n2) I know it&#39;s idempotent (PUT, DELETE, GET etc.)\n3) I know it&#39;s safe (GET, etc.), implies 2.\n\nAnd I&#39;d still like to see a quote from RFC2616 where it says &quot;POST messages\nare (always) non-idempotent&quot; or a passage which implies this.\n\nMarc de Graauw\n\nwww.marcdegraauw.com\n \n[1] http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-nottingham-http-poe/\n[2] http://www.goland.org/draft-goland-http-reliability-00.text\n[3] http://www.dehora.net/doc/httplr/draft-httplr-01.html#rfc.section.8.2.1\n\n\n"}}
