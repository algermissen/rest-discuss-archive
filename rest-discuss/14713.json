Roy confirmed that (recent post on atom-protocol list)\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It is really as simple as this:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; o The client needs an understanding of the set of media types that the service uses, IOW, the set of types the client has to be able to deal with. (this is what I think makes up a service type for discovery and &#39;governance&#39; purposes)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would choose to say &#39;set of representations&#39; over &#39;set of media \n&gt; types&#39;.\n\nNot getting what you mean. You cannot specify the set of representations - they can cary at will.\n\n&gt; Those representations will define types of link relations, which \n&gt; in turn define the application flow(s). Over time - other links/flows \n&gt; can be added, resources moved, media-types added etc. This is what I \n&gt; have understood as evolveability aspect of REST wrt the hypertext \n&gt; constraint.\n\nDig into this later.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The funny thing for me was that, once actively accepting these consequences, it turns out there is really not so much that can change about a server given the above obligations. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok - are you saying this is a Good Thing?\n\nYES!! REST separates so nicely what can change from what can be kept stable in the face of evolving requirements. Its is magical - now that I see it :-)\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
