The format of that type has gone through a set of compati=\r\nble changes[1] and I can send the whole feature set. How do I decide what t=\r\no send? All of it? (I&#39;d go with that because I think it is the reasonable d=\r\nefault: should I put link X in there - yes I should because I can.)\n\n2) Wha=\r\nt if I have two different ways of putting in the same kind of hypermedia co=\r\nntrol? Wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to look whether the client is one of the =\r\nolder ones or a new one and decide based on that (hence UserAgent)?  (Yeah,=\r\n you could say that having multiple non-orthogonal choices is a failure in =\r\nmedia type evolution in the first place)\n\nOf course I see your point (and I=\r\n also know this is a slippery slope towards over specification) \n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n=\r\n[1] Incompatible changes would yield new types, e.g. application/procuremen=\r\nt-new\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, Julian\n\n\n"}}
