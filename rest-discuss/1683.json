But I\n&gt; do think that that calling expat+J2EE a REST toolkit is vaguely bogus.\n\nI don&#39;t see the problem. REST is the architecture of the Web and a REST\ntoolkit would be a piece of software that helps you build the mediating\nlayer between your application and the Web. AFAIK, that&#39;s what (e.g.)\nJ2EE and Zope are used for. Now that XML has come along it makes sense\nto want to extend these things. Just as they had native knowledge of\nHTML, you might want to give them native knowledge of XML and RDF. And\nmaybe newer toolkits could better enforce best practices. But overall, I\nsee no problem calling any web development platform a REST toolkit. REST\nis not something new.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
