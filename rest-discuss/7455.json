But in common usage,\n&gt; we talk about resources as if they were things.\n\nNot really, though I agree most people think that way.  Natural\nresources are an abstraction as well -- sure, they are &quot;trees&quot; or\n&quot;oil&quot; or &quot;gold&quot; or what-have-you at any given point in time,\nbut when we say &quot;that land is rich in resources&quot; we are talking\nabout the ongoing production source of &quot;stuff we want&quot;, not\nindividual trees, barrels, or nuggets.  Likewise, management\noften plays allocation games with resources in the abstract\nbefore actually mapping those &quot;resources&quot; to people.  YMMV.\n\nI agree about the confusion. It would have been easier for me to\nuse a different name, but then people would still think that URLs\nidentified files.  At least the acronym wouldn&#39;t have changed.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
