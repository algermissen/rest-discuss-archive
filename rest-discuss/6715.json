And I think \n&gt; that the answer is;  it doesn&#39;t.  \n\n- it&#39;s easier to test.\n\n- it&#39;s easier to deal with sessions/state (they&#39;ll be explicit).\n\n- it&#39;s easier to operate (you&#39;ll get less support calls)\n\n- it&#39;s easier/cheaper to make a site performant (you can choose caching \nover code optimisation)\n\n- it&#39;s much more like the OOAD/UML design stuff you use to design \neverything else.\n\n\nHere&#39;s what I find hard practically speaking, when it comes to doing the \nright thing:\n\na) working with cookies.\n\nb) i18n and translated content (links v conneg)\n\nc) providing alternative media/views  (links v conneg again)\n\nd) managing logged in/logged out page states for caches\n\ne) dealing with designers and devs who insist on side-effected GETs.\n\nf) not having PUT/DELETE in HTML.\n\ng) designing for collections.\n\nh) working around bogus design decisions in web frameworks.\n\ni) dealing with people who talk about static v dynamic sites.\n\na, d, e, f are due to spec, implementation and infrastructure cruft from \nthe 90s; h is simply that any framework will suck along some dimension \nor other, it can&#39;t be helped; i is down to a misconceived mental models \nthat affect how sites are to be classified architecturally (I seem to \nexpend a lot of time on this one for some reason, but it&#39;s intensely \nannoying);  b and c are more to do with the HTTP/MIME specs than REST \n(I&#39;m never really sure);\n\ng, collections, I suspect is the only only that points at a bona fide \narchitectural matter in REST.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
