Is there anything\nun-RESTful about constraining resources implicitly based on the\nuser&#39;s authenticated identity?  It makes me uneasy, but I&#39;m not sure\nwhy.\n\nLet&#39;s say we have a simple DBMS-based application that relates\nUsers to Products and allows, say, a subscription mechanism to build\nmore such bindings and a cancellation mechanism to break them\ndown.  Now we want the users to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves,\nand we want to expose this through a web interface.  A User ought\nto be able to manage his own space without constraint, but should\nnot be able to see or change other Users&#39; subscriptions.  Therefore,\nwe need to authenticate users and authorize their activities based\non their identity.\n\nWhat happens if there is a resource, say /Subscriptions, that spans\nmany users, and one particular user, with authentication, wants to\ndereference that?  One answer is that because part of /Subscriptions\nis out of bounds of that user, the entire resource is &quot;Unauthorized&quot;.\nAnother answer is that the representation given to a user is filtered, based\non his authenticated identity.  In that case, two different users\naccessing /Subscriptions via GET will see disjoint subsets of the\nresource.  By extension, an entire resource schema (application) may\nbe implicitly constrained by the security properties of the access.\n\nWhat does REST have to say about this, if anything?\n\nWalden Mathews\nMIS Special Projects\nSales, Trading and Wealth Management\nThomson Financial \nVoice (212) 510-3121\nFax (212) 732-7191\n\n"}}
