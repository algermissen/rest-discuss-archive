For example I can say that:\n&gt; \n&gt;     /authors\n&gt; \n&gt; returns a list of authors and\n&gt; \n&gt;     /authors/peter\n&gt; \n&gt; returns a single author.\n&gt; \n&gt; But with URL rewriting it&#39;s just as easy to say that\n&gt; \n&gt;   /authors/\n&gt; \n&gt; returns the list of authors.\n\nAnd you could say that\n\n   /authors\n\nreturns the list of authors as well.\n\n\n&gt; My point is that /authors cannot exist in a file system if it has a\n&gt; subdirectory. \n\nYes it can. It&#39;s the subdirectory itself. What that means is open to\ninterpretation. On un*x systems a directory is a special file\ncontaining a list of the files and directorys contained within the\ndirectory.\n\n\n&gt; (I think webservers send a moved/redirect if you ask for /authors or\n&gt; fetch the default page in that directory anyway??)\n\nA lot of webservers do behave like that. But that behaviour is not\nintrinsic to the way the web works. A webserver after all meerly maps\nan arbritary URI based namespace to some behaviour (in this case\nreturning an index.html page or some such).\n\nApache just returns an index in this situation, the index behaviour\nis often the commonly understood index.html trick. But it needn&#39;t be.\n \n\n&gt; But my question: for cases like this is it better to append a trailing\n&gt; slash if you want to get a list of things in a directory or does it\n&gt; not matter at all? So is:\n&gt; \n&gt;     /authors\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt;     /authors/\n&gt; \n&gt; preferred?\n\nThe trailing slash does have an effect on HTML form posts for browser\ncontexts. If you&#39;re resource is:\n\n   /authors/\n\nyou can have a form POST or GET to &quot;.&quot; and it will go to the current\npage. Having:\n\n  /authors\n\nas the resource and doing a POST or GET to &quot;.&quot; will send the request\nto:\n\n  /\n\n\nSo there is a difference as far as common browsers are concerned. I&#39;m\nnot sure it&#39;s spec compliant behaviour though. Just common.\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
