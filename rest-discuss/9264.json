But I have to disagree with the \nexample URL given in the article.\n\nhttp://humanresources.com/benefits?user=&lt;USER_SSID&gt;\n\nIf it had stopped there it would make sense.  But then &quot;type&quot; is added to \nthe end and REST goes out the window, because if user 123-45-6789 becomes \na part-time employee and later retires then his URL will change twice.  \nThe status of the employee is exactly the sort of thing which belongs in \nthe response body, not the URL.\n\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s a one-to-one mapping between SOAP calls and URLs as \nthe article suggests.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
