Fielding wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On Jul 11, 2008, at 6:40 AM, Sergio Andreozzi wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m dealing with the issue of defining a REST-oriented API. I need to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; define operations working on multiple resources at the same time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just define a resource that maps to all of the resources you intend\n&gt;&gt; to operate upon. Resources often overlap.\n&gt;\n&gt; the service for which we are trying to define a RESTful API should\n&gt; handle in the order of thousands of resources with the following\n&gt; characteristics:\n&gt;\n&gt; - lifecycle: resources can be dynamically created by clients and may\n&gt; last from minutes to hours\n&gt; - state: each resource has a state, which can be read and modified by\n&gt; clients\n&gt;\n&gt; the specific need for HTTP operation on multiple resources is about the\n&gt; ability for clients to query (or update) the state of a list of\n&gt; specified resources (via their ID/URI).\n&gt;\n&gt; current ideas:\n&gt; a. resource URI: http://.../resource/IDx\n&gt; b. resource state URI: http://.../resource/IDx/state\n&gt; c. resource state set URI:\n&gt; http://.../resource/ID1/state;ID2/state;...;IDn/state\n&gt;\n&gt; c. can be a possible URI structure for the resource set. We want to\n&gt; enable clients to ask for the status of a certain number of resources at\n&gt; once (this is a requirement).\n&gt; In that case, we need to handle the possibility of having many different\n&gt; HTTP response code (e.g., some resource may not exist, for others the\n&gt; client may not be authorized).\n&gt;\n&gt; Our open questions are:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. is it the proposed URI structure for the resource set a good choice?\n&gt; 2. for the multi-status code, should we consider what was done in WEBDAV\n&gt; with the 207 status code? Another possibility which is used by other\n&gt; REST interfaces is to have the service return a &quot;202 Accepted&quot; status\n&gt; code, and let the HTTP response body contain detailed status\n&gt; informations for each resource (e.g. using an appropriate XML document).\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks in advance, Sergio\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Sergio Andreozzi\n&gt; INFN-CNAF, Tel: +39 051 609 2860\n&gt; Viale Berti Pichat, 6/2 Fax: +39 051 609 2746\n&gt; 40126 Bologna (Italy) Web: http://www.cnaf.infn.it/~andreozzi\n&gt; \n\n"}}
