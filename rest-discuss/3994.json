IMHO,\n: &gt; : abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\n: &gt; : are\n: &gt; : subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\n: &gt; : words:\n: &gt; : subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\n: &gt; : part\n: &gt; : of the architecture itself).\n: &gt; :\n: &gt; : Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\n: &gt; : include\n: &gt; : c) ?\n: &gt; :\n: &gt; : The second question I have is related to the question what the\n: &gt; : semantics of a resource are.
