PUT to http://example.com/customer/FinishingFactory\n&gt; and get the actual resource name used returned in some fashion.\n&gt; Either as a redirect or response body like\n&gt; &lt;customer xlink:href=&quot;http://example.com/customer/2349&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Never use sequential resource names. Then each client that\n&gt; adds a new resource can use a scheme for coming up with a universal\n&gt; unique identifier, which would lead to resources named like:\n&gt;   http://example.com/customer/ajd82hdueofnsk34iuvnk2kai9fkfj1jfkmn\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually when I have REST questions I just look to the www to get the answer\n&gt; unfortunately PUT is not used nearly enough on the web to work out the\n&gt; answer.\n\nThis only indirectly answers your question, but\n\n - for messaging (HTTPLR) I came to the conclusion that URLs be issued\nby the server via a Location header. The client hasn&#39;t got a clue about\nstructure and therefor about what might or might be the next unused\nname; it&#39;s just a robot following a pre-determined set of HTTP calls.\n\n - for blogging, (Atom) POST the messages to a Collection resource\n(which might be http://example.com/customer/ in your case) that gives\nyou the URI for the created entry resource via a Location header.  The\nnext rev of the Atom protocol will be out soon, and there should be\nenough in there to get that idea across.\n\nBoth of these are similar at a high level. The guideline seems to be\nthis: HTTP clients never generate URLs for resource creation.\n\nThe other main reason I see sequential numbers being a bad idea on the\nweb is that they&#39;re often derived from a database&#39;s primary keys. A lot\nof blogging software works like this and it&#39;s problematic if you expect\n the URLs to have permanency.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
