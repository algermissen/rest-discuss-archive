What is the\nstatus?  I don&#39;t know...\n\nhttp://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/2937/requesting-mime-media-type-rss\n\n...but that pretty well sums up the arguments for registering a media\ntype identifier for RSS on the Web, including &quot;because Atom has one.&quot;\n\nCan anyone remember RSS being seriously discussed as an alternative to\nAtom on this list over the last five years, though?  I attribute the\ndisparity to Atom&#39;s ubiquitous *and* self-descriptive identifiers.\n\nIf and when application/rss+xml is accepted into IANA&#39;s standards tree\n(judging by the syntax, also a higher bar to clear), from that point\nforwards it&#39;s self-descriptive.  Again, when the context is HTTP over\nthe Internet, i.e. the Web.\n\nUntil then, what registry is it in?  Which only makes it unRESTful on\nthe Web.  On my LAN, I&#39;m the registration authority, not IANA, so I can\nmeet self-descriptiveness using any identifier I please, and a standard\nis whatever I say it is.  But, I&#39;m not at liberty to do this with a\npublic Web API... or an identifier with RFC-defined standards-tree\nsyntax.\n\nSo no, the ubiquity of RSS doesn&#39;t make it self-descriptive.  The\npresence of a registered identifier for RSS in *whatever* registry the\nparticipants in the communication agree with, makes it self-descriptive.\nOn the Web, the only registry is IANA, so until it actually is/was\napproved, application/rss+xml is/was an opaque identifier, because its\nsyntax leads me to assume it&#39;s an approved standard from an outfit\nrecognized by IANA (the RFC-mandated standards-tree requirements) -- if\nthat isn&#39;t the case, how is it self-descriptive?  Where do I look it up?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
