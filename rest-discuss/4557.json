And since that expectation\n&gt; isn&#39;t provided by other resources, then the connector semantics aren&#39;t\n&gt; uniform.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s an ok hack, sure, but better I think, would be indicating that\n&gt; expectation explicitly in the message (i.e. make it self-descriptive)\n&gt; via a new method.\n\nI&#39;m not quite sure I understand the problem, are you saying\nthat there is an implicit expectation of the client\nthat POSTing will always return the results of the\nquery instead of just a Location: header of where\nto get the results henceforth?\n\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n"}}
