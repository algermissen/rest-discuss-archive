I&#39;ve just discovered this group few days ago and  \n&gt; immediately found it interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to REStful architectural style approach of building loosely  \n&gt; coupled ROA services, but as I learn it, I find it very compelling...\n&gt;\n&gt; Enough prose... I face a real world design issue, and I&#39;d like to  \n&gt; seek an advise from a group of subject matter experts.\n&gt;\n&gt; At our organization (a state university) we have built a central  \n&gt; &quot;grading and class rosters&quot; web based system for exposing class  \n&gt; rosters to professors of different courses and allowing them to  \n&gt; &quot;grade&quot; their classes online during so called grading periods. The  \n&gt; data that is persisted into the relational DB, eventually gets into  \n&gt; the mainframe &quot;student record&quot; system using overnight batch  \n&gt; processes, etc. - pretty standard architecture. As part of this  \n&gt; online grading system, we have built a capability for professors to  \n&gt; download their respective class rosters (as excel spread sheets),  \n&gt; do their thing (grading) off line, and later on, &quot;upload&quot; their  \n&gt; final grades into the system (first saving the excel as CSV and  \n&gt; accepting it as a multi part file upload). The rules of such an  \n&gt; upload is that:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) It&#39;s supposed to be done during the open grading period\n&gt; 2) Any students who already have a grade will be ignored with any  \n&gt; new grade values\n&gt; 3) Any invalid grade values for any student (for the course) will  \n&gt; be ignored\n&gt; 4) Students with &quot;empty&quot; grades will be ignored and would be  \n&gt; &quot;eligible&quot; to receive a valid grade in a subsequent upload\n&gt; 5) A course upload contains multiple sections of a course (class  \n&gt; rosters) e.g. course 123 contains sections 12, 23, 44 (with  \n&gt; multiple students in each)\n&gt; 6) Each grading period is based on the &quot;semester&quot; (year and term  \n&gt; values e.g. 2007 01 - for Winter term of 2007, etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, there is a need to expose that kind of functionality to &quot;3rd  \n&gt; party&quot; course management systems which have their own grade book  \n&gt; type of applications, which would allow them programmatically post  \n&gt; final grades into our &quot;central&quot; grading system. Our immediate  \n&gt; thoughts were to expose a RESTful resource for submitting grades  \n&gt; using the same CVS representation that is currently being used on  \n&gt; the &quot;human web&quot; system. That would actually work pretty well, as we  \n&gt; will be able to reuse close to a 100% of our existing infrastructure.\n\nYes, I see no problem with that -- just use POST on the collection\nURI that represents the class for which grades are being posted.\nA CSV format is good enough to do the job.\n\n&gt; Now actually comes the design question in terms of RESTful design.  \n&gt; The current business rules for the &quot;human web&quot; grades upload allow  \n&gt; for &quot;partial submission of the course&#39;s grades (good ones will go  \n&gt; and bad ones (invalid, duplicates will be just skipped and reported  \n&gt; as such to the user). No atomic &quot;all or nothing&quot;. So we are facing  \n&gt; two design choices for RESTful resources:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Coarse-grained &quot;grade-upload&quot; resource which will take a  \n&gt; representation (CSV) of all the  sections (students) within a given  \n&gt; course for a  given semester:\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT /grade-upload/{year}/{term}/{course}\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;section&quot;,student-id&quot;,&quot;grade&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In this case how do we communicate  the  partial  submission  (in  \n&gt; terms of proper HTTP codes) and  also how  do we  convey  the  \n&gt; troubled records back to the client?\n\nUse POST instead of PUT.  The response format would depend on what the\nsender is able to accept (HTML for browsers, CSV for excel, etc.).\n\n&gt; 2) Fine-grained &quot;grade-posting&quot; resource for each student for any  \n&gt; given course, section and semester:\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT /grade-posting/{year}/{term}/{course}/{section}/{student-id}\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;grade&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the second case, we should be able to clearly communicate any  \n&gt; error conditions with standard HTTP codes and the client software  \n&gt; should be able to build any kind of &quot;mashups&quot; on top of it.\n\nI would make that an additional interface.\n\n&gt; One &quot;blank stare&quot; I get from my management when I actually proposed  \n&gt; the second solution was that the actual functionality requested  \n&gt; from the 3rd party course management systems was the &quot;batch grade  \n&gt; upload&quot; and the fine-grained resource for each student would be  \n&gt; &quot;wasteful&quot; in terms of multiple HTTP requests, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, what would be the optimal and &quot;true RESTful&quot; solution in this  \n&gt; situation?\n\nBoth.  Use POST for the batch grade upload and PUT to provide a\nmore fine-grained resource interface.  The POST interface can be\ndescribed by a form when the user browses to the course section\nusing the GET interface.\n\nYou could also use PATCH instead of POST, assuming you define a\nmedia type for overlapping CSV records, but that would only be\nadvantageous if the differencing mechanism (valid/invalid/skipped\ngrades) was somehow generic enough to apply to other resources.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
