I recommend the specification of a media type specific to your domain. That media type should provide the means for the necessary hypermedia controls (along the lines of application/atom+xml and application/atomsrv+xml).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s not clear to me...\n&gt; \n&gt; Should I write a specification for a &quot;cargo&quot; mime type to deliver an application that show such things?\n\nThink of the media type as domain specific. The application itself is formed when the components (user agent, servers, intermediaries) start working together. IOW, the media type is not for *this* application but for the domain (even if that is a rather loose term :-). Take AtomPub or HTML as examples: when these are specified the stuff that will later on be done with them (the applications) is not known. HTML can be used for displaying a Web page in a browser or for crawling and indexing a site. Both are applications and they *use* HTML is not made *for* them.\n\n&gt; Should such mime type become a standard?\n\nYes. It must be. However, &#39;standard&#39; in this sense means more &#39;application independent&#39; than &#39;IETF or W3C standard&#39;. It is ok if the media type is only standard in you organisation. Important is that it is not defined by the service under development.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It seem a little too complex...\n\nWhy does this seem complex?\n\n\n&gt; Is there some example of such a process worked?\n\nHTML\nAtomPub\nOpenSearch\nNewsML (to some extend)\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Giacomo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
