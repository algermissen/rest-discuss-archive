Many of that audience don&#39;t have the time or\n&gt; inclination to deep-dive on REST - they are looking for quick &#39;n&#39;\n&gt; dirty answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; What caused the failure of the [rest-advanced] / [rest-discuss]\n&gt; differentiation back then? Lack of interest? Lack of clear separation?\n&gt; Some other issue?\n\nThe &quot;newbies&quot; didn&#39;t mind listening in on the (very) occasional\nadvanced topic, and the gurus didn&#39;t mind answering newbie questions.\nI haven&#39;t seen any evidence that either group&#39;s attitude has changed.\n\nIf somebody wants to create the group though, feel free, I can&#39;t stop you.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
