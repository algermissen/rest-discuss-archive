What other\n&gt;&gt; solutions would there be otherwise?\n\nI think this does violate the principle.  But I am not sure\nabout solutions.\n\nPerhaps we actually need another verb.  But I find that in\ngeneral when I think I need another verb, I almost always\nend up being wrong.\n\nPUT suggests replacing the state completely, which is not the\nsame thing as a merge.\n\nPOST means &quot;take this entity and just process it&quot;.  This sounds\nlike a better fit to me.  The meaning of &#39;process&#39; in that sentence\nis part of the contract.  In fact, the more I think about it, the\nmore I think POST is *perfect* for a merge, as long as you can\nindicate to the server that a merge is what you want, and not\nanything else.  POST is very general.  But maybe I&#39;m getting ahead\nof myself and that is YAGNI.\n\nMaybe one could simply do:\n\nPOST /account/1\n&lt;account about=&quot;account/2&quot; /&gt;\n\nand the server would DWIM.  This includes merging the resources&#39;\nstate, coming up with a new state, and PUTing it.  This PUT could\nappear in the resource&#39;s revision history (at /account/1/revisions),\nand be annotated with information about the PUT being the result of\na merge with /account/2.\n\n200 OK\n&lt;account about=&quot;/account/1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;savings&gt;150&lt;/savings&gt;\n     &lt;checking&gt;275&lt;/checking&gt;\n&lt;/account&gt;\n\n&gt; Messages can be POSTed to resources:\n&gt;\n&gt; What about...\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /account/1/change\n&gt; &lt;subsume&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;account resource=&quot;/account/2&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/subsume&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 201 Created\n&gt; Location: /account/1/change/1\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /account/1/change/1\n&gt; &lt;subsume&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;account resource=&quot;/account/2&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/subsume&gt;\n\nReading this again, I think my suggestion is basically\nequivalent with what you&#39;re saying, but I am using different\nURIs.  Also, I choose not to mention &lt;subsume&gt;, betting that\nYAGNI will apply.\n\nyour way               my way\n--------               ------\n/account/1/changes     /account/1\n/account/1/changes     /account/1/revisions\n\n\n"}}
