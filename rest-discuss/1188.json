That seems a minor\nloss to me, because XML treats &#39; and &quot; interchangably in markup and &quot; in\ncontent can always be replaced with &quot;.\n\nAm I missing something major?\n\nmustUnderstand would have to be handled using M-GET as described here:\n\n * ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2774.txt\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
