And they define &quot;perspectives&quot; as tool =\r\nchests to help you work with those quality properties.\nHere you can see the=\r\n list of quality properties they offer perspectives. http://www.viewpoints-=\r\nand-perspectives.info/index.php?page=3Dpersp-intro\n\nBut, anyway, a there is=\r\n no standard list of properties. Actually, there are some of them that are =\r\nmixed with other ones, for instance security concern may be to avoid DOS at=\r\ntacks, which is also helpful for availability.

The b=\r\nook considers them NFP&#39;s where an NFP is\n&gt; defined as, &quot;a non-functional pr=\r\noperty (NFP) of a software system is a\n&gt; constraint on the manner in which =\r\nthe system implements and delivers\n&gt; its functionality.&quot;   Real architectur=\r\nal constraints evoke these\n&gt; properties but I&#39;m unconvinced that the proper=\r\nties are, themselves,\n&gt; constraints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, Roy, if you&#39;re ever near =\r\nD.C., you can borrow my copy...\n&gt; \n&gt; --tim\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
