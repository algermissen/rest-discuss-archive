This is exactly why I feel claims that JAX-RS isn&#39;t RESTful aren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; helping, they&#39;re misleading. And claiming JAX-RS is on the same level as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; WCF is somewhat insulting :-)\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are right. JAX-RS allows restful services to be created, and\n&gt;&gt; you guys are probably doing that already.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem that I see in &#39;our market&#39; is that, unfortunately,\n&gt;&gt; developers who did not read anything about how hypermedia could\n&gt;&gt; improve their systems pick the tool and use it in the same way as they\n&gt;&gt; were doing before, not benefiting from the usage. Don&#39;t you see this\n&gt;&gt; problem happening in the market?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I totally agree that hypermedia support should be added\n&gt; to frameworks, both on the client and server side, and I applaud your\n&gt; efforts to do that. I just believe that something like JAX-RS makes it a lot\n&gt; easier to build RESTful solutions than, say, the Servlet API or WCF;\n&gt; claiming it&#39;s not RESTful doesn&#39;t help anybody either.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nSent from my mobile device\n\n"}}
