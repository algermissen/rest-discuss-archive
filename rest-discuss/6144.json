There are applications that need sessions. Telnet comes to  \n&gt; mind, or\n&gt; Quake for a more modern example. Not everything fits in REST or HTTP.\n&gt; There are two problems that commonly arise:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Designing sessions into systems that don&#39;t actually need them.\n&gt;\nI think there has been some confusion in this discussion due to using  \n&quot;session&quot; to mean two different things. There&#39;s session the concept,  \nand session the implementation strategy.\n\nJohn I think has been talking about session the concept, a set of  \nrelated HTTP requests from a client. These are very common in web  \napps. Redirecting to get after a post falls into this category, for  \nexample, because the second request depends on the first.\n\nI have been talking primarily about session the implementation  \nstrategy, which is storing state on the server keyed by a session ID  \nthat you store at the client in a cookie or via URL rewriting, which  \nis included with subsequent requests. (I&#39;ll call this &quot;Session,&quot;  \nafter the name of the Java servlets class.)\n\nREST does not discourage sessions. It discourages Sessions.\n\nMost web apps run on one server and have modest traffic. For these,  \nSessions work just fine. But when you want to scale, Sessions start  \ngetting in the way. You usually feel the need to replicate Sessions,  \nor get the servers to share them to some extent. Also, the use of  \nSessions often results in the same URI having a lot of different  \nrepresentations, depending upon Session state. This hurts your  \nability to take advantage of HTTP caching to help with scaling.\n\nThere are solutions to scaling with Sessions. You may have to buy a  \nbit more bandwidth, more servers, and more programmer time to deal  \nwith a bit more complexity, but you can do it. But REST points  \nanother way.\n\nIf your application requires sessions, REST suggests that instead of  \nusing Sessions, use resources. Instead of creating a Session and  \nfiguring out what state to put into it, you ask yourself what the  \nresources are for your sessions, and put your state into those. My  \nfeeling is that it is just as easy to do a resource-oriented  \narchitecture than a Session-oriented one on a single-server web app,  \nand the resource-oriented approach may make it cheaper and easier to  \nscale later, if you ever need to.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
