The other URI schemes are only meant to show that\nsuch things as store-and-forward and UDP transmission can and should be\nimplemented as web apps.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think that Lucas&#39;s proposal covers many\n&gt; orthogonal messaging issues that are better\n&gt; handled with separate specs.\n\nIn some respects, yes.  For example the email binding is completely orthogonal.\nBut it&#39;s supposed to be, and is just there to illustrate (and understand) how\nsuch a thing would work.  In other respects, no.  The third solution wouldn&#39;t be\npossible without the second.  That is not orthogonality.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
