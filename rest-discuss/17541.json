I an unauthenticated user attempted a GET, clearly it should respond with a 401.  However, if an authenticated user attempts to GET, but that user is not permitted to access that resource, is that a 403? The spec says that &quot;Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.&quot;  If the user is already authenticated, it is true that retrying the request will not work, however, if the user tries to re-authenticate with different credentials, he would be allowed to GET the resource.\n&gt; \n\nNo, because access to the resource is forbidden.\n\nIf the user is authenticated already but is not authorized to access the resource, send a 401 - which will trigger, for example a browser, to show the login dialog.\n\nAfter entering the right credentials for a login that is authorized for this resource, the server will respond 200.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; So is there a cut and dry answer?
