Partial updates is very non-RESTful. Even if a user just \nwants to update their email address they should still have to upload \nall their other information. Remember, you&#39;re transferring resources \nnot resource fragments or resource parameters. Your idea of using \nPOST for partial updates seems a bit too RPC-like and it&#39;d only \ncomplicate most systems. Also in general you don&#39;t want to send fine-\ngrained messages such as &#39;change my email address&#39;. The SOAP people \nare just discovering this [see \nhttp://www.fawcette.com/xmlmag/2002_06/magazine/departments/endtag/] \nbut it&#39;s one of the fundamental tenets of REST.\n\nAlso the partial update problem isn&#39;t really a problem per se since \nmost people aren&#39;t dealing with obscenely large resources. If a \nresource is obscenely large and there&#39;s a strong case for partial \nupdates then there&#39;s nothing technically wrong with using POST to \nimplement partial update.\n\nAlso, as a last note, there&#39;s nothing that says the user has to \nupload the entire resource when using PUT or that the server is not \nallowed to perform processing on the PUT entity body. The server \nstill has final say over what is actually PUT&#39;ed to the URL.\n\n- itdp\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: &quot;inthedarkplace&quot; &lt;inthedarkplace@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s absolutely no reason to ignore PUT. PUT is very good at \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; it does and it makes little sense to overload POST to mean \nupdate.\n&gt; &gt; In fact, I&#39;d say using POST to mean UPDATE is a violation of REST\n&gt; &gt; because it suggests that there are user-visible, side-effects to\n&gt; &gt; simple updates which 99.9% of the time there are not -- this is \nwhy\n&gt; &gt; PUT is idempotent and POST is not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, your suggestion to use POST for limited updates isn&#39;t \nthe\n&gt; &gt; optimal solution 90% of the time. Coarse-grained messaging \n(which I\n&gt; &gt; think is one of the fundamentals of REST) has proven to be more\n&gt; &gt; scalable and it drastically simplifies the code that both the \nserver\n&gt; &gt; and the client must deal with. Further it makes all types of \nthings\n&gt; &gt; easier when you&#39;re dealing with whole resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; So POST should not be used to update a resource and PUT can only \nupdate a\n&gt; resource by replacing it, then how do you update only a part of a \nresource?\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@s...\n\n\n"}}
