Even if \n&gt; you did, you can always bootstrap it with one that isn&#39;t required to be \n&gt; reliable.\n\nI agree. I think POE is sound, formally speaking.\n\nThe chicken and egg problem I&#39;ve see is that, because HTTP is asymmetric \n(clients always initiate), then it&#39;s possible that either the client or \nthe server gets confused as to where things are at because the client \nnever got the response, or never got the response in time. I assumed \nthat out of HTTPLR by saying infinite requests will result in infinite \nresponses. Protocol axioms are wonderful that way ;)\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
