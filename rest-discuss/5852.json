You could do this in a cache friendly\n&gt; way on the client side (with javascript using document.referrer) and\n&gt; not create a new resource just for highlighting search terms.\n&gt;\nYes, you&#39;re right. I have a fear of JavaScript that I need to get  \nover. My concern is the test matrix. I like the fact that I can check  \nwhat comes out of:\n\nhttp://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy?q=REST\n\nAnd know that the XHTML is correct when it leaves the server. But  \ntruth is I plan to do JavaScript stuff anyway, so I need to figure  \nout a way to test what the XHTML looks like after the JavaScript  \nruns. Then I may as well do the keyword highlighting that way.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy\n&gt;&gt; http://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy?q=REST\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But from the user&#39;s perspective, they are two different views of the\n&gt;&gt; same piece of content, which is an article about REST. Therefore, the\n&gt;&gt; query string parameterizes the content, from the user&#39;s perspective,\n&gt;&gt; but not the resource. From the HTTP perspective, a URI is opaque, and\n&gt;&gt; each unique string identifies a unique resource regardless of whether\n&gt;&gt; it contains a question mark.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Query String is parametrising the content from the user&#39;s\n&gt; perspective and not the resource because *you* designed it that way.\n&gt; You could do it in the way I mentioned above and that would not be the\n&gt; case.\n&gt;\nI agree. I am aiming for RESTful and user-friendly URL design for  \ncontent-oriented sites.\n\n&gt; Let me re-state what I meant in my first post [1]:\n&gt; Request modifiers should not be put in the Query String because\n&gt; request modifiers are not supposed to affect the identify of a\n&gt; resource. When you put request modifiers in the Query String you are\n&gt; creating new resources where you shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt;\nI think I see. I believe I was thrown I was thrown by the word  \n&quot;creating.&quot; Basically, I think you&#39;re saying that you shouldn&#39;t  \nspecify data to be used for content negotiation in query parameters  \nbecause each set of query parameters embodies a different URI, which  \nimplies a different resource. Whereas request headers parameterize  \nthe same URI, which implies the same resource. Is that correct?\n\nIf so, I agree with that, though I am leaning away from most content  \nnegotiation anyway. For usability reasons, I think an article  \ntranslated into different languages should each have a different URI  \nfor each language. Likewise for usability I think the PDF form of an  \narticle should have a different URI from the HTML form. I do think  \ncontent negotiation would be OK for things like deciding between GIF  \nand PNF for an image, i.e., for forms of content that are  \n&quot;commodities&quot; or very substitutable.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
