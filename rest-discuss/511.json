Instead of &quot;watchable resource&quot; and &quot;Watched-URI,&quot;\n&quot;subscribable resource&quot; and &quot;Subscribed-URI&quot;.  Instead of just\n&quot;Location,&quot; &quot;Subscription-Location.&quot;  Etc.\n\n(2) Kill &quot;Event.&quot;  The semantics of change are\napplication-dependent.  For most things, the notification of a\nstate change is sufficient; HTTP already provides a mechanism for\nthen retreiving the new state representation.  (The one caveat\nbeing a change to a resource with lots of subscriptions could\ngenerate a GET storm, but the application designer should\nanticipate this.)  For anything other than simple change\nnotificatins, applications should define their own\nchange-representation notification schemes.\n\n(3) The language about message ordering is IMO dangerous.\nRequiring a publisher to deliver messages in order implies\nsomething about the server-side state that is perhaps best left\nto individual applications.  Instead, if (from the server / HTTP\nperspective) notifications do not carry state but are simply\nnotifications of state change, then message ordering becomes\nunimportant.\n\n(4) It might be useful to require an appropriate validator\n(entity tag or last-modified header) in every notification.  In a\nsense, clients are simply caches for particular representations,\nand the HttpEvents &quot;protocol&quot; is just a push-based cache\ninvalidation protocol.  We should reuse the appropriate pieces of\nHTTP in this capacity.\n\n(5) I&#39;m still uncomfortable talking about the mail binding at\nthis time.  That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s not important to have one,\njust that IMO it&#39;s best left to a separate specification.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
