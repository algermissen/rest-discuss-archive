Where your domain model goes, be it client or server, is\n&gt; &gt; not REST v=\r\ns. RPC.  It is a federation problem.  If your web app&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; client portion =\r\nis object-oriented and in the same trust domain as\n&gt; &gt; the server, and the =\r\ncommunication channel is secure, then your\n&gt; &gt; model can exist on the clien=\r\nt.  Your protocol still needs to be\n&gt; &gt; able to handle failure, though, and=\r\n you need to think of what\n&gt; &gt; tolerances you need before you design the AP=\r\nI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure I follow and wanted to check. I think you are saying that =\r\nyou agree\n&gt; with the using POST based commands for all updates, and maybe t=\r\nhat by\n&gt; running the same model on the client you can have it generate the =\r\ncommands?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As an aside, I&#39;ve never seen anyone debate CQS vs. REST=\r\n before.  I\n&gt; &gt; remember bringing up CQS to Stefan Tilkov as a basic REST p=\r\nattern\n&gt; &gt; (Jul 12, 2008), and he commented that he totally forgot about CQ=\r\nS.\n&gt; \n&gt; We might all be talking about slightly different things to be hones=\r\nt. My\n&gt; original thought was that Rickard is thinking of the sort of approa=\r\nch that\n&gt; Udi Dahan has described before (\n&gt; http://www.udidahan.com/2008/0=\r\n8/11/command-query-separation-and-soa/).\n\nI agree 100%.  Udi is trying to s=\r\nolve a totally different problem than me.  As far as I can see, whenever I =\r\nread Pat Helland, I feel like somebody is giving me a solution for a proble=\r\nm I don&#39;t have.  &quot;Solutineering&quot;.  Maybe people have problems for these sol=\r\nutions -- I usually see it as technical people solving technical problems a=\r\nt the implementation level rather than business problems at the domain leve=\r\nl.\n\nI don&#39;t quite understand how CQS has become lumped with Udi Dahan.  Why=\r\n not just call it UDI in capitals? :)\n\nMy application of CQS has to do with=\r\n how I conceive of deployment.  Look at how Udi explains things.  He assume=\r\ns you are already deployed.  That&#39;s not REST.  He then sort of acknowledges=\r\n that by saying:\n\n&quot;Of course, once we talk about web UI&#39;s things are a bit =\r\ndifferent - but still similar. While web-server-side there may be a level o=\r\nf independence, for browser side inter-component communications we&#39;re still=\r\n likely to target javascript. There, I&#39;ve managed to say something technica=\r\nl supporting mashups and SOA without lying through my teeth.&quot; - Udi\n\nSo he =\r\nmight have CQS using SOA separation, but not using REST separation.\n\nAt mos=\r\nt, I only assume I am partially deployed.\n\n\n"}}
