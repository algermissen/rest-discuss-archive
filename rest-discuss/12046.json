Whether a partially filled form \n&gt; submit succeeds is application specific, and even us mortals can&#39;t deal \n&gt; with partial forms correctly without explicit hints in the markup.\n\nI didn&#39;t say it was ideal, I said that it&#39;s the most widely deployed \nmechanism.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sold on sub-resource thing at all. I think if you want that,\n&gt;&gt; then use RDF, which has the sufficient conceptual weight to decompose\n&gt;&gt; data, and isn&#39;t muddied by syntax specifics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also curious about your comment on sub-resources. A sub-resource is a \n&gt; resource on its own, and a PUT should be fine to update it. By way of \n&gt; links, the server can decouple the client from having to assume that a \n&gt; resource is part of another resource.\n\nI don&#39;t see this being any better than what forms does today. Are we \ngoing to put rel attributes on every field to reduce coupling? The XML \napproaches I&#39;ve seen are very messy.\n\nOne of the thoughts I&#39;ve had on this is that Data APIs do not need to be \n&quot;symmetric&quot;. Having a different representation for serving needs and \nposting can reduce complexity.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
