That&#39;s why  \n&gt; I always call it XML Messaging. Unfortunately, most of the vendors  \n&gt; have created API&#39;s which completely ignore this messaging paradigm,  \n&gt; and indeed offer RPC-like functionality.\n\nPah. It started out as RPC. It just moved to messaging as soon as it\nbecame clear that it didn&#39;t really work.\n\n\n&gt; I blame the vendors, not the spec.\n\nYes. They must take a lot of the blame.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
