Mike says that you CANNOT statically\ntype a URI-described resource before the URI. Do you agree that this is\nimpossible?\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s like saying you can&#39;t get a pointer to an object before it exists.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but you *can* **name** things that don&#39;t exist, or don&#39;t exist yet.\n\nYou aren&#39;t listening. Of course you can&#39;t get a pointer to an object\nbefore it exists. But you CAN statically declare the object before you\nhave a pointer to it. And it is the static declaration that drives\n&quot;popups&quot; in editor tools. The same goes for URI references and XML.\n\n&gt; And if you know how to build such names, your domain of possible discourse\n&gt; in your application is much larger.\n\nI&#39;ll believe that when I see an application that demonstrates it.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
