If I send POs over SMTP and they get\n&gt; sent back approved or rejected, I am defining\n&gt; something that endpoints are doing.  I am not\n&gt; inventing a new transport protocol.\n\nI would say that if you standardize how this is done so that any client\ncould send any purchase order to any server and reliably parse the\nreturn result then you have a new protocol. If you are just building a\none-off app then by all means, use whatever software you&#39;ve got laying\naround. Do asynch FTP if it is convenient.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Asynchronous delivery may be one of your  problems\n&gt; and SMTP does a decent  job.  \n\nYou claim it does. But who do you know using SMTP for these kinds of\njobs? I know about thousands of complicated ecommerce apps using HTTP\nand none using SMTP. Even inside of organizations, most companies do not\nuse SMTP for asynch delivery of business-critical information. They use\nMQseries etc.\n\n&gt; ... And if your project\n&gt; is that big, I think you would rather reuse SMTP\n&gt; than invent a new asynch protocol just for your\n&gt; project.  \n\nRight. That&#39;s why you would like for rest-discuss to have defined a set\nof conventions for you to use. Now will you let us get back to work\ndoing that?\n\n&gt; ... The hard problems of security and\n&gt; accountability are orthogonal issues.\n\nThis is the crux of our communication problem. You think asynchronous\ndelivery is hard and using HTTP makes it harder. I think it is easy and\nusing HTTP makes no difference.\n\nI thin security and accountability are brutally hard and I think that\nreifying objects as addressable entities makes them much more managable.\nThirty years of Unix and even Windows NT supports my position. How do I\nmake it possible for a user to print or not to print? I treat the\nprinter (or print queue) as a resource and give them permissions to it.\nHow do I cancel jobs? I reify them as objects and then delete them. How\ndo I know who did what? I look at the logs for those addressable\nobjects.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
