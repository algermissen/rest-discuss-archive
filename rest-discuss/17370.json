All the more impressive,\nconsidering those new visitors were mostly after video content.  Is\nthere even a term for something an order of magnitude greater than a\nmere slashdotting, in both scope and duration?\n\nI&#39;d rather teach REST through positive reinforcement, by highlighting\nthe rare site which doesn&#39;t collapse in a heap of smoking ruins when\nsubjected to such massive, sustained traffic increases.  I wish the\nlinked article had cited a reference.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
