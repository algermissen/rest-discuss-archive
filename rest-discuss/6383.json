Since these other guys are waxing \n&gt; too theoretical, I&#39;m stepping in with some practical examples.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. In my current work I&#39;m using URLs like this:\n&gt; /entries  -  view entries collection\n&gt; /entries/1  -  view entry 1\n&gt; /forms/entries  -  html form to add a new element to entries\n&gt; /forms/entries/1  -  edit entry 1\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In Zope/Plone I seem to remember seeing something like this:\n&gt; /entries  -  view collection\n&gt; /entries/1  -  view entry 1\n&gt; /entries/new  -  new entry (form)\n&gt; /entries/1/edit  -  edit entry 1\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. In Trac (ticket system - see trac.edgewall.com \n&gt; &lt;http://trac.edgewall.com&gt;) they use:\n&gt; /report  -  predefined SQL reports\n&gt; /query  -  a form and report are displayed at the same time\n&gt; /ticket/1  -  display ticket 1 - html on top, editing form on bottom\n\nThese appear to me to not be RESTful.  I understand that you&#39;re supposed to \nuse only one URL for a resource whether to view, update, or delete it. \nPerhaps a different URL to create a new resource.  So having a seperate URL to \nget the form from seems unRESTful.  I&#39;m no expert on REST and still climbing \nthe learning curve here on RESTful design.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve found so far.\n\nSo, I&#39;d want to GET, PUT, or DELETE to /entries/1 and I&#39;d want to POST to \n/entries (or maybe /entries/new but &quot;/new&quot; seems unnecessary as there would be \nno other time to POST to /entries except when creating a new one so &quot;/new&quot; \nseems like fluff).\n\nScott\n\n\n\n\n"}}
