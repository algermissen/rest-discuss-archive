Whic=\r\nh has its good and bad aspects, but I would\ncelebrate it.\n\nBut the WS-* dis=\r\ntributed-object mindset is deeply embedded in\nenterprise development land, =\r\nand is difficult to abandon completely in\none swell foop.  Don&#39;t know if I&#39;=\r\nve completely abandoned it myself.\n\nSo some tough love may be in order (i.e=\r\n. Roy&#39;s response coupled with\ngetting Bill to revise the plans to something=\r\n more compatible).\n\n"}}
