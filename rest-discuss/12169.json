Such a client would then be unable to productively\ncommunicate with your server.\n\nYour call as to how much of a drawback that might be. But even if\nyou decide it isnâ€™t, why not require aware clients to send along\na header that requests this pipeline-means-transaction semantic?\nWhat would it cost you?\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
