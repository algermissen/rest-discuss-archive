For one thing, the vary header doesn&#39;t always give us \nenough to know how to identify a given entity. Consider a response with \nVary: Accept-Language; it might return the same entity for &quot;en-US, en, \nfr&quot; as for &quot;en, fr&quot; and it might not, so the values of Accept-Language \nisn&#39;t sufficient for a client or intermeditary to know that two \nresponses will be the same.\n\n &gt; I need to understand transfer-encoding better... I am unfamiliar with\n &gt; how the semantics of transfer-encoding work. But thanks for the pointer.\n\nTransfer encoding is much the same as content-encoding, but it happens \npoint-to-point rather than end-to-end.\n\nConceptually the exact same entity is transferred whatever transfer \nencoding is used, but encodings are used in the physical transfer of \nthose entities. Because of this issues about how something should be \ncached and how it should be saved are clearer with transfer encoding \n(once you receive it, decode it and then act as if there was no such \nthing as a transfer encoding).\n\nRobert Sayre wrote:\n&gt; An entity tag must be assigned before the range selection. Otherwise,\n&gt; a client trying to assemble a full result from two or more ranges (in\n&gt; multiple messages) could not match the entity tags to test cache\n&gt; coherency.\n\nAnd of course in this case it must not be a weak entity tag, because a \nchange of as much as a single octet could mess up such re-assembly.\n\n&gt; The specification must allow an entity tag to be assigned after the\n&gt; application of a content-coding, because it already allows the server\n&gt; to store its data in a pre-encoded form (and thus to require the\n&gt; entity tag to be assigned prior to any content coding would make all\n&gt; existing servers non-compliant).\n\nImplementation matters. When we receive an entity that&#39;s encoded we \nneither know nor care if it was pre-encoded, and for that matter if we \nreceive an unencoded entity we don&#39;t know whether it was stored \nunencoded or stored encoded and decoded on the fly.\n\nAll that matters is that if a client sees the same entity tag in a \nresponse for the same URI it can assume the entity is exactly the same \noctet-for-octet (if strong) or the same for most purposes (if weak).\n\n\n"}}
