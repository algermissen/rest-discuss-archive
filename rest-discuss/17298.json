A simple way to do\n&gt; this might be to kill queries that took longer than X seconds, a la simpledb\n&gt; [3]. My colleage Graham Klyne and I had a chat with Andy Seaborne about doing\n&gt; this with Jena TDB, which wasn&#39;t possible at the time, and Andy seemed to\n&gt; think it was doable (?) but there were details around how TDB executed queries\n&gt; and also how TDB&#39;s various optimisers worked that I didn&#39;t fully understand,\n&gt; and we never had the time to follow this through. I haven&#39;t done any recent\n&gt; work on SPARQL, so it may be that there are query engines out there that\n&gt; support this kind of thing out of the box.\n\nThat would certainly work in the sense of bringing the cost down, but\nit would be a shadow of a SPARQL endpoint from the point of view of\nclient expectations, no?  Its proper functioning would be dependent on\nfar too many variables that the client has no control over.\n\nThat could be remedied by the publisher documenting a set of queries\nwhich it can guarantee will complete in a reasonable time, because it\nhas optimized specifically for them (indexes, caching, etc..) ... but\nthen that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;d be doing if they put an HTTP interface\nin front of that data.\n\n&gt; So I guess I&#39;m saying, you may be right, but I wouldn&#39;t discount the viability\n&gt; of open sparql endpoints just yet, I think the jury&#39;s still out.\n\nI&#39;d be happy to be proven wrong because it would clearly be awesome to\nbe able to use SPARQL over the &#39;net.  Alas, everything I know about\nthe Web tells me I&#39;m not.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
