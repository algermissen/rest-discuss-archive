It might be necessary for clients and servers to\n&gt;&gt; exchange additional out-of-band information on the proper way to form\n&gt;&gt; the message for a particular media type (element names, order, etc.),\n&gt;&gt; but that descriptive information is something else.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that out-of-band info &quot;allowed&quot; from a REST perspective? I&#39;ve  \n&gt; always assumed that constraints on a general media types must be  \n&gt; communicated in hypermedia (just like the URI). In other words, you  \n&gt; need something like a &lt;form&gt;. Is that not the case?\n\nMy understanding is that when a spec tells you that some URI you find  \nin some hypermedia context (e.g. as link target with a certain  \nrelation) it is allowed to establish enay kind of contract between  \nclient(you) and server. What matter is that you discovered the URI  \nfrom hypermedia and that the spec defines which assumptions the client  \ncan make.\n\nOf course the use of forms increases flexibility.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I suppose the &quot;form&quot; constraints could also be fixed. ie. the  \n&gt; definition of application/orderform+xml describes the constraints on  \n&gt; application/x-form-urlencoded requests so no run-time info is  \n&gt; needed. Still, the available choices are a) something specific in  \n&gt; the definition of the media type(s) or b) something communicated at  \n&gt; run-time in hypermedia (or a combination of a and b). Make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally, the details of the entity body are only interesting to the\n&gt;&gt; two parties involved in the message (sender, receiver). From the\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries POV, they need to no nothing about this body - in fact\n&gt;&gt; should not be peeking into the body at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that actually a constraint? Some protocols, like SIP, place  \n&gt; explicit restrictions on what a proxy can do with the body. But I  \n&gt; wasn&#39;t aware of anything in HTTP that restricted the proxy behavior  \n&gt; this way -- and I can&#39;t think of a REST constraint on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
