I already gave an example of why they might need to be=\r\n\n&gt; different; because the requirements and/or design goals may be\n&gt; differe=\r\nnt.\n\nSorry, I missed your example. Could you point it to me?\n\n&gt; That&#39;s not =\r\nsaying there won&#39;t be any shared API - I expect you could\n&gt; share a bunch o=\r\nf &quot;util&quot; classes.  But I don&#39;t think it should be a\n&gt; goal to be able to sh=\r\nare important chunks of the API between client\n&gt; and server.  If that happe=\r\nns because the goals are similar enough,\n&gt; great, but it shouldn&#39;t itself b=\r\ne an objective IMO.\n\nIn our case, that was a goal added soon in the design =\r\nprocess when we\nrealized we were duplicating too many artifacts. We even us=\r\ne the\nsame API to access to the file system (using file:// URIs), to the\ncl=\r\nassloader resources, to SMTP and JDBC servers. REST talks itself\nabout prox=\r\nies to non-HTTP protocols. \nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch=\r\n_style.htm#sec_5_3_1\n\nOf course, that isn&#39;t intended to replace dedicated S=\r\nMTP, JDBC or File\nAPIs, but we&#39;ve found it to be a useful level of abstract=\r\nion. \n\nBest regards,\nJerome\n\n\n"}}
