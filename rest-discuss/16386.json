Bowman wrote:\n&gt; None of these problems occur when using registered identifiers to refer\n&gt; to standard media types... so tell me, why is it we want to *avoid*\n&gt; doing what the architectural style requires and HTTP strongly suggests?\n&gt; Less interoperability?!?  Again, the pushback befuddles me, why we must\n&gt; debate against every single plain-as-day REST requirement...\n\nI think one reason for the push-back could be that fine-grained,\nspecific media types can certainly have advantages. For example, in my\napplication I use JSON to return meta information about available\nresources, but also to return raw data when you access these resources.\nWhile currently I use application/json for both cases, this doesn&#39;t\nactually feel quite right. As I keep following links, all I ever see is\nthat with the next link I will get application/json. But that doesn&#39;t\nhelp self-descriptiveness at all. Sometimes I would like to let the\nclient know that the next link will return meta information (schemas and\nother such things), while that other link yields raw data (maybe records\nfrom a database).\n\nIf you are restricting yourself to IANA registered types, what do you\nsuggest is the best way to go about improving the situation I described?\n\n\nThen there is this blog post by Roy Fielding (&quot;REST APIs must be\nhypertext-driven&quot;:\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven)\n\nThere he writes:\n\n        A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in\n        defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and\n        driving application state, or in defining extended relation\n        names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard\n        media types.\n        \nHere he seems to imply that designing your own media type is OK\n(&quot;spend ... effort in defining the media type(s)&quot;). He also suggest\nadding hypertext enabled mark-up to existing standard types, but does so\nwith an &#39;or&#39;. Both options are fine. So, defining your own types is ok\nwith Roy, it seems?\n\nFurther in the same post he writes:\n\n        A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the\n        initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that\n        are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be\n        understood by any client that might use the API).\n\nHere he seems to be only concerned with server and client, not\nintermediaries. He says &quot;standardized media types that are appropriate\nfor the intended audience&quot;. While we can&#39;t be 100% certain, it certainly\nsounds like he&#39;s talking about &quot;standardized&quot; in a way that makes sense\nto the client (maybe using an internal registry or just the fact that\nclient and server code were written by the same person).\n\nThis seems to accommodate the case where I create a RESTful application\nusing my own (non IANA registered) media types, which is used across all\nbranch offices, where I know my clients and servers, but the traffic\ntraverses the public Internet.\n\n\nI understand your points about intermediaries on the Internet. They\ndon&#39;t know what to do with your data if the content type is proprietary.\nHowever, if you are forced to restrict yourself to IANA standardized\nmedia types, even if maybe something more custom-designed would be more\nappropriate, then you risk those same intermediaries to screw up your\ndata. For example, there are some proxies that will re-compress images\ninto lower-quality versions in order to reduce bandwidth usage. But\nthere was this one example (I think Roy himself did that?) where he used\na PNG to send a bit-array. &quot;How brilliant! An IANA standard type used\nfor something so surprising!&quot; we proclaim. But if that thing goes\nthrough one of those compressing proxies ... well, your information is\nlost.\n\nSo, by being forced to use IANA standard types for everything we could\ngive those intermediaries a false sense of security as to what they can\ndo with the content.\n\n\nJuergen\n\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nRESTx - the fastest and easiest way to created RESTful web services\nhttp://restx.org\n\n\n"}}
