The application\n&gt; &gt; thereby brought to life might sp=\r\nan several,\n&gt; &gt; unrelated &#39;services&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you ever seen ads for craft=\r\n products, eg glue,\n&gt; or fasteners, where they say &quot;thousands of applicatio=\r\nns!&quot;.\n&gt; That&#39;s how I interpret &quot;application&quot; these days. Thus,\n&gt; properly s=\r\npeaking, an &quot;application&quot; isn&#39;t a thing,\n&gt; it&#39;s a use of a thing to get som=\r\nething done, ie achieve\n&gt; a goal. To put it into IT jargon, an &quot;application=\r\n&quot; is a\n&gt; &quot;use case&quot; or in some contexts regarding state, &quot;an\n&gt; instance of =\r\na use case&quot;.\n\nCorrect, but...\n\n&gt; One of the worst things to happen to IT wa=\r\ns to use\n&gt; the label &quot;application&quot; for the thing being applied,\n&gt; ie a soft=\r\nware system. This is the root of all the\n&gt; confusion. Other words for the s=\r\noftware system would\n&gt; have been far better (and are sometimes actually use=\r\nd):\n&gt; tool, utility, program, service, site, widget, etc.\n&gt; Even the word &quot;=\r\nappliance&quot; would have been better. Why?\n&gt; Because it makes perfect sense to=\r\n say &quot;this appliance\n&gt; has hundreds of applications&quot; (think of a food proce=\r\nssor).\n&gt; In contrast, &quot;this application has hundreds of\n&gt; applications&quot; is =\r\nconfusing to the point of meaninglessness.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think one of the reasons =\r\nthat the label &quot;application&quot;\n&gt; was slapped onto software systems (instead o=\r\nf being\n&gt; reserved to refer to the use of such systems), is that\n&gt; so many =\r\nsoftware systems are SO specialized that that\n&gt; have only a single use case=\r\n, eg an expense report\n&gt; program has only a single application (ie use case=\r\n):\n&gt; submitting expense reports.\n\nI think you&#39;re missing a bit of history, =\r\nand consequently missing a\nlogic loop. The reason that the label &quot;applicati=\r\non&quot; was (correctly)\nslapped onto software systems was because they were use=\r\n cases for &quot;the\ncomputer&quot;. The software was an application of the hardware+=\r\nOS. And\nyou&#39;re right to notice that many of these were specialized dead-end=\r\ns.\n\nBut for many systems, each new subsystem implements a use case for lowe=\r\nr\nlayers, and yet may become a lower layer itself for further use cases.\nFa=\r\nsteners, for example, serve applications like bushings (and many\nothers), w=\r\nhich serve applications like axles (and many others), which\nserve applicati=\r\nons like vehicles (and many others), which serve\napplications like human tr=\r\nansportation (and many others), which serve\napplications like getting to th=\r\ne Joe to see the Red Wings. Modern\nsoftware mashups obviously have the same=\r\n problem, but so do stacks like\nIP -&gt; TCP -&gt; HTTP -&gt; XML -&gt; XHTML -&gt; expens=\r\ne report app -&gt; my flight to\nLondon. Each is an application of the layer(s)=\r\n below it. Some might be\nconsidered &quot;appliances&quot; but merely switching names=\r\n doesn&#39;t obviate the\nlayered structure.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
