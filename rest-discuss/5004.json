See Postel&#39;s law.\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=postel+law\n\n&gt; Tomcat offers me response.setStatus(SC_OK) for the former,\n&gt; Any suggestions what the latter might be please, if indeed\n&gt; there should be any response? Is the status response simply\n&gt; to indicate that content has been received, bad content or\n&gt; other  not being an http error?\n\nFirst of all, this is a Java Servlet API question rather\nthan something specific to Tomcat.\n\nThere is always a response. You should set the status\ncode, and use the entity body of your response to give a\nhuman or machine friendly description of what happened,\ndepending on what type of agent made the request.\n\nI think you need to refer to the HTTP and Servlet specs.\nSC_OK etc. are just hard-coded constants that correspond with the\nHTTP Status Codes.\n\n\nSection 10 lists the status codes and their semantics. The\nspec is clear on this topic. If you still have questions\nafter reading it, feel free to post them here.\n \n&gt; Would the more restful approach be to indicate at another\n&gt; URL that the post failed?\n\nNot really. The best approach is to signal the error with\na code such as 400 Bad Response. From the HTTP spec at\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1\n\n10.4.1 400 Bad Request\n\n   The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed\n   syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without\n   modifications.\n\nThis corresponds to the SC_BAD_REQUEST constant:\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#SC_BAD_REQUEST\n\nI think this is a direct match for what you are proposing because\nXML is syntax.\n\n"}}
