That makes a lot of sense, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it expressed that\n&gt; way before. Are there content-type definitions that make that explicit? (I\n&gt; suppose it mostly applies to xml or html-based formats, where the same type\n&gt; of language is used to express the state of the resource and the purely\n&gt; content-type elements.)\n\nA form (POST) that accepts only the values that represent the state of\nthe resource is one way to make it explicit (sigh... if only I could\nsay method=&quot;PUT&quot; path=&quot;/foo&quot; in the form tag)\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Sandeep Shetty &lt;sandeep.shetty@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hey Jim,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 2, 2009 at 1:12 AM, Jim Edwards-Hewitt&lt;jimeh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some parts that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clients are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an uncommon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; case;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I would think that navigation links, for example, would typically not be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; modifiable in a PUT.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IMO, you seem to be confusing between the state of the resource and\n&gt;&gt; its representation. GET and PUT allow you to retrieve and set the\n&gt;&gt; state of the resource. The data format used for transferring that\n&gt;&gt; state is the media type. &quot;Navigation links&quot; are specific to the media\n&gt;&gt; type and not the state of the resource. I could PUT\n&gt;&gt; application/atom+xml or application/x-www-form-urlencoded and GET\n&gt;&gt; text/html.\n\n"}}
