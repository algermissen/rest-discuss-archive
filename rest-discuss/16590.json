That&#39;s just a minimum requirement.  REST requires the identified\ntype to be standardized, too.  Which begs the question, &quot;What is a\nstandard?&quot;\n\nConsider the syntax of application/xbel+xml -- that syntax is defined\nby an RFC process, so it screams &quot;IANA-approved standards-tree\nidentifier&quot; to the world.  Getting it approved would require either\nconvincing IANA to recognize the Python Working Group as an approved\nstandards body for that tree, or marshalling an RFC process around XBEL.\n\nSo maybe I shouldn&#39;t set my sights so high, and consider something\nelse, perhaps as an interim strategy -- application/prs.xbel+xml has a\nmuch lower bar for approval in a much shorter timeframe.  Once approved,\nit would be self-descriptive, in that it&#39;s registered and points to an\napproved standard by *some* standards body, just not one recognized for\nstandards-tree identifiers -- no big deal to REST since that&#39;s just an\nimplementation detail.\n\nIf I have no intention of ever registering an identifier, then I should\nuse application/x-xbel+xml so as not to cause any confusion with the\nstandards-tree syntax, or indicate that I&#39;m not using IANA at all by\nadopting some other syntax, i.e. jabberwocky/xbel, which won&#39;t get\nconfused with the RFC-governed namespace.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
