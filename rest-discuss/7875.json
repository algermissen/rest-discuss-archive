IMO, more an more Web applications\n&gt; can&#39;t be strictly categorized as client-side or server-side (ex:\n&gt; mash-ups) so this wall that you want to raise seems unnecessary.\n\nOne goal of both WS-* and REST is that clients written in a multitude of \nlanguages on a multitude of platforms will be able to talk to each other \ninteroperably. The server does not care what language the client is \nwritten in and vice versa. At least that&#39;s the theory.\n\nIn practice WS-* doesn&#39;t actually interoperate all that well. .NET \nservers work with .NET clients and Java servers work with Java clients \n(if they use the same basic framework) but just try getting .NET servers \nto talk to Java clients or vice versa. You can do it, but it takes lots \nof debugging and detailed knowledge of which pieces of which specs are \nand are not reliable between platforms. Consequently most intranet \nservices are platform-locked and most Internet services aren&#39;t used all \nthat much.\n\nEven when interoperability is the goal, lots of little assumptions tend \nto get baked into the libraries that prevent other libraries from \ncommunicating. Sharing classes between the client and server is a real \ncode smell.\n\nConsider a Representation class, for example. The server sends a \nrepresentation and the client receives it, so it should be appropriate \nfor them to use the same class to model it, right? Actually no. The \nclient and server have different views of this object. For instance the \nserver is probably going to want some sort of pointer back to the actual \nresource from which the representation is derived while the client \nshould not see any such pointer. Furthermore, the client needs a way to \nget a byte array or InputStream for the message body in the \nRepresentation. The server needs a way to set the byte array or get an \nOutputStream for the message body. If you try to get away with one \nRepresentation class, then each side will have methods it doesn&#39;t need.\n\nThe only way to get the ideal client API is to design just a client API. \nThe only way to get the best serve side API is to design just a server \nside API. If REST is done right, then we shouldn&#39;t need to coordinate \nthe two design efforts. The interfaces between the two should be limited \nto HTTP.\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
