Don&#39;s perfect world is one where the Internet is a universal\nbus on which type-specific objects communicate.  That&#39;s a nice vision, but\none that is technically flawed in a very obvious way:  all attempts to build\nsuch universal buses for type-specific objects or components has failed.\n\nAgreement and problems with Don&#39;s POV:\n\n(1)  Asymmetry of HTTP is a problem.  No doubt, I am in total agreement.  But\nthe problem can be solved in numerous HTTP-friendly ways, many of which have\nbeen discussed on this list, more elsewhere.  That asymmetry doesn&#39;t mean we\nhave to chuck HTTP, though;  there&#39;s exponential value in putting an HTTP\nlistener everywhere there are resources of interest, exposing those resources\nthrough HTTP.  Dealing with the firewall is simply a matter of standardizing\ngeneric rendezvous intermediaries and how they interact with domain naming.\n\n(2)  His concern over long-running transactions is a red herring.  Think\nabout it this way:  existting client-server DB connection protocols support\ntransactions --- even long-running ones --- and transaction management at a\nsemantic level.  However, these things are modeled on top of RPCs, which are\n1-shot, synchronous, and provide no transactional semantics.  HTTP doesn&#39;t\ndirectly model transactions, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t build\ntransactional systems on top of it.  It&#39;s simply a matter of modeling your\n&quot;application&quot; (i.e., resources or domain objects and their interactions)\nappropriately.\n\n(3)  He fails to factor out the need for long-running &quot;transactions&quot; and\nasynchronous messaging.  They are related but different.  Again, HTTP&#39;s\nfundamentally synchronous nature doesn not prevent asynchronous\ncommunications patterns from being used.  Paul&#39;s HttpEvents spec, Mark\nNottingham&#39;s WARM / RUP work, and so on are nascent attempts to define how to\ndo asynchronous communications in a manner that fits with the current Web\narchitecture.\n\n(4)  Fundamentally, Don&#39;s got a very deep vested interest in seeing RPC-style\nSOAP interfaces deployed universally;  this interest is rooted in Microsoft&#39;s\nown deeply vested interest in maintaining balkanization of data and systems\nand integration friction.  To the extent that the Web architecture succeeds,\nit strategically devalues Microsoft.\n\n(5)  Don and the rest of the SOAP-RPC camp are suffering from yet another\niteration of a fundamental failure of software engineering and design.  Our\nindustry was sold a bill of goods about &quot;reuse,&quot; productivity gains, etc.\n-wrt- OO 10-15 years ago.  In the process of buying into the OO religion, we\nfailed to learn an important lesson:  OO rarely works as a large-scale\nintegration methodology.  Generic interfaces and generic composition\nframeworks have always demonstrated better scalability, reusablility,\nsimplicity, economics, etc. than OO.  Cases in point:  UNIX, Plan 9, the Web,\nLinda.  Until we as an industry learn the lessons these examples pose, we&#39;re\ndoomed to fail over and over again, developing technologies that cannot\nwithstand the test of time and ubiquity:  ONC and DCE RPC, CORBA, DCOM, etc.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
