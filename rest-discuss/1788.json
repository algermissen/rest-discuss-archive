The URI in a\n       POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed\n       entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to\n       some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.\n       In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed\n       with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the\n       server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.\n\nStill, how might subtle differences in interpretation of the non-GET methods\neffect the adoption of the REST model?  If web services are built that\ndon&#39;t follow these guidelines strictly enough, what sorts of\nproblems could emerge for developers attempting to integrate with them?\n\n[1] http://rfc.net/rfc2616.html\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;mbaker@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;jbone@...&gt;; &lt;robert@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2002 8:45 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Is REST CRUD?\n\n\nI don&#39;t like your description of POST there Jeff.
