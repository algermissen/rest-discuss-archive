Apart from the obvious things such as scheme and host for http\n&gt; uri&#39;s, which can reliably derived from uri&#39;s there are other uses mentioned in\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31.html\n\nAll of which are specific uses at specific points.\n\n&gt; As a human, I can guess from http://example.org/weather/Chicago that I may try\n&gt; to find the weather for Boston (where I&#39;ll be soon) in\n&gt; http://example.org/weather/Boston . \n\nAnd it may or may not work.\n\nAll a processor *knows* about the URI http://example.org/weather/Chicago is:\n1. That it identifies the same resource as another URI which is \ncharacter-for-character identical to that.\n2. Specific interpretation of specific components of the URI that it is \nits task to deal with.\n\n&gt; Whether uri&#39;s are opaque or not is a design choice made by the assigner,\n&gt; not an inherent property of uri&#39;s.\n\nNo, no matter how you design it, a processor does not know more about \nthe meaning of a URI than it is intended to know.\n\nIt may be its job to take the &quot;http&quot; portion and say &quot;this gets dealt \nwith by HTTP&quot;. It may be it&#39;s job to take the domain and do a look up on \nit. It may be it&#39;s job to take the pattern weather/(.*) and do a look up \nfor a representation of the weather in the locale with the name that \nmatches the final bit. It may be its job simply to see if it is a \ncharacter-for-character match for a previously seen URI.\n\nAnything else in the URI is unknown to the processor. That is, it is opaque.\n\nYou can&#39;t &quot;design&quot; something as opaque. \nhttp://example.net/tghyuioordsx/dsfyijalsd/sdxfuiuwe is no more or less \nopaque than http://example.net/weather/Dublin. It&#39;s probably more \nobscure (though not if http://example.net/weather/Dublin returns some \nrecommended low-cholesterol fish recipes) but obscurity is quite \ndifferent to opacity.\n\n"}}
