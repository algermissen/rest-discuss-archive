So, you would get:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GET /foo/map/@count\n&gt;\n&gt; Here the count is a path element, but how do you distinguish it from\n&gt; the key &quot;@count&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; URI encoding or some other escaping would certainly work, but that\n&gt; is  a source of bugs when a caller forgets to escape the &quot;@&quot;.  And,\n&gt; it gives escaping or not escaping a semantic character, which feels\n&gt; wrong to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; The alternative, disallowing &quot;@&quot; as the first character in a key\n&gt; would be a fine solution for specific implementations, but I&#39;d like\n&gt; to keep this model general, so restricting the set of valid\n&gt; characters in a key is unpalatable.\n\nYou are correct, we made the design guideline that &#39;@&#39; should only be  \nused for pre-defined suffixes.  You can always add an escape  \nmechanism if need be.  In the end, it was about usability for us.   \nUsing a legal prefix is simple and intuitive.  But, it&#39;s a compromise  \nas well.  So far, this compromise has worked out well for us.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://www.mindtouch.com\nhttp://www.opengarden.org\n\n\n"}}
