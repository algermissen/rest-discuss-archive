See the orignal\n&gt; hy=\r\npermedia paper by Ted Nelson*\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the uniform interface, that is pl=\r\nain common sense for such a\n&gt; small device.\n\nPoint taken. but not all small=\r\n devices have followed that strategy,\nright ?\n\nRoger\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; devdat=\r\nta\n&gt; \n&gt; *http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 18/04/=\r\n2008, yadnem &lt;r.menday@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Hi,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  I blogged about the way I think about REST at\n&gt; &gt; \nhttp://thegridisaw=\r\nebapplication.blogspot.com/2008/04/rest-and-ipod.html\n&gt; &gt;  (content inlined=\r\n below)\n&gt; &gt;  I would like to know from you guys how badly wrong I am ?\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  Roger\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Something occurred to me a while back, whi=\r\nch I choose not to mention,\n&gt; &gt;  essentially because if I had it badly wron=\r\ng, I would embarrass\nmyself.\n&gt; &gt;  But, I googled a bit, and didn&#39;t find the=\r\n analogy made elsewhere,\nso I\n&gt; &gt;  don&#39;t have confirmation from the REST ex=\r\nperts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I have 2nd generation iPod nano (not that the version matte=\r\nrs),\nand as\n&gt; &gt;  I navigate around the interface, I see something which in =\r\nlots of\n&gt; &gt;  places seem to be RESTful design. Firstly it seems to have a u=\r\nniform\n&gt; &gt;  interface. Furthermore, as I go through &#39;music-&gt;artists-&gt;elvis&#39;=\r\n, etc\n&gt; &gt;  ... I am navigating links. This is &quot;connectedness&quot; as described =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt;  RESTful Web Services. Actually, I would like to see more from the P=\r\nod\n&gt; &gt;  in this direction - for example, for the song I am currently\nlisten=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt;  to, it would be nice to see how this is linked into which playlist=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;  genre, etc. This would be going in the linked data direction.\n&gt; &gt;  F=\r\nurthermore, I believe I see a very nice example of the mysterious\n&gt; &gt;  hype=\r\nrmedia as the engine of application state, in, for example, the\n&gt; &gt;  stopwa=\r\ntch function of the ipod.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
