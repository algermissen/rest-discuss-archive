Can someone explain \n&gt; what he is saying here?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Likewise, the use of cookies to identify a user-specific \n&gt; &#39;shopping basket&#39; within a server-side database could be more \n&gt; efficiently implemented by defining the semantics of shopping \n&gt; items within the hypermedia data formats, allowing the user \n&gt; agent to select and store those items within their own \n&gt; client-side shopping basket, complete with a URI to be used \n&gt; for check-out when the client is ready to purchase.&quot;\n\nHe wants you to store the basket details on the client using URIs\nto manage the representations. The cost is coordinating client and\nserver software. I imagine that cost would less if the client could\nalso act as a server, i.e. you could get at the basket using HTTP\nmethods. It would be efficient insofar as you&#39;d stop routing around\nyour local CPU to do processing on the server&#39;s. Cookies may not be\nrestful, but the more appealing argument to some might be that they\ncould throw away their enterprise class web server infrastructure,\nload balancers et al and apportion some of the costs to the client.\nI haven&#39;t heard an argument for rest based on reducing server side\ncosts, it would be an interesting one.\n\nBill\n\n \n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.0.4\n\niQA/AwUBPPzvUuaWiFwg2CH4EQLwzwCgiY4ZxB7zVXpORPRBiKWcumiFUd4AoJl4\n7IZp/H7jS9Ne4clLuCChzSB8\n=C8E3\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
