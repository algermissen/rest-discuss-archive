If I  \n&gt; authenticate a user for a request, I send that user a personalized  \n&gt; version of the resource that says, &quot;Welcome, Chuck!&quot; If no user  \n&gt; authenticates, then I send the same version I send to any  \n&gt; unauthenticated person, that says, &quot;Welcome, Guest!&quot; The single guest  \n&gt; version gets an ETag and each personalized version gets a distinct ETag.\n&gt;\n&gt; As another example, I agree with Claude Montpetit&#39;s recent post (in a  \n&gt; different thread) that the same content expressed in different human  \n&gt; languages should have different URIs. In other words, I don&#39;t believe  \n&gt; in doing content negotiation on the Accept-Language header (for  \n&gt; usability reasons). \n\nI don&#39;t *think* that&#39;s what Claude said. Having a separate URI and NOT\ndoing content neg is not the same thing.\n\nBest practice in this area is surely:\n\n  http://www.example.com/somepage\n\nwhere somepage has:\n\n  somepage.fr.html\n  somepage.en.html\n\nand content neg is used to abritrate between them. The Location header\nspecifies the fixed location of the negotiated page. A lot of people\nseem to encode any links in such pages in the specific locale of the\npage but I think that&#39;s just because of the authoring tools. It&#39;s\nbetter to keep the plain uri because cool uri&#39;s don&#39;t change.\n\nI think we&#39;ve been over all this quite a few times. You might want to\ncheck the archives.\n\n\n&gt; However, I have been considering using that  \n&gt; header to decide whether to include a prominent pointer to a  \n&gt; translation of the content, if one exists. If a user requests the URI  \n&gt; for the English version of an article, for example, but indicate via  \n&gt; the Accept-Language header they prefer French, and I have a French  \n&gt; translation at a different URI, I&#39;ll send them the English article  \n&gt; but include a a prominent link to the French one. Here the user is  \n&gt; not authenticated, but I see this as a kind of personalization of the  \n&gt; content. It would get an ETag of its own, because it has that extra  \n&gt; link to the French translation.\n\nI think this is silly. You are ignoring all the work that lots of\npeople have done making content negotiation work for people who speak\ndifferent languages.\n\nIt&#39;s not supported well enough because there are too many people who\naccept the english speaking web. Support the standards and things will\nimprove!\n\n\n&gt; Would this be the RESTful way to think about personalization of  \n&gt; resources based on content negotiation?\n\nI don&#39;t think so. I think that you&#39;re methods won&#39;t be idempotent and\nthat&#39;s anti-REST.\n\nHowever, I will admit I have a hard time undestanding how\npersonalization can fit into REST. Client side script seems to be the\nbest solution.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
