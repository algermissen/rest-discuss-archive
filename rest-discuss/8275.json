However, quick research on the net suggests that IE, for\n&gt; instance, can&#39;t accommodate more than 2083 characters. I&#39;m inclined to\n&gt; believe that 2083 characters (not bytes) essentially is the limit of\n&gt; state information that can be included in RESTful request.\n&gt; In reality, the real limit is even lower due to URLencoding\n&gt; requirements.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any thoughts or comments are highly appreciated and welcomed!\n\nMore restrictive than that is the IIS path length limitation of (up\nto) 260 characters.\n\nI don&#39;t know if other web servers suffer the same limitation.\n\nEssentially, IIS assumes that the path represents a physical file and\napplies the windows MAX_PATH length (this won&#39;t affect anything after\n? or # in the URI). If you nest the virtual directory deep inside the\nfile system, this will reduce the supported path length even further.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
