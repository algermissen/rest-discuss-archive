In particular, I&#39;m using it for\n&gt; representing the &quot;entry point&quot; of my system, from where clients can\n&gt; dynamically learn how to construct URLs to other resources and start\n&gt; navigate the resource space. To that end I&#39;ve been using XHTML &lt;a&gt;\n&gt; and &lt;form&gt; elements as hypermedia controls.  \n&gt; \n\nXForms is also very useful for constructing URLs on the client.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Question:\n&gt; *********\n&gt; I&#39;d like to use URI template as hypermedia control in XHTML, as a\n&gt; (richer) alternative to my existing forms. What do you think is the\n&gt; best way to do so ? Specifically, how would you represent an URI\n&gt; template in XHTML (given it must be used as a hypermedia control for\n&gt; programatic clients)?\n&gt; \n\nConsensus will need to be reached, eventually, but I&#39;d suggest that URI\ntemplates be integrated into (X)HTML with new attributes -- any existing\nattribute which takes a URI (@href, @src etc.) may take a suffix of &#39;t&#39;\nto indicate the presence of an expansion model which yields a URI\n(@hreft, @srct etc.).\n\nThe real problem is how to indicate the allowable values for expansions,\nfor the purpose of generating a list of possible state transitions (just\nlike a form).  I can imagine doing this in XForms, and having a re-\nusable library.  I don&#39;t know the nature of the library you mention, but\ncode-on-demand is just as valid for generating a list of links (even as\na GET &lt;form&gt;).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
