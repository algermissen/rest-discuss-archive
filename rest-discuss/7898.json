The big boys are waking up and\n&gt;  discovering REST, and naturally they want to protect all us little\n&gt;  developers from worrying our pretty little heads about nasty things like\n&gt;  HTTP and XML by creating easy-to-use REST frameworks:\n&gt;\n&gt;  JSR-311 Java API for RESTful Web Services\n&gt;  http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311\n&gt;\n&gt;  Remember, these are the same jokers who gave us servlets and the\n&gt;  URLConnection class as well as gems like JAX-RPC and JAX-WS. They still\n&gt;  seem to believe that these are actually good specs, and they are\n&gt;  proposing to tunnel REST services through JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web\n&gt;  Services) endpoints.\n&gt;\n&gt;  They also seem to believe that &quot;building RESTful Web services using the\n&gt;  Java Platform is significantly more complex than building SOAP-based\n&gt;  services&quot;. I don&#39;t know that this is false, but  if it&#39;s true it&#39;s only\n&gt;  because Sun&#39;s HTTP API were designed by architecture astronauts who\n&gt;  didn&#39;t actually understand HTTP. This proposal does not seem to be\n&gt;  addressing the need for a decent HTTP API on either the client or server\n&gt;  side that actually follows RESTful principles instead of fighting\n&gt;  against them.\n&gt;\n&gt;  To give you an idea of the background we&#39;re dealing with here, one of\n&gt;  the two people who wrote the proposal &quot;represents Sun on the W3C XML\n&gt;  Protocol and W3C WS-Addressing working groups where he is co-editor of\n&gt;  the SOAP 1.2 and WS-Addressing 1.0 specifications. Marc was\n&gt;  co-specification lead for JAX-WS 2.0 (the Java API for Web Services)\n&gt;  developed at the JCP and has also served as Sun&#39;s technical lead and\n&gt;  alternate board member at the Web Services Interoperability Organization\n&gt;  (WS-I).&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  The other submitter seems to be a primary instigator of the Fast Infoset\n&gt;  effort to hide XML in binary goop.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is like asking Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic\n&gt;  Party platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Do we really want to trust these folks to define the official Java spec\n&gt;  for REST? Please read the JSR, and send comments to jsr-311-comments@...\n&gt;\n&gt;  I hope we can derail this completely, but we probably can&#39;t. If not, are\n&gt;  there any JSR members here who might join the working group and bring\n&gt;  some sanity and actual REST experience to the development of the\n&gt;  eventual specification? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we can at least limit\n&gt;  the damage.\n&gt;\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt;  Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt;  http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt;  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;                    \n\n\n\n-- \nDavanum Srinivas :: http://wso2.org/ :: Oxygen for Web Services Developers\n\n"}}
