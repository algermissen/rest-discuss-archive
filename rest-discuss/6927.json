I&#39;m utterly convinced HTML forms is the most damaging\n&gt; Web technology standard ever conceived - it demands. Nothing else is\n&gt; remotely close. It&#39;s confused maybe half a dozen web technologies (cgi,\n&gt; browsers, SOAP/WS, xml-rpc, web-mvc, Web2.0 apis). It coerces developers\n&gt; to the do the wrong thing; either with apps or framework designs.\n\nIt&#39;s not ideal, sure, but one could argue that it was the place of the\n*browsers* to support PUT and DELETE functionality from the menu bar,\nnot forms per se, i.e. &quot;File -&gt; Save to Web&quot; and &quot;File -&gt; Delete from\nWeb&quot;.\n\nIt would also be useful to support them from forms when that was\nneeded, but IMO, 99.9% of forms use POST properly from this POV\n(ignoring the POST(a) vs. POST(p) distinction).  Wiki editing is the\nobvious exception, but that&#39;s best done from the browser (WYSIWYG\nediting), not via PUT in a form IMO.\n\nIdeally, we&#39;d have both though.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
