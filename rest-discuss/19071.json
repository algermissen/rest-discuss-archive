A retry flag on retri=\r\nes would\nmake us hit this expensive logic only if it were actually a retry.=\r\n\n\nI can see both sides of the discussion. Setting a retry flag on a\nretry a=\r\nctually makes it a new message not a retry of the existing one.\nHowever the=\r\nre would seem to be many places where knowing something is\na retry can be v=\r\naluable (we have another place where over our custom\nTCP protocol if we ret=\r\nry from a master node to another node we mention\n&quot;by the way we think he mi=\r\nght be dead&quot; which can speed up the finding\nof dead master nodes.\n\nBack to =\r\nthe specific situation. What would happen is the client could\nstill retry i=\r\nn a normal form but would receive a lower idempotency\ncontract (eg it doesn=\r\nt break say a browser use case, you just get a\nlower contract if you don&#39;t =\r\nunderstand the concept of a retry). In\nparticular retries are assured to be=\r\n idempotent for a period of time\nwhere as if you can specify that its a ret=\r\nry we can give pure\nidempotency.\n\nThoughts?\n\nCheers,\n\nGreg\n\n-- \nLe doute n&#39;=\r\nest pas une condition agr=E9able, mais la certitude est absurde.\n\n"}}
