An equally\n&gt;     generic media types are more dilute, in that they have weaker\n&gt;     meaning but to a larger spread of clients.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Where you draw the line should depend on how wide a particular\n&gt;     application is intended to be distributed - extending atom is an\n&gt;     example of a good opportunity for compromise.\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, I buy that more clients will &quot;accept&quot; (potentially) the media \n&gt; type, but that doesn&#39;t really mean they understand it (from a &quot;get \n&gt; stuff done&quot; perspective), if the media type has been extended to now \n&gt; include semantics not defined into the original specification of the \n&gt; media type.  The client will just see junk.  Maybe &quot;reach&quot; is the \n&gt; wrong word to define what we&#39;re trying to describe here because I find \n&gt; it very misleading (personally).\n&gt;\n\nYour concerns point to the essence of the &#39;reach&#39; concept - the idea \nthat as you add custom semantics, the amount of clients able to \nunderstand decreases i.e. you are &quot;reaching&quot; less clients.\n\nExtending atom - &#39;basic&#39; atom clients will see the standard atom and \nyour extra junk, rather than &#39;just junk&#39;. That is why you would choose \nto extend, rather than start from scratch.\n\nI don&#39;t find &quot;reach&quot; massively misleading - what about that terminology \ncauses the problem?\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=define:+reach\n\n&quot; be in or establish communication with; &quot;Our advertisements reach \nmillions&quot;&quot;\n\n&quot; to extend as far as; &quot;The sunlight reached the wall&quot;; &quot;Can he reach?&quot; \n&quot;The chair must not touch the wall&quot;\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
