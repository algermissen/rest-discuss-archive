At least that&#39;s what I took by &quot;no guarantee&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So; if the fullness of a PUT representation is not observable, then\n&gt;&gt; what was the benefit of creating that restrictive definition?

I personally\n&gt; find it quite clear.\n\nWell the contention here is that it is *not* actually the bare minimum\nbecause it&#39;s over-specifies PUT in a way which is not useful in\npractice, and (on paper) prevents something that is useful; i.e.\npartial idempotent updates.\n\n&gt; Can you think of a good reason why the specification would have to say &quot;MUST\n&gt; guarantee that a state change is observable&quot;?\n\nNo. The spec is clear on why the state change cannot be observable,\nand I agree with it. That is exactly why nothing would be lost by\nchanging the definition to allow partial representations, because the\nambiguity is already present in the interaction.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
