He spent quite a bit of\ntime talking about how it wasn&#39;t at all clear that &quot;stretching RPC out\nto internet scale&quot; would work, and how a potentially much better\napproach would be to shrink messaging down to work &quot;in the small&quot;.\nAccording to him, the issue there is the programming model, which is\nwhat he said he&#39;s working on at Microsoft.\n\nWhen I wrote up [1] the various themes that Don touched on, I\ndeliberatedly avoided saying which side of the issues Don came down on,\nsince the writeup would have been waaay longer. My point was that the\nkeynote covered more ground thatn merely &quot;HTTP is dead&quot;, and the other\nthemes were also interesting questions in their own right. \n\n--Peter\n\n[1] http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: S.

To the extent that the Web architecture\n&gt; succeeds,\n&gt; &gt; it strategically devalues Microsoft.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a very important point - and you don&#39;t have to be a \n&gt; conspiracy freak\n&gt; to see it or believe it.\n\n\n"}}
