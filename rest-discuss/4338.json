For instance, if there&#39;s a resource /Users/joebob, to change his\n&gt; address when he&#39;s also got a ssn and a phone number, should the resource\n&gt; require a submission of the ssn and phone number as well? or is an\n&gt; implicit contract of &quot;if it&#39;s not submitted, dont change it&quot; okay?
