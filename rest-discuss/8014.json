It&#39;s called RESTEasy,  \n&gt; and you can read more\n&gt; about it here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://resteasy.damnhandy.com/\n&gt;\n&gt; At present, it&#39;s very much a work in progress and has many rough  \n&gt; edges and typos. It utilizes\n&gt; JAXB2 quite heavily and integrates very nicely with JPA and  \n&gt; Hibernate 3. It should be noted\n&gt; that JAXB will not be a requirment. Curious to hear anyones thoughts.\n\nUnclear as to how representations are generated. Where does the  \ncontent type get selected? How do you do content/language negotiation?\n\nYou confusingly talk about contactId being a URLParam when it is a  \npart of the URL path and not a parameter.\n\nHow do you do orthogonal request processing (authentication,  \nauthorisation, transformation)?\n\nHow do you map different parts of the namespace to the same component?\n\nWhat, for instance, do GETs to the following resources result in:\n\n   http://localhost/resteasy/contacts/12345/something\n   http://localhost/resteasy/contacts/12345?myparam=whatever\n\nCurrent REST thinking is that you update a contact by using the PUT  \nmethod, why do you use POST in your example? You don&#39;t give an  \nexample for creating a new contact or deleting an existing contact.  \nYou don&#39;t give an example for searching for contacts. Generally, in  \nterms of a REST hello-world example, it seems incomplete if not  \nincorrect.\n\nThere&#39;s a lot of sludgy annotation markup the purpose of which is  \nunclear and possibly misleading.\n\n"}}
