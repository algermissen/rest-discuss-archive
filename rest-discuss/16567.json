Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Eric Johnson wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Really?  They how come it seems like just about every response on this\n&gt;&gt; and related threads comes back with something to the effect of IANA\n&gt;&gt; registration is the *only* way to go if you want to be RESTful?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Because the alternative is to say, &quot;unregistered identifiers are self-\n&gt; descriptive&quot; which is irrational, given that Roy has said, &quot;Self-\n&gt; descriptiveness means that the type is registered...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not a purist, because I don&#39;t insist that REST be used when REST\n&gt; isn&#39;t appropriate.  I&#39;m only being rational when I insist that self-\n&gt; descriptive messaging requires registered identifiers -- if REST on the\n&gt; Web is a system&#39;s goal, then it&#39;s irrational to use identifiers Roy has\n&gt; declared not to be self-descriptive.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That constraints &quot;matter&quot; DOES NOT imply any requirement.  It just\n&gt;&gt; means, well, that they matter.  As someone who has worked for years on\n&gt;&gt; developing standards at the IETF, W3C, and OASIS, this semantic\n&gt;&gt; confusion isn&#39;t even a close call, and the semantics do matter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t what Roy has said regarding whether systems that disregard\n&gt; REST constraints may be labeled REST:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on\n&gt; the notion that hypertext is a constraint? In other words, if the\n&gt; engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by\n&gt; hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.\n&gt; Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Substitute self-descriptive messaging, or any other constraint, for\n&gt; hypermedia there.  Otherwise, we can call anything REST, even systems\n&gt; which have nothing to do with standardized data types with registered\n&gt; identifiers.  How does it help anyone achieve the goals of REST on the\n&gt; Web, to not point out when constraints are being violated?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On top of that, specifications get it wrong.  Maybe the RFCs are\n&gt;&gt; wrong? A few years back, I saw someone point out an error in the HTTP\n&gt;&gt; specification, almost six years after it was published.  Maybe Roy is\n&gt;&gt; wrong?  Maybe the W3C is wrong with some of its TAG findings?  How do\n&gt;&gt; we know, except to challenge assumptions, and follow those\n&gt;&gt; discussions to their conclusions?  Instead, you seem determined to\n&gt;&gt; shut off debate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; No, I share the same goals as you.  The folks shutting off this debate\n&gt; are the ones who keep bringing it back to a matter of me, personally.\n&gt; Like for example, stating that it&#39;s only &quot;my&quot; interpretation of REST\n&gt; where &quot;self-descriptive messaging means that the type is registered,&quot;\n&gt; when that&#39;s a direct Roy quote.  If Roy&#39;s wrong, then by all means\n&gt; folks, enlighten me as to why instead of insinuating that this is only\n&gt; &quot;my&quot; requirement.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not &quot;my&quot; interpretation, and there is no room for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;alternate&quot; interpretations, where the Web is concerned.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, er, except, there is.  That&#39;s the beauty of the chaos that is\n&gt;&gt; the web.  There are about two billion people [1] connected to it, and\n&gt;&gt; all of them are entitled to their own interpretations.  If they see a\n&gt;&gt; better way, let&#39;s welcome them, and learn from them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; In general, I agree with you.  However, Roy is an authority on what\n&gt; constitutes REST, and Roy says &quot;self-descriptive messaging means that\n&gt; the type is registered.&quot;  As with any hard science, I require\n&gt; falsifiability -- tell me why that statement is wrong, not that I&#39;m\n&gt; wrong to insist on it.  I don&#39;t see how it amounts to falsification, to\n&gt; attribute that point to me, then declare that it&#39;s OK to disregard it.\n&gt; Is there really some alternate interpretation of REST besides Roy&#39;s?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As someone who follows issues surrounding computer security closely,\n&gt;&gt; the distinction between intranet/internet is a convenient short-hand,\n&gt;&gt; but doesn&#39;t actually exist in practice.  Many &quot;closed&quot; systems send\n&gt;&gt; their traffic over the internet, sometimes via VPN, sometimes not,\n&gt;&gt; sometimes over HTTP, and sometimes not.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Of course.  But for any &quot;open&quot; system attempting Internet scale by\n&gt; following REST on the Web, those payoffs are achieved by playing by the\n&gt; rules (registering in IANA), not looking for loopholes and expecting\n&gt; REST&#39;s promises to hold true.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m only interested in helping folks with REST development for the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;common case of the Web&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OK. if you&#39;re only interested in that, then why don&#39;t you let the rest\n&gt;&gt; of us who are interested in other scenarios, actually talk about those\n&gt;&gt; other scenarios, without barging in and telling us that what we&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; doing is wrong for a different use-case that you&#39;re interested in?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve only &quot;barged in&quot; to make this point, where the context has been\n&gt; &quot;open&quot; systems targeted at the Web.  I&#39;ve consistently stated that this\n&gt; is not a big deal otherwise, IOW, I have been limiting my comments to\n&gt; the &quot;common case of the Web&quot; use-case I&#39;m interested in.\n&gt;\n&gt; When the rest of you start talking about how standardization of data\n&gt; types has nothing to do with the style, on the Web, then *somebody* has\n&gt; to point out that such systems are really some other style that&#39;s\n&gt; distinctly different from REST, otherwise the thread would be off-topic.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m specifically not interested in your use case, so I&#39;ve actually\n&gt;&gt; come to conclude that your responses are mostly worth ignoring.\n&gt;&gt; Repeating them over and over with respect to your scenario won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; change my mind, whereas addressing my scenarios might.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re talking about using nonstandardized types with unregistered\n&gt; identifiers without using the Web, you&#39;ll have no worries from me -- the\n&gt; only thing I&#39;ve ever said in such a case is, why are you bothering with\n&gt; REST if you&#39;re not interested in any of the benefits from the style,\n&gt; and have no intention to follow its constraints?  We&#39;d both have each\n&gt; other on ignore.\n&gt;\n&gt; For those folks who do give a damn about Internet scale, it&#39;s essential\n&gt; to point out the difference between tightly-coupled library-based APIs\n&gt; and REST&#39;s uniform interface, because optimization within the model\n&gt; leads to real-world benefits which *are* the goal in such scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Really?  Advice implies opinion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; My advice for those looking for Internet scale in their distributed\n&gt; hypermedia systems for the Web, i.e. the &quot;common case,&quot; is to follow\n&gt; REST.  That&#39;s an opinion.  It is not an opinion, but rather an\n&gt; authoritative, normative reference, to point out that Roy&#39;s definition\n&gt; of the term self-descriptive requires the identifier to be registered.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the question on the table applies to a different use case, can you\n&gt;&gt; please discuss from that alternate perspective, or simply hold your\n&gt;&gt; peace?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Where have I done otherwise?  If you look back far enough in this\n&gt; thread, what touched me off was the guy from Microsoft being led to\n&gt; believe that nonstandardized, unregistered types are congruous with the\n&gt; REST style, when his context is the &quot;common case of the Web.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n\n"}}
