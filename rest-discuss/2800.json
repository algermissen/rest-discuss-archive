I haven&#39;t developed a fool proof, simple model yet.\n\nBut I&#39;d say that it depends on your application.  If you consider\n&quot;invalid document&quot; to be a valid state of your app, then 2xx would be\nthe correct response.  This would be the case if anything needed to\nexplicitly reference the &quot;invalid document&quot; state, or if the\nimplications of the submission of it were more than just &quot;fix and\nresubmit&quot; (though those are the same thing, I think).\n\nLike I say, the model is a work in progress.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.
