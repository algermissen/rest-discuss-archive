Please let me know if\nI&#39;ve gone astray....\n\n1. Partial Repr=\r\nesentations\n\n   a. Is the argument being forwarded that, in general, partia=\r\nl \n   representations should not be used in REST systems?\n\n   Given that us=\r\ning sparse objects is a basic software\n   technique, this seems like a awfu=\r\nl lot to swallow.  Perhaps\n   though there are benefits to accepting this p=\r\nrinciple - akin\n   to accepting the use of XML as a common syntax; i.e.,\n  =\r\n the benefits of sticking with a common syntax/principle\n   outweight the d=\r\nrawbacks in performance, etc.\n\n   But the drawbacks need to be understood a=\r\ns there a quite a   \n   few that come to mind:\n    \n     i. The size of the=\r\n message.  In the real world a \n        representation are often large.\n\n  =\r\n  ii. The impact on the persistance layer.  If every\n        subelement is =\r\nbeing sent on an &quot;update&quot; operation, \n        there&#39;s no easy way to determ=\r\nine which columns (for \n        example) need to be updated, so they all ge=\r\nt \n        re-written everytime.\n\n   iii. There&#39;s no easy way to audit what=\r\n has changed in the \n        representation.\n\n   b. If partial representati=\r\nons are to be used to update\n   a resource, the &quot;diffgram&quot; should be sent u=\r\nsing the PUT\n   method.  \n\n   It seems that the understanding of the uses o=\r\nf PUT have\n   come a long way from the idea once proposed that PUT must\n   =\r\nmaintain octet-for-octet fidelity.\n  \n   Or must the PUT be refined with so=\r\nme header, a la RFC3229?\n   It seems to me that a new method would be in or=\r\nder instead\n   of tacking a header onto the PUT.\n\n2. Hierarchy\n\n   a. If pa=\r\nrtial updates are not in general allowed, then objects\n   high up on the hi=\r\nerarchy would virtually require their \n   subelements to be referenced and =\r\nnot directly included.\n\n   Otherwise, an unacceptable amount of data may ha=\r\nve to be \n   moved just to update a single attribute, etc.\n\n   b. This has =\r\nthe impact of requiring multiple round-trips\n   to pull back all the data, =\r\nunless some alternate hierarchy\n   is surfaced that allows, say read-only a=\r\nccess to the complete\n   tree.\n\nThanks\n\n"}}
