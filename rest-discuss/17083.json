It might help in significant ways\nin the area.  However, i do=\r\nn&#39;t think it is going to be an panacea.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It would then construct a =\r\nrepresentation to send to the server\n&gt;&gt; by iterating over the input element=\r\ns of the form, seting the values to\n&gt;&gt; ones extract from my wiki (based on =\r\nit&#39;s out-of-band knowledge about\n&gt;&gt; what the various fields in the form mea=\r\nn). =A0It would then make a\n&gt;&gt; request to the resource specified in form&#39;s =\r\n@action with the method\n&gt;&gt; specified in form&#39;s @method and the body constru=\r\ncted in the previous\n&gt;&gt; step.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why would it do that? =A0I&#39;d write suc=\r\nh a client by first determining the\n&gt; name-value pairs the API is expecting=\r\n, tell it which associated data\n&gt; from the wiki goes where, and POST to the=\r\n target as an urlencoded query.\n\nWhy would you ignore the hyper media contr=\r\nols on the page?  Why would\nyou honor the target of the form and not the sp=\r\necification of the\nexpected representation?\n\nWhat if the form is updated wi=\r\nth a new drop down?  If you use the\nrequest representation specified in the=\r\n form script would continue to\nwork.  If you don&#39;t it would only work if th=\r\ne server is nice enough to\nsupport both the representation it specifies in =\r\nthe page and some\nother arbitrary inputs that poorly designed scripts might=\r\n send.sent\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This would fail, or work only by coincidence, if a second=\r\n form were\n&gt;&gt; added to be page.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My way doesn&#39;t fail or break, but co=\r\nntinues to work so long as the\n&gt; server supports the name-value pairs as PO=\r\nSTed query strings. =A0I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand the requirement that I shouldn&#39;=\r\nt have to hard-code anything.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t break as long as the server doesn=\r\n&#39;t change or changes only\nin very limited ways.  The client has an even har=\r\nder time, because it\nis stuck asking html when what it wants something much=\r\n more specific.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It would also allow clients to work reliably with mo=\r\nre than one\n&gt;&gt; provider of the service. =A0I think this may be in line with=\r\n Mike&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; approach of converting content into structure by specifying it i=\r\nn the\n&gt;&gt; media type. =A0(Correct me if i misunderstood you, Mike.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ho=\r\nw you would design such a system to avoid such coupling?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I already h=\r\nave? =A0Any service provider can support receiving POSTs with\n&gt; the specifi=\r\ned name-value pairs as urlencoded queries, using whatever\n&gt; markup/forms la=\r\nnguage they want. =A0I understand what you guys are saying,\n&gt; what I don&#39;t =\r\nunderstand is why this is a problem if a domain-specific\n&gt; ontology (like G=\r\noodRelations) exists. =A0With an ontology, the markup\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter, bec=\r\nause clients are bound to, for example, @instance-\n&gt; of=3D&#39;foo&#39; rather than=\r\n any markup language or structure, allowing\n&gt; variation between sites with =\r\nless hard-coding.\n\nYes, anyone can write an autonomous client that is tight=\r\nly bound to\nyour particular service.  Often that is good enough.  Rdfa may =\r\nhelp in\nthe future.  However, i think it suffer too because the\nexpectation=\r\ns/requirements of the client are not surfaced explicitly in\nthe request.\n\nH=\r\naving multiple representations and using content negotiation can\nreduce the=\r\n coupling and associated maintenance cost quite\nsignificantly.  It allows s=\r\nervers to continue to support older\nautonomous clients, while continuing to=\r\n evolve and provide significant\nnew features.  It also allows autonomous cl=\r\nients to interact with more\nthan one implementation of a service by making =\r\nthe requirements and\nexpectations explicit in a specification.\n\nPeter\nbarel=\r\nyenough.org\n\n"}}
