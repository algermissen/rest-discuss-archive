There&#39;s no reason for that.\n\nInstead I stated that it would concern me it there were just &quot;arbitrary\ndifferences&quot; and asked it there were &quot;arbitrary differences&quot; that existed.\nI didn&#39;t accuse you of having any per se, and I thought I clarified that\nlast email.\n\nBTW, I&#39;ve been concerned about these issues far before your email; your\nemail just happened to come along at the right (wrong?) time...\n\n&gt; Out of curiosity, did you by any chance even read the\n&gt; pages for RESTEasy and then compare that with RESTlet? I\n&gt; get the feeling you only read the subject lines and went\n&gt; into a panic? \n\nPanic is far to harsh a word. I brought up a potential issue and asked about\nit. And no I haven&#39;t looked at your systems because I&#39;m not well versed in\nJava.  But I do want to see REST become a success.\n\n&gt; You also site interoperability issues, but again offer no\n&gt; details on what those interoperability issues might be.\n\nI&#39;m not an expert in RESTlet, nor clearly RESTEasy, so I can&#39;t know specific\nissues. But I know a lot about past systems where components are not\ninteroperable and the problems that causes. Just look at the fragmentation\nthat Python WSGI attempts to solve (have you looked at WSGI?)\n\n&gt; But yeah, it&#39;s probably true that I could have reached\n&gt; out to the RESTlet folks and seen what type of\n&gt; collaboration could take place, if any. And prehaps that\n&gt; opportunity could still be there, \n\nI would highly recommend it!  In large part that was the reason for you\ncomments.\n\n&gt; but now there is\n&gt; something I could point them at to see if we&#39;re all on\n&gt; the same page. Plus, people may have a look at it an say\n&gt; that it&#39;s the lamest attempt ever.  Either way, it&#39;s out\n&gt; there for people to see an review. \n\nOne of the reasons why I made my comment was because of the title of the\nthread &quot;New REST framework for Java&quot;, the fact it has a marketing-friendly\nname, it&#39;s own subdomain, and a website with Tutorials and such implied to\nme you are promoting a &quot;new REST framework for Java&quot; as an alternative to\nother solutions. It came across as far more than a thought exercise and\ninstead something you were hoping to promote to see significant adoption.\nHad the email said &quot;I&#39;m trying to see if I get this REST thing right. I&#39;ve\nwritten some code and would appreciate people looking at it to tell me I&#39;m\non the right track.&quot; I wouldn&#39;t have said a word.\n\nHowever, IMO, when you introduce a framework and you promote it to gain\nusers, you have implicitly taken on much responsibility, and you can have a\nnegative effect on the microcosm of the world if you create Y.A.F. without\nhaving good justification for doing so.\n\nTo illustrate, let&#39;s discuss a hypothetical single framework that then has\ntwo competing implementations that add no real value, they are just\ndifferent to be different.  Before, someone would just choose the one.\nAfterwards, people need to invest significant time into evaluating the\ndifferent frameworks before choosing.  And instead of everyone contributing\nto one, now you have contributions divided among three. Different training\nis required to be developed. Finding developers with experience in a\nspecific one is harder. Etc. etc.  Essentially you limit the network\neffects, and network effects can provide huge value.\n\nActually neither situation is ideal. What&#39;s better, IMO is to work against\nshared interfaces when possible, and implement divergent enhancements off\nthose shared interfaces. Without doing that, you end up with solutions that\njust cannot be had because of an either/or situation.\n\nOne reason Microsoft has such success is there is far less fragmentation\nthat occurs on the Windows platform. People look to Microsoft to set the\nstandards. In other areas fragmentation rationalized by &quot;programmer choice&quot;\nbalkanizes the development landscape and reduces critical mass for any one\nsolution.  BTW, there are many other different issues I have with\nMicrosoft&#39;s approach which I&#39;ve blogged about a lot lately [1], so don&#39;t\nview me as a Microsoft proponent, I just recognize value when I see it.\n\nBTW, I&#39;m not saying that nobody should build and promote multiple solutions,\njust that DRTWWNN (Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel when not necessary), BOSIWP\n(Build on shared Interfaces whenever possible), and ASFI (Always Strive for\nInteroperability) be considered right up there with DRY (Don&#39;t repeat\nyourself) and other best practices in software engineering.\n\n&gt; Additionally, I am in\n&gt; the process of trying to join JSR-311 if my employer\n&gt; would get off their arses and sign Exhibit B ;) \n\nGood deal!\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n[1] http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/category/Microsoft\n\nP.S. As an aside, it is ironic for me that I would get pushback in a REST\nforum on the issue of constraining interfaces when one of Roy Fieldings main\njustifications for the benefits of REST is that there are four (4) well\nknown and universally implemented verbs, and for all practical purposes, NO\nMORE. That is one of the reasons I so believe in REST, and it is also one of\nthe reasons I think lots of different implementations are in general a Bad\nThing(tm).  FWIW.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n"}}
