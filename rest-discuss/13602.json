The architectures I build at the moment are=\r\n all\n&gt; real-time, so while REST is a template I have weakened statelessness=\r\n\n&gt; and essentially substituted cache for pub/sub. This is actually\n&gt; changi=\r\nng over time and the architecture is just starting to come into\n&gt; closer al=\r\nignment with REST as developers begin to understand that even\n&gt; in a real-t=\r\nime system poll+cache turns out to solve many problems\n&gt; better.\n&gt; \n\nBenjam=\r\nin,\nI suggest you take a look at CCXML (http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml/). It&#39;s =\r\na hypermedia format for interfacing with a call control system -- it essent=\r\nially places a RESTful layer on top of a real-time, asynchronous event driv=\r\nen system. The model used might be something you might be able to borrow fr=\r\nom even if the domain is different from what you are working on.\n\nThe thing=\r\n that might stand out is that the call control system is the client in the =\r\nRESTful client-server relationship which is backwards from what most folks =\r\nmight expect. This makes the call control system a &quot;browser&quot; that multiple =\r\nservices can be targeted to. A key reason it fits better as the client is t=\r\nhat calls are a key component of the session state -- they essentially are =\r\nmedia sessions.\n\nEven if you don&#39;t take a look, a key take away that&#39;s help=\r\ned me is this:\n-- If you are working with a machine to machine system and f=\r\nind that you often need to break the statelessness constraint, then try rev=\r\nersing the roles of client and server and see if that helps.\n\nAnd if you do=\r\n take a look at think you might want to define a similar state-machine-base=\r\nd hypermedia format, you should take a look at SCXML: http://www.w3.org/TR/=\r\nscxml/ . It might be a good starting point.\n\nRegards, \n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
