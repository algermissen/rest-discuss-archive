REST is about\n&gt; building web services. Here&#39;s what I see as the difference: with\n&gt; cross-network scripting you are trying to hide many of the differences\n&gt; between making a local call and making a remote call. That&#39;s great for\n&gt; ease of use but it sacrifies a bunch of stuff in terms of\n&gt; addressability, scalability, peformance and potentially security. I am\n&gt; totally in favour of this trade-off where it makes sense. I advocate\n&gt; XML-RPC as a viable alternative to REST with the caveat that I am\n&gt; nervous about its reliance on &quot;ASCII&quot; and a few other things like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is about taking the networking issues most seriously. This means\n&gt; that the interface to networked code is different than to local code.\n&gt; Not harder, but different. Both client and server have to think\n&gt; differently when they access networked code. You could paper over the\n&gt; differences on the client side with an OO library but this might\n&gt; introduce performance or reliability problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my mind, web services are about doing the sorts of things we couldn&#39;t\n&gt; do with COM or CORBA (otherwise why invent a new buzzword) so I don&#39;t\n&gt; see XML-RPC (or SOAP RPC) as a Web Services technology. I am happy to\n&gt; promote XML-RPC as a cross-network scripting tool, however, and I have.\n\nDave Winer says:\n&gt; BTW, thanks for the positive energy -- I feel much better about this stuff\n&gt; now that it isn&#39;t all or nothing, as some people have cast it in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will look for an opportunity to define an interface, in public, both ways.\n\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
