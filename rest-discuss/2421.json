We touched on this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before. What is the &#39;function&#39; of an HTTP PUT?  I.e., which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mapping are we interested in?  Clearly, sometimes it&#39;s resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before-and-after state.  At other times it may be more like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; request-to-response mapping?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I think that&#39;s right.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand the distinction I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK, I think this example illustrates the difference,\n&gt; \n&gt;   DELETE /foo   =&gt;  200 OK\n&gt;   DELETE /foo   =&gt;  404 Not Found\n&gt; \n&gt; On the resource/server state view the only things which count towards \n&gt; idempotence are changes of state at the server (I take this to be the \n&gt; REST view). Because the effect on the server of deleting /foo two or \n&gt; more times is the same as the effect on the server of \n&gt; deleting it just \n&gt; once we can count DELETE as idempotent.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the client-visible-effects view the result is relevant \n&gt; (maybe as well \n&gt; as server state, maybe instead of). Because the client \n&gt; visible results \n&gt; of the second and subsequent deletions of /foo are different \n&gt; from that \n&gt; of the first we can&#39;t count DELETE as idempotent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that RFC 2616 stipulates that DELETE is idempotent it seems as \n&gt; tho&#39; the client-visible-effects view must be wrong. But that can&#39;t be \n&gt; the whole story because of RFC 2616&#39;s allusions to non-idempotent \n&gt; sequences of idempotent requests. If my proof that on the resource/ \n&gt; server view all sequences of idempotent requests are idempotent \n&gt; sequences is correct, then either there&#39;s something wrong \n&gt; with RFC 2616 \n&gt; (maybe the discussion of non-idempotent sequences should be \n&gt; dropped, or \n&gt; maybe there&#39;s an inconsistency somewhere), or there&#39;s something wrong \n&gt; with the resource/server state view and hence a disconnect \n&gt; between REST \n&gt; and RFC 2616.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We haven&#39;t had any troubles.  We tried to use Jeff Mogul&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; out-of-order spec, but had practical issues with it (it \n&gt; requires using\n&gt; &gt; a new client stack).  But we don&#39;t have a lot of heard reliability\n&gt; &gt; guarantees in our use of our platform, so it&#39;s possible that I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; missing an edge case that demonstrates the disconnect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does your client stack implement request piplining? If it \n&gt; does, there&#39;s \n&gt; presumably somewhere where a decision has to be made about whether to \n&gt; pipeline a request immediately or wait for pending responses \n&gt; to arrive. \n&gt; I played cautious and only allowed piplining for GET and then only if \n&gt; the only pending responses were for GETs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Miles\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
