Extendi=\r\nng it to understand a data format seems like quite a reasonable thing to do=\r\n. Using a base serialization format such as XML or JSON for your data forma=\r\nt (as well as the appropriate mime-type) does provide a reasonable amount o=\r\nf visibility as well. There is also a certain amount of native support in t=\r\nhe UA for these serialization formats as well. Javascript code that underst=\r\nand the schema and semantics of your XML/JSON is not significantly unlike a=\r\n script that understand constraints that you&#39;ve put on your HTML, for examp=\r\nle, code that knows that some &lt;span&gt; elements will have a specific @class v=\r\nalue that will imply that certain behavior should occur when the element is=\r\n clicked.\n\nWhere&#39;s the violation of REST&#39;s constraints? I would say you&#39;ve =\r\ngone too far only when you are using code-on-demand to implement something =\r\nthat the UA already does natively (with little or no gain in non-functional=\r\n areas such as visible latencies or perhaps portability).
