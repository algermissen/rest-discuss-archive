If you can connect things through\nhyperlinks rather than URI combinations then increasingly your &quot;service\ndescription&quot; can be considered an outgrowth of your &quot;vocabulary\ndescription&quot;. I think of REST as pushing as much of the incompatibility\nof the world down into the vocabulary description. Vocabularies *must*\nvary (that&#39;s the whole point of XML). As we&#39;ve demonstrated, method name\ndo NOT NEED to vary, so push the incompatibility OUT of the method names\nand down into the markup.\n\n&gt; &lt;http://www.markbaker.ca/&gt; :wears &lt;http://www.markbaker.ca/current-clothes/&gt;\n\nMark uses RDF.

So I would\nsay that out-of-line declarations are a fallback and inline I would\ndiscriminate against RDF because I wouldn&#39;t want to add syntactic\ncomplexity to my documents.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
