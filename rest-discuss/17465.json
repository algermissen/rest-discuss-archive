This is a question about what HTTP is, not REST. There are two competing interpretations of what HTTP PUT is. Whichever wins out, either would be self-descriptive.\n\nLet&#39;s try it this way: What would the definition of a method be that does partial update and is idempotent?\n\nKeep in mind that you cannot make the definition depend on a media type. Hence you can only specify that the server has to apply the entity body as a partial update *according to the semantics of the media type used*. How can you guarantee that this is always idempotent?\n\n\n(IOW, you cannot be more specific for partial updates than PATCH already is.)\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
