In this group you have many people t=\r\nhat actually do that, uses terms of what we understand, while other underst=\r\nand different things. There are discussions that focus on that, defining th=\r\ne terms. So, we would need to put the group to agree, and that may be probl=\r\nematic, since actually disagreement lead to healthy discussions.\nEven, some=\r\n people just left the group because majority did not agree with them, which=\r\n turns out bad.\n\n2. The other problem is we all have different levels of un=\r\nderstanding of REST. There are many that work with this everyday, and thus =\r\nthere are some things that are a de facto reality, although academically ma=\r\ny not be totally congruent with the dissertation. Far more, the dissertatio=\r\nn, some one proposed, may need an update since lots of things had happened =\r\nsince then.\n\nSo, what can we do? The actually existence of this group is a =\r\nstep forward. Actual promotion of the group so it is available to more peop=\r\nle is necessary. \nThe This week on REST wiki is another great idea.\nOpening=\r\n a site with the &quot;official&quot; definitions and tutorial from all levels (not j=\r\nust development) could be another one. Problem is we may have some trouble =\r\ngetting all people, or majority, to agree on some definitions. \n\nAny way, t=\r\nhe solution may come out from this group, or even from another one that may=\r\n start somewhere else. Not sure if the future of REST concept will be close=\r\nr to original idea or a derivation from the actual practices, but at some p=\r\noint there must be an agreement, or the concept will be diluted.  \n\nWilliam=\r\n Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Ivan =C5=BDu=C5=BEak &lt;izuz=\r\nak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few days ago I wrote a blog post on why =\r\nI think understanding REST\n&gt; is hard and what we can and *should* do about =\r\nit -\n&gt; http://wp.me/poYaf-34. Since a lot of what I wrote was inspired by\n&gt;=\r\n following this group and since this group is the most relevant (only?)\n&gt; p=\r\nlace for discussing REST - I&#39;d like to know what you think. Short\n&gt; version=\r\n (since the post is really long):\n&gt; \n&gt; Although there&#39;s a lot of great blog=\r\n posts, papers and mailing list\n&gt; discussions, the current material on REST=\r\n is a mess which makes REST\n&gt; hard to understand and confusing to discuss:\n=\r\n&gt; * there is no agreed upon and widely used terminology, but a lot of\n&gt; une=\r\nxplained and overlapping terms,\n&gt; * discussions are fragmented all over the=\r\n web and often unnecessarily\n&gt; repeat previous discussions,\n&gt; * there are n=\r\no (formal or semi-formal) models of (important) concepts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, I=\r\n think people involved in and enthusiastic about REST\n&gt; (mostly people on t=\r\nhis group) should:\n&gt; 1. Agree that there is a problem worth fixing =E2=80&quot; =\r\ndo we think that we\n&gt; can create a better, clearer and more systematized wa=\r\ny of\n&gt; understanding and discussing about REST?\n&gt; 2. Express interest in fi=\r\nxing it =E2=80&quot; is this something people want to\n&gt; contribute their time to=\r\n?\n&gt; 3. Agree on how to fix it =E2=80&quot; what should be our output (a RESToped=\r\nia, a\n&gt; document, video tutorials) and how would we all contribute to and\n&gt;=\r\n moderate the process?\n&gt; 4. Do it =E2=80&quot; spend time discussing and develop=\r\ning the output.\n&gt; 5. Eat our dogfood =E2=80&quot; use whatever we produce. If we=\r\n don=E2=80=99t use the\n&gt; terminology and models we agree upon, the the mess=\r\n has only gotten\n&gt; bigger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Ivan (hoping that all of this doe=\r\nsn&#39;t sound as babbling of an\n&gt; overeagerly naive megalomaniac)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
