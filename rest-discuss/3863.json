Its tragic flaw is that \nit did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface to \nachieve the value it promised.  To be perfectly clear about the problem:\n\n* Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the state of a \nresource into a response to a GET request, a client can have ABSOLUTELY NO \nIDEA what the content of that response means; it is simply has bits that \ncan mean anything at all.\n\n* Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses PUT/POST-ed \ncontent to change the state of a resource, a client can have ABSOLUTELY NO \nIDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.\n\nRoy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary and specified \nat the whim of the server operator on a per-URI basis.  I think these \nmodels should be standardized in some manner and be URI independent.\n\nThis conflict stems from different views of the nature of an HTTP resource \nitself.  Roy says:\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAny information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a \ntemporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los Angeles&quot;), a collection of \nother resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other \nwords, any concept that might be the target of an author&#39;s hypertext \nreference must fit within the definition of a resource.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nBecause Roy&#39;s resources are so abstract, access to them has to be mediated \nby agents of arbitrary power and complexity.  Allowing clients to interact \nwith agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then requires that \nservice operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to have essentially \narbitrary meanings.\n\nBut resources don&#39;t really need to be so abstract and the meanings of HTTP \nmethods don&#39;t need to be so loose.  Programs don&#39;t actually manipulate \n&quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;non-virtual objects;&quot; they just manipulate bits.  It would \nbe more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits \nwhose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose meaning \nis determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.  To say \notherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect between \nhaving an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a server \nnotify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that there \nis a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP \nserver itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the \nInternet and interacting via HTTP.\n\nViewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special* \nhidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent mediates \naccess.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and across \nthe Internet can use any data structures they want for their activities but \nthat their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an HTTP \nserver as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for communication \nbetween these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared *explicit \nmodel* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be \nchanged.\n\nThanks to Roy and ReST we know the basic operations we need.  GET is a \nretrieval of whatever is on the universal blackboard at a particular \nlocation.  PUT replaces what is on the blackboard at that location.  DELETE \nerases it.  POST adds to it.  But we also need a shared *explicit model* of \nexactly how these operations work.  That project of defining these \n*explicit models* is what I am promoting under the name, MoST.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS Bill, I have heard of speech acts, but I don&#39;t know how they apply here.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

It seems to me that MoST is just an additional layer above ReST,\n&gt; but you appearently believe the two architectures are dissimilar.  When\n&gt; you get a working model of this MoST approach up, I would certainly like\n&gt; to see more. Until then, I think the REST approach provides good\n&gt; guidelines that have significantly improved (and are continuing to\n&gt; improve) the design of my applications.  If you can offer something\n&gt; better, I&#39;m all ears.  But at this point, I just don&#39;t see what you seem\n&gt; to see.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
