Obviously, to compare we need =\r\na set of criteria, like abstraction level, domain matching, paradigm matchi=\r\nng, etc. JAX-RS in particular seems a little wrap of servlets, nothing more=\r\n that a set of tools to translate HTTP requests into the Java realm (has a =\r\ncouple of nice things, granted), but not of much help to build truly RESTfu=\r\nl systems. And as you mention, there is a problem with the domain matching,=\r\n as you have to learn concepts that are not in the REST domain.\n\nAnyway, no=\r\n one will learn to swim without getting wet, so my advice is to try first. =\r\nAnd not all are JAX-RS.\n\nWilliam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
