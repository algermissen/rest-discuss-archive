The second GET changes the state of\nthe transaction.  In particular, the result of the\nGET is that the transaction may fail may cause the\nsubsequent sequence of actions to fail (if URI1\nchanges before the second PUT).\n\nNote: You want this transaction to fail because\nperhaps VALUE is computed from the content of\nURI1 (e.g. you are incrementing the value of\nsomething).\n\n-Alex-\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.

Are you saying\n&gt; that the GET itself induces a state change in the\n&gt; resource it was applied to?  Or are you saying that\n&gt; an agent uses GET to decide whether to change\n&gt; some other resource (in this case, a transaction, as\n&gt; in commit or rollback)?\n&gt;\n&gt; If it&#39;s the latter, then you&#39;re not really talking about\n&gt; a property of the GET, and so no rules appear to be\n&gt; broken.\n&gt;\n&gt; If it&#39;s the former, I don&#39;t see how.\n&gt;\n&gt; Walden\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
