Of course an \n&gt; operation \n&gt; will return different responses. When you PUT to an object \n&gt; that doesn&#39;t \n&gt; exist you get Created. When you PUT again, you don&#39;t. Idempotency is \n&gt; about *side-effects* which I take to mean anything outside of the \n&gt; request/response pair.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Now, let&#39;s move on to PUT.  When PUT is used, and the \n&gt; resource did not\n&gt; &gt; exist, then a 201 (Created) response is expected.  \n&gt; Subsequent PUTs to the\n&gt; &gt; same resource return 200 (OK) responses.  This is very \n&gt; common practice and I\n&gt; &gt; have never heard a single person say this is not idempotent.\n&gt; \n&gt; I strongly feel your analysis is correct. I never saw the \n&gt; debate about \n&gt; two deletes as having anything to do with idempotence. It is merely a \n&gt; question of whether deleting a thing twice is an error or a normal \n&gt; action. In most file systems I&#39;m familiar with it is an error. That&#39;s \n&gt; because objects have identity in a file system and trying to delete a \n&gt; non-existent object is a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; In SQL, a DELETE that effects nothing is not a problem \n&gt; because &quot;rows&quot; do \n&gt; not have identity (except in a particular application domain \n&gt; where you \n&gt; choose some column or set of columsn to use as the identifier).\n&gt; \n&gt; But this has nothing to do with idempotency.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n\nI see the link to idempotence.  Because of its definition, idempotent\noperations identify their end states (Proof, Miles?)  In end-state\n&quot;speak&quot;, SQL DELETE is idempotent because it is silent about mechanism,\nwhile filesystem delete is &quot;idempotent&quot; because it is silent about\nend-state, gabby about mechanism.\n\nIs &#39;declarative&#39; the word I really want?  Even so, I believe you\ncan construct the connection between &#39;declarative&#39; and &#39;idempotent&#39;\nif you want to.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
