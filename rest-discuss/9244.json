I&#39;m using \nfrevvo&#39;s Live Forms product which &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.fr=\r\nevvo.com/blog/?p=3D26&quot;&gt;uses \nREST to interact with back end resources&lt;/a&gt;.\n=\r\n\nInstead of a one-off, I decided to try and do something generic since I th=\r\nink we&#39;re going to \nneed this often and it&#39;s got to be a reasonably common =\r\nproblem. So, I created a database \nconnector which is described briefly in =\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.frevvo.com/blog/?p=3D37&quot;this \nblog article&lt;/a&gt; and in=\r\n more details in the links therein. The connector source code is \nfreely av=\r\nailable to anyone who wants to use REST with databases and is based upon \nR=\r\nestlet. As of now, it&#39;s definitely beta-level code. \n\nIn a nutshell, you in=\r\nstall it and configure some queries (in an XML configuration file). The \nco=\r\nnnector will automatically create REST URIs for the specified queries. I fo=\r\nund that this \nworks well for my application (a small part of which is incl=\r\nuded in the download).\n\nSee &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.frevvo.com/blog/?p=3D37&quot;t=\r\nhe relevant blog article&lt;/a&gt; for \ndetails, download links, the frevvo appli=\r\ncation etc.\n\nComments welcome!\n\nThx,\n-Ashish\n\n-----\nAshish Deshpande\nFounde=\r\nr, frevvo LLC.; http://www.frevvo.com\nfrevvo Blog: http://www.frevvo.com/bl=\r\nog\n\n\n"}}
