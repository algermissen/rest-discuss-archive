No matter how generic your media types =\r\nis, you always end up putting in your code the knowledge about the domain.\n=\r\n\nWhat REST changes is who *owns* the contact. In RPC systems, the contract =\r\nis owned entirely by the server, allowing it to change the contract at will=\r\n as long as it considers the effect on existing clients.\n\nREST moves the co=\r\nntract away from the server to a &#39;global ownership&#39; (e.g. IANA)[1] effectiv=\r\nely leading two two things:\n\n1. The server cannot change the contract at wi=\r\nll; not without engaging into a\n   form of global communication about the c=\r\nhange. Therefore server owners cannot\n   (by nature of the system) break cl=\r\nients - the contract cannot change all of\n   a sudden.\n\n2. In order for ser=\r\nvers to evolve without changing the global contract every time\n   the contr=\r\nact (i.e. media types) must allow for a certain amount of change.\n   This &#39;=\r\nallowing for a certain amount of change&#39; leads to greater client-side\n   de=\r\nvelopment efforts - clients must be programmed to cope with the possible\n  =\r\n changes enabled by the media types the clients implements.\n\n[1] &#39;Global&#39; n=\r\need not be world-wide. It can very well just mean &#39;global to your\n    enter=\r\nprise&#39; (for integration scenarios) - what matters is that no individual \n  =\r\n  servers own the contract but that in independent (for any definition of i=\r\nndependent)\n    party is responsible.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As Paul states it &quot;The web is n=\r\not recompiled every morning - yet it works!&quot;. \n&gt; Sure! But we do not recomp=\r\nile it because humans are so good at adopting to \n&gt; whatever they see on a =\r\nscreen. But for a M2M system to work it surely must \n&gt; be recompiled in ord=\r\ner to understand new or changed semantics of the domain \n&gt; it works with.\n\n=\r\nNo, this is not true thanks to content negotiation and well designed\nextens=\r\nion rules for payload formats.\n\nThe cases where a server needs to switch fr=\r\nom application/procurement-v1 to\napplication/procurement-v2 instantly, with=\r\nout a transition period of supporting\nthose application/procurement-v1 enab=\r\nled clients is extremely rare. (Feel free to\nconstruct an example).\n\nThe co=\r\nol thing about REST is that any form of evolution can take place without\nco=\r\nordinating the change between clients, servers and intermediaries. It can e=\r\nven\nhappen without terminating *current* business transactions between clie=\r\nnts and\nservers. E.g. I can buy a book at Amazon at the same time they chan=\r\nge their\nsystem - or when was the last time you had to stop a purchase beca=\r\nuse of an\nongoing update?\n\nThis is so natural to use Web users and I contin=\r\nue to find it astonishing that\nbusiness systems owners are not jumping like=\r\n mad on that feature regarding their\ninternal IT systems.\n\nSome start to ge=\r\nt it, often in combination with agility goals but the majority is\nstill lig=\r\nhtyears &#39;behind&#39;.\n\n\n&gt; Yes, it can be built such that new features are ignor=\r\ned by \n&gt; old clients and that is certainly worth striving for - but new cli=\r\nents are \n&gt; needed for new semantics.\n\nYes, sure. But that is a property of=\r\n networked systems regardless of architectural\nstyle.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
