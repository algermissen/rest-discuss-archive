That should be\ndone via a nudge from the application itself via a hypermedia engine.\nThe &#39;serendipity&#39; should come by first a GET on the resource and then\nbased on the representation returned do something.\n\nBut what I /AM/ saying is that those 4 methods only should be used ,\nand not the other methods. How would using PATCH still be a part of\nuniform interface ?\n\n\n&gt; application).  As long as you are using GET for retrieval, then reuse\n&gt; will be there.\nThats what I meant by &#39;you introspect with a GET&#39; , and then decide what to do.\n\n&gt; PUT, DELETE, and PATCH are essentially editing operations on the\n&gt; mapping from URI to representation.  In many cases, those will translate\n\nYou mean , POST is used for invoking some functionality of the actual\nunderlying application , while PUT/DELETE are for manipulating the\ninterface model ? (and if the M=V then that would also imply changing\nsomething in the application )\n\nReading your first post again, I think I am still not clear on the last line :\n\n&gt;it is RESTful if there is some engine described\n&gt;by a representation provided by the origin server that instructs\n&gt;the client on what to do next.\n\nDo you mean that the representation returned from the origin server\nhas a set of (hypermedia) links\nthat allow it move about in the application?\n\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n\n[1] http://steve.vinoski.net/pdf/IEEE-Serendipitous_Reuse.pdf\n\n"}}
