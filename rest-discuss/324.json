If we set about building real applications with\nSMTP we would soon have a thread &quot;why is SMTP hard to design with?&quot;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; No.  I just don&#39;t see why you are reinventing the\n&gt; wheel.\n\nThe wheel is square.\n\n&gt; &gt; I think security and accountability are brutally hard and I think that\n&gt; &gt; reifying objects as addressable entities makes them much more managable.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thirty years of Unix and even Windows NT supports my position. How do I\n&gt; &gt; make it possible for a user to print or not to print? I treat the\n&gt; &gt; printer (or print queue) as a resource and give them permissions to it.\n&gt; &gt; How do I cancel jobs? I reify them as objects and then delete them. How\n&gt; &gt; do I know who did what? I look at the logs for those addressable\n&gt; &gt; objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok.  So I think SMTP is like the network transport\n&gt; layer.  Windows is perfectly happy to use TCP/IP\n&gt; rather than NetBIOS as its transport.  These\n&gt; issues are orthogonal to the procedures for\n&gt; accessing server logs.\n\nIf \n\n a) my fundamental concepts are addresses and addressable objects (my\npoint above)\n\n b) I already have about five or six layers of &quot;transport&quot; (a simple\nfact)\n\n c) I can easily glue together an address-centric system that does\nasynch notifications and routing (you admitted that doing this isn&#39;t\nhard)\n\nthen what benefit am I getting out of SMTP? It seems like there are a\nlot of people out there who have an emotional attachment to it just\nbecause it is out there. A few hundred lines of code gets me HTTP\ncallbacks. A few hundred more get me HTTP event relaying. A few hundred\nmore get me guaranteed message delivery. Once I&#39;ve built these I can use\nthem for every HTTP service in the world...even HTML apps.\n\nWhat does SMTP bring to the table other than a warm fuzzy feeling?\nBackwards compatibility? I can have that through a simple gateway.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
