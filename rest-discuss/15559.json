It so=\r\nunds like you&#39;ve modeled your data as\n&gt; &gt; tabular, in which case HTML&#39;s &lt;ta=\r\nble&gt; markup has all the machine-\n&gt; &gt; readable goodness you require.\n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n&#39;s not that we&#39;re modeling our data as a table - it is a table.\n&gt; We&#39;ve bee=\r\nn asked to provide users the ability to define and create\n&gt; tables with arb=\r\nitrary numbers of columns (this presents some\n&gt; interesting but solvable da=\r\ntabase issues).\n\n&quot;Tables with arbitrary numbers of columns&quot; =3D &quot;spreadshee=\r\nt&quot;\n\n&gt; Over time, they will need\n&gt; to update the values in various cells in =\r\nthese tables.  When they do\n&gt; their updates, they are going to want to make=\r\n all of their changes and\n&gt; then click save; they will not stand for having=\r\n to press save after\n&gt; editing each cell or row in the table - hence the ba=\r\ntch update.\n\n&quot;Not having to hit save&quot; =3D AJAX\n\n&quot;AJAX + spreadsheet&quot; =3D\nht=\r\ntp://www.socialtext.com/products/spreadsheets.php\n\n&gt; I dont think there&#39;s m=\r\nuch question the batch update is needed.  If a\n&gt; user wants to update a sta=\r\ntus column in every row in a 50 row table,\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure sending 50 PUT re=\r\nquests when they click the save button\n&gt; is appropriate.\n\nIf you distribute=\r\n the 50 PUT requests out as they type, it&#39;s very\nappropriate. Seems to be w=\r\norking for SocialCalc (the successor to\nwikiCalc, created by Dan Bricklin, =\r\nthe inventor of VisiCalc).\n\n&gt; But that&#39;s really a separate issue, and it&#39;s =\r\nnot the one I&#39;m worried\n&gt; about.  The harder part is the result of dealing =\r\nwith user-defined\n&gt; tables with arbitrary numbers of columns.  I dont want =\r\nto get down in\n&gt; the weeds, but basically, rows from the user-defined table=\r\ns do not map\n&gt; directly to records in the database.  Instead, each field in=\r\n a row is\n&gt; stored as a separate record in the database.  A table with 10 c=\r\nolumns\n&gt; and 50 rows is 500 records in the database.  If a user is only\n&gt; u=\r\npdating values in a single column I&#39;d rather only do 50 updates, and\n&gt; not =\r\n500.\n\nGive each cell its own URL and you&#39;ll have 50 updates, not 500.\n\n&gt; I =\r\ncould change my logical model to let clients deal with tables at the\n&gt; cell=\r\n level, but that seems to me to be making clients deal with an\n&gt; unnecessar=\r\nily complex model (though having the client mark which\n&gt; fields in a row ha=\r\nve been changed is probably not much different).  I\n&gt; would much rather sti=\r\nck with a logical model where clients can deal\n&gt; with the table at the row =\r\nlevel and not burden them with complexity\n&gt; that&#39;s really a result of the b=\r\nack-end implementation.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; At this point, the primary resource is the =\r\nuser-defined table.  It is\n&gt; possible that other services may want to acces=\r\ns individual rows, but\n&gt; more likely, they&#39;ll want to be able to retrieve o=\r\nne or two columns\n&gt; for all of the rows in the table.  And even if they do =\r\nwant a single\n&gt; row, it&#39;ll likely be addressed as a query of the table reso=\r\nurce, and\n&gt; not directly.  So most get requests will be for the table (or s=\r\nome\n&gt; portion of it) and not individual rows.\n\nIf clients are retrieving ar=\r\nbitrary subsets of the table based on both\nrows and columns, it seems odd, =\r\nthen, to standardize on row-based\nrepresentations.\n\n&gt; My main concern at th=\r\nis point is to come up with a document type that\n&gt; can be used for all inte=\r\nractions with these user-defined tables.  I\n&gt; would prefer that clients not=\r\n have to use a separate document type to\n&gt; do updates.\n\nI think that docume=\r\nnt type is the cell. It fits the requirements, is\nRESTful, and has prior ar=\r\nt now in the field. Or you could go buy\nSocialText off the shelf. Or hand G=\r\noogle Docs to your client. Or any of\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_o=\r\nnline_spreadsheets\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanchu@...\n\n"}}
