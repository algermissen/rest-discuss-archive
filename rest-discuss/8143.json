An RDF app can still consume an atom\n&gt; document. It just costs more to do so than consuming an atom+rdf\n&gt; +something document. It really depends on the balance of applications\n&gt; using RDF internally and those that don&#39;t as to which approach will\n&gt; carry the most value in the long term: Standard document types built\n&gt; around the requirements of information in those document types, or\n&gt; standard RDF vocabularies? I think the balance falls one way.\n\nSure.  It&#39;s unclear that RDF/XML should be the media type of choice for\nall representation exchange.   \n\nAs I think you&#39;re suggesting, the major problem is that it abstracts\nthe processing model of the representation (i.e. do I really need to\nreify a graph to figure out which URLs are dereferencable & by what\nmethod?  Can&#39;t I just have &lt;myelement uri=&quot;place/stuff/here&quot;\nmethod=&quot;PUT/&quot;&gt; ? )\n\nHaving said that, it probably should be the media type of choice for\ninteroperable data analysis and/or inference, if only because there\nisn&#39;t much else out there (and would it be better?)\n\nPlus,  [my favorite media type] + GRDDL seems to be the latest\ndirection of the Semantic Web, instead of &quot;RDF/XML uber alles&quot;.\n\n&gt; I see the atom experience being repeated as the way we will achieve\n&gt; semantic nirvana: One small step at a time, based on as simple an XML\n&gt; structure as the underyling data model for a particular problem-space\n&gt; will allow.\n\nThis I&#39;m not sure of.  The problem is that the experiences with REST\nhypermedia processing models like HTML, Atom, RSS, et al, are about\nspecifying on the semantics of &quot;containers&quot;.   Which , while difficult\nat internet scale, is something we&#39;re fairly experienced at, because\nit&#39;s generally independent of one&#39;s value system or doesn&#39;t really draw\nout divisive economic interests.\n\nWhen we get into cross-domain interoperability -- when data elements\nhave actual *value* to mean a different thing based on one&#39;s\nperspective / lifestyle / economic system / position / etc, we probably\nneed to raise the level of agreement from one of syntax to first or\nsecond order logic.  \n\nThat&#39;s where I think there&#39;s reason to believe that we can achieve this\n&quot;one small step at a time&quot; also with GRDDL, RDF, OWL, etc\n\n\n\n\n&gt; What I do see in RDF is a foundation for the next generation of\n&gt; RDBMS. I\n&gt; do see in RDF a possible foundation for reasoning-based languages. I\n&gt; think both functions are useful within a particular service boundary\n&gt; or\n&gt; behind a particular firewall. I don&#39;t think these functions are\n&gt; important to integrate into the main message-exchanging uniform Web.\n\n As I said above,  I think they&#39;ll be crucial if we want the web to\ntackle cross-domain interoperability.\n\nRemember, the RDBMS did succeed at cross-domain interop, if you aligned\nthe politics & got the funding -- the infamous data warehouse still\nfuels most of our business intelligence.\n\nThe real key with the semantic web will be to take those lessons and\napply them to &quot;external information&quot;, which is typically more valuable\nthen &quot;internal information&quot; anyway..\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nIt&#39;s here!
