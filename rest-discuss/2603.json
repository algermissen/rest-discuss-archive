So I shouldn&#39;t construct a URI using query parameters, unless\n&gt; the data is large and then the workaround is to construct a URI using query\n&gt; parameters. Got it.\n\nThat&#39;s basically my position although someday it might be worth drilling \ndown more into what it means for the data to be large. Arbitrarily large \ndata sets can be broken down into bite-sized fractions but then you get \ninto latency issues (like trying to navigate YahooGroups, 10 messages \nper page). Plus you can get into situations where the server can answer \na question in O(X) time but the client can only answer in O(Y) where Y \nis greater than X. For instance asking Google to find the intersection \n&quot;Mike&quot; and &quot;Dierken&quot; is going to be much faster than doing it on the \nclient even if bandwidth and latency were free because Google&#39;s indexes \nare set up that way.\n\nStill, given infinte development resources, I think that people out \nthere could make good use of a Google service that listed all words that \nco-occur with some particular word. Linguists would love it!\n\nAlso, as a purely theoretical, rather than practical point, I will \nmention that it is possible to design a hypertext interface even to a \nnano-second indexed data set. At the top level you could list all \nmilleniums that data is available for. At the level below you could list \nall centuries. At the level below you could list all decades. And on \ndown to nanoseconds. Ideally you would filter out &quot;uninteresting&quot; time \nperiods where nothing happened. The latency on such a data \nrepresentation would probably be killer, however.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
