I had been researching\nthe same thing and I&#39;m 95% finished with my article... I guess you can&#39;t\nalways be the first. When I read the title, I thought I can as well leave\nit, as o&#39;reilly articles are usually well-written (as is yours), but as I\nchose PHP as server language and also make use of a proxy, I think it&#39;s\nstill worth finishing it off, one day when I find the time.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve got another (more interesting) one in the works about RESTfully \n&gt; using cookies for authentication. It too will be published on &quot;onlamp&quot;\n&gt; as soon as.\nGo for it, I can&#39;t wait.\n\nCheers,\nMatthias\n\n\n\n"}}
