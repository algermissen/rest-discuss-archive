There are two possible extremes for REST:\n&gt; \n&gt; =95 =\r\nOne Media Type To Rule Them All (=E0 la SOAP) =95 Every service \n&gt; comes up=\r\n with its own media type\n&gt; \n&gt; Neither of these is healthy. The latter, in p=\r\narticular, gains \n&gt; you little over RPC in terms of decoupling, although yo=\r\nu get \n&gt; some of the other benefits of REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; We need a middle ground: =\r\na small variety of somewhat generic \n&gt; media types that can be used for a w=\r\nide variety of things.\n&gt; Individual services can then use one of them, and =\r\nclients can \n&gt; then be implemented as glue on top of a library.\n\nI agree wi=\r\nth that complete.  \n\nWe could call this &quot;Webful API&quot; (to sidestep Roy&#39;s pas=\r\nt concern about using\nthe &quot;REST&quot; name.)  Webful APIs could be defined by ei=\r\nther new content types\nor a subset of existing content types, and each one =\r\nwould be defined by a\nstring of information, vetted by working groups, and =\r\nrecorded at IANA.  For\nexample, assume we defined a Webful API for interact=\r\ning with Events of the\ntype that Eventful, UpComing, and Meetup allow you t=\r\no schedule (btw, I need\nthis.)  It&#39;s identification string could be:\n\n\t&quot;web=\r\nful-api/events&quot;\n\nOr \n\n\t&quot;application/webful-api+xml/events&quot;\n\n\n&gt; That=92s wha=\r\nt I think is great about the AtomPP: it provides a \n&gt; base for a large arra=\r\ny of services by defining a few base \n&gt; media types and a number of HTTP tr=\r\nansactions complete with \n&gt; meanings, granular enough to be useful without =\r\ncustomisation, \n&gt; but with clear extension hooks throughout.\n\nTo me this is=\r\n too close to &quot;the one Media Type to rule them all&quot; (what would\nwe do w/o T=\r\nolkien?!?).  AtomPP seems to me to be more of a well-defined\nconduit for im=\r\nplementing services than anything that would help identify\nspecific service=\r\ns, but I haven&#39;t been following it closely enough to know\nfor sure.\n\nSo at =\r\nthe risk of having an opinion based on ignorance, I&#39;d say that AtomPP\nwould=\r\n be a great base but we still need to be able to define Webful APIs for\nspe=\r\ncific services, i.e.\n\n\t&quot;application/atomserv+xml/events&quot;\n\n&quot;Event&quot;s here wou=\r\nld still be vetted by a working group somewhere and still\nneed to be regist=\r\nered with IANA.\n\nHow does that sit with you?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www=\r\n.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web=\r\n.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n"}}
