Why does an intermediate &#39;config file&#39; have\nto be generated?\n\nI have imagined doing this with a DHCP server and nagios or similar.\nIt would be nice if all networking hardware and software was exposed\nas resources over HTTP with RDF representations.\n\n[snip]\n&gt; Hmm...maybe that  is the principle already: greater reusability or  \n&gt; being able to\n&gt; plug in filters between the GET and the POST in case there is a  \n&gt; semantic change in\n&gt; the RDF graph I GET.\n\n&#39;Semantic change&#39;?\n\nBy the principle of &#39;partial understanding&#39;, if predicates you don&#39;t\nunderstand are used in the RDF, its OK to ignore them.\n\n"}}
