It&#39;s perhaps only partially relevant to what you ask here\nthough.\n\n&gt; In real life, I have a http://universalcard.com\n&gt; credit card.  When I log in (via a web form), I\n&gt; arrive at the homepage for my account:\n&gt; \n&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary\n&gt; \n&gt; This page has my current balance, available\n&gt; credit, last payment made, and last payment date,\n&gt; among other information.  There is also a link on\n&gt; that page to:\n&gt; \n&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary?PRINT_VERSION=Y\n&gt; \n&gt; I can also link to a printable version of my\n&gt; unbilled transactions:\n&gt; \n&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/UnbilledTrans?PRINT_VERSION=Y\n&gt; \n&gt; Both printable versions are simply current records\n&gt; of my account state without any links/buttons to\n&gt; make changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to be able to provide third parties\n&gt; (e.g. my accountant) with access to these pages,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t without providing them with control\n&gt; over my entire account.\n&gt; \n&gt; The questions are:\n&gt; 1. Is this system RESTful?\n\nGood question.  REST has an interface constraint called &quot;identification\nof resources&quot;, and there is clearly a resource in your example which is\nnot being identified (&quot;The summary of Alex&#39;s account&quot;).  Roy&#39;s\ndissertation is a bit vague with respect to what this constraint\nactually constrains, so it&#39;s hard for me to say with any certainty.\n\nBut my hunch is that it is still RESTful, but with an obvious bug that\nan important resource isn&#39;t identified.  It would be unRESTful if,\nfor example, cookies were used to define the context for interpretation\nof that indirect reference (whether that was authentication info, or\nanything else).\n\n&gt; 2. Would it be RESTful if it used HTTP-auth rather than cookie auth?\n\nIf it used cookie auth, it wouldn&#39;t be RESTful.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
