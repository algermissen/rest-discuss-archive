I think if you figure that out,\n&gt;you&#39;ll be well on your way to some rest from this subject, no pun\n&gt;intended.\n&gt;\n\nWhen implementing content negotiation, each alternate representation is also \nits own resource with its own URI, this URI is returned in Content-Location. \nI don&#39;t know how this is done without using multiple resources.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Walden\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
