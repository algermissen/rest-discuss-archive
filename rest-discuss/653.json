It&#39;s true, but\n&gt; &gt; not too useful.  RPC is a lower layer than HTTP because it defines no\n&gt; &gt; application semantics, leaving them for the &quot;API&quot; to define.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m scared of the term &quot;application&quot; because we also build applications\n&gt; on top of HTTP.\n\nTechnically, we don&#39;t.  I know the common use of the term is just that,\nbut in actuality, we are simply adding more resources to an existing\napp, the Web.\n\n&gt; Plus, RPC has its own set of semantics involving\n&gt; parameters, return codes, methods, etc. The word semantics is also a\n&gt; mine-field. I&#39;m one of a vocal few people who claim that XML has\n&gt; semantics (angle-brackets are syntax, attributed-trees are semantics). \n\nSure, and I agree with you about XML having semantics (Jon Bosak has\nsaid as much).  But &quot;application semantics&quot; has a much more precise\nmeaning, though not commonly known.\n\n&gt; &gt; Linda, like HTTP and FTP and NNTP, defines the methods.  So you&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; got an application layer contract - a coordination language -\n&gt; &gt; between endpoints a priori.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is SMTP a coordination language?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Do we have a definition that can be\n&gt; made precise?\n\nI&#39;m sure we could whip one together without much trouble.  As I say on\nthe Wiki, I believe that all application protocols are coordination\nlanguages.\n\n&gt; We disagree on the meaning of POST. What a surprise. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; If we are strict about the idea that URIs are opaque then the client\n&gt; doing the PUT can&#39;t really know what URI to use to create a new\n&gt; resource. POST can be used to provide a new URI.\n\nRight, that&#39;s the point.\n\nThe whole idea with PUT is that the client specifies the name, likely\nbecause it had previously done a GET and so knows what the name already\nis.  But any container can choose to reject a PUT with a name it doesn&#39;t\nlike, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s still opaque (it determines the meaning of\nthe name).  I suppose that somewhere in there is a PUT based form\nsolution where the form suggests a URI.\n\nPOST means &quot;accept as a subordinate&quot;, which means that the client is\nspecifically punting all responsibility for the document to the\ncontainer, including naming it, as you say.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FTP is the closest protocol to HTTP conceptually. But really the gap\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think NNTP is probably closest.  It has POST (that&#39;s where HTTP&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; POST came from), a basic get (ARTICLE), and a very specific type of\n&gt; &gt; put (for setting read messages).\n&gt; \n&gt; FTP has a more general GET (i.e. it has a concept of hierarchy and\n&gt; filenames) and PUT.\n\nNews groups and articles are hierarchically named too.  Each group is a\ncontainer that contains multiple articles, articles can be posted to\nmultiple groups, etc.. (it goes beyond HTTP here, and gets into\nKnowNow-land with message ids and topics).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
