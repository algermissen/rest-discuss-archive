IOW, to=\r\n evolve the\nsystem to match changes in the problem domain, you modify the\nr=\r\nepresentations and the hypermedia within those representations.\n\nso, with t=\r\nhat as a basis...\n\nthere are two different cases to consider:\nHuman-driven =\r\nuser-agents (or Human-to-Machine - H2M) and,\nMachine-driven user-agents (or=\r\n Machine-to-Machine - M2M).\n\nH2M evolvability for hypermedia\nin this case t=\r\nhe &quot;human&quot; driving the user agent (UA) has &quot;knowledge in the\nhead&quot; that the=\r\n user agent does not have. the UA can focus just on\nrecognizing, parsing, a=\r\nnd rendering the media type representations and\nallowing the human to inter=\r\npret the results and make choices based on the\nhuman&#39;s knowledge of the pro=\r\nblem domain and the hypermedia affordances\n(links and forms) presented.\n\nsi=\r\nnce the act of mapping intention (what i want to get done) to action (the\nl=\r\ninks and forms available) is all handled by a human, servers are free to\nma=\r\nke quite a wide range of changes and the system will still function well.\n\n=\r\n\nfor example, in H2M cases, the server is free to add/remove inputs element=\r\ns\nin forms, add/remove links, change the &quot;order&quot; in which links/forms are\np=\r\nresented, even introduce entirely new forms and inputs.
