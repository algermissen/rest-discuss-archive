Like\nCORBA before it, SOAP is designed to extend the Object-Oriented model\nout onto the network. O-O thinking is bound up in application-specific\nbaseclasses and function semantics. REST would require all such\nsemantics to be removed, and only semantics everyone understood to be\nused.\n\nThe definition of REST I use[1] requires that both standard methods\n(like SOAP function calls) and standard media types (like the parameters\na SOAP function may support) be used. The Object-oriented model doesn&#39;t\nreally fit this mould. You could effectively model this view of REST as\nan O-O baseclass with polymorphic versions of each function for each\nexisting media type. HTTP handles this model better by separating the\ndefinition of the function call protocol (HTTP itself) from the function\ncall parameter format (the media type). It is probably worth pointing\nout that my definition does not permit arbitrary XML to be used in REST,\neither... at least not unless the server has supplied a form or other\ninformation describing how to build the XML to be submitted. The\nboundary for me between REST and non-REST is about whether you have to\nwrite an industry- or application- specific client application or\nbrowser extension. If you do, you aren&#39;t doing REST. REST is built\naround universal concepts only.\n\nAs for using a SOAP document as the media type in a HTTP interaction,\nthe main thing to worry about is whether your are trying to tunnel\nanother architecture through the REST architecture. If the SOAP document\nitself has methods that are not standard then in my opinion you are not\ndoing REST. The document would have to be something that could be\nunderstood by a range of clients from different industries outside the\ncontext of the HTTP request to rank as a standard media type in my\nbooks. That means it would have to &quot;be&quot; something that represents a\nfairly universal concept, like &quot;image/*&quot; or &quot;text/*&quot;. The question to\nask is &quot;could I fit it into the current MIME system without prefixing it\nwith application/&quot;?\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n[1] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BenjaminCarlyle\n\n\n"}}
