I would like to comment that I think \n&gt; there needs to be a slighly more complex example, such as one \n&gt; incorporating HTTP Authentication and more details on how /username/ vs \n&gt; /username/orders/ would be handled.\n &gt;\n &gt; Jerome Louvel wrote:\n &gt;&gt; Hi all,\n &gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; I would like to announce a new open source project called Restlet.\n &gt;&gt; Its mission is to bring the simplicity and efficiency of the REST\n &gt;&gt; architectural style to Java developers.\n\nI started playing with Restlet after seeing Mark Baker&#39;s blog post about \nit a few days back.[1]\n\nI&#39;ll second both the compliment and the request for more examples and/or \ndocumentation. I tried to extend the tutorial code to do something like \nwhat Christian describes, but I didn&#39;t have too much luck even after \nplaying with Restlets and Maplets for an hour or so. I plan to try some \nmore soon.\n\nAlso, I get an empty document rather than a 404 when I try to access a \nURI with no restlet to handle it. Is that a feature or a bug :-)? If \nit&#39;s a feature, is there a way to override it?\n\nJim\n\n[1] - \nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/12/16#deliciousdistobj.Noelios___Restl...eased\n\n"}}
