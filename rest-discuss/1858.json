Is there a reference somewhere that maps GET/POST/PUT/DELETE\ninto\n&gt; &gt; all or most of the other URI (although I suspect just URL) schemes?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is my interpretation of the claims that have been made: the REST\n&gt; model is appropriate to solving all of the same problems that other\n&gt; Internet application protocols solve. In other words email (for example)\n&gt; could benefit from REST discipline and could use HTTP across the wire.\n&gt; If that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking about then here&#39;s one preliminary mapping\n&gt; I&#39;ve done for email:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/\n&gt;\n&gt; I would not say that &quot;REST applies to all Web protocols.&quot; For one thing,\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a clear definition of &quot;Web protocol.&quot; Arguably HTTP is the\n&gt; only widely deployed protocol that knows about &quot;the Web&quot; and has been\n&gt; adopted by the W3C as a core technology. (One could argue that SOAP fits\n&gt; too and it would probably be simpler to agree to disagree rather than\n&gt; attempt to establish a test of Web-ness)\n&gt;\n&gt; I certainly do not think of SMTP as either guided by REST or based upon\n&gt; the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;For example, the Web&#39;s primary transfer protocol is HTTP, but the\n&gt; architecture also includes seamless access to resources that originate\n&gt; on pre-existing network servers, including FTP [107], Gopher [7], and\n&gt; WAIS [36]. Interaction with those services is restricted to the\n&gt; semantics of a REST connector. This constraint sacrifices some of the\n&gt; advantages of other architectures, such as the stateful interaction of a\n&gt; relevance feedback protocol like WAIS, in order to retain the advantages\n&gt; of a single, generic interface for connector semantics.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If an application needs the additional capabilities of another\n&gt; architecture, it can implement and invoke those capabilities as a\n&gt; separate system running in parallel, similar to how the Web architecture\n&gt; interfaces with &quot;telnet&quot; and &quot;mailto&quot; resources.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  *\n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm\n&gt; --\n&gt; Come discuss XML and REST web services at:\n&gt;   Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n&gt;   Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
