With a PUT you\nmust replace the entire state of the resource,\neven those bits you should not be changing.\nConsequently, the processing on the server must\ndetermine what has changed and then apply business\nrules to those properties that have changed.\n\nWith a POST you can ask for specific properties\nto be modified.\n\n&gt; I can&#39;t see how in your example the server would\n&gt; have any more problems constraining a client\n&gt; PUTting a new customer order over one POSTing\n&gt; one, after all the only difference is the word\n&gt; PUT rather than POST in the HTTP request, the\n&gt; same server logic can apply to both.\n\nThe client should POST a new customer order,\nunless you want your external clients determining\nthe names of your resources. After that, the\nclient could PUT replacements of that order\nor POST ammendments to the order.\n\nI contend that the latter is easier to\nimplement and manage. Then again, maybe I&#39;m\njust lazy.     B^)\n\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
