An important part of the batch-GET operation is the\n&gt; ability to optimize away the overhead of the singleton retreivals ...\n&gt; pipelining multiple GETs just isn&#39;t the same as GETting multiple thing\n&gt; at once.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, it seems like some HTTPng might have a b[atch]GET\n&gt; operation.  It may even be constrained to take URIs that are\n&gt; self-consistent in some way, though I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s\n&gt; super-important...\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, does anyone feel my pain?\n&gt; How have you worked around it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Where eles does HTTP bind too tightly?\n&gt;\n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://www.asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo\n${a}@${b}`\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
