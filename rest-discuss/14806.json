However, the lack of client side libraries that embrace this is imped=\r\ning me for the moment. The way I see it, all clients must be only be made k=\r\nnown of one URI, say &quot;/&quot;. The client then derives the URIs from that link. =\r\nAs such, I was hoping to do something roughly like:\n\nfrom(&quot;/&quot;).follow(&quot;#use=\r\nrs_link&quot;).fill_form(&quot;search_user&quot;, {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;someid&quot;}).follow(&quot;#user_link&quot;).f=\r\nollow(&quot;#friends_link&quot;)\n\nThe goal of the previous command was to get the fri=\r\nends of some user having an ID of &#39;someid&#39;. It starts by going to the given=\r\n URL, then from the page it got, follows a certain link which redirect it t=\r\no the resource for a list of users. It then searches for the user, probably=\r\n filling up a form, submits it, and goes to the user&#39;s page. From the user&#39;=\r\ns page, there is a link to the friends page, and that is followed and event=\r\nually processed.\n\nIn reality of course, this shouldn&#39;t really necessitate m=\r\nultiple calls to the server if called multiple times since previous results=\r\n have been cached and processed on the client side. Only when the cache exp=\r\nires, should there be an attempt to request again. I&#39;m not really sure if R=\r\nESTful clients that respect HATEOAS do it this way, and should they in the =\r\nfirst place. If they do, are there tools that exist for this?\n\nOn a side no=\r\nte, content type negotiation should be preconfigured before doing the call =\r\nI stated above.\n\nThanks,\n\nJan Vincent Liwanag\njvliwanag@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
