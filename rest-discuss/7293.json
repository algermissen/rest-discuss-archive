It&#39;s just\n&gt; stupid. There are methods embedded in the URIs. Everything is done\n&gt; with GET.\n\n\nHeheh. Nope. It pretty much violates every principle of goodness.\nHere&#39;s a good one. Build an URL such that when you GET it, it will\nremove a video from your favorites list...\nhttp://developer.searchvideo.com/method.php?name=truveo.users.removeFavorite\n\nSurprise!\n\n&gt; We were just talking about how stupid that was.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I looked at the other APIs. Most of them incomplete, too locked down\n&gt; or just not very useful.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This has prompted a delicate exchange between me and the publishing\n&gt; house (clearly they will take money from anyone to do anything) as I\n&gt; try to justify writing an article for them that calls their clients&#39;\n&gt; stuff rubbish.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But it also prompts me to think:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Who the **** is getting paid to come up with this stuff for AOL? Why\n&gt;   didn&#39;t they hire someone with a brain to do this?\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone knows a senior AOL manager please tell them I&#39;m available. I\n&gt; don&#39;t have a brain but at least I can always borrow someone else&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nMaybe the publisher has a direct line to the AOL people.\n\n&gt; The last thing it makes me think is:\n&gt;\n&gt;   I wish Roy could protect the word REST in some way to stop companies\n&gt;   like this just being evil with it.\n&gt;\n\nI understand the sentiment, but I&#39;m glad I have the freedom use the\nterm REST a little loosely.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
