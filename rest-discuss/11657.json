And the purchase order protocol will not\nwork for deliveries or returns or (heaven help us) mortages.\n\nAnd even the purchase order protocol will have several variations,\ndepending on whether the purchaser wants a quote first, who pays for\ntransportation, and several other piddly business details.\n\nSo the buyer and seller might be able to use different application\nsoftware (that was the OAGIS promise, seldom really fulfilled) but\nit&#39;s still just purchasing.\n\n"}}
