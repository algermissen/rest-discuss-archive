Amazon (apparently) has chosen not\nto document or share the semantics that it may be embedding in to its HTML\npages.\n\nHowever, if Amazon wishes to be a &quot;good citizen&quot; and allow people to\nleverage whatever IMPLIED semantics that can be mined from manual review of\ntheir representations, then it is in Amazons interest to maintain and\ncontinue using those semantics and format details for as long as practical,\nindirectly encouraging 3rd party clients to leverage their systems and rely\non their servers.\n\nMaybe Amazon simply doesn&#39;t care. Perhaps they have an alternate system that\nthey DO want to support (don&#39;t they have some more official store API of\nsome kind?). If they do, they have no motivation to maintain their formats\nfrom day to day or request to request. They have given no contract, so they\nstand by no contract and offer no promises. If they make a change and your\ncode breaks, not their problem.\n\nBest Buy, in contrast, perhaps decided that mixing their API within their\nhuman readable content using some evolving standards is a better use of\ntheir resources than maintaining a separate API.\n\nBut the bottom line is simply that the PAYLOAD is not enough to describe the\nAPI. Even in REST. Even in REST external, out of band documentation is\nrequired to get a client to properly communicate and interact with a server.\nThe payloads may offer links to such documentation, but that documentation\nis designed to Carbon Based Lifeforms to consume and interpret.\n\nHaving someone send a list of orders as HTML wrapped in Atom is a perfectly\nacceptable. Obviously if someone said &quot;Yea, it&#39;s in Atom&quot;, a consumer may be\noff put when that what they get. But clearly the conversation simply go far\nenough. But the key is that the payload is inevitably consistent in someway\nfor a machine to be able to process it consistently. That discussion is\nhandled off line between the parties, but not between the machines.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\r\n--002215b03c0a3896b2048d6e2fbc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nI&#39;m with Eric on this.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The debate over that text/htm=\r\nl CAN represent &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;anything&quot; versus havin=\r\ng it represent what the client expects is moot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\nI=\r\nn the end, servers don&#39;t work well with clients and clients don&#39;t w=\r\nork well without servers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;IF a server wants to PRO=\r\nMOTE interoperability, it is motivated to continue sending &quot;sane&quot;=\r\n, consistent results in order to better serve it&#39;s clients.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fact that Amazon is using the the class &quot;price&quot=\r\n; for some text that happens to have numbers, a decimal point, and a dollar=\r\n sign, and the fact that this class has specific formatting called out in t=\r\nhe CSS can be either by complete happenstance or it can be by design.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a uninformed observer, we don&#39;t know which it i=\r\ns, since the generated HTML is a artifact of a larger process.
