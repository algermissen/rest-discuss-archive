If so, then the \n&gt; server can remember whether that URI had been posted to before.\n\nThat&#39;s it. The reason to have the POE header is to let the client \ninterpret the 2xx and 405 responses. But what&#39;s really nice about this \nID is that it degrades gracefully - a POE unaware client can function \nwith a POE aware server and the exactly once semantics can still be \nobtained.\n\nIt&#39;s Mark&#39;s draft, but I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing a future rev incorporate \n410 to emulate ttl. That way the server can release resources in due course.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
