He has written\n&gt; a lot of very nice software (Basecamp, Rails).\n&gt;\n&gt; Instiki uses hrefs and GET to do state changing\n&gt; operations.  As an example, here is some text from\n&gt; http://www.instiki.org/show/HomePage:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; Search engines have traversed the site and have\n&gt; been �clicking� all the rollback links. So now\n&gt; the rollback link is done in javascript to keep\n&gt; those pesky engines at bay.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; When I read this I was wearing my RESTful hat so\n&gt; I immediately said &quot;he&#39;s using GET for the rollback\n&gt; operation; not very RESTful&quot;.  The javascript is a\n&gt; nice fix but ultimately doesn&#39;t address the underlying\n&gt; architectural issue.  So I thought that maybe we on\n&gt; rest-discuss could have a go.\n&gt;\n&gt; I reckon a href should not be used here at all.\n&gt; Let&#39;s say we have a &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; tag\n&gt; instead of a &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt; tag.\n&gt;\n&gt; That javascript routine called from onclick (or\n&gt; triggered by whatever UI gesture) could build a\n&gt; HTTP request and send it.  But that is just a\n&gt; Simple Matter of Code.  The real question is,\n&gt; what should this HTTP request look like?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s mine, to get the ball rolling:\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /somewikientry\n&gt;\n&gt; method=rollback\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
