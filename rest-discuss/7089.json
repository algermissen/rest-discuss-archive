I mean, maybe it makes sense  \nfor your application, but maybe it doesn&#39;t.  (Good) HTTP happens to  \nbe an implementation of REST principles, but you do not need them to  \nbe RESTful.\n\nI&#39;ll bet one could use Erlang or Termite as your base language and  \nend up being just as RESTful.  (In actual fact, the choice of  \nlanguage is probably not as important, but some languages would make  \nit easier to express RESTful principles then others)\n\nSame with XML. If your application needs to work with XML, great.  If  \nit doesn&#39;t, why make it?  There is very little inherently RESTful  \nabout XML.\n\nOn 21-Nov-06, at 9:10 AM, Mike Schinkel wrote:\n\n&gt; Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, developing a Windows app on top of a RESTful\n&gt;&gt;&gt; architecture makes eminent sense.
