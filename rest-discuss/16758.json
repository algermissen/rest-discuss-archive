RFC 2616 says:\n\n&quot;A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the variant\ncorresponding to the response entity; especially in the case where a\nresource has multiple entities associated with it, and those entities\nactually have separate locations by which they might be individually\naccessed, the server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the\nparticular variant which is returned.&quot;\n\nVariants are resources in their own right.  Frameworks shouldn&#39;t\npreclude the option of sending Content-Location with conneg responses,\nas this imposes an interpretation on the system being developed.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
