This requires a slight rethink of the model Sam has,\n&gt; whereby the URI represents a container that you&#39;re *supposed* to throw\n&gt; valid RSS at, and receive either:\n&gt; \n&gt; a 200 status with no message body if the RSS is valid\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; a non-200 status back (with the details in the message body) if it&#39;s not. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thing is, I can&#39;t figure out what the status code should be. I first\n&gt; looked at status code 415 (Unsupported Media Type) but I suspect that\n&gt; would mean that &#39;application/rss+xml&#39; was *generally* not supported at\n&gt; that URI, rather than just *invalid* &#39;application/rss+xml&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt; So - is trying to get away from the &#39;homogenisation&#39; of all results into\n&gt; a 200 status code an appropriate thing to do here (or anywhere)? \n\nSure, if that&#39;s what you want.  If you want the state of resulting\nvalidation to be a valid state of your application, you need to return\na 2xx.\n\nIMO, when in doubt, lean towards 2xx.  But that doesn&#39;t mean sending\nSOAP faults over 2xx, it means sending SOAP envelopes with state\ninformation useful to your application over 2xx.\n\nFWIW, I would fully expect a validation service to send back validation\nerrors over 2xx, since validation errors are the result of *successful*\nprocessing (i.e. it was able to determine that there were validation\nerrors).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
