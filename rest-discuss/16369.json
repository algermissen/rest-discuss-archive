One in the context of relevant RFCs (such as for\nMIME, which you note merely discourages use of unregistered types) where\nactual conformance criteria exist, and the other in the context of\nREST.  REST, as an architectural style, doesn&#39;t really have &quot;violations&quot;\n- there are approaches which look more like the style, and approaches\nthat look less so.  The word &quot;violation&quot; completely undercuts your\nargument, as REST (as described by Roy), as near as I can tell never\nembraces the notion that &quot;conformance&quot; exists.  Nor can it, so far as I\ncan tell, because as a style, it is at least two levels of abstraction\nremoved from actual design/implementation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the public Internet is (in REST) restricted to IANA-registered types.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nope.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, absolutely yes. REST has a constraint called &quot;self-descriptive\n&gt; messaging&quot; which can&#39;t be met if nobody can look up your media type\n&gt; identifier. REST is not based on opaque, anything-goes strings as\n&gt; media type identifiers. REST *is* based on self-descriptive messaging\n&gt; where anyone can figure out what your media type identifier means,\n&gt; because its presence in the IANA registry makes it transparent.\n&gt;\n\nI thought of mentioning this before, but with the onslaught of mobile\napplications, we have the perfect situation for those applications to\ndevelop new media types without first getting an IANA registration. \nSpecifications are frequently in development for *years* before the\nregistration might be finalized, so the notion that early versions of\nthose specifications cannot be used across the internet, to figure out\nhow well/poorly they actually work, is just silly.\n\nI agree transparency is good.  Your strawman seems to be that this must\nmean IANA registration, which is a separate question, and REST is\ncertainly not restricted to those.\n\nEric Johnson\n\n\r\n--------------030909050902000104040900\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;\n      http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body text=&quot;#000000&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;\n    This may be feeding a thread that doesn&#39;t need it, but....&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    On 08/23/2010 02:31 PM, Eric J.
