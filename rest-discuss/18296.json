It is the examples that are wrong. Media types should not describe\n&gt; objects like &quot;sales order&quot; or &quot;bill&quot;. They should be more general like\n&gt; &quot;e-procurement&quot;. The fact that its a sales order can be derived from the\n&gt; rel-type (as argued earlier on).\n&gt;\n&gt; So my previous little step-be-step list becomes:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) The client follows a link-rel &quot;this-is-the-sales-order&quot; and assumes it\n&gt; will get, well, a sales order - in some yet unknown format.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) The client does not need to specify &quot;I want a sales order&quot; in the accept\n&gt; header (it does so by the URL it has selected).\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) The client must specify its capabilities (or the context in which it will\n&gt; process the sales order). So it sends Accept: application/e-procurement+xml\n&gt; (not application/salesorder+xml).\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) The server replies with a sales order and content-type\n&gt; application/e-procurement+xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) The client knows that a sales order in the context of\n&gt; application/e-procurement+xml should be decoded in a certain way and does\n&gt; so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Repeat step 1-5 with &quot;sales order&quot; replaced with\n&gt; &quot;bill/quote/reservation/etc&quot; - but do not change the media type.\n&gt;\n&gt; Better now?\n\nWell, you can still go with more generic types, such as \napplication/rdf+xml, where &quot;shared understanding&quot; ((domain) knowledge) \nis described in linked ontology specifications. However, besides concept \ndefinitions, additional descriptions for specific actions are probably \nrequired, e.g., by extending existing property (relations) definitions \nwith this kind of information (e.g. as it can be realized with HAL or ALPS).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBo\n\n\n"}}
