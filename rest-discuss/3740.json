This is a key part of the &quot;self-describing&quot;\n&gt; umbrella.  As an example, if you were a party to the court action, then\n&gt; your identity (via your name) on some document is likely relevant.  But\n&gt; the colour of your hair probably wouldn&#39;t be (as an example of what\n&gt; might be returned from GET on my URI).\n&gt;\n&gt; In Paul&#39;s example there, if the state of the resource was important,\n&gt; even if it was believed static, it should have been included in the\n&gt; court documents by value rather than by reference.\n&gt;\n&gt; MB\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jul 03, 2003 at 06:17:46PM -0700, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paul,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I buy all that, and yet I still have an issue with Tyler&#39;s example\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the bank account URI that identifies anyone&#39;s account at that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bank, depending on who&#39;s fired up their user agent.  To me, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be dragging\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; any URI into court.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed\n&gt; &gt; messages_ into courts. Let&#39;s say you have a very precise (specific) and\n&gt; &gt;   URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation.\n&gt; &gt; Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed.\n&gt; &gt; The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it\n&gt; &gt; in the database. You&#39;ll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally\n&gt; &gt; signed message with the old value.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
