I understan=\r\nd that using a scalable clusterable\nJ2EE framework may &quot;solve&quot; this but I a=\r\nm looking for simpler\nalternatives.\n\nThere are 1 or more servers offering s=\r\nervices (ok, I should say\n&quot;resource&quot; from now on, but they are in fact batc=\r\nh services that\nproduce a resource). Resource types may be identical betwee=\r\nn each\nserver, or different. Resources may have limited access, that is, th=\r\ney\nmay accept only a few request at a time. When a server is busy on a\nreso=\r\nurce (it may return HTTP code 503), clients can try with another\nserver tha=\r\nt offers the same resource. When a resource type is not\navailable, it retur=\r\nns a 404. Example:\n\n Server1:\n  * ResourceTypeA\n  * ResourceTypeB\n\n Server2=\r\n:\n  * ResourceTypeA\n  * ResourceTypeC\n\nIf resourceTypeA is busy on server1,=\r\n clients can try on server2.\n\nWe need clients not to be aware of all differ=\r\nent servers out there. So\nwe need some kind of server registry, and a route=\r\nr that will queue all\nrequests from clients to those servers. Thus, JMS que=\r\nues seems like a\ngood fit:\n\n    server-1 server-2 \n       |        | \n  JMS=\r\n-Server-with-queues\n     |       |        |  \n   client1 client2 client3\n\nD=\r\noes anyone have a suggestion on how to achieve this with a RESTFul\narchitec=\r\nture, without a JMS server? I know we could write client code\nthat obtains =\r\nthe server list, and iterates through each but this can\ngrow into a little =\r\nbeast if we must parametize it with delays between\nattempts, number of retr=\r\nies and so on.\n\nClaude\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
