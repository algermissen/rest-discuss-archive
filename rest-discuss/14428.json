Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;\n&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t get to decide what POST means -- that is decided by the\n&gt;&gt; resource. Its purpose is supposed to be described in the same context\n&gt;&gt; in which you found the URI that you are posting to. Presumably, that\n&gt;&gt; context (a hypertext representation in some media type understood by\n&gt;&gt; your client) tells you or your agent what to expect from the POST  \n&gt;&gt; using\n&gt;&gt; some combination of standard elements/relations and human-readable\n&gt;&gt; text. The HTTP response will tell you what happened as a result...\n&gt;&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The confusion, specifically in regards to this statement and\n&gt; contrasting it with DELETE, is that POST is a much more &quot;wide open&quot;\n&gt; verb than DELETE. POST has an expectation of a media type argument,\n&gt; and has different behaviors. DELETE has none of these. There is no\n&gt; payload other than the URI, and there&#39;s no result other than success\n&gt; or failure.\n\nYes, POST is a generic &#39;prcess this&#39; and DELETE is not. However, note  \nthat there can be a sematic attached to DELETE based on the hypermedia  \ncontext of the target resource. If you know from some hypermedia that  \nresource R represents an order you might well know from the associated  \nhypermedia specification that calling DELETE on the order resource  \nresults in order cancelation (and noy just the technical removal of  \nall representations).\n\nYou could do the same with POST by defining in the spec that POSTing a  \ncertain payload to the order (e.g. a cancelation message) results in  \norder cancelation.\n\nThe benefit of using DELETE is the added visibility. DELETE has some  \nsemantics that are independent from any side effects on the server,  \nfor example that it is idempotent, that caches can erase any copy of  \nthat resource they might hold on to, etc.\n\nWhen designing hypermedia semantics, it is a benefit to make use of  \nthe other HTTP verbs if they fit the domain semantics of the  \ninteraction. Canceling an order can be done with a DELETE because  \neverything that is true for DELETE is also true for &#39;cancel order&#39;. By  \nusing DELETE instead of POST you gain the additional visibility. In  \nfact, by using DELETE you gain visibility - POST (the &#39;process this&#39;  \nstyle) has no visibility at all.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Arguably, the availability of a DELETE link in the hypertext informs\n&gt; the client that a DELETE is possible, but that is all.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Standard Interface defines what the individual verbs do, but does\n&gt; not define when they are or are not available. Just because everyone\n&gt; &quot;knows&quot; what DELETE does, does not mean that any and all resources\n&gt; can, or should be deleted.\n&gt;\n&gt; You could see an interesting argument between a server and a client\n&gt; when a client tells teh server to delete a resource, and then\n&gt; complains that the server actually did delete the resource rather than\n&gt; return an error. The server can say &quot;Why did you delete the resource,\n&gt; I&#39;ve never sent you anything that told you that you could.&quot; because\n&gt; the server never sent a media type with a DELETE link in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus the distinction between Standard Interface and actual behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; But this is still confusing regarding non-hypertext media types,\n&gt; notably common things like JPGs etc., which typically do not have a\n&gt; representation that tells the client what it can and can not do. I\n&gt; guess the only way for this information to be conveyed would be on,\n&gt; say, an index page.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example: http://example.com/images can return a result listing all\n&gt; of the images, a link to POST to add an image, and individual links to\n&gt; PUT and DELETE all of the existing images.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, clearly, you can not get this information by getting the resource\n&gt; itself, http://example.com/images/pic1.jpg, as that media type is not\n&gt; hypertext capable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess at this point you&#39;d need to rely on Link headers, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; know the standardization status of those yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
