[rest-discuss] wrote:\n&gt; This particular issue has arisen in the design of home automation systems.  Specifically, I&#39;m working in a standards body (the ZigBee Alliance) that has classically used a binary protocol that does not really adhere to any true architectural design (IMHO).  I&#39;ve been engaged in work that started in ZigBee and has now moved to IEEE (2030.5) that (attempts to) rigidly stick to a RESTful HTTP design.  One request that has come up is to port toggle switch capability to this standard.  Home automation manufacturers have actually implemented toggle switches this way in the past (see http://zigbee.org/Products/ByStandard/ZigBeeHomeAutomation.aspx).\n\nit sounds like the scenario we were talking about, that all you want is \nto tell the resource to &quot;reverse its state&quot;. in this case, i&#39;d POST a \nbody that represents this request, in whatever serialization you happen \nto prefer. the resource toggles. everybody&#39;s happy.\n\nbut i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned \nabout race conditions. which seems to imply that instead of just \ntoggling, you&#39;re also assuming that you&#39;re &quot;toggling *from* some state&quot;. \nbut that wouldn&#39;t be the &quot;blind toggle&quot; we discussed. could you clarify \na bit how exactly the operation that you&#39;re trying to design is defined?\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
