Some of\nthe fields are basic flags and others are lists of i=\r\ntems that could be\nempty or up to as many as 100.  There isn&#39;t really any h=\r\nierarchy to the\ndata or any value to expose them as resources individually.=\r\n  Providing\nthe data in a POST would work but then the concern is we need t=\r\no store\nthe output of the formula which also contains a good amount of fiel=\r\nds on\nthe server in order to respond to the future GET.  We are eventually\n=\r\ngoing to feed this service into a larger application and would like to\nbe a=\r\nble to scale as we get large amounts of data fed through.  If the\nresult da=\r\nta is stored in memory, we would lose the ability to scale out,\nand in esse=\r\nnce make the system not &quot;stateless&quot;.\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Jan Algermissen  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; And if you really have to:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 22.04.2013, =\r\nat 20:56, &quot;scott vernon&quot; vern33nova@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; so where would we stor=\r\ne the intermediate data\n&gt;\n&gt; Build up the state on the client.
