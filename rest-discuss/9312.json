I feel my validation resource just needs one action and\ni=\r\nt seems to me that PUT would be the correct way to create it, since\nthe cli=\r\nent has all of the data for the request.\n\nFrom a Rails application, I&#39;m thi=\r\nnking I should send out a link to the\nresource as:\n\n  http://whatever.com/v=\r\nalidations/{user-hash}?_method=3DPUT\n\nI&#39;m just looking for some critique of=\r\n this idea.  Am I one the right\ntrack here?\n\nThanks for the advice.\n\nJames =\r\nEdward Gray II\n\n\n"}}
