I think that&#39;s quite a neat idea, but\n&gt; it strikes me =\r\nthat it&#39;s getting awfull close to a WSDL spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both XForm and WSDL defi=\r\nnes how to POST data adhering to a specific XML\n&gt; schema. If you then add a=\r\n list of links to XForms, the list would be much\n&gt; like the WSDL list of me=\r\nthods/messages. The rel=3D&quot;&quot; types would specify WSDL\n&gt; message names.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIn all we could =A0have an HTML 5 list like the one below and call it the W=\r\nSDL\n&gt; method list:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;dl&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot;=\r\n&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;dd&gt;Description&lt;/dd&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;/dl&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Each of the ac=\r\nhors then points to an XForm which in turn points to an XML\n&gt; schema defini=\r\ntion and defines POST urls - just like WSDL does.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this good or bad? =\r\nIs it better or worse than WSDL and WADL?
