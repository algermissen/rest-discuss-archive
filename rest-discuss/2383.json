There is\n&gt; this idea that if we PUT a resource through its URI, then we GET\n&gt; that resource back, we should get back the same value as we PUT.\n&gt; That statement implies that we have representation-level control,\n&gt; which we do not.  It would make more sense to think of it this\n&gt; way.  If we PUT a representation to a URI, then GET back a representation,\n&gt; the latter representation *means the same thing* as the former,\n&gt; though it may differ in format or even typographically.  THoughts?\n&gt;\nI think this is the only way to think about it when considering content\nnegotiation (or at least potentially different content-types for a\nrepresentation).\n\n"}}
