So, all the client needs to do\n&gt; is return the content (or the current state from the XML content)\n&gt; along with some additional input, which the FSM uses to select the\n&gt; next transition/state.\n\nI think the way it typically works is that the &quot;current&quot; state\nis represented by the data returned from the last request, and\nthat the embedded links in that (arbitrarily many, according to the\ntransition set of your FSM) are invitations for the client to\ntransition to the next state.  Does that make sense?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; However, while that&#39;s likely true for trivial examples like mine,\n&gt; for real world, complex problems, I&#39;m sure that clients cannot fly\n&gt; blind, so to speak.  Client developers will have to understand the\n&gt; FSM and the BP (business process) that is behind it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I&#39;m agreeing with you.  There are things that can be done to\n&gt; help, for example, provide a description of the BP, provide an XML\n&gt; specification of the BP, describe the mapping from the BP to the\n&gt; FSM (or to an XML document that describes the FSM), provide\n&gt; documentation on the FSM, provide an XML document that describes\n&gt; the FSM (along with tools to inspect it), etc.\n\nNow you&#39;re talking about &quot;choreography&quot;, which is not what\nI meant at all.  I meant something like the opposite, that &quot;clients\ncan fly blind&quot; in the sense that you can accomplish something\n(you and your code) without having a representation of the\napplication&#39;s FSM in front of you.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a bit mysterious to me.  By &quot;explore the state space&quot;, do\n&gt; you mean that the client can find out what states (nodes) are in\n&gt; the FSM and which are connected to which?  If so, I&#39;d agree that\n&gt; the client needs access to this information (a picture of the\n&gt; entire FSM), one way or another.\n\nYes to the first part; no to the second.  Why wouldn&#39;t the\nclient be able to &quot;explore&quot; state space, and having so done,\ndraw its own map of that space as an FSM or whatever?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; However, the client developer should also be able to take a\n&gt; &quot;peep-hole&quot; view.  For example, &quot;I&#39;m in state X, so all I have to\n&gt; do is provide this input (e.g. a user ID).&quot; Or, &quot;If I&#39;m in state X\n&gt; and I provide a valid user ID, what happens?&quot;\n\nAre you missing the role that URIs embedded in representations\nplay in this?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Think of it this way -- Suppose we have an FSM that analyzes a\n&gt; stream of characters.  All the client should be required to do is\n&gt; to continually feed the next character.  For more complex\n&gt; processes, all that should be required of the client is to feed the\n&gt; next piece of input (e.g. a user ID and password, a part number,\n&gt; etc).  Granted that the developer of the client application would\n&gt; have to understand the BP/FSM in order to know what information to\n&gt; provide.  However, I can imagine a server implementation (the FSM)\n&gt; that provides a description of the next required piece of input\n&gt; with each response.\n\nThat&#39;s how it should work.  &quot;Hypertext as the engine of application\nstate&quot; and all that.\n\nWM\n\n\n"}}
