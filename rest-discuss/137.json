You\ncould PUT to it if you wanted to change the notification trigger rules\nand expiry time. You could GET it to remind yourself of the notification\ntrigger rules and expiry time. You could fiddle ACLs on it to allow\nother people to fiddle with your notifications. In other words, it\nshould be a first-class resource.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
