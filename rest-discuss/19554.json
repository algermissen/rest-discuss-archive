I am specifically curious\n&gt; of best pract=\r\nices for the former case, when a RESTful API aims at letting\n&gt; consumer wor=\r\nk through a specific workflow (eg. buying a book online).\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought the=\r\n best practice was to let user land ton an entry point\n&gt; resource (eg colle=\r\nction of books) and then let user evolve in the workflow:\n&gt; first by afford=\r\ning user to initiate the workflow (eg. &quot;rel=3Dbuy&quot; which\n&gt; likely translate=\r\ns with GETing a &quot;buy-a-book-form&quot; resource, letting user\n&gt; discover which i=\r\nnputs are need to start the workflow). Then subsequently,\n&gt; each step in th=\r\ne workflow will afford user to confirm an order, select\n&gt; payment informati=\r\non, shipping details... Ultimately the server will confirm\n&gt; creation of an=\r\n order resource (and maybe  provide a shipment resource\n&gt; allowing user to =\r\ntrack shipping status or to cancel order, etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt; In such typical workflo=\r\nw scenario, is it a bad practice to expose rels as\n&gt; &quot;actions&quot; (thus verbs)=\r\n? I think of having server sending relevant actions\n&gt; on each step (as part=\r\n of resource representations), letting user discover\n&gt; HTTP methods and tar=\r\nget resource to interact with as a result of activating\n&gt; the hypermedia co=\r\nntrol (action).\n&gt;\n&gt; In the example of AtomPub, we have a similar hypermedia=\r\n control &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; (verb) to afford atom consumer a given feed entry can be =\r\nedited. Which\n&gt; translate with a PUT to the target href (the target feed en=\r\ntry).\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, what is the best practice to express hypermedia a=\r\nctions in\n&gt; a RESTful way, to allow consumer to control the workflow while =\r\nthe server\n&gt; controls the affordances of the user (based on internal applic=\r\nation state)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Phil\n&gt;\n&gt; Le 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58, Mike Kelly &lt;mikekelly3=\r\n21@...&gt; a =E9crit :\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:31 AM, Jan Alger=\r\nmissen\n&gt; &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 08.11.=\r\n2013, at 02:08, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not s=\r\nure i understand the Q, but i&#39;ll offer this:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;http://exampl=\r\ne.com/rels/publisher&quot; describes the relationship\n&gt; between the source and t=\r\nhe target.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like to try to emphasize what the target is *to t=\r\nhe source* with the\n&gt; goal that the application-level effect of the HTTP me=\r\nthods falls into place.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This IMO helps a great deal with avoiding t=\r\no layer specialized\n&gt; application protocols on top of HTTP (which already i=\r\ns the application\n&gt; protocol).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IOW, it helps prevent redefinitions =\r\nof the meaning of HTTP methods. POST\n&gt; means POST, it cannot mean &#39;publish =\r\nthe source resource&#39;. DELETE means\n&gt; DELETE, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish the =\r\nthe source resource&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, those methods have a general meaning wi=\r\nthin the uniform\n&gt; interface of HTTP whose purpose is to add to the self-de=\r\nscriptiveness\n&gt; of messages and, in doing so, to afford intermediation acro=\r\nss the\n&gt; system (e.g. web caching). The HTTP method definitions attribute\n&gt;=\r\n meaning designed for this purpose (e.g. establishing safety,\n&gt; idempotency=\r\n, cacheability, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; Provided the link relations are not in conflict w=\r\nith the HTTP\n&gt; definitions, and are merely qualifying the details of method=\r\ns within\n&gt; the context of a given transition, then it is wrong to think abo=\r\nut\n&gt; that in terms of &quot;redefinition&quot;. It&#39;s qualification.\n&gt;\n&gt; In practice, =\r\nit&#39;s much easier for consuming parties if your\n&gt; documentation is specific =\r\nby providing an explicit description of the\n&gt; meaning and structure of the =\r\nvarious requests possible over a given\n&gt; link. Leaving your documentation s=\r\no abstract that the reader is left\n&gt; with the task of inferring every part =\r\nof each possible request does\n&gt; not seem like a very pragmatic approach for=\r\n custom link relations (but\n&gt; may be more appropriate for standardised link=\r\n relations).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you find yourself in a situation that you absolutely =\r\nmust tell the\n&gt; client developer this, rephrase the hypermedia semantic (he=\r\nre: the link rel\n&gt; spec).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is nothing to say againts hints reg=\r\narding the intended &#39;canonical&#39;\n&gt; use case but I can always only be a hint.=\r\n AtomPub is an example, where the\n&gt; spec tells us so much about the interac=\r\ntions between client and server that\n&gt; it looks like a protocol when it is =\r\nactually only hints about a canonical\n&gt; application flow. Focussing on reso=\r\nurce semantics would have been much\n&gt; nicer, IMHO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One simply canno=\r\nt constrain HTTP servers that way and still have REST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The importan=\r\nce of HTTP methods from a REST point of view is that they\n&gt; create **some**=\r\n visibility of the client server interactions, so that\n&gt; the messages can b=\r\ne understood to _a certain extent_ by\n&gt; intermediaries. Provided that visib=\r\nility is not impacted (i.e. a link\n&gt; rel&#39;s qualification of a method doesn&#39;=\r\nt _conflict_ with HTTP&#39;s) then\n&gt; how does this have any bearing on the &quot;RES=\r\nTfulness&quot; of the\n&gt; application?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; M\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b10c92f07c5d604eac44c12\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;content-type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=\r\n=3Dutf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body dir=3D&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Appreciate the feedback and experi=\r\nence sharing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So reusing my use case if buying a b=\r\nook, what rels would define from the root book collection resource?

It _assumes_ the client code=\r\n already &quot;knows&quot; things (action and target are coupled) and const=\r\nrains the possible options for the client (&quot;you can only do a single a=\r\nction for this control, want to do some other action? sorry, no control for=\r\n that here, move along&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;in t=\r\nhe big picture, i&#39;ve found keeping target identifiers (collection, stor=\r\nage, document, person) decoupled from action (share, modify, copy, move, ap=\r\nprove, cancel) is a big win. while it adds some indirection/complexity to t=\r\nhe representation (both at design-time and run-time) this pattern also adds=\r\n more options and increases the independence of the client application. inc=\r\nluding allowing clients to (in some cases) create new successful workflows =\r\nthat the server didn&#39;t map out even though it is completely allowed by =\r\nthe state machine.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;FWIW, if you wan=\r\nt to continue to constrain clients to only following strict server pre-defi=\r\nned paths, you can still do that while sticking to the &quot;rel is for rel=\r\nationships&quot; pattern.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;Cheers.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_ext=\r\nra&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;mamund&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span title=3D=\r\n&quot;Call with Google Voice&quot;&gt;+1.859.757.1449&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nskype: mca.amu=\r\nndsen&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://amundsen.com/blog/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://amu=\r\nndsen.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/mamund&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/mamund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://github.com/mamund&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mamund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.linkedin.com/in/mamund&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/mamun=\r\nd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat, Nov 9, 2=\r\n013 at 12:59 PM, Philippe Marsteau &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nmarsteau@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;marsteau@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wro=\r\nte:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-=\r\nleft:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;I see 2 dis=\r\ntinct purposes of link relations: either to qualified a transition from one=\r\n state to another of the resource, or to describe how two resources relate =\r\none to another.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This discussion I think focused o=\r\nn the latter. I am specifically curious of best practices for the former ca=\r\nse, when a RESTful API aims at letting consumer work through a specific wor=\r\nkflow (eg. buying a book online).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought th=\r\ne best practice was to let user land ton an entry point resource (eg collec=\r\ntion of books) and then let user evolve in the workflow: first by affording=\r\n user to initiate the workflow (eg. &quot;rel=3Dbuy&quot; which likely tran=\r\nslates with GETing a &quot;buy-a-book-form&quot; resource, letting user dis=\r\ncover which inputs are need to start the workflow). Then subsequently, each=\r\n step in the workflow will afford user to confirm an order, select payment =\r\ninformation, shipping details... Ultimately the server will confirm creatio=\r\nn of an order resource (and maybe =A0provide a shipment resource allowing u=\r\nser to track shipping status or to cancel order, etc.)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;In such typical workflow scenario, is it a bad practice to expose =\r\nrels as &quot;actions&quot; (thus verbs)? I think of having server sending =\r\nrelevant actions on each step (as part of resource representations), lettin=\r\ng user discover HTTP methods and target resource to interact with as a resu=\r\nlt of activating the hypermedia control (action).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;In the example of AtomPub, we have a similar hypermedia control &quot;e=\r\ndit&quot; (verb) to afford atom consumer a given feed entry can be edited. =\r\nWhich translate with a PUT to the target href (the target feed entry).&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In other words, what is the best practice to expre=\r\nss hypermedia actions in a RESTful way, to allow consumer to control the wo=\r\nrkflow while the server controls the affordances of the user (based on inte=\r\nrnal application state)?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Phil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Le=\r\n 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekelly321@gmail=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mikekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; a =E9crit=A0:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;p&gt;On Fri, Nov 8, 201=\r\n3 at 1:31 AM, Jan Algermissen&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jan.algermissen@nor=\r\ndsc.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jan.algermissen@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Hi Mike,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On 08.11.2013, at 02:08, mike amundsen &lt;&lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:mamund@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mamund@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not sure i understand the Q, bu=\r\nt i&#39;ll offer this:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://example.com/rels/publisher&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://example.com/rels/p=\r\nublisher&lt;/a&gt;&quot; describes the relationship between the source and the ta=\r\nrget.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I like to try to emphasize what the ta=\r\nrget is *to the source* with the goal that the application-level effect of =\r\nthe HTTP methods falls into place.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This IMO helps a great=\r\n deal with avoiding to layer specialized application protocols on top of HT=\r\nTP (which already is the application protocol).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; IOW, it h=\r\nelps prevent redefinitions of the meaning of HTTP methods.  POST means POST=\r\n, it cannot mean &#39;publish the source resource&#39;. DELETE means DELETE=\r\n, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish the the source resource&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWell, those methods have a general meaning within the uniform&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ninterface of HTTP whose purpose is to add to the self-descriptiveness&lt;br&gt;\no=\r\nf messages and, in doing so, to afford intermediation across the&lt;br&gt;\nsystem=\r\n (e.g. web caching). The HTTP method definitions attribute&lt;br&gt;\nmeaning desi=\r\ngned for this purpose (e.g. establishing safety,&lt;br&gt;\nidempotency, cacheabil=\r\nity, etc).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nProvided the link relations are not in conflict with th=\r\ne HTTP&lt;br&gt;\ndefinitions, and are merely qualifying the details of methods wi=\r\nthin&lt;br&gt;\nthe context of a given transition, then it is wrong to think about=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nthat in terms of &quot;redefinition&quot;. It&#39;s qualification.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn practice, it&#39;s much easier for consuming parties if your&lt;br&gt;\nd=\r\nocumentation is specific by providing an explicit description of the&lt;br&gt;\nme=\r\naning and structure of the various requests possible over a given&lt;br&gt;\nlink.=\r\n Leaving your documentation so abstract that the reader is left&lt;br&gt;\nwith th=\r\ne task of inferring every part of each possible request does&lt;br&gt;\nnot seem l=\r\nike a very pragmatic approach for custom link relations (but&lt;br&gt;\nmay be mor=\r\ne appropriate for standardised link relations).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you find y=\r\nourself in a situation that you absolutely must tell the client developer t=\r\nhis, rephrase the hypermedia semantic (here: the link rel spec).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; There is nothing to say againts hints regarding the intended &#39;c=\r\nanonical&#39; use case but I can always only be a hint. AtomPub is an examp=\r\nle, where the spec tells us so much about the interactions between client a=\r\nnd server that it looks like a protocol when it is actually only hints abou=\r\nt a canonical application flow. Focussing on resource semantics would have =\r\nbeen much nicer, IMHO.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One simply cannot constrain HT=\r\nTP servers that way and still have REST.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe importance o=\r\nf HTTP methods from a REST point of view is that they&lt;br&gt;\ncreate **some** v=\r\nisibility of the client server interactions, so that&lt;br&gt;\nthe messages can b=\r\ne understood to _a certain extent_ by&lt;br&gt;\nintermediaries. Provided that vis=\r\nibility is not impacted (i.e. a link&lt;br&gt;\nrel&#39;s qualification of a metho=\r\nd doesn&#39;t _conflict_ with HTTP&#39;s)  then&lt;br&gt;\nhow does this have any =\r\nbearing on the &quot;RESTfulness&quot; of the&lt;br&gt;\napplication?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nChe=\r\ners,&lt;br&gt;\nM&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff=\r\n;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b10c92f07c5d604eac44c12--\r\n\n"}}
