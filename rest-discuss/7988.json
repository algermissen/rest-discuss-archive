It=\r\n&#39;s called RESTEasy, and you can read more \nabout it here:\n\nhttp://resteasy.=\r\ndamnhandy.com/\n\nAt present, it&#39;s very much a work in progress and has many =\r\nrough edges and typos. It utilizes \nJAXB2 quite heavily and integrates very=\r\n nicely with JPA and Hibernate 3. It should be noted \nthat JAXB will not be=\r\n a requirment. Curious to hear anyones thoughts.\n\nRyan-\n\n\n"}}
