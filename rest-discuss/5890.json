However I don&#39;t buy the metadata argument. What at&#39;s the end of \n&gt; the URI is a resource, not a file. Resources are known only be their \n&gt; representations. If those representations are stored in a file system, \n&gt; fine; but they may be stored other ways.\n&gt;\n&gt; The client operating through PUT or DELETE or MOVE has no reason to know \n&gt; or care about any metadata that never appears in the representation. If \n&gt; the metadata is somehow visible then it needs to be encoded in the \n&gt; method body or HTTP headers that the client PUTs to the server. \n&gt; Otherwise it&#39;s irrelevant like any other form of server state.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI&#39;d also like to point out that REST is an API (mainly) to be\nimplemented.\n\nSo MOVE&#39;s atomicity would rely on developers implementing it\ncorrectly.\n\nSince we see lot&#39;s of invalid implementation of HTTP verbs (GETs that\nare not idempotent for example) it&#39;s safe to assume that hardly\nanybody will be able to implement an atomic MOVE.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
