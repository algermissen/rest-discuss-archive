If the interface all applications use for streamed\n&gt; processing is &quot;httplib.HTTPConnection()&quot; then why does anyone care\n&gt; whether TCP is underneath or not?\n\nNonononono...  sorry, let me be more clear.  People *don&#39;t* care if TCP is underneath,\nthat&#39;s not the issue.  I&#39;m pointing out that HTTP etc. is a framework which allows\narbitrary applications supporting a generic interface to be plugged together in\narbitrary ways to achieve new functionality --- just like the filesystem namespace and\nfile / stream- IO on UNIX.  Consider the following:\n\nls /foo &gt; /tmp/foo; wc -l /tmp/foo\n\nWhat have I done there?  I&#39;ve *written a program* that counts the files in a\nparticular directory, and I&#39;ve done it by *composing* (plugging together) two\ndifferent components that don&#39;t know anything about each other.  How am I able to do\nthat?  Well, all resources in &quot;true&quot; UNIX (okay, so the paradigm didn&#39;t get pushed far\nenough until Plan 9, but anyway) are represented in the filesystem namespace and have\na common generic interface:  open, read, etc.  They all look like named bytestreams.\nIn a sense, the UNIX abstractions support a crude kind of compositional algebra of\noperations for stream processing.  And this is a very powerful integration framework.\n\nThe Web is similar, it&#39;s just harder to see because we don&#39;t have good dataflow /\nstream scripting tools and conventions.  GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. are very analogous to\nthe file IO system calls in UNIX.  The fact that most people access the Web through\nmore procedural interfaces (e.g. &quot;httplib.HTTPConnection()&quot;) often obscures this fact,\nbut it&#39;s a fact nonetheless.  Application domains which are appropriately modeled as\nresources with appropriate semantics for the standard methods can therefore use each\nother in arbitrary and ad-hoc ways that the original developers didn&#39;t necessarily\nanticipate.\n\nThe motivation for re-modeling various application domains as resources on the Web is\nmuch the same motivation for pushing all kinds of abstractions (such as the process\ntable, network connections, etc.) into the filesystem in various UNIX variants:  it\nlowers the cost of reusing / integrating those components.  Sure, you can model your\nchat application as an entirely new protocol, but then it makes it harder to integrate\nwith other things.  Having HTTP as *the* one generic model for doing distributed\ncomputation *increases* the overall value of the Web, because it increases\nexponentially the number of connections available between network-available\ninformation and services, while at the same time vastly simplifying the process of\nplugging those things together.\n\nThat&#39;s all I was pointing out.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
