Do you make a distinction be=\r\ntween two\nresources whose state happens to have the same value, and two\nres=\r\nources who share the same state?\n\nIf I have two clocks, A and B, I can set =\r\nthem to have the same time.\nMaybe A is simulating traveling at the speed of=\r\n light, so gradually A\nand B no longer have the same time. So initially the=\r\n state happened to\nhave the same value.\n\nOr I can synchronize A and B to th=\r\ne same time. And by this I want to\nmean that if I reset B, A will be reset =\r\ntoo. This sounds like shared\nstate. But then I would think that there is a =\r\nthird resource, C. I\nhave set C to a particular time, and set A and B to re=\r\nfer to C. Which\nmeans there is no shared state at all. \n\nOr maybe I am comp=\r\nletely missing the point.\n\nKevin\n\n\n"}}
