(WAS: what is state?)\r\nIn-Reply-To: &lt;200209090847.13947.miles@...&gt;\r\nMessage-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.44.0209092037080.29926-100000@...&gt;\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII\r\nFrom: Michael Day &lt;mikeday@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=120282171\r\n\r\n\n&gt; If resources can be nameless then we can&#39;t define &quot;resource&quot; primarily \n&gt; in terms of URIs ... ie. we can&#39;t say,\n&gt; \n&gt;   X is a resource if and only if X is identified by some URI\n\nThat seems reasonable, as there will always be some things we want to talk\nabout, refer to, infer properties of and so on for which there are no\nsuitable URI schemes. Or, resources that have a local name but no global\nname, such as the email I am editing right now, before I send it (after it\nis sent it will end up with possibly many global names, such as message id\nURI and HTTP URI for the archive, etc).\n\n&gt; * Unnamed resources do away with the &quot;only if&quot;, but is this a step in\n&gt;   the direction of doing away with the &quot;if&quot; too ... ie. if we can have\n&gt;   unnamed resources, why can&#39;t we also have names with no resource? eg.\n&gt;   http://www.example.com/nothing-here-folks.\n\nThe only way to have a name without a resource is to have a randomly\ngenerated URI with no intended meaning whatsoever. That&#39;s subtly different\nfrom having a meaningful resource with no representation. For example,\nconsider &quot;news for 1 Jan 2003&quot;. That&#39;s a resource, but until 1 Jan 2003\nyou won&#39;t be able to get a representation of it. Nonetheless, you can\nreason about it, assert properties of it such as &quot;the news for 1 Jan 2003\nwill be read by news presenter X&quot; and so on.\n\n&gt; * If having a URI isn&#39;t the criterion of resource-hood, then what is? Is \n&gt;   &quot;resource&quot; just an RFC 2396 compliant way of saying &quot;thing&quot;?\n\nPerhaps this thread would be a good place to come up with a canonical\nsentence describing resource, if there isn&#39;t one already. I see it as\nbeing any thing that has a meaning. Which, is not much of a definition.\n\n&gt; * In the context of the discussions on the TAG list, is a URI-less\n&gt;   resource &quot;part of the Web&quot;?\n\nA few years ago, resources without HTTP URIs would not have been\nconsidered to be part of the web (barring FTP, Gopher proxies and what\nnot). Now, who knows? With RDF, presumably foo://your/mother is a\nperfectly valid resource that&#39;s part of the semantic web, once the foo URI\nscheme has been approved.\n\n&gt; * How, if at all, do the kind of unamed resources that Mark&#39;s talking\n&gt;   about here relate to RDFs anonymous nodes?\n\nSomeone who knows more about RDF please answer this :)\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
