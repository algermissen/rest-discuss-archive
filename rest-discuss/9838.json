I mean, there is no difference over =\r\nhere (in the URI)\n&gt; between the drafts and the entries which are publicly v=\r\nisible. (this\n&gt; is similar I hope to the cancelled_orders and shipped_order=\r\ns , 2\n&gt; different states of the resource). I don&#39;t do A PUT on\n&gt; example.or=\r\ng/drafts/post1 to make it publicly visible . Similarly , I\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t use =\r\na PUT on the list at /cancelled_orders or\n/shipped_orders.\n&gt;\n&gt; imho.\n&gt;\n&gt; I =\r\nam not that experienced. If this is just a point where\n&gt; implementation con=\r\nvenience over rides other things, then please tell\n&gt; me so. I am just conce=\r\nrned that I may be making a mistake in my\n&gt; understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; de=\r\nv\n&gt;\n\n\nI&#39;m not that familiar with the Atom Pub RFC (unfortunately) so I can&#39;=\r\nt\nspeak directly to that.  However it would seem that app:draft controls\nvi=\r\nsibility of a resource - a tad bit different from what we are dealing\nwith =\r\nhere.  Unfortunately, I think you&#39;ll have to point out what is not\nRESTful =\r\nabout the proposed solution?  FTR, I might actuallyPOST to\n/canceled_orders=\r\n since I am adding to a collection (POST(a)) - since\ntrying to decide on th=\r\nat one.\n\n\n\n"}}
