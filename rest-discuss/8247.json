But there might be cases\n&gt;  where you have to model non-CRUD operations in your REST system - and\n&gt;  not all reasons are technical. You customers are used to a certain\n&gt;  vocabulary which contains well-known and well-accepted verbs and you\n&gt;  simply can&#39;t change them to fit the &quot;resource&quot; paradigm.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So given this constraint that you absolutely must have non-standard\n&gt;  verbs, what&#39;s the best way to model them?\n\nStefan Tilkov dealt somewhat with the CRUD issue in his blog comment,\nso I&#39;ll come at this from a different angle:\n\nWhat vocabulary do you really have in mind?  You mentioned &quot;walk&quot; and\n&quot;talk&quot; in your blog entry, but I got the impression that those were\nmade-up examples.  Any discussion might be more more useful if we\nconsidered the real problem.\n\n"}}
