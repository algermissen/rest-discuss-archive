As a result, intermediaries are\n&gt;      installed to filter traffic.  That is a hard problem for\n&gt; general-purpose\n&gt;      application protocols, so we need to make it easier in order to make\n&gt;      filtering more efficient and gain the trust of firewall admins.\n\nI am wondering how much thought you have put into application\nsecurity and how it fits in with REST. Do you have a model for how\napplication security should be done? Has there been an exploration\nof how application security affects other REST guidelines? It\nseems like supporting access control has ramifications for many\nparts of REST, the most well-known effect being the interplay of\nHTTP Auth and caching. It seems that if not done carefully,\naccess control could negate many of the benefits of REST. What are\nyour thoughts?\n\nThank you for sharing your expertise.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
