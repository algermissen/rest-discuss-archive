I also think the single-system approach\n&gt; is the wrong one.\n&gt; \n\nYeah, it only took about a year for the ramifications of Roy&#39;s blog\npost to fully sink in, as it stood my understanding of REST on its\nhead for the first time in a long time (and I hope the last time).  The\ndifficulty of coming to grips with how wrong I&#39;ve been in the past\nimpeded my ability to come to grips with what Roy was saying.  I wasn&#39;t\nfar off, but I was failing to recognize the importance of standard\nmedia types in both the derivation and application of REST.\n\nI think the best thing Roy can do for REST at this point, is to set\nWaka aside for a bit and publish the &quot;missing chapter&quot; on media type\ndevelopment.  Surely it exists as notes, if not in draft form, Roy?\nPretty, pretty please with sugar on top, dredge it up and dust it off,\nI&#39;m dying to read it! \n\n&gt;\n&gt; I only disagree that despite the best of intentions, people who\n&gt; create something new (within their bounded context) for which there\n&gt; is no standard can&#39;t call their systems RESTful. But your &quot;(or at\n&gt; least standardizable)&quot; quote above suggests that we&#39;re actually don&#39;t\n&gt; disagree that much after all.\n&gt; \n\nThis is the point I was trying to make earlier.  My extension to Atom\nProtocol to allow for PATCH is absolutely worthless in the absence of a\nstandardization effort.  Which is why I have to make sure my proposal\nisn&#39;t restricted to implementing my feature, but defines something\nuseful in a generic sense that&#39;s of value to others.  That the REST\nstyle encourages this sort of thinking is a Good Thing.\n\nUntil such time as a standard is accepted, I will refer to my system as\nREST* because the system only becomes RESTful at that point, as if by\nmagic...  If there&#39;s no standardization effort involved, then the\nproprietary result fragments the Web and does not achieve the goals of\nREST, and as a consequence, cannot be called REST or even REST* because\nof the lack of intent to use standards, a key element of the style.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
