I am arguing about how to\n&gt; design RESTful applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My rule of thumb is that the thing has multiple resources behind it if\n&gt; &gt; you have to invent a new addressing scheme to talk about the things, and\n&gt; &gt; you start embedding those addresses in XML documents or passing them\n&gt; &gt; around as parameters to APIs etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; A username is an identifier that exists in an address space\n&gt; separate from the URI address space.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the original example, if the application is designed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign\n&gt; &gt; &gt; travel is overrated anyways.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would presume that every city has its own URL and the only question is\n&gt; &gt; whether every user is allowed to see every city or whether they get an\n&gt; &gt; authorization complaint.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can only make this presumption if there is an established and\n&gt; adhered to convention that it is RESTless to do otherwise. Are you\n&gt; ready to declare so?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Great.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was very surprised to read that Roy does not agree with us.

Fielding wrote:\n&gt; &gt; REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy, are you saying that the &quot;must&quot; is a &quot;should&quot;? I used\n&gt; &quot;should&quot;, not &quot;must&quot;. If you wish to even further weaken the\n&gt; constraint, I think you should provide clear and objective\n&gt; guidance on when an important resource need not have an\n&gt; identifier. If you have already done so, please provide a link.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thursday 03 July 2003 18:40, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A user-specific resource is an important resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Great.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you accept points 1 and 2, the argument is made. Points 3 to 5\n&gt; simply draw out the consequences of 1 and 2. Given points 1 and 2,\n&gt; it is RESTless to not give a user-specific resource a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resources.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; HTTP auth can be used to do two things. One is to disallow access to a\n&gt; &gt; resource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let&#39;s say I send you a\n&gt; &gt; URL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect\n&gt; &gt; example). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a\n&gt; &gt; preference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a\n&gt; &gt; usability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for\n&gt; &gt; it and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I am not arguing against container URLs. I am arguing\n&gt; against the absence of user-specific URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am also not arguing that Slashdot should actually implement a\n&gt; user-specific URL for its home page. I am only arguing that it is\n&gt; RESTless for Slashdot to not do so. In this case, it is likely\n&gt; that this RESTless design will have no negative consequences.\n&gt; This result will not always be the same. The more &quot;important&quot; the\n&gt; resource, the more likely it is that RESTless design will have\n&gt; negative consequences. RESTless design of a less &quot;important&quot;\n&gt; resource may go unnoticed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect that RESTless design is more of a problem in a web\n&gt; service than in a web site. A web site may have many appearance\n&gt; variation resources that are not present in a web service.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clear rules help us identify potential design problems and avert\n&gt; them. This is the basis for engineering. You seem to be taking the\n&gt; stance that a feel-good &quot;anything goes&quot; ruleset should be used.\n&gt; This leaves REST without a real model or way of evaluating\n&gt; designs.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is OK to call things RESTless and still use them. However, if\n&gt; you are unable to correctly categorize designs, you reduce your\n&gt; ability to improve your designs. Let&#39;s drop the squeamishness\n&gt; around calling things RESTless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyler\n\n-- \n\n[CC] Counter-copyright: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cc/cc.html\n\nI reserve no rights restricting copying, modification or distribution of\nthis incidentally recorded communication.
