Sorry if I&#39;m being pedantic, but jeesh.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you look at the uri@... list archive, there has been discussion\nabout creating a URI templating standard, which can serve as the basis of\ndescribing (somehow) a site&#39;s URI structure.  \n\nI have studied everything I could find regarding URI Template, and I think\nit is (in part) exactly what is needed! I just wasn&#39;t aware it had it&#39;s own\nlist; thanks for pointing that out to me.\n\n&gt;&gt; I think this approach, of figuring out a way to define a site&#39;s URI\nstructure which is machine- readable\n\nOh, but that is where I was headed; using URI Template (in conjunction with\nother ideas.)  I just decided not to include in my first message so as to\nsimplify my message.\n\n&gt;&gt; Or, for that matter, defining either singular or plural pathnames as a\nbest practice...\n\nCool.  Wanna at least be a lurker in the discussions?  Join\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/welldesignedurls/\n\n&gt;&gt; But that result would be your system of &quot;wellformedurls&quot; as defined at\nwellformedurls.org, not REST as defined in Roy&#39;s thesis.\n\nLike I said; &quot;A rose by any other name...&quot;   Given how much resistance there\nis to consider REST as something tangible, having another name would\nprobably be a great thing. :)\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
