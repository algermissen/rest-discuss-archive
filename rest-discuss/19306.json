Does anyone\n&gt; have any advice on how best to manage that tension?\n\nmaybe i am misreading what you&#39;re saying, but i don&#39;t really see a \ntension in the sense of a conflict, more a design trade-off. prefetching \nis on the implementation level (it seems), and you would prefetch \nsomething based on the assumption that a request to a linked resource \nwould be received soon, right? the tricky part probably is to avoid \nmaking prefetching stateful, assuming that the request for the related \nresource will be processed by the same server (if you have more than \none). so if you make prefetching stateful, you run the risk of making it \nunlikely to actually provide you the benefit it can provide in a more \nstateful setting. so i guess in the end my answer would be: don&#39;t start \nimplementing stateful patterns based on perceived performance benefits \nthat rely on your service behaving in a stateful way.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
