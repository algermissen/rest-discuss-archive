The\noutcome would be the same - more standardization.\n\nI guess this is where the benefit of true document style integration  \nreally\nis found: the above can happen (and in fact often did) if the  \ninterface is\nalready uniform and we only have to deal with the payloads. I doubt that\na similar (decentralized) process of &#39;natural selection&#39; (excuse the\nDarwinistic touch :-) can ever lead to API standardization as WS-*\nproponents seem to think.\n\nJan\n&gt;\n&gt; And on a related note what strategies have people employed when\n&gt; defining data formats to make them extensible? Judicious use of &#39;any&#39;\n&gt; and &#39;choice&#39; elements in XSDs lead to a horrible mess (IMHO). Are\n&gt; people generally using Relax NG and Schematron to define data\n&gt; structures? Of course this assumes that people are using XML ...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be extremely interested to hear any and all opinions on the\n&gt; subject(s).\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Phil\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
