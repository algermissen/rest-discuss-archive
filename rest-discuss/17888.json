In some systems=\r\n I also support PUT for updating the state of resources created using the f=\r\nactory, but do not want to allow creating such resources with PUT. \nIn such=\r\n contexts, which HTTP status code do you advise to return when an attempt i=\r\ns made to PUT to a request URI that does not identify an already existing r=\r\nesource? In other words, how do you signal that creation at that URI with P=\r\nUT isn&#39;t possible because of this particular application design? \nI have of=\r\nten used 404, but I&#39;m also seeing 405 or even 403 being used.\nI&#39;m curious a=\r\nbout the collective wisdom of this group on this subject. \nThanks,\nPhilippe=\r\n Mougin\n\n\n"}}
