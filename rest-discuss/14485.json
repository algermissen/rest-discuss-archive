But I\nalso thought I gave a good answer -- response codes and security\nimplementation.  I was simply pointing out that anything beyond\n&quot;almost&quot; probably belongs in-line.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I ought to\n&gt; &gt; be able to determine everything I need to know that isn&#39;t covered by\n&gt; &gt; media type or protocol definitions in-band from the hypertext.\n&gt; \n&gt; One question: how do you *choose* the service to interact with?\n&gt; \n\nBy following a published link to some resource.  Any entry point on\nyour system ought to allow me to navigate to whatever resource of\ninterest I wish to bookmark as a future entry point.\n\nConsider the website I&#39;m developing now, for a local law firm.  Each\nattorney has an entry on cobar.org whether they want it or not.  I\ncan&#39;t link from the attorneys&#39; entries on their own domain, to their\nentries on cobar.org, because cobar.org violates the identification of\nresources constraint.  The only bookmarkable entry point to their\nattorney-info retrieval service is at its root level.\n\nI ought to be able to publish a link from each attorney to his or her\nentry on cobar.org, and anyone following that link ought to be able to\ndetermine the URI allocation scheme from introspecting the link, and\ncreate their own link to some other attorney without ever consulting\ndocumentation.  Instead, I would have to disguise a POST form as a\nlink, and that form could be introspected to determine the API, but\nyou can&#39;t bookmark a POST request.\n\nBut I digress.  It&#39;s just this pragmatic aspect of REST was thrown in\nmy face yesterday, when I had to explain to my client why I can&#39;t link\nhis page to his cobar.org profile.  He did not understand why I could\nnot just link to something he could navigate to, initially.  Web APIs\nlike cobar&#39;s put Web Developers between a rock and a hard place with\ntheir clients, that we shouldn&#39;t have to deal with at all.  Go REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
