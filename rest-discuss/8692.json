Agreed that they are perhaps only &#39;dimly RESTful but, \n&gt; again, a far cry from an inherent inability to be RESTful. An existence \n&gt; proof in the form of a URL would help ... but I think it would be \n&gt; difficult to deploy a web application, accessible via a browser, that \n&gt; /couldn&#39;t/ be RESTful at all.\n\nI think you&#39;re nitpicking.\n\nTo be clear about my meaning:\n\nHotmail is not RESTfull. It clearly is not RESTfull.\n\nThere are bits around hotmail that are RESTfull, the homepage, the\nabout page (though even that has got a wierd url) and so forth. But\nthe application is not itself RESTfull.\n\nThat&#39;s not to say that you couldn&#39;t build a RESTfull webmail app,\nindeed I have; or even that Hotmail couldn&#39;t be rewritten to be\nRESTfull. But then it would look pretty different to what it does now.\n\n\n&gt; Respectfully, I tend to disagree -- all of a systems components should \n&gt; respect the\n&gt;  broader system architecture. Javascript and AJAX are prime examples of \n&gt; the code-on-demand style where one should avoid undermining the \n&gt; principles of REST. The chain only being as strong as the weakest link, \n&gt; and all that. ... For example, what good is it for the page containing \n&gt; the Javascript to be cacheable, while all the niggling little AJAX \n&gt; requests are not?\n\nBut why are they not cacheable? There&#39;s no reason at all that the AJAX\nrequests cannot be cacheable. As I write this I am working on a little\nbit of code to if-modified-since enable an AJAX accessed Django app.\n\nThere is no reason that the resources called from AJAX in a browser\nshouldn&#39;t be subject to the same constraints as the rest (pun\nintended) of the app.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
