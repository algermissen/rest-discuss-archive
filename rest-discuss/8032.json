What&#39;s relevant is in the eye of the\nbeholder.  \n\nIf one is dealing with application-level consumption of data, it makes\nsense to see application-level structures.\n\nIf one is doing _data management_ , or logical analysis of data, it\nmakes sense to see it in an application-INdependent structure like\nrelations or a graph, so that first-order predicate logic can be\napplied to the analysis.  \n\nThe former is &quot;classic REST&quot;, the latter seems to be the &quot;RESTful\nsemantic web&quot; that TBL traveling towards with Tabulator.\n\nThis is similar to the old argument of object vs. relational databases.\n  Most object databases had to re-implement set theory and FOPL to work\non top of the applicatoin-biased domain models, if the business were to\nget any independence of data.\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nExpecting?
