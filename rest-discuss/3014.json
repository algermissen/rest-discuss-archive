Indeed, in the jabber framework, an empty query return a description\n&gt; of the fields to feel to submit the query, allowing clients to create\n&gt; submission forms without knowing anything about the ressource.\n\ni don&#39;t know much about jabber, but maybe this will be of some use to\nyou anyway.\n\ni have a URI for the form.  if we were talking about bank accounts, the\nURI would be\n/accounts/form/\n\nto get the form i do a GET on this URI.  the target of the returned form\nrepresentation is the container URI.\n\ni also have people editing a single resource which is not a container\nusing something that looks like\n/accounts/1234/form/\n\nyou could say these forms are &#39;sub-resources&#39; of the &#39;accounts&#39; or\n&#39;account&#39; resource.  i don&#39;t know whether that makes much sense; this\nwas just a good (enough) way for me to load already-populated forms.\n\n&gt; I think the first solution is the most suitable, but in this case, which\n&gt; status/header should be return ?\n&gt; is 400 Bad Request  ok ?\n\ni&#39;m not sure what case you&#39;re referring to here so i&#39;ll try cover every\nangle i am aware of.\n\nin my system the POST response would be a &quot;201 Created&quot;, the GET is just\na normal &quot;200 OK&quot;.  as for input which is lexically or semantically\ninvalid, i just use &quot;400 Bad Request&quot;, but only because i&#39;m not sure\nwhether there is something more specific i should be using.  i wonder\nwhether it should be 4xx Bad *Representation* (because it&#39;s not like\nthere&#39;s something wrong with the HTTP headers or anything) but i digress.\n\nHTH,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
