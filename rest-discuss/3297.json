Are you expecting\nto\n&gt;&gt;receive the service description as=\r\n the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS\n&gt;&gt;response?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess that&#39;s the poi=\r\nnt of OPTIONS, I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;d get\n&gt; back.  If it&#39;s a WSDL, t=\r\nhere are tools that can parse it directly; if\n&gt; it&#39;s a text description, th=\r\nere&#39;s more work to do.  But in any case,\n&gt; one could ask exactly the same q=\r\nuestions about the metadata even if\n&gt; it were a separate resource.\n\nThis br=\r\nings up a question, can you do content negotiation\nwhen doing OPTIONS? That=\r\n way you could support \nmultiple file formats for describing web services. =\r\nFor \nexample could you do an OPTIONS call with the header:\n\nAccept: applica=\r\ntion/wsdl+xml, application/rsd+xml\n\n      -joe\n\n"}}
