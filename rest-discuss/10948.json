And therein is the significant distinction. A\n&gt;    REST-conformant user agent would process the form or URI template and\n\nI am aware of\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-03.txt,\nbut I am unaware of any standard practice for uri templates commonly\nused at this point (among the contenders: Opensearch,SRU,Google&#39;s query\nlanguage). So we do not yet have a set of shared conventions there.\nIt&#39;ll be great when we do, but it is still a practice waiting to be\nstandardized. I&#39;d suggest that some of those approaches could be deemed\nmore RESTful than others, even though there is no standard practice.\nSame w/ using a cookie in the way I suggest (although admittedly, my use\nof cookies is largely a &quot;fix&quot; to compensate for inadequate support for\nHTTP auth in the browser).\n\n\n&gt;    present it decently to the user only because the media type dictates a\n&gt;    set of shared conventions. (For example, HTML documents in the World\n&gt;    Wide Web are HTML documents because their media-type label is\n&gt;    &quot;text/html&quot;. If one changes the label to &quot;text/plain&quot;, the entity body\n&gt;    has lost most of its meaning and is no longer HTML.) The cookie is\n&gt;    opaque to the user agent (and to connectors and to intermediary\n&gt;    components).\n&gt;    &gt; Note that the cookie is to be used 1.\n&gt;    &gt; to construct the proper uri for the resource (by including the\n&gt;    username,\n&gt;    &gt; which is the value of the cookie) in the uri\n&gt;    Did you mean &quot;Note that the cookie is to be used to construct the\n&gt;    proper\n&gt;    URI for the resource (by including the username, which is the value of\n&gt;    the cookie, in the URI)&quot;? If that is what you meant, did you also mean\n&gt;    that the user agent would construct the URI from the cookie? I don&#39;t\n&gt;    know of such a practice, so I&#39;m curious to read about it. If, instead,\n\nYes, I mean the browser reads the cookie to figure out how to construct\na URI. This is my approach to &quot;personalized&quot; resources: the bulk of the\npage is available at a generic URI, and an AJAX request makes a second\nrequest, using a URI that includes the username: some JSON is returned\nthat is then inserted in to the page to display information and/or\nhyperlinks available to this user. While cookies typically &quot;refer&quot; to\nstate saved on the server, in this scenario that &quot;state&quot; lives at a url\nand must be retrived and inserted into the page, thus becoming hypertext\n(In the interest of HATEOS).\n\n&gt;    you mean that the origin server would construct the URI from the\n&gt;    cookie,\n&gt;    then we have a situation in which the user agent is clueless about the\n&gt;    meaning of the cookie and we are back to a violation\n&gt;    &gt; [the cookie is to be used] in conjunction with\n&gt;    &gt; another cookie (which contains a hash of &lt;a secret key + usename&gt;) to\n&gt;    &gt; provide a means to authenticate the request.\n&gt;    Here, again, we would have a violation of the constraint of\n&gt;    self-descriptive messages. Cookies are not defined as vehicles for\n&gt;    authentication credentials.\n\nYes, that&#39;s true. I am as much describing a useful practice as\nanything, given a less-than-ideal reality regarding browsers and\nidentity/authentication.\n\n&gt;    &gt; [...] it&#39;s not\n&gt;    &gt; correct to say that cookies in HTTP always violate REST (to the\n&gt;    extent\n&gt;    &gt; that we have a common understanding of &quot;in HTTP,&quot; &quot;violate,&quot; and\n&gt;    &quot;REST&quot;\n&gt;    &gt; which may, I suppose, not be the case).\n&gt;    I think that we have a common understanding of the phrases &quot;in HTTP&quot;\n&gt;    and\n&gt;    &quot;violate&quot;. I am unsure about whether we have a common understanding of\n&gt;    &quot;REST&quot;, but I think that our understandings of &quot;REST&quot; are close enough\n&gt;    that the discussion is beneficial.\n\nOne thing I am trying to avoid is treating REST as if it were just\nanother spec like RFC 2616. While it is, of course, no more and no less\nthan what Roy Fielding says it is in his dissertation, he has commented\nthat the dissertation was as much about &quot;principled design.&quot; Meaning\nthat REST is a set of principles/constraints, the use of which maximizes\nsome positive effects and the violation of which minimizes or cancels\nthose positive effects. While one can take a hard line about what\ntechniques &quot;violate REST,&quot; I find it somewhat more useful to consider a\nrange of practices that, given the curent state of browser support for\nHTTP/1.1, maximizes the same positive effects that the constraints of\nREST maximize. Is what I am describing REST? Well, perhaps not in the\nstrictest sense, but in another sense -- a set of principles, adherence\nto which results in beneficial effects, I think so. I personally think\nthat building RESTful web applications without ever using cookies is\nimpractical. As Aristotle has pointed out, intelligent use of cookies\nquite consonant with the aims of REST.\n\nWhat I enjoy about this list is the airing and critiquing of techniques\nuseful to real world RESTful web application design. You might be amused\nto see my commit log trail a day or two behind some of the discussions\nhere (as well as atom-syntax & atom-protocol) as I learned about or\ngained a greater understanding of particular techniques. I am generally\ngrateful when others point out why an approach I am using is unRESTful\nor unwise, so I am certainly open to hearing about alternatives.\n\nthanks-\npeter keane\n\n\n"}}
