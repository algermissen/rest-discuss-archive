How are they to integrate\n&gt; them with the=\r\n web - AFAIK most HTTP servers don&#39;t come with nice\n&gt; plugins to expose (fo=\r\nr example) mainframe-based Cobol apps, or\n&gt; massive SQL-based databases as =\r\nweb services. Do they have to write\n&gt; completely custom applications to do =\r\nit, or buy an ESB solution,\n&gt; where the amount of custom code (should be?) =\r\ncould be minimized?\n\nI am involved in this kind of effort currently.\n\nOf co=\r\nurse these existing things can be be exposed as HTTP-based\nservices, SOAP-b=\r\nased services, or something else (or all of the\nabove).\n\nI have not found t=\r\nhe effort reduced by the specific choice of service\ntechnology. In general =\r\nyou want to avoid exposing the legacy\nparticulars that should not matter. C=\r\nonsumers of the service should\nnot have to change when you swap out the leg=\r\nacy thing for a new\nthing. Or more likely *add* new things from different s=\r\nources. Legacy\nthings tend to go away slowly.\n\nIf you don&#39;t make good desig=\r\nn choices, and expediently just expose a\nCOBOL app or a SQL database pretty=\r\n much as-is over HTTP, SOAP,\netc. then you&#39;ve saved perhaps a little bit of=\r\n &quot;custom code&quot; written\nonce at the cost of never being able to change that =\r\nservice once it\nbecomes widely used in production.\n\nAs it stands I&#39;ve appre=\r\nciated the way an HTTP-based\nresource-state-transition-and-transfer approac=\r\nh seems to enforce the\ndesigning/thinking aspects of implementing a service=\r\n around a legacy\nthing. But I tend to think about designing and cost-of-cha=\r\nnge\ngenerally. Certainly HTTP services can be screwed up as easily as\nSOAP.=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
