Sqlrest currently\nhandles the simple case where there is a single primary key,\n\nhttp://sqlrest/accounts/customer/001\n\nbut the obvious extention for composite keys, to just keep\nadding levels, might be RESTful but it is not particularly\nrelational.\n\nhttp://sqlrest/accounts/customer/ACME/Pheonix\n\nMy thoughts went off on a different tangent. \nSQL uses queries to identify a particular row.\n\nselect * from customer where company=&#39;ACME&#39; and branch=&#39;Pheonix&#39;;\n\nThe URL equivalent of this might be:\n\nhttp://sqlrest/accounts/customer?company=ACME&branch=Pheonix\n\nObviously this is a perfectly legitimate URL as it is a query on\na resource and in this case the resource is a table. However, the \nrow is also a resource. In fact it is the row that we are\nmost interested in modifying, so would using the above URL as the \ntarget of a PUT or DELETE be reasonable in this particular case?\n\nThis mechanism extends easily to identify a column within the row.\nThis URL might be appropriate to retrieve the company logo in the\nform of a gif.\n\nhttp://sqlrest/accounts/customer/logo?company=ACME&branch=Pheonix\n\nOnce again this URL could be the target of a PUT or DELETE.\n\nI will leave it at that for now. I have pushed out my straw man\nand I am watching with interest to see how long he lasts.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Roy T. Fielding [mailto:fielding@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 5 February 2004 4:03 PM\n&gt; To: Donald Strong\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Restful URIs\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why is there a preference, within the REST community, for URIs of the \n&gt; &gt; form\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     http://university.edu/ws/student/001\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; rather than this form?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     http://university.edu/ws/student?id=001\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there a specification that mandates the former or is it simply \n&gt; &gt; consensus\n&gt; &gt; within the group that the former is &quot;more RESTful&quot; than the latter?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several reasons.  The first is simply practical: many\n&gt; caches do not cache responses to requests that contain what appears\n&gt; to be query information, since there is usually less of a chance\n&gt; of a future hit on the same query.  Server-side caches can optimize\n&gt; around that for their own common queries, but they have no way of\n&gt; changing the intermediaries.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second reason is that path is a hierarchical name space, unlike\n&gt; the query.  If you are using hierarchical tools to manipulate\n&gt; hierarchical spaces, it is best to avoid escaping from the hierarchy\n&gt; in arbitrary ways.  A hierarchy is, after all, simply a pre-established\n&gt; query with a defined order among elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; The third reason is that there is only one query portion of a URI.\n&gt; If you use it for silly reasons, then it won&#39;t be as useful for\n&gt; actual queries (user-driven options).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure there are other reasons -- those are just off the top of\n&gt; my head.  There are also implementation-specific reasons, such as\n&gt; more predefined options in Apache for handling requests in the path,\n&gt; resulting in more efficient handling of blobs of data that are stored\n&gt; as simple files.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n\n"}}
