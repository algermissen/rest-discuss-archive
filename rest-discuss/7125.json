What exactly is  \n&gt;&gt; the &quot;RESTful&quot; way to handle side-effects?  Is the goal to define  \n&gt;&gt; resources for everything in the (relevant) known universe, so  \n&gt;&gt; there is no such thing as a &#39;side effect&#39;? Or am I asking the  \n&gt;&gt; wrong question?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There can easily be side effects in a REST system (though I&#39;d  \n&gt; certainly try to minimize them, just as I would in an OOP system).  \n&gt; The key is to make sure that anything with a serious side effect  \n&gt; occurs through POST rather than GET. GET should never have side  \n&gt; effects.
