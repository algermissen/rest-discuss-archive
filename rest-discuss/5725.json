Suppose a client takes the\nreprese=\r\nntation, changes the &quot;total&quot; element to make it inconsistent\nwith the rest,=\r\n and then PUTs it back to the server. Should the server\ncheck to make sure =\r\nthat the representation is valid, and throw an\nerror otherwise? Or should i=\r\nt just pay attention to the changeable\nvalues, and return the corrected rep=\r\nresentation? Is there some\nstandard/recommended way to document which field=\r\ns are available for\nchanging?\n\nThanks-\nScott\n\n\n\n\n"}}
