Townley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I see URI templates as a pragmatic shortcut so that\n&gt; agent authors don&#39;t need to bother with interpreting the hypermedia they\n&gt; receive. This makes writing agents more in line with standard modes of\n&gt; thinking about software design and implementation, e.g. to accomplish a\n&gt; task, you make calls to functions with known parameters in an order\n&gt; determined by the caller to trigger state transitions and/or receive\n&gt; some expected output.\n\nWell, it may be that many people use URI templates as a shortcut for\nusing hypermedia but there *are* valid uses of URI templates that do\nnot entail cheating.\n\nFor example, in the application on which I work tracks time series\ndata for a large number of metrics.  Each metric is a resource, as is\nthe observations for those metrics.  Many (non-browser) agents need all \nthe observations from specific time frames to perform their work.  To\nfacilitate this we have provided a &quot;link&quot; in the metric\nrepresentations to any time based subset of the observations for that\nmetric using a template. For example,\n\nhttp://foo.example/metrics/232/observations?start={start_time}&end={end_time}\n\nThis works quite well for us, and I cannot think of any other approach\nthat would be as efficient and simple.  It is worth noting that we do\nnot guarantee that URL will exist in the future.  Rather, we guarantee\nthat there will be a URL template in the metric representations that\nyou can substitute `start_time` and `end_time` into and use get the\nset of observation in that time frame.\n\nPeter Williams\nhttp://pezra.barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
