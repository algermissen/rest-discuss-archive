Why can&#39;t a message \nresource\n&gt; be &quot;subordinate&quot; to an index resource?\n\nNothing about an index implies subordination of indexed resources.  You can \nPUT a message somewhere else and then updating the index.  You can add an \nentry to the index for a URL that does not currently resolve.  In contrast, \nthe only way to add a message to a container is...to add a message to a \ncontainer, making the message subordinate to the container.  Indexes don&#39;t \nimply subordination.  Containership does.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s how directories work, right?\n&gt; If I GET a directory, I expect a hyperlinked list of its contents, not all\n&gt; the contents together in an archive.\n\nSince HTTP URLs are hierarchical, an enumeration of all subordinate URLs is \nsufficient to communicate &quot;whatever information&quot; the directory URI \ndesignates.\n\nNotably, because indexes don&#39;t themselves imply subordination of indexed \nresources, you can&#39;t take an index to imply that you add a file to a \ndirectory by POSTing to it.  To get an entry to appear in the index, you \nmust put a corresponding file in the directory.\n\nSo you can view my objection to POSTing to Yannicks message indexes as \nequivalent to objecting to POSTing to directory URLs.  The semantics just \naren&#39;t there to do it.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS GREAT question Justin!\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
