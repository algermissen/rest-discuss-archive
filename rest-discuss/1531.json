I think that after you do all of the\nnegotiation and credit card stuff you should just have a &quot;click here to\ndownload your data&quot; (i.e. a pointer to a GET URI). You might also have a\nlink to &quot;click here to download your license file.&quot; The former URI is\nprobably shared by all downloaders and the latter is specific to a\nparticular downloader. i.e.\n\n/downloads/ourproduct.exe\n/license/7439239473298749328.lic\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
