From the website:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;REST-* is an organization dedicated to brin=\r\nging the architecture of the \n&gt; Web to common patterns in middleware techno=\r\nlogy&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The name REST-* was, on purpose, supposed to convey images of W=\r\nS-*. \n&gt; Other than being tonque-and-cheek, and ignoring the negative \n&gt; con=\r\nnotations of WS-*, WS-* generally equates to defining middleware:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The=\r\n REST-* community aims to introduce new REST-based standards for \n&gt; these t=\r\nraditional services&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The key word was *traditional*.   What I think I =\r\nshould have said was:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The REST-* community aims to morph these tradit=\r\nional services into a \n&gt; more RESTful approach through a set of open specif=\r\nications.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\nI&#39;m in total slackjawed awe that you guys conciously made t=\r\nhis decision, as techincal people.  At least you could blame your marketing=\r\n folks, and distance yourself from the situation.\n\nI think you are sort of =\r\nmissing the point of Stefan&#39;s feedback and Roy&#39;s criticisms.\n\nYou shouldn&#39;t=\r\n come up with some one sentence catch-all slogan, either.  Instead, you sho=\r\nuld probably look at your project analysis document and scope statement, un=\r\nderstand what the heck it is you are trying to do, and explain what problem=\r\ns you are going to solve.  To repeat,\n\n&gt; &quot;The REST-* community aims to morp=\r\nh these traditional services into a \n&gt; more RESTful approach through a set =\r\nof open specifications.&quot;\n\ndoesn&#39;t communicate anything but a big fat :words=\r\n: emoticon, so people will just give you a :tl;dr: emoticon back.\n\nHonestly=\r\n, I don&#39;t even understand how you are pushing REST at JBoss.  I would expec=\r\nt whatever persuasion you used there to be mirrored in your marketing mater=\r\nial to external devs.  But I don&#39;t see it.  What I see is fuzzy thinking.  =\r\nYou might be right, but in no thanks to fuzzy thinking.\n\nI&#39;m mostly frustra=\r\nted myself, dealing with a lot of dumb &quot;REST API&quot; libraries that simultaneo=\r\nusly claim to be &quot;object-oriented&quot;, when they explicitly pass values down a=\r\n call chain, creating a hierarchical dependency chain between callers and c=\r\nallees.  This looks a lot like Structured Design to me, not OO.  Also, I fi=\r\nnd vendors of &quot;REST APIs&quot; poorly document their own services.  &quot;It&#39;s self-d=\r\nescribing, you figure out what went wrong.&quot;  I guess REST also means to the=\r\nse people &quot;ping service, random junk reply, you figure out what to do with =\r\nit&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
