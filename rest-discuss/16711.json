I can point out that you&#39;re asking\n&gt; the wrong question, though...  the proper questions are what properties\n&gt; are you seeking to induce, and what constraints do you apply to achieve\n&gt; those properties?  From REST Chapter 6.5:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Why is this important?  Because it differentiates a system where\n&gt; network intermediaries can be effective agents from a system where they\n&gt; can be, at most, routers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you honestly don&#39;t care about traversing network boundaries, or re-\n&gt; use by intermediaries if you do, then I can think of at least three\n&gt; REST constraints off the top of my head which are irrelevant to your\n&gt; needs -- IOW, why choose REST as an architectural style if it&#39;s\n&gt; fundamentally inappropriate to your design goals?\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone keeps asking if it&#39;s OK to ignore the uniform interface in\n&gt; situations where the uniform interface is irrelevant to their needs...\n&gt; sure, just don&#39;t call the result REST, or obsess over it not being REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; The first three chapters of Roy&#39;s thesis lay out a terminology and a\n&gt; rationale for deriving networked application architectures (including\n&gt; but not limited to hypermedia applications).  The next two chapters lay\n&gt; out the design concerns of the REST style, and the methodology used to\n&gt; derive it based on the terminology and rationale from Chapters 1-3.\n&gt;\n&gt; If your concerns are different, then following Roy&#39;s methodology won&#39;t\n&gt; lead you to REST, but to some other style -- all that matters is that it\n&gt; leads you to an architectural style that&#39;s appropriate for your system.\n&gt; You can name it whatever you want, because an architectural style is\n&gt; really just a named set of interdependent constraints -- which is why\n&gt; omitting any constraint results in a different style.\n&gt;\n&gt; Start with the null style (as described in Chapter 5).  Apply the subset\n&gt; of architectural constraints which result in the properties you seek to\n&gt; induce (as described in Chapter 3).  Ignore the subset of architectural\n&gt; constraints whose properties don&#39;t advance you to your goal.  The result\n&gt; is an architectural style appropriate to serve as a design guideline\n&gt; when modeling and implementing your system.\n&gt;\n&gt; If that style doesn&#39;t require media types, so be it, but the REST style\n&gt; sure does -- most intermediaries only care about a limited subset of\n&gt; media types (meaning registered).  Which is why self-descriptive\n&gt; messaging is essential to the REST style -- it allows traversing of\n&gt; network boundaries (not guaranteed without using media types, could be\n&gt; seen as tunneling) while enabling intermediaries to act as intelligent\n&gt; agents (participate in the communication beyond being routers).\n&gt;\n&gt; Saying you don&#39;t care about those properties, means you have no need\n&gt; for the full set of REST constraints, means you have some other set of\n&gt; constraints, which isn&#39;t the same set of constraints defined by the term\n&gt; REST.  Which is not to say you shouldn&#39;t follow Roy&#39;s thesis, only that\n&gt; you can&#39;t *expect* that methodology to result in the same architectural\n&gt; style Roy defines for purposes you state aren&#39;t relevant to your\n&gt; system&#39;s needs, anyway...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e686cd3ab6daa50491c49dfa\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nSo what I am hearing you saying is one should start with the types of \nprop=\r\nerties they want a system to induce and apply the constraints that \nlead to=\r\n the emergence of those properties.
