As Roy said, DELETE means\nroughly &quot;remove any representations for this resource&quot;, so in that\ncase - if I understand your intent - it would probably remove any\npictures, or data, of/about his right arm.\n\nIn other words, query parameters don&#39;t matter.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
