In other words, \nfrom an HTTP server perspective, how does one properly combine things \nlike entity tags, conditional requests, ranges and content encoding to \nname a few?\n\nEven after going through Jeffrey C. Mogul&#39;s &quot;Clarifying the \nFundamentals of HTTP&quot; and such, I&#39;m not the wiser :P\n\nhttp://www2002.org/CDROM/refereed/444.pdf\n\nAny pointers, guidelines, opinions or advises very welcome :)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers,\n\nPA.\n\n\n"}}
