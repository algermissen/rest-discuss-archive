Application is far mor=\r\ne that just a component. My definition includes business goals and the like=\r\n, so I won&#39;t enter there.\n\n2. A system includes not only the components but=\r\n the inter-relationships, interfaces and externally visible properties. As =\r\nI once stated in this forum, a client is a role, and can be played by one c=\r\nomponent inside a system A, and by another system B consuming services on S=\r\nystem A. So we can have a system of systems, where their components can be =\r\nplaying different roles, one of them being a client.\n\n3. That clarified, RE=\r\nST is an architectural style that defines component roles and rules of enga=\r\ngement to achieve a set of quality properties. Theory says that one compone=\r\nnt not playing the role or not following the rules, may affect the property=\r\n quality achievement. Clear?\n\n4. Now, in any modern architecture developmen=\r\nt, we architects should not focus only in functional requirements, but in q=\r\nuality properties too. That means making decisions about how things are goi=\r\nng to work, stating policies and making sure those policies are enforced. F=\r\nollowing this line of thinking, implementing an architectural conception th=\r\nat follows REST style, but that does not enforce the rules or does not even=\r\n detect a rule is being broken (a governance problem), I should say it is a=\r\n weak implementation. And if we are not in control of all components (other=\r\n people creating their services and clients) then we may not achieve the qu=\r\nality properties after all.\n\n5. But all that is not REST fault, and shouldn=\r\n&#39;t care less. That is the work of the architect, designers and developers a=\r\nnd other stakeholders. REST is not an out-of-the-box solution you get when =\r\nyou install a framework and use it. A framework may help, but the actual su=\r\nccess of delivering business value comes from the work of all people. You w=\r\nill get nowhere if a bunch of your developers keep not following the rules.=\r\n If an external &quot;client&quot; enters the system, and is not playing the rules, m=\r\nay affect the quality properties, and sure it will suffer itself from that,=\r\n when the server changes the uri namespace or the flow, then it becomes a p=\r\nroblem of the spoiled client. \n\nMy two cents.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n---=\r\n In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mikekelly321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nOn Wed, Mar 7, 2012 at 10:37 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Glenn:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What about the counter view that each cl=\r\nient and server combo is the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;application&#39;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; first, i&#39;m not sure =\r\nthat is a &quot;counter view&quot; of what i said. IOW, how\n&gt; &gt; does this run &quot;counte=\r\nr&quot; to my POV?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; second, the term &quot;application&quot; can be applied lots of=\r\n ways.\n&gt; &gt; - a single component running on a singe machine,\n&gt; &gt; - a group o=\r\nf components running on a single machine\n&gt; &gt; - a group of machines running =\r\ncomponents\n&gt; &gt; - etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; finally, what is the &quot;end game&quot; here? IOW, wh=\r\ny pursue this line of\n&gt; &gt; convo? what positive things can result?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; Ok so let&#39;s move away from &#39;application&#39; and talk about a &#39;system&#39;..\n&gt;=\r\n  client behaviour has a direct impact on the nature of interactions in you=\r\nr\n&gt; system and therefore the extents to which it can evolve. So if your cli=\r\nents\n&gt; consume your service in a way &quot;that hardcodes URIs and workflow and =\r\nignores\n&gt; the affordance details I supply from the service&quot;, this will abso=\r\nlutely\n&gt; have an impact on the &quot;REST-itude&quot; of your system since it is an e=\r\nmergence\n&gt; of interaction in your system which directly violates the hypert=\r\next\n&gt; constraint.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a service provider, you can govern your clients t=\r\nhrough deliberate\n&gt; designs that constrain their behaviour and that will he=\r\nlp ensure they &#39;do\n&gt; the right thing&#39; - if you don&#39;t manage to do this and =\r\nyour clients do the\n&gt; wrong thing then I think that does diminish the quali=\r\nty of your effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
