First, can identity be assigned to\n&gt; representations?\n\nSure.  They have identity.\n\n&gt; What is the &quot;resource being posted&quot;?\n\nThe wording assumes that the information being posted is the\nrepresentation of an existing resource, which may not be the case,\ngranted.\n\n&gt; Is that the same\n&gt; as the &quot;resource being posted to&quot;?\n\nNo.  The resource being posted to would be the container, like an\nemail archive, for example.\n\n&gt; What does &quot;available through&quot; mean?\n&gt; In a hypertext sense that there is a link from R to these resources?\n\nNot just a link, but a subordinate relationship.  e.g. you might be\naddressing http://example.org/foo/bar/baz, but /foo/bar/ could be a\ncontainer which is code which decides if/when/how you get to look at\n&#39;baz&#39;.  The container may recognize that &#39;baz&#39; is now unavailable and\nreturn a 404, or permanently gone and return a 410.  etc..\n\n&gt; And anyway, why do we use the same method when we want to create new\n&gt; sub-resources versus mutate the existing resource? Seems confusing.\n\nPOST is the catch-all mutator in REST.  If there&#39;s a need to break out\na specific expected behaviour into its own method, then that&#39;s ok.  But\nI personally prefer doing things in the POST-to-a-container model, ala\nSOAPAction.\n\n&gt; Would a better name for &quot;identity preserving&quot; be &quot;sub-resource\n&gt; creating?&quot;\n\nNo, I was trying to get across that the processing done in P is\nloss-less.  i.e. that what is POSTed will be what you get back when\nyou do a GET on the Location header in the 201 response.  Actually,\nI suppose that&#39;s more &quot;state preserving&quot; than &quot;identity preserving&quot;,\nsince there is no identity to preserve.
