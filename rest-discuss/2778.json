This will cause a URL to be generated of the format\n&gt; &gt;?col1=on&col3=on&col7=on\n&gt; &gt;This URI identifies a resource which is that particular permutation of\n&gt; &gt;column names. This can be easily rendered into HTML\n&gt; &gt;Of course, using a FORM literally might not be the most chrome looking\nUI,\n&gt; &gt;so let your script kiddies go nuts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can&#39;t / don&#39;t want to reload this frame every time the link is checked.\n&gt; It&#39;s a big tree and somewhat expensive to render.\nYou don&#39;t re-load the frame on the left, you use &lt;form target=&#39;panel_right&#39;\n&gt; to reload the panel on the right.\n\n&gt; Could use javascript to generate the links on the fly, but that&#39;s also not\nnecessarily desirable\n&gt; from a RESTful pov.\nYou are in a classical browser, you aren&#39;t going to get very far into REST\nland that way.\nServe the user first, and the architecture second.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;b) use persistent data on the server to maintain state\n&gt; &gt;If this information should be long-lived, have the server maintain a URI\n&gt; &gt;that doesn&#39;t change and is unique for that user (in the same sense that a\n&gt; &gt;session variable is unique to a user). When the left hand panel POSTs\ndata\n&gt; &gt;to that URI, keep updating the selected columns and return a\n&gt; representation\n&gt; &gt;of the table with the users current set of selected columns.\n&gt; &gt;This is nice if the purpose of the app is to later use that selected &#39;db\n&gt; &gt;view&#39; in some way - perhaps to modify attributes (like &#39;max rows&#39; or\n&gt; &gt;something), as well as this approach makes that &#39;db view&#39; an identifable\n&gt; &gt;concept so you could do something like &#39;show me db #2 with view #27&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that&#39;s the one I&#39;d like to run with. Question is, what do the\n&gt; mechanics look like? When adding a column to a view, I issue a request\n&gt; something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /view?task=add&var=foo\nNo, no, no. Did I mention, no? Do not do an &#39;update&#39; with a GET.\nIf you have a single view that you add names to over time, then the requests\nwill go to the /same uri/ - so don&#39;t put things in the query terms (it is\npart of the URI).\nYou will want something like:\n\n====\n// request #1\nPOST /view?task=add\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nvar=foo\n\n// request #2\nPOST /view?task=add\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nvar=bar\n\n=====\nNotice how the same URI is used twice. That is because the same resource is\nupdated twice. Also, notice that the URI that is being used isn&#39;t all that\ngreat - all users would be appending column names all day long. You need to\nget some qualifying information intothe URI - either the userID, the viewID,\nor something.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; then I redirect the user to:\n&gt;\n&gt; /view?id=23\n&gt;\n&gt; which is the long-lived URL for the dataset view they&#39;re constructing.\nThis\n&gt; solution isn&#39;t entirely RESTful for two reasons, though, I think:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I&#39;m not specifying the view id in the change request. Due to the fact\n&gt; that I don&#39;t want to regenerate the link tree, though, this is largely\n&gt; unavoidable. I&#39;ll just store the user&#39;s active view id in their session,\n&gt; but always redirect them to a URL which they can use absent a session.\nTell me again why using a viewId causes the tree to change?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. I should be using a POST request when changing the dataset view. There\n&gt; are two reasons why I can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t though:\n&gt;\n&gt;   a. The change request is activated by a link, which can&#39;t issue a POST\n&gt; request unless use javascript links\nCausing updates on the server via a link is to be avoided. I know it would\nbe really nice to do this, but you need to avoid this anyway.\nIf you really want that kind of silent update, use javascript. If you use\ncheckboxes and send the form on each click, then you&#39;ll know when the user\nde-selects a column. Clicking links won&#39;t allow you do de-select columns.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;   b. You&#39;re not supposed to issue a redirect from a POST request\nThere are two different response status codes - one means &#39;request\nfinished - see this link for results&#39;, the other means &#39;request not\nprocessed - try again at this location&#39;.\nWhy aren&#39;t you supposed to redirect from a POST?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
