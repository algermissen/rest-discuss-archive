The guidance becomes pedantic when you don&#39;t contextualize th=\r\ne qualities - consequently you won&#39;t be able to measure the outcome. For in=\r\nstance &quot;evolvability&quot; could mean &quot;writing a new client app in a week&quot; - the=\r\nre may be several ways to get to that measurement. The task is to pick one.=\r\n\n\nThe key thing to learn is not &quot;how to do 100% REST&quot; but how to build apps=\r\n that meet certain **measurable** qualities. Roy&#39;s work in Chapter 2 gives =\r\na good starting point, but the list of qualities that apply to a given app =\r\nmay be different. \n\nSubbu\n\nOn Sep 20, 2011, at 12:01 PM, Jan Algermissen wr=\r\note:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sep 20, 2011, at 8:30 PM, Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Under=\r\nstood, but I would still classify this as pedantic guidance not based on sy=\r\nstemic qualities.

And how it will pay off exactly.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n FWIW, inside enterprise boundaries, any advantages will be seen not so muc=\r\nh in long term (decades) evolvability but much more in more flexible deploy=\r\nment scenarios in the context of constant, short notice, changes or a more =\r\ngrassroots and experimental style of exploring new features. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n [1] And there is still surprisingly few material exploring that aspect of =\r\nthe software architecture profession\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; [1] http:=\r\n//www.subbu.org/blog/2011/08/measuring-rest-2\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Sep 20, 2011, at 11=\r\n:19 AM, Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sep 20, 2011, at 7:58 PM, Su=\r\nbbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sep 20, 2011, at 6:41 AM, Jan Alge=\r\nrmissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] Which makes your service unRESTful immediate=\r\nly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Very pedantic, and not a helpful guidance.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;pedanti=\r\nc&#39; has such a negative connotation, doesn&#39;t it? &#39;not helpful&#39; does, too. ..=\r\n.. which, one might say is in turn not very helpful :-)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (And: what make=\r\ns a guidance helpful, BTW?)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; As always: IMHO, sticking to=\r\n the principles laid out by the thesis helps learning.
