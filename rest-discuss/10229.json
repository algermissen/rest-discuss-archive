Can&#39;t tell anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Google doesn&#39;t come along and say &quot;hmmm, that part of the \n&gt; hierarchy looks like an integer - let&#39;s go increment it!&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, we humans do - but the google spider doesn&#39;t (so far as I know).\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, even specialised spiders that target blogs don&#39;t \n&gt; exhibit this behaviour.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, I regard any given URI string as being practically \n&gt; opaque from the perspective of a robot.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is *not* to say that I don&#39;t like &#39;pretty&#39;, &#39;hackable&#39; \n&gt; or human-readable URIs. I sure do. Well-formedness is a very \n&gt; attractive trait in server-side URI generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I simply say that within the existing web specifications we \n&gt; cannot a produce generally interpretive robot, only one that \n&gt; treats the URIs of today as opaque and follows links of these \n&gt; opaque URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this mean that I am against the client discovering the \n&gt; server URI generation &#39;recipe&#39;? No.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not against formulating a publication mechanism for URI \n&gt; recipes, if the server wants to publish them. I&#39;m simply \n&gt; saying that there isn&#39;t a specified way of doing this currently.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is an outstanding task.\n&gt; \n&gt; This, I assume, is why Joe Gregorio has published his draft \n&gt; proposal and why the WHATWG is considering the issue.\n\nOkay..., but I&#39;m trying to discern your point. What I think you are saying\nis that there should as of yet be no client software that attempts to\nconstruct a URL based on server-provided protocols because there isn&#39;t a\ncurrently &quot;specified&quot; way of doing it (I quoted &quot;specified&quot; because I think\nyou meant that there is no current &quot;specification&quot; such as an RFC that\nestablishes a way to do this.)  Is that what you meant?\n\nIf no, please help me understand.  \n\nIf yes, then I would rhetorically ask &quot;How then do things because a\nspecification?&quot; to which I&#39;d answer that I understand that they become\nspecifications by first having a least two implementations.  And if I&#39;m\ncorrect in that then your position impedes the beneficial URI Templates from\nmore quickly gaining the foothold it needs based on a principle that URI\nTemplates would nullify.  Said another way, rather than taking a position to\nminimize functionality based on a principle wouldn&#39;t it be better to provide\none of those implementations that URI Templates needs to actually become the\nspecification that we currently lack?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
