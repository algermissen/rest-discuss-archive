Though it seems like a good \nand easy thing to do (urlrewritefilter, which Rick mentions, does rock and \ncan help clean up REST URIs nicely), but there is typically an impedence \nmismatch between objects and resources that is very difficult to bridge while \nstaying true to REST principles:\n\n1) Objects tend to be much more fine-grained than is appropriate for \ndistributed systems access.  I would have thought that we would have learned \nthis from the ill-fated EJB Entity beans fiasco of a number of years ago.\n\n2) WIth objects, the tendancy will always be towards using a RPC appoach, \nwhich is not in keeping with REST principles.  Objects tend to have little \n&quot;data&quot; and many methods, while resources (in the REST sense) are the reverse, \nwith much data and few methods. Mapping between the two concepts will be \nproblematic.\n\n3) It may be rare to find a clean mapping between lower level objects and \nresources, without using an intermediary facade layer to bridge the two \nlevels of abstraction, especially since most OO-based systems were not \ndesigned to be exposed as resources using REST.\n\nI&#39;m curious what others think of this notion of exposing objects using REST?\n\nI&#39;m especially keen to see what the patriarch of REST, Roy, has to say on \nthis?\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
