Heintz wrote:\n&gt; Assaf,\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree very, very much. So much that I used the metaphor of \n&gt; &quot;signposts&quot; for exactly this same idea [1].\n\nWhy is code gen a foregone conclusion? Why can&#39;t a DL be processed each\ntime? I really don&#39;t see the distinction between the two. \n\nBut anyway, I think I&#39;m 100% in agreement with your ideas in that post, just\nnot sure I agree that what you are doing is not a DL or that DL implies code\ngen.\n\n&gt; My most recent thinking [2] on this is that a &quot;State \n&gt; Description Language&quot; could provide a shared set of \n&gt; expectations that consumers of a RESTful system could \n&gt; opportunistically take advantage of. In this post I also \n&gt; refer to several interesting papers and systems that seem to \n&gt; indicate solutions in this light.\n\nSounds like you and Alan Dean are trying to solve the same problem[1] (as am\nI); why not work together?\n\n&gt; Mike Schinkel: Most developers won&#39;t step up to semantic web, \n&gt; RDF, state machines languages, and so on. We&#39;ve agreed on \n&gt; this generally before. \n\nYes, we have agreed on that before, and I still do.\n\n&gt; (However, I don&#39;t like the names used \n&gt; to describe people in this thread - it is just important that \n&gt; people can get some value with small effort, and more value \n&gt; with more effort.) \n\nAs a strong believer in Sapir-Whorf [2] I think it&#39;s important to give names\nto things otherwise it is hard to have a shared understanding and discuss\nthem. And I&#39;m certainly not the only one who does this [3][4].  Of course\nit&#39;s important to try and avoid perjorative labels, and for the most part I\ntry to avoid being perjorative though I don&#39;t always succeed.\n\n&gt; Any solution to this should introduce the \n&gt; smallest possible addition to enable useful and flexible processing.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion the example set by Microformats and GRDDL [3] \n&gt; together answer both the smallest implication and opportunity \n&gt; for predictive specification concerns.\n&gt; * Microformats are simple (one or a few additional pieces of \n&gt; data added to content)\n&gt; * GRDDL transforms HTML+microformats into a formal RDF model \n&gt; for any sophisticated processing\n&gt;\n&gt; In a uniform interface hypermedia system all of this (state \n&gt; transfer, signs, signposts, ...) is encoded into the MIME \n&gt; type of a Representation. How to build a good hypermedia \n&gt; system, extensible and machine processable hypermedia \n&gt; documents (and types), and process current documents with \n&gt; automation support is all very naive. Today the machine \n&gt; clients of HTTP are just starting to take advantage what \n&gt; could be done, there is a lot of opportunity.\n\nI&#39;m coming to the belief that we should distill out the concepts and make\nthose concepts available in a variety of representation formats.  For\nexample, they could be embedded in HTML+Semantic Markup (not &quot;Microformats&quot;\n[5]), in JSON, in YAML, in RSS, in Atom, in RDF, or whichever works best for\nthe given circumstance. I&#39;m off-and-on working on a RESTful framework in PHP\ncalled RESTian that will have extract the essense of what is needed to\ninteract with a RESTful service and will provide representations in whatever\nformat the client prefers. This is much like how they are define HTML5; as a\nDOM with and not as a syntax but where the DOM can be serialized to multiple\nrepresentations.  (So maybe what we have here would be a SOM, or Service\nObject Model?)\n\nI&#39;m currently thinking YAML might be RESTian&#39;s default format for service\ndescription because of its simplicity and readability.\n\nSaid another way, I think it will be a mistake to couple the information for\nRESTful service description with any particular MIME type; let&#39;s identify\nthe essence and then come up with how to describe them in different media\ntypes much as we would recognize a concept and then find the words in\ndifferent spoken languages that are using to identify the concept.\n\n&gt; This quote from section 5.3.3 of the REST thesis points to \n&gt; the goal, but doesn&#39;t give the slightest advice on how to achieve it:\n&gt;   &quot;The model application is therefore an engine that moves \n&gt; from one state to the next by examining and choosing from \n&gt; among the alternative state transitions in the current set of \n&gt; representations.&quot;\n\nWith your comment &quot;doesn&#39;t give the slightest advice on how to achieve it&quot; I\ncannot agree more! :-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://simplewebservices.org/index.php?title=Domain_Service_Discovery\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis\n[3] http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2003/09/who_are_you_mor.html\n[4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\n[5] According to Tantek Celik his process &quot;owns&quot; the ability to christen\nsomething a &quot;Microformat&quot; so better to go with the generic &quot;Semantic\nMarkup.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
