Point granted.\nWhen you ma=\r\nrshall, you create a structure in Java, an object. That structure can be a =\r\ndirect domain object or a metadata structure. \n\n1. Using a domain object is=\r\n great, as you work directly with the domain, but that may force the domain=\r\n outwards and you may have some impedance mismatch.\n2. Using metadata (that=\r\n is, an object that knows how to work with HTML for instance), has the bene=\r\nfit of still using object, but managing the original data (the HTML in this=\r\n case). The con is the poor insertion into the domain.\n\nStill, not all inco=\r\nming representations should be mapped into domain objects, some may be kept=\r\n in metadata, and the resource should not necessarily be an object.\n\nAgain,=\r\n not all is the framework&#39;s fault, and the framework alone will not make th=\r\ne thinking work for you.\n\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Nov 8, 2010 at 4:38 PM,=\r\n Eric J.

That implementation\n&gt; &gt; terminology describes a REST anti-=\r\npattern, as opposed to the hypertext\n&gt; &gt; constraint. (Granted, it&#39;s possibl=\r\ne to prove me wrong here, but such\n&gt; &gt; an explanation won&#39;t be reflective o=\r\nf typical systems, based on object\n&gt; &gt; serialization and transfer instead o=\r\nf the hypertext constraint.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Marshalling is the conversion of the =\r\nbyte stream in to the internal\n&gt; structures used (in this case) by the Java=\r\n program. Not everyone wants to\n&gt; simply work with &quot;arrays of bytes&quot; and wo=\r\nuld rather work with higher level\n&gt; data structures. To be effective with t=\r\nhe outside world, one needs to be\n&gt; able to convert to and from these data =\r\nstructures and arrays of bytes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether they&#39;re converting their data =\r\nstructure to HTML, XHTML, ATOM, or\n&gt; some purpose built representation, and=\r\n what those representations contain,\n&gt; is not germane to the discussion. On=\r\ne of the benefits of the framework is to\n&gt; make the marshalling process tra=\r\nnsparent to the overall application.\n&gt; \n&gt; Marshalling is neither an empower=\r\ning REST process, nor is it a REST killer.\n&gt; It&#39;s simply a data conversion =\r\nprocess.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
