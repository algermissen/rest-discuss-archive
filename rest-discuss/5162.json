It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only a hint, it&#39;s not a request.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s the problem..when RESTie meets The Browser. :P\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you&#39;re overestimating the role of the browser in REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is a set of strictures for the creation of webservices.\n&gt; It&#39;s primary competitor is SOAP. You don&#39;t write browser webapps\n&gt; with SOAP. You shouldn&#39;t feel constrained to write browser\n&gt; webapps with REST.\n\nAAAaaarrrggghhh!!\n\nAny time your understanding of REST disagrees with your\nunderstanding of how the Web works, one or the other is *wrong*.\n\nREST is all about Web servers, Web browsers, Web proxies, Web\nsites, Web apps, and, only incidentally, Web services. A Web app\nis just a dynamic Web site, and a Web service is just a\nmachine-readable Web app.\n\nWant to offer the user multiple representations? Go ahead and give\neach one a different extension. Why not? It helps the user\nunderstand what they&#39;re getting, besides the fact that it just\nworks. Even if you&#39;re using &lt;link rel=alternate&gt;, you need to give\na distinct URI for each representation so the browser can actually\ngrab what the user asked for.\n\nContent negotiation is not for parameterizing a request in order\nto get specific versions of a document. Parameters intended to\nexplicitly request a specific thing should go in the URI (for\nexample, as a &quot;.xxx&quot; extension on the &quot;filename&quot;). If I desire a\nPDF rendition of my bank statement, that&#39;s a specific resource\nthat I care about. I don&#39;t want HTML; that would be a different\nresource. If, on the other hand, I merely desire my bank\nstatement, and I don&#39;t care what specific file format it comes in,\nI&#39;m happy if my browser and the server conspire to give me the\nbest representation that they both support, which is exactly what\ncontent negotiation is all about.\n\nCheers,\nJustin :)\n\n\n"}}
