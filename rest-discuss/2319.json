That was a project I did for a customer unrelated to\nREST and before I understood much REST.\n\n&gt; And point some other examples than (SOAPy) Amazon and Google? I&#39;m my own\n&gt; boss, so I won&#39;t fire me if I don&#39;t use SOAP.\n\nRoughly speaking, systems which make good use of HTTP and URIs are REST\nsystems. So for instance your favorite travel site probably uses REST to\nan extent. Or your favorite discussion group. For various practical\nreasons many sites fall short of REST perfection but that&#39;s true with\nany paradigm. Reality does intervene so sometimes otherwise REST-ful\nservices will abuse URIs or cookies etc.\n\nIn terms of combinations of REST and XML, most of them are read-only.\nPublic examples include:\n\n * the Xoomle variant of the Google API (which is basically a\nrealization of [1]).\n * the entire RSS subset of the Web (which constitutes a sophisticated\ninformation system in its own right)\n * the Amazon REST (not SOAP) API\n * the SOAPBuilders test reporting API\n\n[1] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/04/24/google.html\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
