In other words a mail system in which the\n&gt; body of the message is access via URL rather than included in the message\n&gt; itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since my one line spec does exactly that.  Why do I need all the RNA docs?\n\nObviously, you don&#39;t.  Go on doing things the way you are.  If you want to\nhave a conversation of REST and MoST, that&#39;s fine.  But I&#39;d appreciate it we\ncan do it without telling me that RNA is pointless.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nope.  You still don&#39;t have a content-type for identity or inbox.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What are you talking about?  Resources dont have content-types!  Only\nthe\n&gt; &gt; representations of them do.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is the subject of the current debate.  My claim is that POST requires\n&gt; that resources MUST have content-types and that those resource\n&gt; content-types MUST be exposed whenever a client make a GET requests\nwithout\n&gt; an Accept header.\n\nWell, this is where I disagree.\n\n&gt; How the server stores the resource is irrelevant.  The server must BEHAVE\n&gt; as if the content-type is whatever it says in response to a raw GET.\n\nI do not see in the RFC where POST means anything about GET (or vice versa)\nfor the same resource.  Could you point it out for me?\n\n&gt; &gt; For instance, suppose you have a resource that is an image of me.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does it mean for the resource to be an image of you?  You have a\n&gt; resource that is an image.  RFC2616 requires that the server behave as if\n&gt; the image is stored in whatever content-type it declares in response to a\n&gt; GET or HEAD request.\n\nIt does?  Where does it claim that?\n\n&gt; &gt; Either through conneg or through different URIs,\n&gt; &gt; a GET may return a jpg, gif, png, svg, bmp, wmf, pdf, mix, pcx, or even\n&gt; &gt; ascii art. Each of those representations have a content-type.  The\n&gt; &gt; resource itself is not any one of those content-types and should not be\n&gt; &gt; expressed as such.  It *may* be that the actual bits on the server are\n&gt; &gt; stored as svg (and converted for all other content-type\nrepresentations),\n&gt; &gt; but that doesn&#39;t mean that a client should think of the resource as\nbeing\n&gt; &gt; an svg resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are confusing conneg with raw GET.  The client *should* think of the\n&gt; resource as being a text/xml+svg resource IF that is the content-type the\n&gt; server supplies in response to a GET without an Accept header.\n\nIf the client only knows about the text/xml+svg content-type, then that will\nbe its world-view of the resource regardless of what other representations\ncould be returned.  On the other hand, if the client knows both the\ntext/xml+svg and the image/gif content-types, and the resource can be\nexpressed as either, then I think it&#39;s foolish for the client to think that\nthe resource is just text/xml+svg.\n\n&gt; &gt; That is an implementation detail that has nothing to do\n&gt; &gt; with the client-server relationship. Likewise, neither the Identity or\n&gt; &gt; Inbox resources should have a content-type.\n&gt;\n&gt; If they don&#39;t have a content-type, it is not really meaningfully to talk\n&gt; about POSTing to it because without a content-type you lack a notion of\n&gt; subordinate resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; In what way is a notification subordnate to an Inbox or an Agreement\n&gt; subordinate to an Identity?  How can a client know that?\n\nWhat does this matter to the client?\n\n&gt; &gt; Because POST is sufficient.  I don&#39;t see that creating a new method\nwould\n&gt; &gt; be any more helpful.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are *already* creating a new method, the only question is whether you\n&gt; can or should call it POST.  Since the HTTP spec reserves the POST method\n&gt; name, to comply with HTTP, you must choose another name.\n\nHmm.. this seems to be the rub (or one of them, anyhow).  I think that RNA&#39;s\nuse of POST falls cleanly within the HTTP&#39;s intended use for POST.  You\ndon&#39;t.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
