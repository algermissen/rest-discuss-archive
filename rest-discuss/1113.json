I&#39;m calling\nit RSDL to avoid any confusion with WRDL. I&#39;m releasing it in the interest\nof experimentation and discussion not competition. Hopefully something cool\nwill come of it.\n\nI&#39;ve found that it&#39;s great for generating RPC-like proxies that only use\nURIs and HTTP. This isn&#39;t exactly the REST Way (and I belive that Mark Baker\ncommented on this a while back) but I&#39;m hoping that it proves more useful as\nmore features are added. I think that using the generated bindings for\nrepresentations will be especally eye-opening once that&#39;s achieved.\n\nMy next goal is to get it to generate proxies that can work with all three\nof Paul&#39;s Google API operations. After that, there&#39;s generating server\nproxies, support for other target languagues, multiple schema languages, and\nprobably more.\n\nFun stuff, all of it. :-)\n\nJason\n\n[1]\nhttp://radio.weblogs.com/0101391/2002/04/27.html#a14\n\n\n\n"}}
