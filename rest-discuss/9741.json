So, what would be the correct HTTP response code in case of &quot;partial grade upload&quot; using POST interface? For example, let&#39;s say we have\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /grade-upload/{year}/{term}/{course}\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; sec1, &quot;John Doe&quot;, A\n&gt; sec2, &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, B\n&gt; sec21, &quot;Some Guy&quot;, XX\n&gt;\n&gt; and server accepts two valid grades for Jane and John, but &quot;skips&quot; an invalid grade  for &quot;Some Guy&quot;. So the response entity body could send back a representation of &quot;invalid&quot; records along with error messages, etc.,\n\nYou could return a representation of the state of the grade list after\nprocessing the request.  You would indicate that it was a\nrepresentation of the list by including a Content-Location header.\n\n&gt; but in terms of the proper HTTP code, I&#39;m not sure. Does 200 seem like a good idea in the situation like this (partial acceptance of the resource&#39;s state/representation)? I couldn&#39;t find any suitable HTTP codes for  this situation.\n\nFunnily enough, because of some problems with the use of\nContent-Location, a new response code has been proposed which is to\nmean the same thing as when the Content-Location header has the value\nof the Request-URI.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
