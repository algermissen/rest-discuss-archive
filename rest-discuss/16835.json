You&#39;ve got a beef - clearly.  I&#39;m\ntrying to help you understand that you=\r\nr beef really isn&#39;t with\n&quot;marshalling&quot; - a factual necessity - it seems to =\r\nbe with developer&#39;s\nlazy out of the box JAXB JavaBean-to-XML object seriali=\r\nzation.\n\n&gt;&gt; You&#39;re more likely, imprecisely, referring to folks that use a\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; JavaBean to XML serialization instead of, for example, ROME for Atom\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nrepresentations - but I&#39;m trying to guess what part confuses you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm not confused. =A0Stating repeatedly that I *am* confused, is an ad-\n&gt; hom=\r\ninem argument. =A0If you want to enlighten me, that isn&#39;t how to go\n&gt; about=\r\n it. =A0I can&#39;t imagine what an object would look like, which\n&gt; serializes =\r\ninto an HTML form. =A0Yeah, you can serialize objects into\n&gt; Atom, butt-ugl=\r\ny Atom; but that isn&#39;t the REST paradigm where the\n&gt; representation is an i=\r\nnterface to the object, not the object itself.\n\nI won&#39;t again say you&#39;re co=\r\nnfused:)  I&#39;ll instead say you&#39;ve latched\non to a term &quot;marshalling&quot; and pr=\r\nojected upon it way too much meaning.\n It&#39;s also poor inductive reasoning. =\r\n You&#39;ve observed that folks using\nJAX-RS to do simple objective serializati=\r\non (a la JAXB) and you&#39;ve\napparently concluded that therefore all folks usi=\r\nng JAX-RS must do\nsimple object serialization.  The truth is, JAX-RS as wit=\r\nh most\nso-called REST Frameworks are tools that *can* support RESTful\nservi=\r\nces but can also lead to bad implementations.  That&#39;s not\nnecessarily the f=\r\nault of the framework.  For example, most Jersey code\nthat&#39;s around me is u=\r\nsing ROME to produce Atom but it&#39;s pretty close\nto this:\n\nhttp://weblogs.ja=\r\nva.net/blog/2008/02/05/integrating-jersey-and-abdera\n\n&gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t describ=\r\ne an anti-pattern - its simply factually describes\n&gt;&gt; how an Object-Oriente=\r\nd language (like Java) does these things. =A0You\n&gt;&gt; seem pretty opinionated=\r\n on Java frameworks but yet don&#39;t come across\n&gt;&gt; as a Java programmer?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; No, I don&#39;t know Java. =A0But that&#39;s irrelevant to the point I&#39;m making,=\r\n\n&gt; which is that JAX-RS contains terminology which has everything to do\n&gt; w=\r\nith Java and nothing to do with REST. =A0Personally, Java cost my\n&gt; project=\r\n years, and was a mistake to pursue -- I am not an enterprise.\n\nI&#39;d suggest=\r\n that your lack of experience with Java and JAX-RS is\nlimiting your ability=\r\n to provide a useful critique on the subject.  I\ndon&#39;t see much &quot;marshallin=\r\ng&quot;, but I see\n\n  Architecture               - &gt;         Implementation\nUnif=\r\norm Interface          - &gt;   @GET, @POST, etc.\nResources manipulated - &gt;   =\r\n@ProducesMime, @ConsumesMime\nthrough representations\nURI                   =\r\n           -&gt;    @Path\nHypermedia                   -&gt;  @Ref, @Produces, et=\r\nc.\n\nYou get the idea.  It&#39;s not perfect, but the tools are there to\nsupport=\r\n an implementation that lives within the REST constraints.\nMaybe I&#39;m comfor=\r\ntable enough with Java not to notice Java-ish\nterminology but when read the=\r\n guide:\n\nhttp://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/user-guide.html#=\r\nd0e2522\n\n... I think they&#39;ve done a pretty good job at sticking to the\nreso=\r\nurces, representations, URI, etc. speak.\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
