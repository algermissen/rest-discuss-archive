Not about the =\r\nsemantics of POST itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahem, I think you&#39;re responding a bit fast. :=\r\n)=A0 My point was exactly this;\n&gt; in REST, there are no semantics to specif=\r\nic requests any more than to\n&gt; generic ones. Every POST is &quot;process this&quot; t=\r\no the server, the payload is\n&gt; interpreted and processed, but the POST is s=\r\ntill the ambigous, context-free\n&gt; (apart from the URI and content-type) req=\r\nuest. All POSTs are the same to\n&gt; REST, and that IS ITS SECRET WEAPON!\n&gt;\n\nY=\r\nes, that is the network perspective of the interaction (aka.\n&#39;visibility&#39;).=\r\n There are also server and client perspectives of the\ninteraction which *do=\r\n* include these semantics - *established for a\nURI by the server and shared=\r\n with the client via some hypertext\ncontrol*. This has to happen otherwise =\r\nneither would have a frame of\nreference for how to make or receive the requ=\r\nest. i.e. hypertext is\nthe mechanism by which shared understanding is expos=\r\ned and controlled\nin REST applications.\n\n&gt;&gt; There are more semantics in\n&gt;&gt; =\r\na given request than those that HTTP gives us. HTTP gives us\n&gt;&gt; network-vis=\r\nible semantics, that is its purpose. The additional\n&gt;&gt; semantics in a given=\r\n request are not network-visible (but,\n&gt;&gt; importantly, so what?).\n&gt;\n&gt; Well,=\r\n I think we agree on the statement that there&#39;s more to the POST than\n&gt; wha=\r\nt REST / HTTP gives us ... most of the time, however to make the point a\n&gt; =\r\nbit more concrete, here&#39;s an example ;\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0=A0 POST /458745485 &quot;46&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nFor some people here, this lack of specifics looks like a problem. To me, i=\r\nt\n&gt; looked like a problem for a very long time, until, like Jan, I dived in=\r\n and\n&gt; embraced HATEOAS. It&#39;s *there* that semantics exists, not in the POS=\r\nT, not\n&gt; in the request itself. The focus should be on the model, never on =\r\nthe\n&gt; conversation, so to speak.\n\nAgain, you&#39;re addressing the separate iss=\r\nue of how semantics are\ndisseminated in hypertext applications. I absolutel=\r\ny agree with this,\nhence:\n\n&quot;HAL is a media type with which applications are=\r\n described and\ncontrolled via link relations.&quot;\nhttp://stateless.co/hal_spec=\r\nification.html#general\n\nThe resulting interaction (e.g. the resulting POST =\r\nrequest from\nsubmitting a form) still carries the semantics of the hypertex=\r\nt\ncontrol that was followed, and that continuity produces a &#39;flow&#39; which\nwe=\r\n call an &quot;application&quot; (the other meaning of application, not OSI\nlayer 7).=\r\n Failure is, of course, an important part of that continuity.\n\n&gt;&gt; Unless yo=\r\nu have a distinct media type identifier to cover every single\n&gt;&gt; semantic i=\r\nn your application (or intent, etc.), then those semantics\n&gt;&gt; will not be v=\r\nisible and can only be determined by the client and\n&gt;&gt; server (via a contex=\r\ntual, shared understanding about the resource in\n&gt;&gt; question) - whether tha=\r\nt shared understanding is buried within the\n&gt;&gt; semantics of a media type or=\r\n a preceding link relation does not change\n&gt;&gt; this.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I request a gene=\r\nric resource and get back a map of FORMs with RDFa, what\n&gt; more do I need?\n=\r\n&gt;\n\nThis should probably be in a separate thread, but I&#39;ll post it anyway.. =\r\n:)\n\nOne of the major issues I have with the RDF model is that it&#39;s\nobjectiv=\r\ne seems to be to make every resource a possible &#39;starting\npoint&#39; - i.e. it =\r\ntries to provide a model for &#39;bootstrapping&#39; a\nmachine client into a contex=\r\nt for any &#39;generic&#39; resource on the web.\nWe don&#39;t have this in REST, instea=\r\nd we have a limited set of entry\npoints and from then on discovery/traversa=\r\nl of an application at run\ntime. This means there&#39;s a tonne of features (re=\r\nad: bloat) and\nassumptions that are inherent to implementations like RDFa w=\r\nhich, from\na REST pov, are at best distracting and at worst actually corros=\r\nive to\nthe kinds of behaviours we are trying to invoke when designing RESTf=\r\nul\nhypertext applications.\n\nREST&#39;s perspective on semantics seems to be bas=\r\ned on a relational\ntheory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory) =\r\nwhereas RDF&#39;s\nperspective seems to be based on more of an absolute theory\n(=\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_theory). I believe this\ndifference  i=\r\ns at the root of the apparent schism between REST and RDF\nand I can&#39;t find =\r\na way to reconcile this, so I avoid RDF.\n\nI still wanted a generic media ty=\r\npe but without the RDF baggage, so\nthat&#39;s why I created HAL. Some other peo=\r\nple seem to prefer it too.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
