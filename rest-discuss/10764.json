Is there a\n&gt; RESTful way for a server to let a client fetching a multimedia\n&gt; resource to know that there is a metadata resource associated with it?\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s possible to use content negotiation for an aspect of the\n&gt; exchange. If the metadata and multimedia were considered different\n&gt; representations of the same resource, they could be distinguished by\n&gt; media type and fetched separately by using the Accept header.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does the client learn that this is an option, given that it starts\n&gt; with a single multimedia URI?\n&gt;\n&gt; If the method relies on request and response headers, how can an AJAX\n&gt; app view and control the headers?\n\n"}}
