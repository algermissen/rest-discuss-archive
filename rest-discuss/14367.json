I have implemented sev=\r\neral systems that function like this\nand it works quite well.\n\nOne rather n=\r\nice feature of this approach is that it reduces the\nassumptions about the d=\r\nisposition of the room and course resources.\nIt does not assume that room r=\r\nesources are implemented in the same\ncontainer as the lesson plans.  This f=\r\nrees you to make decisions in\nthe future that might more difficult if you r=\r\nelied on more application\nspecific.  For example, spinning off some of thes=\r\ne resources into a\nseparate system to allow that functionality to be expand=\r\ned on a\nseparate release cycle, would mean that the lessons resource would\n=\r\nneed to interact with a search resource in the new system every time\nthe le=\r\nsson was requested.  However, by using URIs you can avoid\ninteracting with =\r\nthe remote resource at all when you only need the\nidentification.\n\nPeter\nht=\r\ntp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
