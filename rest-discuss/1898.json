Currently\n&gt; it&#39;s Roger Costello&#39;s tutorial [1] (thanks Roger).\n&gt;\n&gt; On slide 12 [2], I read &quot;...allow the client to specify ... HTML ...\n&gt; or XML&quot; followed by the example URL with ?flavor=xml at the end.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not at all trying to find fault with the tutorial, but I was wondering\n&gt; this: Is it more (or less?) appropriate (in a REST context) for the client\n&gt; to use the HTTP Accept: header to declare what it wants (e.g. text/html or\n&gt; text/xml) rather than modifying the URI?\n\nFor a pure &#39;automatable Web&#39; application then it is much better to use the\nAccept header.\nIf you have to interoperate with browsers you may need to resort to these\nsorts of hacks - and if so, I&#39;d recommend using a naming convention that can\neasily point to the HTTP semantics. for example: ...?do:accept=text/xml\nwhere the &#39;do:&#39; part is equivalent to an HTTP header of the same name. I\nwould have used &#39;http:&#39; but that would have been really confusing...\n\nAll that said, I think the separation of resource and representation is the\npart of REST that almost all tools (servers, clients, etc.) have the most\nproblem with. Think of all the ASP, JSP, PHP, etc that have the content to\nbe output hardcoded right there in the file - not very easy to switch based\nupon the Accept header (unless you use internal server-side redirects).\n\nI think all of todays &#39;visual Web&#39; applications are doing fine at exposing\n/user interface/ with HTTP, but I have a sinking feeling that for an\n&#39;automatable Web&#39; we are going to need new server environments and new\nclients. The new clients aren&#39;t that hard, its re-using exising server\ntechnology that might be a problem. But maybe I&#39;m being pessimistic.\n\n\n\n"}}
