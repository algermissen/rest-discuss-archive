If you use a different method with a different resource\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ID, I doubt the cache can do it&#39;s thing.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But maybe not - caching is always more subtle than I think.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t one of the problems with caching is that caching behavior is\ndependent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; upon numerous independent implementations for which few if any shared\nthe\n&gt;&gt; &gt; exact same implementation criteria and thus many made independent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; engineering decisions?\n&gt;&gt; Not really. Any interaction between components is susceptible to\n&gt;&gt; independent implementations - which gives rise to the need for all of\n&gt;&gt; us to learn how to play well with each other.\n&gt;&gt; When the caching behavior is described by a protocol specification,\n&gt;&gt; then the &#39;independence&#39; of the implementations is reduced.\n&gt;&gt; The specifications in these cases usually was derived from the\n&gt;&gt; commonality of already working software, but as new software is built\n&gt;&gt; there is always a risk that it isn&#39;t interoperable.\n\nHehe. Tell that to my friend who runs /n software (www.nsoftware.com)! He&#39;s\nspent well over a decade listening to customers complain about his internet\nprotocol components not working in weird special cases only to end up fine\ntuning them for all the ever so subtle inconsistencies between server\nimplementations, even on protocols as common as SMTP and HTTP.  It&#39;s one\nreason why you want to get your internet protocol components from someone\nwho&#39;s been in the business for a long time. :-)\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
