If I have a URI that is labeling a\n&gt; resource to which I can POST data to be processed, it is not good\n&gt; practice to include a file extension in that URI, correct?  In other\n&gt; words, if I implement that resource using  ASP, JSP, ASP.NET, ..., I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to betray that implementation detail, right?  \n\nAs a matter of style, I agree. But the effort to hide it often outweighs\nthe stylistic concern. The root of the problem is that the Windows and\nUnix file systems determine file type by extension. So it takes extra\neffort to keep both the operating system and the web happy.\n\nI say it is &quot;only&quot; a matter of style because if push came to shove you\ncould swap your .aspx for a .jsp and with the right configuration\neverything should still work okay. You might have to do some web server\ntweaking, but your &quot;cool URI&quot; would &quot;not change&quot;. The thing that is\nuncool about it is that you betrayed your implementation technology in\nyour URI, which is a little bit like leaving wires hanging out of a\ncomputer case. Also, it could be a hint to hackers who want to exploit\nknown security holes in your implementation technology. Finally, I\nwouldn&#39;t be surprised if IE uses file extension as one of its hints\nabout file type even when the server has labelled the content-type.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
