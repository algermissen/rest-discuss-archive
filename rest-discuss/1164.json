WSDL exists, and is a necessary part of Web\nServices, because you don&#39;t know anything about an interface.  With\nREST, you start off with a lot of information.  It&#39;s not *all* the\ninformation everybody would ever need, but it&#39;s more than enough for\nmost.\n\n&gt;  Work on event models needs to get finished.  Maybe store and\n&gt; forward (the email workalike we discussed here a few months ago) needs to\n&gt; happen.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; SOAP-RPC already offers solutions to all of the above.  They&#39;re not as\n\nSOAP doesn&#39;t have an event model, or a store and forward model.  It has\nan intermediary model, just like HTTP, only better specified.\n\n&gt; good as HTTP solutions could be but at least they&#39;re out there.  Until the\n&gt; REST stack gets filled out to the same degree as the XML RPC stack, we are\n&gt; in ivory tower land.\n\nOh, please.  Without any further work, I can get a whole lot done with\nREST right now, between uncoordinated parties .  The same is not true\nfor SOAP/Web-services.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
