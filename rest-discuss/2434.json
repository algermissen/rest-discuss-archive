The characteristics of resources vary so greatly, that I \ndon&#39;t see that there would be any way to establish any kind of generic \nguarantee that would hold across all resources.  I&#39;m sure that for set \nof simple cases you might be able to guarantee some sort of byte-wise \nequivalence, but I don&#39;t see that happening across all types of resources.\n\nThird, I suspect that in many cases, when two URIs appear to name the \nsame resource, they actually don&#39;t.  For example, some people might \n(mistakenly) believe that the following URIs name the same resource\n        http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/\n        http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
