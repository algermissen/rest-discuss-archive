DELETE seems to work against the mapping of resource to\n&gt; &gt; representations, not against the mapping of identifier(s) to resources,\n&gt; &gt; as would be the case above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The linking and unlinking of identifiers to resources seems to be\n&gt; &gt; solely in the domain of the authority, not something exposed through\n&gt; &gt; the methods of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can you DELETE the representation-to-resource mapping and still have\nthe\n&gt; identifier-to-resource mapping exist?\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
