I&#39;ll try\n&gt;&gt;to restate it here as I understand it:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;A GET operation that immediately follows a PUT operation must return\n&gt;&gt;exactly the representation presented by the PUT,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Is some kind of equivalence implied?  If so, what is its specification?\n&gt;There\n&gt;are folks hotly debating, as we speak, how to do equiavalence on URI\n&gt;strings.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure I see the connection.  One is talking about comparing URI \nstrings, while the other is about the equivalence of representations \n(and then only indirectly)..\n\n&gt;&gt;_provided that the\n&gt;&gt;resource&#39;s state does not change between those two operations_.  Note\n&gt;&gt;that this statement is about the behavior of the server; it is not about\n&gt;&gt;behavior that an arbitraty client might be able to observe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Are you talking about nontransparent cache effects here?  If not, then\n&gt;I don&#39;t understand why you say that GET&#39;s behavior is not observable\n&gt;by clients.\n&gt;\n\nI probably overconstrained things by including the statment about what \nis observable by the client.  In retrospect, it seems kind of obvious \nthat if the resource&#39;s state doesnt change between requests, then the \nobserved behavior is the same at the server as well as at the client \nmaking the requests.  \n\n&gt;&gt;If I remember correctly, this whole thing is not really about what you\n&gt;&gt;GET after a PUT.  It is more about whether or not you can do content\n&gt;&gt;negotiation/have variants on a PUT.  As I understand it, Fielding says\n&gt;&gt;you can&#39;t because there&#39;s no mechanism (in HTTP) to indicate whether the\n&gt;&gt;contents of the PUT is a variant of the current representation or a\n&gt;&gt;replacement for the current representation.  I seem to remember that the\n&gt;&gt;conversation wrapped up with an understanding that, in general,\n&gt;&gt;resources that support PUT cannot support content negotiation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Let&#39;s look at a SQL analogy in which UPDATE is in the same role as\n&gt;HTTP PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   UPDATE ORDER SET ORDER_DATE = &#39;1/12/2003 09:00:00&#39; where KEY=&#39;1&#39;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1 row(s) updated\n&gt;\n&gt;Here I&#39;ve supplied a string representation of a date field, whose internal\n&gt;storage for whatever SQL engine I&#39;m using is irrelevant.  Now I&#39;ll retrieve\n&gt;the same info:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   SELECT ORDER_DATE from ORDER where KEY=&#39;1&#39;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jan 12, 2003 9:00 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;1 row(s)\n&gt;\n&gt;Semantically equivalent, but the format&#39;s been changed.  Happens all\n&gt;the time.  The UPDATE didn&#39;t store yet another variant, nor did it take\n&gt;my string and try to treat its bits as a long integer or something else.\n&gt;\n&gt;/walden\n&gt;\nI&#39;m too tired to get a fully formed thought right now, but it seems to \nme that the difference here is that the various date formats are part of \nthe sql specification whereas they are not in HTTP.  And because they \nare not, you cant have a uniform interface when some resources \nunderstand the semantic equivalence and others do not (or interpret it \ndifferently).\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
