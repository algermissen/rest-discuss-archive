For most use cases there just \nisn&#39;t enough benefit to sending only the diffs to justify a new verb. \nThat&#39;s more true as time passes and bandwidth expands. Plus it handily \navoids the question of defining the diff format and patch algorithm.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
