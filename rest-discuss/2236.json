It&#39;s not the case that these are the\n&gt; same people, or that folks in either of the latter two camps even have\n&gt; shell access to the machines that the apps run on, much less the ability\n&gt; to muck with various configuration files.  If the Apache guys wanted to\n&gt; see HTTP authentication used for more than just small-scale Intranet /\n&gt; group use, they should create a generic and standard authentication\n&gt; framework into which arbitrary authentication schemes could be\n&gt; plugged --- and no, I&#39;m not talking about PAM-like stuff that\n&gt; authenticates against the typical system / user DBs, I&#39;m talking about\n&gt; an API into which any app developer could plug an arbitrary module to\n&gt; authenticate against e.g. the application&#39;s own user DB.  (It might be\n&gt; there already, but if it is I haven&#39;t found it. ;-)  Bottom line, HTTP\n&gt; authentication doesn&#39;t get used on the larger scales because the guys\n&gt; building the apps don&#39;t own the config, the guys that own the config\n&gt; aren&#39;t in the business of user management for a given app, and never the\n&gt; twain shall meet (today.)\n\nI can&#39;t express how much I agree, but I can try. One of the banes of my\nexistence is the poor support for metadata in Web servers; not just\nauthentication, but HTTP headers, status codes, etc. in general. It&#39;s\nabsurd that if I want to generate a redirect, I have to go and modify the\nserver configuration; no wonder so many people use HTML refresh! Same with\ncaching headers, etc.\n\nThis is not a trivial problem, doubly so if it needs to be standardized\nacross servers. We can try, however (and I&#39;ll glady lend my hand if\nsomeone&#39;s interested in starting...)\n\n\n&gt; But\n&gt; identifying a sequence of HTTP &quot;transactions&quot; as related by grouping\n&gt; them in a session is not by itself a killer for REST.\n\nI generally agree, but it&#39;s very easy for developers to over-rely on\nsessions.\n\n\n\n"}}
