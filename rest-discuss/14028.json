Please, put it here. And it will try to create =\r\nthe resource or replace it if it already exists.\n\nNow, the POST is to send =\r\nsomething to a particular resource. The resource knows what to do with the =\r\npayload. For instance, if you post some text to a blog, then the blog resou=\r\nrce may add your text as a blog post.\n\nIn this particular case, POST is the=\r\n best option. Search may be one or even several resources, to which you pos=\r\nt a query document. The search resource may create a new result resource yo=\r\nu can then get. The search may be so intelligent, that if the query paramet=\r\ners yield an already created resource, then it will create a new one but re=\r\nturn the one already there. \n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam MArtinez.\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, Sergio Bossa &lt;sergio.bossa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I have to model a REST API supporting complex search operations: that\n&gt; i=\r\ns, I have to submit a kind of query document, and get back a response\n&gt; con=\r\ntaining the query result.\n&gt; I was thinking of PUTting the query document (s=\r\nay to /documents/query)\n&gt; and reading back the result response.\n&gt; Is it a p=\r\nroper choice to use PUT for executing a query operation?\n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sergio B.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Sergio Bossa\n&gt; So=\r\nftware Passionate and Open Source Enthusiast.\n&gt; URL: http://www.linkedin.co=\r\nm/in/sergiob\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
