As Mark pointed out, server-side carts share a fundamental\nviolation of statelessness, not shared by client-side approaches.  At\nsome point, a transaction is occurring on the basis of a link, rather\nthan transferring a representation which details the contract itself.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no reason that a shopping cart cannot be treated and modeled\n&gt; as any other kind of server-persisted resource state. The fact that\n&gt; it is possible to model this in another way in which it is treated as\n&gt; client-side application state does not negate that.\n&gt;\n\nTrue, a client-side cart may also be persisted on the server, i.e.\n&quot;save cart&quot; or &quot;wish list&quot; or silently backing up the active cart -- by\ntransferring a representation (the Model, in MVC terms) which captures\nthe state of the user application, instead of passing around nebulous\nlinks to server-persisted state.\n\nThe problem from a design perspective, is choosing a starting point\nwhich fails to treat the cart itself as the basis for transactions;\ntransferring links to the contract instead of the contract itself is\nnot a RESTful approach allowing &quot;the forces that influence system\nbehavior to flow naturally, in harmony with the system&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The approach you chose is down to the context in which you are\n&gt; designing the application and one&#39;s subjective opinion. It is nothing\n&gt; to do with violation of constraints. Both approaches can be taken\n&gt; within the constraints of REST and - practically speaking - the\n&gt; capability of HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nOne approach meets the goals of REST more than the other; if the other\neven meets all REST&#39;s constraints, which is problematic.  I much prefer\nexamples which obviously meet REST&#39;s constraints, over those which need\nto be &quot;qualified&quot; with convoluted explanations of why some constraint\nisn&#39;t being violated when the entire approach is suspect.\n\nSeems easier to learn REST from examples which everyone can agree are\nnot violating any constraints, rather than those which require the use\nof imagination to get around the apparent mismatches.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some fairly good reasons to go with this design: e.g.\n&gt; customers are then able to fill a cart from several different devices\n&gt; before checking out (fairly common behaviour), and it significantly\n&gt; improves the vendor&#39;s ability to collect, mine and analyse data on\n&gt; user behaviour around their shopping cart (vendors usually care about\n&gt; this a lot).\n&gt; \n\nWhy isn&#39;t a client-side cart compatible with said usage patterns?  I\nsmell a strawman.  Discussions about vendors&#39; desire for metrics vs.\nusers&#39; desire for privacy, have no bearing on the RESTfulness of any\ngiven example.  This list is about learning REST, not disregarding part\nof it for the sake of usability/metrics while still attempting to\nmaintain buzzword compliance as a fig leaf.\n\nAs it is, any device can GET a representation of the user&#39;s last\napplication state, to continue the &quot;session&quot; without violating the\nparadigm Mark keeps pointing out -- sending an URL for processing isn&#39;t\nthe same as sending a representation of the actual cart for processing.\n\nThe client-side approach bases communication on sending/receiving a\nhypertext representation *of* a shopping cart -- THIS is the essence of\nREST, not pretending that sending an URL for processing is somehow\nstateless.  Such a message may itself be, but the point is a stateless\ninteraction overall -- requiring the cart itself to be transferred,\ninstead of linked to.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; You may not agree with those, but that does not mean the approach is\n&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;ignorant of constraints&quot; in relation to REST. This thread\n&gt; is supposed to be about the meaning of &quot;stateless&quot;, not a discussion\n&gt; on the merits of various approaches to application design.\n&gt; \n\nThis is a discussion about statelessness, with my point being that it\nwould be more helpful to use examples which actually are.  It&#39;s hard to\nexplain the constraint using examples which arguably violate it.  Since\nwe&#39;re here to learn about REST, perhaps it&#39;s time we examined _WHY_ Roy\nhints at client-side implementation, instead of pretending it&#39;s somehow\nirrelevant to the discussion &quot;because pragmatism&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s easy for me to remain analytical on this issue, as I&#39;ve never laid\nmy REST credibility on the line by selling someone a server-side cart\nimplementation as &quot;RESTful&quot; or presenting examples of same in an effort\nto explain REST.  I can see where others have the motivation to insist\nthat their way is &quot;right&quot; while attempting to stifle debate about what\nthe thesis actually says, by declaring it an off-topic implementation\ndetail.\n\nMy nutshell explanation of REST from 50,000ft is that a system designed\nto manipulate shopping carts MUST be based on transferring actual\nrepresentations of shopping-cart contents.  Once we&#39;re working in the\nproper idiom, the constraints take care of themselves as we&#39;re not doing\nanything which inherently fights against them, thus requiring convoluted\nexplanations to support a fundamentally different approach as RESTful.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
