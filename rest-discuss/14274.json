No matter how many media types you  \n&gt; =\r\nput in there, the set of types is based on the assumption that one of  \n&gt; t=\r\nhese will be available. \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Again: I am not suggesting a strict contr=\r\nact is needed, I am trying to  \n&gt; make explicit the amount of coupling that=\r\n is really going on, so  \n&gt; people can make informed decisions.\n\nMaybe what=\r\n is needed is a explicit formalization of what coupling you can expect from=\r\n a RESTful system? Maybe it&#39;s there already somewhere in Roy Fieldings thes=\r\nis? I don&#39;t know, I havent read it. Maybe there is room for a new thesis :-=\r\n)\n\n&gt; But &quot;it is common sense for the service not to evolve incompatibly&quot; \n&gt;=\r\n just does not work inside the enterprise. There, people need \n&gt; to be spec=\r\nific about the kind of constract that is at \n&gt; work (even if the contract i=\r\ns deliberately very loose!)\n\nI have this feeling that maybe enterprise inte=\r\nrgration is not RESTful in itself? I am no so sure that a bank wants to use=\r\n an &quot;independently evolving&quot; service - it kind of contradicts eveything in =\r\nthe banking sector. You want it to be 100% reliable. You want your system t=\r\no be 100% stable - new features are considered bad unless proved otherwise.=\r\n In such a scenario I really can&#39;t see anyone being happy with an evolving =\r\nservice. If &quot;evolving&quot; is mandatory for a RESTful system, well, then enterp=\r\nrise integration cannot be RESTful.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
