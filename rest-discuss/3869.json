Its tragic flaw is \n&gt; that\n&gt; it did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface to\n&gt; achieve the value it promised.  To be perfectly clear about the \n&gt; problem:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server maps the state \n&gt; of a\n&gt; resource into a response to a GET request, a client can have \n&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO\n&gt; IDEA what the content of that response means; it is simply has bits \n&gt; that\n&gt; can mean anything at all.\n\nWhat does &quot;mean&quot; mean in this context?\n\n&gt; * Without an *explicit* model of exactly how the server uses \n&gt; PUT/POST-ed\n&gt; content to change the state of a resource, a client can have \n&gt; ABSOLUTELY NO\n&gt; IDEA what the effect of a PUT or POST actually will be.\n\nThat just says that REST doesn&#39;t mandate one single model.  Nothing\nprevents the server from establishing a model and telling the client\nwhat it is.  That is how hypertext works: the engine of application\nstate change.\n\n&gt; Roy thinks these explicit models should be entirely arbitrary and \n&gt; specified\n&gt; at the whim of the server operator on a per-URI basis.  I think these\n&gt; models should be standardized in some manner and be URI independent.\n\nThey aren&#39;t entirely arbitrary; they are merely chosen by the server.\nIn some cases they will be selected from a standard (such as webdav).\nIn other cases they will be defined by an interface language (like \nWSDL).\n\n&gt; Because Roy&#39;s resources are so abstract, access to them has to be \n&gt; mediated\n&gt; by agents of arbitrary power and complexity.\n\nAh, so httpd modules must be gods.\n\n&gt; Allowing clients to interact\n&gt; with agents of this power and complexity through HTTP then requires \n&gt; that\n&gt; service operators be permitted to overload HTTP methods to have \n&gt; essentially\n&gt; arbitrary meanings.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t follow at all.  Service operators control the \nimplementation\nof HTTP methods.  Methods get overloaded because service operators do \nwant\nadditional semantics, but normal people don&#39;t know how to extend them \nand\nimplementers can&#39;t read protocol specs.  It is an artifact of the social\nprocess surrounding standardized protocols.  You can&#39;t fix it by\nforbidding the extension of methods.\n\n&gt; But resources don&#39;t really need to be so abstract and the meanings of \n&gt; HTTP\n&gt; methods don&#39;t need to be so loose.  Programs don&#39;t actually manipulate\n&gt; &quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;non-virtual objects;&quot; they just manipulate bits.\n\nRight.  It&#39;s people that manipulate concepts and non-virtual objects.\n\n&gt;   It would\n&gt; be more realistic to say that an HTTP resource is simply a set of bits\n&gt; whose syntactic structure is enforced by an HTTP server and whose \n&gt; meaning\n&gt; is determined entirely by agents which interact with this server.\n\nNo it wouldn&#39;t, since such a definition ignores the ability of people\nto anticipate changes that have not yet occurred.  Time is essential\nto the meaning of a hypertext link, and thus the definition of resource.\nHTTP servers store representations, not resources.\n\n&gt;   To say\n&gt; otherwise is to say that there is a meaningful difference in effect \n&gt; between\n&gt; having an agent poll a resource and act when it changes and having a \n&gt; server\n&gt; notify an agent to act whenever a resource is changed or to say that \n&gt; there\n&gt; is a meaningful difference between such an agent residing on the HTTP\n&gt; server itself and such an agent residing on another machine across the\n&gt; Internet and interacting via HTTP.\n\nOr simply that resource isn&#39;t what you think it means.\n\n&gt; Viewed this way, it makes no sense to talk about some single *special*\n&gt; hidden representation to which a single special HTTP server agent \n&gt; mediates\n&gt; access.  Instead we should recognize that agents on the server and \n&gt; across\n&gt; the Internet can use any data structures they want for their \n&gt; activities but\n&gt; that their doing so is really beside the point.  The function of an \n&gt; HTTP\n&gt; server as such is simply to provide a shared blackboard for \n&gt; communication\n&gt; between these agents.  What these agents really need is a shared \n&gt; *explicit\n&gt; model* for determining what is on this blackboard and for how it may be\n&gt; changed.\n\nThe blackboard model is another architectural style with a lot of\ninteresting work associated with it.  Tuple-spaces use that.  The\nproblem with blackboards isn&#39;t just a lack of a data model;\nthey also have centralized identification and lack metadata.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
