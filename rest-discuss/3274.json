My API is\nquite the same, but the server part is yet very simple (just a dump of a\nMySQL DB in PHP). I&#39;m more actively working on a wxPython client.\nAs i build a full hierarchical tree in a left panel  (explorer-like) i&#39;ve\ndecided to transmit all the hierarchical xbel file to minimize connexions. I\ntry to keep service root URI and the kind of parameters parameters\n(bookmarks?folder=123 or bookmarks/folders/123 or bookmarks/123; as my\nserver is simply a php prototype, I use query parameters) flexibles in a\nconfig file,  to be compliant with any implementation, but the client\n(human) has to do the job. I&#39;d like to create a serverside configfile (rddl,\nwsl ???) to make it easier.\n\nAny comments ?\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;jeffreywinter@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 20, 2003 8:51 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] RFC: A REST API for XBEL (& RSS?)\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working on a project to create a REST API for working\n&gt; with the XBEL schema. The XBEL schema is nominally for use with\n&gt; bookmarks but it has a fairly generic hierarchical representation\n&gt; that could be used with for other applications, such as weblog\n&gt; organization and tranformation to RSS. It&#39;s at the point where\n&gt; it can be looked at and commented on. I would welcome any\n&gt; feedback that people have.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried to follow my understanding of REST as closely as\n&gt; possible, so any comments with regards to the interface itself\n&gt; would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m giving it the name &quot;Rebel&quot; for, a RE(ST API for X)BEL, not\n&gt; because there&#39;s anything particularly rebellious about it, but\n&gt; because I couldn&#39;t think of anything else that sounded better.\n&gt; It&#39;s currently implemented in Java as a Servlet.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think there are interesting things that can be done with the\n&gt; information when it is stored in this way, beyond simply storing\n&gt; and managing bookmarks.\n&gt;\n&gt; The details are here: http://www.xefer.com/rebel\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
