Coming soon, is blogroll.xbel as application/xbel+xml.\n&gt;\n\nDone.  Unfortunately, there are two critical problems with XBEL:  it\nlacks both an XML namespace and a media type identifier.  Namespaces\nare a concern external to REST.  So, I made one up.  The fact that I&#39;m\nusing the unregistered application/xbel+xml on the public Web, means\nthat I&#39;m violating REST&#39;s self-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\nXBEL is a ubiquitous media type on the Web.  Many browsers support it\nas their native bookmark format, and many desktop apps and Web services\nexist which use XBEL as an intermediary format to exchange bookmarks\nbetween browsers that don&#39;t implement it.  Drupal implements XBEL for\nblogrolls, just as I have (differently, though).  I added XBEL and XFN\nto my WordPress plugin, to give WP these capabilities.\n\nThe problem is, that without its own media type identifier, all this\nXBEL is being passed around as text/xml or application/xml.  The only\nthing those generic media types say about linking, is to look for Xlink\nor rdf:about, neither of which are relevant to XBEL.  A specific media\ntype identifier would make it explicit that //bookmark/@href contains\nURIs, along with the notion that the media type is a hierarchical\ncollection of URIs (rather than being some random XML with a DTD).\n\nSo, until XBEL has a registered media type identifier (I&#39;ll get right\non it), none of the ubiquitous use of the media type is RESTful, and\nneither is that aspect of my demo system.  Which doesn&#39;t make it the\nwrong choice of media type, nor suggest to me that I shouldn&#39;t go ahead\nand call it application/xbel+xml.\n\nPragmatism and REST can co-exist.  The need to standardize application/\nxbel+xml is obvious, so I&#39;m not worried that it won&#39;t ever happen, so I\nneed change nothing for my system to evolve towards REST in this regard.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
