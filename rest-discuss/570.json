I&#39;m suggesting\n&gt; that a POST to the Subscriber: URI has as its appropriate (and only) interpretation\n&gt; that the Subscribed-URI has changed.  (Applications might further describe *how* it\n&gt; has changed via headers or body, but IMO that&#39;s app-specific and should be\n&gt; out-of-scope for our purposes.)  What other interpretation of POST could there be?\n&gt; And why allow any other method to have those semantics?\n\nMy argument in my last mail on this issue is that\nPOST to the subscriber URL may be an update to the\nlistener e.g. you may want to tell the listener to\nlog notifications to a different file or you know\nwant it to page a user when it recieves\nnotification.\n\nSee my last message for all scenarios.\nI argue that therefore either you need a new\nmethod or you need to pass something in the\nheader/body saying the POST is a notification.\n\nPaul argues that listener management should\nhappend at a different URL from notification.\n\nI don&#39;t think that makes sense.  You can only\nnotify a listener if it exists.  The most\nobvious way to create a listener at a URL is to\nPUT a listener there.  The alternative is some\nform of RPC with some listener manager which is\nugly.\n\nI suspec Paul is concerned with the example in (1)\ndescribing why CVSSTAT is bad.  The difference is\nthat NOTIFY is not idempotent so this argument\ndoesn&#39;t apply.\n\n-Alex-\n\n(1) http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
