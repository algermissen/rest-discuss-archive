Fielding&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; This topic has come up a few times on webdav and http-wg lists.\n&gt; The transaction is a resource, but the relationship between it and\n&gt; the requested resource can be accomplished via a header field that\n&gt; defines each request as a sequenced resource within a hierarchical\n&gt; transaction.  In other words, ask the server for a transaction \nbegin,\n&gt; send the URI it gives the client in each request as a header field\n&gt; with a request number appended to it, and finally abort or commit\n&gt; the transaction as a final request to the transaction&#39;s URI.  That&#39;s\n&gt; basically how I did it for the still-vapor waka protocol.\n\nI like very much the transaction as a resource, and the outcome \nprotocol as requests to the transaction&#39;s URI, but am having a little \ntrouble imagining the rest of your idea.\n\nHave you written any examples anywhere for how this would work?\n\nFor example, an order (or any other kind of contract) will involve \nseveral transactions:  some to come to agreement on commitments, \nothers to come to agreement that the commitments were fulfilled, \nmaybe still others to settle claims and resolve disputes.\n\nI&#39;d like to see the order as a resource, with each transaction \ninvolving the order as a resource linked to the order resource, and \neach message in each transaction as a resource linked to the \ntransaction, for an audit trail.\n\nI&#39;m trying to imagine how all that would work with your scheme, and \nwill post my attempt soon, but would like tips first if I can get \nthem.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
