That&#39;s what happens when you PUT.  But luckily this is\n&gt; already accounted for in HTTP, since the Content-Location header\n&gt; provides a means to identify representations as resources.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I buy that.  It seems to me that PUT identifies a resource by\nURI and provides a representation in the request body, and that\nrepresentation isn&#39;t actually a resource until the resource *at* the\nindicated URI sets its state.\n\nAnother way to put it:  the only things that live at origin servers are\nresources.  Everything else --- cached, in transit, etc. --- is a\nrepresentation.\n\n&gt; They are each just things with identity.\n\nYes, but they don&#39;t have unique identities --- we use the same URI to talk\nabout both in different contexts.  The only way these are disambiguated is\nby a blend of the semantics of the particular HTTP method we&#39;re using and\nthe semantics of various HTTP headers in combination.\n\n&gt; Another way to think about this, is that there&#39;s a difference between\n&gt; &quot;the resource&quot; (say, me), my representations (picture, HTML page,\n&gt; vCard), and the software that manages all of that.  AFAIK, there&#39;s no\n&gt; name for the software.  But I think you may be confusing the resource\n&gt; with that software, by your suggestion that GET doesn&#39;t operate on\n&gt; the resource.\n\nOkay, well, it&#39;s tough to talk about the software entity itself if it&#39;s\nnot named. ;-)  Yes, I&#39;m referring to that as the resource, with full\nunderstanding that the resource *stands for something.*\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
