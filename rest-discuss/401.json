Check it out. :-)\n\nI know.  I did.  I just think calling it a &quot;file&quot;\ninterface is a misnomer.  One could also argue\nthat it is closer to Linda...\n\n&gt; &gt; The big thing that I don&#39;t like about most file\n&gt; &gt; APIs is that they are synchronous stopping your\n&gt; &gt; process while hardware catches up.  It is\n&gt; &gt; semantically more elegant to represent all\n&gt; &gt; IO using asynch interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey, you aren&#39;t arguing with me, you&#39;re arguing with Dennis Ritchie, Dave Presotta, Rob\n&gt; Pike, Ken Trickey, etc.  If you feel up to that, that&#39;s your call.\n\nI&#39;m not actually arguing with what they did at the\ntime.  I asked Reiser about this issue and he\nlargely agreed, but said it was too late to\nchange.\n\nCallbacks allow the OS better to optimize writes\nand do interesting caching.\n\nThink about all the annoying issues with\napplications that expect a local filesystem and\nrun into issues because NFS is much less reliable.\n\nSee Gosling on network transparency.\nAlso see the design of O&#39;Haskell\n  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ohaskell\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
