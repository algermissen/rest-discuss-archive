None of this stuff from the physical world\n&gt; carries over very well, I&#39;m afraid.\n\nThere are two types of Architecture in the real world of buildings:\n\n   1) the artistic shells that a bunch of critics talk about as yet\n      another way of demonstrating their linguistic flexibility\n      without actually having a clue about buildings;\n\n   2) the design for construction of a building in order to fit its\n      long-term purpose while occasionally transcending it in other\n      dimensions.\n\nAmongst actual successful architects (not the critics who write about\nthem), styles are an important organizing method based (usually) on\nthe materials available in a given location.  Those styles are all\nover the place.  Most people, however, only know about the monumental\nstyles (the outlandish ones used to construct churches, temples, and\ncivic structures that are meant to be more visually imposing than\ntruly functional).\n\nOnly one in a million architects reach the stage of a Gehry, who\ncan devote his focus entirely on his artistic style (while his\ncrowd of apprentices try to make the building work).\n\nREST, as styles go, is more like the architecture of barnyards and\noffice suites.  The notion that there is anything lo or hi about it\ndemonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding -- it&#39;s like saying\n\n   &quot;That is a good barn, and I soooo like how the 3ft-wide main door\n   is slimming and artistic.&quot;\n\nThere is no gray area when a constraint is violated, even if the\npain is not immediately apparent.  The purpose of the architectural\nstyle is to let us know what fits, and what doesn&#39;t, before we try\nto lead a horse through the door.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
