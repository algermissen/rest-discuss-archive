This name for  Web Services based on REST\n: principles is long overdue.\n:\n: People need names to hang their ideas on and this name is as good as any.\n: The reason someone else has coined it is because we failed to come up with\n: a suitable\n: one ourselves. There have been some attempts but none have conjured the\n: right image\n: in the mind the way this one does.\n:\n: ... Kind of like Service Oriented Architecture but closer to the Web.\n:\n: We (on the rest-discuss list) are quick to point out that REST is not an\n: alternative\n: to SOAP, it is an underlying architectural style. A model upon which HTTP\n: 1.1 was based.\n: This means nothing to most IT people.\n:\n: In the 3 years I have been subscribed to the rest-discuss list I have only\n: experienced one other\n: IT professional mentioning REST. REST is not as well known as some\n: evangelists think it is.\n:\n: When you say &quot;SOA&quot; people automatically think SOAP, RMI. They think of the\n: frameworks and\n: styles that grew out of CORBA and RPC. Applications based on the \nprinciples\n: of REST are\n: fundamentally different from these. There needs to be a discriminator that\n: identifies that\n: subset of SOA applications that conform to REST.\n:\n: As an example of how powerful a name can be, apparently there have been\n: frameworks around\n: for years that allow you to write rich clients in a web browser but I \nnever\n: heard of them until\n: someone said &quot;AJAX&quot;.\n:\n: Regards\n: Donald.\n:\n:\n: National Australia Bank Ltd - ABN 12 004 044 937\n: This email may contain confidential information.
