HTTP is the  same for both client and sender because they both see the same things on the  wire.  An API could be dramatically different based upon the needs of  clients vs services, and what kind of infrastructure is available  for use.  I&#39;m not saying JSR 311 should have separate APIs for  client/server, just pointing out that there are scenarios where it is  desirable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Dave\n\nAt the same time, on the assumption that servers often talk to remote\nsystems, having the ability to chain stuff across the connection is\nkind of useful. In particular\n -a way to marshall failures without losing useful diagnostics can be handy\n -if the client is built around futures, state machines or some\nalternative to blocking RPC/RMI as a metaphor, then you&#39;d like it\nsomehow to integrate well with the server.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
