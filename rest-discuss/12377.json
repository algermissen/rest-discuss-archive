So you h=\r\nave to just &quot;point&quot; to\nit.  Actually, I suppose you might very well use POS=\r\nT to add the\n&quot;pointer&quot; resource (which will probably be an atom entry with =\r\nthe\ncontent@src the URL for /document/foo) to your collection. It gets a\nbi=\r\nt recursive in activity feeds:   &quot;Joe agreed with the thumbs up that\nSally =\r\ngave to John&#39;s review of the last episode of &#39;Life on Mars&#39;&quot;\nEach of those =\r\n&quot;activities&quot;  being represented by an entry in an\nactivity feed.\n\n--peter\n\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, create an XML DB cell at /document/bar containing some XQuery code=\r\n\n&gt; that accesses the remote document and transforms it to Atom, sans\n&gt; cate=\r\ngory tags, which are under my site&#39;s control. =C2=A0I can&#39;t edit the\n&gt; remo=\r\nte data, but I can manipulate its metadata as if it were part of my\n&gt; mashu=\r\np site, give it a local comment thread, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if I&#39;m making a POST =\r\nto retrieve remote data, that&#39;s opaque to the\n&gt; client making the GET reque=\r\nst on my site, so my API is still REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Your approach (stored searc=\r\nh for documents w/ a particular category)\n&gt;&gt; gets at something I&#39;ve often s=\r\naid, which it that we need a good\n&gt;&gt; standard query mechanism for doing que=\r\nries with &quot;filter by category&quot;\n&gt;&gt; or some such. =C2=A0I actually like what =\r\nGoogle Base specifies in this\n&gt;&gt; area. =C2=A0(I know that opensearch is ano=\r\nther effort in this area).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking at OpenSearch, but have=\r\nn&#39;t integrated it yet. =C2=A0Seems\n&gt; to make sense for adding to archive fe=\r\neds, as if they were searches for\n&gt; &quot;every post in a given month&quot; etc. =C2=\r\n=A0Just add a few elements to my\n&gt; existing Atom output, looks like...\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n-Eric\n&gt;\n\n"}}
