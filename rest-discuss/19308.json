Does anyone\n&gt;&gt; have any advice on how best to manage that tension?\n&gt;\n&gt; maybe i am misreading what you&#39;re saying, but i don&#39;t really see a \n&gt; tension in the sense of a conflict, more a design trade-off. \n&gt; prefetching is on the implementation level (it seems)\n\nWell, yes and no. I was specifically thinking of a server-side prefetch, \nwhere a single request returns multiple resources (rather than a client \nintelligently pulling more than it needs). That&#39;s a difference in \ninterface, not just implementation.\n\n&gt; , and you would prefetch something based on the assumption that a \n&gt; request to a linked resource would be received soon, right? the tricky \n&gt; part probably is to avoid making prefetching stateful, assuming that \n&gt; the request for the related resource will be processed by the same \n&gt; server (if you have more than one). so if you make prefetching \n&gt; stateful, you run the risk of making it unlikely to actually provide \n&gt; you the benefit it can provide in a more stateful setting. so i guess \n&gt; in the end my answer would be: don&#39;t start implementing stateful \n&gt; patterns based on perceived performance benefits that rely on your \n&gt; service behaving in a stateful way.\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; dret.\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
