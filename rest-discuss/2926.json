I haven&#39;t well understood the answer, which was a\nlink\n&gt; to the wikki FAQ.\nI&#39;d like to see some more discussion comparing features of Jabber with\naspects of REST also.\n\n&gt; Here are my thoughts about jabber (mainly from &quot;Programming\n&gt; Jabber&quot; Ed. O&#39;Reilly) and /reasons/ why it cool be suitable for rest.\n\n&gt; - Jabber is resources oriented: you can specify a resources for any\n&gt; kind of &quot;things&quot; in the jabber world. For &quot;human users&quot;, it could be the\n&gt; client on desktop at work, the client on laptop, the bot logging\nconference\n&gt; rooms, and so on. For a server agent, it could be any thing you want, e.g.\na\n&gt; channel feeding rss, a room for conference transport, etc.\nCan you access all of those &#39;things&#39; with common operations?\nIs it possible to write a Jabber Spider that cruises all the information and\nlearns something about each?\n\n&gt; - Jabber is full XML, in the protocol, the communications and the\n&gt; data. Even the storage is XML (it could be also a DB or an other kind of\n&gt; persistence system).\nIf Jabber is a protocol, what does it need to define storage for? Maybe\ncertain apps on top of Jabber use XML storage?\n\n&gt; Moreover, it rely on name spaces. Therefore it is fully extensible.\nNot necessarily. Namespaces provide one kind of capability, but there are a\nlot of really smart people that think namespaces don&#39;t do anything to solve\nother integration and extensibility problems. (Don&#39;t have links handy right\nnow...)\n\n&gt; - Resource management is based on few methods, such as &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot;\n\n&gt; - All resources are &quot;browsable&quot;, that is you can &quot;query&quot; a resource to\n&gt; know some kind of metadata about it. For a service for example, it return\nthe\n&gt; fields to fill to subscribe. It could be parameters required to submit a\n&gt; query, or whatever. In many clients, forms are dynamically built according\nto\n&gt; this feature.\n\n&gt; - The connection can be server initiated (i.e. push) which can&#39;t be\n&gt; done with http. This can be useful in many context, specially in\nasynchronous\n&gt; systems.\nHow does a server initiate a connection to a node that is behind a firewall?\nWhatever is used can also be used to initiate a connection that then\ntransitions to plain HTTP with the firewalled node becoming the logical\n&#39;server&#39;.\n\n\n&gt; - Use management and subscription (and authentication) is built-in.\nWhat kind of user management is built-in? I&#39;ll look for this...\n\n&gt; Authentication is included in HTTP, but the subscription stage left to the\n&gt; implementation.\n\n&gt; - As in http, communication can be secured with ssl\n\n&gt; Reading jabber stuff, I thought about other suitable things, but i can&#39;t\n&gt; remember them right now.\n&gt; It seems to me that all HTTP feature can be managed with jabber, but with\n&gt; other built-in cool added possibilities.\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Another approach... Does anyone here has implemented (or tested, or at\nleast\n&gt; thought about) a rest architecture above Gnutella?\nNot that I know of, but it sure sounds interesting.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently learned that Gnutella is actually extended Http.\nInteresting. I wonder how much is extended according to &#39;extension&#39;\nspecifications - and how much of the &#39;extensions&#39; were actually necessary\n(often people don&#39;t think HTTP can do some things and so assume they need to\ninvent a new way of doing it.)\n\n&gt; It could solve the &quot;push&quot; problem, and other aspect that I wanted delegate\nto Jabber :)\nIt won&#39;t solve the push problem. The &#39;push&#39; problem can be solved with any\nTCP/IP protocol by having the server initiate a persistent connection to a\nrouting/dispatching proxy. That is basically how many systems do it. Nobody\nhas yet shipped a reference implementation that is as &#39;pure http&#39; as\npossible yet. But that might change soon.\n\n&gt; I know that HTTP is one of the foundations of Rest, but take the time to\nthink\n&gt; about these ideas. I hope I&#39;m not too presumptuous, and I certainly miss\n&gt; something. So please explain...  :)\nKeep up the good questions.\n\n"}}
