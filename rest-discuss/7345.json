For instance, consider\n&gt; &gt; PATCH and COPY/MOVE...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From the RTF Dissertation:\n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; =====\n&gt; Connectors\n&gt; REST uses various connector types to encapsulate the\n&gt; activities of accessing resources and transferring resource\n&gt; representations. The connectors present an abstract interface\n&gt; for component communication, enhancing simplicity by\n&gt; providing a clean separation of concerns and hiding the\n&gt; underlying implementation of resources and communication\n&gt; mechanisms. The generality of the interface also enables\n&gt; substitutability: if the users&#39; only access to the system is via\n&gt; an abstract interface, the implementation can be replaced\n&gt; without impacting the users. Since a connector manages\n&gt; network communication for a component, information can\n&gt; be shared across multiple interactions in order to improve\n&gt; efficiency and responsiveness.\n&gt; ======\n&gt;\n&gt; My view is that the &#39;generality of the interface&#39; is decreased when\n&gt; additional verbs are used.\n\nI disagree.  The generality refers to all resources having the same\ninterface, not all resources having an artificially limited interface.\nIt isn&#39;t even necessary for all resources to support the same set of\nmethods -- only that, when supported, they mean the same thing to all\nresources.\n\nPATCH was in my original HTTP/1.1 proposal and, assuming it is\nimplemented the way I described, is just as RESTful as PUT.\n\nThe limiting factor of only a few methods is a side-effect of the\narchitectural constraint.  Given that all methods have to mean the\nsame thing to all resources, there are a very limited number of\nsemantics that can usefully fit within a method.\n\n&gt; Another concern is that if there are several different approaches  \n&gt; for any\n&gt; given task, an application has to deal with each of the approaches  \n&gt; and this\n&gt; can be costly. If a particular verb could be re-phrased in terms of  \n&gt; other\n&gt; verbs, then those other verbs are more &#39;primitive&#39;. With only a few\n&gt; &#39;primitive&#39; ways of doing many things there is less need to adapt  \n&gt; to many\n&gt; different approaches - a cheaper way to conduct business.\n&gt; For example, it&#39;s hard to argue that DELETE could be rephrased as  \n&gt; GET and\n&gt; vice-versa. It&#39;s easier to argue that PATCH could be rephrased as a  \n&gt; PUT or\n&gt; POST to a related &#39;metadata&#39; resource.\n\nSo can DELETE.  PATCH has very specific semantics and a very specific\ngoal of reducing bits on updates.  It is a separate method because it\nneeds access to the same (generic) conditional mechanisms as PUT and\nbecause POST (when applied to an authorable resource) means append.\n\nMOVE and COPY are namespace operations.  The problem with the\nWebDAV definitions are that they target the wrong resource and then\nstick another URI in an arbitrary header field.  That is due to trying\nto squeeze a multitarget operation into a protocol (HTTP) that simply\nwasn&#39;t designed for multiple targets.  The target should be the\ncollection that is being changed.  This is an architecture detail,\nnot a question of architectural style.\n\nREPORT, on the other hand, is just plain evil.  It is bad architecture,\nviolates REST, avoids giving a URI to important resources, and tunnels\narbitrary methods through HTTP.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
