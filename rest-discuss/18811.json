We =\r\ncould have a conversation about what &#39;self&#39; means (a restatement of GET?), =\r\nbut let&#39;s park that for a moment.\n\nThen latterly in the Spec there&#39;s this, =\r\nwhich informs us that the member entry in a feed may not be complete. \n\n&quot;Cl=\r\nients MUST NOT assume that an Atom Entry returned in the Feed is a full rep=\r\nresentation of an Entry Resource and SHOULD perform a GET on the URI of the=\r\n Member Entry before editing it.&quot;\n\nThis is (at best) annoying for a user-ag=\r\nent which has to either (i) understand the completeness of the member entry=\r\n in the feed - for which I see no mechanism to determine, or (ii) must alwa=\r\nys execute a GET, PUT cycle to make a change.  If a GET is required anyway,=\r\n there are other standard mechanisms to inform the user-agent of the permit=\r\nted methods (e.g. &#39;Allow&#39; header).

Maybe that is out of band kno=\r\nwledge, but then again, knowing what @method=3D&quot;POST&quot; means\n&gt; could be cons=\r\nidered out of band too.   It has to be written down somewhere and agreed to=\r\n.  So the sharing of the semantics\n&gt; widely is key to interoperability.  He=\r\nnce a public link relations registry.   It is the shared semantics that all=\r\nows us to\n&gt; program user agents to do predictable things when they come acr=\r\noss a particular hypermedia construct.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Maybe it is important that whe=\r\nn a GET is done on a resource, that the response metadata also declare the =\r\navailable methods.\n&gt; Message metadata is authoritative.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But you shoul=\r\nd not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of bandwidth, and the repr=\r\nesentation format has already\n&gt; defined (in the registry) and declared (in =\r\nthe instance in which you find the href) the (possibly implicit) method ava=\r\nilabilities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3.

If we consider the following tw=\r\no examples:\n&gt; \n&gt; Example 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.exampl=\r\ne.com/order&#39; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is something &#39;=\r\norder&#39;-like at the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client inte=\r\nnt) to follow this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the repr=\r\nesentation of the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type)=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.example.com/new&#39;=\r\n to (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type =\r\ncommunicated by it&#39;s current context. This is the problem, I don&#39;t need to =\r\n&#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the ava=\r\nilable HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need to=\r\n do is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39; h=\r\neader, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of met=\r\nhod in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; \n&gt; Pa=\r\nul\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wm=\r\nartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi nikonguy74!\n&gt; &gt; Just to complement what Jan =\r\nis saying:\n&gt; &gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of =\r\nlinks is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but th=\r\nen there are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with t=\r\nhe actual resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What is this link referring to? =\r\nWhat other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query=\r\n parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it e=\r\nxpect if I can issue a POST?, etc...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. rel is an attribute to add=\r\n more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint of what re=\r\nlation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in a book pa=\r\nge, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with rel=3D&quot;nex=\r\nt&quot; will hint that following that link will get you to the next page of the =\r\nbook. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the relati=\r\non the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual resource/=\r\nuri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denote other information, li=\r\nke saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI wi=\r\nth a POST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a bad=\r\n practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your cl=\r\nient. If you are looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you =\r\nthe links points to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can =\r\nstart asking that parent for information, or even send a comment to it usin=\r\ng POST operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction i=\r\ns already designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be staticall=\r\ny programmed, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. So, you have there=\r\n standard metainformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of=\r\n POST and PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business=\r\n specific semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applica=\r\nble only to, say, banking applications). With that info you can program int=\r\nelligent clients.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor a=\r\nnd image are special links that have a standard meaning and established pro=\r\ncessing. If you found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is refe=\r\nrring to an image, and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed p=\r\nrocessing it to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context=\r\n and additional attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody=\r\n in the world knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but =\r\nonce you have it clear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link r=\r\nel attribute will tell you everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; William Mar=\r\ntinez.\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algerm=\r\nissen@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel l=\r\nink. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a gene=\r\nral documentation for how to interact with the link provider).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or A=\r\ntom media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link beyon=\r\nd &#39;this is a link&#39;. If you register your rel name in the IANA registry, you=\r\n can use the short name you registered, e.g. &#39;next&#39; or &#39;up&#39;. If you did not=\r\n register your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply for the matter of mak=\r\ning your rel unambiguous.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readab=\r\nle page explaining the relation, then that is even better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\nre is no magic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in =\r\ncode (or configure) what the user agent should do when it sees your link re=\r\nl value.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://foo/customerDetails&quot; ... /&gt; is co=\r\nnceptually the same as &lt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; .../&gt; and also as HTML&#39;s =\r\n&lt;img src=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt; or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;. It is just hype=\r\nrmedia ... that a user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ..=\r\n. in order to have it do something with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; IOW, your browser =\r\ndownloads that image because it is programmed to do so. This same concept a=\r\nlso applies to other hypermedia - your user agent component will act on the=\r\n hypermedia it comes across in the way it is programmed (or configured) to =\r\ndo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constr=\r\naint is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a client side pro=\r\ngrammer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across instead of the=\r\n one you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose cou=\r\npling.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there isn&#39;t any control=\r\n over the server side in networked systems. REST encourages you to deal wit=\r\nh that rather than magically solves a problem that cannot be solved.

If we co=\r\nnsider the following two examples:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nExample 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such =\r\nas &#39;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://relations.example.com/order&quot;&gt;http://relations.example=\r\n.com/order&lt;/a&gt;&#39; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is somethin=\r\ng &#39;order&#39;-like at the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client i=\r\nntent)\n to follow this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the =\r\nrepresentation of the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-t=\r\nype).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nExample 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://relatio=\r\nns.example.com/new&quot;&gt;http://relations.example.com/new&lt;/a&gt;&#39; to (unreasonably)=\r\n convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type communicated by it=\r\n&#39;s current context. This is the problem, I don&#39;t\n need to &#39;say&#39; to the user=\r\n-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the available HTTP metho=\r\nds tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need to do is examine th=\r\ne permitted methods (either by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39; header, or an OPTI=\r\nONS request)\n AND not try to convey the permutations of method in the &#39;rel&#39;=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDoes that make sense?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanks in advance&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPaul&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi nikonguy74!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Just to complement what Jan =\r\nis saying:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The ide=\r\na of links is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), b=\r\nut then there are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do w=\r\nith the actual resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What\n is this link referrin=\r\ng to? What other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add=\r\n query parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media type ma=\r\ny it expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2. rel is an =\r\nattribute to add more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword,=\r\n hint of what relation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you =\r\nare in a book page, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link=\r\n with rel=3D&quot;next&quot;\n will hint that following that link will get you to the =\r\nnext page of the book. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3. It is important to understand=\r\n that the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, ha=\r\ns with the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to d=\r\nenote other information, like saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the age=\r\nnt\n to use the link&#39;s URI with a POST to create something. That is not the =\r\nintended use and it is a bad practice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4. You may need a=\r\nctual business intelligence in your client. If you are looking at a blog co=\r\nmment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you the links points to the actual blog p=\r\nost. Having that information, you can start asking that parent for informat=\r\nion, or even send\n a comment to it using POST operation. That is natural si=\r\nmply because much of this interaction is already designed in the specs, and=\r\n the agent may not need to be statically programmed, but it will need intel=\r\nligence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 5. So, you have there standard metainformation =\r\n(like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST and PUT, the semanti=\r\ncs or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specific semantics (the a=\r\nctual value of the rel may mean something applicable only\n to, say, banking=\r\n applications). With that info you can program intelligent clients.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor and image are sp=\r\necial links that have a standard meaning and established processing. If you=\r\n found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to =\r\nan image, and if you are in HTML page in a browser,\n the supposed processin=\r\ng it to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context and add=\r\nitional attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the =\r\nworld knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you=\r\n have it\n clear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attr=\r\nibute will tell you everything.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cheers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; William Martinez.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot;&gt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algerm=\r\nissen@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 201=\r\n2, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I k=\r\nnow one of the first questions i had was on rel link.

This same concept also applies to other hype=\r\nrmedia - your user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes acro=\r\nss in the way it is programmed (or configured) to do.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; No magic.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia=\r\n constraint is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a client s=\r\nide programmer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across instead=\r\n of the one you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of lo=\r\nose\n coupling.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that=\r\n there isn&#39;t any control over the server side in networked systems. REST en=\r\ncourages you to deal with that rather than magically solves a problem that =\r\ncannot be solved. And on top of that, REST provides a number of mechanism\n =\r\nthat optimize for *dealing with* the problem (e.g. content negotiation).&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; HTH,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would you see if you go to the=\r\n rel link? Is it something a person is suppose to interact with (say to get=\r\n documentation for new links added to a specific response) or something cod=\r\ne can interact with to determine what it needs to\n do? Unfortunately in the=\r\n book they don&#39;t give an example of what a &quot;rel&quot; page would look like. For =\r\nexample the link:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rela=\r\ntions.restbucks.com/payment&quot;&gt;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; href:=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://restbucks.com/payment/1234&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://restbucks.com/payment/1234&lt;/a&gt;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If you typed in &quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://relations.restbucks.com/payment&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://relations.restbucks.com/payment&lt;/a&gt;&quot; into your web browser what would=\r\n you see?\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- en=\r\nd group email --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-51--791031703--\r\n\n"}}
