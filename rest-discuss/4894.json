Some overlaps though. And not everyone wants to use\nREST, especially because of the exotic HTTP methods.\n\n&gt; SOAP 1.0 used POST for all operations and HTTP&#39;s &quot;200 OK&quot; response code\n&gt; for _everything_, including errors, effectively making it impossible to\n&gt; use any existing HTTP tooling or intermediaries.\n\nYea this one I completely agree with you.\n\nBut sometimes I also don&#39;t like it. e.g. sometimes a browser may choose to\ndisplay its own 404 page than displaying the 404 from the resource. I\ndon&#39;t think there are many browsers this exotic though.\n\n&gt; WSDL 1.0&#39;s HTTP binding only mentions GET/POST, and in fact specifically\n&gt; says that those are the _only_ two HTTP operations supported.  It took a\n&gt; bunch of effort to get WSDL to even formally acknowledge that other HTTP\n&gt; operations exist.\n\nWSDL &lt; 2.0 sucks. Even WSDL 2.0 still sucks for its path/querystring\nsupport... I guess, from the *old* (i.e. almost 6 months) articles I read.\nWeird. HTTP has been around since the inception of the Web but these WSDL\nguys are just sooo ignorant (IMHO).\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s distracted a lot of people from actually looking at _why_\n&gt; and _how_ the Web has grown the way it has, to be as successful as it\n&gt; has been, and trying to figure out the cauality of that and implications\n&gt; of those causes.  This makes me sad.\n\nI really don&#39;t think the Web grows because of REST. I think the Web grows\nbecause of GET, POST, and HEAD. And some other useful stuff like CONNECT\nfor proxies. PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, ... IMHO are the things you don&#39;t hear\nso often, much less used. Especially if you&#39;re doing things with WEB\n*pages* and WEB *sites*. People are accustomed to think the web as a\ncollection of &quot;resources&quot;. In the sense of &quot;resources that DO things&quot;, not\n&quot;do things WITH resources&quot;.\n\n&gt; So, no, I don&#39;t appreciate many years of wasted effort from the\n&gt; marketing departments of big companies that want to control my internet,\n&gt; via re-specifying RPC with angle brackets, CORBA and DCOM.\n\nMaybe, but I was referring to their effort to develop the WS-Transfer\nspecification. Really, WS-Transfer benefits REST very much, while it\ndoesn&#39;t do anything much with the currently accepted Web Services standard\ni.e. SOAP.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
