As a cautionary note:  I think we need to tread\nlightly, here.  We don&#39;t want to hardwire any particular kind of\ncontainer semantics into the spec --- IMO, one of the problems\nwith DAV is that it imposes a new and rigid container semantics\non Web-based systems, one that isn&#39;t necessarily universal.  That\nsaid...\n\nWhen subscribing to a container, there are two possible kinds of\nnotification of interest:  changes to the contents of the\ncontainer (i.e., what is in it) --- potentially recursively ---\nand changes *in* the contents of the container (i.e., changes to\nthe things in it) --- again potentially recursively.  In order to\nsubscribe to a particular subtree of the resource space, however\nan application may define that, you shouldn&#39;t have to subscribe\nto each individual resource in that subtree.  So we need two\nmechanisms:  a notification-time specifier that indicates which\nresource has changed, and a subscription-time specifier that\nindicates the &quot;depth&quot; of the subscription.\n\nNOTIFICATION SPECIFIER\n----------------------------\n\nThis one&#39;s easy.  A container which generates notifications\nSHOULD include a header &quot;Changed-URI&quot; that gives the full URI for\nthe resource which has changed, generating this event.  The\nChanged-URI MAY be a different URI than the Subscribed-URI /\nWatched-URI associated with the subscription.  A Changed-URI in a\nnotification SHOULD (?) be a sub-URI of the Subscribed-URI, i.e.,\na URI that has as a leading substring the full Subscribed-URI.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION SPECIFIER\n----------------------------\n\nThis one is tricky.  At a first pass, it might be acceptable to\nsimply allow two kinds of container subscriptions:  subscriptions\nto change notifications when the top-level contents of the\ncontainer change, and subscriptions to changes to the top-level\ncontents or to any of the contained objects, recursively.  I.e.,\na &quot;recursive&quot; boolean.  There are perhaps two ways to do this.\n\n(1)  On the subscription request, the client could pass a header\n&quot;Recursive-Subscription&quot; along to the subscribed resource.\n\n(2)  We could introduce some URI magic.  Before everyone begins\nyelling that this violates URI opacity, consider OPTIONS *.  It&#39;s\nalready the case that * is in effect a special URI that in the\ncontext of OPTIONS means &quot;state of the server that receives the\nrequest.&quot;  With that in mind, assume\n\n    /foo\n    /foo/bar\n    /foo/baz/baf\n\n/foo/ is a container that contains a non-container /foo/bar, and\na container /foo/baz/ that itself contains a non-container\n/foo/baz/baf.  A subscriber might specify\n\n    /foo/*\n\nTo get notifications in all of the following circumstances:  (a)\nthe contents of /foo/ change.  (b) The state of /foo/bar\nchanges.  (c)  The contents of /foo/baz/ change.  (d)  The state\nof /foo/baz/baf changes.\n\nA subscription on just /foo/ would simply generate events when\nthe contents of /foo/ change.\n\nI actually prefer the second option;  it gives a name-based\nmechanism for distinguishing between the object itself and the\nsubtree, and let&#39;s name-based dispatch code figure out what&#39;s\ngoing on rather than having to grope through the headers.\nSticking it in the headers feels a bit too much to me like RPC\nwith paramater-passing in the headers.  But it&#39;s only a mild\npreference.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
