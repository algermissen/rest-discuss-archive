REST is typified by HTTP/URI and SOA\nis typified by UDDI/WSDL/SOAP.  I&#39;m not exactly sure where XML-RPC fits\nin to this mix, probably in place of SOAP in the SOA stack.\n\nI think this would be a useful comparison to make.  I&#39;ve tried to broach\nthis subject on the rest-discuss list before, but got slammed pretty\nhard because of the understandably REST-oriented view of the list.  Can\nanyone suggest an appropriate forum for such a discussion?  Is there\nsome mailing list where people would be willing to discuss the merits\nand shortcomings of both REST and SOA?  I don&#39;t want to get into a war\nabout this on the rest-discuss list because things would be pretty\nlopsided.  Maybe it would be worthwhile to start some kind of\n&quot;Machine-to-Machine Architectures for the Internet&quot; group on Yahoo to\ndiscuss this?  Topics like REST, SOA and Grid Computing could be\ndiscussed, with proponents of each approach and neutral people (like me)\ndiscussing the issues involved.  Or is this just too much of a religious\nissue for everyone?\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jeff Bone [mailto:jbone@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 26, 2002 9:24 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; Second:  the fallacy of this &quot;SOAP / XML-RPC vs. REST&quot; debate is that\n&gt; it&#39;s apples and oranges;  REST is an architectural style, not a\n&gt; particular integration technology.  As such, it&#39;s not necessarily the\n&gt; case that it needs a toolkit.  Certainly, it would be nice if tools\n&gt; mapped better to the model, but make no mistake:  every non-SOAP /\n&gt; non-XMLRPC Web App out there is an existance proof (to a greater or\n&gt; lesser extent) of REST.  You guys are in the minority today.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
