[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Since GET and DELETE are both idempotent, there is not need to come\n&gt; up with any other mechanism for atomicity.\n\nOne of us must be confused - the issue of whether the methods are\nidempotent or atomic are somewhat orthogonal. The point that Patrick\nwas trying to make, and I was agreeing with, is that a sequence of\nmethods (e.g. PUT followed by DELETE) is not atomic whereas, in this\nparticular situation, that is the behavior we want.\n\n&gt; [...] given\n&gt; the restrictions in my particular circumstance - single consumer or\n&gt; queue, guaranteed delivery, ability to re-establish context, no \n&gt; support of POST or PUT - the semantics of GET and DELETE support \n&gt; what is necessary.\n\nPerhaps, although it is illustrative to consider a more general\npurpose implementation that would both address your specific needs, as\nwell as those in which one wishes to support more than a single\nconsumer. Further, the issue of GET+DELETE not being atomic is\nrelevant to the single consumer case because a failure which ocurrs\nbetween the processing of the two method requests has the potential to\nwreck the state of the application just as easily as when multiple\nconsumers are involved.\n\n&gt; [...] If there were a need to support multiple consumers, I would agree.\n\nOne should not be so cavalier as to assume knowledge of the end of\ndays. That is, it is almost certain that components you develop will\nbe used in ways you cannot anticipate. For example, there may be a\ntime where your customer decides to replicate the consumer part of the\nsystem to increase throughput (in an order processing scenario, for\nexample). An order queue which only supports a single consumer is of\nlittle long term use, especially where reuse is concerned.\n\nOf course one should weigh the relative costs of design alternatives\nand select or develop the implementation that is most appropriate for\nthe given situation. In this case, however, it would seem most prudent\nto build a general purpose and reuseable queue that can support\nmultiple consumers just as well as a single one.\n\n\nRegards,\nElias\n\n\n\n\n"}}
