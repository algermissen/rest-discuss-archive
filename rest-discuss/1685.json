Then once you&#39;ve decided that, it \n&gt; makes sense to ask for equivalents. They aren&#39;t so there \n&gt; isn&#39;t. The issue should be a no-brainer for UDDI. Who do you \n&gt; know who is using UDDI? For what?\n\nPaul,\n\nWhy do you insist on arguing over the individual trees instead of\nlooking at the forest?  I didn&#39;t bother replying when you casually filed\naway my previous comments as not being relevant to Rich&#39;s specific\nproblem.  Now you insist on examining the value  of individual SOAP\nspecs when I was pointing out that REST doesn&#39;t seem to be catching fire\nunlike SOAP.\n\n&gt; J2EE and Expat are all you need for a &quot;REST toolkit and \n&gt; library.&quot; I&#39;m sorry to be so anticlimatic but the basic REST \n&gt; tools have been deployed for around eight years now. It&#39;s \n&gt; pretty hard to do better when the industry has already spent \n&gt; a *billion dollars* on REST toolkits.\n\nThis display of trivialization and delusion does not become you.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m curious, have you read the SOAP spec?\n\nI have read 1.1 and earlier specs.  I have not yet read the 1.2 drafts.\n\nBest,\n\nDon Park\n\nPS: I find this sudden and unilateral shift to REST mailing list\ndistasteful, Paul.\n\n\n"}}
