Servers have the necessary mechanisms with HTTP by which to indicate that a resource has changed location - so the choice to accommodate this kind of &#39;URI dependent&#39; client behavior for a given resource is down to the implementation\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; If a server implements such a mechanism (a requirement of being cool),\n&gt; then a client can legitimately depend on a bookmark or a URI template\n&gt; and rely upon the server to map from the old URI space to the new one\n&gt; (eg redirect). The only downside to the client in relying on a\n&gt; bookmark or URI template is some loss in performance due to the\n&gt; redirection. The redirection mechanism could provide a URI (via the\n&gt; HTTP link header) to the new template or at least a document for\n&gt; developers explaining the change and what they must do to update the\n&gt; client code.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;   \n\nIf the inefficiency of redirected bookmarks was of potential concern to \na client, then a solution to that would be to react to a 301 Moved \nPermanently response by updating the referring bookmark&#39;s URI with the \nvalue of the response&#39;s Location header.\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.2\n\n&quot;10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently\n\nThe requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any \nfuture references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs.  \nClients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link \nreferences to the Request-URI to one or more of the new returned by the \nserver, where possible. This response is cacheable unless indicated \notherwise.&quot;\n\nIt is my understanding that generating URIs from templates should be \navoided, and that leveraging HATEOAS from pre-established entry points \n(i.e. &quot;bookmarks&quot;) is the RESTful alternative. Any change to this entry \npoint (i.e. it responds with a 301) could be handled as described above.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
