Or did I  \n&gt; misunderstand you?\n&gt; \n\nActually, half-and-half:  there&#39;s no reason not to use the Allow\nheader, as far as I know, and Vary: Authentication to indicate that a\ndifferent user may be allowed to use different methods.  For your\n&quot;self-documenting&quot; idea, couldn&#39;t scripting could be used to read the\nAllow and Vary headers?\n\nFor what I suggested could go in an Accept response header, current\npractice is to use hypermedia, you have Atom Protocol on your side as \nwell.  So we do agree there, I&#39;m just wondering why Accept can&#39;t be a\nresponse header in 2616bis, nothing to do with your article.  :-)\n\nStill, why no luv for OPTIONS?  I ask because I&#39;m currently considering\nsome novel uses for OPTIONS, like say, to return an XForms interface\n[1], which in the example allows me to POST a new entry to my weblog if\nyou use your imagination.  Works best with X-smiles, imagine an\n&#39;options&#39; button on the address bar.\n\nI&#39;d better confess that I&#39;ve only spent one day working with XForms,\nand most of my time was spent discovering that you can&#39;t solve the\n&lt;category/&gt; generation problem with &lt;select&gt;, only &lt;select1&gt;, I&#39;m\nlooking forward to disabling duplicate &lt;category/&gt; selection when I get\na chance.  Also, making the PUT interface for editing, and a bunch of\nother stuff.  I don&#39;t know why I avoided trying XForms for so long...\n\n-Eric\n\n[1] http://canuck.bisonsystems.net/xforms/\n\n"}}
