We are not using the full set \nof SyncML specifications, and we have not a SyncML server or any SyncML \ninfrastructure, we are only using SyncML as a &quot;normalization&quot; tool \nbetween two disparate systems.\n\nNow, it seems to me that the SyncML protocol is the opposite of Rest, as \nit is based on commands as opposed to resources. How can I make this two \nscenarios compatible? Has anyone had experience with this kind of problem?\n\nThanks.\n\n"}}
