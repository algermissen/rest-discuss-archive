The application thereby brought to life might spa=\r\nn several, unrelated &#39;services&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another way one might say this is &#39;Th=\r\ne application is defined by the current use of the system (the Web) for the=\r\n given user intention&#39; (and the current application state is &quot;defined by it=\r\ns pending requests, the topology of connected components (some of which may=\r\n be filtering buffered data), the active requests on those connectors, the =\r\ndata flow of representations in response to those requests, and the process=\r\ning of those representations as they are received by the user agent.&quot;[1]\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If that understanding makes sense at all, it has the consequence, that a=\r\npplication design is actually done on the client side and *not* on the serv=\r\ner side.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the context of machine clients this would mean that applic=\r\nations are defined by the client side developer&#39;s interpretations of and as=\r\nsumptions about the envisioned media types (and link relations) and rules f=\r\nor choosing transitions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Comments most welcome...\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#=\r\nsec_5_3_3\n&gt; \n&gt; [2] &#39;User&#39; in this context would be a human user or someone =\r\nwho prepares (codes or configures) a client component to persue a certain g=\r\noal\n&gt;\n\nI agree with a lot of this but not all. Your definition of user ([2]=\r\n above)is flawed in a very subtle way. The user is someone who takes a clie=\r\nnt (maybe they wrote it and maybe not) and points it at one or more URIs to=\r\n accomplish their goal. ie. they configure the system at run-time. The clie=\r\nnt might then provide a UI for them to use or it might not. The lack of a U=\r\nI might not imply that the goals are completely encoded in the client -- th=\r\ne URIs (and hence servers) selected by the user are just as important as th=\r\ne client used.\n\nie. My goal could be to build a search index of my corporat=\r\ne intranet. The spider I write/choose to build indexes is one part of the s=\r\nystem, but the corporate intranet is another important part.\n\nSo I disagree=\r\n that application design is all client side -- both the client and the serv=\r\ners (most importantly the representations they serve) are important to achi=\r\neving the users&#39; goals.\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
