I  \n&gt; would really like feedback on this inter=\r\nesting issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; The TAG finding on the use of metadata in URIs states tha=\r\nt the use  \n&gt; of FORM in a returned HTML representation effectively &quot;assert=\r\ns&quot; or  \n&gt; &quot;assures&quot; that the &quot;assigning authority&quot; is &quot;supporting a class o=\r\nf  \n&gt; parameterized URIs&quot;. This raises the following questions:\n&gt; \t=95 Do y=\r\nou agree?\n\nYes, sure. That is how clients bind to the objects they want to =\r\ninvoke  \nmethods on. This not only applies to forms but to anything the cli=\r\nent  \nlearns about the resources it comes across.\nStatements made by the au=\r\nthority of the resource take precedence over  \nstatements made by other aut=\r\nhorities, tough.\n\n&gt; \t=95 If so, then how long is such an assertion/assuranc=\r\ne good for?\n\nAs long as the representation is said to be valid (IOW cacheab=\r\nle).\n\n&gt; \t=95 For example, if I save an HTML page on my client, should the  =\r\n\n&gt; embedded FORM(s) work hours, days, weeks, months, years later?\n\nSee e.g.=\r\n the Expires header.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \t=95 Since every use of any URI (parametric or no=\r\nt) is an assertion or  \n&gt; assurance that the assigning authority will suppo=\r\nrt the specific URI  \n&gt; for a long time -- at least if the authority is fol=\r\nlowing the &quot;cool  \n&gt; URI&quot; practice -- why shouldn&#39;t the use of a FORM-based=\r\n parametric  \n&gt; URI also be an assertion or assurance that the assigning au=\r\nthority  \n&gt; will support the specific FORM for a long time?\n&gt; \t=95 In other=\r\n words, should &quot;cool FORMs&quot; like cool URIs last a long  \n&gt; time?\n\nNo, not a=\r\nt all. The important part of the hypermedia as the engine of  \napp state is=\r\n that the server can *change* it without breaking client  \nassumptions.\n\nTh=\r\nere is a caveat to all this: by the time the client actually makes  \nthe re=\r\nquest, there is no way for it to communicate any specific  \nexpectation it =\r\nhas (e.g. by submitting this form I want to order that  \nbook), it must rel=\r\ny on the server being what it said before it is.  \nEven if the client check=\r\ns back right before the request, there still  \nis a gap and the resource it=\r\n POSTs to could change dramatically.\n\nThe intended solution for this gap is=\r\n the Expect header which allows  \nthe client to tell the server what it exp=\r\nects and allow the server to  \nreport back if that expectation can no longe=\r\nr e met. In practice  \nExpect is not implemented as far as I know (IIRC the=\r\nre is a reason in  \nterms of architectural principles that it is not used, =\r\nbut I cannot  \nremember it now).\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\n\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nick Gall\n=\r\n&gt; Phone: +1.781.608.5871\n&gt; AOL IM: Nicholas Gall\n&gt; Yahoo IM: nick_gall_1117=\r\n\n&gt; MSN IM: (same as email)\n&gt; Google Talk: (same as email)\n&gt; Email: nick.gal=\r\nl AT-SIGN gmail DOT com\n&gt; Weblog: http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/\n&gt; Fur=\r\nl: http://www.furl.net/members/ngall \n\n\n"}}
