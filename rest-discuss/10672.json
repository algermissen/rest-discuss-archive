POX is simply a way to represent a resource, right?\n&gt; A resource might be text, might be HTML markup, might be plain old XML, etc.\n\nA lot of people use that term to denote RPC over XML over HTTP.  The\nURL is the operation you&#39;re invoking, XML is the payload, and\neverything is carried using POST.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think of REST as a method of exposing those text, HTML, or POX resources.\n&gt; So it&#39;s not really REST vs POX.  It&#39;s REST+POX, REST+HTML, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your colleagues&#39; industry they may be able to leverage their existing POX\n&gt; payloads in a RESTful manner through sensible URL&#39;s, stateless execution,\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; In the process of doing so, they may decide to rationalize their POX\n&gt; payloads\n&gt; into more resource-centric representations of their data.  Or they may find\n&gt; that\n&gt; their POX payloads are already resource-centric and they just want to\n&gt; beautify their access patterns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Sean Kennedy\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 29, 2008 8:24 AM\n&gt; To: Rest Discussion Group\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] REST vs POX\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Folks,\n&gt;       I work in academia and was recently talking to some former industry\n&gt; colleagues (financial people). I asked them how they implemented SOA and\n&gt; they said POX. They didnt know must about REST (something I intend to\n&gt; rectify!). They didnt like SOAP because there was too much XML involved and\n&gt; they dont use WSDL because &quot;we know where the service is&quot;. However, I found\n&gt; it difficult to argue the point of the advantages of REST versus POX...\n&gt;\n&gt; Sean.\n\n"}}
