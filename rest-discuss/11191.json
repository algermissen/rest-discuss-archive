If http doesn&#39;t make use of them, nothing prevents you from defining \nthem, this is the whole concept of delegation between scheme -&gt; \ndereferencing application.\n\nQuote:\n These characters are called\n   &quot;reserved&quot; because they may (or may not) be defined as delimiters by\n   the generic syntax, by each scheme-specific syntax, or by the\n   implementation-specific syntax of a URI&#39;s dereferencing algorithm.\n\nthe generic syntax doesn&#39;t cover any of the charaters alan was talking \nabout, and neither does http. You are as such quite free to use them for \nyour dereferencing algorithm. Hence:\nURI producing applications should percent-encode data octets that\n   correspond to characters in the reserved set unless these characters\n   are specifically allowed by the URI scheme to represent data in that\n   component.\n\nAs a producer of a dereferencing algorythm you have the right to create such \ndelimiters, and clients shouldn&#39;t have to worry about producing such \ndelimiters in their normal form.\n\nWhat this all means is that if you decide to have \nhttp://server/[{identifier}] as a valid delimited url, you would only encode \nthose brackets when the identifier itself contains one, so as to preserve \nthe safeness of said delimiters. And of course, as your clients shouldn&#39;t \ncraft their own Uris by hand they don&#39;t ever have to do the encoding.\n\nSeb\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom: &quot;Houghton,Andrew&quot; &lt;houghtoa@...&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 13, 2008 3:21 PM\nTo: &quot;Alan Dean&quot; &lt;alan.dean@...&gt;; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Designing URI for a subset\n\n&gt;&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-\n&gt;&gt; discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Alan Dean\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 13, 2008 10:15 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Designing URI for a subset\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; According to RFC3986 Section 2.2 [1] &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; are indeed characters\n&gt;&gt; reserved as general delimiters. So is &quot;/&quot;. That doesn&#39;t stop us using\n&gt;&gt; using &quot;/&quot;. Why should it stop us using &quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot;? In fact, I was\n&gt;&gt; demonstrating using it exactly as a general delimiter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Because they are reserved for scheme specific URI specification.  The HTTP \n&gt; URI syntax does not make use of [ or ], but does specify / as the path \n&gt; segment separator.  So if you want to use [, ], or / in an HTTP URI you \n&gt; must percent hex encode those characters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
