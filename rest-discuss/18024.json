The new \ntext in HTTPbis is:\n\n&quot;.... Partial content updates are possible by targeting a separately \nidentified resource with state that overlaps a portion of the larger \nresource, or by using a different method that has been specifically \ndefined for partial updates (for example, the PATCH method defined in \n[RFC5789]).&quot;\n\n2) Also: just replacing PUT with PATCH is not sufficient. The \nContent-Type of the PATCH requests describes the patch format, not the \nformat being patched.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
