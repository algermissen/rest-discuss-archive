Good on them.\n\nI cannot figure out why APP needs an envelope at all. It makes sense\nfor web sites exposing feeds with &gt; 1 entry to use a format that rolls\nup each items metainfo with the item itself -- call that a list of\nentries. That&#39;s not APP; it&#39;s just serving up feeds.\n\nBut when I&#39;m POSTing or PUTting content, I could just POST/PUT the\nhtml/xhtml/text/whatever representation directly to the content URI.\nEntity headers could capture anything they currently model in an\n&lt;entry&gt;. APP could simply be a list of entity header definitions. But\nthey&#39;ve forced implementors to model something called an &lt;entry&gt; which\njust wraps the real content. Then there&#39;s this indirection to get to\nthe real content.\n\nIn that respect, APP did not enhance my understanding.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
