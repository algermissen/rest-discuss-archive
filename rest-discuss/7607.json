HTTP&#39;s REST replaces the\n&gt; &gt; doSomething concept with a &quot;make something so&quot; concept. If you think\n&gt; &gt; about it, all doSomething can be modelled this way. Instead of &quot;make\n&gt; &gt; this kind of state transition&quot;, just &quot;make your state this&quot;. You\n&gt; have to\n&gt; &gt; get into specific examples to see how this works.\n&gt; what about passing parameters, like &#39;start at date&#39;? or &#39;start at date\n&gt; with X resources&#39;? the first can be modeled by setting &#39;date&#39; to a\n&gt; &#39;schedule&#39; property of the service. but how can the second? \n\nThe &quot;with X resources&quot; sounds like it is part of your function\ndefinition. In that case, it should be part of what you POST into your\nschedule resource:\n\nPOST http://example.com/functionSchedule HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/calendar+xml\n\n&lt;vevent&gt;\n\t&lt;priority&gt;5&lt;/priority&gt;\n\t&lt;dtstart&gt;2007-01-13T08:55:00Z&lt;/dtstart&gt;\n\t&lt;dtend&gt;2007-01-13T09:55:00Z&lt;/dtend&gt;\n\t&lt;content type=&quot;application/my-function-definition&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;function&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;resource&gt;resource1&lt;/resource&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;resource&gt;resource2&lt;/resource&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;resource&gt;resource3&lt;/resource&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/function&gt;\n\t&lt;/content&gt;\n&lt;/vevent&gt;\n\nHowever, the exact design would no doubt rely on factors that are not\neasy to communicate via email.\n\n&gt; also, many suggestions, while very good in themselves mean that the\n&gt; rest API is no longer just a gateway to the system&#39;s functionality. it\n&gt; enforces the system to be built in a certain way (like creating\n&gt; &#39;process&#39; resources that can be monitored and canceled). while rest is\n&gt; an excellent approach to API, systems are usually designed by\n&gt; object-oriented, procedural or functional approaches. \n\nYou won&#39;t be able to write a &quot;REST Proxy&quot; for your system that\nautomatically translates REST requests to internal method invocations.\nThe REST request and the internal method are based on different\nconceptual models. You will either need to write glue code that maps\nthese conceptual models to each other, or push the REST approach further\nback into your applications. In the glue code model the resources\nintroduced as part of the REST Proxy would be created and maintained\nwith the glue as handles to internal state. You would just have to be\ncareful about the API and internal state models becoming inconsistent.\n\nI&#39;m an advocate of pushing REST futher back myself, although this is\nmost effective when the system behind the curtain is a distributed\nobject environment that will benefit from the application of REST\nprinciples.\n\n&gt; what i would love to see is a separation of API and model, in the same\n&gt; sense as MVC. i want to construct my system with whatever approach is\n&gt; suitable for me and then be able to provide a restful API to it,\n&gt; without having it break my system model.\n\nSo long as you are prepared to write the glue code, there is nothing to\nstop this from happening. You can encapsulate the non-RESTful system in\na RESTful container. Just don&#39;t expect it to be a 1:1 mapping. If the\ninside is not RESTful and the outside is RESTful, it will be n:m.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
