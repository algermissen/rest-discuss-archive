Most REST discussions recommend using HTTP Auth (RFC\n&gt;2617), but this solution isn&#39;t ideal because browsers keep the\n&gt;authorization creditials until the browser is closed.  This rules out\n&gt;having multiple users on the same machine.\n&gt;\n&gt;Is there a workaround to this?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think you can reset the credentials by sending a request which causes \nthe server to stop accepting the current credentials.  That&#39;s just an \nidea, though -- I haven&#39;t tried it out.\n\n\n&gt;Or, how terrible is it if I pass the username and password as part of\n&gt;the URI?  Everything is going over SSL, so it&#39;s not a security concern.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPretty terrible, because it breaks bookmarking, and because users will \nsend URLs around that include their username and password.  If HTTP auth \ndoesn&#39;t work for you, a cookie-based approach is next best.\n\nGood luck.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
