This is not a media type problem, but a potential reality that =\r\nRestbucks Inc. may need to account for.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you provide an example =\r\nof the situation that made you change your mind?\n\nSay, the server offers bo=\r\noks and CDs with media types application/vnd.book.myformat and application/=\r\nvnd.cd.myformat. The task of an ops engineer is to quickly come up with dai=\r\nly charts showing requests/day for books and CDs, by sifting through access=\r\n logs. It is easy to implement this when the URIs used for these types of r=\r\nesources have stable patterns. \n\nLet&#39;s say, you now want to run all CD sale=\r\ns (POST requests) through a bigger box. URI patterns rule again. \n\nBoth the=\r\nse are solvable based on media types, but when I design my application such=\r\n that some key factors are reflected in URIs (and a few known media types),=\r\n I get much more mileage out of the HTTP toolstack. If I start folding thes=\r\ne into an elaborate media type scheme, I will be fighting with the toolstac=\r\nk to get it to work for me. In the long run, it may even cost more to maint=\r\nain such a system.\n\nIn other words, media types (along with URIs, content e=\r\nncodings, charset params etc.) keep representation visible to the protocol =\r\nand the toolstack. But that does not necessarily follow that media types mu=\r\nst be used to determine whether an incoming XML document is a book or a CD.=\r\n There are other (simpler) ways to determine such things.\n\nSubbu\n"}}
