Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Ok.  I&#39;ll bite.  Just for fun:\n&gt; If I want to use chunked encoding to send a\n&gt; stockmarket feed, then the chunks are just\n&gt; individual trades over the course of the duration\n&gt; the stream is fed.  The document content-type\n&gt; would be something like\n&gt; application/x-stock-trades.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is perfectly HTTP legal and not very abusive\n&gt; because the client has no way to tell if sending\n&gt; delays are caused by network congestion, server\n&gt; load, or actually waiting for the trades to\n&gt; complete.\nThat is true. If the content type and resource is modeled as a collection of\ntrades, it looks fine to me (not that I&#39;m any judge...).\nAnd if the resource is modelled as a collection of messages - like a message\nqueue - the same thing applies (using chunked transfer encoding is a nice\noptimization in this case). Thats what the Destiny project on SourceForge\ndoes - keeps returning messages from the collection (the queue).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; OTOH, sending a HTTP reply in a request begs all\n&gt; sorts of questions about error handling, response\n&gt; structure, proxies, etc.\n&gt;\nCool. My stuff is more abusive than yours - I&#39;ll write the book then. ;)\nI agree that tunnelling has more http level problems than long-lived\nresponses. I just think it is useful for firewalled systems.\n\n\n\n"}}
