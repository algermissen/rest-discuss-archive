And the way that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently asserted is if you see a HTML FORM that says;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &lt;form action=&quot;http://www.dierken.com/email/&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &lt;/form&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So:  in order to access the resource in question, a &quot;client&quot; needs to be able to\n&gt; &gt; understand not only URI+HTTP, but also HTML?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not at all.  I said &quot;currently&quot;.  Any machine processable format would\n&gt; suffice.  I don&#39;t know that RDF has anything to say about query terms\n&gt; (hmm), but things like WRDL and WSDL do.\n\nSo let me restate my question:  in order to access the resource in question, a\n&quot;client&quot; needs to be able to understand not only URI+HTTP, but also some form of\nhypermedia?\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
