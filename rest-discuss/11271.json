A GET either\nreturns a representation or it doesn’t.\n\n&gt; The spec only talks about the processing of the request.\n\nYes, exactly, it says “processing.” A GET contains no entity body\nso there is nothing to process.\n\n&gt; That said, I don&#39;t believe defining a custom &quot;protocol&quot; based\n&gt; on a clever use of the 202 response is much less restful as the\n&gt; document approach. After all, the problem is generic enough,\n&gt; and certainly useful enough, to solve the problem without\n&gt; imposing a content type. And it would work just the same on a\n&gt; browser as it would with a client understanding only bare http.\n\nYou don’t need any particularly specific content type, you just\nneed sufficiently specifically annotated links. You could even\nstick them in `Link` headers, you just need to choose the `rel`\nmeaningfully enough.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
