But it turns out those tools (in this\n&gt; particular toolkit) limit FORM processing to only reqyests where the\n&gt; method is POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; I supplied a patch to the devs of the toolkit but they rejected it\n&gt; saying that they did not consider it correct PUT behaviour. \n\nThey have a point, because form processing is specced in HTML not HTTP \nand HTML forms don&#39;t extend to PUT. I don&#39;t agree with that design \nchoice in HTML itself, but mod_python isn&#39;t acting unreasonably; ie this \nisn&#39;t a bug. The application/x-www-form-urlencoded type isn&#39;t specced \noutside HTML, but otoh, multipart/form-data isn&#39;t bound to HTML. You \ncould I suppose argue for multipart/form-data support on PUT methods.\n\n&gt; They would\n&gt; consider it again however if I can point to another toolkit allowing\n&gt; PUT to process FORM values.\n\nIdeally, you&#39;d find a client that sends form data with PUT; that might \nclinch it.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
