This document (recently translated from  \nthe German) is the=\r\n definitive summary of what REST looks like from  \nthe perspective of Ruby =\r\non Rails -- which I suspect is where many new  \nprogrammers are going to fi=\r\nrst experience REST!\n\nSo, I encourage y&#39;all to check it out.  And, if you f=\r\nind areas where  \nyou think Rails isn&#39;t being RESTful enough, let me know a=\r\nnd I&#39;ll  \ncollate the feedback for Mr. Rails, David H. (though I think he&#39;s=\r\n on  \nat least one of these lists himself).\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\nRESTful Rails Dev=\r\nelopment PDF Released\n\nhttp://www.rubyinside.com/restful-rails-development-=\r\npdf- \nreleased-392.html\n\nPOST BY PETER COOPER\n\nA month ago I reported on th=\r\ne release of a PDF (in German) covering  \nRails&#39; REST abilities by Ralf Wir=\r\ndemann and Thomas Baustert (the  \nauthors of the first German Rails book, &quot;=\r\nRapid Web Development mit  \nRuby on Rails&quot;). With the help of Florian G=F6r=\r\nsdorf and Adam Groves,  \nthey&#39;ve produced a fine English translation titled=\r\n &quot;RESTful Rails  \nDevelopment&quot;. It&#39;s still free (although donations are acc=\r\nepted).\n\nIt&#39;s only about thirty pages long, but in that space it packs in a=\r\n  \nlot of information about Rails and REST, including REST routing,  \nURLs,=\r\n view techniques, path methods, and how to nest resources. If,  \nlike me, y=\r\nou&#39;re a Rails developer who&#39;s pretty savvy at the 1.0 level  \nbut haven&#39;t m=\r\nade the leap into the world of REST, it&#39;s a great primer.\n\n\n\n"}}
