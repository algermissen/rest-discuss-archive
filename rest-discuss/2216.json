I thought I said the same thing.  \n&gt; What&#39;s the difference?  Where am I wrong?\n&gt; I don&#39;t get it at all.\n\nIt&#39;s your use of the word &quot;request&quot;.  The client can&#39;t request it.  It\njust sends the data, and it&#39;s up to the container to do it, or not.\n\nI suppose you could consider the use of SOAPAction with a URI\nidentifying the expected type (in this case, a\nStatePreservingContainer), a &quot;request&quot;.  But I didn&#39;t get the impression\nthat that&#39;s what you were suggesting.  If so, then you were right.\n\n&gt; Ok, I&#39;m gonna keep trying until I get this right.\n&gt; \n&gt; *If* the resource is a StatePreservingContainer, \n&gt; and if I post the proper request to create a subordinate resource,\n&gt; then the container will create a resource and return a 201.\n\nModulo the &quot;request&quot; issue, yes.\n\n&gt; By the way, I&#39;ve tried to repeat the same thing you wrote in slightly \n&gt; different words three times now and been told I was wrong by both you \n&gt; and Walden Mathews and still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. \n&gt; I know this is possible, and you seem to agree it&#39;s possible, but \n&gt; there is obviously some sublety that I am missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the name StatePreservingContainer is not very clear, at least \n&gt; to me. Nor is IdentityPreservingContainer. But maybe that&#39;s because \n&gt; I&#39;m still missing some subtlety.\n\nNo, it could be the name.  If you&#39;ve got any suggestions after this,\nI&#39;m all ears.\n\n&gt; I think this is an important capability for meeting business \n&gt; requirements.  I&#39;m happy to revert to a hybrid of REST + SOAP, but am \n&gt; still trying to figure out how far I can go with pure REST.\n&gt; And I do need to know how to describe it so that it meets the \n&gt; business requirements and will not get shot down by the REST gang.\n\nSOAP&#39;s still purely optional.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
