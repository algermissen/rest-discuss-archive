The first is simply practical: many\ncaches do not cache responses to requests that contain what appears\nto be query information, since there is usually less of a chance\nof a future hit on the same query.  Server-side caches can optimize\naround that for their own common queries, but they have no way of\nchanging the intermediaries.\n\nThe second reason is that path is a hierarchical name space, unlike\nthe query.  If you are using hierarchical tools to manipulate\nhierarchical spaces, it is best to avoid escaping from the hierarchy\nin arbitrary ways.  A hierarchy is, after all, simply a pre-established\nquery with a defined order among elements.\n\nThe third reason is that there is only one query portion of a URI.\nIf you use it for silly reasons, then it won&#39;t be as useful for\nactual queries (user-driven options).\n\nI am sure there are other reasons -- those are just off the top of\nmy head.  There are also implementation-specific reasons, such as\nmore predefined options in Apache for handling requests in the path,\nresulting in more efficient handling of blobs of data that are stored\nas simple files.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
