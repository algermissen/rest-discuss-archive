This is an Atom Media Link Entry.\n&gt; How does this demonstrate using something other than an atom format as\n&gt; the representation?\nI was arguing that you don&#39;t have to wrap your content in an atom entry.\nThe example above taken from the spec shows that media entries are  \nnot wrapped.\nIt is just returning metadata about the posted content.\n&gt; &gt; Here the content is at http://media.example.org/the_beach.png\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So really the atom server is just creating metadata about\n&gt; &gt; &quot;...the_beach.png&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, yes, that&#39;s what an atom Media Link Entry is for.\n&gt; http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub- \n&gt; protocol-13.html#media-link-entries\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That metadata could be expressed in rdf using atom-owl btw:\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see where in the APP spec this is allowed.\n&gt;\nI am saying *could* in the sense of technically it would not have  \nbeen a silly idea nor a difficult to comprehend one.\n\nThe argument initially was that the semantic web was incompatible  \nwith RESTful web services. I just showed how that is nonsense, since  \nyou can think of the atom xml as just a representation of an rdf graph.\n&gt; For example, at\n&gt; http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub- \n&gt; protocol-13.html#memuri\n&gt; it says: &quot;Retrieval and updating of Member Entry Resources are done by\n&gt; exchanging Atom Entry representations.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, everything else I can find in that document about\n&gt; representations refers to rfc4287.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So it is not xml or rdf formats that are important here. It is that\n&gt; &gt; we expect the server to do certain things when it receives a POST or\n&gt; &gt; a PUT. And this is why Atom is a great example of a RESTful web  \n&gt; service.\n&gt;\n&gt; That sounds good, but either I&#39;m misreading the APP spec, or it does\n&gt; in fact say that the Atom syndication format format must be used.\n\nWhether it does or does not is not the question here in my mind. It  \nwould not have been any technical problem to do it in rdf.\nIt certainly would have made the extensibility of atom more  \npredictable. Currently you have to search around for rfcs to get an  \nidea of what is meant by any atom extensions. If you ever find them,  \nyou then have to read those rfcs very carefully to be able to work  \nout what they may possibly mean. Semantic Web technologies would have  \nmade the understanding of atom extensions a lot easier. It would  \nprobably have made the atom protocol itself better. Currently one is  \nforced to fill the atom entry with a number of dummy fields (such as  \nthe required id) even when they are never needed or are completely  \ndetermined by the server. There are a few other areas where better  \nsemantic definitions in atom would have helped.\n\nBtw. it was part of the Atom working groups aim to provide an  \nontology initially.\n\n&gt; Of course, nothing prevents you from building a REST application that\n&gt; follows the APP spec except that it doesn&#39;t use ASF for\n&gt; representations. Which might be the best application since sliced\n&gt; bread, but it wouldn&#39;t be APP... unless I&#39;m mistaken.\n\nWell I am happy to hear you say that RESTful applications using RDF  \ncould be cool. After all RDF stands for Resource Description  \nFramework. REST stands for Representation State Transfer. Web  \nArchitecture states that Resources have Representations... So the two  \nare pretty tightly related.\n\nIn short as Bill argues in another thread there are advantages with  \nan simple xml format such as atom over rdf, such as there being more  \npeople used to DOM and XSLT tools, and those being more battle  \ntested. But that is becoming less the case. XML crystalisations are  \nthe way to get the best of both worlds, but they are more difficult  \nto engineer. It may just be a matter of both communities  \nunderstanding each other better for this to work itself out....\n\nHenry\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt;\n&gt; Paul Winkler\n&gt; http://www.slinkp.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
