Maybe even an HTTP error message?  Then GET the resource a=\r\ngain.\n\n&gt; They might work -- it depends on how fast the orders are being\n&gt; p=\r\nrocessed and how reliable the delivery. =A0Notification-based\n&gt; systems ten=\r\nd to fail spectacularly at peak times, and are\n&gt; usually overkill during no=\r\nn-peak times. =A0 *shrug* =A0There&#39;s a\n&gt; good chance that you could build a=\r\n good enough system for family\n&gt; farms using nothing more than email.\n\nThat=\r\n&#39;s the way a lot of them that sell to local consumers work now.\nBut they ar=\r\ne herding into online markets, including several that I\nknow and help.\n\n&gt; =\r\n=A0Yes, a single inventory\n&gt; resource accessed by both sites should be fine=\r\n as long as the\n&gt; state changing requests are queued by the implementation.=\r\n\n&gt; The implementation of that resource could even be an atomic\n&gt; test+decre=\r\nment.\n\nYup.\n\nWonder if this would help?\nhttp://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/\n=\r\n\n&gt;=A0But how are you going to teach the markets\n&gt; to use such a resource?\n\n=\r\nSo far, not many markets, the people who run them often know each\nother, an=\r\nd might be taught to cooperate.\n\nBut we&#39;ll see.\n\n&gt; if you can make the mark=\r\nets use a shared resource that\n&gt; is much easier. =A0If not, then it should =\r\nalso be possible to\n&gt; automate a balancer even if the farmer&#39;s interface to=\r\n the\n&gt; markets is two different web pages. =A0 You could then provide\n&gt; the=\r\n farmer with mash-up interface that treats the markets as\n&gt; gateways.\n\nA re=\r\nasonable fall-back.
