I have had much good input \nfrom the discussions here so far, but one thing I need help with.\n\nBasically, I want the application to use Command and Query separation at \nits root. This means that clients call queries to get state/views out, \nthen perform commands on that which are sent back to the server. In \nother words, clients never ever send state back, only commands. So far I \nhave resources in my URI structure for the queries, which can be GET, \nand that works quite ok, but then I also have the commands in my URI \nstructure, such as:\n/user/123/inbox/createtask\nwhich when GET returns an empty JSON structure or HTML form, which can \nthen be filled in and POST&#39;ed back. There is a domain model on the \nserver which interprets and executes this and all the domain logic \naround it.\n\nBut from my reading of the &quot;RESTful web services&quot; this corresponds to \nthe REST/RPC hybrid architecture. It is difficult, at best, to do \ncaching of resources, since there is no POST/PUT/DELETE which explicitly \ncould be used to invalidate resource caches, such as that of \n/user/123/inbox. Using lastmodified/etags for caching works though.\n\nDoes anyone have experience building CQS-systems that have a more \nRESTful approach? How are others dealing with this?\n\nThanks,\n   Rickard\n\n"}}
