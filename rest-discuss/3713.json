Fielding wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I am going to make an argument otherwise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In section 5.2.1.1 of your dissertation, you open with:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any\n&gt; &gt; information that can be named can be a resource: ...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a\n&gt; &gt; URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user\n&gt; &gt; account).\n&gt;\n&gt; The URI identifies the resource, not the information that is\n&gt; sent in response to a GET on that resource.\n\nI used the term &quot;information&quot; because that is the term you used in\nthe quoted section of your dissertation.\n\n&gt; As such, I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand what you mean by abdicating the user account.\n\nIn the original email, you wrote:\n\n&gt; No, that is not against REST principles.  Access control and\n&gt; authorization\n&gt; are the normal way of doing user-specific services.\n\nIf HTTP Auth is used to make a user-specific service, the\nresulting &quot;resource&quot; is named using the combination of the URI\nand the username + password. The URI alone cannot be used to name\nthe &quot;resource&quot;. This means the &quot;resource&quot; is not a real resource.\nIt is not part of the global URI namespace.\n\nIf the user were willing to abdicate their entire user account,\nthey could use the &lt;userinfo&gt; part of the URI syntax to include\ntheir username + password in the URI. I am assuming that this is\nnot a viable option.\n\nAs a simple demonstration of this, note that it not feasible for\nyou to create hyperlinks to any of the &quot;resources&quot; in your online\nbank account. This is true despite the fact that you have access\nto these &quot;resources&quot;, using a normal WWW client. The failure of\nthis application to obey REST design principles has prevented the\nuser from sharing information in the normal WWW way.\n\n&gt; &gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.\n&gt; A server can and will take into account the entire request when\n&gt; determining which representation should be sent in response to\n&gt; a request, just as it does so for determining whether the response\n&gt; should be 200 or 401.\n\nThe &quot;resource&quot; that is the user-specific resource is not a\nresource. You seem to be saying that it is RESTful for the origin\nserver to say the resource is the conglomeration of all user&#39;s\nuser-specific resources. If you take this stance, you diminish the\npower of REST, since the web of resources is central to REST.\nMaking everything one big resource defeats this.\n\nThis argument is closely related to the REST argument against\nusing proprietary identifiers inside the body of a request. The\nREST view is that the URI is *THE* identifier. This is necessary\nto enable hyperlinks.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
