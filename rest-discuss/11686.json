Lack of interest? Lack of clear separation?\n&gt;&gt; Some other issue?\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;newbies&quot; didn&#39;t mind listening in on the (very) occasional\n&gt; advanced topic, and the gurus didn&#39;t mind answering newbie questions.\n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that either group&#39;s attitude has changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; If somebody wants to create the group though, feel free, I can&#39;t stop you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
