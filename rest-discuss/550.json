I spent quite a bit of time implementing\nthis last year at a previous company.\nOnly got to &#39;depth=1&#39; because I allowed for multiple sub-collections rather\nthan one default. And I was using SQL and didn&#39;t want a bazillion queries\nfired off for each event for each subscription.\nIt&#39;s one thing to define (fully) what the problem is, its another to specify\nwhat portion will be implemented and implement it.\n\n"}}
