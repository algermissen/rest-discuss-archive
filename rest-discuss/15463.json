This proxy will shield multiple backend servers from =\r\ndirect access by clients. Currently it is planned for the reverse proxy to =\r\ntranslate requests for\n\n  https://proxy.example.com/{bakend-server}/{path} =\r\n(1)\n\nto\n\n  http://{backend-server}.localdomain/{path} (2)\n\nAs you can see t=\r\nhe path of the URL is altered by the proxy.\n\nI wonder how hypermedia can be=\r\n used in a RESTful way in such a setting. URIs in resource represenations f=\r\nor a client must be in form (1). The client must not know anything about th=\r\ne backend servers. So a resoure representation can not be in form (2). But =\r\na backend servers should only know about form (2).\n\nExample:\n\nResource repr=\r\nesenation as seen on a backend server:\n\n  {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;some resource&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:=\r\n &quot;http://foo.localdomain/path/for/resource&quot;} (3)\n\nResource representation a=\r\ns needed by a client:\n\n  {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;some resource&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;http://proxy.ex=\r\nample.com/foo/path/for/resource&quot;} (4)\n\nWhere in the whole setup is represen=\r\nation (3) translated into form (4)\nand back again?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nLut=\r\nz\n\n\n"}}
