Define Client MIME header:\n transaction: yes\n\n2. Define Server MIME header:\n transaction-location: http://controlURL\n\n3. Client makes HTTP requests with transaction\nheader.  If the server can accomplish the request,\nit responds with ACCEPTED and a\ntransaction-location header.\n\n4. If client wants to rollback the transaction,\nit posts ROLLBACK to all the\ntransaction-locations.  If the client wants to\ncommit the transaction, it posts PREPARE to all\nthe transaction-locations.  If any return\nan error then it posts ROLLBACK to all of them\nand the transaction fails.  If none return an\nerror, the client posts COMMIT to all the\ntransaction-locations and the transaction\nsucceeds.\n\nRESTful and transactional without all of SOAP&#39;s\nplumbing.\n\nStrawman SMTP:\nOn Fri, 2 May 2003, Berend de Boer wrote:\n&gt; 1. Transactions (one or more messages within a transaction get there\n&gt;    all or none).\n&gt; 2. Guaranteed delivery (+ error handling in case of timeouts).\n\n1. Send messages with a transaction header and a\nmessage-id header. e.g.\n\n Transaction: yes\n Message-id: abc123@....1234\n From: dsn-recipient@...\n\n insert foo into bar\n\n2. To commit send a multipart/digest with subject:\nCOMMIT and each part with a RFC2017 external-body\ncontent type, e.g.:\n\n From: dsn-recipient@...\n Message-id: abc123@....1234\n Subject: COMMIT\n Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundar=abc\n\n --abc\n content-type: external-body; access-type=url;\n   URL=&quot;mid:message-id_1&quot;\n\n --abc\n content-type: external-body; access-type=url;\n   URL=&quot;mid:message-id_2&quot;\n\n --abc--\n\nMessage is processed (and in order) only if all\nexternal-bodies are present.\n\nNote: This protocol nests.  The commit message may\nitself have a transaction: yes header in which\ncase it waits until someone commits the commmit.\n\n&gt; 3. Notification of delivery.\n\nSee RFC1891: Delivery Service Notifications\n\n&gt; 4. Guaranteed order of delivery.\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; 5. Priorization.\n\nI am not sure what this means, but I suspect you\ndon&#39;t want it because it violates the End-To-End\nprinciple.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS The above protocols are entirely strawmen made\nto make a point and set us on the road to\nindustrial stength variants.  Please be gentle.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
