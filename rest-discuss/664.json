We may need to define\na hack like that for getting around firewalls too. But first you define\nthe protocol properly and then you figure out what you need to hack.\n\n&gt; Is KnowNow abusing HTTP?\n\nYes! Any solution that involves one-byte stay-alive messages is a hack!\n\nBut my understanding (and observation) is that *within* the hacked\nsocket KnowNow uses regular HTTP messages, not chunked MIME data. I want\nto emulate what they do within the hack, not the hack.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
