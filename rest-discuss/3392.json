Browsing through the archive it seems you need a\n&gt; kludge to do that.\n\ncorrect.\n\n&gt; 1. If so, what technique is preferable? Hidden field? URL rewriting?\n\nif you mean rewriting to include the method, as in ?method=foo then \nthat is NOT preferable because it results in a GET with side-effects; \nGETs are supposed to be idempotent.\n\nfrequently, POST and PUT are not applicable to the same resource (at \nleast in my experience), so you can overload POST to do what you want.  \ni pre-process such POST requests on the server (this is arguably an \nintermediary in REST nomenclature) to call PUT code instead.\n\ndelete can be done with a hidden (or submit) form field.\n\n&gt; 2. Do browsers support it after all??\n\nonly via XMLHttpRequest.\n\nHTH,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
