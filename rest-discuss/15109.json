For example, HTML&#39;s processing rules apply regardless of what Web application a browsers interacts with.\n\nUser agents can provide configuration options that allow controlling the actual behavior regarding the processing rules. For example, most browsers allow us to turn off the automatic image downloading.\n\nOne the user agent&#39;s component for handling the given media type is done with applying the processing rules it reaches a steady state and hands control to the next layer.\n\nThe differentiation between human and machine client really only applies *after* the steady state has been reached. Before that it is all automatic, media type specific processing rules.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
