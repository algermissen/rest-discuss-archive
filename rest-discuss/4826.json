I think it would be\nenough to split resource metadata in to its own resource.\n\n&gt; The issue with this is that there are no standard headers that allow for \n&gt; negotiations of variations on\n&gt; MIME types, just for negotiations of the MIME type as such. I would \n&gt; actually also need such a\n&gt; capability for RDF representations: sometimes I want all statements \n&gt; about the GETed resource, sometimes\n&gt; I only want for example the statements that tell me what rdfs:label the \n&gt; resource has.\n\nContinuing from above, maybe &#39;Variations on MIME types&#39; here\nbasically constitutes variation on the resources involved,\nbecause there is a difference between the resource data and\nthe resource metadata.\n\nI find it easier to cope with this problem by just sticking\nresource metadata in a subordinate resource.\n\nPaul James described a similar thought process recently;\nyou might find it helpful:\nhttp://www.peej.co.uk/thinking/2005/01/restification\n\n&gt; Or is that an inappropriate use of conneg anyhow?\n\nI haven&#39;t needed conneg so far, because I make every\nrepresentation a resource with its own URI. e.g.\n\n/foo/html\n/foo/html_form\n/foo/pdf\n/foo/xml\n\n"}}
