DELETE is idempotent \n&gt; and therefore deleting something once or deleting something a \n&gt; thousand times is the same operation. I&#39;m not sure where people got \n&gt; the idea that there&#39;s something wrong with deleting something twice \n&gt; because that&#39;s never ever been true of HTTP and in fact most systems \n&gt; that expose a delete operation (eg databases, file systems, tuple \n&gt; spaces, g-indexes, maps). Further, there is no logical discontinuity \n&gt; between this behavior and the meaning of a delete request. I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure why some people want to make this more complicated than it is, \n&gt; but I think it&#39;s clear to the majority.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - itdp\n\nI don&#39;t want to play any part in complicating things that are\nobvious.  Still, that doesn&#39;t rule out modelling simple things\nabout HTTP, because the simpler models serve as the foundation\nfor exploring some of the more complex and controversial issues.\nAnd also for reasoning correctly about extensions.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
