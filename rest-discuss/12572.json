Obviously you can store state on\n&gt;  &gt; the se=\r\nrver on behalf of the client, but the interaction with the server\n&gt;  &gt; is d=\r\netermined by the client which must know what it is doing.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s th=\r\ne server&#39;s duty to reject invalid commands down from invalid\n&gt;  &gt; verbs to =\r\ninvalid queries, state changes, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; But if the logic is in the client=\r\n, then how could the server know if a\n&gt; state change is good or not? The se=\r\nrver wouldn&#39;t know how the client\n&gt; came to its conclusion about the sugges=\r\nted new state, and so cannot\n&gt; enforce validaton rules about the new state.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; So I don&#39;t see that &quot;maintenance and security&quot; problem. You always=\r\n have\n&gt;  &gt; to validate external input, the web is no different.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ma=\r\nintenance issue is that if I put all logic in the client I *have*\n&gt; to ensu=\r\nre that all clients are up-to-date, or else I will have clients\n&gt; with diff=\r\nerent versions accessing the same server, creating all sorts of\n&gt; inconsist=\r\nent state. With the security I will have trouble knowing\n&gt; whether the clie=\r\nnt sends state changes that are ok from a security\n&gt; perspective as I don&#39;t=\r\n know *how* they arrived at their state changes,\n&gt; and I will also have to =\r\nsend more data to the client than I want,\n&gt; because the logic is done on th=\r\ne client (if it was on the server then\n&gt; the client would only need the min=\r\nimal data needed to create the\n&gt; command, which is easier to secure).\n&gt; \n\nD=\r\noesn&#39;t HATEOAS solve this problem to some degree?  From a versioning \npersp=\r\nective you can use conneg and versioned media types to know what \ntypes of =\r\nclients are sending you data and what version of the format \nthey are sendi=\r\nng.\n\n From a security perspective, since the Server inserts the traversable=\r\n \nstates, it is controlling what can be executed next.  Craig mentioned \nth=\r\nis as a key advantage to HATEOAS in the &quot;WHy HATEOAS&quot; thread a couple \nof w=\r\neeks ago.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecen=\r\ntral.com\n\n\n"}}
