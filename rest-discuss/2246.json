What\n&gt; I need to see are some specific cases of firewall configuration\n&gt; and method abuse to better understand.\n\nI&#39;ve been suspicious of this myself.  I&#39;ve heard two different issues\nwith regards to RPC vs. REST security issues:\n\n1.  That a firewall can be configured to allow only the HTTP methods\nthat the administrator considers safe for a user (e.g., no POSTs from\ncertain users etc.)\n\n2.  RPC is more prone to issue like buffer-overrun problems that would\nrequire a more diligent security analysis.  But it seems to me that\nsimilar problems could potentially exist with POSTed data no matter\nwhat style is used.\n\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s underspecified at all.  Why do you believe it\n&gt;&gt; is?\n\n&gt; Having just read that part of the spec again, I don&#39;t, actually.  But\n&gt; that pushes me to a different conclusion: that the semantics of POST\n&gt; are being misrepresented on this mail list to include careful craftings\n&gt; of remote procedure calls in which the instructions have &#39;representations&#39;\n&gt; that pass the &#39;representational state&#39; test (which is a null test),\n&gt; and so appear to be &#39;state transfers&#39; but are not.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll give an example\n&gt;\n&gt; Request:\n&gt; PUT /some/number\n&gt; 2\n&gt;\n&gt; Response:\n&gt; 201 Created\n&gt;\n&gt; Request:\n&gt; GET /some/number\n&gt;\n&gt; Response:\n&gt; 200 OK\n&gt; 2\n\nAs for the squaring action, one possibility could be:\n\nRequest:\nPOST /squarer\n/some/number\n\nResponse:\n200 OK\n4\n\nI think it would be stretching the intended meaning of &#39;subordinate&#39; to claim\nthat\nthe name of an action was a subordinate resource in the original POST.\n\n\n\n"}}
