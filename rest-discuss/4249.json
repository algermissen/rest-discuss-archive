The URI /customer/5 is\nissued by the authority of the server, and the client should not try to\ninterpret it.\n\nIf you don&#39;t hold to that maxim, then you have to encode what &#39;5&#39; is\nreferring to on both sides of the coin.\n\nIf you own both sides of the connection, it may be a manageable issue... but\neven when you do, you probably want to treat the URI as opaquely as you\ncan for consistency and growth reasons.\n\n[For instance, you may want to rename and map /customer/5 to /user/jsled\n ... now you not only have to modify the client to understand to pull\n a text string [not a number] at a different place in the string [/user\n vs. /customer], but you also have to modify the server side to handle\n both cases.]\n\n| The next question is a doubt that I&#39;ve had for a while:\n| See: http://drupal.org/node/view/5816\n| \n| According to RFC 2396, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, Page\n| 14, section 3.4,\n| --\n| Within a query component, the characters &quot;;&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;&&quot;, &quot;=&quot;,\n| &quot;+&quot;,\n| &quot;,&quot;, and &quot;$&quot; are reserved.\n| --\n| \n| Which means that the &quot;/&quot; character when it appears in the Query Component has\n| to\n| be escaped. Right?\n\nHmm.  The RFC appears inconsistent in that section.  From the BNF:\n\nrelativeURI   = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]\nhier_part     = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]\n[...]\nquery         = *uric\n[...]\nuric          = reserved | unreserved | escaped\nreserved      = &quot;;&quot; | &quot;/&quot; | &quot;?&quot; | &quot;:&quot; | &quot;@&quot; | &quot;&&quot; | &quot;=&quot; | &quot;+&quot; |\n                &quot;$&quot; | &quot;,&quot;\nunreserved    = alphanum | mark\nmark          = &quot;-&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;.&quot; | &quot;!&quot; | &quot;~&quot; | &quot;*&quot; | &quot;&#39;&quot; |\n                &quot;(&quot; | &quot;)&quot;\nescaped       = &quot;%&quot; hex hex\n\nIn practice, &#39;/&#39; is passed around in queries without incident all over\nthe place.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
