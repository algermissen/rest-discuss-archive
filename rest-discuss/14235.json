What about the\n&gt; other two? The first one is a huge set of metadata and the second one\n&gt; is a huge set of metadata with extra client information: updates to\n&gt; the each client resource will affect this resource - loss of\n&gt; visibility?\n&gt; \n\nNo, what the server does is supposed to be opaque behind a uniform\ninterface.  Don&#39;t worry about visibility beyond the uniform interface\n-- the server can do whatever it wants.  Besides, if you&#39;re defining a\nresource as a list of links to client-specific resources, plus client\ninformation derived from those client-specific resources, then the fact\nthat changing a client-specific resource may change the resource up one\nlevel in a hierarchy should be readily apparent.  But that&#39;s usability,\nnot invisibility.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If, in the second option, every client has its own rel=&quot;self&quot; link,\n&gt; then there is no such loss?\n&gt; \n\nMy rule of thumb, is not to use rel=&#39;self&#39; unless you need it\nprogramatically, for some reason.  In case the document is saved\nwithout its original request URI, it should still work, which is why I\nlike to use a &lt;base&gt; or xml:base href, plus relative URLs within the\ndocument.  If the document is loaded from disk using the &#39;file://&#39; URI\nscheme, it leads the user right back into the flow of the application.\nSo I don&#39;t see much purpose for rel=&#39;self&#39;.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
