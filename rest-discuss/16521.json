It&#39;s definitely a=\r\n best\n&gt; practice such as brushing your teeth after every meal is.  But I th=\r\nink the\n&gt; notion that if you&#39;re doing REST over the Web (HTTP +Internet) - =\r\nI still\n&gt; have challenges even understanding that - and your type is not re=\r\ngistered in\n&gt; IANA (as it would seem that registering in IANA is the only f=\r\norm of\n&gt; standardization), it is not REST is where there is a discussion.  =\r\nIf two\n&gt; parties agree on a standard and use it over the web pre registerin=\r\ng it in\n&gt; IANA, I don&#39;t see how this disqualifies the solution as not being=\r\n REST (even\n&gt; if it&#39;s violating a best practice).\n&gt;\n\nStandardization !=3D R=\r\negistration\n\nStandardization is generally needed when people have differing=\r\n implementations/api&#39;s for the same thing - a media type doesn&#39;t really nee=\r\nd standardized unless this is the case.\n\nRegistration however is an entirel=\r\ny different matter, registration puts things in the global (or internet wid=\r\ne) scope, and is there to both stop naming collisions (we both say our spec=\r\n is text/foo) and to provide a registry of media types + specs which one ca=\r\nn consult in the various contexts where you&#39;d want to do this.\n\nAs for usin=\r\ng only IANA registered media types, this certainly isn&#39;t a constraint of RE=\r\nST, nor of HTTP.\n\nREST mentions the use of Media Types for obvious reasons,=\r\n and then goes on to recognise &quot;Some of the namespaces are governed by sepa=\r\nrate Internet standards and shared by multiple protocols (e.g., URI schemes=\r\n [21], media types [48]&quot; - i.e. IANA. It does not constrain to using regist=\r\nered media types though, and cannot.\n\nHTTP and HTTPbis both specify &quot;Use of=\r\n non-registered media types is discouraged.&quot;, not prohibited, not MUST NOT,=\r\n not even SHOULD NOT.\n\nUse of non-registered media types cannot be stopped,=\r\n primarily because the specs need to allow new media types to be used, and =\r\nto go through registration - a good example would be opensearch&#39;s custom me=\r\ndia type which is pending registration but widely used.\n\nHowever, like Mike=\r\n Amundsen and a few others I&#39;d be very keen to see this conversation move o=\r\nn to why it&#39;s discouraged, and moreover some guidance as to when is a good =\r\ntime to start working on a new media type vs when&#39;s a bad time.\n\nBest (and =\r\nhello, first post!),\n\nNathan\n\n\n\n"}}
