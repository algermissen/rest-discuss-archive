If someone else thinks there was\n&gt;&gt; actually consensus on this point please let the AtomPub editor know \n&gt;&gt; about\n&gt;&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, AtomPub&#39;s consensus doesn&#39;t matter. What you&#39;re saying is that\n&gt; there&#39;s no way for an Atom client to decide that an entry doesn&#39;t need\n&gt; a summary anymore. Broken.\nPUT ... &lt;summary/&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Personally I like PATCH for clarity but worry about deployment\n&gt;&gt; issues with intermediaries and libraries that even today think &quot;all the\n&gt;&gt; world&#39;s a GET&quot;.  My next choice would be a POST with a standard delta \n&gt;&gt; update\n&gt;&gt; MIME type to the resource, though that&#39;s a fallback position \n&gt;&gt; obviously.  I\n&gt;&gt; look forward to seeing James Snell&#39;s proposed RFC on the subject.  \n&gt;&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; XML deltas are incredibly complicated.\nWhat about a simple &quot;overwrite if element present&quot; delta MIME type that \nhandles the 80% case that everybody seems to want?\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Unset&quot; suggests that the message, by leaving stuff out, is requesting\n&gt;&gt; that said stuff be explicitly set to something (like a default).\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it doesn&#39;t. See the behavior of Apache when you send a PUT request\n&gt; containing an Atom entry. For &quot;unset&quot; to mean anything else, shared\n&gt; state would be required.\n&gt;\nApache&#39;s ETag support is also borked (or was); should we use Apache as \nthe reference for ETags?\n\nJust sayin&#39;.\n\n\n\n"}}
