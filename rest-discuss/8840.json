(notice the I in URI :-) )\n\nImagine th=\r\ne client want&#39;s to change the charge to the Marketing  \ndepartment instead.=\r\n Now the strings &quot;Sales&quot; and &quot;Marketing&quot; should  \nprobably not be considere=\r\nd unique, they are like &quot;Peter Lacey&quot; -  \nthere could be two with the same =\r\nname (although a company with two  \nMarketing department probably would hav=\r\ne other issues to deal with..)\n\nSo the client could PUT /users/placey/expen=\r\nses/123\n\n&gt; &lt;ExpenseReport xml:base=3D&quot;http://example.com/expenses&quot;\n&gt; xmlns:=\r\nxlink=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;Submitter xlink:href=3D=93http=\r\n://employees.example.com/placey=94&gt;Peter\n&gt; Lacey&lt;/Submitter&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;ChargeTo =\r\nxlink:href=3D=93/departments/marketing=94 /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;ExpenseItem&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;Date&gt;=\r\n2007-06-01&lt;/Date&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;Description&gt;Airfare&lt;/Description&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;Amount&gt;50=\r\n0.34&lt;/Amount&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/ExpenseItem&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/ExpenseReport&gt;\n\nNotice how the content=\r\n of ChargeTo is empty, this is the part that  \nshould be thrown away in my =\r\nopinion, as you don&#39;t want the client&#39;s  \nto be updating stuff at /departme=\r\nnts/marketing when PUT-ing to /users/ \nplacey/expenses/123. Similary, the n=\r\name behind http:// \nemployees.example.com/placey would not be updated, for =\r\nmany reason,  \nthe simplest being that to you wouldn&#39;t know what is the las=\r\ntname and  \nfirstname anymore.\n\n\nI am in (minority, I guess) favour of part=\r\nial PUTs (or should it be  \nPOSTs?), ie the client shouldn&#39;t HAVE to submit=\r\n the whole  \nrepresentation back:\n\nPUT /users/placey/expenses/123\n&gt; &lt;Expens=\r\neReport xmlns:xlink=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;ChargeTo xlink=\r\n:href=3D=93/departments/marketing=94 /&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;ExpenseItem&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;Desc=\r\nription&gt;Networking&lt;/Description&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/ExpenseItem&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/ExpenseReport&gt;\n\n\n=\r\nwould change so that Marketing is charged, and the description is now  \nmuc=\r\nh more subtle &quot;Networking&quot; (You met some old friend on the plane)\n\nHere the=\r\nre is no question about changing the Submitter, but as long  \nas it would b=\r\ne the URI that is the important part, it should be  \nslightly more robust t=\r\nhan the value (Say you updated your name to  \n&quot;Peter S. Lacey&quot; meanwhile)\n\n=\r\n\nIn my system I&#39;m extending this so that several fields support  \narbitrary=\r\n URIs, which means the client might not have to re-publish  \ndata for every=\r\n service.
