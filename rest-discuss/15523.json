In this case I am imagining I have a Jobs&#92;Pending resource. I do a get on that resource and get back a list of jobs that are pending to be processed. Now each Job has rules that have to execute. So in this world, I am thinking the rules are links with each link point to a resource that handles processing that rule. Or maybe the link returns me some code that gets executed on the fly.\n\nThat is the mobile code style (part of REST), where the user agent functionality is extended by transferring code as part of the response. The precondition is of course that the user agent understands the language and can execute the code in a meaningful way.\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Anyway the advantage I saw in such a system is my the institutions that work with me can create any arbitrary set of rules they like. My which processes jobs doesn&#39;t know anything about the rules or care. All it knows it that is has some URI that it can post to (or possibly Get) in order to execute some arbitrary logic. I now have an autonomous system that can easily adapt to new requirements. I am truly reaping the benefits of HATEOS in such a system.\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thoughts?\n\nBeware that you are ok as long as you only control the user agent. Once you start controlling client side aspects beyond the agent, you introduce a coupling between client side apps and the server side code.\n\nThe hypermedia constraint applies to what the user agent does, only. Not what the user does. JavaScript is only controlling my browser - not, for example, whether I open or close my eyes or take a zip from my coffee.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
