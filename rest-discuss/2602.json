The site publishes the renaming\n&gt; and the client doesn&#39;t have to be adjusted.\n\nThere isn&#39;t a filtering algorithm. There is a declarative &quot;filter&quot; like \na SQL select statement but expressed in terms of semantic web \ntechnologies, resolved through web dereferences and typically executed \non the client side.\n\nMaybe the semantic web technologies could be extended to support query \nparameter renaming and subtyping: I don&#39;t personally know whether the \nconcept fits naturally into the formalisms underlying the semantic web \nor not. I only know what exists now. I know how to do property renaming \nand subtyping. I don&#39;t know how to do parameter renaming or even \nparameter construction -- except as standard string manipulation.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; If the data set is reasonably large, it will probably be chunked & so it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t know the complete scope of information. That scope is implied and\n&gt; not explicit. Unless the representation of that resource says &#39;this is a\n&gt; portion of available information and there are more bits here and here&#39;.\n\nSounds like a good use for hypertext!\n\n&gt; Now we&#39;re talking... I&#39;m all for discovery via enumeration, but I want to\n&gt; explore what reasonable approaches are when enumeration is not practical.\n\nQuery parameters! Nobody ever said that enumeration is always practical. \nThat&#39;s why query parameters exist.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
