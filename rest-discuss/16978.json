I am a java guy, so perhaps Java has much better apis for handling \nthese things, but it seems to me it&#39;s easy enough to parse and check the \nrel=, the element name, or the atom:link element. Are there some languages \nthat make this tedious and thus this is the reason why some prefer one way \nover the other?\n\nI personally prefer the &lt;link rel=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot;/&gt; format. It&#39;s very \nsimilar to Atom:link and can easily be an atom:link with minor changes. I&#39;ve \nnot heard of the link header tho, is that something new, or just another \nhttp header that can be used?\n\nI am still struggling to understand when to use different media types \ncorrectly. If the API I am providing provides a unique solution, but I am \nreturning chunks of xml (or json) that represent a specific resource, do all \nthese different resources that belong to the overall API use the same media \ntype, or should they use different media types, one for each resource? I \nmean, if I have /users, /orders, /sellers and /bids, should I be using \nsomething like application/vnd.com.mycompany.orders+xml for /orders? I&#39;ve \nresorted back to using application/xml and application/json for the \nconvenience, but I am not opposed to using application specific or even \nresource specific media types if that is a best practices that the REST \ncommunity at large is leaning towards.\n\n\n\n--- On Tue, 11/30/10, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Link relations [was: A media type for case \nfiles, dossiers and documents]\nTo: &quot;Erlend Hamnaberg&quot; &lt;ngarthl@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Trygve Laugstøl&quot; &lt;trygvis@...&gt;, &quot;Peter Williams&quot; \n&lt;pezra@...&gt;, &quot;Jørn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;, &quot;Rest \nDiscussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nDate: Tuesday, November 30, 2010, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;snip&gt;Regardless if we use atom:link or Link header we should help \nadding new useful link relations to the registry so we can have a common \nunderstanding of what they mean.&lt;/snip&gt;\n\nContributing to the link relation registry has recently become rather easy: \nhttp://paramsr.us/link-relation-types/\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 13:21, Erlend Hamnaberg &lt;ngarthl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink headers is a great way of adding hypertext to media types that already \nexist.\nAn example:\nGET /image/123Host: example.com\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OKLink: &lt;http://example.com/usages/123&gt;; \nrel=http://relations.example.com/usage\n\n\nI would not use Link headers if I was minting a new media-type, as I believe \nthe links should be close to the thing i&#39;m linking from.\nRegardless if we use atom:link or Link header we should help adding new \nuseful link relations to the registry so we can have a common understanding \nof what they mean.\n\n\n\nBest regards--\nErlend\nOn Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 7:07 PM, Trygve Laugstøl &lt;trygvis@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      On 11/30/10 6:38 PM, Peter Williams wrote:\n\n&gt; 2010/11/30 Trygve Laugstøl&lt;trygvis@...&gt;:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I would go for atom:link as I hope that everyone will converge on using\n\n&gt;&gt; atom:link [1]. The main advantage as I see it is that they will have\n\n&gt;&gt; less to learn and that we will will converge on a more stable set of\n\n&gt;&gt; relations which in turn will make it possible to create more generic\n\n&gt;&gt; code for indexing, crawling etc. Just make sure you create and define\n\n&gt;&gt; your own rel types according to the atom spec [2].\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Personally i don&#39;t much like atom:link.  It trades clarity for a false\n\n&gt; promise of re-use.  The idea that a great deal of leverage will be\n\n&gt; gained by reusing atom:link in other formats seems not be born out in\n\n&gt; reality.  Parsing arbitrary xml documents, looking for link elements\n\n&gt; and then doing things with them without understanding the semantics of\n\n&gt; the overall representation sounds pretty far fetched to me.  (Is that\n\n&gt; edit link for the requested resource, or is it for a different\n\n&gt; resource whose information is contained in the requested one.)\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; The `&lt;{name} href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;` pattern promotes the meaningful name of the\n\n&gt; item to the highest possible level.  This increases the clarity of the\n\n&gt; representation.  As a client writer i care about semantics of the\n\n&gt; various parts of the representations far more than i care about their\n\n&gt; types.  I can guess with little effort that an element named &#39;edit&#39;\n\n&gt; will contain a link.  With a link element i must scan to the right\n\n&gt; until i find the @rel in order to understand the purpose of the\n\n&gt; element.  I&#39;ll take clarity over vague, unrealistic, promises of\n\n&gt; re-use any day.\n\n\n\nTo me &lt;atom:link rel=&quot;{name}&quot; href=&quot;&quot;/&gt; is equal to &lt;{name} href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;.\n\n\n\n&gt; Besides, we have the link header[1] which is better, in every\n\n&gt; imaginable way, than atom:link for expressing common relations.  It\n\n&gt; does not require the client be able to parse a particular format and\n\n&gt; it unambiguously relates the link to the requested resource as a\n\n&gt; whole.\n\n &gt;\n\n&gt; [1]:&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988&gt;\n\n\n\nLink headers is mostly useful for linking *entire resources* to other\n\n*resources* while atom:link gives you a more fine grained linking\n\nmechanism. I&#39;m not against link headers in anyway, just saying it&#39;s a\n\nslightly different thing.\n\n\n\n--\n\nTrygve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
