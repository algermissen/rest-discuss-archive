If exposing e=\r\nntities is a 1-to-1 XML serialization of the objects your system uses inter=\r\nnally then you cannot change your system without the risk of breaking the c=\r\nlients. \n\nIf, on the other hand, you first transform your internal objects =\r\nto a intermediate object type and serialize that, then you can make interna=\r\nl changes to your entities, while updating the transformation, such that th=\r\ne result is stable on the outside.\n\nOf course, you don&#39;t have to serialize =\r\nany kind of objects, it might as well be filling out templates MVC-style wi=\r\nth data from your entities. Or any other transformation from entities to a =\r\nstable public format.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Dan Ha=\r\nywood &lt;dan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 28/09/2011 13:29, Jorn Wildt wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The only thing I read was that figuring out which links\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to expos=\r\ne (from an authorization viewpoint) is difficult to do.
