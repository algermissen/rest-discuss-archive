I \n&gt; think the \n&gt; &gt; HTML5 WG came up with a brilliant solution for a similar \n&gt; problem, i.e. \n&gt; &gt; that of defining HTML5 as an abstract DOM and then defining \n&gt; different \n&gt; &gt; serializations for it.  Similarly I think we might want to consider \n&gt; &gt; focusing on defining a SOM (Service Object Model) and only \n&gt; later worry \n&gt; &gt; about the exact serializations of it. Does that not work \n&gt; with what you were saying?\n&gt; \n&gt; Go a step backward into the HTML5 conceptual model:\n&gt; 1.  Forms should support all HTML verbs.\n&gt; 2.  Elements for specific content types like audio and video.\n&gt; 3.  Should be possible to break document into sections.\n&gt; And so forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those are the things we need to decide on first, before we \n&gt; even get to create an abstract model.  \n\nSo rather than use an analogy, what specific things do you think we need to\ndecide on first related to RESTful web services?\n\n&gt; We might even have \n&gt; several abstract models, maybe one is optimized for tooling \n&gt; and another for people, one for static languages another for \n&gt; dynamic languages.  Each abstract model can have different \n&gt; serializations.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t sound like it is needed. Sure, some use cases might use\nattributes that others don&#39;t but it seems to me that there really is one a\nneed for one abstract model. Can you give concrete examples that would\nindicate otherwise?\n\n&gt; XML Schema allows you to specify the structure of a document. \n&gt;  It has an abstract model, from which you get XML \n&gt; serialization, Java API, RDF representation, etc.  RelaxNG is \n&gt; also a language that allows you to specify the structure of \n&gt; the document.  Turns out there are some things you can say in \n&gt; XML Schema but not in RelaxNG and vice versa.\n&gt; Their abstract models are not identical, we can&#39;t say one is \n&gt; a serialization of the other.  But they both have a similar \n&gt; enough conceptual model that, if I need to describe a given \n&gt; service, I can choose either one (or both).\n&gt; \n&gt; DocBook allows you to specify the structure of a document.  \n&gt; You can list sections in a particular order, and you can \n&gt; group sections into larger sections.  But that&#39;s a \n&gt; fundamentally different conceptual model than XML Schema or \n&gt; RelaxNG.  For one, XML Schema is separate from the document \n&gt; it describes, DocBook is self-describing; for another, XML \n&gt; Schema is good at describing which address fields are \n&gt; mandatory in a purchase order, DocBook not so.\n&gt; \n&gt; From what I&#39;m hearing, some people expect the description \n&gt; language to be an XML Schema/RelaxNG of sort, while others \n&gt; expect it to be DocBook.  That&#39;s the first thing we need to \n&gt; nail, the conceptual model.  There are obviously more details \n&gt; to it, more points of contention, I&#39;m just using this as example.\n\nThen, rather than debating about what to debate, why not make some\nsuggestions as to what abstract model would be from your perspective?\n\nAlan Dean made a good start with DSD [1] though I think it needs a different\ndiscovery model; I proposed [2] using a combination of robots.txt, HTTP\nheaders, and HTML headers. Why don&#39;t we discuss those specifics?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://simplewebservices.org/index.php?title=Domain_Service_Discovery\n[2] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10211\n\n\n"}}
