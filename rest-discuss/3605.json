Where the mapping is problematic, it&#39;s not a\n&gt; &gt; failing of REST, it&#39;s it working as planned; it tells you that your app\n&gt; &gt; probably has issues, and what they may be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm... this would imply to me that any application can be done RESTfully if\n&gt; refactored enough.  First, is this true?\n\nSure, but that&#39;s not REST-specific.\n\n&gt;  Second, is this always ideal?\n\nOf course not.\n\nIMO, REST is the best available description of a &quot;good Web app&quot;.  My\nresponse above was just saying that if you&#39;re building a Web app, and it\nisn&#39;t RESTful, that REST tells you what problems to expect (e.g.\ncookies = less visibility and application state issues (i.e. back\nbutton problems)).  That&#39;s not making a value judgement on whether or\nnot your app should or shouldn&#39;t be RESTful, it&#39;s just saying that if it\nisn&#39;t, there&#39;s a downside.  There may very well be an upside to not\nbeing RESTful for some Web apps.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
