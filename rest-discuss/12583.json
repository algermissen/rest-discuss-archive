One is to have the cancel state as part of the order. \nTHen I can just put a new representation with the cancelled state set to \ntrue:\n\nPUT /orders/333\ncontent-type: application/xml\n\n&lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;cancelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n...\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\nSeems kinda heavy to me.\n\nWould it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that you could put \nor post to to change the state?\n\n/orders/333/cancelled\n\nor\n\n/orders/333?cancel=true\n\nYou don&#39;t even need to send data to change the state in this scenario. \nBut the problem with this from a pure RESTful standpoint is, isn&#39;t this \na mini-RPC?  My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n\n.... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n\n&lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;atom:link rel=&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/orders/333/cancelled&quot;/&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\n\nNow, I have a CANCEL link that if I follow changes the state of my \nresource.  Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a link. \nMaybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by itself, \nbut when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
