If it&#39;s a web app then the arguments belong\n&gt; in the domain of the app, which is the POST body.\n\nAh, ok, I follow now.  You want to do this from a browser, so you&#39;re\nstuck with application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Got it.\n\nIdeally, you&#39;d just post the URI (as text/uri), or some XML description\nof the characteristics of the watch you&#39;re doing, to the container that\nhouses the list of current watchers.  But because you&#39;re doing it from\na browser, you&#39;re stuck needing a name for the URI.  But I suggest that\n&quot;Reply-To&quot; is unnecessary, in case, as I did, somebody thought that the\nname was required in order to trigger a watch.  It isn&#39;t, all that&#39;s\nrequired is the URI, so you could just have had;\n\n  &quot;uri=http://...&quot;\n\n&gt; &gt; If so, the header there works quite differently\n&gt; &gt; than just &quot;Reply-To&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Explain?\n\nJust like I said here;\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/47\n\nThe active header is &quot;Properties&quot; (from DAV), plus the extension is\nreally the &quot;watch&quot; modifier of it that says we&#39;re looking at the\nwatch property.\n\n&gt; &gt; I also prefer the new method.  A practical reason is that the meaning is\n&gt; &gt; more obvious, especially to most firewalls that permit blocking based\n&gt; &gt; on methods.  None I know of can follow a hypertext transaction to\n&gt; &gt; understand what you&#39;re really doing with GET, follow-header, PUT/POST,\n&gt; &gt; etc..  Though there&#39;s no reason that they can&#39;t, they don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the best reason not to do it as a web app -- that it requires a fairly\n&gt; complex combination of elements.  The counter argument is that REST says that we\n&gt; get less overall complexity by inventing new nouns and reusing existing verbs\n&gt; than by inventing new verbs.\n\nNo, REST doesn&#39;t say that.  It&#39;s only recommendation wrt creating new\nmethods is that you understand that you&#39;re forgoing the use of existing\nand possible future optimizations created around existing methods.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
