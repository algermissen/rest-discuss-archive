If you PUT, you change the resource state.\n* application state:  (&quot;hypermedia is the engine of...&quot;) described by\nhyperlinks in representations of resources from the server, navigated\nby the client.\n* session state: in REST, known only to the client.\n\nI think this thread so far has been about resource state, not application state.\n\nMight be more kinds, and better explanations. I went looking for a\ncanonical explanation of the kinds and differences.\nAnybody got a good reference?\n\n"}}
