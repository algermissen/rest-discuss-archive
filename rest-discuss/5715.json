Now, provided that both hosts have access to a chunk of\n&gt; shared memory, a cookie containing an index / key into this shared\n&gt; memory space can be set on a client machine. This shared memory space\n&gt; could be anything from a simple file on a network filesystem to a full\n&gt; blown, linda-like tuplespace. In any case, the data indexed by the\n&gt; clients&#39; cookie may indicate whether a user has logged in or any  \n&gt; number\n&gt; of other related bits such as user preferences, etc.\n&gt;\nIn my case, the goal is simply to authenticate the user making a  \nrequest. I can then determine what roles the user has, and what  \npermissions those roles imply. Those permissions will then determine  \nwhat that request will be allowed to do. We store all this users,  \nroles, and permissions information in a shared relational database  \nand cache some of it in the servers&#39; memory.\n\n&gt; There are a number of variations on the above scheme, depending on the\n&gt; technologies used, but the basic idea remains the same. A more elegant\n&gt; appproach would be to have this shared memory space itself be a web\n&gt; server, exposing this functionality as a service via a RESTful\n&gt; interface. Actaully, the use of cookies turns out to be more of a\n&gt; hinderance than anything else, as it limits the usefulness of the\n&gt; approach to hosts within the same domain. Using dynamically  \n&gt; constructed\n&gt; URLs, the above technique can be applied /across domains/, provided  \n&gt; the\n&gt; necessary prior arrangements are made between the respective domain\n&gt; administrators.\n&gt;\nWe plan to fall back on URL rewriting only when cookies aren&#39;t  \nenabled, because with cookies the user doesn&#39;t have big ugly strings  \nin the browser&#39;s address text field. I&#39;m not currently planning on  \nusing HTTP authentication because of 1) the inability for the server  \nto to clear the state in the browser once authentication has happened  \n(i.e., I can&#39;t really offer a &quot;sign out&quot; button), 2) the inability to  \nalways give the user a user-friendly, consistent login form, and 3)  \nthe need to reauthenticate the user each time they move from one  \ndomain to another in the same network of sites. This third problem is  \nthe one Elliotte Rusty Harold posted about when he started this thread.\n\n&gt; So, ultimately, this isn&#39;t really about single sign-on across  \n&gt; different\n&gt; hosts in the same domain, or even across hosts in different  \n&gt; domains, as\n&gt; much as it is about coordination patterns among distributed actors.\n&gt;\nI changed the name of in the subject because the problem isn&#39;t what I  \nwould call single-sign on (SSO). To me SSO means that I can use the  \nsame username and password on multiple sites. As you say, that simply  \nrequires shared authentication information among multiple sites, and  \nwe do that with a shared relational database behind all our servers.  \nWhat I&#39;m after I&#39;ve been calling &quot;convenient automated sign  \nin&quot; (CASI), which means that I can authenticate once to the entire  \nnetwork, and as I hop from site to site in that network, I don&#39;t have  \nto reauthenticate. No matter which site I go to first, I can use the  \nsame username and password because of SSO. But after that until I log  \noff the network, either explicitly by clicking a &quot;sign out&quot; button,  \nor by having my &quot;authentication session&quot; expire after a period of  \ninactivity, I don&#39;t have to reenter my username and password at any  \nother site in the network.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
