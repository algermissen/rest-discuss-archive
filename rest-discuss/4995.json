Why didn&#39;t\n&gt; they cooperate and make a common subset of the APIs (in whatever: POX,\n&gt; SOAP, etc.) so we won&#39;t have to deal with several proprietary API\n&gt; *just to search the damn web* ??\nThere already is a common subset of their APIs - they all use HTTP GET and a\nsingle URI.\nThe missing piece is how to discover or construct which /particular/ URI to\nsend.\nThey could do that with an HTML FORM element - which is what &#39;OpenSearch&#39;\nessentially does. The problem with HTML FORMs is that it lacks the ability\nto place user input into path segments as well as query terms.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And why not:\n&gt;\n&gt; SEARCH bill+gates HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Host: www.google.com\n&gt; X-Max-Results-Per-Page: 100\n&gt; X-Max-Results: 100000\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems simple enough for me?\nBecause that new method (SEARCH) introduces a special purpose operation when\nreally the goal is simply to &quot;retrieve results&quot;. It is immaterial whether\nthe server actually &#39;searches&#39; or not. What is actually happening - from the\noutside interface/API, not the internals of the server - is that data is\ntransferred. And that data transfer is going from server to client, so it&#39;s\na GET.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
