Caching is valuable too from a usability \n&gt; perspective and a business one, because it will make the site \n&gt; seem faster to users. I can think of a few options in that case.\n&gt; \n&gt; One is to let go of the breadcrumbs. Users can use the back \n&gt; button to back up. On Firefox if I hold down the back button \n&gt; I get essentially breadcrumbs of page titles, so you could \n&gt; consider dropping them from the page itself to enable you to \n&gt; have a canonical URI for each concept.\n&gt; \n&gt; But breadcrumbs can be nice too, and if you don&#39;t want to \n&gt; drop them, another thing you could do since you probably only \n&gt; have a few variations of breadcrumbs is try to have a \n&gt; canonical URI and send a different ETag for each variation. I \n&gt; don&#39;t know that this would work, because you&#39;d have to figure \n&gt; out what breadcrumbs to show on that canonical URI based on \n&gt; which URI they came from. I&#39;m not sure how consistently \n&gt; browsers will indicate the URI from which they were \n&gt; redirected in the canonical URI request. And even if that \n&gt; does work well enough, you don&#39;t get as good caching because \n&gt; proxies can&#39;t do content negotiation for you. So the proxies \n&gt; would have to ask the server each time if the appropriate \n&gt; representation is one of the ones it has cached. If so, your \n&gt; server wouldn&#39;t have to send the data to the proxy. But \n&gt; that&#39;s the only real speedup, and it isn&#39;t as good caching as \n&gt; having different URIs for each.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing you could do is only redirect to a canonical \n&gt; URI for selected search engine robots. Search engines warn \n&gt; you not to do this. You aren&#39;t supposed to do something \n&gt; different for a search engine robot than for non-search \n&gt; engine robots. But they are mainly concerned about you having \n&gt; a page about poker that when a search engine robot shows up, \n&gt; you switch to a page about the representative of your \n&gt; district. Canonicalizing URIs would help search engines \n&gt; provide better results. So in this approach you get good \n&gt; caching and good search results, but at the risk of getting \n&gt; penalized for breaking the search engine&#39;s guidelines by \n&gt; being removed entirely from their index.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, you could just not have canonical URIs for each concept \n&gt; and accept the likelihood of reduced traffic from search \n&gt; engines. I wouldn&#39;t do that in my situation, but all design \n&gt; decisions depend on context. Maybe in your case being found \n&gt; via search engines isn&#39;t as important as being super \n&gt; cache-friendly and having breadcrumbs. You have to decide \n&gt; what tradeoffs to make, and it isn&#39;t easy. I have struggled a \n&gt; lot with balancing these things due to variation on pages \n&gt; coming from customization based on whether a user is logged \n&gt; in or not, and if so, who they are. One of the rules of thumb \n&gt; is to minimize variation as much as possible, and that&#39;s one \n&gt; reason I never show breadcrumbs on pages.\n\nFair points all.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
