Back to square one or what? You cannot send an order in \napplication/xhtml+xml without moving the negotiation issue to a next layer.\n\n&gt; Personally I like the benefits you get in terms of a self documenting API \n&gt; with HTML directly embedded in it.\n\nWhat do you mean? The API is already documented in the HTTP spec.\n\n&gt; On the flip-side I really dislike the tunneling aspect of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if I want documentation directly in the API I could as well use link \n&gt; headers to embed links to the API documentation -\n\nWhat is this documentation you are talking about? There is nothing to \ndocument about a certain server.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; it would although be a bit hidden. I have also had success with providing \n&gt; an XSLT link in the XML such that browsers will render the raw XML as \n&gt; nicely formated HTML. All in all speaking in favor of new media types.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; /J�rn\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18126 : &quot;each \n&gt; time a dev spits out custom XML or JSON serializations of internal \n&gt; objects, a &quot;new media type&quot; is born (and i think someone kicks a cat, \n&gt; too)&quot;.\n&gt;\n\n\n \n\n\n"}}
