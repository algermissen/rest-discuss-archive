And why do you see  \n&gt;&gt; less  clearly? I think the &#39;GET representation of device state&#39; is  \n&gt;&gt; among  the more natural examples..?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The operation behind this URL is an acquisition process in a sense  \n&gt; that it does not return a device state. It tells the system to  \n&gt; contact the device to obtain its state but it does not return the  \n&gt; state. Another URL is available to retrieve (parts of) the state.  \n&gt; The operation described in the example here (i.e.  \n&gt; DownloadDeviceData) does not return any data other than a result  \n&gt; indicating if the acquisition was succesful or\n&gt; not.\n\nHmm...is that important to the client? Isn;t the goal just to obtain  \nthe state? Why involve the client in anything that happens behind the  \nscenes? Do a GET on a the device resource and the return code will  \ntell you  if you receive a valid state or an error (4xx/5xx)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is similar to an operation on a weblog API that would simply  \n&gt; &quot;publish&quot; a draft version of a post. You would have POSTed a new  \n&gt; entry as a draft, and later on, you would issue a command to  \n&gt; publish your entry. I guess my URL could support this:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://server/publication/ID as POST would publish?\n&gt;  http://server/publication/ID as GET would be same as POST?\n&gt;  http://server/publication/ID as DELETE would unpublish?\n&gt;  http://server/publication/ID as PUT would re-publish?\n\nNo, that is not quite the way to go. If you have drafts, they are  \nobjects in their own right, so you&#39;d have them as resources, too:\n\nGET ../pubs/554             - get the blog entry\nPOST ../drafts              - create a new draft entry (server  \nreturns 201\n                               and URI of new draft)\nGET ../drafts/555           - get the draft\nPOST ../pubs                - create a new publication (possible by  \nposting\n                               the draft), server returns 201 with  \nURI of new entry\n\nPUT ../pubs/555             - replace existing state of entry with  \nentirely new state\n\n\njan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, in the acquisition context, I could do:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://server/acquisition/ID as POST would acquire data\n&gt;  http://server/acquisition/ID as GET would be same as POST\n&gt;  http://server/acquisition/ID as PUT: not applicable\n&gt;  http://server/acquisition/ID as DELETE: not applicable\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; Claude\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: Jan, I mistakenly sent my first reply to you only.
