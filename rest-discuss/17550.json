This illustrates that HTTP headers=\r\n are not the only\nway to handle authorization.\n\nCaching\nHeaders are definit=\r\nely useful in determining caching. HTTP/1.1 has the\nVary[1] header for just=\r\n such purposes.\n\nIt is quite easy to craft responses that are &quot;the same&quot; wh=\r\nether the\nuser is authenticated or not. IOW, you can craft a response that =\r\nis\nboth _personalized_ (based on the authentication info) and\nshared-cache-=\r\nable. The common way to do this is to return a\nrepresentation that contains=\r\n an example HTML framework (e.g. a few\nDIVs, etc.) and a block of javascrip=\r\nt that can determine the\npersonalization information from headers (auth, co=\r\nokies, etc.) and\nthen send XmlHttpRequest calls to return user-specific con=\r\ntent. It is\nthe script that determines the ultimate content seen by the use=\r\nr.\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.44\n\nm=\r\nca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/fo=\r\naf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2011 - Aug 18-20\nhttp://restfest.org\n\n\n\nOn Wed, May 2=\r\n5, 2011 at 16:54, Sidu Ponnappa &lt;lorddaemon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Someo=\r\nne posted a REST question on a blog post at\n&gt; http://www.jacobian.org/writi=\r\nng/rest-wankery-question/ which I quote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Consider a simple photo stora=\r\nge service as an=A0API. Users can only interact with the=A0API=A0if they=92=\r\nve got an account. Let=92s say authorization happens overHTTP=A0Basic.\n&gt;&gt; G=\r\niven that, would you use URIs like=A0/photos=A0and=A0/photos/{id}=A0(as a p=\r\nhoto list and photo detail resource, respectively)? What=92s weird about th=\r\nose URIs is that=A0my=A0/photos=A0is a different list of photos than=A0your=\r\n=A0/photos=A0=97 in other words, the resource represented depends on the in=\r\nformation in theAuthorization=A0header.\n&gt;&gt; It seems like URIs like=A0/peopl=\r\ne/{my-uid}/photos=A0and=A0/people/{my-uid}/photos/{photo-id}=A0are more =93=\r\npure.=94 But now that=92s weird because only one single user ever has acces=\r\ns to a given=A0URI=A0(e.g only user #7 gets to access the entire space unde=\r\nr=A0/people/7). And the information in the=A0URI=A0is redundant with the in=\r\nformation in the=A0Authorization=A0header.\n&gt;&gt; I guess the question comes do=\r\nwn to whether=A0HTTP=A0headers =93should=94 be allowed to determine the res=\r\nource=A0returned.\n&gt;&gt; So which would you use?=A0Why?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say I&#39;d favour =\r\nusing what he calls the &#39;pure&#39; approach, but I&#39;m no\n&gt; expert and wanted to =\r\ncross check with you folks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sidu.\n&gt; http://c42.in\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
