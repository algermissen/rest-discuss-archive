(If it can accept text/html, then it would be able to recognize form stuff, too.)  \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe i misunderstood something, but text/form+html implies, that is a valid html document, too. Like atom+xml is a valid xml file. We use atom+xml for feeds and not plain xml. The intention of svg+xml is also clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the benefit lies on both sides of the network, where i can easly map my media types with my internal representations (e.g. objects).\n&gt; \n&gt; Has the &quot;+&quot; symbol a defined semantic or is it just an convention?\n\nThe +xml suffix is standardized under RFC 3023 and signal&#39;s that a media \ntype can be processed by general XML tooling.\n\nOther suffixes have not been standardized though, and are more of a \nconvention; however earlier in the year discussion over standardizing \n+json was taking place between Ned Freed and Larry Masinter IIRC.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
