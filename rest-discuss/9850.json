The filter criteria cannot be specified as part of the\n&gt; &gt; URI as it is a fairly complex object that needs to get into the request\n&gt; &gt; body.  So my request-line will be GET &#92;data with the filter criteria\n&gt; &gt; coming in via the entity body. However, from various sources, I gathered\n&gt; &gt; that it is not recommended to send data as part of the entity body when\n&gt; &gt; using GET, DELETE and so on. However, I could not find this mentioned\n&gt; &gt; explicitly in the HTTP standard.\n&gt;\n&gt; The spec permits it, but you could conceivably run into problems with\n&gt; deployed software and SDKs which don&#39;t.\n\nmost likely, the software that is broken will be someone else&#39;s proxy\nserver that they can&#39;t bypass\n\n&gt; AFAIK, the possibility for\n&gt; its use in the wild is completely untested.\n\nOf course, this would be a very interesting experiment if someone were\nto do it, I just wouldn&#39;t make it  a prerequsite for my code working,\nand its something you&#39;d want to assess across a broad spread of\nnetwork configurations (more than just planet-lab, you&#39;d want the\ncorporate firewall and home ISP coverage too). It would make for a\ngood paper.\n\n-steve\n\n(unrelated trivia: if you mount a network drive on winXP with a FQDN,\nsuch as z: &#92;&#92;chamonix.hpl.hp.com&#92;steve, the OS does a WEBDAV PropGet\nagainst port 80 before switching to SMB requests. Clearly you can try\ncutting edge stuff -content in a GET- but be prepared to fall back to\nsomething that works, like http headers)\n\n"}}
