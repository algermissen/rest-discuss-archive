In other words, one\n&gt;&gt;&gt;cannot speak of sending a representation in a request.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;i think this is incorrect.  can&#39;t representations be PUT/POSTed as\n&gt;&gt;well, as the body of the request?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No, I wouldn&#39;t think so.  You can send &quot;request data&quot;.  The data may either\n&gt;have a specific meaning (e.g. PUT of a resource state) or not (e.g. various\n&gt;uses of POST), but it isn&#39;t a representation.  A representation (in the\n&gt;context of this discussion) can only exist as it relates to a resource.\n&gt;Only the server has resources and only the server returns representations of\n&gt;those resources.  I think...\n&gt;\nYes, you do send representations in PUT and POST.  The &quot;Transfer&quot; in \nRepresentational State Transfer is not just for responses - it also \napplies to requests.  A PUT request contains a representation of the \nresource you want to store at the specified URI.  And according to Mark \nB., the representation transferred in the PUT is the same representation \n(bytewise) that&#39;ll be returned by a GET of the same resource (assuming \nno intervening state changes).\n\nI would argue the same holds for POST.  A POST request transfers an \nentity to the server.  I don&#39;t see any reason not to consider that \nentity a representation of some (perhaps unnamed) resource. In fact, in \nsome cases, the representation that is transferred will be GETable as a \nnamed resource once it is submitted to the server.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
