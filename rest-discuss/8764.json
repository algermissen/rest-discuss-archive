Plan9 exposes almost\n&gt; &gt; everything through 9P (a client-server protocol).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nAnd then certain specialised applications deliberately by-pass that.\nHow exactly do special apps by-pass the VFS? I&#39;d really like some\nexamples because I don&#39;t understand. I know that UnionFS can expose\nconsistency problems if users modify underlying fs nodes....\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And they should do. Most apps shouldn&#39;t but some should.\n\nOk, so if most apps don&#39;t, then why invalidate the value of\nclient-server (9P, local NFS, FUSE, Windows what-ya-ma-callit).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And this is where it stops being a client-server constraint and starts\n&gt; being a client-server service that&#39;s there if you want it but not if you\n&gt; don&#39;t.\n\nI thought of a good example: USB.\n\nToday, I plug in a shiny new USB printer, and then have to detect and\ninstall the tightly coupled binary libraries to enable printin. Blech.\n\nHere&#39;s a vision of how it could work:\n1) I plug in my printer and a new FS tree is exposed (/usb/345)\n2) The OS inspects this new tree and crawls it for well supported document types\n3) The OS finds a supported application/printer+xml format (at say\n/usb/345/printer) with an &lt;print-form href=&quot;custom-form&quot;&gt; element\n3.1) I&#39;m given a choice to trust this new device service\n4) Using that data a new printer is added to my system.\n5) When I print something and choose &quot;Print Properties&quot; the\n/usb/345/print/custom-form representation is exposed (with full CoD)\n\nWhile I can tightly couple the code, I see distinct advantages to the\nloosely coupled CoD solution.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The same is true and should be true for the rest of desktop computing.\n\nMost desktop computing is tightly coupled with poor interoperability,\nyour right? So now that we agree on that, how would we take the\nlessons learned on the Web and apply them to the desktop?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Can experience from REST inform desktop computing - yes, though in my\n&gt; case probably too much (I&#39;m if anything biased towards using a method\n&gt; that works on the web since I don&#39;t code for the desktop much).\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the style directly applicable - I think no.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you suggest how harm could be done by applying these constraints?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is also true of other web-like matters (I think Mike&#39;s point about\n&gt; address bars is something where the experience of Windows explorer is\n&gt; akin to that of the web, but isn&#39;t much related to REST).\n&gt;\n\nIt is related: Windows Explorer give us just a tiny bit of common\nidentification and interface.\n\nI can create a shortcut on the desktop (bookmark) to a control panel\nicon, or a specific printer. Those are cool URIs.\n\nIt all breaks down fast from there though. Why can&#39;t I have a shortcut\nto a meeting on Friday in outlook? Because that desktop app doesn&#39;t\nexpose uniform identity or interfaces.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nJohn D.
