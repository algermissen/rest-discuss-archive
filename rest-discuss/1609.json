That&#39;s where I learned this transaction \npattern.\n\n&gt; So do you agree that the basic interaction pattern you\n&gt; described wasn&#39;t easily composable into more complex patterns?  I&#39;m\n&gt; still thinking this through, so I may have missed something.  Was \nit a\n&gt; goal of that description you provided to be composable in that way?\n\nI think the transaction pattern is composable.  But you do need to \nsurround it with the resources.  In other words, the transaction \npattern is all about getting agreement on the state(s) of the resource\n(s).  The resource states are the composable elements on the next \nlayer.  REA defines all the necessary resources, by the way.\n\nIn this document:\nhttp://www.gefeg.com/tmwg/files/Chapter%209%20PatternsR10.pdf\nUN/CEFACT lists 6 transaction patterns:\n1. Commercial Transaction (of which Offer-Acceptance is an instance)\n2. Request/Confirm\n3. Query/Response\n4. Request/Response\n5. Notification\n6. Information Distribution\n...and a bunch of interaction patterns.\n\nIf you look at those in detail, you&#39;ll think &quot;EDI-mailbox-style&quot;, and \nyou&#39;ll be right.  But I learned all this stuff from yet another guy \nnamed Jim Clark, one of the designers of RosettaNet.  And his goal \nwas always to get these patterns in a way that was technology-\nneutral, because he did not think EDI-mailbox-style was the end of \nthe line.  \n\nAm I speaking to your composability issue adequately yet?\nIf not, please give me more guidance.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
