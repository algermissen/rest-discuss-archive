The Web has changed: services become resource-oriente=\r\nd APIs. We must react now.\nGoal?      Exploring the opportunities resource-=\r\noriented APIs offer, especially in combination with links.\nFor whom?  Motiv=\r\nated researchers from the REST, Semantic Web, and Linked Data communities.\n=\r\nWhat?      A truly interactive workshop, driven by constructive discussion =\r\nand dialog.\nFormat?    An inspiring day. Morning: talks and dialog. Afterno=\r\non: brainstorm and discussion\n\n\nLAPIS 2012 in 5 bullets\n-------------------=\r\n----\nThe main goal of the LAPIS workshop is to give birth to new ideas and =\r\nvisions, through presentations that encourage interaction and discussion. T=\r\nopics of discussion include:\n\n- defining Linked APIs, what they could look =\r\nlike, and what role links can play\n- identifying the essential building blo=\r\ncks for enabling Linked APIs\n- pinpointing challenges to move from resource=\r\n-oriented APIs towards Linked APIs\n- capturing added value of Linked APIs f=\r\nor the Semantic Web and REST communities\n- designing applications by connec=\r\nting Linked Data and Linked APIs for reading and writing\nThe above list is =\r\nnot exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creat=\r\nive.\n\n\nLAPIS 2012 wants your submission\n--------------------------------\nRe=\r\ngular paper (8 pages)\n    Regular papers focus on new ideas or technologies=\r\n you have developed that relate to Linked APIs.\n    We are very open-minded=\r\n towards the workshop scope, and expect the same from you.\n   \n    Be origi=\r\nnal. Be creative. But most of all: be at least a little controversial =96 g=\r\nenerate discussion.\n    We&#39;re not looking for the next Big Invention. Works=\r\nhop participants want to discover and to learn.\n    \n    Details: http://la=\r\npis2012.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/\n  \nVision paper (4 pages)\n    V=\r\nision papers focus on creative ideas and concepts, even if there are no con=\r\ncrete results yet.\n    Having more questions than answers can in fact be a =\r\nplus=85 if you find the right questions.\n    \n    Details: http://lapis2012=\r\n.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/\n  \nWild ideas and discussion starters =\r\n(1 paragraph)\n    Besides the traditional papers component, we would also l=\r\nike to run an experiment.\n    We want your wildest ideas and discussion top=\r\nics to make LAPIS 2012 an interactive workshop.\n    \n    Details: http://la=\r\npis2012.linkedservices.org/call-for-papers/\n  \n\nMotivated for this challeng=\r\ne?\n-----------------------------\n\nGreat!
