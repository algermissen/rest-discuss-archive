You\ncould argue that requiring subscribers to be servers is a bad idea for\nsecurity reasons or whatever, but it isn&#39;t in conflict with HTTP!\n\nYou&#39;re using a different definition of client and server than HTTP does.\nIf a Linux box is the initiator of a particular HTTP transaction then it\nis the client.\n\nIf we really decide that the &quot;right thing&quot; is a TCP connection from\nsubscriber to publisher then we would have to invent a non-HTTP\nprotocol. I can see various practical limits including:\n\n * limits on numbers of TCP connctions on particular machines\n * timeouts\n * firewalls\n * security admins freaking out about the number of open connections\n\nThink about Google subscribing to notifications from every news site in\nthe world. I can&#39;t imagine it keeping TCP connections open to tens of\nthousands of them at a time. You&#39;re going to run into some serious OS\nlimitations.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
