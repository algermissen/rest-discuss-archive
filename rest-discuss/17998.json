This knowledge has to be &quot;put&quot; there by some\n&gt; human, of course.\n&gt; for this scenario, the server has a much more limited set of\n&gt; evolvability options. severs can remove inputs, remove links/forms,\n&gt; and/or change the order of their appearance and still expect the system\n&gt; to &quot;work properly.&quot; IOW, the server cannot add any new inputs, links, or\n&gt; forms and expect the &#39;bot&#39; to &quot;know&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; these new elements.\n\nwell, that&#39;s not entirely true. media formats should be designed with \nextensibility in mind, so that servers can add stuff without breaking \nclients. and then there are two options:\n\n- extensions are allowed and are ignored by definition. this allows \nservers to add stuff without breaking clients. it does not allow servers \nto make sure that old clients will understand that they shouldn&#39;t be \ndoing things the old way.\n\n- extensions are allowed and there are switches that allow servers to \ncommunicate whether an extension is mandatory. HTML (and thus option one \npresented above) says &quot;mustIgnore&quot; implicitly for all extensions. media \ntypes can define &quot;mustIgnore&quot; and/or &quot;mustUnderstand&quot; labels that \nclients must interpret, so that an extension can be safely ignored by an \nold client, or that a old client knows that it should stop because there \nis an extension in a representation that it does not understand, but \nthat is labeled &quot;mustUnderstand&quot;.\n\nthis latter design allows more nuances in evolving media types, but of \ncourse makes both the media type and the client implementation more complex.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
