This appears to be a good step away from &quot;fine\n&gt; grained&quot; RPC.\n&gt; Some new additions to SOAP 1.2 look like RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Is the new SOAP (1.2) RESTful enough that one can\n&gt; build a REST Web\n&gt; Services?\n&gt; 2. Has anyone actually implemeted a RESTful Web\n&gt; Services? \n&gt; \n&gt; Hao\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
