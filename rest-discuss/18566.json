The guideline m=\r\nay misguide to one of the options you mention, that I dislike a lot: URL Te=\r\nmplates. That makes the server lose control of the URL space, as it it is f=\r\norced to follow a strict construction that also exposes resource informatio=\r\nn.\n\nI may make a difference between a resource Identifier and a simple enti=\r\nty identifier. The resource identifier is always the URL, that may change o=\r\nver time. We create a resource using an entity (pure information) and it is=\r\n stored somewhere and a URI is assigned to it. If you have the entity id li=\r\nke the UUID, the only hope you have is searching the web space for a resour=\r\nce that may be representing it. You can have more than one, actually, and t=\r\nhere should be a way in the app to get to it (searching is the normal optio=\r\nn here).\n\nSo, the questions is not about the client finding the URL structu=\r\nre, but of the client finding the search service. Say, we can have a link i=\r\nn the welcome page that says &quot;Find item by ID&quot;. Simple.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n=\r\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Adriano Bonat &lt;adrianob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading this guideline [1] about resource identifiers and =\r\nI&#39;m not\n&gt; sure how a client would be able to navigate to the resource just =\r\nhaving the\n&gt; entry point URL and the identifier.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does the client fi=\r\nnd out the URL structure to be used to fetch the\n&gt; resource?
