By definition there can&#39;t really\n&gt; be an HTTP-level problem yet. Mozilla doesn&#39;t contact Apache and say:\n&gt; &quot;something&#39;s really screwed up over here.&quot;\nA notification is a message that describes a request/response pair - the\nevent that occurred. The event may have completed successfully, or it may\nhave had an error, or it may have been denied due to permissions. All these\nare useful and interesting to convey. Not all subscribers are interested in\nall events, and a filtering ability would be a plus - filtering on\nrequest/response headers (including response status).\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we do need to be able to differentiate between state changes and\n&gt; deletions. Maybe a header? But a deletion isn&#39;t really an error. It&#39;s\n&gt; just a deletion.\nIf you echo (for the most part) the HTTP request that caused the change,\nthen you&#39;ll have knowledge of the operation (type of state change - create,\nread, update, delete, add or remove) that ocurred. And if you echo (for the\nmost part) the response then you&#39;ll have knowledge of whether that operation\nsucceeded or not.\nFor example if you DELETE  resource, all the watchers also see a DELETE -\nnot necessarily as requests for them to delete, but notifications of an\nevent that occurred. And if someone tries to do a DELETE and is that is\ndenied due to permissions, the watchers will see the response status code\n&quot;403 Forbidden&quot; (if you want to get that fine grained, or some criteria\nspecifies to forward that stuff).\nHandy to be alerted about attempted security violations. Model your\napplication as an information model and notifications directly become state\nchange events that describe the resource, the operation and result status.\nProvide filtering based on all three and you have a very powerful,\ncomposable event system.\nWHERE uri=&quot;/mike/buddylist&quot; and method=&quot;put&quot; and status=&quot;success&quot;\nWHERE uri=&quot;/mike/buddylist&quot; and method=&quot;put&quot; and status=&quot;denied&quot;\nWHERE uri=&quot;/mike/buddylist&quot; and method=&quot;get&quot; and status=&quot;denied&quot;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If there are notification-related errors that we need to report then\n&gt; there could be a header for them. In general, existing HTTP status codes\n&gt; will not be appropriate.\nI disagree that existing status codes will not be appropriate. Any response\nto a client request should be echoed - in whole or in part - to the watchers\n(filtering and transformation aside). This keeps the burden on the server to\na minimum.\n\n\n\n"}}
