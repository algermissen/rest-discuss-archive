The big boys are waking up and \ndiscovering REST, and naturally they want to protect all us little \ndevelopers from worrying our pretty little heads about nasty things like \nHTTP and XML by creating easy-to-use REST frameworks:\n\nJSR-311 Java API for RESTful Web Services\nhttp://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311\n\nRemember, these are the same jokers who gave us servlets and the \nURLConnection class as well as gems like JAX-RPC and JAX-WS. They still \nseem to believe that these are actually good specs, and they are \nproposing to tunnel REST services through JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web \nServices) endpoints.\n\nThey also seem to believe that &quot;building RESTful Web services using the \nJava Platform is significantly more complex than building SOAP-based \nservices&quot;. I don&#39;t know that this is false, but  if it&#39;s true it&#39;s only \nbecause Sun&#39;s HTTP API were designed by architecture astronauts who \ndidn&#39;t actually understand HTTP. This proposal does not seem to be \naddressing the need for a decent HTTP API on either the client or server \nside that actually follows RESTful principles instead of fighting \nagainst them.\n\nTo give you an idea of the background we&#39;re dealing with here, one of \nthe two people who wrote the proposal &quot;represents Sun on the W3C XML \nProtocol and W3C WS-Addressing working groups where he is co-editor of \nthe SOAP 1.2 and WS-Addressing 1.0 specifications. Marc was \nco-specification lead for JAX-WS 2.0 (the Java API for Web Services) \ndeveloped at the JCP and has also served as Sun&#39;s technical lead and \nalternate board member at the Web Services Interoperability Organization \n(WS-I).&quot;\n\nThe other submitter seems to be a primary instigator of the Fast Infoset \neffort to hide XML in binary goop.\n\nThis is like asking Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic \nParty platform.\n\nDo we really want to trust these folks to define the official Java spec \nfor REST? Please read the JSR, and send comments to jsr-311-comments@...\n\nI hope we can derail this completely, but we probably can&#39;t. If not, are \nthere any JSR members here who might join the working group and bring \nsome sanity and actual REST experience to the development of the \neventual specification? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we can at least limit \nthe damage.\n\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
