My intent was to include  \n: the possibility of content negotiation in my question. A more pointed  \n: question, then, would be: By Roy&#39;s definition of resource as mapping,  \n: is it true that:\n: \n: http://www.artima.com/articles\n: and\n: http://www.artimal.com/articles?p=4\n: \n: Must at any time t return the same representation given the same  \n: request headers to refer to the same resource?\n: \n\nIf you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve locked out all variation by that approach, then\nthe answer should be yes.  But I don&#39;t know for sure that content\nnegotiation is deterministic.\n\nA safer way to go is to pretend that you have the all-powerful client\nthat is able to fetch all possible representations from both URI at all\ntimes.  Then for all times t, the set of reps from each URI must \nmatch.  That&#39;s as precise as I can say it without resorting to \nformalisms.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
