The default generates code that you\n&gt; have to manually modify and maintain which is a lot of work for a large\n&gt; system.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re referring to here. The alternative to generating\nthat code is hand-coding the exact same code, which is a fine option too. The\ncode is generated once when you create the controller or model and then you\nown it. How does this code generation cause any harm? I did my time back in\nthe day writing Windows apps with MFC and ATL so I know what bad code\ngeneration looks like :)\n\n&gt; P.S. If it really is that easy, maybe you&#39;ll want to help me with it\n&gt; off-list? If so, then maybe I&#39;ll come back here and beg for mea cupla. ;-)\n\nFeel free.\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n"}}
