Besides, we&#39;ll never run out of scheme\n&gt; names, so I don&#39;t see what the benefit of sticking with one scheme\n&gt; name would be.\nI was thinking outside of just browsers but it&#39;s not that important.\nI suppose auth scheme names are not as consistely used as something\nlike method names so having a larger than necessary set isn&#39;t a total\ncatastrophe.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Change &quot;is always&quot; to &quot;was previously&quot; and you&#39;ve got a better approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nope. Breaks backwards compatibility. People don&#39;t like that, even\n&gt; when the old behavior sucks, so it should only be done where\n&gt; absolutely necessary. So, if IE and Safari and Opera all agreed to\n&gt; change, you&#39;d have a better approach.\n&gt;\nHow so? Is it the case that sometimes a 401 has a response body but it\nisn&#39;t desired to show it since it probably doesn&#39;t have an HTML form\nor something?\nMaybe since you are adding some user interface, the scheme name could\nchange from &quot;Basic&quot; to &quot;VisualBasic&quot; ? ;)\n\n"}}
