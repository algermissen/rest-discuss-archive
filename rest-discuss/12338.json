In CCXML, you use =\r\n&lt;fetch&gt; and &lt;goto&gt; to transition from document to document. So the web of l=\r\ninked CCXML documents is a state machine as described in Fielding&#39;s thesis,=\r\n and then each document contains a mini state machine as well.\n\nSCXML has t=\r\nhese transitions as well but with a twist. In SCXML they works like a Gosub=\r\n rather than a goto. This is done by using the src attribute on &lt;state&gt; (se=\r\ne section 3.11) or by using &lt;invoke&gt;. This twist on the model is interestin=\r\ng and has it&#39;s ups and downs but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely un-RESTful tho=\r\nugh I concede that it&#39;s up for debate.\n\nI think the take-away from understa=\r\nnding these formats should be that different kinds of markup are possible t=\r\nhat are better suited for machine-to-machine interactions. I&#39;ve been trying=\r\n to encourage folks to understand these formats to have other examples to d=\r\nraw from when thinking about REST. People tend to not look beyond HTML and =\r\noften end up where Bill did in his response to this thread saying that:\n\n  =\r\n&quot;Computers aren&#39;t humans. While a human can look at a web page \n   and figu=\r\nre out how to enter information on the form there, a \n   piece of code can&#39;=\r\nt. For code, everything needs to be mostly \n   predetermined and the intera=\r\nctions agreed upon before hand.&quot;\n\nNo offense to Bill, but that completely m=\r\nisses the point of REST. One of the biggest benefits you will get from a RE=\r\nSTful design is the decoupling of the client and server. This is why the HA=\r\nTEOAS constraint is so important.\n\nCCXML is a counter-example to Bill&#39;s ass=\r\nertion (an assertion I&#39;ve heard over and over again on this list). There&#39;s =\r\nno coupling between a CCXML client and server beyond HTTP, CCXML and the in=\r\nitial URL of the application. A CCXML client can construct a POST using the=\r\n information in a CCXML document. It&#39;s RESTful machine-to-machine interacti=\r\non and is definitely worth understanding.\n\nAnyways, thanks for taking the t=\r\nime to look at these specs. I&#39;ve pointed them out before on this list but g=\r\not no response. Hopefully, they give you some good insights.\n\nAndrew\n\n--- I=\r\nn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Solomon Duskis &lt;sduskis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;l=\r\nl definitely take a look at CCXML and SCXML and the technologies that use\n&gt;=\r\n them...  but I don&#39;t think that they are RESTful.  They are useful, but\n&gt; =\r\ndon&#39;t meet the Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS):\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; REST has a constraint of Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State\n&gt; =\r\n(HATEOAS).  Roy Fielding has a long post as to what that means, but I think=\r\n\n&gt; of it in terms of a browser user clicking on a link to move from one\n&gt; p=\r\nage/state to another state.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems like CCXML&#39;s oriented at describi=\r\nng the communication process:\n&gt; start the call, dial, connect... end the ca=\r\nll.  If so, then yes, there are\n&gt; states, but it&#39;s not &quot;application state.&quot;=\r\n  I would categorize that type of\n&gt; state as &quot;communication state&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SCX=\r\nML seems to be a generic state machine.  Generic state machines usually\n&gt; a=\r\nren&#39;t used to capture &quot;application state.&quot;  They are usually used to\n&gt; capt=\r\nure work flow and &quot;resource state&quot;; for example a mortgage loan is in\n&gt; the=\r\n &quot;initialized&#39; state, &quot;processing&quot; state or &quot;approved&quot; state based on\n&gt; som=\r\ne interaction with the state machine. SCXML may be used to capture\n&gt; applic=\r\nations state, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be hypertext driven.\n&gt; \n&gt; I definitely=\r\n could be wrong about all of this :)\n&gt; \n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
