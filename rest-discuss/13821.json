Generic may not be a client per se, but a framework that allows\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; to create a client by some sort of configuration (description language?\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; may not be adopted since it recalls WSDL which is hated nowadays\n&gt;&gt; and =\r\nmisunderstood) or training where it learns the semantics.\n&gt;&gt; 2. A standardi=\r\nzed (or at least agreed upon) set of ways to define\n&gt;&gt; links to represent t=\r\nhose semantics. (WSDL like again?)\n&gt;&gt; 3. The actual particular code, AKA th=\r\ne plugin part you will create.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, in itself, isn&#39;t any &quot;good&quot; REST pa=\r\nyload implicitly\n&gt; self-describing? It may not be a COMPLETE documentation =\r\nof the API or\n&gt; the service, but in and of itself and it&#39;s own little world=\r\n view, it\n&gt; should be a relatively complete description, at least at rough =\r\nlevel.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you happen to be sending XML payload, XML Schema can fill in =\r\nmuch\n&gt; of the details.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming you can interpret the link references, =\r\npossibly combined wit\n&gt; OPTIONS, then a client should be able to make avail=\r\nable all of the\n&gt; state transitions, as well as be able to create properly =\r\nformatted,\n&gt; though not necessarily populated, payloads.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know h=\r\now any document can communicate semantics to a machine,\n&gt; frankly. A Java d=\r\noc, for example, auto generated from a class\n&gt; definition gives a nice, wor=\r\nthless summary of a class. But it\n&gt; certainly has the information necessary=\r\n to handle the physical\n&gt; communication with that class.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just a word a=\r\nbout WSDL. The biggest mistake was the code generation.\n&gt;&gt; If WSDL was to b=\r\ne interpreted on the fly, and the interactions dynamically\n&gt;&gt; followed, I g=\r\nuess people would not non-sensically hate it as they do now.\n&gt;&gt; So, that fr=\r\namework IS NOT A CODE GENERATION thing. It should read\n&gt;&gt; and process the c=\r\nonfig on the fly, and the config is to be provided by the\n&gt;&gt; first URL you =\r\nhit in the system. See?\n&gt;\n&gt; Code generation exists because of a limitation =\r\nof the static\n&gt; implementation languages. Dynamic languages don&#39;t need code=\r\n generation\n&gt; specifically because they&#39;re dynamic languages.\n&gt;\n&gt; People ca=\r\nn, and have, written dynamic interfaces to WSDL web services,\n&gt; even for st=\r\natic languages. They&#39;re just a pain to use from the coders\n&gt; point of view,=\r\n and offer none of the value of a static language.\n&gt;\n&gt; In either case, whet=\r\nher it&#39;s code generated or a client, I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand where you get &quot;dy=\r\nnamically&quot; followed.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a schema changed, and eliminated previous field=\r\ns that your code was\n&gt; populating, that&#39;s an error. It could in theory resp=\r\nond to new,\n&gt; optional but defaulted fields, but that&#39;s quite the edge case=\r\n in\n&gt; general IMHO.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I guess I&#39;m not clear on how folks think a syst=\r\nem can interact\n&gt; &quot;dynamically&quot; with another system when there&#39;s, in the en=\r\nd, some code\n&gt; somewhere driving the transaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Har=\r\ntung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Yahoo!
