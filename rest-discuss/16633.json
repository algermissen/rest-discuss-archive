It&#39;s a specialized, small and stand-alone server to create new\nRESTful resources and web services very quickly and easily. It\nautomatically produces a self-documented RESTful API for you, while at\nit.\n\nYou can find a complete, self-guided demo of the system here:\n\n        http://restxdemo.mulesoft.org/static/demo/start.html\n\nI would like to invite you (the members of this group here) to be the\nfirst to try out the demo and let me know what you think. If you have a\nminute to spare, I would really love to get your feedback. On one hand\nI&#39;m feeling a bit nervous about what you might say, since many of you\nare so knowledgeable about REST, but on the other hand I know that your\nfeedback would really help me to make RESTx better. Constructive\ncriticism is certainly welcome, and if you have something good to say\nabout it, I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing that either. :-)\n\n\nSome background information:\n\n      * RESTx is not an application framework in the usual sense: It&#39;s\n        all about the individual services. Small, self-contained pieces\n        of code (&#39;components&#39;) perform specific tasks (such as accessing\n        a DB, a custom API, a cloud service, implementing data\n        integration logic, etc.). You can provide new configurations for\n        a component in order to create a new resource (or web service),\n        which gets its own URI: Access that URI and the stored\n        configuration is applied to the component.\n      * You can create new resources by POSTing the parameter sets to\n        the component or by filling out a simple form in a web browser.\n        So, even non-developers can create their own specialized web\n        services.\n      * If you need custom components, you can easily write those in\n        either Java, Python or server-side JavaScript.\n      * It does support conneg, so you can see information from the\n        server as HTML (in a browser) or JSON (in a client application),\n        for example.\n\nKnown limitations:\n\n      * Links don&#39;t get special tags. Right now it somewhat naively\n        assumes that if it looks like a URI it should be a URI. I know I\n        need to come up with something better there.\n      * Currently, it doesn&#39;t support the proper HTTP caching tags and\n        headers yet. That will be added soon.\n      * I&#39;m using generic content types, such as &#39;application/json&#39;.\n\nAnyway, so there it is. I really appreciate you taking the time to have\na quick look at it and I&#39;m already grateful for your feedback. \n\nThank you very much!\n\nJuergen\n\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nRESTx - the fastest and easiest way to created RESTful web services\nhttp://restx.org\n\n\n"}}
