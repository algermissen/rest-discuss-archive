I believe that a resource type should entirely own a\nrepresentation type. One shouldn&#39;t think of RSS as a representation, one\nshould think of RSS_SiteSummary as a representation *of* the SiteSummary\nresource type. And therefore RSS_SiteSummary should be a sub-element of\nSiteSummary, not an independent element.\n\nRationale: The primary purpose of representation types is to extract\nlinks for the resource type. It doesn&#39;t make sense to do this in the\nabstract. A particular representation needs to extract its links for a\nparticular resource type. If the representation type is &quot;purchase order&quot;\nand the references it is expecting are &quot;acceptance_URI, customer_URI and\ncancellation_URI&quot; then the WRDL representation type needs to have\nexactly those reference types...like a Java implementation of an\ninterface. Maybe the same concrete syntax (text/ebxmlpo+xml) is used as\na representation of another resource. In that context it will have\ndifferent reference types so it will be for all intents and purposes a\nnew representation.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
