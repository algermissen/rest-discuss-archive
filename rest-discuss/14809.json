However, the lack of client side libraries that embrace this is impedi=\r\nng me for the moment. The way I see it, all clients must be only be made kn=\r\nown of one URI, say &quot;/&quot;. The client then derives the URIs from that link. A=\r\ns such, I was hoping to do something roughly like:\n\n\n\nfrom(&quot;/&quot;).follow( &quot;#u=\r\nsers_link&quot; ).fill_form( &quot;search_user&quot; , {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;someid&quot;}).follow( &quot;#user_li=\r\nnk&quot; ).follow( &quot;#friends_ link&quot;)\n\n\n\nThe goal of the previous command was to =\r\nget the friends of some user having an ID of &#39;someid&#39;. It starts by going t=\r\no the given URL, then from the page it got, follows a certain link which re=\r\ndirect it to the resource for a list of users. It then searches for the use=\r\nr, probably filling up a form, submits it, and goes to the user&#39;s page. Fro=\r\nm the user&#39;s page, there is a link to the friends page, and that is followe=\r\nd and eventually processed.\n\n\n\nIn reality of course, this shouldn&#39;t really =\r\nnecessitate multiple calls to the server if called multiple times since pre=\r\nvious results have been cached and processed on the client side. Only when =\r\nthe cache expires, should there be an attempt to request again. I&#39;m not rea=\r\nlly sure if RESTful clients that respect HATEOAS do it this way, and should=\r\n they in the first place.
