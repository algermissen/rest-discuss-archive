I wanted to correct a persistent\n&gt; misinterpretation that Roy Fielding said something against CGI or\n&gt; against &quot;excessive gatewaying&quot;. Hopefully he&#39;ll correct me if\n&gt; I&#39;m wrong\n&gt; but I think that his opinion is that gatewaying (CGI or\n&gt; whatever) is the\n&gt; right way to integrate non-Web systems with the Web and is a core part\n&gt; of web architecture. You have repeatedly cited that message\n&gt; in a manner\n&gt; I believe to be incorrect and I felt it was necessary to\n&gt; inform you (no\n&gt; matter what the topic of discussion).\n&gt; --\n&gt; Come discuss XML and REST web services at:\n&gt;   Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n&gt;   Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
