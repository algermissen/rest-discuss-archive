HTTP, and the applications built on it, have evolved\n&gt; organically.  Over the past few years, we have seen a proliferation of\n&gt; AJAX-based web applications (AJAX being shorthand for asynchronous\n&gt; JavaScript and XML), as well as Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), based\n&gt; on so-called Web 2.0 technologies.  These applications bring both\n&gt; luscious eye-candy and convenient functionality, e.g. social networking,\n&gt; to their users, making them quite compelling.  At the same time, we are\n&gt; seeing an increase in attacks against these applications and their\n&gt; underlying technologies.\n&gt; \n&gt; The list of attacks is long and includes Cross-Site-Request Forgery\n&gt; (CSRF)-based attacks, content-sniffing, cross-site-scripting (XSS)\n&gt; attacks, attacks against browsers supporting anti-XSS policies,\n&gt; clickjacking attacks, malvertising attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle\n&gt; (MITM) attacks against &quot;secure&quot; (e.g. Transport Layer Security\n&gt; (TLS/SSL)-based) web sites along with distribution of the tools to carry\n&gt; out such attacks (e.g. sslstrip).\n&gt; \n&gt; Objectives and Scope\n&gt; \n&gt; With the arrival of new attacks the introduction of new web security\n&gt; indicators, security techniques, and policy communication mechanisms\n&gt; have sprinkled throughout the various layers of the Web and HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal of this working group is to compose an overall &quot;problem\n&gt; statement and requirements&quot; document derived from surveying the\n&gt; issues outlined in the above section ([1] provides a starting point).\n&gt; The requirements guiding the work will be taken from the Web\n&gt; application and Web security communities.  The scope of this document\n&gt; is HTTP applications security, but does not include HTTP authentication,\n&gt; nor internals of transport security which are addressed by other working\n&gt; groups (although it may make reference to transport security as an\n&gt; available security &quot;primitive&quot;).  See the &quot;Out of Scope&quot; section, below.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, the WG will standardize a small number of selected\n&gt; specifications that have proven to improve security of Internet\n&gt; Web applications.  Initial work will be the following topics:\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Same origin policy, as discussed in draft-abarth-origin\n&gt;    (see also Appendices A and B, below)\n&gt; \n&gt;  - HTTP Strict transport security, as discussed in\n&gt;    draft-hodges-strict-transport-sec\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Media type sniffing, as discussed in draft-abarth-mime-sniff\n&gt; \n&gt; This working group will work closely with IETF Apps Area WGs (such as\n&gt; HYBI, HTTPstate, and HTTPbis), as well as appropriate W3C working\n&gt; group(s) (e.g. HTML, WebApps).\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of Scope\n&gt; \n&gt; As noted in the objectives and scope (above), this working group&#39;s\n&gt; scope does not include working on HTTP Authentication nor underlying\n&gt; transport (secure or not) topics. So, for example, these items are\n&gt; out-of-scope for this WG:\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Replacements for BASIC and DIGEST authentication\n&gt; \n&gt;  - New transports (e.g. SCTP and the like)\n&gt; \n&gt; Deliverables\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. A document illustrating the security problems Web applications are\n&gt; facing and listing design requirements.  This document shall be\n&gt; Informational.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. A selected set of technical specifications documenting deployed\n&gt; HTTP-based Web security solutions. These documents shall be Standards\n&gt; Track.\n&gt; \n&gt; Goals and Milestones\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 2010    Submit &quot;HTTP Application Security Problem Statement and\n&gt;           Requirements&quot; as initial WG item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 2010    Submit &quot;Media Type Sniffing&quot; as initial WG item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 2010    Submit &quot;Web Origin Concept&quot; as initial WG item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oct 2010    Submit &quot;Strict Transport Security&quot; as initial WG item.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feb 2011    Submit &quot;HTTP Application Security Problem Statement and\n&gt;           Requirements&quot; to the IESG for consideration as an\n&gt;           Informational RFC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mar 2011    Submit &quot;Media Type Sniffing&quot; to the IESG for consideration\n&gt;           as a Standards Track RFC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mar 2011    Submit &quot;Web Origin Concept&quot; to the IESG for consideration as\n&gt;           a Standards Track RFC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mar 2011    Submit &quot;Strict Transport Security&quot; to the IESG for\n&gt;           consideration as a Standards Track RFC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apr 2011    Possible re-chartering\n&gt; \n&gt; References\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] Hodges and Steingruebl, &quot;The Need for a Coherent Web Security Policy\n&gt; Framework&quot;, W2SP position paper, 2010.\n&gt; http://w2spconf.com/2010/papers/p11.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Appendices\n&gt; \n&gt; A. Relationship between origin work in IETF WebSec and W3C HTML WG\n&gt; \n&gt; draft-abarth-origin defines the nuts-and-bolts of working with\n&gt; origins (computing them from URIs, comparing them to each other, etc).\n&gt; HTML5 defines HTML-specific usage of origins.  For example, when\n&gt; making an HTTP request, HTML5 defines how to compute which origin\n&gt; among all the origins rendering HTML is the one responsible for making\n&gt; the request.  draft-abarth-origin then takes that origin, serializes\n&gt; it to a string, and shoves it in a header.\n&gt; \n&gt; B. Origin work may yield two specifications\n&gt; \n&gt; There also seems to be demand for a document that describes the\n&gt; same-origin security model overall.  However, it seems like that\n&gt; document ought to be more informative rather than normative. The\n&gt; working group may split draft-abarth-origin into separate informative\n&gt; and standards track specifications, the former describing same-origin\n&gt; security model, and the latter specifying the nuts-and-bolts of working\n&gt; with origins (computing them from URLs, comparing them to each other,\n&gt; etc).\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; apps-discuss mailing list\n&gt; apps-discuss@...\n&gt; https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss\n\n--\nMark Nottingham   http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
