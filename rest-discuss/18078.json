We&#39;ve establis=\r\nhed\n&gt;&gt; that PUT (as defined in httpbis) is not that method.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Because =\r\nnow you&#39;d have two methods describing the same sender intent of\n&gt; partial u=\r\npdate. =A0That some partial-update interactions may be idempotent\n&gt; is inte=\r\nresting, but it&#39;s an edge case, so I don&#39;t understand the need to\n&gt; optimiz=\r\ne for it.\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s as edge as you think it is.\n\nMobile clients a=\r\nre becoming more and more prevalent; they operate on a\nrelatively inefficie=\r\nnt network where requests need to be as lean as\npossible (partial) and easi=\r\nly re-issued(idempotent).\n\nAll that is required to make this possible if fo=\r\nr PUT semantics to be\nmore general - i.e. drop the full replace semantic, a=\r\nnd make no\nassertion about the partial/fullness one way or the other.\n\n&gt; I =\r\nbelieve that sender intent stops at partial update,\n&gt; without considering i=\r\ndempotency, and I see no advantage in adding\n&gt; complexity to the protocol t=\r\no take that into account -- especially not\n&gt; if there&#39;s already a RESTful s=\r\nolution to the problem...\n\nRemoving the constraint which specifies &#39;PUT req=\r\nuests must be full\nreplace&#39; is less complex, not more.\n\n&gt; More important is=\r\n the question of why not, if idempotency is important\n&gt; in a partial update=\r\n scenario, do what Roy and most everyone else always\n&gt; says by making it a =\r\nsubresource with its own URL and using PUT? =A0Since\n&gt; this design pattern =\r\nis such a standard part of REST development, I&#39;m\n&gt; not seeing any problem w=\r\nhich needs solving with a new method, any more\n&gt; than I saw a problem which=\r\n needed solving by redefining an existing\n&gt; method.\n\n*snip*\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If it&#39;s im=\r\nportant to intermediaries that your partial update be\n&gt; considered idempote=\r\nnt, then mint a URI for a subresource and use PUT.\n&gt; I should think that ap=\r\nproach needs to be falsified before lobbying for\n&gt; a new method.\n\nThe probl=\r\nem with this advice is that it&#39;s not a practical solution:\nthe requirements=\r\n for what constitutes efficient granularity can differ\nbetween clients, can=\r\n change over time, and are very difficult to get\nright up front.\n\nAlso, doi=\r\nng so reduces the visibility of interaction in terms of\nsmearing shared sta=\r\nte across several resources, this makes mechanisms\nlike cache invalidation =\r\nfar more difficult to leverage - it&#39;s\nredundant and costly.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
