But that&#39;s not what\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s intended to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, can I, or can&#39;t I? Sounds to me like I can. \n\nYou can if you want. I&#39;m not forcing you to  /8-&gt;\n\n\n&gt; So, I have a &#39;subject&#39; \n&gt; context. However, as I stated at the very outset, the &#39;user&#39; is not \n&gt; sufficient context if users need to modify server state in the context \n&gt; of a session. So, if I needed to model a session, how could I do it?\n\nAh well... you see I don&#39;t agree that a &quot;session&quot; is a good idea. I&#39;d\nrather talk about resources.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The table containing session 42s data held at the server.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So, if I put &#39;Session 42&#39; in the URL this would somehow be different?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If the url could be used to retrieve the content of the resource\n&gt;&gt; (including the entire session state) then yes, I think it would.\n&gt;\n&gt; You mean,\n&gt;\n&gt;   Session 42 GETs /session-state\n&gt;\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose you mean,\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET /session-state?session=42\n\nActually I meant:\n\n    http://something/session42\n\nparameters are harder to cache.\n\n\n&gt; Why is it that you think there is any difference whether the session \n&gt; context is in the URL or in a cookie? You&#39;ve conceded the point that a \n&gt; session context (albeit only one universal session per user) is possible \n&gt; with HTTP Auth. Why can&#39;t I use some other header? Like, say, a cookie \n&gt; header?\n\nNo. You have misunderstood me. I did not conceed that a universal\nsession per user is a good thing. You can do it if you want - I&#39;m not\nstopping you. But your cachability will be reduced.\n\nBut if the state that you would normally store in a session is\naccessible instead through a URI then that isn&#39;t really a session\nanymore is it?  It&#39;s a resource.\n\n\n&gt; How often do you see users post the full link from their address bar to \n&gt; a book on Amazon, for example? Amazon puts all that extra goop on the \n&gt; end of their URLs, and those numbers mean something (who knows what, \n&gt; exactly, but I&#39;ll bet &#39;session&#39; is one of them), and then users post \n&gt; that all over Usenet, and don&#39;t have an idea of what they&#39;re\n&gt; telling.\n\nAmazon has some pretty good RESTful services.\n\n\n&gt; As a courtesy and a convenience to my users, I&#39;d like the &#39;context&#39; \n&gt; which identifies them to be separate from the &#39;context&#39; that designates \n&gt; &#39;what&#39; they want. To the extent that representations of &#39;what&#39; they want \n&gt; (a resource) vary based on &#39;who&#39; they are, I don&#39;t expect them to worry \n&gt; about that. I give them a customised service, they&#39;re happy.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a result users can share links and bookmark links with reckless \n&gt; abandon. Also, owing to the way the web has worked out in practice, \n&gt; there is a precedent for session tokens, and there is thus in many ways \n&gt; a user expectation for them.\n\nBut I can&#39;t find fault with any of that. What you&#39;re saying is that\nURIs should represent things. Not an arbitary user&#39;s view of things\nand I agree.\n\nIf I were amazon then my URIs would point to resources about books.\n\n\nBut your earlier arguments were about sessions and session state which\nI don&#39;t believe is necessary or right. In fact, when building\nmassivly scaled apps it&#39;s very bad because it forces just one\nimplementation strategy (very, very big iron).\n\n\n\n&gt; As an application developer receiving and processing HTTP requests, I \n&gt; find it enormously valuable to isolate what is implied by the &#39;subject&#39;, \n&gt; and what is implied by the &#39;object&#39; separately. As I desire to separate \n&gt; these concerns during processing, it seems more appropriate for me to \n&gt; ensure that the URI (the &#39;resource&#39;, the &#39;what&#39;) is already exactly the \n&gt; &#39;object&#39; before I begin processing.\n\nYes! This is REST.\n\nResources are identified by URIs and really mean something.\n\nThere&#39;s no need for sessions; all the state is maintained in the\nresources.\n\nTo reiterate an earlier example: my bank account might be:\n\n   http://bank/accounts/nicferrier\n\nwhereas yours will be a different resource and uri entirely.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
