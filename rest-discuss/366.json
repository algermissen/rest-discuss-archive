You&#39;re correct in that\n&gt; supporting a full HTTP 1.1 inevitably results in more code than just HTTP 0.9,\n&gt; and the probability of security-compromising bugs is proportional to\n&gt; the amount\n&gt; of code.  But nobody said a callback service needs to support the\n&gt; full HTTP 1.1\n&gt; --- and the MUST part of the spec is a *lot* smaller than the SHOULD and MAY\n&gt; parts.  (Though admittedly it is still bigger than 0.9.)\n\nIt a _lot_ bigger!\n\n&gt; The point I was trying to make is that the problems you&#39;re talking about have\n&gt; everything to do with problems network admins have with inbound\n&gt; connectivity in\n&gt; general, regardless of the protocol used.  They&#39;re suspicious of *any*\n&gt; requestable service running on the client machine.\n\nRight, and it is correct to blow off incompetent adminbots.  We should be\ndesigning for competent adminbots.  They do exist.\n\n\n"}}
