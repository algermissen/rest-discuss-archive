I have no problem with WebDAV\n&gt; inventing new codes. I was just trying to figure out what was the best\n&gt; status to return for a semantic error in HTTP, and WebDAV was a good\n&gt; case study because it invents a new code for this purpose. If WebDAV\n&gt; had to invent a new code, then does that mean that this is a situation\n&gt; that HTTP/1.1 doesn&#39;t cater for?\n&gt;\n&gt; What I am really trying to figure out is whether 400 is allowed for\n&gt; requests that are syntactically correct at the HTTP level, but have a\n&gt; semantic error.  I always thought that it was OK, because it looks\n&gt; like the most appropriate code.  I&#39;m assuming that WebDAV invented\n&gt; 422, because it considered it not to be OK - but I don&#39;t really know\n&gt; the history.\n\nIt seems that this is just a shortcoming in HTTP. 4xx is for client errors.\nWe are definitvely talking about a client error. In the absence of a more\nspecific code (401...), one would use 400. But 400 is defined as:\n\n&quot;The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.\nThe client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.&quot; (RFC2616:\nstatus 400)\n\nWebDAV defines 422 for:\n\n&quot;The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the\ncontent type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type)\nstatus code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is\ncorrect (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was\nunable to process the contained instructions. For example, this error\ncondition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e.,\nsyntactically correct), but semantically erroneous XML instructions.&quot;\n(RFC2518)\n\nSo the point of view seems to be that the request entitity indeed had\nwellformed syntax, but wasn&#39;t semantically valid. Now we all know that the\nboundaries between syntax and semantics aren&#39;t THAT well-defined. So even\nthough the request body may be well-formed XML, an HTTP server could still\nclaim a syntax error.\n\nIt seems that the WebDAV WG didn&#39;t want to choose that direction and just\ndefined a new, more specific status code. This is perfectly ok, any client\nthat doesn&#39;t know 422 will have to treat it as 400, so no harm is done. As\nWebDAV is the product of an IETF working group (and is currently progressing\nto the next standards level), 422 is definitively here to stay, so I&#39;d\nrecommend just to adopt it.\n\n(it would be interesting to reseacg up how the WG came up with this design)\n\nJulian\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n"}}
