Please read on...\n\n&gt;&gt; Huh?  Please, find a clue.  TBL stopped implementing URI, HTML, and HTTP\nback in 1993.  Yes, 1993.  Since then he has spent an enormous amount of\ntime creating an organization that can, essentially, talk about them, with\nthe hopes of doing something more in the form of the semantic web at some\npoint in the future. \n\nIt is irrelevent that he stopped in 1993.  By then, he had momentum, but he\nfirst had to create it.  Quoting from Weaving the Web p 75: &quot;I no longer had\nto push the bobsled. It was time to jump in and steer.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; If you want to know how to implement an HTTP and URI-based service in\naccordance with REST...\n\nI&#39;m doing a lousy job of getting my fundamental point across. \n\nIt&#39;s not that I want to know how to implement REST, it&#39;s that I want the\naverage web developer to know how to implement REST.  \n\nHave you looked at at the public APIs that are claiming to be REST?\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:programmableweb.com+protocols+REST   For\nexample:\n\n* http://webjay.org/api/help - API design follows the REST architectural\nstyle. Webjay URIs almost always look like /[foo]/[username]/[short-name].\n\n* http://akismet.com/development/api/ - All calls to Akismet (at\nrest.akismet.com) are POST requests much like a web form would send.  \n\n* http://dev.hotornot.com/wiki/RESTFormat - REST is a simple request format\nusing HTTP GET or POST actions (verifyUserPassword, getProfile,\ngetRandomProfile, submitVote)\n\n* http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/developers/feedapi - FeedBurner web\nservices use the REST protocol to receive requests and return data over\nHTTP. (Find Feeds, Get Feed, Add Feed, Modify Feed, Delete Feed, Resync\nFeed)\n\n* http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php - All methods are\navailable over the public REST-based interface. Facebook API (beta)\ncurrently supports the following methods: auth.createToken, auth.getSession,\nevents.getInWindow, friends.get, friends.getAppUsers, friends.getRequests,\nfriends.getTyped, friends.areFriends, messages.getCount, photos.getAlbums,\nphotos.getCommentCount, photos.getFromAlbum, photos.getOfUser,\npokes.getCount, session.ping, users.getInfo\n\n* http://weblogs.com/api.html - Weblogs.com accepts form-based HTTP POST and\nGET requests for non-extended pings. For example, the following is a valid\nHTTP GET ping request: http://rpc.weblogs.com/pingSiteForm\n\n* http://soundtoys.net/contribute/api - Soundtoys uses a so called REST API\nto communicate using XML. ... Every URI can either be read or written(*) to\nby using HTTP GET or POST requests to identify the direction of the data\ntransfer.\n\n* http://cafespot.net/api/v1/ - CafeSpot&#39;s API is a simple REST API. API\nFunctions: place/find-near-address, place/find-near-point,\nplace/find-user-favorites, tag/find-all\n\nDo those look like they follow the full precepts of REST? (some may, but I\ndon&#39;t think they do. And there&#39;s a LOT more where these came from.)  Chaos\nin the industry around REST does not do you or (almost) anyone any good.\nWithout easy to follow guidance for the average web developer, things are\njust going to get messier and messier and I know you and the rest of the\nRESTafarians here don&#39;t want to see &quot;REST&quot; co-oped by a bunch of techniques\nthat are not REST.  Am I right or wrong on that?\n\nI&#39;m trying to say that if the RESTafarians as a group don&#39;t shepherd the\nmeaning of REST it will come to mean nothing good in the eyes of the average\nweb developer. And then you all will sit back and lament how people &quot;just\ndidn&#39;t get it.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; But perhaps you are right -- maybe I should have shown people how to\ncreate an architecture based on REST, instead of just talking about it.\n\nI don&#39;t know if you are being serious or sarcastic.\n\n&gt;&gt; REST is still-born?  Get a life.  You haven&#39;t even figured out what the\nWeb is yet and you want to lecture me on teaching.\n\nSorry, I should have worded that differently.  What I meant by that was that\nI don&#39;t think that the principles you and the RESTafarians hold dear are\nbeing implemented properly on a broad scale in the wild.  I&#39;m not lecturing\nyou, I&#39;m tugging on your coat tails trying to point out the riot that is\nbrewing outside the cathedral.\n\n&gt;&gt; Nobody on this list laments about SOAP....\n\nI said that because I remembered reading repeated jabs about people &quot;who\ndon&#39;t get REST&quot; and I remembered (maybe wrongly) that they often referenced\nSOAP.  It was really based on a feeling I got from reading the list, that\npeople here feel like they &quot;have seen the light&quot; while lamenting or\ncondescending other&#39;s who hadn&#39;t (for example, comments like this:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6864) Also, I\nscanned through many years of archives on the list too, so my feeling came\nnot just from recent posts but over the past several years. I can point it\nout in the future when I see again, if you like.\n\n&gt;&gt; All you have injected so far is whining.  If you want a different\napproach, first figure out what people are talking about and then try a new\napproach yourself.  I don&#39;t understand why you are venting, because\neverything we have done so far has succeeded pretty well.\n\nAs I said at the end of my prior email, I&#39;m going to stop bringing up these\nissues on the list (except for my reply to your email.) I&#39;ll instead just\nask factual questions to improve my understanding.\n\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t measure success by the number of people who attend training\ncourses because their boss told them to.  If you want to measure success\nthat way, then that&#39;s your problem.\n\nWhen did I say anything about people attending training courses?!?  That&#39;s\nnot how developers building Web 2.0 sites are learning.  \n\n&gt;&gt; REST is catching on just fine, without a dime spent on marketing. \n\nIN SUMMARY, I&#39;m not saying REST is not catching on, I&#39;m saying IT IS, and\nTHAT is the problem. With great power comes great responsibility. The\nproblem is REST is catching on in a manner that does not follow your\nprecepts; the precepts that the RESTafarians are so adamant about.  If that\nis okay with you, that people call things REST that are not, then fine; I\nwon&#39;t say another word.  \n\nI was really only trying to help; please don&#39;t shoot the messenger.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
