It&#39;s not nearly as good as simple time based \n&gt; caching of course, but it&#39;s still useful in some cases.  Also you could \n&gt; possibly allow private caches only though this is... tricky.\n\nI would avoid private caching in this case for the simple reason that \nwe&#39;re being a bit more &quot;quirky&quot; than some caches&#39; assumptions may allow for.\n\nI&#39;m convinced we&#39;d be okay per the spec, but not that we&#39;d be okay in \npractice if we allowed such private caching.\n\n&gt; More seriously, this could cause difficulties if you&#39;re doing anything \n&gt; other than GET on the resource.  If for example you want to POST to &quot;the \n&gt; current user&#39;s set of buckets&quot; to create a new bucket, you definitely \n&gt; don&#39;t want your POST turned into a GET.  I think the only other \n&gt; reasonable choice is 307 but that one still has problems with non-GETs; \n&gt; clients are supposed to confirm with users before redirecting a POST \n&gt; even with a 307, which is tremendously annoying in this context.  (Curl \n&gt; for example requires a special flag to do this.)\n\nTBH, I&#39;d rather model it as follows:\n\nGET:\n\n1. My client requests &quot;Buckets for current user (user is Jon)&quot;.\n2. Client redirected to &quot;Buckets for Jon&quot;.\n3. Client requests &quot;Buckets for Jon&quot;.\n\nAll is well on GET.\n\nPOST/PUT/DELETE:\n\n1. Client requests action be performed on &quot;Buckets for Jon&quot;, knowing \nthat I am Jon (this is reasonable state for the client to hold, it&#39;s the \nclient that manages who is logged in after all) and knowing the resource \nfor &quot;Buckets for Jon&quot; from above.\n\n\n"}}
