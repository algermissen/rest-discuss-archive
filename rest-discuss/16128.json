Absolutely yes.  REST applications are driven from one state to\nthe next via hypertext.  The user is presented with a selection of\nstate transitions to choose from (YYYY).  The user agent follows the\ninstructions in the hypertext to formulate a request, then reports the\nresults of the response back to the user as a new application steady-\nstate.\n\nHypertext, supplied by some representation of /is_leap_year, instructs\nthe user agent how to carry out the user&#39;s request to check if YYYY is\na leap year.  That request is a state transition, to a new steady-state\nof &quot;is not a leap year,&quot; &quot;is a leap year,&quot; or &quot;server malfunction.&quot;\n\nThat is a self-documenting hypertext API which, when the user requests\na state transition, instructs the user agent how to transition to that\nnext state, i.e. by making a HEAD request and interpreting the response.\nThe interpreted response is the user&#39;s selected state transition.  I\ncan&#39;t for the life of me figure out what else the hypertext constraint\ncould possibly mean.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; How you can expect to have REST without imparting meaning to\n&gt; &gt; response codes, baffles me.\n&gt; \n&gt; The meaning of the response codes are all well defined by RFC2616.\n&gt;\n\nHTTP is not a transfer protocol, it is an application protocol.  HTTP\nprovides generic semantics for methods and responses.  Putting those\ntogether into a REST system is the architect&#39;s job.  This may mean\nconstraining PUT to only have replacement semantics -- both creation\nand replacement semantics are allowed by HTTP, but a REST API must\nchoose one or the other.\n\nIt is well understood that 304 means unchanged in HTTP.  But what does\nthis mean to your application?  Well, whatever you need it to mean.  If\nyou make a PUT request, followed by a conditional HEAD, and receive a\n304 response, then for that application interaction 304 means failure.\nOr the hypertext could key off of the Etag in the 200 response to the\nPUT to determine success or failure.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If, on response=(200|304), my hypertext changes the application\n&gt; &gt; state to &quot;is a leap year&quot; then I&#39;ve just defined those response\n&gt; &gt; codes to mean bool=true within the context of my application.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you are tunneling through HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nTunneling what through HTTP?  If ?iso=2008-02-29 responds 200 OK, why\non Earth would I *not* interpret a 200 OK response to mean that 2008 is\na leap year?  That I have hypertext that took as input &#39;2008&#39; and\nreturned &quot;is a leap year&quot; based on _whatever_ factors is all that\nmatters -- can the interface be expressed over the network using\nhypertext?  Yes.  Couldn&#39;t be easier, unless you insist on making it\nhard.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If, on HEAD ?iso=2010-02-29, rel=next equals 2010-03-01, and my\n&gt; &gt; hypertext changes the application state to &quot;is a leap year&quot; on that\n&gt; &gt; basis, then I&#39;ve just defined *that* to mean bool=true within the\n&gt; &gt; context of my application.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, that is tunneling semantics through HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nTunneling what semantics?  I defined a resource, /is_leap_year, and a\nhypertext representation of that resource which takes as input YYYY and\nappends to that &quot;is a leap year&quot; or &quot;is not a leap year&quot;.  That&#39;s my\nresource definition, plain and simple as you like, and fully\ndeclarative.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The success/fail cases for the application located at:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://example.org/is_leap_year\n&gt; \n&gt; You seem to be mixing &#39;service (or Web application)&#39; with REST&#39;s\n&gt; meaning of &#39;application&#39;. The &#39;application&#39; is not defined by the\n&gt; service, nor by any hypermedia specification. The application is the\n&gt; involved components (servers, intermediaries, user agents) and data\n&gt; at runtime.\n&gt; \n\nNo, as I&#39;ve explained (paraphrasing Roy) plenty of times, a REST\napplication may be defined as &quot;what the user is trying to do&quot;.  The\nREST application here is simple:  determine if YYYY is a leap year.\nThe user is presented a hypertext control which is used to select the\nnext application state -- whatever year is being boolean-queried.  The\nnature of that application state depends on the year queried.  If the\nselected transition is &#39;2008&#39; then the next steady-state is &quot;2008 is a\nleap year.&quot;  Application terminates.\n\nREST applications are defined by their steady-states.  Those steady-\nstate transitions must be driven by hypertext.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
