I&#39;ve had success designing forward and backward compatible formats\n&gt; based on container media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; If your container is generic enough it won&#39;t need to change. You can support\n&gt; multiple versions by continuing supporting backward compat and adding new\n&gt; elements. Your v1 client still behaves the way, your v2 client doesn&#39;t know\n&gt; about v1. On the server side, you process the code by supporting backward\n&gt; compat (understand the previous elements) and forward compat (ignore the\n&gt; ones you don&#39;t understand, and advertise an error if something goes wrong).\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people would argue that it makes the code of your media type more\n&gt; complicated on the server, I&#39;d argue that this level of complexity to\n&gt; support multiple version will be the same even with different media types:\n&gt; you don&#39;t do the switch in the document parser, you somehow either\n&gt; reimplement functionality in each, or have a switch somewhere else.\n&gt;\n&gt; It follows the principle of the web: easy to produce, not easy to consume.\n&gt; But then again multiple version support is never easy, whichever path you\n&gt; go. I&#39;d rather leave that complexity where I control it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nI&#39;m not proposing to use different media types, I would use standard \nmedia types and simply add an extra versioning header to the conneg \nprocess i.e.\n\nAccept: application/json\nX-Version: 1.2\n\nThis removes the obligation of clients to handle evolving document \nstructures (but still allows this behaviour by omitting the version \nheader), and also removes the need for complicated, and potentially \nwasteful, multiple versioning within media types.\nI would argue that different versions of media types are seperate \nrepresentations of a resource, the same as content-language, and \nversioning should therefore be part of the conneg process in its own right.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
