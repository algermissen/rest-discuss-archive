In the meantime it&#39;s\n&gt; about accepting that a common centralised bunch of link relations are\n&gt; all the shared semantics that are needed and the rest can just be pushed\n&gt; into local schemas with no sharing.\n\nat least from my understanding of what we&#39;ve been doing over the last \ncouple of years, we never &quot;changed&quot; what REST is about. the uniform \ninterface always was and still is a central building block of REST, it&#39;s \nwhat works because of URIs. but before you can use the uniform interface \nof a resource that has been identified, you have been linked there, by a \ntyped linked that tells you about that resource in the context of the \napplication scenario, and thus what it means to interact with that \nresource (&quot;if you GET that picture, it is something that you can embed \nin the rendering of the HTML you&#39;re currently trying to display.&quot;). \ntyped links always have been another essential building block of REST, \nbecause without them, you would never be pointed to a resource in the \nfirst place, and then be able to use its uniform interface. if you look \nat HTML&#39;s link types \n(http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2009/10/links-in-html.html), i think \nit&#39;s fair to say that &quot;a centralized bunch of link relations&quot; (in that \ncase defined as part of HTML and not as standalone link types) have been \nat the very core of how the web works, why it works, and why it has been \nsuccessful. without those link types (i.e., with an HTML only containing \nuntyped generic links), the web certainly would have been a radically \ndifferent thing, and personally, i don&#39;t think it would have succeeded. \nanyway, the point i am trying to make here is that link relation types \nare and have always been essential to REST, and whether they are defined \nas an integral part of a media type, or externally and thus can be \nreused across media types, is more of a side issue.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
