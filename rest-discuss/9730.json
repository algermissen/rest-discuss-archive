I use message-based architecture here, \nbecause I see it as b=\r\neing different from so-called RPC.\n\nREST-based architecture somewhat suppor=\r\nts message-based architectures \nvia the use of &quot;overloaded POST&quot;.  I can in=\r\nstruct a URI on what \noperation to perform based on the contents of the POS=\r\nT body.\n\nHowever, the beauty of REST is exposed when semantic (business) st=\r\nate \ntransitions are exposed as (sub)resources at well-defined URIs.  \nThe =\r\n&#39;PUT&#39; to the (sub)resource simply becomes a \nstraightforward &quot;update&quot; to th=\r\ne resource itself - no hidden meaning \nis in it.\n\nFor example, I could POST=\r\n a &quot;ship&quot; instruction to &#92;orders&#92;[order_id] \nas the following:\n&lt;state&gt;ship&lt;=\r\n/state&gt;\n&lt;qty&gt;5&lt;/qty&gt;\n\nHowever, if I want to &quot;cancel&quot; that same order using =\r\nthe same \nresource (URI), the body of my POST would change to:\n&lt;state&gt;cance=\r\nl&lt;/state&gt;\n&lt;qty&gt;0&lt;/qty&gt;\n\nIn my opinion, a much cleaner design is to create d=\r\nistinct (sub)\nresources for each state transition i.e. &#92;orders&#92;[order_id]&#92;s=\r\nhipped \nand &#92;orders&#92;[order_id]&#92;canceled then PUT indicating the need for th=\r\ne \ncreation of the new state while updating the underlying resource.  \nThe =\r\nPUT would return (at least) a link to the next logical state - it \ncould re=\r\nturn links to all possible &quot;next&quot; states.  A GET on these \n(sub)resources w=\r\nould return true or false to indicate whether the \nparent resource is at th=\r\nat current state (business).\n\nAn interesting result of such design is that =\r\nit forces a designer to \nlook at a system (and the entities in system) in t=\r\nhe context of a \nstate machine.  State machines are powerful!\n\nI&#39;ve been lo=\r\noking at REST for about a year and some these ideas are \njust beginning to =\r\ncrystallize.\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n\n\n"}}
