I like my\n&gt;&gt; /datetime resource formatted differently than you do, so my display of\n&gt;&gt; this data is different than yours, based on us having different logins.\n&gt;\n&gt;In a case where it is necessary to deliver a human-readable representation\n&gt;directly from the server (i.e. web sites) then this can be a tricky issue. In\n&gt;the example of dates we have a choice of either customising the representation\n&gt;per user, or of using a format that is unambiguous even when it is less than\n&gt;ideal (e.g. &quot;2004-04-05&quot;, &quot;5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April, 2004&quot; and &quot;April 5, 2004&quot;\n&gt;are all unambiguous, 04/05/2004 and 05/04/2004 are useless[1]). There are quite\n&gt;a few issues either way.\n\nRight, and this is my point: varying content by user/role is, I think, a valid\nthing to do.  In fact, arguably putting the userid in the querystring is a valid\nthing to do since it is, in essence, a parameter to the &#39;view&#39; of a resource:\n&#39;This resource as viewed by userid X&#39;.\n\n&gt;In the case of a REST service where the server is sending data then one would\n&gt;just send the data in an appropriate format for the machine (in the case of\n&gt;dates we would use one of the profiles of ISO 8601 common on the web) and\n&gt;presenting this to any user can become the client&#39;s job (which is in a much\n&gt;better position to reliably determine locale settings than the server).\n\nSure; offloading the problem to the client is a fine thing, when you&#39;ve got\none :)\n\n&gt;&gt; Well, I see the issue as basically resource-specific gradations between\n&gt;&gt; &#39;full access&#39; and &#39;401 Unauthorized&#39;. The extremes are clearly allowed;\n&gt;&gt; why not the middle?\n&gt;\n&gt;Authorised and unauthorised are concepts understood by the system. The rest of\n&gt;the system (caching, firewalls) can understand them. An admin looking at the\n&gt;traffic can understand them. Providing partial access through allowing full or\n&gt;no access to related resources is merely expressing this gradiated security in\n&gt;a way the system understands. It&#39;s also similar to how other authorisation for\n&gt;file-based, RDBMS-based and other systems works (either you can read or you\n&gt;can&#39;t, either you can write or you can&#39;t, etc) and hence concepts of\n&gt;authorisation that developers are used to building and security people are used\n&gt;to auditing.\n\nBinary auth/unauth acces is fine for individual resources, but fails for aggregate\nresources where low-clearance people need partial access to the same resource that\nhigh-clearance people get full access to.  I guess the question boils down to:\ndoes/should security policy impact resource definition?\n\n\n  --pj\n\n\n"}}
