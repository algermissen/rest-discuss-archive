An Atom &lt;feed/&gt; is a correct=\r\n response from the POV of the media type spec, but we would consider a blog=\r\n server to be broken if it responded like this all the time.\n\nI also consid=\r\ner that it is inappropriate to send text/html to command\nline clients. I se=\r\ne it often in tutorials.\n\n&gt; Looking a the application the client intends to=\r\n create (the use case realized by the user agent) is not an option because =\r\nin a RESTful system the server does not (and must not) know the application=\r\n the client is trying to walk through.\n\nI guess that it comes from the stat=\r\neless constraint?\n\n&gt; All the server developer really has is the media type =\r\nspec of the media type it is going to serve.\n\nThere is also rfc5988 which p=\r\nrovides link relations &quot;outside&quot; a media-types.\n\n&gt; The solution to the &#39;pro=\r\nblem&#39; is that the server developer&#39;s task is not to implement something use=\r\nless, but to expose the capabilities of the server side component in a way =\r\nthat provides a benefit to the client, in a way that is useful. You could a=\r\ndd: in a way that maximizes re-usability.\n\nI have face limitations when thi=\r\nnking of re-usability. My first\nreaction is to modified my original ideas b=\r\ny bowing to what the\nstandards and protocol can do well for me. But that is=\r\n a matter of\nphilosophy.\n\n--Philippe\n\n"}}
