Pagaltzis wrote:\n\n&gt; The problem with that is the mindboggling amount of indirection\n&gt; you have introduced. You have an element containing whitespace\n&gt; text nodes and elements, and each subelement in turn contains\n&gt; whitespace text nodes and two elements, each of which contains\n&gt; a text node.\n\nThen problem being what? This is easy to suck into a Hashtable API if \nyou like. The issue is the APIs, not the markup.\n\nJSON is a clever kludge designed to work within the limitations of \nJavaScript 1.0 and browser APIs. However if E4X had been reliably \navailable across browsers it would never have been necessary, and \nprobably wouldn&#39;t have been invented.\n\n\n&gt; By comparison:\n&gt; \n&gt;     { &#39;foo&#39;: &#39;bar&#39; }\n&gt; \n&gt; That’s a hash containing a key with a string value.\n&gt; \n&gt; It’s called the XML Infoset.\n&gt; \n\nThat is *not* the only or the required model for parsing XML syntax. If \nyou want something else, use something else.\n\nInfoset != XML\n\n\n&gt; Another issue is that the structure you chose does not enforce\n&gt; uniqueness of hash keys at the parser level, which the JSON\n&gt; equivalent does. \n\nThat&#39;s a feature, not a bug. XML lets duplicate keys be expressed if \nthat&#39;s what the data requires.  XML does not impose semantics onto the \ndata. To the extent JSON does, that&#39;s a bug, not a feature.\n\n&gt; These things aren’t matters of opinion; the XML Infoset is\n&gt; objectively far more complicated than the JSON data model and\n&gt; does not admit direct mapping of data structures without a\n&gt; vocabulary and a bunch of local conventions that have various\n&gt; trade-offs depending on how you choose them\n&gt; \n&gt; But you cannot straight-facedly argue that the Infoset maps\n&gt; better or even just as well to JSON’s domain as JSON. Not by\n&gt; a very long stretch.\n\nYou brought up the Infoset, not me. Please don&#39;t put ugly words like \n&quot;Infoset&quot; in my mouth. I&#39;m talking about XML, not the Infoset.\n\nUntil you understand the difference between XML and the Infoset, you \nwon&#39;t understand why JSON is inferior.  The Infoset is *a* data model, \nnot the *the* data model. You are absolutely free to choose other data \nmodels for XML if it helps you to do so, including ones that ignore \nwhite space, barf on duplicate keys, or whatever you find helpful. And \nI&#39;m free to use a completely different data model *for the same \ndocument*.  The lack of a data model is precisely what makes XML so \npowerful.\n\nXML is about syntax, not semantics. Every semantic JSON adds makes it \nweaker and less suitable for network interchange of data and data \nmodeling.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
