There needs to be a &quot;REST for the REST of us.&quot;  Obviously, we&#39;d want those Ph.D.s who *do* understand REST at a deep level to vet it for accuracy, but I&#39;d love to see something concise that captured the key points that the people doing the &quot;engineering&quot; could work from.\n&gt;\n\nHaven&#39;t many people already tried this?\nCan we list the candidate &quot;simple stories&quot;?\nWhich do you like?\nWhich are the best?\n\nI mean, does this really need to start from scratch?\n\n"}}
