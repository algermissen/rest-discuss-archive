Is that wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; Completely wrong -- hypertext browsing on the Web is the most common\n&gt; use of REST-based applications.  The only reason that SOAP even enters\n&gt; the discussion is because some people tried to fix the major problems\n&gt; with SOAP that caused its resources to be unusable on the Web, and\n&gt; when they did so they used REST as the basis of their arguments.\n\nSo what&#39;s the concensus on using REST for implementing non-browser-based, \ndistributed applications? Do you think REST is a reasonable alternative to \nCORBA, EJB, RMI and SOAP for many distributed applications? Of course there \nare considerations like performance, security and transaction handling to be \ndealt with. I really like the simplicity of REST, being able to easily pass \nany XML and get any XML back ... defined by some type of schema. I&#39;m getting \nthe impression though that the people on this list see this as a fringe use \nof REST. \n\n\n\n"}}
