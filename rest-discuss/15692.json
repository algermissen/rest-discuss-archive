I have seen t=\r\nhat use for type. Please let me know if type does not provide that info.\n\nA=\r\nlso note that I&#39;m not saying, although it seems I do, that I MUST use the t=\r\nype indicated in @type. I say that info comes there, and that indicates wha=\r\nt you should expect! If you do, please note that you will have less visibil=\r\nity and it will limit you negotiation. It does not say that if you put the =\r\n@type in any media, you hopelessly be unable to negotiate any other type, a=\r\nnd that subsequent operations won&#39;t be visible, that is not the idea. You m=\r\nay ignore it altogether!\n\nType can also be use to define app semantics. So,=\r\n you have XML as the mediatype negotiated between agent-server, the type ca=\r\nn tell you that XML is an PO, or an serialized person object.\n\nSo, again, t=\r\nype is optional and, as you mention, is about documentation. There you can =\r\nfind info about the links and hypermedia.\n\nRegards.\n\nWilliam Martinez,\n--- =\r\nIn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Eric J.

Another way of getting the media=\r\n is using embedded metadata in the\n&gt; &gt; media itself. That is done, for inst=\r\nance, using the link. The\n&gt; &gt; mediatype attribute will tell you specificall=\r\ny which media you should\n&gt; &gt; expect to use for a particular link and operat=\r\nion. Of course, that\n&gt; &gt; reduces a bit the visibility (since an interim nod=\r\ne should know the\n&gt; &gt; media the link is embedded in to be able to &quot;see&quot; it)=\r\n and also limits\n&gt; &gt; the negotiation (the link &quot;suggests&quot; the media).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Once more:  @type has absolutely nothing remotely to do with content\n&gt;=\r\n negotiation, it does not &quot;limit&quot; it, it does not &quot;drive&quot; it, and it\n&gt; does=\r\n not reduce visibility (not using @type reduces visibility).\n&gt; \n&gt; It is sim=\r\nply an annotation.  Not any sort of instruction.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
