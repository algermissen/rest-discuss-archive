In REST a resource represents a service or a\n&gt; &gt; data element, and every significant resource should have a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Service&quot; seems to me a lot more like SOAP than REST.\n&gt; I think of resource as a significant business entity\n&gt; or an aggregation of business entities.\n&gt; Usually larger granularity than a data element.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure if this is true. Roy Fielding dissertation defines a\nresource as &quot;Any information that can be named can be a resource: a\ndocument or image, a temporal service (e.g. &quot;today&#39;s weather in Los\nAngeles&quot;), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a\nperson), and so on.&quot;  HTTP defines it as &quot;A network data object or\nservice that can be identified by a URI&quot;.  It seems like services are a\nvalid concept to assign a URI to.\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n"}}
