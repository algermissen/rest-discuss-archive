The verb is POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the protocol level, certainly we are POSTing the purchase order.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, at the application level, we are making an offer for a \npurchase.\n\nHTTP *is* the application level.  \n\n&gt; To use Paul&#39;s term, by recasting the offer action into a &quot;purchase \norder\n&gt; offer document&quot;, then you can use the generic verb POST.  In any \ncase, it\n&gt; simply means that we can model the same transaction in both a \ndocument/data\n&gt; way or a procedural method-call way.  They use different verbs.\n\nMaybe it would be good to look at this on the next layer up. \nThere is a business protocol - offer-acceptance - riding on top of \nthe HTTP+REST application protocol.  \n\nOffer-acceptance is a conversational protocol.  \nAn offer is more like a sentence in a conversation than a procedural \nmethod-call.\n\nI follow that there is more going on in state transfers than just \nGET, POST, PUT, etc.  And that there needs to be more layers of \nagreement than just the standard HTTP methods.\n\nSo if that is your main point, I agree.\n\nIf your point is that offer-acceptance is really a procedural method \ncall, I disagree.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
