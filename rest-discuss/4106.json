Searches\nare queries are &#39;?&#39;, and list is just a different type of resource that\ncontains things.\n\nThe semantics might be easier for others to understand with &quot;list&quot; and\n&quot;search&quot; there [until &quot;list&quot; changes], but you&#39;re looking to solve the\nreal problem there anyways, below...\n\n| Since each university might implement neither, one or both interfaces,\n| I would like to define a way for each university to &quot;say&quot; which\n| interfaces they implement... something like WSDL, that would allow\n| automatic service discovery among universities.\n| \n| Is there any standard way of doing this within the REST arch. style?\n\nYes: define a way to provide a semantic binding to automate things.\nRDFForms is a way to do that.  Some new/ad-hoc way might be good, too.\nThe arch. style can&#39;t really specify such things.\n\n\nWhat are you looking to automate?\n\nIf you&#39;re thinking about WSDL, it may be things like automagically\ncreating a YourFavoriteLanguage interface to call methods on a remote\nfunctional-endpoint space [even a document-based RESTful one].  If you&#39;re\nreally looking for ease of making that first spike through to the remote\nsystem, I&#39;d suggest doing this.\n\n\nAn issue, here, is that WSDL doesn&#39;t spec a &quot;full&quot; HTTP binding -- only\nGET/POST.  I&#39;ve been thinking that the spec doesn&#39;t matter so much as the\ndeployed clients, here, and Apache&#39;s WS efforts could be extended with a\nde-facto full binding.  Thus, WSDL could still be used to specify and create\nprog-language-descriptions for an on-the-wire full-HTTP, RESTful interface.\n\n\nBut I&#39;ve also thought that the WSDL people are trying to automate the\neasy part of the problem -- creating a specific language interface and\ncalling stubs.  The hard parts are still hard -- the full discovery and\nsemantic-binding of the interfaces ... what I need to know to write an\nactual program around those calling stubs to get real work done ... real\ndescriptions of the format and nature of the data-types involved, &c.\nBut now there&#39;s this big spec and tool in place that doesn&#39;t really solve\nit much better than something like javadoc or HTML.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
