It is one of those things that became untrue\nonce people realized that the interface had no reason to respect such\na distinction (and rightly so -- it introduces coupling where none is\nneeded) and so the distinction was removed server-side to reflect the\nmigration of resources to new implementations.\n\nThe resource in HTTP is the mapping from the entire identifier\n(including scheme, authority, path, and query) to a set of values.\nFor two resources to be the same, they must map to the same set\nof values for all time.  There is no way to determine that by\ninspecting the identifiers, aside from scheme-defined equivalence.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
