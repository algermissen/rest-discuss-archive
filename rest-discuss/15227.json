However, I&#39;ve seen lots of discussion on =\r\nthe\ngroup which have diverged due to misunderstandings. And yes,\ndisagreeme=\r\nnt is healthy, but not infinite disagreement as you noticed\nat the end. At =\r\nsome point, you have to call it what it is, agree, and\nmove on. And sometim=\r\nes, you can&#39;t see where you can move on to until\nyou&#39;ve agreed on the past.=\r\n The Web is moving on, and I think we&#39;re\nlagging behind due to various issu=\r\nes including this one.\n\nMaybe creating a wiki with definitions or collectin=\r\ng various material\ncreated recently would be of benefit, as you say. That&#39;s=\r\n actually what\nI wanted to find out - would it be helpful to you? What woul=\r\nd be\nhelpful to you?\n\nThanks,\nIvan\n\nOn Sun, Apr 11, 2010 at 21:26, William =\r\nMartinez Pomares\n&lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Ivan.\n&gt; I ag=\r\nree with you, but:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. In this group you have many people that actually =\r\ndo that, uses terms of what we understand, while other understand different=\r\n things. There are discussions that focus on that, defining the terms. So, =\r\nwe would need to put the group to agree, and that may be problematic, since=\r\n actually disagreement lead to healthy discussions.\n&gt; Even, some people jus=\r\nt left the group because majority did not agree with them, which turns out =\r\nbad.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. The other problem is we all have different levels of understand=\r\ning of REST. There are many that work with this everyday, and thus there ar=\r\ne some things that are a de facto reality, although academically may not be=\r\n totally congruent with the dissertation. Far more, the dissertation, some =\r\none proposed, may need an update since lots of things had happened since th=\r\nen.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, what can we do? The actually existence of this group is a step =\r\nforward. Actual promotion of the group so it is available to more people is=\r\n necessary.\n&gt; The This week on REST wiki is another great idea.\n&gt; Opening a=\r\n site with the &quot;official&quot; definitions and tutorial from all levels (not jus=\r\nt development) could be another one. Problem is we may have some trouble ge=\r\ntting all people, or majority, to agree on some definitions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any way, t=\r\nhe solution may come out from this group, or even from another one that may=\r\n start somewhere else. Not sure if the future of REST concept will be close=\r\nr to original idea or a derivation from the actual practices, but at some p=\r\noint there must be an agreement, or the concept will be diluted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Willia=\r\nm Martinez.\n\n"}}
