I would assume the &#39;naive&#39; solution would be to send\na hash of the answer to the user and then use both the hash (which the user\nreturns to the server) and the answer on the server side to see if they\nmatch. But that exposes the server to replay attacks. The approach I would\ntake (which violates the &#39;strict interpretation&#39; of statelessness) would be\nto create a new resource for the captcha on the server and compare the\nincoming answer with that, destroying the resource when done.\n\nI am unsure what approach would satisfy both requirements. My intention for\nstarting this discussion is not to inflame, but to better understand the\n&#39;strict&#39; statelessness POV.\n\nThanks,\nAlexandros.\n\r\n--0016e6d784ee12ebeb047e631ebf\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi All,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was wondering how you would implement a RESTful CAPTCHA so=\r\nlution, especially in the context of the strict interpretation of &#39;stat=\r\nelessness&#39; many on this list use.
