Looking at the mime type,\n&gt;&gt; representation content and relations or is it ok for the client to\n&gt;&gt; keep track of its path on its desired process (the one he expects\n&gt;&gt; *all* servers to follow)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It seems like the second one is not REST, is it correct? So the client\n&gt;&gt; should always infer its next step only based on its current\n&gt;&gt; representation, media type and relations?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; - the client sends a request to some &#39;entry point&#39; resources\n&gt; - the client receives &#39;main&#39; representation of resource\n&gt; - according to its configuration for the media type of that\n&gt;   &#39;main&#39; representation the client automatically performs sub\n&gt;   requests until it reaches the next steady state (e.g. Web page\n&gt;   with images and style sheets etc.)\n&gt; - the steady state reached is the current application state\n&gt; - from this current application state the client tries to\n&gt;   follow an available transition that takes it towards its overall\n&gt;   goal\n&gt;\n&gt; So, yes: client decides next step based on available transitions from\n&gt; current steady state and its own overall goal only. Client does not\n&gt; keep track of its prior interactions.\n&gt;\n&gt; (But the prior interactions can of course change the set of rules the\n&gt; client applies to every current stady state. IOW, the state that the client\n&gt; is in regarding its overall goal can of course affect the decisions at\n&gt; makes).\n&gt;   \n\n\nWhether or not the client keeps track of prior interactions will depend \non an application and its hypermedia. Complex application flows will \nrequire clients to maintain an understanding of their context in order \nto intelligently traverse from one state to another, IOW &#39;prior \ninteractions will change the set of rules&#39; - is this really different to \nclients keeping track of prior interactions? I think it&#39;s hard to make a \ncase for that in a determinate, state-machine world.\n\nOn the human web - we have the benefit of symbolism and the powerful \nmethods of inference that come with that; GUI stuff like icons, images, \nbreadcrumbs, and other stuff like natural language, etc. The machine web \ndoesn&#39;t have any of this because machines don&#39;t have common sense. This \nis where, for me, the parallel between the human web and the machine web \nbegins to break down a bit and the comparison stops making sense - and \nso it&#39;s also where the meaning and value of a &#39;steady state&#39; becomes a \nbit confused.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
