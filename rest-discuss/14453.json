Bowman wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My point is, the REST architectural style doesn&#39;t address key  \n&gt; &gt; aspects of\n&gt; &gt; system architecture, like storage.  So how can REST alone be the\n&gt; &gt; basis for any applied-software-architecture Implementation?  The\n&gt; &gt; Model should\n&gt; &gt; therefore address issues like isolation, concurrency and storage\n&gt; &gt; based on the REST-agnostic laws of long-running systems.  These\n&gt; &gt; laws clearly apply to the goals of any system that needs REST in\n&gt; &gt; the first place.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; RESTs primary goal is not fault tolerance but decentralized\n&gt; evolution, scalability and simplicity. REST&#39;s focus is coordination\n&gt; of components owned by independent parties. I think the comparision\n&gt; you try to make is a bit problematic.\n&gt; \n\nI think it depends on what one means by fault-tolerant.  I hate when a\nwebsite hangs entirely because some ad rotator isn&#39;t responding.  If my\nwebsite doesn&#39;t hang in such a case, I&#39;d consider it fault-tolerant, as\nit&#39;s the best I can do when dealing with third-party components.  REST\ntakes into account the unreliability of the network itself.  If my\nwebsite goes offline only in a particular region, I&#39;d consider it fault-\ntolerant.  So fault tolerance on REST&#39;s global scale, is a different\nbeast entirely from fault tolerance within a programming language or OS.\n\nBut you do make a good argument.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is certainly a lot of overlap between the area of  \n&gt; application. The stateless server constraint for example enables\n&gt; live server upgrade and the hypermedia constraint even enables\n&gt; changing the server side state machine while the client is stepping\n&gt; through it from hyperlink to hyperlink.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact I find it hard to see how you could achieve better fault  \n&gt; tolerance regarding the component communication than the fault  \n&gt; tolerance you have with TCP/IP, DNS and HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nExactly!  REST gets you most of the way to these laws for high\navailability systems.  If you really need Web scale and REST, you\nprobably want high availability anyway, so I think it may be useful to\nincorporate these ideas into an abstract model of a system, where the\npurpose of that model is to guide long-term development towards an\nideal that may always lie just over the horizon.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
