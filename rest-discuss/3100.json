I&#39;ve got my own little toolkit that \n&gt;I use for simple Python projects where Zope etc. are overkill. But here \n&gt;is where I get nervous: a toolkit that helps people use HTTP as it was \n&gt;designed to be used is an HTTP toolkit. Perhaps it is a _better_ HTTP \n&gt;toolkit than the ones that exist, but it is still an HTTP toolkit. \n&gt;Phil&#39;s example code is a perfect example of using HTTP right. I won&#39;t \n&gt;argue if Phil calls it a REST toolkit but I don&#39;t see a clear boundary \n&gt;between &quot;good&quot; HTTP toolkits and REST toolkits. When an HTTP toolkit \n&gt;strays from REST it is probably just a misunderstanding by the toolkit&#39;s \n&gt;author and we should probably work with them to correct it.\n\nI think a REST advocacy group is a great idea in theory, but I fear it\nwouldn&#39;t accomplish much in the real world without a lot of very patient\nand persuasive advocates. Most developers don&#39;t seem to care that much that\ntheir software doesn&#39;t work according to these abstract principles -\nthey&#39;re trying to get work done in the real world.\n\nFor example, the apache tomcat servlet engine breaks REST in at least one\nway. Just like in apache httpd, you can associate error pages with http\nerror response codes to present the user with something more elegant and\nsite-specific than the generic server-generated error content (the\nerror-page element of the web.xml deployment descriptor). Unlike apache\nhttpd, when tomcat returns that error content, it attaches a status code of\n200 instead of the original error code! Thus, 404 responses aren&#39;t noted as\nsuch by search engines, proxy servers, et. al. because they&#39;re rewritten as\n200 responses. I&#39;ve been trying for days now to get the tomcat developers\nto acknowledge the bug, but so far they&#39;ve ignored it.\n\n(If anyone wants to vote for this bug, it&#39;s\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15406)\n\nIt would seem that the developers either don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s a bug, or\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s a bug that&#39;s worth fixing. Either way, I&#39;m not sure how to\nproceed.\n\nAnother example might be apache struts. Struts heavily uses the\nRequestDispatcher servlet api to internally forward requests to different\ncomponents. In and of itself that&#39;s not a bad thing, but struts uses it to\nsuch a degree that the &quot;URL&quot; of a given page and the contents of that page\nmay have no relation to one another. It also seems to encourage developers\nto use the HttpSession object to store conversational state, which is\nproblematic from a REST point of view.\n\nFixing struts to be RESTful would require a serious amount of work, and I\nguess I doubt that the developers could be convinced that it would be a\nworthwhile investment. (which is very much too bad, since struts seems to\nbe very popular as a webapp infrastructure.)\n\nAny suggestions for addressing either these specific instances or the\ngeneral problem?\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
