This message\nserver can be secured as much as lucas wants.\n(Or we can reuse the existing mail server).\n\nIf the app lives on the mailserver then the\nnotification is handled immediately.\n\n\nIf the app lives on a client behind the firewall,\nthen it maintains either a persistent GET or a POP\nconnection to the mailserver and recieves messages\nwhen they arrive.\n\n(Yes, I know POP is polling, but that is\nirrelevant in this discussion -- actually it is\nan argument if favor of persistent GET -- thanks\nJeff!).\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
