I don&#39;t think this is what the TAG finding means. Let me quot=\r\ne a bit\n&gt; more from the finding:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [begin quote]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  A browser recei=\r\nving this form, or Bob if he views the source of the form,\n&gt; is assured tha=\r\nt the assigning authority is supporting an entire class of\n&gt; URIs of the fo=\r\nrm: http://example.org/cityweather?city=3DCityName\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  The same HTML F=\r\norm is also a computer program, executable by the browser,\n&gt; that prompts f=\r\nor and retrieves representations for all such URIs, and the\n&gt; English text =\r\nin the form assures Bob that these are indeed for weather\n&gt; reports. Bob is=\r\n not guessing the encoding of the URI or the nature of the\n&gt; resources refe=\r\nrenced =97 he is acting on authoritative information provided by\n&gt; the assi=\r\ngnor of the URIs. He can assume not just that he will get weather\n&gt; reports=\r\n for certain cities, but that no URIs in the class correspond to\n&gt; anything=\r\n other than weather reports (though some may correspond to no\n&gt; resource at=\r\n all). Bob could, with this assurance, write his own software to\n&gt; construc=\r\nt and use such URIs to retrieve weather reports. Of course, the\n&gt; typical W=\r\neb user would neither directly inspect the URIs nor write software\n&gt; to bui=\r\nld them, but would instead type in city names and push the handy &quot;Get\n&gt; the=\r\n weather&quot; button on his or her browser screen.\n&gt; [emphasis added]\n&gt;\n&gt; [end =\r\nquote]\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming that the code Bob writes lasts longer than what the cac=\r\nhe header\n&gt; says &lt;grin&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you agree that by this example, the TAG is =\r\nclaiming that the mere\n&gt; appearance of a FORM in a representation provides =\r\nsufficient assurance from\n&gt; the providing authority to subsequently encode =\r\nthe FORM&#39;s URI schema into\n&gt; software for an extended period of use by the =\r\nclient?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; If no, what do you think the TAG is claiming with this exam=\r\nple?\n\nI would hope that the software Bob is writing just parses the form,\na=\r\nnd doesn&#39;t assume the URI structure will remain static for all time.\nIt&#39;s n=\r\not clear what Bob&#39;s software is doing there though, so it could\nprobably us=\r\ne a clarification.  Why don&#39;t you bring it up with them?\n\nBTW, when discuss=\r\ning GET forms specifically, the whole&quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t\nchange&quot; issue might g=\r\net dragged in.  That&#39;s only a best practice of\ncourse, and so a Web consume=\r\nr cannot assume that a URI discovered from\na publisher will continue to ide=\r\nntify the same resource over time.\nSome people might miss that though.\n\nMar=\r\nk.\n-- \nMark Baker.
