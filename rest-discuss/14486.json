But I\n&gt; also thought I gave a good answer -- response codes and security\n&gt; implementation.  I was simply pointing out that anything beyond\n&gt; &quot;almost&quot; probably belongs in-line.\n\nAh, ok. Still (as said) I think response codes are uniform (their  \nmeaning and when they are applicable) and security is orthogonal.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I ought to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be able to determine everything I need to know that isn&#39;t covered by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; media type or protocol definitions in-band from the hypertext.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One question: how do you *choose* the service to interact with?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; By following a published link to some resource.  Any entry point on\n&gt; your system ought to allow me to navigate to whatever resource of\n&gt; interest I wish to bookmark as a future entry point.\n\nSo, there would then be a link relation that identifies the service  \ntype?\n\nWould it not be simpler to use a generic service relation and let the  \nclient (which might as well be a crawler that wills a registry) figure  \nout the service type based on what the service says about itself?\n\nAnyhow, neither way are you getting rid of the question what makes a  \nservice type and how one would code a client for that service type  \n*before* seeing any service instance. (Here is what I think: &lt;http://algermissen.blogspot.com/2010/01/service-type-specifications-ii.html \n &gt; )\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider the website I&#39;m developing now, for a local law firm.  Each\n&gt; attorney has an entry on cobar.org whether they want it or not.  I\n&gt; can&#39;t link from the attorneys&#39; entries on their own domain, to their\n&gt; entries on cobar.org, because cobar.org violates the identification of\n&gt; resources constraint.  The only bookmarkable entry point to their\n&gt; attorney-info retrieval service is at its root level.\n\nSounds like bad design, OTH, maybe cobar.org just does not want those  \nresource to be bookmarkable.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I ought to be able to publish a link from each attorney to his or her\n&gt; entry on cobar.org, and anyone following that link ought to be able to\n&gt; determine the URI allocation scheme from introspecting the link, and\n&gt; create their own link to some other attorney without ever consulting\n&gt; documentation.\n\nIf cobar.org&#39;s intention was to enable that, then yes. The link  \nrelation specs should define the involved template parameters to  \nenable URI construction from lawyer identity &#39;elements&#39; (e.g.  \nfirstname, surname).\n\n\n&gt;  Instead, I would have to disguise a POST form as a\n&gt; link, and that form could be introspected to determine the API, but\n&gt; you can&#39;t bookmark a POST request.\n\nYou could send your clients JavaScript code that executes the  \ncoburg.org application in th background to get to the desired  \ninformation (ignoring cross domain issues for the moment). For that to  \nbe possible there would need to be machine processable hypermedia at  \ncoburg.org.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But I digress.  It&#39;s just this pragmatic aspect of REST was thrown in\n&gt; my face yesterday, when I had to explain to my client why I can&#39;t link\n&gt; his page to his cobar.org profile.  He did not understand why I could\n&gt; not just link to something he could navigate to, initially.  Web APIs\n&gt; like cobar&#39;s put Web Developers between a rock and a hard place with\n&gt; their clients, that we shouldn&#39;t have to deal with at all.  Go REST.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
