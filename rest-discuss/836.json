As above, where the\n&gt; response could say &quot;Accept&quot; or &quot;Reject&quot; or maybe &quot;Counter Offer To\n&gt; Come&quot; (we&#39;re negotiating, and the deal is still alive).\n&gt;\n&gt; Or you could do:\n&gt; Acceptance-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/accept/\n&gt; Rejection-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/reject/\n&gt;\n&gt; In either case, couldn&#39;t you have an ambiguous state of the order\n&gt; with more than one PUT, one indicating acceptance, the other\n&gt; rejection?\n&gt;\nThe two headers &#39;reply-to&#39; and &#39;status-to&#39; were meant to separate out\nadvisory messages describing processing of a message from\napplication/semantic response messages. The &#39;reply-to&#39; is the authoritative\nstatus of the &#39;business response&#39; to the business request. More than one\ndiffering values PUT there would be an error (for most business document\nexchanges, some agreements may allow updates to invoices, etc., but I&#39;m not\na business guy so it may be those things are new resources somehow related\nto the original message). More than one differing value sent to the status\nwould be okay.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t put application specific concepts in headers - generic asynch\nmessaging and resource manipulation concepts would be okay though. So\n&#39;rejection&#39; and &#39;acceptance&#39; are busines concepts & should stay out of a\nheader name. They should be a value within a message body that is sent as\nthe &#39;application response&#39;. Knowing where to put the response is a generic\nconcept to request/response message exchanges. In a typical synchronous\nrequest/response, you just send it in the response (in http the correlation\nbetween req/resp happens because of the single connection, a wicked cool\nsimplification). In a two-phase request response, you put it to the response\nlocation - the location being the correlation information - but it is the\nsame concept as synch request/response.\n\nIn the sample the status is updated with PUT - but if the server wants to\nkeep a history, perhaps it should be POST. But I don&#39;t want the clients\nneeding to know what the server intends to do. I&#39;d like to expose the\nresource as the &#39;current status&#39; - no assumptions about &#39;extending&#39; an audit\ntrail - and so I used PUT.  If the server chooses to keep history, then I\nsuppose a new resource is needed for the audit trail - which would be a\ncollection of previously PUT entities.\n\n\n\n"}}
