I&#39;d like to have a formal notation\n&gt; for the protocol operations I&#39;m working on. The Z Notation is pretty\n&gt; good since it gives me functions, typed variables, and sets -- which\n&gt; is not bad since RDF models are essentially sets and I think I can\n&gt; treat protocol operations as functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;d really like something more specific to the problem domain. I\n&gt; will be spelling out the formalisms in the specification in terms of\n&gt; actual HTTP bits (headers, status codes, media types, etc.), but\n&gt; something formal would be really helpful. (For one thing, I can do\n&gt; formal manipulation of the sentences of a formal notation in a way I\n&gt; can&#39;t do with strings like &quot;GET /model-uri HTTP/1.1&quot;.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone found anything that would work here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Kendall Clark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
