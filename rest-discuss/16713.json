The constraint in\nquestion is the embodiment of the decision to expand MIME from e-mail\nto become *the* tagging-and-bagging spec for IP network protocols.\nChapter 6 extensively covers the topic of REST mismatches in HTTP,\nwithout mentioning the IANA registry...\n\nThere is simply no argument to be made against this, which doesn&#39;t\namount to advocating against standardization or against following the\nspecs as they&#39;re written -- both of which are against the point of REST.\nThe definition of self-descriptive is not &quot;has Content-Type,&quot; it is\n&quot;Content-Type contains a media type;&quot; the definition of media type is\nnot &quot;any string sent in Content-Type,&quot; but &quot;strings specified in the\nIANA registry&quot; -- when we&#39;re talking about HTTP and Internet Protocol,\nrespectively; application/foo+xml is not a media type, it&#39;s just a\nstring.\n\nREST clearly defines media type as representation metadata as per RFC\n2048, which clearly states &quot;A registration process is needed, however,\nto ensure that the set of such values is developed in an orderly,\nwell-specified, and public manner.&quot;  If Roy didn&#39;t mean to constrain\nthe value of Content-Type to a registered subset of publicly well-\nspecified media types developed in an orderly manner, then why does he\neven mention media types let alone refer to RFC 2048, and why does RFC\n2616 discourage the use of even the allowable x. syntax?  And, why does\nthis document:\n\nhttp://www.ietf.org/id/draft-masinter-mime-web-info-00.txt\n\nEven exist as an RFC process with one stated goal being to edit AWWW to\ngo from not mentioning media types, to explaining why they&#39;re critical?\nBecause the TAG has decided to move *away* from REST?  ;-)  Seriously,\nhow is anything I&#39;ve been saying in conflict with that document (they\neven mention poor ol&#39; Gopher)?  That&#39;s the TAG doubling down on the\nIANA registry...\n\nWhere are the voices of protest against that, which are so quick to\ncondemn my statements as absurd?  G&#39;head, let the TAG have it, that&#39;s\nwww-tag@..., if they&#39;re not following REST surely someone ought to\nlet them know?  Their goals are congruous with REST, so if their actions\naren&#39;t RESTful how will they achieve those goals if nobody steps up and\neducates them as to their folly?  Does the following passage not\nenumerate some of REST&#39;s key design goals?\n\n&quot;We need a clear direction on how to make the web more reliable, not\nless.  We need a realistic transition plan from the unreliable web to\nthe more reliable one.  Part of this is to encourage senders (web\nservers) to mean what they say, and encourage recipients (browsers) to\ngive preference to what the senders are sending... [We should] encourage\nbehavior which, on the one hand, continues to work with the already\ndeployed infrastructure (of servers, browsers, and intermediaries), but\nwhich advice, if followed, also improves the operability, reliability\nand security of the web.&quot;\n\nBy which the TAG clearly means _use media types_ instead of strings in\nyour Content-Type headers... not at all coincidentally, just as REST\nprescribes!  Something tells me not to expect Roy to post any criticism\nof the TAG&#39;s increasing focus on media types as the key to reliability,\ninteroperability and security at Internet scale.  Kind of exactly what\nI&#39;ve been saying on this list for the past year now, to the extent of\nediting the thesis, without rebuke from Roy...\n\nThis _still_ shouldn&#39;t be controversial at all, it&#39;s exactly what the\nspecs say, which is exactly the standardization that is meant by\n&quot;uniform&quot; in REST.  Nobody has provided any logical explanation as to\nhow &quot;uniform&quot; could possibly mean &quot;unstandardized random strings\ninstead of media types&quot; by *any* interpretation of REST or the\nstandards it refers to, or why it&#39;s irrelevant to Web architecture for\nuniform to actually mean ad-hoc.\n\nWhat is the sender intent here?  Is this a media type by virtue of\nbeing a standard linked to in a Content-Type header?\n\nContent-Type: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/\n\nHTML rendering or XML parsing?  That isn&#39;t a media type, it&#39;s just a\nstring.  Yeah, it&#39;s a URI that points to a standardized data type, but\nin terms of defining sender intent it&#39;s beyond useless, because that&#39;s\nwhat media types do, and a URI is not a media type, not even this one:\n\nContent-Type: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n\nThat is *not* self-descriptive because URIs are *not* media types by\nvirtue of being sent in Content-Type, and neither is application/foo+\nxml.  The only things that are media types, are listed in the IANA\nregistry, by definition.  Anything else is _just a string_ and does not\ndescribe sender intent, including and especially application/rss+xml,\nthe use of which is a _blatant_ violation of RFC 2048 and _still_\nrequires introspection to determine intent -- how is any identifier\nwhich fails to describe sender intent, self-descriptive of that intent?\n\nPracticing REST on the Web means you MUST use media types.  If there&#39;s\none hard-and-fast rule which always holds true, it&#39;s this one, and it&#39;s\nfundamental to the whole concept of REST&#39;s uniform interface.\n\n(I dream of the day when that last statement garners a single +1.)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
