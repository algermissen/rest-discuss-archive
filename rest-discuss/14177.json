You can implement a client using the\n&gt; specification. I can theoretically go out and write an AtomPub client\n&gt; right now using the RFC and AP spec.\n\nYes, right. I am trying to argue (maybe not that well, sorry) that the  \nreason you can do this based on RFC 5023 is that the RFC includes a  \nresource classification (collection, member, entry, media entry,..)  \nand also constrains the server regarding the media types it must use  \nin certain cases.\n\nWhen I do a GET on a collection (a resource that *is a*! collection) I  \nexpect an Atom feed back (there might be other representations  \navailable, but I&#39;ll at least be able to get an Atom feed). This  \nexpectation enables me to code the client and by coding that into the  \nclient, the server is coupled in a way that REST actually is aiming to  \navoid.\n\nIn that sense it is a &#39;fantasy&#39; that the server is free to evolve  \nindependently and it is also a &#39;fantasy&#39; that the client does not  \ndifferentiate between kind of resources.\n\nIn the human Web the same problem exists but the capabilities of the  \nhuman brain to react to change (and follow previously unexpected  \nlinks) does put the server in the position to evolve much more  \nindependently. I am sure that Amazon could mess around with the whole  \nshop and the way ordering works and the user would still be able to  \nbuy a book. This is the huge benefit of REST - it just does not apply  \nthat easily to the M2M case.\n\nAnd I think this needs to be said clearly and honestly and it needs to  \nbe theoretically captured.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
