She said it&#39;s easier to include as an attachment \nthan\n&gt; to try to cut and paste chunks out of it, because some context may \nget\n&gt; lost in doing so.\n\nThat&#39;s different from the situation I thought we were discussing.\n(Although some of the same principles would apply.)\n\nThe two situations:\n1. One contract refers to another contract (as above).\n2. Messages about contract fulfillment events (e.g. deliveries of \ngoods and services or payments) refer to governing contract clauses \n(as I thought we were discussing).\n\nThe usual practice with deliveries is to refer to the governing \ncontract (e.g. purchase order) by order ID (maybe + line number), not \nto attach the whole PO.  I expect the same would work for REST.\n\n&gt; The difference there from my previous statements, is that it&#39;s safe \nto\n&gt; use a reference in the case where the details of the other contract\n&gt; matter, iff it can be guaranteed to always refer to exactly that\n&gt; contract.\n\nYes, and don&#39;t you think something like Paul&#39;s reference format (URI \n+ hash) is the way to do it?\n\n&gt; Maybe some examples would help ...\n\nComing up...\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
