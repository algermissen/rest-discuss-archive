That is, they make it so\n&gt; that there isn&#39;t enough information in the HTTP message to understand\n&gt; what it does, because it depends on the information represented by\n&gt; the cookie which is invisible to everybody but the server.\nI&#39;m confused - a cookie is part of the HTTP message, both request and\nresponse.\nThe client can read and write them and so can the server.\nAnd anyway, combining information from the request and server-only state\nisn&#39;t a bad thing - security permissions, etc. do this all the time.\n\nThe problem I have is that they are often used to qualify the URI - for\nexample\nhttp://my.example.org/startpage.asp is the same URI for everyone, but the\npage - the &#39;actual&#39; resource - is different based on the value of the\ncookie. This makes the sample URI unsharable, uncacheable, etc. - which is\ngood or bad depending on what you are trying to do.\nThey are also often used to identify the user, or at least a user&#39;s\nserver-side session.\n\n\n\n"}}
