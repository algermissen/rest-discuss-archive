My CGI program is named guestbook\n&gt; and my domain name is metaperl.org\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /guestbook\n&gt;   returns the first 10 entries of the guestbook with links to page\n&gt;   forward to 11-20. REST supposedly works without cookies, so if a\n&gt;   user had a preference for entry listings per page, what to do?\n&gt; GET /guestbook?o=xml\n&gt;   returns the entire guestbook in XML format\n\nI&#39;d say that you should use the accepted content-types to arbritrate\nbetween what content-type to return the resource in and use a\nparameter (or a cookie) to suggest the number of entrys.\n\nREST frowns on cookies because they are orthogonal to URIs, requests\nand responses. But if you have a requirement for client side\npersistence then they&#39;re basically all you&#39;ve got. Just don&#39;t over use\nthem.\n\nBTW if you don&#39;t need the persistence that cookies give you then you\nreally don&#39;t need them. You can use Javascript to alter a variable\nsetting the number of entrys to display and then ref that variable in\nyour guestbook view url.\n\n\n\n&gt; POST /guestbook\n&gt;   adds an entry to the guestbook. But here is my problem, I need a URL\n&gt;   which returns a page that the user can fill in and hit submit. What\n&gt;   would such a URL look like?\n\nWell, the URL which has the FORM for doing the POST doesn&#39;t matter\ndoes it?\n\nYou might have the FORM in multiple places, on the guest book view\npage and on the front page and maybe other places.\n\nFrom a REST point-of-view the FORM is almost irrelevant, the FORM is\nonly used by humans to submit data. A web service would probably learn\nhow to submit to your guestbook URL in a different way (by doing a\nHEAD on the URL and checking the supported methods).\n\n\nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk\n\n"}}
