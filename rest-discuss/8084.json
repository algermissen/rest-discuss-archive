I thought that the\n&gt; purpose of that header was to retrieve a subset of the desired\n&gt; representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.5 \n\nMy point was simply about headers naming. It just wanted to illustrate \nthat &quot;Accept-Ranges&quot; is a response header that exposes *acceptable* \nranges exposed by a server.\n\nTherefore, in order to be consistent, it would make sense to reuse the \n&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;Accept-Language&quot;, etc. request headers as response headers \ninstead of defining new ones (&quot;Acceptable&quot;, etc.). Of course, this \nshould become formally described in an updated HTTP specification.\n\nBest,\nJerome\n\n\n"}}
