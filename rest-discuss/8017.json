And we\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want a specific URL for letting people browse Java\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; news and a different one for Java articles.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/articles/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/topics/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/news/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My requirements are that articles about Java and news\n&gt;&gt; about Java need two different URLs. /topics/java is one\n&gt;&gt; URL. At /topics/java I&#39;d expect to see any kind of\n&gt;&gt; content about Java, but that is not a requirement.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was assuming /topics/ were categorizations of articles and news, but\n&gt; articles and news themselves.\n&gt;\nI think you left a &quot;not&quot; out, but I&#39;m not sure where. However, what  \nI&#39;m after with topics is simply to show a listing of a subset of  \ndescriptions and links to articles (or news) about a certain topic.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I want to have something useful at each\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subpath. I could put a list of topics at:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /topics\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but that&#39;s not really deserving of its own page.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Why not?  It should list the topics available to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; covered.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually it would probably be tags, or just a search box.\n&gt;&gt; I lost confidence in listing topics a priori that content\n&gt;&gt; would fall into.\n&gt;\n&gt; I concur with that, but you can still have a URL with tags like  \n&gt; Technorati\n&gt; or Flickr, no?\n&gt;\nYes, if you change topics to tags that makes more sense to me to have  \nsomething under.\n\n/tags\n\nThat would let you browse any content based on tag. But I might call  \nthis /explore or /browse. But tags aren&#39;t topics.\n\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you could have such a page, but if I weren&#39;t forced\n&gt;&gt; to do it by the information architecture I wouldn&#39;t give\n&gt;&gt; this a page. I don&#39;t have one now and don&#39;t plan to have\n&gt;&gt; one in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt; What harm would there be to offer such a page?  Wouldn&#39;t it  \n&gt; actually be a\n&gt; benefit to users?  And it would definitely be a benefit in  \n&gt; increasing Google\n&gt; PageRank if used wisely.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure about page rank, but showing tags would make sense to  \nme. Again these would list content of any kind at Artima all mooshed  \ntogether: articles, news, syndicated RSS feeds, blogs, chapter PDFs,  \nvideos, audio, whatever. This does not solve the problem, however, of  \nlooking at one kind of content via a topic.\n\nWhere I&#39;ve been planning to go with topics is to replace what I have  \nnow with a search box in the left hand column, and the result would  \nbe a listing of articles (or news or whatever kind of content you&#39;re  \nlooking at a listing of) that fit the search query. Thus a /topics  \npage would be a lone search box, and it just doesn&#39;t make sense to  \nusers that it would just search a subset of content. I think it  \nshould be called /search or something and search the whole site. And  \nby the way, since they are entering a topic in a search box, it would  \ncome up as a get with a query parameter, hence:\n\n/articles?t=java\n\nWere I to want to put it here:\n\n/articles/java\n\nI&#39;d need to have Javascript form the query when you click the submit  \nbutton, and do a redirect on the server to catch cases with no  \nJavascript. I also considered that (see my earlier email about a9  \nversus Google) and decided against it.\n\nBut the other problem with /articles/java, which is independent of  \nwhether or not I use a search box, is that the namespace of topics  \ncollides with the namespace of articles.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I want to offer these lists sorted\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alphabetically and by reverse pub date. So going in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this direction I&#39;d need to do something like:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /alpha/topics/java\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /topics/alpha/java /topics/pubdate/java\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorting is not an entity, it is a layout/formatting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; directive. IOW, it doesn&#39;t change the content, only\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s presentation. So in a path is should be at the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; end, not the beginning, or in a param:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/topics/java/alpha \t/topics/java?sort=alpha\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d probably prefer the latter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well that was the point of my response. Your original\n&gt;&gt; question was why does one need query parameters?\n&gt;\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t asking as question with a goal of asserting a position, I was\n&gt; asking an honest question just like I asked honestly in my URLQuiz  \n&gt; about\n&gt; people&#39;s positions on the .WWW subdomain [1].\n&gt;\nI know. I thought you had perhaps forgotten the question since it  \ntook me so long to reply.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you have articles about Java listed at\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /articles?t=java, people can kind of get the idea\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the URl that this is a list of articles rather\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a list of news items.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But they can get the same idea if you segment as:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/articles/ \t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \t/news/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure if you mean /topics/articles here or\n&gt;&gt; /articles.\n&gt;\n&gt; /articles/ \t\n&gt;\nOh you mean with a trailing slash? Yes, I drop the trailing slash  \nbecause it is one less character. The only place where I plan to keep  \nit is the home page:\n\nhttp://www.something.com/\n\n&gt;&gt; If you say /topics/articles I think it is\n&gt;&gt; pretty clear. But I still feel / topics itself is\n&gt;&gt; artificial.\n&gt;\n&gt; I only picked it because it was mentioned in the thread. I have no  \n&gt; affinity\n&gt; to it.\n&gt; /articles for articles and /news for news works for me.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at here.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you want to look at news about Java and articles about\n&gt;&gt; Java, it is at:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /articles?t=java /news?t=java\n&gt;&gt; The query parameters yield a &quot;view&quot; of part of the\n&gt;&gt; concept to the left of the question mark, in this case,\n&gt;&gt; the subset of content items that fall under the &quot;Java&quot;\n&gt;&gt; category.\n&gt;\n&gt; OTOH, I would far prefer to see:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \t/articles/java/ \t\n&gt;  \t/news/java/\n&gt;\n&gt; As well as:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \t/java/articles/ \t\n&gt;  \t/java/news/\n&gt;\n&gt; (But then we have been down that path on this forum with far more\n&gt; conversation participants than just you and me, haven&#39;t we? :)\n&gt;\nYes. I have a big problem with /java. Because you&#39;ve now said that  \ntopics can be at the root. That doesn&#39;t leave much room for anything  \nelse, because the namespace of topics could collide with anything. At  \nthe root I want to have full potential in the future to add new kinds  \nof things. So I wouldn&#39;t put anything with an unlimited namespace at  \nthe root. Amazon did this at a9, and that means they will never be  \nable to put anything else at a9 besides search results, unless they  \nwant to break URLs. Maybe breaking URLs is not so bad at a search  \nengine, but I would have put something like &quot;search&quot; in the path:\n\nhttp://a9.com/search/dog+cat\n\nrather than\n\nhttp://a9.com/dog+cat\n\n&gt;&gt; What I&#39;m claiming is that yes, you potentially could try\n&gt;&gt; to force everything into path fields (between the\n&gt;&gt; slashes), but named parameters are often a better fit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed in general, but given the above example not agreed in  \n&gt; specifics.\n&gt;\nI think the problem here is that it is difficult to explain my  \nrequirements. Given my requirements, it doesn&#39;t make sense to put  \ntopics in a path segment.\n\n&gt;&gt; You can leave a named query params completely out to say\n&gt;&gt; it is at its default value, whereas using a path field\n&gt;&gt; for everything would require you to actually put a\n&gt;&gt; default character in the URL, because you need something\n&gt;&gt; in each position (unless what you want to leave out is at\n&gt;&gt; the end).\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you give me an example where this is a problem?  I&#39;d like to  \n&gt; see how I\n&gt; would address it (if you have given such an example to date, sorry,  \n&gt; I missed\n&gt; it.)\n&gt;\n/alpha/topics/articles/java\n/articles?o=a&t=java\n\nThese would show an alphabetical listing of articles about Java. The  \ndefault would be by reverse publication date:\n\n/chrono/topics/articles/java\n/articles?t=java\n\nIn the latter case, I just leave the o= query out. But in the former,  \nI need to put something in the path segment because path segments are  \nparsed by position. So I put &quot;chrono&quot;.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
