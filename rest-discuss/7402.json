They are three different \n&gt; resources that demarcate the same state :)\n\nhehe\n\n&gt; In practice you will want a &quot;permalink&quot; that can be \n&gt; bookmarked consistently and referred to consistently \n&gt; elsewhere. \n\nPermalink to what?  All three? \n\n&gt; The data from that resource might be available \n&gt; elsewhere, but it still has a one true home that can be used \n&gt; as its identifier. The other resources that refer to the same \n&gt; state should normally include a link to this permanent home.\n\nI agree with that point,... except.  Not I really do, that had been my\nconclusion. But as I look at this example I created, how does one decide\nwhich is canonical?  And since each has different breadcrumbs, they are\narguably different, depending on the use-case for the person bookmarking.\n\nFrankly, I think I have a lot of thinking to do on this issue...\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
