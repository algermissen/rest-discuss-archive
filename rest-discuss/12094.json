In addition\nto freeing the server from the scalability problems of storing state,\nthis allows the user to directly manipulate the state (e.g., a Web\nbrowser&#39;s history), anticipate changes to that state (e.g., link maps\nand prefetching of representations), and jump from one application to\nanother (e.g., bookmarks and URI-entry dialogs).\n&quot;\n\nSo you should book mark to jump from one application to another , but\nnot to land up somewhere in a transient state of an application via a\nbookmark.\n\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a pretty major change in Web architectural thinking (or at\n&gt; least emphasis) to now say (effectively) that a significant class of URIs\n&gt; should NOT be cool, ie one should NOT expect them to be useable\n&gt; indefinitely.\n\nthis is an inference that I don&#39;t like and I think it is wrong.\n\n lets say : hugeretailer.com/creditcardtransaction/enterdetails  is\nnot something bookmarkable as it is an intermediate step through the\napplication (which is &quot;credit card transaction&quot;). But if someone does\nbookmark it and go there directly, then the server shouldn&#39;t return a\n404 but return something stating that you haven&#39;t followed the right\npath.\n\n\nI think I am arguing for both sides of the debate - but thats mostly\nbecause I am really confused and not sure what is correct ... so\nforgive me !\n\n\nCheers\nDevdatta\n\n"}}
