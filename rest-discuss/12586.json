My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; .... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;orde=\r\nr id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=3D&quot;http://example.com/orders=\r\n/333/cancelled&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I have a CANCEL link that if I =\r\nfollow changes the state of my\n&gt; resource. Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that =\r\nI&#39;ve embedded it as a link.\n&gt; Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn=\r\n&#39;t very RESTful by itself,\n&gt; but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n\nThe pre=\r\ncise value of a URI is not, in and of itself, &quot;RESTful or not\nRESTful&quot; ... =\r\nit is about how your overall architecture matches up to\nthe REST architectu=\r\nral patterns.  In the case at hand, how does your\nclient know wha URI to us=\r\ne for canceling an order?  If it&#39;s discovered\n(as you describe here with a =\r\n&lt;link&gt; -- but a JSON field that said {\n... &quot;cancel&quot; : &quot;/orders/333/cancelle=\r\nd&quot; ... } is semantically\nequivalent, so the syntax isn&#39; the important bit -=\r\n- and you do a POST\nto it for a state change, you can certainly claim this =\r\nis a RESTful\napproach.  If you just do the POST part but make the client do=\r\n a\nstring concatenation (&quot;/orders&quot; + orderId + &quot;/cancelled&quot;), well not\nquit=\r\ne so much ... but that&#39;s still a *lot* better than cancelling an\norder with=\r\n a GET :-).\n\nCraig\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
