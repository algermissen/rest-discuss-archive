For example, a VoiceXM=\r\nL interpreter would send a message down to the platform telling it to queue=\r\n an audio file in the prompt queue, another message might tell the platform=\r\n to start playing the prompt queue and an event from the platform would tel=\r\nl the interpreter when the prompt playing had completed. At this point the =\r\ninterpreter would do whatever the page told it to do in response to that ev=\r\nent such as follow a link to another page.\n\nIn fact the VoiceXML specificat=\r\nion explicitly describes this relationship between an interpreter and a pla=\r\ntform: http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/#dml1.2.1\n\nAnd when you look at it t=\r\nhis way, there is no difference between machine-oriented and user-oriented =\r\nreally. Each hypermedia language is just a declarative program (well some h=\r\nypermedia languages like VoiceXML are a little more imperative than they sh=\r\nould be) for an interpreter that drives a specific flavor of platform. Some=\r\n platforms just happen to implement a UI.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
