In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular, POST says something about a resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to be changed in some way.  NOTIFY signals that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the change has already happened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t.  The resource identified by the callback URI can be whatever\n&gt; the subscriber wants it to be.  If it&#39;s a semaphore, then PUT or POST\n&gt; is fine.  If it&#39;s a mailbox, then POST is good.  I dare you to try and\n&gt; choose a resource that&#39;s used to receive notifications that can&#39;t\n&gt; receive them with PUT or POST.\n\nIt&#39;s not the method name that is important to me, it is the meaning - that a\nnotification is about a change that already happened.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
