I c=\r\nlaim there&#39;s no difference at all between options two\n&gt;&gt; and three, as at l=\r\neast from a REST perspective there&#39;s no difference\n&gt;&gt; between a query param=\r\neter and a file extension.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I wonder why you&#39;d disagree?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bec=\r\nause this is a common misconception that arises from the notion of\n&gt; URI op=\r\nacity.  REST&#39;s notion of opaque URIs does not somehow override RFC\n&gt; 3986, =\r\nwhich transparently declares quite some difference between path\n&gt; and query=\r\n.  Roy would say, &quot;[Q]uery is not a substitute for\n&gt; identification of reso=\r\nurces.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext=\r\n-driven#comment-720\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t interpret this the same way; it would be in=\r\nteresting to get Roy&#39;s take on this.\n\n&gt; Just think about how any httpd hand=\r\nles incoming requests.  If the query\n&gt; is being used as a filename extensio=\r\nn (violating the Identification of\n&gt; Resources constraint), then you&#39;d have=\r\n some processing to do in order\n&gt; to attach the query data to the path data=\r\n before continuing.  Using a\n&gt; filename extension requires no such query pr=\r\nocessing at the server.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I get what you&#39;re saying. Using or no=\r\nt using something like mod_rewrite to turn &quot;?format=3Dpdf&quot; into &quot;.pdf&quot; does=\r\n not change anything with regards to RESTful HTTP usage from my understandi=\r\nng.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So clearly, they are not the same.  Since URIs are opaque, there =\r\nis no\n&gt; way for an intermediary to determine that the query is being mis-us=\r\ned\n&gt; as a filename extension.  It is well known that intermediaries tend no=\r\nt\n&gt; to cache responses to requests containing queries.  \n\nThat used to be t=\r\nrue, particularly for Squid, but is no longer the case. Even so, other inte=\r\nrmediaries don&#39;t cache anything by default; I don&#39;t see how that would supp=\r\nort your argument either.\n\n&gt; The use of a\n&gt; filename extension as a filenam=\r\ne extension is well understood by\n&gt; intermediaries, whereas using a query a=\r\ns a filename extension is not.\n&gt; \n\nIMO any intermediary making such as a di=\r\nstinction is broken. But in any case, I&#39;d be interested which ones this app=\r\nlies to?\n\nBest,\nStefan\n\n&gt; -Eric\n\n\n"}}
