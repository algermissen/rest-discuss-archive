Search for Squid\n&gt; &gt; and reverse proxy: http://www.google.com/search?q=squid+reverse+proxy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For small to medium scale, if you use Java servlets you can use\n&gt; &gt; connect an Apache web server to a number of hosts running a servlet\n&gt; &gt; engine (Tomcat, Resin, JBoss etc).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At some point you will saturate a single host with network traffic\n&gt; &gt; (not to mention the single point of failure), so you then buy\n&gt; &gt; specialized hardware - F5 load balancers or Cisco load balancers.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure what to do when you run out of room with those hardware\n&gt; &gt; solutions.\n&gt;\n&gt; You don&#39;t really need those.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have a RESTfull app it will be simpler to make it horizontally\n&gt; scalable. So you just add more webservers and have DNS roundrobin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n&gt;\n\n"}}
