I&#39;m pretty\nsure Roy has stated a couple of times that hypertext should&#39;v=\r\ne been\nfleshed out in his dissertation but never made it because of time\nco=\r\nnstraints i.e. not because it &#39;hypertext is a layer above REST&#39;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One =\r\nof the major issues I have with the RDF model is that it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; objective see=\r\nms to be to make every resource a possible &#39;starting\n&gt;&gt; point&#39; - i.e. it tr=\r\nies to provide a model for &#39;bootstrapping&#39; a\n&gt;&gt; machine client into a conte=\r\nxt for any &#39;generic&#39; resource on the web.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong; I hat=\r\ne RDF myself, a bunch of sissy triplets\n&gt; (triplets! Hah!) and anonymous no=\r\ndes trying to act all-encompassing and\n&gt; shareable, but with deep fundament=\r\nal problems (persistent identifiers, and\n&gt; the aboutness of resources) ... =\r\n:)\n&gt;\n&gt; However. RDF&#39;s heart is in the right place; ontology. And it is thro=\r\nugh a\n&gt; separate ontology you get your semantics.\n&gt;\n\nDon&#39;t really mind what=\r\n we call it; as long as it is capable of\npresenting a succinct, coherent, h=\r\numan-readable description of the\nvarious ways a hypertext application can b=\r\ne traversed.\n\nnot very fond &#39;ontology&#39; though because the word stinks a bit=\r\n of\nesotericism, and I prefer to think and talk about hypertext\napplication=\r\ns in terms of happening rather than being anyway.\n\n&gt;&gt; We don&#39;t have this in=\r\n REST, instead we have a limited set of entry\n&gt;&gt; points and from then on di=\r\nscovery/traversal of an application at run\n&gt;&gt; time. This means there&#39;s a to=\r\nnne of features (read: bloat) and\n&gt;&gt; assumptions that are inherent to imple=\r\nmentations like RDFa which, from\n&gt;&gt; a REST pov, are at best distracting and=\r\n at worst actually corrosive to\n&gt;&gt; the kinds of behaviours we are trying to=\r\n invoke when designing RESTful\n&gt;&gt; hypertext applications.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, big word=\r\ns. Sure, the HTTP payload can be vexing, but far from hard to\n&gt; solve (cach=\r\ning, being a big one) using a multitude of ways; cached maps,\n&gt; cached reso=\r\nurce mapping, cached vocabulary mappings, cached result-sets (of\n&gt; generics=\r\n), and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to say; create a crap HTTP client, and you&#39;ll get =\r\na crap HTTP system.\n&gt; There is no need to create a crap HTTP client.\n&gt;\n\nThe=\r\n problem I have with this advice is that in a distributed context\n(e.g. a b=\r\nig SaaS API) the clients will be not be written by me,\nthey&#39;ll be written b=\r\ny other people with their own (crappy) opinions\nand (crappy) technology sta=\r\ncks.\n\nThe real art of designing a REST application is in coaxing/herding th=\r\ne\nclients you don&#39;t control into adopting behaviours which will afford\nyou =\r\nthe flexibility to evolve. In many cases this means an application\ndesign t=\r\nhat compromises on &#39;perfection&#39; in order to lower the barrier\nto all the st=\r\nupid clients e.g. this is exactly the reason there are no\n&#39;forms&#39; in HAL.\n\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; REST&#39;s perspective on semantics seems to be based on a relational\n&gt;&gt; the=\r\nory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory) whereas RDF&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; persp=\r\nective seems to be based on more of an absolute theory\n&gt;&gt; (http://en.wikipe=\r\ndia.org/wiki/Absolute_theory). I believe this\n&gt;&gt; difference =A0is at the ro=\r\not of the apparent schism between REST and RDF\n&gt;&gt; and I can&#39;t find a way to=\r\n reconcile this, so I avoid RDF.\n&gt;\n&gt; It now depends on what you mean by RDF=\r\n; the model (triplets, namespaces,\n&gt; etc.), the RDF ontology, the RDFS, OWL=\r\n (any of the three levels), or some\n&gt; model that uses the RDF family model =\r\nto create something else (possibly\n&gt; meta). I can map RDF to Topic Maps jus=\r\nt dandy, and create full-blown frames\n&gt; theory graphs (named or otherwise) =\r\nwith cumulative histographical node\n&gt; hopping just fine, so for me there is=\r\n no limitation that RDF itself is a\n&gt; faulty model. (And, truth be told, I =\r\ndon&#39;t use an RDF inferencer, I use\n&gt; Topic Maps all the way down, including=\r\n plural persistent identification\n&gt; management and separation of concerns b=\r\netween ontology, meta-data and data)\n&gt; I don&#39;t shun RDF (or, more specifica=\r\nlly, RDFa) as it&#39;s a well-known, often\n&gt; used (well, more these days) metho=\r\nd of creating key-value pairs attached to\n&gt; an ontology, and so just map th=\r\nose to whatever you need it for. I seriously\n&gt; fear that bringing these kin=\r\nds of semantics anywhere near REST will be the\n&gt; end of all that is good on=\r\n the web.\n&gt;\n\nAre these read/write applications or just read?\n\nDo you have m=\r\nany external clients to your application? Did any of them\nhave no experienc=\r\ne with RDF before interacting with your application?\nIf so how did the &#39;on-=\r\nboarding&#39; process go for them wrt RDF?\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
