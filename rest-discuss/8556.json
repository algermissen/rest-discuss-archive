The current state of the protocol state\n&gt; machine is represented by the URI you just operated on and the state\n&gt; representation you retrieved. You change state by operating on the URI of\n&gt; the state you&#39;re moving to, making that your new state. A state&#39;s\n&gt; representation includes the links (arcs in the graph) to the other states\n&gt; that you can move to from the current state.&quot;\n\nI am finding your example a little too abstract to be\nhelpfull. However, I would say that the trouble is your state is too\nsimple to be modelled by multiple resources and therefore hypermedia.\n\nIt *looks* to me like a single resource that is just changed to\nreflect that state it&#39;s in at any one time.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if your application has only one state variable than\nthere isn&#39;t going to be much hypermedia.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
