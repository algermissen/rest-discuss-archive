Modeling a &#39;property&#39; as a collection that is URI\naddressable. Using POST to &#39;add&#39; to a collection (is that create+insert or\njust insert?).\nBut how do people know that &#39;properties&#39; is a name (in the response headers)\nto use? Is defined by DAV or something?\nHow do people know &quot;;name&quot; is the format of URIs? Have you figured out the\nopacity issues?\nGiven that the technology of the day (.asp .jsp) doesn&#39;t allow for &#39;extra\npath info&#39; you will see urls for properties like:\nhttp://www.clewless.com/monitors/subs.asp?customer=27\n\nTry appending &quot;;subscriptions&quot; on the end of that.\n\nMight need multiple response headers or a single multi-valued header.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
