REST and Ajax  \n blend elegantly together, but REST can also be used alone, with just a     \n computer-to-computer solution. Like Ajax, REST can be used with today&#39;s    \n existing technologies. Millions of client computers are now Ajax-ready,    \n and millions of servers are REST-ready.                                    \n                                                                            \n\n\n\nDonald.\nThis email is sent by or on behalf of the named sender identified above.
