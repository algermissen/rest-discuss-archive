None of which you could infer from the XML.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a difference.\n\nIt&#39;s the difference between structured versus nominal types. I don&#39;t\nthink you can say one form is better than the other without saying what\nthe problem context is.\n\nFor now, it seems that JSON works out by virtue of targeting a \ncontrolled environment, the browser. Perhaps it does a better job of \ndefining the right subset of nominal types for programmers working in \nlanguages like Python/Javascript than XSD did (in its attempt to define \na superset of types for all-comers). If JSON turns out not have the \nproblems that SOAP+XSD did in the same places that SOAP+XSD has had \nproblems, that might say something about XML. Until then, I&#39;ll reserve \nmy judgment.\n\nGenerally on &quot;self-descriptive&quot;. The amount of information carried by a \n  format is in large part a feature of what evaluates the format. \nPowerful evaluators would be things like Lisp interpreters and truth \nmaintenance engines. After watching people around XML, then RDF, then \nREST repeatedly confuse each other, I find it helps not use \n&quot;self-descriptive&quot; as a term at all.\n\nAnother way of looking at it - if you&#39;re arguing up media-types as \nproviding &quot;self-description&quot;, you should really be jumping into RDF and \nweb interlingua; they do so much more and thus will provide even more \n&quot;self-description&quot;. Likewise, if you&#39;re arguing up JSON as providing \n&quot;self-description&quot; you should be jumping into javascript and/or Lisp as \nthey provide even more &quot;self-description&quot;.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
