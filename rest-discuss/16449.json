In any system with a notion of\n&gt; resource vs. representati=\r\non, it&#39;s essential that producers be able to\n&gt; communicate the intended pro=\r\ncessing model to consumers.  Sometimes I\n&gt; serve (X)HTML as text/plain, if =\r\nmy intent is that the entity be\n&gt; displayed rather than rendered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Abse=\r\nnt any clear description of producer intent, payloads have zero\n&gt; meaning i=\r\nn any system where the resource/representation dichotomy\n&gt; exists (i.e. RES=\r\nTful systems).\n\nFair enough -- just think that Mike was using &quot;most importa=\r\nnt&quot; quite differently.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But I think it&#39;s fair to say that self-d=\r\nescriptive representation\n&gt; &gt; formats are not unimportant as they yield key=\r\n benefits (again see\n&gt; &gt; 5.1.2 -- but they&#39;re important for data encapsulat=\r\nion and\n&gt; &gt; evolvability).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You lost me there.

As I&#39;ve been using it: a format used in th=\r\ne payload of a message (along with a corresponding media type value in the =\r\nheaders), is &quot;self-descriptive&quot; if it allows the entire message to be self-=\r\ndescriptive. i.e. it&#39;s a format with an assigned media type and specificati=\r\non capable of being understood (e.g. it&#39;s listed in the system&#39;s registry o=\r\nr equivalent) by all parties in the system.
