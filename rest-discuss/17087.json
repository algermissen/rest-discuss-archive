It will then inspect the representation received=\r\n for a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; form (based on it&#39;s out-of-band knowledge that the page it is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; looking for contains a form).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s going to take more out-=\r\nof-band knowledge than that. =A0I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; understand the expectation that=\r\n a form be self-describing such that\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s generally usable by random, a=\r\nutomated clients, as an argument\n&gt; &gt; in favor of attempting such functional=\r\nity through the minting of\n&gt; &gt; custom media types. =A0Domain-specific vocab=\r\nulary, i.e. RDF\n&gt; &gt; ontologies, seems to be the future direction; which has=\r\n no bearing\n&gt; &gt; on media type beyond which ubiquitous ones to choose to rep=\r\nresent\n&gt; &gt; the API as an active document.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rdfa is an interesting techn=\r\nology.  It might help in significant ways\n&gt; in the area.  However, i don&#39;t =\r\nthink it is going to be an panacea.\n&gt; \n\nBut it sounds like panacea is exact=\r\nly what everyone wants...  ;-)  If\nRDFa isn&#39;t it, I believe it at least ser=\r\nves as proof-of-concept that\nthe policy/contract problem is best solved at =\r\nthe component layer, not\nthe connector layer.  It at least points a reasona=\r\nble way forward,\nproviding an integration point for the linked-data world a=\r\nnd REST\narchitecture.\n\nI&#39;d like to see RDFa support added to existing XML l=\r\nanguages, it would\nbe interesting to see the same domain-specific vocabular=\r\ny used to\nmanipulate both a Web interface and a telephony interface to the =\r\nsame\ngoal.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why would it do that? =A0I&#39;d write such a client by f=\r\nirst determining\n&gt; &gt; the name-value pairs the API is expecting, tell it whi=\r\nch associated\n&gt; &gt; data from the wiki goes where, and POST to the target as =\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; urlencoded query.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why would you ignore the hyper media controls=\r\n on the page?  Why would\n&gt; you honor the target of the form and not the spe=\r\ncification of the\n&gt; expected representation?\n&gt; \n&gt; What if the form is updat=\r\ned with a new drop down?  If you use the\n&gt; request representation specified=\r\n in the form script would continue to\n&gt; work.  If you don&#39;t it would only w=\r\nork if the server is nice enough to\n&gt; support both the representation it sp=\r\necifies in the page and some\n&gt; other arbitrary inputs that poorly designed =\r\nscripts might send.sent\n&gt; \n\nOK.  So what we&#39;re after isn&#39;t just the method,=\r\n target, name-value pairs\nand format -- IOW, the service API at the connect=\r\nor layer.  What we&#39;re\nafter is an API for the dereferenced representation. =\r\n Since each form\ncontrol can be assigned an @id, each control is a resource=\r\n with a hash\nURI.  RDF is all about self-describing resources, RDFa embeds =\r\nthis\nmechanism into the hypertext control itself.\n\nThe benefit, of course, =\r\nis that the API hasn&#39;t been touched, from the\nh2m perspective.  Plus, there=\r\n&#39;s only one document to maintain, instead\nof resorting to media-type conneg=\r\n.  RDFa is enough of a juggernaut\nright now that it&#39;s OK to beware of the h=\r\nype cycle, and I&#39;m by no means\nan expert, but it looks to be the real deal =\r\nas far as solving a bulk of\nthe problems which come to this list.\n\nMy afore=\r\nmentioned toolchain validates to the DOCTYPE just fine, so\nadding RDFa into=\r\n the example was quick and painless.  Unless I screwed\nup, there are many p=\r\narsers to choose from which can extract the graph;\nor, I could use GRDDL to=\r\n transform the embedded RDFa into a standalone\nRDF document.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, any=\r\none can write an autonomous client that is tightly bound to\n&gt; your particul=\r\nar service.  Often that is good enough.  Rdfa may help in\n&gt; the future.  Ho=\r\nwever, i think it suffer too because the\n&gt; expectations/requirements of the=\r\n client are not surfaced explicitly in\n&gt; the request.\n&gt; \n\nPlease elaborate,=\r\n in terms of my updated example.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Having multiple representations and u=\r\nsing content negotiation can\n&gt; reduce the coupling and associated maintenan=\r\nce cost quite\n&gt; significantly.  It allows servers to continue to support ol=\r\nder\n&gt; autonomous clients, while continuing to evolve and provide significan=\r\nt\n&gt; new features.  It also allows autonomous clients to interact with more\n=\r\n&gt; than one implementation of a service by making the requirements and\n&gt; exp=\r\nectations explicit in a specification.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m a big fan of conneg, where i=\r\nt makes sense.  But the costs of both\ndevelopment and maintenance of both c=\r\nonneg and duplicate-purpose,\ndifferent-audience representations seem much h=\r\nigher than they do for a\npolyglot approach.  If the human-targeted self-doc=\r\numenting links and\nannotation text are removed in favor of a machine-target=\r\ned document, to\nsave bytes or why-ever, that machine-targeted document is h=\r\narder to\nmaintain and can&#39;t be debugged-by-browser.  So I hope RDFa does wo=\r\nrk\nout, I think this thread has exposed the limits of HTML without it.\n\n-Er=\r\nic\n\n"}}
