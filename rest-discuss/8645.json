When we receive an entity that&#39;s encoded we\n&gt;&gt;  neither know nor care if it was pre-encoded\n&gt; \n&gt; And yet clients make several assumptions about where that Etag\n&gt; assignment occurred. Just *how* it occurred is an implementation\n&gt; matter. I think the paper makes a different point than the one you&#39;re\n&gt; making.\n\n\nIt&#39;s more I think about it differently, in terms of &quot;what&quot; rather than \n&quot;where&quot;.\n\nThe only &quot;where&quot;s I think a client should think about is &quot;somewhere \nunder my control&quot;, &quot;somewhere on an intermeditary&quot; and &quot;somewhere on the \nserver&quot;. The first means within the client itself, so we aren&#39;t out onto \nthe web yet and aren&#39;t dealing in REST. The other two are distinguished \nby the (imperfect) mechanism for knowing which headers are hop-to-hop \nand which are end-to-end. Beyond that they&#39;re black-boxes and the E-Tags \ncould be magically appended by the E-Tag fairy for all the client knows.\n\nSo in terms of &quot;what&quot; we come back to E-Tags tag entities, not resources \n(which we already have URIs to tag).\n\nWhile this ammounts to much the same thing as saying &quot;where&quot; I think \nit&#39;s clearer because it&#39;s talking about the sort of objects that it&#39;s a \nclient&#39;s business to deal with.\n\nFurther, a server-side process of &quot;this is the E-Tag that will go with \nthis resource, because it will only ever have one representation&quot; or \n&quot;this is the E-Tag that will go with this resource, unless I do some \nsort of transformation on it in which case I need a different one \n(perhaps based on that first E-Tag - an E-Tag of &quot;1234&quot; for the \nunencoded and &quot;1234gz&quot; for the g-zipped is perfectly valid) are both \nperfectly okay - they have the &quot;where&quot; wrong by that way of looking at \nit, but they still get the &quot;what&quot; right, and have the same effect as if \nthe &quot;where&quot; was right.\n\n\n"}}
