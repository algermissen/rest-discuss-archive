I don&#39;t know if \n&gt; that makes any\n&gt; sense, but I hope the HTTP philosophy isn&#39;t the declarative/logical\n&gt; assertion approach, since 0.001% of programmers would get it.\n\nI think a few more than that would &quot;get it&quot;, but I understand\nyour point nonetheless.\n\nSometimes the programmer doesn&#39;t matter as much as the customer.\nOn my current project, we have an issue that&#39;s right on this\nsame point.  Our customer wants to &quot;update portfolios&quot;.  Up until\nnow we&#39;ve assumed, because the implementation details include\nthe storing of incremental transaction data for audit, that\nthe end-user is thinking this way too, but recent evidence seems\nto suggest that they always think &quot;declaratively&quot; about their\nportfolios.  An example, the broker is allowed to run one chart\nwindow, but branch management has decided that brokers would be\nhappier running the maximum product capability of four chart\nwindows.  Four is the target; four is the meaningful number in\nthe problem domain; &quot;plus 3&quot; is the language of the application.\nThe programmers and programing management likes &quot;plus 3&quot;; they\ndon&#39;t want to change...\n\nThere&#39;s a problem with &quot;plus 3&quot;; in order to get every broker&#39;s\nconfig up to four, we need to know in a time-sensitive manner\neach broker&#39;s current config.  This places a high burden on the\nfreshness of the caches.  If we order &quot;plus 3&quot; for a broker who\nwas participating in a prototype and already has four, we&#39;re\nmaking an illegal request.  We might spend extra bandwidth to\nrefresh caches of all affected accounts in order to stick with\nthis non-idempotent method of portfolio update; or we might go\nwith the natural format that matches the way portfolio coordinators\nand management think and use the declarative (idempotent) method\ninstead.\n\nBased on bandwidth constraints alone, a development management\nwho refused to listen to &quot;idempotent&quot; in the abstract must now\npay attention and entertain the necessity of this change.\n\nThat&#39;s what&#39;s been happening in our little world.  If programmers\ncan&#39;t keep up with that kind of thinking, their futures are a bit\ndark from where I sit.  It ain&#39;t rocket science either...\n\nPeace,\nWalden\n\n"}}
