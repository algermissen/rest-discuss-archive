It \ncould manage bookmarks in one central place.\n\n&gt; During the morning commute I came to more or less the same conclusion.\n&gt; In general there needs to be a listing of design issues with an example\n&gt; for each.  The stuff on the REST Wiki right now is too abstract.\n\nAs a very new comer to REST I am still having a hard time thinking about how \nit works with a real application from an implementation point of view.\n\n&gt; Design issue: resources not methods\n&gt; Example: SQL insert\n&gt;\n&gt; One way to do a SQL insert over the web is to wrap the SQL in HTTP syntax.\n&gt; For example,\n&gt; GET /doInsert?cols=id,val&vals=25,fooVal&table=myTable\n&gt;\n&gt; A REST way of doing this would\n&gt; * be strict about not using GET to change server state\n&gt; * have the back end target be a resource rather than a procedure\n&gt;\n&gt; New way:\n&gt; POST /tables/myTable?id=25&val=fooVal\n&gt;\n&gt; - Lucas\n\nSurely this would be very bad as anyone could insert whatever data they \nwanted into your database. Database access/manipulation IMHO is something \nthat should definately live behind a facade. I would generally prefer to not \neven expose dataaccess routines to the outside world but wrap those up in \nsomething that communicates what the data is doing. Without doing a REST \nexample, because I don&#39;t understand it yet.\n\nI would do something like employee.create, or update etc...This is commonly \ntermed as the CRUD approach. In REST would this be something like the \nfollowing?\n\nhttp://somehost.com/employee/create?id=12345\nhttp://somehost.com/employee/update?id=12345\n\nThen on the server side there would be a create, update method on the \nemployee that takes an id parameter?\n\n- -- \nSigned,\nHolden Glova\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org\n\niD8DBQE8vdlD+mF116Lw2cQRAsc4AJ4nsg8pRCE7YdYpTK8DQs8ve1x9jQCdEJFI\nLrLuNyMH2c/Z+MhKwJlI/m0=\n=/bI4\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
