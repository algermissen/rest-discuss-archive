I have looked at the thesis, and went through \n=\r\nthis newsgroup but am not completely satisfied at what client-\nstateless-se=\r\nrver really means.\n\nRepresentational State Transfer should have all the det=\r\nails in a \nrequest so that a server can handle the request (thus any server=\r\n in a \nfarm that has the service can process a request that started at \nano=\r\nther server--scalable).  Wouldn&#39;t this mean that any form of a \ndatabase th=\r\nat keeps state on the server and not the client, not be \nRESTful?\n\nAs an ex=\r\nample, it could be a shopping cart on Amazon.com.  Amazon.com \nstores the s=\r\ntate of the shopping cart on the server so that when a \ncustomer logs in, t=\r\nhey can see the items they have saved.  How is \nthis RESTful?  State is bei=\r\nng stored on the server, and any further \nrequest to the server had already=\r\n depended on the fact that the prior \nrequests setup the shopping cart to a=\r\ndd items, etc.  To be RESTful, I \nwould think that each request would carry=\r\n the list of items in the \nshopping cart.\n\nSo, if you look at a Session in =\r\na web application.  I see this as a \ndatabase.  It stores information on th=\r\ne server, although the session \nis meant to be only temporary--it may very =\r\nwell be persisted to a \nfile store for clustering.  This of course has been=\r\n argued before as \nnot being RESTful.  How would this be different from hav=\r\ning a \ndatabase storing all the information its clients have changed?  That=\r\n \ndatabase has to be shared among all servers which is not scalable.\n\nCan s=\r\nomeone please explain this to me?\n\n-David\n\n\n"}}
