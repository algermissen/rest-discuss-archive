Encapsulation is always a dicey\n&gt; proposition, because it can all too easily become tunneling.

This helps enable peer to peer between\ntwo firewalled nodes - with the assistance of a middleman.\n\nFor software behind a firewall, how would you suggest we maintain\nRESTfullness if we attempt client initiated messaging?\nEspecially if you want to maintain existing programming models.\n\n\n\n"}}
