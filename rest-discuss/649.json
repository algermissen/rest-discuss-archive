But for performance reasons we need to leave hooks into *this*\n&gt; project that will allow us to inline useful information later.\n\nIMO charter for the notifications design is partly to lay the groundwork for an\nupdate project to follow, which means in practice that anything that prevents\nlater update extensions has a high burden of proof.  EG We should avoid\nspecifying what&#39;s in the notification entity body, because that&#39;s the likely\nlocation of update data, but we should also not give a half-assed definition of\nwhat&#39;s in the update entity body, because that may make things harder on the\nupdate project.\n\n&gt; I guess that&#39;s our problem. I&#39;m thinking ahead to inline representations\n&gt; and re-subscribe in responses. In that case, the inline representation\n&gt; is the equivalent of a GET.\n\nYeah, and I think that&#39;s a good thing.\n\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s another (somewhat less efficient) idea: the response to a NOTIFY\n&gt; could return a Location: that says where to PUT the changed data.\n&gt; Because all of the connections go from publisher to subscriber, the same\n&gt; TCP connection could be used.\n&gt;\n&gt; I kind of like that becuase the notification could say: &quot;the document is\n&gt; 5MB. You may or may not want to fetch it unless you know you really need\n&gt; it.&quot;\n\nI like this idea, though I would wait on a dedicated project to work through all\nthe implications before committing to it.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; 3) Eventually the sink performs a request for the new state.  As part of the\n&gt; &gt; request the sink resubscribes.  (A combined operation will be hard\n&gt; to model in\n&gt; &gt; HTTP, but this message is not the place to articulate the problems.)\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s wrong with the header approach from WD-NOTIFY?\n\ndon&#39;t know it yet.  :)\n\nbusy workdays for me lately, sorry to be slack in keeping up with reading.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; A stock ticker isn&#39;t a usecase for idempotent notifications, FWIW.\n&gt; Timing is\n&gt; &gt; everything with a ticker, so it should use an update approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it is essentially impossible to guarantee latency on the public\n&gt; Internet anyhow. So I don&#39;t see a big difference between a notification\n&gt; model and an update model. Even without resource inlining, we&#39;re talking\n&gt; about an extra second or two. For all you know, the message is already\n&gt; five minutes late because of network congestion!\n\nSure!  And given that you can actually pick up all transient states (by\nsubscribing to a broad /resource/all_states resource instead of a child\n/resource/current_state resource) notifications should be able to provide quite\na lot of functionality.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do think that notifications should be efficient enough for interactive\n&gt; (but not hard-realtime) use.\n\nAgreed.\n\n\n"}}
