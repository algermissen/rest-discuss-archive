A 404/410 status indicates there are none.\n&gt;\n\nAn entity tag response header gives information about the entity enclosed \nwith the response to the request, whatever that response may be.  A 404 \nor 410 response does not mean there are no representations available \nfor the requested resource -- they _are_ representations of the requested \nresource, according to REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, it carries an entity. But no, the ETag header does not apply to the\n&gt;entity being returned, but to the entity available on the server.\n&gt;\n\nHuh?  The server just returned the entity available on the server.  A \n404 or a 410 response includes an entity, in response to a request for \nthe resource.  Perhaps they are representations of a &quot;null&quot; resource?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;ETag is not entity header field but a response header field, so the\n&gt;information above does not apply (see Section 6.2 vs 7.1).\n&gt;\n\nHuh?  An ETag is both an entity header field and a response header.  \nHow can an entity tag _not_ be a response header, when included with \na response to a request?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe I did now.\n&gt;\n\nSorry, no sale.  Maybe you can explain just what REST constraint is \nbroken by applying an ETag to a 410 response, or perhaps explain just \nwhat it is that can go wrong.  If there is some actual downside to \nthis, I would be more receptive of your arguments.  But if it doesn&#39;t \nmake any &quot;bad things&quot; happen, wouldn&#39;t that tend to support my argument?  \nI tend towards pragmatism, when I come up with something and it works as \nexpected, and I can&#39;t find any negative effects, I tend not to believe \nthat I&#39;ve broken any REST constraints or violated RFC 2616.\n\nWhen I implement something and &quot;bad things&quot; do happen, then I stop \nmyself and attempt to discern, through both RFC 2616 and REST, where it \nis I went wrong and why.  Like my first shot at the double-DELETE, I \ndiscovered problems through testing, which led me to identify the error \nI was making in both REST and RFC 2616 terms.  Now I&#39;ve fixed it, and \nbelieve it or not, putting an ETag on a 410 response doesn&#39;t cause the \nsky to fall.  ;-)  If there is some obscure, theoretical error \nremaining in the interaction that causes no ill effects then I question \nthe theory, not my working code.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
