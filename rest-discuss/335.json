You want every email message\n&gt; to be available via HTTP --until it is\n&gt; acknowledged or times out-- so you can POST\n&gt; replies to message URLs.  You want to check\n&gt; presence via HTTP.  all cool.\n\nRight!\n\n&gt; So the issue with RPC is that you are concerned\n&gt; that people will use it to hide query values.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; This makes sense when the value of the query may\n&gt; change or when the size of the value is larger\n&gt; than the size of the URL!\n\nDon&#39;t know what you mean by that.\n\n&gt; So MIME-RPC conventions are useful either way.  \n\nOf course. It all comes down to: &quot;MIME-RPC is the most important thing.&quot;\n;)\n\n&gt; ... I\n&gt; just need to add the following to the spec:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Would that work for everyone?\n\nWell I would deprecate the RPC conventions and change the name but other\nthan that...I guess its fine.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
