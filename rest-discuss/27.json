So and of course the same goes for the original originator\nnetwork AOL. So why worry about the caching of PUTs? The cache can just\nwait for the next GET.\n\n&gt; This is a really small advantage in a write-few/read-many environment.\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.\n\nThat&#39;s my point! If PUTs have a small advantage over POST then why\nshould we REST-ies spend our valuable moral capital fighting with FORMs\npeoples etc. over PUT. Well, I&#39;m mostly playing the devil&#39;s advocate\nbecause of course fighting for the Right Thing is its own reward. ;)\nSeriously though, I&#39;d rather have strong arguments in favour of PUT than\nthis one which seems quite weak to me.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
