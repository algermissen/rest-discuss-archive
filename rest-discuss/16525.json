If there&#39;s no intent to ever publish or register,\n&gt; then there&#39;s zero chance of meeting the self-descriptiveness constraint\n&gt; on the Web.  On an intranet, this simply doesn&#39;t matter.  On the Web,\n&gt; the advice Mark gives to Blinksale is absolutely vital to their goals.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is a tool for long-term planning by identifying and working to\n&gt; resolve mismatches.  It&#39;s one thing to use an identifier before it&#39;s\n&gt; standardized, if the system evolves towards REST without needing to be\n&gt; changed.  But it&#39;s another thing to use an opaque identifier which works\n&gt; against that evolution, since it will never be self-descriptive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t the real-world implications of this difference, on the deployed\n&gt; Web infrastructure, prove that this point of distinction between what&#39;s\n&gt; REST and what isn&#39;t, is both well-defined and vital, as opposed to\n&gt; opinion?  Calling it opinion is, to me, like calling it coincidental\n&gt; that Web architecture reflects Roy&#39;s personal preferences on the issue,\n&gt; as stated here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m certainly not going to call an intranet system unRESTful if it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have a registry, you guys are right, that doesn&#39;t do anyone any\n&gt; good.  But in the context of the Web, there is only one way to meet the\n&gt; self-descriptiveness constraint, so it can&#39;t be considered an esoteric\n&gt; or trivial distraction.\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, I&#39;ll shutup *soon*...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;    \n\nI also concur that the type should be standardized but couldn&#39;t it be \nstandardized between two parties who decide to use the web and don&#39;t \nwant to use https and don&#39;t use IANA (for whatever reasons).  Yes, \n&quot;reach&quot; is severely hampered but that&#39;s a design choice is it not?  The \nstyle allows for significant, but if I choose not to leverage it fully \nby not (for example) having GETable resources and hence limiting caching \nwould it not be REST?  Is every type registered on IANA understood by \nevery intermediary we have today?  I realize this is not the point, but \nreach is not obtained by just registering either (though it potentially \nsimplifies it).\n\nAnyway, I completely get what your saying and see merit to it.  I&#39;m just \nnot sold on such a strong stance.\n\n"}}
