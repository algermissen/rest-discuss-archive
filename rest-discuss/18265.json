includes the possi=\r\nbility of defining acoherent  set of\ndomain-specific decorators for an exis=\r\nting domain-agnostic media type\n(i.e. @id, @name, @class @rel for XHTML, et=\r\nc.).\n\nsecond, when i design my own media types i my work covers not just\nda=\r\nta details but also 1) workflow identifiers to successfully express\napplica=\r\ntion flow options within a message, and 2) in some cases new\nprotocol-level=\r\n affordances to offer &quot;better&quot; maps between\ndomain-specific actions and the=\r\n target protocol (HTTP).\n\nfinally, when i work on media type designs, my go=\r\nal is not to improve\none&#39;s ability to express selected &quot;objects&quot; (sales-ord=\r\ner, customer,\netc.) but, instead, the goal is to improve one&#39;s ability to e=\r\nxpress\nthe _entire_ problem domain (sales management, accounting, banking,\n=\r\netc.).\n\nthese are remarks based on my own explorations and recent experienc=\r\nes.\nYMMV and others may have verry different perspectives on how they\narchi=\r\ntect and implement solutions over HTTP with or without following\nFielding&#39;s=\r\n single example.\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/messa=\r\nge/18190\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://ma=\r\nmund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Dec 30, 2011 at 17:04, Jorn Wildt &lt;jw@fjel=\r\ndgruppen.dk&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jan, assuming I have followed a link with the rel-=\r\ntype &quot;at-this-url-you-will-find-a-sales-order&quot;. Are you saying that the ser=\r\nver could return *anything*, like for instance the representation of a car =\r\nor an address book? Or are you allowing the client to assume it is a sales =\r\norder - without any assumption of the actual format it is represented in?\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ha, Jorn! You are right on.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I would say, it is fair to argue=\r\n that:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) The client follows a link-rel &quot;this-is-the-sales-order&quot; and a=\r\nssumes it will get, well, a sales order - in some yet unknown format.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2=\r\n) The client does not need to specify &quot;I want a sales order&quot; in the accept =\r\nheaders (it does so by the URL it has selected).\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) The client should s=\r\npecify what general domain-independent format it expects using accept heade=\r\nrs. For instance &quot;Accept: application/xml&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) The server replies with =\r\na sales order formated as application/xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) The client looks into the=\r\n XML and switches on something relevant in the XML - for instance the root =\r\nnamespace.\n&gt;\n&gt; 6) Based on the XML decision in (5) the client decides how t=\r\no decode the XML-formated sales order.\n&gt;\n&gt; All in all there is no need for =\r\na domain specific media type like application/vnd.salesorder+xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; Combi=\r\nne this with statements like &quot;REST is software design on the scale of decad=\r\nes&quot; and &quot;Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficie=\r\nncy&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would say that domain specific media types are short term solut=\r\nions - a thing like the sales order varies on the market/geographical regio=\r\nn/politics and ... time, meaning it probably won&#39;t be stable over the decad=\r\nes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further more - it may feel like bending over and backwards not to u=\r\nse domain specific media types. But, well &quot;Many of the constraints are dire=\r\nctly opposed to short-term efficiency&quot;, so, yes, it hurts now, but you will=\r\n be a happy camper in ten years :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
