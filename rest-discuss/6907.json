Let me restate to see if I have it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Whatever the resource is (described by a noun), the entire resource must be\n&gt;returned by a GET, the entire resource must by POSTed during an add, and the\n&gt;entire resource must be provided via PUT for an update.\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s correct, the resource is described by a URI taken as a whole -- it&#39;s \nopaque because while /bighugefile.xml is a resource with its own URI, \n/bighugefile.xml/(etc.) is identifying an abstract resource which happens to \nbe a data fragment derived from another concrete (file) resource.\n\nBecause URIs are opaque, it is incorrect to assume that the XPATH URI has \nanything to do with /bighugefile.xml, but in this example I&#39;m adhering to \ngood practice and it&#39;s easy to describe what I&#39;m doing using uri-template \nand referring to XPATH to describe this service.\n\nI&#39;m also using hypermedia as the engine of application state, even if it&#39;s \njust a snippet of text/plain. \n\n&gt;\n&gt;It is not possible\n&gt;to GET/POST/PUT a partial/subset of a resource using the resource. If a\n&gt;partial or subset of a resource is needed then it is a resource itself and\n&gt;hence must have it&#39;s own URI.\n&gt;\n&gt;Is that correct?\n&gt;\n\nWe-eelll, you&#39;re not gonna like this, but it isn&#39;t that simple. There&#39;s such \na thing as HTTP range requests:\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16\n[2] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35\n\nDepending on the nature of the resource, particularly if it&#39;s a binary media \ntype instead of text, it may be preferable to use HTTP range requests in \nwhich case /bighugefile.bin never needs to be transferred to a client in its \nentirety, but may be manipulated remotely nonetheless.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
