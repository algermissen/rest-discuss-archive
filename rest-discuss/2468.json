Any *thing*, \nperiod, can have an identifier: &quot;with identity&quot; is completely redundant \nas you&#39;ve just agreed.\n\nThe RFC 2396 text is misleading, because it suggests that the potential \nresources are a *proper* subset of the set of things, the proper subset \nwhich has identity as opposed to the subset which doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s close \nto gibberish IMO.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
