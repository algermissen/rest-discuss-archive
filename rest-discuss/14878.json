Dublin\nCore is going in the right direction by standardizing things globally, but\nit is not global enough. Also I see interesting relations to semantic\nsolutions like RDF.\n\nBut in short term, I do not see such a global solution, so there might be a\nneed to live with &quot;small&quot; media types meanwhile.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-\n&gt; discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jan Algermissen\n&gt; Sent: Dienstag, 23. Februar 2010 18:40\n&gt; To: REST Discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Media Types: application/mydomain vs\n&gt; application/mydomain.doctypeA, application/mydomain.doctypeB,\n&gt; application/mydomain.doctypeC\n&gt; \n&gt; When designing media type(s) for a domain that includes a family of\n&gt; &quot;business document types&quot; (such as Atom does with feed and entry or\n&gt; such as UBL does with catalogue, order, invoice,...) what are the pros\n&gt; and cons of\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Defining one &#39;big&#39; media type encompassing all documents\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Defining many media types that correspond to the individual\n&gt; &quot;business document types&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I favor the &#39;one big media type&#39; ecause I like the type to\n&gt; in a sense identify the domain and to subsum all the processing rules\n&gt; involved. OTH, it causes real dispatching pains because you do not know\n&gt; what you have before you poke into the body.\n&gt; \n&gt; I usually address that with the use of a profile parameter in conneg,\n&gt; for example: Accept: application/mydomain;profile=doctypeA[1]. Servers\n&gt; the know the client&#39;s preferences and can send the doctypeA (without\n&gt; the need to put the profile parameter on the ContentType header (where\n&gt; it might get stripped my interediaries anyhow).\n&gt; \n&gt; However, frameworks seem to be bad at that kind of conneg at the\n&gt; moment, hence this posting :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts or insights?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] This works also well with client driven conneg, as in &lt;link href=&quot;&quot;\n&gt; rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;application/mydomain;profile=doctypeA&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
