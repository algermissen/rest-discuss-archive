If the  \n&gt; iPhone\n&gt; tries to access the more generic non-iPhone URL, they will be  \n&gt; precluded from\n&gt; getting in, not having a client cert.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Using SSL (eg. HTTPS), when the iPhone user hits the iPhone- \n&gt; specific URL,\n&gt; the server side will check for the existence of a user-specific  \n&gt; iPhone token,\n&gt; stored in a cookie.  The cookie will be set to only return to the  \n&gt; server&#39;s\n&gt; domain and to only be returned over an SSL connection, thus ensuring\n&gt; confidentiality/security of the &quot;token&quot;. If the max size of the  \n&gt; cookie is\n&gt; sufficient (4k), you could actually use a client cert as the &quot;token&quot;  \n&gt; stored\n&gt; in the cookie.  Size of the cookie might be an issue, since it would  \n&gt; be\n&gt; transmitted for all pages/accesses so that might be a consideration.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) If the user does not present this special cookie, they are denied\n&gt; access. If they do provide the cookie, then they still have to  \n&gt; perform the\n&gt; userid/pswd login, providing the 2nd factor login, again preventing  \n&gt; anyone\n&gt; that gets access to the iPhone device from logging in.  This could  \n&gt; be done in\n&gt; a single step of course, where the client sends the cookie plus the\n&gt; userid/pswd credentials in one transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) The crux of it is how does the cookie get in the iPhone Safari  \n&gt; browser in\n&gt; the first place? You set up a 3rd authentication HTTPS URL, using  \n&gt; the same\n&gt; domain name though,  on the server, that uses a different, one-time  \n&gt; assigned\n&gt; userid/pswd to log in.  When the user logs in, the special iPhone  \n&gt; cookie is\n&gt; set into their browser.  By making this special login a one-time  \n&gt; only, means\n&gt; that the only way a user gets the cookie is if an administrator sets  \n&gt; them up\n&gt; with a 1-time login to do this, and also presumes some sort of out  \n&gt; of band\n&gt; process to verify the identity of the user requesting the setup.   \n&gt; The cookie\n&gt; would be generated in the same domain and would be flagged as only  \n&gt; being\n&gt; allowed to be transmitted back to the originating server over an SSL\n&gt; connection (part of the cookie HTTP spec lets you do this, AFAIK).  \n&gt; In most\n&gt; cases, you could pre-load the cookie onto iPhones that were being  \n&gt; supplied\n&gt; before providing them to the user.\n&gt;\n&gt; If someone gets access to the physical device, then of course they  \n&gt; could get\n&gt; a copy of the cookie, but then they would still have to know the  \n&gt; userid/pswd,\n&gt; hence the desireability of the 2-factor approach.  But the same  \n&gt; would apply\n&gt; if you were using a device/browser that supports client-side certs.  \n&gt; If you\n&gt; can get access to that browser, then you can get the cert.  So it  \n&gt; seems to\n&gt; me, within these constraints, that the cookie-based approach  \n&gt; resembles the\n&gt; client-side cert approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Given that the application sticks to REST principles, the cookie  \n&gt; will not\n&gt; store any application state at any time.  It&#39;s only use is as an\n&gt; authentication token, which sounds like fair game to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping the RESTafarian community can provide some commentary on  \n&gt; whether\n&gt; this &quot;cookie over SSL&quot; approach is sufficiently secure to be  \n&gt; considered\n&gt; usable for 2-factor authentication?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any/all advice/observations/thoughts will be very much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrzej Jan Taramina\n&gt; Chaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\n&gt; http://www.chaeron.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
