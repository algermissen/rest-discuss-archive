In your case, OPTIONS will return just GET \n&gt; (from the four you mentioned)\n&gt;\n&gt; If a user-agent send a PUT, or POST, or DELETE to that URI the server \n&gt; will respond with 405 Method Not Allowed.\n&gt; That&#39;s it, the REST theorists will tell you that shouldn&#39;t happen \n&gt; because a REST application will have all those URI/Verbs being driven \n&gt; by Hipertext, meaning you don&#39;t know in advance the URI and/or the \n&gt; Verbs but you should only follow the links that the server send back \n&gt; to you.\n&gt;\n&gt; But in fact, sometimes things work in practice and not in theory, so \n&gt; there are situations where that can not happen, for example in the \n&gt; &quot;few well know URI&#39;s that are the entry point of a application&quot;, but \n&gt; there are more...\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, to be REST and not HTTP, where I said URI you should read \n&gt; Resource, where I said &quot;links&quot; you should read &quot;hipertext embedded in \n&gt; the representation of the resource that should drive the application \n&gt; state changes&quot; and I&#39;m sure that the good theorists in here will have \n&gt; a way of adding at least &quot;Media-Type&quot; or &quot;content-negotiation&quot; and \n&gt; other valuable concepts, but for me, that actually have to use these \n&gt; things in practice, I found much better to start from the bottom with \n&gt; simple things and try to go up from there...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ollie wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For some of the resources I&#39;m working with don&#39;t have a\n&gt; &gt; method&#92;operation that maps on to PUT, POST, DELETE if I&#39;m using HTTP\n&gt; &gt; as the transport.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Should the end user of the service have some way to find out the\n&gt; &gt; operations supported by a reosurce or should I just return the\n&gt; &gt; appropriate status code?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ollie\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jan Algermissen\n&gt; &gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ollie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sep 21, 2009, at 1:22 PM, Ollie wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Should I expose the operations a resources supports & If so how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should I expose the operations?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by &#39;operations&#39;?
