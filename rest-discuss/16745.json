Most of the protocols he worke=\r\nd on were end-to-end, and the connection could be established in either dir=\r\nection.\n\nThat Internet is long dead; NAT, HTTP, and RFC1918 killed it.  The=\r\n Web established a network that has big well-named servers that clients mus=\r\nt bow in supplication to connect to -- and anonymous clients that can&#39;t be =\r\nreached without them establishing and holding a connection of some sort.\n\nT=\r\nhere *are* legitimate applications for push. Not everything is request/resp=\r\nonse: P2P and publish/subscribe are legitimate communication patterns.  Tha=\r\nt&#39;s not to say they&#39;re REST, but if &quot;it&#39;s the architecture, stupid&quot;, you do=\r\n have to look at the application communication pattern and find a way to de=\r\nal with it.\n\nHTTP, essentially the only important protocol in the context o=\r\nf the current Internet, makes it vey hard to do a good job on P2P or pub/su=\r\nb.  Roy&#39;s postings about the economics of scale of these communication patt=\r\nerns are sensible (though Facebook seems to have been able to monetize pub/=\r\nsub pretty well), but people are going to need to implement them.\n\nNow, thi=\r\ns isn&#39;t to defend websockets -- but to say that if you&#39;re going to accept a=\r\n non-addressable Internet, people will need to invent things like it.\n\nAt K=\r\nnowNow (thanks to Rohit Khare and Adam Rifkin), we built a tiny web server =\r\nin Javascript.  The implementation of resource handlers were (roughly) Java=\r\nscript functions; the dominant media type was form/x-www-urlencoded.  As we=\r\n got better at writing this server, it got more RESTful.  But the connectio=\r\nn itself was always a tunnel; there was no alternative.  Whether we impleme=\r\nnted that with long-poll or just a big GET with function callbacks, it was =\r\ncertainly more RESTful than the websocket approach -- but it&#39;s not like som=\r\nebody could easily add an HTTP security system on those tunnels.\n\nI&#39;m perfe=\r\nctly willing to admit that systems that use P2P or publish/subscribe commun=\r\nication patterns aren&#39;t REST, but it&#39;s not like anybody out there is genera=\r\nlly opening their networks to XMPP, BEEP, AMQP....  Nor are they providing =\r\nmechanisms (well, other than email addresses, hi, Mr. Spam) for addressing =\r\nreal endpoints so you don&#39;t have to hold request/response HTTP connections =\r\nopen in order to implement them.\n\nThe 304 Idle idea is kind of cool, too; t=\r\nhanks for getting me thinking in that direction.\n\n\n\n"}}
