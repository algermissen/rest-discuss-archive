I think it&#39;s hard for us to be prescriptive about\n&gt; this. An XSLT processor designed solely for use on TV set-top-boxes might\n&gt; have no market requirement (or technical possibility) to write output to an\n&gt; HTTP PUT destination, nor indeed to anywhere other than the TV screen. We\n&gt; want language interoperability, but we can&#39;t assume that all processors\n&gt; execute in the same kind of environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t mind, however, putting in some kind of note giving examples of the\n&gt; sorts of URI that permit writing.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I would be very happy with a non-normative note\nthat would get across the point (in appropriate spec-ese) that HTTP is\nin fact a bidirectional protocol and that it would make just as much\nsense to PUT to an HTTP URI as to a file system path. If at all\npossible, please use the word &quot;PUT&quot; (if even in a non-normative example)\nso that we have a chance of interoperability among implementations.\n(there will be a tempation to use the more popular &quot;POST&quot; even though it\ndoes not have the same &quot;overwrite file&quot; semantic).\n\nSomething like:\n\n&quot;For example writing to a file://... URI would overwrite a file. Writing\nto an http://... URI would invoke the HTTP PUT method.&quot;\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
