The message that opens the thread is “[uf-discuss] \n&quot;Casual Web Services&quot; and Well Designed Urls” \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-October/006341.html&gt;). \n\n\nI am, in this message, replying to Mike Schinkel’s “[uf-discuss] &quot;Casual \nWeb Services&quot; and Well Designed Urls[uf-rest]” \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000300.html&gt;):\n\n&gt; Etan Wexler wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The structure of URLs is not important knowledge for any API for\n&gt;&gt; applications of REST. In fact, the structure of URLs is totally irrelevant\n&gt;&gt; to any such API.\n&gt; \n&gt; [...] Can you please provide justification?\n\nI gave the justification, albeit briefly, in a previous message \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000292.html&gt;):\n\n‘REST does not permit programmatic construction of URIs in which the \nconstruction uses of out-of-band knowledge and bits of data. Read \nsections 5.1.5 (“Uniform Interface”, \n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5&gt;) \n\nand 5.2.1 (“Data Elements”, \n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1&gt;) \nof “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software \nArchitectures”. Particularly, REST relies on hypermedia as the engine of \napplication state, while constructing URIs violates this constraint.’\n\nMike, you responded, “After reading your email and those sections of\nRoy&#39;s paper I have absolutely no idea what you were trying to \ncommunicate to me. Roy&#39;s paper is written in such abstract language that \nI am unable to see the issues you bring up.” \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000293.html&gt;)\n\nI then stated my position \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000296.html&gt;), \nfor which you requested justification. Here we find ourselves.\n\nIn the meantime, I clarified “constructing URIs” as meaning “a computer \nprogram’s construction of URIs, as opposed to a human’s construction of \nURIs” \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000297.html&gt;). \n\n\nI clarified my definition of “out-of-band knowledge” \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000299.html&gt;).\n\n&gt; [After you sent] your email someone else emailed contradicting you and he gave\n&gt; copious references to support his point.\n\nYes, Nick Gall contradicted me \n(&lt;http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-October/000294.html&gt;). \n   His references are to non-authoritative materials that do not \ncontradict me.\n\n&gt; So if your justification is [Tim Berners-Lee] saying that URLs need be\n&gt; be opaque, I can provide links [...]\n\nMy justification has nothing to do with the statements of Tim Berners-Lee.\n\n&gt;&gt; When a program implements an API for an application of REST, the program\n&gt;&gt; relies on the presence of links in content. And when the program sifts \n&gt;&gt; content to discover links (rather than constructing URIs according to \n&gt;&gt; explanations)...\n&gt; \n&gt; That is not necessarily true. It can be one valid use-case but is not all\n&gt; valid use-cases.\n\nWhat do you make of the following two passages?\n\n“Hypermedia is defined by the presence of application control \ninformation embedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation of \ninformation.” \n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/web_arch_domain.htm#sec_4_1_3&gt;)\n\n“REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of \nresources; manipulation of resources through representations; \nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application \nstate.” \n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5&gt;)\n\n&gt; The structure of the links are [relevant in] other use-cases.\n\nI presume that “links” here means URLs or some other resource identifiers.\n\n&gt; Take a look at the NING REST API [...]; it does exactly what I&#39;m\n&gt; describing (and I can give other examples which I will be doing on the\n&gt; blog):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://documentation.ning.com/sections/rest.php\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s Eventful&#39;s EVDB api:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://api.evdb.com/docs\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s del.icio.us:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://del.icio.us/help/api/posts\n\nI read through the documentation that you cited. The subjects of the \ndocumentation (that is, the software systems and their APIs) break from \nREST in various ways. If these systems, their APIs, or their \ndocumentation do exactly what youre describing, then you’re describing \nsomething that does not fit within REST.\n\nThe key issue is that none of the cited materials are authoritative.\n\n-- \n\n\n\n"}}
