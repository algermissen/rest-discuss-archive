The\n&gt; REST design patterns have been employed on the Web for 20 years.\n\nAt most, depending how you chose to measure it, the Web has been\naround for 15 years.  AIUI, REST - or whatever name Roy had in his\nhead for the style at the time - has only been around for about 12\nyears.\n\n&gt; Issue 2: A SOAP header enables expression of Quality of Service (QoS).\n[snip]\n&gt; \n&gt; Issue 3: A SOAP header enables expression of security.\n[snip]\n&gt;\n&gt; Issue 4: Embedding security in SOAP enables passing around the security\n&gt; information, thereby facilitating single sign-on.\n[snip]\n\nFor those, I&#39;d simply say &quot;Ditto for HTTP headers&quot;.\n\n&gt; Issue 5: SOAP can be wrapped in different wrappers (HTTP, SMTP, etc). So, if\n&gt; one wrapper is unsuitable then simply wrap the SOAP in a more suitable\n&gt; wrapper. REST always requires wrapping in HTTP. Thus, you are forever stuck\n&gt; with the limitations of HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is simply false. HTTP itself can be wrapped in any number of different\n&gt; wrappers. Example, we could wrap HTTP (a synchronous protocol) within an\n&gt; SMTP wrapper and thus has an asynchronous protocol.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t go there, since you&#39;re talking about tunneling.  Instead I&#39;d\npoint out that REST doesn&#39;t require the use of HTTP, it just requires\n- from this POV - that the interface semantics be uniform.  So, for\nexample, sending an email message with SMTP is RESTful (except for the\nstateful SMTP preamble of HELO, RCPT FROM, MAIL TO exchanges).\n\n&gt; 2.\tREST has a proven track record. Contrast with SOAP which is yet to\n&gt; be proven. \n\nYou might also want to point out that SOAP can be used RESTfully; just\nshove in a document and headers; just don&#39;t include a\nmethod/operation/verb in there anywhere.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
