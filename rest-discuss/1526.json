I \nhaven&#39;t done it for a while, and didn&#39;t pay any attention when I did.\n\nThe context was purchasing, where somebody wrote that purchasing was \nan action, and the URI should contain a verb.  \n\nMy response was that you seldom actually purchase something on the \nWeb, in the sense that you purchase something from a store, where you \ntake the goods and hand them the money or swipe your credit card.  \nInstead you document your commitment to pay if they send you the \ngoods, and then later they document that they shipped the goods, etc.\n\nThe exception was where you downloaded some bits.\n\nThe URI often says /download, which I interpret as a verb.\n\nIf memory serves my right, if you&#39;re buying the stuff, there is \nusually a POST where you authorize payment from your credit card, and \nthen they give you permission for the actual download resource.\n\nAt that point, I know that HTTP says use GET, but I have no idea what \nWeb sites actually use.  There might also be a state change where \nthey record the fact that you downloaded the stuff.\n\n\n\n"}}
