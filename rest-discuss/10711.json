Let&#39;s see if I hit a sweet spot\n&gt; or if I&#39;m just missing something (more likely, please forgive me).\n&gt;\n&gt; I have several images, each with its own uri that have metadata.\n&gt; If I want to update the metadata of a given image I send a POST\n&gt; request on its uri. Right?\n&gt; What if I want to atomically update some metadata (say, a tag) for a\n&gt; group of images, how do I approach that?\n&gt; Sending multiple POST requests, one for each uri, is not atomic, so I\n&gt; can&#39;t accept it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought about posting on the common parent of all the image uris\n&gt; (say, if I have /images/1, /images/2, etc., then I post on /images).\n&gt; In the parameters of the post request I would put a list of all the\n&gt; imaged ids (or entire uri), so that the server can handle the request\n&gt; atomically.\n&gt;\n&gt; But then what should I get in return? What should /images return if I\n&gt; issued a GET? The whole repository? Naaa... too big.\n&gt; Isn&#39;t the POST supposed to return the same representation? Just after\n&gt; handling the posted request.\n&gt;\n&gt; How much am I missing from the rest picture?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Stefano\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
