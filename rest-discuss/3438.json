In many application\n&gt;domains, it is completely reasonable to generate a\n&gt;different URL in each announcment email.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhile I&#39;m sure there are possibilities that I&#39;ve not thought of, I&#39;m \nhaving difficulty imagining a scenario where that is a reasonable \nsolution.  \n\nThe way I see it, having a URL per user has several disdvantages:\n1. exponential explosion of URIs - one URL per resource per user - makes \ncontent management much harder than it needs to be\n2. can&#39;t share URIs between authorized users since everyone has their \nown personal URI for a resource\n3. kills caching since every unique user will use a different name for \nthe same resource\n4. provides no real security since all you need is a URI in order to \naccess a supposedly protected resource\n\nI&#39;m sure others can add to this list.  \n\nAnd for all that, I really can&#39;t think of any advantages.\n\n&gt;Alternatively:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;You POST credentials to a login resource and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;receive a redirect to the restricted URL.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But how do I relate that login resource to the resources that are protected?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You have a login resource per protected resource\n&gt;or resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;One REST pattern is that applications should\n&gt;expose a single root URL from which you navigate\n&gt;to the others.  So the redirect should probably be\n&gt;to this root.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure I understand the connection between navigation from a root \nURL and REST.  I wasn&#39;t aware that REST said anything about how to \norganize your resources.\n\nActually, I&#39;m not really sure I understand what you&#39;re proposing.  You \nseem to be suggesting that any time I want to access an arbitraty \nresource, I must navigate my way there from the root of something.  This \nseems to break so many of the principles of REST that I&#39;m sure I \nmisunderstand what you&#39;re suggesting.  Can you give an example of how \nthis might work?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
