One is about building networked systems that cross\norganizational boundaries and integrate well with other systems. The\nother is about building individual programs so that they are robust and\nextensible.\n\nAlso: I&#39;ve never seen a deployed SOAP web service that was even remotely\n&quot;object oriented&quot; so even if that adjective applied, we&#39;d have to\ncompare REST to CORBA or DCOM, not SOAP.\n\nAnd functional? I&#39;m trying hard to imagine how you&#39;d make a &quot;functional&quot;\nweb service without making it useless!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
