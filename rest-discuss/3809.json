My personal \nview is that ReST is sufficiently semantically incoherent so you can go in \nwhatever direction you like.  Try reading Roy&#39;s dissertation and figuring \nout the exact meaning of resource and representation in his paper and \nyou&#39;ll see what I mean.\n\n\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
