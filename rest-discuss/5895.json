However I don&#39;t buy the metadata argument. What at&#39;s the end of \n&gt; the URI is a resource, not a file. Resources are known only be their \n&gt; representations. If those representations are stored in a file system, \n&gt; fine; but they may be stored other ways.\n\nWell, that&#39;s not true for WebDAV. WebDAV supports meta data (properties) \non HTTP resources, and *usually* this data is not part of the \nrepresentation.\n\n&gt; The client operating through PUT or DELETE or MOVE has no reason to know \n&gt; or care about any metadata that never appears in the representation. If \n&gt; the metadata is somehow visible then it needs to be encoded in the \n&gt; method body or HTTP headers that the client PUTs to the server. \n&gt; Otherwise it&#39;s irrelevant like any other form of server state.\n\nI really have trouble following this line of argument.\n\nPeople *are* organizing resources in hierarchies, and they *do* assign \nmeta data (properties) to these resources. That use case surely does not \napply to each and every web resource, but it does exist, and WebDAV \nmakes it possible to do it through HTTP.\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
