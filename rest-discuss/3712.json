Any\n&gt; information that can be named can be a resource: ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Using an ACL means that the information cannot be named using a\n&gt; URI (assuming you do not wish to abdicate your entire user\n&gt; account).\n\nThe URI identifies the resource, not the information that is\nsent in response to a GET on that resource.  As such, I don&#39;t\nunderstand what you mean by abdicating the user account.\n\n&gt;  Therefore, this information is not a resource.\n\nIt isn&#39;t.  The mapping defined by the origin server is the resource.\nA server can and will take into account the entire request when\ndetermining which representation should be sent in response to\na request, just as it does so for determining whether the response\nshould be 200 or 401.\n\n&gt; Therefore, the application is not RESTful. Conclusion: ACLs are\n&gt; not RESTful.\n\nThat is a bizarre conclusion.  If that were the case, I would have put\na section in the dissertation explaining why one of the central features\nof HTTP isn&#39;t modeled by REST.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
