Up to\n&gt;&gt; a point you can get by with dot notation in form key names, but\n&gt;&gt; your structural options are limited and it gets ugly quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is one thing I&#39;m wondering about - the tradeoff between domain\n&gt; specific posting protocols and a generic carries-anything one like\n&gt; AtomPub. It seems in the read (non-posting), case, a preference towards\n&gt; something domain specific has worked very well for OpenSearch.\n\nIf it already exists and is widely used, why not extract it?\n\nI think it would be closer to microformats: looking at common use\ncases that are already out there, extracting from them, and creating\nsomething that a lot of existing implementations can use with little\nmodification.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In particular this - I&#39;d like to have a way to update an individual\n&gt; datum. A &quot;forms POST&quot; seems like a reasonable option for updates, given\n&gt; &#39;PUT everything back&#39; places pressure on clients to have everything to\n&gt; PUT back, and the various patch/delta/diff options that get suggested\n&gt; from time to time are (imo) very complicated.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if we go back to the the client controlled fields from early revs of\n&gt; atompub, it seems they are the common case and could be updated via\n&gt; application/x-www-url-encoded against the entry/mle using POST, which\n&gt; gives a clean split from PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
