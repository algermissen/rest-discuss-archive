Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a\n&gt;&gt; link. Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by\n&gt;&gt; itself, but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Linking to a procedure call, doesn&#39;t make that procedure call a REST\n&gt; resource.  What happens if you GET /cancelled?\n\n/orders/{id}/cancelled is a thing.  It is a state.  It either exists or \ndoesn&#39;t exist.  So, if you do a GET and the state exists:\n\nHTTP/1.1 204, No Content\n\nor even\n\nHTTP/1.1 405, Method Not Allowed\nAllow: PUT, DELETE\n\nIf it doesn&#39;t exist:\n\nHTTP/1.1 404, Not Found\n\nor even\n\nHTTP/1.1 410, Gone\n\n&gt;  What is it a\n&gt; representation of?  The resource?  Or some action, i.e. remote\n&gt; procedure?  If you aren&#39;t transferring representations of resources in\n&gt; order to change their state, then you aren&#39;t using REST.\n&gt; \n\nSo you&#39;re saying a thing can&#39;t merely exist?  It needs to have a \nrepresentation?  I don&#39;t think so.\n\nI think I&#39;ve just convinced my self that even without the &lt;link&gt; this is \npretty restful.\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
