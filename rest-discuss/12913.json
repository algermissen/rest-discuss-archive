A browser for example has quite some automatic  \nbehaviour that results from implementing the processing model of HTML  \n(load images, load stylesheets, execute JavaScript, do page reloads  \nbased on &lt;meta&gt; tags, etc.) All that changes for the non-human case is  \nthat media types would specify richer application semantics (because  \nthere is no user involved to decide what this or that link means).\n\nIf there is no human to understand &lt;a href=&quot;/all-versions&quot;&gt;Click me to  \nsee all versions&lt;/a&gt; then all you need is to standardize something  \nlike &lt;link rel=&quot;http://example.com/linkreks/all-versions&quot; href=&quot;/all- \nversions&quot;&gt;.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
