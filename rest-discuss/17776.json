Essentially this means to n=\r\negotiate incompatible media types based on Accept and the compatible variat=\r\nions in a given media type based on UserAgent. This might include the addit=\r\nion of certain Link headers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with the &quot;Avoid avoid&quot; here.  It =\r\nsounds a lot like out-of-band knowledge, and in the opposite direction than=\r\n is usual.  &quot;I know that V3.1.3 of FooClient doesn&#39;t use the xyzzy link rel=\r\nation, so I&#39;ll just save bandwidth by not sending it&quot;.  The server could en=\r\nd up with a large amount of knowledge.  See wurfl for an example of this go=\r\ning bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not stick to Accept (which is that it&#39;s for) and use medi=\r\na type parameters?\n&gt; \n&gt; Accept: application/procurement;hypermediacontrols=\r\n=3Dnew;q=3D1, application/procurement;hypermediacontrols=3Dold;q=3D0.3\n\nBee=\r\nn there, done that :-) Too enteprisey for my taste. Leads to packaging up f=\r\neature sets into version numbers. I&#39;d always let the Accept express the gen=\r\neral capability of the client. (Which I read as: &quot;If you hand me applicatio=\r\nn/atom I am pretty sure I can fulfill my user&#39;s intent from there&quot;) Version=\r\ning makes the whole elegance go away :-)\n\nI was thinking more in terms of &#39;=\r\nhints&#39; or &#39;best effort&#39;. Sending mobile devices different content (incl. bu=\r\n way of a redirect) seems ok. So why not &quot;direct that old legacy product we=\r\n sold 5 years ago to that old (set of) servers we keep around for these cas=\r\nes&quot;?\n\nMy original issue, BTW, was routing requests in a load balancer to di=\r\nrect clients that need a new feature to those services that have the new fe=\r\nature installed and are already up and running. In general: situations wher=\r\ne you have scaled to N services behind one IP that run different versions o=\r\nf a service (e.g. because they are being upgraded one by one while keeping =\r\nthe site in operation).\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; are obviously bad choice=\r\ns, but you get the idea.  That way the media type can express the different=\r\n &quot;variants&quot; within compatibility, and clients can express their capabilitie=\r\ns in a header designed for conneg.
