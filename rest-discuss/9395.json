You&#39;re applying a file-system paradigm to an HTTP server.\n&gt;You&#39;re starting off with a category error, since HTTP servers aren&#39;t\n&gt;file systems.\n&gt;\n\nI suggested a thoroughly simple mechanism, others have insisted that it \nbe compared to a trashcan, I have used that metaphor to help clarify my \nposition, now you are accusing me of trying to apply that metaphor to \nHTTP, which was never my intent in the first place.\n\nLet me try my comparison again.  Most computer users are familiar with \nthe metaphor of deleting a file twice.  The fact that the filesystem \ndoesn&#39;t actually delete the file until it&#39;s deleted from trash, means \nnothing to the user because, from *the user perspective* the file is \ndeleted twice.  The first delete isn&#39;t called &quot;move to trash&quot; it&#39;s called \n&quot;delete&quot;.\n\nI wish nobody had ever mentioned trashcans.  That had nothing to do \nwith my original post, only the arguments made against it.  Now you&#39;re \nattacking my response to those arguments as proof that I&#39;m \ncategorically wrong?  Please, if you&#39;re going to argue against what \nI am doing, then focus on what&#39;s wrong with what I&#39;m doing, not why \nyou don&#39;t like my rebuttal to the arguments of others trying to frame \nthis debate as &quot;like a trashcan&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;DELETE deletes. I think it&#39;s made perfectly clear that DELETE deletes in\n&gt;RFC 2616. When you have deleted a resource, it is deleted.\n&gt;\n\nWhere have I broken this constraint?  When a DELETE is made to an URL, \nthe status changes to 410 Gone.  From the perspective of the client, the \nDELETE succeeded, right?  How is this an example of DELETE not deleting?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;DELETE /parrot HTTP/1.1 does not move the parrot to /pining/parrot\n&gt;\n\nExactly the argument I have been striving to make.  Are you sure you \nreplied to the right person, here?  I have quite strenuously objected \nto using DELETE to move a file, or changing the URL to indicate a \n&quot;deleted&quot; state for the resource.\n\nSo what is your point, Jon?  I have a resource, I DELETE a resource, \nthat resource then responds 410 Gone... what am I doing wrong, \nexactly?  Where does RFC 2616 say I must actually delete the source?\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
