Is there any of these \noptions, including RFC 6596, to be preferred from an interoperability \npoint of view, talking about various software systems accessing these \nresources, including browsers? I.e. it seems people are pretty much \nreluctant to using / implementing OPTIONS, for whichever reasons.\n\nTIA and all the best,\nKristian\n\n\n"}}
