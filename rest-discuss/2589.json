I\nthink it&#39;s perfectly valid to use POST to create a resource.  I think it&#39;s\nperfectly valid to treat 404 as &quot;this is not a valid URI.&quot;  I think it&#39;s\nperfectly valid to use PUT to update a resource using a valid URI (one that\nalready has a mapping to the resource being updated).  I just don&#39;t think\nthat PUT is consistent with the way the rest of the verbs work when one is\nattempting to create a mapping with it.  That&#39;s all.\n\nOh, and taking the view I expressed in the prior post also allows URIs to be\nthought of more simply (at least for me).\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
