I&#39;m affraid my attention was actually on wallance and grommit&#39;s wrong trousers.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks for the clarification -- those pesky trousers!  :-)\n\n&gt;&gt;&lt;Elias&gt; This has been, to some extent, a personal crusade of mine -- to get people to realize that REST is more than GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. [...] &lt;/Elias&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&lt;Nic&gt; I strongly disagree that this is the case. I don&#39;t believe WEBDAV methods are necessary or even advisable for REST based apps. &lt;/Nic&gt;\n&gt;\nAh, the slings and arrows, fantastic!  :-)  So, you are certainly \nentitled to your opinion, and others theirs. I&#39;m well aware that \ncrusades can be difficult... Let&#39;s take a closer look at this issue \ntogether then.\n\nFirst, I&#39;ll note that there is no mention in Fieldings&#39; dissertation of \nwhich specific methods are necessary, sufficient or even desireable for \na REST application to support. There is, however, the constraint that \nREST resources support a uniform interface. HTTP simply happens to be \n/an implementation/, albeit the most widely deployed and, some would \nargue, the best available.  ;-)  REST is no more defined by GET, PUT, \nPOST and DELETE than it is by the FOO, BAR, BAZ and BLAH methods of some \nother implementation. To take your position to the extreme, someone may \njust as well state that REST is solely defined by GET and POST...\n\nIMHO, necessity has very little to do with the issue, otherwise one may \njust as well tunnel all of your application semantics through POST and \nbe done with it. (Oh, wait, that&#39;s SOAP over HTTP!) It is not the \n/necessity/ of DELETE, for example, that makes it a good idea, it&#39;s \nsimply that if everyone implemented their own DELETE via POST we would \nsoon find ourselves back in fragmented API land. Clearly, the same can \nbe said of PUT (and some do). Similarly, metadata properties associated \nwith a resource may be set and read via POST, resources could be moved \nand copied about via POST and so on. The fact remains, however, that \nthere are standardized protocol methods that have been defined for these \ncommon operations. Further, these methods have been defined within the \nHTTP framework as extensions to HTTP itself -- they are intended to play \nnicely together.\n\nIn designing RESTful applications, I believe that one must remain \ncognizant of the implications associated with how application behaviors \nare realized through HTTP. Sure, you can tunnel anything you want \nthrough POST, even things that have been defined as other methods, but I \nthink it undermines the &#39;interface genericity&#39; constraint somewhat as \nyou are no longer interacting with the resource you want to, e.g., \ndelete or move, but an arbiter who then does the delete or move for you.\n\nIt is unclear to me why someone would advocate the use of DELETE (over \nPOST as DELETE) but caution against the use of MOVE and am curious as to \nyour statement regarding the advisability of using WebDAV (or other?) \nmethods for REST applications. Could you elaborate more on this point? I \nwon&#39;t discount the constraints that may be imposed by a given business, \neconomic or political reality, but am for more interested in discussing \nthe architectural and systems engineering constraints.\n\n\nThanks,\nElias\n\n"}}
