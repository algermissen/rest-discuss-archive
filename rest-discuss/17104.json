However, it does indicate that the selection can\nbe done autom=\r\natically or &quot;manually by the user selecting from a\ngenerated (possibly hype=\r\nrtext) menu.&quot;[1]\n\nThis leads to an assumption that a set of hypertext links=\r\n (e.g. HTML\nanchor tags) would work just fine for human consumption:\n&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Pie char&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Data Table&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;Text =\r\nList&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSince the HTML A tag has &quot;type&quot; as an optional &quot;typoe&quot; attribute[=\r\n2],\nthe same content can be modified to help client applications make\nautom=\r\nated choices.\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot; type=3D&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;Pie char&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;..=\r\n.&quot; type=3D&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;Data Table&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot; type=3D&quot;text/plain&quot;&gt;Te=\r\nxt List&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinally, since the HTTP 1.1 spec also indicates the informatio=\r\nn could\nbe carried in a header, the new Web Linking spec[3] could be used a=\r\ns a\nguide for returning the same information as Link Headers:\nLink: &lt;...&gt;; =\r\ntype=3D&quot;image/png&quot;,&lt;...&gt;;type=3D&quot;text/html&quot;,&lt;...&gt;;type=3D&quot;text/plain&quot;\n\nThis=\r\n last option works well for clients that are not expecting an HTML\nresponse=\r\n body (e.g. image viewers that want to negotiate for a\npreferred binary for=\r\nmat, etc.).\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html#sec=\r\n12.2\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.2\n[3] http://too=\r\nls.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-5\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://tw=\r\nitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest=\r\n-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 13, 2010 at 06:44, Alejandro Nicolas &lt;=\r\nanicola@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I apologise beforehand, as I do not kno=\r\nw if this has been already\n&gt; asked and answered or even if it makes sense a=\r\nt all, but looking at\n&gt; HTTP 1.1 spec for Agent-driven negotiation\n&gt; (http:=\r\n//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-12.2) I am unsure if I am\n&gt; interpret=\r\ning the following sentence right:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Selection is based on a list of the =\r\navailable representations of the\n&gt; response included within the header fiel=\r\nds or entity-body of the\n&gt; initial response, with each representation ident=\r\nified by its own URI.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What I interpret by its reading is that by de-re=\r\nferencing the URI\n&gt; under which Agent-driven negotiation is done, you may b=\r\ne provided with\n&gt; an entity-body containing a list of URIs mapped one-to-on=\r\ne to each of\n&gt; the different representations mapped under the original URI.=\r\n I\n&gt; understand the only way to do so is by adding the media-type somehow\n&gt;=\r\n to the URIs, as in:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://server/myresource.xml\n&gt; http://server/myres=\r\nource.html\n&gt; http://server/myresource?format=3Djson\n&gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, if =\r\nwe define a Resource as a non-typed conceptual mapping to\n&gt; a named informa=\r\ntion (as per Roy Fielding&#39;s definition\n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/p=\r\nubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1,\n&gt; further clarified in hi=\r\ns post\n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-dri=\r\nven),\n&gt; should not the different available representations be identified us=\r\ning\n&gt; the same URI? Is it not incorrect to &quot;name&quot; differently the original\n=\r\n&gt; concept the client was looking for under different URIs just because\n&gt; di=\r\nfferent representations are available? Is it not more appropriate to\n&gt; use =\r\nserver-driven negotiation after the specific agent-driven\n&gt; negotiation sta=\r\nge has been done? =A0For instance, once the user agent\n&gt; receives the list =\r\nof available/acceptable representations by means of\n&gt; the agent-driven nego=\r\ntiation, it selects one of them by issuing a new\n&gt; request under the same U=\r\nRI, setting the Accept header only with the\n&gt; desired media-type, already k=\r\nnown to be accepted by the origin server.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really glad to hear y=\r\nour comments in order to get a better\n&gt; understanding of the spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Alejandro Nicolas Mascarell\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
