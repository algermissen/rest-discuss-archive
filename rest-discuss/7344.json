The connectors present an abstract interface\nfor component communication, enhancing simplicity by\nproviding a clean separation of concerns and hiding the\nunderlying implementation of resources and communication\nmechanisms. The generality of the interface also enables\nsubstitutability: if the users&#39; only access to the system is via\nan abstract interface, the implementation can be replaced\nwithout impacting the users. Since a connector manages\nnetwork communication for a component, information can\nbe shared across multiple interactions in order to improve\nefficiency and responsiveness.\n======\n\nMy view is that the &#39;generality of the interface&#39; is decreased when\nadditional verbs are used. \nAnother concern is that if there are several different approaches for any\ngiven task, an application has to deal with each of the approaches and this\ncan be costly. If a particular verb could be re-phrased in terms of other\nverbs, then those other verbs are more &#39;primitive&#39;. With only a few\n&#39;primitive&#39; ways of doing many things there is less need to adapt to many\ndifferent approaches - a cheaper way to conduct business.\nFor example, it&#39;s hard to argue that DELETE could be rephrased as GET and\nvice-versa. It&#39;s easier to argue that PATCH could be rephrased as a PUT or\nPOST to a related &#39;metadata&#39; resource. \nIn addition, with too few operations there is less visibility on the meaning\nand purpose of an operation which could result in a loss of efficiency or\nother undesired characteristics. For example, using POST to delete\nrepresentations rather than DELETE may work, but you lose the predictable\nrepeatability of DELETE (you can resubmit a DELETE in the face of network\nissues, but it&#39;s a bad idea to resubmit a POST unless you have\ncustom/external information indicating that it&#39;s okay - in which case, it&#39;s\njust like a DELETE only misspelled).\n\n\n\n"}}
