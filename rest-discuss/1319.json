A\n&gt; &gt; client then will create a PO instance document which conforms to\n&gt; &gt; the XML Schema, and submit that XML document as the payload of an\n&gt; &gt; HTTP POST. \n&gt; &gt; Correct?\n\n&gt; Walter Perry, leader of the NY XML SIG, has a different view when it \n&gt; comes to interacting with processes. I will do my best try to express \n&gt; my understanding of his views. In Walter&#39;s eyes the most important \n&gt; thing for a user to determine is what is a process&#39;s output. If the \n&gt; output is not of use, then the process is not of use. Walter is a \n&gt; little bit vaguer about how to identify a processes input format, he \n&gt; always says something like &#39;the best way to determine a process&#39;s \n&gt; input is to look at its output&#39; (paraphrased).\n\n&gt; Perhaps in this example of a PO, a more interesting approach is for \n&gt; the user to do a GET on a blank PO URI. This could return a PO XML \n&gt; instance with the parts and amounts left blank, but the whole XML \n&gt; structure present. Then the user could fill in the amounts and parts \n&gt; required and do a POST to the orders URI. This way if the service \n&gt; provider needs to change the PO format in a minor way, the chance of \n&gt; affecting the users is less because for each transaction the user \n&gt; begins by doing a GET on the blank PO URI. And if the user is clever \n&gt; they will add their details to the blank order in a way that won&#39;t be \n&gt; affected by such minor changes (for example if an extra element is \n&gt; added). (This is my personal interpretation of Walter&#39;s \n&gt; mysterious &quot;start with the output&quot;).\n\nI believe that Roger is more correct in his assessment of the\nsteps that need to take place. Roberts description of the process\nhas more of a &#39;screen scraping&#39; mentality. The DTD/Schema defines\nthe information required/allowed by the PO, period. Future changes\nto the internal representation of that document remain transparent\nto the user. Unless Parts Depot, Inc. provides a field in the \nDTD/Schema that allows the user to add their own details (and I&#39;m\nnot really sure what you mean here) to the PO, doing so would\ncause an error. \n\n&gt; What does everyone think?\n\n&gt; As for validation, Walter says it is up for the process to \n&gt; instantiate an instance of the data from the input it is given. And \n&gt; the user can determine if their input to the process was adequate if \n&gt; they get meaningful output. So schemata and DTDs are not required.\n\nThis certainly requires a lot more hand-shaking than forcing the\nuser to validate their input data against a DTD/Schema. If the user\ninputs data that is not validated by the process then the steps\nrequired to notify the user of where and why the errors occured\nincrease proportionally. If the originator of the PO (Parts Depot)\nsupplies knowledge of the correct input it is up to the user to\nsupply correct input.\n\nedge\n\n-- \n                                     e d g e @ e d g i n t o n . n e t\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n            &quot;I&#39;d love to go out with you, but I have to floss my cat.&quot;\n\n"}}
