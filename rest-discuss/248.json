Here&#39;s a suggestion:  how about we put it up on the\nREST Wiki?  I&#39;ll be happy to transfer it over, format it, etc.  Then, assuming\neverybody doesn&#39;t go morph the hell out of it, we can manage evolution of the\ndocument in place.\n\nHaving this many interesting parties collaborate on a document online may be a\nbit of an exercise in discipline, but I think it&#39;s manageable.
