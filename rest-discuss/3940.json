Somehow, &quot;API&quot; doesn&#39;t seem right.\n&gt; I would think something like\n&gt;\n&gt;     HTTPAI = HTTP Application Interface\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt;     ARI = Application Representation Interface\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt;     ASI = Application State Interface\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt;     RRI = Resource Representation Interface\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt;     RHI = REST-HTTP Interface\n&gt;\n&gt; or something along those lines would be more appropriate... Is\n&gt; there such a term already?
