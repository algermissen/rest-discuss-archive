We understand this to be an\n&gt;&gt; address to a resource (conceptually, the &quot;site&quot;).  We know that when we\n&gt;&gt; get back an HTML document for the GET request, we are returned a\n&gt;&gt; representation of that resource, constrained to content-type being\n&gt;&gt; returned.  Similarly, if we were to receive back a response of type\n&gt;&gt; &quot;text/robots&quot;, it is also just a representation of the same resource\n&gt;&gt; confined to the returned content-type.  Similarly, getting back a P3P\n&gt;&gt; document or a favicon, based on content-type, is still returning a\n&gt;&gt; representation of the same resource (the &quot;site&quot;).  I would not consider\n&gt;&gt; them to be meta-data, just more facets of the same resource.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, this is generally applicable, not just to the &quot;site root&quot;.  For\n&gt;&gt; instance, suppose we were to request &quot;http://sample.com/path/item&quot;.  If\n&gt;&gt; a text/robots response were returned, it could indicate the indexability\n&gt;&gt; of that resource (and/or possibly &quot;child&quot; resources).  Or you could get\n&gt;&gt; back a favicon just for that resource, or P3P info, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is possible to create ambiguity in communication, if we use HTTP\n&gt; Content Negotiation for &quot;information selection&quot;. Imagine when I pass\n&gt; to Joe a URL, and ask him to see my newly-design html home page; but\n&gt; when Joe dereference the URL, he get a P3P document.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I use URL in this way, I have to pass Joe an extra info: &quot;content\n&gt; type&quot;, along with that URL, to make sure we both see, and able to talk\n&gt; about the &quot;same information [1]&quot;.\n\nYou&#39;re always passing more information... you might pass:\n\n  http://mysite/my.p3p\n\nor you might pass:\n\n  http://mysite\n  accept: p3p\n\nI don&#39;t see the difference in information that you&#39;re having to\nspecify to get the p3p back.\n\n\nThe difference is that content-neg makes the p3p request unambiguously\nabout http://mysite/ - in other words it is clear that the p3p applies\nto that resource.\n\n\n&gt; My html home page and the p3p document are both different content-type\n&gt; and both refer to &quot;different information&quot;. However, a PNG-version,\n&gt; PostScript-version, PDF-version of the html home page refer to the\n&gt; &quot;same information&quot;, although their content-type are different.\n\nThe p3p document and the home page both refer to the site.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
