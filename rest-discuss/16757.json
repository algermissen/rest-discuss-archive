If json a=\r\nnd xml are both processable to the same output, as they usually are in thos=\r\ne frameworks, then conneg makes sense.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend conneg on html=\r\n and json on those resources, but json and xml as two serializations of the=\r\n same infoset is very much within what coneng was designed for. The differe=\r\nnce is mechanical in nature.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss=\r\n@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Eric J.=\r\n Bowman\nSent: 22 October 2010 01:30\nTo: Glenn Block\nCc: rest-discuss@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: The Future of WCF is indeed RESTful\n\n=\r\nGlenn Block wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. If you check the preso I made it clear this =\r\nwas about http and \n&gt; enabling REST....\n&gt; \n\nRight, that&#39;s exactly what I wa=\r\ns calling out for praise, sorry if it came across as criticism.  As to the =\r\npresentation, there was a Q&A discussion about the platform imposing design=\r\n criteria on the system under development, which you say you want to avoid.=\r\n  But, your example of /foo/bar making bar a child of foo, would do precise=\r\nly that.  I can think of more situations where bar isn&#39;t a child of foo, in=\r\n the application sense, than situations where it is -- most of the time, I =\r\nhave nothing there to inherit.  Unless you make that optional, but the pres=\r\nentation isn&#39;t clear in that regard, so this is just a note.\n\nThe other fee=\r\ndback I have is regarding Content-Location, not only for conneg but for sit=\r\nuations like &quot;author&#39;s preferred version&quot;.  The demo shows that you can ass=\r\nign multiple representations to a resource.  But this approach typically fa=\r\nils the identification of resources and self- descriptive messaging constra=\r\nints.  We&#39;ve discussed this here before, and I realize that I&#39;m in the mino=\r\nrity on this, but it&#39;s still a SHOULD in HTTP.\n\nWhat I&#39;d like from a platfo=\r\nrm, is the ability to define first an Atom resource, then a JSON resource, =\r\n*then* be able to define a resource which negotiates between them.  The pro=\r\nblem with Accept-based conneg, is that you don&#39;t always have control over t=\r\nhe client -- i.e. you can&#39;t tell a browser to negotiate between Atom and JS=\r\nON without Code on Demand.  So there needs to be some way to link directly =\r\nto the desired variant, without conneg.  Among other reasons.  Some of my r=\r\nationale rug was pulled out from under me with HTTPbis -11 about a day afte=\r\nr the last thread on this topic, but C-L with conneg is still a SHOULD, not=\r\n a MAY, for very good reasons.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-\n\nYahoo!
