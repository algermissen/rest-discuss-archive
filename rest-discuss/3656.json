What if an entity I invoke, invokes other entities, and what\n    &gt;&gt; if they have transactions of their own? Are they in the same\n    &gt;&gt; transaction? A new transaction? Do they nest?\n\n    Alex&gt; Presumably, when an entity receives a PREPARE request, it\n    Alex&gt; attempts to PREPARE any sub-transactions for which it is\n    Alex&gt; responsible.  If all those PREPAREs are successful, it\n    Alex&gt; returns 200 in response to PREPARE, otherwise it returns an\n    Alex&gt; error.  If it does anything else, it violates the semantics\n    Alex&gt; of PREPARE.\n\nWhy burden the programmer with this? How will you ever proof this\nworks? I rather have declarative transactional semantics. And\nsometimes you want to have points in a transaction that are saved\nregardless if an error occurs later on. Sometimes you want to start a\nnew transaction. And sometimes an administrator wants to have a\ndifferent policy (declarative).\n\nAll supported by current transaction processing software.\n\n\n    &gt;&gt; 2. What if an entity I invoke also sends messages? Are they in\n    &gt;&gt; the transaction as well? In what order?\n\n    Alex&gt; Presumably in the order of the entities that send them.  How\n    Alex&gt; does SOAP handle this issue?\n\nIt does not. It&#39;s completely outside SOAP. SOAP 1.1 is only about the\nwire format. I find SOAP 1.2 so unreadable, that I don&#39;t have any idea\nwhat it is saying )-:\n\nI just mentioned some things that message queuing software can\ndo. Those are really outside the SMTP protocol at the moment. Nothing\nprevents them to be added. But if you are lookingn for a solution now,\nSMTP does not play.\n\n\n    &gt;&gt; 3. If the client goes down, is the transaction committed?\n    &gt;&gt; Rolled back?  4. Doing two or three phase commit at the client\n    &gt;&gt; is really innovative I assume... What do we need transaction\n    &gt;&gt; managers for??\n\n    Alex&gt; In either protocol, there is no commit until COMMIT.  If you\n    Alex&gt; are concerned about client reliability in then set up a\n    Alex&gt; durable server to handle the commits.  In the HTTP context,\n    Alex&gt; you have a reliable HTTP server that posts PREPARE and\n    Alex&gt; perhaps COMMIT to a list of URLs supplied in a single HTTP\n    Alex&gt; request.  In the SMTP context, this is what SMTP servers\n    Alex&gt; already do for desktop mail clients.  The &quot;unreliable&quot;\n    Alex&gt; client sends messages to the server and the server is\n    Alex&gt; responsible for guaranteeing delivery.\n\nReplace your &quot;durable server&quot; by transaction processing manager and\nyour solution is exactly what I was talking about. Your &quot;durable\nserver&quot; is doing the work.\n\nBut again, the point is not if the HTTP server can do it, but that it\ndoes not currently. And secondly, letting the client decide the\ntransaction boundaries, is not very wide on the internet: you don&#39;t\nwant someone on the internet to have the possibility to determine\nduration of locks in your database.\n\n\n\n    &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. Priorization.\n    &gt;&gt; \n    S&gt; I am not sure what this means, but I suspect you don&#39;t want it\n    S&gt; because it violates the End-To-End principle.\n    &gt;&gt;  Absolutely not! If I want to have certain orders served at\n    &gt;&gt; higher priority, why should software prevent me? If I want\n    &gt;&gt; paying customers to serve at a higher priority at some site,\n    &gt;&gt; why not?\n\n    Alex&gt; I assume you are not familiar with the End-To-End (Dumb\n    Alex&gt; Network) principle.  Discussion on the internet is quite\n    Alex&gt; extensive.  \n\nWell, this is a business issue, isn&#39;t it? If a client asks you to\nimplement something, are you going to argue that maybe they should do\nsomething different? You can argue, if you are at a certain level in\nthe discussion, but if you are just hired to install the plumbing,\nyou&#39;re not going to decide that a different building might have been\nbetter.\n\nMaybe I was not clear in my replies: on request, I just pointed out\nwhat message queuing can do NOW for you. You started to give a\npossible implementation in SMTP/HTTP, which I argued does not even\nstart to address the issues that transaction processing software has\nsolved for a great many years. We can argue that transaction\nprocessing software is not needed, but that&#39;s a different discussion.\n\nI think message queueing etc. is great stuff for building your\nenterprise software. It&#39;s probably not that great to expose it to\nclients you don&#39;t have control about. I expose an SMTP/HTTP interface\nto the world, not COM objects, or an MQ Series queue. I think both\nsolutions have their proper place and proper ues.\n\n-- \nRegards,\n\nBerend. (-:\n\n\n"}}
