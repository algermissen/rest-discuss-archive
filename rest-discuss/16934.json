Sure ... if you think just &quot;doing REST&quot; gives you 24x7\n&gt; continuous availability then that&#39;s quite funny! And its not even\n&gt; April 1st.\n&gt; \n\nActually, Jan&#39;s referring to the reliability that is a goal of REST,\nsee 2.3.7:\n\n&quot;Reliability, within the perspective of application architectures, can\nbe viewed as the degree to which an architecture is susceptible to\nfailure at the system level in the presence of partial failures within\ncomponents, connectors, or data. Styles can improve reliability by\navoiding single points of failure, enabling redundancy, allowing\nmonitoring, or reducing the scope of failure to a recoverable action.&quot;\n\nWithout looking at it, I can assert that Apple&#39;s store can&#39;t possibly\nbe REST, just from the fact that purchasing needs to be suspended to\nupdate the user interface.  The constraint being violated is most\nlikely the layered-system constraint, application of which leads to\nexactly the sort of reliability not exhibited by the Apple store.  If\nit were RESTful, it would exhibit the desired property.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
