I could associate each \n&gt; re=\r\npresentation with its own URL, but that&#39;s not what I want.\n\nIdentification =\r\nof resources is fundamental to the Representational State\nTransfer. I favor=\r\n promoting representations to resources in their own\nright, because doing s=\r\no facilitates discussion, nuanced linking, and\nmanipulation.\n \n&gt; Essentiall=\r\ny, I only ever want to have one canonical URL and a requester \n&gt; gets to se=\r\ne what their credentials allow.\n\nSo, in HTTP, send a response with a &quot;Vary&quot;=\r\n header-field that indicates\nthat responses vary depending on credentials.\n=\r\n\n&gt; In particular, someone with \n&gt; no credentials at all may still get to se=\r\ne a rudimentary \n&gt; representation. In such a scenario there is no point in =\r\nchallenging the \n&gt; requester -- human user. They may decide to log in or lo=\r\ng in with \n&gt; different credentials, but that&#39;s up to the them.\n\nSo, in HTTP=\r\n, send a response with a status-code of &quot;200&quot; and still send\nthe challenge.=\r\n\n\n&gt; Also, as far as I can tell, an http auth challenge involves popping up =\r\na \n&gt; browser-level dialog. I take it [that] most users aren&#39;t accustomed to=\r\n this. \n&gt; And, at any rate, it modally drags them out of the application co=\r\nntext \n&gt; without a chance for inline help messages or &quot;I forgot my password=\r\n&quot; \n&gt; links.\n\nWhile the scene on the ground is rough and shabby, there is no=\r\nthing in\nthe HTTP specifications or in REST that mandates a lousy presentat=\r\nion of\nauthentication challenges. Clever people have found graceful ways of=\r\n\nusing HTTP authentication challenges and HTTP authentication that work\neve=\r\nn in the current crop of disgraceful implementations. Still, it would\nbe gr=\r\neat to have user agents that present authentication challenges\nalong with a=\r\nnd at the same time as entity-bodies.\n\nDear LazyWeb,\n\nMake for me a Web bro=\r\nwser that includes an informational banner where I\ncan easily evaluate and =\r\nmeet authentication challenges. I want clear\nindications of the authority i=\r\nssuing the challenge, the IRI of the\nresource in question, the authenticati=\r\non scheme, the security of the\nauthentication scheme, and the status of the=\r\n response as a whole.\n\n-- \nPlease do not reply to me when replying to rest-=\r\ndiscuss. I read the\nmessages that people send to rest-discuss and I do not =\r\nwant duplicates.\n\n\n"}}
