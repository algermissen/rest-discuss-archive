The book, plus the WCF Facility with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the Castle project, make WCF just about usable without epic frustration.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately though HATEOS and the other complex elements seem, to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; me, to be missing from RESTful WS too (or not covered in massive\n&gt;&gt;&gt; detail). To me this does somewhat leave the impression that REST is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not that well suited to enterprise apps (which I realize is incorrect).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The reason that you&#39;re not finding much on HATEOAS is that it is such a\n&gt;&gt; radically new concept in certain A2A (app-to-app, ie completely automated\n&gt;&gt; with no human in the loop) scenarios that no one is yet an expert on how to\n&gt;&gt; apply it. Yes, we have some basic HATEOAS capabilties in APP, but that&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; been pretty much only applied to content management scenarios: blogs,\n&gt;&gt; spreadsheets, DBs, calendars. Etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been increasingly using what (I think) would be considered\n&gt; HATEOS in Ajax-rich applications, whereby the javascript XHR is\n&gt; following/acting on  links on the page it, rather than constructing\n&gt; URLs to put/post/get/delete in the javascript code itself.  It&#39;s\n&gt; really just a design technique, but you end up with a javascript\n&gt; library that &quot;knows&quot; how to make use of urls on the page, and can thus\n&gt; be reused in many scenarios.  E.g., a javascript function might look\n&gt; for a form with a class designation &quot;deletable&quot;.  It would then know\n&gt; that &quot;action&quot; URL of the form (generally used as the post url) could\n&gt; be used to delete that particular resource, so it adds a delete button\n&gt; and sets an onclick handler on that button that makes a DELETE http\n&gt; request on that URI.  Javascript is basically the &quot;machine&quot; that uses\n&gt; hypertext to move through state transitions.\n&gt;\n&gt; --peter keane\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We have yet to see a real implemented &quot;enterprise&quot; example of HATEOAS for\n&gt;&gt; A2A (or B2B) for a transactional or even process control scenario. At least\n&gt;&gt; I have yet to see one. I have seen a robotics control protocol that adheres\n&gt;&gt; to most of the REST constraints, but it doesn&#39;t do HATEOAS.\n&gt;&gt; See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb483056.aspx .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So realistically we need a visionary pioneer to be the first to use HATEOAS\n&gt;&gt; in this way so that the rest of us can explain it to beginners. &lt;grin&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
