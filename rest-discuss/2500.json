TCP \n&gt; connections are kind of expensive and DNS runs all over the Internet \n&gt; trying to resolve each address.\n\nHow about the variant of TCP whose name I sadly forget which piggybacks\nthe first data on the connect packets? I seem to recall that reduced the\noverhead of TCP compared to UDP, particularly for small requests like DNS\nlookups, but as I can&#39;t remember the name I&#39;m having trouble finding it.\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
