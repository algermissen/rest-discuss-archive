I&#39;d think that cre=\r\nating verbs without extensive deliberation\nand reasoning would be a worse a=\r\nbuse of the model than tunneling. \n\nOn the other hand, I think the very fac=\r\nt that we have long discussions\nabout these topics indicates that any real =\r\nworld system is going to\nbreak the REST model somewhere, and we&#39;re just loo=\r\nking for the least\nugly compromise.  \n\n\neric. \n\n\n\n"}}
