Maybe even a\n&gt; specific very visible link &quot;What&#39;s RESTful, What&#39;s just HTTP?&quot; for  \n&gt; each\n&gt; specification would be warranted.  This link is where the spec  \n&gt; designers\n&gt; could state what they think is restful or not,\n\nI think this is dangerous as it leads people to think that they can  \nbreak certain constraints of REST as they wish as long as they put a  \nred warning sign on the specs. The thing that makes REST superior to  \nany other practiced approach towards enterprise distributed systems is  \nnot the specific style it specifies but that it specifies an  \narchitectural style *at all*.\n\nThe constraints of REST all contribute to a set of *predictable*  \nproperties of a RESTful system and enables system designers to reason  \nabout the system before they create it.\n\nIf you randomly ignore constraints of REST without first going through  \nthe same exercise Roy&#39;s went through in his thesis you create the same  \nstyle-less mess you have in existing enterprise IT systems.\n\nIf the propsed effort intends to use a modified REST it must first  \ncreate the theoretical framework for eavluating the modifications.  \nThis is far more important than actually specifiying anything new.\n\n-----\n\nOTH, I am having problems to determine whether you do want to stick  \nwith REST or not. The former means &#39;stick with REST and not a  \nmodification of it&#39; the latter will only bring value if you  \ninvestigate the resulting architectural style first.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; and where people could\n&gt; post links to blogs and articles that discuss what is and isn&#39;t  \n&gt; restful\n&gt; about our specifications.\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
