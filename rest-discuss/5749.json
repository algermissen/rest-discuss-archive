No matter how \n&gt; hard you try, you only get back representations of the resource.  What \n&gt; muddies this view is the way in which the web is currently used.  For \n&gt; instance, you place a file on your web server named index.html and \n&gt; assign it a URI (/http://example.com/index.html/).  Someone issues a GET \n&gt; request for that URI and gets back an identical copy of the resource.\n\nNo, they get back an identical copy of the representation. What you put \nup is a representation.\n\n&gt; This would lead many to the conclusion that index.html is itself the \n&gt; resource, and since you get exactly that back (byte-wise) in a GET \n&gt; request, the representation is effectively the resource itself.  As a \n&gt; result, many conveniently collapse the representation and the resource \n&gt; into one (which we know is not possible in REST).\n\nIt depends on what you are interested in. If \nhttp://example.net/cows/daisy returns information about Daisy the Cow \nI&#39;m probably looking at it due to my interest in Daisy, not my interest \nin the file itself. Daisy is the resource, http://example.net/cows/daisy \nis the URI, the file is the representation.\n\nHowever it is possible for a representation to be the resource itself. \nIf I go to http://example.net/applications/installCoolApp.exe and get a \nbunch of bytes that lets me install CoolApp on my computer what I am \ninterested in is that bunch of bytes. In this case the resource really \nis a bunch of bytes and the representation really is the same thing as a \nresource.\n\nRepresentations are streams of bytes, resources are anything, including, \nbut not limited to, streams of bytes.\n\nIt&#39;s worth noting that in the case where a resource and a representation \ncan be the same thing, other representations are still possible (an \nRDF/XML description of installCoolApp.exe for instance).\n\n&gt; What makes this worse is that we have some conventions (outdated, in my \n&gt; opinion) that adds to the confusion.  For instance, if you type in \n&gt; /http://example.com/, most servers will look for and return a &quot;default \n&gt; document&quot; such as /index.html/.  No, it doesn&#39;t redirect the user to \n&gt; that file.  It doesn&#39;t return a representation of its own resource, \n&gt; rather it impersonates another resource.  As a result, many consider \n&gt; /http://example.com/ and /http://example.com/index.html/ to be one and \n&gt; the same resource (which it isn&#39;t, or else it would have only one URI).  \n\nA URI can map to only one resource, but a resource can have more than \none URI. URIs are identifiers and there can be multiple identifiers for \nthe same resource just as with other identifiers - comparable with how I \nam sometimes called &quot;Jon&quot; and sometimes &quot;Jonathan&quot; and a few other \nnames, or with how I have both a British and an Irish social security \nnumber.\n\n"}}
