Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, the echo/atom API work is in fact what\n&gt; started me thinking about MoST.  My point is that\n&gt; we should not need an Atom API and a RSS API and a\n&gt; Wiki API and a RNA/Notification API and a Foo API.\n\nSo you are saying that I should be able to have an uber-client that would\nknow how to act with *any* resource merely be examing its schema?\n\n&gt; If servers exposed the underlying data model in a\n&gt; consistent syntactic format, e.g. XML then the\n&gt; only API you would need is the API for\n&gt; manipulating that syntactic model.  The meaning of\n&gt; changes to the model would be defined entirely by\n&gt; the XML schema.\n\nDoes this mean that the client is then in total control of the resource or\ndoes the server still do its own checks to ensure resource integrity?\n\n&gt; So, if you change from Atom to Pie to RSS.91 to\n&gt; RSS2 to RNA to ...., the API shouldn&#39;t change.\n&gt; Its always be GET/PUT/POST/DELETE against XML node\n&gt; ids and you know that this is the API because the\n&gt; content-type is text/XML!\n\nWhoa!  What does RNA have to do with Pie/RSS?  If that&#39;s what you think RNA\nis about, you have totally missed the point behind RNA.  Sure, some facets\nof blog systems (not RSS/Pie) could be implemented with RNA (which is what\nmy http://www.seairth.com/blog/industry/49 post was hinting at, though not\nvery successfuly).  But, to my knowledge, RNA is not interchangable with\n*any* other specification I am aware of, regardless of how exposed you make\nthe data model.\n\n&gt; My objection to ReST is precisely that:\n&gt; 1. there is no way to know the API a URI exposes\n&gt; without out-of-band communication\n\nTrue, but there is also no way to use any part of the web without at least\nan initial amount of out-of-band communication.  And there have been\nproposals such as Roger Costello&#39;s (et al.) Meta-Location header to help\nexpose information such as this.  It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s a start...\n\n&gt; 2. GET/PUT/POST/DELETE have no consistent\n&gt; *meaning* accross URI so API documentation ends up\n&gt; being extensive.\n\nWhat do you mean by no consistent meaning?  Regardless of the application\nused, I know the meaning of a GET.  I may not know what the results mean,\nbut I certainly know what the request means.  The same is pretty much true\nfor the other methods as well.  Now, I agree that they don&#39;t necessarily\nhave consistent implementation across URIs (e.g. some support only GET while\nothers support GET and PUT), but that&#39;s what an API (or RI or whatever) and\nthe HTTP 405 response is for (plus Allowed header).\n\n&gt; You have 13 pages of documentation simply to\n&gt; update an XML document with a well defined schema.\n&gt; You are clearly a smart person. You should find it\n&gt; frustrating to be spending your time writing such\n&gt; a document and your should find it even more\n&gt; frustrating to think about the number of\n&gt; programmers who have to spend time reading and\n&gt; understanding that document for your time\n&gt; investment to pay-off.\n\nWhy not define a computer-processable schema language for RESTful\ninterfaces?  Then, you could just generate the appropriate wrapper code at\nthe push of a button based on such a schema.  Wouldn&#39;t a MoSTful schema\nbasically provide the same thing?\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
