It doesn&#39;t sound idempotent the way I read it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reference to outbox made me think of Pauls description of the REST\n&gt; implementation of email\n&gt; (http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/), so I&#39;m\n&gt; assuming something like the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;   A &#39;GET /myqueue&#39; transfers a representation of the queue\n&gt; resource.  This\n&gt; would have a list of URIs identifying each queue entry e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;queue&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/1&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/2&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;     &lt;queue_entry href=&#39;/myqueue/n&#39;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/queue&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A GET on a queue entry (&#39;myqueue/2&#39;) returns reference to a\n&gt; queue entry, the\n&gt; contents of which would depend on how restrictive the queue\n&gt; needs to be,\n&gt; e.g. if it is ok for others to discover the end message then\n&gt; it would return\n&gt; something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;queue_entry message_href=&#39;/uri/to/real/message&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; but if you want one and only one consumer to discover the\n&gt; message it might\n&gt; return an empty entry and only return the message URI on a\n&gt; successful DELETE.\n&gt;\n&gt; A DELETE on a queue entry does the obvious and removes the\n&gt; message from the\n&gt; queue, returning the queue entry or message URI as a\n&gt; description of the\n&gt; result, unless of  course someone else has pulled the entry\n&gt; from the queue,\n&gt; in which case it returns the appropriate status code (404?)\n&gt;\n&gt; Robert\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
