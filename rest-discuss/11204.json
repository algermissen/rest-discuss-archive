Basically, the server can now expose the state of \nany domain object as an RDF/XML document, and there&#39;s also a SPARQL \nendpoint which maps to the internal query services. On the client there \nis then Java libraries that use these to find and load/store the data of \nthe domain model. All in all this makes it possible to have a domain \nmodel in Java and work with it in clients (e.g. applets/JavaWebStart) as \nif they were not remote (basically the REST/SPARQL interface acts like a \nremote database). If you&#39;re interested you can read more about it here:\nhttp://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/qi4j_rest_entitystore_and_sparql\n\nI would really like to have feedback from you about these ideas, and how \nto improve it to be as useful as possible.\n\nthanks,\n   Rickard\n\n"}}
