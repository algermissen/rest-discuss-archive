I&#39;m not\n&gt;&gt; talking about the uniform interface between components (a=\r\ns Roy is,\n&gt;&gt; which I agree is valuable), I&#39;m talking about your assertion t=\r\nhat the\n&gt;&gt; uniform interface does not apply to a resource whose client-side=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; representation is not &quot;hypertexty&quot;, and that DELETE on an image isn&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; legal.  I believe that it does apply, and that it is legal.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I feel=\r\n you&#39;re overreading &quot;hypertext is the engine&quot; as &quot;every \n&gt;&gt; representation =\r\nmust be hypertext&quot;.  I strongly believe that it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; perfectly legitimate =\r\nto have initial hypertext point you to\n&gt;&gt; absolutely any resource, even tho=\r\nse with a dumb media type, and you\n&gt;&gt; should be allowed to interact with th=\r\nat resource using the uniform\n&gt;&gt; interface. It&#39;s a leaf node in the hyperte=\r\nxt graph.  There are layers\n&gt;&gt; of contract involved; the per-resource contr=\r\nact (what control\n&gt;&gt; messages will this particular resource accept; i.e. wh=\r\nat content\n&gt;&gt; types) but then there are higher-level contracts (what operat=\r\nions can\n&gt;&gt; be performed on a given resource).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In an OO sense, given=\r\n a Collection&lt;User&gt;, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for \n&gt;&gt; User to have to impleme=\r\nnt DeletableFromCollections in order to be \n&gt;&gt; deleted.  That actually inte=\r\nrferes with abstraction; the User\n&gt;&gt; shouldn&#39;t even need to know whether it=\r\n is ever in a collection, or\n&gt;&gt; sitting around as a temp object, or whateve=\r\nr.  Same goes for\n&gt;&gt; resources.  The confusion is that we think we&#39;re talki=\r\nng directly to\n&gt;&gt; the resource, but we really aren&#39;t, we&#39;re talking through=\r\n an agent.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; PUT: hey agent, here&#39;s a resource representation, m\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Roy sez: &quot;REST connectors provide a generic interface for accessing\n&gt;&gt; an=\r\nd manipulating the value set of a resource.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Therefore, there is not=\r\nhing wrong with:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; GET /bob/assets\n&gt;&gt; application/assets+json\n&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n    &quot;assets&quot;: [&quot;http://server/bob/vacation.jpg&quot;, \n&gt;&gt; &quot;http://server/bob/wif=\r\ne.gif&quot;]\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt; DELETE /bob/vacation.jpg\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The resource &quot;/bob/assets&quot; =\r\nacted as the hypertext engine, linking me\n&gt;&gt; to a bunch of image resources,=\r\n and I sent a control message to the\n&gt;&gt; http connector requesting that one =\r\nof them be deleted.  The media\n&gt;&gt; type of the resource I deleted was frankl=\r\ny irrelevant.  The notion\n&gt;&gt; that I can&#39;t delete an image/jpg off a server =\r\nuntil someone creates a\n&gt;&gt; new &quot;hypertext image&quot; format that advertises its=\r\n own contract is what\n&gt;&gt; I object to. (Besides, image/jpg is just a represe=\r\nntation, the\n&gt;&gt; backing resource is anonymous to the client, so I fail to s=\r\nee why the\n&gt;&gt; &quot;manipulating the value set of a resource&quot; has to do with one=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; representation rather than the more important aspect: the uniform\n&gt;&gt; in=\r\nterface for the connector.)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -rg\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
