I&#39;ve just been using it to return  \nacceptable methods, a la &quot;Allow: Post, Get&quot;.  I supposed returning a  \nresource would work too.  As first thought, something like:\n\nhttp://www.foo.com/&lt;resource&gt;/&lt;action&gt;/&lt;request,response&gt;\n\nwould return the representation format for a particular actions  \nrequest or response.  But this doesn&#39;t feel to RESTy to me.\n\nAnyone else?\n\nGriffin\nOn Sep 11, 2007, at 8:43 AM, Marc Hadley wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Posted by: &quot;Griffin Caprio&quot; griffin.caprio@... griffinc18\n&gt; &gt; Mon Sep 10, 2007 2:43 pm (PST)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, maybe I misunderstood what was meant by &quot;metadata&quot; when i\n&gt; &gt; originally read about HEAD.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was originally wondering if anyone used HEAD retrieve metadata\n&gt; &gt; about a specific resource, perhaps returning XSD schemas or\n&gt; &gt; something. But since HEAD is meant to return HTTP headers, it\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem logical to try and return that type of metadata in a\n&gt; &gt; header.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That being said, what is the RESTful way, if there is one, to serve\n&gt; &gt; up request / response formats?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds like a job for the OPTIONS method. I&#39;ve been noodling with the\n&gt; idea of returning a WADL snippet in the response to an OPTIONS\n&gt; method. Essentially you&#39;d return a resource element that describes\n&gt; the supported methods and representation formats. Need to think about\n&gt; it some more but would be interested in folks thoughts about this\n&gt; approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Marc.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Marc Hadley &lt;marc.hadley at sun.com&gt;\n&gt; CTO Office, Sun Microsystems.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
