Why do people want to provide both\n&gt; SOAP and REST interfaces? When they decide to do, do they want to use\n&gt; the same code base to process the requests? I can see lots of issues.\n&gt; Has anyone on this list got experience doing both for the same\n&gt; application?\n\nYes. The same  application I was talking about a couple days ago.  \nThere&#39;s also a (very limited) SOAP API. It went down something like  \nthis:\n\n* bizdev: hey, we need to do some interaction with Sharepoint,  \nwebparts, C# etc\n* devs: let&#39;s make an HTTP/REST API, everything can talk to the web,  \nit&#39;ll be awesome!\n* bizdev: let&#39;s not alienate the enterprise people, do SOAP\n* devs: awwwww, okay &lt;time passes&gt; here you go, hope that helps.\n* bizdev: cool, thanks guys\n* devs: I CAN HAZ REST API?\n* bizdev: oh sure, you&#39;ve been good\n* devs: squeeeeeee! &lt;time passes&gt; whoa, man, that was awesome.\n* other devs: wow, this is so much more awesome than the SOAP API,  \nit&#39;s like useful and stuff\n* bizdev: what you guys so excited about, I don&#39;t get it?\n\nIn this particular application the SOAP and REST APIs are dispatched  \nthrough the same web server and operate through shims of code that  \ndispatch into the same core code. The SOAP API is a straightforward  \ncollection of 4 or 5 methods, providing a very limited set of  \nactivities: there are a small number of verbs and nouns tightly  \ncoupled with one another. The REST API is straightforward collection  \nof a bunch of nouns just out there for your messing with, with a  \nlimited set of a well known verbs.\n\nWe hear this a lot: &quot;Can the SOAP API do X?&quot; &quot;No, but the REST API can.&quot;\n\nThis isn&#39;t just because the REST style is better at providing stuff.  \nIt&#39;s also better, because of its consistency and interity, at  \nencouraging code to be written:\n\n&quot;Will you add feature X to the SOAP API?&quot; &quot;Meh, that&#39;s hard.&quot;\n&quot;Will you add feature X to the REST API?&quot; &quot;Sure.&quot;\n\nIn the end it comes down to what people perceive the customer to want.  \nSome customers are in environments where using SOAP or other WS-* is  \nnormal. If you want to support those people you sometimes have to work  \nwith their stuff.\n\n-- \nChris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\nor I&#39;ll remove your commit bit\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
