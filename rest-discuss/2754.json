Mike Dierken \nwrote:\n&gt; The only caution I would have is when server tools parse the request, \n&gt; they\n&gt; don&#39;t always do it right. Often they provide a request property called\n&gt; &#39;parameters&#39; - but there is no such thing in the protocol. This \n&gt; usually is a\n&gt; blending of the query terms from the resource identifier and the \n&gt; name/value\n&gt; pairs from the content being posted.  Another example where common \n&gt; tools are\n&gt; broken with respect to using the protocol correctly.\n\nagreed.  in perl, pretty much all of the CPAN CGI modules (including \nthe erst-while CPAN.pm) advertise this breakage as a feature (although \nto be fair i guess not many people care outside of those who are aware \nof REST), and you have to explicitly configure the modules to \ndistinguish between the url-encoded entity body and the query string.\n\ni just read STDIN or the QUERY_STRING environment variable and use a \nhash keyed on the value of Content-type header to pick out an \nappropriate parser.  if you want me to elaborate on this chris, let me \nknow; i have a CGI script doing this.\n\ni&#39;m using this in combination with mod_rewrite to have nice URIs which \nreflect the hierarchy.  this isn&#39;t strictly a requirement of being \nRESTful; i just like it this way.  it keeps verbs out of the URIs, they \nonly have nouns in them.\n\ni am working on a system for tracking fund-raising.\n\ni have mod_rewrite rules in apache which do the following:\n\n/contributors/?foo=bar      becomes \n/cgi-bin/contributors/index.cgi?foo=bar\n/contributors/12345         becomes \n/cgi-bin/contributors/one.cgi?id=12345\n/contributors/12345?foo=bar becomes \n/cgi-bin/contributors/one.cgi?id=12345&foo=bar\n\nand so on.  each CGI script handles all requests (GET, POST for know \nbecause that&#39;s all the clients support).\n\ni&#39;m toying with the idea of boiling this stuff down into a CPAN module \ncalled CGI::Resource or something; maybe when i have a bit more \nexperience of how well this works in practice.  if anybody wants \nboilerplate source shout.\n\nto answer your question, POSTing to a URI with a querystring is \ndefinitely possible, and probably OK.  i prefer to use querystrings for \nqueries parameters only as much as possible, but pragmatism wins out \neasily over that most of the time.  the tool support for eliminating \nquerystrings except for queries isn&#39;t really there (yet).  hence my \nwrestling with mod_rewrite.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
