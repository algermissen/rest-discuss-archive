Looking at the HTTP specs,\n&gt; I am not sure if it is ok for the server to return a representation\n&gt; of the deleted resource. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The second issue I am not sure about is whether it is semantically\n&gt; ok to use DELETE on a subordinate resource to alter the state of\n&gt; the container itself. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jan Algermissen\n&gt; Consultant & Programmer\t\n&gt; http://www.jalgermissen.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
