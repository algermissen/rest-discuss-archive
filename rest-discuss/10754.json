If the server is functioning well (in this case,\n&gt; properly enforcing the quota) , then it should never issue 5xx responses,\n&gt; IMO.\n\nEh, 507 seems good enough to issue an &quot;out of space&quot; message. If the\nuser really cares about the difference between physical and quota\nlimits, by all means go into detail in the response body. I don&#39;t see\nmuch point in debating a 4xx status code.
