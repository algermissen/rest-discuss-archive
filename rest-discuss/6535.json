Bowman schrieb:\n&gt; Yes, I understand that Content-Location is optional, in fact that is why\n&gt; there&#39;s a VARY header. Either way, multiple representations are associated\n&gt; with one URI. It is my belief that in a REST system, these variants should\n&gt; be individually addressable as resources in their own right. Even if those\n&gt; URIs are not sent in Content-Location when a system is deployed, that \n&gt; should\n&gt; certainly be a capability of any implementation.\n\nI do agree that it&#39;s good to have a separate URI when there&#39;s a chance \nthat that representation is authorable, or that people may want to \nbookmark it. It&#39;s not entirely clear to my why it&#39;s desirable in the \ngeneral case (why does it matter?).\n\n&gt; No, of course not, not according to RFC 3296 or RFC 2616 but we are talking\n&gt; about REST which is a best-practices subset of what is possible, aren&#39;t we?\n&gt; If you can&#39;t assign each of your variants a URI, how do you know your \n&gt; negotiated resource isn&#39;t an endpoint?\n\nHow is that relevant to the client? Also, what&#39;s the definition of an \n&quot;endpoint&quot;?\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
