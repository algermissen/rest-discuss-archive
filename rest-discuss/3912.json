In your example, I know that I can POST a\n&gt; &gt; mime/rfc822 because the inbox is message/delivery. But your doc is one\n&gt; &gt; line because the documentation of these content-type has already been\n&gt; &gt; done. Someone can&#39;t use your message system without reading all the mime\n&gt; &gt; stuff... quite long!...\n&gt; \n&gt; You need to define/select content-types *no matter what*.  My point is that \n&gt; you DON&#39;T need to define the behavior of HTTP methods because RFC2616 \n&gt; already does that.  If you are defining behavior for existing HTTP methods, \n&gt; you are probably violating the RFC.  And if you don&#39;t want to read the MIME \n&gt; RFCs, define a shorter content-type format:\n\nI don&#39;t define behaviours of HTTP methods, I define behavious of\nresources\n\n&gt; ===Syntax===\n&gt; text/notification-container: part*\n&gt; part: location? &quot;&#92;n&quot; text/notification &quot;&#92;n&quot;\n&gt; location: URL\n&gt; text/notification: (name-value-pair &#92;s)*\n&gt; name-value-pair: name &quot;:&quot; value &quot;&#92;n&quot;\n&gt; name: [^&#92;s:]+\n&gt; value: [^&#92;n&lt;&gt;]*\n&gt; identity: value &quot;&lt;&quot; [A-z0-9]+ &quot;@&quot; DOMAIN-NAME &quot;&gt;&quot;\n&gt; ==Semantics==\n&gt; &quot;Location&quot; name identifies notified resource. requires URL value\n&gt; &quot;From&quot; name identifies notifier, requires identity value\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm 12 more lines in ~5 min.  Still much less work than all of RNA.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note: Your container syntax MUST be a container for MIME types or you can&#39;t \n&gt; POST to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I state somewhere that the index format used in a system IS a\n&gt; &gt; container,\n\nI mean a container representation\n&gt;  then you can not say that nothing is imply any more, and it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; again juste one line (as long as &quot;container&quot; is supposed known, i.e. you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need to describe a container behaviour, which is not so\n&gt; &gt; obvious...). That is what I mean by &quot;super-types&quot;. a message/digest IS a\n&gt; &gt; container, an RSS feed IS a container, a directory index IS a\n&gt; &gt; container...\n&gt; \n&gt; An index is, by definition, a container only of pointers and not of the \n&gt; indexed information itself.  You can *say* otherwise.  It just wouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; true.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Back to back, they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each \n&gt; other.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
