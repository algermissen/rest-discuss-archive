Each product has a URI that  \n&gt; uniquely identifies it. But each URI has a zillion representations  \n&gt; based on who is asking for the resource. Each user sees the same  \n&gt; product information except that it has recommendations and other links  \n&gt; specific to the user. When I bookmark the page to del.ico.us, or email  \n&gt; it to another user, the URI still resolves to the same product, but  \n&gt; with a personalized representation. To me, this is completely RESTful  \n&gt; and does not require user-specific URLs.\n\nThe resource is different, whether the abstract object denoted is the\nsame or not. So it&#39;s not RESTful. Think about it - could it be cached?\n\nA RESTful approach to this would be to have a bookmarkable or shareable\nURL that denotes the target, which redirects on resolution to the\npersonalised resource&#39;s URL. I can&#39;t see Amazon going for something like\nthis though unless there were better support in HTTP and the deployed\nbrowser base for it - canonical URLs and silent redirects, so that the\nshareable/bookmarkable URL is the one that remains in the user&#39;s\nlocation bar. People are too used to just copying and pasting the URLs\nthey see.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
