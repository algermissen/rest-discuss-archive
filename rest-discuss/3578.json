Thats what I meant when I\n&gt; said I have to &#39;carry&#39; my basket around the store.\n&gt;\n&gt; This may make the programming maginally trickier, granted, as the\n&gt; product pages will have to contain the identifier for my basket within \n&gt; them.\n\nyes.\n\nthe representations generated can differ depending on whether there is \na logged in session; e.g. include some HTML form UI which does a POST \nto the URI of &#39;my basket&#39; or else some text saying &#39;you need to log in \nbefore you can buy stuff&#39; or whatever.\n\n&gt;&gt; and how do you do *that*\n&gt;&gt; without having a cookie to tell you who&#39;s logged in, and hence to use\n&gt;&gt; /customers/semantico/basket/ vis-a-vis /customers/vdm/basket/ ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, but if you were using cookies then the POST would be to /my_basket,\n&gt; and the internal logic of the application would direct that to\n&gt; /customers/semantico/basket/ or /customers/vdm/basket/ - these \n&gt; resources\n&gt; would not be directly exposed to the POST, they would be internal to \n&gt; the\n&gt; application. Which reduces visibility.\n\nquite.  i hadn&#39;t even considered that possibility to be honest.  thanks \nfor sharing it.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
