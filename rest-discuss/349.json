Some of us have made the claim --- admittedly rather\n&gt; poorly substantiated --- that HTTP forms a kind of &quot;coordination language&quot;\n&gt; similar to Linda in its potential application.  We haven&#39;t done a\n&gt; particularly good job of explaining what that means and, indeed, the very\n&gt; notion of a &quot;coordination language&quot; is rather underdefined.\n\nAhh. Too bad. I was hoping that Linda was to HTTP as the Lambda Calculus\nis to Scheme. \n\n&gt; &gt; How is a &quot;resource&quot; isomporphic to a &quot;tuple space&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wrong abstractions. \n\nSorry. I meant resource to tuple.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; For the others, the mapping is pretty straightforward if a bit inexact.\n&gt; out() is like PUT, rd() is like GET, and in() is like an atomic GET+DELETE.\n\nInteresting that there is no POST. POST is the Web&#39;s achilles heel in\nmany ways. It isn&#39;t obvious that it is necessary but it is also the\n&quot;most popular&quot; method in that people tend to fall back on it when they\nare too lazy to figure out the others.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s important to understand that most distributed algorithms using Linda as\n&gt; a coordination paradigm strongly require the latter in() semantics, which are\n&gt; obviously missing in HTTP.\n\nGrumble...why couldn&#39;t this all map nicely. \n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Data decoupled from process:  data artifacts can easily be generated and\n&gt; placed at URI where the persist after the producer is finished.\n\nSort of. But if the Google guys turn off Google it goes away. There is\nno big tuplespace in the sky keeping track of every URI ever generated.\nThank god!\n\n&gt; Communication is anonymous, in the sense of producer and consumer don&#39;t have\n&gt; to &quot;know&quot; each other, and communication is mediated by the TS:  same thing\n&gt; for the Web, all producer and consumer have to &quot;know&quot; about each other is how\n&gt; to address the resource artifacts each produce in the URI space, and HTTP&#39;s\n&gt; generic methods and architecture mediates the connection.  \n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not.  The claim isn&#39;t that the Web *is* Linda, it&#39;s that the GET, PUT,\n&gt; POST, etc. methods on URI space form a coordination language in the same\n&gt; sense Linda does --- but with different coordination primitives.\n\nToo bad they are different. I guess most CS analysis of Linda will not\napply to the Web. \n\n&gt; I like the idea, but it&#39;s not clear that the claim is useful.  ;-)\n\nYep.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
