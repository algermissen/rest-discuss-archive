Maybe if we throw RDF in to the equation too, care\n&gt; to hazard a guess at how many variations we&#39;d have one year on? each with\n&gt; their own version of &#39;named graphs&#39;, subject literals, and all kinds of\n&gt; other things. Maybe we should scope out of sem web territory and consider\n&gt; JSON, do you think there may be a couple of media types minted for a JSON\n&gt; representation of a &#39;User&#39; yet? any other objects that somebody somewhere\n&gt; would think it&#39;s a good idea to define as a media type and mint a new URI\n&gt; for? Maybe if we throw in XML and HTML too, in fact every existing media\n&gt; type from every domain and every expert who thinks X media type they use\n&gt; often is lacking something, and all of those who think there&#39;s a better way\n&gt; to do Y, and all those people who simply don&#39;t understand Z yet so have\n&gt; invented FOO; perhaps we should also consider all of those vendors who&#39;d\n&gt; like some lock in, so they&#39;ve moved to some custom media types and minted a\n&gt; few URIs, and of course are only supporting those media types now.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you think for a second that you may just create a new media type and\n&gt; mint a URI for it, then you can knock the number of media types you think\n&gt; there will be one year on up by (at least) one, then add on a couple for\n&gt; every person on this list you think might be wanting to create a new media\n&gt; type, quite sure you could get +100 out of that :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Might be fun to say this came in to effect on the 22nd September 2005!\n&gt; Should be about the same but 5 years on, wonder if any of those domains have\n&gt; dropped yet.. wonder which ones the major vendors are supporting.. think any\n&gt; little payments might have been made to tool providers to get support for X\n&gt; media type in there?
