I *like* XSLT, but\nthe Result Tree Fragment concept is utterly braindead. It’s\nnaught but premature optimisation by committee; the WG thought\nthat requiring implementors to return full node sets from\ntemplates would be an undue burden. The upshot is that nearly\nevery single XSLT 1.0 processor has an extension function to\nconvert RTFs to node sets – such as `msxsl:node-set`. Looks like\nthe committee guessed wrong. Indeed, XSLT 2.0 does away with the\nRTF brain damage.\n\n(I almost never write XSLT without reaching for EXSLT. Some\nthings are impossible without `exsl:node-set`, and trying to\nmung text content with bare XSLT is an exercise in pain and\nsuffering. Also, processing Atom without EXSLT’s datetime\nfunctions is lots of unfun.)\n\nHowever I can’t exactly second Mike’s experience (as you’d\nguess by the fact that I like XSLT). Admittedly, I haven’t had\nparticularly large XSLT codebases to maintain. The largest one\nis a set of transforms based on a library of templates shared\nbetween them, running up to about 2,000 lines or so all told. As\nI said, not huge – but still substantial. I have found myself\namazed time and again at how quickly I could get back into the\ncode, sometimes almost a year after the last time I touched it,\nand add a moderately complex feature after just minutes of\nreorientation. I feel confident that I could maintain an XSLT\ncodebase 5× the size without any trouble.\n\nMaybe I am exceptional, as Mike would apparently argue; I dunno.\nI certainly don’t feel like a genius most of the time, though.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
