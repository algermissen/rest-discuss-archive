REST people view &quot;protocol independence&quot; as \n&gt; over-engineering, and try to stick with HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nIt just seems to me that trying to use HTTP asynchronously is like \nputting a round peg in a square whole.  On the internet, email is used \nfor asynchronous communication.  Why not use it for web services?\n\nAnother thought is SMS, but not sure how viable it is on a non-cell network.\n\n\n&gt; b) With email the only only &quot;verb&quot; is to send a message. The &quot;real&quot; verb \n&gt; will end up inside the message body, thus making it an RPC. (Unless you \n&gt; intend to make a uniform interface out of the SMTP commands themselves, \n&gt; like HELO and DATA.. but at that low of a level SMTP is not actually \n&gt; asynchronous so why use it?)\n&gt; \n\nI guess there would be a logical constrained interface of &quot;send&quot; and \n&quot;receive&quot;.\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
