The distinction between RPC and REST is\nincoherent.  We are really talking only about\nside-effects.  Since there are many\ninteresting queries that involve message bodies,\nand HTTP defines only GET as having no\nside-effect, REST doesn&#39;t help you much.  Thinking\nof applications as simple messages between\nentities gets you just as far (if not farther).\n\n2. You certainly CAN implement the actual delivery\nof email using HTTP rather than SMTP.  I just\ndon&#39;t think it provides you with a lot of value.\nI think it makes more sense to focus on tracking\nand controlling email messages which I think is\northogonal and doesn&#39;t crash you into an installed\nbase.  To put it another way, adding monitoring\ntools for mail servers that expose an HTTP\ninterface seems like a good idea.  Bothering to\nreplace SMTP itself with HTTP seems much less\nuseful (and irrelevant to the better activity!).\n\nFeel free to agree/disagree.  I am done with this\nargument either way.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS I am really impressed with how powerful HTTP\npersistent connections can be.  Thank you for the\ninsight.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
