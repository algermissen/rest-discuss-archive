I usually\n&gt; think of it as meaning indivisible.  Is there such a thing as a\n&gt; monolithic interface?  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not visualizing this very\n&gt; well.\n\nI think of &quot;atomic&quot; as individible. Monolithic means &quot;not divided when \nit should be.&quot; dictionary.com says: &quot;Constituting or acting as a single, \noften rigid, uniform whole&quot;\n\nTo me, a &quot;monolithic interface&quot; is a network-addressable object that \ncontains many &quot;logical&quot; objects which are not directly addressable \nthemselves. e.g. purchase orders that do not have URIs themselves, but \ninstead have purchase order numbers that must be submitted to the \nmonolitic service in order to manipulate the acutal purchase order. A \nproperly factored service would give each logical object a first-class \nURI address.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
