Amazon.com \n&gt; stores the state of the shopping cart on the server so that when a \n&gt; customer logs in, they can see the items they have saved.  How is \n&gt; this RESTful?  \n\nAmazon&#39;s shopping cart is NOT RESTfull. The state is stored in a\nsession object that is associated with you by a cookie.\n\nIt *can* be done RESTfully. If the shopping cart is a resource then\nyou can POST (or PUT) items into it. The shopping cart can then be\nscaled in the same way other resources are scaled.\n\n\n&gt; request to the server had already depended on the fact that the prior \n&gt; requests setup the shopping cart to add items, etc.  To be RESTful, I \n&gt; would think that each request would carry the list of items in the \n&gt; shopping cart.\n\nThat would be another way of doing it. Much less efficient than just\nkeeping a resource.\n\nThere are resource based shopping carts out there. Check the list\narchives and you&#39;ll find them.\n\n\n&gt; So, if you look at a Session in a web application.  I see this as a \n&gt; database.  It stores information on the server, although the session \n&gt; is meant to be only temporary--it may very well be persisted to a \n&gt; file store for clustering.  This of course has been argued before as \n&gt; not being RESTful.  How would this be different from having a \n&gt; database storing all the information its clients have changed?  That \n&gt; database has to be shared among all servers which is not scalable.\n\nWell... pushing sessions back into the database does make a\nnon-RESTfull app more scalable because databases tend to be more\nscalable than app server session load balancers.\n\nBut such apps do tend to have higher latency. And you have to be\namazon to scale up to amazon request levels.\n\n\nIf you do things by resource then you scale at the webserver which is\ncheap and simple. You then need to aggregate that data (when you need\nto aggregate) but the collectivization tends to be less frequent than\natomic writes.
