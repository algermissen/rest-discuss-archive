It seems wrong to use the same\n&gt; &quot;base&quot; URI as when I get one car, i.e.:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /car/1 &lt;-- get car with id 1\n&gt; GET /car &lt;-- get all cars\n&gt; GET /car?make=ferrari &lt;-- get all ferraris\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like it&#39;s better to create a new resource, like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /cars &lt;-- get all cars\n&gt; GET /cars?make=ferrari &lt;-- get all ferraris\n\nBoth approaches are fine from a REST POV. The latter is IMO more  \nhuman friendly as it emphasizes the fact that we are dealing with a  \ncollection of cars. Indexing into the collection using a query string  \nis good practice as is using the hierarchical structure of URIs to  \ndenote the individuals (or subclasses).\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that a better way to structure the resources? How do you normally\n&gt; do actions like searching?\nWhat you did looks just fine.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In either case, the /car/ or /cars/ won&#39;t support the POST(?), PUT,\n&gt; DELETE verbs. Should all resources support all verbs to follow the\n&gt; REST style? (Wikipedia: &quot;A set of well-defined operations that apply\n&gt; to all pieces of information (called resources)&quot;)\n&gt;\nThe resources need not implement the methods, but it is important  \nthat the uniform interface only consists of such methods that  \n*conceptually* apply to all resources. E.g. it is ok to have a PATCH  \nor MONITOR method but it would not be ok to have a SHIFT_GEAR method  \nas there might be a lot of things that do not have gears.\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\n\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jonas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
