The goal of my thesis is the development of a graphical\n&gt; modelin=\r\ng language for resource-oriented (aka RESTful) applications\n&gt; following cri=\r\nteria defined by Daniel Moody [1].\n&gt; Part of this development is also the e=\r\nvaluation of the new language I\n&gt; have developed regarding these criteria.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I would therefore like to ask you for your support by taking the\n&gt; ques=\r\ntionnaire I have devised to do that evaluation. Filling out the\n&gt; questionn=\r\naire will take about 20 minutes. It is available online under\n&gt; the followi=\r\nng URL:\n&gt; http://bit.ly/visualRest\n&gt;\n&gt; As a small &quot;thank you&quot; for filling o=\r\nut the questionnaire, you also\n&gt; have the chance to win one of three books =\r\nafterwards (details can be\n&gt; found under the aforementioned URL).\n&gt;\n&gt; The q=\r\nuestionnaire is online and ready to take input starting today\n&gt; (February 7=\r\nth) and will be closed on February 20th.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really appreciate your=\r\n help and am looking forward to your\n&gt; answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you and best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Oliver van Porten\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
