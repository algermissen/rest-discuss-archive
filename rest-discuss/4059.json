As a \n&gt; result, the client&#39;s behavior for the PUT version and the GET version is \n&gt; exactly the same.  Is this RESTful?  Half of me says &quot;yes&quot; because the \n&gt; client doesn&#39;t see any difference between the two representations, and \n&gt; the other half says &quot;no&quot; because it isn&#39;t exactly the same (as a \n&gt; generalized xml document, ignoring byte-wise comparison).\n\nThere&#39;s no guarantee, in general, that a PUT followed by a GET, even\n&quot;immediately&quot;, will return the same content.  The content crossed a\ntrust boundary; anything goes.  If you want an expectation of that sort,\nit should be declared in the message (similar to SOAPAction).\n\nIt&#39;s possible there could be some self-descriptive problems with the\ndata format - I can&#39;t tell - but since this is a response and not a\nrequest, that doesn&#39;t matter anyhow, I think.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
