That is, requests from the server to \n&gt; the client?  I guess the appropriate way is to have the &quot;server&quot; make \n&gt; HTTP requests of the &quot;client&quot;.  But that can&#39;t be done if the client is \n&gt; behind a firewall.\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically, my intention is to piggyback the reverse request in a \n&gt; response to a request from the client.  Then the client would respond by \n&gt; sending a new request to the server, and so forth.  The resource URL for \n&gt; the reverse request would now have to be encoded in the body of the HTTP \n&gt; response.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n\nYuk.\n\nI know lots of people who&#39;ve tried to do this.
