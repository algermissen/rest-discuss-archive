We understand this to be an\n&gt; address to a reso=\r\nurce (conceptually, the &quot;site&quot;).  We know that when we\n&gt; get back an HTML d=\r\nocument for the GET request, we are returned a\n&gt; representation of that res=\r\nource, constrained to content-type being\n&gt; returned.  Similarly, if we were=\r\n to receive back a response of type\n&gt; &quot;text/robots&quot;, it is also just a repr=\r\nesentation of the same resource\n&gt; confined to the returned content-type.  S=\r\nimilarly, getting back a P3P\n&gt; document or a favicon, based on content-type=\r\n, is still returning a\n&gt; representation of the same resource (the &quot;site&quot;). =\r\n I would not consider\n&gt; them to be meta-data, just more facets of the same =\r\nresource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, this is generally applicable, not just to the &quot;site roo=\r\nt&quot;.  For\n&gt; instance, suppose we were to request &quot;http://sample.com/path/ite=\r\nm&quot;.  If\n&gt; a text/robots response were returned, it could indicate the index=\r\nability\n&gt; of that resource (and/or possibly &quot;child&quot; resources).  Or you cou=\r\nld get\n&gt; back a favicon just for that resource, or P3P info, etc.\n\nIt is po=\r\nssible to create ambiguity in communication, if we use HTTP\nContent Negotia=\r\ntion for &quot;information selection&quot;. Imagine when I pass\nto Joe a URL, and ask=\r\n him to see my newly-design html home page; but\nwhen Joe dereference the UR=\r\nL, he get a P3P document.\n\nIf I use URL in this way, I have to pass Joe an =\r\nextra info: &quot;content\ntype&quot;, along with that URL, to make sure we both see, =\r\nand able to talk\nabout the &quot;same information [1]&quot;.\n\nMy html home page and t=\r\nhe p3p document are both different content-type\nand both refer to &quot;differen=\r\nt information&quot;. However, a PNG-version,\nPostScript-version, PDF-version of =\r\nthe html home page refer to the\n&quot;same information&quot;, although their content-=\r\ntype are different.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI.html#argum=\r\nent\n\n\nCheers,\n--\nTeo HuiMing (toydi)\nteohuiming.work at gmail dot com\n\n"}}
