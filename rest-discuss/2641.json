Some uses might not care - like\nif the data set was small and only occasionally used. But generally, my\nguess is that having chunks available is okay. If a client always gets all\nchunks, then you might as well stream the whole thing out in one chunk\nthough. If you have good caching knowledge, then maybe chunks help.\n\nMaybe you should address the chunks not by lexical range, but by words\nthemselves. Depends on what data the client is likely to retrieve - try to\nput that stuff in one chunk.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;    Or am I actually wrong when I think that the two URIs above identify\nthe same\n&gt;    resource (is the query string part of the URI? )?\nThe query parameters are part of the URI, so these two URI are different\nresources.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;    I think that I so far understood that fragment identifiers are not part\nof the\n&gt;    URI (don&#39;t affect what the URI identifies) and so I wonder if it would\nbe better\n&gt;    to move the range part in a fragment:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http:/foo.bar/archive/index#a-c\n&gt;    http:/foo.bar/archive/index#d-f\nThis would cause a single &#39;index&#39; resource to be retrieved - on large chunk.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; or if\n&gt;\n&gt; b) the above is actually the wrong wy to think and if it would be better\nto view all\n&gt;    the different chunks of the index as concepts themselves and to create\nresources\n&gt;    for them:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http:/foo.bar/archive/index\n&gt;\n&gt;    might then return something like\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;index&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;subindex range=&quot;a-c&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/a-c&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;subindex range=&quot;d-f&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/d-f&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;    &lt;/index&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    which would allow the server to control the size of the chunks\ndynamically.\n&gt;    If the index is quite small it might &#39;choose&#39; to return\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;index&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;subindex range=&quot;a-m&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/a-m&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;subindex range=&quot;n-z&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/n-z&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/index&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    instead.\nGood use of hypertext to give central control & still minimize client\ncoupling. However (and this is from previous arguments PaulP and I have\nhad), the client is still dependent on the &quot;range=&#39;a-m&#39;&quot; concept - the name\n&#39;range&#39; and the syntax, content and meaning of the values. The client has to\nbe coded to understand what the acceptable values, their allowable ranges,\netc.\nAn alternate would be to use your example #1 and use named query parameters\nwith the same value space (letters with a dash between). This requires the\nserver to support query terms, but that is really a trivial burden (some\nsort of mapping - path or query based - will always have to be done anyway)\nand generating query-based URIs is lighter weight than parsing XML and doing\na content based query.\n\n&gt;    And it might also choose to return further subindexes (e.g. aa-am)\n&gt;    thus varying the number of drill-down levels depending on the index\nsize.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t yet understood the REST principles enough to make a decision\nbetween\n&gt; a) and b) above (or yet something completely different?) and I would be\nvery\n&gt; thankful for help with this.\nGood example and good questions. What kind of data size do you expect to\nencounter? What kind of clients do you wish to interact with?\nBoth are fairly RESTful.\n\nConsider an alternate approach to exposing the map between a word and a list\nof documents.\nhttp://index.searchalert.net/documents/index?word=up\n\nThis might not fit your larger system, but what is interesting about this is\nthe potential to use POST on the same resource. You could POST a list of\ndocuments that have &#39;up&#39; in them - which make the index manager purely an\nindex manager and not a text parser. You could separate these two &#39;services&#39;\n(pieces of functionality) across the Web (assuming a bunch of other\nthings...)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
