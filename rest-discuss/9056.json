Pagaltzis&#39; &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt; [2007-06-15 23:15]:\n&gt; * Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; [2007-06-15 20:55]:\n&gt; &gt; For a great developers it is trivial, but for many smaller\n&gt; &gt; businesses or entrepreneurs w/o hotshot developers on staff\n&gt; &gt; it is not. So a company publishing a web API can either tell\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s potential users to follow the pure REST hypermedia\n&gt; &gt; model, or do URI construction. And if they do the former,\n&gt; &gt; they are likely to get a lot more people using it. Which\n&gt; &gt; would you chose? If you say hypermedia, I can tell we are\n&gt; &gt; discussing a hypothetical question and not one on which your\n&gt; &gt; livelihood depends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing as I’m primarily a Perl hacker, I’ll just point to\n&gt; WWW::Mechanize for this matter. Proof’s in eating the pudding.\n&gt; Doing hypermedia is very easy given tooling that abstracts the\n&gt; rote work. I’m basing this on actual experience, not\n&gt; hypothesis, much as you’d like to paint the REST proponents\n&gt; with the ivory tower brush.\n\nTo expand on this point: saying “it’s easy for great developers\nto write hypermedia clients” sounds to me like the following\nwould if the clock were turned back 15 years: “it’s easy for\ngreat developers to implement HTTP clients”.\n\nSo imagine the clock having turned forward a few years and then\nconsider the argument that hypermedia is hard to program to\nagain.\n\nI am not rolling over into a “tools will save us” stance here.\nThe great thing about HTTP is that while no one *needs* to\nimplement it from scratch to get work done, anyone who thinks\nthey must, *can*, because it’s simple enough to admit that\npossibility. Hypermedia has the same simplicity story; it’s\neasy to roll tooling for it and in due time the market will have\nconsolidate on Good Enough existing tooling so that people won’t\nhave to, much like people generally use Apache for their server\nand don’t have to think about it – although some do, and some\nwrite alternatives that manage to break into the market such a\nlighttpd. This is exactly what I expect to see in the future.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
