The \nspec  mentions 202 (Accepted) as an acceptable response; which would \nresult in a situation where a &#39;successful&#39; (2xx) DELETE will not \nnecessarily result in a subsequent GET returning 404.\n\nWith your proposed &#39;uniform&#39; DELETE pattern there is also a real \npossibility that some other agent somewhere will &#39;reinstate&#39; the \nresource in between the time it takes you to receive the DELETE response \nand reissue the subsequent GET - which, from the client&#39;s perspective, \nresults in the exact same behavior as the &#39;hack&#39; anyway. This is the \nreason I don&#39;t think that interpretation of DELETE gains you anything.\n\n- Mike\n\nAnt�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt; Let me rephrase:\n&gt;\n&gt; Having in the same app a situation where a DELETE causes a subsequent \n&gt; GET to return a 200 and a DELETE causing a subsequent GET returning a \n&gt; 404 breaks the uniform constraint. Because we are talking about two \n&gt; different operations here, the first DELETE isn&#39;t really deleting a \n&gt; resource, it&#39;s modifying it&#39;s state, so it&#39;s more of a hack. But hacks \n&gt; happen, I use them lot&#39;s of time...\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike Kelly wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Ant�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, if you have in the same application a DELETE that deletes a \n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource and not the URI and other DELETE that deletes both, then \n&gt;&gt;&gt; DELETE isn&#39;t uniform any more.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I disagree with that, because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s actually violating \n&gt;&gt; the DELETE specification.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you have self-descriptive messages and are leveraging HATEOAS \n&gt;&gt; there should be no issue mixing both approaches in one system.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
