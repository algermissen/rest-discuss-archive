Bowman wrote:\n&gt; It&#39;s much less RESTful if messaging is no longer se=\r\nlf-descriptive of\n&gt; sender intent.\n\nI agree with you here. PUT needs to hav=\r\ne clear, standard semantics or the message is no longer self-descriptive.\n\n=\r\n&gt; The sender&#39;s intent is not &quot;idempotency&quot;, it&#39;s either\n&gt; full or partial u=\r\npdate -- not both, so a method can&#39;t mean both.\n\nI disagree. POST can mean =\r\nthese, for example, and lots of other things too. Roy has written that GET =\r\nand POST are sufficient methods for a RESTful system (cf. the browser-based=\r\n HTML web)[1]. What&#39;s wrong with a hypothetical method whose semantics are =\r\n&quot;an idempotent partial update&quot; (where a partial update that happens to desc=\r\nribe everything can be used for a full update)? We&#39;ve established that PUT =\r\n(as defined in httpbis) is not that method.\n\nREST just requires that the in=\r\nterface be uniform--it doesn&#39;t actually say which methods need to be in the=\r\nre.\n\nIf I defined a protocol that was identical to HTTP but with another me=\r\nthod called IDEMPOTENTFULLORPARTIALUPDATE with those semantics, it wouldn&#39;t=\r\n be less RESTful than HTTP.\n\nI think the crux of the argument here is more =\r\nlike (with apologies to the Princess Bride): &quot;I do not think PUT means what=\r\n you think it means.&quot; \n\nIn fact, to quote Roy&#39;s blog (citation below):\n\n&quot;Sp=\r\necific method definitions (aside from the retrieval:resource duality of GET=\r\n) simply don=92t matter to the REST architectural style, so it is difficult=\r\n to have a style discussion about them. The only thing REST requires of met=\r\nhods is that they be uniformly defined for all resources (i.e., so that int=\r\nermediaries don=92t have to know the resource type in order to understand t=\r\nhe meaning of the request). As long as the method is being used according t=\r\no its own definition, REST doesn=92t have much to say about it.&quot;\n\nJon\n\n[1] =\r\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post\n\n"}}
