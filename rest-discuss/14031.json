Since that bulk of=\r\n folks doing REST today are using HTTP, the SPDY\n&gt; announcement out of Goog=\r\nle may be of interest.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Looking it over, it&#39;s not clear to me that from a REST point of view,\n&gt; SP=\r\nDY has that much too offer, and it has one really big potential\n&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; It seems that it&#39;s primary goal is to reduce latency through\n&gt; connectio=\r\nn multiplexing.\n&gt;\n&gt; While this is a concern for many Web sites, since they =\r\nare basically a\n&gt; page with several related resources (notably images, css,=\r\n and js\n&gt; files) that are all required to be available in order to provide =\r\nthe\n&gt; finished document to be displayed, I don&#39;t think that aspect will\n&gt; r=\r\neally affect MtoM (Machine to Machine, not to be confused with WS&#39;s\n&gt; MTOM)=\r\n transactions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most MtoM interactions tend to be, at the transaction le=\r\nvel,\n&gt; synchronous transactions, compared to what can be a largely\n&gt; asynch=\r\nronous exchange in the case of a web browser rendering a web\n&gt; page.\n&gt;\n&gt; On=\r\ne feature they advocate, that a REST system could well leverage, is\n&gt; Heade=\r\nr Compression. Currently, compression only affects the body of an\n&gt; HTTP re=\r\nquest, not the headers. And, particularly in the REST world\n&gt; where I think=\r\n headers are relied upon even more heavily, a &quot;simple\n&gt; request&quot; can be muc=\r\nh more than simply &quot;GET /resource&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Funny thing is, though, that REST o=\r\nver HTTP could have Header\n&gt; compression today between a compatible client =\r\nand server. It could\n&gt; simply, &quot;compress the headers&quot; in to a single X-Comp=\r\nressed-Header,\n&gt; with a base64 encoding, or some other contrivance. My poin=\r\nt being is\n&gt; that I think the header compression, should it be of value, ca=\r\nn be\n&gt; done with current clients and servers over HTTP. Clearly, not all of=\r\n\n&gt; the headers would be compressed, but a majority could be, and it can\n&gt; b=\r\ne made available through Con-neg. Mind, I&#39;ve put a whole 2 minutes\n&gt; thinki=\r\nng this through.\n&gt;\n&gt; The darkside of SPDY, is that it&#39;s all over SSL. Which=\r\n pretty much\n&gt; obliterates caching in the large, something I think many RES=\r\nT\n&gt; advocates hold dear. Clients could still cache, but that would be\n&gt; abo=\r\nut it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Granted, it&#39;s still young, they&#39;re just playing with this, and i=\r\nt may\n&gt; or may not gain any tractions whatsoever. But I thought it would be=\r\n\n&gt; interesting to take a quick look at it through REST colored glasses.\n&gt; A=\r\nt first glance, it&#39;s not clear that it would offer a whole lot to a\n&gt; REST =\r\nMtoM architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@... &lt;wi=\r\nllh%40mirthcorp.com&gt;)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0023545bd89c6f47ab0478336aa5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nThis blog entry curiously relates SPDY with Roy&#39;s WAKA...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/11/13/flip&quot;&gt;http://www.mnot.net/blog=\r\n/2009/11/13/flip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;_____________________________=\r\n_________________________&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Melhores cumprimentos / Beir beannacht /=\r\n Best regards&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ant=F3nio Manuel dos Santos Mota&lt;br&gt;__________________=\r\n____________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;=\r\n&gt;2009/11/12 Will Hartung &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:willh@mirt=\r\nhcorp.com&quot;&gt;willh@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail=\r\n_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt=\r\n 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-co=\r\nlor: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n   =\r\n   \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Since that bulk of folks doing REST today are using HTT=\r\nP, the SPDY&lt;br&gt;\nannouncement out of Google may be of interest.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLooking it over, it&=\r\n#39;s not clear to me that from a REST point of view,&lt;br&gt;\nSPDY has that muc=\r\nh too offer, and it has one really big potential&lt;br&gt;\nGotcha.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt se=\r\nems that it&#39;s primary goal is to reduce latency through&lt;br&gt;\nconnection =\r\nmultiplexing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhile this is a concern for many Web sites, since th=\r\ney are basically a&lt;br&gt;\npage with several related resources (notably images,=\r\n css, and js&lt;br&gt;\nfiles) that are all required to be available in order to p=\r\nrovide the&lt;br&gt;\nfinished document to be displayed, I don&#39;t think that as=\r\npect will&lt;br&gt;\nreally affect MtoM (Machine to Machine, not to be confused wi=\r\nth WS&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\nMTOM) transactions.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMost MtoM interactions tend to=\r\n be, at the transaction level,&lt;br&gt;\nsynchronous transactions, compared to wh=\r\nat can be a largely&lt;br&gt;\nasynchronous exchange in the case of a web browser =\r\nrendering a web&lt;br&gt;\npage.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne feature they advocate, that a REST s=\r\nystem could well leverage, is&lt;br&gt;\nHeader Compression.
