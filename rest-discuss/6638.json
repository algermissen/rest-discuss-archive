With\nPOST, the client only starts out knowing the identity of the processor and\nthe server will return the identifier of any newly created resource. \nThere are of course many other distinctions.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Scott Mohekey\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 03, 2006 6:52 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] PUT/POST Confusion\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been researching REST for some weeks now and have come \n&gt; across many different interpretations. In general, they all \n&gt; seem to agree on the definition of what GET and DELETE should \n&gt; do, however they can vary wildly in what the proper \n&gt; definition of PUT and POST are.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, in an effort to clarify this, I have a number of use \n&gt; cases that I&#39;d like to present, and hopefully generate some \n&gt; discussion as to how they would be implemented.\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly though, a description of the resources in the problem space:\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehicle: A vehicle has a set of data associated with it, \n&gt; typically license details, maintenance records etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; Fleet: A fleet is a collection of vehicles, it has a name and \n&gt; other similar properties. A single vehicle can be in more \n&gt; than one fleet.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tentatively mapped these in the url space as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; /vehicles/{fleet}/{vehicle}\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also an implicit All fleet that contains all of the vehicles.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now we have that out of the way, we come to the use cases:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Creating a fleet.\n&gt; 2. Modifying a fleet.\n&gt; 3. Creating a vehicle.\n&gt; 4. Modifying a vehicle.\n&gt; 5. Moving a vehicle from one fleet to another.\n&gt; \n&gt; My initial thoughts were that 1, and 3 should be handled via \n&gt; PUT, and 2, and 4 with POST. I have no idea how 5 would be \n&gt; handled, a POST?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help on this as I&#39;m \n&gt; totally confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
