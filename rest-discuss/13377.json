For doing the types of applications I&#39;m used to doing, \nAtom just got in the way.  It made more sense to leverage HTTP.\n\nEven with links within Atom, you end up screaming &quot;I just want the \nbleepin message!&quot;.  Yeah, sure you could have a framework that hides \nthat you&#39;re sending Atom around to make things easier for you, but that \nis an anti-pattern in and of itself.\n\nAlso, I didn&#39;t make this decision lightly.  For an analogy I was very \nskeptical of REST at first, the more I read about it the more I was \nconvinced it was the right approach for many things.  I&#39;ve had quite the \nopposite experience with Atom.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
