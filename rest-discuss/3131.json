So far, I just cannot see how\nthis\n&gt; &gt;could be enforced.  Between the moment that the PUT was completed and a\n&gt; &gt;subsequent GET was requested, the resource could have been updated (via\n&gt; &gt;PUTs, if you want) several times.  There is no mechanism in HTTP to\nperform\n&gt; &gt;a PUT-followed-by-GET as an atomic operation.  As a result, it seems that\n&gt; &gt;one should *ever* expect the representation sent with a PUT to be the\nsame\n&gt; &gt;as the representation retrieved with a GET, at least as a general rule.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand the previous sentence.  Is that *ever* or\n&gt; *never*.  I&#39;ll assume you meant *never*.\n\nYeah, that&#39;s what I meant. &lt;s&gt;\n\n&gt; I believe you&#39;re leaving out important parts of the statement.  I&#39;ll try\n&gt; to restate it here as I understand it:\n&gt;\n&gt; A GET operation that immediately follows a PUT operation must return\n&gt; exactly the representation presented by the PUT, _provided that the\n&gt; resource&#39;s state does not change between those two operations_.  Note\n&gt; that this statement is about the behavior of the server; it is not about\n&gt; behavior that an arbitraty client might be able to observe.\n\nBut if PUT means that the server maps the request-entity &quot;as is&quot; to the\nrequest-URI, then the only way that a resource state can change between\nthose two operations is via a client.  From what some are saying, the\n&quot;behaviour&quot; of the server for PUT will never cause a state change before the\nsubsequent GET (assuming no other external operations are performed in\nbetween). Am I wrong about this?\n\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve had this discussion here before (or maybe it was\n&gt; rest-expolore), but I can&#39;t suffer through Yahoo&#39;s UI to provide a\n&gt; reference.  (Try searching the August/September 2002 archives)\n\nperma-thread...\n\n&gt; If I remember correctly, this whole thing is not really about what you\n&gt; GET after a PUT.  It is more about whether or not you can do content\n&gt; negotiation/have variants on a PUT.  As I understand it, Fielding says\n&gt; you can&#39;t because there&#39;s no mechanism (in HTTP) to indicate whether the\n&gt; contents of the PUT is a variant of the current representation or a\n&gt; replacement for the current representation.  I seem to remember that the\n&gt; conversation wrapped up with an understanding that, in general,\n&gt; resources that support PUT cannot support content negotiation.\n\nI think you are talking about a different thread than I am.  I think there\nare very real examples of this problem without bringing content negotiation\nor variants into it.  I admit that&#39;s an issue, but a different one.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
