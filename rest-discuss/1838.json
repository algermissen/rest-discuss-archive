However, \nthe term\n&gt; &quot;thunk&quot; probably has as much precedent in lazy evaluation languages \nlike\n&gt; e.g. SASL.  In these languages, a thunk (alt. &quot;suspension&quot;) is a \npairing of\n&gt; a (possibly complex, nested) expression and an environment for which\n&gt; evaluation is deferred until it is needed / forced.  Sort of a \nparameterless\n&gt; closure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similar, and worth going back and digging around in the lazy eval \nlit...\n\nConsider also Elephant:\nhttp://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/elephant/node17.html\n\n\n"}}
