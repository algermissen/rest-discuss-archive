Fielding wrote:\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Yeah, Yaron&#39;s twisted little view of history.  It would be more  \n&gt; accurate to say\n&gt; that some people insisted HTTP could not carry internationalized data in\n&gt; header fields (which is blatantly false -- it is only inconveniently  \n&gt; encoded),\n&gt; and thus spawned an incredibly convoluted XML format for properties,  \n&gt; which\n&gt; later got boiled down to name-value pairs (like all metadata systems).   \n&gt; DASL\n&gt; got invented because an XML search interface was needed to deal with  \n&gt; the complex\n&gt; properties, but was later dropped due to lack of interest in a  \n&gt; half-assed\n&gt; variation of what the real database people were working on with XQuery.\n\nOK, another interesting read is in Jim Whitehead&#39;s and Yaron Goland&#39;s \n&quot;The WebDAV Property Design&quot; \n&quot;&lt;http://www.cs.ucsc.edu/~ejw/papers/spe-whitehead.pdf&gt;.\n\nI came to WebDAV only in early 2001 (when all design decisions were \nalready made and DeltaV was nearing completion). However, I do agree \nwith some of the points made about using HTTP headers for properties, in \nparticular:\n\nHTTP header values can use non-ASCII characters (RFC2231), but the \nheader names itself can&#39;t (or am I missing something)? So if it is a \nrequirement that property *names* can use arbitrary characters, they \ncan&#39;t be mapped to header names.\n\nIt would be an interesting exercise to define a new request header for \nGET/HEAD that would basically transport PROPFIND (depth=0) information \nin headers. Anybody interested?\n\n&gt; The issue of identification started because of a really bad paper tiger  \n&gt; design\n&gt; for munging URIs that was proposed by someone else, rejected, and then  \n&gt; replaced\n&gt; by me during a meeting at Xerox PARC with the imagemap-style URI  \n&gt; provided\n&gt; by the server.  Larry did not object to that style of munging.  The  \n&gt; design was\n&gt; not used by WebDAV because the editors chose not to for some unknown  \n&gt; reason,\n&gt; not because there was any objection from the working group (on the  \n&gt; contrary,\n&gt; both Henrik and I objected to the extra methods).  All of that nonsense\n\nI&#39;d really like to see that proposal, however I haven&#39;t been able to \nfind it in the mailing list archives so far. Unfortunately, the other \narchive that&#39;s supposed to have it \n(&lt;http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/&gt;) seems to be \nmisconfigured/down right down.\n\n&gt; about extra round-trips is just bullshit invented by Yaron --  \n&gt; Microsoft&#39;s own\n&gt; implementations had no such concern for round-trips and actually made  \n&gt; two\n&gt; unnecessary requests prior to each WebDAV resource action just to check  \n&gt; if it\n&gt; was actually WebDAV-enabled.\n&gt; \n&gt; WebDAV is stuck with that design because we let Microsoft dominate the\n&gt; working group as the only significant implementation.  Apache&#39;s mod_dav\n&gt; didn&#39;t come along until much later.  Henrik&#39;s implementation in libwww,\n&gt; completed during the HTTP/1.1 design, was ignored because it didn&#39;t use  \n&gt; XML.\n\nAlthough I&#39;m not happy with many parts of the WebDAV design, there \ndoesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of competition, probably because it&#39;s &quot;good \nenough&quot;. However, that doesn&#39;t mean that it wouldn&#39;t be a good thing to \nactually document an alternate design -- maybe it could get traction \noutside the Microsoft world (such as Apache/mod_dav and Apache Slide).\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n-- \n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n"}}
