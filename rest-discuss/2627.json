I&#39;m also left wondering: if \nsubsequent \n&gt; &gt; DELETEs after an initial DELETE can return 200, does would imply \nthat\n&gt; &gt; GET/HEAD should return 200/204 with an empty entity-body too?  \nPerhaps\n&gt; &gt; you could include that in your model also?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll include it if I understand it well enough. ;-)  So you&#39;re \nsaying\n&gt; that if the nth DELETE of some resource (with no intervening \noperations\n&gt; that could restore representation mapping) can return 200 (i.e., &quot;OK\n&gt; it&#39;s not mapped&quot;), then should a GET at this point (again, no \nintervening\n&gt; operations to change state) also return 200 (i.e., &quot;OK, the resource\n&gt; is here because resources always exist) with an empty entity-body \n(i.e.,\n&gt; &quot;just because it exists doesn&#39;t mean it maps to any \nrepresentations&quot;)?\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a different kind of modeling problem, and I&#39;m not sure \nmodeling\n&gt; will clarify anything.  I believe the rule is that 404 means no\n&gt; representation was found, while it&#39;s implicit that any resource that\n&gt; ever existed still does.\n&gt;\n\nAgreed there.  The problem with DELETE does not apply for GET.\n\nWhile RFC 2616 says that &quot;the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical \nrequests is the same as for a single request&quot;, this is not the case \nwith DELETE, regardless of response codes, unless the representation \nbeing deleted never existed (In which you can always return a 404 - \nwhile not stated explicitly as legal in the spec in regards to \nDELETE, it seems to be implied from other areas).\n\nOn the first DELETE, there is a side-effect - a representation is un-\nmapped.  On the second and subsequent DELETEs, there is no \nrepresentation to un-map, so the side effect /cannot/ take place.  It \nseems impossible to me to maintain idempotence across requests 1 and \n2 with DELETE, and impossible not to (as far as effects on the server \ngo) on all requests &gt; 1.\n\nThe problem with trying to prove that always (for requests &gt; 0)\nreturning a 200 (duh) OK/202/204 response would break a client is \nthat the spec also states that it is not guaranteed that the intended \nside-effect actually occurred (perhaps supervisor authorisation must \nfirst be granted, for instance).  To return a 404 is guaranteeing \nthat the side-effect did not take place; to return a 20X response is \nmore in keeping with the spec where no guarantees are given.  However \nin the 20X case the client can never be sure the request was \nactioned, and your dream of a consistent interface flies out the \nwindow.\n\nImagine if dialog boxes had &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Maybe&quot; buttons...\n\nAs a client, I&#39;d like to see a 404 telling my I&#39;m stupid for trying \nto delete something that didn&#39;t exist.  At least then I can check for \ntypos.  In which case, 2616 would have to be subject to a minor \nalteration:\n\n&quot;the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is the same as for a \nsingle request [ except in the case of DELETE, where N &gt; 1 ]&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
