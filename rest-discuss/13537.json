The client sends a\nrequest body containing all the information about what actions to\nperform on which resources, and the server responds.\n\nThe OFX data type, application/ofx, is THE existing xml format for\nfinancial data. I would not wish to create an entirely new mime type\nthat does the same thing. Talk about reinventing wheels.\n\nIs anyone doing any work to make this more RESTful?\n\nExamples of the kind of things I mean:\n\n* making the resources (bank accounts, transfers, etc) addressable with URIs\n* use http verbs. GET to get an account, POST to create a new\ntransfer, PUT to modify something, DELETE.. We all know the drill\n* extend the schema of application/ofx to contain hyperlinks\n* replace ofx&#39;s authentication model, which puts the authentication\ninfo in the request body, with http basic or digest\n\nOf course the question does arise of what benefit could come from\nthis, since ofx has been going fine for years without being RESTful. I\nthink the &quot;business case for REST&quot; thread that we had on here has a\nlot to say.\n\n-- \nSent from my mobile device\n\n"}}
