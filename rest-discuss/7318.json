You would need an xforms processor on the client that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed code to tweak form controls and submit the form through an\n&gt; API.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So instead of publishing URIs (or URI templates) and schemas in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; description of your resources/service you embed forms in the resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; content.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yep. No WSDL needed. Schemas for the XML documents you plan to\n&gt; &gt; exchange: you do need some shared understanding of the meanings of\n&gt; &gt; elements. But no, you don&#39;t need to declare that a certain URI accepts\n&gt; &gt; POST of documents of a certain type. The application itself will tell\n&gt; &gt; you what to POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find this idea very intriguing and it has been slushing around my\n&gt; mind for a few weeks.  It&#39;s simple to imagine a form with a few fields\n&gt; that either need to be filled out or selected.  But what about\n&gt; services that support submissions of variable length (i.e. multiple\n&gt; records).  How would the form express that?\n\nThere&#39;s a constraint language in Xforms that I won&#39;t pretend to  be fluent in:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice2.html#concepts-model\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, I can see how the form can be generated from the\n&gt; schema (modulo input field descriptions), but I&#39;m not sure how to\n&gt; infer the complete schema from a form.  Are there examples of this?\n&gt;\n\nUnsure I&#39;m understanding you: Why would you want to infer a complete\nschema from a form?\n\n&gt; While I&#39;m at it, has someone already created a RelaxNG-to-Form\n&gt; converter?  I have it currently on my drawing board for our Dream\n&gt; service infrastructure.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; - Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
