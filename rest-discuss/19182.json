API authorization is a different step.\n&gt; \n&gt; AFAIK you MAY NOT send multiple challenges back to the server.\n\nI think you might be missing the greater point I was trying to make,\nwhich were that an existing mechanism already exist (RFC 2617):\n\n&gt;     The WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers exist for this very\n&gt;     purpose. In fact, RFC 2617 is designed to be extensible.\n\nIn fact, is this very extensibility that OAuth is built upon. OAuth\nmight not be ideal for your particular purpose, but RFC 2617 still\nexists to build upon to quite possibly do what you want.\n\nIt&#39;s possible to build an RFC 2617 auth method that could potentially\nbundle multiple challenges in a single aggregate challenge. Including\nmultiple &#39;WWW-Authenticate&#39; and &#39;Authorization&#39; headers is another\nmatter, however.\n\nWithout knowing more about how your system&#39;s access management\nrequirements, it&#39;s hard to speculate further. I think it would be more\nvaluable to propose an auth method built on top of RFC 2617 to support\nyour requirements rather than a whole new header.\n\n-- \nC�at � G�ibhtheach�in - k@... - http://stereochro.me/ - CF9F6473\nThere are 10^11 stars in the galaxy.
