The product page should be the same for all users, but the shopping cart should be individual for each user. But if the page is the same for all users, it cannot contain an individual URI for the user&#39;s shopping cart!\n\nWhy do you want the page to be the same for all users? Caching?\n\nHere is what you could do:\n\nLink to /cart from the product page and redirect /cart to /cart/tom for user Tom based on Authorization header.\n\n\nGET /cart\nAuthorization: Thomas Magnum\n\n307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: /cart/tom\n\n\n\nEven better: use client side storage (even if it is cookie-based) to store user state (the cart).\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; My idea is to store the cart URI in a cookie and request the cart form the server with content of that cookie. The process looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Client: GET /product\n&gt; 2. Server: Ok, product page\n&gt; 3. Client: POST /cart (requested with JavaScript)\n&gt; 4. Server: Created, Location: /cart/93a41fe545b, set_cookie: /cart/93a41fe545b\n&gt; \n&gt; ... on the next page:\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Client: GET /another_product\n&gt; 6. Server: Ok, another product page\n&gt; 7. Client: GET /cart/93a41fe545b (requested with JavaScript after reading the cookie)\n&gt; 8. Server: Ok, user&#39;s shopping cart\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe the actual creation of the shopping cart can be deferred until the first item is placed into the cart, but that is not important for my example. Important is the mechanism to store the cart URI in a cookie and request and display the cart with JavaScript.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a way to do something similar without JavaScript?\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think of this approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another idea: \n&gt; \n&gt; Since this kind of shopping cart could be shared between users (e. g. configure a computer for someone else and send the URI of the cart) it would make sense, to make shopping carts immutable. If the cart is modified, the user gets a new cart URI, so that all previous versions would still be available. The obvious shortcoming is that many carts will be stored over time ... But disk space is cheap and old, unused carts could be removed after a while.
