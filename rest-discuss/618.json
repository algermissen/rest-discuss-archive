It says\n&gt; only that the resource is now out-of-date.  The\n&gt; server may or may not know how to resolve the\n&gt; situation (e.g. it may retrieve the URL or it may\n&gt; tell someone else to deal with it)\n&gt;\n&gt; Either way telling the server that a resource is\n&gt; out-of-date is very different from using POST\n&gt; or PUT to change it.\n\nThat is exactly right.  A notification is not a way of pushing resources from\nsource to sink.  Anything that is about pushing resources from source to sink is\nan update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
