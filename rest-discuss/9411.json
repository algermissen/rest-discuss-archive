What is\n&gt; wrong with one DELETE resulting in the resource being removed and\n&gt; responding 410 Gone? No added semantics involved, no If-Match\n&gt; required, so easy anyone can do it, nobody but me needs to know\n&gt; about the second DELETE as it is administrative in nature.\n\nSorry, I must have missed an update. I read, in your message from 02\nJul 2007 11:49:46:\n\n&gt; If the filesize is greater than zero bytes and the DELETE is\n&gt; unconditional, the response is 409 Conflict with a message body\n&gt; “Unconditional DELETE request detected.”\n\nWhich indicated to me that if the client tries to DELETE a resource\nwithout supplying the If-Match header, the DELETE will fail.\n\n&gt; I refuse to consider most of the &quot;bad reactions&quot; that have come\n&gt; about here, as they either quote a section of RFC 2616 without\n&gt; explaining just what the problem is they&#39;re seeing, or frame their\n&gt; objections in terms of some other example like a trashcan.\n\nIf you don’t like the trashcan example you should not have brought it\nup. But I think we can consider it withdrawn.\n\n&gt; The only time I will change what I am doing due to a &quot;bad reaction&quot;\n&gt; here is if the objection makes sense, not because there&#39;s a standard\n&gt; kneejerk objection here to anyone doing anything different.\n\n&gt; The only &quot;is it worth all the trouble&quot; question I ask myself,\n&gt; pertains to posting my ideas to this list, because the helpful\n&gt; responses tend to be few and far between, with lots of people\n&gt; assuming I must be wrong because a lot of other people assume I\n&gt; am wrong and start insisting that maybe that&#39;s a valid reason to\n&gt; not do what I am doing.  The only result of this is that when it\n&gt; comes to REST, I will prefer to keep my own counsel.\n\nIf you feel that you have addressed people’s objections, then you have\ndone more than most in terms of contributing to the process of\ninteroperability.\n\nbest,\nErik Hetzner\n;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Jul_10_12:26:24_2007-1\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Jul_10_12:26:24_2007-1--\r\n\n"}}
