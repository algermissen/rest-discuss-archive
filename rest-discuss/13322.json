I am trying to understand how to do real\n&gt; REST as opposed to HTTP RPC.\n&gt;\n\nGood for you!  Please allow me to indoctrinate you into the cult...\n;-)\n\nREST is the only Uniform Interface defined for distributed hypermedia\napplications.  REST is a unique hybrid of network and application\narchitectural principles with a firm grounding in Computer Science,\nwhereas WS-* ignores the principles of network architecture and has a\nfirm grounding in corporate profit-seeking.\n\nIn Computer Science, a Uniform Interface is one that is generic (see\nPrinciple of Generality), thus re-usable between applications.  SQL\ndefines a Uniform Interface for DBMSs.  REST defines a Uniform Interface\nfor distributed hypermedia applications.  Applying the constraints of\nREST to interactions between components (clients, servers, caches etc.)\nin such an application, results in a Uniform Interface, the primary\nbenefit being scalability.  Not that other benefits like serendipitous\nre-use are to be taken lightly...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This characteristic of Uniform Interface\n&gt; seems to be the main issue. WHat makes an interface Uniform? In\n&gt; wikipedia it says that one of the conditions is that the message is\n&gt; self-descriptive, somehow the client will know what to do with a\n&gt; response based on the mime media-type that describes the response.\n&gt; Is that all? \n&gt;\n\nNope.  Unless it&#39;s been dramatically edited recently, the Wikipedia REST\npage doesn&#39;t get much respect on rest-discuss because it&#39;s a WS-*-\ncentric POV.  Nothing more confusing, IMHO, than trying to discuss\nREST in terms of WS-*.  Anyway, headers (not just Content-Type),\nrequest methods and status codes, are what make HTTP messages self-\ndescriptive.  Bear in mind that FTP messages are also self-descriptive,\nas REST is a protocol-neutral design pattern.\n\nThe terminology can be a bit confusing, as the Uniform Interface itself\nis considered a constraint in REST, applied on top of the constraints\nimposed by the architecture of the Web itself -- the culmination of\nwhich is expressed as the client-cache-stateless-server constraint.\n\nThe Uniform Interface constraint is the culmination of four other\nconstraints:  identification of resources; manipulation of resources\nthrough representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as\nthe engine of application state.\n\nSo the challenge in applying REST to any problem area, is to model it\nas a distributed hypermedia application -- a collection of resources\nlinked together through hypermedia representations.  Once that&#39;s\naccomplished, apply REST&#39;s Uniform Interface constraints to the\ninteractions between components transferring and manipulating those\nrepresentations.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
