They say, &quot;Hey \n&gt; Alan, where do you find your April statement on this site?&quot;  So you \n&gt; bookmark that page and send the URL to them.

His\ncredentials would also work to access the account of interest. Both alan\nand his friend can then bookmark that page and return to it as often as\nthey like.\n\n&gt; Now, one might argue that they could find their own statement by \n&gt; replacing &quot;alan.dean&quot; with their name.  But this person isn&#39;t bright \n&gt; enough to manipulate URLs.\n\nURL manipulation sometimes works, but it is best to do based on a form\nprovided by the server that owns the URLs in question.\n\n&gt; How do you handle this?  Perhaps \n&gt; http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/ would take them to a page \n&gt; which let them type in their authentication info, and redirect them to \n&gt; their personal page.\n&gt; But suppose you weren&#39;t savvy enough to know that.  Maybe there might be \n&gt; a link on your personal page to the generic page, which says &quot;send this \n&gt; link to a friend&quot;?\n\nChances are that if you are sending this link to a friend you mean for\nthem to see your statement rather than theirs. You would generally send\na link to the page you are pointing at only when you want your friend to\nsee that page. If you want them to see the generic page, that is the\npage you send them a link for.\n\nEither way, there should be a link to the generic page on your own page.\nHopefully one or the other of you will be able to figure out what to do\nwith it. It is also valid to deny alan&#39;s friend access to alan&#39;s page\nwith a useful error page. This error page could (and should) indicate to\nthe user what they have to do in order to authenticate themselves\ncorrectly, and direct them back to a generic page if they are unable to\ncomply with the direction.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
