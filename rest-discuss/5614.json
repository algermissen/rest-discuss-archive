The value in an application is being able to interact\n&gt;&gt;with it, not merely to act upon it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Umm....IMHO the value of an application is (in the EA context) that  \n&gt; it provides the required information at the time it is needed. I  \n&gt; think that the most promising approach to this is in terms of state  \n&gt; holding objects (abstractions of the &#39;dumb data&#39;) and a uniform  \n&gt; interface for manipulating that state on the one hand and on the  \n&gt; other hand business rules (constraints on the state of these objects).\n\nRESTful systems seem to me at times to treat non-dumb data as dumb, by \ngiving us the same view on something that is dynamically reacting to \nmany factors (whether those factors relate to the client&#39;s actions \nand/or something else). API-like systems treat dumb data as non-dumb by \nmaking everyone &quot;interact&quot; with it even if it isn&#39;t interactive.\n\nDumb data is easier to work with, so I prefer the former to the latter.\n\nAll data is dumb really, (&quot;Relax, it&#39;s only 1s and 0s&quot;).\n\n"}}
