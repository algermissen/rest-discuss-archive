There&#39;s no denying the value in that.\n\nThere are two aspects to what Jon Udell did that make it work - parsing a\nURI and having two services share a common value space.\nThe sharing a common value space part hasn&#39;t been discussed much, but I\nthink it is an important piece of building network based applications across\norganizational boundaries.\n\nIn my experience, developers tend to expose internal keys of whatever\ndatabase they are using for their application. This is because it makes\nsense for the local application and is fast. If you have a URI of\nhttp://localhost/viewstory.jsp?storyId=777 then parsing integers and using\nintegers for primary keys is fast and keeps the db tables small.\nBut if you have another &#39;key&#39; that could possibly be used - like SSN, ISBN,\nzip code, etc. - this would help integrate with other systems that also use\nor understand those types of values. Storing long textual values as a\nprimary key might be a practice avoided by db designers, but when looking at\nthe larger scope of the system (outside a single server or department) it\nmight bring more benefits. There also might be implementation tricks that\nminimize the performance and storage problems of large primary keys.\n\nThese are just some rough thoughts I&#39;ve had for a while & the Library Lookup\nbookmarklet makes a great discussion point.\n\n\n\n"}}
