The server will act as if the resource is an instance of that \n&gt; content-type (even if its internal-representation/storage-model is \n&gt; different).  Therefore a change of content-type in response to another \n&gt; raw-GET or raw-HEAD implies a change of state not simply a change in the \n&gt; representation of that state.\n\nrfc2616 states that a post can be used to add comments to a document\n(e.g.). So the &quot;raw get&quot; retrun an html document, which can accept ...\nsay xml+xlink anotea-like comments... it&#39;s not the same content-type...\nhow can you assume that? because in a wiki-like system, a post of html\nto http://host/doc.html#section can mean that I want to add a paragraph\nto this section... or any other example where you post to a &quot;html&quot;\ndocument...\n\n&gt; 3. If it is meaningful for another content-type to be a subordinate of the \n&gt; resource&#39;s content-type, the server will not return 413 in response to a \n&gt; POST of that content-type to that URI AND if the server returns 200, it \n&gt; will in fact make the POSTed entity of the resource in the manner implied \n&gt; by the content-type.  Since image/jpeg and application/xml do not provide a \n&gt; meaning for another entity to be subordinate, the server may return either \n&gt; 413 or 405 in response to a POST to that resource.\n\nFor me, it is meaningful to post EXIF metadata to a image/jpeg. It&#39;s\njuste an example of the fact that you (the client or the server) can&#39;t\npresume of what can be meaningful in a post for the other side of the\napplication. If I make a system that *in a &quot;row get&quot;* return image/jpeg,\nand allow a POST of metadat (exif of other similar system), And if I\ndon&#39;t give you additional doc, you&#39;ll never use this functionality,\nsimply assuming that you can&#39;t POST to a image/jpeg ?? Meatadata are\n&quot;subordinate&quot; to the image, at least in my interpretation of what\n&quot;subordinate&quot; means), so I can POST them to an image if the system\nallows it...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
