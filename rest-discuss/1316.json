This could return a PO XML\n&gt; instance with the parts and amounts left blank, but the whole XML\n&gt; structure present. Then the user could fill in the amounts and parts\n&gt; required and do a POST to the orders URI. This way if the service\n&gt; provider needs to change the PO format in a minor way, the chance of\n&gt; affecting the users is less because for each transaction the user\n&gt; begins by doing a GET on the blank PO URI. And if the user is clever\n&gt; they will add their details to the blank order in a way that won&#39;t be\n&gt; affected by such minor changes (for example if an extra element is\n&gt; added). (This is my personal interpretation of Walter&#39;s\n&gt; mysterious &quot;start with the output&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; What does everyone think?\n&gt;\nI&#39;d like to hear what Walter said - but a &#39;template&#39; approach might be\ninteresting.\nLet&#39;s say we did that - how would the (automated) client know what parts of\nthe template to modify?\nIf we had XML, we could use XPath or something. Then the XML could change as\nlong as the XPath used didn&#39;t need to change.\nThen the client and server would be coordinating based on the list of XPath\nstatements.\nSo the client would know about the data to write via a set of hardcoded\ntext - which you could just send to the server directly as name-value pairs.\n\nI&#39;d like to hear more of how this would work... I&#39;m somewhat tangled up in\nthe world of PO/PO-ACK/etc. right now, so this is interesting to me.\n\n\n\n"}}
