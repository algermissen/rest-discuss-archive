Now, when someone clicks one of the results, I&#39;d like to put into the page &#39;next&#39; and &#39;prev&#39; links (similar to what you have in bugzilla for example).\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, one (bad) way of doing this, is keeping a state in the server that says the user is doing a search, and render the page with the links according to that state. This is bad because the user my get to the page in other ways (bookmarks, search something else and go back etc.), which will mean the &#39;back&#39; and &#39;prev&#39; links may be corrupted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another way is to make the links to the search results contain the fact that they originated from a search, with all search query data (maybe encoded in some way, e.g., serialized).\n&gt;\n&gt; This means two things: (a) the url to the resource contains data outside of the scope of the resource, (b) the returned representation contains information that is not part of the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it OK to say that the search result contains urls which are not the resources themselves, but &quot;meta resources&quot; that wrap the real resource and add information?:\n\nI&#39;m having a hard time seeing why you would not just use either of the\nfollowing for a simple term search, such as &#39;rest&#39;:\n\nhttp://example.com?q=rest  ... google style\nor\nhttp://example.com/search/rest ... delicious style\n\nfor pagination:\n\nhttp://example.com?q=rest&page=1\nor\nhttp://example.com/search/rest/page/1\nor\nhttp://example.com/search/rest?page=1\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
