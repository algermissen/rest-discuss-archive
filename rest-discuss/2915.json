It&#39;s like that old saying:  the great thing about facts is \nthat it doesn&#39;t matter if anybody believes them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if \n99.9999% of the industry fails to understand REST (today);  it doesn&#39;t \nmatter if Dave Winer ever gets a clue, or if the press fans this \n&quot;debate&quot; into such a hypestorm that everybody gets sick of it.\n\nREST is hype-proof.  It&#39;s idiot-proof.  It&#39;s debate-free.  REST is \nabout the things that made the Web successful;  loose coupling, naming, \ngeneric interfaces, etc.  You can&#39;t argue with the Web!  If you do, you \njust end up sounding stupid, like our buddy Dave.\n\nYou can&#39;t treat the Internet like a LAN.  You can&#39;t pretend open worlds \nare like closed worlds.  Tight coupling isn&#39;t the same as loose \ncoupling.  Coordination and composition doesn&#39;t work the same way in \nthe wild.  That beautiful hothouse flower is gonna get clobbered by the \nkudzu if you plant it out in the yard.\n\nOur industry has made several runs at this wall, and failed to get over \nit every time;  eventually, people will get it --- the key to learning \nis repetition.  Until then, those who didn&#39;t learn any any of the past \n{ ONC RPC, DCE, CORBA, DCOM, RMI } attempts will just keep repeating \nhistory...\n\nThe only net effect of this is that eventually, when people finally \n*get* this thing, some of us will be justified in feeling, maybe just a \nlittle bit, smug. :-)\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
