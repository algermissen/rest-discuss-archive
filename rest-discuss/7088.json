This seems like it would be a very common problem when working with \n&gt; REST.  \n\n(&quot;Hmm&quot;?)\n\nNo it&#39;s not - it&#39;s a very common problem dealing with deployed HTTP \ntechnology. If a design/spec says use uniform methods, and people who \nimplement it ignore it, that&#39;s not a design problem.\n\n\n&gt; It also seems that among the recommended solutions that the \n&gt; selection of one vs. another would be someone arbitrary.  \n\nThat&#39;s correct.\n\n&gt; Is there a \n&gt; reason not to look at the pros and cons for solutions to this (and \n&gt; other) use-cases and decide on and document (on the REST-wiki?) a \n&gt; recommended Best Practice so that most people can chose the same \n&gt; arbitrary solution?  \n\nNot really. The best practice is to fix code that subsets HTTP. HTTP \nitself is the least arbitrary solution.\n\n&gt; After all, if one of the benefits of REST is \n&gt; compatibility, wouldn&#39;t getting people to decide on a the same arbitrary \n&gt; solution increase potential compatibility down the line?\n&gt;  \n&gt; (he says bracing for the firestorm he expects... ;-)\n\nNo firestorm - tho&#39; you&#39;re using REST interchangeably with HTTP \ninterchangeably with deployed HTTP systems. I&#39;ll assume that&#39;s not a \ndeliberate debating tactic unless I keep seeing you do it.\n\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/WhatIsARESTafarian.aspx\n\nfrom where I&#39;m standing people are doing their level best here to answer \nyour questions. That doesn&#39;t help, at all.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
