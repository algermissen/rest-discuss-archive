The price of double or triple or quadruple dereferencing a file name\n&gt; &gt; is cheap compared to the price of parsing markup in a file system.\n&gt; &gt; Whereas the price of parsing markup is trivial on the web compared to\n&gt; &gt; the price of following one redirect to another redirect to another\n&gt; &gt; redirect etc. Better to plan for the need to move things in advance by\n&gt; &gt; &quot;indirecting&quot; through markup.\n&gt;\n&gt; This I buy.\n\nActually, on second thought, I don&#39;t buy this argument --- at least not as an\nargument about opacity.  Both the Web and certain modern distributed\nfilesystems can handle movement of resources to nonlocal environments through\nredirection;  the 3xx HTTP codes have analogs in SMB, in NFS+autofs\nenvironments, and elsewhere.  The ability to redirect through markup is unique\nto the Web, but it is a decidedly *unRESTful* and HTTP-unfriendly concept.\nConsider:\n\nOne of the original goals of the Web was to be generally agnostic about the\ncontent that it transported.  We&#39;ve moved away from that, and that&#39;s perhaps a\nbad thing.  Where the abstractions-of-interest in REST / HTTP are resources\nand their associated coordination language, the abstractions-of-interest in\nthe Semantic Web are hypertext topologies and metadata.  Whereas the REST\npurist way to handle relocation of resources is (correctly, IMO) through the\n3xx codes, a markup-based mechanism requires that any client understand the\nmarkup language and redirect conventions.\n\nAnyway, this is another red herring --- neither an argument for opacity nor an\nadvantage of the Web over other distributed filesystems.  The point of this\nendeavor isn&#39;t to claim that distributed filesystems are in some sense\nsuperior to the Web or what have you;  it&#39;s rather to debug some incorrect\nassumptions and assertions that are generally made in support of opacity.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
