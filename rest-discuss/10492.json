That is, applications running on the grid can onl=\r\ny \ndo things like &quot;get&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, and &quot;take&quot; in order to interact \nw=\r\nith the grid and the other applications running there.  So, \nconsidering th=\r\nis framework, do these data grids constitute an \nimplementation  of REST?  =\r\nIf I build my applications on top of a data \ngrid, will I have a RESTful ar=\r\nchitecture?\n\nThanks,\nTom\n\n\n"}}
