Session requires the server to keep state that is created out of band\n(your session id). You may well breach the self-descriptive message if the\nsession needs to be known by the server in advance.\n2. to get a session, you have a process by which you pre-define a web page\nor a URI a server has to go to, which will have to be different for each\nsite. You&#39;re not designing for serendipity and reuse, but for your specific\nsite, locking users in your authentication method. \n3. Authentication information is not part of the resource state, and\nembedding it in the resource is, from my perspective, a dangerous ride. I&#39;d\nfind very hard to describe how a username and password, or session id, is a\npartial state transfer of a resource Blog or Customer. So you may breach the\nintended definition of a representation of a resource.\n\n\nSeb\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of object01\nSent: 11 June 2009 18:42\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] RESTful vs. unRESTful: session IDs and\nauthenticaiton\n\nI&#39;m trying to develop a solid understanding of the principles behind REST,\nand I&#39;m wrestling with what seems like a big inconsistency.  I have a\nfeeling there&#39;s a mismatch between my semantics and the community&#39;s.\n\nI&#39;ve seen it said over and over again that passing session IDs (typically in\na cookie) is generally considered unRESTful.  I&#39;ve also seen it said over\nand over again that passing credentials along with every request is\nconsidered very RESTful.\n\nThe reasonings are unclear to me, though.  Considering the &quot;statelessness&quot;\nprinciple of REST, if I think of a RESTful architecture as one in which\nevery request passes all the information needed for the server to fulfill\nthe request, then I don&#39;t see how passing session IDs (for instance) in\nrequests violates that principle.\n\nTo me, a session ID is a simple alphanumeric string.  Authentication\ncredentials are (typically expressed as) a simple alphanumeric string.  Both\nstrings persist on the client.  Both strings are received by the server and\nare compared to information held on the server in order to make decisions on\nthe server about how to process the request, and thus the content of the\nstrings can dramatically affect the server&#39;s response to the request.\n\nWhen approached from this way, I lose the meaning behind the distinction.\nWhat am I misunderstanding?\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
