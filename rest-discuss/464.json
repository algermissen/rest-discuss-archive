For example, a watch request\nneeds to express the request to watch, a store-and-forward request needs to\nenclose the request to store-and-forward within a request to perform the\nstore-and-forward, an update request needs to state the parameters of the\ncallback POST request.\n\nThis creates a couple problems.  One, enclosed requests are objects rather than\nstreams, so are inconsistent with persistent connections.  Two, there are\nproblems with opacity, since intermediaries have practical reasons to need to do\nsome rewriting, and since the two requests may be mixed in together.  For\nexample a store-and-forward CGI needs to rewrite the Host: header to a Via:\nheader, or even rewrite the target URI to change to host.\n\nAn example of how tricky this gets is accept headers in a store-and-forward\nchain: the originating host may accept a type that an intermediary doesn&#39;t.\nStreaming audio, for example.\n\nThere may always be clever ways to avoid having to solve the RIR problem, I\ndon&#39;t know.  This post is just to recognize that it exists, since that sometimes\nhelps break through on an issue.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
