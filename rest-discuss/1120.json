Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; my initial concern about\n&gt; whether all parties would have the full URI or whether they would \nhave only\n&gt; a &#39;short name&#39; isn&#39;t all that worrisome. If the publisher of a \nproduct\n&gt; exposes the &#39;short name&#39;, then they could just as easily expose the \nfull uri\n&gt; (but if we can&#39;t get them to expose the full uri, what are we to \ndo?).\n&gt; \n&gt; The associations between resources still cause a well-known name to \nbe\n&gt; used - but it is truly a name like &#39;availability&#39; and not a value \nlike\n&gt; &#39;blueshoes&#39;.\n\nThe most common way for companies that engage in B2B electronic \ncommerce to communicate product information is by publishing a \ncatalog.  It&#39;s common for customers to subscribe to the catalog and \nget periodic updates.  The catalog will have URIs for each product.\n\nI expect something like &#39;Business Protocols&quot; to become available soon.\n\nBy &quot;Business Protocols&quot;, I mean the scripts for getting catalogs, \navailability, ordering, claims, delivery and payment notifications, \nwarranty service, etc.\n\nMany of those protocols will become available from libraries from \nstandards groups and industry and trade associations.  So &quot;Business \nProtocols&quot; might be a reference or a list of references to the common \nprotocols a company can handle.\n\nSo the first thing to do when you want to do business with a new \ntrading partner is to get their business protocols.\n\nThere is a catalog of common business processes here:\nhttp://www.ebxml.org/specs/bpPROC.pdf \n\nIt contains categorized lists of business processes from EDI, \nRosettaNet, OAG, etc.  Not much detail, just lists.\n\nWork is continuing on this catalog - adding more groups, including \ninternational trade processes.  Executable international trade \nprotocols will open the gates for many people who cannot engage in \ntrade now because of the difficulties of the processes.\n\nScripts for executable business processes are being developed in \nUN/CEFACT and ISO and several other organizations.  For the most \npart, the scripts assume something like the EDI-mailbox Web service \npattern.  However, both UN/CEFACT and ISO are trying to be technology-\nindependent, and so their process models should be able to be \nimplemented in REST, at least via some twists.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
