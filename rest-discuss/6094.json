The request is \n&gt; a resource. The URI of this new resource may be\n&gt;\n&gt;   sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId/requestId\n&gt;\n&gt; The following verbs on these may be supported:\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET returns the request status: in progress, cancelled, completed, \n&gt; result code\n&gt;\n&gt;   PUT may be used to modify the executing request: change the status to \n&gt; cancel.\n&gt;\n&gt;   DELETE would delete old requests not required anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure if this is &quot;tirï¿½ par les cheveux&quot; (hum... &quot;pulled by the \n&gt; hair&quot;, a common expression in French Canadian ;), i.e. I do not know if \n&gt; this is extending REST / HTTP in an area that it should not belong to. \n&gt; But it makes issuing download requests very easy for the client...\n&gt;   \nThat&#39;s a neat application, and it definitely sounds RESTful.  However I \nshould point out that you&#39;re treating the &quot;sensor download operation&quot; as \ndata, rather than a verb. You&#39;re using the Command pattern, in GoF \nspeak.  This is a valid design choice and is entirely appropriate, when \nthe message is something you need to &quot;monitor the status of&quot;.  You don&#39;t \n&quot;monitor the status&quot; of a GET request by GETting another resource.  What \nyou&#39;re doing is not unlike SOAP - where an HTTP POST is used to package \nup another message.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re using REST when you can, but not \nusing it where it doesn&#39;t fit.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
