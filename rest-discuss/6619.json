Things like\n&gt; &gt; session logout, usable login dialogs, and the lack of standard\n&gt; &gt; affordances for PUT, DELETE, etc., are all left undone because\n&gt; &gt; &quot;that&#39;s how Mosaic did it&quot; was the only standard that mattered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought that WHATWG was going to pick up the slack on some of\n&gt; &gt; those undefined standards-in-waiting, but apparently not.\n&gt;\n&gt; WHAT-WG specs are really big, so you have to look closely. It doesn&#39;t\n&gt; help that they are breaking off chunks and taking them to W3C. For\n&gt; example, here is what&#39;s they&#39;ve done for PUT/DELETE in forms:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/web-forms-2/#for-http\n\nYikes.  Looks like they need a clue-stick about security.\n\nStandard UI affordances are like &quot;hypertext = GET, button = POST,\nfancy-red-X = DELETE, upload-arrow = PUT, ... basically, common idioms\nthat represent the action and allow the user to be aware of the type\nof action being requested before it is selected.  (One of the more\ncommonly cited examples was a Boeing design for an airplane&#39;s\nlanding gear control, which is shaped like landing gear so that\nit is distinguished from all of the other controls.  It doesn&#39;t\nreally matter what they are -- they just have to be different for\neach one and used consistently within a given browser.  Such affordances\nwere actually required by HTML back when I was involved.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be curious to hear the history on session logout, usable login\n&gt; dialogs. Have any pointers or information?\n\nNothing specific off-hand.  All you need to logout of an HTTP session\nis a UI for telling the browser to stop sending its cached credential,\nwhich was obvious to everyone except the browser developers.  Likewise,\nif the browser displayed the HTTP message sent with a 401 response, then\napplication developers could easily define their own custom login\ndialogs.  That is all part of the design of URI+HTTP+HTML -- the only\nbit missing was one implementation to show all the others how to do it.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
