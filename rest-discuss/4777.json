It is\na new resource. The resource identifier consists of all the data in the URI,\nincluding the query terms.\n\nTracking who is sending requests to the server about resources might be\nbetter done via authorization headers in HTTP. Separating the resource from\nthe authorization is a good approach in general and applies here as well.\nSome forms of tracking could use IP address, but only if you don&#39;t need to\ncorrelate the gathered data with the actual responsible party at the other\nend of the line.\nIf this is truly for billing, then you probably could justify requiring a\nlogin. Unfortunately HTML and current Web browsers don&#39;t provide much\nfunctionality to the application designer in the realm of http\nauthentication - the user experience sucks. There is some hope from the\nWHAT-WG and other discussions over the years. Maybe some clever soul will\nfinally add the functionality to Firefox or create a Firefox extension and\nwe can be closer to ridding the world of cookies.\n\n\n"}}
