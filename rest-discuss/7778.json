A request to the trainer would mean: \n&gt; &quot;give me the next exercise you want me to complete&quot;. The \n&gt; trainer responds with one of many exercises most of the time. \n&gt; After having completed a certain number of exercises the \n&gt; trainee would be directed to some kind of summary or statistics.\n&gt; \n&gt; How should I model this?\n&gt; \n&gt; As the response of the trainer ressource is meant to change \n&gt; randomly for each request, should I POST to this ressource? \n&gt; Or should I GET it and redirect the client through a location \n&gt; header? Or do something else that I&#39;m missing?\nThe response is not meant to change randomly - you said &quot;... want me to\ncomplete&quot;. Until you&#39;ve indicated that your state is &#39;complete&#39;, then the\nresponse should remain unchanged (in order to take into consideration the\nfailure to retrieve the initial response completely).\n\n\n\n"}}
