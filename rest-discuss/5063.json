That actually has a chance of working because the developers who \nhave to use the web service are from an external company, have no SOAP \nexperience, and have a bit of influence in how things get done.\n\n &gt; You will probably still lose\n &gt; the battle, but it beats arguing religion hands down.\n\nThanks for the confidence boost! :-)\n\nHere&#39;s the chain of influence that I&#39;m working against.\n\n1. My client has large investment in software from a major GIS[1] vendor.\n\n2. This vendor has released a new &quot;enterprise platform&quot; product which is \n&quot;web service enabled&quot;. In reality, nothing in that product itself \nprovides web services. You have to use Visual Studio, Apache Axis or \nequivalent to create the SOAP bindings.\n\n3. Sales and technical people from the vendor are talking up web \nservices acronyms (SOAP, WSDL and UDDI) without actually knowing much \nabout them except that they are &quot;industry standards&quot; for \n&quot;interoperability&quot; (the vendor is pushing the open and interop line \nlately). When challenged, especially on UDDI, all I got was blank looks \nand responses summarised by &quot;it&#39;s the latest thing&quot; and &quot;everyone is \ndoing it&quot;.\n\n4. The software developer likes to learn new things that are good for \ntheir resume and which the tools make easy to *deliver*. They understand \nhow to call a procedure, so SOAP is the &quot;natural&quot; choice. I suggested \nHTTP GET early on and was ignored.\n\nTo win this battle I have to break the dependency on Visual Studio and \nget them to think about good design. That&#39;s going to be difficult.\n\nAndrew\n\n[1] Geographic Information System\n\n\n"}}
