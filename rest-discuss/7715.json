Eg, imagine the surprise  \n&gt; that someone gets when they try to run XSLT over an XML representation  \n&gt; but get a zip file because their XSLT processor isn&#39;t setting the  \n&gt; Accept headers in exactly the way that the server expects.\n\nThat&#39;s a really serious bug in the XSLT processor then. Any XSLT \nprocessor that says it prefers to get zipped files, and then doesn&#39;t \nhandle them; well that&#39;s almost (but not quite) too dumb to be believed.\n\nIf such a thing exists, it&#39;s only because servers aren&#39;t respecting \nconneg. Fail fast is a feature, not a bug. Working around broken \nsoftware is an antipattern we have to do away with.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
