Anyone?\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n1. You could accept multiple (new) user definitions for any media-type\n(as long as it supported multiple definitions), so it wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily be a hack, just usual representation handling. For example\nthe resource could accept XML or JSON representations of multiple\nusers or of a single user as well.\n2. Using POST to create a single user can use the Location header to\ninform the client what is the created URI, with multiple users you\ncan&#39;t do this. The server can respond with a representation with all\nthe created URIs, or with a Location header pointing to a resource\nthat represents the bulk upload (e.g. /users/bulk/1234) results. Using\nthis second design would indicate that POSTing to /users/bulk would be\nmore appropriate (IMHO).\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel Yokomizo\n\n"}}
