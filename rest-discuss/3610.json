Session based\n&gt; &gt; webapps can&#39;t be done with REST because it&#39;s a requirement that there\n&gt; &gt; be no session.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think thats quite right; REST does not prohibit sessions, the\n&gt; constraint is that the HTTP protocol is stateless. As long as your\n&gt; sessions are _visible_ (i.e. probably manifest as a resource on the\n&gt; server) then sessions and REST can be compatable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having said this sessions are often a lazy way of web app programming\n&gt; where information is stuffed into an (invisible) session instead of\n&gt; carried around in the URI - visibility again.\n\nI agree that REST is the best way of building webapps. But session\nbased webapps are sometimes necessary because of user requirements\nand REST does not strictly handle those.\n\nHowever, cookies can be put in on top of a REST architecture without\ncomplicating it too much. Roy is right that they&#39;re evil but user now\nsometimes expect them unfortunately.\n\nI&#39;ve just finished building an app for a user that had one of these\nodd requirements. It&#39;s a legal information app, users buy access and\nget an account. The accounts aren&#39;t necessarily unique to a user (an\norganisation might buy the right to login 10 times). My client has a\nvery confused idea of what authentication is, but they have legacy\nbusiness reasons for it, so I can&#39;t change it.\n\nThe requirement that really breaks REST is that the user&#39;s can store\naltered forms of the documents in the system but those documents are\nonly visible to them. These documents are in XML on a SQL database so\nwe have a session based user document table. In effect the session\nlasts a long time, but it&#39;s still a session.\n\nWithout embedding the user id in a url (strictly, against REST as\nwell) I can&#39;t see how I would have done this without cookies.\n\n\nHaving said that, the rest (scuse the pun) of the app is REST based\nand works pretty well. At the end of the day the cookie stuff is\nreally only an interaction between the client and the stored procs in\nthe database.\n\n\nI think you can state categorically that REST cannot handle\npersonalization because user id urls are frowned on and cookies are\ndisliked. How else to maintain the personalization state?\n\nRoy says that personalization applications aren&#39;t worth\nmuch and I broadly agree, but some are and we can&#39;t always convince\nour clients that they don&#39;t need personalization.\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
