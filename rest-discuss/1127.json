That&#39;s why I&#39;m not an XML person. 8-)\n\n&gt; One of\n&gt; my complaints about SOAP is that it (and XLink, for that matter) is that\n&gt; it introduces a foreign syntax into XML vocabularies and thus makes them\n&gt; harder to teach and learn. That impacts their adoption characteristics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Out-of-line, I can stand RDF&#39;s syntax because that is really what it is\n&gt; optimized for: pointing into resources and making assertions about them.\n&gt; But inline, I can hardly imagine ever doing this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;rdf:Description about=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;s:Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/s:Creator&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/Creator&gt;\n\nSure, but there&#39;s more information available in the former case.  If the\nXML is going to be processed by a machine anyways, why is the latter\napproach any better?  I suppose if it were hand authored, but is that\nwhat we&#39;re talking about here?\n\nAlso, I think the XML syntax for the RDF model is a horrible, nasty,\nunnecessary thing.  It should be killed.\n\n&gt; I think that this sort of disagreement was behind the RSS conflict and\n&gt; branch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Likely the right way to merge the worlds is to have a sort of RDF\n&gt; stylesheet which maps from XML into the RDF model. I would associate\n&gt; that with my document through a processing instruction. I believe the\n&gt; FourThought guys were working on such a technique.\n\nI&#39;ve heard talk of adorning schemas with the information necessary to\nconstruct RDF.  I like this in theory, though I fear for the practical\nimplications; primarily, additional network round-trips.\n\n&gt; &gt; What RDF provides is a generalized assertion model.  That means that an\n&gt; &gt; RDF client can build up an understanding of a piece of representational\n&gt; &gt; state in an incremental manner, rather than the all-or-nothing approach\n&gt; &gt; of XML, where you either do or do not understand a schema.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s certainly valuable but in my personal opinion, most XML users\n&gt; will not be willing to pay the price of designing their vocabularies\n&gt; specifically for RDF compatibility.\n\nFor now, that&#39;s clearly true.  As more RDF features are integrated into\ntools, the cost of doing this will come down.\n\n&gt; For one thing, the idea of making one of the top-most elements &quot;rdf:RDF&quot;\n&gt; rather goes against the design of almost every XML schema language I&#39;ve\n&gt; ever seen.\n\nTrue, but I consider XML schema and other languages at that level, to be\ntransitional technologies.  rdf:RDF (or something equivalent) will the\nbe the root element for a whole lot of content in a few years.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
