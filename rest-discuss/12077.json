(Because in\nfact nothing ever did happen.) If you want to change the URIs of\nthe old resources you can put redirects in place to keep old\nbookmarks working, but you could equally well keep the old URIs\ncanonical for old resources.\n\nAlso, you can interconnect two different applications, or even\nditch the server code of one of them and configure the other to\ncontinue to provide its functionality, without one of the apps\nhaving to subsume the URI space of the other. There is no forced\nhomogenisation of systems.\n\nYou can actually, in the true meaning of the word, *integrate*\nservices! Who’da thunk.\n\nThe brilliance of REST is all about the hypermedia constraint.\nThe other constraints are only loosely dependent on each other\nand individually negotiable. But together they form the structure\nthat supports the hypermedia constraint, and the hypermedia\nconstraint in turn multiplies the value of the other constraints.\nIt is the hypermedia constraint that makes REST as a style\ngreater than the sum of its constraints. It is the focal point\nand amplifier of all the constraints.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
