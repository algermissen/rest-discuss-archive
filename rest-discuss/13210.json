E.g. when you decide to turn each &quot;customer&quot;\n&gt; into its own identifiable resource - http://example.com/customers/1234\n&gt; - what does http://example.com/customers/{id} describe? Both &quot;resource\n&gt; class&quot; and &quot;resource type&quot; would work, but don&#39;t seem really\n&gt; convincing.\n\nResources all have the same type in a formal sense. The same methods\nare legal, and the same responses can be expected. The media types\nused are standard throughout the architecture. However, different\nresources have different semantics.\n\nThe discovery of semantics from a client perspective always comes from\ncontext. The URL might come from a file on disk, with associated\nsemantics such as &quot;home page&quot; or &quot;banking site&quot;. In a hypermedia\nsystem the semantics will be encoded into representations returned\nfrom other resources via hyperlinks. Again the context performs the\nfunction of supplying semantics, often semantics relative to these\nother resources. The uniform interface constraint requires that the\nsemantics be either human/AI-readable and encoded into free-form\ncontent or machine-readable and encoded into some standard somewhere\nthat says what semantics can be implied from the context of the link.\nFor example, HTML contains &quot;a&quot; elements with supporting human-readable\nsemantics. Atom contains links with attributes like rel=&quot;self&quot; to\nindicate the semantics that the client can expect from the linked\nresource. These standard machine-readable context semantics play some\nof the role in the architecture that a service contract might have\nplayed in a classical SOA.\n\nThe fact that you are talking about a customer resource should\nindicate that the client is aware of these &quot;customer&quot; semantics, and\nmore: They should be more or less aware of which customer the resource\nis talking about, or at least which customer in relation to some other\nresource. It might be the &quot;joe blo&quot; customer, or the &quot;customer for\ninvoice 1234&quot;. Those are the semantics that the client should have\nin-hand in relation to the resource.\n\nFrom a client or a server perspective I would be perfectly happy\ntalking a &quot;customer resource&quot;. That is at least the &quot;kind&quot; of resource\nit is... but perhaps even kind is not the right term. There is an\nelement of classification to the concept, but primarily we are talking\nabout the semantics and therefore what kind of transactions this\nresource might become involved with as compared to other resources. I\nthink that if we were to get formal we might talk about type\ndescribing the interface of the resource, which of course is standard\nacross all resources. All resources have the same type. On the other\nhand, perhaps they do not have the same class. In the same sense that\nseveral different Java classes might implement the same interface,\nperhaps we could talk about different classes of resource implementing\nthe same uniform interface.\n\nStill, I guess class doesn&#39;t ring true to me either on a gut level...\nand formality may best be avoided :) In that case we might again fall\nback to a less formal &quot;kind&quot; terminology, or similar.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n"}}
