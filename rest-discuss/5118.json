The units are implicit (in our\n&gt; &gt; county) by the numbers received -- if c2 is negative, then it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; latitude and longitude, if c1&gt;2000000, then it&#39;s in feet, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can see a URI similar to:\n&gt; &gt; www.example.com/cgi/locations/2231456.12/456789.2323 that uniquely\n&gt; &gt; identifies a spot on the ground -- no problem. That same location\n&gt; &gt; might also be called\n&gt; &gt; www.example.com/cgi/locations/40.2432342/-81.0980809 if it&#39;s being\n&gt; &gt; ID&#39;ed by latitude/longitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But how do I RESTfully pass a list of coordinates? Do I have to wrap\n&gt; &gt; them up as a single resource and then pass that? Or a great, long\n&gt; URI\n&gt; &gt; including all the coordinate pairs? Or am I on the wrong track\n&gt; altogether?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is one way to solve the problem. It&#39;s not the only one.\n&gt; \n&gt; The four questions to ask when trying to build something in a\n&gt; RESTful[1] manner is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. What are the resources? \n&gt; \n&gt;    In this case, it sounds like the resources are locations. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter the coordinates you use, the nature of the thing is\n&gt; location. So the URIs should reflect that, and I would ensure that the\n&gt; coordinate system was part of the URI, that way you don&#39;t end up with\n&gt; conflicts in the future. You may want to look at Matrix URIs for\n&gt; inspiration[2].\n&gt; \n&gt;    www.example.com/latlog;lat=40.2432342;lon=-81.0980809\n&gt;    www.example.com/spc;x=2231456.12;y=456789.2323\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. What are the representations?\n&gt; \n&gt;    Well, it sounds like there are different ways to refer to a\n&gt; location, lat/lon, State Plane Coordinates, etc. Since you are trying\n&gt; to build a converter, let&#39;s stuff all the coordinate systems into the\n&gt; representation. Assuming you are ok with using XML as the\n&gt; representation you could return something like:\n&gt; \n&gt;     &lt;location&gt;\n&gt;        &lt;latlon&gt;40.2432342/-81.0980809&lt;/latlon&gt;\n&gt;        &lt;state_plane&gt;2231456.12/456789.2323&lt;/state_plane&gt;\n&gt;        ...\n&gt;     &lt;/location&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Note the extensibility this gives you. To add a new coordinate type on\n&gt; the output you add a new child element of &lt;location/&gt;. To accept a new\n&gt; coordinate system on the input you mint a new URI:  \n&gt; http://example.com/some-new-coords;x=12;y=13.\n&gt; \n&gt; It also is rather simple for the client using this service  since all\n&gt; the representations contain all the coordinate types.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/01/restful-web.html\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html\n&gt; \n&gt;    -joe\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Joe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
