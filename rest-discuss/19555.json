I am specifically curious\n&gt;&gt; of best practices for the former case, w=\r\nhen a RESTful API aims at letting\n&gt;&gt; consumer work through a specific workf=\r\nlow (eg. buying a book online).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I thought the best practice was to le=\r\nt user land ton an entry point\n&gt;&gt; resource (eg collection of books) and the=\r\nn let user evolve in the workflow:\n&gt;&gt; first by affording user to initiate t=\r\nhe workflow (eg. &quot;rel=3Dbuy&quot; which\n&gt;&gt; likely translates with GETing a &quot;buy-=\r\na-book-form&quot; resource, letting user\n&gt;&gt; discover which inputs are need to st=\r\nart the workflow). Then subsequently,\n&gt;&gt; each step in the workflow will aff=\r\nord user to confirm an order, select\n&gt;&gt; payment information, shipping detai=\r\nls... Ultimately the server will confirm\n&gt;&gt; creation of an order resource (=\r\nand maybe  provide a shipment resource\n&gt;&gt; allowing user to track shipping s=\r\ntatus or to cancel order, etc.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In such typical workflow scenario, is=\r\n it a bad practice to expose rels as\n&gt;&gt; &quot;actions&quot; (thus verbs)? I think of =\r\nhaving server sending relevant actions\n&gt;&gt; on each step (as part of resource=\r\n representations), letting user discover\n&gt;&gt; HTTP methods and target resourc=\r\ne to interact with as a result of activating\n&gt;&gt; the hypermedia control (act=\r\nion).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the example of AtomPub, we have a similar hypermedia control=\r\n &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt;&gt; (verb) to afford atom consumer a given feed entry can be edited.=\r\n Which\n&gt;&gt; translate with a PUT to the target href (the target feed entry).\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In other words, what is the best practice to express hypermedia actio=\r\nns\n&gt;&gt; in a RESTful way, to allow consumer to control the workflow while the=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; server controls the affordances of the user (based on internal applicat=\r\nion\n&gt;&gt; state)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Phil\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Le 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58, Mike Kelly &lt;mikek=\r\nelly321@...&gt; a =E9crit :\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:31 AM, =\r\nJan Algermissen\n&gt;&gt; &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; On 08.11.2013, at 02:08, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not sure i understand the Q, but i&#39;ll offer this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nl=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/publisher&quot; describes the relationship\n&gt;&gt; betwe=\r\nen the source and the target.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I like to try to emphasize wh=\r\nat the target is *to the source* with the\n&gt;&gt; goal that the application-leve=\r\nl effect of the HTTP methods falls into place.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This IMO helps a g=\r\nreat deal with avoiding to layer specialized\n&gt;&gt; application protocols on to=\r\np of HTTP (which already is the application\n&gt;&gt; protocol).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; IOW, it=\r\n helps prevent redefinitions of the meaning of HTTP methods.\n&gt;&gt; POST means =\r\nPOST, it cannot mean &#39;publish the source resource&#39;.

Th=\r\ne HTTP method definitions attribute\n&gt;&gt; meaning designed for this purpose (e=\r\n.g. establishing safety,\n&gt;&gt; idempotency, cacheability, etc).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Provided=\r\n the link relations are not in conflict with the HTTP\n&gt;&gt; definitions, and a=\r\nre merely qualifying the details of methods within\n&gt;&gt; the context of a give=\r\nn transition, then it is wrong to think about\n&gt;&gt; that in terms of &quot;redefini=\r\ntion&quot;. It&#39;s qualification.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In practice, it&#39;s much easier for consumin=\r\ng parties if your\n&gt;&gt; documentation is specific by providing an explicit des=\r\ncription of the\n&gt;&gt; meaning and structure of the various requests possible o=\r\nver a given\n&gt;&gt; link. Leaving your documentation so abstract that the reader=\r\n is left\n&gt;&gt; with the task of inferring every part of each possible request =\r\ndoes\n&gt;&gt; not seem like a very pragmatic approach for custom link relations (=\r\nbut\n&gt;&gt; may be more appropriate for standardised link relations).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If=\r\n you find yourself in a situation that you absolutely must tell the\n&gt;&gt; clie=\r\nnt developer this, rephrase the hypermedia semantic (here: the link rel\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nspec).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothing to say againts hints regarding the intend=\r\ned\n&gt;&gt; &#39;canonical&#39; use case but I can always only be a hint. AtomPub is an\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; example, where the spec tells us so much about the interactions between\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; client and server that it looks like a protocol when it is actually only\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; hints about a canonical application flow. Focussing on resource semantic=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; would have been much nicer, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One simply cannot constrai=\r\nn HTTP servers that way and still have REST.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The importance of H=\r\nTTP methods from a REST point of view is that they\n&gt;&gt; create **some** visib=\r\nility of the client server interactions, so that\n&gt;&gt; the messages can be und=\r\nerstood to _a certain extent_ by\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries. Provided that visibilit=\r\ny is not impacted (i.e. a link\n&gt;&gt; rel&#39;s qualification of a method doesn&#39;t _=\r\nconflict_ with HTTP&#39;s) then\n&gt;&gt; how does this have any bearing on the &quot;RESTf=\r\nulness&quot; of the\n&gt;&gt; application?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; M\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b2e138d4b1e5c04eac646c3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;content-type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=\r\n=3Dutf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body dir=3D&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting...=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now how do I tell in this book representation that at this time, c=\r\nlearing the shopping cart or adding the book to the shipping cart is not al=\r\nlowed (eg based on authenticated user permissions) but reading it is allowe=\r\nd?

Would the representation inclu=\r\nde a link to the form (instead of to the shopping cart directly), and its d=\r\noc states only GET is allowed? The idea is to let user discover which attri=\r\nbutes are need as input before a PUT (or POST or PATCH) can be called on th=\r\ne shopping cart... Instead of having client to hard code editable input fie=\r\nlds to be requested to user (&quot;knowing&quot; the media type or profile =\r\nof the shopping cart resource).&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks again, it =\r\nhelps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Phil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Le 9 nov. 2013 =E0 16:53=\r\n, mike amundsen &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mamund@...&quot;&gt;mamund@...&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&gt; a =E9crit=A0:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;FWIW, you&#39;re getting in to &quot;design&quot; space here - and=\r\n that&#39;s based on context and preference. nothing right/wrong here so th=\r\nere are lots of options.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;first, i usually indicate=\r\n state properties of a resource using data elements in the representation, =\r\nnot transition elements:&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;book&g=\r\nt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;=A0 &lt;in-stock value=3D&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style&gt;=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;...&quot; rel=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://e=\r\nxample.com/rels/shopping-cart&quot;&gt;http://example.com/rels/shopping-cart&lt;/a&gt;&qu=\r\not; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;/book&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div s=\r\ntyle&gt;again, instructions on the link identified as the shopping cart might =\r\nlook like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;- HTTP.GET returns the state of the shoppin=\r\ng cart&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;\n\n\n- HTTP.POST adds the current book to the shopping=\r\n cart&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;- HTTP.DELETE clears all items from the shopping cart=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;and so on...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;now =\r\nclients (humans) can see that the &quot;state&quot; of the book is &quot;in=\r\n-stock&quot; and then decide to take an appropriate action.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div st=\r\nyle&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;as for &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;I believe there are cases where=\r\n the server dictates the steps before&quot;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;\n\n\n&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;yes,=\r\n the server may have rules about what &quot;state&quot; server-side resourc=\r\nes need to have before a task can be executed.

But this is, in=\r\n the long run, a false efficiency. It _assumes_ the client code already &qu=\r\not;knows&quot; things (action and target are coupled) and constrains the po=\r\nssible options for the client (&quot;you can only do a single action for th=\r\nis control, want to do some other action? sorry, no control for that here, =\r\nmove along&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;in the big picture, i&#39=\r\n;ve found keeping target identifiers (collection, storage, document, person=\r\n) decoupled from action (share, modify, copy, move, approve, cancel) is a b=\r\nig win. while it adds some indirection/complexity to the representation (bo=\r\nth at design-time and run-time) this pattern also adds more options and inc=\r\nreases the independence of the client application. including allowing clien=\r\nts to (in some cases) create new successful workflows that the server didn&=\r\n#39;t map out even though it is completely allowed by the state machine.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FWIW, if you want to continue to constrain cli=\r\nents to only following strict server pre-defined paths, you can still do th=\r\nat while sticking to the &quot;rel is for relationships&quot; pattern.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cheers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;mamund&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span title=3D&quot;Call with Google Voice&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;tel:%2B1.859.757.1=\r\n449&quot; value=3D&quot;+18597571449&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;+1.859.757.1449&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nskype: mca.amundsen&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://amundsen.com/blog/&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://amundsen.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://twitte=\r\nr.com/mamund&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/mamund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;https://github.com/mamund&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mamund&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/mamund&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.linkedin.com/in/mamund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat, Nov 9, 2013 at 12:59 PM, Philippe Marsteau &lt;span d=\r\nir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:marsteau@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mars=\r\nteau@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;I see 2 distinct purposes of link relations: eithe=\r\nr to qualified a transition from one state to another of the resource, or t=\r\no describe how two resources relate one to another.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;This discussion I think focused on the latter. I am specifically curious=\r\n of best practices for the former case, when a RESTful API aims at letting =\r\nconsumer work through a specific workflow (eg. buying a book online).&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought the best practice was to let user land=\r\n ton an entry point resource (eg collection of books) and then let user evo=\r\nlve in the workflow: first by affording user to initiate the workflow (eg. =\r\n&quot;rel=3Dbuy&quot; which likely translates with GETing a &quot;buy-a-boo=\r\nk-form&quot; resource, letting user discover which inputs are need to start=\r\n the workflow). Then subsequently, each step in the workflow will afford us=\r\ner to confirm an order, select payment information, shipping details... Ult=\r\nimately the server will confirm creation of an order resource (and maybe =\r\n=A0provide a shipment resource allowing user to track shipping status or to=\r\n cancel order, etc.)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In such typical workfl=\r\now scenario, is it a bad practice to expose rels as &quot;actions&quot; (th=\r\nus verbs)? I think of having server sending relevant actions on each step (=\r\nas part of resource representations), letting user discover HTTP methods an=\r\nd target resource to interact with as a result of activating the hypermedia=\r\n control (action).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the example of AtomPu=\r\nb, we have a similar hypermedia control &quot;edit&quot; (verb) to afford a=\r\ntom consumer a given feed entry can be edited. Which translate with a PUT t=\r\no the target href (the target feed entry).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nIn other words, what is the best practice to express hypermedia actions in =\r\na RESTful way, to allow consumer to control the workflow while the server c=\r\nontrols the affordances of the user (based on internal application state)?&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Phil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Le 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58=\r\n, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekelly321@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot;&gt;mikekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; a =E9crit=A0:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote typ=\r\ne=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;p&gt;On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:31 AM, Jan Algermissen&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\nlt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jan.algermissen@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jan.alge=\r\nrmissen@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi Mike,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On 08=\r\n.11.2013, at 02:08, mike amundsen &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mamund@...&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mamund@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; not sure i understand the Q, but i&#39;ll offer this:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rel=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/publisher&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://example.com/rels/publisher&lt;/a&gt;&quot; describes the re=\r\nlationship between the source and the target.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; I like to try to emphasize what the target is *to the source* with the go=\r\nal that the application-level effect of the HTTP methods falls into place.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This IMO helps a great deal with avoiding to layer specia=\r\nlized application protocols on top of HTTP (which already is the applicatio=\r\nn protocol).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; IOW, it helps prevent redefinitions of the m=\r\neaning of HTTP methods.

Provided that visibility is not impacted (i.e.=\r\n a link&lt;br&gt;\nrel&#39;s qualification of a method doesn&#39;t _conflict_ with=\r\n HTTP&#39;s)  then&lt;br&gt;\nhow does this have any bearing on the &quot;RESTfuln=\r\ness&quot; of the&lt;br&gt;\napplication?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCheers,&lt;br&gt;\nM&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/block=\r\nquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\n/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b2e138d4b1e5c04eac646c3--\r\n\n"}}
