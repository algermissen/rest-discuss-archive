If the business process defines acknowledgement or status documents\n&gt; that have &#39;accepted&#39;, &#39;rejected&#39; and &#39;undecided&#39; values, then this would be\n&gt; fine I think (retrieving the status document tells you if it was actually\n&gt; approved). If the business document set doesn&#39;t define &#39;undecided&#39; values\n&gt; then the Location header might need to reference a resource that does not\n&gt; yet exist - and when it does exist the values within would specify\n&gt; &#39;accepted&#39; or &#39;rejected&#39;.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it be legitimate to return &quot;Created&quot; with a Location header in this\ncase. After all, you did create a resource--the status document you describe\nabove.\n\nJim\n\n=====\nJim Ancona\njim@...                     jancona@...\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTry FREE Yahoo!
