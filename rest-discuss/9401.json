I described a mechanism which works for \nme, you are talking about some trashcan thing that has no bearing on what \nI am talking about, and challenging me to tell you why it is not better \nthan what I have, when it has absolutely nothing to do with what I am \ntrying to do.\n\nMy use case is to DELETE a resource, causing subsequent GET requests to \nrespond 410 Gone.  Issuing a conditional DELETE changes the 410 Gone to \na 404 Not Found.  That is the topic of this thread, not moving things \ninto trashcans.\n\nWhat does a trashcan have to do with any of this?  Someone said that \ndeleting a file twice was counterintuitive, I only mentioned trashcans \nin response to that claim -- we all delete things twice, all the time, \nso how can doing so be counterintuitive?  This is a user perspective, \nnothing to do with any actual filesystem trashcan implementation.  \nHeck, when I close a tab in Opera it goes into a trashcan, which I can \nthen empty -- no filesystem there at all, but still a double-delete.\n\nIf you would like to talk about something completely different, then \nplease use a different thread, instead of trying to claim that my simple \nthing can&#39;t be right because it doesn&#39;t involve moving anything into a \ntrashcan, if that&#39;s your point, honestly I don&#39;t know.\n\nTo reiterate what this thread is about:\n\nI have a resource /foo which responds 200 OK to a GET request.  I issue \na DELETE request to /foo.  Now, a GET on /foo responds 410 Gone.\n\nImagine my surprise that this is controversial enough without even \nbringing up the second DELETE to have exploded like it has, with you \neven going so far as to tell me this breaks the Uniform Interface \nconstraint of REST.  I just don&#39;t know how to respond to that, other \nthan not to anymore.  :-(\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
