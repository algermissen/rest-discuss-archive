I even once wrote an AIM clone with just HTML and JavaScript\n(buddy lists, messages, chat, invites, etc.) The neat thing about it was\nthat it was HTML & javascript - /anybody/ could modify & extend it, not just\nthe propeller heads.\nKnowNow recently put some technology out as open source on sourceforge\n(mod_pubsub) & I&#39;m thinking about re-writing the KnowBuddy app (unless I can\nget KN to opensource that too)\n\n\n\n"}}
