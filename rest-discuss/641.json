It specifically does not require\nclients to implement server functionality.\n\nA client should not have to implement server like\nfunctionality if it is just receiving\nrequested state from a server.\n\nAssymetry is part of the HTTP model.  Enjoy it!\n\n&gt; Second, when the resource model\n&gt; of interest changes frequently and ordering of those updates is important.\n&gt; The problem, though, is that (particularly in the second case) the mechanism for\n&gt; framing and delivering events over a long-running GET is (a) not specified by HTTP,\n&gt; really ---\n\nI agree with you.  My general claim is indeed that\nthis is a problem to be solved at the content-type\nlevel rather than at the HTTP protocol level.\n\nAnd, moreover, the combination of\nmultipart/mixed with message/external-body has\nexactly the semantics that notification\nrequires.\n\nThere is no deep need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n&gt; there are no existing suitable mechanisms for  passing *multiple* responses\n&gt; to a single request, though pipelining could potentially be abused somehow,\n\nI am not advocating passing multiple responses.  I\nam advocating passing a single multipart/mixed\nresponse (that may be sent chunk encoded).\n\n&gt; and (b)\n&gt; even if there were, the problem seems very application-specific;  knowing what\n&gt; individual update messages or events mean, etc. may not be generalizable.  To the\n&gt; extent that it is generalizable, KN or similar probably provides the right general\n&gt; pattern.\n\nI don&#39;t know the details of the KN protocol, but\nthe application of getting notifications of change\non some set of URLs is best handled by MIME.\n\nYou need to get the MIME zen. :-)\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
