Their purpose is\n&gt; discovered by inspection.  Of course, there are expectations when\n&gt; following a link and breaking these may cause confusion in the user\n&gt; agent even for humnas (for example, following a &quot;pay now&quot; link and\n&gt; arriving at a recipe for chocolate cake).  Furthermore, encoding the\n&gt; nature of the document in the content type, means that this\n&gt; information will be out-of-band, which may cause other complications.\n\n\nThat is a misinterpretation.\n\nThe idea behind using concrete media types is to keep the interactions  \nvisible, i.e., we should be able to apply some amount of processing  \nwithout parsing the representation. That processing could be in the  \nform of routing at a proxy, prioritizing/deprioritizing some messages,  \nor applying different caching rules.\n\nThe moment you start overloading media types, that visibility would be  \ngone. Also note that this is a problem with any payload format,  \nincluding Atom.\n\nIf visibility is of no importance for your applications, fine, use  \nHTML/XHTML, POX, Atom or whatever. If visibility is important, look  \nfor or design concrete media types.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
