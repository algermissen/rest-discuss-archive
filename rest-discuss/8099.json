So, off I toddled to Roy&#39;s dissertation\nand looked ... no definition. Indeed, there is nothing in the\ndissertation stipulating the four verbs we typically talk about around\nhere.\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm\n\nNext, I toddled off to the HTTP spec and found that MOVE is specified\nas a core method:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/spec.html#MOVE\n\nNow, whilst I have no desire to use WebDAV extension methods, I don&#39;t\nhave any intrinsic objection to anything that is in the core of the\nprotocol spec (which is why I support and leverage OPTIONS).\n\nTherefore, I must reconsider MOVE. What does the spec say?\n\n&quot;The MOVE method requests that the resource identified by the\nRequest-URI be moved to the location(s) given in the URI header field\nof the request. This method is equivalent to a COPY immediately\nfollowed by a DELETE, but enables both to occur within a single\ntransaction.&quot;\n\nNote: this solves one of my concerns - namely that the Location header\nis a response header and therefore is not appropriate for use in a\nrequest. The spec says to use the URI header:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/spec.html#URI-header\n\nSo, the client is asking the server to carry out the move operation on\nit&#39;s behalf. That&#39;s fine, but how is the server to know if the\nmovement is temporary or permanent, and thus which is the correct 3xx\nresponse to provide upon receipt of requests to the original URL?\n\nNext, this makes sense as a atomic operation when both the origin and\ndestination URLs reside on the same host but what if the destination\nis on a different host? This was my blogger example given earlier. Is\nthe client to expect the server to carry out that movement? In that\nscenario, how should the credentials be handled if the destination\nserver issues a challenge?\nAssuming that the client does not trust any other agent with its&#39;\nsecurity credentials, we are back at stage 1 and MOVE does not solve\nthe problem (even though I am now starting to think may be valid\nwithin a RESTful application).\n\nIn which case, the solution could well still be a PUT carrying\nContent-Type: message/http (and possibly also supporting MOVE for\noperations entirely on the same host).\n\nThanks for the discussion everyone - this is helping my creative juices.\n\nRegards,\nAlan\n\n"}}
