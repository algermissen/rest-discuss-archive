Perhaps if your applications was re-phrased using &#39;resource&#39;\n&gt; &gt; rather than &#39;node&#39; and &#39;object&#39; I&#39;d be able to understand.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Due to anonymity requirements, the originating node cannot know where\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the pieces of an object are (for example, a query or a transaction),\nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nodes usually cannot know where the object originated.\n&gt; &gt; What is an &#39;originating node&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ripple is a P2P trust network of software node-agents living on http\n&gt; servers.  To make it more clear, I&#39;ll just use the word &quot;hosts&quot; from now\n&gt; on, even though that&#39;s not technically what I mean.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is that an HTTP client?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, and server.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To hide the location of the pieces, you have a single identifiable\n&gt; &gt; resource and clients don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know what lays beyond.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, for example, a transaction involves a chain of hosts, but each host\n&gt; only knows about the host directly before and after it.  What I&#39;m\n&gt; struggling with is that it seems so convenient to give the transaction a\n&gt; single name, but I can&#39;t identify it with a single host for privacy\n&gt; reasons, and so I can&#39;t give it a single URI.  Using a proxy doesn&#39;t work\n&gt; either, unless everyone used the same one, which is a central point of\n&gt; failure and therefore bad.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No, different hosts each holding their aspect of distributed objects is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; integral to the application.\n&gt; &gt; Okay, but how can you have different hosts holding aspects of a single\n&gt; &gt; distributed object but not tell any client where those different aspects\n&gt; &gt; are located??\n&gt;\n&gt; They only tell neighbouring host on the trust network, ie, those they\n&gt; trust.  All the bits can be found by passing queries down and back up the\n&gt; chain of trusted hosts, without the requesting host ever knowing exactly\n&gt; where the queries go.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A server hosts multiple nodes that each communicate with many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; neighbouring\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nodes (&quot;friends&quot; with which they can exchange IOUs).\n&gt; &gt; Okay - each &#39;node&#39; is a resource. Clients communicate with this &#39;public&#39;\n&gt; &gt; node. Clients do not know about neighboring nodes. The resource is a\n&gt; &gt; type of aggregating proxy for those other nodes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds about right.  It may be informative to say also that clients are\n&gt; the means through which the owner of a node accesses his node and gives it\n&gt; instructions, whether in person (opening an account with another node), or\n&gt; automatically (accepting payments through an ecommerce site).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nodes may also communicate with a strange node to pay or receive\npayment\n&gt; &gt; from that node.\n&gt; &gt; Okay - each &#39;node&#39; may also be a client and can transfer payment to\nother\n&gt; &gt; resources or request payment from other resources. In order to receive\n&gt; &gt; unsolicited transfers, a node needs to have an identifier and the sender\n&gt; &gt; of payment needs to know what that is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right.  The node identifier being a resolvable URI makes perfect sense -- \n&gt; until the node moves to a different server!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Payments are made by passing IOUs along paths connecting two strange\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nodes\n&gt; &gt; in the network of neighbours.\n&gt; &gt; Ah... a chain of proxies... and this chain is used to obscure the legal\n&gt; &gt; entity requesting a transfer?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not primarily, although that might be a side benefit, I don&#39;t know.  The\n&gt; chain of intermediaries is literally necessary to make the payment with\n&gt; IOUs.  For example, would you ship me something if I paid you with my\n&gt; digitally-signed IOU?  Of course you wouldn&#39;t.  But you might if we could\n&gt; find a common friend who would vouch for my IOU by promising to make good\n&gt; on it himself if I didn&#39;t.  Ripple works by finding chains of these\n&gt; intermediaries.\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; I&#39;m actually beginning to feel like a bit of a troll on this list, because\n&gt; the more I type about this, the more I become convinced that not only is\n&gt; REST not particularly suited to my application, but HTTP isn&#39;t really\n&gt; either.  Stateful bi-directional peer connections seem like the right fit\n&gt; (been reading about BEEP - http://beepcore.org/).  Ripple really seems to\n&gt; want to be a closed, relatively tightly-coupled private network, despite\n&gt; my best efforts to make it otherwise.  So while I&#39;m still open to having\n&gt; my mind changed, I won&#39;t ask the list to delve any more into my arcane\n&gt; little project unless it truly interests you as a &quot;hard case&quot;...\n&gt;\n&gt; I very much appreciate the responses.  Thanks Mike.  I may be back for\n&gt; some help with a RESTful client API, although I think that will be much\n&gt; easier.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ryan\n&gt;\n\n"}}
