It&#39;s putting a\n&gt;&gt; session id in a cookie and hiding data in the session on the server\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s wrong.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Well, I was implying that I&#39;m storing a session ID in a cookie.\n\nOh. Well that would be bad then.  /8-&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Another way of doing this though is without a cookie. the user could\n&gt;&gt; have a resource on the server:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   http://store/nicferrier/cart\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and the client side AJAX could update that resource as and when I\n&gt;&gt; check things in and out of my cart.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; OK, so now you&#39;re putting the subject (here, a user ID instead of \n&gt; session ID) in the URL.\n\nNo. The resource is the object (in John&#39;s little language). \n\nIt&#39;s nicferrier&#39;s cart. It&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s cart. It&#39;s the same as\nthe bankaccount example (from earlier in this thread?).\n\n\n&gt; Is it any worse if I write http://store/9823DF/cart, where 9823DF is a \n&gt; session key?\n\nOf course the exact form of the URL does not matter. They&#39;re only\nidentifiers.\n\nBut if by &quot;session key&quot; you mean  that the cart resource is altered by\na &quot;session object&quot; on the server then that would be bad but only\nbecause that session data would mean that you were doing stuff that\nyou didn&#39;t really need to do because you already have a RESTful\narchitecture.\n\nIf you&#39;ve got a bunch of resources:\n\n  http://store/x/cart\n\n[where x is some id identifying individual carts]\n\nwhich have representations of the content of shopping baskets and\nyou&#39;ve got a shop front app manipulating those (say with AJAX) and\npresenting the data to the end users then I think that would be\nRESTful.\n\nWhy then would you add a session object to the back end of that with\nall the implementation problems that sessions bring? (session data\ndistribution, load balancing, locking, etc...)\n\n\nOr have I misunderstood what you were saying?\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
