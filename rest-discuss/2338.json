Is there one?\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-July/001946.html\n&gt; [2] http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-July/001974.html\n&gt; [3] http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage\n&gt;\n&gt;\nThere is now.\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestFaq#line171\nWhat about those pesky hit counters?\nREST systems have a safe and idempotent &#39;get&#39; operation. So does HTTP.\n&#39;Safe&#39; generally means it isn&#39;t intended to modify the resource (the sender\nisn&#39;t responsible for any problems), and &#39;idempotent&#39; means repeating the\noperation ends up with the resource in the same state (it doesn&#39;t mean all\nthe responses are always identical).\n\nThis is a confusing point because a &#39;hit counter&#39; accumulates the number of\ntime an idempotent operation has occured - and often is visible within the\nrepresentation of that resource - things change just by doing a GET!\nHorrors!\n\nThere is of course no way to prevent this from mere architectural\ndescriptions of the system. It is up to the server author to understand what\nwill happen and what this implies. The REST approach guides designers away\nfrom this approach as a foundation to build functionality. It is still\ndoable - but it has costs and problems that it should be avoided as a\ngeneral approach.\n\n\n"}}
