Please first note, if I talk about client I do not mean\n&gt;  browser, but instead another application calling the REST interface by http.\n&gt;\n&gt;  To make the discussion not too abstract a small example. Consider a server\n&gt;  providing some kind of document repository. Each user can download documents\n&gt;  (GET) or upload new documents (POST).\nAny reason why not PUT?\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  Another often cited method is to use HTTP auth (basic or digest). But this\n&gt;  is no option, if access rights are not handled by the application server but\n&gt;  inside the application.\n\nWe&#39;ve implemented just that using C# and Java restlets.\nGives normal client login.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  So the perfect solution would be that the client sends each time\n&gt;  username/password along with the http request, but without adding this to\n&gt;  the URL. Can this be done, let&#39;s say can I just add some individual HTTP\n&gt;  headers or is there a better way to do it?\n\nWe&#39;ve done it as part of the application responding to the GET or PUT.\n\n\nHTH\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
