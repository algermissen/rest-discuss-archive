Indeed, it might not work all the time in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain situations. If you were behind (in terms of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DNS queries) a very restrictive DNS cache you might \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not be able to do dynamic names. \n\n&gt; As I understand it, you&#39;re discussing the ability to wildcard subdomain \n&gt; names, so the I can say *.anconafamily.com resolves to a particular IP \n&gt; address. (If that&#39;s not the case, please ignore this message!) I \n&gt; understand that a particular DNS server implementation might not provide \n&gt; that functionality. What I don&#39;t get is how an intermediate cache could \n&gt; break it. I would think that the wildcarding would be invisible from the \n&gt; cache&#39;s perspective. Can you fill me in on what I&#39;m missing?\n\nIt&#39;s tricky coz we&#39;re talking about implementation stuff here. The way\nnetwork admins implement stuff, not the way people implement specs.\n\nYou could have a DNS server secondarying a zone and not supporting\nwildcard zones.\n\nI&#39;ve got in the back of my mind that I&#39;ve seen this on someone&#39;s\nnetwork but I can&#39;t think whose.\n\n\nAnyway... we&#39;re quite off topic.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
