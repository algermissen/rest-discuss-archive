It at least\nrequires POST for add/delete/modify, so will avoid problems of doing\nso with GET (with caches and accelerators[1]).  But it&#39;s putting the\nreal operation name in the URI, which means that resource\nidentification isn&#39;t being done properly, and that makes it unRESTful.\n Hypermedia doesn&#39;t seem to apply to this API though (AFAICT) because\nthere doesn&#39;t seem to be much of an application there; but I might not\nbe looking closely enough.\n\n [1] http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast.php\n\nMark.\n\nOn 11/13/06, Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback on del.icio.us&#39; API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next I&#39;d like to ask: Is Feedburner&#39;s API RESTful?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/developers/feedapi\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, looking at specific APIs and diagnosing what&#39;s right and wrong with them helps my understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&gt;    \n\n"}}
