If everything in in\n&gt; your language&#39;s world view is an object you make synchronous method\n&gt; calls on, that is how you view the world.\n\nThis is patently true. Most of the language vendors don&#39;t give a fek\nabout multi-language. Most of them are language bigots after all. It&#39;s\nquite a common thing that, even among non-vendors!\n\n\n&gt; theory two: developers dont want to do distributed computing.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is my newer theory, and needs some expansion. Rather than say\n&gt; &#39;its the tool vendor&#39;s fault&#39;, I&#39;m now suspecting that the normal\n&gt; developer out there is quuite happy to pretend that everything is\n&gt; running on a single box. That is even if their gui is a web page,\n&gt; possibly a fancy AJAXy page, they still like to pretend that stuff is\n&gt; working locally. RPC-based IPC can maintain that illusion, even if it\n&gt; is just a big illusion.\n\nI think this has something in it.... but I think it&#39;s just that people\nhave not realized the leap they need to take yet. A lot of programmers\nare still way too over excited by the ideas of OOP to see the bigger\npicture of the web.\n\nSomeone earlier said the move to REST would be a once in 10 years kind\nof event. I think it&#39;s more like a once in 50 years... the web is the\nfirst really scalable distributed computing platform we&#39;ve\nhad. Before, people doing DC were just mucking about. Now it&#39;s\npractical and programmers have to catch up to that.\n\nWe&#39;ll wake up one day soon and everybody will be writing REST apps\nmore or less badly in just the same way that OOP happened.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
