Obviously there is some subset of the\n&gt; relational world for whom it is practical and feasible to separate SQL\n&gt; from relational. But the much larger subset spends their day working in\n&gt; SQL and need to solve problems in SQL. There are few proposed\n&gt; alternatives to SQL and their deployment costs would be massive. So you\n&gt; will not find many programmers outside of the academy who strongly\n&gt; separate theory and practice. The same is true of REST.\n\nTrue enough.  However, if I were looking to solve an SQL problem, I would\nlook for an SQL list.  If this list is for solving HTTP problems (as they\napply to REST), then it would make more sense to call this list something\nlike &quot;http-rest-discuss&quot;.  I had thought that this was a more generalized\nlist.  I was wrong.  I can accept that and move on.  :)\n\nTruthfully, I don&#39;t have any problem discussing HTTP as it relates to REST.\nI just have trouble learning REST by discussing REST as it relates to HTTP.\nI admit that this may be my own problem and no one else&#39;s.  I&#39;m just trying\nto figure out a way around that problem...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
