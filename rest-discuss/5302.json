As a service where the model itself can be observed and manipulated \n&gt; at the data level by other services, models and processing functions in \n&gt; the system. Clearly an XML representation would be used for this level \n&gt; of interaction.\n\n&gt; 2. As a web page so humans can view and manipulate the model via browser \n&gt; interaction, therefore we are talking an xhtml representation of the\n&gt; model.\n\nNot necessarily a different resource. You could simply add an XSLT\nreference to your XML resources and have the browser see the XML\nexactly as the webservice components see it.\n\nI&#39;ve used this model quite a bit myself and it works really well\n(saving problems with old browsers that don&#39;t understand XSLT).\n\n\n&gt; What I would like is a consistent interaction model across the 3 uses, I \n&gt; believe a RESTful approach can provide that (like things such as SOAP \n&gt; can&#39;t - I&#39;ve tried) and so I would like to leverage the best practices \n&gt; for doing this. I have no problem using content negotiation if that is \n&gt; accepted way to accomplish the requirements, I do tend to view content \n&gt; negotiation as a feature that has not been developed in a consistent way \n&gt; so I tend to be fearful of going in that direction but hey I am fairly \n&gt; new to all of this.\n\nI don&#39;t understand your argument about content-neg. It works very\nwell... you can do very tight accepts (mostly in webservice clients\nand servers) or you can do very lose accepts (like in browsers).\n\n\nAny other way of achieving what you&#39;re trying to achieve would seem to\nbe inconsistent with the HTTP specs.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
