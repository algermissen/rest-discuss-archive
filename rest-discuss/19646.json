I take this to imply that \ncommunication over a channel is in general one-way. Clients send events \nto servers (without a reply payload), clients receive events from \nservers.\n\nFor the long story: http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/\n\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve recently watched a presentation by Jafar Husain\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    http://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-reactive-rest\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; where he describes something he calls &quot;Reactive REST&quot;. I agree on\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;reactive&quot;, however I have doubts about the &quot;REST&quot;. In this\n&gt; &gt; particular case, all communication between a client and a server is\n&gt; &gt; over persistent connection to a single endpoint. If there&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; anything resembling resources, they are not identified by URIs. The\n&gt; &gt; persistent connection IMHO is a case of &quot;conversational&quot; state that\n&gt; &gt; REST is rather opposed to. No HATEOAS in sight.\n&gt; \n&gt; sounds like websockets (maybe not technically, but as the general\n&gt; idea). to me, REST is on a different level than this plumbing. in the\n&gt; same way as you can do REST and notREST over HTTP, the same probably\n&gt; applies to any of the alternative interaction styles. as you point\n&gt; out, REST has more (and more abstract) constraints than just the\n&gt; protocol that&#39;s used.\n\nI&#39;m not convinced that REST is on a different level. The reason is that \nI think that a persistent connection between client and server counts as \nstate that has to be managed by the server for each session. I&#39;m not \nsaying that this is bad by itself, it just seems to me not to be in \nkeeping with REST tenets. Which, in turn, wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a \nproblem, either. I&#39;m not interested in passing judgment, but rather in \nunderstanding how the commandments of REST and reactive interact.\n\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m pondering is whether an API can be RESTful and reactive at\n&gt; &gt; the same time or if is impossible as a matter of principle. AFAICT,\n&gt; &gt; a reactive API requires some way for the server to send events to\n&gt; &gt; the client. I don&#39;t think polling qualifies, which leaves a\n&gt; &gt; persistent connection. In effect, the server has to keep some\n&gt; &gt; amount of state for each session.\n&gt; \n&gt; not sure i agree that polling or long polling are the only (or best)\n&gt; alternatives. there&#39;s quite of stuff to be done in the area that i\n&gt; often refer to as &quot;reverse REST&quot;: clients subscribe, and then there&#39;s\n&gt; a push model. there are a variety of push protocols (PuSH, MQTT, APN,\n&gt; C2DM, sMAP) out there, but none so far has taken over the world.\n\nI don&#39;t know anything about these models/protocols. Do they work in \npractice at this time? In particular, if the client is a single-page \napplication running in a browser?\n\nMichael \n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
