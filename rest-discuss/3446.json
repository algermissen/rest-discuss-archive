In my head, they are not the same thing.  URI Media Types are just a\nway to make media type registration distributed, while XML Namespace URIs\nare used to mix multiple document parts within a single package.  Very\ndifferent usage to me.\n\nBesides... just think what this could do for XML Namespaces.  :)  Instead of\nusing the namespacing mechanism, one could define a media type URI to\nindicate the usage of a specific set of XML vocabularies.  As a result, as\nlong as this media type was encountered, element names, etc. would be\nuniform across *all* documents.  Then you would be able to have your\nregex-able xml.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
