And if they want to make this assertion on *today&#39;s web*\nthey use a servlet with query parameters. Of course for now the\nassertion probably has both prose and declarative components. The prose\npart is: &quot;you can plug in an email address from X&quot;. The declarative part\nis that the syntax of the parameter must be an email address. As the\nsemantic web progresses we&#39;ll hopefully move more of the semantics into\nthe declarative bit...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
