Our design would\nneed an ack specification, and DSN/MDN is a good place to start, but the\ninterface should probably not be canonical DSN/MDN.  ...need to read that\nspecification, which I haven&#39;t done, and see how generic it is.\n\n&gt; That isn&#39;t what I mean by reliability though. If I email you a purchase\n&gt; order for a million dollars of work, are we guaranteed that it will\n&gt; arrive once and only once? I don&#39;t think so. If the last packet of your\n&gt; SMTP response does not arrive then I don&#39;t know whether you got it or\n&gt; not. The only safe thing is to send it again. But then I might have\n&gt; purchased two million dollars worth of work.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
