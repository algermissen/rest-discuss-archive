Or would we have ended with a lot of HTTP horror? I don&#39;t\nknow. The world&#39;s data doesn&#39;t neatly fit in name/value pairs.\n\n\n    S&gt; ...\n    S&gt; RESTful and transactional without all of SOAP&#39;s plumbing.\n\n    S&gt; ...\n    S&gt; Message is processed (and in order) only if all external-bodies\n    S&gt; are present.\n\n    S&gt; Note: This protocol nests.  The commit message may itself have\n    S&gt; a transaction: yes header in which case it waits until someone\n    S&gt; commits the commmit.\n\nThis is so wrong, that I must assume you have not worked on enterprise\nlevel applications. I hardly know how to correct you, but I&#39;ll try:\n\n1. What if an entity I invoke, invokes other entities, and what if\n   they have transactions of their own? Are they in the same\n   transaction? A new transaction? Do they nest?\n\n2. What if an entity I invoke also sends messages? Are they in the\n   transaction as well? In what order?\n\n3. If the client goes down, is the transaction committed? Rolled back?\n\n4. Doing two or three phase commit at the client is really innovative\n   I assume... What do we need transaction managers for??\n\n\n    &gt;&gt; 5. Priorization.\n\n    S&gt; I am not sure what this means, but I suspect you don&#39;t want it\n    S&gt; because it violates the End-To-End principle.\n\nAbsolutely not! If I want to have certain orders served at higher\npriority, why should software prevent me? If I want paying customers\nto serve at a higher priority at some site, why not?\n\n\n    S&gt; PS The above protocols are entirely strawmen made to make a\n    S&gt; point and set us on the road to industrial stength variants.\n    S&gt; Please be gentle.\n\nMaybe I sounded a bit harsh, not my intention really. If you have not\nworked with transaction managers and the Corba/MTS (COM+) stuff, you\nmight not have a real idea what those can do for you and what problems\nthey try to solve.\n\nMy intention is not to defend what they are doing, or to deny there\nmight be better ways to solve it. But the issues they try to solve are\nreal, and they bring in a lot of value.\n\n-- \nRegards,\n\nBerend. (-:\n\n\n"}}
