I do agree that DELETE is invalidating the\nmapping (the mapping from representation to resource), not necessarily the\nresource.  However, if I were to issue a DELETE on an invalid identifier, I\nthink it would be legitimate to return a 404.  As RFC2616 notes, you could\nalso return 410 in this case (if the server bothered to keep track).\nCertainly 410 would be more accurate than 404, but either should be allowed.\nIn this perspective, the server is actually talking about the mapping.  As\nFielding was saying (I think), from the POV of the request, not finding a\nresource and not finding a mapping to a resource are just different ways of\nsaying the same thing.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, September 13, 2002 9:25 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] [fielding@...: Re: Resources always exist]\n\n\n&gt; So it looks like DELETE should not return 404.
