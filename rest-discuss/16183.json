In\n&gt;         theory, GET is always safe. No matter how many times you\n&gt;         download this web page, the contents of it will not change due\n&gt;         to your repeated downloads, since you cannot change the web\n&gt; page in that way. That sounds obvious, but if you build a RESTful web\n&gt;         service that uses GET in such a way as to modify any state\n&gt;         contained within a resource, then you have violated the rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this carries any weight...\n&gt;\n\nIt doesn&#39;t.  A resource is a temporally-varying membership function,\nsuggesting that it doesn&#39;t change across repeated downloads is just not\ncorrect.  What matters is the semantics of the resource mapping.  A\npage about dogs which contains a hit counter, is always a page about\ndogs, no matter if the hit counter changes over time, or what causes it\nto change.\n\nIf the user intent is to change the information about dogs which\nappears in the page, then GET is wrong, because the user intent is to\nreplace the existing page with another, and replacement semantics map\nto PUT.  If the resource is a collection of pages about dogs of\ndifferent breeds, and the user intent is to create a new subordinate\nresource, then the creation semantics should map to PUT.\n\nIf you GET /foo/most-recent, and that causes /foo/{id} to disappear,\nhave you changed the meaning of /foo/most-recent?  No, the semantics of\nthe mapping stay the same -- &#39;most-recent datum.&#39;  The user didn&#39;t\nrequest a change in the state of /foo/most-recent, the state of that\nresource just happened to change.\n\nWhat would be totally wrong, would be to remove /foo/{id} by making a\nGET request to /foo/{id}.  As it is, /foo/{id} can be removed by the\nserver at any time for any reason, as a response to a user action or\nnot, and this may (if it&#39;s most-recent) change the state of /foo/most-\nrecent.  That would just be &quot;how your system works&quot;, not using GET to\nDELETE.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
