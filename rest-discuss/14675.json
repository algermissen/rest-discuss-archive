It would seem to me that forms are an\nimportant part of hypertext navigation, and could be characterized as\na user-input-parameterized link, at least with GET-based forms.\nHowever, I was curious if others are in agreement on this perspective.\nIf a form is a type of link, why does HTML not define a &quot;rel&quot;\nattribute for forms? OpenSearch [1] also defines navigation to URIs\nthat are parameterized by user-supplied data, but it does include\n&quot;rel&quot; attribute. From a navigational perspective, is there any\nfundamental difference between HTML form and OpenSearch links (other\nthan that HTML obviously prescribes more of the presentation aspect)?\nIf forms can be viewed as link mechanisms, should this only be applied\nto GET-based forms, or can POST-driven user parametrized data also be\nconsidered a form of a navigable link?\n\nThe reason I ask, is I am trying to feel out if the approach in JSON\nschema, of allowing user-parametrized data submission [2] as an\nextension of a link definition is appropriate. With this approach,\nlinks can include additional information, extending them to take user\nprovided data to form URIs, and specify the request method. IMO, this\nis an elegant way of minimizing constructs while still allowing for\nURIs to be parameterized with user input like forms, but I wasn&#39;t sure\nif others felt this would violate any principles of REST.\n\n[1] http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1\n[2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-01#section-6.1.1.3\n\nThanks,\n\n- -- \nKris Zyp\nSitePen\n(503) 806-1841\nhttp://sitepen.com\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n \niEYEARECAAYFAktgkW0ACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAwykACdHO/ORNeFFy5g07rzy90MzPSr\nzPMAoJmmg/UQJizuvys79ULqWfKTKmlY\n=4uDy\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
