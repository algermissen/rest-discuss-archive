Its just totally unproductive.  The fact of the matter is the\n&gt; vast majority of the Web is a one-to-one relationship between client and\n&gt; server.  In other words, the Web is a simple system.  As a result you\n&gt; have a lot of simple answers to simple problems.  These integration\n&gt; problems are real and I think REST can solve many of them in a better way.\n&gt;\n\nAlmost all of the real web is based on a one-to-many relationship. Silos\nrarely exist on the web. We must all be glad to be able to use the web\nwithout needing &quot;global link registries aka RESTful UDDI repositories&quot;.\n\nThe integration problem is real, but the server boundary does not change the\nproblem very much. Does the client care if the resource it is accessing is\non hateoas.com or ulser.com as long it knows the semantics of the link, the\nmethods to use, security requirements, media types and so on?\n\nThe key is communicating and implementing the semantics.
