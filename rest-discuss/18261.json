One of the easiest ways to see that is when a =\r\nprotocol calls for the use of a generic media type (like application/xml or=\r\n application/json) and then requires that it be processed in a way that is =\r\nspecial to the protocol/API. If they are keying off of something unique wit=\r\nhin the content (like an XML namespace declaration that extends the semanti=\r\ncs of a generic type), then it&#39;s okay.&quot;\n\nIn the end it all boils down to th=\r\ne interpretation of link-rel-types and media types - which one tells the wo=\r\nrld how to interpret the semantic meaning of a resource?\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
