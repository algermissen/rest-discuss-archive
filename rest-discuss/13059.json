I suspect that you are talking\n&gt;         about adding links to an object serialized into XML is polluting\n&gt;         the representation. But is that polluting, or making the\n&gt;         representation contextual and more useful?\n&gt; \n&gt;         In any case, link headers and links in a representation body are\n&gt;         not always equivalent. For images etc., certainly link headers\n&gt;         are useful. But in XML cases, you can define more context around\n&gt;         link elements.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Subbu\n&gt; \n&gt;         On Jul 1, 2009, at 5:23 AM, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Sam,\n&gt;                 I don&#39;t disagree that there are use cases, but I am not\n&gt;                 sure if\n&gt;                 letting clients manage relations is the right way to\n&gt;                 implement\n&gt;                 distributed systems. The approach you describe below is\n&gt;                 similar to a\n&gt;                 client trying to setup foreign key relations between\n&gt;                 different\n&gt;                 database entities. This model leaks abstractions and is\n&gt;                 not ideal for\n&gt;                 writing large systems.\n&gt;                 For instance, take a simple shopping cart application.\n&gt;                 The server may\n&gt;                 have decided to use links to associate products to a\n&gt;                 cart, but that\n&gt;                 does not mean that, clients should be able to\n&gt;                 create/edit/delete those\n&gt;                 links. Instead, links come into being when the client\n&gt;                 &quot;adds products\n&gt;                 to a cart&quot; and they go away when the client &quot;removes a\n&gt;                 product from\n&gt;                 the cart&quot;. That is the right level of abstraction for\n&gt;                 the client.\n&gt;                 IMO, links are for servers to provide navigability\n&gt;                 between resources,\n&gt;                 and to let clients make state transitions via links.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             Let&#39;s leave aside the issue on whether to introduce LINK and\n&gt;             UNLINK. What about the value of Link headers themselves?  I\n&gt;             really like the idea of propogating additional metadata\n&gt;             about the resource without polluting the resource.\n&gt;              Sometimes you just can&#39;t modify the resource (image).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             Bill Burke\n&gt;             JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;             http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     -- \n&gt;     Bill Burke\n&gt;     JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;     http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
