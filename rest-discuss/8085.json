Your text/html with file paths is no different from \napplication/rdf+xml that contains OWL. RDF has the same problem as \ntext/* one level up.\n\n\n&gt; &quot;It has been very tempting from time to time for people to write\n&gt; software in which a client will look at a string such as &quot;.html&quot; on\n&gt; the end of an identifier, and come to a conclusion that it might be\n&gt; hypertext markup file when dereferenced. But these thoughts of\n&gt; breaking of the rule could lead to a broken architecture in which the\n&gt; generality of URIs is something one can no longer depend on.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Tim Berners-Lee)\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Agents making use of URIs SHOULD NOT attempt to infer properties of\n&gt; the referenced resource.&quot;\n\nI wasn&#39;t talking about guessing URIs; the URIs I had in mind tend to be \ndocumented - e.g. Zimbra&#39;s. I was talking about doing an end run around \nconneg altogether, hence avoiding your problem. It&#39;s far from clear that \nconneg has worked out in practice. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s because \nit&#39;s not properly supported or evenly deployed (eg like PUT) or is just \nsomething better left on the whiteboard.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
