It&#39;s not\nmuch of an improvement over doc style SOAP. Just being RESTful isn&#39;t\nenough to encourage widespread adoption. Yay: there&#39;s no verb in the\nmessage. Yay, they obey HTTP method semantics. Apart from that they\nboth wrap a document in an envelope.\n\nAs long as servers and clients have to agree ahead of time on complete\ndocument semantics they&#39;re forcing one another to lock in code at\ndevelopment time. But the aspect of the web that promotes independent\nevolution is the dialog that goes on between server and agent -- in\nparticular forms. Servers tell agents how to compose messages; they\ndon&#39;t agree on message formats ahead of time.\n\nI don&#39;t think APP is a failure. I&#39;m just saying you won&#39;t see\nsignificantly more &quot;programmable web&quot; using APP than you would have\nwith SOAP.\n\nDon&#39;t you start me talking!\n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\nOn 2/20/07, Andrzej Jan Taramina &lt;andrzej@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m getting a gut feel that Atom (both the format and the publishing\n&gt; protocol) is going to be very useful and used for\n&gt; many other things other than blog publishing.  It has some very\n&gt; interesting characteristics that make it a good fit for various\n&gt; integration scenarios, amongst other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Philosophically, it can almost be perceived as a simpler, easier, REST-\n&gt; oriented alternative to SOAP.   We may finally have something to counter the\n&gt; dirtiness that is SOAP, since Atom can be a very good enveloping mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of the current hype about Atom is about blogs.  Which might not be a bad\n&gt;\n&gt; thing, since it will keep other uses under the radar and in stealth mode\n&gt; (from the evil Corporate IT types who don&#39;t know any better ;-) ), till we\n&gt; have some &quot;but it just works&quot; deployments to show off.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious if anyone else is using/has used/ is considering ATOM and/or APP\n&gt; for other purposes, especially in the integration space?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrzej Jan Taramina\n&gt; Chaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\n&gt; http://www.chaeron.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
