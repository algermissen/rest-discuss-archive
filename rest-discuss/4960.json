That question is namely what\nis the best and most &#39;RESTful&#39; way to deal with a URI that might\nreference millions of or URIs.\n\nFrom a classic REST document\n(http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html) we get:\n\nhttp://www.parts-depot.com/parts\n\nwhich is a URI that is supposed to contain information about what a\nparts URI means.  The example GET response we are give is:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Parts xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot; \n         xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=&quot;00345&quot;\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=&quot;00346&quot;\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00346&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=&quot;00347&quot;\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00347&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=&quot;00348&quot;\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00348&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/p:Parts&gt;\n\nThis is fine for short lists of parts, but what if your company has a\nlarge set of parts, in the order of a million or more?\n\nSome of the workarounds I&#39;ve seen included means to break down the\nparts into smaller sublists that could be handled, or means to pass\nrange operators or search criteria into the GET.\n\nQuite of few people seem to suggest that &#39;your results may vary&#39; and\nthe developer should be free to develope whatever means seems\nsuitable.  Personally I think that if we shoul have a Best Practices\ndocument for this problem.  Does anyone know if such a thing exists?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
