People\nhave been busy modeling everything as a resource and now they\nwant to know how to do everything in a PUT or DELETE instead of\nany of the other HTTP methods.  That is wrong.  That is thinking\nHTTP is just a &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog.\n\nREST is not limited to GET, PUT, and DELETE.  Anyone who says so\nis just making things up as they go along.  REST is limited to the\nclient being told what to do next by the current state of where\nthey are now, aside from the entry point(s) we call a bookmark.\nThat is feasible because the set of methods is uniform, not because\nit is limited to CRUD.  POST is an equal party in the REST interface,\nparticularly when actions are being applied to the resources that\nare a composite of multiple source resources.  So is PATCH.\n\nDoing RESTful actions on multiple resources is no different from\nselecting multiple tunes in iTunes and using the info dialog\nto set certain properties across all selected tunes.  It is a UI issue.\nThe UI builds a set of actions to perform and then performs them\nin whatever way is most efficiently provided by the set of resources\nbeing operated upon.  If those resources (or, rather, the index to\nthose resources) say they can be operated upon as a group by POST\nof a selection form, then so be it -- that is perfectly RESTful\neven without the benefit of per-resource cache invalidation.\nLikewise for PATCH or PUT to a meta-resource, or PROPPATCH to a\nWebDAV resource, it is RESTful if there is some engine described\nby a representation provided by the origin server that instructs\nthe client on what to do next.\n\nThe goals are to remove coupling and maximize the number of\nreusable resources.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
