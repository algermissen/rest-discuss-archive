This link relation type should be a URI, and\nthat URI should expose documentation to that effect (as a web page)\nand it could also expose a JSON Schema document.\n\nThe other approach is to add a profile link to each of the resources\nwhich points to a URI which works much the same way as the link\nrelation type above i.e. inferring info/state/semantics.\n\nDoes that answer your Q?\n\nCheers,\nM\n\nOn Mon, Jun 11, 2012 at 4:19 AM, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; Using the examples in the draft, how does the client know to expect\n&gt; order info / state variables in the response?\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you see using something like the profile header here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent from my Windows Phone\n&gt; From: Mike Kelly\n&gt; Sent: 6/8/2012 4:25 AM\n&gt; To: hypermedia-web@...; REST-Discuss Discussion Group;\n&gt; api-craft@...\n&gt; Subject: Internet-Draft: JSON Hypertext Application Language\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently written up an internet draft for a general-purpose media\n&gt; type for linking based on JSON.
