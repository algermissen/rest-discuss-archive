Having said this, for machine-to-machine (rather\nth=\r\nan machine-to-human) communication, I&#39;ve never really liked HTTP.\nMostly pu=\r\nt off by early experiences with HTTP/CGI (inefficient and slow).\n\nMy main c=\r\nomplaint other than speed, is that in the an attempt to be a\nuniversal conn=\r\nector HTTP reduces everything down to the lowest common\ndenominator: &quot;Strin=\r\ngs&quot; - I&#39;ve blogged on this:\n\nhttp://pab-data.blogspot.com/2005/10/rest-not-=\r\nso-uniform-connector-example.html\n\nBut the truth is that the world isn&#39;t un=\r\niform. It contains differing\nrealms each with its own unique characteristic=\r\ns. So when accessing a\nresource in a given realm I would like to make assum=\r\nptions about the\nresource representation. The example I use on my blog is a=\r\n Squeak\nclient requesting a Squeak object from a Squeak server.\n\nNow not al=\r\nl the world speaks Squeak, so the URL could indicate that\nthe resource is l=\r\nocated in the Squeak &quot;Realm&quot;. If a Squeak resource\nisn&#39;t available then I m=\r\nay choose to dumb down to a more generic realm\nwhere I could possibly find =\r\na service offering a similar resource\nrepresented as XML (and suffer the pa=\r\nin of turning XML into a Squeak\nobject so that I can use it).\n\nThis way res=\r\nources are presented in the &quot;richest&quot; representation\npossible for a given r=\r\nealm. The opposite of the lowest common\ndenominator approach. A bit like th=\r\ne way people use &quot;Business English&quot;\nfor international commerce, but still r=\r\netain their own language and\nculture locally.\n\nThis idea also opens up the =\r\npossibility of using differing &quot;wire&quot;\nprotocols better suited to the resour=\r\nce representation in a given realm.\n\nI think that REST is theoretically pre=\r\ntty sound. What I&#39;m suggesting,\nis constraining the scope of connector unif=\r\normity to a given name\nspace (or protocol), thus allowing for &#39;local&#39; diffe=\r\nrentiation.\n\nAre people doing this? Or is there a good reason to avoid such=\r\n an\napproach?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
