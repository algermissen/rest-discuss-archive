There’s nothing about such an\narchitecture that would have any trouble modelling “Email this”\nlinks.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s not changing stored server state, it&#39;s just... well, it&#39;s\n&gt; just emailing this (where &quot;this&quot; is a stored mailing-list post,\n&gt; on the assumption that the requesting, logged-in subscriber\n&gt; didn&#39;t get it or accidentally deleted it, and wants to have\n&gt; another copy).\n\nRight. It is a request performed for its side effects.\n\nYou don’t want the client to be able to be able to disclaim\nreponsibility for those side effects, so it’s not a safe request.\n\nIt’s not idempotent either, at least in the usual implementations\nanyway: if you repeat the request, the server will repeatedly\nsend mail.\n\nTherefore, POST is precisely the right method for this.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s an imaginary resource with only a POST\n&gt; function (you can&#39;t GET anything that will meaningfully tell\n&gt; you it&#39;s already been sent or not), but that seems wrong\n&gt; somehow.\n\nWhy? A RESTful server is not a database or file system.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
