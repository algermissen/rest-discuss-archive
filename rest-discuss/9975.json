To this point, I have concentrated on supporting the Accept\n&gt; header as a way to allow clients to inform the server on what media\n&gt; type to use for the representation on a GET request. This all seems\n&gt; fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I am wondering how important (or common) it is to provide multiple\n&gt; media type support for POST and PUT. I would assume Content-Type would\n&gt; be used by the client to communicate this info. I would also assume\n&gt; that servers could respond with Status 415 if the Content-Type was not\n&gt; supported for the POST or PUT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any guidance or pointers to references on this topic are appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike A\n\nI would strongly discourage to use content-negotiation for authoring.\n\nLet the server return a Content-Location upon GET/HEAD; and use that URI \nfor modifying the resource.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
