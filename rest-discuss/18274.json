I didn&#39;t say that either. I&#39;m say=\r\ning there are design and\n&gt; &gt; implementation aspects of system interfaces th=\r\nat are not covered by\n&gt; &gt; HTTP. At some level developers (human beings) nee=\r\nd to communicate and\n&gt; &gt; reason about the software they write. Every web se=\r\nrvice provides\n&gt; &gt; information about something. Apart from the practical in=\r\ntegration of a\n&gt; &gt; client with a server we need to be able to discuss the &quot;=\r\nsomething&quot;\n&gt; &gt; rationale behind a given service.\n&gt; \n&gt; No. You discuss the r=\r\nationale behind service &#39;kinds&#39; and that is part of setting up the media ty=\r\npe. The kind &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess) defined in the media typ=\r\ne spec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service X of organization Y. All =\r\nyou need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; and then you say Accept: app=\r\nlication/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off you go. There is no need to =\r\ntalk about *that* service any further. The description of the service *is* =\r\nin the media type. There are *no* (thatis: none whatsoever) service specifi=\r\nc descriptions in RESTful systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Otherwise I as a developer won=\r\n&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if the information of a given service is of interest to me. Thi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; reasoning between developers (human beings) is at a conceptual level.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore software is not only meant for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; for humans to read and understand and reason about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right - but th=\r\nis is intent (&quot;I want to buy a book, therefore I direct my browser to http:=\r\n//amazon.de and not http://weather.info). No architectural style will help =\r\nto ensure the Amazon is still selling books tomorrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe the =\r\nterm &quot;conceptual type&quot; was unfortunate. My point in the\n&gt; &gt; discussion was =\r\nthat it may be of interest to talk about the concepts\n&gt; &gt; and information a=\r\n service is meant to provide in order to then be able\n&gt; &gt; to reason about w=\r\nhat media types to use or invent for a given service.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, &#39;entities&#39;=\r\n such as feeds, feed-entries, images, products, orders, contact-info (vcard=\r\n), events (icalendar) etc. surely are part of designing media types.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say it again: the problem that is being tried to solve does n=\r\not exist.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this your way of saying there is nothing to discuss?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Yes :-) The whole strict point of &#39;specific media types are a bad idea&#39;=\r\n is simply confusing people trying to understand REST. Maybe the discussion=\r\n is useful after all, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or are you\n&gt; &gt; saying there is no prob=\r\nlem in deciding whether to define new media\n&gt; &gt; types or not? My understand=\r\ning of the discussion was that we were\n&gt; &gt; discussing heuristics for invent=\r\ning (or not inventing) new media\n&gt; &gt; types.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing is, that it is a=\r\nctually pretty clear that generic media types + embedded specific stuff + a=\r\n new means for negotiating that stuff is silly because the mechanism for ne=\r\ngotiation such stuff is the media type identifier in the first place. It is=\r\n the mechanism built into HTTP for that purpose.\n&gt; (Not to question the use=\r\nfulness of standard general link relations orthogonal to media types, of co=\r\nurse)\n&gt; \n&gt; Specific media types is what one should do and there is no probl=\r\nem with them. Yet, some people make it sound as if there is a problem - and=\r\n this I find is adding confusion for others that try to learn REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ja=\r\nn\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /Paul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Paul Cohen\n&gt; &gt; www.seibostudios.se\n&gt; &gt; mo=\r\nbile: +46 730 787 035\n&gt; &gt; e-mail: paul.cohen@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
