For us this means creating some tests which exercise=\r\n particular workflows that a service supports (decision points are advertis=\r\ned through different rel values ins links).\n\nBy programming a client with s=\r\nome goal and rules towards reaching that goal, we can then let it loose aga=\r\ninst a service and watch as it drives towards a conclusion.\n\nWhat&#39;s been ni=\r\nce for us (and has demonstrated the value of hypermedia for describing busi=\r\nness protocols) has been that we wrote one set of tests per service (typica=\r\nlly in Java) whereas for illustrative purposes the book has multiple implem=\r\nentations of each service (Java and .NET typically).\n\nWe&#39;ve used both custo=\r\nm media types and common media types (especially Atom) for our services and=\r\n in either case our black box tests have worked, providing both positive as=\r\nsertions that services work, and have uncovered bugs in our differing imple=\r\nmentations.\n\nJim\n"}}
