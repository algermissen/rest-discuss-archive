At least it should help with the interpretation \nof the thesis, a sort of synthesis of the various explanations that Roy \ngave here in this list or on his blog.\n\nMaybe, it could go a bit beyond and collaborate with (or maybe lead) \nrelated efforts such as HTTP and &quot;Waka&quot; protocols. It could also \nidentify and rank the RESTfulness of so-called RESTful APIs, collect and \ndescribe best practices.\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n--\nRestlet ~ Founder and Lead developer ~ http://www.restlet.org\nNoelios Technologies ~ Co-founder ~ http://www.noelios.com\n\n\n\nAntï¿½nio Mota wrote :\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, Roy Fielding said (wrote) several times that there were parts of\n&gt; his thesis that he had to drop due to time constraints, so if he wanted\n&gt; to expand those missing parts, that could be a such a &quot;REST Project&quot;.\n&gt; But that can&#39;t come from the community, it has to be his personal\n&gt; decision, of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; codeblogger@... &lt;mailto:codeblogger%40ymail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Stefan Tilkov\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Here I have to disagree - I don&#39;t have any idea what an &quot;official REST\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; project&quot; might be doing.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I have to second Stefan. REST is the name for this architectural style\n&gt;  &gt; and with Roy&#39;s thesis well defined. Not much left to do. We/you could\n&gt;  &gt; further investigate architectures that are so to speak &quot;RESTful&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; (follow the style) - but we cannot call them REST. Hence a &quot;REST\n&gt;  &gt; project&quot; does not make sense.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Regards,\n&gt;  &gt; Nicolai\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
