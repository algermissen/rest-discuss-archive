One is to disallow access to a \n&gt; resource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let&#39;s say I send you a \n&gt; URL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect \n&gt; example). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a \n&gt; preference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a \n&gt; usability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for \n&gt; it and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.\n\nIt&#39;s worth being precise about this. Http-auth only disallows access \nto representations. It doesn&#39;t disallow access to resources - the \nURI is already to hand and anyone can attempt to GET against it. \nSecurity-wise this is a similar approach to ACLs - a handle is \nissued for the resource in question before it&#39;s been established you \nhave rights to interact with it.\n\nI suspect ACL-style access management is not RESTful, but I don&#39;t \nhave a compelling argument, just indigestion. Perhaps it&#39;s something \nto do with the security managers not being visible.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n"}}
