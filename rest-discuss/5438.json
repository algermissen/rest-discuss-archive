Take care not to assume one property is all-important,\n&gt;&gt; since that will blind you to the trade-offs inherent in principled  \n&gt;&gt; design.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, fair point. Here&#39;s my list of principles that constrain the &quot;as  \n&gt; possible&quot; side of simplicity:\n&gt; \t* interoperability/compatibility\n&gt; \t* extensibility/evolvability\n&gt; \t* learnability/usablity\n&gt; anything else you&#39;d suggest?\n\nThose are properties, not principles. I frequently get those\nmixed up too, particularly when I use generality as a principle. ;-)\nThis figure, for example, has constraints written in normal text and\nproperties in italics.\n\n     \n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ \nrest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9&gt;\n\nI would start with the set of properties in\n\n     \n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ \nnet_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3&gt;\n\nand perhaps add a few more, then figure out their relative importance.\nWhy &quot;learnability/usablity&quot; instead of visibility?\n\nPrinciples are found in most software engineering textbooks, and\noccasionally in patterns as well.  I glossed over them in my\ndissertation because the audience (Professors doing research\nin Software) would have been annoyed.\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I like the idea of specifying REST APIs simply as &lt;form&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -- if its rich enough for the human web, it ought to be rich enough\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for the machine-readable web.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST is an architectural style.  Please come up with a different\n&gt;&gt; name for your implementation so that you don&#39;t confuse the heck\n&gt;&gt; out of people like me trying to understand it.  REST cannot\n&gt;&gt; have an API.  XForms, SOAP, and XML over HTTP are technologies\n&gt;&gt; that can used with services that have an API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry about that -- I seem to keep getting yelled at from both sides.  \n&gt; :-)   Some people tell me &quot;it is just REST&quot; or &quot;it is just The Web--  \n&gt; stop making up names.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;ll take your statement as normative, and try to create a  \n&gt; distinguishing name.  I&#39;m still a little unclear on the optimal  \n&gt; terminology, though. I have started using the term &quot;REX: REST-Enabled  \n&gt; XHTML&quot; for my effort encode REST-compatible (?) URLs inside HTML  \n&gt; documents.  Would that help?  Or can you suggest something more  \n&gt; specific?\n\nIsn&#39;t REX the name of a computer language?  I usually talk about\nREST as a style and REST-based architectures as implementations\nof that style, so sticking to REST-based APIs that use XHTML\nis fine.  I suggest avoiding the use of an acronym or naming\nit after a loved-one (unless it is a pet turtle, which apparently\nhave no objections to such things).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
