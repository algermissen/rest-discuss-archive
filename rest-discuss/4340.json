What are the semantics of the missing elements?\n&gt; \n&gt; My argument --- cribbing earlier arguments with wiser folks than myself \n&gt; --- is that if partial representations are excepted, e.g. if \n&gt; /Users/joebob can take a form just containing elements id and ssn, that \n&gt; you&#39;re in effect not doing literal REpresentational State Transfer --- \n&gt; rather you&#39;re selectively invoking one of a set of polymorphic methods \n&gt; named POST where the size of the set is determined by the total number \n&gt; of permutations of required and optional elements, with dispatch being \n&gt; done by hand over that space.  Worse, some permutations may be legal \n&gt; and unamiguous, while other may be illegal, while others may be legal \n&gt; but ambiguous.  Ugh.  In doing this, you&#39;ve in effect undermined the \n&gt; compositional complexity benefit (the O(n) vs. O(n^2) argument) of \n&gt; RESTlike systems.  Not to mention made the dispatcher / validator&#39;s job \n&gt; combinatorially harder.\n\nAs you suggest, the same issue comes up with XML schemas.  Presumably, \nthe first thing that the server does with POST&#39;ed XML is run it through \na validator, so that you can keep manual validation coding to a minimum. \n  However, if the schema allows missing or blank elements in order to \nsupport these partial updates, a large chunk of the benefit of \nvalidation goes out the window.\n\nI think the thing to do is choose a limited set of the most common \nupdates that are logical and legal for your application.  Represent \nthose updates with unique XML records that have their own schema.  For \nexample, to update the user&#39;s name:\n\nPOST /Users/&lt;user&gt; HTTP/1.1\n\n&lt;UserNameUpdate&gt;\n     &lt;firstName&gt;...&lt;/firstName&gt;\n     &lt;lastName&gt;...&lt;/lastName&gt;\n&lt;/UserNameUpdate&gt;\n\n\nI don&#39;t think this is the best example, but I&#39;m working from what you \ngave me.  In reality the user record would be more complex, and you&#39;d \nprobably group all the contact information into a single update.  In \nother words, updates wouldn&#39;t be at such a fine grain.\n\n-John\n\n\n-- \nhttp:// ift ile.org/\n\n"}}
