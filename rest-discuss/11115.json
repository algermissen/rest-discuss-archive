Up to\n&gt; a point you can get by with dot notation in form key names, but\n&gt; your structural options are limited and it gets ugly quickly.\n\nThis is one thing I&#39;m wondering about - the tradeoff between domain \nspecific posting protocols and a generic carries-anything one like \nAtomPub. It seems in the read (non-posting), case, a preference towards \nsomething domain specific has worked very well for OpenSearch.\n\nIn particular this - I&#39;d like to have a way to update an individual \ndatum. A &quot;forms POST&quot; seems like a reasonable option for updates, given \n&#39;PUT everything back&#39; places pressure on clients to have everything to \nPUT back, and the various patch/delta/diff options that get suggested \nfrom time to time are (imo) very complicated.\n\nSo, if we go back to the the client controlled fields from early revs of \natompub, it seems they are the common case and could be updated via \napplication/x-www-url-encoded against the entry/mle using POST, which \ngives a clean split from PUT.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
