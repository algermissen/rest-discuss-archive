That sounds very intolerant even to me but \nthere are important principles that we&#39;re trying to encourage. A major \none is that there should be a single address space for objects so that \nany component can talk to any other component in a unified way. By the \nway, this means that I would only support Waka if I were convinced that \nit could completely replace HTTP or work beside it so seamlessly that it \ndidn&#39;t fragment the network.\n\nI&#39;m probably not going to convince you that most existing protocols can \nand should be collapsed into one address space and protocol and you \naren&#39;t going to convince me that the price is acceptable for the \nadvantages that the Jabber protocol (as opposed to the Jabber \narchitecture and implementation).\n\nBut there are certainly productives avenue of cooperation. Jabber is \ndesigned to go through firewalls bidirectionally and asynchronously. I \ncould imagine a gateway that would allow me to access an asynch P2P \nREST-based service running on  my laptop by contacting me through a \nHTTP-&gt;Jabber-&gt;HTTP proxy.\n\nUntil we&#39;ve got the pieces in place to do easy bidirectional, \ncross-firewall asynch in a designed-for-REST protocol, I&#39;m certainly not \ngoing to say anything against Jabber. If people are building and \ninstalling bidirectional asynch services I think that&#39;s a good thing.\n\nProbably HTTP could help Jabber in similar ways. Obviously there are \nalready some HTTP-&gt;Jabber bridges if only for tunnelling out through \nfirewalls, but I&#39;m not sure how sophisticated they are. Does anyone run \na service that allows Jabber URIs to embed HTTP URIs so that a &quot;get&quot; on \nthe URI?\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
