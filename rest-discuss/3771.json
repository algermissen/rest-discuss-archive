From a security point of view, you\n&gt; &gt; should assume that if your URIs are guessable, the attacker has\n&gt; &gt; already guessed them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, but from security point of view, you should not provide\n&gt; functionality to verify that &quot;guess&quot;.  That is why you simply\n&gt; get &quot;login failed&quot; instead of &quot;invalid username&quot; or &quot;invalid\n&gt; password&quot; when you try to login UNIX system (at least, recent\n&gt; ones).\n\nSome Unix systems do this in an attempt to protect users from\npoorly chosen passwords. It&#39;s like saying: &quot;Given that I know the\nsecurity is broken, what can I do to make things suck less?&quot;\nLimiting the login attempts does not make it infeasible for an\nattacker to gain illegitimate access to the system.  Obviously\nwhen designing a new system, the goal is to make a stronger\nsecurity model. The Unix login should not be your ideal. It has a\nrather notorious history.\n\n&gt; By returning 404 or 401, you&#39;re providing extra one bit\n&gt; of information.\n\n&quot;Leaking bits&quot; means that your security depends on an unguessable\nidentifier, but your implementation reveals some of the bits,\nturning the unguessable identifier into a guessable identifier.\nThe attack on SSL that was recently in the press is an example of\n&quot;leaking bits&quot;.\n\nRevealing a guessable URL is not leaking bits. Trying to hide\na guessable URL is just security through obfuscation.\n\nTyler\n\n-- \nThe union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\n"}}
