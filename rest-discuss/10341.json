Security departments would (correctly) freak out about\n&gt; thousands of servers running on a corporate network.  It&#39;s hard enough\n&gt; to keep up with the security patches and hardening of the handful of\n&gt; servers normally allowed to communicate with the outside world.  I&#39;ve\n&gt; never seen an environment that allowed for active FTP, for example.\n\nI like XMPP as a protocol for lots of reasons\n -tracks moving devices like laptops\n -lets you bond to servers whose IP addr is chosen at deployment\n -good libraries (smack) with debugging\n -nice integration with the GUI. Not as easy as going  telnet host 80\nthen GET something HTTP/1.0, but you can use the presence indicators\nto see if processes are there, and maybe send them messages.\n\nWhat you can&#39;t rely on is the firewall punch through working\n-unscathed- forever. It works today because IT havent noticed. Once\nthey do, if it is considered mission critical it will stay up\n(somehow), if not, it gets blocked. Its easy enough in an internet to\nchange the DNS settings for talk.google.com, or alter your proxy to\nblock the main IM servers. There are also commercial relay products\nwhich take that altered DNS/proxy settings and do a man-in-the-middle\non them, scanning attachments, maybe text. I dont know how they handle\narbitrary XMPP. I do know that a sufficiently organised corporation\ncan push out its own CA onto all its managed client PCs, so the\nbrowsers dont even notice that the HTTPS link is being intercepted.\n\nEnjoy the freedoms of XMPP while it lasts, and hope that we can come\nup with enough value for them that they stay open. Even if locked out\nfrom the outside world, installing OpenFire is fairly easy, there are\nsome SmartFrog components to do this and then let you talk between\nnodes using the protocol.\n\n-Steve\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
