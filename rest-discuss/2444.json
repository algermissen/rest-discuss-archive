Doesn&#39;t that effectively\n&gt; &gt;cripple the resource, upsetting the expectations of other clients?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; The server is free to reject the PUT request with something like:\n&gt;     406 Not Acceptable\n&gt;     409 Conflict\n&gt;     415 Unsupported Media Type\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, some readings of 2616 woud say that on a PUT, there&#39;s no \n&gt; transforming a representation to the existing resource type.   You&#39;re \n&gt; just storing the representation as is.\n\nIn that case, does the PUTted representation become the resource at that\nURI? If not, the implications are scary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So do you disallow certain types of representations from being PUT or \n&gt; &gt;POSTed? That certainly seems like a practical response to the problem.\n&gt; &gt;But I would think that in a very large proportion of cases, you&#39;d have\n&gt; &gt;to prohibit any type but the original type of the resource--in which\n&gt; &gt;case the distinction between resource and representation seems rather\n&gt; &gt;academic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Dont confuse a resource with the entity that backs the resource.  A \n&gt; resource is a logical construct - a concept.  A resource may be backed \n&gt; by a document, and the bytes that comprise that document may correspond \n&gt; exactly to the representation of the resource, but the resource and the \n&gt; representation are never the same thing.\n\nI&#39;m aware of the distinction, but I&#39;m questioning whether it has any\npractical value in cases where there is no transformation.\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
