User agents provide the interaction point between users and the application. They do this by\n\n- exposing information (e.g. render the content of &lt;title&gt; element in\n the browser window head or store the result of a link check run for\n a site in a database or file)\n- performing automatic transitions (e.g. GET an HTML inline image or\n recursively traverse links of a site for validation)\n- provide a means for the user to activate hypermedia controls\n (e.g. make links found in a page clickable, display forms)\n\nDoing all this requires in-depth knowledge of the media type and coding for all this requires in-depth, hard coded knowledge about the expected media types.\n\nIt is simply ok that browsers implement HTML and that AtomPub clients implement the AtomPub media types. It is also ok that Google&#39;s indexer likely understands all media types it knows to be in use on the Web.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There might be some public format you could use, but what if you need to define your own? Is there a way to do this so that a generic client could deal with it?\n\nThere is no point in doing that. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; The thought then occurred that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a standardized way to define a hypermedia format. For example, while everyone agrees what a link looks like in HTML, this is not the case for XML or even JSON (or YAML, or ...). Some blogs have been written about  this  and suggestions have been made, but as far as I can tell, no consensus has emerged.\n\nWhat is the point of making links generic (like XLink does, for example) aside from enabling the creation of generic crawlers? \n\n(Note that whatever the crawlers would do beyond traversing the links would require knowledge of the specific type anyhow).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And it&#39;s not only links, it&#39;s also parameters that aren&#39;t defined in a standardized way. For example, compare the definition of parametershere  (not containing info about types and default values) with the definition of parameters here  (includes type, default and is-mandatory info).\n\nWhat is the value of making parameters generic?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the question then is: Could/should we try to come up with a standard to describe a custom hypermedia format? I&#39;m not talking about a blow-by-blow definition of all available services and resources of a particular application, but about something one level higher up: For example, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could agree on THE standard way to describe a link in JSON? Or in XML?\n\nThere is XLink already - wouldn&#39;t it be nice if everyone would agree to *use* that agreed sdandard? :-)\n\n&gt; And then strive to always use this? One could then say: I&#39;m using application/json+foo for this (some custom format), but it follows the standard way to describe links and parameters.\n\nI agree that it would be useful to do the same things the same way in media type design (patterns) but we should probably start building media types before that :-)\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether this description itself can be formalized to the point where it is machine readable is another story. It would force clients to be a bit more generic, but would also allow for quick adaptations of a format if for whatever reason the standard doesn&#39;t quite fit. However, I&#39;d be happy to just know that there is an agreed upon standard way to define links, parameters and whatever else you need in JSON, XML and other &#39;base&#39; formats.\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider also that it would be very nice to point people that are new to REST to such a &#39;standard document&#39;, since this topic often seems to be very mysterious and odd them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought...\n&gt; \n&gt; Juergen\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://restx.mulesoft.org\n&gt; RESTx \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\nJan Algermissen, Consultant\nNORD Software Consulting\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\nWork: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
