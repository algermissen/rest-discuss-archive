But there&#39;s also serious disadvantages,\nsuch as messing up browsing (i.e. hitting &quot;Back&quot; doesn&#39;t remove the\ncookie), plus resource consumption on the server.  Obviously the pros\noutweight the cons for browsers.\n\nCookies are the way they are because they got deployed first, and they\ndid the job.  That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do better for non-browser based\napps, which was I was so disappointed to see the WS-I Basic Profile\nsupport them as a state mechanism.\n\n&gt; Why is it that nobody uses HTTP Auth? Regardless of the &#39;Basic&#39; auth-type\n&gt; being unsecure, why do so many systems use something else?\n\nAs you suggest below, I believe it&#39;s the lack of a UI.\n\n&gt; And why isn&#39;t there an RFC describing/standardizing current practice? The\n&gt; servlet engines I know have a servlet config for authentication called &#39;form\n&gt; auth&#39; which makes it easy to use POST to authenticate & then pass down a\n&gt; cookie.\n\nWell, that doesn&#39;t impact the protocol, so I don&#39;t know what value\nthere would be to doing that, other than illustrative.\n\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to describe a use of HTML FORM that indicated to the\n&gt; user-agent (the browser) that it was &#39;authentication&#39; information and then\n&gt; the browser could send it in the correct header? Or maybe a new HTML element\n&gt; like &lt;AUTH&gt; or something...\n\nYep.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.
