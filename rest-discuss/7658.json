E.g. merely reading a page.\n\nThe question at hand is whether that dogma shoudl or shoudl not be \nmodified to also take into account the sensitivity of the data in the \nquery string that is exposed in the browser location bar, the bookmarks, \nthe history, and other places.\n\nThe example of such data (and only an example) which I have offered is \na credit card statement. Accessing the statement requires providing the \ncredit card number, name on card, and so forth. This is sensitive \ninformation but the operation is not unsafe in the traditional sense. \nMerely reading one&#39;s statement is different than purchasing an item, \nwhich would be done with POST.\n\nIs there a legitimate argument that this safe operation should \nnonetheless be performed with POST for reasons of security?\n\n(If you don&#39;t like the credit card example, please feel free to \nsubstitute your own example of non-password sensitive data that should \nnot be trivially exposed to prying eyes.)\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
