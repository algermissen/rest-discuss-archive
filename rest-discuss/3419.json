There is\nnothing wrong with resources =\r\ncontaining other resources and updating\nthem all at once, as this is probab=\r\nly more efficient in many\ncircumstances.\n\nBut you&#39;re right, this may result=\r\n in the silent creation of resources\nthat you haven&#39;t explicity given URIs.=\r\n\n\nThis is the same mechanism I am using in an application that I&#39;ve \ndescri=\r\nbed here:\n\n  http://www.xefer.com/rebel/rebel.html\n\nI&#39;m using &lt;folder&gt; and =\r\n&lt;bookmark&gt; but the idea is the same.\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to be able\n&gt;&gt; to indicate=\r\n the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, \n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; the re=\r\nsponse I must return relates to the container, not its\ncontents.\n&gt;&gt; Also I&#39;=\r\nm not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be\n&gt;&gt; happening =\r\nhere - I have the URI for the box as part of the request,\nbut\n&gt;&gt; this reque=\r\nst affects other resources, which I can only address inside\n&gt;&gt; the message-=\r\nbody itsself, which just seems wrong.\n\n&gt;&gt; Rather than a big fat PUT to the =\r\ncontainer, you could split your \n&gt;&gt; request up in to a number of constituen=\r\nt requests to constituent \n&gt;&gt; resources.  for example:\n\n&gt; 1. PUT to widget/=\r\n33 changing the colour.  this would (or should?) \n&gt; update box/100 automati=\r\ncally because it has a dependency on widget/33.\n&gt; 2. POST widget/35&#39;s URI t=\r\no box/100 (possible after POSTing 35 to \n&gt; widgets).\n&gt; 3. DELETE 34.\n&gt;    o=\r\nr\n&gt;    PUT box/100 minus the mention of widget/34.\n\nI chose to support both=\r\n the cource-grained PUT and the finer-grained\nmethods\non each of the &quot;conta=\r\nined&quot; resources in the exact manner you&#39;ve\ndescribed\nhere.\n\n&gt; the trouble w=\r\nith the delete of 34 is that the semantics are\noverloaded. \n&gt;  the PUT to t=\r\nhe box that excludes the 34 really only removes it from \n&gt; the container, r=\r\nather than deleting it outright.  these are two \n&gt; seperate semantic action=\r\ns. \n\nThis would depend on the underlying datamodel of course and is entirel=\r\ny\nup to the application.  If a &lt;widget&gt; can exist as a standalone entity\nth=\r\nen you would probably be forced to implement the operation as a\n&quot;remove&quot;\nan=\r\nd force a &quot;delete&quot; to be done with a DELETE on the widget resource\nitself.\n=\r\n \n\n"}}
