Here\n&gt; he mentioned RSS as a web service and since RSS\n&gt; follows RESTian approach, I am wondering if RSS is\n&gt; really a web service or not. Please let me know if I\n&gt; am getting it right or not?\n\nThe term web service has no widely agreed definition. I think that \nTimothy&#39;s description is good:\n\n&quot;    * Any site with information and news lacking RSS support. Whether \nit is just assumed or simply overlooked, RSS is the most widely deployed \nWeb service across the Internet. Granted, most RSS feeds have very \nsimple interfaces with almost as simple backends that are unlike the Web \nservices that usually come to mind. (Who says Web services need to be \ncomplex or sophisticated anyhow?) Under the principles of the REST \narchitectural style that the Web was built on, RSS feeds do qualify. \nConsider that any site search engine becomes a Web service if it could \nemit results in RSS and the format&#39;s potential in the realm of Web \nservices becomes more apparent.&quot;\n\nHe&#39;s right, RSS has not yet been fully exploited and it is likely to be \nthe &quot;killer app&quot; for the integration of XML and REST until another XML \nvocabulary becomes big.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
