This has proved &quot;effective&quot; and\n&quot;sufficient&quot; for my work. In addition, it is &quot;desirable&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;,\netc. to my personal design sense.\n\nI have yet to find other ways to model this varying set of inputs\nwithin a response representation that are as (or more) &quot;effective&quot;,\n&quot;sufficient&quot;, &quot;desirable&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;, etc.  I am not at all interested\nin proving to anyone that they, too, should adopt my personal\nvaluation of this pattern for the same use cases I choose over any\nother patterns. I am also open to learning new ways to support the\nrepresentation of varying sets of inputs within a response.\n\nYes, varability introduces additional complexity. whether the\nvariability is &quot;needed&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;worth the effort&quot;, etc. is a value\njudgement each designer/implementor makes. This complexity may be\nexacerbated when a human is not the primary driver of the client and\ntherefore the presence of humans as part of the &quot;live evaluation&quot; of\neach representation is certainly a factor in making judgments about\nsuitability of a representation design (i.e. giving humans binary\nrepresentations to visual evaluate and interact w/ is proly\ninappropriate).\n\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jan 27, 2012 at 12:42, Mike Kelly &lt;mikekelly321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Fri, Jan 27, 2012 at 5:24 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Mike:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Certainly the mere _appearance_ of an input is &quot;useful&quot; is it not?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For what? Improving the evolvability of M2M applications in a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; significant way? I think more work is needed to prove this beyond\n&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt.\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;for what?&quot; how about &quot;hey, an input is expected here&quot;? for my work,\n&gt;&gt; this is &quot;useful&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; as to &quot;improving evolvability&quot; i can only assume what you are after\n&gt;&gt; here. for the work i do, the ability to include inputs when needed,\n&gt;&gt; have a client handle them (in whatever way that client deems\n&gt;&gt; appropriate) is adequate for the use cases i encounter. that is the\n&gt;&gt; only assertion i make.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i&#39;m not sure what is needed to &quot;prove beyond doubt&quot; unless you expect\n&gt;&gt; to me prove to _you_ that _I_ find them adequate for my use cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; How significant their impact on evolvability is in real terms.\n&gt;\n&gt; i.e. examples of changes in M2M application flow which are afforded by\n&gt; forms and cannot be achieved via a more simple control (i.e. &#39;basic&#39;\n&gt; linking).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As an application evolves over time, servers can add/remove inputs at\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; selected points in the user-agent&#39;s interactions w/ the server, too.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These decisions can be completely context dependent. For example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; selected users (admins) might see diff inputs than others (guests).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, this is mostly an &#39;aesthetic&#39; thing though, which would have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; little/no value to M2M agents. The server side still needs security,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and agents will still be built against a specific role.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; adding/removing inputs in representations may &quot;have little/no value&quot;\n&gt;&gt; for your use cases; i am not asserting to the contrary. i will say\n&gt;&gt; again, this has value for my use cases; do you want to convince me the\n&gt;&gt; opposite?\n&gt;\n&gt; No no, just to share my perspective on whether or not they do - in the\n&gt; hope that I can understand how, in practical terms, forms allow you to\n&gt; achieve interactions and changes to your system which could not be\n&gt; afforded with links.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; During certain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support writes) inputs could simply be removed from forms for a time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If this was modeled without forms - the client would simply provide\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the info which can&#39;t be processed but the server can just drop that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and deal with the bits it can, right ?\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; absolutely. i am not saying that modeling these cases with forms is\n&gt;&gt; the only/best way to do it. folks are free to implement interactions\n&gt;&gt; using any media type designs that they wish.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, I guess my point was that this capability doesn&#39;t really set\n&gt; forms apart, because this type interaction is already possible with\n&gt; links and relations.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think all of the above are important considerations, because\n&gt; introducing forms into your application places additional requirements\n&gt; on your clients.\n&gt; For many, reducing the barrier to adoption by making consumption of\n&gt; your application as easy as possible is important - so with stuff like\n&gt; forms it&#39;s worth weighing this against their benefits.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n\n"}}
