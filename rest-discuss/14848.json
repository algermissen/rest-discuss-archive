Does my SDK doc say &quot;if rel is EDIT then you can\n&gt; PUT to that URI.

I guess I am looking for a little help in understanding how best to\n&gt; describe this HATEOAS API to other developers that will consume it.. how to\n&gt; get them started, and how to explain each URI they can use at any given\n&gt; point and what methods they can use on the URI, what params, what body, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of a DELETE, if it succeeds.. it returns a 204 No Content. How\n&gt; then do you respond with any sort of links that it can do at that point? If\n&gt; it can&#39;t return any body, I can&#39;t return any &lt;links&gt; with it. I think we\n&gt; &quot;can&quot; fudge it.. but then I would guess it wouldn&#39;t be RESTful to provide\n&gt; any sort of body with a No Content response.
