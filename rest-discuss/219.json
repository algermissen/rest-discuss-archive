I was recently reading about entangled photons,\nand the word stuck.\n\n&gt; I like the &#39;collection/container&#39; based approach also, but was just pointing\n&gt; out a common alternative.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a thought - your &#39;good container design&#39; comment about a) mentions\n&gt; that a post in one causes a delete in the other. Does this imply that a\n&gt; resource that is a collection must/should be disjoint from all other\n&gt; addressable collections?\n\nJust MAY.  There may be good reasons for not doing this, but absent any\nrequirements to the contrary, I think this is a cleaner way to go.\n\n&gt; Does this imply aliases are to be avoided?\n\nBy &quot;alias&quot;, I assume you mean where a single resource publisher has\ndifferent URIs that identify the same resource.\n\nThat&#39;s a good rule, generally, no?\n\n&gt; If aliases or overlapping collections exist, and events are to be routed, an\n&gt; event in one would/should cause an event in the other(s)? If something is\n&gt; addressable, it is subscribable. If aliases exist, multiple subscriptions\n&gt; via the aliases and there should not be one &#39;preferred&#39; alias.\n\nThere appears to be words missing from that last sentence, but if I\nunderstand you correctly, yes, there needs to be consistent behaviour\nfor what a subscribe/unsubscribe means on aliases.\n\n&gt; Also, regarding uri &#39;parameters&#39; (which I have not read up on, so correct\n&gt; any and all misconceptions) - if these are unique identifiers yet guaranteed\n&gt; to informationally subordinate to the non-parameterized uri, then you have\n&gt; what appears to be an overlapping collection - with the &#39;parent&#39; resource\n&gt; channeling events for the &#39;sub-properties&#39;. The sub-properties may be\n&gt; available for fine-grained subscriptions (mini-filters) and the main\n&gt; resource is avialable for catch-all subscriptions. A bit\n&gt; stream-of-unconciousness, but I hope that made sense.\n\nEr, nope. 8-)  What&#39;s a subproperty?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
