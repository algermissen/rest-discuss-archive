Jorn:\n&gt;\n&gt; i think you did a good job of summing up the opinions presented here.\n&gt;\n&gt; since i don&#39;t run into this often in my current work (using a single\n&gt; media type and multiple &quot;vocabularies&quot; to represent the same problem\n&gt; domain details), i am most interested in the solution you end up\n&gt; creating. hopefully, you will be able to share not just the outcome\n&gt; (&quot;we decided to go with &#39;x&#39;

Thanks a\n&gt; lot to everybody who has contributed! Hopefully you now understand the\n&gt; problem :-)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The suggested solutions has been:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1) Mint a new media type.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Apparently there are two different schools here. Some say, yes, go\n&gt; for a new media type. Some say, no don&#39;t. And there is no agreement upon\n&gt; which is best. See\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18183 for a\n&gt; discussion of this.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 2) Use different URIs for the different vocabularies.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This seems like an easy and well understood solution. As Mike puts\n&gt; it: &quot;in my experience, attempts to do &quot;multiple things&quot; while using the\n&gt; same URI are not often successful&quot; (meaning, &quot;go for multiple URIs&quot;).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 3) Switch on a media type parameter in the accept header (as for\n&gt; instance &quot;application/xhtml+xml;profile=xxx&quot;).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; To me this seems like the most elegant solution - if it works. Some\n&gt; people argue that the &quot;;profile=xxx&quot; parameter may get stripped by\n&gt; intermediaries in the network. It has the advantages of minting a new\n&gt; media type, but none of the drawbacks since it is still a well known\n&gt; media type (if this is the right interpretation of the syntax!)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 4) Switch on other headers like for instance the user-agent.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Not a generally used solution.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 5) Use all vocabularies in the same document.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; To me this seems too clumsy.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; /Jï¿½rn\n\n\n"}}
