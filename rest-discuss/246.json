Yes, I think this relates to\n&gt; reliability quite closely.\n\nLet me ask this the way I asked Alex.\n\nIs there anything about this problem that is *cause* by the repeat-try\nreliability solution that would not occur in a system that had\ninherently reliable once-only message delivery? Even in a perfect world\nwhere messages are delivered once and only once you can get the phantom\nwrite problem. PUTting over and over again may increase the chances just\nbecause of time passing but the problem is essentially the same.\n\nIf I understand that correctly then I&#39;ll put in a footnote about that.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
