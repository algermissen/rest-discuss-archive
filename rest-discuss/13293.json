Choosing to\n&gt; have JBoss lead and own such an effort in a JCP-style way doesn&#39;t\n&gt; inspire me good things either.\n&gt;\n&gt; In addition, the &quot;REST-*&quot; naming is so uninspiring that it must have\n&gt; been suggested by a REST opponent! It reminds me of the attempt to\n&gt; describe the JAX-RS API as the &quot;REST API for Java&quot;...\n&gt;\n&gt; REST defines architecture principles, not protocols, not media types and\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even mandate the use of HTTP. The term &quot;REST API&quot; is already\n&gt; ambiguous but widely used as a shortcut for &quot;RESTful [HTTP] API&quot;. Please\n&gt; don&#39;t add confusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; In addition, I think that the idea of &quot;standardizing&quot; such RESTful HTTP\n&gt; APIs at this stage is just wrong and will lead to results similar to\n&gt; &quot;WS-*&quot; due to politics and market timing issues.\n&gt;\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t mean that proposing RESTful APIs for such problems isn&#39;t\n&gt; useful or necessary. As you know, there are already existing efforts in\n&gt; those areas and having more attempts at this stage sounds useful. For\n&gt; example, Google recently announced its PubSubHubbub effort:\n&gt; http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ \n&gt; &lt;http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, let the most popular media types (such as Atom) or RESTful APIs\n&gt; (such as Amazon S3) win and be leveraged by developers and supported by\n&gt; tools. Just don&#39;t lead people into thinking that there is or even need\n&gt; to be a consensus in the REST community on how to define such RESTful\n&gt; APIs, especially when you haven&#39;t even consulted it with your plans.\n&gt;\n&gt; My suggestion is that Roy quickly starts and leads an official REST\n&gt; project, maybe at the W3C or at IETF where important things engaging the\n&gt; REST community could be organized and decided. I&#39;m afraid otherwise that\n&gt; such a wonderful adventure will get side-tracked or harmed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jerome Louvel\n&gt; --\n&gt; Restlet ~ Founder and Lead developer ~ http://www.restlet.org \n&gt; &lt;http://www.restlet.org&gt;\n&gt; Noelios Technologies ~ Co-founder ~ http://www.noelios.com \n&gt; &lt;http://www.noelios.com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy T.

Message queues are a common integration\n&gt; &gt; technique for non-REST architectures. To claim that either one\n&gt; &gt; is a component of &quot;Pragmatic REST&quot; is the equivalent of putting\n&gt; &gt; a giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as\n&gt; &gt; if it were the latest fashion statement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The idea that the community would welcome such a pack of\n&gt; &gt; marketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply\n&gt; &gt; ridiculous.
