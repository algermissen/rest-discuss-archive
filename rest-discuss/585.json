Lots of things have been &quot;tried&quot; in HTTP at various points, and there is quite a bit of\nambiguity.  My own REST quest is to try to discern what the minimal, diamond-like core of ideas\nwithin HTTP actually consists of;  to figure out, to crib Paul, what the &quot;lambda calculus&quot;-like\nunderpinnings of the Web are for which everything else is extraneous, sugar, or damage. :-)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
