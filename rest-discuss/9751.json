REST, on the other hand requires\n&gt; fundamentally rethinking basic assumptions & design principles.\n\n“… in order to be able to reap the benefits that REST confers.”\n\nIn practice the RESTfulness of systems is a continuum; esp. if\nyou are implementing a RESTful system in terms of HTTP, whose\nuniform interface is not always quite exactly the shape you’d\nwant. (This has nothing to do with the critique usually levelled\nagainst REST that you can’t express complex systems in terms of\nresources; you can. It’s just that HTTP as she is spoke would\nsometimes require you to decompose things as resources that you’d\nreally want to be part of the uniform interface; cf. PATCH for an\nexample of such a case.)\n\nAnd so sometimes the pragmatic thing *with HTTP* can be to\nviolate the uniform interface around the edges.\n\nThe essence of REST is that having done things in a certain way,\nyou get a system that has various desirable properties. (By\ntrading some others for those.) If you haven’t, you don’t. In\npractice this means tradeoffs; not in every aspect of an app are\nthe benefits of a RESTful design as useful as in others.\n\nThis does *not* mean you should break the constraints left and\nright. The default should be to respect them. The great thing\nabout REST, however, is that it gives you a systematic way to\nreason about the properties of a system. It provides a formal\nbasis for understanding the consequences of various tradeoffs,\nso you can make decisions in awareness of their costs.\n\nAs for “REST is simple, not easy”, that is correct, but the\nstatement always feels weird to me, even a little disingenuous. I\nwould say that REST is a bit of a red herring in there; the point\nis that *system design* is not easy. REST does not relieve you of\nthat, but then neither can TSOA or any other approach. But REST\nconstrains systems, so in some senses it does make designing them\neasier, if not easy. Because of loose coupling it also makes\ncertain things manifestly easier. It’s just isn’t magie pixie\ndust that can do your job for you.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
