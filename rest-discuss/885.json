The \n&gt; third meaning that we&#39;re still negotiating the deal.\n\nIf I&#39;ve followed the discussion so far, all of those are states of a\nresource, and so should be carried over 2xx responses.  Just as HTTP&#39;s\nmethods apply to all resources, so does its response codes - they\nhave to remain generic.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
