If you put extensions in, to *any media type*,\n&gt;&gt; via either\n&gt;&gt; &gt; new markup or even changing the meaning of standard atom\n&gt;&gt; markup, you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; should change media types, because it is the media type\n&gt;&gt; which names /\n&gt;&gt; &gt; describes the preferred semantics of the message, and it is the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; message metadata which is the most authoritative on the web:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not the case. It may well be the case for some -\n&gt;&gt; text/plain comes to mind - but the majority of widely used\n&gt;&gt; media types are designed well enough to accommodate\n&gt;&gt; non-breaking extensions (where their introduction doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; affect the meaning of the core content).\n&gt;\n&gt; IOW when served with that media type messages are understood as that\n&gt; media type.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt;  If a client/processor is looking for the extended semantics\n&gt; how does it request them?\n\nIt doesn&#39;t, in general. If the extensions are standardized and have\nvalue to the publisher (usually determined by the quantity/quality of\nconsumers), then the publisher will probably just provide them for\neverybody since they&#39;re not interested in dealing with the complexity\nof customizing responses for the specific needs of each client (again,\nin general).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That said, there&#39;s some ambiguity here with regards to when\n&gt;&gt; it makes sense to use a different (or new) media type. An SVG\n&gt;&gt; document wrapped in &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot; wouldn&#39;t be very useful\n&gt;&gt; served with the text/html media type, for example.\n&gt;\n&gt; ??: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_svg.asp\n\nHuh. Well, that example served me much better 10 years ago before\ncompound document features percolated to the mainstream. Though the\npoint remains for the moment, as I doubt all SVG clients are\nHTML5-enabled in this way, meaning that as an SVG publisher (and that\nsample document is, for all intents and purposes, SVG) I should still\nbe using image/svg+xml.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But an\n&gt;&gt; Atom document with a single entry extension from a foreign\n&gt;&gt; namespace is still an Atom document because the spec\n&gt;&gt; specifically accommodates such an extension; it should use\n&gt;&gt; application/atom+xml.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that it _can_ use application/atom+xml, but in order\n&gt; to convey extended semantics, paging for example, it would need to\n&gt; use a different media type, application/atom+xml;type=feed in the\n&gt; paging case.\n\nThat&#39;s the same media type; application/atom+xml in both cases. The\nuse of a media-type-specific parameter doesn&#39;t change the type. IIRC,\nJames Snell wanted a separate media type for Atom feeds vs. entries\nand I came up with the compromise of the type parameter just so it\ncould be safely ignored in this way (or perhaps somebody came up with\nit and I supported it, not sure).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In between those two extremes, the\n&gt;&gt; decision depends upon the specifics of the extensibility\n&gt;&gt; features of the\n&gt;&gt; type(s) in play, the importance and quantity of extended vs.\n&gt;&gt; core content.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think its a question of quantity, more of importance.  And importance\n&gt; is subjective.\n\nAgreed, but IME, there&#39;s usually a correlation with quantity.\n\n&gt;  If the extended semantics is important to a client,\n&gt; it will be requested, with Accept:.  If not, it won&#39;t. But if the\n&gt; extended semantics is just served with no signals for desire or of\n&gt; delivery, and clients actually do end up using the extended semantics,\n&gt; that is out-of-band coupling of the nth degree IMHO.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Only the publisher knows what the content means, so they get\n&gt;&gt; to decide which media type to use.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe that it is the published definition of the media type which is important,\n&gt; not the content.  A jpeg of my cat is not the same content as a jpeg of a supernova,\n&gt; but they both may have the same media type definition.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the application tree,  application/json or application/xml\n&gt; would be sufficient for almost everything.  But they aren&#39;t, so we invent new\n&gt; media subtypes to describe the markup.  Atom is one, but I don&#39;t think\n&gt; it stops there, not by a long shot.\n\nWell, those two types aren&#39;t sufficient, but for different reasons\nthan what I think you&#39;re talking about (search the archives for\napplication/xml)\n\nMedia types are not a type system of arbitrary granularity for your\napplication, just a simple, very coarse-grained way to associate some\ncontent with a specification for its interpretation. You can of course\ndefine them as granular as you like, but the less general they are,\nthe less appealing they are to support.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
