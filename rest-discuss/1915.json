I believe a resource can be defined in terms\n&gt; of the history of that resource and not just some static data values\n&gt; somewhere.\n\nI agree. Here is the way I think about it: if you make a POST operation\nwith side effects and some stupid client calls it a million times, any\nside effects are THEIR fault. If you make a GET operation with side\neffects and some stupid client calls it a million times, any side\neffects are YOUR fault and YOUR problem. If you don&#39;t mind a massively\ninflated hit counter then go ahead, use GET. If it is important to\nmaintain an accurate count of intentional client actions, then use POST.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
