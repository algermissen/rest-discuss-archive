Neither &quot;?&quot; nor &quot;#&quot; belong to  \n&gt; =\r\nthe HTTP layer. Those are part of RFC 3986, and the fact that browsers  \n&gt; =\r\ndon&#39;t send the part of the URI after the &quot;#&quot; separator to servers is  \n&gt; di=\r\nctated by the media type (primarily the HTML family).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Subbu\n\n=\r\nThanks for your thoughtful reply.\n\nI am not reading too much into this.\n\nI =\r\nam not sure what you are saying, other than that you are saying incorrect i=\r\nnformation.  There is URIs mentioned in the HTTP spec, and there is the HTT=\r\nP URI scheme.  The HTTP URI scheme does not say anything about fragment ide=\r\nntifiers.\n\nLikewise, you will note in the practical sense of &quot;what to expec=\r\nt in real world implementations&quot;, that Search Engines do not index content =\r\nafter the #.  This imposes a real world practical limitation on real world =\r\nuse.  However, Google killing the question mark is huge.  This kind of open=\r\ns the door, just a crack, about the idea of Google having to require its Si=\r\ntemap technology be able to understand fragment identifiers.  In hypermedia=\r\n theory, this means we can finally start building Web applications with &quot;op=\r\nen linking&quot; and &quot;deep linking&quot;.\n\nAs a separate matter, I do not understand =\r\nhow one can say my points are over reading this, when there is an unproduct=\r\nive thread about renaming HATEOAS with another acronym, that has 56 replies=\r\n and counting.  Um, priorities, people?\n\nIf anything, I think what I am say=\r\ning here is what I would hope Gartner&#39;s think tank would be focusing its en=\r\nergy on.  Unfortunately, I have to face the realities that some people find=\r\n a simple idea like REST so complicated that the best solution is to confus=\r\ne them with even more acronyms with empty meanings.  Gartner&#39;s clients expe=\r\nct power points with those kinds of things.  I get that.\n\nI guess I am just=\r\n using REST to build real applications and not simply writing about REST fo=\r\nr the sake of writing about it.  I&#39;m not a client looking for stuff to stic=\r\nk in a PowerPoint presentation to show my boss.\n\n\n"}}
