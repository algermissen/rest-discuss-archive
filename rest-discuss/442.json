Mail to david@...\nis handled by the MX record for ascher.com not by\nany host named ascher.com.\n\n&gt; If we&#39;re going to start putting email addresses there, why not use the\n&gt; Cache-Control or Expires headers (or any other header not named From)?\n&gt; None of them support email addresses either.\n\nThe expires field value is required to be a date.\nCache control has similar, though more complex\nrestrictions and does not seem to support the\nbehavior described.\n\nSince this host header behavior seems to be\nimplemented universally and is consistent with\nthe meaning of the spec, I don&#39;t see a problem.\nIf it is, why does everything seem to implement\nthis behavior?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

Let&#39;s first discuss how REST,\n&gt; HTTP, and URIs can do it *without extension or additional a priori\n&gt; agreement*.  If that fails, then we can consider extensions, abuse,\n&gt; or both.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That doesn&#39;t make sense.  The client does not know\n&gt; &gt; in advance that the server requires\n&gt; &gt; authentication.
