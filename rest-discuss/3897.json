If you are defining different meanings for these methods you \n&gt; are violating HTTP.  MoST is just the observation that HTTP is good. \n&gt; Neither MoST nor HTTP says anything about the behavior of agents that \n&gt; interact with those resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.

I have to admit that i don&#39;t really\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understand. You have to define a format that is suitable for any kind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of application. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; representation to be self descriptive, but you still have to define (ou\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; refine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bill? said).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; See my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to  define your entire application from the client&#39;s perspective.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept\n&gt; &gt;&gt; header, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; container.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST means\n&gt; &gt;&gt; add an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container; messages\n&gt; &gt;&gt; must be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If the server returns a container in response to a GET without an Accept\n&gt; &gt;&gt; header, the resource is a container and not an index.  That means the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of POST should be with respect to the container and not an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; index.  In other words, if the resource is a container, then POST means\n&gt; &gt;&gt; add a  message to the container and can at your option affect an index.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Messages  are stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; constrains the  server from providing an index in response to a GET with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a an &quot;Accept:  text/x-yannick-index&quot;, but that is really beside the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
