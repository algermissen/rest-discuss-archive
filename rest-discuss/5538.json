I&#39;ve been through more than half\nof it. It is =\r\nfairly thick and there is some content I don&#39;t specifically\nneed. On the ot=\r\nher hand it is first out of the gate and well above\naverage for software bo=\r\noks in my opinion.\n\nPragmatic Ajax, published but not authored by those Pra=\r\ngmatic\nProgrammers (whose books tend to be above average as well) is availa=\r\nble\nas a beta PDF. I bought this and have been through more than half with\n=\r\nthis too. The beta copy has been upgraded once so far. Not sure of the\nfina=\r\nl publication date. This book is smaller and in its current form not\nas com=\r\nplete as the AiA book. Even the content that is covered has some\nwholes in =\r\nit yet to be filled.\n\nEven so it is worth owning the beta copy and tracking=\r\n updates. And I\nthink it is worth owning both of these books.\n\nI am not a J=\r\navascript programmer. I may have written a few dozen lines\nof JS before get=\r\nting interested in Ajax. So I have found other\nJavascript, CSS, and XHTML b=\r\nooks and info to help apply the lessons of\nthe Ajax books into my own examp=\r\nles. I have found the &quot;Visual\nQuickstart&quot; books for Javascript (5th edition=\r\n) and for DHTML to be\nuseful for this. The format is good for getting to ba=\r\nsic, short examples\non specific topics.\n\nHey, publishers: a &quot;visual quickst=\r\nart&quot; approach to more advanced Ajax\nscenarios would be really useful.\n\n-Pat=\r\nrick\n\n\n"}}
