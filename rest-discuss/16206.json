Especially I am\n&gt;&gt; wondering whether it is enough for the user agent to say\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Accept: application/atom+xml;type=feed\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; or whether the Accept header should include the user agent\n&gt; capabilities\n&gt;&gt; regarding the individual order entries, e.g.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Accept: application/orderlist\n&gt; \n&gt; I consider media types as syntax, not semantics. If\n&gt; application/orderlist really has different syntax than\n&gt; application/atom+xml, then, OK I guess. But it probably shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; Instead, the semantics of the resource are described by the @rel\n&gt; attribute the user-agent discovered and followed (in combination with\n&gt; data and its arrangement in the response, including further links in the\n&gt; response). Your resource could just as easily return &quot;text/html&quot; with\n&gt; the same semantics and, if the client understood HTML, could be\n&gt; processed meaningfully, in which case the client would emit &quot;Accept:\n&gt; application/atom+xml, text/html&quot;.\n\nThe question is whether Accept: text/html is indeed sufficient. Is it true that the user agent can persue its implemented goal of compiling a list of all newly ordered items from any HTML document?\n\nSuppose the server provides both, application/order and text/html as representations of the list of new orders. When a user agent comes along that says Accept: text/html the server can freely assume browser-like capabilities of the user agent (any HTML will do; even an &lt;ul&gt; with items referring to scanned PNGs of the orders). IOW, the owner of the server is free to change the implementation for text/html as long as a) the resource semantics remain stable (list of new orders) and valid HTML is returned.\n\nHow would the user agent implementation deal with HTML? Special syntactic assumptions are not allowed (because of Accept: text/html) or would mean a hidden coupling. How would a user agent distinguish between an HTML it does not understand but that contains orders (e.g. the list of scanned order images) and an empty list of orders that is augmented with some HTML it does not (and need not) understand?\n\nIMO that is impossible and hence Accept: text/html does not cut it.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, the Accept header says, &quot;these are the representation\n&gt; formats I am prepared to parse for a resource of the &#39;new-orders&#39;\n&gt; relation&quot;. A media type of &quot;application/orderlist&quot; *can* be used in that\n&gt; way, but couples too tightly, IMO. There are plenty of &quot;list-y&quot; media\n&gt; types out there already--does a list of orders really differ\n&gt; significantly in structure (not just differ in @rel&#39;s) from a list of,\n&gt; say, sale items? Atom has succeeded, IMO, because it is specific in\n&gt; syntax (&quot;feed&quot; = list of items in order, with some fixed fields) and\n&gt; generic in semantics (doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re listing). I wrote Shoji\n&gt; [1] because I wanted to hit that sweet spot for a &quot;catalog&quot; syntax\n&gt; (entities and overlapping lists of entity URI&#39;s) that was independent of\n&gt; the semantic--I wrote it for Etsy procurement, but it could equally be\n&gt; used for representing scientific lab work. If the syntax fits, wear it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Robert Brewer\n&gt; fumanchu@...\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.aminus.org/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-01.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
