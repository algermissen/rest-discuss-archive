If I want to create a=\r\n new customer instance, I could POST a representation of that customer to t=\r\nhe collection resource. The server returns a &quot;201 created&quot; and the URI of t=\r\nhe new customer instance, maybe &#39;/customers/1234&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now let&#39;s say I need=\r\n to update this particular customer entity with new information. I could PU=\r\nT the new description to the instance URI or I could POST it. Since &#39;/custo=\r\nmers/1234&#39; is not a collection resource there is no ambiguity about what I =\r\nwant: Update this particular customer instance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a problem with=\r\n that approach? Wikipedia&#39;s helpful article about REST says that a POST in =\r\nthat particular case should mean &quot;Treat the addressed member as a collectio=\r\nn in its own right and create a new entry in it.&quot; But - at least in my case=\r\n - if I would ever have to have a collection within the customer, I would h=\r\nave given it its own URI, such as &#39;/customers/1234/contacts&#39;. Therefore, it=\r\n&#39;s clear from the context that the customer entity itself is not a collecti=\r\non and never will be.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, is there any particular danger in interpretin=\r\ng PUT and POST in the same way in this particular instance?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or maybe a =\r\nbit broader: Is there a problem with taking the context into account when l=\r\nooking at the meaning of PUT and POST?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
