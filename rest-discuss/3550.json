A URL is not a container.\nRelationships between URLs are entirely client and\napplication driven.  If you think that one URL\ncontains another, specify that in some RDF\ndocument.  And when you do, you need need to\nprecisely specify the meaning of this containment\nrelation:\n\n1. Does deleting a container without first\n   deleting its contents result in a 50x error?\n2. Does deleting a container also delete all of\n   its contents and disable any further\n   GET/POSTs to the URL?\n3. Does deleting a container simply empty its\n   contents but allow further GET/POSTs to\n   the URL?\n[Note: these are equivalent to the issue of\nreferential integrity and cascading deletes from\nthe RDBMS world]\n\nDELETEing a URL should simply mean that you can no\nlonger GET or POST to it.  Adding arbitrary side\neffects just makes it more complex to interact\nwith your application.\n\nNote: It would be great to solve the referential\nintegrity problem for the web, but I think that\ngoes WAYYY beyond the scope of this discussion.\n\nNote: If you don&#39;t want the overhead of\ndownloading all the URLs in the collection and\ndeleting them one by one, you probably need the\ncontainer to handle a POST whose body is &quot;delete\ncontents.&quot;  But handling this sort of message is\nreally an optimization and all the warnings about\noptimizations apply here.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

DELETE seems to work against the mapping of resource to\n&gt; representations, not against the mapping of identifier(s) to resources,\n&gt; as would be the case above.\n&gt;\n&gt; The linking and unlinking of identifiers to resources seems to be\n&gt; solely in the domain of the authority, not something exposed through\n&gt; the methods of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; WM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
