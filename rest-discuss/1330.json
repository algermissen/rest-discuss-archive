In other words, how will I recognize a REST service when I see\n&gt; one?\n - addressable resources\n - uniform interfaces that apply to all resources\n - stateless messages\n - &#39;representations&#39; - multiple content types accepted or sent\n\nIf you&#39;ve already moved past the &quot;rpc doesn&#39;t scale&quot; arguments, these and\nother aspects of Roy&#39;s paper have more meat. Perhaps JeffB and MarkB would\nlike to update the front page to clarify the issues you brought up.\n\n\n\n"}}
