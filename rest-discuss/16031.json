I do know that not al=\r\nl people in Google are top geniuses. It is not true they handle all the con=\r\ncepts at theory purism, simply because they use a more practical approach, =\r\ndoing what works. I have also notice, sometimes, they mention nice words th=\r\nat are conceptually wrong. It happened when they published the Chrome carto=\r\non. Did someone noticed the conceptual flaw of Virtual Machines they had?\n\n=\r\nAnyway, here are a couple of notes I took. I will answer Antonio&#39;s concerns=\r\n in his thread.\n\n&quot;Interesting.\nInstead of getting the full resource, allow =\r\ngetting partial resources.  Humm.\nIs there a problem with getting on the fl=\r\ny representations that are just those fields?\nCan we think of a resource wi=\r\nth individual fields as collections with the actual fields being resources?=\r\n\nSame for the update. Just use POST.\n\nAn XML resource? Or is it an XML repr=\r\nesentaion of resources?\n\nXML and JSOn? Requesting a representation in the U=\r\nRL?\n\nJust the idea of adding a method parameter is new? My God, Roy has bee=\r\nn awfully angry against all those APIs that have the exact same format and =\r\ncall themselves REST. Please, someone invite these Google guys to this list=\r\n.\n\nLet see some flawed concepts:\n1. &lt;Resources are XML&gt;. A resource is anyt=\r\nhing, and you work with representations of the resource\n2. &lt;Representation =\r\nselection is not on REST&gt;. Actually, it is part of the protocol, and the pr=\r\notocol is not just the URL as they seem to assume (did they mention headers=\r\n anywhere in the presentation?).\n3. &lt;Resources are verbose&gt;. Aha. Of course=\r\n we can have a resource representation that has just the info we need. That=\r\n is nothing new. What is wrong is thinking resources are just XML and thus =\r\nverbose by nature.  \n4. &lt;Modifying a resource requires to download the full=\r\n resource first&gt;. Why so? To rotate an image you have to do it in the clien=\r\nt? An image is not just pixels, it is also metadata. We can get the image m=\r\netadata, change it and post it back. Server may update representations. The=\r\n resource it the same.&quot;\n\nAnd I had to go, the idea is to clearly state that=\r\n is a pragmatic approach based on misconceptions, that adopts an RPC style =\r\nthat should not be called RESTful anymore. Just as many other APIs over the=\r\nre.\nCheers.\n\nWilliam Martinez\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Suresh=\r\n&quot; &lt;sureshkk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I came across a old (May 2010) present=\r\nation from Google which talks about how Google designs APIs for public APIs=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/how-google-builds-ap=\r\nis.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Google seems to be proposing an RPC style with REST to overcom=\r\ne some of the limitations of REST, especially APIs for imperative statement=\r\ns i.e augmenting REST with custom verbs. One of the examples cited in the p=\r\nresentation is rotating an image in flicker and the author claims using RPC=\r\n style is natural and works better than just using REST.
