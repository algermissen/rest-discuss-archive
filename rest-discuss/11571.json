Perhaps even more application  \n&gt; neutral\n&gt; than HTTP itself, since SOAP is little more than a framework for an  \n&gt; XML\n&gt; envelope with completely open ended XML header processing. It is  \n&gt; extremely\n&gt; application neutral. The problem is, interface designers take the  \n&gt; incredibly\n&gt; generic SOAP format and put an incredibly application specific XML  \n&gt; payload\n&gt; inside it. That&#39;s like stepping of a neutrality cliff -- from  \n&gt; extremely\n&gt; generic to extremely specific in one step.\n\nIt didn&#39;t help SOAP to be layered on top of HTTP, which it really  \ndidn&#39;t need since the design goal behind SOAP was to redo everything  \nthat HTTP did, but better.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case, it  \nbecame technology in search of a problem.\n\nBut getting back to the statement of &quot;application neutrality.&quot;  That  \nsounds nice, but what does it mean?  So far, we have determined that  \nHTTP and SOAP are application neutral.  What about XMPP, RTSP, SMTP,  \nTCP/IP, and pretty much anything else that acts as an envelope?  When  \nand where does something go from being neutral to being specific.\n\n&gt; Of course the same can happen (and does happen) with Atom entities  \n&gt; or even\n&gt; with representations returned by HTTP itself. But it seems to us that\n&gt; interface designers in the REST &quot;camp&quot; seem to better understand the\n&gt; importance of reusing existing representations for new applications,  \n&gt; not\n&gt; custom designing representations for each new application. An  \n&gt; example of\n&gt; this is the RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a transport  \n&gt; protocol,\n&gt; but rather an &quot;application protocol&quot;, albeit a VERY application  \n&gt; neutral one.\n&gt; What we haven&#39;t seen yet, even from the REST &quot;camp&quot; is much in the  \n&gt; way of\n&gt; fairly generic ATOM entities to go inside the ATOM &quot;envelope&quot;. Many  \n&gt; REST\n&gt; examples using ATOM step off the same cliff.\n\nAgain the use of the term &quot;very application neutral.&quot;  Until we know  \nwhat it means, we can&#39;t have an intelligent discussion.\n\nTo illustrate my confusion, let me just say that HTTP is not neutral.   \nIt&#39;s limited to the category of client-server request/response  \ninteraction patterns with high tolerance for latencies.  The class of  \napplications which fall into this category happen to be large and  \ncommon place, but it is nonetheless a class of applications which does  \nnot encompass all applications.  So, what does it mean to be  \n&quot;application neutral&quot; or even &quot;very application neutral?&quot;  :confused:\n\nOn the subject of Atom, AtomPub defines how a general-purpose Atom  \nclient can interact with any Atom server up to retrieving, modifying,  \nand deleting a resource.  However, the client cannot create new  \nresources, b/c the AtomPub specification does not define a format for  \ndescribing resource creation.  That&#39;s about the only thing that it&#39;s  \nmissing, that I can think of, to make it a general purpose hypermedia- \ntype for client-server applications, which gracefully degrades for  \ngeneral purpose Atom clients (much like HTML does for browsers).  In  \nthat regard, Atom is not yet RESTful, but close.\n\nNick, I would like very much to understand what &quot;application  \nneutrality&quot; means to you and what you think this term brings to the  \ntable.  I fear that without better bounds on its meaning, we&#39;re bound  \nto talk in circles.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://mindtouch.com\nhttp://twitter.com/bjorg\n\n\n"}}
