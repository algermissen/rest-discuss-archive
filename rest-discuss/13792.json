But there are a lot\n&gt; of people in the world looking to create practical RESTful solutions of\n&gt; course in HTTP.  Trying to talk about REST in the absence of concrete\n&gt; HTTP can quickly become really handwavy and imprecise, since most lack\n&gt; the shared terminology and communicative rigor to have a productive\n&gt; conversation.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
