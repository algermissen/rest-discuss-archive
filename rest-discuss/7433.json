Thoroughly specified\n&gt;  schemas describing almost every possible Purchase Order Request and\n&gt;  Response. Guess how long it takes one large computer manufacturer to\n&gt;  shake out enough impedance mismatches to get going with each new\n&gt;  trading partner? 30-60 days, and that is a dedicated team of experts\n&gt;  exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and resolving\n&gt;  the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents. So that&#39;s one\n&gt;  or two months per partner. How long does it take to ramp on just 100\n&gt;  partners? Years. Not  web scale, is it?\n\nThat fits with my experience.  Previous ecommerce standards, ANSI X12\nEDI and EDIFACT, were even worse: took months.\n\nSome of the same people have now created UBL: a 4th or 5th generation\n(X12, EDIFACT, RosettaNet, UBL, depending on whether you put ebXML\ninto that geneology).  We&#39;ll see how quickly new trading partners can\nget going using that.  I think it&#39;s less prescriptive than RosettaNet,\nwhich tried to achieve minimal configuration.\n\n"}}
