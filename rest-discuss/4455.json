When you design so that state is not stored on the server,\n: &gt; naturally it will have to be stored elsewhere-- it&#39;s part of the\n: &gt; client&#39;s job.\n: I have 40M+ resources, so I wasn&#39;t considering this as feasible.\n: I also think that HTTP indicates that part of a server&#39;s job for handling\n: PUT is for the client to be able to specify the URI.\n:\n: &gt;\n: &gt; In any case, you can make this plan more robust as follows: when the\n: &gt; server creates a record for a new document, also store the digest of the\n: &gt; request that caused it.  Then, if it receives a duplicate request from\n: &gt; the client, ignore it and return the exiting resource location.\n: I&#39;m not really worried about duplicate requests - the behavior would be to\n: determine if the submitted content already had been submitted before.\nEither\n: via the URI having the client-managed identifier or having the content\n: contain the client-managed identifier.\n:\n: &gt;\n: &gt; Also, assuming that input documents are not shared, the server could\n: &gt; provide a query function that returns the output resource given an input\n: &gt; resource URL.\n: What would that look like? It&#39;d be a compound URI, right? Whatever it\nwould\n: look like, I hadn&#39;t considered two resources - one for the stored input\n: document and one with references to the synthesized output document, but\nin\n: order to know about this second resource either the client generates that\n: resource identifier or that identifer is contained in a representation of\n: the stored input document - and I might as well point to the synthesized\n: output document directly.\n: Something to think about though, there&#39;s probably an answer in here\n: somewhere....\n:\n:\n: (Anyone else with some ideas/comments?
