This is for a project where we are going to expose \nthose kinds of govermental data.\n\nHere is the general setup:\n\n1) There is an Open Search interface for searching for case files, dossiers \nand so on.\n\n2) The search results contains links to case files etc.\n\n3) A case file has a title, a responsible case manager and such like. It \nalso has links to it&#39;s related dossiers.\n\n4) A dossier has a title and more. It also has links to it&#39;s related \ndocuments and it&#39;s containing case.\n\n5) A document has a title and more. It also has a download link where the \nbinary document can be found plus a link to it&#39;s containing dossier.\n\n6) Dossiers have associated parties (persons/roles) and as such there will \nbe links to parties.\n\n7) Lots more of the same stuff ...\n\nNow, all of this is represented as XML. We already have official Danish XML \nschemas for case files and documents (although not for dossiers). But none \nof the schemas contains the relevant links. What we want to do is to use the \nofficial schemas and decorate them with the relevant links (using \natom:link). In this way we should be backwards compatible with any \napplications that use the official schemas already.\n\nI haven&#39;t heard of any official media types for this kind of stuff, so I \nguess we will have to mint our own. But the data is not really for global \nconsumption - some parts are, but a lot of it is only relevant in a Danish \nenvironment.\n\nAny recomandations for what to do now? My best guess is to create \n&quot;application/fesd.dk+xml&quot; where the name &quot;fesd&quot; is the Danish acronym for \nall the schemas (and much more). I probably also have to put our company \nname into it, since we don&#39;t own the &quot;fesd&quot; name, which means it will be \n&quot;application/vnd.cbrain.fesd.dk+xml&quot;. Right?\n\nThe next step would the be to write up the media type documentation and do \nsome coding :-)\n\nComments?\n\nThanks, J�rn\n\n\n\n"}}
