In this webcast he stated that a good =\r\nshare of the WS-* vs REST debate was &quot;totally pointless&quot; because &quot;if you lo=\r\nok at the WS-* specs., if you just compare the things the RESTafarians prom=\r\note; the WS-* (the core of it) does implement these concepts&quot;. He goes on t=\r\no say  &quot;the architectural principles you see in the REST style, they are pr=\r\nesent in the WS-* technology. Yes, there are lots of optional specification=\r\ns, that big WS-* jungle, but you don&#39;t have to use all of those if you don&#39;=\r\nt have (the) requirements&quot;. At which point his interviewer (Markus Volter) =\r\nstated &quot;if you use REST style you dont get all those things so you should j=\r\nust compare REST with the core (of WS-*) and not all the other things&quot; i.e.=\r\n specs.\n\nAs I am presenting as paper on this very debate later in the year =\r\nI was wondering if his point is valid. My own opinion is that he is just co=\r\nmparing capabilities and may have missed the critical point of approach (wh=\r\nich I have seen raised by Mark Baker and Ryan Tomakyo) i.e. WSDL promotes u=\r\nnique interface naming which breaks the core tenet of Uniform Interface. As=\r\n Steve Vinoski points out in his &quot;REST Eye for the SOA guy&quot; article, this h=\r\nas a serious impact on scalability.\n\nAnother point is the fact that the SOA=\r\nP URL is of the SOAP server causes problems for Web intermediaries also e.g=\r\n. proxies cant determine what the request is specifically trying to access.=\r\n Also, given that the Semantic Web vision is that each resource should have=\r\n its own URI, this means that SOAP is at odds with the Semantic Web. \n\nCach=\r\ning q:  I know SOAP 1.2 introduced the WebMethod so that one could use any =\r\nHTTP method with SOAP messages (POST, which was the default SOAP 1.1 verb i=\r\ns not cacheable). However, given that the URL for SOAP messages will be the=\r\n SOAP server URL and not a specific resource I don&#39;t see how this gets SOAP=\r\n out of the &quot;caching&quot; problem?\n\nWhen comparing REST with the core WS-* spec=\r\ns, are there other arguments that I should be making...\n\nThanks,\nSean.\n\nPS =\r\nI was talking to a large well-known telecoms company recently and I asked t=\r\nhem what do they use for WS. To which he replied &quot;we use both SOAP and REST=\r\n but its all moving towards REST&quot;...\n\nPS2 If anybody would like to view my =\r\npaper then please let me know.
