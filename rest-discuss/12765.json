Now imagine\n&gt; that there are 5 different ways this can happen. This rather quickly\n&gt; seems to sprial out of control.\n\nYou seem to be implying that those 5 different ways, and different flows,\nwould result in the same resource being modified in the same way without\ncontext.\n\nStop me if i&#39;m wrong, but if you were to change an address in 5 different\nways using commands, you would have 5 different commands?\n\nIn ReST, the state that is shared between client and server isn&#39;t without\nworkflows. You modify a resource (the concept of address) by sending one or\nmany representations to one or many URIs.\n\nNothing prevents you from operating various workflows through the use of\nvarious URIs, or if modelled on a state machine, to keep track of where in\nthe workflow a client application is, and instruct on what to do next, based\non the current state being sent back and forth by the client.\n\nI think i&#39;m still missing the point as to why changing an address in 5\ndifferent ways through 5 different flows would be impossible or messy in\nReST? The only way I could understand such a statement would be in the case\nwhere you believe that they all end up triggering the same operation on the\nsame resource, which is not a ReST constraint per se.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
