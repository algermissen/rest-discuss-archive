There is no best practice. There should be no best practice.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; best practice is to allow that publisher&#39;s URI space to evolve\n&gt; &gt; independently of any software implementation by a subscriber.\n&gt; I agree that there isn&#39;t a rigorous standard.  However, from a\n&gt; usability standpoint, I read:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.example.com/US/MA/Boston\n\n&gt; as a unique resource, whereas:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.example.com/?country=US&state=MA&city=Boston\n\n&gt; as a multi-dimensional query.   I would argue that &quot;current best\n&gt; practice&quot; -- as represented by actual URLs in the wild -- is for\n&gt; individual resources to named by hierarchical URLs, with queries used\n&gt; for potentially multi-valued search results.  This may not -always- be\n&gt; the case, but I think it represents the &quot;common&quot; case.  Would you\n&gt; disagree?\n\nPossibly, but Fielding wrote only a month ago[1]:\n&quot;Independent evolvability of components can only\nbe achieved if the client is prevented from knowing what exactly\nwill happen as the result of its requests. If it knows, then client\ndevelopers build into the system an expectation of the server\nimplementation that simply will not hold true over time.&quot;\n\nIn context, I believe this applies directly to the URI construction\ndebate. He responds to [2], which worries that clients won&#39;t be able to\nmake appropriate assumptions about what a server will do if the\noperation of DELETE depends on which URI it is sent to. The tone of\nearlier articles in the thread is the question of whether a hierarhical\nURI should always only DELETE one resource, and whether a URI with a\nquery part may effectively DELETE multiple resources selected by the\nquery part. He states this even more clearly with this next comment:\n\n&quot;What makes you think that /parts/00345 is not a query for part\nnumbers that contain the string &quot;00345&quot;? Did the server tell you?&quot;\n\nTo take words out of his mouth, only the author of the server code is\npermitted to make assumptions of this kind. You as the owner of the\nserver code are permitted. You as the consumer are not. I like\nhierarchical namespaces where they make sense. Many share this view,\nhowever that doesn&#39;t make it best practice. It would only become best\npratice if alternative practices had known faults associated with them.\n\nI believe that from the REST architectural perspective both URI\nconstructions are equally valid. Neither have inherent advantages over\neach other on the server side. The client side is not permitted to make\nassumptions about the URI space structure, so doesn&#39;t come into the\nquestion. Firefox plugins that allow you to navigate &quot;up&quot; using URI\nstructure alone will always be hit and miss in their success because\nthey make assumptions they are not in an appropriate position to make.\nThe correct approach would be to provide a &lt;link&gt; or &lt;a&gt; node in your\nhtml document with an appropriate rel=&quot;&quot; tag for the browser to use.\nOnly then could the client consistently determine which URI to retrieve\nwhen asked to go &quot;up&quot;. Maybe talk to the microformat guys if you want to\ndelve in to that any deeper.\n\nYou could argue that if we move outside of the REST architectural\nperspective and free the client up to make extra assumptions there are\nadvantages to the hierarchical namespace. I think this is true, but may\nbe outside the charter of this list.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n[1] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5502\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5489\n\n\n"}}
