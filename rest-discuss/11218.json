It makes\nmention th=\r\nat the authors believe that a bug in the design of ETags is\nthat they are n=\r\not first class objects.  In this case, first class\nobjects means making the=\r\nm URIs.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has heard of something like this or=\r\n has\nseen it implemented anywhere?  I&#39;ve never encountered ETags when they\n=\r\nwere anything other than values in HTTP headers.\n\nThanks,\nGriffin Caprio\nht=\r\ntp://www.griffincaprio.com\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
