One approach is to \nexpose an edit resource, similar to the add one;\n  http://www.example.org/edit\nTo edit a specific resource, one could use a query string;\n  http://www.example.org/edit?resource=theThing\nand use GET and POST to get the form and POST the edit.\n\nAnother approach would be to use the resource&#39;s native URI, like\n  http://www.example.org/records/theThing?mode=edit\nin a similar manner. This seems to be the approach taken by most\nWIKIs, interestingly.\n\nIs either approach preferable/horrible, or are they pretty much the\nsame? The specific application is a gateway to an LDAP database. I\nhaven&#39;t read Roy&#39;s full dissertation (still!), so apologies if I&#39;ve\nasked a FAQ.\n\nDeletion is another interesting case; if each LDAP entry really is a\nresource, DELETE would be most appropriate, no? Unfortunately, methods\nother than GET and POST aren&#39;t available from HTML...\n\nCheers,\n\nP.S.; Do queries identify a new resource? Their defined as a mechanism\nto pass data to the server. Common use (as outlined above) seems to\nindicate that people don&#39;t consider them separate, but in the URI\nworld, they&#39;re not lumped into URI-References with fragments...\n\n\n"}}
