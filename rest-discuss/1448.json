I may have mistakenly given the impression\nthat I was advocating a specific way of extending OOP as *the* model of\nimplementing REST.  There are certainly other equally fine ways and it isn&#39;t\nnecessarily to treat resources as objects.\n\nI was merely suggesting that if I want to program in a OOP environment,\nhaving such extensions would make creating a RESTful application much\neasier.  And I would have the benefit of pushing the hide/expose decisions\nto much later in the development cycle.\n\nFrom Philip&#39;s description of his toolkit, I think it is the very type of\nextension that would be very useful.  I would love to see it!  It may never\nbe necessary to make all objects URI-addressible or to make URI-addressing a\n&quot;first-class&quot; concept in a language, but I think if we take it to that\nextreme, there may be some interesting ways to leverage this capability.\n\nSome additional challenges for such a environment include the concept of the\nlife-span or pemanence of objects.  There may also be issues regarding\ndefining some standard form for URIs that are auto-generated in such a\nsystem.  I&#39;ve not fully thought this through but I think it could be an\ninteresting exercise. 8-)\n\n//Joe\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Philip Eskelin\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nCc: &#39;Roger L. Costello&#39;; joe.hsy@...\nSent: 6/10/2002 7:21 AM\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] RE: Dynamic exposing/hiding of Web resources!\n\nJoe, Roger,\n\nThe RESTful toolkit that I recently announced I&#39;m developing is designed\nto do\nthe important parts of what both of you are saying.  Joe, I think it&#39;s\nwrong to\nprogram every object in an application as URI-addressable.  Only the\nones that\nshould be network-accessible.  And I think Roger&#39;s resource-based\nclassification\nis more suitable to REST than the object-based one, and it better\nrepresents\nwhat I have designed into my toolkit.\n\nFor example, in addition to regular HTML content, core resources built\ninto the\ntoolkit are nodes, containers, components, methods, topics, and queues.\nI have\nimplemented them as objects, but in essence they are better represented\nas\nresources.  Since the toolkit is developed in C++, every object has the\nabiliity\nto subclass from a CObject class, which provides the built-in\nfunctionality you\nrefer to below.  It not only implements URI addressability, but also a\nfacility\nfor serializing a snapshot of the state of any resource into an XML\nstream to be\ntransmitted in response to a GET request.  Combine these features with\nenvironmental acquisition and you&#39;ve got a great development environment\nto work\nin.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a sales pitch....it will be free for developers, and I hope\nit helps\nmake REST a better philosophy for programming distributed apps than\nRPCs.\n\n-Philip\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Roger L. Costello [mailto:costello@...]\nSent: Monday, June 10, 2002 8:05 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com; costello@...\nSubject: [rest-discuss] RE: Dynamic exposing/hiding of Web resources!\n\n\nJoe Hsy wrote:\n&gt; In order to make this feasible, we need a development environment\n&gt; where URL-addressability for any object or resource is a built-in\n&gt; feature of the system and not something that needs to be consciously\n&gt; decided by the programmer.  This is what I was thinking when I\n&gt; suggested that we create a full-blown distributed OOP development\n&gt; environment that supports REST intrinsically.\n\nIsn&#39;t the idea of REST that URIs identify &quot;resources&quot;, i.e., logical\nentities?  Whether the resource is implemented as an object or some\nother form is transparent.  Consequently, the implementation of the\nresource can change without impacting clients.\n\nI don&#39;t really equate &quot;objects&quot; with &quot;logical entities&quot;.  There are many\nways to implement a logical entity without the use of objects, e.g., a\nlogical entitiy could be implemented simply as an XML document, or as\nthe results of a database query.\n\nI see these two statements as being very different:\n\nObject-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**object** is a built-in feature of the system.\n\nResource-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**resource** is a built-in feature of the system.\n\nI agree with the later, but not the former.  /Roger\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
