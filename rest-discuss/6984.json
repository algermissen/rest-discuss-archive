This is definitely not as\n&gt; simple as writing JUnit &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; functional tests.\n&gt; The properties induced by an architecture tend to be less\n&gt; observable, and exist relative to local constraints.  For example,\n&gt; scaleability only means something relative to the resources\n&gt; actually available.\n\nOr, looking for a metric, I can hack n users now without falling over,\nscalability for this app means hacking n*1000 users without falling over.\nNow scalability (this definition) is objective. And useful.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as &quot;clear &#39;this is bad&#39; marks, there is more clarity (negative)\n&gt; in finding counterexamples than there is clarity (positive) in not\n&gt; finding any.\n\nI really don&#39;t think Bills idea was a total load of codswallop.\nDo you?\nI guess we can all put forward negative views.\n\n\n\n&gt; :\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : &gt; Bill didn&#39;t say &quot;test&quot;; he said &quot;evaluate&quot;.  I think the above is an\n&gt; : &gt; example of the latter.\n&gt; :\n&gt; : Wow. subtle!\n&gt; : I won&#39;t go there, my English isn&#39;t good enough.\n&gt; : Perhaps different shades of gray?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, think about how you (never mind REST) would go about\n&gt; testing the scaleability of your application.  Now contrast that with\n&gt; how you would evaluate the same thing based on an inspection\n&gt; of application artifacts.  Is that subtle?\n\nI defined a metric above. I&#39;m sure others could define one\nmatching their needs.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; : Then how about a graded set of tests which anyone might\n&gt; : apply to gain some form of measure of the alignment\n&gt; : of the system with the REST ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; Similar to CMM assessments,\nI don&#39;t know what CMM assessments are.\n\n\n I think it would be possible to\n&gt; put together a set of evaluation areas, based on the REST\n&gt; constraints, and to write up guidelines on how to inspect systems\n&gt; to determine their &quot;REST maturity&quot;.  But I wouldn&#39;t call that testing\n&gt; anymore than the SEI calls the CMM assessments tests (they\n&gt; don&#39;t).\n\nNeither acronym is meaningful to me.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ruler&quot; is too simplistic a metaphor for this.\n\nOK. your view.\nIt&#39;s the most promising start I&#39;ve seen that might allow the REST of us\nto view a system.\n\nregards\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
