The java based clients feel too &#39;protocol&#39; level though. I suppose all\nI really want is a set of really good Java classes for MIME packaged content\n(including multi-part, with XML support, etc.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, REST-specific tools in programming\n&gt; languages that unlike the tools you list above,\n&gt; would greatly expedite the development of\n&gt; applications using the REST style.\n\nREST is more about good design than about specific programming.\nJust as with an RDBMS and SQL, regardless of the ease or completeness of the\ntools and servers, you can still create the query from hell, or have tables\nthat are not normalized enough (or too normalized), or poor queries, and so\non. A book showing good design and good queries will do more for SQL/RDBMS\nthan a toolkit or API. Some things - like connection pooling and\nauthentication - definitely make sense for language and API and language\nlevel toolkits.\n\n\n\n"}}
