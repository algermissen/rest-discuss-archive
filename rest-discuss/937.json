I might&#39;ve confused the discussion\nwhen I talked about the possibility of using &#39;/&#39; to mean set\nintersection;  that&#39;s sort of an extreme example, not something you&#39;re\nreally want to do.  Informally, &#39;/&#39; should only be used to indicate\ntraversal of  &quot;links&quot; in a graph-structured namespace.  That is, given a\npartial path\n\n    a/b/\n\nthen the following should hold\n\n    a/b/.. ==  a/\n\nI&#39;m not at all trying to redefine the semantics associated with existing\nURI syntax, just trying to point out that those semantics do indeed\nexist and can be usefully exploited.  As Mark indicates in notes on his\nown opacity investigation, the existing URIspace has several\nwell-defined dimensions or degrees of freedom.  &#39;//&#39; selects between\nroots in a (flat or hierarchical, depending on whether hostnames are\nopaque) namespace;  &#39;/&#39; traverses named links in a single-rooted\ngraph-structured namespace rooted in the authority, yielding a\ntwo-dimensional object, a directed graph.  The addition of properties\nvia &#39;;&#39; introduces a third dimension to the namespace.  The query string\n&#39;?&#39; turns each &quot;point&quot; in an arbitrary number of so-far three\ndimensional spaces into its own namespace of arbitrary dimensionality or\ndegree.\n\nThere are some conclusions that can be drawn from this.  &#39;/&#39; should\n*only* be used to represent graph-oriented (commonly incorrectly called\n&quot;hierarchical&quot;) relationships.  Conversely, *all* such relationships\n*should* be represented by use of &#39;/&#39;.  This is my beef with shoving\nstuff into query parameters out of some poorly-conceived concern for\nopacity;  when you push information into the query string, you lose the\ninformation about the graph-oriented relationships between the parts.\nThis is a bad thing;  we&#39;ve got a syntax for representing that\ninformation in URI, but concern for &quot;opacity&quot; means that generally\nspeaking we often can&#39;t use it, with the result being less meaningful\nnames.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
