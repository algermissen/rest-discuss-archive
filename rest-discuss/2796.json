Remember requests like &#39;I need a pattern to search a string\nfor a token&#39; on patterns-discussion?  Journalists thrive on change, and\noften you see them struggle with a new concept when they&#39;re early adopters\nto a potentially mainstream trend.  In this case, I don&#39;t think Udell\nstruggled with the concept, since in my experience he seems to articulate\nnew concepts well, but he seems to be stuck somewhere in the gray area\nbetween being a SOAP and REST (clearly anybody who boasts &#39;RESTful SOAP&#39; is\nmissing or hiding something).\n\n&gt; Next step, a rack of REST books,\n&gt; some of them based on RPC-oriented SOAP?\n\nIt must be funny for people browsing in bookstores who are not technical.\nFirst they see patterns, thinking maybe programmers are sewers.  Then they\nsee SOAP, thinking that programmers finally discovered hygiene.  Now\nREST...will they think it&#39;s a new form of meditation?  It sort of is, if you\ndo it right ;-)\n\n&gt; But the fact remains, Roy, Mark, Paul and colleagues\n&gt; have executed a remarkably successful education campaign!\n&gt; Going from disdain to hype-as-goodness in about a year?\n\nGush gush gush!  For me, all three have contributed greatly to my\nunderstanding of what I&#39;m doing in my own efforts.  Roy&#39;s dissertation\nhelped me understand the core concepts, but Mark and Paul helped me realize\nI needed to refactor and redesign my toolkit a lot more before it was\nRESTful enough for release.\n\nPhilip\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
