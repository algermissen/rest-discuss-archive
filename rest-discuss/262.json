And inventing a new protocol to do this\n&gt; would have only made your life harder. Working with sockets. No caching.\n&gt; Can&#39;t use PHP, Zope or JSP. Can&#39;t use web browsers. Would require a\n&gt; &quot;client library&quot; for each language. Etc. Etc.\n\nI am all in favor of using existing protocols.  I\nwant to use HTTP for request/response and SMTP for\nasynch.
