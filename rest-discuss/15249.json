How hard can it be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And=\r\n off they go.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sending crap over HTTP =3D=3D REST. Thankfully, REST=\r\n is easier to\n&gt; &gt; pronounce than HTTP. So all my ad hoc HTTP RPC interfaces=\r\n now become\n&gt; &gt; REST interfaces. Simple. Just rolls of the tounge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n So, the problem is that REST is already understood, WELL understood.\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nt just happens to be pretty much completely wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then you have t=\r\no go in to the whole thesis, the concepts behind it,\n&gt; &gt; the vocabulary, et=\r\nc. etc. etc. &quot;Why can&#39;t I just POST whatever I\n&gt; &gt; want?&quot; arguments, etc.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hardly worth fighting any more. It&#39;s exhausting. If folks want=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; know about REST, they can look it up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you think that RE=\r\nST is misunderstood, then rewrite the wikipedia\n&gt; &gt; article until it&#39;s clea=\r\nr, so that rather than getting in to exhausting\n&gt; &gt; discussions, advocates =\r\ncan just point to that and the thesis and tell\n&gt; &gt; folks to come back later=\r\n if they&#39;re interested. They won&#39;t, HTTP RPC\n&gt; &gt; solves 99% of the use case=\r\ns that they&#39;re REALLY trying to solve, so\n&gt; &gt; they won&#39;t make the leap to r=\r\nearchitecting their system. But at least\n&gt; &gt; it makes it easier for folks u=\r\nsing it to make the material more\n&gt; &gt; approachable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
