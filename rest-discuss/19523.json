Isn&#39;t that\n&gt; what representations are for?\n\n&#39;representations&#39; are different presentations/formats/content-types\nshowing the same (sub-)set of data. Page 2 does not contain the same\ndata as page 1, so isn&#39;t a different representation per the http\nmeaning of the noun, but a different resource. The entire library, if\nnot available via a single URL, is not a (HTTP) resource. (Someone\nplease correct me if I&#39;m wrong there.)\n\n&gt; Besides, I&#39;m not sure it makes it easier on the caching management side of\n&gt; things as those different resources are nonetheless linked (if an adult\n&gt; purchases a chid book, both the adult library and the child library\n&gt; resources are impacted).\n\nThe whole goal of a well-written web service is to improve a cache&#39;s\nability to make a match.\nYou said &quot;The view of that resource (i.e. the list of books returned)\nmay vary based on the age of the reader (or any other criteria).&quot;\nHow are you determining what &#39;view&#39; to return, or put another way, how\ndo you decide on the &quot;age of the reader&quot;? Are readers users who have\nto log in and get a cookie set? Or are readers just a target audience\nfor the book, and the client is asking for &quot;children&#39;s books&quot; through\nsome query string, the client&#39;s age being unknown?\nIf at the moment you&#39;re using something like Vary: Cookie to serve\ndifferent pages to different clients, then your resources are not\ngoing to see any caches except the client&#39;s browser. Try to eliminate\nthis if at all possible, perhaps via 303 responses to avoid changing\nthe referring href.\nIf you are using query strings to change the books shown, then, as the\nquery string is part of the URL, and the URL is the minimal key\nrequired to differentiate resources, a different URL means you are\nrequesting a different resource, and so the URI can be anything you\nwant, e.g. /childrens-books/ or /library?genre=children%39s\n\nThis isn&#39;t really relevant to Entity Tags but I thought I should bring it up.\n\n-- \nNicholas.\n\n"}}
