In general, they all seem to agree on the\ndefinition of what GET and DELETE should do, however they can vary\nwildly in what the proper definition of PUT and POST are.\n\nSo, in an effort to clarify this, I have a number of use cases that I&#39;d\nlike to present, and hopefully generate some discussion as to how they\nwould be implemented.\n\nFirstly though, a description of the resources in the problem space:\n\nVehicle: A vehicle has a set of data associated with it, typically\nlicense details, maintenance records etc. \n\nFleet: A fleet is a collection of vehicles, it has a name and other\nsimilar properties. A single vehicle can be in more than one fleet.\n\nI have tentatively mapped these in the url space as follows:\n\n/vehicles/{fleet}/{vehicle}\n\nThere is also an implicit All fleet that contains all of the vehicles.\n\nSo now we have that out of the way, we come to the use cases:\n\n1. Creating a fleet.\n2. Modifying a fleet.\n3. Creating a vehicle.\n4. Modifying a vehicle.\n5. Moving a vehicle from one fleet to another.\n\nMy initial thoughts were that 1, and 3 should be handled via PUT, and 2,\nand 4 with POST. I have no idea how 5 would be handled, a POST?\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help on this as I&#39;m totally confused.\n\nScott.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
