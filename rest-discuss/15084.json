However as this is a general REST\ndiscussion list I don&#39;t want to dig into technical detail of your\nimplementation and I&#39;ll restrict my comments to the area of REST.\n\n&gt; The code is a simple maven2 based clojure/compojure web application.\n&gt;  The README file in the root of the repository (and on the front of the\n&gt; URL above) serves as documentation for the various media types in the\n&gt; API, and the conventions used.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m keen on hearing the collective thoughts of your minds on this, some\n&gt; questions I&#39;ve althought started to wonder include:\n&gt; \n&gt;   * is using PATCH for sending non-CRUD operations a good, or a bad thing?\n&gt;   * is adding a rel attribute to standard media types good/bad? such as\n&gt; &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded; rel=wellrested-newstaffmember&quot; over\n&gt; &quot;application/newstaff+x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;?\n\nI don&#39;t like how you&#39;re using the PATCH command. You are not _patching_\nthe resource &quot;stafflist&quot;. Instead you&#39;re transferring an announcement\nresource to the server. So I&#39;d think a POST to /stafflist/announcements\nwould be more appropriate. The PATCH method changes the state of the\npatched resource. In this case I doubt the state of the stafflist is\nchanged -- the server just prints the announcements and the stafflist\nisn&#39;t altered at all.\n\nNext, a technical issue, however not specific to compojure: I see that\nyou hardcoded the base URL of the application for generating links. The\nbase URL can be extracted from the servlet environment, of course, but\nthe mapping of URL to resource remains split-brained: url to\nimpl-of-resource is mapped by the web framework (compojure) but the\nreverse way impl-of-resource to url is done from within the resource\ncode. So there is a duplication of mapping and danger of inconsistency.\n\nIs there any RESTful framework that addresses this issue? I suppose\nyou&#39;ll need an separation between the resource implementation and the\ndispatcher of the resources. And this dispatcher must provide\ninformation at runtime on how a certain resource can be addressed.\n\n(This one of the issues I like to solve in a next beat of my\ncompojure-rest library)\n\n-billy.\n\n"}}
