The RDF triple\n&lt;http://some.org/countries/Canada&gt; &lt;owl:sameAs&gt; &lt;http://another.org/canada&gt; .\nsays that the resource identified by http://some.org/countries/Canada is the\nsame resource identified by http://another.org/canada. However it does not say\nanything about what happens when you perform a GET operation on that URI, OWL\ndoesn&#39;t talk about HTTP operations at all (as someone interested in REST,\nHTTP, OWL and RDF I&#39;ve looked at creating a vocabuary so that RDF *can* say\nsomething about that, but if I succeed I still wouldn&#39;t change the fact that\nRDF statements are about the resources, not the representations).\n\nNow let&#39;s say that a GET on http://some.org/countries/Canada returns this\ndocument:\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;\n&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html xml:lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Canada&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada is a wonderful multi-cultural nation that combines many of the\nbenefits that come from North American capitalism with a sense of social\njustice that results in great health care and a strong govenment support for\nthe arts that has enabled it to produce many of the best films in the English\nlanguage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\nand lets say a GET on http://another.org/canada returns this document:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;\n&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html xml:lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; lang=&quot;en-IE&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Canada&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada is such a wishy-washy liberal country that one has hardly any\npersonal freedom that the PC-brigade haven&#39;t trampled on. This wimpishness is\nevident in their boring films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n(For the record, I&#39;d like to point out my great admiriation for Canada&#39;s\nmulti-cultural nation and their film industry in particular).\n\nAnyway, both of these GETs return a representation of Canada. They also clearly\ndisagree strongly. This is due to three things:\n\n1. On a large distributed system like the web there is no way of getting anyone\nto agree anyway.\n2. In the case of human-readable documents like the XHTML examples above a\nbelief in freedom-of-speech (whether total or restricted) would lead us to\nconsider any such mechanism for forcing agreement to be undesirable.\n3. People can get stuff wrong (there&#39;s nothing to stop a representation of\nCanada from claiming that it is the country you enter by crossing the southern\nborder of Texas, or even that Canada is a type of small brightly-coloured fish\nfound in rivers in Central Europe.\n\nOn the other hand the two representations *could* be identical, or one could\nreference the other as a source of further information (even in the above\nexamples one could reference the other as a source of mis-information).\n\nOf course in RDF we can have two contradictory statements as well, even in the\nsame graph. We would conclude that the graph is invalid and it can&#39;t all be\ntrue - just as we would conclude that it isn&#39;t possible for both of the\nopinions about Canada expressed above are completely true at the same time.\nIndeed while the obvious use of owl:sameAs is to merge two sources of trusted\nuseful information it can be just as useful to merge two sources of potentially\nuseful information, detect that they contradict, and realise that at least one\nis incorrect.\n\nThe closest thing in HTTP to an owl:sameAS is a 301 Moved Permanently status\ncode, since the semantics of 301 mean that not only can the GET be fulfilled by\nperforming it on the new URI, but that this is always the case and all future\nuses of the former URI SHOULD use the latter. However this is a bit of a\nstretch, and in general one shouldn&#39;t expect what RDF says about a relationship\nbetween to resources to necessarily be expressable in pure HTTP terms.\n\nThe only point where RDF and REST (or more strictly, the particular RESTful\nsystm which is the web) coincide is that they both use URIs to identify\nresources. HTTP gives us a way of obtaining or setting representations of those\nResources. RDF gives us a syntax for describing those resources, including\nthose where we have no control over the server that will respond to HTTP\nrequests with the given URI. Of course a representation may well be an RDF/XML\ndocument, but RDF is complementary to HTTP.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
