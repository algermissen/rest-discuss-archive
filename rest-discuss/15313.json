I have a s=\r\net of draft posts and published posts. In order to\n&gt; &gt; change a draft post =\r\nto a published post I need to &quot;publish&quot; it. How should I\n&gt; &gt; represent one =\r\nsuch command in REST?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is my thoughts so far:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The two s=\r\nets are represented by two different ATOM resources, each having\n&gt; &gt; their =\r\nown URL. Each individual post also has it&#39;s own resource URL. Nothing\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\npecial here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order to publish a post I can do:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Use a =\r\nnew HTTP verb called &quot;PUBLISH&quot; and send that to the draft post I\n&gt; &gt; want t=\r\no publish.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) POST the complete blog post representation on the &quot;pu=\r\nblished posts&quot; URL,\n&gt; &gt; thereby adding the blog post to the published list,=\r\n and implicitly remove it\n&gt; &gt; from the draft list.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Do an empty P=\r\nOST to a sub-resource of the blog post named &quot;publish&quot;\n&gt; &gt; indicating that =\r\nI want to &quot;publish&quot; that resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) Expose the single &quot;published&quot;=\r\n state value as a sub-resource of the blog\n&gt; &gt; post and POST true/false to =\r\nthat resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 5) Mainting a non-ATOM list of published blog post i=\r\ndentifiers. When\n&gt; &gt; publishing a blog post I can POST that post&#39;s identifi=\r\ner to the &quot;published&quot;\n&gt; &gt; identifier list (instead of sending the complete =\r\nset of blog post data).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What are your suggestions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, =\r\nJ=F8rn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
