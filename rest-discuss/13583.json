This could\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; roughly take one of two forms:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.=\r\n A set of specifications based on a range of technologies that focus on\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; REST constraint compliance, or\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. A more HTTP-centric set of specifi=\r\ncations working on providing features\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not available on the Web and pro=\r\nbably not consistent with REST constraints\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such as pub/sub, transactio=\r\nns, reliable POST, etc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Methinks a little from column A, and a li=\r\nttle from column B.\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These are all great points. =A0The output of=\r\n REST-* is not meant to be an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; academic exercise. =A0We want to create s=\r\npecifications that can be implemented\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and solve specific problems. =A0W=\r\nhile our goal is to be architecturally pure,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; software, in general, is v=\r\nery rarely architecturely pure when in its final\n&gt;&gt;&gt; form. =A0As a result, =\r\ninitial iterations (and even final ones) maybe a mix of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; both HTTP and R=\r\nEST-centric designs. =A0Remember, WE JUST STARTED!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know how you fee=\r\nl. The architectures I build at the moment are all\n&gt;&gt; real-time, so while R=\r\nEST is a template I have weakened statelessness\n&gt;&gt; and essentially substitu=\r\nted cache for pub/sub. This is actually\n&gt;&gt; changing over time and the archi=\r\ntecture is just starting to come into\n&gt;&gt; closer alignment with REST as deve=\r\nlopers begin to understand that even\n&gt;&gt; in a real-time system poll+cache tu=\r\nrns out to solve many problems\n&gt;&gt; better.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;...starting to come into =\r\ncloser alignment with REST.&quot; =A0Some of the\n&gt; people that will be getting i=\r\nnvolved simply did a HTTP facade over\n&gt; existing APIs (Transaction guy was =\r\none. =A0JBPM guys did another that\n&gt; wasn&#39;t published on REST-*.org). =A0Th=\r\nese guys don&#39;t know anything about\n&gt; REST, ....YET....I need their help. =\r\n=A0There is no possible way I can do\n&gt; all the work. =A0So initial submissi=\r\nons won&#39;t be perfect somebody guides\n&gt; them in the right direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In=\r\ncidentally, I have a neat little HTTP-friendly pub/sub protocol that\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m=\r\n working at the moment to free from IP strictures within my\n&gt;&gt; organisation=\r\n. I&#39;d love to talk to you guys about it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking at pubsubhubub =\r\nand webhooks as well for ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * Transitional HTTP: Breaks REST con=\r\nstraints in some way, probably by\n&gt;&gt; breaking statelessness of client/serve=\r\nr.\n&gt;\n&gt; I definitely see that happening now and then. =A0Some things will be=\r\n\n&gt; slightly RPCish as well until they can become refactored. =A0Sometimes I=\r\n\n&gt; see myself walking a very fine line when defining link semantics and\n&gt; t=\r\nhey seem to many times look RPCish.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; This, IMO, does not mean we sho=\r\nuld change the name of the site or to coin a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; new buzzword. =A0The goal =\r\nwe are striving for is to be RESTful. REST is our\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ideal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You unde=\r\nrstand, of course, that this is a subject that the REST camp\n&gt;&gt; are very to=\r\nuchy about :) Roy has stated his preference many times for\n&gt;&gt; new architect=\r\nural styles to use their own names and not to try and\n&gt;&gt; reuse or redefine =\r\nREST. Roy has also worked hard for many years to\n&gt;&gt; avoid REST the architec=\r\ntural style being confused with HTTP or the\n&gt;&gt; Web. Calling this REST-* is =\r\nakin to renaming web services to SOA-* ;)\n&gt;&gt; The backlash you have already =\r\nseen here I think is similar to what you\n&gt;&gt; could expect from that renaming=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The REST camp should be touchy. =A0They should be hostile. =A0We n=\r\need\n&gt; skeptism. =A0I just hope that we get the acknowledgement when we do\n&gt;=\r\n produce something that is RESTful.\n\nNo doubt that you&#39;ll be able to produc=\r\ne something that&#39;s RESTful, but\nbecause you can doesn&#39;t mean you should.  H=\r\nave you considered that\nthese so called &quot;middleware services&quot; might just be=\r\n best left alone?\nI mean, the same REST constraints that evoke desired prop=\r\nerties in\nmuch of my service to service interaction have predictable\ndisadv=\r\nantages, that would evoke undesired properties in, say, my\nmessaging archit=\r\necture.  I&#39;m completely happy with a hybrid\narchitecture with well-defined =\r\ncriteria for when to use what type of\ninteraction and, given the seeming mi=\r\nsmatch, I&#39;m surprised if others\naren&#39;t too...\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
