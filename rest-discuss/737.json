Because they all have URIs, \nyou\n&gt; can say: &quot;LOOK, I rejected that PO. Here&#39;s the URI.&quot; Of course one\n&gt; cannot necessarily trust one&#39;s business partner so you need to have \na\n&gt; mirror on your side also.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Allowed actions will be constrained by PO state:  for example, a \nPO\n&gt; &gt; in the &quot;fulfilled&quot; state cannot be canceled; a &quot;rejected&quot; order\n&gt; &gt; should not be fulfilled.  In other words, orchestration of \nactions is\n&gt; &gt; conditioned by resource state.  (Not by message sequence.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Another good reason to have separate resources. A fullfilled_PO will\n&gt; simply reject the cancellation POST.\n\nI&#39;m trying to keep an open mind, but having trouble accepting the \nidea of separate resources for a PO depending on its state.  But \nmaybe I don&#39;t understand your proposal.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Do you mean that the PO changes its identity depending on its \nstate? (POs should not change their identity.)\n\n2. Do mean that the history of PO-states-as-resources is persistent? \nThat accepted_po and fulfilled_po co-exist?  In which case, what is \nto prevent one from canceling the accepted_po and ignoring the \nfulfilled_po?  (A PO should be in one and only one state at a time.)\n\nFrom another angle:\n3. Is there something un-RESTful in your view about a PO resource \nthat knows its own state and can respond to transactions accordingly?\nI mean, is there some essential REST difference between &quot;PO in \nfulfilled state&quot; that rejects cancellations and &quot;fulfilled_po&quot; that \nthat rejects cancellations?\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
