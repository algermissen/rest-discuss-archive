Or are you saying\n&gt; that REST doesn&#39;t constrain the client end of connectors?  That \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; make much sense to me.\n\nNo, I am saying that the client receives instructions in the form\nof communication with the server.  HTML FORMs are RESTful because\nthe standard data format HTML contains instructions for how to package\na user-entered form, when to send it, and what method to use.  If the\nclient has received instructions (via representations or header fields)\nthat lead it to believe that sending a particular form of query to\na particular URI with a particular method is something that a user\nmay do from its current state, then a 201 response to that query with\na Location header field is completely defined by the relevant\nspecifications and entirely RESTful in operation.\n\nIn short, if you can draw a state machine in which each state is\nself-described (resident on the client), the transitions from\nthat state are also self-described (instructions for the client\nto initiate), and each transition is invoked using a self-descriptive\nmessage, then you have a RESTful application.  All of the rest\nof the constraints fall out from the need to be self-descriptive\n(i.e., generic methods are necessary because resource-specific\nbehavior is too complex to be self-descriptive).\n\nNote, however, that it isn&#39;t necessary for all components to understand\nall of the semantics.  It is only necessary for them to know when they \ndo\nunderstand them and also when they do not.  That way, applications can \nbe\ndeployed within the subset of the network that does understand without\nadversely impacting the components that do not (assuming they are\nimplemented according to the communication standards).\n\n&gt; My bad.  But my point remains; that RESTfully, resources cannot be\n&gt; expected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the results of \n&gt; the\n&gt; specified query in the POST response, or in the form of another\n&gt; resource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an\n&gt; expectation is not uniform.\n\nThey can if the server told the client that such is expected.\nResource expectations are not uniform.  For example, consider\nthe server-side image map feature that Kevin Hughes developed.\nThat is an instruction to the client that for URI m, requests\nof the form m?x,y will be interpreted as points on the graphical\nplane of the embedded image.  The only change necessary to\nenable that was a modification to the HTML standard (which was\neasy to do back then).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
