We&#39;re currently in the very early stages of planning for new apis for supporting pure REST and HTTP style development. Our goal is to create something simple, lightweight and true to form. We are looking provide a natural API both for the service author and for the consumer. This not an attempt to simply retrofit onto a SOAP based model.\n\nGreat to hear that!\n\nAs you might guess I have quite some thoughts on this :-) Are you thinking about the server- or the client side or both?\n\nOn the server side, I think that the JAX-RS community has done a pretty good job as far as RESTfulness, clarity, and coding efficiency goes so you might want to look at what they did and adapt the approach.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; It would be great to hear thoughts you guys have on what would be the ideal developer experience for using REST. Also if you&#39;d like to be involved we&#39;d welcome the feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
