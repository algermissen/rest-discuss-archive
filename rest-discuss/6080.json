In fact, for a shopping\n&gt;&gt;&gt; application, that&#39;s pretty much what I consider the session to  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; consist\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of.  Therefore, the reference to the back end cart is a session key.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.  The equivalent of a cart for a travel broker is an\n&gt;&gt; itinerary or trip.  I can set one up but not book it, come back later\n&gt;&gt; (another &quot;session&quot;) and book it, come back still later (yet another\n&gt;&gt; session) and add a hotel etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know that anybody does it this way, but the same could happen\n&gt;&gt; to a shopping cart.  Pick some items, come back later and pick some\n&gt;&gt; more, come back still later and check out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Amazon I know does it this way. When I went to look yesterday at how  \n&gt; they do their shopping cart, mine had something I apparently put into  \n&gt; it in January still sitting there, waiting to be purchased.\n\nIt could still be a &quot;session&quot;. Sessions can be persisted to a\nstore. PHP has specific support for handling sessions this way.\n\nIt&#39;s another pattern for mitigating some of the problems with sessions\nthough note that it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of caching.\n\nAnd as I said (in this thread? it&#39;s all so confusing!) pushing the\nsession into a store is really only moving the problem. You then have\nto scale your db backend.\n\nAdmittedly, dbs can scale a bit better than app servers... but there\nare still limits that simple resource management doesn&#39;t have.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
