A lot of servi=\r\nces that are called RESTful but aren&#39;t are there to support AJAX.  One big =\r\nreason they aren&#39;t RESTful tends to be a lack of HATEOS.  But even if you d=\r\no have HATEOS in your AJAX calls, I don&#39;t know of anyone who doesn&#39;t have a=\r\n session on the server to keep track of authentication, which also violates=\r\n REST.  Now, the fact that I don&#39;t know anyone doing it is hardly an exhaus=\r\ntive search.  So the question has to do with REST thus:\n\nCan you use truly =\r\nRESTful web services that require authentication in an AJAX browser-based a=\r\npplication.  The answer to this question, from your answer below, is yes.\nS=\r\nhould you make those web services RESTful? If the answer to this is &quot;no&quot; th=\r\nen I see your point that this has nothing to do with REST (except to answer=\r\n that question).  But I think the answer must be &quot;yes, if it&#39;s feasible&quot;, s=\r\no my question is about whether it is feasible/practical to do.  Is there a =\r\n(good) reason no one seems to be doing it?\nIf you have a requirement to hav=\r\ne a nice, pretty, branded login screen are you already stuck at that point?=\r\n You can, with newer browsers, store the login credentials in a local data =\r\nstore to use on subsequent pages, but is that a good idea?\nSay you only nee=\r\nd to support the newer browsers and you don&#39;t have a problem storing the cr=\r\nedentials in a local store.  You almost certainly have another requirement =\r\nto let a user &quot;sign out&quot; so that subsequent requests do not get automatical=\r\nly authenticated by the browser.  Is this possible?
