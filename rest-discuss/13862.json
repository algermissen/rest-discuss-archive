If this is an accepted practice, and without knowing what \nrepresentations could be relevant to applications over the course of \ntime; does it make sense to ever use negotiated representations for GET \nrequests? Does the distinction between resource and representation have \nany practical value? Arguably not if this is the case.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
