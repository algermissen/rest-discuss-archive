I don&#39;t remember reading anything\nspecific covering it in the list archive, so I&#39;m posting it now. :)\n\nI&#39;d like clarification about how to handle long run back end\nprocesses. For example:\n\n===\nPOST /reportmaker HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nLocation: http://foo.com/report/newid\n===\nGET /report/newid HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n===\n\nIf the report has not been created (work is in progress), what should\nI return?\n\nHere are some of my thoughts:\n1. A 204 No Content status code doesn&#39;t fit. 204 states that the\nprocessing was completed but there is no content, which this is not\nthe case.\n2. Return a 200 status code, and set the Content-Type header field to\nsomething like &quot;application/X-status-message&quot;. The body could be an\nXML document detailing the status. Upon completion, the proper content\nand content-type will be returned.\n3. Return a 200 and an X-Status header with some in-progress status\nmessage.\n4. Return a 200 and an X-Status header with no body.\n5. A 202 Accepted doesn&#39;t make sense. Using this would imply that\nserver accepted the GET for processing, not the original POST.\n\nI&#39;m thinking that either 2, 3 or 4 would be the best options (3 and 4\nare essentially the same). I&#39;m gravitating towards 2.\n\nA slight tangent: I also thought of a different design that I would\nprefer not to use for a reason I will state later:\n\n===\nPOST /reportordermaker HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: http://foo.com/orders/newid\n===\nGET /orders/newid HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n&lt;order&gt;\n  &lt;status&gt;notdone&lt;/status&gt;\n&lt;/order&gt;\n===\nGET /orders/newid HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n&lt;order&gt;\n  &lt;status&gt;done&lt;/status&gt;\n  &lt;location&gt;http://foo.com/report/newid&lt;/location&gt;\n&lt;/order&gt;\n===\nGET /report/newid HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.com\n\n... etc ...\n===\n\nThe reason I don&#39;t want to create orders is that the reportmaker will\nwant to generate a report and return a 201 Created (along with\ncontent) on the first POST by default. But there may be cases where\nthe process will take a long time, so I will want to return a 202\naccepted. I would prefer to be able to return the report on the\nmajority of the POST requests than to for the client software to\nprocess multiple round trips of the second example (reportordermaker).\n\nComments?\n\nThanks,\nBen\n\n\n\n\n"}}
