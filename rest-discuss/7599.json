Like it or not, both the hypertext and the\n: &gt; : URI are part of the user interface of a web application.\n: &gt;\n: &gt; Yes, but the constraints on &quot;good hypertext&quot; are not the same\n: &gt; as the constraints on &quot;good URI&quot;.  So when the information\n: &gt; architecture\n: &gt; changes, where are you?\n:\n: You&#39;re right, there it is much more cumbersome to change the URI than\n: the representation, because people and software may have linked to,\n: bookmarked, indexed, etc., that page at that URI. That&#39;s one reason\n: it is so important to think hard about what your URIs should be in\n: the first place. But you *can* change them and then redirect the old\n: URIs to the new one.\n:\n: For example, to log into Artima, originally I used a JSP that came\n: with Jive software, and the URL was:\n:\n: http://www.artima.com/login.jsp\n:\n: I stopped using JSP at one point and switched to simply indicating\n: what came back was HTML with a .html extension:\n:\n: http://www.artima.com/login.html\n:\n: Then I decided the name of the page should match the link to it,\n: which was &quot;sign in&quot; not &quot;log in,&quot; so I changed it to:\n:\n: http://www.artima.com/signin.html\n:\n: Then I read something, maybe &quot;Cool URIs Don&#39;t Change,&quot; that convinced\n: me that I shouldn&#39;t put the .html on the end. I also read something\n: about search engines that indicated that words separated by\n: underscores would be indexed. So I changed it to:\n:\n: http://www.artima.com/sign_in\n:\n: All the old forms redirect to the latest one. No broken links. No\n: lost Google juice. Changing URIs can be done, it&#39;s just not as easy\n: or advisable as changing representations.\n\nWell, the above is a story of the kind of obsession I think\nwe ought not fall into.  It comes from valuing the wrong\nthings, IMO.  Sorry.\n\n: It isn&#39;t just users typing into the address bar, but users simply\n: looking at the URI to get an idea of where they are in the info\n: architecture.\n\nWe&#39;re circling round and round.  &quot;Where we are in the info\narchitecture&quot; is not a primary concern.  A primary concern is\nwhere to need to be next and how to get there.  Good hypertext\nis the way.  But stick to tea leaves if you like.  I&#39;m tired.\n\n\n Yes, you can be successful with ugly URIs. Amazon has\n: certainly trained their users to not try and figure out where they\n: are based on the URI. But I still think short, crisp, meaningful URIs\n: make a web app more user-friendly.\n\nUgly or beautiful, they are just tokens in a system that is rich with\nlegitimate description, if you do it right.\n\n: &gt; Oh, well in my analysis, &quot;canonical URI&quot; and &quot;canonical URI form&quot;\n: &gt; are two radically different ideas.\n: &gt;\n: I&#39;m curious how you define these two differently?\n\nI haven&#39;t seen these terms laid out anywhere.  So I&#39;m just applying\nthe rules of English grammar.  The former simply says the one URI\nis the preferred and all other equivalents are aliases.  The latter is\na matter of specifying the arrangement of meaningful fragments within\nthe URI string so it can be understood.\n\nI think the first is good practice, while the second is marginally\nuseful, but tends to compete with better solutions.  To summarize.\n\nWalden \n\n\n"}}
