If two pieces of information have different\n&gt;permissions relating to them then it should be because they are\n&gt;representations of two different (if related) resources that in turn\n&gt;should have two different URIs.\n\nConsider a &#39;/MyHome&#39; resource that is, admittedly, just a shortcut to\n&#39;/Home/me&#39;, but is still useful, just like ~/ is useful in shells.\n\n&gt;I don&#39;t think the inclusion or exclusion of sensitive data is\n&gt;comparable to the other reasons for content negotiation (content type,\n&gt;content language etc.).\n\nWhat about niceties like not exposing knobs to the user that the user\ncan&#39;t twiddle? For instance, an admin-level user will have options\nto modify a resource that a normal user won&#39;t have available... or\nwhat about something like user-definable formatting prefs? I like my\n/datetime resource formatted differently than you do, so my display of\nthis data is different than yours, based on us having different logins.\n\n&gt;The main reason for taking the approach of varying content per user\n&gt;in traditional web applications is to offer a limited-view rendering\n&gt;rather than a full-view-with-errors rendering. In the case of an\n&gt;application which is giving a human user (or another process) a\n&gt;view onto information obtained from a web service then it can do\n&gt;the necessary attempts to download restricted data and hence the\n&gt;limited-view pattern is possible by using several URIs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Even in the case of a browser-based web app using XSLT this would be\n&gt;possible if it were possible to trap errors with document() calls. Alas\n&gt;whether the errors are signalled or not is implementation-defined.\n\nWell, I see the issue as basically resource-specific gradations between\n&#39;full access&#39; and &#39;401 Unauthorized&#39;. The extremes are clearly allowed;\nwhy not the middle?\n\n  --pj\n\n\n"}}
