I am just voicing my thought on the\n&gt; use of xhtml as the way a Restful api would return data content that\n&gt; most likely is not going to be rendered in a browser for display, but\n&gt; used in some other manner. To me that is what XML is for.. and\n&gt; perhaps that is because it&#39;s ingrained in so many of us that XML is\n&gt; for that purpose that it&#39;s hard to get around that for me.\n&gt; \n\nCode on Demand is used, from HTML, to read in your JSON or XML data.\nIt is not required that the HTML be consumed.  Stop thinking about HTML\nas something only meant to render documents in browsers, think of it\ninstead as a standardized set of semantics for describing hypertext\nAPIs.  Doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with browsers, but its\npresence allows the API to be learned/debugged using a browser, and\ndoesn&#39;t prevent anyone from interacting exclusively with an underlying\ndata type.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
