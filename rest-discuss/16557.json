Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt;\r\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: To use registered media-types or not?\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=266460716\r\n\r\nAnt=F3nio Mota wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nothing in Roy quote says that registry MUST be =\r\nIANA.\n&gt; \n\nNo, but it does say there must be a registry, and only one regist=\r\nry is\ndefined for the Web.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Both RFC2046 and RFC4288 clearly say that t=\r\nhere are IANA unregistered\n&gt; types that start with X-\n&gt; \n\nNonstandardized t=\r\nypes aren&#39;t used in the REST style.  Only standardized\ntypes may be registe=\r\nred, not experimental types.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s nowhere nothing to prevent thos X=\r\n- types to be registered\n&gt; privatly.\n&gt;\n\nExcept there is only one registry o=\r\nn the Web, IANA.  Re-stating your\nargument over and over won&#39;t change the r=\r\neality of the situation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if I register in my company the X-media-=\r\ntypes I want and all the\n&gt; interested parties agree with that, I have a reg=\r\nistry that points to a\n&gt; specification and the specification explains how t=\r\no process the data\n&gt; according to its intent. So I have self-descriptive me=\r\ndia-types not\n&gt; registered with IANA.\n&gt; \n\nAre you talking about the Web?  I=\r\nf you&#39;re talking intranet, you&#39;re\nagreeing with me (please don&#39;t let that g=\r\nive you a heart attack).\n\nOtherwise, what you describe is an application-sp=\r\necific library-based\nAPI coupling implementations together, which is not th=\r\ne REST style.\nREST defines a decoupled, uniform interface, network-based AP=\r\nI as being\nbased on standardized, registered types -- design by constraint =\r\nvs.\nunbounded creativity.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re going again to talk about the inte=\r\nrmediaries and the slogans\n&gt; &quot;serendipity&quot;, &quot;anarchic-scaling&quot; and the like=\r\n, let me remember that\n&gt; none of those are *constraints* of a REST system.\n=\r\n&gt;\n\nOf course not, they&#39;re desirable effects of REST.  Which you will NOT\nre=\r\nalize by NOT following REST, i.e. by using opaque identifiers and\nnonstanda=\r\nrdized types.  Do you have some other explanation of those\nterms, besides m=\r\ny usage which comes from Roy&#39;s thesis?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The only constraint that are re=\r\nlated to the intermediaries is cache -\n&gt; and that is obtained by having the=\r\n intermediaries treating\n&gt; \n\nNo, the self-descriptive messaging constraint =\r\nis required, that&#39;s why\nit&#39;s called a constraint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; application/x.mytopi=\r\nc+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; as if it was\n&gt; \n&gt; application/xml\n&gt; Please note that things like=\r\n pre-caching, accelarators and other\n&gt; features of intermediaries *are not*=\r\n REST constraints, cache is.\n&gt; \n\nREST&#39;s cache constraints are irrelevant if=\r\n your messaging fails to be\nself-descriptive.  There is nothing self-descri=\r\nptive about application/\nxml, and REST is all about unambiguously specifyin=\r\ng your intended\nprocessing model.  Specifying application/foo+xml is a good=\r\n way to not\nget cached by any cache configured based on the shared understa=\r\nnding of\na limited number of ubiquitous types and ignoring *all* undefined =\r\ntypes.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, if you&#39;re going to object with what you called &quot;collision=\r\ns&quot;, it\n&gt; is true that they can happen with regular, non-X-types if they are=\r\n not\n&gt; registered in IANA, but that won&#39;t happen if they are of X-type.\n&gt;\n\n=\r\nThat&#39;s why they&#39;re called &quot;experimental&quot; and not &quot;standardized&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Becau=\r\nse the registration of a X-type outside IANA assumes the\n&gt; pre-agreement be=\r\ntween the interested parties, so if they agree to use\n&gt; them they also know=\r\n where they are registered. So, the only collision\n&gt; that couls eventually =\r\nhappen is on intermediaries, but if you&#39;re\n&gt; using a X-type that won&#39;t happ=\r\nen either because they will treat\n&gt; application/x.mytopic+xml as if it was =\r\napplication/xml.\n&gt; \n\nSo, even if the chair of w3c&#39;s TAG signs up here and t=\r\nells you that I&#39;m\nright (Nathan), you still insist I must be wrong?  On the=\r\n Web,\nregistered media types are those in the IANA registry, not\nexperiment=\r\nal, unregistered types.  If you don&#39;t believe anyone who\ntries telling you =\r\nthis, then what&#39;s the point of further answering your\nquestions?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also,=\r\n if you&#39;re invoking the &quot;everibody&quot; or &quot;anybody&quot; argument,\n&gt; please let me =\r\nstate again that the Web is as much about &quot;everibody&quot;\n&gt; or &quot;anybody&quot; as is,=\r\n like Roy, RFC2046 and RFC4288 says, about\n&gt; &quot;participants in the communica=\r\ntion&quot; (Roy), &quot;consenting\n&gt; systems&quot;(RFC2046) and &quot;parties exchanging&quot; (RFC4=\r\n288).\n&gt; \n\nIf nobody outside the sender and intended recipient can participa=\r\nte in\nyour communications over the Web, then the failure on your part is th=\r\nat\nyou&#39;ve created an application-specific library-based API to couple\nimple=\r\nmentations together.  REST defines a decoupled, uniform interface\nnetwork-b=\r\nased API based on standardized types with registered\nidentifiers -- THAT&#39;S =\r\nTHE STYLE -- not experimental unregistered types.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Finnally, let me sa=\r\ny also that I found very strange that you think\n&gt; that are some REST/HTTP r=\r\nules for the internet and others for the\n&gt; intanets, when t\n&gt;\n\nOf course th=\r\nere are.  REST isn&#39;t limited to the Web.  HTTP isn&#39;t\nlimited to the Web.  I=\r\nf we were required to make everything exactly\nmatch exactly how the Web beh=\r\naves, the protocols wouldn&#39;t be re-usable.\nBut _of course_ the requirements=\r\n vary from one instantiation to another.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
