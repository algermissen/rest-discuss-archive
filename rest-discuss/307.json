Next point.\n\n&gt; &gt; (d) If you&#39;re using HTTP to do RPCs, you aren&#39;t using HTTP\n&gt;\n&gt; Uhm.  So, SOAP and XML-RPC aren&#39;t using HTTP?\n\nIt may be possible to use SOAP with HTTP --- Mark&#39;s got a better read on the current\nstate of that effort (keeping SOAP from becoming unavoidably RPC-based) than I do.\nIt&#39;s almost certainly *not* possible to use XML-RPC with HTTP without breaking HTTP.\nI.e., if you use e.g. XML-RPC, you aren&#39;t using HTTP, you&#39;re tunneling RPCs through\nHTTP.\n\n&gt; blah blah blah.  I think most web apps (of\n&gt; which terrorist_or_not.coom is an example) are\n&gt; RPC.  The issue here is whether they are or\n&gt; aren&#39;t.\n\nI don&#39;t have any issue here.  I think you&#39;re probably right --- most probably are.\nBut that doesn&#39;t really say anything except that most developers don&#39;t really\nunderstand HTTP, and it&#39;s easier for them to superimpose their own procedural or OO\nview of the world on top of HTTP.\n\n&gt; The other RESTers here seemed to have no problem\n&gt; with the overall design of posting\n&gt; multipart/form-data to some URL.\n\nI&#39;m lost again.  I don&#39;t have any problem with the idea of posting any particular kind\nof data to some URL, cf. my own example.\n\n&gt; I just fail to see why that is REST.\n\nIt&#39;s REST because it&#39;s HTTP.  That&#39;s what POST *is for,* per the HTTP spec.\n\n&gt; I think you and I agree that it isn&#39;t.  Perhaps\n&gt; if you explain why to Mark and Paul, they will\n&gt; understand it better than if I do. ;-)\n\nMark and Paul aren&#39;t objecting to the use of POST in this fashion per se, AFAICT.\nPerhaps they could comment.  I find it hard to see why they would.  I suspect that\nyou&#39;re failing to understand their objections.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
