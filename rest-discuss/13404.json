The other day some guy tried to convince our =\r\nsound guy at church we should be $5,000 more &quot;because we provide service&quot;, =\r\nand apparently intimated we were stupid.  Yeah, thanks dude, like I really =\r\nneed your &quot;service&quot; to show me how to plug in a cable.\n\nSame principal appl=\r\nies here.  You don&#39;t need to form an organization to do what you are doing,=\r\n and you don&#39;t need REST sticker-tagged all over it.
