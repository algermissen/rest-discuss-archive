Smacks a little too much of A.I. (with the\n    R&gt; same sort of 70&#39;s-80&#39;s hype attached).\n\nNot so -- it&#39;s more likely to be implemented by massively distributed\nhuman intelligence, for example, through inferences gleened by sifting\nblog-like RDF metadata not unlike the way Google now reverts to it&#39;s\nguess at spelling mistakes if the first search turns up empty.\n\n    R&gt; Searching for web-services using Google/Yahoo I agree with, but\n    R&gt; only if there&#39;s money in it for them. My prediction is that\n    R&gt; once the tire-kicking is over with, you&#39;ll see a rise of\n    R&gt; &#39;for-pay&#39; web-services and then Google will start listing them\n    R&gt; and charging people for &#39;sponsored&#39; listings.\n\nI still see Internet as an advertising medium.  We advertise our goods,\nour services, our ideas, our experiences, and webservice discovery is\nreally &quot;find me all commercials for ...&quot;\n\nI also haven&#39;t seen any really compelling for-pay services except in\nvery narrow professional domains (where either someone else pays on\nyour behalf or you fold the costs into your own webservice-advertised\ngoods).  The old saw that &quot;professional editing&quot; produces somehow\nbetter journalism falls apart when you simply take a look through the\neons of microfilm stockpiled at the NYT -- it&#39;s based on the\nunsupportable myth that the journalism of our childhood was somehow\nmore reliable than your average blog.  It wasn&#39;t.\n\nDitto for stock quotes, IMHO.  Reacting to the reported prices is not\nnearly as useful as inside information about impending price changes ;)\n\nMy prediction is that, once the &quot;golly-gee whiz&quot; of the Internet wears\noff (as it has already done for the under 25 crowd) for-fee services\nwill find their otherwise-sponsored bretheren overtaking them at an\nalarming rate.\n\n    R&gt; As for the move from HTML to XML, I honestly don&#39;t think any\n    R&gt; mainstream site-builder is going to switch from their fancy\n    R&gt; HTML/Flash interface to an XML-XSLT-&gt; HTML setting\n\nThere&#39;s nothing incompatible here.  XML/SVG-&gt;XSLT-+-&gt;HTML\n                                                  +-&gt;RDF\n                                                  +-&gt;...\n\nWhat is needed is the need for the other formats as seen by the\naverage website (who is presently still in golly-gee land).  When they\nunderstand how their webservices are their public face, they will\nanneal to being more effective at it (compare TV commercials from 1952\nwith 1972).  When they realize that information overload has lead the\ndesktop vendors to produce Meerkat-like semantic surfers, they will\ndemand the Dreamweavers give them tools to leverage that sales\nchannel.\n\n    R&gt; The more obvious driver will be people creating XML-based\n    R&gt; services *then* putting an HTML front-end on it instead of the\n    R&gt; other way round.\n\nThe driver I expect will be all under the hood.  People will still\ncreate their stories online, only with the requirement that it &quot;also\nfeeds those meerkat things&quot; and they won&#39;t care a hoot about RFC&#39;s.\nVendors, on the other hand, already know that the most efficient\nlowest common denominator formats for storage and exchange are XMLs.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy &lt;garym@...&gt; TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n&quot;Computers are useless.
