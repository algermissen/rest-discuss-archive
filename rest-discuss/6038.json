I&#39;m implementing a web application, and implementation is  \n&gt; exactly what I&#39;m talking about. Your original post claimed that HTTP  \n&gt; and REST are flawed because they don&#39;t have sessions.\n\nYep, and there&#39;s some pretty heavy duty denial that goes on around the \nissue. :P\n\nI&#39;ve had all the opportunity I wanted to have made my point on this \nissue by now, so I won&#39;t belabour it.\n\n&gt; If you change how you think about implementing your application, \n&gt; does your perceived requirement for sessions go away?\n\nNo. I acknowledge that there are two nouns which dictate the &#39;context&#39; \nof a HTTP request. I have explained these as the &#39;subject&#39; and the \n&#39;object&#39;. REST states that the &#39;resource&#39; (the object) is the &#39;semantic \nthing&#39; which a URL describes (which is true), but then it says that \nstate representations of the resource are generated for a request (which \nI contend). It&#39;s superficial (in my view) to say that the response \nentity is a representation of the state of the resource because this \nother thing, the &#39;subject&#39;, can modify response semantics. I.e. a \nresponse isn&#39;t just for,\n\n  GET /resource\n\nIt&#39;s for either,\n\n  Someone GETs /resource\n\nOr,\n\n  Joe GETs /resource\n\nIn each case, the overall semantics of the request (and the \nrepresentation generated) may be varied by this additional context. The \nsimplest case in point being that we put &quot;Good Morning %Username%&quot; at \nthe top of every page. So it&#39;s not just a representation of the state of \na resource. It&#39;s the representation of the state of the resource at a \npoint in time *with respect to a user&#39;s session*.\n\n&gt; What it showed me was that a good way to think about designing web  \n&gt; applications is &quot;resource-oriented design,&quot; to give it a name. In  \n&gt; designing a C++ program, I might ask myself, &#39;What are the objects?&#39;.  \n&gt; In designing a web application, I would ask myself, &#39;What are the  \n&gt; resources?&#39;.\n\nYes, but in answering your question, you&#39;ve done the metaphorical \nequivalent of using structured programming techniques in C++.\n\nWhat you&#39;ve done, in my view, (as I&#39;ve said before, but I&#39;ll try one \nlast time), is you&#39;ve put a &#39;session key&#39; for &#39;server side session \nstate&#39; in the URL. You&#39;ve done something a little bit more complicated \nthan that (in an effort to allow users to return to prior states using \ntheir web browser), and instead of &#39;session key&#39; you&#39;ve called it \n&#39;shopping basket snapshot&#39;, and instead of &#39;mutable server side session \nstate&#39;, you&#39;ve called it &#39;conversational state&#39;, but that hasn&#39;t changed \nwhat it effectively is.\n\nI certainly do appreciate that you would want to ask the question &quot;What \nare the resources?&quot; when you design your web application. Here&#39;s a \n&#39;stateless&#39; shopping basket:\n\n  /basket?o=(P23,1,US$3)&o=(p42,3,US$7)\n\nThat&#39;s 1x Product 23 @ US$3 ea., and 3x Product 42 @ US$7 ea. The thing \nis, we weren&#39;t talking about something like this. We were talking about \nmutable server side session state. I was merely running the case that \nall you want to &#39;key&#39; such state is a &#39;session token&#39;.\n\nIn your case, what you&#39;re trying to do is get a shopping basket \nresource. But this isn&#39;t such a thing:\n\n  /basket?z=9sdf23kj5has\n\nThis is:\n\n  /basket?o=(P23,1,US$3)&o=(p42,3,US$7)\n\nThe latter is the resource that you probably want if you want to be a \nREST officiando. The resource that you propose conflates an estranged \nnotion of &#39;session key&#39; with some semi-immutable transient server side \nstate.\n\nI&#39;m sorry my tone has been somewhat cold and brutal during this \nconversation. Thanks for having the patience to hear me out and talk \nthrough the issues with me. I&#39;ve just been trying to get to the bottom \nof a few of these things and have endeavoured to stick to logic and \nreason. To the extent that I might come across as vicious or aggressive, \nI hope you realise that&#39;s not my intent. (Personally, I prefer the \ndescription &#39;lively&#39;. :)\n\nRegards,\nJohn Elliot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
