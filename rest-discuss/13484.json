Maybe I was reading into \n&gt; what you were saying a little, but you seemed to be implying that the \n&gt; link header should be preferred over using hypermedia, the hypermedia \n&gt; only expressing links that could not be expressed with a link header. \n&gt; That is what I have issue with.\n&gt;   \n\nWhy? It depends on what the system requirements are, surely?\n\n&gt; I think having links in both the headers and the hypermedia is ok too \n&gt; if you think you need it. I think we&#39;ve been writing spiders for years \n&gt; now with out it so I&#39;m not totally sold on the utility but I don&#39;t \n&gt; think it&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot;. The HEAD optimization you mention is interesting, \n&gt; but I wonder how useful the yeilded links are in practice when you \n&gt; lack the context of the resource representation. You end up knowing \n&gt; that there&#39;s this &quot;thing&quot; that links to this other &quot;thing&quot; with a \n&gt; certain class of relationship, but you know very little about the \n&gt; &quot;things&quot;. But I suppose it all depends on what you are trying to do.\n&gt;   \n\nIs that much different from, say, HTML?\n\n&gt; Your statement on how the &quot;human&quot; web and the &quot;machine&quot; web are \n&gt; different and require a paradigm shift needs backing up\n&gt;   \n\n\nHumans are intelligent.\n\napparently!\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
