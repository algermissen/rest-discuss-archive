Then the client knows that it can POST to the\n&gt; subscription-URI to get a subscription for this resource.\n...\n&gt; This maintains the virtue of allowing *any resource* to declare that it\n&gt; is watchable without out-of-band arrangement. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; preserve. I don&#39;t want a bunch of conventions that client and server\n&gt; have to agree to use through email. For simple cases I want it to &quot;just\n&gt; work&quot;.\n\nI agree that avoiding out of band arrangements is a primary goal, but I believe\nthat WSDL already meets this need.  In addition, this is metadata about an\napplication, not protocol-level functionality, so supporting it via special HTTP\nheaders etc violates opacity.\n\nProposed solution: have a single out-of-band communication to specify how to\nfind the WSDL description.  For example:\n&quot;The service provider MAY choose to have a file named watch_services.wsdl at\n&lt;some well known location&gt;&quot;.\n\nAt least one incantation will have to be involved, because the service\ndescription bootstraps the entire interaction.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
