Does the value returned when a third party GETs\na resource change before your transaction that\nmodified that resource COMMITs/ABORTs?\n\n2. Does your transaction fail if any of the values\nit retrieved via GET changes before you try to\nCOMMIT?\n\nIf #1==yes, you don&#39;t have Atomicity.\nIf #1==no, you might not have REST (GET depends on a cookie or conneg).\nIf #2==yes, you don&#39;t have HTTP (GET is not idempotent).\nIf #2==no, you don&#39;t have Consistency (You can&#39;t guarantee not to violate invariants)\n\n#2 means that transactions are incompatible w/ HTTP.\n#1 means that they may also be independtly incompatible with REST.\n\nWhether #1==no is compatibility with REST depends\non whether Roy blesses transaction headers as\nbeing more like Con-Neg or condemns them as being\nmore like Cookies.\n\nNote: They feel more like Cookies to me.  But I am\nnot Roy.\n\n-Alex-\n\nPS The ATM/Wire question is not about support for\nACID, it is about what operators are available for\nyour data.  For example, your DBMS might expose an\nincrement operator.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.

Maybe\n&gt; &gt; I am just not grasping the finer details, but this doesn&#39;t seem like a\n&gt; &gt; valid REST approach.  And to complicate it more, suppose that I had\n&gt; &gt; performed a T-DELETE instead.  Now, the URI returns an Etag of &quot;1&quot; and\n&gt; &gt; the T-URI is no longer mapped.  Again, this does not feel RESTful at\n&gt; &gt; all.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are many ways to implement transactions (meaning: making several\n&gt; actions seem atomic).  Isolation is not a property of transactions -- it\n&gt; is only a property of workspaces (one implementation of transactions).\n&gt; If you insist on having that property, then you&#39;ll have to live with\n&gt; its limitations as well.  For example, do you want a wire transfer\n&gt; deposit to fail just because you happen to be using your ATM card\n&gt; at the same time?  The fact is that many simultaneous transactions\n&gt; can safely take place on the same resources if you don&#39;t force the\n&gt; server into a single model.  The right thing to do is tell the server\n&gt; what you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation\n&gt; according to the types of resources it is trying to protect.\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
