In this case, I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not clear\n&gt; that there is such a separate identity.\n\nMore to the point, technically:  if you intend for the separate \ntranslations to be referenced independently, then each translation \nshould have a different URI.  And, orthogonally, if you intend *the \nwork itself* to be referenced, then it too should have a URI.\n\nThere&#39;s a very sound case for giving two different translations of the \nsame work *three* URIs.\n\nMy point in general, flip though it might have been, was this:  the \nthing in-the-abstract is interesting in itself.  Interesting things \nshould have a URI.\n\nConneg isn&#39;t a bad thing, but --- really --- one shouldn&#39;t get dogmatic \nabout it.  URIs are cheap.  Use as many as makes sense.  But always \ngive the abstract thing of interest --- at least --- a name.  It&#39;s \nuseful.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
