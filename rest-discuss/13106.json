An XML namespace declaration is a key into a sch=\r\nema. Media type values are typically encountered by a client prior to its g=\r\netting into the thick of a resource representation: to get to a namespace d=\r\neclarations, on the other hand, the client has to dig around in the represe=\r\nntation. \n\nA decent (hyper) media processing model describes:\n\nHow to ident=\r\nify hypermedia controls - links and forms - in representations belonging to=\r\n that type\nApplication protocol idioms - eg. HTTP verbs, headers and status=\r\n codes - that can be used to manipulate resources belonging to that media t=\r\nype\nOne or more resourec representation schemas\n\nA schema, as keyed by an X=\r\nML namespace declaration, simply conveys structural information: it doesn&#39;t=\r\n help the client understand how the server would prefer the representation =\r\ninterpreted and processed.\n\nThere&#39;s a potential one-to-many relationship be=\r\ntween a media type and its associated hypermedia controls: a given media ty=\r\npe might, for example, define both links and forms. Atom defines only links=\r\n. More generally, there&#39;s a whole bunch of potential many-to-many relations=\r\nhips between media types, specifications, schemas, resources, representatio=\r\nn formats and namespaces.\n\nAtom defines one media type. AtomPub adds anothe=\r\nr two, one describing the processing model for category documents, another =\r\nfor service documents.\n\n(I started down the hyper media processing model ro=\r\nute some time ago after Mark Baker pointed Jim, Savas and myself at http://=\r\nwww.markbaker.ca/blog/2004/09/why-namespaces-dont-replace-media-types/  It&#39;=\r\ns not Mark&#39;s fault if I&#39;ve just confused the issue)\n\nKind regards\n\nian\n\n\n\n\n"}}
