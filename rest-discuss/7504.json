But I think you \n&gt; are trying to design a web in which clients learn you rules \n&gt; of hierarchy and then navigate your site by synthesizing \n&gt; URL&#39;s by following the rules.\n\nThe benefits accrue to web users but more so to website owners.  For web\nusers it increases the intuitiveness of a website and, if they are bloggers\nor cite links in some other activity, it makes it easier for them to do so.\n\nFor one example, look at Wikipedia&#39;s URLs; is it a wonder there are linked\nas often at they are? \n\n\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\n\nIF it were instead\n\n\t\nhttp://www.wikipedia.org/topic.php?topicID=7937521&lang=en-US&source-ie7&en-\nUS&ie=utf8&oe=utf8\n\nI can guarantee you it would not be linked as much.  I could remember and\ncompose the former, there is no way I could remember the latter (FYI, I\nfrequently like to Wikipedia just by prefixing a term with\n&quot;www.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;)\n\nAnd when people link a site, the benefits acrue to the site.\n\nIf I&#39;m at a party and someone asked me about some pictures I took, I can\njust tell them to go to:\n\n\thttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschinkel\n\nMy earlier albums on Snapfish.com, which are only visible if I send and\ninvite, have a URL like this to access (WTF?!?):\n\n\t\nhttp://www1.snapfish.co.uk/share/p=12481168315141016/l=238932350/g=25011088/\ncobrandOid=1007/otsc=SYE/otsi=SALB\n\nI share an appreciation for motorcycles with my dad.  I like to send him\nlinks in email. Let&#39;s assume the link breaks. Which one is he likely to be\nable to fix? (and which one is least likely to break?)\n\n\thttp://www.suzukicycles.com/Products/DRZ400SMK7/\n\thttp://www.kawasaki.com/Products/Detail.aspx?id=201\n\thttp://www.yamaha-motor.com/sport/products/modelhome/180/0/home.aspx\n\t\nhttp://powersports.honda.com/motorcycles/sport/model.asp?ModelName=RC51&Mode\nlYear=2006&ModelId=RVT1000R6\n\n\nBut if they were this instead this, it would be much easier for dad to\nidentify and fix those broken links (and much less likely they&#39;d break):\n\n\thttp://www.suzukicycles.com/bikes/drz400sm/2007/\n\thttp://www.kawasaki.com/bikes/ninja-650r/2007/\n\thttp://www.yamaha-motor.com/bikes/fjr12300a/2007/\n\thttp://powersports.honda.com/bikes/rc51/2006/\n\nNow, let&#39;s say that I wanted to send him a link to look at the 50th\nAnniversary Sportster. See the link below? Tell me what I should send him.\nGo head. Open it up. And tell me what link.\n\n\t\nhttp://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/2007_Motorcycles/2007_Motor\ncycles.jsp?locale=en_US&bmLocale=en_US\n\nNow what if I wrote a blog article about that same motorcycle; what would I\nlink to?  (Well, it&#39;s okay, I&#39;d never send dad a link to a Harley or blog\nabout one either. ;-)\n\nSo you see, there as so many small reasons why well designed URLs are a\nbenefit. But if you don&#39;t drill down to see those ways, it doesn&#39;t seem like\nmuch at 50,000 feet.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, URIs are supposed to be opaque from the client \n&gt; angle, and it should by hypertext that is guiding them along \n&gt; the path from one resource to the next.  Have you read up \n&gt; much on these concepts?\n\nFunny you should mention the URI Opacity Axiom[1]. Over the past 3-4 months,\nI&#39;ve probably read at least the first 100 references returned by googling\n&quot;uri opacity.&quot;  At this point, I&#39;m going to go out an a limb and say I&#39;ve\ngot a really good grasp of that ole&#39; uri opacity axiom.  What&#39;s more, I&#39;ve\nvery closely followed the metaDataInURIs[2] finding by TAG (have you read\nthat one?)\n\nWhat all this research has told me is the vast majority of people\nmisinterpret the URI Opacity axiom, attempt to apply it far more broadly\nthan it was ever intended to be applied, and do so with such a zeal that I\nwonder why this false doctrine has so excited their imaginations.  And I\ndon&#39;t say it&#39;s been misinterpreted because &quot;I interpreted it correctly when\nothers failed.&quot;  No, I&#39;m not that arrogant. I say it because I&#39;ve seen\nspecific and explicit guidance given by TimBL and RoyTF on mailing list\ndiscussions I&#39;ve found during my research clarifying the issue.\n\nIn a nutshell, it goes like this:\n\n1.) A URI should be considered opaque by a client if the URI authority\n(server) has given it no explicit guidance.\n\n2.) The URI authority (server) need not treat it&#39;s URLs as opaque; indeed a\nserver SHOULD organize its URLs logically and understandably to humans.\n\n3.) In the case of a URL, the only part that needs to be considered opaque\nis the path because the rest is specified (okay, an uninformed client shant\nlook at domains names like looking at &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; and guessing it is\nEnglish and hence de.wikipedia.org would be German.)\n\n4.) HOWEVER, a URI authority (server) is free to provide explicit guidance\nto a client and which point the client is free to treat the URIs as\ntransparent.\n\n5.) Further, the URI Opacity concern is related to *machines*, not humans\nbecause humans have an error correcting mechanism called intelligence.  If\nthey go to the &quot;/cart/&quot; URL and it displays information about wheelbarrows\ninstead of a shopping cart, the human can figure it out and continue\nlooking. The machine is yet to be capable until programmed in advance for\nthat problem.\n\nSo, nothing in my prior examples violates the URI Opacity Axiom[1] in any\nway.  My examples actually follows the TAG finding[2] section &quot;2.5: URIs\nthat are convenient for people to use&quot;, empowers &quot;2.2: Guessing information\nfrom a URI&quot;, and leverages &quot;2.4: Authority use of URI metadata.&quot;\n\nIronically, cleaner and more obvious URLs are more likely to be transcribed\nconsistently then URLs with lots of query parameters that are 2 to 3 times\nas long and almost impossible for non-programmers to read. In this way these\nclean URLs improve cache efficiency.\n\nBecause URI Opacity is so misinterpreted and for some reason has been\nmisrepresented with such a passion, I plan to write a much longer blog\narticle on the subject once I&#39;m able to gather all my research (probably 2-3\nmonths from now.)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque\n[2] http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31\n\n\n"}}
