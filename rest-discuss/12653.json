One is to have the cancel state as part of the order.\n=\r\n&gt; THen I can just put a new representation with the cancelled state set to\n=\r\n&gt; true:\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT /orders/333\n&gt; content-type: application/xml\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;order id=\r\n=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;cancelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems kinda h=\r\neavy to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that =\r\nyou could put\n&gt; or post to to change the state?\n&gt;\n&gt; /orders/333/cancelled\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt; /orders/333?cancel=3Dtrue\n&gt;\n&gt; You don&#39;t even need to send data to=\r\n change the state in this scenario.\n&gt; But the problem with this from a pure=\r\n RESTful standpoint is, isn&#39;t this\n&gt; a mini-RPC? My thought at first is YES=\r\n IT IS....\n&gt;\n&gt; .... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEO=\r\nAS\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=3D&quot;http://exampl=\r\ne.com/orders/333/cancelled&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I have a CANCEL lin=\r\nk that if I follow changes the state of my\n&gt; resource. Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCi=\r\nsh now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a link.\n&gt; Maybe the answer is /orders/333/c=\r\nancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by itself,\n&gt; but when combined with HATEOAS it =\r\nis?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkec=\r\nentral.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
