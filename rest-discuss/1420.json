We started\n&gt; building our product back in spring of 2000, and now we&#39;re\n&gt; finding out that we&#39;ve incorporated a lot of RESTful features.\n&gt; At the moment we&#39;re working on putting together a developer\n&gt; release for people to play with until we can get to a Beta\n&gt; release.\n\nThat&#39;s great.  We should try to provide a place on RESTwiki (if it doesn&#39;t\nalready exist) that starts to collect references to some of these efforts.  I\nfeel like I&#39;m at the same location in development as you are, so it will be\ninteresting to share our interpretations of REST once the work goes public.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
