It&#39;s definined to really mean\n&gt; &gt; &quot;store&quot; more than &quot;set the state&quot;, so it is expected that bits are\n&gt; &gt; preserved.  For this reason, SOAP can&#39;t use PUT (at least how you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; expect it to be used).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At some point, I&#39;m going to propose a &quot;SET&quot; method that can be used\n&gt; &gt; in this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; POST could be used for such a thing, but it requires the \n&gt; pre-existance of a\n&gt; request URI.  Instead of suggesting a SET method, how about either:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Relaxing POST to allow the creation of resources, or\n&gt; 2) Issue an &quot;empty&quot; PUT to create the resource, then follow \n&gt; with a non-empty\n&gt; POST to set the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
