I would imagine that applicatio=\r\nns very\n&gt; concerned about security are going to be minting random-string UR=\r\nLs\n&gt; (sometimes even with a limited lifetime) anyway.  Think about the\n&gt; co=\r\nnfirmation message many web sites send when you first sign up, with some\n&gt; =\r\nrandom string of characters included that, if you try to invoke it a year\n&gt;=\r\n from now, will simply return a 404.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s perfectly reasonable for the=\r\n server application that *created* a URL to\n&gt; impute some sort of meaning t=\r\no the URL structure, and thus be tightly bound\n&gt; to it.

At the same time, a robust client =\r\nshould support relative URLs\n&gt; when the media type of the response containi=\r\nng them has well defined\n&gt; semantics for interpreting them (as HTML does, f=\r\nor example).\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
