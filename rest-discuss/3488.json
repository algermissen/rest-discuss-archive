For example, PUT-ing:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; will be retrieved using GET as:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;test/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know this issue has come up several times on this\n&gt; &gt; list, but it is interesting to see that one major vendor\n&gt; &gt; at least has interpreted the semantics of PUT in a data-centric\n&gt; &gt; way as opposed to a document-centric way.  I tend to agree\n&gt; &gt; with their approach as it makes PUT much more useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this is a document-vs-data thing.  I think that this is a\n&gt; semantics-vs-syntax thing.  Since &quot;&lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;test/&gt;&quot; are\n&gt; semantically equivalent, an xml parser *should* handle the document exactly\n&gt; the same way.\n&gt;\n&gt; And yes, I (imho) think this attitude makes PUT much more powerful without\n&gt; crippling it&#39;s functionality.  I think that any client application that\n&gt; would choke on receiving &quot;&lt;test/&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt;&quot; would indicate\n&gt; a badly designed client, not a badly designed server.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
