I haven&#39;t seen a cache that does it though.\n\n&gt; My reading of the spec is that a PUT must include the complete\n&gt; representation, although I&#39;ve always wondered whether people actually\n&gt; do this in practice.\n\nPUT requests always include the complete representation by definition\nbecause the message is always self-descriptive about its intent.  But\nthe server has latitude beyond that meaning.  Perhaps an example...\n\nPUT /lightbulb HTTP/1.0\nContent-Type: application/lightbulb+xml\n&lt;bulb&gt;\n   &lt;state&gt;off&lt;/state&gt;\n&lt;/bulb&gt;\n\nThat message requests that the lightbulb be turned off.  A subsequent\nGET might return;\n\n&lt;bulb&gt;\n   &lt;state&gt;off&lt;/state&gt;\n   &lt;temp&gt;150&lt;/temp&gt;\n&lt;/bulb&gt;\n\nThe point is that you can&#39;t interpret the initial PUT request as &quot;set\nstate=off and temp=0&quot;.  It just means &quot;state=off&quot;, and the server is\nfree to do what it wants with &quot;temp&quot;.  At least, that&#39;s how I\nunderstand it.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
