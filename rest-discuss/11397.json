Not sure how that helpls the specific case of removing from a collection, though.\n\nLINK leans towards creating header information, but why shouldn&#39;t the resource be free to create the link in whatever way it wants to?\n\nJan\n\n &lt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Methods/Link.html&gt;\n\n \nOn Tuesday, October 21, 2008, at 11:47PM, &quot;Bill de hOra&quot; &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On 16.10.2008, at 22:03, Bill de hOra wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  &gt; Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; I POST the URI itself (sans XML) to the collection and return a 200.\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; How do you remove it?\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Good question with no generic answer. The few occasions I did this,\n&gt;&gt; stuff was removed through some backend logic (i.e. not via the RESTful\n&gt;&gt; interface) or never removed at all.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s worth digging into. This is an area (along with partial updates) \n&gt;where I&#39;m prone to sympathizing with the RPC crowd*, as in, it tends to \n&gt;require a pattern or an idiom. On that basis you can argue that there is \n&gt;a capability than people need - the ability to relate resources. How to \n&gt;do this is not evident when I look at REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;* if REST can have a religion, then RPC can have a mob.
