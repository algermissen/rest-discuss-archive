I think now you got me, because if I \ndo, I&#39;m trolling because I don&#39;t accept what others tell me. If I don&#39;t, \nI&#39;m just a nut-case that lacks arguments to maintain a discussion, or  \nthat you just convinced me how low I am and have not the guts to admit it.\n\nHowever the true is, I&#39;m working 10 hours a day including week-ends, \npart of that work is even building a RESTfull infrastructure on our \nsystem. That, imagine that, has connectors that are not HTTP. I know \nthat is against your bible, but like the other said, &quot;it woks in \npractice, will it work in theory&quot;?\n\nI don&#39;t want to waste time in a flame war that we both know will lead \nnowhere. If I wanted a flame war, which I don&#39;t want, I&#39;ll have to say \nthat your position until now is basically &quot;I&#39;ve studied REST for years \nnow, you don&#39;t, so you have to accept what I tell you without question \nit&quot;. I think that makes you some sort of high-priest, perhaps?\n\nBut now, even worse, you assume not only the role of high-priest but \nalso the role of rest-discuss police, telling me what I can do and what \nI can&#39;t. More like a politic police, actually, cause you had the trouble \nto read all my posts in order to quote (out of context) some of them \nhere.. How&#39;s that for cherry-picking?\n\nGee, I hope you won&#39;t go to the entire net looking for my posts, you \neven may find some saying that VisualBasic was a good thing...\n\nIn this post again you interpret things I say in a wrong way. I even \nassume that&#39;s probably my fault because as you said English is not my \nmain language, actually I learned English after I learned Cobol. But \nthat don&#39;t give you the right to extrapolate from what I said to what \nyou say I&#39;ve said.\n\nWhen I question answers, and say &quot;why that and not this&quot;, is not \ncriticising, it&#39;s not trying to redefine, it&#39;s not trolling, it&#39;s the \nway I have to learn things, to try to understand things, instead of just \naccepting as a fact &quot;just because is like that&quot;. And I&#39;ve been learning \nthings this way, specially in IT, for a long time.\n\nAnd if sometimes I appear to be offensive, as I said in other post I \nsometimes use irony and imagery as figures of speech to emphasize some \npoint. Is not a uncommon thing to do be it in literature or on \nnewspapers or blogs or other media. There is nothing personal on that, I \nassure you...\n\nIf you want to have a proper discussion on the subjects you mention \nbelow it will be my pleasure to do so, why do I think you contradict \nyourself a lot, why I question your opinion that a text has to be taken \nliterally and should not be a subject of interpretation, and lot more of \nthings you say that for me are completely, how should I say it in \nEnglish, non-sense? And also, of course, why in some other points I \nagree with you and in others I changed my mind because you pointed me to \nright point, like other in this list.\n\nIf not, I don&#39;t really care, but let me assure you also that I&#39;m not \nintimidated by your name-calling, by your tone of superiority and \ndisdain, or by your fascist practice of trying to find in all my old \nposts something that can, somehow, incriminate me to the eyes of the \nlist participants.\n\n\nEric J. Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Ant�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; You put things in my mouth, intentionally or not, that I never said.\n&gt;&gt; And doing so, you contradict yourself several times and you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; turning this discussion in a serious of personal insults. That you\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want to discuss things I said is up to you, you don&#39;t have to\n&gt;&gt; answer them anyway.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Where have I contradicted myself?  What I&#39;m doing is pointing out to\n&gt; you that your attitude needs adjustment, unless your intention is to\n&gt; come across as a troll.  This is an observation, not an insult, since\n&gt; obviously English is your second language.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Bottom line on this thread, my point is that a REST Client does not\n&gt;&gt; have to be a HTTP Client. So a thread that start as &quot;Generic REST\n&gt;&gt; client&quot; should had been named &quot;Generic HTTP client for REST&quot;. What I\n&gt;&gt; did was to point that out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; But that isn&#39;t right, as I pointed out in response.  For example, curl\n&gt; is not a generic HTTP client, since if you enter an FTP URI it will\n&gt; work.  A generic REST client can&#39;t be limited to being a generic HTTP\n&gt; client, since some URIs in a REST system may very well use different\n&gt; protocols.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; I could comment some of your points - to which in some cases I agree\n&gt;&gt; as I said in the earlier post -  and in some cases clarify what I\n&gt;&gt; said or what you say I said (which is not the same), but it&#39;s visible\n&gt;&gt; that you&#39;re not interested in coming down from your high-horse and\n&gt;&gt; you just dismiss as &quot;trolling&quot; anything that doesn&#39;t fit your way of\n&gt;&gt; thinking.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, and this has been your response to my posts since you joined this\n&gt; list -- that I must have something wrong with me, because I attempt to\n&gt; correct your mistakes.  Your obstinance to responses from myself and\n&gt; others is hardly an example of me being on any sort of horse.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Note that you started your *first* response to a post of mine by\n&gt;&gt; saying\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been responding to your posts for months.  You get huffy with me\n&gt; every time I do, so I checked your posts in threads I didn&#39;t\n&gt; participate in, and found the same attitude towards those helping you\n&gt; that I myself experienced, off and on over the past several months.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; When I refer to REST in my post I was referring to the REST community,\n&gt;&gt; from which the members of this list are a subset, and as such I was\n&gt;&gt; referring the necessity of having a community-driven resource, such as\n&gt;&gt; a wiki or such, where the community could agree on those &quot;formal&quot;\n&gt;&gt; definitions (even if those definitions are just a copy&paste from\n&gt;&gt; Fielding dissertation excerpts), and could be used as reference by\n&gt;&gt; everybody, specially by new-comers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Or did you forget saying that?  REST always and only refers to the\n&gt; architectural style described by Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation.  Notice\n&gt; how you complain about the entire community on a regular basis?  Did you\n&gt; forget complaining that REST needs a wiki or something, despite such a\n&gt; wiki already existing? That response of yours from a little while back,\n&gt; plus your recurring complaint about responses steeped in references to\n&gt; said thesis, is why I prefaced my last response with a note about what\n&gt; this group&#39;s purpose is.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; However, regrettably, judging by several conversations on this list,\n&gt;&gt; it seems that the REST community likes to cultivate some sort of\n&gt;&gt; obscurantism at the level of concepts, and like to avoid all the\n&gt;&gt; practical questions of developing software based on the REST style.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; There you went again.  You didn&#39;t immediately understand REST, which\n&gt; must be a failure of the group, because we deliberately cultivate\n&gt; &quot;obscurantism&quot; instead of answering questions.  No, we assume you&#39;ve\n&gt; read the thesis, and searched the list archives for answers, before\n&gt; asking questions.  As I&#39;ve said before, REST is not easy to learn.\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t mean the answers you&#39;re given are deliberately meant to \n&gt; confuse you.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Eric, don&#39;t take it wrong but I read your post and sincerely I think\n&gt;&gt; &quot;what does this has to do with what?&quot; Take this for example:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In a RESTful system, once a user has completed their series of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; application interactions, a history of the steady-states is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; contained in the browser history.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; What browser (and what user)? We have a Restfull (almost)\n&gt;&gt; infrastructure that we use in order to put our different software\n&gt;&gt; modules communicating with each other, sometimes using HTTP, other JMS\n&gt;&gt; or IMAP...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; If you can&#39;t extrapolate &quot;browser&quot; into &quot;client&quot; then I don&#39;t know how\n&gt; to help you.  If one uses curl, then the history is right there in the\n&gt; shell history -- scroll up.  The nature of a REST application is that\n&gt; each request and response may be logged.  What client is used to run\n&gt; that REST application is simply not relevant.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; And the rest of your post is similar to this quote, and I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; understand what it has to do with &quot;application&quot; and &quot;application\n&gt;&gt; state&quot; in the realm of a RESTfull based system (not a HTTP based\n&gt;&gt; system).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, your failure to understand my post is obviously because I don&#39;t\n&gt; know what I&#39;m talking about, or am deliberately trying to confuse you.\n&gt; I really don&#39;t understand how you fail to see that your responses may\n&gt; be considered rude.  The particular client is irrelevant, and does not\n&gt; change the definition of &quot;REST application&quot; as &quot;what the user intends\n&gt; to accomplish,&quot; and it is also irrelevant whether that user is a person\n&gt; or a machine -- application means the same thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; There are things that we can extrapolate from HTTP to a more general\n&gt;&gt; level in order to fit other protocols, like we did with some HTTP\n&gt;&gt; headers that we use generically, but not concepts like &quot;browser\n&gt;&gt; history&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re using a generic interface, then the protocol doesn&#39;t matter,\n&gt; and it&#39;s simple to extrapolate &quot;browser history&quot; into &quot;a log of the\n&gt; requests made and the responses received&quot; regardless of client. Since\n&gt; your response came as fast as you could type it, pardon me for assuming\n&gt; that you didn&#39;t make any effort to understand what I wrote, first.\n&gt; That&#39;s exactly what trolls do, which is why I used that word.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you don&#39;t want to be accused of trolling, then please, take the time\n&gt; to read and re-read peoples&#39; responses until you do understand, instead\n&gt; of immediately finding fault and rushing to make rude posts in\n&gt; response.  Or, ask a question or two at a time, instead of a wholesale\n&gt; disassembly of an entire response for the purpose of pointing out its\n&gt; shortcomings as relates to your particular needs.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; So maybe I&#39;m contradicting myself regarding the conceptual/practical\n&gt;&gt; dichotomy I referred in other post, but concepts like &quot;application&quot;\n&gt;&gt; and &quot;application state&quot; have to be formally defined at the most\n&gt;&gt; abstract level as possible, so they can be applied on the ground.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; But they are formally defined, unless you don&#39;t consider a thesis which\n&gt; describes these terms as &quot;formal&quot;.  In your next reply to that thread,\n&gt; you seemed surprised to find that I was right, &quot;application&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;application state&quot; and &quot;transitional state&quot; are all defined in black\n&gt; and white in the thesis.  Believe it or not, these terms are a regular\n&gt; topic of discussion here.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, &quot;What does application state mean?&quot; is a FAQ here, because it\n&gt; is central to understanding REST, where &#39;S&#39; stands for &#39;State&#39;.  If\n&gt; Roy&#39;s thesis isn&#39;t clear enough, then search the archives of this list,\n&gt; or check the wiki, before complaining that terms like &quot;transitional\n&gt; state&quot; were just coined recently, for the purpose of confusing newbies.\n&gt; They&#39;re discussed all the time, that was just the first thread about it\n&gt; since you joined.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, it seemed you were more interested in criticizing my answer than\n&gt; understanding it, since you immediately responded with criticism.\n&gt; Which, after several occurences, some not involving me at all, led me to\n&gt; ask if you are a troll.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Now, if you read my previous posts on this thread, where did I tried\n&gt;&gt; to redefine REST, made snarky comments, criticizing answers,\n&gt;&gt; cherry-picking whatever?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Does this response jog your memory?  I could post plenty of examples of\n&gt; everything I have accused you of, including from threads I didn&#39;t\n&gt; participate in. I haven&#39;t flamed anybody anywhere for over a year, it&#39;s\n&gt; hardly something I do on a whim, or without reason.  If you don&#39;t like\n&gt; how you come across to people, then change the nature of your posts.\n&gt; People here are genuinely trying to help you understand REST, and your\n&gt; response is to continually criticize the help you&#39;re given, and whine\n&gt; about how the entire group is out to get you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe that&#39;s why many of your questions are ignored?  I&#39;m just\n&gt; suggesting that perhaps that&#39;s *your* problem, not everyone else&#39;s\n&gt; failing.  Because it seems like you&#39;re the one on a high horse.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
