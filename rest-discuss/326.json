If you want to claim this is a new\nprotocol then it is a one line protocol:\n\n\tonly process any given message-id once.\n\nAlso, in good implementations duplicate messages\nshould be very rare.  See RFC1047.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Go to http://www.google.com/ Type in Paul Constock. Hit Enter.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is a user interface convention.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you think that the web&#39;s fundamental addressing mechanism is user\n&gt; interface then the gap between us is too large to be bridged in a\n&gt; predictable amount of time.\n\nNo.  My point is that you can &quot;link&quot; to a post\nusing hidden fields.  So I don&#39;t see why this is\nso important.\n\n&gt; &gt; ... By that\n&gt; &gt; argument, is I urlencoded XML-RPC and passed it in\n&gt; &gt; the qu&#92;ery string, it would no longer be RPC.\n&gt;\n&gt; You would also need to use the appropriate HTTP methods for each task.\n&gt; (GET for queries, PUT for updates, etc.) But other then that, I can&#39;t\n&gt; think of anything theoretically wrong with double-encoding query strings\n&gt; as XML-RPC and then as URL encoding. It&#39;s just ugly as sin.\n\nSo how do you put the terrorist images in the\nquery string?  Remember you can&#39;t pass content\ntype.\n\nI think the only implementation of\nterrorist_or_not.com consistent with REST is:\n\n1. GET URL for terrorist1 image\n2. GET URL for terrorist2 image\n3. PUT terrorist1.gif\n4. PUT terrorist2.jpg\n5. GET /terrorist/check?1=url1&2=url2\n\nIn contrast, the RPC version represents only a\nsingle request and does not force the server into\ndeciding when it is ok to garbage collect the\nimages.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
