If it is a request, then the pusher is a\n&#39;client&#39;. If it is a response, then you are doing request/response outside a\nsingle TCP/IP connection - which is fine but I haven&#39;t seen anybody do it\nyet (you&#39;ll need correlation ids in messages, etc).\n\nPush is a really bad term. Trust me.\n\n"}}
