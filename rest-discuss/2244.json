My aim is to understand the claims that tunneling RPC\ntraffic through HTTP POST creates a security problem that doesn&#39;t\nalready exist with compliant uses of POST.  A POST body will\ncontain a representation of something that is loosely characterized\nas &#39;subordinate&#39; to the referenced resource, which will invoke\nsome processing of some kind.  That representation may be the\n*record* of some desired action, and so will be interpreted on\nthe server as the action.  The meaning of this exchange will\nnot be available to a firewall or other intermediary except at\nthe most general level.  And what it &quot;means&quot; there can be\nexpressed approximately as &quot;some side effect may occur, but\ndon&#39;t bet on it&quot;.\n\nAbove I&#39;ve described what I understand to be RESTful use of\nthe POST method.  Please tell me how that differs in the security\ndimension from the dreaded &#39;tunneled RPC&#39;.\n\nNote that I&#39;m interested only in the security dimension right\nnow.  I understand that tunneling GETs through POST diminishes\nthe capability of the layered system, and I suppose tunneling\nDELETE or PUT may diminish something as well.  But in none of these\ncases is security diminished.  At least I can&#39;t think of a \nreasonable admin policy toward POST that would result in such\na diminishment.\n\nThat&#39;s why, for the time being, I regard claims about diminished\nsecurity to be exaggerations based on overgeneralization.  What\nI need to see are some specific cases of firewall configuration\nand method abuse to better understand.\n\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s underspecified at all.  Why do you believe it\n&gt; is?\n\nHaving just read that part of the spec again, I don&#39;t, actually.  But\nthat pushes me to a different conclusion: that the semantics of POST\nare being misrepresented on this mail list to include careful craftings\nof remote procedure calls in which the instructions have &#39;representations&#39;\nthat pass the &#39;representational state&#39; test (which is a null test),\nand so appear to be &#39;state transfers&#39; but are not.\n\nI&#39;ll give an example\n\n\tRequest:\n\tPUT /some/number\n\t2\n\n\tResponse:\n\t201 Created\n\n\tRequest:\n\tGET /some/number\n\n\tResponse:\n\t200 OK\n\t2\n\n\tRequest:\n\tPOST /some/number\n\t&#39;square&#39;\n\n\tResponse:\n\t204 No Content\n\n\tRequest:\n\tGET /some/number\n\n\tResponse:\n\t200 OK\n\t4\n\nThis example achieves the squaring of 2 in a way that is quite\ndifferent from the more obvious interpretations of &quot;state\ntransfer&quot;.  Can we please discuss whether the above is &quot;RESTful&quot;\nand if not, what would it take to make it so?  I believe that\nby tweaking the example above, we can arrive at one which\nilluminates the distinction I see between rest-discuss and\nRFC 2616 on the intended semantics of POST.\n\n\nThe specification of POST in RFC 2616 relies on the term &#39;subordinate&#39;\nto characterize the relationship between the POST entity and the\nreferenced resource.  It then avoids comprehensive definition of\n&#39;subordinate&#39; in favor of an enumeration.  It leaves us to infer that\nthe &#39;subordinate&#39; relation is the &#39;part-&gt;composite&#39; relation, because\nall the enumerated examples are such, but I&#39;d like to hear others&#39;\ninterpretations on this.  \n\nThen there&#39;s the circumstantial stuff, like the fact that otherwise\nintelligent human beings typically stumble all over the meanings of\nthe HTTP methods (and it&#39;s all because of POST) on first encounter,\nthe fact that supplementary models of &quot;resource type&quot; have to be developed\nto delineate the possible POST behaviors, the appearance of the word\n&quot;intent&quot;\nto describe the fleshing out of application semantics for POST, which\nseems unnecessary for all of the other HTTP methods, and a\ncomment by someone who signs his emails with your signature to the\neffect that &quot;POST is the catch-all mutator method&quot;.\n\nWhat I think is happening here is that we&#39;re still feeling the\ngrowing pains of HTTP/REST as it tries to be more than a document\nmaintenance pattern and less than a &#39;protocol prostitute&#39; (sorry,\nthe alliteration made me do that!).\n\nThis is super-long, so thanks in advance to all who made it to the end!\n\nWalden\n\n \n\n"}}
