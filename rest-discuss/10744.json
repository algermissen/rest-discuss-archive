For instance an issue\ncannot\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; be reopened if it is=\r\nn&#39;t resolved or closed. Furthermore,\nlet&#39;s say I\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; have a resolved i=\r\nssue but I&#39;m conducting a PUT with state =3D\n&quot;Open&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; This is not a=\r\nllowed, unless I make my wrapper first reopen\nthe issue,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; then star=\r\nt progress, and then stop progress again. I might just\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; implement t=\r\nhis hack, but what I want to know is how I should\nexpress\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; these wo=\r\nrkflow constraints RESTfully if i want to..\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I figure one =\r\ncan use urls like: issues/open, issues/resolved\netc..

If I\nconduct a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; POST=\r\n to /resolved I would create a new issues.. and that would be\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; wron=\r\ng?
