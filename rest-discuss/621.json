In general, if the notification\n&gt; contains anything but a TRUE value, it&#39;s an update.  If the notification is used\n&gt; to push changed resources, including via deltas, then it is an update.\n\nI&#39;m trying to make a distinction here between the semantic content of\nthe message and the literal content. The semantic content is &quot;something\nchanged.&quot; The literal content is often &quot;oh, and by the way, you could do\na GET to fetch it but in order to reduce network load I&#39;ve inlined the\nvalue here for you. If you would rather ignore the inlined value, go\nahead and do the GET. It&#39;s all the same to me.&quot;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt;  3. the last point implies that the server must tell the client in the\n&gt; &gt; notification that it is &quot;pre-authorized&quot; for re-subscription.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems safe to assume that the sink is pre-authorized to resubscribe often\n&gt; enough to consider it the default.  \n\nSure, the default. But you&#39;re just reversing the question. Then the\npublisher must be able to tell the subscriber that it is NOT\npre-authorized.\n\n&gt; ... Plus it doesn&#39;t really cause damage to have\n&gt; a re-subscribe fail.  \n\nI strongly disagree. If I believe that I&#39;m subscribed to a stock ticker\nbut I&#39;m not really, heads will roll. Resubscription is important!\n\n&gt; ... So it is parsimonious to leave authorization to the usual\n&gt; HTTP means, i.e. by having the source return 401 (Unauthorized) when the need\n&gt; arises to deny a sub request.\n\nI don&#39;t follow. The NOTIFY message has the publisher as the requester\nand the client as the receiver. The response to the NOTIFY may have a\nheader saying: &quot;Please re-subscribe me.&quot; Now the server has no\nopportunity to report an error because the re-subscription &quot;request&quot; was\nin a &quot;response&quot;. That&#39;s why the server should pre-authorize.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
