I&#39;m losing track of the number of ways to run GNU/FOSS\n&gt; on Windows (used to just be cygwin), I only came across uwin today:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/uwin.html\n&gt;\n&gt; With Interix or uwin (or other), one can then install curl as a binary\n&gt; with apt-get or pkgsrc, or build it from source using pkgsrc, portage,\n&gt; or the raw source and gcc.  Stuff that doesn&#39;t build on Windows&#39; POSIX\n&gt; subsystem these days, is typically available as Win32 binaries anyway,\n&gt; for example GIMP, Scribus or Inkscape.  My C:&#92; prompt on XP is bash, it\n&gt; accepts either &#39;dir&#39; or &#39;ls&#39;...  I call it FAUXNIX.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\n"}}
