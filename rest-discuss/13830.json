If password, it is =\r\nobvious that a secret password is required. That is due to the general know=\r\nledge of users.\n\nAs I said before, if in a banking app, the server requests=\r\n the account id, I would understand. Well, that glossary, that knowledge is=\r\n the one that is required at a minimum, because if you need to send the act=\r\nual definition of what an account is, then it would be almost impossible to=\r\n construct a dynamic client.\n\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 12, =\r\n2009, at 6:21 PM, Felipe Ga=FAcho wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ok,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I amusi=\r\nng &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; as my media type when  \n&gt; &gt; I create=\r\n resources in the server.. it works, nice and easy...\n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming the typ=\r\ne is not good. There should be hypermedia telling you  \n&gt; which type to sen=\r\nd (e.g. a form).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The question is: how the client knows what p=\r\narameters it should  \n&gt; &gt; submit to the server to create a new resource ?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The allowed parameters should be in the hypermedia spec (that is: in  \n=\r\n&gt; prose). Just stating them in a from (as you do it with HTML) is not  \n&gt; e=\r\nnough, since the client implementation has to &#39;know&#39; the meaning.  \n&gt; That =\r\nmeans, the parameter must be known at implementation time and  \n&gt; that mean=\r\ns it must be in a spec.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; is it a &quot;previous knowledge&quot; ?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; In the sense of what I say above - yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the case of Atom=\r\nPub, there is a generic type used to create  \n&gt; &gt; resources.. it is always =\r\nthe same type navigating between the client  \n&gt; &gt; and the server..\n&gt; \n&gt; Whi=\r\nch type?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; but in case I want to use different types, how to inform=\r\n the client  \n&gt; &gt; about the form contents ?\n&gt; \n&gt; AtomPub provides the &lt;acce=\r\npt&gt; element for this purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * I am in this learning curve here=\r\n, so please understand and help if  \n&gt; &gt; I am just getting out of the curve=\r\n :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep reading and posting to verify your understanding. REST is  \n&gt;=\r\n actually very simple - it just takes so much time have that sudden  \n&gt; shi=\r\nft in your brain. The good thing is that you really notice it when  \n&gt; you =\r\nindeed make such a twist.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it helpful to think about how you wou=\r\nld implement a client for  \n&gt; Amazon. Think what the client would need to u=\r\nnderstand from the  \n&gt; hypertext received from Amazon and what that implies=\r\n for the media  \n&gt; types that would have to be defined to make Amazon non-h=\r\numan  \n&gt; consumable. And avoid  lotsof fixed URIs and semantic URIs (those =\r\nthat  \n&gt; lead to hardcoding in the client the URI construction process).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; Jan Algermissen\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; Bl=\r\nog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\n&gt; Home: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n&gt; =\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
