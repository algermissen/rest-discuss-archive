Hence the need for at least a SHOULD on the\n&gt; Location header.\n&gt;\n(btw &#39;Entangled&#39; is a great term).\n\nI like the &#39;collection/container&#39; based approach also, but was just pointing\nout a common alternative.\n\nI had a thought - your &#39;good container design&#39; comment about a) mentions\nthat a post in one causes a delete in the other. Does this imply that a\nresource that is a collection must/should be disjoint from all other\naddressable collections? Does this imply aliases are to be avoided?\nIf aliases or overlapping collections exist, and events are to be routed, an\nevent in one would/should cause an event in the other(s)? If something is\naddressable, it is subscribable. If aliases exist, multiple subscriptions\nvia the aliases and there should not be one &#39;preferred&#39; alias.\n\nAlso, regarding uri &#39;parameters&#39; (which I have not read up on, so correct\nany and all misconceptions) - if these are unique identifiers yet guaranteed\nto informationally subordinate to the non-parameterized uri, then you have\nwhat appears to be an overlapping collection - with the &#39;parent&#39; resource\nchanneling events for the &#39;sub-properties&#39;. The sub-properties may be\navailable for fine-grained subscriptions (mini-filters) and the main\nresource is avialable for catch-all subscriptions. A bit\nstream-of-unconciousness, but I hope that made sense.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
