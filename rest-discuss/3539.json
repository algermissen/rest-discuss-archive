And that the \n&gt; physical &quot;resource&quot; behind the covers is the same?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a name in REST-speak for that physical thing behind the \n&gt; covers that is the same?\n&gt; \n&gt; (Or am I still thinking incorrectly about this REST stuff?)\n\nI think I can answer the REST part of this: If you are the authority\nat example.com, and you assert/enforce that /topTenProducts/productB\nand /products/productB are two names for the same resource, then\nthat&#39;s exactly what you have: two names, one resource.\n\nSameness = identity = resource; that much is clear.\n\nWhat happens to a resource that appears (by virtue of being\nnamed) in multiple containers when a container is deleted\nis not so clear  But I don&#39;t think REST covers that either, at\nleast not yet.  (It might be fun and useful to model containment\nsemantics.)\n\nBut I can synthesize the following argument.  If DELETE on a\ncontainer is interpreted to mean &#39;deep delete&#39;, such that it implies\nDELETE on all (recursively) contained resources, then any\nresource contained will be zapped, regardless of whether it\nwas contained elsewhere as well.  This should be true in any\nsituation where a resource has multiple names, regardless of\nany containment semantics or absence of same.  For instance,\nif /a and /b denote the same resource, and &#39;DELETE /a&#39; happens,\nthen &#39;GET /b&#39; should result in &#39;not found&#39;.\n\nThat&#39;s my understanding.  Could somebody please check that\nand correct me where/if I&#39;ve gone astray?\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
