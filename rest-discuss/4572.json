In the examples\n&gt; people have given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation\n&gt; will result in a resource being created (and furthermore, that this\n&gt; resource will have a particular relationship to the POSTed\n&gt; representation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees here.  I&#39;ve found it\n&gt; helpful to focus on one of the primary objectives of the uniform\n&gt; interface; substitutability, i.e. the ability to substitute one service\n&gt; implementing POST with another service implementing POST.\n&gt; Query-via-POST fails this test because the expectation about the query\n&gt; results being returned cannot be provided by other services.  For\n&gt; example, if one swapped in a resource which spat out the input document\n&gt; to a printer, then clearly it wouldn&#39;t meet the expectation of\n&gt; performing a query.\n\nThanks for taking the time to explain this.\nThat makes much more sense to me, particulary the\nsubstitutability test, which I may start abbreviating\ns14y :)\n\n&gt;&gt;The second example is the real reason for the\n&gt;&gt;why this nags at me so much, in the Atom Publishing \n&gt;&gt;Protocol we are combining operations into idioms,\n&gt;&gt;the most prevalent one being that of a collection[3]:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; POST to a Collection resource to create a new subordinate resource\n&gt;&gt;   (Returns a 201 and the URI of newly created resource returned via \n&gt;&gt;   Location: header)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But is a 201 *expected*?  What if 200 was returned?  Would an Atom\n&gt; client be able to proceed?\n\nHrmm. A 201 is expected since a new resource is expected to be\ncreated, but that probably wouldn&#39;t stop a client as it could \nproceed and do a GET on the Collection resouce which should \ncontain the URI of the newly created resource.\n\nThis does give me some ideas on clarifying that section\nin the Atom Publishing Protocol[1].
