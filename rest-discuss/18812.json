When this representation is taken out of its hab=\r\nitat,\nwhat is it/where did it come from/how can I get a fresh copy?  \n\n&gt;\tTh=\r\nis is (at best) annoying for a user-agent which has to either (i) understan=\r\nd the completeness of the member entry in the feed - for which I see no mec=\r\nhanism to determine, or \n\nremember that the collection resource is not the =\r\nmember resource.  So while a feed informs you of its members, it does not g=\r\nuarantee that the entries are complete.  That is REST for you - no guarante=\r\nes that the representation is the resource.  And anyway, you haven&#39;t done a=\r\n GET on the Member resource, just the Collection, so any Allow header you h=\r\nave received to date is about the Collection resource. \n\n&gt; (ii) must always=\r\n execute a GET, PUT cycle to make a change.  If a GET is required anyway, t=\r\nhere are other standard mechanisms to inform the user-agent of the permitte=\r\nd methods (e.g. &#39;Allow&#39; header).\nWell of course you would want to do a GET =\r\nbefore doing a PUT, unless you don&#39;t care what the resource says.  You have=\r\n a point with Allow, I think.  I think you are arguing that a hypermedia fo=\r\nrmat definition should associate method,rel,type &quot;coordinates&quot;.  Am I wrong=\r\n?\n\nCheers,\nPeter\n"}}
