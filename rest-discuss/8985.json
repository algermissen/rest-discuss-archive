One obvious follow on interpretation is that because the TAG\n&gt; has said little agin WS-Transfer, the W3C may have nothing against\n&gt; WS-Transfer, and other follow-on specs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I was hoping for something from the customer or other non-vendor\n&gt; sides to bring back to the TAG and others, but that didn&#39;t happen.  And I\n&gt; remain surprised by that.\n\n\nwell, I see you are still listed as part of the TAG, so may be in a\nposition of influence.\n\nI will take Stuart Williams aside the next time I see him at the\ncoffee machine and express my disappointment on the process. I have\nalready expressed some deep unhappiness about the way that WS-A got to\n1.0 without any tests, which is the complete anathema of develoment\nfrom a test centric viewpoint (if your standard has no tests, how do\nyou assess compliance?), but left with the impression that the TAG\nviews testing as an implementation detail, not a better way to\ndescribe specifications: a formal description you can code against.\n\n-steve\n\n(off to get that coffee now)\n\n"}}
