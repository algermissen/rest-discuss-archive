As authentication cookies are actually used\n&gt; on the Web today, they&#39;re evil because they do attempt to allow a  \n&gt; single\n&gt; URL to identify multiple resources.\n&gt;\nI suspect you&#39;re primarily concerned about using a session ID cookie  \nto lookup session state on the server, not using cookies for  \nauthentication. Usually, the first thing that people put into that  \nsession state is some data that identifies who the user is. In this  \ncase, the session ID cookie is a random number. With this approach,  \nif you want to accept requests from the same user on multiple servers  \nwithout making them log in again on each one, you need to figure out  \nhow to share the session state between servers.\n\nThe way I am planning to use a session ID cookies is to encrypt user  \ncredentials into the ID. This way I don&#39;t have to share session  \nstate, but I do have to share the passwords used to encrypt the  \ncredentials (because I want to change the passwords every 30 minutes  \nso the &quot;authentication sessions&quot; will expire). If I were to use HTTP  \ndigest authentication instead, I wouldn&#39;t need to share those  \npasswords. I wouldn&#39;t need to share anything except the user&#39;s  \ncredentials, which will be in the database and shared anyway.\n\nSo as I see it, HTTP authentication is still the most scalable  \napproach, but it has other issues that we&#39;ve talked about before. I  \nthink cookies can be used in a fairly RESTful manner for  \nauthentication if you actually encrypt user credentials into the  \ncookies. If you make them a random number used to lookup the user in  \nsession state on the server, and that&#39;s the ONLY thing you put in the  \nsession, then I suppose that could be fairly RESTful too, but you  \nwould still likely need to share the sessions between servers, which  \nis more troublesome to scalability than sharing passwords.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
