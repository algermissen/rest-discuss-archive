Although\nI realize that URIs are opaque, I&#39;m trying to have them look reasonable\nshould people see them - the problem I&#39;m having is how to differentiate\nbetween &quot;give me a representation of the container&quot;, and &quot;give me a\nrepresenation of everything inside the container&quot;, without having the\nURIs seem very verbose.\n\nImagine a service that exposes a set of containers. Each container which\nheld interesting data, and one or more subcontainers. Each subcontainer\nalso held some interestesting data. I want to be able to support the\nfollowing use cases\no Get the list of containers in the service (UC1)\no Get the data in a container (UC2)\no Get a list of the subcontainers in a container (UC3)\no Get the data in a subcontainer (UC4)\n\nOne approach I&#39;ve been consider is to model &quot;Get the list of containers\nin the service&quot; as:\n  UC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/containers\nThis would return a list of container URIs. These URIs could then be\nused to &quot;Get the data in a container&quot;, like this:\n  UC2: GET  http://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234\nThis would return the data in the container. One of the data items would\nbe a URI to &quot;Get the list of subcontainers in a container&quot;, like this:\n  UC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234/subcontainers\nThis would return a list of subcontainer URIs. These URIs could then be\nused to &quot;Get the data in a subcontainer&quot;, like this:\n  UC4: GET\nhttp://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234/subcontainers/5678\n\nMy concern is that this approach gets pretty verbose. Given that at each\nlevel there is only one class of sub-item, I have considered making the\ncontainers & subcontainers implicit. This results in a shorter set of\nURLs than the above four, like this:\n  UC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/\n  UC2: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234\n  UC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/\n  UC4: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/5678\n\nMy concern is that the difference between the GETs for UC2 and UC3 seem\nso trivial to be incorrect/confusing/plain wrong.\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any suggestions, comments, required reading or references\nfrom the group. Thanks in advance.\n\n--Peter\n\n\n"}}
