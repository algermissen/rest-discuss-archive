)?\n\n   I think that I so far understood that fragment identifiers are not part of the\n   URI (don&#39;t affect what the URI identifies) and so I wonder if it would be better\n   to move the range part in a fragment:\n\n   http:/foo.bar/archive/index#a-c\n   http:/foo.bar/archive/index#d-f\n\n   \nor if\n\nb) the above is actually the wrong wy to think and if it would be better to view all\n   the different chunks of the index as concepts themselves and to create resources\n   for them:\n\n   http:/foo.bar/archive/index\n\n   might then return something like\n\n   &lt;index&gt;\n     &lt;subindex range=&quot;a-c&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/a-c&quot; /&gt;\n     &lt;subindex range=&quot;d-f&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/d-f&quot; /&gt;\n     ...\n   &lt;/index&gt;\n\n   which would allow the server to control the size of the chunks dynamically.\n   If the index is quite small it might &#39;choose&#39; to return\n\n   &lt;index&gt;\n     &lt;subindex range=&quot;a-m&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/a-m&quot; /&gt;\n     &lt;subindex range=&quot;n-z&quot; href=&quot;http:/foo.bar/archive/index/n-z&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;/index&gt;\n\n   instead.\n\n\n   And it might also choose to return further subindexes (e.g. aa-am)\n   thus varying the number of drill-down levels depending on the index size.\n\n\n\nI haven&#39;t yet understood the REST principles enough to make a decision between\na) and b) above (or yet something completely different?) and I would be very\nthankful for help with this.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n   \n-- \nJan Algermissen\nConsultant & Programmer\n\nTel:   ++49 (0)40 89 700 511\n       ++49 (0)177 283 1440\nFax:   ++49 (0)40 89 700 841 \nEmail: algermissen@...\nWeb:   http://www.topicmapping.com\n\n"}}
