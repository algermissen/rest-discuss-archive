Most of the time it just ends up being the\nsame as =\r\na flat file store, but the flexibility is there when you need it\nbecause it=\r\n allows the server to evolve independent of the clients.\n\nWe don&#39;t need to =\r\nrequire that the server do something sensible, since\nwhatever it does shoul=\r\nd be in the best interests of the resource.\n\nThis is also why the Web does =\r\nnot support write-back caching.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
