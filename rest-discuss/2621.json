Of course an operation \nwill return different responses. When you PUT to an object that doesn&#39;t \nexist you get Created. When you PUT again, you don&#39;t. Idempotency is \nabout *side-effects* which I take to mean anything outside of the \nrequest/response pair.\n\n &gt;...\n&gt; Now, let&#39;s move on to PUT.  When PUT is used, and the resource did not\n&gt; exist, then a 201 (Created) response is expected.  Subsequent PUTs to the\n&gt; same resource return 200 (OK) responses.  This is very common practice and I\n&gt; have never heard a single person say this is not idempotent.\n\nI strongly feel your analysis is correct. I never saw the debate about \ntwo deletes as having anything to do with idempotence. It is merely a \nquestion of whether deleting a thing twice is an error or a normal \naction. In most file systems I&#39;m familiar with it is an error. That&#39;s \nbecause objects have identity in a file system and trying to delete a \nnon-existent object is a problem.\n\nIn SQL, a DELETE that effects nothing is not a problem because &quot;rows&quot; do \nnot have identity (except in a particular application domain where you \nchoose some column or set of columsn to use as the identifier).\n\nBut this has nothing to do with idempotency.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
