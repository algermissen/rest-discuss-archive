The \nreservation?  No.  It doesn&#39;t go away as its a record of the purchase. \nThe transactional-state of the reservation?  No, because really it is \njust a representation of the &quot;fulfilled&quot; or &quot;unfulfilled&quot; state.\n\nYou could say the the transaction resource itself is transient as it was \nonly used by the client to fulfill a greater task:  both an airline and \nhotel reservation.  But, what it turns into is a record of the entire \ntransaction with the Travel Agent.  For example, what if a law \nenforcement agency was investigating a crime.  They would follow the links:\n\nticket -&gt; reservation\nreservation -&gt; transaction\ntransaction -&gt; transaction-participants\ntransaction-participants -&gt; hotel reservation\nhotel-reservation -&gt; room\nroom -&gt; arrest.\n\n\n\nSubbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Of course. But I don&#39;t think &quot;transaction resources&quot; that Bill is\n&gt; describing are similar to credit card authorizations or purchase\n&gt; orders. The example that Bill outlined involves transient per client\n&gt; state. Marking such state as permanent resources is certainly\n&gt; possible, but towards what end? To prove that such things can be done\n&gt; RESTfully?\n&gt; \n&gt; Subbu\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 2, 2009, at 10:58 PM, Bediako George wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Thanks for the reply Subbu,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Would it not be the case that most data created by clients would for\n&gt;  &gt; the most part be &quot;per-client&quot; in nature?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; For instance if, for the first time ever, I buy a book on Amazon,\n&gt;  &gt; there are many resources that will be created because of that\n&gt;  &gt; transaction. In your opinion, will the order, or the credit card\n&gt;  &gt; authorization, or even my mailing address be considered &quot;per-client&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; state?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; On Fri, Oct 2, 2009 at 3:46 PM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:subbu%40subbu.org&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; On Oct 2, 2009, at 3:40 PM, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Yeah, somebody will have to explain to me why (or if) the Reservation\n&gt;  &gt; example I gave breaks the stateless constraint of REST. Where I think\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Well - under the disguise of a &quot;transaction&quot;, the server is\n&gt;  &gt; maintaining per-client state. In stead of answering your question\n&gt;  &gt; directly, let me ask you whether have you examined the scalability\n&gt;  &gt; characteristics of your proposed design.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It may be worthwhile to start from basics, apply each constraint one\n&gt;  &gt; by one, and whether your approach benefits. The discussion around\n&gt;  &gt; the kind of resources needed, media types, link rels, link headers\n&gt;  &gt; vs link elements in some XML format are implementation details. So\n&gt;  &gt; far, this post does not make a case of why an transactional\n&gt;  &gt; application should be built the way you propose.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Here is a minor point. There is no such thing as a &quot;sub-resource&quot;.\n&gt;  &gt; That term may be part of the mental model of some developers, but it\n&gt;  &gt; has no consequence to the protocol.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Subbu\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; Bediako George\n&gt;  &gt; Partner - Lucid Technics, LLC\n&gt;  &gt; Think Clearly, Think Lucid\n&gt;  &gt; www.lucidtechnics.com\n&gt;  &gt; (p) 202.683.7486 (f) 703.563.6279\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
