Linked Data, for me, is just interlinked structur=\r\ned data and, as\nthat, a great match to RESTful systems.\n\nI think most of th=\r\ne &quot;debate/mismatch/battle/whatever between REST and Linked\nData&quot; stems from=\r\n the AI-heavy history of the Semantic Web efforts. So\ndevelopers are often =\r\nafraid to use it/learn it - even though heaps of them\nare using those techn=\r\nologies without even knowing it (think Facebook&#39;s Open\nGraph annotations). =\r\nI usually use the term Semaphobia to describe this fear\n:-)\n\n\n--\nMarkus Lan=\r\nthaler\n@markuslanthaler\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-\n&gt; discuss@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Mi=\r\nke Kelly\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2012 6:11 PM\n&gt; To: Jorn Wildt\n&gt; Cc: res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST vs. Linked Dat=\r\na\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll have a stab at it..\n&gt; \n&gt; Linked Data is=A0concerned=A0with usin=\r\ng hypertext to construct an\n&gt; intelligible=A0graph from the web that is pub=\r\nlicly available and can be\n&gt; analysed/queried.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is concerned with =\r\nusing hypertext to expose applications so that\n&gt; their evolution can be man=\r\naged efficiently over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, they use hypertext as a means t=\r\no different ends. REST is\n&gt; about directing the flow of the web&#39;s applicati=\r\nons, LD is about\n&gt; establishing a structure to the web&#39;s data.\n&gt; \n&gt; One imp=\r\nortant LD-related technology is RDF, although it&#39;s not the only\n&gt; way to do=\r\n LD it does seem to have unearthed some of the fundamental\n&gt; differences be=\r\ntween LD and REST, so I&#39;ll share my perspective on that:\n&gt; \n&gt; RDF, in the q=\r\nuest for web-intelligibility, does not seem to cope very\n&gt; well with the am=\r\nbiguous and messy reality of The Web. This has led to\n&gt; a lot of controvers=\r\ny and demands from the RDF community for solutions\n&gt; to problems that appar=\r\nently don&#39;t exist for REST or anyone else\n&gt; outside of &#39;RDF land&#39; - a good =\r\nexample of a this is range-14. This has\n&gt; produced lots of long-winded and =\r\nconfused philosophical debate, but\n&gt; one of my favourite insights is a post=\r\n from 2002 by Roy:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Jul=\r\n/0090.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Apr 3, 2012 at 9:29 AM, Jorn Wi=\r\nldt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It seems like there is an o=\r\nngoing debate/mismatch/battle/whatever\n&gt; between REST and Linked Data (if I=\r\n am interpreting various Tweets\n&gt; correct).
