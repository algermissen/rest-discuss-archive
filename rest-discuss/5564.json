I have XML-RPC, JSON and SOAP experience but want to give REST \na shot...\n\nI have 2 burning questions....\n\n1. Is it considered bad taste to use parameters (i.e. ?id=1) within the \nURL? From what I have read it is but everyone seems to be doing it.\n2. What is considered the standard practice for user authentication? As \nI understand it Sessions are supposed to be a thing of the past, but how \nwould I work around that? Standard HTTP authentication?\n\nThanks in advance!\nChristian\n\n\n\n"}}
