The problem is that I can&#39;t say\n&#39;REST requires media types to be registered&#39; because both Internet\nmedia types and the registry controlled by IANA are a specific\narchitecture&#39;s instance of the style -- they could just as well be\nreplaced by some other mechanism for metadata description.\n&quot;\n\nHinting at Waka there at the last...  When we&#39;re talking about making a\nsystem available on the public Internet using the HTTP protocol, which\nis most of the time, we *can* say &quot;REST requires media types to be\nregistered by IANA.&quot;\n\n&quot;\nThe broader question is what does it take to create an *evolving*\nset of standard data types? Obviously, I can&#39;t say that all data\ntypes have to be *the* standard before they are used in a REST-based\narchitecture.\n&quot;\n\nI keep repeating this all the time.  New ubiquitous types are possible,\nbut 999 out of 1,000 custom media types have absolutely zero chance of\nthis, in which case, wouldn&#39;t the system be better off had it been\ndesigned using a ubiquitous media type, even if a tiny bit less\nefficient?\n\n&quot;\nAt the same time, I do require enough standardization to allow the data\nformat sent to be understood as such by the recipient. Hence, both\nsender and recipient agree to a common registration authority (the\nstandard) for associating media types with data format descriptions.\n&quot;\n\nWhen we&#39;re talking about making a system available on the public\nInternet using the HTTP protocol, which is most of the time, we *do*\nrequire ubiquitous media types, because recipient = world-at-large.\nIf recipient = partner-company-only, then what do we care about the\nserendipitous re-use or anarchic scalability brought about by using\nubiquitous media types?\n\n&quot;\nThe degree to which the format chosen is a commonly accepted standard\nis less important than making sure that the sender and recipient agree\nto the same thing, and that&#39;s all I meant by an evolving set of\nstandard data types.\n&quot;\n\nWhat is the purpose of your REST API?  If it&#39;s to expose a distributed\ninterface to the world-at-large, instead of only to those governed by\nsome contractual agreement, then you need to choose a media type your\nrecipients have at least heard of before, if not implemented.\n\n&quot;\nSure, it is easier to deploy the use of a commonly understood data\nformat. However, it is also more efficient to use a format that is more\nspecifically intended for a given application.\n&quot;\n\nMore efficient, but less RESTful seems to be Roy&#39;s point in this post.\nI&#39;ve noted before that Roy has said elsewhere that there are no degrees\nof REST, so I don&#39;t understand what he means by &quot;increasing\nRESTfulness.&quot;  Gray area, sure.\n\n&quot;\nWhere those two trade-offs intersect is often dependent on the\napplication. REST does not demand that everyone agree on a single\nformat for the exchange of data -- only that the participants in the\ncommunication agree. Beyond that, designers need to apply their\nown common sense and choose/create the best formats for the job.\n&quot;\n\nWhen we&#39;re talking about making a system available on the public\nInternet using the HTTP protocol, which is most of the time, then\n&quot;participants in the communication&quot; includes intermediaries, and no\nintermediary can agree to something it&#39;s never heard of.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
