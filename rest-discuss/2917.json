That&#39;s news to me. Ever since Mark and Paul started promoting this\nthing\n&gt; it&#39;s always been presented as a reason for not doing XML-RPC and SOAP.\nUntil\n&gt; you manage to convince others to stop spinning it that way (assuming\nyou&#39;re\n&gt; not) you gotta live with it.\nWell, I think MarkB and PaulP have spent a bunch of time and effort on\neducating and steering web service standards toward a pattern of use that\nfollows the principals that many people feel made the Web successful. For\nexample, kicking off discussion of using GET in conjunction with WSDL, etc.\nSo from what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s about how to use SOAP /better/, not about a\nreplacement.\n\n&gt; Sorry, I didn&#39;t make it so.\nNo need to apologize, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong.\n\n\n"}}
