Analyzing the URL moves\n&gt; away from treating hypermedia as the engine of application\n&gt; state.  That said, it appears that opacity isn&#39;t so much a\n&gt; principle of REST as it&#39;s an original principle of the web that\n&gt; Fielding didn&#39;t really care to integrate so much.\n\nNo, it is just that people are different from machines,\nservers are different from clients, and TimBL used the word\n&quot;Axiom&quot; to mean architectural constraint.  In order to understand\nTimBL&#39;s design notes, you have to know about the context in which\nhe is writing a response.  In this case, various thoughts were\nrecorded as the &quot;Opacity Axiom&quot; in response to a discussion about\nclient behavior and the perceived need for URNs.  It has long\nsince been taken out of context and abused in various ways.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that TimBL&#39;s design note was written two\nyears after Henrik and I worked out the important bits of what\nwould become the HTTP object model, later re-named REST to get\naway from OOM terms, about 18 months after we had similar\ndiscussions at MIT with TimBL and the rest of the W3C team, and\nmore than a year after HTTP/1.0 was finished and HTTP/1.1 proposed.\nSo, saying it was something that I &quot;didn&#39;t really care to\nintegrate so much&quot; is missing the mark by quite a bit -- he is\ntrying to describe our model to people who did not understand it.\n\nThe opacity principle, as actually used on the Web, refers only\nto the machine interpretation of request processing as being\ndependent on control data (e.g., hypertext anchors and message\nfield names) rather than on metadata appearing within the URI.\nIt is the same reason why we distinguish media types from data\nformats -- the fact that a string of bytes looks like angle tags\ndoesn&#39;t mean we want to process it as HTML.  Ignoring any\nsemantically significant data in a URI allows operations on a\nresource to be orthogonal to identification of the resource.\n\nREST does include the opacity axiom in the original sense of\nthat phrase.  I did not use it by name in REST because it isn&#39;t\na principle at all -- opacity is just a name TimBL used for the\nset of constraints around URI processing by clients (a byproduct\nof the constraints that you will find in REST).  The principle\ninvolved is orthogonal design.\n\n&quot;Opacity of URI&quot; only applies to clients and, even then, only to\nthose parts of the URI that are not defined by relevant standards.\nOrigin servers, for example, have the choice of interpreting a\nURI as being opaque or as a structure that defines how the server\nmaps the URI to a representation of the resource.  Cool URIs will\noften make a transition from being originally interpreted as\nstructure by the server and then later treated as an opaque\nstring (perhaps because the server implementation has changed\nand the owner wants the old URI to persist).  The server can make\nthat transition because clients are required to act like they\nare ignorant of the server-private structure.\n\nClients are allowed to treat a URI as being structured\nif that structure is defined by standard (e.g., scheme and\nauthority in &quot;http&quot;) or if the server tells the client how its\nURI is structured.  For example, both GET-based FORM actions and\nserver-side image map processing compose the URI from a\nserver-provided base and a user-supplied suffix constructed\naccording to an algorithm defined by a standard media type.\n\nNote, however, that some people have taken the mere title of\n&quot;opacity&quot; and assumed that it meant URIs should not have\nmeaningful construction at all.  TimBL&#39;s axiom doesn&#39;t say\nthat and neither does REST.\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
