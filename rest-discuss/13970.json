What return code would teh server use and does it make\nsense to send the order rejection document as the body of the  \n(error-)response?\n\nExample:\n\n\n-&gt;\nPOST /order=processor\nContent-Type: application/procurement-order\n\n&lt;the order XML goes here&gt;\n\n409 Confilct\nContent-Type: application/procurement-orderrejection\n\n&lt;xml of order rejection document goes here, maybe\ntelling the client how to fix the problem (e.g.\nsuggesting similar goods that are in stock)&gt;\n\n\nDoes that make sense? And if not - how else to do it?\n\nHmm, an alternative would be to create an order request resource and\nnot just an order resource and make the rejection part of the\nrepresentation of the order request:\n\nPOST /order-processor\nContent-Type: application/procurement-order\n\n201 Created\nLocation /order-processor/order-requests\nContent-Type: application/order-request\n\n&lt;XML representing the state of the order-request, which at the moment is\n&#39;rejected&#39;&gt;\n\n\nA client could then PUT/PATCH the order to fix the problem according to\nsuggestions made in the order-request response.\n\n\nDoes that sound better?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
