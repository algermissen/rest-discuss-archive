This is\nghost of your own creation haunting your perception of this debate.  I have\nbeen very explicit that, in the general case, hypertext indexes (lists,\nnavigational structures, etc. --- the namespace is the query space\nregardless) are desirable wherever they are possible.\n\n&gt; If you have a collection of data on the\n&gt; web that you want people to treat as a true collection then you should\n&gt; provide an index to it.\n\nSo:  drill down on what you mean, specifically, by index.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
