Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=112610298\r\n\r\nI was talking with a colleague this morning and evangelizing REST to\nhim.  I was telling him that one of the disavantages of SOAP is that the\nidentity of a target resource is hidden within the SOAP body, as opposed\nto being clearly shown in the URL [although this is not a requirement of\nSOAP it is common practice of vendors].  \n\nMy colleague responded saying that many (if not most) Web applications\ntoday use this paradigm of funneling all requests though a single URL. \nFor example, with CGI applications there is only one URL.  The CGI code\ndelegates the request to the appropriate application.  Likewise, Cold\nFusion applications all funnel to the same URL.  He said, &quot;go to amazon,\nyou will see that all URLs funnel through obidos&quot; (I checked, he&#39;s\ncorrect).  \n\nHe stipulated that the majority of the Web is non-RESTful.  He also\nargued that if the REST model does not support this single-URL paradigm\nthen it is not in tune with the &quot;real Web&quot; and therefore REST is merely\na figment of Roy Fielding&#39;s imagination.\n\nThree (very naive) questions:\n\n1. Are his statements about CGI and Cold Fusion correct?\n\n2. Is it true that the majority of the Web is non-RESTful?\n\n3. Should we (the REST evangelists) be arguing against CGI, Cold Fusion,\nas well as SOAP?\n\n/Roger\n\n\n"}}
