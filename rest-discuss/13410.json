We admitted from the\n&gt;&gt; beginning that what we had was old, raw, and unfinished.  Our goal is to\n&gt;&gt; define RESTful middleware,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am still wondering what it is you think needs to be defined as part of \n&gt; your effort?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;RESTful middleware&quot; is a contradiction in itself; if you&#39;d build a \n&gt; system using Web architecture you simple need no middleware because it \n&gt; is already globally deployed in the form of TCP/IP, DNS, Intermediaries...\n&gt; \n\nThe only way I can answer this is that middleware isn&#39;t just about \nprotocols.  Middleware is also about services (think Amazon S3 or SQS \nand even a search engine is a middleware service).\n\n(Middleware is also about frameworks (think Wicket, Struts, \nObject-Relationa-Mappin (Hibernate, JPA)), but that isn&#39;t important in \nthis discussion).\n\n&gt; Or would you say that middleware is needed when you perform a shopping \n&gt; session at Amazon?\n&gt; \n\nNo, but it may be needed by back-end systems to coordinate order \nfulfillment.\n\n&gt; To repeat the question (so it does not get lost): What is it you think \n&gt; is missing in order to apply REST to enterprise IT (and therefore should \n&gt; be defined as part of your effort)?\n&gt; \n\nThe answer is, I&#39;m not sure yet, but I have a few ideas.  This is what I \nwant REST-* to discover.  Specifically, I&#39;m on the fence on whether a \ncompensation service or a messaging service is truly RESTful or not. \nFor workflow/bpm though, I think REST (specifically HATEOAS) can have \n*HUGE* benefits (I&#39;ll be posting some of my thoughts and initial specs \nnext week).\n\nBUT...\n\nFor those that don&#39;t fit in a RESTful architecture (i.e. I think we all \nagree a Tranaction Manager is one of those that doesn&#39;t) can these \nservices benefit from a RESTful interface?  This is a question I also \nwant to answer.\n\nREST-*.org will not be an academic exercise though.  It will be defining \nmiddleware service specifications that are meant to be used to solve \nproblems.  The designs will not be perfect or fully RESTful at first, we \nwill need to iterate.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
