My idea is to create a resource\n&gt; like /newEvent. Now the client sends a GET request to this method and\n&gt; the server answers only when there is a new event. As long as there are\n&gt; no new events the connection stays open and the client waits until it\n&gt; gets a response or is terminated (timeouts are configured as needed).\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t decide if this is RESTful and doesn&#39;t violate HTTPs GET\n&gt; semantics. RFC 2616 says the server can reply to a GET request by doing\n&gt; some processing operation first. But I don&#39;t think this was meant in a\n&gt; way that it waits just indefinitely and sends the response at some\n&gt; random point in time. But I&#39;m not quite sure about that.\n&gt;\n&gt; :\n&gt;\n&gt; Any comments on the RESTfulness of the first idea? Any better ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere&#39;s an old thread I started on this very subject back in 2002:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3052\n\nIt was at the exact time Roy joined the list, but he didn&#39;t answer \nhimself.  =0(\n\n\nCheers!\n\nDuncan Cragg\n\n\n"}}
