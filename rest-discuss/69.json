Also, is fetching mail\n&gt; the same as addressing a resource? It sounds like &quot;RPC thinking&quot;.\nOuch.\n\n&gt; You\n&gt; have a single end-point and you send it messages. Web-thinking is that\n&gt; every resource (i.e. email message!) represents an endpoint and you send\n&gt; *them* HTTP messages. That&#39;s why I still don&#39;t think that &quot;mailto:&quot; is\n&gt; particularly REST-y. Arguably a better name is &quot;mailbox:&quot; and then\n&gt; you&#39;re addressing the mailbox but it is an incredibly course-grained\n&gt; object.\nThat&#39;s what I was getting at. Since e-mail doesn&#39;t have a single protocol\nfor all operations (SMTP to post, IMAP or POP to get), I thought maybe a\nuser-agent could infer &#39;mailto&#39; meant &#39;try imap or pop if doing a get&#39;.\nThe mailto uri spec might not provide identifiers for tasty sub-resources -\nlike folders and messages within those folders - but we could pretend it\ndid.\n\nFollowing the &#39;mailbox:&#39; example, I&#39;d love to see\nGET mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/\nGET\nmailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/3C48DE11.222C668A@...\nDELETE\nmailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/3C48DE11.222C668A@...\nPOST GET mailbox://hotmail.com/asynch_messaging/INBOX/\n(this is where a MOVE might be handy)\n\nHmm... I&#39;m not asking for a new wire protocol, but a client library that had\nsimilar abilities as an HTTP client library, but used smtp/pop to do the\nresource manipulation.\n\nYou know, maybe i&#39;ll write a servlet that proxies http requests over a set\nof resources that mailbox servers this way...\n\n&gt; You would hardly ever do a GET, DELETE or PUT.\nWhy not?\n\n&gt; That means it is\n&gt; like a SOAP endpoint that you can only do POST on. So once again it is\n&gt; very RPC-like.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n"}}
