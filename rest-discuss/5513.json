AFAIK, Here&#39;s one: Paul Jame&#39;s Tonic\nFram=\r\nework &lt;http://tonic.sourceforge.net&gt;. Ready for use, but still in\ndev stage=\r\n. It runs in PHP4.\n\nYou might be aware also, people in microformats are now=\r\n trying to\nrestify Rails framework. Here&#39;s a link:\n&lt;http://microformats.org=\r\n/wiki/rest/rails&gt;\n\nWhile waiting for Tonic since last year, I developed an =\r\nexperimental\nPHP5 MVC framework based on Mojavi, a php framework. Well, it&#39;=\r\ns a\nrough prototype just to discover how a restful framework should work.\nS=\r\no, it&#39;s not scale for deployment. Anyway, drop me a message if you\ninterest=\r\ned. ;)\n\nAnother possible deployment solution, but in java-based: NetKernel\n=\r\n[1]. It&#39;s quite inspiring but takes time to learn.\n\n-----\nWhile building th=\r\ne prototype framework, I found some essential\nlibraries for REST-based appl=\r\nications are still missing in PHP\ncodebase:\n\n=3D A complete HTTP/1.1 API =\r\n=3D\nREST-based apps use HTTP features heavily (e.g Conneg, Cache, HTTPAuth\n=\r\netc) but currently developers will have to build their own library\nfrom scr=\r\natch.\n\nActually, I&#39;m not sure who should provide HTTP library for php\ndevel=\r\nopers, the server extension (e.g Apache extension), or PHP\nextension? Would=\r\nn&#39;t it be great if we could use server&#39;s HTTP library\nstraight away in PHP?=\r\n :) Anyway, is it possible port the HTTP library\nfrom Jigsaw?\n\n=3D URL Mapp=\r\ning =3D\nREST-based apps use URL/URI heavily as identifier for resources.\nCu=\r\nrrently, we can use Apache&#39;s mod_rewrite, or Tomcat&#39;s url-servlet\nmapping t=\r\no map URLs with scripts (or controllers in mvc).\n\nBut, I think we need a mo=\r\nre scalable and dynamic URL Mapping model. It\nshould be made easy for tasks=\r\n (e.g redirection, dynamic mapping). It\nwould be nice if we able to control=\r\n the mapping straight away in PHP.\n\n... we will find a lot of duplicated wo=\r\nrks, which are already done in\nweb server, but will have to reinvent the wh=\r\neel in PHP for REST-based\napp development.\n\n[1] &lt;http://1060research.com/ne=\r\ntkernel/screencast/index.html&gt;\n\n----------------------\n&gt; - What&#39;s your thou=\r\nghts on REST in combination with Ajax?\n\nI tried rich-javascript client impl=\r\nemention, but still did XML\nprocessing at server-side (using PHP script). H=\r\nere&#39;s javascript\nframework: &quot;Prototype [2]&quot;, which provides a clean coding =\r\nstyle for\nusing the xmlhttprequest object.\n\nSome existing AJAX frameworks a=\r\nre lack of support for PUT, DELETE\nmethods and sending out limited content =\r\ntypes (some only support\nform/multipart & form/www-url-encoded). So, you ha=\r\nve to tweak the\ncodes before using them.\n\nBesides, AJAX.. maybe you can try=\r\n to experiment with AHAH (returning\nXHTML(maybe in microformats?) rather th=\r\nan XML). An AHAH example:\n&lt;http://www.larrystaton.com&gt;\n\n[2] &lt;http://prototy=\r\npe.conio.net/&gt;\n\n---------------\n&gt; Would Apache just check for &quot;Accept: text=\r\n/html&quot; and deliver XHTML?\n\nIf you are using PHP, you have code Conneg featu=\r\nre into the framework\nbefore the scripts understand the &quot;Accept&quot; header. As=\r\n I said, we have\nto reinvent the wheel, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense... ;=\r\n)\n\n\nCheers,\n--\nTeo HuiMing (toydi)\nhttp://restylab.wordpress.com\n\n"}}
