Since a lot of what I wrote was inspired by\nfollowing this group and sin=\r\nce this group is the most relevant (only?)\nplace for discussing REST - I&#39;d =\r\nlike to know what you think. Short\nversion (since the post is really long):=\r\n\n\nAlthough there&#39;s a lot of great blog posts, papers and mailing list\ndiscu=\r\nssions, the current material on REST is a mess which makes REST\nhard to und=\r\nerstand and confusing to discuss:\n* there is no agreed upon and widely used=\r\n terminology, but a lot of\nunexplained and overlapping terms,\n* discussions=\r\n are fragmented all over the web and often unnecessarily\nrepeat previous di=\r\nscussions,\n* there are no (formal or semi-formal) models of (important) con=\r\ncepts.\n\nTherefore, I think people involved in and enthusiastic about REST\n(=\r\nmostly people on this group) should:\n1. Agree that there is a problem worth=\r\n fixing =E2=80=93 do we think that we\ncan create a better, clearer and more=\r\n systematized way of\nunderstanding and discussing about REST?\n2. Express in=\r\nterest in fixing it =E2=80=93 is this something people want to\ncontribute t=\r\nheir time to?\n3. Agree on how to fix it =E2=80=93 what should be our output=\r\n (a RESTopedia, a\ndocument, video tutorials) and how would we all contribut=\r\ne to and\nmoderate the process?\n4. Do it =E2=80=93 spend time discussing and=\r\n developing the output.\n5. Eat our dogfood =E2=80=93 use whatever we produc=\r\ne. If we don=E2=80=99t use the\nterminology and models we agree upon, the th=\r\ne mess has only gotten\nbigger.\n\nCheers,\nIvan (hoping that all of this doesn=\r\n&#39;t sound as babbling of an\novereagerly naive megalomaniac)\n\n"}}
