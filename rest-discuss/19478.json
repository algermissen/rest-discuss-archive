http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-link-hint-00#section-5.1\n&gt;&gt; living in a world where we have JSON services, XML services, and RDF services, it seems that hard-coding a specific language data model into such a spec (without constraining it in any way) will limit the utility of such a registry.\n&gt; It needs *a* data model.\n\nyes, that&#39;s definitely true. i think what i&#39;m trying to figure out a \nfirst is whether there is any precedence of a registry requiring a JSON \ndata model, or any other specific language for that matter, for a \nstructured values. it seems it&#39;s mostly specific micro-syntaxes (if any \nstructure beyond identifiers is required), but i am really wondering \nabout what people have usually done in similar situations.\n\n&gt;&gt; for example, in the Home Document draft, which is the original source of the link hint idea, the hints were hard-coded with very constrained data models. this made it relatively easy to expose them in a different syntax (in the XML Home Document draft):\n&gt;&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-home-xml-01#page-4\n&gt;&gt; without getting too much into the details of this specific registry: what are the best practices about allowing/controlling language dependencies in registries?\n&gt; Whoa, hold on - who said anything about a language? This is just the underlying data model; you can express it in a document however makes sense.\n\nthat&#39;s kind of true, but not really. since the draft allows *any* kind \nof JSON, if i had a non-JSON document format (let&#39;s say XML ;-) that \nwanted to be able to represent registry values in general, it needs to \ndefine a generic mapping from *any* kind of JSON to XML. that&#39;s \ntechnically possible, but not really what works well for any non-JSON \ndocument model.\n\ni think this is my main argument: if you have a micro-syntax for the \nregistry, you can map that much easier to something that maps reasonably \nwell into a variety of document models. if you require JSON, and allow \narbitrary JSON, the JSON bias translates into rather inconvenient models \nfor any non-JSON language.\n\n&gt;&gt; personally, i would feel more comfortable with having a registry that is of equal value to people regardless of their implementation language\n&gt; You&#39;re using &quot;language&quot; quite loosely here.\n\nmaybe. and like i said above, apart from having implementation concerns \nabout non-JSON formats, i am also really interested to learn about prior \nart: how was this problem approached/solved in other situations like this?\n\n&gt;&gt; , but then again that means that the registry itself must define a &quot;mini-language&quot; of its own.\n&gt; -1. Defining Yet Another Data Model as a political solution to avoid picking an existing one is sub-optimal at best.\n\nnot sure. if JSON is #1 on the requirement list, then maybe define a \nwell-defined subset of JSON, so that mappings into other languages don&#39;t \nneed to be able to handle *any* JSON?\n\nmore specifically, what do the current hints actually need? it seems \nthat the set of possibilities is actually rather small. for example, \nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-link-hint-00#section-3.2 \nsays &quot;Content MUST be an object, whose keys are media types, and values \nare objects&quot;, but what are the objects containing? maybe a simple array \nof media type strings would suffice? and then, if we can boil down the \nneeds to &quot;hints are strings or arrays of strings&quot;, then we can create \ngood mappings for a variety of document models, and not just for JSON.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
