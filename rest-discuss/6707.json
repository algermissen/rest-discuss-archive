In particular, verbs should not\n&gt; &gt; appear. You wouldn&#39;t PUT a method invocation, thus it makes no more\n&gt; &gt; sense to POST it.\n&gt; I think it makes a lot more sense. When you use PUT (successfully),\n&gt; you&#39;re licensing intermediaries to conclude that the state of the\n&gt; targetted resource was changed to that represented in the request -\n&gt; something that&#39;s not true if you tunnel. If you use POST (i.e.\n&gt; POST(p)), intermediaries aren&#39;t licensed to conclude anything,\n&gt; therefore it&#39;s the best choice from a correctness POV.\n\nHaving had a few more days to claify my thoughts, I thought I would have\na second stab at this subject:\n\nI think that having a simple, complete, and closed mental model of what\nthe classic four methods mean is useful for developers hoping to write\nRESTful server-side software. I think this is primarily a social, rather\nthan a technical consideration. I have already summarised what I think\nthis mental model should be on restwiki:\n\nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?MinimumMethods\n\nIn particular, POST follows the semantics of rfc2616. The content should\nbe filed either as part of the identified resource or as a newly-created\nresource.\n\nIt is easy for someone who is new to REST to assume that POST means &quot;do\nanything I want&quot;. I think that the boundary between POST(p) and POST(t)\nis probably not clear enough to jump right into as a new RESTafarian.\nInstead, a new RESTafarian should be presented with a simple mental\nmodel of REST services:\n\nREST services consist of set of letter boxes. A client interacts with\nthe services only through the letter box, so doesn&#39;t know how they are\nreally being managed behind the scenes.\n\nThe letter boxes are a virtualisation of the state of multiple services,\nnot as arbitrary objects with arbitrary methods on them but as simpler\nobjects with uniform methods and a well-known set of content types.\n\nThe generally-accepted identifier scheme for REST is a URI. The\ngenerally-accepted verb set is GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. GET grabs data\nfrom a particular letter box. PUT puts data into the letter box,\nreplacing any existing data. POST adds another letter to the letter box\nwithout replacing the previous one. The service may choose to file this\nletter elsewhere, and will let you know where it has done so. DELETE\nremoves the letter from the letter box.\n\nAll communication is information transfer. REST swims along with this\ncurrent rather than trying to fight against it. These verbs acting on\nvirtualised state can achieve any interaction you want from a service.\nNo other kind of interaction should be required. REST allows for the\nevolution of verbs, identifier schemes, and content types... but most of\nthe innovation in the former two areas has probably already occured.\nThere is still a lot of innovation left to play out in the content-type\narena.\n\nThis teaching is the beginning of wisdom, rather than the end of it. As\nsuch, a client should use the looser &quot;process this&quot; definition of POST\nand make no assumptions about where its content ended up. However, I\nthink that focusing only on the technical implications of treating POST\na particular way is only half of the story. I think that just as\nimportant as the technical engineering involved with REST is the social\nengineering. I think that REST actually helps us (and thus, our\nsoftware) communicate.\n\nSeparating out the noun, verb, and content-type spaces and solving each\nproblem domain indivdually helps us start from a more complete and\nconsistent common ground. I think we are at a stage in the development\nof REST where we should be able offer a conceptually simple yet complete\ndefinition of the verb space. To me, &quot;process this&quot; still feels like a\nstatement that constrained methods don&#39;t work.. that you need an escape\nhatch. At the moment I&#39;m too curious about how the ideal plays out to\ndelve into something that feels like compromise.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
