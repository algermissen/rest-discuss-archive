Consensus (on atom-syntax at the very least) is \nPUT is not a patch/merge operator. To distinguish between the two forms \nof update. You can switch on something else, like a media type (or a \ntype param), but you have to define it per media type as opposed to once \nin the method (ie it&#39;s not uniform for all media). I&#39;ve always felt the \ntime to use a new methods is when the old method is dangerously close to \nwhat you want to do, but incorrect. All this said understanding the cost \nof introducing new methods.\n\nRDF/XML (application/rdf+xml) is interesting input to a gedanken - \nbecause of its graph structure it&#39;s perfect for clean merging and \npartial updates, but how does a server know when to merge with the \nexisting data graph and when to replace it? When you solve it using \nPUT/POST how will you solve it for turtle or RDFa?\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
