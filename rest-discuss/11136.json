Suddenly you \nimpose having an xml parser and other semantics in a container format and \nget dragged into wrapping your content-types within yet another content-type \nto manage.\n\nThe so-called reuse of content-types that atom provides is an illusion as \nyour entities will still need to exist in a format you have to define.\n\nSaying the complexity is being absorbed by the frameworks is like saying \ntransactions will magically all scale because we have WS-AtomicTransactions. \nIt&#39;s not true, it requires more and more layers of tools and toolkits and \nincrease the price you pay for your first shot.\n\nBe it in flash, XHR or plain Html forms, atom is not supported, and it \nshould probably never be. If you want to pass atom because the format makes \nsense and the client negotiated, that is quite fine. If you pass everything \nwrapped in ATOM saying that somehow putting an entity in an xml feed is \nfine, in the name of so-called commoditization of frameworks (something that \ncompanies that have been known to *create* the WS-* mess are now pushing \nvery hardly for), and not even providing other alternate content types that \nmake sense, is going against the simplicity and capability discovery that \nREST support out of the box.\n\nWould you wrap a jpeg file in an atom entry and base64 it? So why do it with \nanything else but namespaced composable xml languages, of which very few are \nactually composeable?\n\nSeb\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom: &quot;Aristotle Pagaltzis&quot; &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, August 05, 2008 11:25 AM\nTo: &quot;Rest List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: forms for web APIs\n\n&gt; * Assaf Arkin &lt;assaf@...&gt; [2008-08-05 10:40]:\n&gt;&gt; You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t do politics. I judge protocols on their\n&gt;&gt; merit. If a protocol is the best solution for the use cases it\n&gt;&gt; was designed for, it will surface to the top. But I won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; recommend unnecessary complexity to promote a spec.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the long term, that does more harm than good. I&#39;m actually\n&gt;&gt; surprised that we&#39;re not looking at the WS-* agenda games as a\n&gt;&gt; lesson learned. I&#39;m not convinced the answer is more politics,\n&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m very worried about cargo culting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s our job to recommend the best technology we know is\n&gt;&gt; sufficient to solve the problem at hand. And sometimes that\n&gt;&gt; means saying &quot;No. Not for this use case. Use your head, use\n&gt;&gt; [that] instead.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hammering is something WS-* has suffered from, and I&#39;d hate to\n&gt;&gt; see the same happen to REST, because once the false claims turn\n&gt;&gt; into broken promises, all that&#39;s left is backlash, and backlash\n&gt;&gt; has a way of diminishing the value of even the best\n&gt;&gt; technologies.\n&gt;\n&gt; You seem to have lost the plot. Do you accept that having fewer,\n&gt; more generically useful media types is good REST design? Is that\n&gt; for political reasons, too? If you find it acceptable, why do you\n&gt; accept the technical reasoning there but characterise it as\n&gt; despicable politics in protocols?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m seeing too many people enveloping everything they send with\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub, for no reason other than it&#39;s AtomPub, so it might be\n&gt;&gt; good, right? I see people who don&#39;t bother to learn REST, they\n&gt;&gt; just envelope with AtomPub â€” enveloping is easy, architecture\n&gt;&gt; style is hard. They&#39;re not even using it right, but they marked\n&gt;&gt; the checkbox, and yes, there&#39;s one case involving wrapping RPC\n&gt;&gt; calls inside AtomPub.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So when the time comes and we get to see SOAP passing over the\n&gt;&gt; wire, except the envelope is called AtomPub, would we stand\n&gt;&gt; back and smile and think to ourselves &quot;mission accomplished&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub is a good solution, just not the best solution to every\n&gt;&gt; problem. Using it like a hammer would be worse than not using\n&gt;&gt; it enough, possibly the worst thing that could happen to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP has been suffering from a massive case of hammering for a\n&gt; decade.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We need to teach developers how to engineer the right solution,\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the only way they could rise to the problem, not help\n&gt;&gt; them cargo cult the next shiny spec or the next best whatever.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t see enough of that, and quite frankly it saddens me and\n&gt;&gt; in some way even scares me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cargo cult happens. You cannot stop it. All you can do is design\n&gt; for surviving it. The technologies that succeed in the long term\n&gt; are those that have been so designed. People are morons; this is\n&gt; not a bug.[1]\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
