Unless you have some sort of\n&gt; super-AI that is capable of inferring those semantics on-the-fly,\n&gt; that knowledge will have to be programmed into the client ahead of\n&gt; time using some out-of-band description. That client is now tightly\n&gt; coupled to a particular representation.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m still not seeing the problem.  Any developer who coded a client\nagainst v1 of my example, will still have a functional client when v2\nis rolled out -- they&#39;ve coded an automaton which knows what data to\nplug into what variables, formatted as an urlencoded query URI.\n\nAny human can manipulate v2 as easily as v1, because the user-agent\nautomatically updated.  I wouldn&#39;t expect an m2m client to auto-\nupdate.  But any developer can update the code of such an m2m client by\nfollowing the annotated template the HTML of v2 provides, at their\nleisure.  The client is coupled to the API, not the representation; how\nis this avoided outside of REST?  Those are the super-AI clients I&#39;m\nfailing to understand...\n\nWhat out-of-band knowledge is required to interpret the v2 API, aside\nfrom the media type, which lays out explicitly that &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;th&gt; are\nmetadata, while &lt;dd&gt; and &lt;td&gt; are data, etc. allowing the name-value\npairs in the representation to be easily discerned?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
