Given that SPARQL has many &#39;needed&#39; features \nmissing, how many different variations of SPARQL do you think we&#39;d have \nby now? perhaps 5? 10? more? Maybe if we throw RDF in to the equation \ntoo, care to hazard a guess at how many variations we&#39;d have one year \non? each with their own version of &#39;named graphs&#39;, subject literals, and \nall kinds of other things. Maybe we should scope out of sem web \nterritory and consider JSON, do you think there may be a couple of media \ntypes minted for a JSON representation of a &#39;User&#39; yet? any other \nobjects that somebody somewhere would think it&#39;s a good idea to define \nas a media type and mint a new URI for? Maybe if we throw in XML and \nHTML too, in fact every existing media type from every domain and every \nexpert who thinks X media type they use often is lacking something, and \nall of those who think there&#39;s a better way to do Y, and all those \npeople who simply don&#39;t understand Z yet so have invented FOO; perhaps \nwe should also consider all of those vendors who&#39;d like some lock in, so \nthey&#39;ve moved to some custom media types and minted a few URIs, and of \ncourse are only supporting those media types now.\n\nIf you think for a second that you may just create a new media type and \nmint a URI for it, then you can knock the number of media types you \nthink there will be one year on up by (at least) one, then add on a \ncouple for every person on this list you think might be wanting to \ncreate a new media type, quite sure you could get +100 out of that :)\n\nMight be fun to say this came in to effect on the 22nd September 2005! \nShould be about the same but 5 years on, wonder if any of those domains \nhave dropped yet.. wonder which ones the major vendors are supporting.. \nthink any little payments might have been made to tool providers to get \nsupport for X media type in there? Wonder how many of these media type \nauthors have minted a new URI for each improved version of their media \ntype. Wonder if anybody&#39;s supporting that media type you created yet, \nwonder if 5 years on your still supporting it. Actually, tbh, I&#39;m mainly \nwondering just how many of those HTTP message-body&#39;s I can understand.\n\nThere are probably considerably more factors that I haven&#39;t considered \nhere, most notably what do you get when you dereference one of these \nURIs that identify a media type, oh, and what&#39;s the media type of the \nthing you do get when you dereference it - interesting for sure.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\nps: of course I really don&#39;t mean to come over as rude, just thought it \nmay be interesting to nudge people to consider what might happen by \nasking a series of questions :)\n\n"}}
