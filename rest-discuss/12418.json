Internal APIs tend to be \n&gt;&gt; more fine-grained and have a richer feature set than their external \n&gt;&gt; counterparts.  Those fine-grained APIs are more prone to change over \n&gt;&gt; time.  HATEOAS is meant help manage those kinds of changes .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I disagree.  HATEOAS helps humans manage change pretty well on the web. \n&gt;   I&#39;m very skeptical it can do the same for machine clients, for reasons \n&gt; stated in an earlier thread.  Still, that doesn&#39;t mean its not useful. \n&gt; Its just not as useful for machine clients as it is for humans.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know I stated this in an earlier thread, but combining links \n&gt; (HATEOAS), conneg, custom versioned media types, and XML schema is the \n&gt; most interesting for me.  Then, you can have validated, guaranteed, \n&gt; versioned interactions with your services.\n&gt;   \nHi Bill,\n\nAre there benefits of using custom versioned media types instead of \nusing a combination of standard media types and a custom version header?\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n"}}
