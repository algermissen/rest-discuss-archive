This condition is expected to be\n&gt; &gt; considered permanent.&quot; - rfc2616\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, fair point. It does however raise the question: &quot;What should\n&gt; happen if a PUT is made to a resource where it is known that it will\n&gt; never exist again?&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s expected that it will not exist again, not guaranteed. Certainly if it&#39;s\ndeemed very likely that something will be PUT there again it should be a 404\nrather than a 410, but it&#39;s not erroneous for something to be PUT to a URI\ncurrently resulting in 410.\n\nThe important consequence of this is that while recieving a 410 should result in\nany recorded information about a URI held other than on the server being\ndeleted*, it should not be assumed that a reference to that URI found elsewhere\nis outdated as it could exist because of something PUT there (or merely put\nthere by other means) later. So we should delete any such records, but not\nrecord them in any permanent &quot;known to not exist&quot; record.\n\n\n*Caches being the most obvious example, but 404s would also delete that data in\nmost cases (some specialised caches of information, rather than pure web\ncaches, may not) - a more interesting example would be a search engine&#39;s\nrecords for both search results and future spidering, a 404 could be a\ntemporary and erroneous condition so that URI should be respidered later, but a\n410 should drop the record from the respidering list - incidentally google seems\nto do this.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it&#39;s probably not a\nConceptualWork about a duck.&quot; - Mark Baker\n\n"}}
