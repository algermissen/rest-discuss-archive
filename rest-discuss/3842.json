Currently, I am using 403, saying\n&gt; that an invalid request entity (say, a non-well-formded XML document)\n&gt; would be &quot;forbidden&quot;. But the problem here is that the resource is what\n&gt; defines whether the request entity is valid or not (even the\n&gt; well-formedness of an XML document), so in *some* sense, a bad request\n&gt; entity &quot;conflicts&quot; with the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, supposing that 409 was the correct response to use, then what is 403\n&gt; for?  About the only example I could come up with was one mirroring a\n&gt; filesystem operation.  Suppose you have a resource that is marked\n&gt; &quot;read-only&quot;.  An attempt to PUT to that resource may be valid if it were\n&gt; not read-only, but otherwise would return a 403.  This is not a conflict,\n&gt; necessarily (though I could see it rephrased that way), and therefore not\n&gt; appropriate for a 409 response.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 31, 2003 at 09:11:23AM -0400, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose an application detects a problem with the request entity.\n&gt; Should a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 403 (forbidden) or a 409 (conflict) be returned?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d use 400.
