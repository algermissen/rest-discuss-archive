Sorry if I&#39;m re-opening the scab\non an old flame war!\n\nI&#39;ve been asked to set up a generic REST interface for a variety of data,\nprobably using CherryPy.  We don&#39;t appear to have a lot of REST under our\nbelts (I know I don&#39;t), and I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a lot of misunderstanding of\ntrue REST around the internet (getting it conflated with the weaker goals\nof RPC), so naturally, I&#39;d like to see if we can get it (REST) right from\nthe start.  Getting it right seems (so far) to boil down to keeping the\nverbs (and adjectives?) out of our URL&#39;s, and just letting\nGET/PUT/POST/DELETE be our verbs, sent to noun-nodes in our hierarchy.\n\nWe&#39;re having a discussion about using CherryPy&#39;s MethodDispatcher (CRUD)\nand RoutesDispatcher (whatever you make of it) - and perhaps others, and\nwhich would be better to encourage true REST.  I caught wind of a meme\nsuggesting MethodDispatcher is more RESTful (more &quot;directly&quot; REST) than\nother dispatchers.  Would it be a bad thing to use one and not the other,\nfor the sake of REST?  And is REST purity worth bothering with?  Is it a\ngoal that often can&#39;t be reached 100%, but is still worth striving toward?\n\nHere&#39;s a pair of CherryPy Links about how to use MethodDispatcher and\nRoutesDispatcher:\nhttp://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/HTTPMethodFiltering\nhttp://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/RoutesUrlMatching\n\nThanks!\n\r\n--14dae9340e2ff822f504c64f46e6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;I just sent this to a CherryPy mailing list (web framework), but I thou=\r\nght I should ask the same question here too.=A0 Sorry if I&#39;m re-opening=\r\n the scab on an old flame war!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve been asked to set up a gener=\r\nic REST interface for a variety of data, probably using CherryPy.=A0 We don=\r\n&#39;t appear to have a lot of REST under our belts (I know I don&#39;t), a=\r\nnd I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a lot of misunderstanding of true REST around=\r\n the internet (getting it conflated with the weaker goals of RPC), so natur=\r\nally, I&#39;d like to see if we can get it (REST) right from the start.=A0 =\r\nGetting it right seems (so far) to boil down to keeping the verbs (and adje=\r\nctives?) out of our URL&#39;s, and just letting GET/PUT/POST/DELETE be our =\r\nverbs, sent to noun-nodes in our hierarchy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;We&#39;re having a disc=\r\nussion about using CherryPy&#39;s MethodDispatcher (CRUD) and RoutesDispatc=\r\nher (whatever you make of it) - and perhaps others, and which would be bett=\r\ner to encourage true REST.=A0 I caught wind of a meme suggesting MethodDisp=\r\natcher is more RESTful (more &quot;directly&quot; REST) than other dispatch=\r\ners.=A0 Would it be a bad thing to use one and not the other, for the sake =\r\nof REST?=A0 And is REST purity worth bothering with?=A0 Is it a goal that o=\r\nften can&#39;t be reached 100%, but is still worth striving toward?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Here&#39;s a pair of CherryPy Links about how to use MethodDispatcher and =\r\nRoutesDispatcher:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://tool=\r\ns.cherrypy.org/wiki/HTTPMethodFiltering&quot;&gt;http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/HTT=\r\nPMethodFiltering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/RoutesUr=\r\nlMatching&quot;&gt;http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/RoutesUrlMatching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--14dae9340e2ff822f504c64f46e6--\r\n\n"}}
