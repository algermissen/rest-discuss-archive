You won&#39;t find any\n&gt; mention of TCP in RFC 2616 (I hope - I don&#39;t have it handy) for example,\n&gt; but XHTML couldn&#39;t exist without XML.\n\n&quot;HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The\ndefault port is TCP 80 [19], but other ports can be used. This does not\npreclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on the\nInternet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport;\nany protocol that provides such guarantees can be used; the mapping of\nthe HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the transport data\nunits of the protocol in question is outside the scope of this\nspecification.&quot;\n\nBut you can imagine a similar state for XHTML (in a world where there\nwere multiple competing markup language syntaxes):\n\n&quot;This does not preclude XHTML from being encoded in any other syntax.\nXHTML only presumes a concept of &#39;element&#39; and &#39;attribute&#39;. Blah blah\nblah blah.&quot; \n\nIn fact it is very trendy these days to define markup languages in terms\nof the &quot;infoset&quot; and say that &quot;any mapping from any syntax to the\ninfoset is legal.&quot; So you could imagine an XHTML this is an extension to\nthe &quot;infoset&quot; but the infoset would be a layer on top of XML itself.\n(after all, it has been implemented on top of relational databases etc.)\n\n&gt; A HTTP connection isn&#39;t necessarily a TCP connection because of this.\n\nThe same goes for many XML specifications. XHTML doesn&#39;t happen to have\nthat language in the spec because there is no real competitor to XML\n(though there are hardly competitors to TCP used much anymore either!).\n\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
