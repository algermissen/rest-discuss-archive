Maybe\n\nThe full name won&#39;t make much sense to most people, but &quot;REST&quot; is a\nmemorable word.  &quot;SOAP&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Simple Object Access Protocol&quot;\nanymore, so perhaps you can use the term without getting into what\nit means.\n\n&gt; when I get more REST-Zen I&#39;ll think that the core idea in the web\n&gt; architecture is the transfer of state representations but right now I\n&gt; think that&#39;s just one issue, along with unified naming conventions,\n&gt; generic methods, standardization of content types, client-side\n&gt; scripting, etc. The whole architecture has no single clear defining\n&gt; characteristic so I don&#39;t think it should be named after a particular\n&gt; one. \n\nWell, REST is that.  The implications of doing state transfer include\nneeding some common minimal interface, need a way to identify the\nthings that have state, etc..\n\nNo single name could capture everything you want to talk about above,\nbecause not all of them are architectural issues.\n\n&gt; Okay, REST isn&#39;t going away but maybe we can have a different name when\n&gt; the style is applied to so-called &quot;Web services&quot;. I propose World Wide\n&gt; Web Architectural Style : WWWAS\n&gt; \n&gt; Using the full form of &quot;the Web&quot; may get people thinking back to roots.\n&gt; It is not an English word so a single essay will score easily in Google.\n&gt; WWWAS would individuate itself (informally) from REST over a while by\n&gt; adopting standardized XML formats that apply to web services problems.\n&gt; Or maybe WWWAS is REST+XML and everything XML allows.\n\nIck, I don&#39;t care for it much.\n\nIf I was describing REST, then I would personally feel obligated to\nuse the name.  The last thing we need is to have to explain the\nrelationship between REST and whatever new name you come up with\nfor whatever it is you&#39;re trying to identify.  Please try to avoid\ndefining a new term.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
