One of the feedbacks was that &quot;it is not clea=\r\nr what\n&gt; would happen for SOAP requests of large/complex data structures (s=\r\neveral MBs\n&gt; of XML data). It does not seem possible to map these to URI st=\r\nrings (which\n&gt; have limited length, up to a few Kbs) so the proposed framew=\r\nork is not\n&gt; likely to work in real-world industrial applications of Web se=\r\nrvices\n&gt; technology&quot;.\n&gt; =A0=A0 My question here is : is this accurate? are =\r\nSOAP retrieval-requests that\n&gt; complex that they cannot be accommodated in =\r\na URI ? The return data is not\n&gt; an issue - I just return the same as SOAP =\r\nwould return.\n\nYes, it&#39;s accurate. There are many domains that pass around =\r\nvery\ncomplicated requests, and the requests are very large. There&#39;s no way,=\r\n\nin a general case, to expect them to fit within a URL. I have one\nright he=\r\nre that&#39;s 8K in length, and that&#39;s before the SAML annotations\nthat need to=\r\n be applied to it. It&#39;s 166 lines of &#39;well formatted&#39; XML,\njust to give an =\r\nidea of the complexity.\n\nFinally, I&#39;m curious how your framework &quot;RESTify&quot;s=\r\n a SOAP\narchitecture? How does it fundamentally rearchitect the underlying\n=\r\nconcepts the SOAP API is fronting and turn it in to a view of\nresources? Ho=\r\nw does it push any state managed by the SOAP back end in\nto the client? How=\r\n can it do any of these things to &quot;RESTify&quot; the\nsystem that happens to be u=\r\nsing a SOAP based API?\n\nIn fact, what does REST have to do with this at all=\r\n? Sounds more like\nyour converting SOAP envelopes in to GET/PUT/POST/DELETE=\r\ns, etc. which\nare all about HTTP the protocol, not REST the architecture. A=\r\ndding an\nHTTP API with GETs and POSTs does not a REST system make. You just=\r\n end\nup with an RPC system using a different protocol than SOAP.\n\nRegards,\n=\r\n\nWill Hartung\n\n"}}
