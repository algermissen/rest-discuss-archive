If this resource is not found (e.g. because it has been deleted before)=\r\n a 404 will be returned.\n\nNow I wonder which status code should be returned=\r\n if the resource\n/mySets/{set}\nis not found.\nAlso a 404? A 400?\n\nI&#39;m not so=\r\n happy about a 404 because it lacks some semantics - the DELETE on the subr=\r\nesource (or subsubresource) /mySets/{set}/{item} implies that /mySets/{set}=\r\n exists. If this is not given it might indicate a conflict or that the clie=\r\nnt is wrong in some way.\n\nWhile looking for appropriate response codes base=\r\nd on their name 409 (Conflict), 410 (Gone) or 412 (Precondition Failed) sou=\r\nnd interesting (see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#=\r\nsec10.4 )) but their semantics does not match really.\n\nMy current choice wo=\r\nuld be to return 400 (Bad Request), but this has also different semantics.\n=\r\n\nDo you have suggestions how to handle this?\n\nThanx && cheers,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
