You\n&gt; &gt; assme it is an orderable item. This assumption is equivalent to a &#39;resource\n&gt; &gt; type&#39;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yep, if we want a machine client to seek a goal (shop online, etc.),\n&gt; we have to have enough out-of-band information ahead of time in order\n&gt; to program it accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the _resources_ that need to be\n&gt; documented. Instead, I think the key ingredient is a media-type that\n&gt; has sufficiently documented hypermedia constraints (link elements and\n&gt; rel values, along w/ important data elements) to communicate the\n&gt; semantics involved.\n\nThis.\n\nFrom earlier, Jan wrote:\n\n&gt; Does anyone have an idea how to align this (IMHO fact) with the\n&gt; constraint that no information about resource types must be made\n&gt; available to clients in RESTful systems?\n\nWhere does this expectation come from? That somehow you can go in to a\nsystem &quot;blind&quot; and be able to do anything whatsoever with it? The &quot;out\nof band&quot; information is about making assumptions about resources that\nthe hypermedia doesn&#39;t specifically allow for. Basically, the resource\nshould have links telling the client what the next steps are that can\nbe taken. Just because you &quot;know&quot; about some URI sequence, if you\ndidn&#39;t extract this from a representation, then you shouldn&#39;t be using\nit. The only URIs etc that you should &quot;know&quot; are published, and\ndocumented endpoints. Anything else is organic, and should only be\nused in the context presented with the resource.\n\nFor example. I&#39;ve been to sites, with Search functions or whatever.\nWhen I see the results, they show, say, 10 items and offer &quot;next&quot;\nbuttons.\n\nBeing lazy, I see in the actual URL, there&#39;s something like\n&quot;pageSize=10&quot;. So, more than once I&#39;ve simply replaced the 10 with,\nsay, 50, and many times the site replies with a new page with 50 items\nper page instead of 10.\n\nMy &quot;hacking&quot; of that URL is &quot;out of band&quot; information. The result did\nnot have an actual link for &quot;view 50 items per page&quot;. I dissected and\nhacked the URL which should be treated as opaque.\n\nBut the fact that there&#39;s a &quot;rel=&#39;next&#39;&quot; link on that page, how would\nI as a client &quot;know&quot; that means &quot;go to the next page&quot;? I wouldn&#39;t, I\ncan&#39;t intuit that, it needs to be documented somewhere, and that\nawareness needs to be coded in to my document.\n\nThe key, as Mike mentioned, is the media-types. Those are what are\nneeded to be &quot;understood&quot; by the clients. And this understanding is\nout of band information. The media-type would have informed me what\nthe &quot;rel=&#39;next&#39;&quot; link means.\n\nHow do you think you can interpret XML or HTML or JPEG or anything at\nall? Because you have code that understands these media types and what\nyou can do with them.\n\nNow, if your media-type is application/vnd.order+xml, and you\nunderstand that media type, then your client &quot;knows&quot; how links are\ndescribed, what &quot;rel&quot; tags to follow to do what, etc.\n\nThis information will ALWAYS have to be conveyed &quot;out of band&quot;,\nnotably for MtoM transactions.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
