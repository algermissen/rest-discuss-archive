For example, say I had this resource:\n&gt;\n&gt; /team/cubs\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like to represent the resulting resource as HTML, JSON, CSV,\n&gt; etc.... The easiest way would be to append a &quot;view&quot; query string  \n&gt; value:\n&gt;\n&gt; /team/cubs?view=csv\n&gt; /team/cubs?view=json\n&gt; ....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nThese are different representations of the same resource, and this use  \ncase is better addressed via content negotiation (i.e. via Accept  \nheaders). You may still want to add query parameters like the above  \nfor those clients that can&#39;t generate headers (like using a browser to  \nquickly fetch a representation).\n&gt; Another option would be to rely on the request HTTP headers sent from\n&gt; the client. I like this approach from an athestic pov, since it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t muck up the URLs. But it places a big dependency on the\n&gt; clients being able to correctly set the right headers. Also, some\n&gt; headers could have more than one value, so you get into situations\n&gt; where ordering must be figured out. So it seems like the query string\n&gt; approach is the most deterministic and also the least complex.\n&gt;\n\nCompletely ignoring content negotiation through accept headers means  \nthat the server will end up inventing its own rules for content  \nnegotiation for media types, and potentially for languages. Supporting  \nmultiple values for Accept headers may add some extra complexity, but  \nit is just a one time code that could be centralized.\n\nA better approach is to support both content negotiation through  \naccept headers, as well as through a query parameter, with the latter  \nbeing an override for clients that can&#39;t support Accept headers.\n\nSubbu\n\n\n"}}
