If anything, D is the domain from which\n&gt; representations are drawn and (D -&gt; D) represents the mapping of a\n&gt; pre-state for a given resource to its post-state, and in that sense,\n&gt; the &#39;return&#39; value of the function we&#39;re interested in means that\n&gt; the function is defined as a pair\n&gt;\n&gt; \t(PUT | POST | DELETE) /foo &lt;representation&gt;\n&gt; \tGET /foo\n&gt;\n&gt; So that the final get represents the function&#39;s value (i.e., the\n&gt; second &#39;D&#39; in the mapping from D -&gt; D).\n&gt;\n&gt; Other definitions of &#39;idempotent&#39; refer to things like recursive\n&gt; inclusion of C header files; not very enlightening.\n\nI think the first definition is just fine. The function here is the \nrequest, and the domain and range are states of the server (feel free \nto replace &quot;server&quot; with &quot;resource&quot; throughout if you&#39;d prefer, it \nshouldn&#39;t make any difference).\n\nLet&#39;s write s, s&#39; for states of the server, g(s) and p(s) for,\n\n  GET /foo\n\nand,\n\n  PUT /foo    (with a fixed PUT entity)\n\nrespectiverly, applied to the server in state s. The 9.1 definitions \nimply that,\n\n  g(s) = s\n\nhence,\n\n  g(g(s)) = g(s)\n\nbecause GET is both safe and idempotent. OTOH, the imply that,\n\n  p(s) = s&#39;   (where typically s&#39; != s)\n\nbecause PUT isn&#39;t safe, but,\n\n  p(s&#39;) = s&#39;   \n\nbecause PUT is idempotent, and hence,\n\n  p(p(s)) = p(s)\n\nDELETE will be similar to PUT.\n\nOne thing to note here is that what the client sees isn&#39;t mentioned at \nall: all the above is defined in terms of server states and functions \nmapping server states to server states.\n\nHmm ... spelt out this way, there&#39;s a trivial proof that all sequences \nof idempotent requests are idempotent sequences. That means that either \nthere&#39;s something wrong with spelling things out this way (in which \ncase, what?), or there&#39;s something not quite right with 9.1\n\nThoughts?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
