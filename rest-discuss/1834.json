So I rarely\nused them in the way you mentioned, since that required threads to be\nmanaged.  I almost always just checked for a response.  So you could\nimagine a REST based future interface that used a local proxy to manage\nyour &quot;callback mailboxes&quot;, permitting a HEAD to one of those URIs to be\n&quot;checkForResponse&quot;, GET to be &quot;getResponseAndBlock&quot;, and\n&quot;registerCallback&quot; would be when your app code was tightly bound with\nthe mailbox through APIs.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
