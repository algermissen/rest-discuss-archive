If the former, \n&gt; then I think you&#39;re missing the\n&gt; full power of the servlet spec if you believe this can be done for GET \n&gt; but not for PUT, DELETE,\n&gt; etc.\n\nGood question.  I mean the content (the body of the HTTP message).  I \nhave to do validation on the content for obvious reasons.  In my mind \nthere is basic validation which I can easily mark up as rules (regexp, \nxpath statements, even xml schema).  That&#39;s the stuff I want to validate \nautomatically.  Of course, there is some business validation which would \nbe harder to do via declarative rules which I would still have to support.\n\nControlling the URI is easy.  Problem is, the URI doesn&#39;t have enough \ninformation in it to help me do all validation (by design).  So there is \na second level of authorization control by looking at the actual content \nof the message.\n\nThat is what I was wondering if existed before.\n\nA step closer is to do XML Schema validation on the content.  That&#39;s \nclose, but not perfect.  For example:\n\nBob can PUT &lt;stuff&gt;A&lt;/stuff&gt;\nAlice can PUT &lt;stuff&gt;B&lt;/stuff&gt;\n\nNotice the contents of the stuff tag are different for each person.  If \nI need to support rules like that, I&#39;d need two versions of the XML Schema.\n\nTo me, XPath statements are small enough to collect a large number of \nthem for each user.  They can also be stored in the database.\n\nProblem with that is our data is RDF/XML.  Since the RDF can be encoded \nin multiple valid ways, I can&#39;t write an XPath that can validate any RDF.\n\nI&#39;m currently toying with the idea of creating an XML Schema that can \nparse correctly as RDF.  That way, I still get benefits of RDF (once I \ntie into DAML+OIL schemas and do my inferencing) plus I can do XPath \nstatements that I know will validate the document.\n\nAlso, I can store my validation rules in a database, and attach these \nrules as policies to URI patterns.\n\n*phew*\n\nDoes this gel, or am I going at it completely wrong?\n\nThanks!\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms090404060905000600070801\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms090404060905000600070801--\r\n\n"}}
