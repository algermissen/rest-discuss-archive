Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another way to look at this HTTP/REST thing is:  if HTTP is the only\n&gt; &gt; implementation of REST that the REST-minded community will discuss, then\n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; do we even have REST in the first place?  REST is only useful as a\nconcept\n&gt; &gt; that could be generally applied.  Otherwise, it may as well be called\n&gt; &quot;HTTP\n&gt; &gt; Guidelines&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a very good point. This discussion could (and probably should) be\n&gt; boiled down into &quot;HTTP Guidelines&quot; - but the REST principles stand apart\n&gt; from HTTP.\n\nYes, the REST principles do stand apart.  My mistake was in believing that\nthis list focused on REST itself, not &quot;REST as it applies to HTTP&quot;.\n\n&gt; Personally, I have used the principles where I needed to build\nlarge-scale,\n&gt; long-lived technology in support of products/applications - even when I\n&gt; could not directly use HTTP for one reason or another.\n\nYet according to some, there isn&#39;t anything that HTTP can&#39;t do.  ;)  And\nmaybe Jeff Bone is right.  Maybe it is the uberprotocol (at least as far as\nREST is concerned).  I am going to have to do some more searhing, playing,\netc. to see how this is possible.  And in the end, I would be happy to\ndiscover his truth.\n\nIn the meantime, is there a list out there that is about REST itself?  Sure,\nI expect HTTP to come up in conversation now and then, but I want something\nthat is primarily about REST and not HTTP (which I am beginning to believe\nthis list is actually about).  I know I have some more te learn before I\nfully understand REST.  I am finding that using HTTP to teach REST is just\ntoo confusing.  HTTP brings too much baggage with it (even if the baggage is\nnothing more than the &quot;tradtional web mindset&quot;).\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
