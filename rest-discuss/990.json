At the appointed \ntime, \n&gt; &gt; the Buyer could check the URI for the Acceptance or Rejection \n&gt; &gt; document and if it&#39;s not there, the deal is off.  How would you \n&gt; &gt; handle that?  We want it to be clear to both parties that the \ndeal is \n&gt; &gt; off, so they don&#39;t end up in court because the Seller tried to \nkeep \n&gt; &gt; going.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could do this two ways.  One would be as Mike said, to include\n&gt; the time information in the document.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with\n&gt; this at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another way would be to generalize the whole &quot;message validity&quot;\n&gt; mechanism and build an extension header with HTTP or SOAP to support\n&gt; it for any message.  You&#39;d need a mandatory extension mechanism to\n&gt; deploy it, otherwise you&#39;d never know if the receiver knew what you \nwere\n&gt; talking about.  That would be an interesting extension, for sure.\n\nRegardless of how the time constraint is expressed (an element of the \nOrder document is fine with me), the issue I was trying to raise was \nhow to make the order explicitly defunct.  Could be deleted, but \nthat&#39;s often disallowed in business.  So it should be canceled.  And \nlet&#39;s say that it is the Buyer&#39;s responsibility to do so.\n\nJust to indicate more where I am going with this line of inquiry, the \nnext problem I want to think about is the &quot;counteroffer pending&quot; \nresponse, where the Seller will next make a counteroffer to the \nBuyer.  \n\nWhere I am trying to go is into the resource model for this stuff: \nwhat becomes a Web resource, where?  \n\n-Bob Haugen \n\n\n"}}
