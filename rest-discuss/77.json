You need a reply-to: header\n&gt; with an IP address and a port. The server returns &quot;900: Sure, I&#39;ll get\n&gt; back to you when I can&quot;.\nNo. Use Status 202 &quot;Accepted&quot;.\n\nYou are right that the initial request should use a Reply-To: header.\nThe final &#39;response&#39; that closes the request/response message exchange comes\nas a new request into the Reply-To address.\n\nThat is probably a PUT to the uri in Reply-To as determined by the initiator\nof the exchange. That uri would identify a place to update the status of the\ninitial outgoing message. The\ncontent would be type message/http-response - not sure if something like\nthis is registered.\n\n&gt; This would be good where the basic pattern is request-response but the\n&gt; computation may take very long (especially in a workflow-type situation)\nOooh. Workflow. Another holy grail.\n\n&gt; and the client doesn&#39;t want to keep a socket open for days or weeks on\n&gt; end.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, notifications is about reporting when a resource\n&gt; changes. The primary virtue of notifications is that they break the\n&gt; request-response pattern of HTTP.\nNot necessarily.\nA notification about a &#39;pending request&#39; is about a resource if you model it\nas such.\n\n&gt; So it is *more than asynch behaviour*\n&gt; that is interesting in notifications. It is multi-response. In my &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; asynch HTTP you could only emulate multi-response by making multiple\n&gt; requests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you are interested in notifications, not just asych HTTP.\n&gt;\nAll current HTTP needs for asynchronous request/response is :\n use request header of Reply-To,\n response status of 204 Accepted\n future request to Reply-To uri with content-type: message/http-response.\n\nIt would be useful to define an HTTP message that indicates a notification\nabout the status of a &#39;pending request&#39; (my term - everybodies got one...).\nThis &#39;request&#39; would need to indicate what pending message (identified as a\nresource) it is &#39;about&#39;. This could be used to let the requestor know that\nerrors have occurred, but the processing hasn&#39;t given up. That&#39;s the\ndifference between a notification and a response.\nThis notification might have to indicate that it is only &#39;advisory&#39; and not\na &#39;close the transaction&#39; type of response to an initial request. The HTTP\nmethod might be the best place - otherwise a custom content type.\n\n==\n\nHere&#39;s a try at what the message exchange would look like with this\napproach:\n\n== Submitting a purchase order ==\nPOST http://www.widgets.com/industrial/widgets/purchase-orders/ HTTP/1.1\nReply-To: http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/ack/\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Model: PurchaseOrder\nAuthenticiation: Basic YNGQ7G=\n\n&lt;po&gt;\n&lt;item&gt;ChromedWidget&lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;quantity&gt;27&lt;/quantity&gt;\n&lt;unit-of-measure&gt;pounds&lt;/unit-of-measure&gt;\n&lt;/po&gt;\n\n== Acknowledgement of submission ==\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nLocation: http://www.widgets.com/customer59/po/abcdef/\n\n\n== Message that updates status of purchase order ===\nNOTIFY http://www.smallbiz.com/accounting/po/12345/ack/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: message/http-event\nAuthenticiation: Basic Y7GHHA==\n\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nWe are experiencing technical difficulties.
