For example, a geospatial system could\n&gt; have returned millions of lat/long URIs in various representations over the\n&gt; years, but never returned one with the specific lat/long that a client\n&gt; script generates, eg no one had ever asked about THAT part of the Pacific\n&gt; yet.\n&gt; But pragmatically there seems to me to be no difference at all. In other\n&gt; words, the idea that one can substantially reduce the dependencies between\n&gt; clients and servers by returning a network of URIs in representations\n&gt; (HATEOAS) instead of explicitly documenting the URI templates that could\n&gt; generate them, seems only to work if one prohibits or at least discourages\n&gt; promiscuous bookmarking of URIs, ie prohibits deep linking by REST clients.\n&gt; This is why I think the structure of URIs IS important and the use of URI\n&gt; templates is NOT suspect. Do others see this as a tension as well, or I am\n&gt; just misunderstanding something?\n&gt; \n\nIf a server returns to the client a URI template -- and assuming\nclients have a way to identify URI templates in the returned\nhypermedia e.g. the definition of the  Content-type defines\n&lt;uri-template&gt;  tags -- then completing a URI template isn&#39;t any\ndifferent than completing a HTML form. So, URI templates need not\nconflict with HATEOAS.\n\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
