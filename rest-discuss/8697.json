It&#39;s at http://rest.corank.com . It&#39;s very default-looking right now, but I hope to jazz it up a little. (Any suggestions?) Personally, I&#39;ve been doing web service-related software (mostly geospatial metadata, catalogs and portals) for a while now, and I think the ball is finally rolling for REST. Anyway, just hoping something like this might be useful... What do you think??\n\nSubscribed, but not joined (at least for the present)\n\n"}}
