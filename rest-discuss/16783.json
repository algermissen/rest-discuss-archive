There is no one current representation making up the single current application state, there are potentially scores of them, present and past. So any links are only state transitions in the sense that the overall application state can be progressed as a whole by /fetching more stuff/, perhaps in parallel.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that you get decoupling because, even though the hypermedia constrains and guides what is available at any time, it&#39;s up to the client (or, perhaps, the user driving that client if it&#39;s a browser) what it does to explore - perhaps in parallel - the hypermedia landscape before it, and in what order - perhaps back to previous places on that landscape. The current history, cache and rendered page (for a browser) are parts of the whole application state.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, don&#39;t forget the back button! There&#39;s not always a link for that in the hypermedia you&#39;re focusing on...!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure others will chime in with their own interpretations... :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; (oh - smaller tip: don&#39;t say &#39;HATEOAS&#39;, say &#39;Hypermedia Constraint&#39;! =0)\n&gt; \n&gt; Duncan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
