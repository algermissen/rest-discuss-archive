The term =\r\nis (and likely will be) very overloaded in the IT industrie.\n\nI think, it i=\r\ns time to push forward terms like &quot;hypermedia service/API&quot; or &quot;hypermedia-a=\r\nware client&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;hey i have a RESTful API&quot;, tell the people=\r\n &quot;i have a hypermedia API!&quot;. \n\nThe term &quot;hypermedia service&quot; stands for** :=\r\n\n\n- support of addressable resources\n- standard-conform usage of the unifor=\r\nm interface\n- (hopefully) a cleaner interface/interaction design\n- etc...\n\n=\r\n\nIMHO, &quot;hypermedia&quot; is still a stepchild. It should be some kind of quality=\r\n characteristic. What do you think?\n\nJakob\n\n\n* I=B4m glad, the microsoft gu=\r\nys label their latest framework Web API (as opposed to the former WCF &quot;REST=\r\n&quot; Starter Kit...)\n** at least more than &quot;REST&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
