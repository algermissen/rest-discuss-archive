We&#39;re talking about HTTP GET, so it would have to be HTTP \nheaders...which is a pain for structured information.\n\nWhat if each individual page on a site uses only some small subset of \nthem? There are performance costs to sending them all every time. It is \nquite a bit cheaper to send a URL or list of URLs and let the recipient \nchoose which to dereference and how deeply to follow links into the \nrepresentations it finds.\n\n====\n\nTo me, statelessness has these advantages:\n\n  1. Conversations can migrate between agents and devices because there \nis no privileged information associated with the connection between the \ninitial &quot;initator&quot; and the &quot;listener&quot;. My proposal preserves this.\n\n  2. Filtering, caching and other intermediary projects are easier \nbecause there is no need to store state between messages. My proposal \npreserves this. Filters and caches _may_ need to dereference URIs, but \nthey don&#39;t have to maintain state themselves. That is important for \nscalability. It means cache&#39;s memory usage does not increase with the \nnumber of conversations they watch.\n\n  3. If a message is missed or a conversation partner dies, it is easy \nto &quot;reboot&quot; and &quot;resynch&quot; the client and server state through transfer \nof representations. My proposal preserves this.\n\n  4. Logs are explicit so that historically you can look at a single \nmessage in isolation and understand its meaning entirely. My proposal \ndoes not preserve this.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would get all 4 every time. But if the only \nproblem is really &quot;4.&quot; then I consider that an acceptable cost. On the \nother hand, if there is some other major benefit of scalability I am \nmissing...\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
