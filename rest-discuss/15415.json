I keep saying HTTP since it&#39;s not only about pure REST. When I say HTTP I mean we will still support RPC style POX / Plain old JSON, but that is not our primary intent.\n\nOk. Agreed with both.\n\n\n&gt; It is supporting a natural programming model for a resource-oriented service approach.\n\nHow far would you go and question existing programming models to go towards REST?\n\n(E.g. I have personally dropped the notion of &#39;service&#39; from my own brain because it just gets in the way because it is an interface centric idea (at least as it is commonly used))\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is not about retrofitting to WCF, been there done that. :-) We may use some core peices as appropriate but we have in the works a new client and server story for building HTTP style services.\n\nGreat. I guess a f2f meet-up is sort of mandatory. I&#39;ll let that sink in.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; On Wed, May 26, 2010 at 1:29 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On May 26, 2010, at 10:11 PM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What if we arranged it &quot;off site&quot; where you wouldn&#39;t need attendance.
