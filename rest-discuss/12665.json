However, it missed my point\n\nLet me try to clarify the solution I offered.\n\nOne representation (the xml document containing the &lt;Address&gt; element) can\nbe accepted by two different resources (the existing address and the\ncustomer), using two different links (one for replacing the address, the\nother one for asking the customer to add a new address).\n\nThe difference here is that I have multiple resources, that happen to have\nthe same representation, but generate different commands.\n\n&gt; If, as you suggest you only have a single representation with a set of\n&gt; changes there will be some &quot;commands&quot; that are indistinguishable.\n\nI suggest that one media type may have multiple elements describing the\nstate of the resource, and that two different resources may have two\ndifferent representations while still using the same media type. I suggest\nas well that multiple resources can operate upon the same domain model if\nthey wish to, this is completely irrelevant to the ReST side of things, and\nis an implementation detail that, if leaked, would break ReST constraints.\n\n&gt; I do think if you are going to do CQS with REST, the client needs to\n&gt; initiate the command.\n\nThe client follows links prepared by the server. If a client knows about\n&quot;commands&quot; and where to send them in advance, you loose the values you get\nby giving URIs to things.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t model every command as a URI accepting a POST and\nnot accepting a GET, but tunnelling everything through POST is usually a\nsign that you&#39;re shy of creating new resources for new things that need to\nbe changed individually, or you don&#39;t want the server to control the\ninteraction.\n\nIf you don&#39;t need the benefits of exposing resources on a ReST interface and\njust need a POX way to channel messages to a unique endpoint, then do so.\n\nFrom my understanding of the scenario you propose, where a client needs to\ninitiate a command it knows about, where the interaction is inside the\nmessage and opaque to intermediaries, one cannot &quot;do CQS with REST&quot; because\none would be breaking ReST constraints.\n\nAs for the difference between command messages and documents with various\nURIs and link relationships, it comes from the simple fact that I wish my\napplications to be layered, so that the semantics of following links,\ninterpreting relationships to build representations should be reused across\nthe codebase, rather than imperatively coded in the client.\n\nThis lets the server change both the interaction model and the semantics of\nan operation without changing the client. If you have the luxury of\ncontrolling the client, you probably don&#39;t need the secularity of a ReST\ninterface. \n\nSeb\n\n\n\n"}}
