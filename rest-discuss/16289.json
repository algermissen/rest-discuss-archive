If you take\n&gt; an index spider, for example: Some human has the goal of the site\n&gt; being indexed. The user agent is the piece of code that acts on\n&gt; behalf of that human, meaning: the whole spider is the user agent\n&gt; component.\n&gt;\n&gt; This view of user agents makes it much easier to approach the\n&gt; question of the client side programming model: user agents simply\n&gt; act upon representations received according to their implementation\n&gt; and configuration. There is no &#39;machine user&#39; that somehow\n&gt; interferes with the application state machine received from the\n&gt; server(s).\n\nI suppose it you squint and tilt your head enough there is always a\nhuman user interested in the outcome (so far).\n\nHowever, the humans can be quite far removed from many of the processes\ninvolved in distributed systems.  I once worked on a system where many\nprocesses automatically reported measurements periodically.  These\nreported measurements caused cascades of automated processing,\ninvolving many http requests against other systems.  The end result\nbeing, amongst many other things, a human being alerted if the\nprocesses being monitor needed attention.\n\nSo yes, all of these systems served to alert the human when needed\nbut, there were at least 5 distinct code bases involved.  Each of\nthose was driving a hypertext application (per measurement) that was\nsomewhat independent of all the others.  These systems where all quite\nseparate from one another, both architecturally and physically.\n\nIn your mental model they would all comprise a single user agent.\nThere would be not way to really separate out the piece because that\nwas the only (potential) human interaction in the mix.  To me, that is\nseems too big to lump together as a single user agent.\n\nI tend to think of a user agent at the bit of software that allows the\nentity with a goal to communication with the server.  The functionally\nprovided by a user agent (for a web based system) would be an http\nprotocol implementation (hopefully including all the niceties like\ntransfer encoding, caching, etc), representation\nserialization/deserialization and an interface that the entity with a\ngoal can use to pursue that goal.\n\nObviously, in this model the goal seeking entity could be human or a\nbit of software.\n\nPeter\n&lt;http://barelyenough.org&gt;\n\n"}}
