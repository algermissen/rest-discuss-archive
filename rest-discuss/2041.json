I was hoping you&#39;d say something cool like\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.mysite.org::DELETE/paper/N10243\n&gt; \n&gt; given this, then, it&#39;s safe to say that whether you want to use REST or\n&gt; XMLRPC, you /still/ need new and custom client software?   Ouch, that\n&gt; makes REST an even harder sell because the SOAP tools exist.\n\nYou don&#39;t need PUT and DELETE to do REST. They are just handy and more\ninteroperable than home-grown ways of doing the same thing. If you can\nuse them (i.e. have no software constraints), you should. If not, you\ncan survive without them.\n\nMy personal opinion is that if they are really important to your app\nthen you should probably consider all of WebDAV and have support for\nWebDAV clients.\n-- \nXML, Web Services Architecture, REST Architectural Style\nConsulting, training, programming: http://www.constantrevolution.com\nCome discuss XML and REST web services at the Extreme Markup Conference\n\n"}}
