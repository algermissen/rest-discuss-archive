Bowman wrote:\n&gt; So yes, a REST API must rely on media types to determine the semantics\n&gt; of protocol methods.  Using HTTP DELETE on a resource represented only\n&gt; as text/html isn&#39;t RESTful now, but it may become so once HTML 5 has\n&gt; added (hopefully at least) PUT and DELETE into the text/html realm, at\n&gt; which point they can be hypertext-driven. The other solution is to use\n&gt; FTP DELETE, since that protocol doesn&#39;t care about media type and won&#39;t\n&gt; allow collection-delete.  But this only works if you&#39;re following the\n&gt; filesystem paradigm and don&#39;t care about the hypertext constraint.\nI think that even with the &quot;hypertext constraint&quot;, there needs to be a \nnotion of pure-data leaf nodes in the hypertext tree, and you need to be \nable to operate on those as well.  The way we do that is to have the \nserver provide implicit semantics - standardized methods for resources \nthat don&#39;t provide their own semantics.  It strikes me as inefficient \nand unnecessarily revisionist to force every &quot;dumb&quot; media type to be \nwrapped and manipulated through a hypertext proxy resource. \n\n-rg\n\n\n"}}
