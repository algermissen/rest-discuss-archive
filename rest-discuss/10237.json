There is now a generally-accepted \n&gt; practice of specifying a link to  available feeds from within \n&gt; an html document, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;RSS Feed&quot;\n&gt; href=&quot;http://example.com/feed.rss&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Atom Feed&quot;\n&gt; href=&quot;http://example.com/feed.atom&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of this, browsers such as IE7 and FF2 have a general \n&gt; implementation for Feed Discovery. No site-specific logic is required.\n&gt; \n&gt; My hope is to stimulate discussion and potentially start \n&gt; building some consensus to proceed forward. I&#39;m certainly not \n&gt; trying to be a barrier to progress :-)\n\nWhenever you and I start discussing things I come to the conclusion that we\nhave very similar ideas we just initially present them in different ways.\n\nSo as I think we are really in-sync, what I&#39;m suggesting is that add weight\nto URI Templates by supporting them in your domain-service-discovery\nproposal instead of trying to say is steering clear of anything other than\nURIs served in their complete form.  After all, Atom/RSS didn&#39;t start out\nwith browser-based implementation; that only came after a groundswell of\nsupport for RSS and Atom. Besides URI Templates is hardly a risky bet given\nhow well-respected the people who are working on it are, and as far as I\nknow there hasn&#39;t been anyone who has challenged URI Templates as a bad\nidea.  The only real debate on URI Templates has been nitpicking\nimplementation (me being one of the nitpickers.) \n\nThat said, why not add URI Templates to your domain-service-discovery\nproposal?  Support for URI Templates will likely gain you support for DSD\nfrom the URI Template camp as well.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
