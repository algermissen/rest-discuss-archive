That&#39;s why I think it is orthogonal. Between your *original*\n&gt; GET and your PUT someone could have twiddled the data.\n\nThe point is that HTTP does not promise to be\n&quot;Reliable&quot;  Your spec does.\n\n&gt; &gt; Even if the server is issuing message-ids and only\n&gt; &gt; processes RPOSTS in order of message-ids:\n&gt; &gt; a. Nothing in the spec says that clients have to\n&gt; &gt; use message-id&#39;s in the order in which they were\n&gt; &gt; issued.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are we talking about multiple clients or a single client? If a single\n&gt; client then the single client can sychronize its own messages! Why\n&gt; should the server worry about that?\n\nEven if with a single client.  The server is not\nguaranteeing to process messages in any order at\nall!\n\nAssuming the server issues sortable message ids,\nand the client sends them in order.  How should\nthe server handle recieving:\n\n  RPOST 4 Jane\n  RPOST 2 Tarzan\n  RPOST 3 You\n  RPOST 1 Me\n\n&gt; If we&#39;re talking about multiple clients, then the service should be\n&gt; implemented so that order doesn&#39;t matter. If syncronization is important\n&gt; then I guess we need some kind of &quot;lock&quot; resources to keep clients in\n&gt; order. I can&#39;t think of an application of this off the top of my head.\n\nThis is a chat application.  The Posts append\nmessages to a chat window.  The user is typing:\n\n  Me Submit\n  Tarzan Submit\n  You Submit\n  Jane Submit\n\nYou need to handle order in a reliable protocol.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; 1. clients should issue their own message-ids.  If\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t want to get stepped on, they should\n&gt; &gt; make them sufficiently unique (and secret).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not happy trusting the clients not to step on each other.\n\nMessage Ids and passwords are no different.  As\nlong as you don&#39;t leak message-ids among clients\nyou are safe.  A client that wants security just\nissues a sufficiently random message-id.  (You\ntrust clients to be safe with their passwords\ntoo).\n\n&gt; &gt; 2. reliable messaging looks like repeat requests\n&gt;\n&gt; To the server application it should not. The reliable messaging\n&gt; infrastructure (i.e. part of the web application framework) should merge\n&gt; them.\n\nYes.  I agree.  This was just shorthand.\n\n&gt; &gt; 3. you may want to support a seriality protocol in\n&gt; &gt; which clients send a cardinality header (I haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; decided if this should really be an ordinality\n&gt; &gt; header, leaving the cardinality header for the\n&gt; &gt; transaction protocols).\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand why the server is responsible for the client keeping\n&gt; its ducks in a row and I don&#39;t think that the clients should trust the\n&gt; server to verify the semantics of an &quot;optional&quot; header. Many servers\n&gt; could just let this pass quietly.\n\nSee above re &quot;Me Tarzan, You Jane&quot;\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
