I\n&gt; have ( as have others in the Jabber community ) wondered about Jabbers&#39;\n&gt; place in the REST world.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jabber appears to have some of the key components for REST with URIs and\n&gt;  a few of the RESTian verbs.\n\nI haven&#39;t looked at the Jabber protocol in any detail in quite some\ntime, but REST is an architectural style that is extremely constraining.\nA system doesn&#39;t &quot;conform&quot; to REST&#39;s constraints by accident, it has to\nbe intentionally designed to do so.\n\nJabber, like pretty much every other system out there, can be engulfed\nby the Web, in the same way that FTP and email/SMTP were absorbed; by\nconstraining interactions with that system to uniform interface\nsemantics, and mapping the space of identifiable things in that system\ninto URI space (often requiring a new URI scheme).\n\n&gt; Is it actually necessary for a toolset to implement all features of\n&gt; REST, or would the REST community be willing to endorse toolsets to a\n&gt; level of REST support?\n\nI&#39;m not sure what that means (&quot;level of REST support&quot;).  Do you have an\nexample?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.  Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.   http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n   Will distribute objects for food\n\n"}}
