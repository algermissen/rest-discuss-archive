The client can then ask that \n&gt; coordinator resource do manage changes across those other resources \n&gt; atomically or in whatever manner makes sense for the application. As far \n&gt; as the client is concerned, it is not aware of any distributed \n&gt; transaction protocol. Most attempts at transactions over HTTP mistakenly \n&gt; try to make the client get involved in a stateful protocol over HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can of course, propose a few link relations if you think it helps \n&gt; clients discover those links. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t help but ask how many applications are going to rely on a \n&gt; distributed transactions based on pessimistic locking over the web. Is \n&gt; this just a solution looking for a problem? \n&gt; \n\nI think most would want to design towards a compensation model for \ntransactions (is this what you mean by &quot;saga&quot; Bob?) rather than a 2pc \nbased one even in non-RESTful distributed applications.  Still, we do \nhave customers that want distributed 2pc.  (Whether they actually *need* \nit or not is another story, but you can&#39;t always argue with a customer \nand more importantly, a potential customer.)  You don&#39;t think \nresource-oriented model is preferrable even if 2pc is required?\n\nWith my original post, I wasn&#39;t looking for somebody to tell me whether \nor not transactions belong in REST.  I&#39;ve already heard the arguments \nover and over again, and I already know what the answer is going to be \nfrom people like Roy and yourself.  I&#39;m more interested in feedback on \nthe API Michael Musgrave for JBoss&#39;s Transaction Manager.  I want to see \nit revised and reworked for a compensation model as well.  Then finally \nI&#39;d like to sow the seeds to put together some RFC together for it.  It \njust seems to me there is a lot of opportunity to take a new look at \nthese older standards through resource-oriented glasses.\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
