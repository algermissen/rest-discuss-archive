My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; .... But, =\r\nconsider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;3=\r\n33&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=3D&quot;http://example.com/orders/333/ca=\r\nncelled&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, I have a CANCEL link that if I=\r\n follow changes the state of my\n&gt; &gt; resource. Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now th=\r\nat I&#39;ve embedded it as a link.\n&gt; &gt; Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelle=\r\nd isn&#39;t very RESTful by itself,\n&gt; &gt; but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The precise value of a URI is not, in and of itself, &quot;RESTful or not\n&gt; =\r\nRESTful&quot; ... it is about how your overall architecture matches up to\n&gt; the =\r\nREST architectural patterns.  In the case at hand, how does your\n&gt; client k=\r\nnow wha URI to use for canceling an order?  If it&#39;s discovered\n&gt; (as you de=\r\nscribe here with a &lt;link&gt; -- but a JSON field that said {\n&gt; ... &quot;cancel&quot; : =\r\n&quot;/orders/333/cancelled&quot; ... } is semantically\n&gt; equivalent, so the syntax i=\r\nsn&#39; the important bit -- and you do a POST\n&gt; to it for a state change, you =\r\ncan certainly claim this is a RESTful\n&gt; approach.  If you just do the POST =\r\npart but make the client do a\n&gt; string concatenation (&quot;/orders&quot; + orderId +=\r\n &quot;/cancelled&quot;), well not\n&gt; quite so much ... but that&#39;s still a *lot* bette=\r\nr than cancelling an\n&gt; order with a GET :-).\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; &gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; &gt; http://bill.burkecentral.=\r\ncom\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\nI would post a resource collection that represents canceled =\r\norders in the application, such that when a GET is done against this resour=\r\nce, I get all canceled orders.\n\nAs far as all the other constraints are adh=\r\nered too, this would seem RESTful in my opinion.  For example the original =\r\nGET on the order would have a link to the &quot;canceled&quot; order resource.\n\nEb\n\n\n"}}
