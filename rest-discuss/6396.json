Multiple representations\n&gt; What if we want the resource to appear inside an edit form, \n&gt; instead of having an edit form as part of the resource or \n&gt; linked to the resource.  \nI think that&#39;s the same as my 3) Other Resources - in your example the\nserver would include the content of the first resource within a &lt;textarea&gt;.\n\nI was going to provide an example where the resource was an image, to make\nit harder to use that resource directly for editing. But I didn&#39;t have time,\nmy burgers were smoking on the grill...\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m actually using this format:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://example.com/resource;view=edit\n&gt; \n&gt; This URL is another representation of the URI http://example.com/resource \nAlso, it&#39;s more than just another representation, it&#39;s another resource. How\nis the view=edit resource discovered? (I think that&#39;s part of the original\nquestion).\n\n&gt; with the content of the page in a &lt;textarea&gt;.  \n&gt; It is access-controlled via HTTP AUTH, /resource is not.  \n&gt; The PUT goes to /resource upon form submission.\n\n\n\n"}}
