The mime type can be\n&gt; something else if it&#39;s a better choice.\n\nI generally prefer `application/x-www-urlencoded`; in this\nexample, that would make the entity `active=1` or `active=0`.\n\n&gt; Doing PUT sending &quot;activated&quot;/&quot;deactivated&quot; works with other\n&gt; applications but the semantics of PUT is underspecified (for\n&gt; this case).\n\nNo, they’re not: they depend on the hypermedia format that\ncontained the link which the client is using to PUT.\n\n&gt; overloading PUT will require a link in the hypermedia (or in a\n&gt; Link header) of &quot;/users/1234&quot; to tell the user that a\n&gt; transition to a active/inactive state is possible (i.e. inform\n&gt; that the user can call &quot;PUT /users/1234/status&quot;)\n\nYou say that as if it’s bad thing. Hypermedia is the cornerstone\nof REST.\n\nAnd what’s with this FUD about overloading PUT? This use of PUT\ndoesn’t deviate from PUT’s meaning in the uniform interface *at\nall*: the client is sending a representation of the desired new\nstate of a resource to the server. Just because the resource has\na particular meaning in this application does not mean this is\nsomething other than a PUT. There is no overloading going on.\n\nREST is not CRUD (nor, of course, RPC). It’s the representations\nthat carry meaning; methods are generic state-change operators\nand no more.\n\n&gt; but then the semantics is unclear because the server rely on\n&gt; the entity to distinguish between each state\n\nI see nothing unclear about that at all.\n\n&gt; and it&#39;s tricky to tell the user that one entity is fine while\n&gt; the other isn&#39;t, other than the user trying and getting an\n&gt; error. Of course the agent can inspect the representation\n&gt; returned from &quot;GET /users/1234&quot; and see that the current state\n&gt; is &quot;inactive&quot; and infer that &quot;PUT /users/status/1234&quot; should\n&gt; have a entity &quot;active&quot;.\n\nSo to recap:\n\n• In one case I have to send an OPTIONS request to the resource\n  and then check whether the Accept header contains ACTIVATE or\n  DEACTIVATE, so that I can use the right method to change the\n  state.\n\n• In the other case I have to send a GET request to the resource\n  and then check the representation to see whether it contains\n  `active=0` or `active=1`, so that I can PUT the right entity\n  to change the state.\n\nAnd you are saying the former is less tricky than the latter?\n\nIf you ask me, it’s the other way around.\n\n&gt; Also it&#39;s important to not be seduced by the extension method\n&gt; approach (i.e. define your own method instead of overloading\n&gt; the existing ones) because without much thought it ends up with\n&gt; many new methods that won&#39;t work on more than a couple of\n&gt; resources and severely reduce the number of applications that\n&gt; can interact with yours. The atom spec is a good example on how\n&gt; using just the basic HTTP methods with a good mime type can go\n&gt; a long way.\n\nNow that I can wholeheartedly agree with.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
