For example, can I even use PUT correctly here?   \n&gt; Modifying a property (say, the name property) is actually modifying  \n&gt; the customer resource itself.  Maybe it updates a timestamp property  \n&gt; or version property on the customer resource automatically.  Does  \n&gt; this mean that we now have to fall back to POST instead of PUT?  I&#39;m  \n&gt; not sure.\n\nIt seems perfectly fine to me to modify a resource via PUT (or POST),  \nand have another resource get updated as a side effect. While this  \nreduces visibility (e.g. in terms of cache invalidation), and the two  \nresources have to be under the control of the same server for this to  \nwork, I don&#39;t see a way around this in practice.\n\nSo I think it&#39;s unusual at all to to PUT new data to /customer/123/ \naddress and find the time stamp returned as part of a GET on /customer/ \n123 has changed.\n\nIn fact this is what happens when you update a file in a directory,  \nand data contained in the directly listing (such as the file&#39;s time  \nstamp) changes.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n"}}
