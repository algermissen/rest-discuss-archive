Message self-\n&gt; &gt; descriptiveness is an\n&gt; &gt; architectural constraint of REST and thus, if your messages are not\n&gt; &gt; self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; (aka standardized all the way through) your system does not comply\n&gt; &gt; with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I strongly disagree with this assertion. I don&#39;t have a link to Mark&#39;s\n&gt; article where he makes a claim that &quot;self-descriptive&quot; means\n&gt; &quot;standardized&quot; so I can&#39;t really refute it. But I do refute the\n&gt; assertion.\n\nWell, so do I.  Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and\nthe registry points to a specification and the specification explains\nhow to process the data according to its intent.  The specification does\nnot need to be a standard (a.k.a., a measure that everyone agrees to).\nIt would help, but most useful standards are defined through use.\nWhoever starts sending the data first should define the specification\naccording to what is being sent, not try to get everyone to agree first.\n\nMy question about the API was one of practicality.  Given a space that\nhas been extensively explored, why do people choose to abandon the\navailable standards?  And the answer was the one I was expecting: the\nstandards are too complex and it seemed better to start with something\nsimple that is a better fit for the immediate need.  There is absolutely\nnothing wrong with that choice when it is made with eyes wide open.\nYou never know what will become the next HTML.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
