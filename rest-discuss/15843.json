Around here, you go\n&gt;&gt; to a single kiosk, tell the=\r\nm what you want, they give you the form or\n&gt;&gt; forms and redirect you to the=\r\n proper station. As a DMV user, you only\n&gt;&gt; need to know how to fill out th=\r\ne forms properly, and how to hit the\n&gt;&gt; kiosk. The internal mapping of reso=\r\nurces (clerks, capabilities, etc.)\n&gt;&gt; is handled by the DMV, and they guide=\r\n you through the process (Now\n&gt;&gt; serving 123, please go to window 4).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n What you can&#39;t do at the DMV is walk straight up to Sally at window 3\n&gt;&gt; w=\r\nhen you come back, just because you worked with her last time (you\n&gt;&gt; cache=\r\nd her URI).
