Rather, you should be exposing only\nrelationships that are worthy to be considered as a resource in your\nparticular context.\n\nFor example, it is OK to have a MEMBERSHIP resource which allows\nconsumer to manipulate MEMBERSHIP relationship. However, it may or may\nnot be appropriate to expose an ADDRESS resource which allows consumer\nto manipulate a user&#39;s address. Instead, you could manipulate the\naddress through the USER resource.\n\nREST is resource-centric. What a resource is depends on the\ncontext on hand. There is no always nor never.\n\n&gt; Some minor questions:\n&gt; If yes: what&#39;s with a shopping cart and products in it. What would\n&gt; that aggregating representation be named?\n\nThe shopping cart.\n\nBear in mind that the shopping cart is already a name for the\nrelationship between goods the store has and goods you want to buy.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
