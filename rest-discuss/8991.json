Fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Consuming a message from the queue, though, seems problematic.\n&gt; &gt; They allow either GET or DELETE on the *same* URL to pop a message\n&gt; &gt; from the queue.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that (possibly timing issues when two \n&gt; clients\n&gt; consume the same item).\n&gt; \n&gt; GET to find out the queue entry.\n&gt; DELETE to remove it (being processed).\n\nThat&#39;s not what their API does...\n\n&gt; Is it &#39;wrong&#39; to use two verbs on the same resource?\n&gt; If so why?\n\nIt&#39;s certainly wrong if one of them is GET and it&#39;s neither safe nor\nidempotent.\n\n&gt; DELETE on a queue perhaps should delete the whole queue.\n\nExactly. They use DELETE on the queue URL to fetch and delete an\nunspecified child resource, not the whole queue.  Worse, they allow\nGET for the same operation, so GET and DELETE are equivalent.\n\nI don&#39;t see a single-request solution except to use POST or maybe PUT,\nand then it smells more like some flavor of POX or RPC.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
