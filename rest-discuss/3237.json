There&#39;s no denying the value in that.\n\nI figure it&#39;s one of those things with an upside and a downside.  The\nupside is the serendipity.  The downside is serendipity.  8-)  What I\nmean is that as a consumer of a URI, it&#39;s awesome to be able to get\nmore info and use it in unexpected ways.  But on the other hand, for\nthe URI publisher, you can&#39;t know what information people or software\nmay be extracting from your URI, and that ties your hands somewhat with\nrespect to how your URI space can evolve.\n\nI used to think the problems with the latter outweighed the benefits\nof the former, but I think it&#39;s the other way around now after seeing\nit in action.  At least the publisher has the option of obfuscating\ntheir URIs if they don&#39;t want to have to worry about it.\n\nBTW, the RESTwiki&#39;s down due to a machine swap.  I&#39;ll have to fix it\nthis weekend.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\nWeb architecture consulting, technical reports, evaluation & analysis\n\n"}}
