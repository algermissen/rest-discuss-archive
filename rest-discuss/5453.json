Such constraints\n&gt; are\n&gt; part of the business rules, but they are not all of the business rules.\n&gt;\n&gt; To bring this back to the original example, there may be a business rule\n&gt; that says\n&gt; &quot;A customer may not order widgets of more than $100 value unless he is a\n&gt; valued\n&gt; (repeat) customer&quot;. This would be difficult to implement using database\n&gt; integrity constraints alone and I content it would also be difficult to\n&gt; apply to a\n&gt; PUT resource state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, consider what happens if the customer replaces (PUTs) an existing\n&gt; order with a\n&gt; new version that contains different widgets. The new order may be \n&gt; perfectly\n&gt; valid but\n&gt; what if the original widgets have already been shipped.\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t get why PUT is more &quot;dangerous&quot; than POST. Surely the difference \nbetween a POST and a PUT request is purely one of semantics and has no \naffect on the processing the server can do. I can&#39;t see how in your \nexample the server would have any more problems constraining a client \nPUTting a new customer order over one POSTing one, after all the only \ndifference is the word PUT rather than POST in the HTTP request, the \nsame server logic can apply to both.\n\nPaul.\n\n\n"}}
