The values in the set may be resource\n&gt; representations and/or resource identifiers.\n\nThat&#39;s my definition for a resource within a REST-based information\nsystem.  That is because such a system creates an interface that\ncauses that mapping to be the only observable definition of a resource.\nWhat the resource actually *is*, within a larger scope, is a different\ntopic.\n\n&gt; This leads me to a conclusion I don&#39;t like: Two resources that are\n&gt; owl:sameAs must respond to the same requests at the same time with the\n&gt; same representations, because the resource *is* the membership\n&gt; function.\n\nThat depends on what you mean by &quot;is&quot;.  ;-)\n\n&gt; Something smells wrong to me.\n\nContext.\n\n&gt; Roy says that &quot;a non-virtual object (e.g. a person)&quot; can be a\n&gt; resource. How is a person a membership function? I tried to\n&gt; rationalize this by saying that the words &quot;entity&quot; and &quot;value&quot; in the\n&gt; definition referred to the person to which the membership function\n&gt; mapped, but the very next sentence of the definition limits the values\n&gt; to &quot;representations and/or identifiers&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; What am I missing?\n\nWhen you watch a movie on TV, are you watching photons, characters,\nor people playing the roles of characters?  When someone makes a\nstatement about something they see on TV, do they identify the\nphotons, the characters, or the actors playing those characters?\nMost of the time, they try to clarify the ambiguity by setting the\ncontext -- by referring to the actor by their real name (or pseudonym)\nas opposed to the character&#39;s name, or by clarifying the context\nvia some other part of the statement.\n\nSo, in my disseration I was trying to describe both the set of things\nthat have been named (resources) and the extent to which those named\nthings can be represented within an information system (the mapping).\nIt is a bit confusing because I edited it too many times.\n\nMy definition of resource in general is in rfc2396bis.\n\n  http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#overview\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
