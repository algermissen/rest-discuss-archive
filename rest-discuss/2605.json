Strictly\n&gt; &gt; speaking, I started\n&gt; &gt; off with &quot;local&quot; relational database technologies.  But \n&gt; over the years I\n&gt; &gt; have broadened my conceptual view of databases to be any group of\n&gt; &gt; resources\n&gt; &gt; that are retrievable by an identifier.  This could be a key value\n&gt; &gt; in a RDBMS\n&gt; &gt; table or an HTTP URL on the web.  It&#39;s all the same to me...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To me there are four basic operations (verbs) that can \n&gt; occur against a\n&gt; &gt; database:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ADD    (e.g. SQL INSERT)\n&gt; &gt; EDIT    (e.g. SQL UPDATE)\n&gt; &gt; DELETE (e.g. SQL DELETE)\n&gt; &gt; GET    (e.g. SQL SELECT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Until working with REST, I had still conceptualized the above\n&gt; &gt; verbs as doing\n&gt; &gt; physical things to the resources themselves.  The identifiers were\n&gt; &gt; second-hand citizens to the data, being nothing more than a \n&gt; convenient way\n&gt; &gt; to access a resource.  However, as I begin to understand REST\n&gt; &gt; more and more,\n&gt; &gt; I have started seeing these verbs in a different light.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instead of verbs that act on a resource, I see them as \n&gt; verbs that act on\n&gt; &gt; whatever the identifier is mapped to (which we tend to \n&gt; conceptualize as a\n&gt; &gt; resource).  When I say ADD, what I would have been saying in the\n&gt; &gt; past (from\n&gt; &gt; my rdbms pov):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Take this data and make a record/resource which is\n&gt; &gt; identifiable by it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; key.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now I would say:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Take the key and map the data to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Likewise, EDIT would be the same:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Take the key and update the data that is mapped to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DELETE would be:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Take the key and remove the mapping to the data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GET would be:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Take the key and return the data that is mapped to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In RDBMS, these are still perfectly valid statements, if \n&gt; not a bit &quot;oddly\n&gt; &gt; worded&quot;.  When I turn around and look at URIs and Resources (as\n&gt; &gt; discussed on\n&gt; &gt; this list), it still makes perfect sense to use the above verbs.\n&gt; &gt; The URI is\n&gt; &gt; the key and the Resource is the data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you want to map them to HTTP verbs, you might end up with\n&gt; &gt; something like\n&gt; &gt; the following:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ADD -&gt; POST\n&gt; &gt; EDIT -&gt; PUT\n&gt; &gt; DELETE -&gt; DELETE\n&gt; &gt; GET -&gt; GET\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, these are not perfect matches.  As we know, POST can\n&gt; &gt; do more than\n&gt; &gt; just create a new URI&lt;-&gt;Resource mapping.  We also know \n&gt; that PUT do more\n&gt; &gt; than just an EDIT.  At the same time, EDIT in RDBMS systems\n&gt; &gt; allows a partial\n&gt; &gt; edit, which PUT does not (put any arguments to this statement in\n&gt; &gt; a different\n&gt; &gt; thread, please). DELETE and GET are about the only things that\n&gt; &gt; actually work\n&gt; &gt; more or less the same.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So does this mean that the ADD, EDIT, DELETE, GET model is \n&gt; wrong?  I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; think so.  I think that the HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE, GET \n&gt; model is ambiguous\n&gt; &gt; and could be improved to adopt the other model.  This is \n&gt; where CREATE came\n&gt; &gt; in.  In this case, CREATE is identical to ADD.  So, suppose \n&gt; we had this\n&gt; &gt; model instead:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ADD -&gt; CREATE\n&gt; &gt; EDIT -&gt; PUT\n&gt; &gt; DELETE -&gt; DELETE\n&gt; &gt; GET -&gt; GET\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, we are a bit closer.  But this leaves out POST.  Sort of.\n&gt; &gt; POST can be\n&gt; &gt; used for all sorts of things.  However, if we were to relax PUTs\n&gt; &gt; course-grained update requirements, POST would not have to be\n&gt; &gt; used for that.\n&gt; &gt; Since CREATE is dedicated to the creation of the \n&gt; URI&lt;-&gt;Resource mappings,\n&gt; &gt; POST would not have to be used for that either.  In the \n&gt; end, POST becomes\n&gt; &gt; nothing more than a generic RPC mechanism.  Interestingly, some\n&gt; &gt; SQL servers\n&gt; &gt; actually have the same thing:  EXEC.  When you need to \n&gt; submit data to a\n&gt; &gt; server and there is no visible side effect (i.e. none of \n&gt; the four other\n&gt; &gt; verbs are happening), that&#39;s when you use POST.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, let&#39;s add one more verb to the mix:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ADD -&gt; CREATE\n&gt; &gt; EDIT -&gt; PUT\n&gt; &gt; DELETE -&gt; DELETE\n&gt; &gt; GET -&gt; GET\n&gt; &gt; EXEC -&gt; POST\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the end, I see this as a cleaner, less ambiguous set of \n&gt; verbs than the\n&gt; &gt; current HTTP verbs.  I am sure you will disagree with me.  \n&gt; :)  But that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; fine.  There are certainly questions that need answering \n&gt; such as how these\n&gt; &gt; new (variations) verbs deal with &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;idempotency&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; caching, etc.  But\n&gt; &gt; I would be willing to tackle those issues if I knew that \n&gt; there were others\n&gt; &gt; that saw this as I did (or at least were open to the \n&gt; possibility).  :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
