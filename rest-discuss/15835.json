I do understand the benefits (decoupled clients) from this approach but the downside for me is that the client needs to discover the links each time it tries access something\n\nYes - and no :-)\n\nYes, it will usually be guided by the server through the specific states that constitute a given application, for example orderig a book. The client usually discovers the URI to submit the order to at runtime. We all do things like this every day on the Web.\n\nIn the general case there is no significant overhead created by this approach because the client needs to take most of the steps anyhow (you sure want to check the current price and availability before you place your order, so remembering the submission target URI is not really what you want).\n\n....\n\nWhile the user is stepping through an application the user often discovers other resources that are suitable entry points (e.g. a product page, a search result, the histry of a trouble ticket). The URIs of those resource should be bookmarkable (cool URIs) for later re-use. We all do this every day on the Web when we bookmark something that we assume makes a good point for re-entering the application at some later point in time.\n\nApplications can have (very) many entry URIs, there is no implied limit to a single one. However, clients only need to know one of them to enter the application.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; i.e given the following hierarchy of resources:\n&gt; \n&gt; /collection1\n&gt; collection1\n&gt;  |-sub1\n&gt;    |-sub1sub1\n&gt; \t|-sub1sub1sub1\n&gt;        \t|-sub1sub1sub1sub1\n&gt;    |-sub1sub2\n&gt;  |-sub2\n&gt;    |-sub2sub1\n&gt;    |-sub2sub2\n&gt;  |-sub3\n&gt;    |-sub3sub1\n&gt;    |-sub3sub2\n&gt; \n&gt; If we follow the &quot;Client only need to know the root URI&quot; approach, then a client shall only be aware of the root URI i.e. /collection1 above and the rest of URIs should be discovered by the clients through hypermedia links. I find this cumbersome because each time a client needs to do a GET, say on sub1sub1sub1sub1, should the client first do a GET on /collection1 and the follow link defined in the returned representation and then do several more GETs on sub resources to reach the desired resource? or is my understanding about connectedness completely wrong?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Suresh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
