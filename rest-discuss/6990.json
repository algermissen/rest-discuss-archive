All safe operations are also idempotent, but not all\n&gt;  &gt; idempotent operations are safe (PUT, DELETE).\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought PUT was idempotent for one UA only. Two UAs introduce a race\n&gt; condition on PUT order, unless clients agree to synchronize, or servers\n&gt; force them to (as is the case with subversion/dav).\n\nI think distinguishing the fact that two distinct requests come from the \nsame UA or from two distinct UAs breaks the principle of stateless \ninteractions. The way I understand REST, the server should never have to \nknow whether-or-not two requests come from the same UA.\nThe point you raise is certainly related to Section 9.1.2 of RFC 2616, \nin particular to this sentence: &quot;However, it is possible that a sequence \nof several requests is non-idempotent, even if all of the methods \nexecuted in that sequence are idempotent.&quot;\nHowever, I think one of the main point about idempotent methods is to be \nmore robust to network failures which would cause the duplication of a \nsingle request. I don&#39;t think it is meant to deal with the problems due \nto concurrent, distinct requests. Using an &quot;If-modified-since&quot; header in \na PUT request, for example, would probably help solve some concurrency \nissues.\n\nCheers,\n\nBruno.\n\n\n\n"}}
