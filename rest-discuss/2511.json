Its use of URIs seems\nquite\n&gt; &gt; sensible (i.e., having a calendar or group of events identifiable as a\n&gt; &gt; URI), except for the one problem with the new scheme, as noted to the\nURI\n&gt; &gt; list.\n&gt;\n&gt; is this scheme documented somewhere, or did you just see it in the\ntraces?\n&gt; Where does it appear?\n&gt;\n&gt; Julian\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; &lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
