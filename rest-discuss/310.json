Consider Plan 9:  its networking mechanism presents a\nset of services which look like files:  they can be opened, read, written to\netc. to communicate with the services in question.  For e.g. name resolution,\nthe client opens a file (something like) /net/cs (i.e., &quot;connection server&quot; is\nreified as a &quot;file&quot;) writes a string like &quot;www.foo.com&quot;, then reads the file\ncontents back to receive something like &quot;209.224.18.5&quot;.  That is *just like*\nwhat you&#39;re describing above, with the exception that you&#39;re only passing a\nsingle parameter.  (Other Plan 9 services accept multiple &quot;parameters&quot; in this\nfashion.)\n\n&gt; As I said before, sometimes you want something\n&gt; other than HTTP.  Sometimes you want something\n&gt; other than REST.\n\nThis is really getting old, Alex.  Sigh.  Mark, let me say now how very sorry\nI am for having put you through this, now that I see how it looks from the\nother side of the fence.  ;-)\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
