RosettaNet is a great standard... the apotheosis of this\n&gt; &gt; style of exchanging full documents. My point is that style is not\n&gt; &gt; scalable, and that APP is using the same approach, on a smaller scale.\n&gt;\n&gt; All the business processing standards I&#39;ve seen are inherently\n&gt; non-scalable, if by non-scalable you mean the number of actors that can\n&gt; share information without resorting to effort in out of band agreements.\n\nYes, that&#39;s what I mean.\n\n&gt; That XForms has a means of exception management (show it to a person)\n&gt; and does schema validation in advance via constraints instead of\n&gt; defensive programming doesn&#39;t have me thinking it&#39;s any more applicable\n&gt; or valuable than using Atom - indeed it has me thinking it&#39;s going to be\n&gt; riddled with security holes because to honor an xform constraint you\n&gt; need a trustworthy client.\n\nI am wide open to suggestions that Xforms may not be up to the task. I\nsuggested Xfroms because there is a spec for it, and since it&#39;s all\nabout XML, you can make a small leap and declare that the Relax NG and\nthe RFC define the meanings of elements. So you can sidestep opening\nthe semantic web discussion.\n\nConstraints just emulate what an HTML form indicates to humans: The\nHTML form puts one line for authors, not 10, so the browser cannot\npossibly accept more than a single author to submit to the server.\n\n[Side note about exceptions: even in a big machine to machine system,\nexceptional conditions usually have to percolate their way back to a\nhuman for handling. It may just be an error log, and the solution may\nbe... Dang, our purchasing agent/blog syndicator/whatever needs to\nunderstand this new term the server at XYZ.com is demanding. ]\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In the general case this a symbolic AI problem. If you want to move\n&gt; further along, the applicable state of the art here are denotational\n&gt; semantics as used in KR, RDF interchange, or agent based systems like\n&gt; FIPA. No-one seems to be sure how to design such things in a way that\n&gt; they garner wide adoption on existing infrastructure.\n&gt;\n\nYeah, well I was hoping this discussion would begin the thinking about\n&quot;wide adoption on existing infrastructure&quot;.  Because if Xforms isn&#39;t\nup to it, or if RDF forms cannot be brought along far enough, to\nhandle a simple little web service like APP, then we&#39;ll never see web\nservices adopted as broadly as the web -- which the purpose of a lot\nof discussion on this list.\n\nMy thinking is that APP is bite-sized enough to where some small\nunambitious forms language could lead the way... &quot;microforms&quot;. I don&#39;t\nthink it&#39;s going to take an Apollo project and a bunch of egghead\nprofessors to start this work... just another little  brushfire of\nweb innovation.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
