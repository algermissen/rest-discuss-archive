I have that with the ex=\r\nception of having an authenticated session.  Nothing is stored in the sessi=\r\non except for the user&#39;s &quot;Subject&quot; which knows whether or not it is authent=\r\nicated and who it is authenticated as.  \n\nBut I want to get all the way to =\r\nhaving no session, but that means I have to authenticate with every request=\r\n.  My mobile clients have no trouble doing this.  (In fact, they do it alre=\r\nady.)  However, this seems to be rather tricky from a browser.  \n\nIf the EN=\r\nTIRE application was in one web page, then you could just store the credent=\r\nials in memory.  However, if you have to go from one web page to another, i=\r\nt starts to get hairy.\n\nDoes anyone on this list have any best practices fo=\r\nr avoiding having any session in web applications (Human to Machine) requir=\r\ning authentication?\n\n\n"}}
