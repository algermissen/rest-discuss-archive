Fielding wrote:\n\n&gt; I think it is more accurate to say that a resource cannot change\n&gt; its interface as part of an evolution because all resources have\n&gt; the same interface.

Would it then be reasonable to say that a style that constrains the\ninterface (to be uniform) increases evolvabiliy because changes\nresulting from evolution are only visible as data element changes and\nsuch changes are easier to cope with than interface changes?\n\nThat has actually been my thinking over the past years, but admitedly\nI still lack a compelling reasoning why for example an incompatible\ndata element change is less complex than an incopatible inerface change.\n(Hence I though the question of the caller being in a defined state  \nafter\nan evolution induced faulure would be the answer).\n\nOr is it as simple as &quot;the complexity with data elements is inherently\nlower, e.g. because there are never issues like method call sequences or\nbecause it is easier to standardize a data element type than to  \nstandardize\nan interface, etc&quot;)?\nIntuitively I have no problem really, but as said, it is the  \nreasoning that\nI find to be incomplete (in my head).\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; But REST does not\n&gt; require use of a single interface protocol, so in that sense the\n&gt; interface could change dynamically (e.g., HTTP Upgrade).\n\n\n"}}
