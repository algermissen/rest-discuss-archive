But it is in your mind, not Tim&#39;s. The\n&gt; opacity axiom applies to *software*.\n\nSorry, Paul -- the confusion isn&#39;t in my head, it may or may not be in Tim&#39;s\nhead, but it&#39;s certainly in yours.  ;-)  Here&#39;s why:\n\nEvery single browser and probably almost every other sort of Web client on\nthe planet breaks the opacity axiom each and every day.  URI are not opaque;\nthey have semantics.  Without those semantics, relative URI would be\nimpossible.\n\nTo say that URI are opaque indicates both sloppiness of language and\nterminological (or other worse) confusion.  To assert that it is incorrect to\nextract any information from URI, to do anything other than dereference one\n--- is contradictory to a very common use of URI which is spelled out in\ngreat detail in RFC2396 -wrt- relative URI.\n\nSo once we&#39;ve dispelled the delusion that URI are *in fact* and by intent /\ndesign opaque, we can get on with our lives and begin to ask what the\nstructure and semantics of URI names are and how we can enrich those\nsemantics formally, explicitly, usefully.\n\n&gt; Tim was talking about a *human* reading the URI. That&#39;s why he said that\n&gt; it is a &quot;clue&quot;. He&#39;s talking about the Web equivalent to variable naming\n&gt; conventions. As in, you SHOULD use m_ as a member prefix because this\n&gt; will make reading your code simpler. But I would kill you if you sent me\n&gt; a piece of software that depended upon member variables starting with\n&gt; m_. So variable names are opaque, except when they aren&#39;t, in exactly\n&gt; the same way.\n\nInvalid analogy.  URI aren&#39;t variable names in a flat namespace, they are\nsemi-hierarchical names in a structured namespace.  Consider:  every piece of\n*Web server software* on the planet builds log files.  These log files are\noften named and managed in a hierarchical log space, with log file names\nconstructed generatively according to some rules or grammar.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
