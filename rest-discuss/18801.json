i am \na bit concerned to see expected media types encoded in link relations, \nfor example i&#39;d prefer to see a &quot;contact&quot; link type and then getting a \nvCard or an xCard or HTML-embedded hCard is up to conneg and thus a \nruntime issue. doing it that way frees you from having to mint new link \nrelation types when you want to support new media types (what about FoaF \ncontact info, for example?).\n\n&gt; [walter] maybe i wasn&#39;t clear enough I apologize. I was indeed referring to the &quot;type&quot; attribute/parameter of the &quot;link&quot; element/header, which is already defined both in RFC5988 and in XRD for referencing the media-type associated with that link. In that sense an hcard link rel would typically be &quot;text/html&quot; whilst a poco#me representation of the &quot;profile&quot; link could be &quot;application/json&quot;.\n\nand that doesn&#39;t really help at all. for it to be helpful, the profile \ndescription language would need to have a media type, and then you could \nidentify it by that. and generally speaking, a &#39;profile&#39; link should not \nneed to be dereferenced to be useful, it&#39;s an identifier. that also \nmeans that designing an environment where runtime lookup of the profile \ndescription is necessary would be a violation of the spec, because \nclients would not be able to &quot;understand&quot; that the meaning of a profile \nURI changes over time. this almost automatically means that any updates \nin the profile need to done by minting a new profile URI, and if it is \ndone backwards compatible, then representations conforming to the new \nprofile should list both profile versions:\n\n&lt;link rel=&quot;profile&quot; href=&quot;http://microformats.org/profile/hcard&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;link rel=&quot;profile&quot; href=&quot;http://microformats.org/profile/hcard/2.0&quot;/&gt;\n\n&gt; However I do understand that this may not be enough for correctly characterizing the format of the specific profile information: how would I indicate in fact that this &quot;profile&quot; link/web page is hcard-enabled or not a priori? Same for json: poco is a popular json format for representing profile info but may not be the only one.\n\nif there is a format for describing profile information, then it should \nhave a media type and then web clients can use that media type. just \nreferring to it as JSON is not very helpful. but even if there was such \na media type, it would not change the fact that the way how &#39;profile&#39; is \ndrafted right now, runtime access to profile descriptions is not part of \nthe design; clients compare supported profile URIs to the profiles they \nfind in a representation, and then decide what to do.\n\n&gt; My point is I may have the following xrd at this stage with the profile rel links:\n&gt; &lt;Link rel=&quot;profile&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/profiles/joe&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;Link rel=&quot;profile&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/profiles/joe/hcard&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;Link rel=&quot;profile&quot; type=&quot;application/json&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/profiles/joe/poco&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; ...without any clear view on which &quot;profile&quot; provides which format.\n&gt; I hope I have clarified my point here and welcome your feedback on this.\n\nnow i am getting the impression that you&#39;re having some misconceptions \nabout profile. profile links are not intended to link to particular \nresource that contains data of interest to the client. in your example, \nthe page would be about joe, and joe might decide to embed his \ninformation using hcard, and then the page would say\n\n&lt;link rel=&quot;profile&quot; href=&quot;http://microformats.org/profile/hcard&quot;/&gt;\n\nand clients could extract joe&#39;s hcard info from the page without ever \naccessing http://microformats.org/profile/hcard; they would simply see \nthat URI and then, if they supported hCard, understand that the page \ncontain embedded hCard information.\n\ni hope that clarifies things a bit. cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
