It isn&#39;t dated, but I&#39;d guess it&#39;s probably from\naround 95/96 when Paul was most active in Web stuff.\n\nI think that IDL is the wrong language in which to create this type of\nmodel, but if I had to use it, my model would probably look a whole lot\nlike that.  The explicit calling out of compound documents is good,\nthough I think he missed the ball on tying it to the model, since he\nseems to be under the impression that there are &quot;presentation\nresources&quot;.  But the seeds are there anyhow.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
