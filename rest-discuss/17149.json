But I am not striving towards a good h2m interface - only an \nacceptable one that will allow a developer of a client to interact with my \nAPI using a standard browser. Nothing fancy.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t expect my perfectly polished end-user website to be used as a \nREST API. But maybe I am wrong here too. It could just be that, assuming I \nam going to develop that end-user website anyway, it would be faster to \nincoorporate m2m details in a fancy end-user website, than developing both a \nend-user website and a REST API on a secondary webserver.\n\nIt would just be so different than my (the?) usual conception of a REST API \nas a stand-alone API decoupled from the end-user website. One typical \ndifference is the access control where the end-user website uses cookies, \nwhereas the REST API uses some of the HTTP authentication chemes. It would \nalso be way to easy to break the API the first time someone puts a new theme \ntemplate on the end-user website. Better to have web designers working on \nthe end-user website and coders to work on the REST API.\n\n/Jørn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Benjamin Hawkes-Lewis&quot; &lt;bhawkeslewis@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jørn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Rest Discussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 28, 2010 7:03 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Combining HTML and XML?\n\n\nOn Tue, Dec 28, 2010 at 11:13 AM, Jørn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This, I think, is mostly about tooling: it is easy to serialize any data\n&gt; structure in XML with most development platforms, but there is no support \n&gt; for\n&gt; easy serialization into and from HTML.\n\nHTML has a document-application vocabulary at its core whereas XML is just a\nsyntax.\n\nHowever, many web frameworks (e.g. Rails, Django) do include &quot;scaffolding&quot; \ncode\nthat represents models as HTML forms.\n\n&gt; Example: I have a case file with a title, a case number and a myriad of \n&gt; other\n&gt; properties. This can easily be converted to XML using standard tools:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;case xmlns=&quot;http://my-casefile-namespace&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;My title&lt;/title&gt; \n&gt; &lt;/case&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But how would the machine readable HTML look like? Maybe:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;div property=&quot;case&quot;&gt; &lt;div property=&quot;title&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\nHopefully, something that makes better use of HTML semantics like:\n\n&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1 property=&quot;case:title&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/h1&gt; ...  &lt;/article&gt;\n\n&gt; So I feel trapped somewhere between these two formats and I guess that is \n&gt; why\n&gt; people turn to their own media-types. Now they get easy tooling and \n&gt; embedded\n&gt; hypermedia controls in XML (which they must invent themselves).\n\nThis sounds like more work for both producers and consumers than just\nserializing to an HTML form.\n\nThose insistent on rolling out domain-specific XML elements, rather than \nusing\nRDFa/microdata/classes to embed the same vocabulary into an HTML user\ninterface, could at least mix in XHTML, XForms, XLink, and WAI-ARIA with\ntheir domain-specific vocabulary rather than reinvent the wheel.\n\n&gt; Can&#39;t we combine and get the best of both worlds?\n&gt;\n&gt; What is needed is something that:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Makes it easy to serialize/deserialize any data (m2m scenario).  - Is\n&gt; browsable with a normal browser (h2m scenario).  - Has hyper media \n&gt; controls.\n&gt; - Can update data through hyper media controls.\n\nIf by &quot;easy&quot; you mean as easy as serializing name-value pairs into an XML\nelement tree, then these goals are in conflict, because magically building a\ngood user interface for h2m is hard to script - indeed such interfaces are \nan\narea of outright competition rather than just standardization! Consequently,\ndevelopers tend to want to customize cookie-cutter user interfaces, \nreplacing\nthe scaffolding erected by web frameworks.\n\n&gt; The HTML form could have RDFa added to it to lessen the coupling between \n&gt; the\n&gt; server and the client, like Eric suggested. Something like:\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;case_title&quot; name=&quot;Case.Title&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;/&gt;\n\nNote this does not work since RDFa takes the content of the RDFa &quot;content&quot;\nattribute or, failing that, the concatenated text nodes of the element as \nthe\nvalue, *not* the &quot;value&quot; property of the &quot;input&quot;, as the value of \n&quot;dc:title&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#sequence\n\nWhat you want to say is that the .value property may or should be a \n&quot;dc:title&quot;,\nbut HTML5 and friends do not currently offer a way to express that.\n\nAdding a way to do this is not easy since &quot;value&quot; might or might not be a\nprovided or valid value.\n\n--\nBenjamin Hawkes-Lewis \n\n\n"}}
