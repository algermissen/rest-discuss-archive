I said: &quot;REST, as I understand, is a style. You can build it with\n&gt; whatever you want&quot; and you said: &quot;No, you can&#39;t build whatever you\n&gt; want with REST.&quot;. Kind of different things, right? Same words,\n&gt; different order, different meaning.\n&gt; \n\nSorry about that -- I read it as &quot;you can build with it...&quot; which isn&#39;t\nwhat you wrote.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; a. REST is not only for reuse. If I don&#39;t care reuse, I can still\n&gt; have a case for REST.\n&gt;\n\nBut re-use is the entire basis for REST:\n\n&quot;By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the\ncomponent interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and\nthe visibility of interactions is improved.&quot;\n\nYou can&#39;t have a uniform interface, otherwise.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; b. REST is NOT about all the nodes out there, is about my\n&gt; application.\n&gt;\n\nREST is an explanation of an &quot;Internet-scale distributed hypermedia\nsystem&quot; known as the Web.  While REST may be applied to other domains,\nif you&#39;re using the Web, you can&#39;t ignore all those other nodes out\nthere, because those other nodes are what make the Web &quot;Internet scale.&quot;\n\nIf none of the nodes between producer and consumer are capable of\nunderstanding your messaging, then your application is *not* capable of\nachieving &quot;Internet scale,&quot; therefore your application cannot achieve\nthe goals of REST -- such an architecture may be considered REST-like,\nor inspired by REST, but cannot be considered REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; c. I may be wrong, but registering is not the only way of achieving\n&gt; self-descriptive language. Again, maybe Roy can tell me why, if it\n&gt; is, REST only solution is registration.\n&gt;\n\nPlease don&#39;t separate my point from the context in which it was made.\nOn the Web, i.e. using HTTP over the Internet, there is simply no\nalternative to using IANA-registered, standardized types.  This does\n*not* mean that REST&#39;s only solution to self-descriptive messaging is\nthe IANA registry -- it *does* mean there is no other way to achieve\nself-descriptive messaging on the Web.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; d. Non using IANA violates self-description?\n&gt;\n\nOn the Web, if your system is following REST, you MUST use IANA-\nregistered standardized types, otherwise your messaging is *not* self-\ndescriptive for the &quot;Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system&quot;\nyou&#39;re supposedly targeting by pursuing REST using HTTP over the\nInternet.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Style means you can use other things, following the same principles.\n&gt;\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It means do not force to use IANA and WEB for REST.\n&gt;\n\nNobody ever said it did.  If you *are* using the Web, then yes, REST\n*does* force you to use IANA-registered, standardized types.  Because\nthat&#39;s the only mechanism HTTP defines, and that everybody agrees to,\nfor the most important aspect of self-descriptive messaging -- exposing\nthe processing model of the payload without having to introspect.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
