Th=\r\nis defacto standard seems \nunnecessary and annoying.\n\nI notice that IE9 is =\r\nchanging its caching behaviour [1] to be more \ncompliant with the RFC&#39;s rec=\r\nommendation that history mechanisms are \ndifferent than caching, but it sti=\r\nll doesn&#39;t seem to solve the problem.  \nI&#39;d expect no-cache responses to st=\r\nill be redisplayable via the back-\nbutton, and probably only no-store respo=\r\nnses to possibly prevent history \ncaching.\n\n[1] http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/=\r\narchive/2010/07/14/caching-improvements-in-\ninternet-explorer-9.aspx\n(see t=\r\nhe section described as Back/Forward Optimization)\n\n-- \nDave\n\n\n"}}
