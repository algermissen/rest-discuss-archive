I recall you using an\n&gt; example like this before.\n\nYes, precisely.  For example, here is the UN/ECE recommended \nagreement for Offer-Acceptance transactions:\nhttp://www.unece.org/cefact/rec/rec31/rec31_2000_00tr257.pdf\n \nThat&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using as my prototype for such things.  I think \nwe have demonstrated that it could be RESTified, although I don&#39;t \nthink all the details have been worked out yet.\n\nOnce RESTified, it could be given a computable representation (e.g. \nXML or RDF, both of which UN/CEFACT is already working on) and \nreferenced in all offer-acceptance transactions governed by that \nagreement.\n\n&gt; &gt; identifying a resource that they are \n&gt; &gt; conversing about?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that&#39;s a different thing, though perhaps you misspoke, or \nI&#39;m\n&gt; misinterpreting you.  I take that to mean the URI in the HTTP \nrequest\n&gt; line, e.g. &quot;GET http://example.org/foo&quot;, rather than a URI \nidentifying\n&gt; some context in which the conversation is occuring (while remaining\n&gt; stateless).\n\nNo, you&#39;re right, you misinterpreted me (as I did you above).\n\nThe context for a transaction would include:\n* the transaction rules agreement e.g. the UN/ECE recommendation;\n* any long-term contracts between the trading partners;\n* the economic resources being traded, e.g. products, services, \nfinancial instruments, intellectual property, etc.;\n\nThen I think the transaction itself should have a URI, and also each \nof the speech acts (e.g. Offer and Acceptance or Rejection in an \noffer-acceptance transaction). \n\nIf the transaction succeeds (e.g. the offer is accepted), then the \ntrading partners have a new contract (e.g. an Order) which should \nalso have a URI with links to the transaction that created it.\n\nSo from the Order you would have a full set of legal evidence showing \nthe transaction that created it, the speech acts involved in the \ntransaction, message logs, etc. etc., all hyperlinked to the \ntransaction rules.  One could also code up an evaluator that \ndetermined if the transaction evidence followed the rules or not.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
