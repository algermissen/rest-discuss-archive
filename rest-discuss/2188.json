If you can model your security\n&gt; &gt; concerns in terms of principal, method and resource, then \n&gt; you can use\n&gt; &gt; the existing security framework in servlet/HTTP.  If Seth becomes\n&gt; &gt; a resource instead of a principal, you&#39;re screwed.  If what \n&gt; Seth wants\n&gt; &gt; to do to the Store is something that needs more granularity than\n&gt; &gt; {GET, PUT, POST, DELETE}, then you&#39;re screwed.  &quot;Screwed&quot; in the\n&gt; &gt; sense that you have to write an application. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hehe true, true.  I actually like writing applications like this, so \n&gt; it&#39;s a good time.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; One last point about all of this that I would love your feedback on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s take a simple example of opening a door (the door to \n&gt; the Store for \n&gt; instance).   To open a door, Seth would try to PUT the state \n&gt; of the door \n&gt; as OPEN.  The door would then say &quot;Yup, seth can put me in an \n&gt; open state&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the above it true, then the door has to do data validation \n&gt; based on \n&gt; rules and permissions.  For only certain people can change \n&gt; the state of \n&gt; the door to open.\n&gt; \n&gt; So a security policy would look a little like:\n&gt; \n&gt; Allow Seth to change Door1&#39;s isOpen property to true.\n&gt; Deny Bob to change Door1&#39;s isOpen property to true.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am controlling access to an object&#39;s properties and its values.\n&gt; \n&gt; That way, when I say:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /door1 HTTP/1.0\n&gt; WWW-Authentication: seth\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;door id=&quot;Door1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;isOpen&gt;true&lt;/isOpen&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/door&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The authorization filter can easily check if this a valid state, not \n&gt; only for the door, but if Seth can put that door into that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; SELECT count(*) FROM security_policy\n&gt; WHERE actor = &#39;seth&#39; AND              -- from WWW-Authentication\n&gt;        object = &#39;Door1&#39; AND            -- from id attr, or \n&gt; rdf:about attr\n&gt;        object_prop = &#39;isOpen&#39; AND\n&gt;        prop_value = &#39;true&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; All one has to do now is enumerate all properties of the \n&gt; object that is \n&gt; being PUT (easy to do if RDF) and compare all against a \n&gt; security_policy \n&gt; table which can be fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are we there?  Does this make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; feelin good,\n&gt; Seth\n&gt; \n\n"}}
