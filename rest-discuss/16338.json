Roughly, the meaning is &quot;I am sending you=\r\n this.\n&gt; Please understand it to be of this type and process accordingly&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Accept: tells the server which types of representations the user agent=\r\n\n&gt; can handle to achieve whatever it wants to achieve with the response\nto\n=\r\n&gt; the current query. Roughly: &quot;I am about to do something with what you\n&gt; s=\r\nend me back. I can do that something as long as you send me one of\nthe\n&gt; ac=\r\ncepted types.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; [The following is contradicting my previous statement b=\r\nelow, don&#39;t get\n&gt; confused]\n&gt; \n&gt; Media types primarily serve the purpose of=\r\n expressing processing\n&gt; models. Only when new processing models emerge sho=\r\nuld we mint new\nmedia\n&gt; types. IOW: as long as the media types you have ava=\r\nilable make correct\n&gt; candidates for the Content-Type header values we do n=\r\not need new media\n&gt; types.\n&gt; \n&gt; application/atom+xml is in that sense neces=\r\nsary because it defines a\n&gt; very different processing model than text/html.=\r\n While you could\nprovide\n&gt; the same information as application/atom+xml doe=\r\ns with text/html and\n&gt; microformats you could not express a processing mode=\r\nl beyond that of\n&gt; text/html.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think of it this way: when you say Conte=\r\nnt-Type: text/html the\n&gt; recipient will fire up the browser, never the feed=\r\n reader.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The issues I have had with declaring capabilities or ex=\r\npectations in\n&gt; the Accept header are better solved by the principle of des=\r\nigning for\n&gt; re-use, IMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; My major concern is how the server developer=\r\n would know about any\n&gt; additional expectation of the client beyond the dec=\r\nlared Accept\nvalues.\n&gt; I am (was) worried that the server developer would n=\r\not have a clue\nthat\n&gt; would keep him form doing simply *anything* as long a=\r\ns the response\n&gt; comes in e.g. application/atom+xml.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, in my thinki=\r\nng, the developers &#39;in&#39; a system (say: an enterprise,\n&gt; or *the* Web, or an=\r\n enterprise and it&#39;s suppliers) know[1] the set of\n&gt; media types used. Rega=\r\nrding the example below, a server side developer\n&gt; of the new-orders resour=\r\nce would know that orders can be represented\nas\n&gt; application/order. When i=\r\nt comes to implementing the handler for\n&gt; application/atom+xml designing fo=\r\nr maximised re-usability would mean\nto\n&gt; either include the application/ord=\r\ner XML directly in the feed or at\n&gt; least provide alternate links from wher=\r\ne the client can access the\n&gt; application/order version.\n&gt; \n&gt; Simply servin=\r\ng an HTML (or even scaned image) based feed and not\n&gt; providing application=\r\n/order somehow would just be bad design.\n&gt; \n&gt; On this basis, having the new=\r\nly-ordered-items-summary-building client\n&gt; just send Accept: applicaton/ato=\r\nm+xml would do the job for me. Then,\nif\n&gt; you want to fortify your system a=\r\n bit more, you can use profile\n&gt; parameters to help conneg (but it now appe=\r\nars to me as typical\n&gt; enterprisey overkill).\n\nReplace &quot;processing model&quot; w=\r\nith &quot;data model&quot; and I think you&#39;ve got it.\nThis style bends over backwards=\r\n to be declarative, which limits the\n&quot;processing model&quot; to two things: pars=\r\ning and state transitions, both of\nwhich are provided fully in the data its=\r\nelf. Any higher layers of\nprocessing are unconstrained, and a human with a =\r\nbrowser can process a\nresponse wildly differently than a spider, or even di=\r\nfferently than\nother humans. This is the essence of re-use, and is baked in=\r\nto the\nconstraints of the style. Bonus points for identifying recent popula=\r\nr\nmedia-types that have strayed from this declarative path.\n\n\nRobert Brewer=\r\n\nfumanchu@...\n\n"}}
