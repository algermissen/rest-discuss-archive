That&#39;s not what I had in mind, I&#39;m \nquite content with authentication information or possibly a set of \ncapabilities.\n\n&gt; As the \n&gt; administrator of the origin server, all that you need is that each\n&gt; request bear acceptable credentials. Even that is not quite correct,\n&gt; because a request that fails to bear acceptable credentials should\n&gt; prompt a response that bears a challenge for credentials. Did I miss\n&gt; something?\n\nPossibly. Let&#39;s say I have a resource where the representation depends \non the credentials of the requester. I could associate each \nrepresentation with its own URL, but that&#39;s not what I want. \nEssentially, I only ever want to have one canonical URL and a requester \ngets to see what their credentials allow. In particular, someone with \nno credentials at all may still get to see a rudimentary \nrepresentation. In such a scenario there is no point in challenging the \nrequester -- human user. They may decide to log in or log in with \ndifferent credentials, but that&#39;s up to the them.\n\nAlso, as far as I can tell, an http auth challenge involves popping up a \nbrowser-level dialog. I take it, most users aren&#39;t accustomed to this. \nAnd, at any rate, it modally drags them out of the application context \nwithout a chance for inline help messages or &quot;I forgot my password&quot; \nlinks.\n\nI&#39;d really like to make this work, but I&#39;m not convinced there is a way.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n"}}
