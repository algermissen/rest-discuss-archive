How are others dealing with this?\n &gt;\n &gt; CommandQuery doesn&#39;t work for distributed systems. As Eiffel programmer\n &gt; I use it all the time, but it doesn&#39;t fit distributed systems. The\n &gt; overhead is already twice the pure REST model.\n\nWhat creates this overhead?\n\nFor example, if I have one command create a thousand objects, wouldn&#39;t \nthat have to be replaced with a thousand PUT&#39;s if I didn&#39;t use commands? \nOr what kind of overhead are we talking about?\n\n &gt; And note that REST knows command/query separation by use of GET versus\n &gt; the other verbs. So it already separates them. They&#39;re just different\n &gt; paradigms, don&#39;t mix local programming models with distributed\n &gt; ones. That&#39;s a very different case.\n\nI am using CQS specifically because of its supposed virtues in \ndistributed programming. See:\nhttp://www.udidahan.com/2008/08/11/command-query-separation-and-soa/\n\nAlso, if I didn&#39;t encapsulate the domain logic to be executed in the \ncommand on the server, wouldn&#39;t it have to be duplicated in the client? \nAnd if so, doesn&#39;t that pose a maintenance and security problem?\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
