A resource is a conceptual mapping.  That mapping may be\nas abstract as &quot;the Apple Store&quot; or as concrete as a single apple that\nwas at one time in a box at the Apple Store.  A resource is largely\ndefined by what you make of it.  So it is possible that the\nrepresentations of a given resource do not change over time.\nA web site is a resource.  A web page (the conceptual page expected\nby a user when they follow a hypertext link) is a resource.\nSo are each of the in-line elements that make up that page, as\nare (at least for the server) all of the files/programs used to\nconstruct the content of that page.  Each of those are separate\nresources in their own right.\n\nBut knowing what the &quot;resource&quot; is does not teach much about REST,\nsince REST is designed to hide that information from clients.\n\nLots of people complain about the definition, largely because\nit seems so nebulous and effectively anything could be a resource.\nWhat they don&#39;t understand is that allowing anything to be a resource\nis the goal, and REST describes how to build an architecture that\ncan effectively manipulate anything even when the client has no\nidea what that thing actually may be.  That&#39;s the point.\n\nIf an application can accomplish the user&#39;s need of today in a\nway that is reusable by others, and without revealing much of\nanything about how it works, then there is a good chance that\nthe implementation of how it works can evolve independently of\nthe user and also that how the user makes use of that work can\nevolve independently from what was anticipated by the resource\nowner.  Those are two of the goals of REST: independent evolvability\nand design-for-serendipity.  There are other goals (e.g., scalability).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
