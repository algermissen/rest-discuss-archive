It is quite sure users will not be happy with \n&gt; such approach. \n\nA last shout from me on this, because when it comes to authentication I \nwill gladly admit to having much ignorance generally, and all the more \nso in the context of this list, where there are plenty who know plenty.\n\nHowever, just a thought. Perhaps passing information in the &quot;opaque&quot; \nportion of digest authentication headers allow for the server that can \nvouch for the identity of the client in question to be identified and \nqueried?\n\n\n"}}
