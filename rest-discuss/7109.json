I started something like that a long time ago\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/destiny/) but never kept working on\nit. I hope you find success with your project and keep it going.\n\n&gt; Messages are never stored by HJB - it acts a pure gateway translating\n&gt; requests into actions in the JMS messaging system.  Once a message is\n&gt; retrieved, only the next is available so providing a GET URL is not an\n&gt; option.\nHow do you know that the retrieval was succesful?\nYou may want to consider explicit message acknowledgement, possibly\nvia DELETE where the URI contains the message id.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I could not see any distinct advantage in using either GET or POST for\n&gt; start and stop things.  I decided to go with GET with stop/start/other\n&gt; operations, because for nearly all them, re-requesting the URL without\n&gt; any other intermediate state changes leaves &#39;system&#39; in the same\n&gt; state.  Although all client interaction with a messaging system is\n&gt; inherently transient, these operations &#39;felt&#39; as idempotent within the\n&gt; lifetime of any given client - hence the use of GET.\nAlthough start/stop may be idempotent (predictibly repeatable) they\ndon&#39;t seem safe - they do change how the system will behave after that\npoint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; While the API here makes good use of Location headers in response to\n&gt; &gt; POSTs, it seems like there could be a more extensive use of hypermedia.\n&gt; &gt; Right now, it appears clients are going to be hard-coded to build urls\n&gt; &gt; based on this documentation, rather than through a dialog with the\n&gt; &gt; server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What could be done to fix this? E.g., would it be worth adding\n&gt; something similar to the /list command that shows all the possible\n&gt; sub-URLs that can be obtained on any given resource?\nThat would be very nice.\n\n"}}
