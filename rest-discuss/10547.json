If I can use a 202\nresponse to DELETE which consists of a confirmation form, that form can\nhave a checkbox (default checked) for 410 Gone, unchecked means 404.\n\nIf the client cancels or otherwise fails to submit the confirmation\nform, the DELETE never happens, which is fine because the 202 response\ndoesn&#39;t promise success.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
