I have general question that which is the most popular and mostly used framework for RESTful web services.\n&gt; e.g. Jerset, Restlet or Rails. I am not asking for a specific language, but in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Dhillon\n&gt;   \n\nYou&#39;re being told there are no REST frameworks because most frameworks \nare built specifically for RESTful HTTP. It&#39;s confusing because most \npeople use &#39;REST&#39; when they actually mean RESTful HTTP.\n\nMost &#39;standard&#39; MVC frameworks are ok - provided you can play with the \nrouting logic to avoid exposing RPC&#39;ish URIs.\n\nI like to treat a controller as a resource, and constrain controller \n&#39;actions&#39;/methods to the HTTP verbs. This helps to think in terms of \nresources and the uniform interface, and it simplifies the routing logic \nto exactly one controller per URI pattern.\n\nI played around with Zend Framework to test this, and was reasonably \nhappy with the result:\n\nhttp://github.com/mikekelly/Resauce\n\nExposing resources is the easy bit though - now you need to establish \nrepresentations which respect the hypermedia constraint, I guess AtomPub \ncould be viewed as a &#39;framework&#39; for this\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
