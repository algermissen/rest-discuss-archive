In \n&gt; fact, Fielding argues in hi=\r\ns dissertation that push-vs-pull is the key \n&gt; difference.

Dissertations\na=\r\nre a successful walk through a minefield -- summarizing them\nis not.  One o=\r\nf the professors who signed my dissertation,\nDavid S. Rosenblum, was workin=\r\ng at the time on Internet-scale\nevent-based notification systems.\n\n   &lt;http=\r\n://www.ics.uci.edu/~irus/wisen/index-old.html&gt;\n\nYou might want to look at R=\r\nohit&#39;s dissertation for more exploration.\n   &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit=\r\n/&gt;\n\n&gt;  &quot;The interaction method of sending representations of resources to \n=\r\n&gt; consuming components has some parallels with event-based integration \n&gt; (=\r\nEBI) styles. The key difference is that EBI styles are push-based. \n&gt; The c=\r\nomponent containing the state (equivalent to an origin server in \n&gt; REST) i=\r\nssues an event whenever the state changes, whether or not any \n&gt; component =\r\nis actually interested in or listening for such an event. In \n&gt; the REST st=\r\nyle, consuming components usually pull representations. \n&gt; Although this is=\r\n less efficient when viewed as a single client wishing \n&gt; to monitor a sing=\r\nle resource, the scale of the Web makes an \n&gt; unregulated push model infeas=\r\nible.&quot;\n&gt;  =A0-5.4 (paragraph 4) - \n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/=\r\ndissertation/rest_arch_style.htm\n\nUnregulated push models are infeasible on=\r\n the Web.  There needs to\nbe something regulating the flow of events, which=\r\n means aggregations\nand source-based filtering.  I did not even attempt to =\r\naddress that\ntopic because it wasn&#39;t *my* topic.\n\n&gt; For reference/archive d=\r\nata, a pull model definitely makes the most \n&gt; sense. Yet the pull model sh=\r\nows cracks when used for real-time \n&gt; delivery scenarios like RSS.\n\nI think=\r\n the key thing that people should learn from my dissertation\nis that princi=\r\npled design means thinking about the problem you want\nto solve first, withi=\r\nn the context you need to solve it, and then\nselectively applying constrain=\r\nts to get the properties you want.\nREST was just one example of that method=\r\n.  A natural &quot;next step&quot;\nwould be to look at a different problem (say, ISEN=\r\ns) and see what\nadditional constraints could be added to EBI in order to ma=\r\nke it\nmore scalable.  I would not start with REST as the basis.\n\n&gt; It seems=\r\n to me that you could take all the other benefits of REST \n&gt; (standardized =\r\nwire protocol, URIs, distributed caching, limited verb \n&gt; set) and apply it=\r\n to a push model (perhaps over XMPP) and see the end \n&gt; of problems like th=\r\nis:\n&gt;\n&gt;  =A0 &quot;...InfoWorld.com now sees a massive surge of RSS newsreader \n=\r\n&gt; activity at the top of every hour, presumably because most people \n&gt; conf=\r\nigure their newsreaders to wake up at that time to pull their \n&gt; feeds. If =\r\nI didn&#39;t know how RSS worked, I would think we were being \n&gt; slammed by a b=\r\nunch of zombies sitting on compromised home PCs.&quot;\n&gt;  =A0- http://www.infowo=\r\nrld.com/article/04/07/16/29OPconnection_1.html\n\nEr, or they could just cont=\r\nract with Akamai and they would never\nsee any &quot;massive surge&quot;. *shrug*\n\nPus=\r\nh models suffer from a major social problem: those that gain the\nmost are t=\r\nhe least likely to pay for it.  For example, every news\nservice thinks that=\r\n they are the center of the universe.  Consider\nwhat would happen if every =\r\nblog client received an event whenever\na story was published that the news =\r\nservice *thinks* is worthy of\ntheir immediate attention.  We already know w=\r\nhat happens: SPAM.\nTo solve the scalability problem you will first need to =\r\nregulate\nthat social problem, because publishers will not self-regulate.\n\nI=\r\nt is, however, one heck of a dissertation topic.\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
