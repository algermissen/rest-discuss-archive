Here are my initial reactions:\n\n1.) The Blueprint file &quot;feels&quot; like it&#39;s too tightly bound to the class and\nmight be better if it were more loosly bound allowing a lot more\nflexibility. My caveat is that this is just my subjective impression and I\nmay be misinterpretting.\n\n2.) Given how so many people evidently misunderstand REST principles (this\nfrom what others on REST-discuss have told me recently) I think the\n&quot;verb/method&quot; syntax might confuse people that don&#39;t yet understand REST.\nMay I propose, assuming similar syntax w/o incorporating any of my comments\nfrom #1:\n\n     &lt;feature&gt;\n         &lt;signature&gt;answer/&lt;/signature&gt;\n         &lt;HttpMethod&gt;GET&lt;/HttpMethod&gt;\n         &lt;InstanceMethod&gt;GetAnswer&lt;/InstanceMethod&gt;\n     &lt;/feature&gt;\n\n3.) I was confused by your use of &quot;@&quot; for &quot;@config&quot; and &quot;@inspect.&quot;  May I\nask why you chose to use them instead of just &quot;config&quot; and &quot;inspect?&quot;\nAccording to RFC 3986, the &quot;@&quot; sign is a reserved character [1]  in a URL\nand thus it&#39;s not really a good idea to use them because them much be URL\nencoded, and they might even conflict with potential future usage\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not a REST expert (yet :) so I look forward to the others here\nweighing in on both of our comments.\n\n--\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1] http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html#reserved\n\n\n"}}
