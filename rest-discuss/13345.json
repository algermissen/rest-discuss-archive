The\nthing is, it&#39;s all really philosophically interchangeable in the end\n(for a good example of what I&#39;m talking about, see &quot;Everything is\nmiscellaneous&quot;; google it). I know we&#39;re all hardcore engineers here\nand all, but if we take a step back and examine what we&#39;re doing here\nin human terms, what the heck is all this bickering about?\n\nI find this (&quot;HTTP is a application protocol NOT a middleware\nprotocol&quot;) a bit of a strange assertion. First of all, the notion of\nmiddleware is to glue software components and / or systems together,\nand as such an application protocol *is* a middleware protocol. Are we\nhere just battling over semantics that actually are superfluous in\nnature? Aren&#39;t we trying to say that RESTful design removes much of\nthe need for *traditional* middleware whos sole purpose is to glue\napplications together through structures simulating OO (which REST\ndoes for you in better ways through resources [mining from\nidentification management]), so why are you recreating the middleware\nproblem through something that already solves much of it? This\nmisguidance will of course be misinterpreted as commercial bias.\n\nPeople whinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias. Um, computer\nscientists have a bias too, even people who have no bias have a basic\nphilosophical bias, and these semantics *will* affect (as oppose to\nmere observatory notions) the work that is done. The argument of bias\nis mostly moot (but not completely, of course). I personally get the\nfeeling that these REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only\nbusiness bias that I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went\nwith it. That&#39;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and\nas such I *really* welcome it.\n\nThe name &quot;REST-*&quot; is not *so* bad. Of course, it reels up too much\ncrap baggage from the WS-* scene (and if we&#39;re unlucky, too much of\nthat crap will be adapted unscrutinized because of the traditional\nmiddleware thinking), but in terms of &quot;defining good scaffolding for\nRESTful systems design&quot; it&#39;s a good all-embracing term. I think the\nfirst two drafts there indeed are HTTP-*, but if this is meant to be a\njunction-point of various RESTful goodness, the name might still be a\ngood future name (except the WS-* associations themselves, which I\nsuspect were driven more by marketing than anything else). I&#39;d like to\nsee more defined content-types, too, that are more enterprise in\nnature, perhaps common practices for dealing with value systems,\ndifferent means of capturing state (as in, the messages themselves as\nopposed to the state embedded in the hyperlinks), and so on.\n\nTheir two first drafts are possibly somewhat misguided in terms of\nhardcore REST (and don&#39;t jump on me here; I am too a hardcore REST\nproponent), but if the community got involved and worked in similar\nways to, say, the Atom work-groups (which I had the pleasure of\njoining), it could turn into something beautiful and much needed. Just\nbecause parts of a platform is misguided doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be\nfixed and needs to be shunned and laughed at from the get go (and yes,\nI&#39;m looking at you, Roy! :)\n\nI kinda get the feeling that *both* sides of this divide have\nforgotten, overlooked or don&#39;t see the importance of the REST state\nsystem, which makes the notion of an API a bit moot. Yes, many have\nriled against the API notion, but more for alternative reasons. And I\nthink it all comes down to this; if you do it RESTfully, you don&#39;t\nreally care about APIs, but resources. And when the API is gone, your\nnotion of middleware is quite different (it moves into the caching and\nforwarding arena of smart web-servers), and that *this* is the crux of\nthe current disagreements.\n\nSemantics drift in and out of systems, and right now someone is trying\nto put a square REST resource into a huge [death]star-shaped\nmiddleware end-point. I suggest the RESTafarians come up with good\nguidance and alternatives, and the middleware people gently shift\ntheir thinking.\n\nIn the end, though, thanks, Red Hat, for daring to stir things up a\nbit. It was getting a bit boring. :)\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n--\nProject Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n--- http://shelter.nu/blog/ ----------------------------------------------\n------------------ http://www.google.com/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n\n"}}
