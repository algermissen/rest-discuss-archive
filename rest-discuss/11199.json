Even goi=\r\nng back in time to 2396 I see:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.2 &quot; These characters are called &quot;reser=\r\nved&quot;, since\n&gt; their usage within the URI component is limited to their rese=\r\nrved\n&gt; purpose. If the data for a URI component would conflict with the\n&gt; r=\r\neserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before\n&gt; forming=\r\n the URI.&quot;\n&gt; And\n&gt; &quot; Characters in the &quot;reserved&quot; set are not reserved in a=\r\nll contexts.\n&gt; The set of characters actually reserved within any given URI=\r\n\n&gt; component is defined by that component.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, we do see:\n&gt; &quot;The =\r\nangle-bracket &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; and double-quote (&quot;) characters are\n&gt; excluded be=\r\ncause they are often used as the delimiters around URI&quot;\n&gt; And\n&gt; &quot;Other char=\r\nacters are excluded [of the non-escaped ascii set] because\n&gt; gateways and o=\r\nther transport\n&gt; agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or t=\r\nhey are\n&gt; used as delimiters.\n&gt;\n&gt; unwise =3D &quot;{&quot; | &quot;}&quot; | &quot;|&quot; | &quot;&#92;&quot; | &quot;^&quot; | =\r\n&quot;[&quot; | &quot;]&quot; | &quot;`&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The new RFC, which obsoletes that RFC, says that : Sect=\r\nion 2, on characters,\n&gt; has been rewritten to explain what\n&gt; characters are=\r\n reserved, when they are reserved, and why they are\n&gt; reserved, even when t=\r\nhey are not used as delimiters by the generic\n&gt; syntax.\n&gt;\n&gt; All in all, tho=\r\nse characters are used widely, and the previous versio would\n&gt; have you enc=\r\node them.
