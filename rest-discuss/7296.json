Why\n&gt;   didn&#39;t they hire someone with a brain to do this?\nIt&#39;s called marketecture. Most people (developers, managers, executives)\nI&#39;ve talked with in the past few years regarding REST just think of it as a\nlabel like all other techno-marketing-babble. It doesn&#39;t occur to them that\nthere actually is something to learn here. The engineering teams are too\nbusy making legacy systems accessible via the Web that they don&#39;t think\nabout designing /for/ the Web.\n\nMost places are simply trying to do /something/ to get developers involved -\nthey really have no notion of &#39;good&#39; or &#39;thoughtful&#39;, merely getting others\ninvolved is sufficient. They also are trying to deliver what they think\ndevelopers want or are asking for. If developers call this rubbish and ask\nfor something better, then it&#39;ll change. Otherwise, it&#39;ll stay and only the\nmost broken bits will change - slowly. The weird part is that this is\nversion 3 of their &#39;REST&#39; API.\n\n\n\n"}}
