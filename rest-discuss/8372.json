I have absolutely\n&gt; no idea what that has to do with REST, or why it appears on the\n&gt; wikipedia entry as well. YMMV.\n\nIt&#39;s as an effective visual mnemonic to tie everything together.   \nThere is no meaning to the triangle.  If there were more principles,  \nit could be an octagon. :)\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://www.mindtouch.com\nhttp://www.opengarden.org\n\n\n"}}
