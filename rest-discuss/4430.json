There \nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing wrong with telling the client how it can form URI&#39;s,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assuming that such a function doesn&#39;t change much over time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, for cache reasons, I prefer methods of telling the \nclient\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use the template\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     http://example.com/quotes/${exchange}/${symbol}\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than the template\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     http://example.com/quotes?market=${exchange}\n&symbol=${symbol}\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is nothing stopping WSDL-like technology from defining\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both of these mechanisms.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....Roy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, now there&#39;s an idea.

But I&#39;d \nlove\n&gt; &gt; to get a more general generative naming language in there that \ncould\n&gt; &gt; support hierarchy as Roy describes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mark.\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Mark Baker.
