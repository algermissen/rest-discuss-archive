Especially the general part on software achitecture (first  \n&#39;h=\r\nalf&#39;), which is unrelated to REST and but lays the foundation is  \nwell wor=\r\nth a read.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But &quot;it is common sense for the service not to evolve inco=\r\nmpatibly&quot;\n&gt;&gt; just does not work inside the enterprise. There, people need\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; to be specific about the kind of constract that is at\n&gt;&gt; work (even if th=\r\ne contract is deliberately very loose!)\n&gt;\n&gt; I have this feeling that maybe =\r\nenterprise intergration is not  \n&gt; RESTful in itself?\n\nNo, I would not say =\r\nthat. I&#39;d rather question to what extend the  \nhypermedia constraint can be=\r\n adhered in M2M interactions. The question  \nof Web vs. Enterprise is unrel=\r\ntaed.\n\n\n&gt; I am no so sure that a bank wants to use an &quot;independently evolvi=\r\nng&quot;  \n&gt; service - it kind of contradicts eveything in the banking sector.  =\r\n\n&gt; You want it to be 100% reliable. You want your system to be 100%  \n&gt; sta=\r\nble - new features are considered bad unless proved otherwise. In  \n&gt; such =\r\na scenario I really can&#39;t see anyone being happy with an  \n&gt; evolving servi=\r\nce.\n\nSoftware systems are constantly evolving because the economical  \nsurr=\r\nounding of the enterprise is in constant change. IT has to adapt  \nto suppo=\r\nrt new business functions. REST&#39;s benefit here is (besides  \nsimplicity, vi=\r\nsibility etc.) that you need not bring (possibly  \ngeographically distribut=\r\ned development teams) together to discuss each  \nand every API change. So, =\r\nno - REST is for the enterprise...because,  \nIMO, the problem space of toda=\r\nys increasingly networked enterprises is  \nexactly the problem space as tha=\r\nt of the Web.\n\nThe difference is only that inside the enterprise people nee=\r\nd to plan  \ndifferently. E.g. it is not enough to say that &quot;An ordering ser=\r\nvice  \nwon&#39;t change incompatibly because that would be detrimental to its  =\r\n\nbusiness model&quot;. In the enterprise people want to develop clients and  \nse=\r\nrvices in parallel, shich rules out client design by inspecting the  \nrunti=\r\nme behavior of a service.\n\n\n&gt; If &quot;evolving&quot; is mandatory for a RESTful syst=\r\nem, well, then  \n&gt; enterprise integration cannot be RESTful.\n\nNo, I disagre=\r\ne with that (vehemently :-).\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
