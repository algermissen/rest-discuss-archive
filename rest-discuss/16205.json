Especially I am\n&gt;&gt; wondering whether it is enough for the user agent to say\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Accept: application/atom+xml;type=feed\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; or whether the Accept header should include the user agent\n&gt; capabilities\n&gt;&gt; regarding the individual order entries, e.g.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Accept: application/orderlist\n&gt; \n&gt; I consider media types as syntax, not semantics.\n\nMedia types are a lot more than syntax: media types provide intended processing semantics.\n\nIs this &lt;html&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt; an HTML document or an XSLT stylesheet? Only the media type provided by the sender can tell you that.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; If\n&gt; application/orderlist really has different syntax than\n&gt; application/atom+xml, then, OK I guess. But it probably shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; Instead, the semantics of the resource are described by the @rel\n&gt; attribute the user-agent discovered and followed (in combination with\n&gt; data and its arrangement in the response, including further links in the\n&gt; response). Your resource could just as easily return &quot;text/html&quot; with\n&gt; the same semantics and, if the client understood HTML, could be\n&gt; processed meaningfully, in which case the client would emit &quot;Accept:\n&gt; application/atom+xml, text/html&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, the Accept header says, &quot;these are the representation\n&gt; formats I am prepared to parse for a resource of the &#39;new-orders&#39;\n&gt; relation&quot;. A media type of &quot;application/orderlist&quot; *can* be used in that\n&gt; way, but couples too tightly, IMO. There are plenty of &quot;list-y&quot; media\n&gt; types out there already--does a list of orders really differ\n&gt; significantly in structure (not just differ in @rel&#39;s) from a list of,\n&gt; say, sale items? Atom has succeeded, IMO, because it is specific in\n&gt; syntax (&quot;feed&quot; = list of items in order, with some fixed fields) and\n&gt; generic in semantics (doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re listing). I wrote Shoji\n&gt; [1] because I wanted to hit that sweet spot for a &quot;catalog&quot; syntax\n&gt; (entities and overlapping lists of entity URI&#39;s) that was independent of\n&gt; the semantic--I wrote it for Etsy procurement, but it could equally be\n&gt; used for representing scientific lab work. If the syntax fits, wear it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Robert Brewer\n&gt; fumanchu@...\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.aminus.org/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-01.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
