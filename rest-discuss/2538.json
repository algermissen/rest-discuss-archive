Or does\n&gt; he mean that once a resource is born, it always exists, even\n&gt; after it&#39;s been deleted?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it must be the latter, else we have to ask what the\n&gt; meaning of &quot;Created&quot; is in response to some PUT or POST.\n\nI look at it this way:\n\nResources can be seen from two points of view: the client and the server.\n&gt;From the server POV, the resource exists exactly as long as the server wants\nit to exist.  The server brings it into being and the server destroys it as\nwell.  I suppose you could think of the server as being omniscient with\nrespect to the resources it controls.  On the other hand, from the client\nPOV, the resource only exists as long as it can be identified.  In other\nwords, the client knows the existance a resource once it has obtained an\nidentifier that is mapped to that resource.  When the identifier becomes\ninvalid (via DELETE, for instance), the resource ceases to exist to the\nclient (regardless of whether the server&#39;s POV says it still exist or not).\n\n&gt; As an implementation detail, it may be difficult for server software\n&gt; to keep track of all deleted resources that may have once existed,\n&gt; given that resource space is effectively infinite.\n&gt;\n&gt; If someone does a DELETE on a resource that has never existed,\n&gt; should the server discriminate that case against the case of a\n&gt; deleted resource?  I don&#39;t think so...\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps a better way to think of it is thus:  DELETE is idempotent\n&gt; in the sense that it describes an end-state of a resource, not\n&gt; a method.  So, the existence of a resource is not an important\n&gt; pre-condition for DELETE.  A 200 response to DELETE always means\n&gt; &quot;okay, it&#39;s not mapped (now)&quot;.  And who cares how we got to that\n&gt; state.\n\nA response of 200 would certainly make the interface less complicated.  I\nhave to admit that having the server decide between 200, 404, and 410 and\nhaving the client distinguish the responses is potentially unnecessary\noverhead.  However, the one thing that 200 (used in this case) does not tell\nyou is whether the mapping did exist or not.  So, supposing you meant to\ndelete a mapping and accidentally entered the identifier wrong.  The server\nwould not tell you that you gave an invalid identifier.  On the other hand,\nthis could be avoided by performing a GET prior to the DELETE when this was\nimportant.  The trade-off here is whether you increase code and reduce\nnetwork traffic by using more than one response, or vice versa.  In the end,\nI&#39;d say provide support for both and leave it up to the application-level\nsemantics to determine which to use.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
