and &quot;a list&quot;, because these concepts can be easily mapped into pretty much any representation. when it says &quot;an object&quot;, however, that&#39;s an entirely different matter. it would be great for the registry to really be clear about what kind of structures to expect for hints (single values, value lists, and maybe lists of key/value pairs or something along those lines), and then the registry would not depend on a specific language.\n&gt; It&#39;s certainly possible to map the JSON data model into XML; it just won&#39;t make XML people happy, because it&#39;ll have lots of elements named &quot;object&quot; and &quot;array&quot; (although I see a fair amount of &quot;native&quot; XML like this anyway!).\n\nsure, with enough effort, anything can be mapped to anything. my point \nwas to have something for the link hints that can be mapped into more \nuseful structures for any target mapping, and not just for JSON.\n\n&gt; I very much agree that it would be good to not have a dependency upon the JSON data model here. However, I don&#39;t see a way to avoid that, without either a) using another data model with exactly the same problem, or b) prohibiting any structured information.\n&gt; AIUI you&#39;re suggesting (b). Looking through the current list of hints, we already have quite a few that need structure. Can you suggest how to convey the information without using structured data?\n\ni think there are three possibilities:\n\n- pick a generic format (such as JSON) as allow anything it allows. this \nmakes things great for JSON and not so great for non-JSON.\n\n- be structure agnostic (hints are strings) and then hints will probably \ndefine their own mappings into string-based structures (using regexes \nand usual patterns such as whitespace- or comma-separated lists). this \nmight be bad because then parsing a hint&#39;s value needs to be done on a \nper-hint basis.\n\n- pick a small set of structures allowed such as the ones i suggested \nabove (single values, value lists, and maybe lists of key/value pairs) \nand require that any hint is defined in terms of this more restricted \nmodel. this maps better to many formats, but you&#39;re stuck with the \nchoices you make.\n\nso my suggestion is not so much your (b) but my (c) ;-) fwiw, it seems \nthat thew current draft uses overly complicated structures, for example, \n&quot;formats&quot; maybe just could be an array of formats?\n\nit&#39;s clearly a trade-off between allowing arbitrarily structured hints \n(in which case you need some generic metamodel) or predefining the kinds \nof structures that hints can use (in which case you can remove the \ndependency on a particular generic metamodel). i am still trying to \nunderstand how that problem has been solved in similar cases. i assume \nthis is not the first (proposed) IANA registry that has to deal with \nthis tradeoff; does anybody have pointers to this has been handled in \nsimilar cases?\n\nthanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
