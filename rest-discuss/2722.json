Also have a piece \nof Python code I wrote that turns wiki-style tables plus a &quot;map&quot; \ndatastructure into a dot graph description... if anybody&#39;s interested, \ngive me a holler. When we get the RESTWiki back up, we should install \nthis stuff there --- tres useful. We use our Wiki up at work to \ncoordinate all development specification and planning activities, and a \nlot of this stuff is the trivial fruit of some work to integrate Wiki \nand bugzilla and automate various dev planning processes.\n[quote]\n\nYes, very interested in the &quot;dot code&quot; processor.  I want to post my\nAlloy models to the REST Wiki, showing graphs of certain instances of\nthe models.  Coincidentally, Alloy saves the info in &quot;dot code&quot;, so\nyes this would be very helpful.  Also helpful would be if someone knows\nhow to make the processor part of REST Wiki, &#39;cuz I sure as hell\ndon&#39;t.\n\nBTW - thanks to Mark and whomever else helped fix REST Wiki.\n\nCheerio,\n\nWalden\n\nWalden Mathews\nILX Systems\n111 Fulton St. 3rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10038\nPhone (212) 510-3121\nFax (212) 520-3800\n\n"}}
