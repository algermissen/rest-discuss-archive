That btw, is very like the\n&gt;&gt; Rails /img.png?20060404 idiom that Tim Bray recently blogged about and\n&gt;&gt; has been described as &quot;layer mixing&quot;. Layering&#39;s not the problem tho&#39;,\n&gt;&gt; incoherency is*. IMO the pattern &quot;Assign URIs To Representations&quot;\n&gt;&gt; results in protocol gibberish.\n&gt;&gt;\n\nI believe that Tim&#39;s objection to the Rails idiom was that the \n/img.png?20060404 and /img.png?20060419 aren&#39;t really distinct resources \nbecause only one of the two will exist on the server at a time. So I \ncan&#39;t bookmark one version and expect to be able to access it once a new \nversion is deployed.\n\n&gt; It isn&#39;t assigning URIs to representations. It is assigning a URI to  \n&gt; each piece of conversational state, each of which by definition  \n&gt; becomes a resource. By defining a URI for each step along the way in  \n&gt; a conversation, the user can back up to any previous place in the  \n&gt; conversation with the back button.\n\nIt seems that Bill V&#39;s proposal doesn&#39;t have the problem that Tim \nidentified--he&#39;s saying that if I bookmark my basket before adding an \nitem, I can access the previous state of the basket by calling up the \nbookmarked URL (or hitting the back button). That sounds like a lot for \nthe server to keep track of, but not an abuse of HTTP or URLs.\n\nJim\n\n"}}
