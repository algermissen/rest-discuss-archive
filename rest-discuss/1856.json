I&#39;m not\n&gt; interested in uber-efficiency, just the  requirement of one and only one\n&gt; consumer of a message.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve got two approaches to model the queue - a visible (i.e. list-able)\n&gt; collection of messages and as a &#39;head&#39; or &#39;next&#39; message. I&#39;m not sure the\n&gt; &#39;head&#39; approach will work.\n\nActually, this is a good problem to explore, because I it gives me a strong urge\nto model the solution with verbs.  It&#39;s most certainly not a good idea to\ntransfer a representation of the entire queue, modify it, and transfer it back.\nThere must be a protocol for queue interaction that is RESTful.  How about this\napproach:\n\n1. A &#39;POST /myqueue&#39; to enqueue a message representation.  The entity\n   is treated as a subordinate to the &#39;/myqueue&#39; queue resource.\n2. A &#39;DELETE /myqueue/head&#39; to dequeue a representation of the first\n   message in the queue.  The entity returned is a representation\n   of the removed message.\n3. A &#39;GET /myqueue&#39; transfers a representation of the queue\n   resource.  This would have a list of URIs identifying each\n   message in the queue.\n4. A &#39;GET /myqueue/messages/123&#39; transfers a represenation of a\n   message resource.\n\nThere doesn&#39;t seem to be any need for locking.  Is this consistent with what you\nwould need, or am I missing an issue or requirement that might make this\napproach invalid?\n\n-Philip\n\n\n\n\n"}}
