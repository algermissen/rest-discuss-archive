DELETE is idempotent \nand therefore deleting something once or deleting something a \nthousand times is the same operation. I&#39;m not sure where people got \nthe idea that there&#39;s something wrong with deleting something twice \nbecause that&#39;s never ever been true of HTTP and in fact most systems \nthat expose a delete operation (eg databases, file systems, tuple \nspaces, g-indexes, maps). Further, there is no logical discontinuity \nbetween this behavior and the meaning of a delete request. I&#39;m not \nsure why some people want to make this more complicated than it is, \nbut I think it&#39;s clear to the majority.\n\n\n- itdp\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Paul Prescod &lt;paul@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; S.

HTTP says \nbasically \n&gt; &quot;DELETE means you should delete.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy describes a very mathematical mode for HTTP (resource is a \nmapping \n&gt; etc.) and if the HTTP methods were described in those terms it \nwould be \n&gt; much easier to build interoperable software.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are hints that it was politics that prevented this from \nhappening \n&gt; the first time around, but what should we do about it now? Just \ntransmit \n&gt; the true meanings of the methods through mailing lists? Increment \nHTTP? \n&gt; Write an RFC clarifying? Wait for Roy&#39;s new protocol? I&#39;m being \nserious \n&gt; here: I think that there is a problem and a variety of solutions \nand am \n&gt; soliciting opinions on both issues.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
