Although I realize that URIs are opaque, I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; trying to have them look reasonable should people see them - \n&gt; &gt; the problem I&#39;m having is how to differentiate between &quot;give me \n&gt; &gt; a representation of the container&quot;, and &quot;give me a represenation \n&gt; &gt; of everything inside the container&quot;, without having the URIs \n&gt; &gt; seem very verbose.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to understand what the difference between a container&#39;s\n&gt; representation, and the container&#39;s representation of its \n&gt; subcontainers, is.  I\n&gt; thought they would be the same thing.  But perhaps this \n&gt; approach doesn&#39;t fit\n&gt; your situation well.  Or maybe the container resource should \n&gt; support both?\n\nI&#39;m actually working on a couple of different cases of this. One of them\nis where I have accounts (which have account data) that contain 0..n\nidentities (which have identity data). Another is where I have test\nsuites (with associated data) that have sets of client results (with\nresult data) and server implementations (with endpoint information).\n\nThe latter example doesn&#39;t fit my post 100%, since the container has 2\ndifferent classes of subcontainers. In this case I need to retain the\nsubcontainerX/ in the URI, to distinguish which subcontainer I&#39;m going\nfor.\n\nThe former, OTOH, fits quite well. Should my URIs be ( removed for\nbrevity):\n\nUC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/accounts\nUC2: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/accounts/1234\nUC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/accounts/1234/identities\nUC4: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/accounts/1234/identities/5678\n\nor \n\nUC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/ \nUC2: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234\nUC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/\nUC4: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/5678\n\nObviously, only works if the tree has only one subcontainer at each\nlevel.\n\n&gt; One thing I try to remember is that a URI could point to an \n&gt; entity that doesn&#39;t physically exist.  In other words, upon \n&gt; receiving a GET request, the server could determine that the \n&gt; URI is logical and maps (in some way only known to the \n&gt; server) to a physical one.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you might initially do a GET /foo, which returns a \n&gt; representation of the\n&gt; server&#39;s physical container resource /foo that indicates the \n&gt; relative URI\n&gt; &#39;containers&#39; would return a list of /foo sub-container \n&gt; representations.  Then,\n&gt; you could do a GET /foo/containers and go from there.\n\nUnderstood, in my current design to get the data in a container (UC2) I\ndo a GET http://hypothetical.com/service/container/1234/ which returns\nthis:\n&lt;Container xmlns=&quot;http://hypothetical.com/example&quot;\nxmlns:x=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;ContainerData1&gt;...&lt;/ContainerData1&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;ContainerDataN&gt;...&lt;/ContainerDataN&gt;\n  &lt;Subcontainers x:href=&quot;subcontainers/&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/Container&gt;\n\nChasing the Subcontainers link to get the list of subcontainers in a\ncontainer (UC3), I do a GET\nhttp://hypothetical.com/service/container/1234/subcontainers/ which\nreturn this:\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;Subcontainers xmlns=&quot;http://hypothetical.com/example&quot;\nxmlns:x=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Subcontainer x:href=&quot;1234/&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;Subcontainer x:href=&quot;5678/&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/Container&gt;\n\nThen going after subcontainer 5678 to get the data in the subcontainer\n(UC4), I do a GET on\nhttp://hypothetical.com/service/container/1234/subcontainers/5678/,\nwhich returns this:\n&lt;Subcontainer xmlns=&quot;http://hypothetical.com/example&quot;\nxmlns:x=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;SubcontainerData1&gt;...&lt;/SubcontainerData1&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;SubcontainerDataN&gt;...&lt;/SubcontainerDataN&gt;\n&lt;/Container&gt;\n\nMy concern was that these URIs get long, especially when you have\nseveral level of this pattern repeating itself.\n\n--Peter\nhttp://www.razorsoft.net/weblog\n\n\n"}}
