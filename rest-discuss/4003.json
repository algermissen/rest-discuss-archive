(in that sense, for example, directly\ncomparable to Corba).\n\nOTH, what Roy said in his last reply suggests that REST is also\nconsidered with knowledge representation issues. Is that correct?\n\n\nIf so:\nA fundamental concept in knowledge representation is to provide\nsurrogates for real-world subjects in order to provide &#39;electronic\nhandles&#39; for making assertions about the real-world things. Is\nthis thinking within the realm of REST itself?\n\nIf so:\nAre URIs intended to be these surrogates?\n\n\nMight seem like an awkward way to approach this, but it will\nhelp me understand.\n\nThanks.\n\nJan\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
