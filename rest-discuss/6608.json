Multiple\nontologies are enclosed in an rdf, and nearly-so for microformats.\n\nThe saving grace for micformats may be the rigid control wielded by\nTantek to ensure that there is a single namespace for microformats and a\nsingle recognised place where microformats are specified. If the\ncommunity split there may be more problems, but for now you could argue\nthat microformats are still describing a single ontology, though one\nthat is described in a modular fashion across multiple documents.\n\nMicroformats also have an edge over &quot;straight&quot; RESTafarianism. They have\na lot of source information to work from when devloping a standard. They\nwill only standardise encoding for information already widely published\non the web, and only when several attempts have already been made to\ndefine content types for the information. Their process is then to\ncherry-pick the best fits to examples in the wild.\n\nA similar approach may be able to be taken by RESTafarians defining new\ncontent types. Using information available on the web may still be a\nviable way to collect samples. As to how these would fit with\napplications that need to use the type, well that would still be\nsomething of an unknown.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
