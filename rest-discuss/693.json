HTTP1/...&quot; and response &quot;HTTP code message&quot; so client can\n&gt; identify server request just based on first lisne (starts with &quot;HTTP&quot;\n&gt; =&gt; response, otherwise try to interpet as request from server).\n&gt;\n&gt; i searched web but could not find anybody doing or even considering it\n&gt;  ...\n&gt;\n&gt; appreciate comments (and URLs)\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; alek\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
