Would it be correct\nto &quot;reserve&quot; a specific media-type for that type of user agent so my\napplication can skip the generation of a bunch of markup and metadata\nas a representation? And sometimes the reason is just that I don&#39;t\nwant to exhaust the user agent.\n\nAre there any rules to follow when deciding to NOT include a specific\npart of a representation for a specific media-type?
