Certainly the integration\n&gt; &gt; complexity is reduced. But OTOH the effort of reaching agreement on\n&gt; &gt; the common interface is increased.\n&gt;\n&gt; Who says agreement has to be reached at all?\n&gt;\n&gt; Take a look at the world: most real innovation occurs as the result of\n&gt; one or a few persons defining / implementing disruptive technology\n&gt; that has good survival characteristics.  Once &quot;in the wild,&quot; the\n&gt; masses simply adopt and adapt to this technology;  but once in the\n&gt; wild, this technology usually evolves slowly if at all.\n\nIn rare cases a proposal might be so instantly compelling that&#39;s it \nachieves widespread adoption without any kind of negotiation being \nneeded.\n\nBut let&#39;s face it ... that&#39;s pretty rare.\n\n&gt; (HTTP is certainly an example of this.)\n\nI think it almost certainly _isn&#39;t_ an example of this. Take a look \nthrough the HTTP WG archives and think how long it took for HTTP/1.1 to \nbe widely implemented and deployed.\n\n&gt; Very little if any innovation happens as the result of a\n&gt; consensus-making process.\n\nAgreed ... but we&#39;re not talking about innovation here, we&#39;re talking \nabout the adoption of common interfaces. Anyone with a bright idea can \nstrike out on their own, but it takes a different (and often more \nexpensive) kind of effort to get everyone else to follow.\n\n&gt; Progress is driven by unilateral invention, and the rest of the world\n&gt; just follows along.\n\nI admire your optimism, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t share it.\n\nAlso note that continuous unilateral innovation is _disruptive_ of \nexisting standards ... a good thing IMO, and one which I think supports \nmy argument.\n\n&gt; Hence, optimizing a software architecture on its ability to minimize\n&gt; consensus-making efforts among its users is, IMHO, of little real\n&gt; value --- *particularly* if doing so increases the cost of its actual\n&gt; deployment and usage in the field.\n\nWell, YMMV ...\n\n&gt; &gt; For multiple interfaces that&#39;d give us,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  O(NlogN)   cost of integration (ie. NlogN implemented interfaces) \n&gt; &gt;  O(NlogN)   cost of agreement   (ie. NlogN bilateral agreements)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For a common interface it&#39;d give us,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   O(N)      cost of integration\n&gt; &gt;   O(2^N)    cost of agreement\n&gt;\n&gt; Modification:  need to &quot;weight&quot; these costs.\n\nUmm ... big-Oh means I _don&#39;t_ need to weight anything.\n\nBut yes, to relate these to euro/dollar prices they clearly need \nweighting. Nevertheless, 2^N will be bigger than NlogN for some values \nof N and the constant factors.\n\n&gt; As mentioned above, I believe that the top weight is in practice much\n&gt; greater than the bottom weight;  lots of effort gets spent on\n&gt; agreement, but most real progress happens by fiat or near-fiat.  (Case\n&gt; study:  rate of RFCs from IETF modulo number of participants at IETF\n&gt; meetings over history;  standards evolution through RFCs.)\n\nWithout numbers to attach to this, your belief is just as speculative as \nmy conjectures. FWIW, I don&#39;t think measuring the raw number of \npublished RFC is a particularly useful metric. Measuring the number of \nRFC that actually make it to STD or BCP might be more useful. Measuring \nthe number of those that are actually widely deployed would be even \nmore useful. And raw numbers of IETF participants isn&#39;t a useful metric \neither ... we really need a measure of the true costs (work hours, \nplane trips, implementation costs to achieve interoperability etc.).\n\n&gt; &gt; Notice that the cost of agreement won&#39;t scale down to the typical\n&gt; &gt; case for the common interface in the same way as it does for\n&gt; &gt; multiple interfaces, because the common interface still requires\n&gt; &gt; global agreement whether or not all parties need to communicate\n&gt; &gt; with each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be interesting to consider what the far-reaching\n&gt; implications are when you start with a bias of &quot;everyone needs to *be\n&gt; able to* talk to everyone else&quot; vs. &quot;each party only needs to be able\n&gt; to talk to certain other parties.&quot;  Also interesting:  whether and to\n&gt; what extent assumption of a priori knowledge of &quot;co-communicants&quot; has\n&gt; any impact.\n\nAgreed.\n\nAs I said, I only have a conjecture and some anecdotal evidence. It&#39;d be \nvery interesting to see some serious research work done on this.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
