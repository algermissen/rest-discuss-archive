The\n&gt; importance of media types (data!) is evidence of this vital aspect of\n&gt; implementing distributed systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many developers I encounter continue to focus primarily on the\n&gt; components of the system rather than the data passed between them. It\n&gt; is understandable since most education, software tooling, and\n&gt; valuation within the developer community continues to place components\n&gt; above the data these components process.\n\nI agree. It also echoes one of the rules stated in the Basics of unix\nphilosophy as stated by Eric S. Raymond:\n\nRule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can\nbe stupid and robust\n(http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2878263).\n\nI also think that media types are very central to REST. But one\nproblem today is that, apart from XHTML and Atom, there are few\n*general* and data-oriented mediatypes with good hyperlink support.\nThere are some interesting efforts that have been mentioned on this\nmailing list, but it seems many are looking for a JSON-based or\nJSON-style alternative to XHTML and Atom.\n\nToday a colleague of mine and I discussed an approach where JSON could\nbe syntactically be extended with a new value &quot;hyperlink&quot; with support\nfor the basic hyperlink attributes (href, type, method and rel).\n\nAt the same time, the last thing we need is an overproliferation of\noverspecified and custom mediatypes. This would introduce tighter\ncoupling and could lead to evolvability problems which is precisely\none of the problems REST is trying to adress and solve. Overspecified\nand custom mediatypes means going in the direction of typed\ninterfaces, which I think is one of *the* major problems with SOAP.\nThe web is not recompiled every morning - yet it works!\n\n/Paul\n\n--\nPaul Cohen\nwww.seibostudios.se\nmobile: +46 730 787 035\ne-mail: paul.cohen@...\n\n"}}
