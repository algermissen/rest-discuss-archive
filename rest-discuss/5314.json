Most of my issues were coming from the browser \n(web-techie) side of the equation where I wanted to do composition and \nneeded some precision that I couldn&#39;t rely on precisely enough from \ncontent negotiation.\n\nthanks\n\nJeff\n\nJeoff Wilks wrote:\n\n&gt; All good points, Jon. If Jeff is looking to guarantee that some \n&gt; clients receive an HTML representation, others an XML representation, \n&gt; etc. (without relying on content negotiation) then it is appropriate \n&gt; to use the direct URIs for each desired variant.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 10/17/05, *Jon Hanna* &lt;jon@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jon@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Jeoff Wilks wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; Hey Jeff,\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I also struggled with the same issue you have. One thing I\n&gt;     noticed while\n&gt;     &gt; reading through the Apache docs on content negotiation is that,\n&gt;     though\n&gt;     &gt; you can request a resource for which multiple representations\n&gt;     exist, you\n&gt;     &gt; can also request a specific variant using its exact URI. Look at the\n&gt;     &gt; table at the bottom of this web page for examples:\n&gt;     &gt; http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/content-negotiation.html\n&gt;     &lt;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/content-negotiation.html&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Building on the example from that web page, assume you have a\n&gt;     resource\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;foo&quot; for which various representations exist.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; /foo\n&gt;     &gt; /foo.html\n&gt;     &gt; /foo.xml\n&gt;     &gt; /foo.rss\n&gt;\n&gt;     To my mind /foo.html should not be considered as a URI for the same\n&gt;     resources as /foo\n&gt;\n&gt;     /foo.html is suitable when the resource you are interested is the HTML\n&gt;     representation of /foo in and off itself. GET /foo says &quot;let me know\n&gt;     about foo&quot; GET /foo.html says &quot;let me know about the HTML document you\n&gt;     happen to be using to represent /foo&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;     One would hope that outside of web-techies more users of the system\n&gt;     would be interested in /foo than in /foo.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jeoff Wilks\n&gt; (703) 683-2753\n&gt; (703) 964-7368 mobile \n\n\n\n\n"}}
