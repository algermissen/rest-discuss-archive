All that said, I think the presentation \ndoes a nice job of describing REST&#39;s real benefits.\n\n-peter keane\ndaseproject.org\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 5 Nov 2007, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n\n&gt; I recently presented on REST vs. SOA at a BeJUG (Belgian Java User\n&gt; Group) event - I&#39;d appreciate your comments/corrections:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/11/04/rest_talk_at_bejug_video.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Slides are available online, too:\n&gt; http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/10/09/rest_vs_soa_presentation.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n\n"}}
