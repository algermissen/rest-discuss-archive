If I wa=\r\nnt to create a new customer instance, I could POST a representation of that=\r\n customer to the collection resource. The server returns a &quot;201 created&quot; an=\r\nd the URI of the new customer instance, maybe &#39;/customers/1234&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now =\r\nlet&#39;s say I need to update this particular customer entity with new informa=\r\ntion. I could PUT the new description to the instance URI or I could POST i=\r\nt. Since &#39;/customers/1234&#39; is not a collection resource there is no ambigui=\r\nty about what I want: Update this particular customer instance.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is th=\r\nere a problem with that approach?\n&gt;\n&gt; No. If the semantics of the resource =\r\nare appropriately defined you can use POST to update the resource state.\n\nS=\r\nemantics of the resource, or semantics of the link relation? I always\nlook =\r\nat it as the latter\n\n&gt; What you loose is visibility because no intermediary=\r\n is able to see that there is actually an update going on.\n\nThe loss in vis=\r\nibility isn&#39;t over update since both PUT and POST\nmethods are unsafe, and s=\r\no from an intermediary perspective both\nupdate/invalidate state. The actual=\r\n loss in visibility is much more\nsubtle and is over the specific nature of =\r\nthe updating request i.e.\nomitting PUT removes the opportunity for intermed=\r\niaries to\ndistinguish, for example, between an idempotent and non-idempoten=\r\nt\nupdate. That&#39;s often not such a big deal - what types of intermediary\nmec=\r\nhanism are you thinking of that would require that level of\nvisibility? The=\r\n web&#39;s GET/POST, View/Do-ism seems to have provided\nenough visibility so fa=\r\nr\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
