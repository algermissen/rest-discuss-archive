So how can REST alone be the basis\n&gt; for any applied-software-architecture Implementation?  The Model  \n&gt; should\n&gt; therefore address issues like isolation, concurrency and storage based\n&gt; on the REST-agnostic laws of long-running systems.  These laws clearly\n&gt; apply to the goals of any system that needs REST in the first place.\n\n\nRESTs primary goal is not fault tolerance but decentralized evolution,  \nscalability and simplicity. REST&#39;s focus is coordination of components  \nowned by independent parties. I think the comparision you try to make  \nis a bit problematic.\n\nHowever, there is certainly a lot of overlap between the area of  \napplication. The stateless server constraint for example enables live  \nserver upgrade and the hypermedia constraint even enables changing the  \nserver side state machine while the client is stepping through it from  \nhyperlink to hyperlink.\n\nIn fact I find it hard to see how you could achieve better fault  \ntolerance regarding the component communication than the fault  \ntolerance you have with TCP/IP, DNS and HTTP.\n\nJan\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
