Mostly I&#39;m testing with &#39;curl -I&#39;\nand &#39;curl -I -b&#39;, but it&#39;s easier to get a feel for the system using\nFirefox/IE + HttpWatch -- I couldn&#39;t have built this without HttpWatch.\n\nHere&#39;s a list of the features I&#39;ve added in to the demo under /conneg/:\n\nNegotiated resources:\n\nAll ending in &#39;/&#39; or &#39;/{#}&#39; or &#39;/comment-{#}&#39; Vary: Cookie, Accept\n/conneg/skin/csi.xsl Vary: Cookie\n/conneg/skin/style.css Vary: Cookie\nnegotiating the fixed style references allows skin switching without\nrequiring the negotiated URIs to have variants for those, also\nauth-based conneg pending for Xforms (coming soon) support resources\n\nPagination:\n\nAll ending in &#39;/&#39;, i.e. /conneg/?page=2\nAll index.atom, i.e. /conneg/index.atom?page=2\npage != # returns 400; no pagination is 404, ?page=1 301-cancels\nrequesting a page for other resources is (rather, should be) 400\n\nServer-side XPointer service:\n\nAll ending in &#39;/{#}.atom&#39; allow //@thr:count, i.e.:\n/conneg/2006/aug/09/11.atom?xptr=(//@thr:count)\nreturns application/json with entity = {#}\nrequesting an xptr for other resources, or unapproved xptr, is 400\n\nMatrix URIs:\n\nAll negotiated resources except CSS/XSLT allow parameters in this order,\npreceding query string:\n/conneg/;view=(main|xfm|reset);type=(xhtm|xml|html|txml|txt|reset)\n/conneg/;type=xhtm;view=xfm would first 301-redirect to \n/conneg/;view=xfm;type=xhtm\nor may be reset outright:\n/conneg/;reset (uses 307 not 303)\n(I call this &#39;curli&#39;, meaning command-line-interface for URLs)\n\nVariant Cookies:\n\ntype= set after Accept-based negotiation, or can bypass Accept conneg\nview= only set if matrix URI ;view=xfm\n(view|type)=reset unsets one or the other or both cookies, or does\nnothing if view=reset and no view cookie is present (the default)\ncurli=true forces a 200 response when a cookie is changed, instead of a\n304 response, which is why negotiated resources must-revalidate\n(returning to a cached resource may still require a reload; seems\nsome browsers ignore must-revalidate with Vary: Cookie when the cookie\nchanges, I&#39;ll be filing some bug reports)\n\nContent-Location:\n\nThe only reason the view cookie isn&#39;t restricted to /conneg/skin/ is so\nthat C-L always reflects how to bookmark what the user is currently\nviewing, i.e. /conneg/;view=main;type=xhtm?page=2&xptr=(foo) is the\nwell-formed syntax assuming some future combination of page and xptr.\n\nContent-Disposition:\n\nnegotiated resources translate ;type= into filename extensions, all C-D\nURIs are 404s...\n\n---------------\n\nAlthough, it is possible by design to directly dereference the variant\nXSLT and CSS files driving skin-switching (the feature responsible for\nall my cookie madness).\n\nOK, folks, have at it!  Let me know of any bugs you find, or attempt to\npersuade me that my use of cookies (or anything else I&#39;m doing) violates\nREST somehow... bearing in mind those cookies have nothing to do with\nstoring application state on the server.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
