And consensus is defined as general agreement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps you are making a distinction based on the degree of unanimity of the\n&gt; consensus. That is, you do not think complete agreement is required. If so,\n&gt; I agree. But it is my understanding that all IETF &quot;standards&quot; require rough\n&gt; consensus and running code. So I don&#39;t think seeking rough consensus will\n&gt; get us into big trouble, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m looking for. I think a lack\n&gt; thereof will get us into trouble.\n\n&quot;Rough concensus and running code&quot; is for when you&#39;re working on a\nspec.  My point is that we&#39;ve already got a spec, and no matter what\nwe might agree to here, folks will look to the spec for the answer,\nnot us.\n\nThat&#39;s not to say that we can&#39;t improve the wording for 2616bis though.\n\n&gt; I was hoping such rough consensus had been reached in some forum I was not\n&gt; aware of, but it seems instead that it has not yet been reached.\n\nI dunno.  Does anybody disagree with &quot;set the state of the targetted\nresource to that represented in the provided representation?&quot;  I\nsuppose that question should really be asked on ietf-http-wg though.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
