There&#39;s\nsome way to discover the entire system using any entry point.\n\nWebsites do this all the time.  The homepage can get you just about anywhere\non the site through a degree of separation, and everything links back to the\nhomepage.  If you access the website with a bookmark any where on the site\nand still link to every other available resource with some set of clicks and\nform entries.\n\nAll of the REST APIs that I&#39;ve seen have:\n- resources that are commonly bookmarked but no other resources link back to\nthem.\n- closed subsystems -- resources that interlink but don&#39;t link to the rest\nof the API.\n\nIn other words clients of those REST APIs *must* use some out of band\ninformation, such as human readable API documentation, in order to invoke\nfunctionality.  Perhaps it&#39;s a problem with the API&#39;s media types not\ninterlinking.  However, even if the media types did fully interlink, I\nsimply haven&#39;t seen any client-side techniques to perform that discovery of\nthat interlinking in a clean systemic way.\n\nThe problem here is either:\n\nA) I don&#39;t get it.  I&#39;m missing something fundamental.\nB) There&#39;s more work to be done here, but it&#39;s doable.
