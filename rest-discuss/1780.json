Explain further?\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking along the lines of locking for exclusivity not for versioning\n&gt; (the queue thing was a bit of a red herring), i.e. semaphores/resource\n&gt; locks, Thinking on it further, the immutability probably has no influence at\n&gt; all. If you use a basic lock file approach, either the file is there or not\n&gt; and assuming that delete actually does delete the lock file and not simply\n&gt; remove the mapping link (so that you end up with a multitude of unlinked old\n&gt; lock file versions somewhere in your file system) then all is well.\n\nCorrect.  Immutability probably doesn&#39;t do away with the need for semaphores\n/ etc. for the purpose of synchronization where it&#39;s truly needed --- but my\npoint is that with immutability and complete version history, you can avoid\nmany synchronization situations.  The issue becomes not &quot;canonically right\nat any given instant&quot; but rather &quot;determination of the canonically right\nstate on demand.&quot;\n\nBTW, please note that a combination of immutable stored files, a heuristic\nthat says &quot;canonical version is the latest version&quot;, and a mechanism that\nlets you access historical versions via various criteria gives you something\nthat has the overt last-writer-wins semantics of filesystems absent file\nlocking *and* CVS-like versioning, w/o explicit check-in/check-out.\n\nCheers,\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
