Here are some off-the-top (hopefully not over-the-top ;-)\n&gt; thoughts about these issues...\n&gt; \n&gt; (1)  Side-effects.  I&#39;m not 100% convinced its correct to view the\n&gt; notification request behavior as a side-effect.  It doesn&#39;t actually impact\n&gt; the content returned beyond adding a header and *later* producing an effect\n&gt; that wouldn&#39;t exist otherwise; \n\nThe server needs to change state to remember the request. That sounds\nlike a side-effect to me.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; (3) It should be possible to force the request through the proxy from the\n&gt; subscriber end of things through the use of other proxy directive headers in\n&gt; combination...  right?\n\nI suppose so.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
