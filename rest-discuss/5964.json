And the\n&gt;&gt; information which allows you to see how it is different is not\n&gt;&gt; available in the request, it&#39;s stored in the &quot;session&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; Well, every time I access a page representing a stock ticker, it could \n&gt; be different, too.  Every time I access a Wikipedia article, it could be \n&gt; different.  And the information about how the Wikipedia article is \n&gt; different, if I&#39;m lucky, is buried in the form of English text in the \n&gt; related discuss page.\n\nBut this:\n\n  &lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n  This page has been accessed &lt;img src=&quot;/stockticker.jpg&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n  &lt;/html&gt;\n\nis complying with REST by representing the state in separate resources\nand not hidden away from the resources.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; The above example is also a good illustration of why sessions are\n&gt;&gt; bad. It is clearly unscalable to do the above. You can start fixing\n&gt;&gt; that scalability problem by throwing money at bea or whoever... but\n&gt;&gt; that way is very expensive. \n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing you mean because the session state is presumably kept local \n&gt; to one server.  I don&#39;t know how the &quot;session&quot; object in JSP is \n&gt; implemented.  For all I know it could come from a distributed\n&gt; database.\n\nIt could do. Typically it does not but that&#39;s certainly what the whole\nweb facing part of J2EE is about.\n\nBut this is very complicated. OO bindings to RDBMS and so forth. Much\nmore complicated than storing resources in a db for example.\n\n\n&gt; Suppose, instead of using a &quot;session&quot; object in JSP, I used a separate \n&gt; resource, accessible by a URL.  Then if that resource was changed, how \n&gt; would the change be propagated to all the other servers in the farm?  \n&gt; Seems you have the same problem, with a session object, or with a \n&gt; &quot;resource&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s true. It&#39;s more complicated though because you&#39;ve still got 2\nthings instead of one (a resource and the session).\n\nBut consider the scalability implications of never being able to have\nan intermediary cache the resource (because you don&#39;t know when it\nwill change).\n\nIn badly designed J2EE apps I&#39;ve been involved with there is a lot of\neffort spent on trying to enforce a lack of caching. Poorly\nimplemented caches seem quite common.\n\nIf they were done right with the state in the resource we wouldn&#39;t\nhave to do that.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
