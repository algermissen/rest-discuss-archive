It might be necessary for clients and servers to\n&gt;&gt; exchange additional o=\r\nut-of-band information on the proper way to form\n&gt;&gt; the message for a parti=\r\ncular media type (element names, order, etc.),\n&gt;&gt; but that descriptive info=\r\nrmation is something else.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that out-of-band info &quot;allowed&quot; from a=\r\n REST perspective? I&#39;ve always assumed that constraints on a general media =\r\ntypes must be communicated in hypermedia (just like the URI). In other word=\r\ns, you need something like a &lt;form&gt;. Is that not the case?\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I sup=\r\npose the &quot;form&quot; constraints could also be fixed. ie. the definition of appl=\r\nication/orderform+xml describes the constraints on application/x-form-urlen=\r\ncoded requests so no run-time info is needed. Still, the available choices =\r\nare a) something specific in the definition of the media type(s) or b) some=\r\nthing communicated at run-time in hypermedia (or a combination of a and b).=\r\n Make sense?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally, the details of the entity body are only intere=\r\nsting to the\n&gt;&gt; two parties involved in the message (sender, receiver). Fro=\r\nm the\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries POV, they need to no nothing about this body - in f=\r\nact\n&gt;&gt; should not be peeking into the body at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that actually a c=\r\nonstraint? Some protocols, like SIP, place explicit restrictions on what a =\r\nproxy can do with the body.
