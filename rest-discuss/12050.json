After all, HTTP is really the RESTful protocol being used, so the \nverbs are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and even though the URL has \nverbs in it, it&#39;s still just the address for the resource, right?\n\nI can, however, see the argument against verbs in the URL (I think), \nsince the implication is that the URLs then become the API to the \napplication, causing a diversity of actions, rather than a diversity of \nresources. Is this the main argument against using verbs in the URL?\n\n-Ben\n\n\n"}}
