If you offer notification,\n&gt; &gt; you create URLs which represent the stream of\n&gt; &gt; changes to some other URL (or collection of URLs).\n&gt; &gt; The recipient then gets a chunk encoded stream of\n&gt; &gt; update messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a weird abuse of HTTP. Chunks are supposed to be used to make\n&gt; data flow more efficient, not to indicate changes in state across time.\n&gt; An intermediary might choose to group chunks to merge them or re-chunk\n&gt; for performance reasons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Data formats are about the structure of bytes in a stream.\n&gt;\n&gt; Protocols are about the timing of when data moves across a pipe. You&#39;re\n&gt; abusing a data format (mime/multipart) to invent a new protocol. REST\n&gt; philosophy (like Mao Zedung-thought) says you shouldn&#39;t have to do that.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
