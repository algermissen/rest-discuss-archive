For quite sometime I thought that WebServices\nshould be more URI based, so I was glad to find that\nthere is the whole theory behind that :). While I am\ntrying to catch up with the REST literature I have a\nquestion of a more practicle  nature. I am wondering\nif there is an outgoing Open Source effort(s) which\nhave a goal to build a web services infrustucture\naround REST principles.\n\nThanks Alexi.\n\n\n"}}
