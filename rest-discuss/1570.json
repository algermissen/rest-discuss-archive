The parts-depot accepts parts orders.  The RPG\ngame server accepts &quot;action&quot; orders.\n\nI submit that this is not much different than invoking a method of an\nobject.  The method is encapsulated in the XML order document which requires\nthat the order taker understand what the methods mean for this to work.\n\nThe reason this is better than RPC is that this mechanism is loosely coupled\nat the protocol layer, whereas RPC requires explicit bindings at the\nprotocol layer.\n\nBut, let&#39;s not deceive ourselves about the extent of the loose-coupling.  It\nis only loosely coupled as far as generic URI manipulation is concerned\n(passing a link, sorting links, ranking, etc).  If the RPG server stops\nunderstanding the action &quot;attack&quot;, the clients still break.\n\nWe simply moved the brittleness or fragility up to the application level\nwhere it belongs.  Certain applications will remain brittle whether it is\nRESTful at the protocol level or not - only good design will ameliorate\nbrittleness.\n\nREST works wonderfully in a document/data retrieval and hyperlinking\napplication because the methods for documents and data are essentially GET,\nPUT, POST, and DELETE.  For this specific application, those are the most\nimportant verbs.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not true for action-oriented services.  Encapsulating\nwhat we want the server to *do* into an order is again simply pushing the\ndifficulties of application-specific verbs into the application level (where\nI agree it belongs).  However, we won&#39;t get same complete benefit that the\ndocument/data web enjoys with having the real semantics of GET, PUT, POST,\nDELETE be totally applicable and sufficient for that application.\n\nLet&#39;s get back to verb URIs.  I think the insistence on not having verbs in\nURIs makes total sense for a document/data web.  It doesn&#39;t make as much\nsense for a services-oriented web.  We are already creating fragility by\nusing verbs in the orders but we are not getting the benefit of having the\nverbs be addressable directly.\n\nUltimately, if we want to push REST as a way to implement action-oriented\nweb services, we need to extend REST to support method invocation in a\nconsistent and convenient way.  If not, we will need to have some other\ndefining architecture which leverages URIs and loose-coupling as an\nalternative to RPC.\n\n//Joe\n\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
