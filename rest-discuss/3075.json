The Resource is a user typing into a chat field at random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times (GET http://britney-oracle/what-she-says-now)\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://britney-oracle/what-she-says-now%29&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the &#39;what-she-says-now&#39; has state of what she said in the past N\n&gt; &gt; minutes,\n&gt; &gt; then doing a GET for a snapshot would work. But if it is a buffer that\n&gt; &gt; gets\n&gt; &gt; cleared out pretty fast, doing a GET would result in getting from an\nempty\n&gt; &gt; buffer.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s easy to model the chat session as a resource and get message. Once\n&gt; &gt; again, see KnowNow&#39;s stuff.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What I&#39;m saying is, not the state in the past N minutes, but the state\n&gt; from the point the GET was received, onwards.  So it would indeed be\n&gt; nothing at the time, and would be an HTTP/1.1 chunk per pearl of wisdom\n&gt; from then on, as it was cast.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you be kind enough to elaborate a little on this (the what KnowNow\n&gt; does, chat part)?\nWhat KN does is provide a resource that is a set of past and future events.\nUsing query terms the client can specify what range they would like -\nincluding &#39;all future events&#39;. I think of it as a GET on the future.\nThey have multiple types clients, including a JavaScript in the browser\nclient.\nYou can see a live example at\nhttp://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn_apps/amazonpop/ - its an example I wrote\nthat monitors the top selling items on Amazon. The page listens to a\nparticular topic for incoming events.\nThere is an &#39;add comment&#39; on the top right of the page & when a new comment\nshows up, I put it on the screen using IE5 nifty node.innerHTML stuff.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, anyway, just &#39;cos KnowNow does it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s pure as\n&gt; newly-laid snow to rest-discussers......  !!\nWhat KN does isn&#39;t always very RESTful but it is very useful.\n\n\n\n"}}
