Thoroughly specified\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; schemas describing almost every possible Purchase Order Request and\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Response. Guess how long it takes one large computer manufacturer to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; shake out enough impedance mismatches to get going with each new\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; trading partner? 30-60 days, and that is a dedicated team of experts\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and \n&gt; resolving\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Bad standards exist, therefore standards are bad. Nice logic.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a valid conclusion. RosettaNet is not a bad\n&gt;  &gt; standard. As I wrote in another post, it is the third generation of\n&gt;  &gt; ecommerce standards that each tried to learn from and resolve the\n&gt;  &gt; problems of the previous generation. Each was better than its\n&gt;  &gt; predecessor. So by the Microsoft rule, RosettaNet should have been\n&gt;  &gt; pretty good.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s just a difficult problem.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly. RosettaNet is a great standard... the apotheosis of this\n&gt; style of exchanging full documents. My point is that style is not\n&gt; scalable, and that APP is using the same approach, on a smaller scale.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where to begin with this. I dislike muddled conversations \nwhen it comes to semantics.\n\nAll the business processing standards I&#39;ve seen are inherently \nnon-scalable, if by non-scalable you mean the number of actors that can \nshare information without resorting to effort in out of band agreements. \nThat XForms has a means of exception management (show it to a person) \nand does schema validation in advance via constraints instead of \ndefensive programming doesn&#39;t have me thinking it&#39;s any more applicable \nor valuable than using Atom - indeed it has me thinking it&#39;s going to be \nriddled with security holes because to honor an xform constraint you \nneed a trustworthy client.\n\nIn the general case this a symbolic AI problem. If you want to move \nfurther along, the applicable state of the art here are denotational \nsemantics as used in KR, RDF interchange, or agent based systems like \nFIPA. No-one seems to be sure how to design such things in a way that \nthey garner wide adoption on existing infrastructure.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
