So, if I want to send a message to an HTTP\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; server and have it call back my HTTP server later,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how do I specify that?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think you answered this one at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/38\n\nGreat.  So the answer is the same as MIME-RPC.\nAdd another mime header.  As I said before, I\nthink we are largely in agreement on most things.\nI think MIME-RPC formalizes much of the wire\nlevel stuff REST proponents advocate.\n\nThe main difference between Reply-To as\ndescribed in this message and Reply-To-URL as\ndescribed in the MIME-RPC spec is that the later\nis suitable for use both in email and in HTTP\nwhile the former only works in HTTP.\n\nThe main point of REST seems to be that things\nshould exist in terms of URIs, but it seems to\ninsist on only allowing HTTP uris.   Why not allow\nHTTPS URIs or mailto uris?\n\n&gt; &gt; I completely agree.  In MIME, that record format\n&gt; &gt; is called a &quot;content-type&quot;.  MIME even defines a\n&gt; &gt; procedure for getting organizations to agree on\n&gt; &gt; the name for that type. It is RFC 2048.  With\n&gt; &gt; MIME-RPC, you would send e.g.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; content-type: application/x-employee\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OPAQUE DATA THAT IS INTERPRETED BY A MIME-RPC\n&gt; &gt; IMPLEMENTATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPEC FOR\n&gt; &gt; THIS FORMAT -- THE FORMAT MIGHT BE BINARY!!!\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, but that&#39;s just *MIME*. MIME-RPC is adding no value here!\n\nIf REST is just using the existing web, then I\nwould ask the same question of REST.\n\nMIME-RPC simply formalizes common practice\nin using MIME for messaging to applications rather\nthan people.  The value it provides is simply a\nformalization of existing practice.\n\nI think REST provides a philosophy. MIME-RPC\nprovides a wire format.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; MIME-RPC encourages #2.  The point is that for\n&gt; &gt; massive interoperability, applications need to be\n&gt; &gt; able to send each other messages that may include\n&gt; &gt; objects of various types packaged together.  MIME\n&gt; &gt; is a well defined and well used mechanism for\n&gt; &gt; doing exactly that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nobody disputes the value of MIME. For a while, even Microsoft was in\n&gt; favor...before they invented &quot;DIME&quot;. I&#39;m asking about the value of\n&gt; MIME-RPC. Adding RPC to MIME is not exciting to a REST-er since REST is\n&gt; an alternative model to RPC!\n\nPlease define your use of RPC.  My use of RPC is\nsimply that the recipient of the message is an\napplication rather than a person.\n\nI think we are in agreement about most things.  I\nam just trying to provide a short reference\ndocument for application developers.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
