In order to being able to make such an assumptions, the\n&gt; classification information must be made available by the service. In\n&gt; addition, when client developers should be enabled to develop clients\n&gt; before the services exist this information is needed as some form of\n&gt; service type description. The specification of application/atomsrv+xml\n&gt; is a good example of such a service type description.\n&gt;\n&gt; But however this is approached, it essentially comes down to telling\n&gt; the client what kinds of resources (IOW: kinds of application states)\n&gt; to expect on the server. I just cannot code to update the resource\n&gt; foo:status when I have now clue that this user goal is applicable to\n&gt; the resource in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have an idea how to align this (IMHO fact) with the\n&gt; constraint that no information about resource types must be made\n&gt; available to clients in RESTful systems?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. In human driven interactions the situation is different: We still\n&gt; have knowledge of the resource type iin general (we know a trouble\n&gt; ticket when we see one) but we are not dependent on knowing that the\n&gt; result of some interaction will be a trouble ticket. We can allways\n&gt; follow some human-targeted links and make a few hops to reach the\n&gt; trouble ticket resource we expect should be &#39;somwehere&#39;. M2M clients\n&gt; do not have that luxury (unless we apply some form of AI I guess).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
