My application does not conform to principles of REST at this\nti me but I want to know how to do this in a secure REST way so that\nthe browser need not log-in.  Regeneration of password could be a use\ncase when the old one is lost. So in this case the user cannot login\nuntil he answers some security questions but allowing a user to enter\na web application without logging in is a problem.\n\nIf I send a link in an email for regeneration of a password then that\nlink has to expire after a certain number of days. The url should\nbecome stale. How can I treat a particular url stale after a certain\nperiod ? I can store the time when the url was generated in the\ndatabase but all url&#39;s will look the same in this case.\n\nThis seems to be a very common usecase.\n\nThanks,\nMohan\n\n"}}
