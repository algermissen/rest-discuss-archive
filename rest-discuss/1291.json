When Axis is deployed as a servlet, one can map a\n&gt;&gt; url-pattern to the AxisServlet.  One can then deploy a transport specific\n&gt;&gt; handler which obtains the relative path and does something appropriate with\n&gt;&gt; that information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this simple or rocket science? Maybe you could write a tutorial one\n&gt; day.\n\nMy current feeling is that whatever I write - even if it directly addresses\na question or concern you have expressed - you will pick it apart and call\nit names, so forgive me if I continue to seek to confirm to my satisfaction\nthat there is the possibility of finding common ground before proceeding on\nthis suggestion.  Meanwhile, here are two pointers if you would like to\npursue it further.\n\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/xml-axis/java/webapps/axis/WEB-INF/web.xml\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/xml-axis/java/src/org/apache/axis/handlers/http/URLMapper.java\n\n&gt; &quot;Applications communicate with the transport protocols through the use\n&gt; of &#39;ports&#39; which are unique I/O identifiers used by the ransport\n&gt; protocols and hte specific instance of the application protocol.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just as every device on an IP network has a unique IP address, every\n&gt; instance of every application protocol also has a unique port number\n&gt; that is used to identify it to the transport protocols on the local\n&gt; system.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * &quot;Internet Core Protocols&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It is my belief that a protocol should have a port number if and only if\n&gt; it is an application protocol. I define application protocol as a\n&gt; protocol that has a concept of:\n&gt;\n&gt; a) addressable data objects\n&gt; b) standardized methods on those data objects\n&gt; c) standardized semantics for those methods\n&gt;\n&gt; This definition holds for FTP, HTTP, SMTP, NNTP etc. It doesn&#39;t hold for\n&gt; SOAP, DCOM, RMI, etc. Individual applications *built on top of* SOAP,\n&gt; DCOM, and RMI should have ports.\n\nMy perception is that amazon.com&#39;s shopping basket is an application built\nupon HTTP.  Care to comment?\n\n&gt; Summary: You can build synchrony on top of asynchrony or vice versa.\n\nI view that statement as akin to the statement that all computers are\nTuring complete.  A true statement, but one that misses a number of\nimportant subtleties.\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
