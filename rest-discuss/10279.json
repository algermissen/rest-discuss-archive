But I&#39;m instead talking about &quot;standardizing&quot; a meta \n&gt; &gt; approach; IOW a method for traversing web services that 5 \n&gt; years from \n&gt; &gt; now could be built into browsers because it gained \n&gt; widespread usage.  \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to see a well-known way to publish that they are \n&gt; &quot;n&quot; number \n&gt; &gt; of services available, here are their local identifiers, their \n&gt; &gt; URLs/URI Templates, and here are the content types they \n&gt; return.  Local \n&gt; &gt; identifiers might be things like &quot;shopping-cart&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;add-item&quot;, &quot;empty-cart&quot;, and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t that the responsibility of HTML?\n\nUh, it can be. But riddle me this; given an abitrary HTML document, how does\nmy client figure out what URL is the &quot;add-item&quot; URL?  Or the &quot;empty-cart&quot;\nURL?  Or, or, or...?\n\nHTML (or JSON, or Atom, or, or, or...) are necessary, but not sufficient.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly I just re-read Joe Gregorio&#39;s rant against \n&gt; WADL [1] and \n&gt; &gt; find that I strongly agree with his mime-type centric view. So what \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m discussing wouldn&#39;t be at the level of a WADL which as he \n&gt; &gt; presented defines a service but instead something that \n&gt; lists available \n&gt; &gt; services for a human to review and that can also later be \n&gt; called by a \n&gt; &gt; program that traverses the list to support HATEOAS with \n&gt; eventual move \n&gt; &gt; toward a new mime-type with a defined spec for the use-case \n&gt; if it is generally applicable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, Joe made my point about internal vs. external using very \n&gt; &gt; different words but basically his point is that for \n&gt; internal you don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; necessarily have to worry about publishing standard mime-types, but \n&gt; &gt; for external you definitely do.  Given the lack of need to follow \n&gt; &gt; standards with internal services makes them more more \n&gt; likely to need to be changed.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s how we end up with super expensive enterprise software \n&gt; :-) \n\nWhat is how we end up with &quot;super expensive enterprise software?&quot;  Where do\nyou get that?  I am the *last* person you should assume advocates techniques\nfor expensive enterprise software. \n\n&gt; Things that work _also_ for the enterprise, like PHP or \n&gt; MySQL, tend to be very cheap.  Things that work _only_ for \n&gt; the enterprise, like J2EE and Oracle, tend to be more \n&gt; expensive.  \n\nFunny you say that, I&#39;ve never done any J2EE or Oracle work, ever.\nEverything I&#39;ve worked has been lightweight, scripting, and dynamic\nlanguages and I drive towards simple, not complex.  Matter of fact, I just\ngave a presentation on debugging PHP and MySQL at the Atlanta Drupal users\ngroup last Tuesday[1], and I&#39;ve been programming exclusively PHP and MySQL\nfor the past six months, experimented with Python+Sqlite, Ruby on Rails, and\nPowershell for the year prior, and mostly ASP+VBScript+SQL Server for the\n10+ years to that. So your assumptions about what I&#39;m advocating are off.\n:-)\n\n&gt; So wearing my enterprise hat, I say give me more \n&gt; of that stuff that works everywhere!  I don&#39;t have a hat like \n&gt; that, but I&#39;m looking at the trends around open source, \n&gt; dynamic languages, and what the cool CIOs are calling \n&gt; Enterprise 2.0, and it looks like this just might be the \n&gt; shape of things to come.\n\nI have absolutely no disagreement with that paragraph, but your other\ncomments seem incongruous.\n\n&gt; And I fully agree with that.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, that&#39;s one of the things that turned me away from \n&gt; REST initially.  I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s essential for REST, \n&gt; just that a lot of people were arguing for it and no other \n&gt; way.  So first I said no, and they I relented and decide to \n&gt; HATEOAS all the way, and after the learning period was over, \n&gt; on a clean slate project I found to my dismay that:\n&gt; a)  It took me way too much time to do that, but the 80/20 \n&gt; rule does apply, the first 80% was a breeze, I should have \n&gt; stopped there.\n&gt; b)  And it took more time than it would take to fix \n&gt; hard-coded URLs, should they ever break.\n&gt; c)  A task which could easily be automated given machine \n&gt; processable specification.\n\nSo that last point, &quot;c)&quot;, is what we should tackle.  We don&#39;t have that\nspec; let&#39;s work together (with all the others on this list) to define it.\n\n&gt; Let me give you an example.  I&#39;m writing a task manager (aka work\n&gt; list) service, and one thing you can do is troll your list of \n&gt; pending tasks, maybe you want to write a script that collects \n&gt; them and e-mails to someone else.\n&gt; \n&gt; So one option is to have a URL form which you can get a list \n&gt; of people, so you can find one specific person, from which \n&gt; you can get all that person&#39;s URLs (pending, completed, \n&gt; cancelled, etc) from which you can get the specific task \n&gt; list.  That places a burden on the client, not to mention the \n&gt; service (e.g. current implementation doesn&#39;t even have a list \n&gt; of people you can query, people are listed in LDAP).\n\nI agree 100%\n\n&gt; Another option is to give you a URL template, you plug your \n&gt; name into it, and with one line of curl get the result.  And \n&gt; writing a one-line curl script that pipes to sendmail is so \n&gt; trivial, a big point in favor of URL templates.\n\nAgain, agree.\n\n&gt; The list of pending task for a person is designated as an \n&gt; &quot;entry point&quot;, so the template exists and properly specified. \n&gt;  And as you pointed out, the semantics will change several \n&gt; times over before the URLs do, so worrying about URLs \n&gt; breaking for this case is like worrying about swiss cheese \n&gt; having holes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there are attachments.  You can go from a task to the \n&gt; list of attachments and retrieve those as well.  You can \n&gt; assume there&#39;s some URL template for attachment, and you&#39;ll \n&gt; be right.  It does exist, it&#39;s just unspecified.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone may want to store those attachments in a content \n&gt; repository, or file server, or some other product and we \n&gt; allow for that.  Except, those URLs do not conform to the \n&gt; same template we use, and you can&#39;t even easily redirect from \n&gt; one to the other because there&#39;s no logical mapping from our \n&gt; organization scheme to theirs.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what we have is a specification that defines certain URL \n&gt; templates for designated entry points, but leaves some \n&gt; resources unspecified and the only way to discover them is \n&gt; through navigation.  If you write a client based on this \n&gt; specification, and you make sure the base URL is easy to \n&gt; change, then you can use that client against any deployment \n&gt; of the task manager.\n&gt;\n&gt; What we did is say, the semantics of your task list is that \n&gt; tasks have certain required and optional values, and certain \n&gt; state transitions, and preconditions and such, and certain \n&gt; related resources, and also they&#39;re directly accessible from \n&gt; your user id.  The semantics of attachments is that they have \n&gt; certain required and optional values, and certain state \n&gt; transitions, and so forth, but can exist anywhere in the \n&gt; cloud and can only be reached from a task.\n\nWith those paragraphs, you&#39;ve lost me.  I mean I can understand at a high\nlevel but I doubt I&#39;d end up with the same implementation you&#39;d mean.  So\nthat I can understand what you are saying I think what I&#39;d need to see are\nspecifics i.e. URLs, URI Templates, and any the representations of content\ntypes that provide navigation.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://drupal.meetup.com/4/calendar/6779397/\n\n\n"}}
