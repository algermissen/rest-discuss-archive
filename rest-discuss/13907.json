We are currently using the If-Modified-Since header along with\n&gt; 304 &quot;Not Modified&quot; response codes to ensure that the device does not\n&gt; download the file more than is absolutely necessary, but I&#39;d like to\n&gt; go a step further and only provide the changed records to the device\n&gt; (this is an XML file FWIW). After combing over the HTTP spec and not\n&gt; finding much on Google I think this might be a valid approach:\n&gt;\n&gt; Client sends a GET request with an If-Range header that specifies the\n&gt; last download date and a Range header that specifies the same. The\n&gt; server could then send back a response of 304 &quot;Not Modified&quot;, 206\n&gt; &quot;Partial Resource&quot; along with the deltas as the body or a 200 with all\n&gt; of the records as the body.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sample Request Headers:\n&gt; If-Range: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:49:37 GMT\n&gt; Range: lastmod=Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:49:37 GMT\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this approach correct? The HTTP spec suggests that I may define my\n&gt; own custom units for the Range header but they may not be portable[0]\n&gt; is there a standard already in place that I&#39;m missing?\n&gt;\n\nWould it be bad to is a If-None-Match header to tell the server that\nthe client has a particular version of a cached resource? Then the\nserver can look at the entity-tag and decide what diffs need to be\nsent. Clients of this service would just need to know how to apply\ndiffs to the cached resource.\n\nAn interesting server side consequence is that you&#39;d want an efficient\nway to calculate the diffs.\n\n--\nDavid\nblog: http://www.traceback.org\ntwitter: http://twitter.com/dstanek\n\n"}}
