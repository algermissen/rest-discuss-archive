So if=\r\n it&#39;s a different URI, it is a different\n&gt; resource. Therefore, the followi=\r\nng are two different resources:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=3DREST\n&gt;=\r\n http://www.google.com/search?q=3DThis+is+spinal+tap\n\nThis is what I&#39;m sayi=\r\nng as well.\n\n\n&gt; My definition of resource comes from the HTTP perspective. =\r\nYou said,\n&gt; &quot;You don&#39;t have to think of /search as being on big resource...=\r\n&quot; To\n&gt; me, you&#39;re not talking about the HTTP perspective here, but about ho=\r\nw\n&gt; humans would think of the information architecture of Google. I think\n&gt;=\r\n that&#39;s important to consider when designing a web app, because the\n&gt; URI i=\r\ns part of the user interface. URIs can be designed to help the\n&gt; user under=\r\nstand and better navigate the site. But users don&#39;t think\n&gt; in terms of res=\r\nources. For lack of a better word, I&#39;ll use &quot;content.&quot;\n\nOh! I wasn&#39;t going =\r\ndown that road. I was just trying to explain to Joe\n(who said &quot;I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk you&#39;d consider google.com one big resource.&quot;\nby which he meant something =\r\nlike &quot;When you say that the Query String\nis used for parametrising the reso=\r\nurce, do you think the Query String\nin http://www.google.com/search?q=3DRES=\r\nT or\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=3DThis+is+spinal+tap is parametrising\ng=\r\noogle.com&quot;?) that parametising the resource in a sense meant creating\nident=\r\nifiers to new resources (which could be sub-resources or\northogonal resourc=\r\nes).\n\n\n&gt; So now, if you search Google for REST and hit this page on one of =\r\nmy\n&gt; sites:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll notice=\r\n that the referrer was:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=3DREST\n&gt;\n&gt; And I=\r\n&#39;ll redirect the browser to:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_eas=\r\ny?q=3DREST\n&gt;\n&gt; This URI will show the same article, but with the term &quot;rest=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; highlighted.\n\nThis is not how I would do this. You could do this in a c=\r\nache friendly\nway on the client side (with javascript using document.referr=\r\ner) and\nnot create a new resource just for highlighting search terms.\n\n\n&gt; F=\r\nrom the HTTP perspective, these are two different\n&gt; resources:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://l=\r\nejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy\n&gt; http://lejava.artima.com/articles/res=\r\nt_easy?q=3DREST\n&gt;\n&gt; But from the user&#39;s perspective, they are two different=\r\n views of the\n&gt; same piece of content, which is an article about REST. Ther=\r\nefore, the\n&gt; query string parameterizes the content, from the user&#39;s perspe=\r\nctive,\n&gt; but not the resource. From the HTTP perspective, a URI is opaque, =\r\nand\n&gt; each unique string identifies a unique resource regardless of whether=\r\n\n&gt; it contains a question mark.\n\nThe Query String is parametrising the cont=\r\nent from the user&#39;s\nperspective and not the resource because *you* designed=\r\n it that way.\nYou could do it in the way I mentioned above and that would n=\r\not be the\ncase.\n\nLet me re-state what I meant in my first post [1]:\nRequest=\r\n modifiers should not be put in the Query String because\nrequest modifiers =\r\nare not supposed to affect the identify of a\nresource. When you put request=\r\n modifiers in the Query String you are\ncreating new resources where you sho=\r\nuldn&#39;t.\n\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n\n[1] http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5844\n\n"}}
