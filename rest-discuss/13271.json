Cannot a transaction manager itself\n&gt; &gt; have a RESTful interface? The application that is using the\n&gt; &gt; transaction\n&gt; &gt; manager will not be RESTful, but the interaction with the service\n&gt; &gt; will be.\n&gt;\n&gt; The transaction manager can have its own interface. But it still does\n&gt; not make sense to expose raw transaction managers to clients when you\n&gt; are building loosely coupled distributed systems (whether RESTful or\n&gt; not). WS-Tx specs have done this mistake, and we know how well they\n&gt; are adopted. When a server has broken down its use cases to low-level\n&gt; operations like transactions and compensations, the server designer\n&gt; may have over-abstracted the interface for clients. In such cases, it\n&gt; is better to take a step back, and see why you had to think of\n&gt; transactions in the place. The same is true for a number of so-called\n&gt; hard problems in REST such as partial updates, batches, copying,\n&gt; merging etc. Most of these problems go away or become simplified when\n&gt; you think in terms of application-level use cases and not low-level\n&gt; operations.\n\nI somewhat disagree with Roy here, although I know how much good it\nwill do be to disagree with Roy about anything regard ReST.\n\nBut I do agree with Subbu, which may seem contradictory.\n\nI do think 2-phase transactions can be ReSTful, but they do need to be\nredefined as application use cases.  (And of course they need to\nabandon the Atomic rules...)\n\nAnd I think this is done all the time, but people are still thinking\ndatabase transactions instead of application transactions.\n\nFor example, a request for quotation followed by an order is actually\na 2-phase transaction, but anything that looks like a transaction\nmanager is buried behind the scenes.\n\n"}}
