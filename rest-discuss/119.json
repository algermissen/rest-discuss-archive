It could be\nDELETEd if it wasn&#39;t going to be used for some reason. The first PUT\nwould launch whatever processing the POST would have (in fact with\nmod_reliable, it would look to your application as if it WERE a POST).\n\nI thought that this method-based approach was more REST-y than an\n&quot;only-once&quot; ID because it reifies the ID so that the server does not\nneed &quot;implicit state&quot; tracking which IDs have come through before. It\ntakes an extra hop to let the server choose the ID but then both the\nclient and the server have the same view of the time-window for the PUT.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
