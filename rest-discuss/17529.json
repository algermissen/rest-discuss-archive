GET or POST\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; User searches for vendors (plumbers) in a given area&  sees list of vendors on page. As a requirement, vendors get notified that a user has found him for the search term, so that he can contact the customer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The intention of the API user will be to get vendors, so it seems to be a pure GET contender; but the unintended side effect is creation of these notifications. As per the specification, HTTP verb should indicate the intent of the user, but in this case there is a pure object creation. What should we use, POST or GET?\n&gt; That sounds like you should GET.\n&gt;\n&gt; RFC 2616 section 9.1.1 says of &#39;idempotent&#39; methods such as GET:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The important\n&gt;&gt;     distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,\n&gt;&gt;     so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.\n&gt; In other words, if your service has server-side side-effects, the HTTP spec says that&#39;s your problem, not the user&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just by the way, if I as a customer were contacted by a merchant when all I&#39;d done was look at their address, I think I&#39;d react poorly.  At length, and with gestures.  But I presume you know your users.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt;\n&gt; Norman\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
