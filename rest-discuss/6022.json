People need sessions. \n&gt; Sessions make for better resource descriptions in URLs.\n\nThere are some problems with this statement if your aim is a critique\nof REST:\n\n- REST says using cookies isn&#39;t bad ; only using them for hiding state\n  is bad\n\n- if people really did &quot;need&quot; sessions we wouldn&#39;t be able to build\n  RESTfull apps; but we can - nice ones:\n\n    http://www.panic.com/goods/\n\n\n\nI also want to take issue with this:\n\n&gt; What I&#39;m really concerned about though (and I want to keep stressing \n&gt; this) is that people have their &#39;sense of value&#39; out of proportion. Some \n&gt; people think that &#39;HTTP&#39; is 80% what makes the web work, and &#39;URI&#39; the \n&gt; other 20%. Whereas I think it&#39;s more like URI=95% and HTTP=5%.\n\nThat may or may not be so. But REST seeks to guide application\ndesigners to design more scalable applications by helping them\nunderstand the architecture that underlies the HTTP protocol.\n\nHTTP is just a protocol. It can be used in all sorts of ways and that\nis a good thing. But not every way of using HTTP will be scalable and\nmaintainable. REST seeks to provide a structure where HTTP will be\nscalable and maintainable.\n\n\n\nHaving bit back I think these postings seem to rapidly be turning the\nREST mailing list into nntp stylee REST advocacy where we just sling\nmud at each other about sessions.\n\nAnd I don&#39;t want to take part in that. Given that we all understand\nthe limitations now I think I&#39;ll shut up.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
