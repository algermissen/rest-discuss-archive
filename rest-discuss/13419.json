What are you exposing and how?\nAs I see it, you don&#39;t actua=\r\nlly need to expose every single element on your domain model, since that ma=\r\ny no only require the client to actually manage much of the business logic,=\r\n but also will create a too much finer granularity.\n\nSo, in this case you h=\r\nave chosen to expose individual orders as resources. That means you need to=\r\n manage their state individually, directly. That is, I don&#39;t know what othe=\r\nr impact would have to cancel an order (rollback inventory changes? Notific=\r\nations?) all those other things you need to do manually. Then you need to c=\r\nhange the state in the order, manually. That is too much business logic in =\r\nthe client, don&#39;t you think?\n\nAn alternative is not to expose individual or=\r\nder as resources, but an ordering system that is modeled as a collection. Y=\r\nou post order data and the collection will create its orders and manage all=\r\n other little things. Delete an order id from the collection will cancel it=\r\n. Or, you can even post a cancel order. Be careful with these, it is not an=\r\n RPC call. YOu are posting an order cancellation TO THE COLLECTION which wi=\r\nll be added to the collection, and the collection process it, that will cha=\r\nnge the state of the active order. You still have both orders there, you ha=\r\nve then history.\n(A note here: a collection may have multiple types of reso=\r\nurces, and controls them even with the power of changing them. What do you =\r\nthink?)\n\nSincerely, exposing the state of an order as a resource is going t=\r\noo far.\n\n2. Any indication of action in the URL makes it RPC. URLs are just=\r\n to indicate which resource receives your operation. If it is the collectio=\r\nn, use POST to add something to it.\n\nIf you expose the order as a resource =\r\n(finer grain), and that has a state, the best way would be to post to that =\r\nresource a state change, which will affect the resource. In this case, I do=\r\nn&#39;t see it is correct that a change of one resource should change other res=\r\nources, so the rollback and any notification should be handled carefully. \n=\r\n\nAnother point against exposing such details is the idea of resources not l=\r\niving in one server. At any point, the server that receives your operations=\r\n may not be the same, and thus you must assure the resource being affected =\r\nis the same for all servers. That is best managed using coarse grained reso=\r\nurces.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n  \n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bi=\r\nll Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say I have an Order resource in a ec=\r\nommerce Order Entry system. \n&gt; How would I implement my service so that I c=\r\nan cancel an order rather \n&gt; than delete it?  One is to have the cancel sta=\r\nte as part of the order. \n&gt; THen I can just put a new representation with t=\r\nhe cancelled state set to \n&gt; true:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /orders/333\n&gt; content-type: app=\r\nlication/xml\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;cancelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt; .=\r\n..\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems kinda heavy to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it still be restful =\r\nto define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that you could put \n&gt; or post to to change the =\r\nstate?\n&gt; \n&gt; /orders/333/cancelled\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; /orders/333?cancel=3Dtrue\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; You don&#39;t even need to send data to change the state in this scenario. \n=\r\n&gt; But the problem with this from a pure RESTful standpoint is, isn&#39;t this \n=\r\n&gt; a mini-RPC?  My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n&gt; \n&gt; .... But, consider=\r\n if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     =\r\n&lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=3D&quot;http://example.com/orders/333/cancelled&quot;/=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;     ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I have a CANCEL link that if I follow c=\r\nhanges the state of my \n&gt; resource.  Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve e=\r\nmbedded it as a link. \n&gt; Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t ve=\r\nry RESTful by itself, \n&gt; but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.c=\r\nom\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
