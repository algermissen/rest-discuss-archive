Like it or not, both the hypertext and the  \nURI are part of the user interface of a web application.\n\n&gt; Benefits:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. You train your user to use the system at full leverage.\n&gt;\nWhat do you mean by &quot;full leverage?&quot;\n\n&gt; 2. You retain encapsulation of your implementation, and are\n&gt;      then free to change it without breaking your clients.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by this either. I&#39;m recommending URI  \ndesign from a user perspective, not from the perspective of what  \nmakes it easy to implement. Thus changing the implementation does not  \nimply changing the URI.\n\n&gt; : Mike can do that too, but all those things need to be at some URI\n&gt; : each, so why not select a canonical URI for each resource that may\n&gt; : help users figure out where they are in his information  \n&gt; architecture.\n&gt; : Users aren&#39;t depending on a URI meaning what they guess it means.\n&gt; : They just try it and see if the representation matched their\n&gt; : expectations. If it doesn&#39;t, they will quickly try something  \n&gt; else. It\n&gt; : is the representation that they ultimately depend on.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do we mean by &quot;canonical&quot; here?  I thought, in this context,\n&gt; it only meant &quot;authorized&quot;, as in &quot;which URL to redirect an alias to&quot;.\n&gt;\nYes, that&#39;s what I mean by canonical. A canonical form, to which  \nother URIs that may mean the same thing redirect to. In my case, the  \nreason I had multiple URIs referring to the same resource anyway was  \nthat by default that&#39;s what Java Servlets gave me.\n\nSpeaking of servlets, last night I tried canonicalizing away a  \ntrailing question mark, and discovered that there&#39;s now way to detect  \nthat situation with the servlet API. I wanted to transform:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?\n\nInto:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles\n\nBut unfortunately I can&#39;t. Search engines  might infer that these are  \nthe same, and canonicalize this themselves. By the &quot;rules,&quot; of  \ncourse, they shouldn&#39;t. They should treat these URIs opaquely, and  \nsince they are different, not infer that one means the other. But if  \nin 99.9% of the cases out there this means the same thing, and  \ntherefore this inferring allows the search engine to give better  \nresults to their users, they just might do it. Search engines must  \ndesign for reality, and should web app designers. In reality, users  \ndo look to the URI for hints at the information architecture.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
