This lin=\r\nk points to the list of additional properties for that resource (at the URL=\r\n &quot;{additional-properties}&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The URL &quot;{additional-properties=\r\n}&quot; returns a list of key/value properties for reading.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) For e=\r\nach key/value in the list there will be links for a) editing the value of t=\r\nhe key, and 2) deleting the key.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3a) Editing is as simple as PU=\r\nTing a new value to the URL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3b) Deleting a key is as simple as=\r\n a HTTP DELETE of the URL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) The list also contains a link for=\r\n adding new properties.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What would be a suitable (simple) media=\r\n-type for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am considering ATOM (which is nice for lists)=\r\n, but that seems like quite a bit of overkill. HTML might also be useful (b=\r\nut does not support PUT, but POST would be okay too). A home-grown applicat=\r\nion/vnd.abc+xml is also a possibility.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What would you guys do?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
