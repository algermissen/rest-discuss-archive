I&#39;d point out which one, but I am curious\nif anyone else can figure out what is missing from the description.\n\nI am especially curious because almost every presentation that\ntries to describe REST leaves the same bits out, and I am wondering\nif it is because I explained it poorly in my dissertation or if it\nis simply hard to understand why it is essential to the style.\n\nOtherwise, it is a reasonable talk given the time limitations.\nI would spend more time on the &quot;why&quot; parts, but that&#39;s just me,\nand I&#39;ll be doing my own presentation at Jazoon07 anyway.\n\nBTW, I don&#39;t understand the triangle diagram.  I have absolutely\nno idea what that has to do with REST, or why it appears on the\nwikipedia entry as well. YMMV.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
