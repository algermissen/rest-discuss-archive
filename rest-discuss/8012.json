And we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want a specific URL for letting people browse Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; news and a different one for Java articles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t/articles/\n&gt; &gt; \t/topics/\n&gt; &gt; \t/news/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; My requirements are that articles about Java and news\n&gt; about Java need two different URLs. /topics/java is one\n&gt; URL. At /topics/java I&#39;d expect to see any kind of\n&gt; content about Java, but that is not a requirement.\n\nI was assuming /topics/ were categorizations of articles and news, but\narticles and news themselves.   \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I want to have something useful at each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subpath. I could put a list of topics at:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; /topics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but that&#39;s not really deserving of its own page.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why not?  It should list the topics available to be\n&gt; &gt; covered.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Actually it would probably be tags, or just a search box.\n&gt; I lost confidence in listing topics a priori that content\n&gt; would fall into. \n\nI concur with that, but you can still have a URL with tags like Technorati\nor Flickr, no?\n\n&gt; Sure, you could have such a page, but if I weren&#39;t forced\n&gt; to do it by the information architecture I wouldn&#39;t give\n&gt; this a page. I don&#39;t have one now and don&#39;t plan to have\n&gt; one in the future.\n\nWhat harm would there be to offer such a page?  Wouldn&#39;t it actually be a\nbenefit to users?  And it would definitely be a benefit in increasing Google\nPageRank if used wisely.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I want to offer these lists sorted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alphabetically and by reverse pub date. So going in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this direction I&#39;d need to do something like:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; /alpha/topics/java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; /topics/alpha/java /topics/pubdate/java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorting is not an entity, it is a layout/formatting\n&gt; &gt; directive. IOW, it doesn&#39;t change the content, only\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s presentation. So in a path is should be at the\n&gt; &gt; end, not the beginning, or in a param:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t/topics/java/alpha \t/topics/java?sort=alpha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d probably prefer the latter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Well that was the point of my response. Your original\n&gt; question was why does one need query parameters?\n\nI wasn&#39;t asking as question with a goal of asserting a position, I was\nasking an honest question just like I asked honestly in my URLQuiz about\npeople&#39;s positions on the .WWW subdomain [1].\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when you have articles about Java listed at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /articles?t=java, people can kind of get the idea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the URl that this is a list of articles rather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than a list of news items.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But they can get the same idea if you segment as:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t/articles/ \t\n&gt; &gt; \t/news/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if you mean /topics/articles here or\n&gt; /articles. \n\n/articles/ \t\n\n&gt; If you say /topics/articles I think it is\n&gt; pretty clear. But I still feel / topics itself is\n&gt; artificial. \n\nI only picked it because it was mentioned in the thread. I have no affinity\nto it.\n/articles for articles and /news for news works for me.\n\n&gt; If you want to look at news about Java and articles about\n&gt; Java, it is at:\n&gt; \n&gt; /articles?t=java /news?t=java\n&gt; The query parameters yield a &quot;view&quot; of part of the\n&gt; concept to the left of the question mark, in this case,\n&gt; the subset of content items that fall under the &quot;Java&quot;\n&gt; category.\n\nOTOH, I would far prefer to see: \n\n \t/articles/java/ \t\n \t/news/java/\n\nAs well as:\n\n \t/java/articles/ \t\n \t/java/news/\n\n(But then we have been down that path on this forum with far more\nconversation participants than just you and me, haven&#39;t we? :)\n\n&gt; What I&#39;m claiming is that yes, you potentially could try\n&gt; to force everything into path fields (between the\n&gt; slashes), but named parameters are often a better fit.\n\nAgreed in general, but given the above example not agreed in specifics.\n\n&gt; You can leave a named query params completely out to say\n&gt; it is at its default value, whereas using a path field\n&gt; for everything would require you to actually put a\n&gt; default character in the URL, because you need something\n&gt; in each position (unless what you want to leave out is at\n&gt; the end). \n\nCan you give me an example where this is a problem?  I&#39;d like to see how I\nwould address it (if you have given such an example to date, sorry, I missed\nit.)\n\n&gt; Also, I think it would be easier to add new\n&gt; parameters later than new path fields, because when you\n&gt; try and put something that fits better as a query into\n&gt; the path, it needs to go in the beginning. So if you\n&gt; didn&#39;t think of it initially, you can&#39;t put it in without\n&gt; breaking existing links, because path params are parsed\n&gt; by position, not by name.\n\nTrue, which is why I like to look at the nature of the IA when deciding on a\nURL structure.  Some informatoin is much more resilient than others.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n[1] http://blog.welldesignedurls.org/2007/02/19/urlquiz-1-www-or-non-www/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
