Not all XML DB&#39;s are created equal.\n&gt; We are using BDBXML, where an embedded DB is called for, and eXist\n&gt; elsewhere.  But, these two applications have completely different\n&gt; approaches to the same concept -- storing XML natively.  If we were to\n&gt; try using BDBXML where we are now using eXist, and vice-versa, we&#39;d be\n&gt; in a world of sh*t.  However, we could outright replace BDBXML with\n&gt; MarkLogic if we had to, as they take the same approach.  There is no\n&gt; &quot;best XML DB,&quot; only the XML DB that&#39;s best for your situation.  ;-)\n\nThis seems like a good pragmatic response :-)\n\nBy the way, I think we were just using BDBXML where an embedded DB was\nnot the right way to go.
