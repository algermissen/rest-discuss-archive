Moreover,  \nupon a successful DELETE, should I issue another ETag as well?\n\nAs a side question, is it ok to use DELETE when it &#39;clears a list&#39;.  \nSay, I want to clear my shopping cart, so I delete it. However, when I  \nGET it later on, it simply says that it&#39;s empty rather than it doesn&#39;t  \nexist. The reason why I don&#39;t use PUT is that I don&#39;t want to allow  \ndirect modification as a result of some assertion to the state of the  \nresource other than clearing it.\n\nJan Vincent Liwanag\njvliwanag@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
