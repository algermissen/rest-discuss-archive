Because it is idempotent it may use the GET method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not true.  By definition, the resource identified by the callback URI\n&gt; changes state when notified of an event (call it a &quot;mailbox&quot; or\n&gt; whatever).  That means that there are side-effects, and therefore GET is\n&gt; not appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A POST message is not only a notification, it is also an update.\n&gt; \n&gt; It need not be.  The body could just be a URI, for example.\n\nYou might noticed an apparent contradiction there.  I was assuming that\nby &quot;update&quot; you meant that the POST body was used in determining how\nthe state of the callback resource was modified.  This may not be the\ncase, because it&#39;s possible that all that resource needs to know to\nmake a state change is *that* a POST was invoked, not the contents of\nthe POST body.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
