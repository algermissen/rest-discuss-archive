Particularly to webservice\n&gt; client authors.\n &gt; [...]\n\n From reading threads after threads on this subjects, mainly as an \nobserver, I believe that opacity of URIs is one of the most \ncontroversial subjects. From the above statement, I assume that it would \nbe natural to see web service client code that looks like this:\n\n   Product getProduct(id){\n     URI uri = SERVICE_URI + &quot;/product/&quot; + id;\n     ...\n     return product;\n   }\n\nThat is, the web service that we are contacting will document its API by \ndescribing how to build URIs. Bad right?\n\nBut clients built using this type of assumption are so easy to write. No \nneed to understand discovery mechanism that are application specific: \njust learn how to build URIs to get what you want.\n\nIt seems a little too optimistic to think that the majority of clients \nwill have the wisdom to only use discovery to obtain URIs when a server \ndefines clean URIs. While you can offer a totally-restful web service \nwith discovery, I think that many clients will eventually construct URIs \nlike above, unless the service is committed enough to opacity so it \nbuild URIs that are randomly generated.\n\nSo my point here is that personally, as a client, I enjoy the \npossibility to build URI from the knowledge of the structure. But I am \nno expert nor a credible REST specialist.\n\n--\nClaude\n\n"}}
