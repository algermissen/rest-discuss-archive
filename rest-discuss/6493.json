One main difference is that in REST &#39;dead&#39; \nrepresentations of objects are passed around, and in COM et al. live \nobjects are passed around.\n\nHas anyone here worked with both approaches? What are the strengths and \nweaknesses of the two?\n\n\nI personally prefer REST from an architectural point of view since it \nmore clearly separates the components. But I have problems formulating \nmy opinion.\n\nOn the client side it seems like COM can be much easier to use. You just \nget your COM objects and use them like normal objects. When using REST \nyou have to figure out the URI, parse the representation, and generate \nrepresentations to send back to the server. But I haven&#39;t used COM that \nmuch so it might be trickier in practice (I&#39;ve read that e.g. the \nreference counting used in some implementations is quite error prone; \nanother problem might be versioning).\n\nIn COM you get some objects and then you make your operations directly \non the objects. In REST, on the other hand, you have to go to one \ndestination, the server, for all operations. That makes COM appear to \nfollow object orientation more closely and easier to use, but I&#39;m not \nsure that&#39;s the case.\n\nIs REST inherently more inefficient, in terms of performance and memory \nconsumption? Regarding performance I&#39;m mainly thinking of generating / \nparsing the representations (XML or other format), but perhaps \nmarshalling in COM is equally expensive? Regarding memory consumption \nI&#39;m thinking of the real objects and the representations, i.e. the \ndata&#39;s in two locations. Do you think REST can be used on a device with \nrestricted resources, such as a mobile phone or PDA?\n\nIs it possible to put a REST layer on top of a COM solution?\n\nSorry &#39;bout all the questions but this is a issue that I have hard times \n  figuring out myself and need some insight from folks with experience.\n\nCheers,\n  Jonas\n\n"}}
