If you are using GET to delete resources you aren&#39;t using \nHTTP, you&#39;re tunnelling through port 80 and making it look like HTTP so \nthat it gets through.\n\n&gt; but what could we be missing?\n\nSafety, scalability, reliability, interoperability, a clear modelling of \nthe system.\n\nYou can also more easily bring a new person on the team. If that person \nis experienced in the web they know what GET does and what DELETE does. \nYou don&#39;t need to document how to delete a resource, merely which \nresources can be deleted and what criteria (authentication etc.) may \naffect the deletion.\n\nIf you use GET to do a delete then you have to explain to them that you \naren&#39;t using HTTP at all and it just looks confusingly similar to HTTP \nand then explain what you actually are doing.\n\n(Just hope that this new guy didn&#39;t have a read-ahead cache on his \nbrowser or it&#39;ll have deleted everything while you were explaining this \nto him).\n\n\n"}}
