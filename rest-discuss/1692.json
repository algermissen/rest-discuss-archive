Then once you&#39;ve decided that, it \n&gt; &gt; makes sense to ask for equivalents. They aren&#39;t so there \n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t. The issue should be a no-brainer for UDDI. Who do you \n&gt; &gt; know who is using UDDI? For what?\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul,\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do you insist on arguing over the individual trees instead of\n&gt; looking at the forest?  I didn&#39;t bother replying when you casually filed\n&gt; away my previous comments as not being relevant to Rich&#39;s specific\n&gt; problem.  Now you insist on examining the value  of individual SOAP\n&gt; specs when I was pointing out that REST doesn&#39;t seem to be catching fire\n&gt; unlike SOAP.\n\nOkay, here&#39;s the forest as I see it:\n\nSOAP has existed for about 2 1/2 years, and from very early on has been \nheavily promoted by both Microsoft and IBM. It was touted as revolutionary \nin an era when &quot;revolutionary&quot; technologies were practically guaranteed to \nbring forth hordes of slavering investors. Furthermore, SOAP became seen\nas a core technology of Web Services not by accident, but because it was\na key part of the development trend that led to the idea of Web\nServices.\n\nREST has been around (in substance if not in name) for much longer than\nSOAP. Yet the REST-for-Web-Services movement is still very new, and\ntakes place in a dramatically changed marketplace. The economy is in\nrecession, technical innovation has lost its magical aura (and even if\nit hadn&#39;t, the resources available for experimentation are vastly\nreduced). SOAP has money and momentum behind it; REST has a motley crew\nof smart developers. Furthermore, REST probably seems like a radical \nchange to the money people, who are now afraid of radical change; yet\nnot radical enough to that sizable portion of the developer community\nthat thrives on being &quot;cutting-edge.&quot;\n\nSo the fact that REST isn&#39;t on the verge of taking over the world means\nwhat, exactly?\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
