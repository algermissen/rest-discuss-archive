However, I can find nothing in the JSR \nto explicitly indicate this or contradict it. (The sheer vagueness of \nthe proposal is a major problem, and a big reason why this should be \ndone as an open source project *outside* the JCP first, before \nstandardization. If that were the case I&#39;d have many fewer concerns with \nit.)\n\nHowever reading between the lines I see some evidence that this plays \nboth sides of the fence. I think there&#39;s an assumption that tools will \nbe used on the one side to consume what the server side produces. For \ninstance they might share a WADL file. If so, this would weaken or break \nthe client independence of HTTP. We&#39;d be back in WS-Hell where \ntheoretically independent services can only be consumed by clients \nwritten with the same framework.\n\nOne of two things needs to happen here:\n\n1. The JSR is rewritten to make it clear that this is purely a \nserver-side proposal and that no client side technology will be specced.\n\n2. If the goal is to develop both client and server APIs, then this \nneeds to be split into two independent JSRs, with separate spec leads \nand expert groups. Furthermore there should be a wall between the two \nefforts. They must not act as if they know what the other is doing. The \nclient group should design for nothing but a generic HTTP server, and \nthe server group should design for nothing  more than a generic HTTP \nclient. Neither may depend on any functionality of the other. For \nexample, a server side Representation class should not share code or \ninterface with a client Representation class.  Doing that risks \nintroducing unintended dependencies and tightly couple 311 clients to \n311 servers.\n\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
