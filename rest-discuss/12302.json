Let&#39;s not call it\n&gt; delete, let&#39;s call it archive instead. The server is now telling you\n&gt; what the application state is: the contents of the inbox. Along with\n&gt; it, how to transition to a different application state by changing\n&gt; the contents of the inbox. It lets you checkbox specific emails and\n&gt; with one request archive them.\n&gt; \n\nWhat language is this form written in?  If it&#39;s in HTML, then you can\nonly use GET or POST, in which case deleting a message would use POST\njust like archiving a message would use POST, but you can&#39;t have two\nmethods doing the same thing (POST and DELETE), or one method which\ndoes different things for different resources (POST).\n\nOf course, using Xforms makes such an interface possible without\nviolating REST, if POST archives and DELETE deletes, because Xforms 1.1\nallows any method to be used.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The main point of the architecture is to reduce coupling between\n&gt; client and server. The client and server here only agreed on a common\n&gt; understanding of media type and protocol, client is merely following\n&gt; the happy hypermedia trial. There are no new semantics on, in this\n&gt; case HTML or HTTP.\n&gt; \n\nNo, HEAS isn&#39;t the main point of REST, it&#39;s one of the four constraints\nwhich make up the uniform connector interface.  Trust me, there are\nmillions of web applications out there that don&#39;t resemble REST even if\nthey are using HEAS and even request methods properly.\n\nRemember the other year, when Google released its Web Accelerator?\nVarious sites had content deleted by virtue of Google&#39;s app following\n&quot;delete this&quot; links implemented with GET.  That was pure HEAS -- the\nbot followed the links it found, the client and server agreed on the\nmeaning of text/html media types, and no new semantics were introduced\n(only misapplied to the GET method). Of course, since the method was GET\nnot DELETE, the bot authors had no idea that their product would wreak\nsuch havoc, but that&#39;s because the majority of the Web isn&#39;t RESTful.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
