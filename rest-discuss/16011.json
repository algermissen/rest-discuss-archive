That meaning is transient and held\nonly by the client.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\nOn Wed, Jul 28, 2010 at 8:51 PM, Ed Summers &lt;ehs@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I was wondering if there is anything in the REST architectural style\n&gt; or specifically HTTP that prescribes what the nature of a Resource is.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, is it legit to say that the URL\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Cookbook-Scalability/dp/0596801688/\n&gt; identifies a resource that is Amazon&#39;s notion of the book RESTful Web\n&gt; Services Cookbook. Or that http://www.nasa.gov/ identifies a resource\n&gt; that is NASA?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to start an httpRange-14 flamewar, but just wondering\n&gt; if REST&#39;s notion of Resource is flexible enough to typically\n&gt; accommodate these two use cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; //Ed\n&gt;\n\n"}}
