If the firewall admins see one, that&#39;s good enough. It&#39;s \n&gt;their firewall, not yours. If the internal users are inconvenienced then \n&gt;they are free to lobby to change their organization&#39;s firewall policy, \n&gt;through whatever means are available within their organization. \n\nNo, that&#39;s not reality. \n\nThe internal admins configuring the firewall in many places are clueless\n(believe me, I ran a business for a while where that was truly the case but\nI couldn&#39;t afford to hire anyone better. And it will be the case in many\nsmall to medium size businesses.)\n\nThe users will not know that the website is respecting their firewall &quot;as it\nshould&quot;, all they will know is that the service doesn&#39;t work for them and\nthey won&#39;t have a clue that it has anything to do with the firewall (even if\nthe website tells them.) All they will know is they they are going to give\ntheir business to that other website that does what it needs to do in order\nto work, as Nic suggests.\n\n&gt;Indeed if the firewall policies are really brain-damaged then the most \n&gt;effective way to convince people of this is to let things break rather \n&gt;than working around their brain damage.\n\nThis is unfortunately the reality of the web where &quot;should&quot; and &quot;does&quot; are\noften mismatched.  Spend some time on the WHATWG list debating Ian Hickson\nif you don&#39;t believe me.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
