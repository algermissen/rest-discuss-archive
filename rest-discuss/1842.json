If a client makes\n&gt; a request to a server, and that server hangs onto the request while\n&gt; the client merrily goes on its way, then when the response eventually\n&gt; comes, the client can treat it as an asynchronous message from the\n&gt; server. If the server cleverly puts content into the reply, voila,\n&gt; your client can wake up and deal with it.\nYes - this is the &#39;KnowNow&#39; approach mentioned by Lucas earlier. KnowNow has\nan HTTP based message server that does exactly this.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If the TCP connection breaks, or the HTTP server times out and shuts\n&gt; it down, the client would get a different signal/error. Then client\n&gt; could then decide whether to send another future request or do\n&gt; something else. In any case, you are buying time and leaving open a\n&gt; means for an async notification.\n&gt;\n&gt; This would move the problem up one level and you would not have to\n&gt; muck with HTTP. The only issue is whether the breakage level is too\n&gt; high, causing overconsumption of resources. Then you do have to work\n&gt; on some optimizations (potentially even rewriting HTTP).\n&gt;\nThere isn&#39;t any unsurmountable technical problem, the issue that several of\nus want to deal with is that the response from the server will look to the\nHTTP world like responses and not as requests. The communication between the\nserver and the client would be a &#39;private http&#39; protocol - messages\ninitiated by the server appear as if they are merely a single response to a\nprevious request, and this isn&#39;t that big a deal for building apps. Longer\nterm there should be more visibility, but I&#39;m all for testing it out and\ndocumenting/&#39;standardizing&#39; the approach if it becomes popular.\n\n\n\n"}}
