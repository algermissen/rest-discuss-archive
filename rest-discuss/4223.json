HTTP\n&gt; DELETE is defined as deleting the entire resource, but I want to be\n&gt; able to delete just one of possibly many representations of a given\n&gt; resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two options I have thought of are:\n&gt; a) Abuse the Accept header: if it appears in a DELETE request, delete\n&gt;    the representations of the resource that are in the media types\n&gt;    specified in that header field.  If it isn&#39;t present, delete the\n&gt;    resource and all its representations.\n&gt; b) Use PUT with a Content-Type header but an empty body to &#39;overwrite&#39;\n&gt;    an existing representation with a &#39;null&#39; one.\n&gt; The second of these doesn&#39;t seem to me to mean the same thing as\n&gt; deleting a representation - I don&#39;t see why an empty representation\n&gt; couldn&#39;t be meaningful for some applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I overlooking an obvious solution?\n\nI think the obvious solution is to assign a distinct URI to that \nrepresentation, returning it in the Content-Location header upon \nGET/HEAD. Then apply DELETE to that URI.\n\nJulian\n\n-- \n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n"}}
