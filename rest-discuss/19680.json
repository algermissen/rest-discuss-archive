[rest-discuss] wrote:\n&gt;&gt; it sounds like the scenario we were talking about, that all you want is\n&gt;&gt; to tell the resource to &quot;reverse its state&quot;. in this case, i&#39;d POST a\n&gt;&gt; body that represents this request, in whatever serialization you happen\n&gt;&gt; to prefer. the resource toggles. everybody&#39;s happy.\n&gt; OK.  Still seems like a bit of a departure from typical RESTful interfaces\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen and has the potential to be a catch-all tunnel for RPC-style\n&gt; requests.\n&gt; E.g.:\n&gt; /command, where one could POST all sorts of commands like &quot;toggle.&quot;\n\nthe problem is not that POST can mean anything (it can), but people \nPOSTing things to a &quot;do stuff&quot; resource, which then isn&#39;t \nresource-oriented anymore. your RPC sensor shouldn&#39;t go off because of \npeople POSTing things to resources (that&#39;s fine), but because of people \nPOSTing things to something other than resources (the &quot;API end point&quot;, \nfor example).\n\n&gt;&gt; but i am confused because you wrote earlier that you were concerned\n&gt;&gt; about race conditions. which seems to imply that instead of just\n&gt;&gt; toggling, you&#39;re also assuming that you&#39;re &quot;toggling *from* some state&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; but that wouldn&#39;t be the &quot;blind toggle&quot; we discussed. could you clarify\n&gt;&gt; a bit how exactly the operation that you&#39;re trying to design is defined?\n&gt; Apologies, a blind toggle is what is desired.  As it currently works, in\n&gt; the current binary protocol, a button press on a toggle switch simply\n&gt; sends a &quot;toggle&quot; command.\n\nthen how would a race condition enter the picture? just because of the \ntimestamp when you last observed the resource&#39;s state? or something \nelse? to me, toggling always is kind of a game: if somebody toggled \nahead of you, you&#39;ll do something other than you wanted to, but that&#39;s \nhow it is and you&#39;ll have to deal with it after toggling and finding out \nthat you switched the damn thing back on again...\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
