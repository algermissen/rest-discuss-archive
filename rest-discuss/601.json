It would amount to an NxN matrix of open connections\nbetween every possible sender/recipient pair.\n\nOk, ok, I realize that you were talking about persistent GET between edge nodes\nand server-class sponsor machines.  :)  a couple problems with this approach:\n* Many people own perfectly capable desktop machines with good connectivity.\nFor them to pay someone else to sponsor their connections is a waste.\n* The servers at the center of a persistent-GET topography would still need\nnotifications.  The persistent GET at the last mile wouldn&#39;t have anything to\npersistently GET otherwise.\n\nThat said, I agree that persistent GET is the one solution for nodes behind\nfirewalls.  ...both persistent GET and http notifications are needed.\n\n&gt; That being said, it might be useful to establish a\n&gt; standard format for this Persistent GET for cache\n&gt; invalidation or for replication or for security\n&gt; monitoring,\n\nThis would be a useful project, assuming that KnowNow&#39;s format isn&#39;t already\nthere, and even if KN is already there it would still be productive to send\ntheir stuff through the standards process.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
