But h=\r\now is it actually done in practice? What are your &quot;tricks of the trade&quot;?\n\nM=\r\nost implementations I have seen requires the client to create some kind of =\r\nGUID and use that in a PUT operation. For instance in order to create a new=\r\n &quot;person&quot; resource:\n\n  PUT /person/{person-guid} HTTP/1.1\n  Content-Type: .=\r\n..\n\n  ... user data ...\n\nIf it fails then the client can retry the PUT oper=\r\nation to the same URL. The server must then keep track of succeeded &quot;person=\r\n-guids&quot; (is there any &quot;best practice&quot; for how this is done?).\n\nWhat other t=\r\nricks do we have? Did I even get the above pattern right :-)\n\nRegards, J=F8=\r\nrn\n\n\n"}}
