It\ncould manage bookmarks in one central place.\n\n&gt;�During the morning commute I came to more or less the same conclusion.\n&gt;�In general there needs to be a listing of design issues with an example\n&gt;�for each. �The stuff on the REST Wiki right now is too abstract.\n\nAs a very new comer to REST I am still having a hard time thinking about how\nit works with a real application from an implementation point of view.\n\n&gt;�Design issue: resources not methods\n&gt;�Example: SQL insert\n&gt;\n&gt;�One way to do a SQL insert over the web is to wrap the SQL in HTTP syntax.\n&gt;�For example,\n&gt;�GET /doInsert?cols=id,val&vals=25,fooVal&table=myTable\n&gt;\n&gt;�A REST way of doing this would\n&gt;�* be strict about not using GET to change server state\n&gt;�* have the back end target be a resource rather than a procedure\n&gt;\n&gt;�New way:\n&gt;�POST /tables/myTable?id=25&val=fooVal\n&gt;\n&gt;�- Lucas\n\nSurely this would be very bad as anyone could insert whatever data they\nwanted into your database. Database access/manipulation IMHO is something\nthat should definately live behind a facade. I would generally prefer to not\neven expose dataaccess routines to the outside world but wrap those up in\nsomething that communicates what the data is doing. Without doing a REST\nexample, because I don&#39;t understand it yet.\n\nI would do something like employee.create, or update etc...This is commonly\ntermed as the CRUD approach. In REST would this be something like the\nfollowing?\n\nhttp://somehost.com/employee/create?id=12345\nhttp://somehost.com/employee/update?id=12345\n\nThen on the server side there would be a create, update method on the\nemployee that takes an id parameter?\n\n- -- \nSigned,\nHolden Glova\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org\n\niD8DBQE8vnjn+mF116Lw2cQRAoddAJ9HIDZXui5D0I6yumnsY5kUVVE9QQCZAXdM\nj3S51ro8ojOn+3kG4PMZqBE=\n=uvr+\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
