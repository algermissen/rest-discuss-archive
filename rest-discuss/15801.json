If I want =\r\nto create a new customer instance, I could POST a representation of that cu=\r\nstomer to the collection resource. The server returns a &quot;201 created&quot; and t=\r\nhe URI of the new customer instance, maybe &#39;/customers/1234&#39;.\n\nNow let&#39;s sa=\r\ny I need to update this particular customer entity with new information. I =\r\ncould PUT the new description to the instance URI or I could POST it. Since=\r\n &#39;/customers/1234&#39; is not a collection resource there is no ambiguity about=\r\n what I want: Update this particular customer instance.\n\nIs there a problem=\r\n with that approach? Wikipedia&#39;s helpful article about REST says that a POS=\r\nT in that particular case should mean &quot;Treat the addressed member as a coll=\r\nection in its own right and create a new entry in it.&quot; But - at least in my=\r\n case - if I would ever have to have a collection within the customer, I wo=\r\nuld have given it its own URI, such as &#39;/customers/1234/contacts&#39;. Therefor=\r\ne, it&#39;s clear from the context that the customer entity itself is not a col=\r\nlection and never will be.\n\nSo, is there any particular danger in interpret=\r\ning PUT and POST in the same way in this particular instance? \n\nOr maybe a =\r\nbit broader: Is there a problem with taking the context into account when l=\r\nooking at the meaning of PUT and POST?\n\n\n"}}
