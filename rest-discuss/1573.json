The seller is not required to \n&gt; accept it. Your credit might be bad, the seller might not have enough \n&gt; goods, you may want it faster than the seller can deliver, or \n&gt; whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt; You do not have any control over the seller.  All you can do is \n&gt; transfer the state of your offer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect this is similar to some of the other instances of verbs in \n&gt; URIs.  A verb is not really the most accurate way to describe the \n&gt; situation.\n\nA good point.  In this case the &quot;verb&quot; of this application is &quot;offer&quot;.  You\nare essentially invoking the &quot;make offer&quot; method for the offer taker.  The\norder document is certainly essential, but it is part of the transaction.\n\nAgain, I am suggesting that documents/data are important in services, but so\nare verbs/actions.\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
