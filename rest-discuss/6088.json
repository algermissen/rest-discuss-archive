It\n&gt;&gt;&gt; simply stores a way to reference the back end cart which can be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; accessed with the HTTP verbs.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; One could argue that a cart /is/ a session.  In fact, for a shopping \n&gt;&gt; application, that&#39;s pretty much what I consider the session to consist \n&gt;&gt; of.  Therefore, the reference to the back end cart is a session key.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; One could only argue that by changing the semantics of the words.\n&gt;\n&gt; The cart is not a session it&#39;s a resource storing state. Otherwise\n&gt; every thing that stores state is a session.\n&gt;   \nWhy can&#39;t a session be a resource storing state?\n&gt; A session is an object (normally) subsidiary to authentication details\n&gt; that exists orthogonal to resources in a webapp.\n&gt;   \nOh, so by your definition of &#39;session&#39;, it can&#39;t be a resource.  I think \nwe have different definitions of the word.  You&#39;re talking about \nsomething technical, but I&#39;m talking about the subjective experience of \nthe user.\n\nTo me, a session is an object (normally) subsidiary to authentication \ndetails, that /is/ a resource.  It&#39;s an interaction (or conversation, if \nyou will) of indefinite length with the server, more than one of which \nmay occur simultaneously, even for the same user.\n\nFor example, if I&#39;m playing chess online, each game is a session.  I \nmight make a move today, and come back tomorrow, and make another move.  \nSame session.  I can simultaneously be playing another game with someone \nelse in another browser window, and that&#39;s another session.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
