Are these ideas based on experience in some judicial\n&gt; system or another?  Or are they systems analysts views of where the\n&gt; authoritative data in a transaction *ought to* be found?\n&gt; \n&gt; My own opinion, based on judges and arbitrators I have faced in\n&gt; contract matters, is that they want a context from which to judge\n&gt; what constitutes the contract in question, and they don&#39;t like\n&gt; other people constraining them in their judgment of how wide or\n&gt; narrow that context should be.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that judges and juries for that matter are interested in\n&gt; conversational state, not just in discrete &#39;stable states&#39; of a\n&gt; negotiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;ve never been to court over an electronic transaction, so my\n&gt; view may be totally uninformed.\n\nI posted some references to legal standards on \nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/PurchasingBusinessRequi\nrements\n\nEverything I know about this stuff came from working on ebXML, where \nwe had several experts in legal aspects of electronic transations, \nincluding the chair of the ABA eCommerce committee.\n\nOne of the principles that I quoted on the Rest Wiki page advocated:\n&#39;Replicable and computable transaction state closure. In the \nforegoing context, &quot;suitable proof&quot; of the offer and acceptance \nevents, means that determinable computation of the \ntransaction&#39;s &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; state must be replicable by both \ntrading partners at run time, as well as third parties (such as a \ncourt) after the fact, using only artifacts transmitted within \nmessages associated with the transaction.&#39;\n\nThat&#39;s still a little ambiguous re the current discussion, and IANAL, \nand so will refrain from interpreting it further.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
