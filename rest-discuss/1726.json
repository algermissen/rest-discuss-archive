I have\nwatched an endless number of REST-related debates on xml-dev.  I have\nprobably seen just about ever argument made for and against REST.  At times,\nI have thought I understood REST enough to see its value.  At other times, I\nhave looked at REST and seen nothing of value.  And in the end, I am exactly\nwhere I started off.\n\nMaybe this has to do with the fact that every time I see REST, it is joined\nat the hip with HTTP.  I know that REST is a methodology and HTTP is an\nimplementation.  I also know that a lot of people say that HTTP is an\nexample of REST.  But that&#39;s where the relationship stops for me.  HTTP (in\nit&#39;s original incarnation, as I understand it) had a very simple purpose:\nprovide a simple technique to allow researchers to share their works with\nother researchers.  The purpose of HTTP was simple.  The implementation of\nHTTP was simple.  But, as far as I can see, the fact that it is RESTful is\njust as much a coincidence as anything else.  So, if this is the case, why\ndoes everyone keep getting hung up on HTTP when discussing REST?\n\nIt seems to me that the &quot;REST effort&quot; would progress much better if all\nconversations would just drop HTTP and talk about implementations in\ngeneral.  I think that a lot of people (including myself) end up having a\nhard time determining if an argument is about REST or the &quot;RESTfulness of\nHTTP&quot;.  HTTP may be a good example of the REST principles, but that&#39;s all it\nshould be.  Maybe we could come up with (assuming there isn&#39;t already) a\nfictitious RESTful implementation (NOT BASED ON HTTP) that would allow\ndiscussions of REST without losing focus or making it difficult for us newer\nguys to figure out which is about REST and which is about something related\nto REST.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\np.s. I&#39;m not looking for a flame war here.  I just want to figure out what\nREST is all about without having to deal with the excess baggage of HTTP.\n\n\n"}}
