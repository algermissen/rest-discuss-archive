This gives you a\n&gt; representation the source text of the page in a HTML textarea.\n \n&gt; The submit button is a POST to /wiki/MyPage. I just interpret that POST\n&gt; as a PUT (by pre-processing the request on the server) whenever the\n&gt; Content-type of the request is &#39;application/www-urlencoded&#39; (sp).\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember that having to use forms this way is basically papering over\n&gt; the\n&gt; fact that most HTML browsers are read-only.\n\n\nThis is similar to how I do it. Say you have a resource:\nsome-uri-space/sub-space/xyz\nI would have another resource (some-uri-space/edit/xyz) that would\ngive me a editable representation of the above resource.\n\nNote that this resource exists only for browsers and GETting it\nreturns a From that is POSTed to some-uri-space/edit/xyz, which is\nthen interpreted as a PUT to some-uri-space/xyz on the server. I\nachieve this by using some hidden Form fields that have a URI and a\nmethod.\n\nOnce we have browsers/plugins that support PUT/DELETE, I can simply\ntake out the browser specific resources and the hacks to convert\nPOST&#39;s to PUT&#39;s. The major chunk of my code remains intact.\n\nSandeep Shetty\n\n"}}
