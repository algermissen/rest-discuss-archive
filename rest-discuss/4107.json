The latter query resource-spaces.\n\nPassive, actionable identification is more useful than required queries.\n\n| The second reason is that path is a hierarchical name space, unlike\n| the query.  If you are using hierarchical tools to manipulate\n| hierarchical spaces, it is best to avoid escaping from the hierarchy\n| in arbitrary ways.  A hierarchy is, after all, simply a pre-established\n| query with a defined order among elements.\n\nI&#39;ve done something like...\n\n/ws/student/jsled\n  - something identifying the resource of the Eternal Student me.\n\n/ws/student?emailId=jsled-nospam@...\n  - which returns a [0,1] list which matches the element, and could\n    conceivably return a redirection response [3xx in http].\n\nI like the queries as exactly that ... queries.  I don&#39;t see a problem\nwith a query for the resource by ID, but I don&#39;t think the query is a\n&quot;good&quot; identifier for the resource itself.  Probably specifically because\nof that &quot;[0,1]&quot; part ... if it returns 0, what is the URI identifying?\n\n\nAlso, consider an implementation binding [&quot;HTTP++&quot;] that had a QUERY\noperator with a body.  Your use of URI now becomes a {uri, body} tuple,\nwhich is going to be cumbersome ... especially if you&#39;re going to use RDF.\n\n| The third reason is that there is only one query portion of a URI.\n| If you use it for silly reasons, then it won&#39;t be as useful for\n| actual queries (user-driven options).\n\nIndeed.  Especially since of certain limitations of the query-param space,\nyou could end up with -- at the least confusing -- parameter-aliasing\nissues to get different slices of information.  If students have an\nhome-address-id, you might end up with something like...\n\n/ws/student?id=001&otherid=002\n\n... in which case you need to define an order of sub-query execution,\nwhich sucks.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://www.asynchronous.org - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
