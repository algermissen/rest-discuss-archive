I have to do so because I&#39;m studying what are the \n differencies between implementig such a problem using PVM libraries\n (in a local network) vs. using a RESTful way (in a potential\n world-wide network).\n \n My questions are:\n\n \t- I cannot use CGI, fastCGI or servlet. I need a method\n or a library in C that allow me to bind, on the server side,\n (name of the resource requested, method to handle it), just as a\n xml-rpc-like way (e.g. the &quot;method registry&quot; used in xmlrpc-c server\n library).\n Can someone suggest me what library/method to use?\n\n\t- What do you think about my search topic? Can someone\n suggest me something on how can I expand it?\n\t  \nAny help would be very appreciated.\nLuke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
