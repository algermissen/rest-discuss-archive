If you base=\r\n your app on URI juggling, you will lose much flexibility. The rule of thum=\r\nb is that you should find your resource without composing it piece by piece=\r\n. It should be the same /people/{id} than /12345 where 12345 can be a frien=\r\nds list or a single person.\n\nSecond, the IDs or a resource are the URIs. Th=\r\nat is why it sounds odd to add the ID to the URI. Maybe that ID is the Data=\r\nbase ID, in that case please remember another rule: try not to expose your =\r\nwhole database schema using URIs and such. Make the client&#39;s life as close =\r\nto business as possible (hide the database IDs).\n\nThird, try working from c=\r\nlient&#39;s view. That is, in a typical business case, what is your client tryi=\r\nng to do, what does it want? What info does it have to work with?\n\nFor inst=\r\nance, you may want, before requesting for friends, search for a profile. In=\r\n that case, the URI from the root should point to a search resource (people=\r\n itself) that when you do a get it will return either a list of people, or =\r\na list for forms to search by (name, last name, security number, etc). So y=\r\nou send another request with the info that best matches your situation.\n\nOn=\r\nce you get the profile URI you are looking for, then you can ask for its fr=\r\niends. But then look that the friends search is an &quot;operation&quot; of the profi=\r\nle resource, not of root.\n\nIn another example, if your client has the so ca=\r\nlled ID, and you want to directly search for its friends, then you may have=\r\n a friends search resource, that will accept that ID as a query parameter. =\r\nNote this is sent as a query (in the payload is POST, or as a query in the =\r\nURI), not as part of the URI path.\n\nBoth paths are valid, and there may be =\r\nmore. Please check which is the most business oriented and that makes more =\r\nsense from the client&#39;s point of view, and then implement from there.\nThe &quot;=\r\nMenu&quot; of options when you get the root, should be the ones that are permitt=\r\ned at that state of the application. If you do not have the famous ID, then=\r\n friends is not a valid link from there and should not be included in the l=\r\nist. When you have the URI of the profile, then you may want to see the new=\r\n &quot;menu&quot; that may not include some of the root but will include new ones mor=\r\ne related to working with an specific profile. See?\n\nHope this helps.\n\nWill=\r\niam Martinez Pomares.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pablo.fernande=\r\nz@...&quot; &lt;fernandezpablo85@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m designing a small web=\r\n service interface, trying to make it as RESTful as possible. The content-t=\r\nype served is XML, and I&#39;ve got a few calls, for example:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /people/=\r\n\n&gt; GET /people/1/\n&gt; GET /people/1/friends\n&gt; \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to use =\r\nHATEOAS so I decided to return kind of an &quot;index&quot; of all supported services=\r\n when the client GETs the root (&quot;/&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; This &quot;root&quot; resource is going to =\r\nbe something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;api&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;network href=3D&quot;/capabilities&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n   &lt;profile href=3D&quot;/people&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;friends href=3D&quot;/people/id/friends&quot; /&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;/api&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; My question is, in the &quot;friends&quot; tag, how do I state that th=\r\ne id is a parameter? This value should be generated by the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; Als=\r\no kind of any advice would be really appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
