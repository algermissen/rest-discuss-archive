These semantics include what happens when\n&gt; you interact through HTTP with them (e.g. &quot;PUT /lock&quot; creates the lock\n&gt; or &quot;DELETE /lock&quot; deletes the lock). This is the result of turning\n&gt; specialized APIs into a uniform API.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this sense the resources have a type and clients use this\n&gt; information to achieve the goals that constitute a given RESTful API.\n&gt;\n&gt; The important thing in my opinion is that the resources do not have\n&gt; these types out of themselves but that what matters is by what link\n&gt; the client discovered them. E.g. given &lt;link rel=&quot;lock&quot; href=&quot;/locks/\n&gt; 344&quot;/&gt; a client could know that it can use /locks/344 to establish a\n&gt; lock on the link source resource (by way of the definition of th elink\n&gt; relation). For the moment the client will think of /locks/344 as being\n&gt; &#39;a lock&#39;.\n\nI am thinking about using &quot;hypermedia context&quot;[1] for the notion of the\nacquired linking (and document appearance) knowledge about a resource.\nFor example, when a client comes across a &lt;collection&gt; element in an\nAtom Pub service document and if that &lt;collection&gt; includes a category\nfoo then the resource the &lt;collection&gt; element refers to is known by\nthe client to be in that certain &#39;hypermedia context&#39;.\n\nA specification could name the described context as &#39;the foo  \ncollection&#39;.\n\n&#39;Hypermedia context&#39; emphasizes that the &#39;classification&#39; is all about\nhow the resource appears in the client&#39;s built-up applicaton state.\n\nI am not quite there yet, but I think there are interesting ways to\nformalize &#39;hypermedia context&#39; as a set of individual &#39;link tests&#39; that\nevaluate to true. E.g. if have-link(x , &#39;edit-media&#39;, y) then y &quot;can be\nused to modify a Media Resource associated with that Entry&quot;[2]\n\nIt also touches on the idea of duck typing[3].\n\nJan\n\n[1] http://algermissen.blogspot.com/2009/09/hypermedia-context.html\n[2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-11.2\n[3] http://www.propylon.com/news/ctoarticles/040224_duckmodeling.html\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Likewise, API specifications will use type-like language to describe\n&gt; how the API goals are achieved. Atom Pub for example writes:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;4.2 Documents and Resource Classification\n&gt; A Resource whose IRI is listed in a Collection is called a Member\n&gt; Resource.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; I do not see how this notion of &#39;type&#39; could be avoided.\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 2, 2008, at 1:41 AM, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you call the concept of &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;types&quot; of resources in\n&gt;&gt; your RESTful designs?
