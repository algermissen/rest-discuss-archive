Performance-wise, it would probably be\n&gt; dog-=\r\nslow without reinvesting the years of effort that went into\n&gt; current brows=\r\ners implementations. Also, most clients wanting native\n&gt; apps do so because=\r\n they feel that a web app would feel alien or be\n&gt; less visible. I can tell=\r\n that we have made applications in the past\n&gt; which could have been better =\r\nserved by a web app (or as well as);\n&gt; but don&#39;t forget the marketing aspec=\r\nt of being &quot;on the app store&quot;.\n&gt; The nature of the beast is that clients as=\r\n much as users prefer\n&gt; native application to web apps in most cases.\n\n\nDan=\r\n, you&#39;re missing the point.\n\nYou&#39;re conflating HTML as a payload media type=\r\n and HTML as a page\npresentation and markup language. HTML can easily be a =\r\n&quot;dual use&quot;\ntechnology.\n\nConsider this vCard example:\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;\n=A0   &lt;a class=3D&quot;fn org url&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.commerce.net/&quot;=\r\n&gt;CommerceNet&lt;/a&gt;\n=A0   &lt;div class=3D&quot;adr&quot;&gt;\n=A0=A0=A0   &lt;span class=3D&quot;type&quot;=\r\n&gt;Work&lt;/span&gt;:\n=A0=A0  =A0 &lt;div class=3D&quot;street-address&quot;&gt;169 University Aven=\r\nue&lt;/div&gt;\n=A0=A0=A0   &lt;span class=3D&quot;locality&quot;&gt;Palo Alto&lt;/span&gt;,\n=A0=A0=A0  =\r\n &lt;abbr class=3D&quot;region&quot; title=3D&quot;California&quot;&gt;CA&lt;/abbr&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n=A0=A0=\r\n=A0   &lt;span class=3D&quot;postal-code&quot;&gt;94301&lt;/span&gt;\n=A0=A0=A0   &lt;div class=3D&quot;co=\r\nuntry-name&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/div&gt;\n  =A0 &lt;/div&gt;\n=A0   &lt;div class=3D&quot;tel&quot;&gt;\n=A0=A0   &lt;span=\r\n class=3D&quot;type&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/span&gt; +1-650-289-4040\n  =A0 &lt;/div&gt;\n=A0   &lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;tel&quot;&gt;\n=A0=A0=A0   &lt;span class=3D&quot;type&quot;&gt;Fax&lt;/span&gt; +1-650-289-4041\n  =A0=\r\n &lt;/div&gt;\n=A0   &lt;div&gt;Email:\n=A0=A0   &lt;span class=3D&quot;email&quot;&gt;info@...&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;\n  =A0 &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s HTML with a vCard microformat.=\r\n The difference between that and\nan equivalent specific XML format for repr=\r\nesentation is, really, hair\nsplitting. Even the size is likely not dramatic=\r\nally different.\n\nWould an XML representation be &quot;tidier&quot;? Sure.\n\nBut this i=\r\ns HTML, it&#39;s also XML, and it has 101 uses and 101 more\nparsers, viewers, p=\r\nrocessors, libraries and languages to work with it.\nWhy? Because it&#39;s HTML.=\r\n HTML is everywhere. Everyone knows it, and\nit&#39;s immediately recognizable.\n=\r\n\nIs it immediately recognizable as a vCard? Yea, maybe, if you look at\nthe =\r\ndetails of it. To a system that knows how to process vCard, it&#39;s\npretty cle=\r\narly a vCard. To Google? Who may care less about vCard?\neh...not really imp=\r\nortant.\n\nProcessing of this payload is no more dramatic than parsing a spec=\r\nific\nXML payload. It may have a few more XML elements than a hand tuned\none=\r\n, but that&#39;s hardly whats going to crush your performance.\n\nNow if you&#39;re p=\r\nassing around lots of chrome, and pretty navigation and\nCSS headers, and ot=\r\nher crap, sure the payloads going to bloat up. Who\nsays you have to do that=\r\n?\n\nPeople also confuse the semantics of the media type with the semantics\no=\r\nf the application. The media type is not the application, it&#39;s simply\na rep=\r\nresentation. You&#39;ll notice that the HTML standard doesn&#39;t mention\nanything =\r\nabout search, shopping carts, formula conversion, or photo\nstorage. All app=\r\nlications that can be implemented using REST and HTML.\n\nThe application is =\r\nthe application. And it has to be documented, folks\nand processes need to b=\r\ne trained or coded to that application, etc.\netc. Media types are not docum=\r\nentation.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
