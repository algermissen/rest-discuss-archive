Please, put it here. And it will try to create the \n&gt; resource or replace it if it already exists.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the POST is to send something to a particular resource. The \n&gt; resource knows what to do with the payload. For instance, if you post \n&gt; some text to a blog, then the blog resource may add your text as a blog \n&gt; post.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this particular case, POST is the best option. Search may be one or \n&gt; even several resources, to which you post a query document. The search \n&gt; resource may create a new result resource you can then get. The search \n&gt; may be so intelligent, that if the query parameters yield an already \n&gt; created resource, then it will create a new one but return the one \n&gt; already there.\n&gt; ...\n\nThere&#39;s also SEARCH which is defined to be safe (as opposed to be POST), \nbut allows a request body. On the other hand, the way it&#39;s currently \nspecified makes the response body rather WebDAV-specific (which may or \nmay not be a problem).\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
