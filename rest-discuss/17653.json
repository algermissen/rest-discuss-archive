By using a Rest architecture more and\n&gt; more, we found that it=\r\n is easier to have the two teams design the documents\n&gt; to be exchanged and=\r\n not worry about an API/method calls to be properly\n&gt; documented.  The less=\r\n coupling there is between the client app and the\n&gt; server app, the less co=\r\nupling there is between the client app developers and\n&gt; the server develope=\r\nrs.  This helps a lot because if a server dev need to\n&gt; completely rewrite =\r\none part of the app, it has no impact on the client and\n&gt; so, no need to co=\r\nntact the client side team to discuss impacts, new method\n&gt; calls, etc etc.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Could this just be from leveraging HTTP properly?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Another po=\r\nint is that HTTP and JSON are well supported on most mobile\n&gt; devices and p=\r\nretty lightweight.  Statelessness is also a design contraint\n&gt; which makes =\r\nsense on a phone, you can&#39;t assume that a user will perform a\n&gt; transaction=\r\n all in one go.  Being stateless, you can have an application\n&gt;  maintain i=\r\nts own state, right on the device, and a &quot;transaction&quot; can thus\n&gt; span many=\r\n hours if the user network connection is intermittent.\n&gt; &gt; Right, another a=\r\nrchitectural constraint.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, what I studied and discovered last=\r\n week, is that by using proper\n&gt; hypermedia, we will be able to decouple th=\r\ne client and the server even more.\n&gt;  We plan on having one single landing =\r\npage for all our applications and from\n&gt; there, the client will be able to =\r\nnavigate and find its own server.  This\n&gt; will simplify things so much!  No=\r\n more need to call Toronto to ask where\n&gt; have they deployed the latest ser=\r\nver for this or that app.  They will update\n&gt; the URI on our landing page a=\r\nnd the clients app will catch up by themselves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is the client =\r\nin your case? Is this a machine?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I could go on and on but in the =\r\nend, the more we respect the REST\n&gt; constraints, the simpler and reliable t=\r\nhings seem to be.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; True, but at a definite cost which is why I asked=\r\n my question.

The person\n&gt; would open the application an=\r\nd have fields to enter the from/to dates. It\n&gt; would then tap a &quot;Get Availa=\r\nble Rooms&quot;. The app would call the server and\n&gt; get back a list of rooms al=\r\nong with prices and other details.

I understand how I wo=\r\nuld only need to GET the\n&gt; http://rent-a-room.com URI hardcoded and then in=\r\n the response I would have\n&gt; the http://rent-a-room.com/available-rooms URI=\r\n given. But... My\n&gt; application would expect each &quot;call&quot; to return some pre=\r\n-defined data and\n&gt; &quot;rel&quot;, those can&#39;t appear out of the blue?!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that both the business process and\n&gt; the=\r\n data exchanged must be known to my client application at the moment of\n&gt; c=\r\noding it, and those can&#39;t change                           without breaking=\r\n\n&gt; existing clients.

My application=\r\n would expect each &quot;call&quot; to return some pre-defined data and &qu=\r\not;rel&quot;, those can&#39;t appear out of the blue?!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that both the business p=\r\nrocess and the data exchanged must be known to my client application at the=\r\n moment of coding it, and those can&#39;t change =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 without breaking existing clients. But reading =\r\nabout REST, every is talking about loose coupling and not breaking clients.=\r\n.. I just don&#39;t see it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What am I miss=\r\ning?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot and sorry if it is a stup=\r\nid question!&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; --&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; blog:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://eikonne.wordpress.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://eikonne.wordpre=\r\nss.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; twitter:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://t=\r\nwitter.com/eikonne&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/eikonne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; --&lt;br&gt;&gt; blog:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://e=\r\nikonne.wordpress.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://eikonne.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; twitter:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/eikonne&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/eikonne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--bcaec5215ad7b7835c04a978d460--\r\n\n"}}
