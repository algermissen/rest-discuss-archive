The media-type must define how to discover  \n&gt;&gt; relationships between resources; and how the client can build  \n&gt;&gt; requests to interact with the server.  HTML and AtomPub do this  \n&gt;&gt; already.  Urge the audience to use these instead of rolling their  \n&gt;&gt; own.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t help but disagree about AtomPub (I think you mean to say  \n&gt; Atom). It provides a payload format with some generic metadata and  \n&gt; links, but it does not take away the need to define media types to  \n&gt; describe the contents of atom:content. So, if a server uses Atom to  \n&gt; describe a user, it needs to use some media type to describe that  \n&gt; the content is a user and not, say, a car.\n\nPlease forgive my misuse of Atom vs. AtomPub.  My minds merges them  \ninto one blob.  If you know of a good semantic distinction, please let  \nme know so I can learn to avoid making this mistake in the future.\n\nPlease take a look at the GData API.  Using the &lt;atom:content&gt; element  \nis not the right approach, because as you correctly stated, it still  \nneeds its own media-type definition.  That&#39;s just pushing the problem  \nfurther down the stack.  Instead, one can augment the Atom definition  \nto convey the extra information.  Atom needs fairly little more work  \nto be general purpose.  The only thing I found lacking in Atom (or  \nAtomPub, I&#39;m still confused), is that there is no facility for  \ndescribing the structure of a new entry.  This means, Atom can only be  \nused by generic clients for reading, modifying, and deleting existing  \ndata, but not create new data.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [25] Standardization\n&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t agree with this.  REST states constraints, but does not  \n&gt;&gt; define further specifics.  For WOA, I totally agree, because now it  \n&gt;&gt; includes HTTP, HTML, AtomPub, RDF, URIs, etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You had to bring in &quot;W&quot; again :) I still think that the distinction  \n&gt; you are trying to make is not necessary. I also find it very  \n&gt; distracting as encourages fluff around REST. There is enough fluff  \n&gt; on the &quot;S&quot; side.\n\nI sincerely wish you were right.  But the &quot;W&quot; (shudder) helps me  \npartition my mind into REST vs. REST-on-the-Web.  This slide is a  \ngreat example of how easy it is to erroneously slip from one subject  \nto the other, even for experts.  If all the &quot;W&quot; does is to avoid ever  \nagain seeing a presentation that starts with saying &quot;REST&quot; and  \nimmediately follows it with &quot;GET, PUT, DELETE, ...&quot;  It will have done  \nus all a great service! :)\n\n- Steve\n\n"}}
