You might give your username/password to some=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; else, so I must log all accesses and make a judgment as to whether =\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; not the requests are abusive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [hvw] I would have to have mal=\r\nicious intent, if I were to send along my\n&gt; password to someone.\n\nNot neces=\r\nsarily...\n\n&gt; Whereas lots of security compromises could be accidental. I wa=\r\nnt my friend\n&gt; Jim to have your email address, so I forward him the last ma=\r\nil you sent me.\n&gt; Unfortunately that mail contains the ViewCVS url with the=\r\n crown jewels. If\n&gt; the resource were protected by username/password, Jim c=\r\nould not access it.\n\nThat email might also contain your username/password. =\r\nAfter all, the\npassword must be sent to you some way.\n\nFor example, if you =\r\nopen an account with mozdev.org, the project\napproval and introduction emai=\r\nl will include various relevant URLs for\nyour project (such as the mailing =\r\nlist), in addition to your\nusername/password for controlling these resource=\r\ns.\n\n&gt; As a resource owner, I would want to at least require a deliberate,\n&gt;=\r\n malicious action, to compromise my resource\n\nAbsolutely, so transmit a cap=\r\nability URL using a mechanism that you\nwould use to transmit a password of =\r\nequivalent value.\n\nFor example, a more valuable password or capability URL =\r\nwould be\nbetter transmitted using a PGP encrypted email.\n\n&gt; -- not a casual=\r\n one, like copying a link.\n\nThe implications of doing this can be made more=\r\n obvious by controlling\nwhere the link can be copied from. For example, a P=\r\nGP encrypted email\nexplaining the purpose and use of the link.\n\n&gt; I appreci=\r\nate the simplicity of this scheme, and it&#39;s probably appropriate\n&gt; where th=\r\ne crown jewels aren&#39;t involved!\n\nWhich is mostly what we use the Internet f=\r\nor.\n\nApplications involving the crown jewels are by definition more\ndemandi=\r\nng. Our existing applications (email clients, web browsers)\naren&#39;t well sui=\r\nted to working with high value authorities. A lot more\ncould and should be =\r\ndone to improve this infrastructure.\n\nIn building such infrastructure, I wo=\r\nuld build on capability URLs, not\nusername/password. There are engineering =\r\nissues to be tackled in\nmaking better software based on capability URLs, bu=\r\nt there are\nsemantic problems with username/password.\n\nUsername/password sc=\r\nhemes suffer from cross-site authorization issues.\nFor example, consider a =\r\nresource at my bank which will perform a spend\nwhen sent a POST with the ex=\r\npected HTTP Auth credentials. This\nresource may be located at &lt;https://bank=\r\n/account/pay&gt;. Imagine I log\ninto my bank account, check on some pending tr=\r\nansactions and then go\nvisit some interesting blogs. At the end of a blog p=\r\nost is a form\nsubmission button that claims to create a blog post comment. =\r\nThe form\nactually points to &lt;https://bank/account/pay&gt; and does a spend whe=\r\nn I\nclick on it. I click on the button, and my browser does the form POST,\n=\r\nhappily responding to the bank&#39;s HTTP Auth challenge using it&#39;s cached\ncopy=\r\n of my password. The spend goes through as it was sent from my\nmachine, usi=\r\nng my password.\n\nAccess control list (ACL) based mechanisms don&#39;t work in a=\r\npplications\nwhere there is communication between users. Capability-based\nme=\r\nchanisms can work.\n\nTyler\n\n--\nThe web-calculus is the union of REST and cap=\r\nability-based security:\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\nName your trusted=\r\n sites to distinguish them from phishing sites.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/=\r\nextensions/moreinfo.php?id=3D957\n\n"}}
