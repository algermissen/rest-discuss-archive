But there&#39;s also serious disadvantages,\n&gt; such as messing up browsing (i.e. hitting &quot;Back&quot; doesn&#39;t remove the\n&gt; cookie), plus resource consumption on the server.  Obviously the pros\n&gt; outweight the cons for browsers.\n\nThe back button is a (literally) a world in itself and cookies are \nincidental to it.\n\n&gt; Cookies are the way they are because they got deployed first, and they\n&gt; did the job.  \n\nMaybe. But if we keep refusing to use TTPs then there isn&#39;t a better \ngame in town that storing state on servers. I&#39;ll also observe that \neven if cookies vanished tommorrow, the server would still need to \nhold state to deal with back button &#39;semantics&#39;, which are not \nunlike trying to write software while an evil pixie inserts random \ngoto statements into the code.\n\n\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do better for non-browser based\n&gt; apps, which was I was so disappointed to see the WS-I Basic Profile\n&gt; support them as a state mechanism.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n"}}
