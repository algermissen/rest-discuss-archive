So yes,\n&gt; you do need a TURN/ETRN and it won&#39;t be backwards compatible. My\n&gt; instinct is to have the client open a socket and ask for a backchannel\n&gt; with a POST. The server creates a &quot;listener&quot; and returns the port number\n&gt; and maybe some authentication data. The client connects *not* using HTTP\n&gt; but using a &quot;reversible socket protocol&quot;. The client and server\n&gt; understand that on the reversed socket they have swapped roles.\n\nYes - this sounds good. REST by its nature has &#39;passive resources&#39; and\n&#39;active clients&#39; that initiate operations upon those resources - it\ninherently implies direction of messaging. To implement this in the real\nworld - as with http - you naively open a connection to the resource - but\nif it is behind a firewall then you can&#39;t. Hence Paul&#39;s suggestion -\nseparate who /initiates/ the networking from the /direction/ of messages. I\ndon&#39;t have a problem with the protocol for behind-the-firewall access being\nnon-HTTP or at least non-sanctioned HTTP clone. I don&#39;t think it is\n/required/ to avoid HTTP (tunneling &#39;message/http&#39; for example) for it to\nwork - perhaps to make it more efficient, but people are at zero today,\nanything is an improvement.\n\n\n\n"}}
