I keep asking folks to\nexplain to me how it could be possible that using nonstandardized types\nis congruous with REST&#39;s emphasis on standardized types.  Or to explain\nhow an identifier being used on the Web that isn&#39;t in the IANA registry\nis congruous with Roy&#39;s clear explanation of self-descriptiveness:\n\n&quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\npoints to a specification and the specification explains how to process\nthe data according to its intent.&quot;\n\nIn lieu of such explanation, I&#39;ll not be shouted down, because I&#39;ve\nbacked up my assertions by quoting directly from REST, Roy&#39;s\nexplanations of REST, Squid configuration files, explanations of\nvarious intermediaries which do things like prefetch DNS lookups (which\nwon&#39;t work if your identifier doesn&#39;t distinguish between links that\nneed lookups and those, like namespace URIs, which do not), and so on\nand so forth.\n\nRecommending in favor of the opaque identifier in this context:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6569\n\nInstead of pointing out exactly what Mark pointed out, not only goes\nagainst REST, but also against pragmatism.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
