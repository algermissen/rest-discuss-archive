That is true. But REST does not say you can&#39;t bu=\r\nild systems any other way, and does not say any other system may not commun=\r\nicate with you. What it says is, you need to talk to me this way to achieve=\r\n this. If I talk differently, then I put in jeopardy that goal. Maybe the s=\r\nentence is badly formulated, or read out of context sounds like there is no=\r\n constrain.\n\nWhat I mean is you follow REST constrains to get REST goals, i=\r\nf there are things that are not perfect, you loose a little. But with any a=\r\nrchitectural style, you may need to combine.\n\nIt may be a good discussion o=\r\nf whether REST badge may be removed if there is just one non-complaint comp=\r\nonent in the system. When I think of SOA, I&#39;m perfectly aware that not all =\r\ncomponents are going to be services, that won&#39;t make it less SOA for that. =\r\nWe can make the same analysis with REST.
