Thanks a lot to e=\r\nverybody who has contributed! Hopefully you now understand the problem :-)\n=\r\n\nThe suggested solutions has been:\n\n1) Mint a new media type.\n\nApparently t=\r\nhere are two different schools here. Some say, yes, go for a new media type=\r\n. Some say, no don&#39;t. And there is no agreement upon which is best. See htt=\r\np://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18183 for a discussion=\r\n of this.\n\n2) Use different URIs for the different vocabularies.\n\nThis seem=\r\ns like an easy and well understood solution. As Mike puts it: &quot;in my experi=\r\nence, attempts to do &quot;multiple things&quot; while using the same URI are not oft=\r\nen successful&quot; (meaning, &quot;go for multiple URIs&quot;).\n\n3) Switch on a media typ=\r\ne parameter in the accept header (as for instance &quot;application/xhtml+xml;pr=\r\nofile=3Dxxx&quot;).\n\nTo me this seems like the most elegant solution - if it wor=\r\nks. Some people argue that the &quot;;profile=3Dxxx&quot; parameter may get stripped =\r\nby intermediaries in the network. It has the advantages of minting a new me=\r\ndia type, but none of the drawbacks since it is still a well known media ty=\r\npe (if this is the right interpretation of the syntax!)\n\n4) Switch on other=\r\n headers like for instance the user-agent.\n\nNot a generally used solution.\n=\r\n\n5) Use all vocabularies in the same document.\n\nTo me this seems too clumsy=\r\n.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
