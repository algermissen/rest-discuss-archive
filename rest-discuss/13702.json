But it&#39;s not, \nunless that hipermedia &quot;drives&quot; the states changes, if it&#39;s the &quot;engine&quot; \nof such state changes.\n \nOr in Roy Fielding words, &quot;The problem is that just being connected is \nnot enough (...) hypertext as the engine of hypermedia state is also \nabout late binding of application alternatives that guide the client \nthrough whatever it is that we are trying to provide as a service.&quot;\n\nSo the constraint is well described as &quot;hypermedia as the engine of \napplication state&quot;. HATEOAS is just for short. Like the name of the \ncountry located between Mexico and Canada is called United States of \nAmerica. Now you could dislike call it USA, and you can call it just \nAmerica, but this last term is ambiguous, it can be a country or a \ncontinent or a musical band... Even if you refer to it as &quot;America \ncountry&quot; (like in &quot;Hipermedia constraint&quot;), will it be America the \ncountry or any other country in America the continent? Or even a a music \ncalled &quot;country&quot; performed by America?\n\n&quot;Linkability&quot;, &quot;Connectedness&quot;, &quot;hipermedia constraint&quot;, &quot;links as state \ntransitions&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia Describes Protocols&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia constrains \nprotocols&quot;...  Well, &quot;a rose by any other name would smell as sweet&quot;...\n\nHere&#39;s the other thread for those who don&#39;t remember it\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12730\n\n(Just to clarify, I didn&#39;t say that there were a consensus to &quot;leave \nthat alone&quot; as you wrongly imply in your post. So, to be clear, what I&#39;m \nsaying is, unless there is a consensus, we should leave it alone)\n\n\n\nEric J.

Nobody knows where &quot;HATEOAS&quot; came from or\n&gt; who started it or anything, so I doubt anyone will be offended if we\n&gt; drop the silly acronym.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HATEOAS is starting to appear everywhere....\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just me but I think that the term HATEOAS is detrimental\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in at least two ways. It has the negative connotation of having HATE\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inside it and also covers what is one of the most important aspects\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of REST &#39;hypermedia&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I therefore make the serious proposal to burry HATEOAS and actively\n&gt;&gt;&gt; use &#39;hypermedia constraint&#39; instead before its too late.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Any supporters?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;     \n\n\n"}}
