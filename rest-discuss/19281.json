Bear in mind that the text of an RFC is available for further\n&gt; processing within the IETF so while it is desirable that the original\n&gt; author is involved in any updates thereto, that is not a requirement\n&gt; thereof so if you cannot get any response from them, then submitting an\n&gt; RFC5261-bis yourself is quite in order; but quite a lot of work.\n&gt;\n&gt; A simpler approach is to include the relevant changes in\n&gt; draft-wilde-xml-patch\n&gt; and state that this is an update to the relevant sections of  RFC5261.\n&gt; These should give more context than the errata do but need not be much\n&gt; longer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or you can include sections that clarify the issues you have identified\n&gt; in RFC5261 and state in your I-D that your I-D is based on this\n&gt; interpretation ie you are not updating RFC5261 for the world at large\n&gt; but are modifiying the content thereof for the purposes of your I-D.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or you can make normative references to errata by URL once they are\n&gt; approved.  I think this the most fraught approach and so the least\n&gt; desirable.\n\nafter thinking about these options for a while, i decided to go with the \nsecond option. http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-xml-patch-04 is \nthe updated draft and now officially updates RFC 5261. \nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-xml-patch-04#appendix-A lists all \nthe changes to that RFC, and i have based this appendix mostly on the \nerrata i had filed before. this approach seems to be much less work than \nrepublishing RFC 5261, and since the changes are rather small, the \nupdates aren&#39;t that hard to read and apply, when you have to read them \nin addition to RFC 5261.\n\nthanks again and kind regards,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
