I like regular expressions for this reason. it&#39;s a \n&gt; very simple engine that allows for a great deal of work to be \n&gt; done quickly and reliably. I like XSLT for the same reason. \n&gt; Very little compiled code is needed in order to accomplish \n&gt; tasks. XSD has the same advantage, IMHO.\n\nIn response my position is that both RegEx and XSLT are too complex and too\nfragile to offer solutions on a broad scale. They are really only great\nsolutions for top-tier developers where those developers encapsulatie their\nwork and never require average developers to have to interact with RegEx and\nXSLT (think of mod_rewrite as a great counter-example.)\n\nIOW, RegEx and XSLT let me consider things to be nails, but I&#39;d really like\nto have tools that are better designed for things that are not nails.\n\nAnd I say this after building a very complex XLST solution a few years ago\nthat in hindsight I could have probably done in another manner in 1/10th the\ntime and had far less problems with it.  I can also say the same of trying\nto use SOAP many years ago when I really should have been using (something\nlike) REST.\n\n&gt; I also view T-SQL as a useful engine for handling data. \n&gt; Typically, it takes more resources to bootstrap T-SQL, but \n&gt; with the continued growith of small relational engines (ala \n&gt; Gears) this is still a very valuable engine to leverage.\n\nThere&#39;s where we can agree. I&#39;ve used T-SQL for over 10 years and for 10\nyears prior to that worked with and wrote a book about[1] record-based data\nprocessing languages (xBase.) Today I&#39;m using the MySQL variant of SQL\ninstead of T-SQL, but they are conceptually close.  I do pine for many\nfeatures of T-SQL/SQL Server though.\n\nOTOH, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d use SQL as a web-service content type, expect maybe\nfrom the server to the client ala Google Gears, but certainly not as\nsomething a client gets to send to a server.\n\nAlso one day I plan to blog a rant aboutu how I feel the poor choice in\ninitial SQL language design has hampered maintainability and reliability\nincluding criticizing the required ordering of FROM WHERE, GROUP BY, and\nORDER BY clauses, criticizing the use of commas as field seperators, and\ncriticizing how INSERT and UPDATE have incompatible syntax as well as\ncriticizing implementations that don&#39;t support arguments of SQL clauses\n(field lists, join structures, and criteria expressions) as reusable\nfirst-class objects.\n\n&gt; Any time I can use an engine to complete a task, I&#39;ll do that \n&gt; before I start to write script or code.  \n\nDitto, but...\n\n&gt; And right now the \n&gt; XML family offers a great number of useful engines. And I can \n&gt; count on consistent performance on any platform and almost \n&gt; any language.\n\n...they must be deployed and JSON parsing directly to objects is deployed by\ndefault in browsers. As a way to elaborate I&#39;ll employ Aristotle Pagaltzis\ntechnique and paste a few links that I already presented him in an earlier\nemail:\n\nhttp://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=39842a17-781a-45c8-ade\n5-58286909226b\nhttp://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/01/03/45560.aspx\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
