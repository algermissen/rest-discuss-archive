These issues are also being addressed by UN/CEFACT.  Their \ngoal is to be able to conduct legally-binding business trades \nelectronically.\n\nIn general, the rules for electronic business trades need to be \nspelled out in a computable form that is published and accessible to \nboth trading partners.  \n\nebXML has a SOAPy version of such rules in XML documents in their \nBusiness Process Specification Schema. Version 1.01 was accepted by \nUN/CEFACT and OASIS and can be found here:\nhttp://www.ebxml.org/specs/index.htm\n\nVersion 2 just went into public review.\n\nUN/CEFACT is refining the rules in terms of states of business \nresources as we speak, due to be published in the fall.  That&#39;s the \nstuff that I think will be suitable for REST.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
