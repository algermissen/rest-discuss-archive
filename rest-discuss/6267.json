This new acronym nicely \nconnects the REST style with the mainstream SOA (Service-Oriented \nArchitecture) term.\n\nEven though REST is already describing the style that Web-oriented \narchitecture should follow, the WOA term is more concrete and could help \nus democratize REST in the larger enterprises that tend to follow the \n&quot;official&quot; SOA trend, and especially the WS-* related specifications.\n\nThe term was originally coined by Gartner as a subset of SOA in this \npost: http://blog.gartner.com/blog/index.php?catid=31&blogid=9\n\nSee also the post from Dion Hinchcliffe:\nhttp://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=27\n\nMy definition of WOA: an application of the REST style for building Web \nservices based on straight HTTP and XML documents.&quot;\n\nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\nDr. Ernie Prabhakar wrote :\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hat tip to Sam Ruby for pointing out this post about &quot;Web Oriented \n&gt; Architectures&quot; (WOA) as an alternative to SOAP  Service-Oriented \n&gt; Architectures:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=43\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The REST vs. SOAP debate can seem like an esoteric discussion about \n&gt;&gt; Web services, but it&#39;s not.  REST puts the Web back into Web services \n&gt;&gt; by taking what&#39;s been so successful with the fundamental protocol of \n&gt;&gt; the Web, namely HTTP, and making it into a seemingly ideal Web \n&gt;&gt; services architecture.  This model has been called Web-Oriented \n&gt;&gt; Architecture in certain quarters, and the label does seem to fit. \n&gt;&gt; REST, and its little brother, XML over HTTP, have increasingly \n&gt;&gt; gathered mindshare lately by sheer Darwinian competition.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/79282_p.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=27\n&gt; \n&gt; http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=9\n&gt; \n&gt; I personally would prefer something like ROA -- Resource-Oriented \n&gt; Architectures -- but I must admit the lack of a convenient handle does \n&gt; make it difficult to contrast REST with SOA&#39;s, and WOA does at least \n&gt; convey the point of REST &quot;services that work the way the web does today.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  (and don&#39;t forget, WOA is a /subset /of SOA and is not disjoint, as \n&gt;&gt; long as you follow the principles of SO).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; What do the rest of you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Ernie P.\n\n\n"}}
