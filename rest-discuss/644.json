GET Events requires only one endpoint\n&gt; &gt; to be a server.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an aspect of the asymmetry problem, particularly the asymmetrical\n&gt; hardwiring of &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; roles.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the context of what we&#39;re discussing, we&#39;ve deemed it safe to assume that\n&gt; notifications happen between resources, with the implication that both ends\n&gt; have a resource namespace and respond to (at least some) HTTP requests ---\n&gt; everything is a server.  How those requests actually get from end to end ---\n&gt; i.e., connection directionality, etc. --- are out of scope, but there are\n&gt; various options, cf. [1]  In general, the formula for dealing with this\n&gt; requires an external and open &quot;rendezvous&quot; server coupled with a tunnel that\n&gt; allows a requests to flow downstream and responses upstream over a long-lived\n&gt; GET connection to a resource on the rendezvous server.\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/SwitchboardPattern\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
