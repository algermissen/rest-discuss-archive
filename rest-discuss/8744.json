There&#39;s no stateless connection (indeed, no\n&gt; connection). There is no cache. There is no uniform interface. There is\n&gt; no layered system. Code-on-demand isn&#39;t even applicable as a concept\n&gt; (you already have all the code).\n&gt;\n&gt; 0 out of 7 constraints met.\n\nThere certainly is client-server. Windows and UNIX provide VFS and\npurely virtual file system abstractions. Plan9 exposes almost\neverything through 9P (a client-server protocol).\n\nThere is a cache as well: use windows to browse into a .zip file.\nFirst time it&#39;s slow, then much faster.\n\nThe cmd line shell and graphical browsers are clients to a uniform\n(but not COD) interface. Windows exposes the my printers and the\ncontrol panel inside Explorer, Gnome and KDE expose even more things\nthrough a VFS.\n\nLayered system and COD? Well, those aren&#39;t very common. I would argue\nthey should be an option.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Of the data elements:\n&gt; Resource: Closest thing is the files. Lets give you that one rather than\n&gt; argue - 1 data element.\n&gt; URI: Yep, can even be a real URI (&quot;file:///...&quot;)\n&gt; Represetation: This is a big one where your argument falls down. Okay,\n&gt; if you have an NTFS file system you can have different streams in a file\n&gt; and sort of kludge it that way, but you can&#39;t get to that easily through\n&gt; what&#39;s put in front of you. On balance; no.\n\nWindows does fall down on this, especially because many things in\nExplorer aren&#39;t available in the cmd.exe shell.\n\nLinux with FUSE, Gnome, and KDE certainly provide this type of capability.\n\nThere is no sign on of conneg is these file system apis though, that\nis clearly missing.\n\n&gt; Representaiton metadata: No distinction between rep, res and ctrl\n&gt; Resource metadata: No distinction rep, res and ctrl\n&gt; Control metadata: No distionction rep, res and ctrl\n\nWindows provides streams, Linux provides xattrs, Reiser provides...\nwell anything.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2 out of 6 at a push. 1 out of 6 really as talking about files as\n&gt; resources is okay, but talking about resources as files is not only\n&gt; wrong but dangerously so (since it&#39;s common mistake).\n\nPosix files can be pipes and sockets. These can be backed by any\nservice implemenation. Plan9 models tcp and upd connects as files!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Connectors:\n&gt; I can&#39;t even find a force analogy for most of them. Let&#39;s say explorer\n&gt; is a client, the file system a server and leave it at 2 out of 5.\n&gt;\n&gt; Components:\n&gt; 2 out of 4 for the same reason.\n\nLots of things mentioned above could be connectors or components. I&#39;ll\ngrant it&#39;s not too common. FUSE moving into the Linux kernel is\nspeeding the development of filesystem components and connectors. For\nexamples, see the list of file systems implemented in FUSE:\nhttp://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarity to REST therefore is (0/7) * (2/6) * (2/5) * (2*4) = 0%\n&gt;\n\nThe number are currently higher than this, and I would argue we should\nbe pushing the envelope further.\n\n&gt; [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
