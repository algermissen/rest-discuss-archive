SimpleDB is underwhelming. I wouldn&#39;t commit to using it as my only\n&gt; &gt; datastore. Whoever owns your database owns you, as they say, usually\n&gt; &gt; in relation to DB2. The fact that you can&#39;t use mysql or postgres on\n&gt; &gt; EC2 is a limitation of their architecture (And the fact that the sole\n&gt; &gt; persistence model of EC2 is S3). I&#39;m not convinced that simpleDB is\n&gt; &gt; the solution. I&#39;d rather something that adopted GData.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see Amazon offering SimpleDB as a replacement for general\n&gt; purpose relational databases. The press loved to say that it is going\n&gt; to take on Oracle et al last week, but that is not the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; The key use cases I see are:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Read-most\n&gt; - Simpler structures without needing referential integrity\n&gt; - Semi-structured, i.e. items don&#39;t need to have the same set of\n&gt; attributes\n\nJust like the Web.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For these cases, SimpleDB may be able to offer more affordable and\n&gt; *scalable* storage without having to employ armies of DBAs. Of course,\n&gt; enterprises won&#39;t touch SimpleDB. But if I am running a startup with\n&gt; some imagination to scale, I might consider it.\n\nThere&#39;s a whole category of databases -- I call them read consistency,\nas distinguished from write consistency (Oracle et al) -- SimpleDB is\none, also look at CouchDB and RDDB.  Essentially they move logic out\nof the database and into the application, so you end up trading DBAs\nfor developers, but also mainframe-era constraints for more modern\ntooling.  And that has the potential to be disruptive.\n\nSeparately there&#39;s the notion of moving your data to the cloud, which\nboth S3 and SimpleDB do in different ways, which seems problematic in\nterms of pricing and ownership, but also works nicely for SalesForce.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n\n"}}
