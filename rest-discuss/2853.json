First &quot;uniform interface drives\n&gt; integration complexity to O(N)&quot; is too easy to be true.  It doesn&#39;t\n&gt; take into account that while there is much similarity among peer \nbusinesses,\n&gt; there is also individuality, a/k/a competitive edge, which \nmandates, to\n&gt; a degree, custom interfaces.  \n\nDepends on what interfaces you are thinking about.\nIf it&#39;s for exchanges between companies, then uniform interface will \nbe a big win.  Companies exist as members of value systems composed \nof many other companies.  So you might think &quot;uniform interface for \nthis value system&quot;, as WalMart does.  But most of WalMart&#39;s suppliers \nalso belong to other value systems, including some with big dogs at \nthe head (e.g. Home Depot).  So even in WalMart&#39;s value system, there \nare forces for global uniformity.\n\nThat&#39;s why UN/CEFACT (the UN trade facilitation org) exists.\n\n&gt; Any time POST doesn&#39;t mean &quot;add this to a list&quot;, uniformity is only\n&gt; skin deep.\n\nI agree with you on this point, but think the second-level of &quot;what \nPOST means&quot; can also be boiled down to a minimal set of meanings.  A \nSwedish project connected to UN/CEFACT is working this out in terms \nof speech acts as we discuss here.  I&#39;ve tried to bring this topic up \nin rest-discuss several times, but no bites yet.  Regardless, I \nremain convinced it&#39;s on target.\n\n&gt; Secondly, your position in the scheme of things determines whether \nyou,\n&gt; personally will feel integration as O(N) or O(N^2) or something \nelse.\n&gt; Basically, God is the only one with the N^2 problem, because it&#39;s \nthe\n&gt; system view of the system.  \n\nIt&#39;s also the value-system view of the system.  For example, one \ninternational trade deal may involve 30 parties.  Right now, such \ndeals are very difficult to automate in-total.  Uniform interfaces \n(including what POST means in economic terms) will be required.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
