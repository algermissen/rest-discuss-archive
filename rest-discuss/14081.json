Mind, everything\nshould, inevitably, be discoverable from a simple GET /, but that&#39;s\njust an entry point like any other entry point.\n\nI don&#39;t think there is any requirement that there be a single entry\npoint in to your service, the root entry.\n\nAt the same time, however, the more entry points you publish, the more\nyou cede control to the client in terms of activities and operations,\nbecause ideally you are committed to those entry points that you\npublish, and the structure of those entry points. This is the balance\nyou&#39;re trying to achieve.\n\nAs for query parameters, these are not &quot;discoverable&quot;. That&#39;s simple\ntruth, at least not in an MtoM transcation.\n\nAll data types are essentially a priori information. Information that\nit is assumed &quot;everyone&quot; knows.\n\nNow, your search form is a perfectly acceptable way of publishing\ndocumentation for a search, but there should be no assumption that a\nsystem will be able to &quot;figure it out&quot;, and &quot;know what to do&quot; in order\nto search. That behavior will have to be coded.\n\nA programmer could send a request, and see the resulting payload and\ngo &quot;oh, I see how they want us to do searches&quot;, so in that sense, it&#39;s\n&quot;inline&quot; documentation. But, you can just as easily post a link to the\ndocumentation telling them the same thing.\n\nEven then, with your simple form, you&#39;ll notice theirs no information\nabout the contents of the search parameters, other than they&#39;re\nstrings. For example, in Google, the search criteria is really a\nsearch expression with a specific syntax.\n\nEven if you could publish a grammar of the syntax accepted by the\nsearch service, that doesn&#39;t really communicate the semantics of how\nyou would want to use it. Inevitably this will need to be documented.\n\nAll of the documentation can be bundled. You can call &quot;GET /&quot; and get\na human readable document documenting and describing all of the\nservices, while at the same time exposing those services and providing\nthe proper links that systems can use to use the service. It&#39;s nice,\nbut you can see how it can be expensive as well with larger payloads.\n\nMy only complaint with using XHTML as a content-type is that it&#39;s too\nvague. You may as well use &quot;text/plain&quot;. Both are perfectly adequate\nfor humans, but terrible for machines, which is why I prefer the\ndatatypes be as specific as possible. You can perhaps rely on\nmicroformats and other patterns within the XHTML, letting XHTML be\nmore a wrapper, then the machines can analyze an XHTML payload and\nlook for embedded formats that it understands. That&#39;s a good\ncompromise in this case, but when the client sees\n&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;, all it &quot;knows&quot; is that it&#39;s XHTML, there&#39;s no\ncontract that it actually contains anything relevant to the client in\nterms of microformats, or anything else.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
