I=\r\n want to offer an analogy that may clarify this.\n\nI think we all agree that=\r\n HTTP should be the basis for new technologies.\nThe question is whether the=\r\nse new technologies are new layers or new\nextensions. \n\nHere&#39;s an analogy t=\r\nhat might be useful. \n\nTCP is to HTTP as XML is to XHTML. XHTML is layered =\r\non top of XML and\nXML makes almost no semantic demands on XHTML at all. XHT=\r\nML can use an\nelement like &lt;title&gt; to represent something that is &quot;logicall=\r\ny&quot; an\nattribute and nobody complains. XHTML could use an attribute &quot;date&quot; t=\r\no\nrepresent something that &quot;logically&quot; has sub-structure and if anyone\ncomp=\r\nlains it is because they are making life somewhat more difficult for\ndevelo=\r\npers. But the XML standard does not say that you should use\nattributes for =\r\n&quot;metadata-like things&quot; and elements for &quot;content-like\nthings&quot;. It makes alm=\r\nost no semantic demands on the vocabulary at all.\nYou would have to work pr=\r\netty hard to violate the &quot;semantics&quot; of the XML\nspecification. All you coul=\r\nd do, really, is break the syntax -- be\nnot-well-formed. Similarly, applica=\r\ntions running on top of TCP have very\nfew semantic responsibilities. Both X=\r\nML and TCP are designed to say: &quot;do\nwhat you want, just obey the syntactic =\r\nrules of the specification.&quot; \n\nNow let&#39;s go up a step. XHTML is an XML appl=\r\nication (in the old &quot;SGML\napplication sense). HTTP is an application protoc=\r\nol. They *do* make\nsemantic demands on things building on top of them. In o=\r\nther words, you\nMUST extend, not layer, on them. &quot;P&quot; means &quot;paragraph&quot; in X=\r\nHTML. There\nshould never, ever, be a &quot;layer&quot; that adds another semantic on =\r\nP like\n&quot;parachute&quot;. That would destroy interoperability with XHTML processo=\r\nrs\nin a very dangerous way. The documents would be valid XHTML (according\nt=\r\no validating parsers) but meaningless! \n\nYou are supposed to extend XHTML w=\r\nith new elements, and you are supposed\nto &quot;subclass&quot; P with &quot;big paragraph&quot;=\r\n or &quot;important paragraph&quot; or\n&quot;disputed paragraph&quot; but you should never stat=\r\ne that in &quot;in my variant\nof XHTML, two P elements in a row means &#39;table&#39;&quot; O=\r\nnce you&#39;ve done that,\nit is no longer a variant of XHTML. It is a semantica=\r\nlly incompatible\nlanguage and interoperability will suffer. Browsers can di=\r\nsplay it (if\nit is valid XHTML) but they are displaying gibberish. \n\nImagin=\r\ne a future scenario where firewalls filter out all vocabularies\nexcept know=\r\nn ones like XHTML. Someone comes along and says: &quot;We really\nneed to route a=\r\nrbitrary new hypertext vocabularies through firewalls.\nHere&#39;s what we&#39;ll do=\r\n. We&#39;ll write in NewML and &#39;serialize&#39; down to HTML.\nIt won&#39;t be semantical=\r\nly meaningful HTML, because we&#39;ll use all of the\nelement types to mean what=\r\n we want them to mean, and &#39;deserialize&#39; back\nto NewML on the other side. N=\r\no, even better: we&#39;ll make a meta-markup\nlanguage and every man woman and c=\r\nhild can invent their own new\nhypertext markup languages that serialize to =\r\nand deserialize from HTML.&quot;\n\n\nNow if somebody proposed that, I would have t=\r\nhe following responses: \n\n * If you needed more features in HTML, did you a=\r\npproach the working\ngroup to add them? Having an incompatible bifurcation d=\r\noesn&#39;t seem\nproductive. Maybe we could all benefit from your new features? =\r\n\n\n * If the working group turned you down, did you consider using the\nexist=\r\ning, documented extension mechanisms? Millions of people have used\nthem wit=\r\nh success. How did they fail you? \n\n * Why do you have to piggy-back on HTM=\r\nL? Just because HTML slips\nthrough firewalls and is popular? Surely your ne=\r\nw markup language could\nhave achieved popularity of its own accord on the o=\r\npen market without\npretending to be HTML. Why not build on XML (TCP, in our=\r\n analogy). \n\n * Anyhow, why do we even need a framework for building hypert=\r\next markup\nlanguages? HTML is an extensible hypertext markup language which=\r\n\ndemonstrably satisfies most if not all distributed hypertext\npresentation =\r\nneeds. When there are a hundred or a thousand markup\nlanguage variants, wil=\r\nl interoperability be better or worse? \n\nThese are the questions REST peopl=\r\ne ask SOAP people. \n\nMy goal is to clarify why the relationship between SOA=\r\nP (when running\nover HTTP) and HTTP is very different than the relationship=\r\n between HTTP\nand TCP or TCP and IP. HTTP is &quot;top dog&quot; because it defines t=\r\nhe baseline\nsemantics for anything that builds on it, just as XHTML (or RSS=\r\n or\nDocBook or...) does.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  O=\r\npen Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extre=\r\nme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n\nTo unsubscribe =\r\nfrom this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
