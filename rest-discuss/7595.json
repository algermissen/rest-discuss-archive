You \n&gt; &gt;&gt; probably want canonicalized breadcrumbs. You have a back button if \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you want to retrace your steps; you have breadcrumbs to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; navigate the site.\n&gt; &gt; To paraphrase Dan Connolly, I think you and I are on \n&gt; different planets.\n&gt; My browser has a back button, so I&#39;d rather use the &quot;bread \n&gt; crumbs&quot; from his planet than yours.\n\nAnd I&#39;m happy for you to do so. The different, however, is I&#39;m not trying to\nkeep you or Hugh from doing it your ways.\n\nBill de hOra wrote:\n&gt; Actually, that&#39;s not unreasonable from a \n&gt; usability/accessibility perspective. There&#39;s no need to have \n&gt; your site walk reflected in the breadcrumb,\n\nI respectfully state that that is a matter of opinion. Like Jakob Neilsen, I\nbelieve that URL is UI[1] and if the URL doesn&#39;t reflect the site structure\nthen they are not &quot;hackable&quot; in the same way and hence not as good of UI.\nEveryone tends to optimize for those things they value, and I think you and\na few others here don&#39;t really value some things that are important to me,\nand vice versa. The problem comes when authoritative findings dictate one\nset of values at the expense of others instead of finding a way to service\neveryone&#39;s values.\n\n&gt; there is something to be said for &#39;static&#39; breadcrumbs \n&gt; that indicate the site&#39;s IA. This is more important today, \n&gt; as many people are dropped straight into a site via a \n&gt; search engine.\n\nSite&#39;s IA? \n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
