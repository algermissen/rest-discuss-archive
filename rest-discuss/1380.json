The other area I was attempting to explore was that of a state machine as hypertext, which this design does not address.\n\n&gt;To me, the data called out in the original document (appended at the end of\n&gt;the message) don&#39;t necessarily need to be full URI resources.\n\nAgreed\n\n&gt;I don&#39;t see the URIs, their structure or nesting as all that important.\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting comment in the light of the whole &#39;resource modeling&#39; side to REST.\n\n&gt;In the nested text shown above, the Participant1 could be an independent\n&gt;entity that is merely referenced by the trip, rather than being\n&gt;&#39;subordinate&#39; to the trip resource.\n\nTrue. I was going to say &#39;but the nesting above doesn&#39;t necessitate a dependant entity&#39; but in the light of the HTTP spec a sub-resource should be owned by its parent (in the sense a directory owns a file in it). I suppose the sub-resource could be a proxy for the real thing.\n\n\n&gt;-- step one --\n&gt;The overall flow of this example is as follows: A traveler will plan her\n&gt;trip\n&gt;by specifying the various stages of his overall journey and all of its\n&gt;participants. For each of the stages, the traveler specifies the location\n&gt;that\n&gt;she wants to visit as well as the date when she wants to begin and the date\n&gt;when she wants to end the particular stay. When the traveler is finished\n&gt;with\n&gt;this, she sends this information together with the list of all participants\n&gt;of\n&gt;the trip as well as the information about the credit card to be charged for\n&gt;the\n&gt;ordered tickets to the travel agent.\n&gt;\n&gt;== Create a new trip ===\n&gt;POST http://services.travelagents.com/trips/ HTTP/1.1\n&gt;Content-Type: text/xml\n&gt;Content-Model: TripSpecification\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;trip&gt;\n&gt;&lt;stage&gt;\n&gt; &lt;location&gt;maui&lt;/location&gt;\n&gt; &lt;start&gt;immediately&lt;/start&gt;\n&gt; &lt;finish&gt;never&lt;/finish&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/stage&gt;\n&gt;&lt;participant&gt;\n&gt; &lt;name&gt;Mike&lt;/name&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/participant&gt;\n&gt;&lt;payment&gt;VISA&lt;/payment&gt;\n&gt;&lt;recipient&gt;mdierken@...&lt;/recipient&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/trip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;== Acknowledgement of submission (with location of trip) ==\n&gt;HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\n&gt;Location: http://services.travelagents.com/trips/0173/\n\nWhat is Content-Model? Is it a standard HTTP header or an app-specific one? If it is the former, I cannot find mention of it in RFC 2616 (or anywhere else for that matter).\n\nOf  course this use case is somewhat simplistic as it does not mention problems such as changing participants or stages after submission, problems in seat allocation, flight cancellation, etc but it should serve well enough as a discussion focus.\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
