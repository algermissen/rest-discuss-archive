The (perceived) lower barrier to \n&gt; entry is only one of many factors in the spread of JSON.  The \n&gt; same-domain limitation of XHR and the ability to &quot;eval&quot; JSON \n&gt; from other domains is mentioned frequently, for example.\n\nActually, I would incorporate the facts of same-domain limitation of XHR and\nthe ability to &quot;eval&quot; JSON from other domains as part of (what you identify\nas only a perceived) lower barrier to entry. IOW, I believe all aspects that\nmake JSON more appealing is certain contexts have contributed its\nproliferation, not just one or a few; you couldn&#39;t even isolate those\nfactors if you tried.\n\nAlso, many say &quot;perception is reality&quot; and I think that is nowhere more true\nthan when a perception effects a choice. In this case if people are adopting\nJSON because of a perceived lower barrier to entry then that perception in\naffect becomes fact, at least for them.\n\n&gt; I say this as someone that has an appreciation for both JSON \n&gt; and XML and wishes that their proponents weren&#39;t quite so fanatical.\n\nSorry for appearing zealous on JSON.  I&#39;d argue for XML to someone who says\nthat JSON is all that is ever needed (though I doubt I&#39;d ever argue for XSLT\nthese days.)  It&#39;s just I hadn&#39;t found anyone here arguing for JSON&#39;s\nsuperiority, but have had people here argue that JSON is not valuable\nbecause of XML (or at least that was how I interpretted it.)\n\n&gt; META: This discussion has almost nothing to do with the original  \n&gt; thread or REST in general.  And I just added yet another message.   \n&gt; Whoops.\n\nWell there we go again... :)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org\n\n\n"}}
