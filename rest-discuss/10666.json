However, in other languages, such as Objective-C,  \n&gt; the inst=\r\nance construction process has two parts: allocation, then  \n&gt; initializatio=\r\nn.  I&#39;m personally a fan of the latter as it removes the  \n&gt; special case o=\r\nf the &quot;constructor&quot; concept.  The less moving parts, the  \n&gt; better, imho.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, for REST services, there is a bit of a problem it appears.\n&gt; 1) c=\r\nreate a new service A\n&gt; 2) send a initialization message\n&gt; 3) send regular =\r\nmessages\n&gt; \n&gt; Clearly, this stateful.  If a regular message arrives before =\r\nthe  \n&gt; initialization message (or, gasp, during), things don&#39;t work as  \n&gt;=\r\n expected.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, in case you think this is trivial, let&#39;s assume that d=\r\nuring  \n&gt; initialization of service A, other services need to be created an=\r\nd  \n&gt; they need to interact with service A during initialization.  In other=\r\n  \n&gt; words, service A needs to be reachable before initialization has  \n&gt; c=\r\nompleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?
