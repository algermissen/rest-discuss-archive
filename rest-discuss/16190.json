It&#39;s getting old.\n&gt; \n\nCan we put this in perspective, please?  What ever happened to the\nfolks here I learned REST from?  I can name those left using only my\nfingers to count, and most of those are like Roy, Julian, Mark, Jon,\nSubbu, Bill etc. who are ghosts of their former selves here with only\nJan and mca still posting with any regularity.  That list is dwarfed by\nthose who are just gone -- where&#39;s Aristotle, or Nic for example?\n\nTrying to help folks with REST takes a toll, and I won&#39;t hesitate to\nchalk that up to ungrateful, unruly, argumentative and flamey replies.\n\nYeah, I&#39;m as guilty as the next guy at times.  Why?  Maybe because I&#39;m\nthe only person here who&#39;s taken the time to distill out and post\nworking examples of my code instead of always relying on theoretical\nrequest/response patterns, such that they&#39;re available for public\nscrutiny.  Today, I posted two slightly-different versions of the same\nservice and got bitched at for not only posting one solution.\n\nWTF?!?  Just what exactly is it you people expect?  If you want in-\ndepth answers to every single question you constantly ask, then you can\npay me my $100/hr consulting fee.  As it is, this list is a damn\nbargain.  I could just as easily keep my work to myself, instead of\nopening myself up to attacks from all sides that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m\ntalking about, in public for all to see.\n\nIn fact, I could way the hell *easier* NOT post my work here, or take\nthe time to participate in discussions.  Talk about looking a gift\nhorse in the mouth.  It is not enough for some people to just disagree\nwith my answers, they take it further and bitch and moan about how\ninadequate those answers are to their needs.\n\nThat is what I have such a strong negative reaction to.  That&#39;s what\nI&#39;m so tired of.  That is what will lead me to follow everyone else\nhere who&#39;s simply had enough of that ridiculous attitude towards _free_\nhelp _willingly_ given, and just NOT any more.  You don&#39;t have to kiss\nmy ass, but if beyond disagreeing, you just don&#39;t like the answers I\ngive for whatever reason, I consider myself well within my rights to\ntell you to please STFU.\n\nBecause I&#39;ve had enough of that crap, and not just when it&#39;s directed\nmy way.  What started as a fun thread yesterday, turned into a\ndisaster.  If that&#39;s the price I must pay to participate, it is too\nsteep.  Since I&#39;m obviously at that breaking point, it would probably\nbe in my best interests to just not bother trying to teach REST.  Mark,\nI feel your pain.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
