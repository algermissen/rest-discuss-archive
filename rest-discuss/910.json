I come from the Business \n&gt; Process group. You&#39;re looking into DAML-S business process models. I \n&gt; think in some ways we are a generation ahead.  We do technology-\n&gt; neutral models, but are developing an RDF representation.  DAML-S is \n&gt; ahead of us on RDF, we&#39;re ahead in resource modeling and use of \n&gt; resource state for pre and post condition expressions.  I think in \n&gt; the near future we will try to get together with them (the models are \n&gt; similar enough to converge), but it&#39;s another case of too few hours \n&gt; in a day.  \n\nThat sounds cool.  But I still haven&#39;t made my mind up about DAML-S\nyet.  I think I&#39;ve read their docs 3 times by now, and it&#39;s still not\nsinking in for me.  Not sure why.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul Prescod:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really have the time to become an ebxml reg/rep expert but \n&gt; I do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel that the ebXML world is a natural ally for the REST world \n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they seem to be document-centric rather than API and software-\n&gt; centric.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Baker:\n&gt; &gt;Well, there&#39;s definitely conflicting goals there. \n&gt; &gt;It would not have been hard for them to decentralize \n&gt; &gt;without using REST, but they chose not to. \n&gt; &gt;So I think that there&#39;s forces at work there.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are definitely forces at work in the regrep group, and they \n&gt; come from your previous employer.\n\nI can neither confirm nor deny that. 8-)\n\n&gt;  Much of ebXML is P2P.  The \n&gt; business process stuff is all P2P at this point.  I think they would \n&gt; be open to REST.  Or at least I am, and so are some others in my gang.\n\nGood.  Invite them over!\n\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no value to evangelizing \n&gt; &gt; it to them. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s only so many hours \n&gt; &gt; in a day.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure why you keep repeating this to me. I&#39;m not regrep.  You \n&gt; don&#39;t need to evangelize me, I came to you.  All I want is to find \n&gt; somebody to discuss this stuff with me respectfully.  In particular, \n&gt; answer questions.\n\nI&#39;m obviously here for that reason.  Sorry Bob, I got the impression\nfrom the previous discussion that I was being asked to run out and\nevangelize REST on the ebXML mailing lists.\n\n&gt; Or actually I don&#39;t even need that, I can go back to lurking, and \n&gt; I&#39;ll get it just fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; One problem I am having now is that there are at least five different \n&gt; approaches for how to do the resource modeling on the table: mine \n&gt; (not a proposal yet), Paul Prescod&#39;s, Mike Dierken&#39;s, Jeff Bone&#39;s and \n&gt; Mark Baker&#39;s.  And there are some terminology issues confusing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; One terminology issue is &quot;accept&quot;:  the standard business protocol \n&gt; for contracts (orders are a kind of contract) is offer-acceptance. \n&gt; Accepted is also used as an HTTP response.  But the semantics of the \n&gt; two uses are very different.  \n\nI don&#39;t think this is an issue at all.  &quot;Accept&quot; is for content\nnegotiation, not for any kind of offer/acceptance mechanism.  You use\nit to say &quot;give me HTML&quot;, or &quot;give me JPEG&quot;.  I don&#39;t see them as\nrelated at all.\n\nNeither do I see the Accepted (202) response code being related to\noffer/acceptance.  It&#39;s a data transfer feature (&quot;response will not be\nreturned on this connection&quot;), not anything that has any &quot;business\nlevel&quot; semantics.\n\nI think if you asked Paul/Mike/Jeff/myself to model offer/acceptance,\nthat we would pretty much build the same model.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
