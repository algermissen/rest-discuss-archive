You&#39;re right that that document defines agents as both software  \n: and people, but I suspect most web users haven&#39;t read that document  \n: and may not know to not infer anything from URIs. My belief is that  \n: people do use the URI for clues as to information architecture, and  \n: therefore I think it is appropriate to design URIs with that in mind.\n\nPresent the &quot;information architecture&quot; through hypertext instead.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. You train your user to use the system at full leverage.\n\n2. You retain encapsulation of your implementation, and are\n     then free to change it without breaking your clients.\n\n: Mike can do that too, but all those things need to be at some URI  \n: each, so why not select a canonical URI for each resource that may  \n: help users figure out where they are in his information architecture.  \n: Users aren&#39;t depending on a URI meaning what they guess it means.  \n: They just try it and see if the representation matched their  \n: expectations. If it doesn&#39;t, they will quickly try something else. It  \n: is the representation that they ultimately depend on.\n\nWhat do we mean by &quot;canonical&quot; here?  I thought, in this context,\nit only meant &quot;authorized&quot;, as in &quot;which URL to redirect an alias to&quot;.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
