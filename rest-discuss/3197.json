Thanks!  I sense an opportunity here.  A couple of WG\n&gt; &gt; members are really close to getting it.\n&gt; What is the &#39;it&#39; that they should be getting? That visibility is good? Or\n&gt; that visibility without a constrained interface gets you nowhere?\n\nThe &quot;it&quot; is what visibility is, and why it&#39;s good, though I think if\nthe former is recognized, the latter will be clear.\n\nFWIW, and to answer Seairth, here&#39;s a quote from Roy&#39;s dissertation;\n\n&quot;[...]What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines that originate services.[...]&quot;\n -- http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_2\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
