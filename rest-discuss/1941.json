According to\n&gt; statements made on this list, the browser has created a new\nURI/identifier.\n&gt; This means that the browser is identifying a different resource than the\none\n&gt; that the server identified.  This is unlike all other URIs it was given or\n&gt; used.\n&gt;\n&gt; In terms of REST, is this okay?  Or is this issue delegated to the\n&gt; application-level (e.g. http in the example above)?  It seems to me that\n&gt; REST would have something to say about this, but what is it?\n&gt;\nI think this is &#39;okay&#39; - but that it increases coupling between the systems.\nIn some cases you may have no choice, but it is nice to know that there is a\nsimpler more de-coupled approach is available for most cases.\n\nI don&#39;t think Roy&#39;s paper talks about this directly, but it does talk about\nthe critical &#39;loose coupling&#39; that URI opacity provides. The conclusion that\nI make from this is that whenever two system coordinate on something which\nshould be loosely coupled, then you should try to make that area of\ncoordination loosely coupled as well. In the case of constructing URIs, then\nI would interpret that to mean provide an explicit description of the\nconstruction rules.\n\n\n\n"}}
