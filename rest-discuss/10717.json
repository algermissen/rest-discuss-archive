What is the difference between this, and say, packaging  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; same parts as some XML elements inside some envelope element?\n&gt;\n&gt; Several benefits:\n&gt; - Multipart messages are a standard way to represent compound payloads\n&gt; - You don&#39;t enforce the use of xml\n\nI don&#39;t disagree. But today&#39;s infrastructure does not deal with POST,  \nPUT etc packaged inside multipart messages. For instance, a cache  \ncan&#39;t mark an entry in the cache stale when a PUT is submitted via a  \nmultipart message. Yes, there are theoretical benefits, but it is  \ndifficult to realize those benefits in reality.\n\nThe basic motivation for proposals like this is to let a client submit  \na bunch of requests and get them executed in at once. The supposed  \nbenefit for the client is that it does not have to make &quot;n&quot; number of  \nrequests. However, IMO, once we get into the details, the picture  \nwon&#39;t be as simple as this. For instance, what is the cost for the  \nclient to recover from partial failures? What is cost for the client  \nand server to use two different code paths - one for regular requests  \nand another for batch requests? Does the client sufficiently  \nunderstand the difference between non-idempotent requests and  \nidempotent requests bundled in the same batch? For the simple cases,  \nyes, the answers may be simple, but IMO, the complexity of batch may  \noutweigh the benefits.\n\nMoreover, in most cases, even if pipelining could not be replied upon  \nfor whatever reasons, by modeling resources cleverly, it may be  \npossible to avoid the need for batch.\n\nSincerely,\nSubbu\n\n"}}
