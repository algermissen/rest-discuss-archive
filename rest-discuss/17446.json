There is n=\r\no answer there. If you change a resource, and parts of that resource are in=\r\n a collection somewhere, the http interface doesn&#39;t provide for invalidatin=\r\ng the &quot;associated&quot; collections.\n&gt;\n&gt; That makes the title example on par wit=\r\nh collections, same problem, no solution provided by http.\n&gt;\n&gt; The closest =\r\nyou&#39;ll get is the proposal by Mark (I think) to extend caching for the reve=\r\nrse proxy case, where you control said reverse proxy. There&#39;s content there=\r\n http://www.mnot.net/blog/Caching/\n&gt;\n&gt; That still won&#39;t solve any intermedi=\r\nary, so I think it&#39;s safe to say at this stage that this is a &quot;problem&quot; tha=\r\nt has always existed, won&#39;t be resolved, and no amount of restructuring of =\r\nPUT will solve it, so I&#39;d argue that there is no argument for or against ti=\r\ntle resources that scales in complexity beyond the local optimization of us=\r\ning Content-Location.\n&gt;\n\nI know that, I worked on a solution to this proble=\r\nm in parallel to\nMark&#39;s own work on LCI.\n\nActually, the HTTP interface does=\r\n provide a very limited way of\ndealing with that invalidation problem - as =\r\nJan pointed out you can\nuse CL and Location headers.. the point here being =\r\nthat it is\n_limited_ and therefore the more convoluted you make your &#39;depen=\r\ndency\ngraph&#39; with this super-composite approach, the less likely you are\ngo=\r\ning to be able to deal with it in a standard/visible way, and the\nmore you =\r\nwill have to lean on extra mechanisms such as the one Mark\nand I came up wi=\r\nth - at a cost to visibility.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
