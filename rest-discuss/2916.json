As such, it&#39;s not necessarily the \ncase that it needs a toolkit.  Certainly, it would be nice if tools \nmapped better to the model, but make no mistake:  every non-SOAP / \nnon-XMLRPC Web App out there is an existance proof (to a greater or \nlesser extent) of REST.

It&#39;s like that old saying:  the great thing about facts is\n&gt;&gt; that it doesn&#39;t matter if anybody believes them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if\n&gt;&gt; 99.9999% of the industry fails to understand REST (today);  it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; matter if Dave Winer ever gets a clue, or if the press fans this\n&gt;&gt; &quot;debate&quot; into such a hypestorm that everybody gets sick of it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST is hype-proof.  It&#39;s idiot-proof.  It&#39;s debate-free.  REST is\n&gt;&gt; about the things that made the Web successful;  loose coupling, \n&gt;&gt; naming,\n&gt;&gt; generic interfaces, etc.  You can&#39;t argue with the Web!  If you do, \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; just end up sounding stupid, like our buddy Dave.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can&#39;t treat the Internet like a LAN.  You can&#39;t pretend open \n&gt;&gt; worlds\n&gt;&gt; are like closed worlds.  Tight coupling isn&#39;t the same as loose\n&gt;&gt; coupling.  Coordination and composition doesn&#39;t work the same way in\n&gt;&gt; the wild.  That beautiful hothouse flower is gonna get clobbered by \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; kudzu if you plant it out in the yard.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Our industry has made several runs at this wall, and failed to get \n&gt;&gt; over\n&gt;&gt; it every time;  eventually, people will get it --- the key to learning\n&gt;&gt; is repetition.  Until then, those who didn&#39;t learn any any of the past\n&gt;&gt; { ONC RPC, DCE, CORBA, DCOM, RMI } attempts will just keep repeating\n&gt;&gt; history...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The only net effect of this is that eventually, when people finally\n&gt;&gt; *get* this thing, some of us will be justified in feeling, maybe just \n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; little bit, smug. :-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; jb\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
