I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure how that\n&gt; could be useful.\n\nI am saying that the sink API should do nothing but reify the whole notion of a\nresponse.  It should have the same capabilities, no more, no less.  If there are\ncapabilities needed beyond that the implementation of choice should be requests\nperformed by the sink.  If there are capabilities that have to be in the sink\nAPI then they have a high burden of proof WRT security.\n\nFor example, we can say a priori that the sink accepting mime headers is not a\nnew security risk, but we can&#39;t say the same about the sink doing Kerberos\nauthentication.\n\n&gt; &gt; Expiration is the inverse of caching,\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think so.  The expiry we&#39;re talking about is expiration of the\ncommitment on the part of the source to notify the sink.  That commitment is the\nsubscription abstraction, and can and probably should be reified.  Expiration\ndefines a sort of TTL for an instance of that subscription abstraction.\n(Actually, Expiration should probably be expressed as TTL rather than any\nabsolute date or time construct.)\n\n\nThe only parts of the sink API that should address caching are reply headers\nrelated to caching.  There&#39;s not much relevant there, so this is moot.  Because\nof that we can make a affirmative statement that the sink API is not the place\nto address expiration.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
