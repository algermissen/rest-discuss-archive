In a collection, a user can create\n&gt; entity &quot;=\r\ntypes&quot;* (e.g., Artist, Artistic Work, etc.), then assert a\n&gt; relationship b=\r\netween these two entity classes (e.g., Artist has many\n&gt; Artistic Works).  =\r\n It is then  pretty easy to represent  the\n&gt; relationship in Atom -- &lt;link\n=\r\n&gt; rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/artist/to/artistic_work&quot;\n&gt; href=3D&quot;http://examp=\r\nle.com/artist/to/artistic_work/&lt;artist_identifier&gt;&quot;\n&gt; title=3D&quot;Works&quot;&gt; on t=\r\nhe &quot;parent&quot; in the relationship.\n&gt; \n&gt; There could be an infinite number of =\r\nthese relations created by end\n&gt; users as they define entity classes and as=\r\nsert relationships between\n&gt; them.  Obviously, service docs could be dynami=\r\nc so as to represent\n&gt; these newly minted link relations, but since they wo=\r\nuld typically\n&gt; follow an easily regex-able pattern, I wonder if defining a=\r\n link\n&gt; relation uri template might make more sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --peter keane\n&gt; \n&gt; *types simply define the set of attributes available f=\r\nor the entity --\n&gt; e.g., birth & death dates for Artist, material & creatio=\r\nn date for\n&gt; Artistic Work.  Types are represented as an AtomPub Category d=\r\nocument.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
