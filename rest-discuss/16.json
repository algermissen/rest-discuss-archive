GET forms and POST forms are\n&gt; completely different beasts.  The latter is for submitting resource\n&gt; representations, while the former is an assertion that the specified\n&gt; resource is a logical container for other resources, and is indexed by\n&gt; some set of names encoded into a query term.\n\nI don&#39;t follow you. A form is a user interface. Today forms are often\nused as user interfaces to GET and to POST (i.e. filling in an\ninformation request as opposed to submitting data). XForms is the\nreplacement for HTML forms. Over time browsers will move to this more\nfunctional user interface and yet lose out on the ability to do\nform-based GET. I see that as a problem.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
