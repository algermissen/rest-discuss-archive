In this case, which response\n&gt; code is more appropriate to reflect multiple resources creation? (201\n&gt; Created?)\n[hvw] \n[hvw] I was just working through this case a couple of weeks ago! This is a\nminor omission in HTTP. \n\nYou cannot send multiple Location headers! That would violate\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2. \n\nThe best choice is just to construct a hypertext entity linking to all the\ncreated resources, and return it with the 201 or 303.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And what if server failed to create some of them (i.e. the phyiscal\n&gt; storage has full, unableto store last two files). How do we construct\n&gt; a response (and resposne code) that reflect such partial failure\n&gt; accurately?\n&gt; \n\n[hvw] Again, we are out of the range of the spec, into your application&#39;s\nsemantics. \n\nIf I were in charge of the service design I&#39;d probably choose to make one\nmultipart POST succeed or fail altogether, as a transaction. In that case\nyou clearly know to return 2XX or 4XX.\n\nIf it&#39;s not possible to do that, then I&#39;d just return 201 for partial\nsuccess with an entity explaining what happened.\n\n\n\n[hvw] Hugh\n\n\n\n"}}
