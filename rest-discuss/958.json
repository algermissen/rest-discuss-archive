Two disparate systems have\n&#39;local&#39;\n&gt; &gt; names for something and don&#39;t know about each other. You receive a name\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; serviceA and need to do something via serviceB. Defining a pattern based\n&gt; &gt; mapping is handy. I don&#39;t know how to do it otherwise. Anyone? Anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm...  this is an interesting point.  Want to elaborate?\n&gt;\nAt the risk of my train of thought being derailed...\n\nA lot of information systems have &#39;fragments&#39; that can be passed to other\nsystems to control other information. These are like partial hyperlinks -\nthey aren&#39;t ready to be used without adjusting for the target information\nsystem. In a RDB the values in one table don&#39;t say much about whether you\ncan use them against another table, or in another database or a the file\nsystem, etc. The &#39;base&#39; part of database means its all been normalized. You\nneed a third thing to link the two systems together - thats what the set of\nqueries are after all (sure sure foreign key constraints, blah blah\nblah...).\nThese &#39;fragments&#39; of an address are just relative locations. If I wanted to\ntake data that contained &#39;hidden&#39; or &#39;truncated&#39; hyperlinks and make visible\nthe links lurking within, the values need to &#39;bubble up&#39; through name\ntranslation. From the value in a table, to the name of the table, to the\nname of the database to the name of the db server, etc. Expressing this name\ntranslation symbolically is what most web software (the procedural code\naspects) does today. This is probably just a convoluted description of &#39;link\nre-writing&#39;.\nDoing this &#39;link re-writing&#39; assumes you know what is being referenced by\nthe link - and that&#39;s where the problem comes in. You can generate many\ndifferent views, but someone will always want something different. They will\nknow about a third information system that uses the same value as a lookup\nname, but you don&#39;t know anything about it and so cannot generate the link\nto it. You have to provide a &#39;relative name&#39; and let the client/intermediary\ndo the rest.\n\nI see the power of information in the &#39;joins&#39; between data systems. Taking\nvalues from one place (email addresses from an ldap server) and generating\nreferences into another (home folders on disk, searches on google, entries\nat hotornot, inboxes at hotmail, etc.) is easy and leads to cool systems\nlike the web itself. Doing this by keeping an explicit instance-based\nmapping is tedious and unnecessary. Generating the links via symbolic\ndescriptions of the naming transform sounds looks better to me.\n\nmike &#39;sleepyhead&#39; d\n\n\n"}}
