DELETE -&gt; Resource doesn&#39;t exist.\n&gt;&gt; 3. DELETE -&gt; Resource exists even less?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On my workstation, I&#39;m always deleting files twice.  The first time I\n&gt; delete a file, the file itself is not altered or moved, yet now it\n&gt; appears in my &quot;trash&quot; until I delete it for a second time.  When the\n&gt; file is in the trash, its status is &quot;used to exist&quot; but after it&#39;s\n&gt; been deleted from the trash its status is &quot;not known to have existed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m simply applying this everyday computing paradigm to an HTTP server.\n&gt;\n\nIn that case the resource should be moved to a new &quot;trashcan&quot; resource\nand the first DELETE should return a 301 or other redirect pointing to\nsaid resource.  The 2nd DELETE should be directed to said trashcan and\nthe file could then be completely purged (204).  Explicitely DELETING\nthe same resource twice is counter-intuitive and IMO breaks idempotence.\n\n-- \nAaron Dalton       |   Super Duper Games\naaron@...   |   http://superdupergames.org\n\r\n--------------ms070509080304080207000309\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms070509080304080207000309--\r\n\n"}}
