The only thing I wasn&#39;t sure\nabout was whether everyone agreed on what the &#39;function&#39; relates.\nMy explicit GET was intended to mean exactly what you have\nexplained, namely that the function is from resource pre-state to\npost-state, and the latter always visible to client.  In my\ntwo-method model of function, I should have included no-op in\nthe list of alternates for mutators, so that *nothing* followed by\na GET is also a &#39;function&#39;.\n\nWhat&#39;s the trivial proof?

If anything, D is the domain from which\n&gt; &gt; representations are drawn and (D -&gt; D) represents the mapping of a\n&gt; &gt; pre-state for a given resource to its post-state, and in that sense,\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;return&#39; value of the function we&#39;re interested in means that\n&gt; &gt; the function is defined as a pair\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \t(PUT | POST | DELETE) /foo &lt;representation&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \tGET /foo\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So that the final get represents the function&#39;s value (i.e., the\n&gt; &gt; second &#39;D&#39; in the mapping from D -&gt; D).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Other definitions of &#39;idempotent&#39; refer to things like recursive\n&gt; &gt; inclusion of C header files; not very enlightening.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the first definition is just fine. The function here is the \n&gt; request, and the domain and range are states of the server (feel free \n&gt; to replace &quot;server&quot; with &quot;resource&quot; throughout if you&#39;d prefer, it \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t make any difference).\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s write s, s&#39; for states of the server, g(s) and p(s) for,\n&gt; \n&gt;   GET /foo\n&gt; \n&gt; and,\n&gt; \n&gt;   PUT /foo    (with a fixed PUT entity)\n&gt; \n&gt; respectiverly, applied to the server in state s. The 9.1 definitions \n&gt; imply that,\n&gt; \n&gt;   g(s) = s\n&gt; \n&gt; hence,\n&gt; \n&gt;   g(g(s)) = g(s)\n&gt; \n&gt; because GET is both safe and idempotent. OTOH, the imply that,\n&gt; \n&gt;   p(s) = s&#39;   (where typically s&#39; != s)\n&gt; \n&gt; because PUT isn&#39;t safe, but,\n&gt; \n&gt;   p(s&#39;) = s&#39;   \n&gt; \n&gt; because PUT is idempotent, and hence,\n&gt; \n&gt;   p(p(s)) = p(s)\n&gt; \n&gt; DELETE will be similar to PUT.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing to note here is that what the client sees isn&#39;t \n&gt; mentioned at \n&gt; all: all the above is defined in terms of server states and functions \n&gt; mapping server states to server states.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm ... spelt out this way, there&#39;s a trivial proof that all \n&gt; sequences \n&gt; of idempotent requests are idempotent sequences. That means \n&gt; that either \n&gt; there&#39;s something wrong with spelling things out this way (in which \n&gt; case, what?), or there&#39;s something not quite right with 9.1\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Miles\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
