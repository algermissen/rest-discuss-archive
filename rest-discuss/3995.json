This focusses on the collaborative aspect of the Web\n&gt; and kind of makes it possible for the Semantic Web to grow while\n&gt; still being &quot;on the Web&quot;. Did I get that right?\n\nI think so.  I like the way you phrased that, as if this were a feature\nrather than a bug.  Nice.\n\n&gt; OTH: is that documented somewhere?\n\nNot AFAICT.\n\n&gt; Why is there an ongoing\n&gt; debate within RDF/SW about what certain URIs denote and what not?\n&gt; (e.g. fragment-identifier-URIs pointing to Web pages etc.)\n\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s any one answer to that, unfortunately.\nEverybody sees things slightly differently.\n\n&gt; IOW: Is it *your* explanation/position? REST&#39;s position?  Is the\n&gt; RDF/SW community aware of this view at all?\n\nIt&#39;s mine, and I believe it to be in synch with Roy&#39;s, but I don&#39;t\nthink REST-the-architectural-style talks about it.  I figure it&#39;s an\nemergent property of REST, or any style in which identifiers can be\nlate bound to representations (i.e. pretty much every large scale\nsystem around).\n\nYes, the SW community is aware of this view.  The whole &quot;public meaning&quot;\ndiscussion is about it, and many involved seem to also see things this\nway, at least in part.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
