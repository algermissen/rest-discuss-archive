You might do the\n&gt;&gt; following:\n&gt;&gt; (A rather silly approach, but suitable for this example)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Define a service document media type application/ordering-srv+xml  \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; includes a &lt;order-processor href=&quot;&quot;/&gt; element to tell the client  \n&gt;&gt; where\n&gt;&gt; the resource is that accepts orders. Example:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;service&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   &lt;order-processor href=&quot;/service/1234&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/service&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You made your mistake in step 1.\n&gt; You don&#39;t define a media type for a service, you define it for a  \n&gt; type of client. If you define a media type for a service, i.e. so  \n&gt; that it can only describe the data and control options offered by  \n&gt; that one service, then a client that consumes that media type is  \n&gt; obviously coupled to the service.\n\nWell, I did not bother to say &quot;define a media type for a *kind of*  \nservice&quot; because it wasn&#39;t important for the point I am trying to  \nmake. I meant a media type along the lines of application/atomsrv+xml.\n\nYou need to tie service types to media types, otherwise you do not  \nhave a basis for defining what set of other media types are used by  \nthe service nor for service discovery by service type. But that is  \nanother story.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Your client can only do what is allowed by the media type(s) it  \n&gt; knows how to process. If you want to build a system where the client  \n&gt; is not bound to a specific service then you must define a (set of)  \n&gt; media type(s) that is able to define a space of services. The space  \n&gt; is constrained on the fly by the hypermedia processed by the client  \n&gt; to the specific service being executed.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s no magic here. A web browser can process any service that  \n&gt; can defined by HTML. If you start returning another media type then  \n&gt; the browser is stuck.\n&gt;\n&gt; And as I&#39;ve said before, take the human out of the equation. The  \n&gt; browser is rendering the content, turning it into messages to the  \n&gt; windowing system, and responding to messages (e.g. clicks) from the  \n&gt; windowing system. When you are defining a media type for a _client_  \n&gt; (rather than a service) you have to think about the client-side  \n&gt; system and how to drive it.\n&gt;\n&gt; So for your ordering client (that can interact with a wide range of  \n&gt; ordering services): what events cause something to be bought? What  \n&gt; information needs to be communicated to the underlying system to  \n&gt; facilitate an ordering decision? What information accompanies the  \n&gt; ordering event from the underlying system? Answer these questions  \n&gt; and use them to inform your media type design.\n&gt;\n&gt; The hypermedia document declaratively describes to the client how to  \n&gt; interact with the underlying system while in an application state.  \n&gt; It also tells the client how to translate client events into HTTP  \n&gt; requests for new resource representations and/or to modify resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; Content negotiation tells the server what kind of client it is  \n&gt; dealing with where &quot;kind&quot; is expressed as a (set of) media type(s).  \n&gt; This lets is represent the resource in a form that can drive the  \n&gt; requesting client.\n&gt;\n&gt; The key place where HATEOAS and client-server decoupling fall apart  \n&gt; in practice is when media types are defined for a service rather  \n&gt; than for a type of client. When a media type is an expression of a  \n&gt; specific service then HATEOAS isn&#39;t possible because the media type  \n&gt; not designed to express the variability between services that a  \n&gt; client can interact with in a way that is meaningful to the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead people express the options in a manner that is only  \n&gt; meaningful to the service and scratch their heads trying to figure  \n&gt; out how a client is supposed to make the decision without some kind  \n&gt; of &quot;human intelligence&quot; interpreting the choices. When you instead  \n&gt; design the media type around a type of client then you don&#39;t have  \n&gt; these problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
