The RFC doesn&#39;t say\nmuch about sequencing of possible subcomponents of a URI path segment.\n\nAlso, it&#39;s interesting to note that the RFC uses &#39;parameter&#39; to talk about\nsubcomponents of path segments (the stuff between slashes) but most\nprogrammers use the term &#39;parameter&#39; to talk about the query terms (the\nstuff after the question mark).\n\nAlso, RFC3986 is a well done document and provides great value to the\ncommunity.\n\n\n"}}
