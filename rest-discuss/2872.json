I&#39;m arguing about\n&gt; how technological innovation and proliferation happens, you&#39;re\n&gt; talking about how technology incrementally evolves.\n\nYes, I think that&#39;s possible.\n\nBut I think that the main point I&#39;m trying to make is that just like \n&quot;internet time&quot;, the idea of bandwagon and network effects have been \nbandied around a little too lazily. The technological environment is \nsubject to many forces pulling in many different directions, and I \nthink that the phenomenon I&#39;ve pointed to can, in at least some \ncircumstances, act as a counterveiling pressure to network effects.\n\nI take your point that the initial takeoff of a new technology might \nlook more like a bandwagon than a consensus forming process. \nNevertheless, I can&#39;t help wondering if this is partly due to focussing \nprimarily on technologies which _did_ take off and ignoring the many \nothers that fell by the wayside. Perhaps there&#39;s no need for explicit \nagreement, but there is a need to attract attention and foster \nadoption. And that fails more often than not ... just look at the \nactivity levels of, eg., SourceForge projects. To a certain extent, I \nthink you may be pointing to the successful bandwagons and saying &quot;Hey! \nLook! Getting a bandwagon going isn&#39;t all _that_ hard&quot;.\n\nI think I&#39;m pointing to a later stage in the game where new technologies \nare applied in pre-existing environments with pre-exisiting \nconstraints. It&#39;s not so much the technology which is the focus of \nconsensus forming, but the details of making it work in any given \ncontext. And I&#39;m also pointing to higher-level and narrower agreements \n... not about TCP/IP or HTTP or REST or SOAP, but, eg., about how \nwidget consumers and producers can use those technologies to buy and \nsell widgets. The semantic escalation makes agreement harder (&quot;just \nwhat _is_ a widget anyway?&quot;) and the narrower constituency means that \nwe&#39;re a long way from perfect markets (producers and consumers might \nknow each other, individual producers/consumers can influence the \nmarket, political and strategic conflicts loom large).\n\nClearly things aren&#39;t _always_ like that. But equally we&#39;re not always \nin the free market of ideas.\n\nI&#39;m also a little non-plussed, because it seems as tho&#39; your argument \nfrom heroic innovation also undercuts Mark/Roy&#39;s original point (but in \na different way from my argument). The original claim was that a \nuniform interface drives integration complexity to O(N). Heroic \ninnovation says &quot;screw the common interface, I&#39;m going _this_ way, \nfollow me if you dare&quot;. That might settle down to a _new_ common \ninterface later ... but if it does I&#39;ll bet there will have had to be a \nlot of consensus forming first.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
