They&#39;ve\ndeveloped a bunch of APIs that they think make this happen. \n\nSaid publishing house has been hired to put editorial on this\ntogether.\n\n\nSo I looked at one of AOLs offerings:\n\n  http://dev.aol.com/aol_video/index.html\n\nThere&#39;s a REST API!\n\n  http://dev.aol.com/aol_video/index.html\n\nExcept this isn&#39;t REST. It isn&#39;t even HTTP for God&#39;s sake. It&#39;s just\nstupid. There are methods embedded in the URIs. Everything is done\nwith GET. We were just talking about how stupid that was.\n\n\nI looked at the other APIs. Most of them incomplete, too locked down\nor just not very useful.\n\n\nThis has prompted a delicate exchange between me and the publishing\nhouse (clearly they will take money from anyone to do anything) as I\ntry to justify writing an article for them that calls their clients&#39;\nstuff rubbish.\n\n\nBut it also prompts me to think:\n\n  Who the **** is getting paid to come up with this stuff for AOL? Why\n  didn&#39;t they hire someone with a brain to do this?\n\nIf anyone knows a senior AOL manager please tell them I&#39;m available. I\ndon&#39;t have a brain but at least I can always borrow someone else&#39;s.\n\n\nThe last thing it makes me think is:\n\n  I wish Roy could protect the word REST in some way to stop companies\n  like this just being evil with it.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
