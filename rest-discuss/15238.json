I get a strong feeling that there is a substantial shift in this direction\n&gt;\n&gt; The shift is happening, but it appears that it is mostly a shift of hyped terms only and\n&gt; not a real architectural shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; The true application of REST would be a radical shift towards simplicity and decoupling\n&gt; and as far as my experience goes, enterprises are not yet willing to let go of complexity :-)\n&gt; I have recently persuaded myself that the ubiquitiousness of object-oriented thinking is a\n&gt; major obstacle. We have all been so immersed in OOA, OOD, classes, interfaces, etc.\n&gt; that it is really hard to think differently about software systems. Maybe the apparent rise\n&gt; of functional languages helps to cure that situation...\n\nI would argue about REST being simpler. I think it is certainly more\nelegant, and with that elegance comes implicit power, power that may\nnot be readily apparent, particularly in smaller applications.\n\nCombined with the paradigm shift in application design, a design not\nwell understood, and one that does not map well on existing\ninfrastructure, REST is rather disruptive to many existing\napplications, making adoption even more difficult.\n\nThe &quot;rise&quot; is REST is, like you said, in the &quot;hyped&quot; terms. Basically\nlittle more than RPC over HTTP with ad hoc, under documented payloads\n(not even necessarily media types). This is arguably no different than\nSOAP or XML-RPC. But it&#39;s REST because people just think of REST as\n&quot;stuff over HTTP&quot; and aren&#39;t &quot;burdened&quot; by following any existing\nstandards.\n\nI think there are far fewer practitioners of REST than there are folks\n&quot;making stuff up&quot; and calling it REST.\n\nFinally, using SOAP and WS WebServices today IS &quot;simple&quot;. It&#39;s a drag\nand drop button click on an IDE or tool set. The underlying details\nare complicated and mired in thick standards documents, but connecting\nup to a SOAP end point today is pretty simple.\n\n&gt; I think many enterprise understand that there is a benefit induced by REST and start\n&gt; trying. But it is extremely rare, for example, that people understand that media type\n&gt; design is at the heart of all design activity (as opposed to service interface design,\n&gt; which is an implementation detail in REST).\n\nExactly.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
