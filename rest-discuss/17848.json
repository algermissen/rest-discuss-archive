I wouldn&#39;t\ndo it personally but if I did, I imagine the potential for\ndiscrepancies on revisiting the bookmark to be quite high.. as a human\nI can adjust and handle that ok but not so much if I&#39;m a piece of\nsoftware. The rules can&#39;t be as liberal when the end user is not\nhuman, so there&#39;s significant limitations in trying to draw lessons\nfrom html for machine-oriented apps.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does the cachability of a response affect these issues?\n&gt;\n\nNo, they are two separate concerns\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, I am trying to answer the question:\n&gt;\n&gt; What are the indicators in media type (and link relation) specifications that tell\n&gt; the user agent implementor what URIs in responses of the media type in question\n&gt; can be considered bookmarkable?\n&gt;\n\nThe bits of a given spec that are explicit in specifying what\nconstitutes a valid entry point.\n\nThe question seems to assume that all media types (and their user\nagents) exist for a specific application, which is not always the case\n(e.g. HTML). In cases where the media type is generic, it isn&#39;t\npossible to establish entry points up front - which is why browsers\nallow users to bookmark whatever URL they want.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
