So,\n=\r\n&gt; what I&#39;m about to\n&gt; ask may have been discussed here before, but please,\n=\r\n&gt; bear with me :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s assume that we have a following situation:\n&gt; =\r\n(I&#39;ll write the key terms CAPITALIZED for better\n&gt; visibility, I&#39;m not\n&gt; ye=\r\nlling :-) )\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a RESTful APPLICATION available on the web\n&gt; and =\r\na client is\n&gt; using it (human client through web browser, to be\n&gt; precise).=\r\n\n&gt; Client has loaded the home page and therefore client\n&gt; can see the\n&gt; REP=\r\nRESENTATION of the CURRENT STATE of APPLICATION.\n&gt; Client can initiate TRAN=\r\nSITION (by means of selecting\n&gt; one of HYPERMEDIA\n&gt; LINKS contained within =\r\nthe REPRESENTATION of the\n&gt; current state) of the APPLICATION to another ST=\r\nATE.\n&gt; LINK contains (is?)\n&gt; URI which identifies one of application&#39;s RESO=\r\nURCES.\n&gt; By means of that URI and selected OPERATION derived\n&gt; from UNIFORM=\r\n\n&gt; INTERFACE (GET, PUT, ...) that RESOURCE is being\n&gt; manipulated with, mea=\r\nning that ANY number of ACTIONS\n&gt; are being initiated\n&gt; &quot;behind the scenes&quot;=\r\n on server.
