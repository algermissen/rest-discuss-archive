The only concern=\r\n is or backwards compatibility.  Say I have a resource representation that =\r\nis not following the convention because I didn&#39;t really understand the conv=\r\nention or didn&#39;t follow it the way it will be interpreted.  For example, ta=\r\nke the media type discussed in the previous post  that you mention, text/fo=\r\nrm+html.  Hypothetically, if I am producing that as a media type but really=\r\n what I am sending is a snippet that is not a valid HTML document, is there=\r\n any reason to fear that anything would stop working if proxies started int=\r\nerpreting that media type to expect valid HTML? &lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This situation woul=\r\nd be the same as not adhering to any other media type, i think. In fact you=\r\nr snippet would not even be a valid representation of the &quot;derived&quot; media t=\r\nype. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think, the only contraint would be, that e.g. a VALID &quot;applica=\r\ntion/atom+xml&quot; representation is still a valid &quot;application/xml&quot; representa=\r\ntion. As far as i know, this is anyway state of the art. it is just not sta=\r\nndardized (except for XML Media types [1]).\n&gt; \n&gt; The backward compatibilty =\r\nis also given for intermediaries: if they do know the derivation concept, t=\r\nhe visibility increases. if they do not know the correlation, they would ha=\r\nndle such a media type as an unknown media type. like an intermediary today=\r\n, who knows xml but not atom, would ignore atom documents.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://=\r\nwww.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jak=\r\nob Strauch&quot; &lt;jakob.strauch@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Due to previous posts [1] i was=\r\n asking myself, if it would make sense to standarize the usage of the + sig=\r\nn in media type indications.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think the benfit would be, that a m=\r\nore specific media type like  &quot;application/odata+atom+xml&quot; (which is curren=\r\ntly not existing) could be at least interpret as &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; (wh=\r\nich is currently the media type of an odata resource [2]).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An inte=\r\nrmediary could look at the media type &quot;application/odata+atom+xml&quot; and coul=\r\nd interpret it as a known atom representation, even if he don=B4t know the =\r\nodata media type. If atom is also unknown, maybe he is interessted, that it=\r\n=B4s a valid xml document, too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This seems to be just an conventio=\r\nn at the moment or standarized only for xml-based documents [3]. Furthermor=\r\ne, it would imho calm down the debate about generic vs specific media type.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/rest-discuss/message/17665\n&gt; &gt; [2] http://www.odata.org/developers/protoc=\r\nols/atom-format\n&gt; &gt; [3] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
