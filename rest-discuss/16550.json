IOW, mashups are OK, and you can\neven use FTP, etc. to create that mashup.  While I don&#39;t believe that\nclient-side storage is inherently unRESTful, I do believe that the\nWebSockets API specifically, is entirely unRESTful.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly this positions the web in a data-tier position where\n&gt; data is the resources named by URIs which each have a current state,\n&gt; that state is represented within and transferred via HTTP messages,\n&gt; likewise the state of a resource is manipulated with HTTP messages\n&gt; and usage of the HTTP verbs.\n&gt; \n\nI prefer to think of a URI as identifying a stored procedure which\nreturns some data, rather than identifying the data returned.  But,\nwhat you&#39;re saying is exactly what Roy is trying to get across in REST\nChapter 6.2.2, &quot;Manipulating Shadows.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Back to the point in hand, this also encourages a more modular\n&gt; approach to application coding where, each specific module only needs\n&gt; to understand part of a message. An analogy may be a user agent\n&gt; processing a single HTML document, where different parts of said HTML\n&gt; document are processed and understood by very different modules doing\n&gt; different tasks, one may hook in to understand &lt;script&gt;s of a certain\n&gt; type, another may hook in to dereference embedded links, another to \n&gt; instantiate DOM event listeners and so forth. Thus re-using,\n&gt; augmenting and extending existing media types (like HTML) makes\n&gt; perfect sense to me from all angles, including REST and it&#39;s\n&gt; constraints.\n&gt; \n\nVery well-put.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
