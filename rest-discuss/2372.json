I think the REST model says that there\nare resources, representations and identifiers.  A resource may have\nmore than one identifier, but an identifier identifies only a single\nresource.  A resource may have many representations, but a given\nrepresentation is a representation of only one resource (although\nit may look an awful lot like some representation of some other\nresource).  When you request the state of a resource (GET), you will\nbe given the representation that the server feels is most appropriate\nfor you in the circumstances.  Content negotiation headers aside,\nyou cannot directly request a particular representation of a resource.\n\nYou cannot directly address a representation.  If you could, then the\nrepresentation would, by definition, be a resource, which implies\nthat it also has representations, and hence the fractalness of resource\nthat Mike D pointed out.\n\nThe indirection of representations you are required to wade through\non your way to accessing resources is what accounts for the &#39;conceptual&#39;\nnature of those resources, more or less.\n\nThis model seems self-consistent.  Or does it?\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 1:40 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss; S.

Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty sure the URI identifies the resource, not a \n&gt; representation.\n&gt; &gt; Representations are transient things - unless you \n&gt; explicitly make the\n&gt; &gt; representation a resource in its own right - but that gets fractally\n&gt; complex\n&gt; &gt; (representations of a representation of a resource, etc.).\n&gt; \n&gt; But this doesn&#39;t jive with my understanding of REST.  You can \n&gt; never retrieve\n&gt; a resource.  You can only ever retrieve a representation of a \n&gt; resource.  If\n&gt; you want, you could call the representation a &quot;virtual&quot; \n&gt; resource, meaning\n&gt; that it can logically be treated as a resource, but does not \n&gt; necessarily\n&gt; have a direct correlation with an actual resource on the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see where anything gets complex here.  All that one can ever\n&gt; retrieve is a representation of a resource.  If you have two (or two\n&gt; hundred) URIs, each returns a representation of a resource.  \n&gt; If you take my\n&gt; PurchaseOrder URI1 and URI2 examples, URI2 is not a \n&gt; representation of a\n&gt; representation of the resource pointed to by URI1.  URI2 returns a\n&gt; representation of a resource.  URI1 returns a representation \n&gt; of a resource.\n&gt; Sure, they may both be pointing to the same resource, but \n&gt; that doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; that URI2 is subordinate to URI1.  If that *were* the case, \n&gt; it would mean to\n&gt; me that URI1 is now synonymous for the resource itself.  This \n&gt; would mean\n&gt; that a request to get the resource must return the resource \n&gt; itself, which we\n&gt; know is not possible.  Therefore, URI1 can only even be \n&gt; synonymous with a\n&gt; representation of a resource, which also means that URI2 cannot be\n&gt; subordinate to URI1.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This gets into what I call &#39;overlapping resources&#39; (a \n&gt; possibly poor term,\n&gt; &gt; but it works for me..) I think of URI2 as a &#39;synthetic \n&gt; resource&#39; or a\n&gt; &gt; &#39;derived resource&#39;. Operations like DELETE might not actually do\n&gt; anything -\n&gt; &gt; either indicated by &#39;not implemented&#39; or some other \n&gt; response - or they\n&gt; &gt; might, its up to the application to decide.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, based on what you are saying, if I were to add a \n&gt; querystring to the URI\n&gt; such that the returned data was potentially different, each \n&gt; valid variation\n&gt; of the querystring points to separate resource?  Using the\n&gt; URI-&gt;Representation POV, the querystring would returns different\n&gt; representations of the same resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if &quot;view&quot; would be a better word than \n&gt; &quot;representation&quot;?  Using the\n&gt; &quot;view&quot; imagery (warning: some may consider this very unRESTful):\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)  A &quot;view&quot; is the data returned by a server.  Each view has \n&gt; its own URI.\n&gt; More than one URI may return identical views, but they are \n&gt; not the same\n&gt; view.  In other words, there is a one-to-one relationship \n&gt; between views and\n&gt; URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) A view is not the same as a resource.  A view may be identical to a\n&gt; resource, but it is not the resource itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) PUT only creates association between a URI and a view with \n&gt; the added\n&gt; restriction that a subsequent GET of the URI returns the same \n&gt; view.  The PUT\n&gt; may cause the server to create a new resource or update an existing\n&gt; resource.  The actual resource may be different than the view \n&gt; created by the\n&gt; PUT as long as the view does not change.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) GET only returns views of a resource.  Idempotency of a \n&gt; GET means that\n&gt; the &quot;intent&quot; of the GET is to return a view only.  A GET may \n&gt; be considered\n&gt; idempotent even though resources are altered on the server as \n&gt; long as the\n&gt; GET wasn&#39;t being used to cause the alteration.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) POST sends data to a URI.  It is not sending the data to a \n&gt; view (views\n&gt; are what&#39;s returned).  In this case, URIs are &quot;black boxes&quot;, \n&gt; into which\n&gt; anything may be sent (though not necessarily accepted).  The \n&gt; function of a\n&gt; POST is not strictly defined, except that it does imply an \n&gt; intent to alter a\n&gt; resource (and is therefore not idempotent).  A view of the \n&gt; target resource\n&gt; may be returned by the server.  The contents of the view are entirely\n&gt; subject to the purpose of the POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) DELETE only destroys or invalidates a view (and therefore \n&gt; the URI that\n&gt; identified the view).  DELETE does not necessarily cause the \n&gt; deletion of the\n&gt; underlying resource.  For instance, a single resource may \n&gt; have multiple\n&gt; views (accessible by multiple URIs).  The server may only delete the\n&gt; resource after all of the views have been DELETEd.  DELETEing \n&gt; just one view\n&gt; would not, in this case, cause the underlying resource to be \n&gt; deleted (or\n&gt; even necessarily altered).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What this means is a clear picture of where the coupling is: \n&gt; between the\n&gt; view and the resource.  This means that the server has full \n&gt; control over how\n&gt; tightly or loosely coupled the resource is to the view that \n&gt; the clients\n&gt; receive.  What I mean by coupling here is the internal \n&gt; relationship of the\n&gt; expressed view to the actual resource.  Loose coupling means \n&gt; that while the\n&gt; view is related to the resource, it is not a direct corollary for the\n&gt; resource.  Tight coupling, on the other hand, means that the \n&gt; view is more of\n&gt; (or a direct) corollary for it&#39;s related resource.  To \n&gt; illustrate, the two\n&gt; servers in the following example both provide identical views \n&gt; and therefore\n&gt; identical functionality from the client&#39;s POV, while \n&gt; internally handling the\n&gt; resources differently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Server 1 (tight coupling):\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT &lt;data&gt; /path/file.html : creates a file and puts &lt;data&gt; \n&gt; inside that\n&gt; file.\n&gt; GET /path/file.html : opens the file and returns &lt;data&gt; \n&gt; inside that file.\n&gt; DELETE /path/file.html : deletes the file.\n&gt; POST &lt;data&gt; /path/file.html : invalid request.\n&gt; \n&gt; Server 2 (loose coupling):\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT &lt;data&gt; /path/file.html : takes data, chops it up in \n&gt; several fragments\n&gt; (for internal reasons) and places those fragments into a \n&gt; table on an SQL\n&gt; server.  At the same time, it also processes and adds \n&gt; keywords to an index\n&gt; table.  Further, it creates additional internal resources to \n&gt; provide links\n&gt; between &lt;data&gt; and the user that uploaded.\n&gt; GET /path/file.html : queries the SQL server and reconstructs \n&gt; &lt;data&gt; from\n&gt; its individual fragments.\n&gt; DELETE /path/file.html : only deletes access to the resource \n&gt; via this URI.\n&gt; However, since no other URIs are pointing to the same resource in this\n&gt; particular case, the server proceeds to delete the records in \n&gt; the SQL server\n&gt; and all related resources.\n&gt; POST &lt;data&gt; /path/file.html : invalid request.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to stop here for now.  I have had to step away from \n&gt; this message\n&gt; about 15 times so now I have somewhat lost my train of \n&gt; thought.  What I have\n&gt; above appears to be coherent to me, so I will start with \n&gt; this.  Now for the\n&gt; fun part... in what way(s) is this view wrong?  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
