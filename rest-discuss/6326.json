We set up a local Certificate Authority (CA) and \n&gt;&gt; gave both the clients and servers signed certificates and then \n&gt;&gt; configure the server to validate the clients certificates in \n&gt;&gt; addition to the default client check of the servers certificate.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, that&#39;s just what I want David.\n&gt;Do the client and server have identical certificates? I&#39;d understood\n&gt;that one (classically the server) had a private and public key in \n&gt;the keystore,\n&gt;and the client had the public key?\n\nThey need to share a common certificate authority - the idea is that \nboth the client and the server have a trust in the CA, so if the CA \ncertifies the two keys, then the client and server can trust each other.\n\nTherefor you need a total of three keys: one for the client, one for \nthe server, and one for the CA.  You use the CA key to sign the \nclient and server keys.\n\nThere are also three certificates involved for the same parties.  The \nCA certificate (it essentially validates itself), and the client and \nserver certificates signed with the CA key.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;  Problems in importing keys usually come down to one of two \n&gt;&gt; things: format and a confusion of the difference between a key and \n&gt;&gt; a certificate.  There are several formats and several quirky \n&gt;&gt; implementations of certificate stores, I&#39;ve always managed to find \n&gt;&gt; the right incantation for key format conversion via Google.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m currently using openssl to generate the certificate... holding the key :-)\n&gt;I&#39;ve selected PKCS12 as the format.\n&gt;I&#39;ve heard of, but not yet read of, and other standardised formats, nor\n&gt;that IIS or anything else required another format. Any references please?\n\nWikipedia actually has a good description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509\n\nLook for &quot;Certificate file extensions&quot; to see the lists of formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;  Keys are not the equivalent of certificates - a key is just that, \n&gt;&gt; a number you use to unlock the encrypted material, a certificate \n&gt;&gt; is a document that is signed by some authority to validate the \n&gt;&gt; content of the certificate.  In encryption this document contains \n&gt;&gt; the key and some sort of identifying information.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Key as used in GPG, Certificate as in &#39;signed envelope&#39; round a key?\n\nyes\n\n\n\n&gt;Thanks David.\n&gt;\n&gt;regards\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;Dave Pawson\n&gt;XSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\n&gt;http://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n\n"}}
