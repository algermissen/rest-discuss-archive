They&#39;re just not used\n&gt; much on classic Web sites, and then only when the Web site is being\n&gt; treated more like a filesystem (and the Web ain&#39;t a filesystem, I say).\n\nI have to agree with you. Actually I like the idea of PUT, DELETE, etc. if\nimplementing it is easy as GET. Maybe if all browsers have a &quot;Delete this\npage from the Web&quot; (or similar) button, that&#39;ll be the day when REST\nrises.\n\n&gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned, the distinction between GET and POST is both\n&gt; necessary and sufficient for the self-description of request &quot;semantics&quot;.\n&gt; In any transactional system it&#39;s useful to distinguish between read-only\n&gt; &quot;queries&quot; and read-write &quot;updates&quot;. A read-only operation is known to be\n&gt; safely repeatable as well as cacheable, while a read-write operation is\n&gt; expected not to be. PUT and DELETE are superfluous; I&#39;d rather use POST.\n\nAgain, I agree. Though I don&#39;t think PUT and DELETE are superflouous, in\nmy eyes they are just not practical in the sense that it&#39;s not easy to\nimplement both in server and client when compared to GET and POST.\n\nThe GET as read and POST as read/write seems good enough to me. I agree\nthat GET shouldn&#39;t modify anything to a certain degree (modifying last\naccessed, counter, or any other statistics are okay to me), but GET\nshouldn&#39;t be used to delete or update a &quot;meaningful&quot; resource. POST should\nbe used for all those non-light update operations, whatever it is: add,\nupdate, delete, etc.\n\nIn some cases though, it&#39;s impossible to GET something large, i.e. if\nwe&#39;ve to have a long URI some systems or browsers cannot handle this\nproperly. In this case we&#39;ll need to use POST for read-only semantics.\nIt&#39;s okay by me since there&#39;s no other way.\n\n&gt; For those who are uncomfortable with the &quot;do something&quot; meaning of POST,\n&gt; remember, as always, that HYPERTEXT is our friend. On the Web, you never\n&gt; just put together a POST request out of the blue. You browse to a page\n&gt; containing a form surrounded by text that tells you what posting the form\n&gt; is going to accomplish. The request itself needs no more information than\n&gt; the POST method and the URI to which it applies to identify its &quot;meaning&quot;;\n&gt; the users&#39; expectations are set by whatever the page containing the form\n&gt; tells them.\n\nYup... I agree with you. The &quot;semantics&quot; in my view are actually not\ndefined by GET/PUT/whatever, but what you do with it. GET google.com and\nGET cvs.sourceforge.net actually has the EXACT SAME semantics in the eyes\nof HTTP, yet for the user it&#39;s different: One wants to search and the\nother wants to check out a source code, for example. A more typical\nexample would be POST /update.php?id=3 and POST /delete.php?id=3... these\nare used ALL OVER the Internet. If you want to brag about REST&#39;s success\ncompared to other RPC solutions, try comparing how successful REST is to\nthe POST semantics I&#39;ve just described.\n\nIf Amazon&#39;s web services were actually using TRUE RESTful architecture, I\nwould say that many people will have trouble using it, merely because they\nhave difficulties in &quot;DELETE-ing&quot; or &quot;PUT-ing&quot; things (unless they use a\ndecent library such as CURL, which also has its own problems)... There\nwould have been a whole bunch of &quot;newbies&quot; in Amazon.dev forums asking for\n&quot;How to _post_ a DELETE request?&quot; Note the underlined word.\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
