Mail to david@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is handled by the MX record for ascher.com not by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any host named ascher.com.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, THAT&#39;S always been a good idea, hasn&#39;t it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually I think it has.  SMTP provides a nice way\n&gt; &gt; of failing over when a machine goes down (or is\n&gt; &gt; too busy).  Do you think the variety of ugly HTTP\n&gt; &gt; load balancing schemes are better?\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrelevant.  The issue here is that SMTP routing behavior is defined and\n&gt; configured by an out-of-band mechanism, DNS --- that&#39;s bad enough by\n&gt; itself, and made worse still by some of the unpleasant specifics of DNS\n&gt; and its use.  DNS is (still) relatively rigid, non-dynamic,\n&gt; unidirectional, slow-changing, and brittle.  (Indeed, you can think of\n&gt; DHCP as a response in part to DNS&#39;s unidirectional and slow-changing /\n&gt; difficult-to-change characteristics.)  SMTP&#39;s correct behavior\n&gt; unfortunately depends on correct DNS configuration, availability, etc;\n&gt; DNS is a thorn in the side of SMTP, and at the same time SMTP support\n&gt; has long been a conceptual and architectural tumor growing on / in DNS.\n&gt; SMTP inherits a lot of its bletcherousness from its intimate and\n&gt; unseemly relationship with DNS, and IMO that alone is a good enough\n&gt; reason to begin thinking about its replacement.  The dependency is a Bad\n&gt; Thing (tm) any way you look at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; This was all fine in a world of tens to hundreds of hosts and tens to\n&gt; hundreds of thousands of users, with smart, technical guys running the\n&gt; show administratively, where &quot;churn&quot; was minimal because most of the\n&gt; folks involved were academics who didn&#39;t &quot;move around a lot.&quot;  The\n&gt; assumptions are no longer valid --- we live in a world with tens of\n&gt; millions of hosts, hundreds of millions of users, increasing\n&gt; ephemerality of connection, high rates of user&lt;-&gt;host and topological\n&gt; churn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clay Shirky and many others have noted that DNS is collapsing under its\n&gt; own weight and architectural limitations.  Alex, I agree with you that\n&gt; the Web needs its own naming and routing mechanisms --- but we\n&gt; *certainly* shouldn&#39;t base our solutions on the very same fallacious\n&gt; assumptions that created the problems in the first place!\n&gt; \n&gt; jb\n&gt; \n&gt; PS - I have in the past floated the idea (the &quot;metaweb&quot;) of using\n&gt; verifiable naming and HTTP&#39;s own 3xx response as a routing primitive in\n&gt; combination to make the Web self-naming and self-routing, independent of\n&gt; DNS and free from many of its current, unpleasant and unnecessary\n&gt; administrative constraints.  This is probably do-able with minimal\n&gt; impact on the existing Web architecture.  There&#39;s a large amount of\n&gt; current work going on along these lines relative to distributed\n&gt; filesystems, filesharing, p2p and decentralized systems.  It would be\n&gt; nice to see a principled design for such functionality available for\n&gt; general use within the Web community.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
