What dependencies?  There is no &quot;invisible dependency&quot;\n&gt; between a negotiated resource and any resources that also happen to be\n&gt; variants.

It probably should, that&#39;s a pretty\nuseful behavior to be able to rely on.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reduced visibility directly impacts on your ability to leverage the\n&gt; &gt; layered constraint which, amongst other things, weakens your ability\n&gt; &gt; to compensate for the inefficiencies that emerge from the REST style.\n&gt; &gt; That is a problem. Particularly at scale.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; By leveraging the layered system constraint, do you mean caching?  The\n&gt; caching on my Atom files served from non-negotiated URIs is more\n&gt; efficient than that of the exact same files served as variants of a\n&gt; negotiated URI. In fact, if I don&#39;t assign the variants their own URIs\n\nand send that along in Content-Location, caching breaks down entirely\n&gt; on the negotiated resources.\n&gt;\n\n\nThat doesn&#39;t make sense - isn&#39;t this what the Vary mechanism is for?\n\n\n\n&gt; You can&#39;t seriously be claiming that assigning URIs to variants of a\n&gt; negotiated resource somehow has a negative impact on visibility?\n&gt;\n\nSeriously.\n\n\n&gt; Reality itself proves otherwise, since caching the variants of a\n&gt; negotiated resource only works (except for compression) when you assign\n&gt; URIs to those variants.  Only the visibility provided by the Content-\n&gt; Location URI allows for scaling to occur on systems which implement\n&gt; conneg.\n&gt;\n\n\nReally?\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.44\n\n&quot;The Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that fully\ndetermines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use\nthe response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation&quot;\n\n&quot;An HTTP/1.1 server SHOULD include a Vary header field with any cacheable\nresponse that is subject to server-driven negotiation. Doing so allows a\ncache to properly interpret future requests on that resource and informs the\nuser agent about the presence of negotiation on that resource. A server MAY\ninclude a Vary header field with a non-cacheable response that is subject to\nserver-driven negotiation, since this might provide the user agent with\nuseful information about the dimensions over which the response varies at\nthe time of the response.&quot;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As with cookies, what you propose also violates the self-descriptive\n&gt; messaging constraint.  This is simple enough to check -- does the\n&gt; response representation vary depending on the context of the request?\n&gt;\n&gt; If @type worked the way you wanted it to, dereferencing a resource\n&gt; would return a media type based on the native Accept header if the URI\n&gt; is typed or pasted in, or a link is followed from a page that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; set @type.  Yet if the same URI is dereferenced from some other page\n&gt; that does set @type, the response representation has just changed based\n&gt; on the prior application state, i.e. shared context.\n&gt;\n\nYes, this is exactly the behavior I am advocating. This problem would be\navoided if, say, the browser address bar was amended by the Content-Location\nheader of the negotiated response.\n\nBesides, I thought URIs were opaque and hypertext was the engine of\napplication state?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a major problem, which totally violates the layered-system and\n&gt; identification of resources constraints also, which may be easily and\n&gt; simply avoided by the best-practice solution of assigning URIs to\n&gt; variants.  Problem _solved_.  Period.\n&gt;\n\nIt doesn&#39;t violate any constraints, the only problem it does pose is\npotential UX issues - which can be solved.\n\nYour post is too long and this conversation is getting tiresome, I think I&#39;m\npretty much spent here unless we can condense this stuff a bit more.\n\nI do have one final question though; Assuming what you&#39;re saying is right,\nwhat is the benefit in drawing any high level distinction between\nrepresentations and resources if all we are actually talking about is\nresources and link relations?
