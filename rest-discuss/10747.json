Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There seems to be a common thread with most posts here.  People\n&gt; have been busy modeling everything as a resource and now they\n&gt; want to know how to do everything in a PUT or DELETE instead of\n&gt; any of the other HTTP methods.  That is wrong.  That is thinking\n&gt; HTTP is just a &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is not limited to GET, PUT, and DELETE.  Anyone who says so\n&gt; is just making things up as they go along.  REST is limited to the\n&gt; client being told what to do next by the current state of where\n&gt; they are now, aside from the entry point(s) we call a bookmark.\n&gt; That is feasible because the set of methods is uniform, not because\n&gt; it is limited to CRUD.  POST is an equal party in the REST interface,\n&gt; particularly when actions are being applied to the resources that\n&gt; are a composite of multiple source resources.  So is PATCH.\n\nAnyone remembers Royce and the Waterfall Model?  In a 1970 he criticed\nthe waterfall approach and argued for iterative development.  Most\npeople&#39;s take from that piece was to just go and do more waterfall.\nAfter all, if someone wrote about it, and it was published in the\nProceedings of IEEE, then it must be good, right?\n\nWhen I talk to people about REST, almost always the conversation\nrevolves around one of two interpretations of REST.  That &quot;REST is not\nSOAP&quot;: the catchy sound byte is the battle between REST and SOAP, and\nif you&#39;re not doing SOAP then you must be doing REST.  Or that &quot;REST\nis CRUD&quot;: developers intuitively grasp how to do SQL or EJB or insert\nyour favorite data access layer, over HTTP; data storage on the cloud\nis the Next Great Thing, coupled with all the easy-CRUD frameworks\nplaying catch up to Rails.\n\nThe EJB over HTTP interpretation works because you can explain it in a\nTwitter message, grok it in seconds, try it out on a handful of Web\n2.0 services, and prototype something with your new shiny framework of\nchoice.  I don&#39;t see that changing by bringing up hypermedia as the\nsomething of something else.  If you can&#39;t explain it in one short\nsentence, don&#39;t be surprised when some other short explanation catches\non.\n\nI tried &quot;REST is links and forms&quot;, and that one works quite nicely,\nbecause it starts we something that people grasp, and everything else\nlike GET vs POST, caching, naming resources, moving beyond HTTP, all\nfall nicely into place.  If someone asks how do to this or that, you\nstart with &quot;why don&#39;t you show me your links and forms?&quot;\n\n\n-- Assaf\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n\n\n&gt; Doing RESTful actions on multiple resources is no different from\n&gt; selecting multiple tunes in iTunes and using the info dialog\n&gt; to set certain properties across all selected tunes.  It is a UI issue.\n&gt; The UI builds a set of actions to perform and then performs them\n&gt; in whatever way is most efficiently provided by the set of resources\n&gt; being operated upon.  If those resources (or, rather, the index to\n&gt; those resources) say they can be operated upon as a group by POST\n&gt; of a selection form, then so be it -- that is perfectly RESTful\n&gt; even without the benefit of per-resource cache invalidation.\n&gt; Likewise for PATCH or PUT to a meta-resource, or PROPPATCH to a\n&gt; WebDAV resource, it is RESTful if there is some engine described\n&gt; by a representation provided by the origin server that instructs\n&gt; the client on what to do next.\n&gt;\n&gt; The goals are to remove coupling and maximize the number of\n&gt; reusable resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n\n"}}
