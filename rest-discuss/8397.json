One of the things that typical RPC\nmechanisms lack is the ability to describe responses (or even\nparameters) as a stream of data as opposed to a small data type.\nHTTP has no problem doing that even when it is used in an RPC way.\n\nSo, people who advocate &quot;resource-oriented&quot; as an end in itself,\nas if the only thing you need to build a network-based application\nis a URI template and resource definition language, are just fooling\nthemselves into thinking what they are doing is REST.  Resources\nare just one part of the style.  Resources are necessary for REST,\nbut resources must be allowed to evolve independently from the\nclients and the only way that can happen is when the clients are\nexpecting to be instructed by the next representation received.\nOtherwise, the client is making assumptions about the server&#39;s\nimplementation --- assumptions that will break eventually --- and\nbecomes much more complex and brittle than the type of network-based\napplication that REST is intended to encourage.\n\nThat is why hypermedia as the engine of application state is\nan essential constraint of REST, and why RESTful application\nframeworks cannot ignore the need for meaningful media types,\nwhether it be in the form of microformats or specialized XML\ndata types.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
