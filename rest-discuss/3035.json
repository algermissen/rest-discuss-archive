The hype \naround Web Services can get kind of nauseating and it doesn&#39;t comfort me \nthat taxpayer money is used to fund development based on the standards \nrelatively uncritically.\n\nBut it turned out that the talk was actually about a REST based system:\n\n&quot;Following the REST style, Procurement Desktop Defence entities such as \npurchase requests, awards and line items are, like Web pages, given \nURL�s. API clients will use HTTP methods to create, select, update and \ndelete these entities, which are represented using an XML vocabulary \nbased on the existing client/server PD� vocabulary, extended to \nincorporate PD  e   information and constructs described by this \narchitecture and XML standards�XML Namespaces, XML Base, XLink, XPointer \nand XInclude. To interact with the Public API requires only a platform \ncapable of TCP/IP communication (to send HTTP messages) and string \nprocessing (to process XML).&quot;\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
