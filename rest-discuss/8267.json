If you did that you would have a usable, RESTfull service.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is debate here about what that XML should be. But any XML is\n&gt; acceptable. The BEST XML is a matter of some debate.\n&gt; \n\nXML has nothing to do with REST and vice versa. REST merely describes \nhow you exchange documents (excuse me, representations). It says nothing \nabout the format of these documents.\n\nThere are many useful REST services that do not use XML, and many useful \nXML services that do not use REST.\n\nThat said, it is often a good idea to use XML to exchange \nrepresentations, but don&#39;t get fooled into thinking you have to.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
