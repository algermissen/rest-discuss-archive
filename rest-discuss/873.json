The whole process can be\n&gt; &gt; fully automated by providing a generative grammar for names and some\n&gt; &gt; semantic description for said names.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why invent something extra when markup works?!?!\n\nYou&#39;re not.  You&#39;re defining grammatical conventions on already-existing names in\nthe same manner that you specify other sorts of things in markup.  It&#39;s not an\neither-or, it&#39;s a both-and.  There are things that the name-based mechanism\nallows which can&#39;t be done via markup topology...  consider a Web crawler that\nsimply wants to crawl across every available page on my site --- *including the\none which isn&#39;t linked to by any other page.*  Name-based conventions *may* allow\nyou to find that object.  With markup topology, you&#39;ll never find it.\n\nHey, that&#39;s a subtle but good point, IMHO. ;-)  There&#39;s something deep lurking\nthere.\n\n&gt; Hierarchical names are necessarily hosted from\n&gt; the same machine (or at least there must be a redirect on the same\n&gt; machine). That&#39;s why the web is different than a file system. (I added\n&gt; this point to the Wiki also)\n\nThis is baloney, too --- but again a commonly offered argument.  There&#39;s\nabsolutely nothing that says that distributed filesystems cannot be multi-rooted\nand have global names.  Indeed, in a stunning demonstration of the ToII, the SMB\n/ CIFS filesystem&#39;s names (UNC names) and URIs look so much alike that *a trivial\nencoding of UNC names as URI is possible just by replacing &#39;&#92;&#39; with &#39;/&#39;.\n\n&gt; I think you&#39;re reverting to something you&#39;re comfortable with.\n\nPossibly.  Or perhaps its the lack of familiarity on the part of others of\ncurrent filesystem research and their relatively greater comfort level with\nmarkup technologies that causes them to (a) see nonexistent limitations and\nproblems with semantically-rich naming schemes and (b) seek to compensate for\nthis with markup technologies.  Which is it?  I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s what I&#39;m\ntrying to find out.  I&#39;ve floated back and forth between these two communities\nfor a long time, and I prima facie the Opacity Principle seems just as silly to\nme as the filesystem guys&#39; perpetual insistence on block-level IO and caching.\n\nMy investigation of these issues is driven by familiarity with the work of\nMichael McClennen, Stu Sechrest, Hans Reiser, Bal Krishnamurthy, the Plan 9 guys,\nand others who have at various times in the past decade worked on enriching the\nsemantics of file naming.  If you&#39;re arguing that the whole endeavor is\nworthless, you&#39;re indirectly arguing with some very smart guys.  Indeed, you&#39;re\ntelling Rob Pike, Dave Presotta, Ken Trickey, and some other very smart guys that\nthey&#39;ve wasted most of their careers.  If, on the other hand, you criticize the\nOpacity Principle, you&#39;re just telling Tim that he might have overstated a\nparticular point and telling the rest of us to lighten up and think about how we\ninterpret those axioms.\n\n\nAgain my question:  why the polar opinion about semantics in names?\n\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
