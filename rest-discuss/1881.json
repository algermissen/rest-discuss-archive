However, it&#39;s dogmatic that w=\r\ne pretend\nthis is not the case.  We&#39;ve had many rather ugly battles over th=\r\nis fact on\nthis list, i.e. over the dogmatic &quot;fundamentalist&quot; interpretatio=\r\nn of the\nAxiom of Opacity.  My suggestion to you would be:  it&#39;s not worth =\r\narguing\nabout.  Save yourself some grief, just do what you need to do.\n\nI w=\r\nill make one point about the Axiom of Opacity, one I&#39;ve made before but\nwhi=\r\nch bears repeating:  it&#39;s literally and obviously incorrect vis-=E0-vis\nexi=\r\nsting Web architecture.  The axiom says that all you can do with a URI is\nd=\r\neference it.  In fact, it is *essential* to the Web architecture that URI\ns=\r\nupport at least two other kinds of semantics, namely:\n\n* It must be possibl=\r\ne to compare URI for equivalence (proxies, etc.)\n  \n* It must be possible t=\r\no construct a URI from another complete URI and\n    a relative URI.\n\nThe la=\r\ntter gives particular credence to your argument;  it specifically\ncomprehen=\r\nds and exploits the hierarchical nature of the path part of the\nURI.  These=\r\n two observations together undermine my ability to take the Axiom\nseriously=\r\n, and I believe that anyone approaching the issue with an open mind\nwill in=\r\nterpret the situation similarly.\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
