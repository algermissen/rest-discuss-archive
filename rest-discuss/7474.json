For example:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&p=4&o=a\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&o=a&t=java\n&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&t=java&p=4\n&gt;&gt; All get redirected to:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not a fan of redirection for redirection&#39;s sake. If it makes for a\n&gt; much simpler server implementation so be it, but in general I think it\n&gt; is poor manners to ask a client to rephrase a request the server\n&gt; understands perfectly well.\n&gt;\nWell, in my case it makes the server a bit more complicated, not  \nsimpler. By default using Java servlets my server would process all  \nthose URIs the same. I had to add code to canonicalize those URIs  \ninto one URI via redirection. I realized I do one other thing that I  \ndidn&#39;t mention. If a URI comes in with a query param at its default  \nvalue, I redirect to the same URI minus that query param.\n\nI didn&#39;t do this for redirection&#39;s sake, but for the purpose of  \nhelping search engines figure out that two different URIs really  \nrefer to the same thing. If the search engine can&#39;t figure out that  \ntwo different URIs refer to the same thing, and half of the inbound  \nlinks use each URI, then Google-like PageRank algos won&#39;t put that  \npage as high in search results as it would have with a canonical URI.  \nSo I invested in some code to canonicalize URIs that my  \ninfrastructure didn&#39;t already canonicalize, in the hopes of a pay  \nback in increased traffic from search engines.\n\n&gt; In all of these cases I would be strongly inclined to process the\n&gt; request normally and repond with the relevant content. I would try to\n&gt; include a link in the content and/or headers to the bookmark or\n&gt; &quot;permalink&quot; url for future reference, but I don&#39;t want to clog up the\n&gt; network with repetitions of the same request through the redirection\n&gt; mechanism. I see redirection primarily as a mechanism to defer to a\n&gt; server entity that understands the request properly or to deal with a\n&gt; deprecated url.\n&gt;\nSince all non-canonical URIs are redirected, it should be highly rare  \nthat someone would ever link to one of them. So oddly enough by doing  \nthe redirects, I will actually be preventing people from linking to a  \nnon-canonical URI, in which case the server would never need to do  \nany redirects.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n&gt; Roy, you wrote:\n&gt;&gt; No. Why would I have said &quot;For two resources to be the same, ...&quot; if\n&gt;&gt; I thought that changing a URI always resulted in different resources?\n&gt;&gt; They might be different resources, the client generally won&#39;t be able\n&gt;&gt; to figure that out, so the only safe assumption is that they are\n&gt;&gt; different resources until stated otherwise by the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; I worry about the notion of a resource being too airy-fairy. I take a\n&gt; fairly simple approach in my conversation. If the urls are  \n&gt; different we\n&gt; are talking about two different resources. It might happen that they\n&gt; demarcate the same application state, but client&#39;s can&#39;t know that. I\n&gt; would suggest that even server&#39;s don&#39;t really know that. A mapping  \n&gt; from\n&gt; URL to representation might be here today but gone after the  \n&gt; restructure\n&gt; tomorrow. One of the aliases might become a redirection next week.\n&gt; Severs cannot say with certainty over the long-haul that multiple urls\n&gt; map to the same application state. In that context I am very wary of\n&gt; language that talks about two resources being the &quot;same&quot;, even if the\n&gt; might happen to be equivalent for the forseeable future.\n&gt;\n&gt; I talk about different urls always referring to different  \n&gt; resources. At\n&gt; any particular point in time the url demarcates a specific subset of\n&gt; application state, though the server is free to change the mapping  \n&gt; from\n&gt; url to application state over time. Interacting with the resource\n&gt; returns, replaces, adds to, destroys, or otherwise operates on the\n&gt; demarcated application state by transferring representations of the\n&gt; state being communicated. Different representations encode the state\n&gt; being communicated into different document types with different\n&gt; tradeoffs with respect to fidelity of semantics, document simplicity,\n&gt; generality of applicability and other design factors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
