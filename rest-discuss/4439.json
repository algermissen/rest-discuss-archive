The representation will\nbe used in at least two ways: 1) as templates of requests that are\nused to delegate an activity selected by some precondition -- the\nactual request might be generated by some XML processing chain based\non that template and visible workflow state; and 2) as journels of\nthe request and the response intended to provide inspectable state\nas a workflow evolves.\n\nE.g.,\n\n&lt;http&gt;\n  &lt;request method=&quot;...&quot; requestURL=&quot;...&quot; version=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;header name=&quot;host&quot;&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;\n     ...\n     &lt;entity xlink:href=&quot;...&quot; xlink:type=&quot;resource|locator&quot;&gt;\n     ...\n     &lt;/entity&gt;\n  &lt;/request&gt;\n  &lt;response statusCode=&quot;...&quot; reasonLine=&quot;...&quot; version=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;header name=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;\n     ...\n     &lt;entity xlink:href=&quot;...&quot; xlink:type=&quot;resource|locator&quot;&gt;\n     ...\n     &lt;/entity&gt;\n  &lt;/response&gt;\n&lt;/http&gt;\n\nThe notion is that the request/response entity is optional (since\nit is not always present) and that it may either be represented\ninline or as a link to a resource whose representation is that\nentity.  In particular, this seems to be a better way to store\na transaction journel or record the evolving state of requests\nand responses on some evolving workflow state.\n\nThis sort of thing is relatively straightforward, but it seems like\nit could be useful in a lot of places, e.g., a transaction log for\na REST repository, so I was wondering if there has been any effort\nto develop such an XML vocabulary and whether or not it might\ngeneralize out of the specific use case for which it was developed.\n\nThanks,\n\n-bryan\n\n\n"}}
