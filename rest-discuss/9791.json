How is the move operation initiated?\n&gt; Do you adopt MOVE from WebDAV? Or do you use another verb – if\n&gt; so, to what URI and with what representation? And how is this\n&gt; communicated in hypermedia?\n\nI think this is one of the big stumbling points for people trying to \njump onto the REST bandwagon.  How to handle non-trivial mutation \noperations.  The GET (read) operations are pretty obvious.  It would be \nreally great to have a *publicly available* set of &#39;patterns&#39; described \nfor transaction models like this.  Instead of the endless debate on the \nblogs and here :-)\n\nOr even just a non-trivial application scenario.  Joe got close with his \npost on &quot;RESTify DayTrader&quot;\n\n\thttp://bitworking.org/news/201/RESTify-DayTrader\n\nbut I actually read different semantics for DayTrader.  And the data \nwasn&#39;t described at all.\n\n-- \nPatrick Mueller\nhttp://muellerware.org\n\n\n"}}
