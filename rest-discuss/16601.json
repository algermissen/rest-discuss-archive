Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n\n&gt; This is derived from Chapter 6.5, which describes the general\n&gt; arch=\r\nitectural lessons learned from applying the REST style to Web\n&gt; architectur=\r\ne. =A0In general, any uniform interface instantiated using\n&gt; HTTP over the =\r\nInternet, RESTful or not, will require the re-use of the\n&gt; IANA registry, o=\r\nr attempt to extend HTTP to include alternatives to the\n&gt; IANA registry, be=\r\ncause self-descriptiveness is endemic to any uniform\n&gt; interface style for =\r\ndistributed hypermedia applications, which, if\n&gt; they&#39;re using HTTP over th=\r\ne Internet, means there&#39;s a registry which\n&gt; defines self-descriptive messa=\r\nging.\n\nThis is the key right here &quot;or attempt to extend HTTP to include\nalt=\r\nernatives to the IANA registry&quot;.\n\nNobody is denying registration, it&#39;s a ma=\r\ntter of the authoritative\nregistry being used.\n\nIn HTTP, using registered m=\r\nedia types is a SHOULD, not a MUST, and not\nusing IANA registered media typ=\r\nes is discouraged, not illegal.\n\nRFC 2616 3.7 &quot;Media Types&quot;\n&quot;Media-type val=\r\nues are registered with the Internet Assigned Number\n Authority (IANA [19])=\r\n. The media type registration process is\n outlined in RFC 1590 [17]. Use of=\r\n non-registered media types is\n discouraged.&quot;\n\nI can&#39;t speak to the &quot;interm=\r\nediary&quot; participants you talked about\nearlier. Notably caches and proxies a=\r\nnd other such &quot;transparent&quot;\ninfrastructure bits. I understand how in some a=\r\npplications these\npieces of infrastructure may well transform content for m=\r\nedia types\nthat it is aware of. For example, if it&#39;s delivering to mobile\nd=\r\nevices, there may be some transformation taking place. In that case,\nthe in=\r\nfrastructure is not transparent, rather it&#39;s active.\n\nHowever, from a pract=\r\nical standpoint, its hard to imagine these\ndevices NOT being transparent to=\r\n media types they are not familiar\nwith. Either they can reject them outrig=\r\nht (which seems to be more a\npolicy decision than a technical decision), or=\r\n it can pass them\nthrough untouched. Worst case, perhaps, is that a caching=\r\n proxy may\ndecide to ignore a media type it is unfamiliar with and not cach=\r\ne the\ncontent, even though it has otherwise conforming HTTP headers giving\n=\r\nproper caching instructions. I really can&#39;t speak to this as I have\nnot wor=\r\nked directly with caching proxies. But, again, that would seem\nmore a local=\r\n implementations policy requirement than a technical\nlimitation of the agen=\r\nt.\n\nBut it&#39;s hard to see the Web as we know it today working or evolving\nif=\r\n there was a wide spread limit on the data types allowed to be sent\nthrough=\r\n the network, and middle ware infrastructure was actively\ndenying this medi=\r\na to pass through unhindered. If this were actively\nhappening, on a wide sc=\r\nale, it&#39;s hard to imagine any new media types\nbeing created, even new types=\r\n with full registration and\nstandardization. That information would have to=\r\n percolate through all\nof the configurations of all the systems denying the=\r\n up to now unknown\ndata type so they could properly pass it through.\n\nLet&#39;s=\r\n consider a popular example. Flash.\n\nFlash is widely popular. It&#39;s been sai=\r\nd that &quot;You don&#39;t support the\nWeb if you don&#39;t support Flash&quot;.\n\nIts media t=\r\nype is &quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;. There is no entry\nfor this at IANA.=\r\n There is no IETF RFC for Flash (that I could find).\n\nYet, somehow, Google =\r\ncan index this media, my browser can load it, and\nwget can fetch it over HT=\r\nTP.\n\nIf I were interested in reading a Flash file, I can use a popular\ninte=\r\nrnet search engine that will inevitably send me to Adobe where I\ncan find a=\r\n specification for the Flash file format.\n\nNow, let&#39;s consider PDF. PDF IS =\r\nregistered with IANA.\n&quot;application/pdf&quot;, and it does have an associated IET=\r\nF RFC. An RFC\nthat is, I might add, remarkably short. It&#39;s short because th=\r\ne RFC is\nnot a specification for PDF, unlike many other RFCs (such as HTTP)=\r\n.\nRather, there&#39;s a footnote with a URL to Adobe&#39;s specification, the\nsame =\r\ncompany hosting the Flash specification it turns out.\n\nIf you go to the URL=\r\n in the RFC, it redirects you to a different page\nthat does not contain the=\r\n PDF specification. Rather it documents the\nchanges Adobe has done to the o=\r\nfficial ISO PDF specification. The ISO\nspecification is not available on th=\r\ne web, it apparently must be\npurchased.\n\nHowever, Adobe has an archive sect=\r\nion linked from this page where you\ncan find the PDF version from Adobe tha=\r\nt the ISO standard is based on.\nYou can also find an older version that the=\r\n RFC is based upon.\n\nSo, through Adobes goodwill, we have a freely availabl=\r\ne specification\nof PDF. Both one that is equivalent to the current ISO stan=\r\ndard, as\nwell as the one referred to by the IETF RFC.\n\nBut, it&#39;s easy to se=\r\ne how Adobe could have chosen to not provide\nthese, leaving the only offici=\r\nal document of the PDF format to the ISO\npublication, which not only must b=\r\ne purchased, but is NOT the document\nspecified by the RFC.\n\nGiven all that,=\r\n Google can index this media, my browser can deliver\nthem, and wget can fet=\r\nch these.\n\nSo, given those considerations, here&#39;s the conundrum.\n\nI have tw=\r\no very simple applications. Here&#39;s one of them.\n\nRequest:\nGET /doc.pdf HTTP=\r\n/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:22:33 GMT\nServer:=\r\n Acme Server 1.0\nLast-Modified: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:22:33 GMT\nContent-Lengt=\r\nh: 1234\nContent-Type: application/pdf\n\nHere&#39;s the other:\n\nRequest:\nGET /gam=\r\ne.flv HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:22:33 G=\r\nMT\nServer: Acme Server 1.0\nLast-Modified: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:22:33 GMT\nCon=\r\ntent-Length: 1234\nContent-Type: application/x-shockwave-flash\n\nThe first ap=\r\nplication is REST.\n\nThe second application is not REST.\n\nThis is what you a=\r\nre saying. This is what it boils down to.\n\nThis is where the impasse occurs=\r\n.\n\nI view these applications as identical. Apparently, you do not.\n\nI feel =\r\nthat the label REST should be able to be applied equally to\nthese two appli=\r\ncations.\n\nAll here agree to the need to specification, and documentation.\n\n=\r\nIf I were to publish endpoints to a REST system, and a supporting\ndocument =\r\ndescribing the endpoints and the media types involved, I feel\nthat as long =\r\nas those specification are openly available, whether from\nIANAs servers, a =\r\npublished RFC, Adobe, or my own web server, then\nthose media types are desc=\r\nriptive enough to meet the spirit and letter\nof what the REST style and arc=\r\nhitecture require. If someone wishes to\nuse my system and the required medi=\r\na types, all of the information is\navailable to them.\n\nIf a user trying to =\r\nuse my system encounters an error using an\nnon-IANA registered mime type be=\r\ncause of some intervening middleware\npolicy, I&#39;d treat that similarly to a =\r\nperson behind a firewall that\nblocks port 25 (another popular, IETF approve=\r\nd port and\nspecification), as a policy issue that would need to be addresse=\r\nd\nlocally. Yes, this can hinder use overall, but, from a practical\nstandpoi=\r\nnt, frankly, I don&#39;t see it as an issue.\n\nSo, that&#39;s my pitch. I completely=\r\n appreciate the motivations and\nspirit from which your discussions come fro=\r\nm. I am simply going to\nhave to disagree with you on the pedantry with whic=\r\nh you apply to this\nspecific point of the REST style.\n\nIf my second applica=\r\ntion example can not be called REST, then so be\nit. But I may call it that =\r\nanyway.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
