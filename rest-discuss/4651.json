Thanks for taking the time to\ndo this.\n\n&quot;Overview - The main ideas behind REST are [...]&quot;\nThe Overview only mentions retrieval of representations.\n\n&quot;REST Characteristics - Clients &quot;pull&quot; resource representations from\nserver.&quot;\nThere is more to state transfer than retrieval. Clients can &#39;push&#39; content\nto any reachable endpoint.\n\n&quot;No server-side state is used to process the request.&quot;\nI know what you mean, but this might be a bit confusing for a newcomer.\n\n&quot;Responses can be labeled as &quot;cacheable&quot; so clients know if it is safe to\ncache responses for performance reasons. &quot;\nExcellent. I always forget to mention this.\n\n&quot;PUT - creates a new resource or modifies an existing resource and typically\nreturns the resource URL&quot;\nI&#39;m not sure the resouce URI is actually returned, since PUT requires the\nURI in the incoming request. POST sometimes returns the ID of a newly\ncreated resource.\n\nThe CRUD discussion is a little unclear. PUT is used to set the state of an\nidentified resource regardless of whether it existed before - sort of like\nan UPSERT in the SQL world. And POST is used for both create and update\noperations, but the distinction isn&#39;t visible in the HTTP. A little more\ndiscussion & comparison/contrast in this area may help some of the audience.\n\n\nI like the idea of providing a set of Java classes for application\ndevelopers - that&#39;s an under-served audience in this area.\nIf you are extremely bored, you might want to look at\nhttp://xml.apache.org/projects/xang/ for an older Java servlet-based\nframework for REST based applications (you have to get past some of the\nblather and look at the code, I really should dust off that code and\nsimplify the docs...). But really, for this stuff, once a developer\nunderstands the ideas, the &#39;framework&#39; is only a very small amount of code.\n\nAlso, for a good Java HTTP client library, take a look at Apache&#39;s Commons\nproject http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/.\n\n&quot;REST is not appropriate for stateful applications&quot;\nYou should also mention that stateful applications are not appropriate for\nthe Web (or scalability, etc.).\n\n&quot;REST isn&#39;t currently preferred over SOAP by major players&quot;\nHmm, I work at a little bookstore in Seattle & we use REST style software\nall the time.\nPerhaps you meant by major vendors?\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;R.
