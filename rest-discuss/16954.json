Will it be solved if I drive the hypertext in JSON schema and just have generic JSON represent generic data?\n\nNo. What you need is a media type that is specific. Otherwise you end up creating coupling between client and service. (This might be perfectly ok in your case, but it is not REST. IWO: choose what suits your needs but understand your choice :-).\n\nIf you have 3 clients in an environment you own then the coupling should not be too bad. If you have millions of clients that you cannot achieve coordination with then eliminate all coupling - to allow for your service to evolve if it needs to.\n\nIt is, BTW, not difficult to specify a JSON schema, write down the semantics of the link relations you include and give that stuff a media type name. The question whether you register that thing with IANA later is not necessary to answer right now. I think that even *thinking* about your payload semantics in a service-independent, more global way improves the overall design.\n\nCreating a media type is not rocket science on not just for the big use cases. It is just the way how you turn service specific coupling into globally shared semantics.\n\nSure it is work, but the benefit is completely decoupled components and no need for maintaining service specific descriptions.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 27, 2010, at 2:59 AM, Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Nov 26, 2010, at 5:41 PM, Zhi-Qiang Lei wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m designing a REST API which support html and JSON.
