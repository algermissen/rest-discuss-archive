(Is there any light visible in the tunnel on that?)  I&#39;ve been \n&gt; looking at work-arounds.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it considered Ok to make a web application that sends GET/POST \n&gt; methods with a custom header, i.e. X-HTTP-METHOD?\n&gt;\n&gt; This seems a workable, reasonable stop-gap method until the ridiculous \n&gt; situation of modern browsers not fully supporting the protocol is \n&gt; finally improved.  &lt;rant barely suppressed&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I invite your comments.  Anyone else using this? Thoughts on it? Will it \n&gt; work in the real world? Any other work-arounds? etc.\n\nLook at REST-AHAH.\n\nI&#39;ve tried your approach... it gets rejected quite often because many\ncorp. proxies don&#39;t seem to pass through X- headers.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://prooveme.com - easy, simple, certificated OpenID\n\n"}}
