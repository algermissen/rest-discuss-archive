01 Apr 2010 14:04:13 -0000\r\n\r\nHi Dario,\nWe use a microformat-like language called hRESTS [1] to structure Web \npages documenting Web APIs (the most common approach adopted right now) \nand on top of this we annotations a la SAWSDL based on what we refer to \nas MicroWSMO [2].\n\nThis approach gives an RPC view over these Web APIs in a way that can be \nautomatically processed by machines to identify that there is a service \nbehind and how it looks like. Arguably this may not be the most \nappropriate approach for truly RESTful services but we are targeting Web \nAPIs and based on our surveys a bit more than 50% of the Web APIs out \nthere are not entirely RESTful anyway. We are also looking into \nproviding other solutions more aligned with RESTful principles and we&#39;ll \nthen try and see to which extent we can map both ways of representing \nservices.\n\nWe currently have an editing tool called SWEET [3] that supports you in \nannotating Web APIs based on the technologies above and a repository for \nhosting these annotations called iServe [4] which is able to extract the \nannotations and generate RDF out of it. The RDF generated is exposed \nfollowing linked data principles to better support its retrieval, \nquerying and use.\n\nHope you find this of interest.\n\n\nCheers,\nCarlos\n\n[1] http://www.vitvar.com/doc/WI2008-KopeckyGV.pdf\n[2] http://cms-wg.sti2.org/TR/d12/v0.1/\n[3] http://sweet.kmi.open.ac.uk/\n[4] http://technologies.kmi.open.ac.uk/iserve/\n\n-- \nDr. Carlos Pedrinaci\nKnowledge Media Institute - The Open University\nWalton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTel: +44 1908 654773\nFax: +44 1908 653169\n\nDário Abdulrehman wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What would be the recommended approach for describing Semantic RESTful\n&gt; Web Services?\n&gt; On the syntactical level there is WADL which does not yet have a wide\n&gt; adoption and there is OWL-S which tries to provide an abstract framework\n&gt; for describing Web Services.\n&gt; What about using WSDL 2.0 for describing RESTful Web Services?\n&gt;\n&gt; Two possible approaches I have seen are:\n&gt; - Using RDFa to semantically annotate XHTML web pages so they are\n&gt; machine readable.\n&gt; - Extending OWL-S to define an ontology that describes the service, in\n&gt; particular the service grounding part.
