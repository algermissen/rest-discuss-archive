Web services fall into two general categories, \nservices that do something to a resource, for which REST is a natural \nfit, and services that perform some action, for which RPC is a natural \nfit (the classic calculator and celsius/farenheit converter fall into \nthe latter).\n\nYou can try to force action-style services into a REST architecture, but \nthat is no better, IMO, then trying to force a resource-style service \ninto a RPC paradigm.\n\nThe fact that you ask:\n\n&gt;But how do I RESTfully pass a list of coordinates? Do I have to wrap\n&gt;them up as a single resource and then pass that? Or a great, long URI\n&gt;including all the coordinate pairs? Or am I on the wrong track altogether?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIs a pretty good indication that your coordinate converter doesn&#39;t want \nto be a resource, it wants to be a coordinate converter, so let it.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\n\nIan\n\n\n\n"}}
