If your URLs describe a suite of actions, with parameters in the\n&gt;&gt; query string, then you&#39;re just building a RPC application.

You could design the most insanely RESTful interface using only verbs for\n&gt; your URIS, or using GUIDs. I think the important piece of advice would be that\n&gt; you should strongly consider why you want to use verbs in the first place, given\n&gt; the HTTP method is already doing that for you.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Noah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n&gt;\n\n"}}
