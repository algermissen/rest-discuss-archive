There are a lot of people learning REST via the Wiki.  We should\n&gt; &gt; take care to tag those more, &lt;ahem/&gt;, &quot;controversial&quot; pages as &quot;Not\n&gt; &gt; generally accepted as RESTful&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a reasonable request.  I have now marked the documents in question in\n&gt; the following manner, at the top of the page:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Note:  THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS REST HERESY.\n\nWhile we&#39;re making editorial changes, its a weak rhetorical trick to\nequate the opacity axiom to the onion analogy. The onion was a bit of\nsuperstitious nonsense with no chemical backing whatsoever. The fact\nthat we&#39;ve been arguing about this for several days indicates that we\nhave a legitimate technical disagreement like the difference between the\nJava and C# floating point models.\n\n&gt; ... I&#39;d like to communicate the problem well\n&gt; enough for people to understand --- but this may indeed be as\n&gt; subtle and thorny a topic to the RESTful as REST itself is to the\n&gt; RPC enthusiast or Web layman.\n\nActually, we&#39;ve had pretty good success explaining the benefits of REST\nto the RPC crowd. There are things you can do with hypertext and\naddressing that are painful to the extent of being impossible to do\nwithout them. RPC people who are willing to think about it long enough\nto argue about it tend to come around. I don&#39;t see it in this case.\nEvery time you present a use-case that doesn&#39;t explicitly deny me the\nright to use hypertext, I can present a hypertext solution to the\nproblem. In fact, I can mechanically translate your generative grammars\ndefinitions into hypertext solutions. It&#39;s just a matter of moving the\nstring replacement from the client to the server and adding a level of\nindirection.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
