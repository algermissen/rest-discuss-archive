The good thing about\n&gt; &gt; doing that is that an intermediary would know that /search has changed\n&gt; &gt; state due to the POST, whereas if it went to /add, the state change\n&gt; &gt; would be transparent and the intermediary wouldn&#39;t know.\n&gt; \n&gt; hmm. Individual searches are separate resources; i.e., they have\n&gt; different query strings, so this wouldn&#39;t necessarily work, no? (It\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t make sense to POST a query, obviously).\n\nWhy not?  Don&#39;t think of the resource as being a search, but think of\nit as the result of a search.\n\n&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=foo&quot; is the set of all resources known\nby Google to contain the word &quot;foo&quot;.  That it requires a search to\nresolve this URI at google.com is immaterial really.\n\nSo there&#39;s no problem with POSTing to /search.  That would be one way\nfor Google to allow people to register new unindexed resources, for\nexample.  But as mentioned below, the name is confusing.\n\n&gt; &gt; Also, search may not be the best name if you&#39;re posting to it. \n&gt; &gt; /What about\n&gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.example.org/database\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or, if the database is a list of employees;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.example.org/employees\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. I knew that that was a problem, just didn&#39;t have a good\n&gt; mechanism; perhaps it would be good to have a DN-&gt;resource mapping,\n&gt; so that\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses\n&gt; \n&gt; maps to &#39;dc=example,dc=org&#39; (if that&#39;s the DN being used for\n&gt; addresses. Then, individual entries could be maped to\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.example.org/addresses/Bob%20Smith\n&gt; \n&gt; or somesuch.\n&gt; \n&gt; This might be a horrible abuse of LDAP, but hey, I&#39;d\n&gt; rather abuse it than the Web ;)\n\nHeh.  But do you understand what I was saying here, after what I just\nwrote above?\n\n&gt; &gt; http://www.example.org/employees?id=234343?pap=true\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (&quot;pap&quot; =&gt; &quot;post-as-put&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure. Perhaps start with pap and then backport. I&#39;m doing this with\n&gt; python&#39;s BaseHTTPServer, so I can do anything fairly easily ;)\n\nAnything except implement a catchall do_* method (I&#39;m writing a\nproxy). 8-)\n\n&gt; &gt; You can use them with URI refs;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. What I&#39;m getting at is that the WIKI-like mechanisms such as \n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.example.com/theThing\n&gt;   http://www.example.com/theThing?pap=true\n&gt; \n&gt; are a complete kludge; from a resource standpoint, these might as\n&gt; well be\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://www.example.com/theThing\n&gt;   http:/www.example.com/someOtherThing\n&gt; \n&gt; because of opacity; the only person who knows that ?pap=true does\n&gt; something special is the publisher.\n\nExactly right.  An alternative is to tunnel PUT and DELETE through\nPOST with a hidden form field called &quot;method&quot;.  At least the URI\nwouldn&#39;t change.  I guess there&#39;s a number of ways to kludge it.\nThat would make for a good RESTwiki page.\n\n&gt; P.S. it would be interesting to see an analysis of the RESTyness of\n&gt; WIKIs.\n\nThis one has been up on the RESTwiki for a while.  It&#39;s pretty\ngood, I think.\n\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HowWikiComparesToRest\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
