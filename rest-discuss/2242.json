We&#39;ve talked about\n&gt; shopping baskets here before; their state should ideally be maintained\n&gt; at the client, not the server.  But currently there is no means for\n&gt; handling this on the client.\n\nWhy not handle the shopping cart as it&#39;s own resource on the server?  In\nfact, if done correctly, I could even see having an HTTP server that was\ndedicated and optimized to doing nothing but maintaining one or more site&#39;s\n&quot;shopping cart resource&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure how this would work exactly, but I\ncan vaguely see it working.\n\nAs for the client program being capable of maintaining state, I can see\ndoing that sort of thing now (with a bit of client-side programming, mint\nyou).  For instance, If you were at Amazon, each of the items you view is\nrepresented by an identifier (it&#39;s URL).  Suppose you could right-click on\nthe page and select the &quot;add to amazon.com cart&quot;.  This would cause the\ncurrent URL you were at to be stored locally in a &quot;cart&quot; that was specific\nto amazon (though I suppose it could be more generic too).  Now, suppose you\nhave found everything you wanted to buy.  You go up to your brower&#39;s menu\n(or taskbar or whatever) and bring up the amazon.com shopping cart ( which\nbasically contains nothing but URLs).  You then click on the &quot;buy&quot; button.\nThis prompts your browser to submit (via POST) all of the URLs to an\namazon.com location (not sure how that would be know, but let&#39;s assume it\nis) and amazon would now create the check-out resource that contains the\nitems you are buying... then it&#39;s business as usual.\n\nNow, I know that it would be possible to add this functionality to IE6.\nObviously, it would also require the amazon.com&#39;s of the world to provide\ntheir part of the functionality.  But I think it would be possible.\nFurther, it would be possible to merge this concept with the one above\n(dedicated &quot;shopping cart&quot; server), if wanted.  This would potentially allow\nsomeone to access their shopping cart from any browser later on, as well as\nsome other interesting benefits I can think of (such as the ability to share\nshopping carts with friends regardless of where you shop at).\n\n&gt; But you could imagine browsing through a web site, dragging off\n&gt; products you want and dropping them in a local folder, then at some\n&gt; point dragging that folder and dropping it onto the &quot;checkout&quot;\n&gt; symbol within the web page.  No session required.\n\nOh yeah.  That&#39;s what I was saying too.  :)  Shoulda read the whole post\nfirst...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
