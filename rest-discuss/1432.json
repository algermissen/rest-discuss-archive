There is an online e-book called the Wisdom of\nHenry Hazlitt[1].  He is a delightful writer (his most famous book is\nEconomics in One Lesson, which is great!).  In one part of the e-book is\na transcript of a speech that he gave to an audience of economists.  He\ntalks about the free market, and why there is increasingly less openness\nin the market.  He talks about how, when you&#39;re in the minority, it is\nimportant to clearly, logically articulate your position.  Many people\non this list have done so.  You are to be applauded.  I intend on doing\nmy part in the upcoming weeks and months.  \n\nBelow is an excerpt from Henry Hazlitt&#39;s talk. /Roger\n\nThe Wisdom of Henry Hazlitt\n\nWhy are we drifting deeper and deeper into socialism and the dark night\nof totalitarianism? Why have those of us who believe in human liberty\nbeen so ineffective?\n\n   &quot;We Haven&#39;t Been Good Enough&quot;\n\nI am going to give what is no doubt a terribly oversimplified answer to\nthat question. In the first place, we are almost hopelessly outnumbered.\nOur voices are simply drowned out in the general tumult and clamor. But\nthere is another reason. And this is hard to say, above all to an\naudience of this sort, which contains some of the most brilliant writers\nand minds in the fields of economics, of jurisprudence, of politics, not\nonly of this age but of any age. But the hard thing must be said that,\ncollectively, we just haven&#39;t been good enough. We haven&#39;t convinced the\nmajority. Is this because the majority just won&#39;t listen to reason? I am\nenough of an optimist, and I have enough faith in human nature, to\nbelieve that people will listen to reason if they are convinced that it\nis reason. Somewhere, there must be some missing argument, something\nthat we haven&#39;t seen clearly enough, or said clearly enough, or,\nperhaps, just not said often enough.\n\nA minority is in a very awkward position. The individuals in it can&#39;t\nafford to be just as good as the individuals in the majority. If they\nhope to convert the majority they have to be much better; and the\nsmaller the minority, the better they have to be. They have to think\nbetter. They have to know more. They have to write better. They have to\nhave better controversial manners. Above all, they have to\nhave far more courage. And they have to be infinitely patient.\n\n[1] http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/wisdom/\n\n\n"}}
