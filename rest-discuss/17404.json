Consider a\nmicro-blogging application like twitter where there are two users A\nand B. A wants to follow B. I was wondering what is the right way to\ndesign it?\n\n1. POST /B/followers (Send A&#39;s userid in the body)\n2. PUT /B/followers/A\n3. POST /A/friends (Send B&#39;s userid in the body)\n4. PUT /A/friends/B\n5. POST /relationships (Send A and B&#39;s userid in the body)\n\nQ1. Are there any guidelines when something like a relation can be\nelevated to be a separate resource by itself?\nQ2. I also learnt that URI&#39;s should be completely opaque from the\nclient&#39;s perspective. So does this even matter when we have proper\nmedia type and link relations?\n\nThanks,\nViswanath\n\n"}}
