You can do anything you like. But recall that PUT defines the\n&gt; entire state of the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; So are you saying that I can&#39;t update only one field in a resource using PUT\n&gt; but I have to have the &quot;entire&quot; resource passed back on forth?  \n&gt;\n&gt; If so, how then does one define the &quot;entire&quot; resource?  In some enterprise\n&gt; systems, I can envision an entire resource being HUGE and often not easily\n&gt; definable because of all the interrelationships it has.\n\nYou can partition data however you want across a URI space.\n\nRemember the film example?\n\nIf you wanted to add a bit; say where Keira Knightley drinks too much\nrum and... (well, let&#39;s not get carried away) then you could POST to:\n\n   /piratesofthevcarribean/chapter17\n\nOr you could change the whole film, recode it and PUT to:\n\n  /piratesofthecarribean\n\nIt also depends on what you want to do.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
