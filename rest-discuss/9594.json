See\nthe \n&gt; &gt; permathread for more con=\r\ntext.\n&gt; \n&gt; My specific argument was about it being uniform.  The fact that =\r\nthe\ndefinition \n&gt; of REST if defined by other less concrete terms such as G=\r\nenerality and \n&gt; Hypermedia is a separate issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gregg Wonderly\n&gt;\n\nBut=\r\n the meaning of &quot;uniform&quot; in the context of REST is much more\nspecific than=\r\n the dictionary definition of &quot;uniform&quot;. In the context\nof REST and especia=\r\nlly in the context of Roy&#39;s thesis, &quot;uniform\ninterface&quot; is defined precisel=\r\ny by the four constraints that you\nyourself suggested the &quot;discussion might=\r\n be better focused&quot;! Since\nhypermedia is the most important of those four e=\r\nssential constraints\nthat define the very meaning of &quot;uniformity&quot; in the co=\r\nntext of REST,\nhypermedia is hardly &quot;a separate issue&quot;.\n\nHypermedia goes to=\r\n the very heart of the meaning of &quot;uniform\ninterface&quot; in the thesis. In the=\r\n REST usage, an interface CANNOT be\n&quot;uniform&quot; unless it uses hypermedia as =\r\na resource representation.\n\n-- Nick\n\n\n"}}
