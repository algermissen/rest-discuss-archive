See http://www.mnot.net/tarawa for an example.\nI am working on a language for describing the configuration\nof such servers; I will report to this list when I make\nsome progress.\n\nSuch a server could pre-process requests which:\n1. have a verb of POST\n2. have a representation mime-type of\n    application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nThe server can check whether such a request representation\nhas a &#39;method&#39; parameter, as in your example.  If it does,\nit can modify the request as follows:\n1. put in the correct verb instead of POST, in this case\n    DELETE.\n2. delete the method parameter.\n\nThen, it can dispatch to the correct process.\nApache::MagicPOST on CPAN does this for mod_perl.\nhttp://search.cpan.org/~alger/Apache-MagicPOST-1.2/lib/Apache/ \nMagicPOST.pm\n\nSo, the request sent by the client uses POST, but on the\nserver, it &#39;looks&#39; like a DELETE request.  The same\ntechnique can be used for PUT requests, of course.\n\nRemember, this is just a workaround for broken-as-designed\nHTML forms, which subset HTTP, but are also widely\ndeployed.  If you use another representation (e.g. XML)\nor client (which can support DELETE), there is no need\nfor this.\n\nIt is the lesser of two evils to bury the verb in the\nrequest entity body rather than in the request URI.\n\n\n"}}
