He says &quot;each \n&gt;&gt; request from client to server must contain all of the information \n&gt;&gt; necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any \n&gt;&gt; stored context on the server.&quot;  But what does &quot;understanding the \n&gt;&gt; request&quot; mean?  What is &quot;stored context&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve read this to mean anything being stored about a &quot;connection&quot;. \n&gt; Cookies give the appearance of stateful connections over the stateless \n&gt; connections of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think HTTP authentication is completely innocent in this regard \n&gt; either, though it brings less brutality to HTTP than cookies.\n\nDepends what you do with cookies doesn&#39;t it?\n\nYou *can* associate state with authentication details... you *can* do\nauthentication similar to basic auth just with cookies.\n\n\nIs there any argument purely against using cookies? \n\nI think it&#39;s just against having state orthongonal to the resource.\n\n\nWhat I&#39;m saying is that a cookie is no different to a client\ncertificate or an established authentication session. You can\nassociate non-resource state with any of these.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
