Even if you have converted all of your services to Ato=\r\nmPub and they are all individually RESTful, an application that wishes to u=\r\nse a set of them could benefit from being hypermedia driven couldn&#39;t it? E.=\r\ng. a sort of RESTful orchestration system?\n\nLet&#39;s use Ajax as an analogy --=\r\n you have various sets of resources exposed (typically ajax apps just use J=\r\nSON -- not RESTful; but let&#39;s say that AtomPub and a Javascript AtomPub cli=\r\nent are used), and in addition you have the HTML + Javascript that ultimate=\r\nly pull together those resources into a browser application. You can think =\r\nof the HTML as a sort of orchestration layer that uses the various services=\r\n together to some end. The client (your browser) is not only decoupled from=\r\n the underlying resources, but also from the application itself via hyperme=\r\ndia. \n\nIf you aren&#39;t developing a UI but a machine to machine application, =\r\nwhat fills the orchestration role? You could just write code in your langua=\r\nge of choice, in which case you do get some decoupling from the individual =\r\nAtomPub services (assuming you interact with them using a generic AtomPub c=\r\nlient) but in a way you are coupled to this particular combination of servi=\r\nces. See what I mean? Ideally some sort of hypermedia could play a similar =\r\nrole that HTML+JS plays in the the Ajax scenario. Then the client is truly =\r\ndecoupled from the set of services in addition to each individual service.\n=\r\n\nDon&#39;t have a solution here -- I&#39;m just trying to restate the problem.\n\nAnd=\r\nrew\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.j=\r\nohannesen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Aug 13, 2009 at 03:20, Solomon Duskis&lt;sdu=\r\nskis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re right the REST, as discussed by Roy Fielding, s=\r\nhould be able to work\n&gt; &gt; for data oriented APIs, but I simply haven&#39;t seen=\r\n an implementation that has\n&gt; &gt; dozens of interconnecting sets of functiona=\r\nlity; why is that?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some do. I&#39;ve created fully RESTful SOA infra-struc=\r\ntures in a few\n&gt; organisations, but of course they&#39;re mostly hidden behind =\r\nfirewalls\n&gt; and whatsnot. As to more open infra-structure, it&#39;s around and\n=\r\n&gt; growing, like AWS, Google and AtomPub, and lots of &quot;Web2.0&quot;\n&gt; application=\r\ns these days have a REST API (well, more REST than RPC is\n&gt; growing these d=\r\nays). And note that in a RESTful world, the traditional\n&gt; notion of what an=\r\n API is is also a bit shady.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t just take the REST constraint=\r\ns into account. =A0You have to take the\n&gt; &gt; current sets of supporting tech=\r\nonologies, which may not support the full set\n&gt; &gt; of concepts behind the RE=\r\nST constraints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you here mean the limitation of browsers with GET a=\r\nnd POST? I guess\n&gt; that is sort of true, although I suspect the world wasn&#39;=\r\nt ready for\n&gt; DELETE and PUT at the time. Of course, the upgrade should hav=\r\ne\n&gt; happened by now, but this will all change (and I spsect rather\n&gt; rapidl=\r\ny) as HTML5 / XHTML2 enters the field. I&#39;m excited! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The REST con=\r\nstraints either require or encourage coarse-grained,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-descriptive,=\r\n resource-oriented, hypermedia-driven, loosely-coupled\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interactions.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Agreed in theory, but I haven&#39;t seen that in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do =\r\nyou mean, &quot;in practice&quot;? Is there some part of your daily\n&gt; online life whe=\r\nre you don&#39;t interact with a system that might be doing\n&gt; some proper REST =\r\nmagic? Any Google, Yahoo or Amazon service or system,\n&gt; for example?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; If you want a widely-distributed system tolerant of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intermediaries, =\r\ncan exploit caching, is inherently stateless (allowing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many scaling po=\r\nssibilities) with lazy upgrading, REST fits rather well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s say =\r\nthat I have those needs. =A0I know that the current REST oriented\n&gt; &gt; platf=\r\norms can support some of these features, but I can&#39;t say that there is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nany platform that can implement those features really, really well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok=\r\n, so what are they missing or not doing well? What does &quot;well&quot; mean?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0However, I keep on talking to\n&gt; &gt; experts that express that there&#39;s some=\r\n disconnect between REST principles\n&gt; &gt; and practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who are you talk=\r\ning to? :) I think most of us would think that a lot\n&gt; of claims of being R=\r\nESTful isn&#39;t actually RESTful, but there&#39;s plenty\n&gt; of stuff out there (and=\r\n growing every day as people understand the\n&gt; principles more) that is.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A suggestion would be to search the net for systems with AtomPub\n&gt; suppor=\r\nt, and Voila! you got lots of examples of well-done REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=A0So my qu=\r\nestion is how do we get from the ideals you describe\n&gt; &gt; (and I agree are t=\r\nhe goals of REST) into a road map that a business can\n&gt; &gt; implement?\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\ntart by implementing AtomPub, and the rest will follow. It has a\n&gt; basic mo=\r\ndel which works for a lot of things (no, it&#39;s not just about\n&gt; blogging) an=\r\nd is extendable. Google use it, others use it, and it&#39;s\n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of =\r\ncourse, if you want to, you can abuse any &quot;right&quot; technology to\n&gt; make it g=\r\no &quot;wrong&quot;, so there are no guarantees anywhere. But that&#39;s\n&gt; just life and =\r\norganic growth. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex\n&gt; -- \n&gt;  Project Wrangler, SO=\r\nA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n&gt; --- http://shelter.=\r\nnu/blog/ ----------------------------------------------\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n- http://www.google.com/profiles/alexander.johannesen ---\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
