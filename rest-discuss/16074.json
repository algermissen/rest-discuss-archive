REST as an architectural style is simply not\n&gt; expressed in terms remotely close to those that describe the service\n&gt; ecosystem viewpoint and IT ownership viewpoint that OASIS used to\n&gt; express a SOA reference architecture. \n&gt; \n\nYou may have a point there.  REST has no &quot;reference architecture&quot;, it&#39;s\na style, whose reference instantiation is the Web, but is not limited\nto the Web.  The Web is an enabler of a variety of system architectures.\nEach system is an instantiation of some architectural style, most of\nwhich are undefined.\n\nIEEE 1471 is a means for describing such architectures.  The RA for SOA\nis a good example.  But I don&#39;t think it applies to defining anything\nbut instantiations of the Web or of REST (or of some other style).  SOA\nis an instantiation of the Web, but not of REST.\n\nMy demo website is in no way meant as a reference architecture for REST.\nWhen all is said and done, I may very well use IEEE 1471 to describe it\nas a reference architecture for CMS/wiki/weblog/forum operations and\nintegration, as a RESTful alternative to CMIS.\n\nSuch a reference architecture would describe an instantiation of both\nREST and Web styles.  But it would only be one possible REST or Web\ninstantiation of CMS/wiki/weblog/forum operations and integration, not\nthe be-all and end-all.\n\nThat&#39;s all IEEE 1471 can do -- describe reference architectures which\nmay be instantiations of REST, Web or other styles.  I don&#39;t believe it\ncapable of describing architectural styles, i.e. as a replacement for\nthe WebArch document Jan linked to, or Roy&#39;s thesis.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
