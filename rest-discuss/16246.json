Not giving it a name does not\nchange that fact.  Once the s=\r\nerver adds gd annotations, and clients\nstarted depending on them, the repre=\r\nsentations become application\nspecific.\n\nI am not oppose to domain specific=\r\n representations so this does not\nreally bother me.  My concern is that a c=\r\nlient that needs html+gd, but\nasks for html is a lot less likely to get wha=\r\nt it needs than a client\nthat explicitly requests what it needs.\n\n&gt;  =A0RES=\r\nT has nothing to do\n&gt; with negotiating between versions of an API.\n\nSure it=\r\n does.  The accept header allows the negotiation of API\nversions.  Consider=\r\n `accept: text/html` vs `accept:\napplication/atom+xml`.  One says the clien=\r\nt wants to interact with the\nhtml version of the api, the other says the cl=\r\nient wants to interact\nwith the atom version of the api.\n\n&gt; Referring once =\r\nagain to REST:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degr=\r\nades\n&gt; efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\n=\r\n&gt; rather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t ge=\r\nt what you seem to get that from this quote.  Later in the\nsame section we =\r\nget this paragraph.\n\n   In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple ar=\r\nchitectural\n   constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. =\r\nREST is\n   defined by four interface constraints: identification of resourc=\r\nes;\n   manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive\n=\r\n   messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.\n\nNo where =\r\ndoes that suggest there is some limit to the allowable number\nof representa=\r\ntion flavors.\n\nYour reading of the uniform interface seems different than m=\r\nuch of the\ncommunity.\n\nRestWiki is pretty quiet on the idea of limiting med=\r\nia types being\npart of the uniform interface in both the interface generici=\r\nty&#39;s[1]\nand rest in plain english[2] pages.  Both seem to imply that domain=\r\n\nspecific media types would be ok.\n\nStefan Tilkov clearly states that multi=\r\nple media types are acceptable\nin &#39;A Brief Introduction to REST&#39;[3].\n\n   Th=\r\ne result might be some company-specific XML format that\n   represents custo=\r\nmer information.  ...  Summary: Provide multiple\n   representations of reso=\r\nurces for different needs.\n\nI could keep going but that is enough.  My poin=\r\nt is not that any of\nthese are authoritative sources.  (I don&#39;t believe in =\r\nsuch nonsense.)\nBut rather that it seems that much of REST community does n=\r\not hold\nyour belief that html is a fundamental, in inalienable, part of the=\r\n\nuniform interface of the web.\n\nPerhaps i am mis-reading the community or p=\r\nerhaps i am totally wrong\nand html is key.  I am willing to be convinced.  =\r\nHowever, the best\noutcomes i have experienced in m2m systems using rest hav=\r\ne come from\nusing explicitly named domain specific media types.\n\nThere is c=\r\nertainly a trade off between using existing media types and\ncreating new on=\r\nes.  If an existing media type has the needed semantics\nit should definitel=\r\ny be used.  However, if no media type exists with\nthe required semantics cr=\r\neating a new one that does seems superior to\ntrying to infer such semantics=\r\n from an existing one based on out-of-band\ninformation.\n\nPeter\n&lt;http://bare=\r\nlyenough.org&gt;\n\n[1]: http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?InterfaceGener=\r\nicity\n[2]: http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestInPlainEnglish#nid6=\r\n8J\n[3]: http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction\n\n"}}
