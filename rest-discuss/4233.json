Database transactions, the source of the ACID acronym, which span \nmultiple tables in the same database.\n2. Distributed transactions, which can span multiple databases or \nmessage queues from different vendors.\n3. &quot;Business transactions&quot; or application coordination transactions, \nwhich span multiple systems using different technologies.\n\nBusiness transactions (e.g. OASIS-BTP, WS-BusinessAgreement, \nRosettaNet, ebXML BPSS, etc.) only aim at consistency.  They do not \npromise isolation, and sometimes not even atomicity.  Durability is \nthe responsibility of the participant.\n\nBusiness transaction specs assume a message-passing model, e.g. EDI, \nebXML-MS, message-oriented Web services.\n\nI think the concepts can be made RESTful (a fourth generation?), but \ndon&#39;t have a complete solution yet.  (Thus my interest in this \nconversation.)\n\nBut I think it&#39;s good to separate the transaction pattern from the \nACID quality guarantees.  You can only depend on what you can observe.\n\n\n"}}
