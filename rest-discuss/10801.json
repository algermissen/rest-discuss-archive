The HTTP RFC says that DELETE is to delete the resource at\nthe URI said. Popping is deleting the topmost uri. Allowing Deletes\ndirectly on elements would be wrong as that would allow you to delete\nany element( unless you hack through a solution in which every\nresource checks whether it is the topmost resource before getting\ndeleted).\n\nDelete the TOP just does that .. delete the current top. How does it\nmatter if after that another element becomes the top?\n\nAgain, there might be arguments against what I just said , but the\nincrease in coupling caused by any other solution imho makes for an\noverwhelming choice for this option.\n\nIn short, I like the OPs solution.\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n"}}
