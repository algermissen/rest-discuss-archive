The guideline may misguide to one of th=\r\ne options you mention, that I dislike a lot: URL Templates. That makes the =\r\nserver lose control of the URL space, as it it is forced to follow a strict=\r\n construction that also exposes resource information.\n\nI may make a differe=\r\nnce between a resource Identifier and a simple entity identifier. The resou=\r\nrce identifier is always the URL, that may change over time. We create a re=\r\nsource using an entity (pure information) and it is stored somewhere and a =\r\nURI is assigned to it. If you have the entity id like the UUID, the only ho=\r\npe you have is searching the web space for a resource that may be represent=\r\ning it. You can have more than one, actually, and there should be a way in =\r\nthe app to get to it (searching is the normal option here).\n\nSo, the questi=\r\nons is not about the client finding the URL structure, but of the client fi=\r\nnding the search service. Say, we can have a link in the welcome page that =\r\nsays &quot;Find item by ID&quot;. Simple.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Adriano Bonat &lt;adrianob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was readin=\r\ng this guideline [1] about resource identifiers and I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure how a cl=\r\nient would be able to navigate to the resource just having the\n&gt; entry poin=\r\nt URL and the identifier.\n&gt; \n&gt; How does the client find out the URL structu=\r\nre to be used to fetch the\n&gt; resource?
