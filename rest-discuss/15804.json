If\n&gt; I want to create a new customer instance, I could POST a\n&gt; representation of that customer to the collection resource. The\n&gt; server returns a &quot;201 created&quot; and the URI of the new customer\n&gt; instance, maybe &#39;/customers/1234&#39;.\n&gt; \n\nOr, try thinking about REST this way...\n\nAssume you dereference a resource, and the representation returned\ninstructs the user agent that it can POST to some URI.  When the user\nchooses that state transition, the server might respond 201, in which\ncase the created resource&#39;s URI is in the Location: header.  Nothing\nunRESTful there.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now let&#39;s say I need to update this particular customer entity with\n&gt; new information. I could PUT the new description to the instance URI\n&gt; or I could POST it. Since &#39;/customers/1234&#39; is not a collection\n&gt; resource there is no ambiguity about what I want: Update this\n&gt; particular customer instance.\n&gt; \n\nAssume you dereference a resource, and the representation returned\ninstructs the user agent that it can PUT to some URI.  When the user\nchooses that state transition, the server might respond 204, in which\ncase the resource must be dereferenced to determine the results.\nNothing unRESTful there, either.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a problem with that approach? Wikipedia&#39;s helpful article\n&gt; about REST says that a POST in that particular case should mean\n&gt; &quot;Treat the addressed member as a collection in its own right and\n&gt; create a new entry in it.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nNo, the problem lies with the Wikipedia article -- REST says nothing\nabout POST.  If your system is using POST to accomplish PUT in order to\nsupport user agents that don&#39;t grok PUT, REST has no problem with that.\nIf your system is using POST to create a new member of a collection,\nREST says nothing about how to treat the addressed member, and\ncertainly doesn&#39;t require that the POST target be a &quot;collection&quot; since\nREST makes no such distinction.  That Wikipedia article doesn&#39;t have\nmuch of a fanbase here.  ;-)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But - at least in my case - if I would\n&gt; ever have to have a collection within the customer, I would have\n&gt; given it its own URI, such as &#39;/customers/1234/contacts&#39;. Therefore,\n&gt; it&#39;s clear from the context that the customer entity itself is not a\n&gt; collection and never will be.\n&gt; \n\nURIs have no context, they are opaque.  REST only requires that you\nassign URIs to important resources -- *what* URIs you assign has no\nbearing on anything.  The way your system self-documents its API is to\nuse hypertext to instruct user agents what methods to call on what\nresources.  Hypertext then informs the user agent what the result was.\n\nThe answer to your title question, is you can POST to any resource your\nhypertext can instruct a user agent to POST to.  User agents don&#39;t need\nto distinguish between collection and member in a REST system, and are\nin fact clueless that any such relationships exist between resources.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, is there any particular danger in interpreting PUT and POST in\n&gt; the same way in this particular instance? \n&gt; \n\nREST favors selecting one meaning per method, and requires that the\nselected meaning stays constant across all resources.  If you&#39;ve\nassigned replacement semantics to PUT, then it must mean that for all\nresources -- no making it sometimes mean &quot;create&quot; (even though HTTP\nallows both).  If replacement semantics have been assigned to PUT, then\nyou can&#39;t assign that meaning to some other method.\n\nWith the exception of the situation you mentioned -- REST mismatches\nare allowed for specific reasons, like browser compatibility.  If\nyou&#39;ve assigned replacement semantics to PUT and POST, while also\nassigning creation semantics to POST, it&#39;s just a workaround (what&#39;s\nimportant is that you understand the visibility/idempotency tradeoffs\nJan mentioned).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
