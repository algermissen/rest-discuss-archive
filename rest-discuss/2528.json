HTTP is one part of an application whose \narchitectural style is described by REST.  HTTP is what defines the \nsemantics of GET and POST.  REST only says that the command set should \nbe small and general and that messages should be stateless.\n\n\nI think if you look at why people claim the web is successful, you can \nprobably relate most of those claims to some principle of a REST-style \narchitecture.\n\nFor instance, it seems to me that a large part of the web&#39;s scalability \n(performance-wise) is related to the pervasiveness of caches and \nproxies.  I don&#39;t think caches and proxies would work very well if they \ncouln&#39;t rely on the majority of messages being stateless.  (Caches are \ngreat for detecting deviations from REST.)  And, I think caches and \nproxies would be much harder to implement if the set of commands in HTTP \nwas much larger than it is.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
