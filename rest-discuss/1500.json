If I want to publish a web service that allows\n&gt; control of the AC in my building, why should I not provide individual\nlinks\n&gt; for &quot;On&quot;, &quot;Off&quot;, and &quot;Adjust Temperature&quot;?  E-commerce sites to this all\nthe\n&gt; time with buttons that &quot;Add to cart&quot; or &quot;Submit transaction&quot;.\nA network effect occurs when many participate in a limited arena - everybody\nuses TCP/IP, rather than netbios, netbui, banyan, etc. By having many verbs,\nthere is no limited arena - no network effect.\n\nIts an object+method approach rather than a function-only approach, and the\nobject+method are separately identifiable. If you don&#39;t separate\nobject+method, you get object1.invoke(), object2.invoke(), etc. It is a\n/workable/ system, but with the slight change to object.method1(),\nobject.method2(), you get more benefit - but the benefit drops off if you\nhave object.method99(), object.mymethod99(), etc.\n\nAs for why not with the WWW, the reason is that there is already a slot in\nthe message for both id and method - use them. There are already a small set\nof method defined - used them. The more that participate in this arena, the\nmore &#39;network effect&#39; will happen.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe another way to look at this is to look at the core &quot;GET, PUT, POST,\n&gt; and DELETE&quot; as basic &quot;access&quot; mechanisms of an addressing scheme, not\nreally\n&gt; &quot;verbs&quot; in the sense of actions we would like to perform on things.  So,\n&gt; REST isn&#39;t about reducing the &quot;verbs&quot; and making as many things &quot;nouns&quot; as\n&gt; possible, but about having an universal addressing and access mechanism.\nThis is unclear to me - what is different between &#39;access&#39; and &#39;action&#39;? The\ninternal implementation of the interface can have any number of custom\nactions - but the public contract and observed behavior is a common/standard\none. Exposing internal action names and assumptions is not necessary and\nfragments the total space of addressable things.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This also relates to the idea that it is preferable to avoid query\nstrings.\n&gt; This is certainly valid for accessing real &quot;noun&quot; type resources.  But, in\n&gt; many cases, query strings are used when we are really accessing &quot;verb&quot;\ntype\n&gt; resources.  For example, I think it is a real stretch to say that a Google\n&gt; search URI is pointing at a &quot;noun&quot; type resource.  We are basically asking\n&gt; Google&#39;s search (&quot;verb&quot;) resource to do a search for us and we pass along\n&gt; our search criteria as query strings.\nThe fundamental shift of thinking &#39;Web&#39; is that we aren&#39;t asking Google to\ndo a search - I bet you it&#39;s cached with some form of consistent hashing and\nthey /don&#39;t/ actually search anyway. What we are asking for are the\n/results/ - and those results are just plain data blobs. You can think of it\nas &#39;do search&#39; - but that doesn&#39;t apply to all other systems, whereas the\n&#39;get results&#39; /will/ apply to all other systems. The Google search URI\npoints to the results, not the query engine.\n\n\n\n"}}
