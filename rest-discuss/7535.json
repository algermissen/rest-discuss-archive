They make\nugly object references, and most civilized web software translates\nhuman readable URLs to CGI environment variables using rewrite rules.\nSee Rails,  Python Routes/WSGI, and good old mod_rewrite. In theory,\nstructured path segments allow more versatile delegation of authority,\nbut it doesn&#39;t seem economically compelling so far.\n\n-Rob\n\nOn 1/9/07, Roy T.
