Ordinary callbacks are like SMTP. No\n&gt; more or less secure. No paranoia.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Secure&quot; callbacks are created ONLY on a persistent connection created\n&gt; from the client to the server, potentially using SSL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s corporate America&#39;s definition of secure\n&gt; behind-the-firewall software. Outgoing is secure. Incoming is insecure.\n&gt; So secure callbacks would work just like MSN messenger or ICQ or\n&gt; Napster, you turn the thing on, it &quot;calls home&quot; and opens a connection.\n\nNon-secure callbacks via a full HTTP server would quickly lead to a parade of\nserious vulnerabilities.  If you feel that it wouldn&#39;t have to be a full HTTP\nserver, then you are agreeing with my main point.\n\nSSL callbacks would add complexity, expose the server, increase ability to DoS,\nincrease the number of possible holes.  It completely fails to solve the\nproblem.\n\n&gt; Insofar as the client knows what server it has contacted, the security\n&gt; requirements are much lower.\n&gt; After all, Web browsers have historically\n&gt; been terribly insecure but the practical damage caused by them is low\n&gt; because the end-user controls what sites he/she contacts. So\n&gt; accountability is pretty good (&quot;here&#39;s the URL of the site that deleted\n&gt; my hard drive&quot;) and it is really hard to get a million users to come to\n&gt; your site and download your virus.\n\nI can see that you didn&#39;t put time into understanding what I wrote, because that\nis 90% of my point.  The PSP algorithms piggybacks notification security on the\nexisting security of HTTP client requests.\n\n&gt; The care and thought put into your PSP won&#39;t mean squat to a corporate\n&gt; sysadmin. And on reflection I do think that practically speaking,\n&gt; unidirectional connections provide more safety than paranoid protocol\n&gt; implementations. And anyhow, it is pretty easy to set up a single\n&gt; unidirectional connection to your &quot;event server&quot; on the Web and let it\n&gt; handle the security crap for you.\n\nSorry, you need to explain what you mean by unidirectional.  You mean that a\nclient which wishes to receive events must connect to a presence server a la\nKnowNow?  That is a non-starter.  No chance.  The resources are right there on\nthe client.  You mean that if the accounting web server wants to send an event\nto Joe the Accountant in the next cube they have to rendezvous at the KN router\nin California?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
