If you want to\n&gt; compare REST to GTP I&#39;d start there, especially with this bit:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of\n&gt; resources; manipulation of resources through representations;\n&gt; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application\n&gt; state.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it is easy to answer whether GTP is RESTful. To do so, I\n&gt; would have to really understand it, almost as well as you do, and then\n&gt; try to apply it mentally to a bunch of REST-architected systems and see\n&gt; whether it handles them properly.\n\nNow, this is something I can understand.  Thanks.\n\nSo, the basic constraints are:\n\n1) Identification of resources: I am not sure about this one.  In part, I\nhaving trouble what it means to &quot;identify a resource&quot; in a RESTful fashion.\nThe most common technique, as I understand it, is the URI.  However, I am\nnot sure that I understand what exactly makes the URI the right\nidentification method for the job (unless this is just because of it&#39;s\nrelationship to HTTP, etc.).\n\nI suppose the other problem here is that this part of GTP is somewhat left\nto be handled be the application that is implemented on top of it.  In other\nwords, it is up to the application that uses GTP to determine the actual\nidentification process, format, etc.  The main reason I did this is because\nI could not see what advantage there would be to forcing all GTP-enabled\napplications to use URIs (as opposed to some other identification format).\n\n2) Manipulation of resources through representations: Now, I have always had\na question about this one.  How exactly can one manipulate resources over a\nnetwork any other way?  In other words, it seems to me that any time I\ncommunicate with a computer that returns a resource to me, I can only ever\nget a &quot;representation&quot; of that resource (even if the representation contains\nall known aspects of that resource).  When I download my e-mail, I am\nretrieving a representation of what is on the POP server.  When I send an\ne-mail, the SMTP server is only getting a representation of that e-mail.\nWhen I download a file from FTP, I am getting a representation of what is on\nthe FTP server.  If I were to then edit the downloaded representation and\nupload it back again, I am sending back a request to update the remote\nresource through my version of the representation.  Does any of what I am\nsaying make sense, or am I just not grasping what is really meant by this\nconstraint?\n\n3) Self-descriptive messages: GTP has got this one.  Since it is base on ONX\n(or XML), this is a given.\n\n4) Hypermedia as the engine of applications state:  Okay, I think I\nunderstand this one.  All that this is saying is that any given\nrepresentation of a resource contains some sort of link to other\nrepresentations of the same or other resource(s).  In HTML, it is the URL in\nanchors, etc.  These links are the only allowable methods by which a state\ncan be transferred from one representation to another representation (or\nfrom one state to another state).  Now, how this applies to GTP is a good\nquestion.  In part, I think this is somewhat like the same argument I have\nfor #1 above.  I think that, as GTP stands now, it does not impose the\nmethod by which &quot;hypermedia&quot; is achieved.\n\nMaybe in order for GTP to be more REST-like, I need to impose the resource\nidentification and hypermedia rules up front.  For instance, maybe the URI\nshould be the only allowable format.  This would certainly make this aspect\nof GTP universal across implementations, but would it also impose\nrestrictions on what can and cannot realistically be done with GTP?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
