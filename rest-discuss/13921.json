Silly? It may =\r\nbe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess it helps understand where are we standing i=\r\nn terms of REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *API=\r\n Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Subcategories:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This are the ones tha=\r\nt think REST is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So the=\r\nir discussions are solely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on URIs, and their presen=\r\ntations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *RPCers*. Bad group that th=\r\nink REST is a way to map RPC in\n&gt; disguise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using URIs in a web AP=\r\nI. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RPC at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Ex=\r\nposers*: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thi=\r\nnk you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; API for exposing things on the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*: Another=\r\n repeated group. They think REST is a web api\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CRUD. Simple.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Mappers*: This other category may use the API idea, b=\r\nut they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing REST is a representation type and th=\r\ne work to be done is to\n&gt; map\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all that is know used to that new t=\r\nype. Interesting?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*. Again, the idea is that CRUD can b=\r\ne mapped naturally\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes=\r\n it RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, da=\r\nta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call their systems=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t=\r\n he reminders of the types.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Standard Haters*: Here you have all those that think Standards=\r\n\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you have the freedo=\r\nm to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they follow REST doing whatever the=\r\ny want.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *KISS lovers*. This are the ones that like thinks to be=\r\n simple.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doi=\r\nng easy things\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in thi=\r\ns group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and someone =\r\ntold them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to do services without SOAP. So the=\r\ny follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority. They like buz=\r\nz words, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is cool and al=\r\nl people talk about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are some Buzz creators too, w=\r\nith thinks like ROA and REST in WOA.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No pun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended on RES=\r\nT-*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably =\r\nthe group that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST as it actually is and understan d=\r\ns it.

But now you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; say that this is not a &quot;humorous&quot;=\r\n post but it should be taken literally, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because &quot;the intenti=\r\non is to identify how is the REST term used and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; understood.&quot;=\r\n And we have to identify ourselves in one of the groups you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; menti=\r\non, most of them &quot;because it&#39;s cool&quot;, because &quot;someone t=\r\nold then&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and &quot;so they follow&quot;, practically all of=\r\n them described in terms that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are either humorous or (xor) dimini=\r\nshing...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I myself think I can fall in more than one grou=\r\np, but I prefer to think &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that is because I&#39;m in a early stage=\r\n of working with REST and I have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lot&#39;s of things yet to grasp=\r\n and little time to do it, and not just &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because I found REST cool=\r\n and all people talk about it., or because &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; someone told me someth=\r\ning and I just follow, or because I&#39;m shallow &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; enough to belie=\r\nve REST is HTTP, or naive enough to think is simple &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CRUD... That =\r\nwould be to dismiss a person as of little intelligence, not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to sa=\r\ny other harsh words...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Finally, do you really believe th=\r\nere is only a person that knows REST as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it actually is and unders=\r\ntands it, being that person Roy, or is that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; part irony/humorous? =\r\nBecause I don&#39;t belong to that particular group for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sure, but=\r\n to some people on this list that wrote lot&#39;s of good articles &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; in blogs from which I learned a lot that is, at least, unfair...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Not that I think your intention was that, of course.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Hello Bill.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not sure of your intention with the comm=\r\nent. Sounds like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; disapprovement, due to the negative concept=\r\nion of the &quot;stereotype&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; word. Not even sure of you=\r\nr idea of my idea by writing the list.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me s=\r\ntate it again:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I love doing so sometimes (Naming things=\r\n) to know what am I referring to&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I guess it helps=\r\n understand where are we standing in terms of REST &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; usability=\r\n and knowledge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had been in hundreds of=\r\n discussions. Most of the time, two people &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; discuss about dif=\r\nferent things that are named the same. So, my first &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; action i=\r\ns to clarify what I mean by that name. Just as I did now with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; my idea in the lines above.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok, let&#39;s sta=\r\nrt again: I&#39;ve created a classification of the common &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; un=\r\nderstandings people that I&#39;ve read and discussed with, had shown &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; related to REST. The intention is to identify how is the REST term=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; used and understood. It makes no sense to put a face on eac=\r\nh class, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; when we want common behavior for analysis.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry if taken as a bad thing. Not my intention.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; William.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rest-discuss@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss=\r\n%2540yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&=\r\ngt;, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Assign a person to each of your stereotypes, let them and everyone else&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Still a good =\r\nidea?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; willmarpo wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reading through al=\r\nl this good material about REST, I find some old &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; time&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussions around. Someone suggested naming things is no=\r\nt so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; good, but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love doing so somet=\r\nhings to know what am I referring to.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I wanted to present a &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; classification&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did two days ago while ri=\r\nding the bus to work. Silly? It may be, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; guess it helps understand where are we standing in terms of REST&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *API Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a sys=\r\ntem, usually not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; built thinking on REST, and they w=\r\nant an API created. They usually &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; think&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; /Subcategories:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This ar=\r\ne the ones that think REST is all about&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creating UR=\r\nIs, and nothing more. So their discussions are solely &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; focuse=\r\nd&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on URIs, and their presentations are about URIs d=\r\nefinitions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *RPCers*. Bad group that think REST i=\r\ns a way to map RPC in disguise&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using URIs in a web =\r\nAPI. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; RPC at all.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*: This type is repeated below. Those ar=\r\ne the guys that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think you need to expose things in =\r\nREST using resources. So REST &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAPI for exposing things on the web.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*: An=\r\nother repeated group. They think REST is a web api for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; CRUD. Simple.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Mappers*=\r\n: This other category may use the API idea, but they &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; actuall=\r\ny&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work =\r\nto be done is to map&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all that is know used to that =\r\nnew type. Interesting?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*. Again, the idea=\r\n is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTTP opera=\r\ntions, and that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes it RESTful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; - *HTTPers*. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; - *Exposers*. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, data=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call t=\r\nheir systems &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; RESTful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; FAD followers?*: This is a group of t he reminders of the types=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; - *Standard Haters*: Here you have all those that think Standar=\r\nds are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you h=\r\nave the freedom to do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they fo=\r\nllow REST doing whatever they want.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *KISS lovers*=\r\n. This are the ones that like thinks to be simple. And&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things with&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in this group.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and som=\r\neone told them &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to do s=\r\nervices without SOAP. So they follow.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *BuzzWorder=\r\ns*. This is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; they&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is cool and all people t=\r\nalk about it. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are some Buzz cr=\r\neators too, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No pun&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended on REST-*&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the gro=\r\nup that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; knows&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST as it actually is=\r\n and understan ds it. That may be a one person&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grou=\r\np (yes Roy).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m may no=\r\nt be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; saying they are good, at all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Do you find yourself in any of those grou=\r\nps?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; William Martinez Pomare=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n    =\r\n\n    &lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00163649914bb477c20476d4a3a0--\r\n\n"}}
