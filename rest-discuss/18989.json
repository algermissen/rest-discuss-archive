If the request body contains a URI that points\nto http://aonline=\r\nstore.com/sku/jumbopackofshrimp then that maybe is\nthe exactly what that th=\r\ne user is requesting.  The fact that this week\na jumbo pack of shrimp conta=\r\nins 10 shrimp and last week it contained 8\nshrimp is irrelevant to the user=\r\n because the identifier is specifying\nwhat the user wants.\n\nI believe that =\r\nto discount the my weathersnapshot scenario based on\nthe fact that I used a=\r\n text/uri-list is addressing a different point.\nI admit that I tend to be s=\r\nomewhat more cavalier about allowing the\nserver to pile on semantics to a m=\r\nessage than I would ever allow a\nclient to do and I realize that&#39;t not a go=\r\nod idea.  However, I believe\nthe point I was trying to make is just as vali=\r\nd if I were to use\napplication/vnd.acme.list-of-uris-to-weather-images.\n\nWh=\r\nat are negative effects of allowing a server to dereference a link\ncontaine=\r\nd in the request to acquire all the information necessary to\nprocess the re=\r\nquest?\n\nClients do this all the time.  A web browser isn&#39;t finished process=\r\ning\na HTML message until it has dereferenced the stylesheet link to get\nall=\r\n the details about how to render the page prettily.  A web page\nthat is mis=\r\nsing all of its images may completely fail to communicate\nits intent to the=\r\n user .\n\nDarrel\n\nOn Fri, Aug 24, 2012 at 8:29 PM, Mark Baker &lt;distobj@acm.o=\r\nrg&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Darrel. I think I did answer your question, at least=\r\n by addressing the most subtle point you raised in the sku message. I hope =\r\nits clear after reading my explanation that your last message was not self =\r\ndescriptive because you used the text/uri-list media type. Also, you&#39;d find=\r\n that designing a media type to be able to self-descriptively encapsulate e=\r\nverything you need to know about a shopping cart in a single URI, is intrac=\r\ntable. It makes for an interesting thought exercise but is practically unwo=\r\nrkable.\n&gt;\n&gt; P.s. never too late to change the subject line :-)\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n"}}
