If  \nso, you&#39;d need to return 200 (or 300?[1]) with a representation that  \nconveys the need to choose and also the semantic difference. The  \nclient would of course need to understand the representation. The  \nsemantics of the message must be shared between client and server pre- \nruntime. Consider HTML link tags as an example, where the link  \nsemantics are part of the standard (== shared knowledge).\n\nIf there resources are pure alternatives (semantically equivalent)   \n300 is the proper code I think.\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.1\n\n&gt; My question is, which HTTP status code best represents this &quot;query\n&gt; accepted, but disambiguation required&quot; situation?\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought about &quot;HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices&quot;, as it seems the\n&gt; obvious choice at first glance, but the HTTP RFC talks about content\n&gt; negotiation, which isn&#39;t what I&#39;m trying to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it make more sense to return &quot;HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found&quot;, and a list\n&gt; of alternative URLs?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
