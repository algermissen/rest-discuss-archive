I&#39;m not trying to piss you off; just trying to understand\nyour position, specifically:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This issue is orthogonal to the &quot;making up a new media type for every \n&gt; resource encountered&quot; discussion, that&#39;s a best practise thing I hope\n&gt; we could discuss.\n&gt; \n\nIf we assume that opaque identifiers are somehow self-descriptive, then\nthere&#39;s room to have this debate.  I don&#39;t understand how they can be,\nso I can&#39;t see the issue as orthogonal, rather than central.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric, FACT is that using IANA registered media types on the web is a \n&gt; SHOULD, using a non registered type is &quot;discouraged&quot; - do we really\n&gt; need to take this to the TAG and to the IETF http working group and\n&gt; waste there time with something which is widely understood.\n&gt; \n\nThe WebArch document states that we SHOULD send identifiers, but says\nnothing about whether such identifiers need to be registered.  HTTP\nsays not using IANA is &quot;discouraged&quot; which I think is quite clear;\nhowever, judging from the pushback, I disagree that it&#39;s &quot;widely\nunderstood&quot; to mean what it says.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This issue is orthogonal to the &quot;making up a new media type for every \n&gt; resource encountered&quot; discussion, that&#39;s a best practise thing I hope\n&gt; we could discuss.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s exactly the discussion I&#39;ve been trying to have all year.  But\nwe keep coming back to the assumption that application/foo+xml is just\nas self-descriptive as application/xhtml+xml, on the Web.  I&#39;m not\nactually _trying_ to get folks upset with me, I just don&#39;t understand\nhow this is seen as an orthogonal concern?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
