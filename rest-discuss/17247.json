Each statement can be considered true \nor false, and when you combine all the statements which you consider \ntrue about a thing, that set of statements forms a description of the \nthing (which can also be considered your current belief state, what \nyou believe to be true about the thing(s) you&#39;re considering). As \nLinked Data is webized, it uses URIs as names for things and \nrelations, and encourages the exposing of statements about those \nthings or relations when you lookup (dereference) the corresponding URIs.\n\nThus one would apply the style and constraints of REST not to Linked \nData, but to the components, the publishing of Linked Data, the \nretrieval of Linked Data over a network, and to the construction of \nAgents which interact with the web of linked data.\n\nConversely, since REST is a set of constraints optimized for the &quot;good \nold fashioned web of documents&quot;, one can review the needs and usage of \nLinked Data to come up with additional constraints, to identify \nmismatches, or to create an entirely new architectural style and set \nof constraints which one would then apply to the web specifications \n(URI, HTTP etc) in order to optimize it.\n\nSuch examples may include:\n\n  - the tight coupling of URIs to protocols in the common case, for \nexample one may need PUT, POST, DELETE to operate through HTTP+TLS \nwhilst GET is through basic HTTP.\n\n  - REST and web optimization for large-grain hypermedia transfer \nwhilst linked data deployment typically needs fine-grained data \ntransfer / huge-grain data-set transfer.\n\n  - Analysis and inclusion of composite application state and single \nclient multi-server interactions.\n\n  - The missing reverse-links.\n\n  - Pipelined requests and async message transfer (allowing for \nmultiple requests to be sent at once and sent back in an optimized \nfashion).\n\nEssentially, REST is over a decade old, and whilst very good, it \ncomprises constraints and a style which was optimized for common use \ncases which are no longer as common, Linked Data, Client-side &quot;ajax&quot; \napplications, cloud storage and cloud computing, version control over \nHTTP and many other now common uses are simply uncatered for, and the \nREST style is not optimized for these cases.\n\nThe only other relation between REST and Linked Data, is that they \nboth use HTTP URIs to identify resources, the web specification and \nREST definitions of the term &quot;resource&quot; is so abstractly defined that \nthis often leads to confusion and inconsistent naming of &quot;resources&quot;, \nhence httpRange-14 and many other issues.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
