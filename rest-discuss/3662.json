Life is change.\n\nIn general, it is far easier to adapt a system that is self-descriptive\n(high visibility of syntactic and semantic meaning within the structure\nof communication), both because the interactions are easier for third\nparties to understand and because the communicating parties are less\nlikely to base their communication on shared out-of-band assumptions:\nassumptions that may not be applicable in the future.  In other words,\nthe components of a successful computing systems are never just\ncommunicating among themselves, because success will lead to change\nand change will lead to new components.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
