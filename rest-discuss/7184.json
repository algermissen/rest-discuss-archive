Indeed, it might not work all the time in \n&gt;&gt;&gt; certain situations. If you were behind (in terms of \n&gt;&gt;&gt; DNS queries) a very restrictive DNS cache you might \n&gt;&gt;&gt; not be able to do dynamic names. \n&gt;\n&gt; Is this like the &quot;Some routers don&#39;t handle unreserved URL characters\n&gt; correctly when unencoded, so best to URL encode *everything*&quot; (but in\n&gt; reality there&#39;s no problem because those routers are so old that 99.9% of\n&gt; them have died or been upgraded or replaced.) \n&gt;\n&gt; Or is it a significant enough concern not to ever depend on unknown\n&gt; subdomains being passed through the public internet so the web server can\n&gt; handle them using host headers?  Do you (or does anyone) know for sure on\n&gt; this, or is it a hypothetical problem? \n\nIt&#39;s not hypothetical. It is a real problem.\n\nBut I have no imperical evidence to qualify the size of the problem.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
