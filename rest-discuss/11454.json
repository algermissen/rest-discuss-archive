Any feedback is welcome.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://tinyurl.com/ddd7-rest\n&gt;&gt; [2] http://www.developerday.co.uk/\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting presentation. A couple of thoughts, keyed by slide number\n&gt; in square brackets:\n&gt;\n&gt; * [14] The idea that all important resources are given one URI seems\n&gt; more restrictive than need be -- I don&#39;t see a problem with having\n&gt; multiple URIs for one resource (GET /orders/latestday and GET\n&gt; /orders/20081107\n&gt; might return the same results, at least today), or having a URI that\n&gt; returns a collection of resources. When describing REST to newbies,\n&gt; I prefer a statement like &quot;All interesting resources are given at least\n&gt; one URI&quot; to get to the point I think you&#39;re trying to make here.\n&gt;\n&gt; * [24] Although a particular system might have both REST and WS_*\n&gt; interfaces,\n&gt; I would hope you make the point in your comments that it&#39;s unlikely you will\n&gt; be able to use the same server side classes to process both kinds of\n&gt; requests.\n&gt; Properly done, the two kinds of resource classes will be organized\n&gt; quite differently, but developers new to this still think they can\n&gt; be combined.\n&gt;\n&gt; * [27] Maybe I just missed it, but I would have expected to see a discussion\n&gt; of\n&gt; supporting multiple representations somewhere (maybe here). Maybe its also\n&gt; because this particular area is the most troubling about REST for me\n&gt; ... even if\n&gt; you have agreed to an XML representation, how is the client supposed to\n&gt; &quot;know&quot;\n&gt; that a &lt;link/&gt; element is actually a URI that can be used to\n&gt; instigate a state change,\n&gt; as opposed to (say) a &lt;uri&gt; element instead?\n\nThat&#39;s why mime types are so important in REST.  A client knows how to\ndeal with, say, application/atom+xml, or application/xhtml+xml --\nthat&#39;s how it recognizes hyperlinks.\n\n--peter keane\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Craig McClanahan\n&gt; \n\n"}}
