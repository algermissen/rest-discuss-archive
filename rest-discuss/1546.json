Mike Dierken [mailto:mdierken@...]\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is fine for many actions, but for many other actions, this is very\n&gt; &gt; awkward thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any time you start with &#39;foo&#39; and convert to &#39;bar&#39;, it&#39;s easy to say that\n&gt; &#39;bar&#39; is awkward from the point of view of &#39;foo&#39;.\n&gt; Rather than converting &#39;action&#39; into &#39;noun&#39;, convert &#39;action&#39; into\n&gt; &#39;noun+action&#39;. Then see how many actions you minimally need to get the job\n&gt; done.\n\nAgain, I am by no means trying to force people to change their thinking to a\nmore \nverb-oriented procedural model if they are comfortable with resource and\nstate model.  I am simply proposing that we don&#39;t limit the programmers to\nthinking in a noun-centric way if it makes sense to allow verbs to be part\nof the picture.\n\nMaybe, we can just change the recommended best practice to say that it is\nusually a good practice to expose states and noun resources, even if one is\nalso exposing verb resources.  Encouraging one does not have to mean\neliminating the other.\n\n&gt; Lets list these many other actions, show the two approaches and see what\n&gt; everybody thinks.\n\nA few things that are very procedural would again be driving a car, cooking\na rack of lamb, or flying a kite, etc.\n\n&gt; &gt; Few people really thinking of turning on the air\n&gt; &gt; conditioning as changing the state of the AC into the &quot;ON&quot; state.\n&gt; But what about software systems? How are they best described?\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous email, at the program level, many programs do\nreduce to state management problems.  But, it doesn&#39;t mean people have to\nthink that way as well.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I definitely agree that having a record created of an action as a\n&gt; &gt; consequence is often useful, but doesn&#39;t necessarily make that the\nnatural\n&gt; &gt; mental model for programmers or ultimately, end-users.\n&gt; True - but REST isn&#39;t about procedural programming or end-users mental\n&gt; models, it is about large scale networked systems.\n&gt; RDBMS and SQL isn&#39;t all that natural for programmers and don&#39;t even try to\n&gt; explain it to end-users, but they still have some value.\n\nI never said that resource-modeling isn&#39;t valuable - on the contrary.  I&#39;m\nonly saying that resource modeling isn&#39;t the *only* valuable way to do\nthings.  RDBMS and SQL is certain useful, but so are spreadsheets and web\nlogs.\n\nIf you are saying REST is not meant to support a procedural model, I will\ndefer that question to the people defined REST and are refining REST.  But\nif that is true, we will need an alternative architecture for the web to\nsupport the procedural programming model.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are saying that large scale network systems should\nnot support procedural programming, I have to ask why you think that is the\ncase?  I for one would still want to be able to program procedurally for\nlarge scale network applications as a complement to the resource model.\n\n//Joe\n\n\n\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
