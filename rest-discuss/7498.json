You can then move on to definitions of resources\n&gt; that help express the meaning of the classic HTTP methods:\n...\n&gt; This set of definitions defines the resource concept in a different  \n&gt; way\n&gt; to REST, and I think forms a subset of theoretical REST that can form\n&gt; the basis of discussion about which methods a particular architecture\n&gt; should have. It lies somewhere between the real web and REST theory  \n&gt; as a\n&gt; practical bridge of good web style.\n\nPerhaps you should consider what the purpose of these definitions\nmay be, and what it is you are trying to describe.\n\nREST is a model of an idealized Web application that attempts to\nmaximize a particular set of properties that I consider to be\nthe &quot;most important properties&quot; of the Web as a whole.  Its purpose\nis to guide architecture decisions in light of that model, so that\nI can avoid breaking the important bits while developing the\narchitecture and so that developers can understand the\nimportant bits when developing applications.\n\nThe problem with your model is that it doesn&#39;t respect reality.\nBy axiomatizing away the notion of resource equivalence you simplify\nthe model, but then your model is incapable of explaining the\ninformation theoretic properties of the Web that I just finished\ndescribing.  In your model, URI aliases are not an issue because\nthey don&#39;t exist.  In the REST model, URI aliases are an issue\nbecause they reduce the perceived importance of a given resource\nand reduce the efficiency of caching resource representations.\n\nREST teaches the architect that reducing aliases will result in a\nmore efficient system, whereas your model just assumes such a\nreduction is impossible.  Google search ranking and duplicate result\npresentation emphasize the same characteristics as the REST model\nbecause those are characteristics of the information space\nas we know it (the Web).  And you say that your model is somewhere\nbetween the &quot;real Web&quot; and REST theory?  Wrong.  The Web is a lot\nmore than the sum of client-server interaction.\n\nSo, the question then isn&#39;t how you might define resources.  The\nquestion is what do you intend to accomplish by doing so?  There\nare many ways to look at any given system, particularly when\nfocusing on only one of the components.  An abstraction like REST\nis supposed to help the designer identify mismatches in the\narchitecture.  Perhaps you don&#39;t see the problem because you\naren&#39;t applying your model to the Web as a whole, but rather\nsomething more limited (such as a server-side development\nframework)?\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
