(Then you find HTTP Auth\n&gt; &gt; credentials and a cookie with an ID in the same HTTP request,\n&gt; &gt; so you know they belong to each other.)\n&gt; \n&gt; No, that&#39;s not a good use of cookies. Here once again the\n&gt; shopping cart needs to be identified by a visible URL, not a\n&gt; cookie.\n\nAddressability of the shopping cart is orthogonal.\n\nThe situation is this: an anonymous user started putting items in\na shopping cart. In the midst of her shopping tour, she realises\nshe was logged out, so she logs in. You do *not* want her to lose\nthe items she put in her shopping cart so far; you have to\nassociate that shopping cart with the account she logged in to.\n\nWhether the shopping cart was explicitly addressable or hidden\nbehind a gateway URI is inconsequential. But if you want to do\nit without URI rewriting, you *need* the cookie to associate an\nanonymous user with a cart.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
