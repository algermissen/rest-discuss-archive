The only way in which HEAS\ncould be=\r\n interpreted as entailing URI opacity is to interpret this\nsentence as foll=\r\nows: &quot;The model application [MUST] move[] from one\nstateto the next by exam=\r\nining and choosing from among [ONLY] the\nalternative statetransitions in th=\r\ne current set of representations.&quot;\n\nIn other words, the client can ONLY exe=\r\ncute state transition by\ndereferencing a URI that is in the set of URIs tha=\r\nt have been embedded\nin the current set of representations.

The=\r\n issue is\nwhether the agent is forbidden from dereferencing any URI that is=\r\nn&#39;t in\nthe current page or in the agent&#39;s page history. Etan appears to bel=\r\nieve\nthat the REST state machine must make only certain state transitions ,=\r\n\nnot directly  GOTO any &quot;state&quot; at any time by simply using a bookmarked\nor=\r\n composed URI. If this were truly a constraint imposed by HEAS, then a\nclie=\r\nnt&#39;s attempt to dereference  a URI that it had composed but that\nwasn&#39;t alr=\r\neady present in the current set (history) of HTML\nrepresentations (even if =\r\nauthorized by documentation such as URI\ntemplates) would be illegal.\n\nFor e=\r\nxample, imagine an Ohio weather service that had a landing page\n(weather.oh=\r\nio.gov) that had links to all the major cities in Ohio. And\nassume on each =\r\ncity page there were three links for today, tomorrow, and\nthe day after tom=\r\norrow (eg. weather.ohio.gov/dayton/tomorrow). This\nstrict interpretation of=\r\n HEAS would say that it is illegal for an agent\nto traverse from weather.oh=\r\nio.gov directly to\nweather.ohio.gov/dayton/tomorrow (even if the service do=\r\ncumented the\nsite structure) because the agent is only allowed to traverse =\r\nthe URIs\ncontained in the landing page (eg weather.ohio.gov/dayton).\n\nWhile=\r\n such a strict interpretation of HEAS has some merit (it prevents\nthe agent=\r\n from hard-coding any URI structure into its traversal\nlogic--all URI struc=\r\nture metadata is [dynamically] generated with each\nrepresentation returned)=\r\n, there is no basis in the thesis or in ANY REST\nor Web specifications or d=\r\niscussions for such a restrictive view of the\n&quot;state machine&quot; model of REST=\r\n.
