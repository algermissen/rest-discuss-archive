IMO, the Developer&#39;s Key has an explicit impact \n&gt; on how the idea of a &quot;safe method&quot; should be interpreted.\n\nI don&#39;t see it as any different than the authorization info as part of\nan HTTP authentication transaction - it authenticates the user.  I\ndon&#39;t see how it changes anything.\n\n&gt; Interpreting safety this strictly, in this context, would seem to \n&gt; render an entire class of Web Services essentially un-GETable.  \n&gt; It would seem to reinforce the perception that REST is only good \n&gt; for mostly public data.\n\nI don&#39;t see it that way.  Would you argue that a GET that bumped up a\ncounter was safe?\n\n&gt; Given your comments, do you see Xoomle as broken?  \n\n&quot;Broken&quot; is too strong.  &quot;Sub-optimal&quot;, yes.\n\n&gt; How is this really any different from any web site that \n&gt; does session time-outs?  In that case, is the fact that\n&gt; the session time-out clock is reset when following a link\n&gt; considered an action of &quot;unexpected significance?&quot;  This \n&gt; is almost a mirror image of the Google hit counter: in one \n&gt; case following a link has the implicit effect of keeping \n&gt; the session alive; in the other, it is slowly eating it away.  \n&gt; But in both cases the user &quot;did not request the side-effects&quot; \n&gt; explicitly.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that Google is demonstrating the beginnings of\n&gt; a Pay-per-Use business model, that other public Web Services \n&gt; may need to adopt in order to generate income.  I expect that \n&gt; in the future, Google will be selling Keys, say $100 per billion \n&gt; queries (or something like that) :)\n\nI think my statements may have been taken out of context.  I was just\nanswering Sam&#39;s question; I wouldn&#39;t use GET to perform a query that\nwas unsafe.  What I didn&#39;t say, but would still try to do, is to\nidentify the results of each query by a URI, so that I could re-GET\nthem over and over without those being counted as a hit against my 1000\n(unless Google doesn&#39;t want to let you - a distinct possibility, sigh).\n\nAnyhow, this is a bizarre case, because Google&#39;s business model on this\nservice is completely screwed.  They&#39;d be much better off opening up\nhttp://www.google.com/xml and saying &quot;not for commercial use without\nagreement&quot;.  So as an example to set precedence, you can pretty much\ncompletely ignore Google.  Not that others won&#39;t try and copy them, but\nthey won&#39;t last either.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
