Fielding wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t read too much into what is obviously a poor choice of words.\n&gt; &gt; What they meant to say is that some services correspond to a range\n&gt; &gt; (template) of URIs for which guessing the potential values in that\n&gt; &gt; range is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, even if there turns\n&gt; &gt; out to be no resource for a given guess. There are no guarantees\n&gt; &gt; on the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have a hypermedia application client/agent that interprets the\n&gt; resources it receives and then uses that resource as the basis for\n&gt; determining the available state transitions supported by the  \n&gt; server, why\n&gt; would you need to bother with guessing (or relying on a URI template)\n&gt; for an automated agent?\n&gt;\n\nFor the same reason that you would bother using Google search.\nLook in the HTTP spec for the phrase &quot;all modern information  \nsystems ...&quot;.\n\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I see URI templates as a pragmatic shortcut so  \n&gt; that\n&gt; agent authors don&#39;t need to bother with interpreting the hypermedia  \n&gt; they\n&gt; receive. This makes writing agents more in line with standard modes of\n&gt; thinking about software design and implementation, e.g. to  \n&gt; accomplish a\n&gt; task, you make calls to functions with known parameters in an order\n&gt; determined by the caller to trigger state transitions and/or receive\n&gt; some expected output.\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s one way to use them, yes.  The other way is computed links.\n\n&gt; However, if that&#39;s the way you approach development of a hypermedia\n&gt; application where the service has the opportunity - by design - to  \n&gt; tell\n&gt; you about the available state transitions and the location of other\n&gt; resources that it thinks are related/relevant to the current resource,\n&gt; how is your agent really part of a hypermedia application?\n&gt;\n\nAgain, the other way is computed links (see hypertext research).\n\n&gt; As Nick pointed out, there aren&#39;t many systems out there that do this\n&gt; (interactive Web browsers being a notable exception). I think this is\n&gt; one of the drivers for the sem-web initiatives, but I also think  \n&gt; there&#39;s\n&gt; value in trying to leverage this approach today to build more robust\n&gt; software systems that can gracefully handle changes in the service\n&gt; implementation.\n&gt;\n\nThere are many systems that use computed links.  Almost all of the\nclosed-world hypertext systems had automated dictionary lookup\n(click on any non-linked word and it retrieves the dictionary\nentry for that word).  Programming IDEs do much the same.  A template\nis just a way for a server to tell a client that there is a range\nof resources available -- just like server-side image maps, HTML\nforms, and (in less visible ways) javascript.  As long as the template\nis defined by the server, they are still links.  As long as the template\nis defined by the server in a recent representation, it is RESTful.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
