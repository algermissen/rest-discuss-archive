It is perfectly ok to use extension methods in your  \nparticular scenario - the important aspect is that REST guarantees  \nthat existing clients and servers will not need to be touched. Sure -  \nthey do not understand your methods, but they will not break either.\n\nThe only important thing to keep in mind is that the meaning of the  \nmethods must not be specific to your use case domain, but must  \npotentially make sense for any resource.\n\nREPORT, WATCH, PATCH, for example are fine, while GET_STOCK_QUOTE or  \nWATCH_TEMPERATURE are not.\n\nJan\n\n\nOn May 5, 2008, at 9:04 PM, Etan Wexler wrote:\n&gt; Julian Reschke wrote (in\n&gt; &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10726&gt;) of  \n&gt; the\n&gt; use of HTTP methods &quot;SEARCH&quot; and &quot;REPORT&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s still conformant with HTTP/1.1 [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; What is HTTP/1.1, Julian? The abstract of RFC 2616\n&gt; (&lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt&gt;) reads, in part, as\n&gt; follows.\n&gt;\n&gt; &#39;The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level  \n&gt; protocol\n&gt; [...] which can be used for many tasks [...] through extension of its\n&gt; request methods, error codes and headers [...]. [...] This  \n&gt; specification\n&gt; defines the protocol referred to as &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;.&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; If RFC 2616 is definitive on HTTP/1.1, then any method that is not\n&gt; specified in RFC 2616 is not part of HTTP/1.1 and is not conformant  \n&gt; with\n&gt; HTTP/1.1. Sure, the methods &quot;SEARCH&quot; and &quot;REPORT&quot; are part of the  \n&gt; larger\n&gt; family of HTTP, as the abstract implies. Sure, these methods are often\n&gt; in messages whose HTTP-Version is &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;. If you take the stand  \n&gt; that\n&gt; RFC 2616 is not definitive on HTTP/1.1, I won&#39;t censor you or dislike\n&gt; you or speak ill of you behind your back. I&#39;ll just disagree.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, none of this matters regarding Representational State\n&gt; Transfer, which has no constraint on which specifications define which\n&gt; protocol features.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Etan Wexler.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
