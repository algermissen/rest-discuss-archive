Writing a WADL file means that you&#39;re duplicating the\n&gt; discovery process provided by HTTP itself.\n\nWhat about returning/generating a WADL document upon an OPTIONS request? \nThat would help combine the HTTP discovery process and the WADL \nexpressiveness.\n\n&gt; I would like to develop more tools based on the HTTP discovery process\n&gt; and the patterns that are being developed around REST. It would rely\n&gt; on a sort of duck-REST (if it looks like REST - it must be) approach\n&gt; but it would be interesting.\n\nCould you elaborate a bit more on these ideas?\n\n&gt; The sorts of tools that I am thinking about are code generation tools\n&gt; such as there are in the WS-* world. Point a tool at an endpoint press\n&gt; a button and out comes skeleton Python, Perl, Java or C#.\n\nThe WADL project already contains a wadl2java tools to generate client \nstubs: https://wadl.dev.java.net/wadl2java.html\n\n&gt; Of course... that&#39;s only the client side and one of the nice things\n&gt; about WSDL (did I just say &quot;nice&quot;? must be slipping) is that you can\n&gt; define a WSDL somewhere (by transformation from somewhere else say)\n&gt; and then generate service implementation code from that.\n\nFor the Restlet project, we also plan to add similar tools to generate \nboth client stubs and server skeletons:\nhttp://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=59\n\n&gt; WADL could do that and I&#39;m also looking at that.\n\nAbsolutely, it seems like a useful path to explore!\n\n-- \nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
