There is some path from every point A  \n&gt; to point B and back again.  There&#39;s some way to discover the entire  \n&gt; system using any entry point.\n&gt;\n\nNo.  This is an application of computers to do something useful,\nnot a math problem or a reachability analysis.  Any given client\nmight only be able to reach 1% of a system and still be successful\nat doing what they wanted to do.  The simplest example of that is\na system using authentication and role-based access control.\n\nIn any case, this line of thought is missing the point of REST.\nIf the application state is entirely defined by the client&#39;s\nworkspace (set of representations) and all possible transitions\naway from that state are presented in those representations,\nthen the potential size of the overall system is irrelevant.\nEach state can be considered independently.  That is fundamental\nto the use of state machines to simplify the understanding of\ncomplex systems.\n\nThe client only needs to know what it has in that workspace,\nat that time, and so any pre-definition of URI layout or\nWSDL-like service semantics is an absolute waste of time as\nfar as a RESTful architecture is concerned.  External artifacts\nmight help the developers communicate about or improve the design\nof their system, just as readable URIs will help a human user\nunderstand where they are in a hypertext user-interface, but\nthose external artifacts must not have a role in the runtime\narchitecture if the system is truly hypertext-driven.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
