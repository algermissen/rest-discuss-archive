Is that correct?\n&gt; :\n&gt; \n&gt; I have trouble extracting a clear interpretation from &quot;considered with\n&gt; knowledge representation issues&quot;.  Could you make that more explicit,\n&gt; maybe with reference to specific words Roy used?\n\nWhat I mean is if REST goes beyond the technical aspects of distributed\nsystems?\n\nRoy wrote:\n\n&quot;How do you think about abstract concepts like &quot;3&quot;?  Do you think of\nit symbolically (the glyph) or numerically?  If you need to explain\nto someone the algorithm for calculating the area of a circle, how\ndo you do that?  Those are all representations.&quot;\n\nIf REST is only about the technical aspects (e.g. how messages are\ntransferred, how interfaces are contrained) then what Roy writes is\nIMHO outside the scope of REST. \n\nPut in another way: in what sense is what Roy writes relevant for\nan architectural style for distributed systems?\n\nTo mw, what Roy says, are aspects of a possible application of REST\nbut not REST itself.\n\nSo, what am I missing?\n\n\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
