Thanks Elliotte.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nAlmost everyone does at first, myself included. It&#39;s a classic case of \ntrying to understand something new by analogy with something you already \nunderstand such as SQL. Generally you can push and squeeze enough to \nmake the new thing look sort of like the old thing, but it isn&#39;t till \nyou learn to understand the new thing on its own terms rather than \ntrying to understand it as a weird case of something it isn&#39;t that you \nreally understand it.\n\nThis pattern repeats itself, and not just in technology either. Lord \nknows how many times I&#39;ve gone through this personally. It may be a \nnecessary component of human learning.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
