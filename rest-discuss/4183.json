They satisfy the stateless constraint, but they lose by\ncreating an infinite resource space.  Sessions are rarely necessary,\nbut when they are necessary (such as per-client transaction state that\nneeds to be available via multiple devices) they should be tied to\na specific user, not the browser that user happens to be using.\nAuthentication is where that should be enabled.\n\nA more REST solution for shopping carts is to keep the state on the\nclient, which could be accomplished simply by defining a few commerce\nelements for HTML and the protocol for dealing with the checkout\n(a resource referenced by those elements).  The reasons that did not\nhappen on the Web are purely social, not technical.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
