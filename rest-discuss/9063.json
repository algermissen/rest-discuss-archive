Best support around last time I looked (all\n&gt;  the others have a design flaw in not having a log-out button, though I\n&gt;  think there&#39;s a firefox extension that does that).\n\nI went and refreshed my memory... that was an Apache requirement problem.\n\n&gt;  It means that you have n resources multiplied by m sessions to create\n&gt;  n*m resources with an n*m management task.\n&gt;  Since sessions are generally not something you can reuse safely m is\n&gt;  infinite.\n\nPossibly &quot;session&quot; is the wrong term. My current placeholder is that\nthe browser fills out a username+password form, and the server\nresponds with a cookie containing the username and a &quot;session&quot; token\nthat&#39;s an MD5 digest. The server stores the username, token, and\ntimestamp, and eventually decides that the timestamp is too old. So\nI&#39;m not understanding the &quot;n resources&quot; part... you mean over the\ncourse of the user&#39;s visit?\n\n&gt;  Stop the cookies actually being sent at all in these cases and we can\n&gt;  make that part scale.\n\nYou lost me again... the browser keeps sending the cookies (back) and\nthe server only verifies them when authen is actually required. And\nonly the dumb browsers have cookies.\n\n&gt;  You *really* can&#39;t code securely if you don&#39;t get the security issues at\n&gt;  hand very well. Time for some research.\n\nAlways, yes. I know a fair amount about security, but some of it is &quot;I\nknow enough to know there&#39;s much I don&#39;t know.&quot;\n\n&gt;  There&#39;s plenty better, but I use sessions all the time when I need stuff\n&gt;  done quickly because in many cases I can use the &quot;Session object&quot; in a\n&gt;  given tool kit and do in 5 minutes what takes a large amount of code to do.\n\nAside from the state (or perhaps &quot;state&quot;) of &quot;authenticated or not,&quot; I\ndon&#39;t have any state I need to deal with, I think.\n\n&gt;  I think I would probably think of that in a very separate way. Can&#39;t say\n&gt;  more without knowing more; and even then maybe a whiteboard, some good\n&gt;  coffee and regular smoke-breaks would also help.\n\nWe&#39;re planning to be at YAPC in Houston in a couple of weeks...\n\n"}}
