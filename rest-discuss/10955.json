Just=\r\nin has proffered many excellent\nproposals which I have incorporated. As bac=\r\nkground, Justin is actively\ndeveloping something against the diagram (I&#39;ll =\r\nleave it to Justin to\nelaborate if he wants to).\n\nAfter quite a bit of effo=\r\nrt, we think that the draft of v3 is ready\nfor some peer review by the memb=\r\ners of this list.\n\nThe collective set of changes has resulted in a signific=\r\nantly\ndifferent diagram (and, I hope, more accurate to the RFC2616 [2]).\n\nT=\r\nhe Visio document that I use to edit the diagram is published on\nGoogle Cod=\r\ne [3]. To make review easier (especially if people don&#39;t\nhappen to have a c=\r\nopy of Visio) I have created a PNG [4] in the\ndownload section [5].\n\n[1] ht=\r\ntp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean/http-headers-status.html\n[2] http://www.w3.or=\r\ng/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\n[3] http://code.google.com/p/http-headers-=\r\nstatus/\n[4]\nhttp://http-headers-status.googlecode.com/files/http-headers-st=\r\natus%20v3%20draft.png\n[5] http://code.google.com/p/http-headers-status/down=\r\nloads/list\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\n\n\n"}}
