Once the request is received, it is the responsbility of\n&gt; the service that recieves the request to ensure it is treated as an\n&gt; atomic update.\n\nNoted. Many of our requirements fit perfectly into the single-request\nmodel. It&#39;s just the bulk loading stuff that&#39;s a pain.\nMaybe I should provide as separate interface for that.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
