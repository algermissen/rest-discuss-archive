Existing servers, which inaccurately think they\n&gt; implement PUT correctly, will not pay attention to the proposed\n&gt; &quot;discovery mechanism&quot;, or the new Content-Range specifier, and\n&gt; overwrite entire files with partial data. Sucks for sure, I agree.\nBy discovery mechanism, I&#39;m imagining that a server would respond to an \noriginal GET (which you have to do anyway to get the original bits) with \nsome additional headers such as Put-Ranges-Mime-Types-Accepted: \ntext/xml.  A server which is returning this sort of metadata yet is \nignoring Content-Range: is simply being perverse.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I suspect all of these solutions will likely be using HTTPS anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; You wrote &quot;but PATCH is known to be blocked by some proxies in certain\n&gt; configurations (e.g., Squid). &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Squid can&#39;t do a thing about https traffic. A double-edged sword, for\n&gt; sure. But if everyone is using HTTPS, it&#39;s irrelevant.\n&gt;\nYup.  It&#39;s more of a theoretical concern (well, Netscalers can terminate \nhttps connections and proxy but that&#39;s about the only one I know of).\n\n\n\n"}}
