There is\na URI representing the PowerPoint document. That is the level at which\nyou can do network transactions. You can talk about individual slides\nusing pointers into the slideshow, but that isn&#39;t a protocol/networking\nissue, because it has resolved completely on the &quot;client side&quot;.\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Wait a minute, you say; if we reduce this argment to the absurd, every\n&gt; atom (and atomic particle) in the window is potentially a resource. \n\nNo. At some point you are no longer interested in sending messages to\nobjects and I would say that that&#39;s the point you stop decomposing. It\nisn&#39;t a judgement call. If you need to address something in a network\ntransaction then the thing needs a URI.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Back to SOAP (and hopefully a bit closer to reality), it&#39;s up to you as to\n&gt; what you expose in the URI interface. If you want it to be interoperable\n&gt; with applications that need to reference different subresources, that\n&gt; would indicate the use of separate URIs. You can do this in any Web\n&gt; Services environment; the only question is how much pain you have to put\n&gt; up with to give different services different URIs. \n\nCould you describe how to do this in any web service environments you\nare familiar with? Remember that an important requirement is that new\nresources will be created all of the time with no human interaction.\n\n&gt; ... If you&#39;re happy with\n&gt; the services that have to do with a car being available on the &#39;car&#39; URI,\n&gt; so be it; that&#39;s your choice, and it&#39;s just as much on the Web as the\n&gt; other ones.\n\nI think you&#39;ve missed an important distinction. If the &quot;car&quot; has a\nrepresentation that exposes all of the state of the window then yes, the\nwindow is &quot;on the Web&quot; despite the fact that it does not have its own\nURI. It can be addressed through a URI reference (e.g. URI+XPointer) But\nif you must POST a message to the car to ask *it* about the state of the\nwindow, then the window has neither a URI nor a URI refrence and it is\nnot on the Web. If you cannot reference it with a Web address then I\ndon&#39;t think it is on the Web.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
