If a rese=\r\nller authenticates they see all their customers, if we authenticate we see =\r\nall customers. But a bookmark would not be the same for each.\n\nI guess this=\r\n is somewhat covered in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/mes=\r\nsage/17714 but wanted to check if this is bad.\n\nLastly, what do you advise =\r\nhere:\n\n/api/v1/customers/{customer}/billing/invoices\n\nor\n\n/api/v1/billing/{=\r\ncustomer}/invoices - List of all bills\n\nor both?\n\nWe have partners/reseller=\r\ns too which I can&#39;t decide on:\n\n/api/v1/resellers/customers/{customer}/bill=\r\ning/invoices\n\nor does /customers change state depending on who is auth&#39;d li=\r\nke I&#39;ve asked above? What have you done for customers/billing or layouts wi=\r\nth different authorization roles?\n\nI was looking at http://wiki.alfresco.co=\r\nm/wiki/Repository_RESTful_API_Reference\n\nThanks,\n\nGavin.\n\n\n\n---------------=\r\n---------------------\n\nYahoo!
