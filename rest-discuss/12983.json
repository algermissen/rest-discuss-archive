Hence my preference for  \n&gt; PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt; But admittedly the spec is pretty vague on this (&quot;The DELETE method  \n&gt; requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the  \n&gt; request-target.&quot;). To me, this means that the resource should be GONE,  \n&gt; but YMMV.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;   \n\nI definitely think the spec leaves room for both (since a resource is \nbeing deleted and not its identifier).\n\nI don&#39;t know whether that was intentional or not - but I can&#39;t think of \na situation where allowing URIs to persist after DELETE would cause \nissues or violate the protocol.\n\n"}}
