August, 2000\n&gt; http://www.ladseb.pd.cnr.it/infor/Ontology/Papers/LADSEB02-2000.pdf\n\nIt&#39;s an interesting enough paper, but it&#39;s about unity, integrity and \npersistence of physical objects rather than identity. And that&#39;s a good \nthing, because their theory appears to be expressed in terms of \nfirst-order predicate calculus with identity initially, then later a \nsimple first-order mereology and set theory, both of which presuppose \nidentity: so if it really was supposed to be a theory of identity it&#39;d \nbe hopelessly circular. There are formal systems around which don&#39;t \ntake identity as a primitive, but, like I said, they&#39;re somewhat \nobscure.\n\nThat said, if the qualifier in RFC 2396 said something like,\n\n  A resource can be anything that is integrated (for some value of\n  &quot;integrated&quot;)\n\nit would at least be adding something non-trivial. But I&#39;d strongly \nadvise against going down that route. Integrity is a slippery enough \nconcept for physical objects (eg. it&#39;s extremely difficult to \ndistinguish is-attached-to from is-part-of without running into all \nkinds of awkward edge cases) never mind the kind of electronic \nartifacts which are RFC 2396&#39;s primary (tho&#39; maybe not exclusive) \nconcern.\n\nThere&#39;s also a brief discussion of the relation between stuffs and \nthings, but that&#39;s irrelevant here: RFC 2396 talks about things from \nthe outset, so individuation is already presupposed.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
