Or IWO, how could HTTP+JSON  \nnot be cross platform?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; it appears that putting stuff on top of curl might work.\n\ncurl/libcurl is a user agent/client connector. You need something else  \nfor the server side.\n\n&gt; anyways, i am just looking for examples to get started to do this.  \n&gt; What is the general idea and/or what works when developing the sdk  \n&gt; interface.\n\nWhat do you mean by &#39;sdk interface&#39; ?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems that as far as a sdk is concerned things are no less  \n&gt; complicated than SOAP?\n\nUmm - you can try and stick your JSON into a SOAP envelope and parse  \nthat out on the client side again. Compare that with generating and  \nparsing JSON alone. Especially doing that in C will make the  \ndifference more than obvious :-)\n\n\n&gt; I mean, you still have to support plenty of manipulation for  \n&gt; specific objects/resources.\n\nI am not sure what you mean, can you explain?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is how to abstract these resources. Is there a general  \n&gt; paradigm or design pattern that works here?\n&gt;\n\nYou might want to look at Atom/AtomPub for guidance - among other  \nthings it provides a standard way to deal with items and collections  \nof items.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
