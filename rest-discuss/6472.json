If\nthe field is NOT NULL,=\r\n then it should kick back an error.  If blanks\nare allowed, but the poperty=\r\n must be supplied, kick back an error.  If\nit may be blank and does not nee=\r\nd to be specified, it can consume the\nrequest happily. \n\nThe problem is, if=\r\n a framework will happily parse the body of a\n&quot;content-type: application/x-=\r\nwww-form-urlencoded&quot; POST, but not a PUT\nthen it isn&#39;t really consistant.  =\r\nIt should parse it for all, or for none.\n\nIn any case, I think we both agre=\r\ne that there is no harm in any\nframework from processing application/x-www-=\r\nform-urlencoded bodies to\nfill in any form of request.form(&quot;name&quot;) or form[=\r\n&#39;name&#39;] collections.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n"}}
