The phrase I used was:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;... could be equally as valid ...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; as an educational tool to change the mindset of the audience \n&gt; from REST == CRUD and URI-space == Database tables.\n\nAnd to be clear, I was in no way trying to imply that you were advocating\nobtuseness in URL space. But I do know that many people interpret such\nstatements as an advocacy for obtuseness and over time it becomes dogma\namong some people. I was just making the point that anyone reading what you\nsay who might interpret it as advocacy would be mistaken. Again, I&#39;ll quote\nthe same URL [1] that (hopefully) should make my point even clearer. :-)\n\n[1] http://archive.salon.com/comics/boll/2007/01/11/boll/index.html\n\n&gt; There isn&#39;t much talk about Content Negotiation on the list, \n&gt; but I don&#39;t think that REST is complete without it. Or at \n&gt; least bcomes a pale shadow of itself.\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; REST shouldn&#39;t advocate the use of a single MIME type either \n&gt; - otherwise we will end up repeating the WS-* world, where \n&gt; everyting is a SOAP message, and the SOAP spec becomes ever \n&gt; more convoluted.\n\nI think I agree with you, but can you be more specific?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n\n"}}
