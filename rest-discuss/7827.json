But that doesn&#39;t feel quite right,\n&gt; almost as if I&#39;m abusing POST.\n\nMy simple rule of thumb is this:\n* If you are replacing information, you are PUTting\n* If you are adding information, you are POSTing\n* If you are removing information, you are DELETE-ing\n* If you are retrieving information, you are GETting\n\nSo now the question becomes: What is the url of the information you are\nreplacing, adding, removing, or retrieving?\n\nFor batch jobs determining this url can be hard. If you are finding it\nhard, perhaps REST is not the right tool for the job here... or perhaps\nyou have couched the problem in terms that made sense for a non-REST\nsystem that now need to be rethought.\n\nFor example, why are you doing these things in batches? Could your\nclients pipeline requests instead and transfer the same requests in the\nsame amount of time as a batch request? Could they simply retry requests\nthey didn&#39;t get a response on, instead of unnecessarily treating the\nbatch like a transaction?\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
