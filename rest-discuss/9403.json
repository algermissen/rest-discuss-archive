I fail to see how you can claim idempotence with\n&gt;this setup.  I think that&#39;s what all this comes down to.  In the system\n&gt;you are describing, 2 deletes to the exact same resource URI do two\n&gt;different things.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Methods can also have the property of &quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside\n&gt;   from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical\n&gt;   requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,\n&gt;   PUT and DELETE share this property.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the end you don&#39;t have to listen to anyone.  You are free to do as\n&gt;you wish.  Obviously there are those that disagree with your view of\n&gt;things.  It is of course your prerogative to decide who is in error.\n&gt;\n\nI have no problem discussing the issue, within the confines of my own \nexample.  I see your point, but I define &quot;identical request&quot; to mean \na combination of factors being identical.  For instance, issuing a \nDELETE request to one of my 410 Gone resources will result in a 400 \nBad Request result every single time that identical request is \nrepeated.  However, if you add a conditional If-Match to that DELETE \nrequest, in other words after you&#39;ve *modified* the request from before, \nyou get a different result.\n\nWhere you say, &quot;2 deletes to the exact same resource URI do two different \nthings&quot; I hope you understand my response is that the the 2 deletes in \nquestion are not identical requests to the exact same URI, just as a \nconditional GET request to a resource is not identical to an unconditional \nGET request to the same resource -- only one kind of GET is allowed to \nrespond 304.  The standard says identical _request_ not identical _method_.\n\nTake any everyday not-anything-to-do-with-me DELETE usage.  The first \ntime a resource is DELETEd, a 2xx response is issued.  The next time \nthat identical resource is DELETEd, a 4xx response is issued.  The \ntime after that, and every other N &gt; _1_ time the identical request \nis repeated there&#39;s a 4xx response.  The reason this is still \nidempotent under the N &gt; 0 rule is because of the exception to that \nrule, in parentheses, which says &quot;aside from error... issues&quot; in \nother words, 4xx responses aren&#39;t counted.\n\nI suggest that for DELETE, N = 1 should be the rule, because frankly \nif, after I&#39;ve DELETEd a resource (in an everyday, nothing-to-do-with-\nme sense) I repeat the identical request and get a 2xx success response \nevery time, I will be left wondering what was successfully DELETEd the \nfirst time, if anyone follows what I&#39;m saying.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
