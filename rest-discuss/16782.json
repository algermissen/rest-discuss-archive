Anything Py=\r\nthon works as far as I&#39;m concerned.. :-)\n\nSmall thing I&#39;d say (which will p=\r\nrobably trigger a mega-thread) is that you&#39;re making a bit of a jump from t=\r\nhis description of the Hypermedia Constraint:\n\n&quot;&quot;\nThe application state is =\r\ncontrolled and stored by the user agent and can be composed of representati=\r\nons from multiple servers. In addition to freeing the server from the scala=\r\nbility problems of storing state, this allows the user to directly manipula=\r\nte the state (e.g., a Web browser&#39;s history), anticipate changes to that st=\r\nate (e.g., link maps and prefetching of representations), and jump from one=\r\n application to another (e.g., bookmarks and URI-entry dialogs). The model =\r\napplication is therefore an engine that moves from one state to the next by=\r\n examining and choosing from among the alternative state transitions in the=\r\n current set of representations. \n&quot;&quot;\n\nTo this:\n\n&quot;&quot;\nUse uniform state & stat=\r\ne transitions -- Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS):\n =\r\n   * Representations must uniformly capture the current state of an identif=\r\nied resource.  That state is the current application state.  If our RESTful=\r\n web app is a state machine, the current representation is the current stat=\r\ne.\n    * Representations may contain uniform links to subsequent applicatio=\r\nn states.  These links are the state transitions of our state machine.\n&quot;&quot;\n\n=\r\nTo me, Roy seems to be getting at more of a gestalt of application state. Y=\r\nou can&#39;t map the current sampled state of a single resource directly into t=\r\nhe whole current application state. And Roy doesn&#39;t mention state machines.=\r\n There is no one current representation making up the single current applic=\r\nation state, there are potentially scores of them, present and past. So any=\r\n links are only state transitions in the sense that the overall application=\r\n state can be progressed as a whole by /fetching more stuff/, perhaps in pa=\r\nrallel.\n\nThe point is that you get decoupling because, even though the hype=\r\nrmedia constrains and guides what is available at any time, it&#39;s up to the =\r\nclient (or, perhaps, the user driving that client if it&#39;s a browser) what i=\r\nt does to explore - perhaps in parallel - the hypermedia landscape before i=\r\nt, and in what order - perhaps back to previous places on that landscape. T=\r\nhe current history, cache and rendered page (for a browser) are parts of th=\r\ne whole application state.\n\nIn other words, don&#39;t forget the back button! T=\r\nhere&#39;s not always a link for that in the hypermedia you&#39;re focusing on...!\n=\r\n\nI&#39;m sure others will chime in with their own interpretations... :-)\n\n(oh -=\r\n smaller tip: don&#39;t say &#39;HATEOAS&#39;, say &#39;Hypermedia Constraint&#39;! =3D0)\n\nDunc=\r\nan\n\n\n\n"}}
