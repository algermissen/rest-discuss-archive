The answer to your question is\nbecause objects (aka resources) are what the Web chose to center itself\nupon.  You can try and give methods URIs if you like, and perhaps you&#39;ll\nbuild something useful (I doubt it).  But it won&#39;t be REST.\n\nI&#39;m going to drop out of this now, since we&#39;ve been around it several\ntimes and you still don&#39;t appear to be getting it.
