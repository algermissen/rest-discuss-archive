There is the notion of a resource\ncapable of delivering out a variety of different representations at a single\npoint in time, that variety being the space in which content negotiation may\ntake place.\n\nThere is another issue, closer to &quot;equivalence&quot; (which causes trouble in\nother areas as well, it seems.  I PUT this representation to this URI, and\nit\nreplaces any existing representations.  That means that upon the completion\nof PUT, that resource has but one representation.\n\nBut when we say &quot;one representation&quot;, we&#39;re not also spelling out the\nrules for what would distinguish one from two.  If characters are present,\ndoes case matter?  ASCII or other?  If the representation consists of a\n&quot;bag&quot; of things, does literality force an unintended ordering on that?  And\nso on.\n\nWhen Roy says that 2616 &quot;PUT&quot; method specifies that PUT obliterates\nvariance of representation, I believe the language of 2616 reasonably\nsupports his assertion.  If he were asserting that 2616 PUT method specifies\nliterality, I&#39;d have to say that my careful readings so far can&#39;t find that.\n\nThere&#39;s another problem here, in that the great majority of web application\ndevelopers don&#39;t have access to Roy to to his email conversations, and\nso those resources don&#39;t quality as part of the standard, unfortunately.\nWe need to approach that problem with care, I think.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Chuck Hinson&quot; &lt;cmhinson@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 24, 2002 11:35 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Future proof\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I remember reading on this list (if I&#39;m not mistaken), that PUT should\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;store the document as is, and you should be able to retrieve the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;unchanged document through a GET.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reading that on this list doesn&#39;t make it true.  This is not clear in the\n&gt; &gt;language of 2616, and so I question its status as &quot;standard&quot;.  Generally,\n&gt; &gt;resources, according to REST, are functions that map time to values,\n&gt; &gt;and there are no constraints in REST saying that resource values may\n&gt; &gt;only be changed via the HTTP interface.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If someone can find, somewhere in the body of standards, clear\n&gt; &gt;language to the effect that the resource implementation is expected to\n&gt; &gt;store a PUT value in bit-literal form, and that a subsequent GET on\n&gt; &gt;a resource that has suffered a PUT at some time in its life is required\n&gt; &gt;to serve out bit-literal representations...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not quite that limiting strict.  The interpretation presented\n&gt; earlier on this list was that given no intervening operations between a\n&gt; PUT and a GET (and assuming no other mechanism changes the resource&#39;s\n&gt; state),  a GET should return the exact representation submitted by the\n&gt; immediately previous PUT.  Note, however,  that once a representation\n&gt; has been PUT, there&#39;s nothing that says the state of the resource can&#39;t\n&gt; be changed by some other means.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If someone finds that, would they please give me a pointer?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We can certainly argue about what the spec actually says vs what one or\n&gt; more of it&#39;s authors intended . However, Roy Fielding has made at least\n&gt; one statement[1] that I (and I believe others) interpret to mean what I\n&gt; stated above.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0046.html\n&gt;\n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
