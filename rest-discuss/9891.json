The \ncookie is just a convenient container for application state, which makes \nit&#39;s way to server in representations and URIs. That&#39;s a very RESTful use \nof cookies.&quot;\n\nDoes it follow that personalization can BEST be achieved by having a \ncookie that contains the user&#39;s id sit on the browser and used to \nconstruct URLs for XMLHTTPRequests (e.g., \nhttp://example.com/userdata/{user-id}) that will return data to be \ninserted into the page?\n\nNote that I do not want the user-id to be included in the url for the page \nitself (e.g. http://example.com/home). I am assuming that the login \nprocess, which can use HTTP Auth, will give the server the opportunity to \nset the cookie at the start of the login &#39;session&#39;.\n\nthoughts?\n\n-Peter Keane\n\n"}}
