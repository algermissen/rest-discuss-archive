Therefore you need\nat least an uri list.\n\n&gt; HEAD gives you the content-type which implies both the allowed POSTable \n&gt; types and the allowed query strings.\n\nSuppose that the default content-type is html, to be complient with\nbrowsers (like IE) that ask for */* (even if the purpose of your service\nis to be queried by a specific client dealing with xml).\nTherefore, the submission method is an html form, and thus the\ncontent-type is www-url-encoded. How do you then specify the names and\nthe types of the form&#39;s fields ?\n\n&gt; If the server does not support all the content-types, entities, and query \n&gt; strings implied by the content-type of the resource identified by the \n&gt; target URI, it can return the above status codes.  If the content-type of \n&gt; the target resource does not sufficiently constrain the client, choose a \n&gt; more-specific content-type.\n&gt; \n&gt; The semantic web needs is better documentation of content-types.  It does \n&gt; not need better documentation of the capabilities of particular URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
