If you think a 404 response is a resource, \nhow about,\n\n  http://this.host.does.not.exist.com/nothing-here-folks\n\nThe point at issue is whether or not we can treat resources as being \ndefined in terms of URIs ... this is a coherent view, tho&#39; not mine.\nAt the very least for that we need it to be the case that every resource \nhas a URI, and that every URI has a resource (irrespective of whether \nor not there&#39;s a server prepared to return a useful representation). \nThe possibility of unnamed resources is inconsistent with that view, \nclearly.\n\nBut the only good argument I&#39;ve seen against the claim that particular \nURIs might be empty (have no resource, not name anything, etc., etc.) \nis that there&#39;s nothing more to being a resource than having a URI and \nthat the existence of a corresponding resource is guaranteed by \ndefinition. IOW, the argument depends on the definition. But allowing \nunnamed resources means abandoning the definition, so we might as well \nbe hung for a sheep as a lamb, and allow resourceless names too.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
