Taking that thought a bit further, the real power is that\nyou can write relative algorithms to generate navigational links, which\nwork regardless of how deep in a hierarchy a page is, without caring\nabout the path; instead of parsing or calculating redundant path info,\nas is required to generate absolute URIs.  This can significantly\nreduce latency at the origin server on cache misses, etc.\n\nThis is what led me to my stub-file approach for browser-resident XSLT\nREST applications -- if the URI allocation scheme is algorithmic and\nrelative URIs are used, a significant number of stub files site-wide\nbecome identical and can share Etags.  A little logic on the server can\nbypass generating stub files for whole swathes of resources, in favor\nof serving a cached representation.  On the client, anything which\nhastens initiation of the cached, compiled transformations is a big\nuser-perceived performance win.\n\nSometimes, there are fringe REST benefits to rational URI allocation\nscheme design and relative URLs.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
