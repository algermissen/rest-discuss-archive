For example an object or a\n&gt; set of objects are likely to have several resources associated with  \n&gt; them\n&gt; that act as the network interface to these objects. I would suggest  \n&gt; that\n&gt; instead of &quot;Each Dream service (being) a resource&quot;, each dream service\n&gt; should make a set of resources available.\n\nYou&#39;re absolutely right: a service can provide as many resources as  \nits wants.  I was thinking in terms of implementation since a service  \nis instantiated, but that was wrong for this context. I&#39;ve made note  \nof it on the feedback page.\n\n&gt; * Returning a dream blueprint to users of the system doesn&#39;t read  \n&gt; to me\n&gt; as useful. If the blueprint exposure is an internal deployment\n&gt; mechanism, this is ok. The blueprint appears to be an internal  \n&gt; document\n&gt; that allows particular methods on particular resources to be mapped to\n&gt; other method invocations on internally-defined objects. This is fine,\n&gt; but should not normally be communicated to users of the interface.  \n&gt; Users\n&gt; should see published lists of URIs that meet particular  \n&gt; requirements the\n&gt; uses may have. Perhaps a cut-down form of the blueprint would be more\n&gt; appropriate than one that exposes internal classes and the like.\n\nThe blueprint is used by the framework to instantiate the service.   \nSo, the primary consumer of the blueprint is the framework.  However,  \nit&#39;s also used by /@inspect to return a HTML document about the  \nservice and its features.  This human-readable document makes it easy  \nto learn about new services and also provides additional links to  \nonline documentation.\n\n&gt; * It looks like access to HTML headers and the like may be limited.\n&gt; Where is the url returned in a POST&#39;s Location header in\n&gt; &lt;http://doc.opengarden.org/Dream_SDK/Tutorials/Address_Book&gt;?\n\nThat sample was intended for simplicity, not completeness.  The basic  \ncommunication unit is a HTTP message containing the headers and  \nbody.  Common headers such as ContentType, ContentLength, etc. are  \nexposed as properties, but arbitrary headers can also be set via the  \nHeaders[ ] property.\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
