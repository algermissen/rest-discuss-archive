Fielding wrote:\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Sometimes.  PROP* methods conflict with REST because they prevent\n&gt; important resources from having URIs and effectively double the\n&gt; number of methods for no good reason.  Both Henrik and I argued\n&gt; against those methods at the time.  It really doesn&#39;t matter\n&gt; how uniform they are because they break other aspects of the\n&gt; overall model, leading to further complications in versioning\n&gt; (WebDAV versioning is hopelessly complicated), access control\n&gt; (WebDAV ACLs are completely wrong for HTTP), and just about every\n&gt; other extension to WebDAV that has been proposed.\n\nI do agree that it would be nice if each property of a resource had it&#39;s \nURI. It&#39;s certainly possible to implement meta data that way. As far as \nI understand the records of the WebDAV working group from pre-1999, that \napproach was discussed but in the end discarded due to many *other* \nproblems it would have introduced, such as: how can I effectively obtain \nthe children + a specific meta data subset for one collection? That&#39;s \none of the most common operations a WebDAV client does, and if there&#39;s \nno efficient way to do that, there&#39;s definitively a problem.\n\nI&#39;d really like to see the protocol details for such a design, so that \nit can really be compared to what we have today.\n\nAs for the remainder, I&#39;m really not sure what you&#39;re talking about \n(more details, please). For instance, RFC3253 (Versioning) introduces \nseparate URIs for version histories and versions (basic versioning).\n\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt; The problem with MOVE is that it is actually an operation on two\n&gt; independent namespaces (the source collection and destination\n&gt; collection).  The user must have permission to remove from the\n&gt; source collection and add to the destination collection, which\n&gt; can be a bit of a problem if they are in different authentication\n&gt; realms.  COPY has a similar problem, but at least in that case\n&gt; only one namespace is modified.  I don&#39;t think either of them map\n&gt; very well to HTTP.\n&gt; ...\n\nThat seems to be a problem with the concept of moving resources around, \nnot with the actual definition of the MOVE method, right?\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
