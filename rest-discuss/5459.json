I&#39;m not responsible for inventory that comes from Amazon\nfulfillment centers. And a large portion of Amazon offer information\noriginates from fairly rich systems that send data to my services after\nrunning &#39;their&#39; business rules (which products to offer, at what price,\netc).\nMy system is mainly merchant-facing and not web-facing - data is published\nout of my system into other &#39;caching layers&#39;. \nThere are many teams that provide many services, so this isn&#39;t a complete\nstory by any means.\nBut I&#39;m hiring... \n\nThe data is submitted by external sellers and merchants through bulk feeds\nand through browser-based tools. The &quot;Sell Yours Here&quot; button is an example\nof a browser based tool. (My team doesn&#39;t do the UI, but does own the\nbusiness logic and accept/store/publish the listings). There are two\n&#39;platforms&#39; - Marketplace and Merchants. The Marketplace platform is open\nfor registration here:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/misc/sell-your-stuff.html and paying\nfor a &#39;Pro Merchant&#39; account gives access to bulk uploads. There are also\nthird-party tools and services that do this integration for you. The\nMerchants platform is invite-only (at this time) and supports more complex\nfeeds that allow for creating new products in the Amazon master catalog in\nbulk (these result in new details pages - ASINs) beyond just listing what is\nalready there.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And why do you think they did it that way?  (Assuming it was \n&gt; a reasoned design decision...)\nI don&#39;t know. I&#39;d rather not guess out loud until I talk with them.\n\n"}}
