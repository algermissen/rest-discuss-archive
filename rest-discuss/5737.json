It does strike me as rather a\ncomplex =\r\nspecification, as are its related toolsets.  I started looking\ninto REST as=\r\n an interesting alternative and am just trying to\nunderstand it.  I saw an =\r\nexample in one of the introductory\nexplanations I read. (http://www.xfront.=\r\ncom/REST-Web-Services.html) \nIt had a client program asking for part inform=\r\nation, and this is what\nthe client gets:\n\n&lt;?xml version=3D&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Parts =\r\nxmlns:p=3D&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot; \n         xmlns:xlink=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nw3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=3D&quot;00345&quot;  \n            xlink:href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=3D&quot;00346&quot; \n         =\r\n   xlink:href=3D&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00346&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=\r\n=3D&quot;00347&quot; \n            xlink:href=3D&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/0034=\r\n7&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;Part id=3D&quot;00348&quot; \n            xlink:href=3D&quot;http://www.parts-d=\r\nepot.com/parts/00348&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/p:Parts&gt;\n\n\nThe writer also says this:\n\n&quot;[Assume t=\r\nhat through content negotiation the service determined that\nthe client want=\r\ns the representation as XML (for machine-to-machine\nprocessing).] Note that=\r\n the parts list has links to get detailed info\nabout each part. This is a k=\r\ney feature of REST. The client transfers\nfrom one state to the next by exam=\r\nining and choosing from among the\nalternative URLs in the response document=\r\n.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s cool.  But I scoured the article looking for any mention of the\n=\r\nschema -- how do the clients know the structure of the xml?  You could\nhave=\r\n a reference to a schema or DTD (or whatever) in your initial\nresource page=\r\n, but I take it there is no standard way of doing this? \nWouldn&#39;t this be a=\r\n problem?  I must be missing something here...\n\nPlease enlighten, if possib=\r\nle.\n\n--Kris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
