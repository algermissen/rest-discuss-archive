I found the discussion starting at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/704 which ends up with Paul suggesting the following changes, among others:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A notification message MAY have the following headers:\n&gt; \n&gt; Watched-URI: (URI of the watched resource)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Watched-URI may be any valid URI for the resource that generated the\n&gt; notification. It need not be the original URI but it must refer to the\n&gt; same resource. If the client wants to retrieve a representation of the\n&gt; resource it SHOULD use this URI, not the original one. This will allow\n&gt; publishers to do a simple form of load balancing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the status of these changes and is the &#39;Subscription-URI: URI of the subscription object &#39;  the URI of the subscription resource returned as a &#39;Location&#39; header in the subscription response?\n&gt; \n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
