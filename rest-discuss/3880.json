FIFO? LIFO? by \nfrom-address...?  How does the shape of the container relate to your index \nformat for representing it?\n\nMoST provides enough constraints so that knowing *ONLY* your index format, \na client can deliver mail.  The client does not need to know *anything* \nabout how the server thinks about inboxes internally.\n\n&gt; so describe your format. In this description, i wanted to be unambiguous,\n&gt; but the knowledge that the /inbox/ is a container is sufficient, has I\n&gt; know that i can POST to add a content and GET to obtain the listing (and\n&gt; delete to reset the container)\n\nAgain, how does the client know that /inbox/ is a container and not simply \nan index?\n\nYour inbox format was a list of plaintext &quot;subject : uri&quot;  A few years ago, \nDJ Bernstein proposed an alternative to SMTP which made mail storage the \nsender&#39;s responsibility.  Your inbox format caused me to assume you \nintended something similar.  It implies that mail delivery is simply adding \nan entry to an index and letting the client be responsible for storing the \nmessage at some URI.\n\nHowever, if you want mail storage to be the recipient&#39;s responsibility, and \nyou want messages in MIME format, you should use a format for your inbox \nthat supports appending MIME messages e.g. mbox or multipart/digest.\n\nNote that simply by defining your file formats correctly you can completely \ncontrol the semantics of your application!\n\nAlso note that whether the server STORES the messages in these format is \nTOTALLY IRRELEVANT.  The point is only that by exposing the resource using \nthis content-type, it is saying that the resource can be manipulated as if \nin fact it is represented on the server in that content type.
