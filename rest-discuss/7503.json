If you \n&gt; don&#39;t have canonical URIs, then you need not jolt the user by \n&gt; that redirect at the end, which may be a usability plus, but \n&gt; you may make it harder to find the page via search engines, \n&gt; which is a usability minus (and probably a business minus for \n&gt; your website).  \n\nWell, I want to explore why it is harder for search engines to find that\npage. And can we change that?  Or consider the problem from a different\nperspective?  Google tweaks their algorithms quarterly.  Why could they not\ninclude an update given new guidance?  The rest would follow.    \n\n&gt; It is also a caching minus, because the cache \n&gt; won&#39;t know it already has something that came via a different \n&gt; URI. That can be a usability minus in the form of slower \n&gt; perceived response time, and a business minus in terms of \n&gt; higher bandwidth costs. \n\nAgain, I&#39;d like to explore why that is and see if there are not new ways to\nlook at the problem.\n\n&gt; As a result, I&#39;d probably lean \n&gt; towards having canonical URIs.\n\nAs you state, it is a tradeoff.  But in my research I&#39;m seeing too many\nbenefits to ignore so I&#39;m motivated to come up with any alternate approach\nwith less trade offs.  BTW, it&#39;s hard to convey the full depth and breadth\nof what I&#39;ve learn because I haven&#39;t finished my research. I know\nintuitively but am not ready to make the full case on paper. I think it was\nmy mistake to give you the courtsey of an explanation before I was prepared\nbecause you&#39;ve now gone away unconvinced and (by human nature) are less\nlikely to reconsider the issue when I publish.  FWIW.  (But at least you\nwere respectful about it. :) \n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
