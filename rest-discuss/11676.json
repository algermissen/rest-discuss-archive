Any discussions that head off =\r\ninto minutiae can be pushed over \n&gt; into this group for more in-depth discu=\r\nssion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; http://twitter.com/adean\n=\r\n&gt;\n\nYeah, as you know from our twitter discussions I think this would be a\nv=\r\nery useful idea. \n\nAt the moment getting your head around REST is quite dif=\r\nficult (few\nenough good resources out there) and I&#39;m not sure that this for=\r\num is\nhelping me learn REST as much as I&#39;d have expected. \n\nSo yeah a secon=\r\nd forum seems a great idea.\n\n- Colin\n\n\n"}}
