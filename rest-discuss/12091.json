A fixed URL scheme is essentially\nthe same as baking the first representation into each client.\n\nIs that surprising?\n\nLikewise, a RESTful system is always going to be less efficient\nthan a system designed for a static set of clients accessing\na small set of services that never change.\n\nA lot of people think of systems as static things.  Dead things.\nREST is not going to appeal to those people.  All of its constraints\nare designed to keep systems living longer than we are willing\nor able to anticipate.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
