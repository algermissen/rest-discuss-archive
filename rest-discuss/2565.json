One is &quot;I want to save \n&gt; bandwidth \n&gt; and only send a diff of what&#39;s changed since yesterday.&quot; I think we \n&gt; could argue that both PUT and GET should allow this and in \n&gt; fact there is \n&gt; an unfinished proposal floating around. This is still appropriate for \n&gt; PUT because it is just an optimization of sending the whole resource. \n&gt; It&#39;s a conceptual overwrite that happens to be optimized.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second issue is: &quot;I know I want to change a particular element. I \n&gt; don&#39;t know or care about the state of other surrounding elements.&quot; \n&gt; That&#39;s where you use POST because it is a conceptual mutation and \n&gt; optimization is irrelevant.\n\nEven squinting hard I just can&#39;t seem to find the difference between\nthese.  In both cases we are only concerned with a discrete subset of the\nresource&#39;s state, for whatever reason.  I think your analysis below\nthat says PUT is like COPY while POST is like invoking a program makes\nmore sense.  If I want to COPY over all or part of resource state, I\nuse PUT (no matter what I think of this in terms of optimization), and\nif I want a program to take control of applying some new information\nto an old resource, then I use POST.  Understood that the server will\ndo as it please in either case, but in the COPY mode, the client is\nrequesting a specific limited overlay behavior, while in the PROGRAM\nmode, it is saying &quot;you decide what to do with this&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; I disagree. If anything, I would go in the opposite \n&gt; direction. I would \n&gt; say that POST has too many meanings (sometimes it mutates a resource, \n&gt; sometimes it totally overwrites it, sometimes it creates a resource, \n&gt; sometimes it even has no side-effects at all). It is better to split \n&gt; these out into independent methods so that you know exactly what is \n&gt; going to happen when you invoke a method on a server. PUT is a little \n&gt; like &quot;copy&quot; on a command line. You know that after you invoke it what \n&gt; you will end up with. POST is more like invoking a program. \n&gt; What happens \n&gt; depends on the program.\n[snip]\n\n&gt; Uniformity of interface is very important. Simplicity is much less \n&gt; important. I wouldn&#39;t mind an HTTP with 15 methods. As long as every \n&gt; HTTP client and server in the world understood those 15 methods, and \n&gt; every resource had a reasonable answer for every one of them, \n&gt; that would \n&gt; be a &quot;uniform interface&quot;. The point is that clients and \n&gt; servers should \n&gt; not have to negotiate the meaning of the interfaces out of \n&gt; band. But we \n&gt; often DO have to negotiate the meaning of POST. So to me, \n&gt; more methods \n&gt; would do a better job of living up to the potential of REST, \n&gt; rather than \n&gt; fewer. (for instance I would love to see WATCH, NOTIFY, etc.)\n\nI agree with this, and would like to echo from a paragraph or two\nabove that methods that intend to create new resources would be\na nice improvement.  Right now, creation is implicit through both\nPUT and POST.*  There is still the argument that the server knows\nbest how to manage its information base, but that doesn&#39;t invalidate\nthe idea that clients should be able to express the HINT that\nthey would like resources created.\n\n* Creation is implicit on the request side, while it&#39;s supposed\nto be explicit on the result side, via 302 Created.  Above, I&#39;m\ntalking about the request side.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
