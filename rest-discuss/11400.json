The few occasions I did this,\n&gt;      &gt; stuff was removed through some backend logic (i.e. not via the\n&gt;     RESTful\n&gt;      &gt; interface) or never removed at all.\n&gt; \n&gt;     It&#39;s worth digging into. This is an area (along with partial updates)\n&gt;     where I&#39;m prone to sympathizing with the RPC crowd*, as in, it tends to\n&gt;     require a pattern or an idiom. On that basis you can argue that there is\n&gt;     a capability than people need - the ability to relate resources. How to\n&gt;     do this is not evident when I look at REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say I want to label this email &quot;interesting&quot;.  My Web-based email \n&gt; client has actions for creating these associations (email and label), \n&gt; deleting existing associations, and links to retrieve the associated \n&gt; collection (i.e. all emails belonging to a label).\n&gt; \n&gt; I would post the id, not the URL, of the resource that I&#39;m enlisting \n&gt; with the collection, and likewise post to remove it, using different \n&gt; target URLs for these two actions.  That&#39;s a pattern and it restricts \n&gt; itself to REST.  \n\nThat&#39;s two remote procedure calls, no? I have used that pattern for \ntagging. An alternative is to state the relationship using a content \ntype. In OO terms, this is the &#39;marriage problem&#39; - namely where does \nthe act of marriage belong in an object oriented system?\n\n\n&gt; So I&#39;m thinking what&#39;s missing is not the way to do it, \n&gt; but the way to indicate that a bunch of actions and links returned from \n&gt; a resource signify &quot;add/remove from designated collection&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Add semantics to the content?  Service description language?\n\nAt the level of architecture it makes no odds - REST has nothing useful \nto say. I suspect this is why TBL champions technology like RDF, which \nformally defines resource relationships. [REST had nothing useful to say \nabout iterators either but that didn&#39;t stop us defining the incredibly \nuseful RSS/Atom, and later on, layering AtomPub onto HTTP.]\n\nBill\n\n"}}
