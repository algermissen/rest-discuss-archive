There isn&#39;t actually a single REST API, just like there \nisn&#39;t a single object-oriented API, or single client-server API or a \nsingle &quot;agile&quot; API.\n\nREST is an architectural style. As such it informs us of a way of doing \nthings, rather than defining an API to code against.\n\nThe web is one example of a system that uses the REST style. Because the \nweb uses the REST style, applications that work with the web are \narguably (certainly most people on this list would so argue) advised to \nmake use of it.\n\n\n"}}
