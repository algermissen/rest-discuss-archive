For each request, the caller gives the system a  \nnamespace tag, and the system gives back the next number for that  \nnamespace.\n\nSo,\n\n        --&gt;  GET /numbers/FOO/next\n1    &lt;--\n\n       --&gt; GET /numbers/FOO/next\n2    &lt;--\n\n       --&gt; GET /numbers/BAR/next\n1   &lt;--\n\nThat seems really wrong -- GET should be idempotent, and these  \nrequests clearly are not. But, I&#39;m also clearly getting, fetching, a  \nvalue.\n\nHow would you implement this interface?\n\nA similar question to this was asked regarding throwing Dice:\n\thttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7768\n\nThe dice discussion wandered a bit, but the most substantive  \nsuggestion seemed to be:\n\tUse GET\n\tReturn a 302 status and a Location: header, representing the  \nnumerical result as a URL\n\tInclude the numerical result in the body of the response\n\nIs there any consensus on this model? I&#39;m still concerned about the  \nuse of GET, and the use of the Location: header seems superfluous.\n\neric.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
