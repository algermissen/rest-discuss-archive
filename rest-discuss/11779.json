Here&#39;s what I wrote back then [1].\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly, after a presentation I gave yesterday, somebody\n&gt;&gt; suggested something very similar; Paul Fremantle, who happened to be\n&gt;&gt; there, and myself still believe this would be worth pursuing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A while back, Sanjiva Weerawarana proposed (via email) a way to\n&gt;&gt; decentralize media types. I think the proposal was excellent; Dan\n&gt;&gt; Diephouse�s excellent latest blog post [2] reminded me of it again.\n&gt;&gt; Here�s a brief introduction to a possible solution for �decentralizing\n&gt;&gt; media types�.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Problem\n&gt;&gt; In a plain HTTP interaction, the Content-type and Accept headers carry\n&gt;&gt; information about the type of the data being transmitted and accepted,\n&gt;&gt; respectively. You�ve seen these media types in numerous examples, e.g.\n&gt;&gt; a typical request or response might have a Content-type header with\n&gt;&gt; the value application/xml.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem with this approach is that media types have to be\n&gt;&gt; registered centrally with IANA. This means that while you can invent\n&gt;&gt; your own media types, nobody will know about them � unless you go\n&gt;&gt; through the time-consuming process of actually having your media type\n&gt;&gt; registered.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What�s wrong with application/xml? Nothing, really, except that it\n&gt;&gt; doesn�t tell you anything more than that what is being sent is XML:\n&gt;&gt; You don�t have any way to tell what XML it is unless you actually\n&gt;&gt; parse and e.g. look at the outer element�s XML namespace.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Solution\n&gt;&gt; What Sanjiva (and his collaborators, Paul Fremantle, Jonathan Marsh\n&gt;&gt; and James Clark) propose is this: Define a single new media type,\n&gt;&gt; application/data-format, with a required parameter uri. This uri\n&gt;&gt; points to a definition of the data format, like this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; application/data-format;uri=http://mediatypes.example.com/foo/bar\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The uri is an HTTP URI that points to an RDDL document, in other\n&gt;&gt; words: you can do an HTTP GET on it and retrieve a documentation of\n&gt;&gt; the data format that�s both human-readbable as well as machine-\n&gt;&gt; processable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My Opinion\n&gt;&gt; I think this is an excellent proposal, specifically because it does\n&gt;&gt; not rely on a centralized authority, and re-uses the namespacing\n&gt;&gt; concepts of the Web. It�s also fully agnostic towards any specific\n&gt;&gt; data format � you can use your own binary or text format, something\n&gt;&gt; like JSON or YAML, and if you pick XML, you�re free to use DTDs, RELAX\n&gt;&gt; NG schemas, Schematron or even XML Schema to document it. It�s also\n&gt;&gt; great in that it allows for clients with different knowledge about any\n&gt;&gt; particular format to do their best to handle it. One client might be\n&gt;&gt; hard-coded against the complete string; another might retrieve the\n&gt;&gt; RDDL, look for an XSD, and dynamically render some fancy visual\n&gt;&gt; representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think the concept could even be extended to allow for querying of\n&gt;&gt; supported media types: You could just do a GET on the resource with an\n&gt;&gt; accept header of application/data-format and get back the link to the\n&gt;&gt; RDDL (if there is any).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maybe there�s something immediately, obviously wrong with this idea �\n&gt;&gt; but if so, I can�t see it. It will be interesting to see what others\n&gt;&gt; say �\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2008/02/decentralizing_media_types.html\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [2] http://netzooid.com/blog/2008/02/07/why-a-restful-idl-is-an-oxymoron-and-what-we-really-need-instead/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Stefan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 11.12.2008, at 15:49, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a need in one of my projects to query for different XML schema\n&gt;&gt;&gt; documents from my RESTful service. Looking around the internet it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed that the de facto way of doing this would be:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; application/vnd.myformat+xml\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Or, just register &quot;myformat&quot; with IANA and have:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; application/myformat+xml\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One huge downside of this though is that my browser does not know\n&gt;&gt;&gt; how to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; render application/myformat+xml. So, my question to this list is, why\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t MIME properties used to identify XML schema? For example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; application/xml; schema=http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I tried this approach with Firefox and Safari and both browser ignore\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the attribute and render the document as XML.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Would there be any reason NOT to use and promote this approach other\n&gt;&gt;&gt; than it goes against current de facto convention? I blogged about  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a few months ago and have yet to receive a logical reason why this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; approach isn&#39;t superior:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com/2008/03/05/restful-xml-content-negotitation/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt;&gt;&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
