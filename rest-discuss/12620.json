The problem is that there are\n&gt; too many potential recipients. Say the user starts dragging a Best Actor\n&gt; in a Leading Role award. There are literally thousands of potential\n&gt; recipients and the choice is only restricted by what the client is\n&gt; currently displaying to the user. Thus, the client needs a way to ask\n&gt; the server which of these candidates really are hopefuls.\n&gt;\n\nSo create a hierarchy.  The first representation returned could have\n10 categories of recipients.  You render those categories on the\nclient and, as the client hovers over the category, you do another\nrequest and drill down into that category and render the results.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how at this point how the problem is any different that\nwith a regular fat client.\n\nDarrel\n\n"}}
