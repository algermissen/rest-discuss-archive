Even that&#39;s\noversimplifying in that part of the reason POST is wrong here, is\nbecause DELETE is right.  But, no, I do not believe setting up an URL to\nlisten for POST and taking action not based on anything in the POST\nrequest, is ever an example of the REST style, regardless of the nature\nof the resource.\n\nMy real short answer is, &quot;POST /cancel doesn&#39;t use REST&#39;s uniform\ninterface.&quot;\n\nNeither is it an example of the REST style for POST to have a definition\nwhich varies by resource, iow sometimes it works without an entity\n(method-tunnel listener), sometimes it doesn&#39;t (create resource); even\nif hypertext-driven, such nonstandard method usage inevitably results\nin coupling between client and server, instead of relying on shared\nunderstanding of standardized method semantics.  Fixing the POST to have\nan entity that&#39;s ignored might make it valid HTTP and solve this, but it\nstill wouldn&#39;t be an example of the REST style, where the requested\nstate change is transferred in the entity (with a few exceptions) -- not\ndefined per resource by the method being tunneled through / triggered by\nPOST.\n\nConceptually, it still violates the identification of resources\nconstraint, which is why it isn&#39;t visible regardless of how we implement\nit in terms of hypertext or method selection.  Using the uniform\ninterface means refactoring internal methods like &#39;cancel&#39; to fit the\nresource/representation model of REST such that the request methods and\nresponse codes used map generically to those of your chosen protocol.\nAssigning them URIs to toggle with semantically-void messages is simply\nsome other style not encompassed by REST&#39;s uniform interface constraint,\nnot something that&#39;s superficially fixable by improving visibility or\nadding a 200 OK response.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Never thought about HTTP/URI resource vs. REST resource, you say that\n&gt; a URI that doesn&#39;t implement GET is probably (or always) not REST.\n&gt;\n\nMore like, &quot;REST resources are concepts, not actions.&quot;  Just using URIs\ndoesn&#39;t bestow compliance with the identification of resources\nconstraint upon a system, it&#39;s more nuanced than that.  I can&#39;t imagine\nwhy a bona-fide REST resource would ever deliberately fail to have a\nretrieval mapping, no.\n\nI think the more important takeaway is method selection.  We have DELETE\nin order to avoid such convoluted POST-based cancel mechanisms.  It\nisn&#39;t RESTful to use POST when another method&#39;s semantics happen to\nclosely describe user intent.  From Roy&#39;s blog:\n\n&quot;POST only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which\nsome other method is ideally suited: e.g., retrieval of information\nthat should be a representation of some resource (GET), complete\nreplacement of a representation (PUT), or any of the other standardized\nmethods that tell intermediaries something more valuable than &#39;this may\nchange something.&#39; The other methods are more valuable to\nintermediaries because they say something about how failures can be\nautomatically handled and how intermediate caches can optimize their\nbehavior. POST does not have those characteristics, but that doesn&#39;t\nmean we can live without it. POST serves many useful purposes in HTTP,\nincluding the general purpose of &#39;this action isn&#39;t worth\nstandardizing.&#39;&quot;\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post\n\nSince DELETE is inherently self-descriptive of user intent to cancel an\norder, and is already &quot;listened for&quot; rather than requiring an entity be\ntransferred, and has inherent idempotency matching the inherently\nidempotent user intent captured by a cancel request, DELETE must be the\nproper method for implementation using HTTP.\n\nNow, maybe your media type doesn&#39;t support DELETE, in which case\ncontriving a /cancel URI may very well be called for until such time\nas it does.  I won&#39;t fault anyone for doing this out of pragmatism, so\nlong as they understand it as a mismatch, inconsistent with the\narchitectural style they&#39;re following.\n\nREST is a tool which allows you, over time, to make improvements to the\narchitecture you have in accordance with an idealized model.  To me,\naccepting mismatches for what they are, is far more useful than coming\nup with convoluted explanations for why they aren&#39;t, for the sake of\nbuzzword compliance.  Change is easier when it&#39;s based on having been\nright all along, rather than based on having to admit error.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
