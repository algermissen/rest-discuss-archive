It&#39;s secure in the sense of confidential - 3rd pa=\r\nrties cannot  \n(easily) eavesdrop the conversation. There are 3 primary are=\r\nas of  \nsecurity:\n\n1. authentication - determining the user is who they say=\r\n they are\n2. authorisation - determining whether they have the right to per=\r\nform  \nthe action they want to perform\n3. confidentiality - assuring that u=\r\nnauthorised parties do not have  \naccess to the communication\n\nIn your exam=\r\nple, confidentiality is assured by the use of HTTPS, and  \nauthentication i=\r\ns via HTTP Basic. You could use SSL client  \ncertificates instead to perfor=\r\nm authentication if you wanted to,  \nwhich would make the credentials more =\r\ndifficult to forge.\n-- \n=E7=8A=AC Chris Burdess\n   &quot;They that can give up e=\r\nssential liberty to obtain a little safety\n   deserve neither liberty nor s=\r\nafety.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-5-81224994\r\ncontent-type: application/pgp-signature; x-mac-type=70674453;\n\tname=PGP.sig\r\ncontent-description: This is a digitally signed message part\r\ncontent-disposition: inline; filename=PGP.sig\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Apple-Mail-5-81224994--\r\n\n"}}
