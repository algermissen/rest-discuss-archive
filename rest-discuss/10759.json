There is some bulk operation in WebDAV, which then requires the\n&gt; notion of partial failure to come back in the response; a simple\n&gt; single error code is no longer enough\n\nExactly, that is why I compared this to SOAP.\n\n&gt; 2. WS-ResourceFramework, while near the pinnacle of WS-*, tried to\n&gt; retrofit bulk operations to its resource-model-atop-SOAP world view,\n&gt; and again, got into a mess about atomicity of updates as well as\n&gt; failures. What I dont like about it (apart from it being the pinnacle\n&gt; of WS-*) is that there was no per-resource metadata about the\n&gt; atomicity, and no guarantee that all servers worked the same.\n&gt;\n\n:)\n\n&gt; the nice thing about doing bulk operations as a sequence of requests\n&gt; is that you can be sure that\n&gt; -the bulk operation is not atomic\n&gt; -if one operation fails, everything you havent yet pushed out wont\n&gt; have gone through\n&gt; -state changes are observable to others during the sequence of  \n&gt; operations.\n&gt; -the single update code path==the bulk update code path\n&gt; It may not be the exact behaviour you want, but at least you can be\n&gt; sure that it will be consistent, that no server updates will suddenly\n&gt; change their behaviour without you noticing. Which is good, as it is\n&gt; surprisingly hard to write tests to determine exactly what the bulk\n&gt; update semantics of a remote system are.\n\nWell said.\n\nSubbu\n\n\n"}}
