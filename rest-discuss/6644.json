I tried to indicate that you control the semantics of PUTting\nto the resource, so you can define the PUT to update only the name,\nand similar properties. Ordinarily, though, if you had some other\n&quot;flat&quot; properties like date, comments, etc., then to modify the date\nyou would typically send over a whole representation of the resource\nthat has those other properties as well.\n\nMy previous message was just pointing out that you are in control, so\nyou would probably NOT want to permit modifying the collection\ncontents this way. I guess I made an assumption that the fleet\nrepresentation would enumerate the vehicles, but I see now that&#39;s not\nthe case. So you can ignore that bit about what to do with the\nvehicles when updating the fleet, if you don&#39;t make the vehicles, or a\nreference to them, part of the representation of a fleet.\n\nHowever, typically, a representation of a collection would contain\nlinks, either directly or indirectly, to the members. If you don&#39;t do\nthat, then it sounds like you are contemplating &quot;constructed&quot; URIs, so\nthat clients would have to understand how to construct a URI  given a\nfleet id and vehicle id. You probably don&#39;t want to do that. It&#39;s more\nrobust and restlike to follow hyperlinks embedded in each\nrepresentation yoyu get from the server. That&#39;s why I assumed you had\na link to the vehicles in a fleet&#39;s representation. This way all the\nstate of the app is contained in the hypertext document the client\nlast obtained. You can prbly think of other ways to do that. But you\nwill want to stay away from constructing URIs in this case I believe.\n\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
