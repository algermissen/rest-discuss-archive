My initial response was in the\ncontext of building a ReSTful interface on top of CQS, not how to carry CQS\nto the client. Here, the client is the ReST interface. \n\n&gt; A huge part of CQS is carrying forward the context of the original\n&gt; operation while you try really hard to ignore the context. Even if you\n&gt; do something like documents (hoping to the source events at the\n&gt; server) this will only work in extremely naive circumstances.\n\nAs far as the ReST interface presented to the client is concerned, creating\nnew resources where different contexts exist makes most circumstances very\nnaive, on purpose.\n\n&gt; the client knows what operations are actually supported (it being the\n&gt; messages contain data as well wouldn&#39;t it still need to know about\n&gt; them?)?\n\n&gt; it is the one that represents the behaviors the two are\n&gt; conceptually coupled. the only time they are not is when you do not\n&gt; have a behavior oriented UI (i.e. they are data oriented). using cqs\n&gt; your interface should be behavior oriented (not data oriented).\n\nI think we may have a misunderstanding. The client to the ReST interface\nshould be document-oriented to be a consumer of a ReST architecture. Context\nis only provided through the server assigning new resources and new URIs,\nthe client should have no knowledge of this.\n\nA good ReST client has local state (the cache) it uses to navigate links\ncreated by the server (who owns and retains the context in which it created\na resource), and only knows how to operate on the documents it has received\nor wishes to create. In that sense, a good ReST client is data-centric, as\nmuch as an ATOM blog client or a web browser is data-centric. There is\ninherently no behaviour defined beyond what the data and interaction model\nthe media type defines.\n\nIn this discussion, I assume the ReST interface operates as the client to a\nCQS model, and the UA operates as a client to the ReST interface. Anything\nthat blurs those lines would hurt both models.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
