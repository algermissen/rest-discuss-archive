I did send a follow-up last week but I think\nI mistakenly sent it direct to Mike.\n\nHaving given it some more thought I think what this boils down to is\nme trying to remove the whole URL scheme from the &#39;client&#39; (by client\nI&#39;m talking specifically of the business code that the developers will\nbe writing) and create an object broker to act like an OR mapper but\nin this case it&#39;s an object-resource (representation) mapper.\n\nHas anyone done or considered anything similar? Or am I trying to put\na square peg in a round hole?\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;S. Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@h...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me some pointers as to how a REST client might be\n&gt; &gt; implemented in an OO language.\n&gt; &gt; To my mind there are two elements:\n&gt; &gt; 1) a collection of serializable classes which represent the resources\n&gt; Do you intend to transfer this serialized object to/from the resource?\n&gt; Or do you just mean an object instance for each identified resource?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) a class which maps a given resource type to an URL\n&gt; What&#39;s a &#39;resource type&#39;? Do you mean a class like StreetMap, and it\nwould\n&gt; have a &#39;constructURI&#39; method that accepted an arbitrary set of\nparameters?\n&gt; Or maybe a strongly typed &#39;constructURI&#39; method like:\n&gt; class StreetMap\n&gt; {\n&gt;     String constructURI(String country,String state, String street);\n&gt;     String constructURI(String latitude, String longitude);\n&gt;     String constructURI(String dunsIdentifier);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is an example on the web (http://ociweb.com/jnb/jnbNov2004.html)\n&gt; &gt; which works along these lines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However I have a few issues with this approach:\n&gt; &gt; 1)Is it valid to map a resource type to a single URL or in practice\n&gt; &gt; would multiple URLs handle the same resource type?\n&gt; If &#39;resource type&#39; is something like &#39;Employee&#39; or &#39;StreetMap&#39; or\n&#39;Product&#39;,\n&gt; then multiple URIs would be used - one URI for each instance of that\n&gt; resource type. For example, each of these resources are of type\n&#39;Product&#39;\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B00003CXCT\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B0000AQS0F\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0940183218\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) How could non-trivial GETs be specified? The example only shows\n&gt; &gt; GETs with a single valued key, but what about &#39;searches&#39; on several\n&gt; &gt; non-key elements.\n&gt; You would just add those into the resource identifier - either as path\n&gt; segments or as query terms.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What about searches using values of parent elements\n&gt; &gt; (in the example the &#39;owner&#39; is effectively a parent value but it has\n&gt; &gt; been included in the child thereby circumventing this problem but I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think that scales where you have deep hierarchies).\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Is there an application here for using &quot;hypermedia as the engine of\n&gt; &gt; application state&quot;. Should there be a single entry point into the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;application&#39; and that then returns a list of valid links that can be\n&gt; &gt; called. This is the area of REST that I struggle with most and judging\n&gt; &gt; by the large number of articles that focus on resource exposure and\n&gt; &gt; addressing and the tiny number that cover this aspect of REST I guess\n&gt; &gt; other people do to.\n&gt; Yes, my opinion is that this works for small scale lists (1-10K\nelements),\n&gt; but larger ones may need &#39;chunking&#39; via something like &#39;next&#39; and &#39;prev&#39;\n&gt; links in each resource representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My approach is built on trying to keep the uniform interface within\n&gt; &gt; the OO client via the use of ResourceManager class which contains the\n&gt; &gt; 4 CRUD operations and maps the resource types (specified by the class\n&gt; &gt; types) to URLs but perhaps that&#39;s not &#39;right&#39;. We are talking about an\n&gt; &gt; OO client so maybe it is valid to wrap the REST interface into a SOAP\n&gt; &gt; style GetCollectionByOwner() interface even if it &#39;feels&#39; wrong.\n&gt; There&#39;s nothing wrong with a GetCollectionByOwner() utility method\nwithin\n&gt; your client - but you&#39;ll end up with multiple implementations if you\nneed to\n&gt; integrate with multiple providers. This will lead you to standardize\non a\n&gt; &#39;resource description language&#39; in order to construct the URIs\nspecific to\n&gt; each provider. Or, you may look into using the &#39;hypermedia&#39; approach\nwhich\n&gt; has a &#39;GetCollections&#39; utility method that returns a list of indivual\n&gt; Collection elements with an Owner attribute.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
