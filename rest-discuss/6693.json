If you have not read the \ncontributions to the current thread of discussion, please do so before \nevaluating or describing my position.\n\n&gt; Constructing URIs is absolutely allowed.\n\nSometimes, as when a human constructs a URI, REST has no bearing on the \nconstruction of the URI.\n\nSometimes, as when software relies on hypermedia to inform and restrict \nthe construction of a URI, REST permits the construction of the URI.\n\nSometimes, as when software relies on resource representations to inform \nthe construction of a URI and those resource representations are not \nhypermedia, REST forbids the construction of the URI.\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s an authoritative document:\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31.html\n\nThat document is (or will soon be) authoritative over Web architecture, \nbut it is not authoritative over REST.\n\nThe document that is authoritative over REST is “Architectural Styles \nand the Design of Network-based Software Architectures” \n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm&gt; as a start).\n\n-- \nPlease do not copy replies to me.
