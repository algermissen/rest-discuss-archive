It\n&gt; was more a matter of unlearning preconceptions, which is why debates\n&gt; worked better for me than the straightforward how-to-do-its.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m hearing this &quot;unlearn&quot; a lot.  I haven&#39;t experienced the need to \n&gt; unlearn anything (maybe I still don&#39;t understand it?)\n&gt; Can you explain for me what you had to unlearn?\n\nFor me, not much to nothing. I guess I was lucky in that my first paid \njob involved lots of HTTP and understand caching and my boss was strong \non me reading RFCs and source code. Good OO design and implementation \nwas what you did to get all the HTTP based stuff to function well.\n\nChances are I understand neither, but I have to say, I don&#39;t see the \ngaping void between OOAD and REST insofar as you have to unlearn between \nthe two. This idea of &quot;unlearning&quot; or &quot;getting it&quot; bugs me a bit, it \nmakes a slice of software engineering sound like mysticism, or worse, \nmathematical insight.\n\nHere&#39;s the thing - it&#39;s a question of emphasis and of context. Most \ndevelopers are working procedurally or with objects; also they by \nnecessity have a very narrow and deep focus relative to Internet scale \narchitectures. So, it&#39;s not always going to make sense contextually why \nthey shouldn&#39;t just drill a convenience method through POST, manage \nstate with cookies, or use a controller URL to manage a whole load of \nresources. They&#39;re on a clock and don&#39;t have time for architectural \nhandwaving; and if handwaving is all you can provide you&#39;re actually \nstopping them from working. It&#39;s not any different from explaining why \nthey need to write maintainable code because their involvement with the \nsystem only comprises the first 20% of its lifespan (if even). \nDevelopers aren&#39;t idiots, they can and do understand long/wide term \nissues if ithey&#39;re laid out properly. Jesus knows the DBAs on the other \nend of the wire seem to be able to spell things out for them.\n\nIf there is a problem it&#39;s in teaching students and new hires. Object \nmodeling (fashionably called domain driven design these days), and \ndesign patterns don&#39;t come with caveats saying the design principles and \ntechniques are only appropriate in a certain context.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
