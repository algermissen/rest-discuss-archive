This will cause a URL to be generated of the format\n?col1=on&col3=on&col7=on\nThis URI identifies a resource which is that particular permutation of\ncolumn names. This can be easily rendered into HTML\nOf course, using a FORM literally might not be the most chrome looking UI,\nso let your script kiddies go nuts.\n\nb) use persistent data on the server to maintain state\nIf this information should be long-lived, have the server maintain a URI\nthat doesn&#39;t change and is unique for that user (in the same sense that a\nsession variable is unique to a user). When the left hand panel POSTs data\nto that URI, keep updating the selected columns and return a representation\nof the table with the users current set of selected columns.\nThis is nice if the purpose of the app is to later use that selected &#39;db\nview&#39; in some way - perhaps to modify attributes (like &#39;max rows&#39; or\nsomething), as well as this approach makes that &#39;db view&#39; an identifable\nconcept so you could do something like &#39;show me db #2 with view #27&#39;\n\nmike\n\n"}}
