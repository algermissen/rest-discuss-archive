Namely:\n\n- What do you think of the idea of having an interface definition\nlanguage for REST services ? It seems some people outright reject the\nidea, while others support it in the form of WADL.\nIt seems to me something like that would be nice to have, allowing for\nexample Yahoo, Google and Microsoft to agree on a unified API for\nsearches, that would be published using the IDL of choice. Client\ncould then switch fairly easily from an implementation to another.\nWhich leads to my second question...\n\n- Is there any ongoing attempt at establishing a standard for service\nregistries ? If we were to have that kind of domain-specific\nstandardized services, it would probably be interesting to have\nregistries of interesting service interfaces along with running\nimplementations. Which could be automatically tested for liveness by\nthe registry, possibly using information from the IDL (testing\npublished resources actually are there and respond to advertised\nverbs, etc).\n\nSorry if this sound very naive, as I said, I&#39;m a newcomer. I did read\nthe previous thread about WADL but it seemed to drift to a discussion\nof the merits of WADL itself and not IDLs for REST in general.\n-- \nOlivier Pernet\n\nWe are the knights who say\necho &#39;16i[q]sa[ln0=aln100%Pln100/snlbx]sbA0D4D465452snlbxq&#39;|dc\n\n"}}
