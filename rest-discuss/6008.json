Layering&#39;s not the problem tho&#39;,\n&gt; incoherency is*. IMO=\r\n the pattern &quot;Assign URIs To Representations&quot;\n&gt; results in protocol gibberi=\r\nsh.\n&gt;\nIt isn&#39;t assigning URIs to representations. It is assigning a URI to =\r\n \neach piece of conversational state, each of which by definition  \nbecomes=\r\n a resource. By defining a URI for each step along the way in  \na conversat=\r\nion, the user can back up to any previous place in the  \nconversation with =\r\nthe back button.\n\n&gt; The preferred approach is to ask the basket for its sta=\r\nte using GET.\n&gt; That is, the basket needs a URI, but the application doesn&#39;=\r\nt need a  \n&gt; URI\n&gt; for each state of the basket.\n&gt;\nHow would you do that if=\r\n you are designing an application for users  \nthat allows them to shop and =\r\nadd things into their shopping cart? The  \nuser interaction is that you wan=\r\nt to show the user a page of items,  \nand on the right hand side show them =\r\nwhat&#39;s in their cart, and allow  \nthem to add items to the cart. If you say=\r\n that page is the shopping  \ncart, then you can just post back to the same =\r\npage and it will change  \neach time, which breaks the back button. I can&#39;t =\r\nback up to go back  \nin time to previous versions of the shopping cart.\n\nBi=\r\nll\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
