The purpose of studying architectural styles is so\nthat we can reason about the properties of the system.\n\nIn this case, there are two properties driving the definition of\n&quot;resource&quot; within the REST style:\n\n(1) consistency of reference.  When you say &quot;GET the algorithm\nfor computing the area of a circle&quot; or &quot;GET the current weather\nin Norwalk&quot;, you want those requests to have consistent semantics\nover time.  Even if the particular answers vary.\n\n(2) scaleability.  One way to achieve that consistency is to let\nidentifiers identify representations, and rely on centralized link services\nto\ntrack state changes.  Every time the current weather in Norwalk\nchanged, a new document and a new identifier would have to be\nminted, and all existing documents with a reference to Norwalk\nweather would need their links updated, the overall cost of the operation\nbeing commensurate with the total number of such links.  The other,\nmore scaleable, way to achieve that is to do what REST does:\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nTraditional hypertext systems [61], which typically operate in a closed or\nlocal environment, use unique node or document identifiers that change every\ntime the information changes, relying on link servers to maintain references\nseparately from the content [135]. Since centralized link servers are an\nanathema to the immense scale and multi-organizational domain requirements\nof the Web, REST relies instead on the author choosing a resource identifier\nthat best fits the nature of the concept being identified. Naturally, the\nquality of an identifier is often proportional to the amount of money spent\nto retain its validity, which leads to broken links as ephemeral (or poorly\nsupported) information moves or disappears over time.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t think REST seeks to be a framework for knowledge\nrepresentation or semantics.  I think the requirements above led\nto its definition being inevitably &quot;conceptual&quot;.\n\nREST &quot;resource&quot; is unlike any other architectural component\nI am aware of in this sense.  A &quot;filter&quot; component in a pipe &\nfilter style makes promises about the consistency and relative\nstatelessness of the transform, but not any semantic consistency\nof the output.\n\nIn modeling REST formally, you can remove &quot;resource&quot; from\nthe picture without harming the purely technical aspects of the\nsystem.  What you then end up with is a many-to-many relation\nfrom URI to representations.  Perhaps that&#39;s all the Web *really*\nis, but it&#39;s hard to find any guidance in the building of useful\nsystems in that.  Put another way, it&#39;s hard to decide what value\nsuch a system might be providing.\n\nInteresting topic.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Jan Algermissen&quot; &lt;jalgermissen@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;algermissen@...&gt;; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, October 02, 2003 8:18 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] REST&#39;s Definition of Resource\n\n\n: Walden Mathews wrote:\n: &gt;\n: &gt; Jan,\n: &gt; :\n: &gt; : OTH, what Roy said in his last reply suggests that REST is also\n: &gt; : considered with knowledge representation issues.
