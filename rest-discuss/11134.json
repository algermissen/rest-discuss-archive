I think it&#39;s a matter of\n&gt;&gt; perception, but why do you think it&#39;s b=\r\netter to work something\n&gt;&gt; else even when the use case doesn&#39;t need more th=\r\nan what forms\n&gt;&gt; already provide?\n&gt;\n&gt; Short version: YAGNI is all well and =\r\ngood, but you can&#39;t refactor\n&gt; a protocol. That&#39;s probably too cryptic, so =\r\nlet me make a feeble\n&gt; attempt to explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main point is: I think A=\r\ntomPub&#39;s potential to disrupt is\n&gt; greatly dependent on the fact that it is=\r\n capable of covering 97%\n&gt; of all possible use cases, instead of just 85%. =\r\n(Figures derived\n&gt; by posterior extraction.)\n&gt;\n&gt; With narrower aspirations,=\r\n application/x-www-url-encoded is\n&gt; certainly fine and as a matter of fact =\r\nI use that for the\n&gt; majority of my work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note too that there&#39;s no reas=\r\non someone couldn&#39;t specify an\n&gt; AtomPub extension that would let clients o=\r\nperate a limited range\n&gt; of a collection&#39;s features using application/x-www=\r\n-url-encoded.\n&gt;\n&gt; But in general, there is a strong pressure in protocols t=\r\noward\n&gt; having fewer options and moving parts. RFC 3339 lays out the\n&gt; rati=\r\nonale nicely. So if you should restrict yourself to only a\n&gt; single choice,=\r\n which one would that be? I think picking one that\n&gt; neither limits your re=\r\nach nor is *too* complex is a natural\n&gt; outcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; F.ex., is it OK for ap=\r\nplication/x-www-url-encoded extension aware\n&gt; clients to not be able to ope=\r\nrate the AtomPub service using Atom\n&gt; at all? It would seem to me that as l=\r\nong as the mapping is\n&gt; incomplete, there would be pressure on clients to a=\r\ncquire the\n&gt; ability to operate the full feature set. But if you&#39;re going t=\r\no\n&gt; implement application/atom+xml anyway, then also implemeting\n&gt; applicat=\r\nion/x-www-url-encoded is no reduction in complexity for\n&gt; the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n could go on for another dozen of paragraphs, but the point is\n&gt; that as fa=\r\nr as I can see as yet, you are taking a programmer&#39;s\n&gt; view to complexity, =\r\nto which I am sympathetic as a programmer;\n&gt; however I am finding that conc=\r\nerns and evolutionary pressures in\n&gt; protocols differ from code such that c=\r\nomplexity and simplicity\n&gt; are rewarded or punished differently =96 not ent=\r\nirely, but in some\n&gt; important ways =96, simply because there is a massive =\r\npressure\n&gt; against any change at all in protocols.\n\nYou&#39;re right, I don&#39;t d=\r\no politics.  I judge protocols on their merit.\nIf a protocol is the best so=\r\nlution for the use cases it was designed\nfor, it will surface to the top.  =\r\nBut I won&#39;t recommend unnecessary\ncomplexity to promote a spec.\n\nIn the lon=\r\ng term, that does more harm than good.  I&#39;m actually\nsurprised that we&#39;re n=\r\not looking at the WS-* agenda games as a lesson\nlearned.  I&#39;m not convinced=\r\n the answer is more politics, and I&#39;m very\nworried about cargo culting.\n\nIt=\r\n&#39;s our job to recommend the best technology we know is sufficient to\nsolve =\r\nthe problem at hand.  And sometimes that means saying &quot;No. Not\nfor this use=\r\n case. Use your head, use [that] instead.&quot;\n\nHammering is something WS-* has=\r\n suffered from, and I&#39;d hate to see the\nsame happen to REST, because once t=\r\nhe false claims turn into broken\npromises, all that&#39;s left is backlash, and=\r\n backlash has a way of\ndiminishing the value of even the best technologies.=\r\n\n\nI&#39;m seeing too many people enveloping everything they send with\nAtomPub, =\r\nfor no reason other than it&#39;s AtomPub, so it might be good,\nright?  I see p=\r\neople who don&#39;t bother to learn REST, they just\nenvelope with AtomPub =97 e=\r\nnveloping is easy, architecture style is\nhard.  They&#39;re not even using it r=\r\night, but they marked the checkbox,\nand yes, there&#39;s one case involving wra=\r\npping RPC calls inside AtomPub.\n\nSo when the time comes and we get to see S=\r\nOAP passing over the wire,\nexcept the envelope is called AtomPub, would we =\r\nstand back and smile\nand think to ourselves &quot;mission accomplished&quot;?\n\nAtomPu=\r\nb is a good solution, just not the best solution to every\nproblem.  Using i=\r\nt like a hammer would be worse than not using it\nenough, possibly the worst=\r\n thing that could happen to it.\n\nWe need to teach developers how to enginee=\r\nr the right solution, that&#39;s\nthe only way they could rise to the problem, n=\r\not help them cargo cult\nthe next shiny spec or the next best whatever.\n\nI d=\r\non&#39;t see enough of that, and quite frankly it saddens me and in\nsome way ev=\r\nen scares me.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://pl=\r\nasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
