I got some=\r\n interesting\n&gt; &gt; responses to this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another (RESTful?) solution cou=\r\nld be to POST to a resource that is\n&gt; &gt; responsible for turning a lightbulb=\r\n on. For example, POST\n&#92;lightswitch\n&gt; &gt; sending in the light bulb and state=\r\n (on/off) chosen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My challenge with this second solution is that th=\r\ne other verbs will\nnot\n&gt; &gt; be used against this resource, in essence this r=\r\nesource is pretty\nmuch a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;POST-only&quot; resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is that ok?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhat do you mean?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d expect to be able to do GET /lightswitch and know=\r\n if it is in on\n&gt; or off position.\n&gt;\n&gt; =3D=3D&gt; GET /lightswitch\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=3D=3D=\r\n 200 OK\n&gt; &lt;=3D=3D &lt;lightswitch&gt;&lt;state&gt;on&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/lightswitch&gt;\nI agree\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I&#39;d also expect to be able to PUT /lightswitch and send in some\n&gt; directi=\r\nve to control it.\n&gt;\n&gt; =3D=3D&gt; PUT /lightswitch\n&gt; =3D=3D&gt; &lt;lightswitch&gt;&lt;stat=\r\ne&gt;off&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/lightswitch&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=3D=3D 200 OK.\nWell this is where I have m=\r\ny problem.  Your ultimately aim is to turn a\nlight bulb on i.e. modifying t=\r\nhe state of the light switch is just a\nmeans to an end.  For you to know wh=\r\nat should happen to the light bulb\nyou would have to interrogate the conten=\r\nts of the PUT which IMHO means\nthat you are passing method information.  Am=\r\n I wrong here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, depending on your domain rules, I&#39;d think that =\r\nI can do a\nsuccessful\n&gt; DELETE against it which could, say, be the analogou=\r\ns of removing a\n&gt; real lightswitch, which may makes sense if you want a con=\r\ntinously on\nlight\n&gt; bulb or if you have no further need to control some cir=\r\ncuit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; YS.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: &#39;/&#39; is the separator, not &#39;&#92;&#39;.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
