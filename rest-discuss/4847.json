Try to think whether there isn&#39;t any state that\ncould be usefully returned in response to the GET.\n\nMaybe it would make sense to consider that the thing\nyou are activating could be a resource, which could have\nan boolean &#39;activated&#39; attribute resource; then you could\n\nPUT /resource/activated\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nt\n\nBut maybe you can think of better alternatives yourself.\n \n&gt; There&#39;s probably lots of different things that could be returned.\n&gt; Is what&#39;s POSTed application/x-www-form-urlencoded or\n&gt; multipart/form-data?  If so, an HTML form would seem a sensible thing\n&gt; to return.\n\nSomething I have found to work well is have a resource whose\nrepresentation is a &#39;blank slate&#39; for a particular resource\n&#39;class&#39;.\n\nSay you&#39;re talking about sales. You have a &#39;container&#39; or\n&#39;category&#39; resource for all the sales resources, e.g. /sales\n\nThe HTML representation of /sales links to /sales/new.\n\nThe HTML representation of /sales/new would be a form,\nwhich POSTs to /sales .\n\n"}}
