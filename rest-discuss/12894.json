They killed the question mark\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and are now using fragment identifiers for Google Search.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just&quot;?  Sure, I will agree it *seems* innocuous but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s  \n&gt; the difference between a search service and a search application.   \n&gt; However, they still support the old &quot;google.com/search?&quot; URI, by the  \n&gt; way.  This is probably why I never noticed it sooner:  I always use  \n&gt; a keyboard hotkey that triggers search accelerator that uses the old  \n&gt; URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know GMail and others use this &quot;Kill The Question Mark&quot; trick, but  \n&gt; essentially its a big shift in abstracting out the browser and HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom line: This replaces the browser&#39;s TransferAgent object/ \n&gt; service with the application&#39;s own InternalTransferAgent object/ \n&gt; service, insulating the application from the browser&#39;s knowledge  \n&gt; about how to handle URI requests.  This is a radical shift in  \n&gt; architecture, even if seemingly innocuous, and I call it _a change  \n&gt; for the good of humankind_.\n&gt;\n&gt; This degree of loose coupling is similar to not depending on STDIN/ \n&gt; STDOUT, which support for varies by OS, for your metaphor of  \n&gt; coroutines.  Instead of such coupling to I/O device, one might be  \n&gt; seen using sockets instead (the ports/connections metaphor of  \n&gt; coroutines).\n&gt;\n&gt; So &quot;just&quot; is unjustified.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now browsers encourage a bias towards tight coupling with the  \n&gt; transfer agent, and it is only through coincidence that it is stable  \n&gt; enough to meet most needs, up until now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I am alone on this, but I think the ? and # system is the  \n&gt; hugest hack in HTTP, and feel it came as an afterthought for how to  \n&gt; handle what seemed like a small and simple problem.  (I reserve the  \n&gt; right to change my mind.)\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
