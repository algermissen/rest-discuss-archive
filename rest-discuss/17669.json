But, the\nissue here is really, why does the use o=\r\nf forms need to be communicated\nover the wire?  In the case of XForms, appl=\r\nication/xhtml+xml is used,\nand the document&#39;s hypertext turns on the XForms=\r\n processor (if present).\nBut that processor won&#39;t be called unless the clie=\r\nnt knows how to\nprocess XHTML as such, which is all the granularity which n=\r\needs to go\nover the wire at the protocol layer.  Nothing wrong with fine-gr=\r\nained\nconformance levels / versioning within the representation, so long as=\r\n\nthe proper coarse-grained processing model is called.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way: wha=\r\nt are intermediaries actual doing except caching and\n&gt; load balancing? \n&gt; \n=\r\n\nAntivirus gateways, transcoding proxies for wireless networks, DNS\nprecach=\r\ne, ISP Web accelerators (image modification) -- all those things\nwhich make=\r\n the Web anarchically scalable.  All you can do is stick to\nstandardized se=\r\nmantics, thereby supporting all those things which never\noccurred to you.\n\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought the media type is primary used for client/server\n&gt; interactio=\r\nn and secondary for the intermediaries...\n&gt; \n\nSee REST Chapter 6.5.2, the p=\r\noint of the style is &quot;standard semantics\nwhich can be interpreted by interm=\r\nediaries almost as well as by the\nmachines that originate [or consume*] ser=\r\nvices&quot;.  This is primarily\nachieved by exposing the sender&#39;s intended proce=\r\nssing model for the\nrepresentation, as a media type.\n\n-Eric\n\n*another edit =\r\nfor RESTbis...\n\n"}}
