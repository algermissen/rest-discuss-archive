Clients can assume that relative URLs in a\nresponse can be resolved relative to the URL they used to send the request\nthat returned the response.\n\nREST frowns upon responses like this that require clients to know how to\nconstruct URLs to retrieve additional data.\n&lt;musicCollection&gt;\n  &lt;owner name=&quot;Mark Volkmann&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;artist id=&quot;19&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;artist id=&quot;43&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/musicCollection&gt;\nIn this example, a client would construct a URL like the following to\nretrieve a representation of an artist in the collection.\nhttp://host:port/webapp/artist/19. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
