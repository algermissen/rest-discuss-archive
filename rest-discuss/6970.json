You should be able to\n: &gt; evaluate that by inspecting the interactions of the system, looking\n: &gt; for instances where the server must store conversational\n: &gt; state in order to satisfy certain subsequent requests.  Finding\n: &gt; none of that is an indicator, but not a guarantee, of scaleability,\n: &gt; because the application may have poorly scaleable aspects\n: &gt; not visible in the client interactions.\n: \n: Which seemingly resolves to a subjective assessment?\n: Fine, identify it as such, perhaps give it a low weighting.\n: I&#39;ve seen systems pointed to with clearer &#39;this is bad&#39; marks assigned.\n\nIt&#39;s not so much a matter of subjective as it is of availability of\ndata and what can be inferred from it.  This is definitely not as\nsimple as writing JUnit &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; functional tests.\nThe properties induced by an architecture tend to be less\nobservable, and exist relative to local constraints.  For example,\nscaleability only means something relative to the resources\nactually available.\n\nAs far as &quot;clear &#39;this is bad&#39; marks, there is more clarity (negative)\nin finding counterexamples than there is clarity (positive) in not\nfinding any.  This is like Alloy analysis where the best we can do\nis fail to find an inconsistency in a reasonably large scope: that&#39;s still \nnot a proof, although it&#39;s reason to have confidence.\n: \n: \n: &gt;\n: &gt; Bill didn&#39;t say &quot;test&quot;; he said &quot;evaluate&quot;.  I think the above is an\n: &gt; example of the latter.\n: \n: Wow. subtle!\n: I won&#39;t go there, my English isn&#39;t good enough.\n: Perhaps different shades of gray?\n\nWell, think about how you (never mind REST) would go about\ntesting the scaleability of your application.  Now contrast that with\nhow you would evaluate the same thing based on an inspection\nof application artifacts.  Is that subtle?\n\n: Then how about a graded set of tests which anyone might\n: apply to gain some form of measure of the alignment\n: of the system with the REST ideas?\n\nSimilar to CMM assessments, I think it would be possible to\nput together a set of evaluation areas, based on the REST\nconstraints, and to write up guidelines on how to inspect systems\nto determine their &quot;REST maturity&quot;.  But I wouldn&#39;t call that testing\nanymore than the SEI calls the CMM assessments tests (they\ndon&#39;t).\n\n&quot;Ruler&quot; is too simplistic a metaphor for this.\n\nWalden\n\n\n\n"}}
