Looking at the HTTP specs,\n\nI don&#39;t think you need to combine GET and DELETE. The atomicity you are\ngoing for is an approach to &#39;guarantee&#39; that only one client will processes\na particular item in the queue. There are other ways to do that - perhaps\nusing conditional request headers (If-Match, etc.). One issue is that DELETE\nis idempotent - repeatedly sending the request should return a success\nresponse each time - no indication of the previous state. I think explicit\nstate management might be needed here.\n\n&gt; I am not sure if it is ok for the server to return a representation\n&gt; of the deleted resource.\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.7 &quot;A successful\nresponse SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing\nthe status, [...]&quot;\nThis appears to indicate that an entity can be returned.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The second issue I am not sure about is whether it is semantically\n&gt; ok to use DELETE on a subordinate resource to alter the state of\n&gt; the container itself.\nIf it doesn&#39;t break your app or generic client apps, it&#39;s likely to be okay.\n\nThere are several relevant discussion on rest-discuss from the past: (we\nshould collect these on the Wiki)\nReST and Representing Mailboxes\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3169\n\n\n"}}
