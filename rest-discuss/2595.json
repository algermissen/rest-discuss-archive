In a world where resources\n&gt; &gt; are synonymous with documents (or files or records or any entity in\n&gt; &gt; computer accessible storage), DELETE makes sense. In a world where\n&gt; &gt; resources can reside outside computers and their storage, DELETE doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; make much sense, at least not until Stephen King writes a story called\n&gt; &gt; Web Browser of the Gods.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can ask to DELETE a person if you want.  The issue is, are you\n&gt; allowed?  I suggest that 403 is the best response to such a request,\n&gt; rather than 501.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were to treat DELETE as a method to invalidate the\nmapping of a URI to its resource, then this would not be as much an issue.\nFor instance, I have two names I answer to:  Seairth and Jake (old college\nnickname).  If I were to DELETE &quot;Jake&quot;, I am not deleting myself.  All I am\ndoing is invalidating the mapping between &quot;Jake&quot; and myself.  If there were\npeople in the world who only knew me as Jake and only knew how to find by by\nthat name,  I would effectively be deleted to those people.  In reality, I\nlive on as Seairth only.  Were it possible to DELETE *all* names I have\n(Proper name, SSN, Resident @ address, etc.), then I would effectively cease\nto exist to everyone (since no one was capable of finding me anymore).\n\nI think that DELETE can work in all circumstances as only as we change our\nfocus on what we are really deleting.  This view should not change the way\nthings work, but it should allow us to understand and accept DELETE in a\nmore universal manner...  I think... :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
