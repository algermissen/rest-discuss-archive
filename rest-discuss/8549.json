You can move towards a more complete \nimplementation of the style over time (just like you would when moving \nto objects). Remember that introducing excessive new technology is a \nrisk in itself.\n\nThe exception I see in your examples is using GET for destructive \nactions. That&#39;s a serious design flaw - when it happens and a user \nunintentionally destroys data you won&#39;t be able to rationalize why you \nshipped with it - the Rails community have tried to do that twice and \nfailed miserably. You will be deemed incompetent if comes to loss of \nfunds, or placing people in harms way.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
