The spec is\n&gt; pretty clear: DELETE *SHOULD* return 200, 204 etc. Just like it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mention the whole range of 5xx and 4xx that can be returned.\n&gt; 303 makes also no normative reference as to which verbs it can be\n&gt; associated, only splitting its definition between HEAD/GET and other\n&gt; verbs.\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re correct, it says SHOULD.  However, I believe that implies that\nother 2xx response codes could be used to indicate success.  When the\nmethod is DELETE, the response code should indicate 2xx &#39;success&#39; or\n4xx &#39;failure&#39;, with the special 202 code indicating &#39;request accepted,\nsuccess or failure pending&#39;.  If the DELETE request goes to a URI which\nnormally 301 redirects, I could see where the user could be given the\noption of deleting the 301 mapping, or deleting the target resource,\nusing a 300 Multiple Choices response.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
