The server then simply &quot;gets&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; each of those files from the urls indicated (retrieving them from the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; browser-acting-as-server).  This the REST client-server constraint \n&gt; &gt;&gt; on its head (P2P rest, as you said), but even Roy F. hinted \n&gt; &gt;&gt; at such a &quot;relaxation&quot; being an interesting approach [1].\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very cool. But how often do corporate firewalls block incoming \n&gt; &gt; HTTP/Port 80 requests to &quot;unofficial&quot; IP addresses? I \n&gt; &gt; thought it was quite common; which means the technique \n&gt; &gt; the sizable wouldn&#39;t work for population accessing the web from \n&gt; &gt; behind corporate firewalls.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know much about how firewalls are typically \n&gt; configured, but one nice thing about the POW extension is \n&gt; that you get to decide which port it&#39;ll run on as part of the \n&gt; configuration, which is fine since you get to tell the \n&gt; server-as-client where to make the request.  It would be \n&gt; ideal if POW only opened the port for the short period of \n&gt; time necessary and then shut down again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw Stefano Mazzocchi give a talk at ApacheCon (2006??) \n&gt; about a project at MIT called PiggyBank [0], which also runs \n&gt; a server (Jetty, I believe) in the browser. I wonder what \n&gt; sort of issues they have run into re: \n&gt; firewalls, etc.  I know that the person behind POW was using \n&gt; it to develop a rich, searchable browsing history for the \n&gt; user which is similar, in some general way, to the goals of PiggyBank.\n\nA web-server-in-a-browser is a very interesting idea and if it were widely\ndeployed could solve a lot of problem not the least is server load for apps\nthat have to poll. \n\nOf course the first thing I thought about when I read the post was the\nfirewall issue, but as Peter replies a different port could be used.  That\nsaid, this could be a perfect areas for the W3C TAG or a WG to address. If\nthe W3C were to assign a well-known port for browser-based HTTP servers and\nif they could study the problem to define a safe set of functionality that\nbrowsers could implement (a sandbox-so-to-speak) and a standard object that\ncan be tested in Javascript to determine supporting browsers this could\nusher in a whole new set of capabilities.  It could also benefit REST as it\nwould only make sense for the callbacks to be RESTful.  This could be the\nnext layer on top of AJAX.\n\nDo the list participants think this idea has merit?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
