RDF is already at one - Tarskian semantics.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If it is a prerequisite of the machine-processable web to have fully\n&gt;&gt;&gt; self-describing documents, then we can always translate these to RDF\n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; our storage needs if we really want to. In the mean-time, I would\n&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest that RDF complicates the common case in favour of an\n&gt;&gt; uncommon\n&gt;&gt;&gt; case that can be solved in a different way once the common case is\n&gt;&gt; dealt\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with.\n&gt;&gt; I would see that the other way around, that RDF doesn&#39;t complicate the\n&gt;&gt; common case because there&#39;s no conflict with passing around XML. But\n&gt;&gt; when you need to integrate data across domains, RDF is mighty handy.\n&gt; \n&gt; I still haven&#39;t seen this kind of data integration working, especially\n&gt; within REST constraints of a message with a content type that describes\n&gt; its content. I look at how rss was not aggregated at the RDF level, but\n&gt; at a higher level and take from that that RDF doesn&#39;t provide automatic\n&gt; aggregation within a vocabulary. \n\nWhat &quot;higher level&quot; would that be?\n\n\n&gt; I look at the problem of describing the\n&gt; content type of a mixed rdf document and take from that that RDF doesn&#39;t\n&gt; have a good answer for exchanging multi-vocabulary documents in a\n&gt; RESTful way.\n\nNeither does XML. No browsers support XML namespaces properly; what they \nwill or will not do with microformats is unclear. This problem is not \nrestricted to RDF. But the consequences of applying inappropriate or \nunwarranted reasoners to RDF based data are probably serious, as they&#39;ll \nbe very hard to debug or unravel.\n\nThen again, when we are writing the Bitter REST books 7 years from now, \nI imagine conneg and self-description will get a chapter each.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks for the discussion so far, gents. I guess where I am at at the\n&gt; moment is that RDF is an expensive unnecessary complication for today&#39;s\n&gt; software languages and techniques. If we replaced all of those\n&gt; techniques with RDF-centric reasoning-based languages RDF might tip the\n&gt; balance towards being useful.\n\nI agree with this overall position, but with very, very few of the \narguments you used to justify it, at least the ones I can understand \n(your graph/tree position is lost on me; there&#39;s no free lunch for data \nstructures and I can&#39;t reconcile you stated preference for objects with \nyour disdain for graph processing). The counter-position worth \nconsidering is that today&#39;s software languages and techniques are quite \npoor given the problem spaces. The dollar cost of integration and \nmaintenance is the bulk of current &quot;IT&quot; spending.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
