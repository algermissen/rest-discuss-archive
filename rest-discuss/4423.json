This argues that HTML FORM GETs are \n&gt; a bad way of creating URIs because they are fabricated.\n\nCaching.  If you already have the information for that artist,\nwhy should you be forced to download it again?  Often, the reason\nis because the resource provider just assumes every access is a\nquery by a new user on a home PC with broadband, because that is\nthe only way they have ever tested their own site.\n\nThe query URI is still a valid identifier for the query -- it just\nisn&#39;t as useful, alone, for enhancing scalability.  A redirection\nallows an infinite number of queries to be redirected to a finite\nnumber of resources, each of which can be cached.  [Note: special\npurpose caches can be created on the server-side for handling\ncommon queries, as is done by Google and big e-commerce sites, but\nthat only improves back-end performance.]\n\nAnyway, we are talking about resource discovery over arbitrary\ndata categories, and hence non-hierarchical in nature.  There is\nnothing wrong with telling the client how it can form URI&#39;s,\nassuming that such a function doesn&#39;t change much over time.\nAgain, for cache reasons, I prefer methods of telling the client\nto use the template\n\n    http://example.com/quotes/${exchange}/${symbol}\n\nrather than the template\n\n    http://example.com/quotes?market=${exchange}&symbol=${symbol}\n\nThere is nothing stopping WSDL-like technology from defining\nboth of these mechanisms.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
