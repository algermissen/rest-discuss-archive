Renounce your heresy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now see, this is what I&#39;m talking about re: dogma.  I seriously doubt you and\n&gt; Mark have bothered to carefully read through that monster before starting in\n&gt; with the indoctrination.  \n\nI did read it. I&#39;ve even gone through and added my comments inline. I&#39;m\nhappy to have sacred cow barbeque but I think the web architecture\nalready anticipates all of your concerns.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Web archiving is one example where computability of URI is useful and\n&gt; &gt; important.&quot; Well that&#39;s what query parameters are for. There is an\n&gt; &gt; exception to URI opacity in the web architecture already.\n&gt; \n&gt; But this is problematic!  I *should* be able to e.g. use my caching proxy to\n&gt; cache /archive/2001/09/11 or whatever!  \n\nEr, who said you can&#39;t cache things in query strings?\n\n&gt; .. Shoving things into the query string\n&gt; isn&#39;t a good answer, each of those objects should be reified as a resource\n&gt; and addressible via URI.  \n\nThe query string *generates* a URI. I&#39;m totally not following you.\nHere&#39;s a URI that is both cacheable and addressable using query strings:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=everything+old+is+new+REST\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; It depends on how stringently you apply it.  There&#39;s very little guidance.\n&gt; TBL seems to have some informal notions of what makes &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; URI,\n&gt; but that&#39;s far from normative.\n\nOkay, but its a user interface issue, NOT a software architecture issue.\nI strongly encourage you to write a web page about good URI naming\nconventions. But I also encourage you to separate it from the heresy\nabout /proc. ;)\n\n&gt; &gt; URIs should sometimes be constructable from a\n&gt; &gt; base and parameters (though probably not deconstructable). Yes, but that\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t in conflict with the opacity principle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, it depends on how stringently you apply the principle.  \n\nThe page where the principle is described also describes its appropriate\nlimits: \n\n&quot;Query strings are clearly not opaque to the client. However, they\nshould be opaque to (for example) proxies.&quot;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Why?  If I provided you with (RDF, whatever) that formally defined the\n&gt; structure of names on my site and your code could deduce from that /\n&gt; automatically generate meaningful names, why is this a bad thing?\n\n#1. Because of the redirection problem.\n\n#2. Because now you have two ways to do the same thing: using hyperlinks\nand using semantic URIs. What benefit does the latter provide?\n\n#3. Because now you are restricted in your naming conventions so that it\nbecomes difficult to make names in French and German that are\nfunctionally equivalent to the english names. Does Red Flag linux handle\nthe Chinese word for /proc and /proc/pid/status? If so, what happens to\nyour ps script. If not, then you&#39;ve sacrificed guessability.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Bottom line:  the Web insists on opacity --- there are no names, only\n&gt; identifiers.  Everywhere else that syntactically similar entities are used,\n&gt; the trend has been to increase rather than decrease the semantic richness of\n&gt; the namespace.  Why the discrepancy?  Smart people exist in both\n&gt; communities;  a reasonable person looks at this discrepancy and attempts to\n&gt; understand what&#39;s going on here.\n\n#1. The web people have this problem where the &quot;file system&quot; is global\nand they want any link to be able to point at any server.\n\n#2. The price of double or triple or quadruple dereferencing a file name\nis cheap compared to the price of parsing markup in a file system.\nWhereas the price of parsing markup is trivial on the web compared to\nthe price of following one redirect to another redirect to another\nredirect etc. Better to plan for the need to move things in advance by\n&quot;indirecting&quot; through markup.\n\n#3. The web people just dig markup more.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
