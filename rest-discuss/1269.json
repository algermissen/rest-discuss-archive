Wes Felter said it was &quot;entertaining&quot; but there was very\n&gt; little logged in IRC.\n\nFrom a &quot;getting stuff done&quot; point of view, the thing was doomed from the\nstart. I had always had a sense that that was the case but I figured\nthat it was better than nothing. Many of the other talks presumed a SOAP\nfuture so I thought it important that there be a session that at least\nquestioned that theory.\n\nBut consider that the same day of the session, Rohit Khare gave a talk\non an alternate model for web services (not REST (despite the fact that\nhe claims it is a superset of REST), not RPC and not traditional\nmessaging). He had 45 mins. He hardly had time in that period to explain\nthe idea and he didn&#39;t have a single slide showing an angle bracket or\nnetwork transmission. He didn&#39;t even describe, really, how SOAP supports\nhis model. (i.e. from a technical point of view it was mostly hand\nwaving)\n\nNow contrast that with five guys trying to educate an audience and\ndebate a model *at the same time* in 45 mins, with no slides, while\nconstantly interrupting each other, with differing agenda. All you could\nhope for is to get across the idea that there is a debate and that the\naudience should look on the web for more information. That much was\naccomplished.\n\nInsofar as the burden of proof was on the REST guys (as we were\nsuggesting something different from the mainstream) I would expect that\na neutral observer would say that the REST case was NOT made. In the\nlast five minutes I hinted at the foundations of the REST case but only\nan extremely charitable audience member would catch the whiff of that\nand follow up through more research on the Web.\n\n====\n\nI also found it frustrating that Rohit quoted a definition of REST that\nwas not complete. I did not have opportunity to correct him but he used\nhis definition as a basis for the statement that he was the only one who\nknew what REST is. In particular, his more generic definition allowed\nhim to say that SOAP (and particularly, SOAP Routing, his hobby horse)\nwas an extension of REST.\n\nWhereas when I compare his talk (and the SOAP spec) against the\ndefinition I use, I see almost no points of intersection:\n\n&quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of\nresources; manipulation of resources through representations;\nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application\nstate.&quot;\n\nNeither SOAP nor SOAP Routing have first-class concepts of resources,\nresource identifiers, representations of resources, or hypermedia. And I\nwould argue that the following typical SOAP message is not\nself-descriptive but rather self-contradictory:\n\nPOST /foo/bar\n\n&lt;SOAP-crap&gt;\n  &lt;getStockQuote&gt;IBM&lt;/getStockQuote&gt;\n&lt;/SOAP-crap&gt;\n\nIs it posting information or getting information?\n\nThe points the other four speakers made were relatively predictable if\nyou&#39;ve followed our arguments across the various fora.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
