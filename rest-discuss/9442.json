Pick a resource off the top-level page, narrow\nit on the next, narrow it on the next, and finally you start to see\nsomething. This is less than ideal, obviously - clients of the human\nvariety are liable to lose interest well before then, among other\nthings.\n\nSo my question is, is there anything unRESTful about having a sort of\nmeta-resource? That is, say you offer a link to what is structured\nmostly like a level-3 resource, but it actually contains *all* the\nlevel-4 resources, and no specific level-3 (or perhaps all the\nlevel-4&#39;s that belong to all the level-3&#39;s that belong to a specified\nlevel-2). Except in cases where there&#39;s too much content (and thus\nrequire pagination), there aren&#39;t going to be any query strings or\nanything else search-engine-unfriendly. Is there anything I&#39;m missing?\n\n"}}
