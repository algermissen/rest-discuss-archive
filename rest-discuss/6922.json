Basically you want to be using HTTP digest\nauth. Your primary blockers are:\n\n1. Your graphical designer. She wants to have a funky login screen with\npictures of your product and links to the offer of the day. It&#39;s\npossible to mitigate this:\n\n\thttp://www.peej.co.uk/articles/http-auth-with-html-forms.html\n\nThis only works for browsers with JavaScript turned on, but other\nbrowsers will not care that they only get served the standard auth\ndialog, and your graphical designer doesn&#39;t know that JavaScript *can*\nbe turned off.\n\n2. You can&#39;t log out. Design your app to deal with this.\n\n3. MSIE has bugs using digest auth to retrieve URLs with query\nparameters. Apache httpd (and possibly other servers) has a workaround\nfor this, see\n\n\thttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_auth_digest.html\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
