On thinking about this, it *seems* to me that the semantics of \n&gt; Allow are much more about what methods can be performed on a resource \n&gt; than what semantics can be performed on a resource by a given user.\nYep.  Although if it&#39;s allowed to define a resource as &quot;the set of \nbuckets owned by the current user&quot; I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t define a \nresource as &quot;a view of buckets owned by jpanzer filtered for the current \nuser&quot;.  So if you allow the former I think you could legitimately say \nthat the semantics of Allow could be honored if the resource is defined \nappropriately.  However I think you&#39;re disallowing the former.\n&gt;\n&gt; So if we have, say, guest and resource-owner users and the former can \n&gt; only GET while the latter can GET and PUT the Allow header should \n&gt; always be Allow: GET, PUT and the following responses must be generated:\n&gt;\n&gt;           Guest     Owner\n&gt; GET       2xx/3xx   2xx/3xx\n&gt; PUT       401       2xx\n&gt; POST      405       405\n&gt; FOO       405       405\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that while Allow: is optional with most responses it&#39;s mandatory \n&gt; with 405s.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you need more information about who can do what than this it should \n&gt; probably be expressed in an entity.\n&gt;\nIn practice, it turns out to be very useful to know what&#39;s allowed and \nwhat&#39;s not without doing extra requests (some of which have side \neffects).  If for no other reason than avoiding extra network hops.  So \nhaving to request an additional entity to get 4 bits of information is \nin practical terms a very hard sell.  I suspect that people will instead \ngo with an X- custom header.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n"}}
