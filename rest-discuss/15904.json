It&#39;s reasonable for people who\nunderstand the approach (or modern architectural practice in general) to\nobject to a different set of constraints being called &#39;REST&#39;.\n\nThe difference with REST and say, Web Services or N-Tier Middleware, or\nLAMP, is that REST writes down the constraints to achieve a desired set\nof properties and tradeoffs involved, and the others are extremely\nvague. In that sense, it&#39;s a relatively scientific approach.  The REST\nconstraints and trade-offs are fairly holistic, not quite a house of\ncards, but they are meant to work in concert to achieve an overall\neffect. I think one reason people paint REST proponents as &#39;religious&#39;\nis because designers who understand REST are aware of what is lost when\ncertain constraints are lifted, and when said designers point that out,\nthe same people assume this is dogmatism instead of an objective\ncomment. Which is both ironic and stupid, not unlike an alchemist\ncalling a scientist a witch.  \n\n\nBill\n\nOn Tue, 2010-07-20 at 09:49 +0100, António Mota wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; Because it drives people away from REST. And a style is just a style,\n&gt; nothing more than that. Implementations are all about compromising.\n&gt; One thing is to break a constraint, another \n&gt; is not to apply it. I reckon that sometimes, but not always, not not\n&gt; apply it indeed means break it - but again, not always.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is, for non-REST people, to say &quot;that is not REST&quot; is\n&gt; half-way for them to understand &quot;REST is not for you, go back to SOAP\n&gt; or whatever you came from&quot;. That&#39;s this I think is counter-productive,\n&gt; to drive people away on account of purism (or sometimes fanatic or\n&gt; religious) point-of-views. This is just technology, all around us\n&gt; technology is made of compromises, even if some people like to make\n&gt; it, and have fun with, some kind of war (like Java vs .NET, MS vs.\n&gt; OpenSource, iPhone vs Android, and of course REST vs WS-*). But in the\n&gt; end most of those people will work, will mix and match, will adapt\n&gt; every other technology as they seem fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is just that, a style to be applied (and thus, pragmatically),\n&gt; not a religious holy-grail...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2010/7/20 Ryan Riley &lt;ryan.riley@...&gt;\n&gt;         I don&#39;t remember seeing anyone say it&#39;s all of nothing, just\n&gt;         that you shouldn&#39;t call it REST if it doesn&#39;t meet all the\n&gt;         constraints. As you said, if it&#39;s useful, use it. What&#39;s wrong\n&gt;         with clarifying such an approach is not, therefore, RESTful?\n&gt;         By definition, it&#39;s not.
