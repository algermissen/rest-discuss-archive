(aside from trivial cases like http://www.oreilly.com and\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.oreilly.com:80/ )\n&gt;\n&gt;  AFAIK, you cannot assume that port 80 is the default port - isn&#39;t that\n&gt;  just a convention that an admin can amend at will? Therefore, you\n&gt;  can&#39;t say that they are the same resource.\n\nNope -- the client has to know the port before connecting to the\nserver! An http: URI without a port is definitely equivalent to the\nsame URI with :80 added. That&#39;s one of the rules for textual\ncomparison of URIs.\n\n&gt;  Off the cuff, I would guess that the only way that you can check that\n&gt;  the resources are the same is to either:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1) GET both resources and compare, or\n\nOf course, you&#39;d be getting and comparing representations, not resources...\n\n&gt;  2) if the server implements ETag support (not all do), you could\n&gt;  compare two HEAD requests.\n\nETags are per-resource; the &quot;same&quot; ETag may be returned in requests to\ndifferent resources.\n\n&gt;  To the best of my knowledge, there is no HTTP specification for\n&gt;  resource equivalence checking.\n\nYep. You might get some implicit information from the Location or\nContent-Location headers returned by the server, but those still don&#39;t\ntell you it&#39;s the &quot;same&quot; resource. I suppose a more direct question\nfor Elliotte is, what would this information be used for?\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n"}}
