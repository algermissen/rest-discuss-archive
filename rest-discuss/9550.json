It seems some people outright rej=\r\nect the\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;d be nice to have the ideas of HTML forms influence software=\r\n-to- \n&gt; software\n&gt; HTTP-based-API design.  The idea that if instead of hard=\r\n-coding the\n&gt; query-parameters that a resource expects to see GET or POSTed=\r\n, a  \n&gt; previous GET\n&gt; might have an in-band form that describes such param=\r\neters, for the  \n&gt; software\n&gt; to construct.  The idea that services =96 in =\r\nthe same ways that  \n&gt; browsers do =96\n&gt; benefit from starting from http://=\r\napi.flickr.yahoo.com/ and traversing\n&gt; expected representations, rather tha=\r\nn hard-coding URLs...\n\nForms indeed are a key piece that needs to be looked=\r\n at. I have found  \nit inspiring  to think of forms as questions available =\r\nfor the user  \nagent to answer.  By ticking a checkbox, entering text in a =\r\nfield,  \nselecting a drop down menu, the user is answering a question  \nexp=\r\nlained in english to him,  and binding variables to his answer.\n\nTo make th=\r\nis more automatizable the questions have to be able to be  \nasked in machin=\r\ne readable way that is both easy for humans and  \nmachines to understand, t=\r\nhat is flexible and decentralised. The  \nsemantic web provides the machine =\r\nreadable decentralised vocabulary  \nto describe the world, SPARQL the query=\r\n language to ask it.  To see  \nhow I first thought of it, have a quick read=\r\n at &quot;RESTFul Semantic Web  \nServices&quot;\n\nhttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/r=\r\nestful_semantic_web_services\n\nThat is a first shot. But it seems to be much=\r\n more RESTful and easier  \nto understand than the SOAP stack.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; exampl=\r\ne Yahoo, Google and Microsoft to agree on a unified API for\n&gt;&gt; searches, th=\r\nat would be published using the IDL of choice. Client\n&gt;\n\nThat is called SPA=\r\nRQL.\n\n&gt; Why would they want to do that?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time, one could i=\r\nmagine many of the blog engines of the  \n&gt; world\n&gt; publishing a little frag=\r\nment that looked something like:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;form API:id=3D&quot;arc=\r\nhive-content-search&quot; method=3D&quot;GET&quot; action=3D&quot;./ \n&gt; search&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;input t=\r\nype=3D&quot;text&quot; name=3D&quot;q&quot;/&gt;&lt;input type=3D&quot;submit&quot;  \n&gt; value=3D&quot;Search!&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n &lt;/form&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Is there any ongoing attempt at establis=\r\nhing a standard for service\n&gt;&gt; registries ? If we were to have that kind of=\r\n domain-specific\n&gt;&gt; standardized services, it would probably be interesting=\r\n to have\n&gt; [...]\n\nYou no longer need standard registries. With SPARQL and t=\r\nhe semantic  \nweb you have all you need.\n\nNow I am not absolutely sure of t=\r\nhat statement to tell you the truth,  \nbecause I have not used registries t=\r\nhat much, so if you have a doubt  \nplease put forward a use case of a regis=\r\ntry, and I&#39;ll try to show how  \nI would do it .\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ETOO_MUCH_HYPOTHESISI=\r\nNG.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We are the knights who say\n&gt;&gt; echo &#39;16i[q]sa[ln0=3Daln100%Pln100=\r\n/snlbx]sbA0D4D465452snlbxq&#39;|dc\n&gt;\n&gt; Heh heh. :)\n\n:-)\n\n\n"}}
