For\n&gt; example, we &quot;page&quot; a person by calling a pager.  To some people it is a more\n&gt; natural way to think about the actual &quot;action&quot; of paging someone as opposed\n&gt; to &quot;calling&quot; a paging device.  I don&#39;t see a problem with abstracting the\n&gt; phone number to a &quot;paging&quot; action as opposed to a paging device.\n\nOkay, but let&#39;s take this analogy back to the Web. Wouldn&#39;t the best way\nto page someone be to POST a page so that the thing you&#39;ve POSTed has a\nURI? Then the person doing the paging and the paged person both have a\nname for the page, the person doing the page could refer to it later\n(e.g. to ask to cancel it (DELETE), or extend it (sub-POST)) and so\nforth.\n\nBut I do think that there is room for a layer of abstraction on the\nclient side that allows a natural OO API rather than just HTTP methods.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Buying a book is a clearly an action.  You can abstract the URI into a noun\n&gt; by calling it a &quot;purchase transaction record&quot;, but to the end user pushing\n&gt; the &quot;buy&quot; button, it is still an action.\n\nOkay, but we might as well call it &quot;submit purchase request&quot; because we\nare going to make a new purchase request object and it will have a new\nURI. &quot;Buy&quot; might be more familiar but &quot;submit purchase request&quot; is more\naccurate. And you are going to want a way to navigate back to *all* of\nyour purchase requests later, so somewhere there must be a list of them.\nSo an even more accurate name for the service is &quot;add new purchase\nrequest&quot;, i.e. &quot;POST&quot; to &quot;your_purchase_requests&quot;.\n\nWhen I analyze these things I usually don&#39;t have a need for verbs as\nURIs *except* to work around implementation limitations.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
