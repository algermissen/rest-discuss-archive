But there might be cases\n&gt;  &gt; where you have to model non-CRUD operations in your REST system - and\n&gt;  &gt; not all reasons are technical. You customers are used to a certain\n&gt;  &gt; vocabulary which contains well-known and well-accepted verbs and you\n&gt;  &gt; simply can&#39;t change them to fit the &quot;resource&quot; paradigm.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; So given this constraint that you absolutely must have non-standard\n&gt;  &gt; verbs, what&#39;s the best way to model them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan Tilkov dealt somewhat with the CRUD issue in his blog comment,\n&gt; so I&#39;ll come at this from a different angle:\n&gt; \n&gt; What vocabulary do you really have in mind? You mentioned &quot;walk&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;talk&quot; in your blog entry, but I got the impression that those were\n&gt; made-up examples. Any discussion might be more more useful if we\n&gt; considered the real problem.\n\nSome examples:\n\n  - any Plone URLs ending in /edit or /view\n\n  - Atom protocol &quot;edit&quot; URIs.\n\n  - MoinMoin ?action= URLs\n\n  - Zimbra export URLs (URL per format)\n\n  - citizensinformation.ie  /entry.xml URLs (Atom URLs)\n\nFwiw, I don&#39;t buy this:\n\n&quot;You customers are used to a certain vocabulary which contains \nwell-known and well-accepted verbs&quot;\n\nit&#39;s usually the framework designers that are making you do this not \ncustomers (eg most Java frameworks are action/controller based). Take \nthe frameworks away, and then it&#39;s DSL and Domain Model aficionados \ndesigning things in a certain way. Not customers.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
