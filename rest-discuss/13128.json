In particular you should keep in mind that U=\r\nRIs identify things, not actions. You might want to read a good tutorial or=\r\n book on REST. You&#39;ll see that what you describe can be achieved using the =\r\nHTTP methods (GET, PUT, ...).\n\nPhilippe Mougin\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Eben Roux&quot; &lt;eben.roux@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new to=\r\n this group.  Posted this question on the DDD group but someone pointed me =\r\nhere.  Now who would think that there would be a whole group focusing on RE=\r\nST :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Right!\n&gt; \n&gt; Every once-in-a-while a take another look at somethi=\r\nng just to refresh / improve my understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I had another good l=\r\nook at REST --- on wikipedia.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I&#39;m thinking I had my idea of RES=\r\nT somewhat wonky. Using the correct way the following happes:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://d=\r\nomain/cars --&gt; returns ALL cars\n&gt; http://domain/cars/abc123 --&gt; returns car=\r\n details with id abc123\n&gt; \n&gt; so the &#39;format&#39; is domain/{collection}/{id}\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Now if there are 40 gazillion cars it would be silly returning the whole=\r\n lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there is no bahaviour built in other than the HTTP GET, POST,=\r\n PUT, DELETE; not much behaviour at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; When looking at MVC and what =\r\ncan be done with routing it makes more sense (to me, anyway):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://d=\r\nomain/{aggregate}/{action}/{id}\n&gt; \n&gt; so:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://domain/cars/find --&gt; p=\r\nost a search request\n&gt; http://domain/cars/list --&gt; returns SEARCH result\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://domain/cars/new --&gt; starts a new car registration\n&gt; http://domain/ca=\r\nrs/create ---&gt; post a create request\n&gt; http://domain/cars/show/abc123 --&gt; r=\r\neturns car details with id abc123\n&gt; http://domain/cars/declareunroadworthy/=\r\nabc123 --&gt; car with id abc123 set to unroadworthy\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this still REST. =\r\nThere may be session state on the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe this is Representation=\r\nal Intent or something to that effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Eben\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
