Lost my try at this to a mailer crash. :(\n\nOkay, let&#39;s first define transactions in the context of this discussion\nbecause people often mean different things. You do not mean transaction\nin the sense of requiring &quot;a group of operations on (distributed)\nresources be treated as one unit of work. In a unit of work, all the\nparticipating operations should either succeed or fail and recover\ntogether.&quot; \n\n*\nhttp://www.subrahmanyam.com/articles/transactions/NutsAndBoltsOfTP.html\n\nRather you mean transaction in the business sense, which is an agreement\nto exchange services, products or money.\n\nNow thinking about this from an XP perspective, I want to think about\nthe simplest thing and see why it won&#39;t work. The simplest thing is for\nme to send you an &quot;offer&quot; message and you reply with &quot;accept&quot; or\n&quot;decline&quot;. That&#39;s not good enough, however, because deciding whether to\naccept may take a long time. So it is necessary for the exchange to be\nbroken into two parts: &quot;request service&quot; and then at some indeterminate\ntime later, &quot;provide response&quot;. In other words there are four messages: \n\nbhaugen32 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a two-party request-response interaction, with receipt\n&gt; acknowledgements for both request and response.\n\n&quot;Can we do business?&quot;\n&quot;I acknowledge that you want to do business. I will get back to you.&quot;\n&quot;I agree/disagree we should do business.&quot;\n&quot;I acknowledge your agreement/disagreement.&quot;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; There are time constraints on each step.  If any timeout occurs, the\n&gt; transaction fails with a Control Failure.\n\nNote that in the absence of reliable transport it is still possible for\nthe businesses to end up misaligned. An HTTP-based solution needs to use\nHTTP in a manner that will ensure reliability.\n\n&gt; In cases where the Response document says &quot;Accept&quot; but has an error,\n&gt; and the error message from the requesting business service cannot be\n&gt; delivered, the transaction model specifies a separate Notification of\n&gt; Failure to be sent from the requesting business service via another\n&gt; channel.  Otherwise the responding activity may think incorrectly\n&gt; that the transaction succeeded.\n\nI see, so otherwise it is to assume the transaction succeeded if it\nreturns an Accept, whether it gets a receipt or not?\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Replace the business service access points with resources\n&gt; representing the business entity being offered, for example the\n&gt; Order.  (Alternatively, each transaction might become a sub-resource\n&gt; under the Order.)\n&gt; \n&gt; RosettaNet and ebXML assume that a business service access point will\n&gt; handle many transactions for many business activities, so each\n&gt; message contains tags for dispatching to the business collaboration\n&gt; (long conversation about the Order), business transaction, and\n&gt; business activity.\n\nYou&#39;ll have to describe why all of these levels of statefulness are\nnecessary. And if you want to represent them in REST then you should\ngive them all URIs and point to them.\n\n&gt; If the resource is the Order, then only the business transaction and\n&gt; business activity tags are required.\n&gt; If the resource is the Transaction, then the business activity can be\n&gt; assumed.\n\nSounds stateful. Better to use references.\n\n&gt; In either case, I think the REST style is functionally equivalent to\n&gt; the EDI-mailbox style, but has at least two advantages:\n\nBefore I feel comfortable that this has been expressed in a REST style,\nI&#39;d like to see some URIs, XML and HTTP methods. ;)\n\nI propose that what you will need is at least two HTTP request/response\npairs, one in each direction. To get reliability, though, you probably\nactually need four, as I discuss here:\n\n * http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html\n\nSo you would \n\t-&gt; POST: &quot;I&#39;d like to make an offer&quot;\n\t&lt;- OK, here&#39;s an offer-holder URI\n\t-&gt; PUT the offer at offer-holder URI\n\t&lt;- OK, I&#39;ve received it and will get back to you\n\nThe offer should have a callback address, unless you are using something\nlike HTTP events. Either way,\n\n\t&lt;- POST &quot;I&#39;d like to return a reliable offer-response&quot;\n\t-&gt; OK, here&#39;s an offer-response-holder URI\n\t&lt;- PUT the offer-response at the holder-URI\n\t-&gt; OK, I&#39;ve got the offer-response\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
