I have no problem using content negotiation if that is \n&gt;&gt;accepted way to accomplish the requirements, I do tend to view content \n&gt;&gt;negotiation as a feature that has not been developed in a consistent way \n&gt;&gt;so I tend to be fearful of going in that direction but hey I am fairly \n&gt;&gt;new to all of this.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t understand your argument about content-neg. It works very\n&gt;well... you can do very tight accepts (mostly in webservice clients\n&gt;and servers) or you can do very lose accepts (like in browsers).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Any other way of achieving what you&#39;re trying to achieve would seem to\n&gt;be inconsistent with the HTTP specs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nic\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNic,\n\nThanks, I really wasn&#39;t making an argument, just an observation (based \non my current knowledge/experience) but I do accept that for web \nservices content-neg is absolutely the way to go because you have tight \ncontrol of media-ranges you can specify. My desire was to obtain a \nlittle more tightness on the browser end (mainly for web designers \ncreating visual experiences) than I was seeing I could get from the \nheaders being sent, but I think in the specific cases I need to be tight \nI can handle that without relying on content negotiation and still be \nconsistent with Restful design principals because in this case I should \ndefine a different resource with it&#39;s own representation\n\nBTW I found this to be an interesting read related to this subject\n\nhttp://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/06/08/restful.html\n\nIt helped clarify things for me anyway\n\nthanks\n\nJeff\n\n\n"}}
