Does a tension\n&gt; arise between them?\n\nCapabilities and hyperlinks go together like peas in a pod. The\naction of clicking a hyperlink on a previously received page, to\nget another page, is exactly the style of interaction that use of\ncapabilities is modelled on.\n\nAs a simple example of this, consider the Accountant resource at:\n\nhttps://www.waterken.com/coffeebreak/6gjz7l6fnoxlbikw7akqgxhrsy.html\n\n(Note: www.waterken.com is using a self-signed certificate with\nSHA1 fingerprint:\n28:B5:86:C5:76:AE:9F:9D:DA:1D:8F:32:3B:1A:E5:FF:B2:AF:1B:F3)\n\n&gt; E.g. wouldn&#39;t a capability container resource\n&gt; necessarily give you capabilities for all of the contained resources?\n\nYes, as is demonstrated in the example above. Typically, I don&#39;t\nthink of this in terms of containers, but in terms of what\nresources are reachable from a given resource.\n\n&gt; What about navigating networks (graphs) of hyperlinks?\n\nThe graph of hyperlinks is how your define your application&#39;s\nsecurity policy. At runtime, users traverse the graph, or\nresource web, that is your application. In this way, the graph\nsimultaneously defines and enforces your access policy.\n\n&gt; * Do capabilities and digital signatures (e.g. for non-repudiation)\n&gt; go together?  I don&#39;t see why not.  If I understand correctly,\n&gt; access is not dependent on your identity (only that you possess\n&gt; the capability URI).\n\nCapabilities and digital signatures do not typically go together.\nYou nailed it with your first guess: capabilities are not identity\nbased, whereas digital signatures are.  Use of a digital signature\nimplicitly means that your security model is identity-based, ie:\nthe signature is done by some principal.\n\nThere are simple capability graph patterns that can be used to\nsolve most problems that people use digital signatures for.\nNon-repudiation is not one of these. The crux of non-repudiation\nbased on a digital signature is that the client possesses a\nprivate key that no one else does. Capabilities themselves do not\nprovide a similar cryptographic primitive.\n\nThat said, I doubt the value of digital signature based\nnon-repudiation. I very much doubt it is something you could take\nto court, and if you can&#39;t, what&#39;s the point. Unless you are also\ngoing to deploy a new legal court system, digital signatures don&#39;t\nmake much sense.\n\n&gt; But your identity is still significant in other ways.\n\nActually, when you get right down to specific scenarios, identity\nis more of a problem than a requirement. Using an identity-based\nsecurity model opens you up to the Confused Deputy attack. See:\n\nhttp://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/ConfusedDeputy.html\n\n&gt; * Has anybody used capabilities and access control lists based on\n&gt; identity together?\n\nI think Agorics Inc. implemented an MLS system on top of KeyKOS, a\ncapability-based operating system. They did this solely to satisfy\nthe demands of a government contract.\n\n&gt; Do you think that is a bad idea, or useful in\n&gt; some situations?  Which situations?\n\nPeople always seem to want to pile security devices on top of each\nother, but in this case, it doesn&#39;t make much sense.\n\n&gt; * Open-ended, sorry:  what are the disadvantages of capability URIs?\n\nThe main problem with capabilities is one of perception rather\nthan fact. In the capability model, it is only possible to express\nsecurity policies that are actually enforceable. In contrast, the\nACL security model allows, even encourages, expression of security\npolicies that are not actually enforceable. As a result, people\noften happily accept the false promises of an ACL and are annoyed\nthat the capability model won&#39;t tell them similarly comforting\nlies.\n\nWe went through an example of this during the last discussion of\ncapabilities on this list. See the thread root at:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3456\n\n&gt; Thanks, interesting stuff,\n\nThanks. I look forward to continuing this discussion.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
