TM already h=\r\nas all the concepts key to REST incorporated into the language. \n\nThe probl=\r\nems I see with it are:\n\n* Its XML serialization is VERY verbose (there is a=\r\n more terse text serialization though).\n* I&#39;m not sure how many FOSS librar=\r\nies there are for it (TM is a standard for many governments so I think ther=\r\ne are some that are well written). \n\nBut I know that I could use it to buil=\r\nd a (nearly) arbitrarily complex self-coding system from it (at least withi=\r\nn the bounds of the types of systems we build with REST constraints)\n\nThoug=\r\nhts?\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
