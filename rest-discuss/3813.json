My \n&gt; personal\n&gt; view is that ReST is sufficiently semantically incoherent so you can \n&gt; go in\n&gt; whatever direction you like.  Try reading Roy&#39;s dissertation and \n&gt; figuring\n&gt; out the exact meaning of resource and representation in his paper and\n&gt; you&#39;ll see what I mean.\n\nWell, now that&#39;s a completely clueless statement.  The point of the\ndefinitions is that the interface does not define the exact meaning,\nleaving meaning to be defined by the nature of the links between\nthe information.  A server does the interpolation between the contents\nof a PUT and the model hidden behind the server -- saying that isn&#39;t\ndefined by REST is just goofy.  I have no problems building PUT,\ncontainers, or any of the other things that you claim are not defined\nby REST, since those are implementation details that are defined within\nHTTP by the origin server and not by the client.  I don&#39;t even need to\nuse webdav, though it has its definitions as well.  The only problems\nI run into are buggy browsers that never managed to implement basic\nHTTP correctly, let alone the advanced features.\n\nIf you don&#39;t like the generic interface, then just implement a\ndistributed file system.  That has all the features you are looking\nfor in a concrete model.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
