Nor is it ideal to expect a client to be able to \n&gt; handle error codes on a per server basis (think what it would be \n&gt; like if RSS used schema validation). You really want to pick one \n&gt; code - or have HTTP extended to deal with this use case.\n\nI picked &quot;403 Forbidden&quot; as the response code for invalid input for my\napplication. It seemed to match the meaning of the request, which was\n&quot;Please do X with this data&quot; and as the data is invalid the server says\n&quot;No&quot;, which in HTTP is a 403 response. The *reason* the server said no has\nto be indicated in the body of the response in HTML or RDF or whatever is\nappropriate.\n\nIn fact the more I think about it, the more that 403 seems like the right\nchoice. Quoting the spec:\n\n\tThe server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it \n\t... the request SHOULD NOT be repeated ... it SHOULD describe the \n\treason for the refusal in the entity\n\nIt could be worth changing the status message for 403 from &quot;Forbidden&quot; to\n&quot;No&quot;, to make it clearer that it&#39;s not necessarily an access permission\nissue.\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
