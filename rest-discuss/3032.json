We&#39;re all aware of the issues of XML-RPC based interfaces --\nit was just discussed a few weeks ago.\n\nIt seems if ever there was a tool/medium that needed a RESTful API\nit&#39;s weblogging.\n\nJoe Gregorio has been developing a prototype with such an API and made\nthis post for feedback. (My response never made it to the list however\nI did make a weblog post.[1]) It&#39;s been nearly a month since this\npost\nwas made and now seems like an appropriate time to raise it again.\n\nJoe and I have been continuing to discuss the notion in private\nemails. Rather then debate amongst ourselves, Joe and I opened a\nmailing list for a community discussion of web service interfaces\nusing REST for enabling collaborative authoring and content tools\nbased. Some examples of existing initiatives that would be an\nappropriate topic for discussion include (but are not limited to)\nRESTLog, Extremely Simple Syndication (XSS) format and TrackBack. All\nare welcome and encouraged to join the discussion.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ucapi-discuss/\n\n&lt;tim/&gt;\n\n[1] http://www.mplode.com/tima/archives/000153.html\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Joe Gregorio &lt;joe@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am working on a REST based weblog interface, described here:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://wellformedweb.org/RESTLog.cgi/5\n&gt; \n&gt; the design of which is heavily influenced by:\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestifyingBlogger\n&gt; \n&gt; Before I get too far along I want to make \n&gt; sure I haven&#39;t wandered off into the weeds.\n&gt; Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThanks,\n&gt; \t-joe\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://BitWorking.org\n&gt; http://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n"}}
