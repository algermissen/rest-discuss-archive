E.g., if a client wants an HTML\n&gt; version in Spanish of /news/40, the server sends this and adds\n&gt; Content-Location: /news/40.es.html\n&gt; \n&gt; But how can we get to the original, unnegotiated URI\n&gt; from /news/40.es.html?\n&gt; \n\nBy using 303 redirects and cookies...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The authors of &quot;RESTful Web Services&quot; argue in the errata [1] that\n&gt; there is no inverse: &quot;There ought to be an HTTP method [sic] that is\n&gt; the opposite of Content-Location, but that&#39;s too big a project to\n&gt; undertake in this venue.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t know about that.  Try my demo, date/title links and the View\nmenu work:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/conneg/\n\nIf you disable cookies, the system still works but there&#39;s no override\nof conneg, so you may not get the variant you request; 303 makes no\nsuch promise, which is why I chose it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently, Google started listening to rel=&quot;canonical&quot; Link headers\n&gt; [2], which they propose for different content types. However, is this\n&gt; a) an acceptable &quot;standard&quot; solution and b) can this be used for\n&gt; other differentiations (language etc.) as well?\n&gt; \n\nAs to a), googlish benificence has already begat #!, making it a de-\nfacto standard whether it&#39;s acceptable on technical merit or not.  :-)\n\nAs to b), I can&#39;t answer for how Google will interpret it, but I would\nsay limit the semantics of rel=&#39;canonical&#39; to the other case on [2]:\n\n&quot;Another common situation in which rel=&#39;canonical&#39; HTTP headers may\nhelp is when a website serves the same file from multiple URLs (for\nexample when using a content distribution network) and the webmaster\nwishes to signal to Google the preferred URL.&quot;\n\nFor the variants on my demo, which includes a polyglot document, which\nis canonical -- the XHTML served as text/html or that same XHTML served\nas application/xhtml+xml?  For the case of pointing an alias which\nresponds 200, to a canonical URL for that resource, I have no problem\nwith rel=&#39;canonical&#39; but see using it on conneg variants (based on 200,\nnot redirects) as an overload.\n\nIOW, it makes sense for different-language variants, which are mostly\nimplemented with 301 redirects on conneg, not 200 responses.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the best way to point from a representation-specific URI to a\n&gt; representation-agnostic URI?\n&gt; \n\nAfter wrangling with this very problem for some time, I was able to\nwrite working code based around 303 redirects and application-state-\nagnostic cookies.  Google figured out my demo just fine, before I\ncreated the robots.txt file.  I don&#39;t know the &quot;best&quot; way, only the way\nwhich made sense to me and works in practice.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
