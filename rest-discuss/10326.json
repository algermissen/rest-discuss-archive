Ditto for your boss.\n\nIt sounds like you don&#39;t have the rig=\r\nht people on your team in\norder to make this project successful.  I&#39;m not s=\r\nure how important\nwhat you&#39;re doing is - maybe you can afford to make major=\r\n blunders\nalong the way while you&#39;re learning.  But from a business perspec=\r\ntive,\nit doesn&#39;t sound like you have the &quot;right people on the bus&quot;, as Jim\n=\r\nCollins might say.\n\nI read quickly your posts and tried to get an understan=\r\nding of what\nit is you are trying to do, and I&#39;m still not entirely clear. =\r\n But, this little\nbit says a lot :\n\n&gt;We are going to use, for sure, at leas=\r\nt HTTP, JMS, POP and FTP. And for\n&gt; all those I have to have Monitoring and=\r\n Traceability. So I don&#39;t see how \n&gt; can I have this without a centralized =\r\npiece of software, either a ESB or \n&gt; at least some kind of Queue (ActiveMQ=\r\n maybe).\n\nMy first recommendation is to hire someone from the outside to co=\r\nme\nin and look at what you are trying to do and make some recommendations.\n=\r\nThe amount of information you&#39;ve given us is a good start, but it really\nre=\r\nquires more than just a few postings on a message board to figure out\nexact=\r\nly what solution is best for you. What are all these services, what are\nthe=\r\ny doing, why do you want them to be unified in any way, what&#39;s the\nbusiness=\r\n goal?\n\nSeveral different solutions come to my mind from what I&#39;ve read so\n=\r\nfar of your posts, and there isn&#39;t a good way to distinguish between\nthem (=\r\nor others) without some kind of long-running\nconversation.\n\nBasic goal of a=\r\nny system :\n\n1.  Keep it simple.  Simple things tend to work, and \n     rea=\r\nlly simple things tend to work really well. (Adam Bosworth)\n\nIn my mind, RE=\r\nST and HTTP are pretty simple.  The internet works.  Just about\nany languag=\r\ne can consume HTTP services, Atom or RSS feeds, XML messages.\nStart with th=\r\nose things and see how far you get.\n\nTracing and monitoring of web sites is=\r\n pretty clear, as others have said.  There\nare lots of open source tools to=\r\n do such things.  Take a look at \nhttp://www.tildeslash.com/monit/ for one =\r\nsuch tool.\n\nYou can have distributed traceability, each system uses a loggi=\r\nng package\nwhich logs to a central database, or better yet (in some ways) h=\r\nave\neach process/service provide an atom feed of log entries which\nare then=\r\n consolidated in a single stream by an aggregator.\n\nIf your systems are cri=\r\ntical and performance and uptime are very important,\nyou may want some othe=\r\nr kind of solution - like coding as much as\npossible in Erlang over a distr=\r\nibuted network.  Erlang has a great history\nwith building fault-tolerant di=\r\nstributed systems, has failure notification\nof processes built-in, and many=\r\n other things.\n\nAn important part of REST is providing a uniform interface =\r\nto all services.\nIf you are dealing with many types of different protocols,=\r\n FTP,\nPOP, HTTP, etc.. you should consider providing a uniform and well-und=\r\nerstood\nway of accessing *all* of those using the same interface or protoco=\r\nl.\n\nYou may want to look at the 9P (or Styx) protocol which is in heavy use=\r\n\nin Plan 9 and Inferno.  It is accidentally very RESTful.  Look for Plan 9\n=\r\ndocuments on 9P or Inferno Styx.  For Java, you will\nfind JStyx : \n\nhttp://=\r\nwww.resc.rdg.ac.uk/jstyx/\n\nYou could also possibly configure all your serve=\r\nrs as grid processes and\nuse grid tools for monitoring and tracing, and per=\r\nhaps workflow if\nyou need it.  Grids give you a central way to deploy, exec=\r\nute, and monitor\na variety of processes.  You&#39;ll find some grid information=\r\n on that \nJStyx site, and also on the Inferno page. \n\nhttp://www.vitanuova.=\r\ncom/grid/\n\nThis also brings to mind the Microsoft Robotics Platform, which =\r\nis very\nRESTful, and could allow you to control and montitor your processes=\r\n as\nwell.  Probably that&#39;s too much of a stretch for a Java-based team, and=\r\n\nthe Platform takes a bit of digging into.\n\nAs a final note, it&#39;s my opinio=\r\nn that ESB products are not needed (usually), stick\nto commonly used protoc=\r\nols and data formats.  As a final, final note,\nREST doesn&#39;t solve every pro=\r\nblem elegantly, and neither does anything\nelse - it depends on the problem.=\r\n  I just don&#39;t know your problem well\nenough to recommend one architecture =\r\nover another.  \n\nBut, I would put forth that you use REST as a starting poi=\r\nnt and \nrule it out when you find some aspect of the problem that doesn&#39;t\nf=\r\nit within it&#39;s contraints.\n\nCheers,\n-d-\n\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, amsmota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Following my other post about REST + =\r\nESB (or should I say REST _minus_ \n&gt; ESB), I started looking for resources =\r\nabout creating RESTfull services \n&gt; with endpoints not based on HTTP, but I=\r\n couldn&#39;t find any.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mainly, all the resources I&#39;ve seen so far says so=\r\nmething like &quot;REST is \n&gt; protocol independent, but for the sake of simplici=\r\nty let&#39;s talk about \n&gt; HTTP only&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; My plan now was to try to convinc=\r\ne my team leader to give me 1.5 week so \n&gt; I can write a very simple applic=\r\nation (probably in Java) and enable it \n&gt; to be invoked directly by two dif=\r\nferent kind of connectors (HTTP and \n&gt; email probably). And then try to do =\r\nthe same with (probably) Mule in the \n&gt; middle. And see what&#39;s simpler.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; So I know how to do it with HTTP (actually several ways come to my mind) =\r\n\n&gt; and I know how I&#39;ll do it from some of the other protocols if it was RPC=\r\n \n&gt; app, or a intra-VM app, but I can&#39;t understand how to do it in a \n&gt; RES=\r\nTfull way and without a ESB.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably I&#39;m not seeing this right and pr=\r\nobably the best solution *is* \n&gt; to use a ESB?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks all for your coo=\r\nperation.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
