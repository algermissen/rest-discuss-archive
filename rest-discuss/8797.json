Today it&#39;s\none single form with all the values, tomorrow it&#39;s a three-step form.\nFrom one URI to three.\n\nAny clients generated by an IDL against the first single version of\nthe form will promptly break.\n\nThe IDL strategy to preventing upgrade failures is to now provide two\nservices, one that conforms to the published IDL and another that is\nevolved. Maintaining two entry points to a service is expensive and\nthis example change shouldn&#39;t cause such an expensive undertaking.\n\nInstead of even trying to &quot;fix&quot; the URI, we should use a data driven\napproach that enables machine agents to\na) follow hypermedia state changes dynamically, and\nb) choose between different links and forms on a page.\n\nInstead of IDL that defined fixed URI&#39;s for say, logout, addItem, and\ncheckout, the agreement between client and server would be a shared\ndata type(s). The machine agent would pick the &lt;form&gt; that had\nclass=&quot;checkout&quot; instead of the one with class=&quot;logout&quot;, fill in any\nvalues it recognized, and submit it. The response page would either\nhave a success data value, a failure data value, or another &lt;form\nclass=&quot;checkout&quot;&gt; that should be followed.\n\nProtocol as data, not interface.\n\nJohn Heintz\nhttp://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2007/05/does-rest-need-dl.html\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/4/07, Steve Loughran &lt;steve.loughran.soapbuilders@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Interesting bit of pushback on WADL from Dare Obsanjano:\n&gt; http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=f88dc5a6-0aff-44ca-ba42-38c651612092\n&gt;\n&gt; He argues that XSD mapping to native is code (and back) is a source of\n&gt; many problems, so if WADL encourages you to use XSD for a type system,\n&gt; then you&#39;ve made a wrong turn already.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I have to concur about the XSD side of things, it is something\n&gt; to strongly discourage. Given the number of existing WADL documents to\n&gt; be compatible with is zero, it may be time to push for it to be\n&gt; relax-ng *only*. That is, if you expect WADL and the corresponding\n&gt; types to be handwritten. If instead they get generated from some\n&gt; service interface, then you are back in the same mess that we got from\n&gt; reverse-engineered WSDL files.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone tried to write a WADL description for any modern service,\n&gt; like Amazon EC2 REST API?\n&gt;\n&gt; -steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
