My understanding was that  \nGET is &quot;safe,&quot; but not necessarily idempotent. Returning a new ID  \neach time you do a GET seems plenty safe to me. People used to do  \nthat all the time when they put a &quot;This page has been views N time&quot;  \ncounters on their pages. And can&#39;t you simply put a cache-control  \nheader that says don&#39;t cache and must revalidate to prevent people  \ngetting duplicate IDs? If someone backs up with the back button on a  \nbrowser, they might attempt the same ID twice, but I believe  \ndetecting that is the point of the proposal--i.e., to prevent the  \nsame thing from being posted twice.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
