The problem I&#39;ve just encountered is regarding\n&gt; the best way to design my URI for data that is a subset of the parent\n&gt; resource and can be filtered by multiple parameters.\n\nExcellent, right on time with the latest discussions.. :) Well, here&#39;s\nwhat I do ;\n\n&gt; My first (probably not very restful idea) was to create something like:\n&gt; /books?category=scifi&year=2008\n\nYou need to think about why you think that isn&#39;t RESTful, because\nthere is nothing in it which ain&#39;t REST-friendly. It looks like a\nresource (a list of all books) being queried / filtered for its\ncontents.\n\n&gt; But this makes it seem like one category is a child of year or vice\n&gt; versa which isn&#39;t correct. Plus as I add filters I&#39;d need all sorts\n&gt; of combinations.\n\nI tend to think in terms of resource orientation that lists/containers\nand things/objects are the main resources, and that any filtering or\noperational comes in as parameters, so with your example;\n\nhttp://example.com/books?category=scifi&year=2008\n\nAnd I use URIs as aliases for those filters if I think it benefits the\napplication (and makes it easier for me to develop) ;\n\nhttp://example.com/books/2008\nhttp://example.com/books/2008/scifi\nhttp://example.com/books/scifi\n\nSome might look into ;\n\nhttp://example.com/books/2008?category=scifi\nhttp://example.com/books/scifi?year=2008\n\nThis works fine, too. To work out whether to use non-parametrized or\nparametrized URIs I tend to think that non-parametrized URIs works\ngreat where you know the URI is static in that many will use that URI\nspecifically. For example, lots of people would want books from 2008,\nbut fewer would ask for books from 1814 in the category of\n&quot;political&quot;. I&#39;d use static URI for the former, and parametrized for\nthe latter, but there&#39;s no right or wrong here.\n\nI think should cover what you want to do. When dealing with these I\ntend to ask what are the larger things (and put them to the left) and\nwhat are the smaller things (towards the left). With that, a year is\nmore generic than scifi which is a genre. (I know you can say there&#39;s\nmore scifi ever written than what fits into everything that goes into\na year, although I don&#39;t think that is true nor able to be proven ...\n:)\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
