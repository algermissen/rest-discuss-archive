[2007-11-07 04:00]:\n&gt; &gt; In large part, though, isn&#39;=\r\nt REST *about* the details of\n&gt; &gt; implementing HTTP?\n&gt;\n&gt; Err, there is a bi=\r\nt of confusion here.\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, mostly we=E2=80=99re talking about h=\r\now to *use* HTTP, not\n&gt; how to implement it; at least I doubt that the majo=\r\nrity of people\n&gt; on this list is concerned about the best way to open socke=\r\nts and\n&gt; poll them, parse headers, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if we move past that niggl=\r\ning point, though, casting the\n&gt; question instead as =E2=80=9Cin large part=\r\n, though, isn&#39;t REST *about*\n&gt; the details of using HTTP?=E2=80=9D, then th=\r\nis still isn=E2=80=99t\nright. REST\n&gt; is an architectural style =E2=80&quot; it=\r\n=E2=80=99s *two* abstractions\nremoved from\n&gt; actual applications. (One too =\r\nmany for most people, as Roy often\n&gt; remarks in saying that.) HTTP is an ar=\r\nchitecture; one level of\n&gt; abstraction closer.\n&gt;\n&gt; So if anything, it would=\r\n have to be the other way around:\n&gt;\n&gt; Using HTTP well is largely about doin=\r\ng representational state\n&gt; transfer.\n&gt;\n&gt; But there are aspects to using HTT=\r\nP well (such as ETags and\n&gt; friends) that don=E2=80=99t really have anythin=\r\ng to do with REST at all\n&gt; (in any deeper sense than that more RESTful syst=\r\nems potentially\n&gt; benefit more from them).\n&gt;\n&gt; And coming back to the origi=\r\nnal question: URI design =E2=80&quot; or, more\n&gt; broadly stated, address design =\r\n=E2=80&quot; is orthogonal to the transfer\n&gt; of state via representations. If yo=\r\nu put all your emphasis on\n&gt; addresses, you get REST/RPC hybrids. Represent=\r\national state\n&gt; transfer is all about representations, as the name implies,=\r\n\n&gt; not about addresses.\n&gt;\n&gt; All that said:\n&gt;\n&gt; I personally don=E2=80=99t m=\r\nind any of these topics on this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltz=\r\nis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
