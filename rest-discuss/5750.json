For instance, if you type in \n&gt; /http://example.com/, most servers will look for and return a &quot;default \n&gt; document&quot; such as /index.html/.  \n\nNothing wrong with that. The server needs some config to explain to it\nhow to represent a directory resource.\n\n\n&gt; Is the privacy policy (p3p) part of that?  I would not say &quot;this privacy \n&gt; policy represents the all of the other pages on my site&quot;, rather &quot;this \n&gt; privacy policy represents my site&quot;.  As a result, it is appropriate to \n&gt; be returned via my site URI (/http://example.com/).\n\nI think we&#39;ve been over this ground.\n\nEither one accepts that a _site_ can be referred to with a URI or you\ndon&#39;t. \n\nIf you accept that it can then content negotiation for the\nrepresentation of the _site_ resource is possible. \n\nIf you don&#39;t accept that idiom then it can&#39;t.\n\nWe&#39;re not going to change either robots.txt or the p3p or the favicon\nanytime soon. But you and I can start using content negotiation\nredirected from the specific resource if we like.\n\n\n&gt; To sum it all up, content types (and negotiation) can be used in a \n&gt; perfectly RESTful manner.   Further, I think it could improve the \n&gt; current state of the web.  However, we are bringing along much baggage, \n&gt; which makes this difficult.  It also requires people to take on and \n&gt; embrace the notion of resources and representations, which I don&#39;t think \n&gt; many are yet willing to do (or are even aware of the possibility).  \n&gt; Whether this is because it looks like too much work, or because it&#39;s too \n&gt; different, or whatever, is as good your guess as mine.\n\nI think that resource and representation can be quite subtle and\nsometimes subjective.\n\nBut hey, it doesn&#39;t matter much. You and I (and others) can use\ncontent neg and others don&#39;t have to. Maybe if we use it then other\npeople will see the benefits as well.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
