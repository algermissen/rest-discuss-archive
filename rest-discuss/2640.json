Does this change based on\n&gt; the response code being used?  Are some headers considered part of the\n&gt; representation while others are not?\nI believe a client agent needs to understand all of them to understand what\nis and is not the representation.\nFor example, the Content-Type header is metadata /about/ the representation.\nA status code tells you if the entity is even a representation or not. And\nso on.\n\n\n"}}
