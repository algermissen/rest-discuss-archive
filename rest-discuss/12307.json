That is=\r\n, although they might continue to be &quot;fresh,&quot; they do not accurately reflec=\r\nt what the origin server would return for a new request on that resource.&quot;\n=\r\n\nI think this means it is common for an update or delete request yields &quot;no=\r\nn-transparently&quot; invalidation of one or more existing cache entries. \n\nFurt=\r\nher one page 98 \n&quot;There is no way for the HTTP protocol to guarantee that a=\r\nll such cache entries are marked invalid.&quot;\n\nand \n\n&quot;Some HTTP methods MUST c=\r\nause a cache to invalidate an entity. This is either the entity referred to=\r\n by the Request-URI, or by the Location or Content-Location headers (if pre=\r\nsent).&quot;\n\nCan we put many Content-Location headers in a DELETE request? \n\n&quot;I=\r\nn order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the =\r\nURI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST only be performed if the =\r\nhost part is the same as in the Request-URI. &quot;\n\nThen how about invalidating=\r\n the caches after a &quot;batch DELETE&quot; as this &quot;off-the-wall&quot; approach? http://=\r\ntech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12280\n\nSuppose we have a U=\r\nRI that identifies a collection of resources\n\n1. the client sends DELETE UR=\r\nI to the server. The client knows what the URI refers to. \n\n2. the server r=\r\neply with a 200 or 202 with a representation that will send several DELETE&#39;=\r\ns to the server each of which is for a member in the collection. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
