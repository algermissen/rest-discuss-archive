With many organizations, even large one, use the same &quot;Jell-O&quot; model\n&gt; [1] for infrastructure configuration as some companies use for shipping\n&gt; software; when it stops quivering it&#39;s done!\n&gt;\n&gt; OTOH, Nic was speaking about the large organizations where one departments\n&gt; often didn&#39;t care about the concerns of others.\n\nI think Elliotte is correct that we could fix the problem by getting\nthe proxy makers to change their proxies.\n\nHowever, how long would it take to fix the problem. The big\norganization that I was referring to had (amongst others) a Novell\nNetware proxy server. It was at least 10 years old.\n\nI recently made a trip to a medium sized company who were still using\nMicrosoft Proxy Server 1.0. I don&#39;t even want to think about how old\nthat is.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Indeed all you may need to do when a customer tells you your \n&gt;&gt; system seems broken is say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re using proxy X? That&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; broken and non-spec compliant. Use proxy Y instead and all \n&gt;&gt; will be fine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s fine, assuming that information gets to the right person in the\n&gt; company (which is a huge assumption) and that the right person doesn&#39;t have\n&gt; other tasks they view as higher priority (which is another big\n&gt; assumption.)\n\nI agree Mike. It&#39;s often really difficult to find out what is actually\ncausing the problem. Unless you have network access to the client site\nin question it&#39;s almost impossible.\n\nAnd Elliotte&#39;s assertion doesn&#39;t work at all if we&#39;re talking about a\nweb 2.0 business like digg or flikr. If those sites used PUT and it\nfailed for everyone nehind a crappy proxy just how many of those\nfailures would get reported to them?\n\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, only people who are drawn to the technology for personal\n&gt; interest see this as important enough to allow it to affect other factors.\n&gt; For another perspective on this, ask the WHATWG editor Ian Hickson if he\n&gt; thinks browser vendors will support standards that could potentially\n&gt; minimize their marketshare in any way.[2]  Almost no company will be willing\n&gt; to limit it&#39;s marketshare for a technical ideal. The way to achieve the\n&gt; technical ideal on as broad basis as possible is to make that support\n&gt; painless, not by ignoring market realities with the claim that &quot;it is the\n&gt; right thing to do for the greater good.&quot; \n\nSpec compliance happens in the end. It just takes a long time.\n\nOf course, it would help if broken and rubbish implementations didn&#39;t\nget so widespread in the first place. But that&#39;s to do with the\nridiculous amounts of hype that drives our industry.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
