This\n&gt; resource creation often requires authentication. HTTP authentication,\n&gt; which is challenge-response, conflicts with this; if the user POSTs a\n&gt; relatively large resource entity and the server challenges, the\n&gt; entity is lost. What to do in this scenario? How are others solving\n&gt; this problem?\n\nLost? Only if the client discards it before reposting with \nauthentication.\n\nIf it&#39;s a problem keeping a large POST entity around during the \nchallenge-response you could investigate 100 Continue (see RFC 2616 \n8.2.3). The client can add an Accept: 100-continue request header and \npause before generating and sending the request entity. If the POST is \nauthenticated (or no auth is required) the server will respond with a \n100 Continue response and the client can proceed with the request \nentity. OTOH if auth is required the server will respond with a 401 \nUnauthorized and client can terminate the request without ever \ngenerating or sending the request entity.\n\nI believe that server support for 100 Continue is fairly good. \nUnfortunately client support is pretty patchy (I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not \nsupported by the standard Java HTTP client) but clients with support do \nexist. Not sure what the situation is with proxies tho&#39;.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
