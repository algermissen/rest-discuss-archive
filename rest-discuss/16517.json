Let&#39;s  say I register a type =\r\napplication/gatosapato+xml where I&lt;br&gt;&gt; defined &lt;miau&gt; to indicate=\r\n a ...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;No, I think that&#39;s the *last* thing you can expect the=\r\nm to do. =A0The&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nmost you can expect is to be treated as application/x=\r\nml, which in&lt;br&gt;\npractice means that, *if* an intermediary bothers with it =\r\nat all&lt;br&gt;\n(beyond caching, which will be reliable), it will either determi=\r\nne to&lt;br&gt;\ntreat it as HTML or, if that doesn&#39;t work, consider links to =\r\nbe&lt;br&gt;\nXInclude, rdf:about, or XLink. =A0Is that really your processing mod=\r\nel?&lt;br&gt;\nThen how would any intermediary determine that &lt;miau&gt; has any=\r\nthing to&lt;br&gt;\ndo with linking?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBetter, from the sysadmin-at-large-o=\r\nn-the-Web reality of things, to&lt;br&gt;\nsimply ignore your content, if not bloc=\r\nk it as an attempt at tunneling,&lt;br&gt;\nparticularly on PUT or POST. =A0Althou=\r\ngh, anything ending +xml will&lt;br&gt;\nprobably cache OK, but caching is hardly =\r\nthe be-all and end-all of what&lt;br&gt;\nWeb intermediaries do these days.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#500050&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; If not, what is the diference bet=\r\nween a IANA registered&lt;br&gt;&gt; application/gatosapato+xml and a IANA...&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;That still comes down to the goals of your system. =A0If you expect&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n\nGoogle or anyone else to re-use your content in a serendipitous fashi=\r\non&lt;br&gt;\naimed at anarchic scalability, you&#39;ll need to stick with ubiquit=\r\nous&lt;br&gt;\nidentifiers, because it&#39;s unlikely to occur otherwise. =A0You c=\r\nan at&lt;br&gt;\nleast meet the self-descriptive messaging constraint by registeri=\r\nng an&lt;br&gt;\nidentifier, but the one you propose is unlikely to be approved (i=\r\nts&lt;br&gt;\nsyntax is that of the standards tree), the correct syntax would be&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\napplication/vnd.gatosapato+xml, which has a very low bar for approval.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you only care about caching, that would be good enough. =A0But i=\r\nf you&lt;br&gt;\nwant your links understood as links, you&#39;ll need to stick to =\r\nwell-known&lt;br&gt;\nprocessing models, unless you expect your vnd. type to be ad=\r\nopted&lt;br&gt;\nwidely enough to ever be more than a blip on the radar. =A0Again,=\r\n my&lt;br&gt;\ncontext is the Web, not your intranet/extranet -- if the only consu=\r\nmer&lt;br&gt;\nthat you care about is a partner corporation, then you should be us=\r\ning&lt;br&gt;\nHTTPS to traverse the Internet, which makes IANA irrelevant to your=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nneeds.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#888888&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n-Eric&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\r\n--0015175cf80ac7e400048fc96cde--\r\n\n"}}
