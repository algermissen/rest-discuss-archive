I need to\n&gt;&gt; define operations working on multiple resources at the same time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just define a resource that maps to all of the resources you intend\n&gt; to operate upon.  Resources often overlap.\n\nthe service for which we are trying to define a RESTful API should \nhandle in the order of thousands of resources with the following \ncharacteristics:\n\n- lifecycle: resources can be dynamically created by clients and may \nlast from minutes to hours\n- state: each resource has a state, which can be read and modified by \nclients\n\nthe specific need for HTTP operation on multiple resources is about the\nability for clients to query (or update) the state of a list of \nspecified resources (via their ID/URI).\n\ncurrent ideas:\na. resource URI: http://.../resource/IDx\nb. resource state URI: http://.../resource/IDx/state\nc. resource state set URI: \nhttp://.../resource/ID1/state;ID2/state;...;IDn/state\n\nc. can be a possible URI structure for the resource set. We want to \nenable clients to ask for the status of a certain number of resources at \nonce (this is a requirement).\nIn that case, we need to handle the possibility of having many different \nHTTP response code (e.g., some resource may not exist, for others the \nclient may not be authorized).\n\nOur open questions are:\n\n1. is it the proposed URI structure for the resource set a good choice?\n2. for the multi-status code, should we consider what was done in WEBDAV \nwith the 207 status code? Another possibility which is used by other \nREST interfaces is to have the service return a &quot;202 Accepted&quot; status \ncode, and let the HTTP response body contain detailed status \ninformations for each resource (e.g. using an appropriate XML document).\n\n\nthanks in advance, Sergio\n\n\n-- \nSergio Andreozzi\nINFN-CNAF,                    Tel: +39 051 609 2860\nViale Berti Pichat, 6/2       Fax: +39 051 609 2746\n40126 Bologna (Italy)         Web: http://www.cnaf.infn.it/~andreozzi\n\n"}}
