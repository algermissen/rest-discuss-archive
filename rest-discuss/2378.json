You could\nsay that to the extent that you use GET to induce side effects as the main\ndish, to the extent that you use PUT to accomplish non-idempotent work,\netc.,\netc., you are not doing HTTP.\n\nSometimes the work &#39;tunneling&#39; is used as a synonym for &#39;not doing&#39;, while\nbeing a bit more expressive of what&#39;s going on.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 4:09 PM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Resources vs. Representations\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How can the RFC dictate this in the first place?  Isn&#39;t the \n&gt; way that the\n&gt; server chooses to handle/store the actual resource entirely \n&gt; transparent to\n&gt; the protocol as long as subsequent retrieval is identical to \n&gt; what&#39;s posted?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if you were to &quot;relax&quot; the rules of PUT, it seems to me \n&gt; that the only\n&gt; difference at that point between PUT and POST is that one \n&gt; allows the client\n&gt; to give the URI of a created resource while the other does \n&gt; not.  Or am I\n&gt; misundersanding how you want PUT to be fixed?\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Mathews, Walden&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;&#39;Seairth Jacobs&#39;&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;; &quot;rest-discuss&quot;\n&gt; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 3:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [rest-discuss] Resources vs. Representations\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or, how about fixing RFC 2616 so that PUT makes sense for resources\n&gt; &gt; that are powerfully conceptual, as opposed to resources \n&gt; that are &#39;just\n&gt; &gt; documents&#39;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But I like &quot;SET&quot; just fine, too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Walden\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 3:42 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: rest-discuss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Resources vs. Representations\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, PUT&#39;s a bit funny that way.  It&#39;s definined \n&gt; to really mean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;store&quot; more than &quot;set the state&quot;, so it is expected \n&gt; that bits are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preserved.  For this reason, SOAP can&#39;t use PUT (at \n&gt; least how you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect it to be used).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At some point, I&#39;m going to propose a &quot;SET&quot; method that \n&gt; can be used\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; POST could be used for such a thing, but it requires the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-existance of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; request URI.  Instead of suggesting a SET method, how \n&gt; about either:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Relaxing POST to allow the creation of resources, or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Issue an &quot;empty&quot; PUT to create the resource, then follow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a non-empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; POST to set the resource.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
