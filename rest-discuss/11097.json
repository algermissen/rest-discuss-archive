I&#39;m thinking that my case is\nnot very unique and that this is a general topic for REST. (i.e. how\nto embed URLs in URLs - if one can say that).\n\nSo as I&#39;m searching for a hash algorithm that I could use (a client\nshould be able to reverse the hash to get the URL an vice versa), I&#39;m\nthinking that if there was a best practice for doing this in REST,\nthat would be a good thing. E.g. clients could exploit this\ninformation somehow. Does there exist such a &quot;best practice&quot;, or\nshould there be one?\n\nAnd finally; any hash-algorithms that you recommend?\n\nThanks,\n- Erling\n\n"}}
