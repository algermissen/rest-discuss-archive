However, in other languages, such as Objective-C,\n&gt; the instance construction process has two parts: allocation, then\n&gt; initialization.  I&#39;m personally a fan of the latter as it removes the\n&gt; special case of the &quot;constructor&quot; concept.  The less moving parts, the\n&gt; better, imho.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, for REST services, there is a bit of a problem it appears.\n&gt; 1) create a new service A\n&gt; 2) send a initialization message\n&gt; 3) send regular messages\n&gt;\n&gt; Clearly, this stateful.  If a regular message arrives before the\n&gt; initialization message (or, gasp, during), things don&#39;t work as\n&gt; expected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, in case you think this is trivial, let&#39;s assume that during\n&gt; initialization of service A, other services need to be created and\n&gt; they need to interact with service A during initialization.  In other\n&gt; words, service A needs to be reachable before initialization has\n&gt; completed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?  Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Steve\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Steve G.
