I wrote something about it at \nhttp://phprestsql.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html#rest-browser if you&#39;re \ninterested.\n\nataramina wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve always liked the REST approach over SOAP (have used both), but \n&gt; I&#39;ve had an issue with REST when developing new applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is, if you use POST/PUT/DELETE then you can&#39;t easily test your \n&gt; application using a browser alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; One way is to allow GETs to substituted for POST/PUT/DELETEs during \n&gt; development, thought that breaks the REST paradigm (not to mention\n&gt; GET \n&gt; semantics of being side-effect free and idempotent), and doesn&#39;t help \n&gt; you once the app goes into production.\n&gt; \n&gt; So....I&#39;m curious as to how other developers have dealt with this \n&gt; issue?  Any good tools out there that are simple, but allow you to \n&gt; issue HTTP POST/PUT/DELETEs easily?  Or have you written your own \n&gt; testing framework/tools or custom HTML pages to do this when you are \n&gt; testing your invocations?\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate any insight...\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Andrzej\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
