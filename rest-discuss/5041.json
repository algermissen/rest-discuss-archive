For example, to \n&gt; &gt; retrieve BB06 in Plan2 the client would construct this identifier:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; http://[hostname]/mission/plan2/aircraft/BB06 \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://%5Bhostname%5D/mission/plan2/aircraft/BB06&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That would mean that there is some kind of semantic alignment of the \n&gt; hierarchy relationship expressed in the example\n&gt; representation (the semantics being defined in its MIME type) and the \n&gt; (assumed?) hierarchy of path&#39;s in URIs.\n&gt; I doubt that this can be derived from REST. What do others think?\n\nIt seemed to me a fairly clear solution to the problem that Roger posed.\nEspecially since he painted a clear hierarchy of resource information.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Has this Web site exposed too much of its model?  Have I exposed too \n&gt; &gt; much of the rules for constructing resource identifiers?  Will clients \n&gt; &gt; become dangerously coupled?\n&gt; \n&gt; Definitely. Think about how persistent the constructed URIs is, given \n&gt; that it has not been uttered by the server but constructed\n&gt; by the client. If the server changes the hierarchy, the URI becomes sort \n&gt; of meaningless or wrong.\n\nCould I redefine that as &#39;the model has changed&#39;? Implied temporal\ncoupling yes, but change happens. \n\nThat restricts the query response to some (indeterminate) timeframe,\nduring which we rely on the host not to change the structure of the\nwebsite. Seems realistic to me.\n\nregards DaveP\n\n\n\n"}}
