If PUTs have a small advantage over POST then why\n&gt; should we REST-ies spend our valuable moral capital fighting with FORMs\n&gt; peoples etc. over PUT.\n\nThere&#39;s *currently* a small advantage; caching.  There may be a larger\nadvantag\n\n&gt; Well, I&#39;m mostly playing the devil&#39;s advocate\n&gt; because of course fighting for the Right Thing is its own reward. ;)\n&gt; Seriously though, I&#39;d rather have strong arguments in favour of PUT than\n&gt; this one which seems quite weak to me.\n\nI&#39;m not rabid about the need for PUT in XForms.  It wouldn&#39;t be a\nreplacement for having user agents supporting it as a &quot;File-&gt;Save&quot; type\noperation.  I&#39;d see it mostly used for creating new resources, where\nthe content provider could specify the URI for the new resource.\nDevelopers shouldn&#39;t commonly use PUT with XForms to try and replace\nthis missing functionality from user agents.  But hopefully any user\nagent supporting XForms and PUT would go the next step and support\nPUT more generally like Amaya.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
