In the first phase, all participants update their resources\nprovisionally (whether by state or by separate provisional resource),\n2. Upon commit, all participants update their resources in their final\nstate (or create final resources).\n3. Upon abort or cancel, all participants delete their provisional\nresources, or mark them cancelled, or create new cancelled resources.\n\nThe pattern also allows selective commits or cancels, for example for\na bidding process.\n\nIt was implemented in OASIS BTP, which could also be made RESTful\nwithout a lot of work.\nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=business-transaction\n\n"}}
