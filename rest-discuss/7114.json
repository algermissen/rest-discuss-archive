This seems like it would be a very common problem when working\nwith \n&gt;&gt; &gt; REST. \n&gt;&gt; No it&#39;s not - it&#39;s a very common problem dealing with deployed HTTP \n&gt;&gt; technology. If a design/spec says use uniform methods, and people who \n&gt;&gt; implement it ignore it, that&#39;s not a design problem.\n\nNow Bill, no need to get defensive on REST&#39;s account. I wasn&#39;t saying it was\nREST&#39;s fault, just that it seems a common problem with REST. That fact that\nit is also a problem for a superset doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not a problem for\nthe subset.  And if Toyota builds a great SUV that requires special tools to\nbalance its tires correctly yet almost nobody every uses that special tool\nthen I can still say it is a common problem with Toyota 4Runners even though\nthe numnuts balancing the tires are really the ones at fault (can you tell\nI&#39;ve had the problem w/my 4Runner for the 7 years I&#39;ve owned it? ;-)\n\n&gt;&gt; No firestorm - tho&#39; you&#39;re using REST interchangeably with \n&gt;&gt; HTTP interchangeably with deployed HTTP systems. I&#39;ll assume \n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s not a deliberate debating tactic unless I keep seeing you \n&gt;&gt; do it.\n\nIt certainly is not a deliberate debating tactic, it is me trying to make\nsense of things and to also figure out why the state of REST has been\nbugging me so much. But I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading and work offline\nand I think I&#39;m getting a handle on what&#39;s been bugging me and how to\nresolve it.\n\n&gt;&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/WhatIsARESTafarian.aspx \n&gt;&gt; from where I&#39;m standing people are doing their level best here \n&gt;&gt; to answer your questions. That doesn&#39;t help, at all.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where you are going with this. I do appreciate all the help,\nand I am here with the best of intentions, I can assure you of that.\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
