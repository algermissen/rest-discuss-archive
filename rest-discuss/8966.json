I really can&#39;t imagine MS, Sun and IBM accepting\nthat the spec stack now built on top of SOAP should be unwound.\n\nGiven that, is the REST community willing to reformat itself in the\nimage of WS-* ? ... I imagine not.\n\nI look on them as two different tools in the box. Each has strengths\nand weaknesses. I speak as a professional developer, involved in &quot;web\nservices&quot; in the most general sense for the better part of 7 years:\nfrom the pre-WS-* days of POX-over-HTTP, through to WS-* and REST. I\nimplement both WS-* and RESTful services in my professional life -\nselecting technology according to the appropriateness to the task at\nhand.\n\nI don&#39;t see the need for unification or &quot;bringing them together&quot;, any\nmore than I look at a real-world toolbox and think to myself &quot;hmmm ...\nwhat I really want is a more hammer-like screwdriver.&quot;\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
