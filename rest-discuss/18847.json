Additionally to be\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n used as a feed reader, a consumer of the CLI would probably use it\n&gt;&gt; for:=\r\n bookmarking a collection; refreshing bookmarked collections;\n&gt;&gt; using diff=\r\n tools to compare local files and then POSTing the output\n&gt;&gt; content to a c=\r\nollection; etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use=\r\n the client\n&gt;&gt; environment executables files restfully?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I need to acc=\r\ness the diff tools on the client-side system. Does it\n&gt;&gt; fail any constrain=\r\nts the fact that the CLI would try to access the\n&gt;&gt; diff executable tools u=\r\nnder the hood?

What about\n&gt;&gt; code-on-demand instead? The client wo=\r\nuld executes, as an example,\n&gt;&gt; shell scripting fragment depending on the c=\r\nlient environment setup\n&gt;&gt; capabilities. Just like the browser executes Jav=\r\naScript?

But the client and the server will =\r\nmost of the\n&gt;&gt; time be on the same machine or local network. The client nee=\r\nds to\n&gt;&gt; access the file system and do operations on files, which the local=\r\n web\n&gt;&gt; server could do.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any advices?
