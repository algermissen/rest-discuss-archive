Yes, the order has a\n&gt;&gt;vocabulary that must be negotiated, as verbs must be negotiated in an\n&gt;&gt;RPC system. But that doesn&#39;t mean there are verbs in the actual order.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It wasn&#39;t me. 8-)  But, Seth certainly had no qualms putting verbs into the\n&gt; order for attacking an ogre.  I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with\n&gt; that.  BTW, how would you represent an order to attack an ogre without using\n&gt; any verbs?\n\nhehe Right, I believe that Seth The Mighty would have a state of \nRunning, or Attacking.  That is what the object Seth The Mighty is doing \nat that point.\n\nI guess it comes down to object ownership.  My idea of REST is that a \nsystem (X) can request an object (via GET) from system (Y) and receive a \nrepresentation of the state of that object.  That system (X) is then \nallowed to make changes to the object, therefor changing its state.  To \nsave that state, the system (X) then transfers the object back to the \nsystem (Y) it got it from (via PUT) thereby changing its state.\n\nIn the above model, the object can be changed by (X).  (Y) merely \n/reacts/ to any state changes of that object.\n\nIn a verb centric world, where system (X) would explicitly ask system \n(Y) to make Seth The Mighty attack, the object is owned and controlled \nby system (Y).  No objects were transfered, no state traveled across the \nnetwork.  Therefor, no REST.\n\n\n&gt; If the recommendation is to always recast applications verbs into documents,\n&gt; I would suggest that instead of overloading the semantics of the POST verb,\n&gt; we explicitly define a new protocol verb called EXECUTE with its own\n&gt; semantics.  Then it is clear that what we&#39;re doing is sending\n&gt; representations of actions to be executed.\n\nAhh... excelent way to phrase what you are talking about.  While that \nmakes me understand what you want to do (think the Action pattern from \nGoF patterns book) I don&#39;t quite gel with that.  To me, it&#39;s worked out \nmuch better to just move objects around in the space and network.  So \nfar, we&#39;ve been able to have the server do things when objects meet \ncertain states.  It keeps the coupling of our different systems WAY down \n  because now all we have to agree upon is our object hierarchy.  I \ndon&#39;t have to get on the phone and talk through our list of \nactions/methods/etc and the right order to call them in, etc.  I just \nhave to show them a UML diagram and say &quot;You can send me representations \nof these objects.  I&#39;ll do the right thing.&quot;\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
