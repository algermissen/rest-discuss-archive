Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The biggest clash between Old Testament and New right now, seems to be\n&gt; the issue of media type proliferation. On that point, please refer to:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons\n&gt;\n&gt; Notice that Roy&#39;s solution to the problem space is a sparse-bit array.\n&gt; Instead of creating a new media type, Roy&#39;s thought process is to\n&gt; consider what ubiquitous media type may be repurposed to this need.\n&gt; His choice is image/gif. That&#39;s so REST!\n\nIt seems to me the conflict is coming from two distinct visions of computing.\n\nOne vision is to model the world you as you see fit, and make the\nworld work with it. The other is to take the worlds models and make\nyour software work with that.\n\nYour discussion of using HTML is a simple example. You&#39;ve always\nmentioned that before, and I never quite groked how you went about it\nuntil recently. Effectively what you are doing is using semantic, HTML\nmarkup combined with RDFa style annotations to augment the markup, and\nusing that as a representation for your data.\n\nWhen I look at the RFDa primer\n(http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/) it became much clearer to\nme.\n\nBut it still prompted my confusion about identifying the data to the\nsystem, since application/xhtml+xml simply doesn&#39;t tell me, at least,\nenough about how to process the data. But to your point, it does tell\nme what it is, and if it were my standard data type, then I would\nproceed to mine the payload for the interesting attributes.\n\nApparently, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, correct? The XML payload that\nhappens to be XHTML is not processed in total. Rather you dig your\ndata out of it guided by XHTML and RDF annotations.\n\nIf it were some defined XML, I&#39;d be tempted to take the schema,\ngenerated a bunch of JAXB annotations, and have the framework\nmarshal/unmarshal the document to internal Java objects, and\nmanipulate those rather than, perhaps, pull chunks out of the document\nusing a bunch of, say, XPath expressions.\n\nThat&#39;s when the light hit me. Effectively, if your path of approach is\nusing something like XPath as your accessor technique, then the\ndifference between an XML document and an XHTML/RDFa document are the\nactual paths used, but really little else. The RDFa can impose enough\nstructure that static XPath expressions are effective and precise\nenough to get the data you want out of the payloads. Once that\ndecision has been made, XML vs XHTML becomes a bike shed color, and\nit&#39;s easy to see the extra value XHTML provides &quot;for free&quot; over XML.\n\nBut I think it&#39;s clear when you&#39;re model making, and particularly from\na world where binding documents to objects is common, automated, and\n&quot;free&quot;, the XHTML option never comes on the radar. Arguably, it&#39;s not\neven an option at the point. Who wants the complexity of a generic\nXHTML DOM, even if mapped to an Object in the system, to a &quot;simpler&quot;,\nspecific DOM/Mapping.\n\nXHTML also (potentially) loses the value that things like Schema\nvalidation can bring to the table.\n\nNow, technically, you could make a &quot;sub schema&quot;, where your document\nIS XHTML, it&#39;s just a specific subset of it that you (the designer)\nhave decided is enough to represent your data. You can schema this,\npotentially map this (not many mappers do well with XML attributes to\nspecific object slots), etc. &quot;Cake and eat it too&quot;. If the goal of\nXHTML is for those intermediaries (i.e. it&#39;s not for the clients\nbenefit, nor the servers benefit), that can work. But if you go this\nroute, you can&#39;t take &quot;arbitrary&quot; XHTML that happens to have your\ninteresting data embedded within it, since the overall document may\nnot match your subset schema.\n\nBut I don&#39;t think this is contrary to what you&#39;ve been discussing. I\ndon&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever advocated a system being able to take\narbitrary documents that meet the higher level specification of the\ndata type you&#39;re leveraging, vs the more specific subset that your\nsystem supports. Might be a handy feature, but it&#39;s not a requirement.\n\nHowever, whether you use XHTML or XML, the semantics of the payload\nstill need to be defined. That&#39;s always hard work.\n\nIn that light, though I want to take Roys example you cited.\n\nWhile using a GIF is a clever media type to use, I think for many\nfolks interested in this data it&#39;s wrong on many levels.\n\nFirst, it&#39;s not a sparse array, as was suggested, it&#39;s just compact.\nYou&#39;re still sending all 1M bits whether it&#39;s 1 user or 10000 user\nchanges. Yes, it compresses, but that&#39;s not relevant as that&#39;s only a\ntransport issue.\n\nBut most importantly, many systems that happen to use the GIF media\ntype DON&#39;T use it at the level for which it&#39;s being suggested.\nSpecifically, at the bit level. I don&#39;t know PHP, but is it really\nstraightforward to get the color of pixel 100,100 of a received GIF?\nWhat about Javascript in a browser. Now, perhaps, with the canvas\nelement it can be done, but that&#39;s a pretty recent development. But\neither way, it sure is a lot of hoops to jump through to find out if\nbit #100100 is set. Most systems present the artifact instantiated\nfrom a GIF datatype as an opaque blob with very simple properties\nrather than as a list of Bits.\n\nI see the conflict between the reuse of what is, vs the create of what\nwants as the difference between the folks wanting full boat OO systems\nand typing within JS instead of just passing around hashes of hashes.\nBags of hashes of bags of hashes. The conflict between the strongly\ntyped crowd and the dynamically typed crowd (the battles between which\nare legion). Some make do, others want specific abstractions to work\nwith.\n\nWe&#39;re actually seeing the phenomenon of reusing data types, even in\nthe SOAP world here in health care. Leveraging a few &quot;common&quot; data\nformats for many uses. A common data type today is the Document\nSubmission Set payload. It&#39;s based on ebXML, which is used by another\nstandards committee, and therefor adopted by yet another standards\ncommittee.\n\nIdeally this is what standard formats are for. But, at the same time,\nthe format is so onerous, that there is already push back from the\n&quot;simpler&quot; crowd. For a simple exchange, there is a huge amount of\n&quot;boiler plate&quot; using this format. Just like the pushback from SOAP,\nand the boiler plate it brings with it (outside of semantics of SOAP).\n&quot;Why can&#39;t I just send a PDF&quot; they say.\n\nSo, standards or no, they&#39;re not necessarily easy to use. Tooling made\nSOAP &quot;easy to use&quot;. REST is &quot;harder&quot; for many to use because of the\nlack of tooling. Throwing an XSD against some tools and getting free\nJava classes is &quot;easier&quot; than crafting and testing DOM code or Xpath\nqueries.\n\nThat&#39;s where the pressure for many media types are coming from, IMHO.\nThey&#39;re &quot;cheap&quot; to make, and &quot;easy&quot; to use.\n\n"}}
