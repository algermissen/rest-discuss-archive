The easy answer would be &quot;no&quot;,\nbut then you&#39;d also have to ask yourself if maybe it did have a URI, but\nyou just don&#39;t know it.  Or, even if you don&#39;t know if it has a URI,\njust assign your own.\n\n&gt; * How, if at all, do the kind of unamed resources that Mark&#39;s talking\n&gt;   about here relate to RDFs anonymous nodes?\n\nA bNode is a good example of a resource with identity, but without a\n(known) URI.  Of course, they could trivially be given one, and why\nRDF doesn&#39;t do this, I have no idea.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
