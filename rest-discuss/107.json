A response looks like a request, but without the first line - the\nmethod and resource.\n\nAnd with good enough access to the lower levels of HTTP, using chunked\nencoding with each discrete message within the response might work.\n\nI haven&#39;t followed this out to look at encoding issues or at multi-hop\n(proxies) issues. But it sounds fun anyway.\n\n"}}
