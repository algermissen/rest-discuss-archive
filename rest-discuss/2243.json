Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s start at the top and describe what problems session management\nsolves\n&gt; for you.\n&gt; With that, we can stay concrete in our suggestions on how to maintain a\n&gt; RESTful design.\n\n&gt;From the more informative reply from Mark Nottingham, I am more confident in\nusing digest authentication (assuming I can implement it in PHP).  I have\nsome questions about how it will work exactly, but I hope to find the\nanswers as I go...\n\n&gt; From my experience, session management has been a mechanism to achieve\n&gt; higher performance through servers-side caching of some data.\n&gt; What does &#39;session management&#39; mean to you?\n\nTo me, session management is a two-part device:\n1) Persisting authentication (so that a user doesn&#39;t have to type in their\npassword on each request)\n2) Persisting data attached to the user for a limited period of time.\n\nIn my case, I am really only concerned about the first half.  I have worked\nto ensure (so far) that the second half is not a part of my application\nmodel.  Hopefully, it will stay that way.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
