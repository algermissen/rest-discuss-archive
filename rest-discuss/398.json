Check it out. :-)\n\n&gt; The big thing that I don&#39;t like about most file\n&gt; APIs is that they are synchronous stopping your\n&gt; process while hardware catches up.  It is\n&gt; semantically more elegant to represent all\n&gt; IO using asynch interfaces.\n\nHey, you aren&#39;t arguing with me, you&#39;re arguing with Dennis Ritchie, Dave Presotta, Rob\nPike, Ken Trickey, etc.  If you feel up to that, that&#39;s your call.\n\n&gt; Very nice.  But I don&#39;t see why this is not the\n&gt; same as sending email to some address and then\n&gt; checking for email from that address.\n\nI know, I know.  Mark and the rest of us have a universal hammer called HTTP, and\neverything is a nail.  You&#39;ve got a universal hammer called SMTP, and everything is an\ne-mail.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
