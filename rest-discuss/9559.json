This code is only allowed in situations\n&gt; where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the\n&gt; conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include\n&gt; enough\n&gt; information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.\n&gt; Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the\n&gt; user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be\n&gt; possible and is not required.\n&gt; Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For\n&gt; example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT\n&gt; included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an\n&gt; earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response\n&gt; to indicate that it can&#39;t complete the request. In this case, the\n&gt; response entity would likely contain a list of the differences between\n&gt; the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is another possible code - there&#39;s a conflict between what the\n&gt; user submitted and what is an acceptable state.  Again I can and\n&gt; should return some error information.\n\nI think your&#39;re stretching the meaning of &quot;conflict&quot;. Doesn&#39;t sound\nlike a good fit to me.\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
