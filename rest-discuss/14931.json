First=\r\n, like you say, a browser would understand ahead of time what an &lt;A&gt; elemen=\r\nt is and what to do with it. As a client consuming my service API they *sho=\r\nuld* know that what ever way I return the various links that they can make =\r\nuse of at some given state, they will know what to do. I believe this is wh=\r\nat you are saying. However, being that my service can evolve.. I can add ne=\r\nw URI links for say, new features later on, there has to be a way to descri=\r\nbe each link&#39;s method to use (get/post/put/delete) correct? I mean, I can&#39;t=\r\n just return something like:\n\n&lt;links&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.co=\r\nm/create&quot;/&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.com/orders&quot;/&gt;\n=A0 &lt;link href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://myservice.com/history&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/links&gt;\n\nand expect a client to know t=\r\nhat they can post to the /create, get from /orders and get a /history/{id} =\r\ncan I? If instead I returned:\n\n&lt;links&gt;\n\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.=\r\ncom/create&quot; method=3D&quot;post&quot;/&gt;\n\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.com/order=\r\ns&quot; method=3D&quot;get&quot;/&gt;\n\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.com/history&quot; method=\r\n=3D&quot;get,put,delete&quot;/&gt;\n\n&lt;/links&gt;\n\n\nIs that wrong? That would allow a client,=\r\n as well as a bot to be able to determine what it can do with each resource=\r\n link.\n\nFurthermore, I thought the use of media types was important? I am s=\r\ntill a bit rusty with this, hence my questions, but I thought there was som=\r\ne push to use media types like &quot;application/vnd.com.myservice.create+xml&quot; f=\r\nor the /create resource and that that would be set as the Content-Type on t=\r\nhe request... in Jersey, I&#39;d have a method like this set up:\n\n@POST\n@Consum=\r\nes(&quot;application/vnd.com.myservice.create+xml&quot;)\npublic Response create(..){\n=\r\n}\n\nBut, in order for a client to know WHAT media type to set the Content-Ty=\r\npe to when sending the request, I&#39;d have to return that media type string i=\r\nn my links:\n\n&lt;links&gt;\n\n\n=A0 &lt;link href=3D&quot;http://myservice.com/create&quot; metho=\r\nd=3D&quot;post&quot; type=3D&quot;application/vnd.com.myservice.create+xml&quot;/&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/links&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\nSo that a client, be it a developer consuming my API or a bot scanning th=\r\ne response, could look at each &lt;link&gt; element, and know that it can post/pu=\r\nt/delete/get and what to set the Content-Type header to so that it goes to =\r\nthe right method. Naturally the client doesn&#39;t know that it will go to the =\r\nright method, the point here is that the media type is specific for each re=\r\nsource. \n\nSo my question is really.. the type=3D&quot;...&quot; portion.. is that wha=\r\nt would or should be done.. passed back as part of a response so that clien=\r\nt consumers can figure out what method(s), URI and media type to set when m=\r\naking a request? I do NOT mean to say that a client should know BEFORE that=\r\n this is what is coming back. Simply that WHEN it comes back, what attribut=\r\nes to look for in order to make the next request.\n\nIf that does not explain=\r\n it well enough, I don&#39;t know what else to say. \n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-663200390-1267250403=:55560\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hey Markus...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we&#39;re missing ea=\r\nch other on this conversation.
