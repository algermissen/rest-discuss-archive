Amazon describes this\nas their REST mode.\n\nThe support I&#39;ve developed consists mostly consists of Python code\nthat helps to parse and process the Amazon WS XML documents.\n\nAlso, to produce this support I used generateDS.py (see:\nhttp://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/#generateDS). Therefore, I needed\nXML Schema documents.  So, being a Calvinist [1], I decided\nimplement generateXsd.py, which extracts an XML Schema from an XML\ninstance document.  It&#39;s included in the distribution.\n\nThere is a document describing this support at:\n\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/amazon_ws_support.html\n\nAnd the distribution file is at:\n\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/amazon_ws_support-1.0.tar.gz\n\nThe Amazon WS developer&#39;s kit is available at:\n\n    http://www.amazon.com/webservices\n\n  - Dave\n\n[1] Calvin and Hobbes, the comic strip --  Once, when Calvin&#39;s Mom\ntried to force him to clean up his room, Calvin decided to invent a\nrobot to do the work.  After much struggle, Hobbes asked him:\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be less work to just clean your room yourself?&quot; Calvin\nreplied, without looking up: &quot;It&#39;s only work if they make you do\nit.&quot;\n\n-- \nDave Kuhlman\ndkuhlman@...\nhttp://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman\n\n"}}
