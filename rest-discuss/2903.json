This adds the additional desirable\nproperty to the system of partial understanding.\n&quot;\n\nthis is one of the simpler definitions of the semantic web that i have\nseen, and i think this is because it is more or less defined in terms of\nREST.  (i.e. it&#39;s just one additional architectural constraint to an\notherwise RESTful system.)  of course small changes in architecture can\nimply large changes in their underlying implementations but i digress.\n\ni&#39;m trying to ground this theory in the real world.  what would it mean\nsay if amazon have a resource for a book, or ebay has a resource for an\nauction?  just imagine for a second that you have these URIs rather than\nthe actual ugly implementation-dependent (asp/cgi/jsp/cfm)\nquerystring-ridden cookie-dependent non-idempotent ones.\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/auctions/2h4iug29225/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/items/dh75s8d646/\n\nthis implies that amazon/ebay actually have well-defined resources for\nthese URIs to identify.  in the semantic web:\n\n- would the xml representations of these resources look different, or\n- would there be a completely seperate RDF representation, or\n- something else?\n\ni am involved in similar work to joe gregorio at\nhttp://wellformedweb.org ; we&#39;re just using different tools, and i\nhaven&#39;t published my work yet.  i am interested in how RDF can\ncomplement this type of work and make our RESTful systems\nSemantic_Web-ready.\n\nTIA,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
