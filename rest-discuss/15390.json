We have built a\n&gt; comprehensive yet small framework since them, with a thriving community\n&gt; behind it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our Restlet API is both client-side and server-side, both low-level (all\n&gt; HTTP semantics/headers mapped to a clean Java API, see [2]) and high-level\n&gt; (resource handling, limited/focused use of annotations), synchronous or\n&gt; asynchronous (easily supporting provisional 1xx HTTP responses), supports\n&gt; other (pseudo-)protocols than HTTP (FTP, SMTP, POP3, FILE, etc.) and is\n&gt; available in five consistent editions: Java SE/EE, GAE, GWT and Android [3].\n&gt;\n&gt; We also happen to support JAX-RS as an extension, but that&#39;s not what I\n&gt; would recommend as a starting point for you. Our framework lets developers\n&gt; support hypermedia since day one and we have explored higher-level links\n&gt; traversal for a while with our RDF extension [4].\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, we are also working with Microsoft Interop teams to provide\n&gt; advanced client support for the OData protocol [5].\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, it would be great to have something similar in the .NET world. I&#39;m\n&gt; glad you are working on such project. Good luck!\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jerome Louvel\n&gt; --\n&gt; Restlet ~ Founder and Technical Lead ~ http://www.restlet.org\n&gt; Noelios Technologies ~ http://www.noelios.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.restlet.org\n&gt; [2]\n&gt; http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/13-restlet/27-restlet/330-restlet/130-restlet.html\n&gt; [3]\n&gt; http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/13-restlet/21-restlet/318-restlet/303-restlet.html\n&gt; [4]\n&gt; http://www.restlet.org/documentation/snapshot/jee/ext/org/restlet/ext/rdf/RdfClientResource.html\n&gt; [5]\n&gt; http://blog.noelios.com/2010/03/15/restlet-supports-odata-the-open-data-protocol/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nSent from my mobile device\n\n"}}
