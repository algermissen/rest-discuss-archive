The example that JJ presented is a service that\nmanages Job Applications and the various states a job app goes through\nare triggered by remote consumers.\n\nIn my most recent post [2] I tried to explain this &quot;shared\nunderstanding&quot; as being in a Representation:\n* conforming to one or more shared schemas\n* be extensible\n* can&#39;t pre-define URIs\n* can&#39;t pre-constrain state transition paths (resource state\ntransitions, not client)\n\nHmmm, I think the essential questions are:\n1) What is the smallest (most constrained) shared understanding possible?\n2) In what ways is that different from WSDL/WADL?\n\nThanks for any help!!!\nJohn\n\n[1] http://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2007/11/just-in-rest-cant-handle-state.html\n[2] http://johnheintz.blogspot.com/2007/12/shared-understanding-andor-evolvability.html\n\n\n\n-- \nJohn D.
