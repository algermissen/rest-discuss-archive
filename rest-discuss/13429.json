Media type versioning assumes that the same server instance\n&gt; supports all versions. But larger systems may not be able to support\n&gt; multiple versions on the same runtime.\n\nMany times a single cluster can serve all the versions that are\nsupported.  On the other hand, there is no reason requests could not\nbe dispatched to different environments based on the mime type.\n\n&gt; b. It further assumes versioning changes can be represented by\n&gt; representations. In reality, versioning changes do bring in new\n&gt; resources and new processing flows.\n\nOf course, many changes require the introduction of new flavors of\nresources.  That would usually indicate the need for a new media type\nbecause new flavors of resources obviously mean new (or significantly\nchanged) process flows.  I don&#39;t really see how either media type or\nURI based versioning would be better or worse in this situation.\n\n&gt; c. The purported benefit of versioning by media types is that client-\n&gt; side databases don&#39;t need to be changed since the URIs are the same.\n&gt; This is fine in small systems, but migrating a client from one version\n&gt; to another version may require not just code changes, but database\n&gt; upgrades. This may be due to changes in the information content of\n&gt; representations that the clients need to store,.\n\nMigrating a client from one version of an API to another does often\nrequire many changes.  However, many changes will not necessarily\ninvalidate of all the bookmarks (ie, persisted references to\nresources) that clients have collected.  URI based versioning\neffectively locks clients that require bookmarking into the version\nthey started with.\n\n&gt; d. Not every HTTP level software can distinguish between\n&gt; representation of a resource.\n\nMaybe, fortunately all the HTTP software i am familiar with has\nsupport for specifying and retrieving the values of HTTP header\nfields.  Any software that does not support this very basic feature\ndoes not really support HTTP regardless of its claims.  With that\ncapability you can implement content negotiation pretty trivially.\n\n&gt; Given all these, even though URI based versioning looks inelegant, URI\n&gt; based versioning is more pragmatic, and is proven to work.\n\nThings often look inelegant because they are.  URI based versioning\ncan be made to work for some situations and many applications, but not\nwithout a disproportionate level of effort.  URI based version is not\nmore pragmatic, just more common.  It has many downsides and the only\nthing it has going for it is that it is more common.  Despite the\nimplication otherwise, media type based versioning has been used\nsuccessfully in the real world.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
