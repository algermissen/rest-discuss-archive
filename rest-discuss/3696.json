Tim has a lot of axioms\nthat are, at best, personal preferences for a rational universe.\nUniversality is one of them -- the principle that doing it well\nenough in one place suggests that nobody else should duplicate\nthe same functionality, since duplication can be harmful.\n\n&gt; The &quot;uniform interface&quot; constraint doesn&#39;t appear to cover it, as there\n&gt; may exist many different uniform semantics as part of a single \n&gt; interface\n&gt; which could mean &quot;give me a representation&quot; (&quot;RETRIEVE&quot;, &quot;SNARF&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;GRAB&quot;, etc..).  I can&#39;t see how any of the other constraints would\n&gt; prevent this either.\n&gt;\n&gt; Surely I&#39;m missing something here.  Thoughts?  Roy (when you have time \n&gt; -\n&gt; no urgency)?\n&gt;\n&gt;  [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#GET2\n\nNope, that&#39;s about right.  Should the architectural style prevent\npeople from shooting themselves in the foot, or simply note the\nadvantages of using one verb for each meaning?  I don&#39;t have an\nanswer to that one.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
