Roy=\r\n Fielding, however, did define REST.  It is an architectural style, not a s=\r\net of protocols for middleware.\n\nSpeaking of Kay, he has a great quote, som=\r\nething like, &quot;Once an idea grows to the speed of spreading through pop cult=\r\nure, education will never keep up.&quot;  My educated guess is that Roy is doome=\r\nd; things like REST-* will infect such pop culture, because all business pe=\r\nople care about is marketing, not whether people actually spend the time to=\r\n understand REST.  If they did, they wouldn&#39;t be using your transaction man=\r\nager interface to &quot;do REST&quot;.\n\nREST-* very much suggests to a CEO &quot;here is w=\r\nhat you need to do REST&quot;, which is not the case as others have pointed out.=\r\n   Again, Roy&#39;s comparison to IBM web services is spot-on.\n\nAnyway, I doubt=\r\n very much this crap matters at the bits and bytes level, and what most bus=\r\ninesses would benefit from is an open source, free/libre service bus that c=\r\nompetes with billion-dollar stalwarts like Progress.  I just don&#39;t see your=\r\n middleware standard being a huge deal, certainly not important enough to e=\r\narn the name REST-*.  At least the Amazon folks are like &quot;REST-DB&quot;.  No, it=\r\n&#39;s SimpleDB.  Why not SimpleMiddleware or something...\n\n\n"}}
