Only difference between\nyour and Pete&#39;s d=\r\nesign is how the change of state of an order is\naccomplished.\n\n BTW, I am t=\r\notally with Pete&#39;s design , I think it is just more\ncorrect and simpler. \n\n=\r\n\n&gt;Having said that , as the original poster, I contemplated just PUT&#39;ing\n&gt;t=\r\nhe changed resource back to /orders/[orderID] however I didn&#39;t feel\n&gt;comfor=\r\ntable with the fact that I would have to interrogate the &quot;status&quot;\n&gt;field to=\r\n actually know what &quot;operation&quot; I needed to perform (assume that\n&gt;shipping =\r\nan order involves more than just changing the orders status\n&gt;e.g. sends an =\r\ne-mail additionally while canceling does not ).  Maybe I\n&gt;am missing someth=\r\ning.\n\nHow should this be a concern? Even now in Pete&#39;s design you have a\nli=\r\nst of cancelled orders and shipped orders. What he has done is that\nto chan=\r\nge the state of the resource, you do a PUT on the actual orders\nand not on =\r\nthe list. The list is just a read only resource denoting\nwhich order is in =\r\nwhich state.\n\nI guess Pete should clear it more or I am totally wrong in my=\r\n\nunderstanding of his design.\n\nThanks\ndev\n\n\n\n"}}
