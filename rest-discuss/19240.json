I&#39;m curious how others have solved (or would solve) this probl=\r\nem from a RESTful perspective.  I&#39;m aware of the recommendation to use the =\r\ncontent-type header for specifying version information, however I am concer=\r\nned that routing and load balancing features would suffer.  So for example =\r\nif we versioned an API with api.example.com/orders/v1 and api.example.com/o=\r\nrders/v2, it is straightforward to route requests for v1 to one set of web =\r\nservers and route requests for v2 to another set of web servers.  Facilitat=\r\ning this based on HTTP headers is more complex and requires more &quot;plumbing&quot;=\r\n.  This is also true in-code, where URI mapping semantics are first-order c=\r\noncerns for many libraries (e.g. using Web API or ServiceStack, etc, it is =\r\nstraightforward to map URIs to controllers or contracts).\n\nAnyway, it would=\r\n be interesting to hear other people&#39;s feedback on this issue.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
