In this case, you don&#39;t have WYPIWYG, you&#39;ll get back\n&quot;something different&quot;, and not literally identical, but semantically\nidentical which is all you&#39;re really looking for in the long run anyway.\n\nIn general though, hypermedia controls for PUT (and DELETE) really need\n&gt; further exploration. I&#39;d like to see more examples of media types that\n&gt; describe how PUT/DELETE should be used as well. I don&#39;t buy the &quot;you have\n&gt; the URI, so just invoke PUT or DELETE on it&quot; generic approach -- you end up\n&gt; with problems like the one you are tackling here.
