Google&#39;s API wasn&#39;t, and isn&#39;t\nknown to be secure, so other organizations exposing or using search\nservices will be wary of using/reusing that API.\n\nThe scaling problem is that it&#39;s prohibitively expensive to review every\nsingle API that might be created.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
