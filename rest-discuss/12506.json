Forms define the exact nature of client interaction.\nNote that &quot;Client&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean UI; it can also mean\nprogrammatic client.  Forms can be used to create hackable GET\nURL?&lt;queryParam&gt;=&lt;value&gt;, but that&#39;s not the default behavior of &lt;forms&gt;;\nThe default is a POST.\n\nForms, IMHO, are severely underused in RESTful service environments.  The\nconcept of a server provided request template is a potentially powerful\nmechanism of providing runtime meta-data about conversation semantics.  In\nother words, forms can provide the same function as WSDL or WADL.  The\ndifference between forms and the W*DLs is that forms are generated to define\nthe semantics of complex interaction specifically related to the current\napplication state&#39;s workspace needs (meaning the accessible application\nstates that are most likely to be traversed by the client) rather than a\ndefinite of an complete system definition.  WSDL/WADL define the details of\nall application states, and forms define applicable details of applicable\napplication states.\n\n-Solomon\n\nOn Sun, Apr 26, 2009 at 8:02 PM, Alexander Johannesen &lt;\nalexander.johannesen@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On Mon, Apr 27, 2009 at 04:52, Solomon Duskis &lt;sduskis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I would say that forms are are part of the hypertext constraint (and\n&gt; &gt; workspaces) as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make things a bit clearer, forms are simply links with a UI\n&gt; attached to help people write the links, nothing more.
