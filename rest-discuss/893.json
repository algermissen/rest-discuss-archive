If indeed\nhypermedia were the *sole* engine of application state, we wouldn&#39;t need response codes at\nall --- all responses would be self-descriptive hypermedia.\n\nNow you can claim that this is a difference between the pure REST POV and the Web itself,\nand you&#39;re probably right;  but my interest in both REST and the Web is in determining\nwhat qualities have contributed to the enormous success of the Web.  To the extent that\nREST diverges from the Web in practice, I begin to lose interest.\n\nAs a counter to this:\n\n&quot;When you design a system, or a language, then if the features can be broken into\nrelatively loosely bound groups of relatively closely bound features, then that division\nis a good thing to be made a part of the design.&quot;  --- Principle of Modular Design,\nPrinciples of Design, TBL [1]\n\nIt seems clear that embedding the semantics of state transfer in the transferred\nhypermedia --- as would be true if hypermedia were truly the engine of all application\nstate --- breaks with the Principle of Modular Design.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html\n\n\n\n\n"}}
