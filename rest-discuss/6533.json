Bowman schrieb:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Further, to your URI examples and content negotiation discussion,\n&gt;  &gt;there is no need to implicate more than one resource (and therefore one\n&gt;  &gt;URI) in modeling content negotiation. I think if you figure that out,\n&gt;  &gt;you&#39;ll be well on your way to some rest from this subject, no pun\n&gt;  &gt;intended.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; When implementing content negotiation, each alternate representation is \n&gt; also\n&gt; its own resource with its own URI, this URI is returned in \n&gt; Content-Location.\n\nNo, it doesn&#39;t need to. It just can be that way.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how this is done without using multiple resources.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t need to be done that way in the first place.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
