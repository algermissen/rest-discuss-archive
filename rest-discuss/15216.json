I don&#39;t think any confusion exists outside this li=\r\nst. When people say REST client, they mean a client application or a compon=\r\nent that is talking to a server. User agents, connectors etc are not the ty=\r\npical terms that most developers use in their daily life.\n\nSubbu\n \nOn Apr 1=\r\n0, 2010, at 6:43 PM, Eric J.
