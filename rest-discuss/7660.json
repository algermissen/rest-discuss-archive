The trouble people are going to evade it \nsuggests to me that this is a very uncomfortable point for a lot of \nfolks, and maybe the REST model (or at least HTTP) has some trouble here.\n\nSo far I think the two or three folks who&#39;ve actually addressed the \nquestion square on have come down in favor of using POST despite the \nsafety of the operation.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
