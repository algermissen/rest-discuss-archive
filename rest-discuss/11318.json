Focusing overly much on URIs and forgetting to design=\r\n your\nrepresentations will lead you to a hybrid, RPCish system design.\n\n&gt; S=\r\nay we have a database of movies and are looking for The\n&gt; Godfather. Certai=\r\nnly something like\n&gt; www.movies.com/movies/dramas/Godfather,The may uniquel=\r\ny\n&gt; identify the target resource and be more readable, but is this\n&gt; better=\r\n than something more dynamic like\n&gt; www.movies.com/movies?genre=3Ddramas&ti=\r\ntle=3DGodfather,The ?\n\nYes, because it uniquely identifies the target resou=\r\nrce and is\nmore readale. :-)\n\nURI design is a separate concern from REST ar=\r\nchitecture, and has\nits own considerations. Stability, uniqueness and reada=\r\nbility of\nURIs are all primary concerns of this discipline.\n\n&gt; It seems lik=\r\ne the former forces the server to understand the\n&gt; hard-coded semantics of =\r\neach URI segment and seems more\n&gt; limiting in that regard\n\nImposing limitat=\r\nions in the right places is to be welcomed,\nnot avoided. To create order me=\r\nans to impose limitations and\nconstraints on what would otherwise be chaos.=\r\n The trick is\nknowing when and which limitations are useful, and which not.=\r\n\n\n&gt; whereas the latter seems to be a more flexible addressing\n&gt; mechanism, =\r\nyet most examples of RESTful URI definitions I=C2=B9ve\n&gt; seen seem to prefe=\r\nr the former.\n\nStable, unique URIs tend to force you to think about the\nres=\r\nources you have as things with an idenity. Using query\nparameters tends to =\r\ntempt you into thinking mainly in terms\nof the computations which serve the=\r\n responses. The latter way\nisn=E2=80=99t actually wrong, but lacking suffic=\r\nient experience, you\nwill quickly fall into the trap of thinking of URIs as=\r\n names\nfor remote subroutines, and end up exposing an RPC interface\nthat is=\r\n only accidentally and partially RESTful.\n\n&gt; IMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail =\r\nmessage is intended to be\n&gt; received only by persons entitled to receive th=\r\ne confidential\n&gt; information\n\nPS.: it would be courteous of you if you coul=\r\nd arrange for that\n(ineffectual in any case) disclaimer to not be added whe=\r\nn you\npost to an open, public, and publically archived mailing list.\n\nRegar=\r\nds,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
