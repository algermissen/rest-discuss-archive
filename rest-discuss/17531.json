The confusion about the GET&  POST was caused\n&gt;&gt; because of the RFC itself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Broaching a bigger problem, I see that HTTP verbs give more importance\n&gt;&gt; to the users intentions&  REST talks continuously about server state.\n&gt;&gt; But when I use HTTP as a carrier for REST requests, I see these\n&gt;&gt; conflicts all the time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there a rule of thumb, as to REST always overrides HTTP or the other\n&gt;&gt; way around?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; About the business scene, user is aware of the sites functioning&\n&gt;&gt; vendor contacting him is a desired&  explicitly communicated effect of\n&gt;&gt; the search.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Aakash Dharmadhikari\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 17/05/11 7:16 PM, Norman Gray wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Aakash, hello.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On 2011 May 16, at 20:09, aakash dharmadhikari wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;           1. GET or POST\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; User searches for vendors (plumbers) in a given area&    sees list of vendors on page. As a requirement, vendors get notified that a user has found him for the search term, so that he can contact the customer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The intention of the API user will be to get vendors, so it seems to be a pure GET contender; but the unintended side effect is creation of these notifications. As per the specification, HTTP verb should indicate the intent of the user, but in this case there is a pure object creation. What should we use, POST or GET?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds like you should GET.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RFC 2616 section 9.1.1 says of &#39;idempotent&#39; methods such as GET:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The important\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, if your service has server-side side-effects, the HTTP spec says that&#39;s your problem, not the user&#39;s.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Just by the way, if I as a customer were contacted by a merchant when all I&#39;d done was look at their address, I think I&#39;d react poorly.  At length, and with gestures.
