of the problem domain, i have yet to find =\r\na way to\nsuccessfully  map that understanding onto a media type in a way th=\r\nat\nis consistently consumable by generic clients. the idea of being able\nto=\r\n map problem domain descriptions to *multiple* media types is\nsomething i&#39;v=\r\ne not seen yet anywhere (feel free to point me to\nexamples anyone knows abo=\r\nut).\n\nit is my suspicion that the work of SemWeb and REST have the potentia=\r\nl\nto meet in a way that comes close to this goal; the ability enable M2M\nin=\r\nteractions to consistently share understanding about a problem\ndomain indep=\r\nendent of the format of the shared understanding of the\nmessage format.\n\nif=\r\n anyone is working on such a project, or knows of one, please let me know.\n=\r\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/=\r\nfoaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 28, 2011 at 19:51, Erik Wilde &lt;dret@...=\r\nu&gt;
