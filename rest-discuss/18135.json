By not using REST? I know this is beating an old horse, \nbut I still have issues with the idea of ignoring the domain of a system.\n\nI do se the benefits of not serializing internal object representations \ndirectly. That would expose the inner workings of the system. So adding some \nkind of public facing representation on top of it makes sense. Then you can \nfreely change the inner workings without worrying about the clients (as long \nas you keep the transformation to the public representation in sync).\n\nWhat I do not understand is the fear of coupling the clients to the domain. \nI mean: if I am creating an M2M system working with e-commerce then it must \nsurely understand what a quote, a sales order, a bill, and a payment is? \nNever mind what format these entities are represented in - if it&#39;s HTML than \nthe client must have decoders for RDFa -&gt; Quote/Order/Bill/whatever, and \nsimilar for XML, HAL, CSV and whatever other format one might choose. In the \nend the client must be able to decode from the wire format (public \nrepresentation) to some kind of internal object representing the domain on \nthe client side, such that it can do actual operations on it.\n\nSo, as I see it, we cannot avoid some kind of decoding/deserialization on \nthe client, where it will take the public representation and convert it to \nsome internal domain specific representation - thereby coupling the client \nto the domain. What is it that I am failing to understand here?\n\nBut maybe I am too single minded ... the systems I work with are all about \nM2M integrations, where one sub-system is reading data from another \nsub-system and then making decisions based on that data (meaning they must \nhave some sort of domain understanding). In these cases we need to expose \ndomain data, and the formats for that are usually vendor specifik \nderivations of XML or JSON. It could of course be possible to use PDF as a \npublic format, but that would make it rather difficult to automatically \nextract the required domain specific data.\n\nRegards, J�rn\n\n\n"}}
