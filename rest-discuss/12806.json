It&#39;s been a while :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hasn&#39;t it, though?  And isn&#39;t this about where we left off lo those\n&gt; many years ago?\n&gt;\n&gt; (By the way, I&#39;m not actually pushing BTP here, only the\n&gt; provisional-final model for RESTful transactions, which I think could\n&gt; be a lot simpler than BTP.  And I do think it is not only possible but\n&gt; sometimes necessary to do something that would look a lot like\n&gt; transactions in a RESTful environment.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The compensating transaction model in the reference Bill sent  \n&gt; round is what\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re looking for I think (cf atoms in BTP).\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see much detail about compensation in the reference Bill sent,\n&gt; unless I missed something.\n&gt;\n&gt; It says:\n&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;\n&gt; The two proposals are:\n&gt;   1. classic transactions obeying ACID properties;\n&gt;   2. compensation based transactions avoiding the need to lock\n&gt; resources for extended periods of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Approach 1 is discussed in depth whilst the second will be covered in\n&gt; a subsequent wiki.\n&gt; &lt;/excerpt&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My understand of compensation is that it is a do-undo model, where the\n&gt; participants actually do the work in Phase 1, and then undo it in\n&gt; Phase 2 if the transaction aborts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Provisional-Final is a do provisionally, and then do finally model,\n&gt; where the participants do the work provisionally in Phase 1, and then\n&gt; finalize it (or cancel it) in Phase 2.\n&gt;\n&gt; In an protocol sense, I think the decision of which of those\n&gt; approaches to use could be left up to the participants, but if we&#39;re\n&gt; talking Java implementation details, we probably need to make the\n&gt; approaches explicit.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m familiar with problems in compensation from working in fast-paced\n&gt; manufacturing environments.  If an order is accepted, work begins, or\n&gt; goods are shipped.  I&#39;ve seen it happen in EDI environments with no\n&gt; transactional controls, and it&#39;s expensive to undo.  Much better to\n&gt; mark it provisional and only start work once the transaction commits.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
