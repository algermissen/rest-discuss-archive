Up to\n&gt; a point you can get by with dot notation in form key names, but\n&gt; your structural options are limited and it gets ugly quickly.\n\nIndeed forms cannot solve all the problems, but they do solve a large\nnumber of problems very well.  That&#39;s how I understood Bill&#39;s\nquestion, and the context of my reply.  There are a lot of interesting\nuse cases where forms are used million of times daily, so why not\nextract?\n\nBlog posting is one particular use case where the functionality is\navailable in a form, the majority of usage happens using forms, and\nit&#39;s just a matter of extracting an API from these forms.\n\nYour response reads very much like the typical response I receive to\nthis crazy suggestion.  I think it&#39;s a matter of perception, but why\ndo you think it&#39;s better to work something else even when the use case\ndoesn&#39;t need more than what forms already provide?\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
