Bowman wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing REST development for a dozen years, and have yet to\n&gt; create a media type. If you _must_ create a media type, you _must_\n&gt; register it. But that&#39;s a pretty big &quot;if&quot;. Consider the multitude of\n&gt; applications on the real-world Web using text/html -- it is _not_\n&gt; required for each application, be it banking or travel reservations or\n&gt; e-mail or shopping, to have its own media type. Re-using ubiquitous\n&gt; types has the benefit of scaling out-of-the-box; creating your own,\n&gt; even if it&#39;s registered, will only achieve Internet scale if it\n&gt; becomes\n&gt; ubiquitous -- another pretty big &quot;if&quot;. My advice on creating your own\n&gt; media types remains unchanged -- don&#39;t.\n\n\nSo, I think I understand the point you are making about the Internet\nscale. And it&#39;s true, there are lots of types out there, which can do a\nlot of things for you. Some of them may use XML as underlying encoding,\nothers something else, and all of them will probably have some sort of\nlibrary available for the language of your choice to help you parse and\ndeal with that sort of content type.\n\nBut that&#39;s exactly where I can also see an issue: When I choose a number\nof (different) media types, I now also need to equip my clients with all\nthe necessary libraries to read and parse this data, and my server with\nthe right libs to create this sort of content.\n\nDoesn&#39;t that add undue weight and dependencies to your software? Sure,\nit depends on your use case, but generally, I like to keep the number of\ndependencies for my software small. For example, I once dealt with an\nAtom library, which was just heavy and slow. We finally went to plain\nJSON, the software was much smaller and things started to fly. If I just\nneed a simple collection of stuff, is it really wise to go all out and\nuse Atom if something (admittedly self-made) smaller would suffice as\nwell?\n\nI&#39;m not bashing on Atom here, that&#39;s just an example.\n\nJuergen\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nMuleSoft\n\n\n"}}
