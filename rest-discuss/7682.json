I just happened to use a &#39;/&#39; instead of \n&#39;.&#39;. For no good reason, I blame Plone, which has been today&#39;s web \nsystem of choice.\n\n\n&gt; Also, I thought I’d just read a recommendation on how to do this, but\n&gt; I can’t recall where. I’m trying to find it. IIRC, it suggests pretty\n&gt; using the URLs as above with multiple formats served on the primary\n&gt; URL based on the Accept header. It might have also involved 302s.\n\nI guess the issue here comes down to URI proliferation for a single \nresource. Mike Schinkel was asking about this recently; I think this is \na case where a) multiple URIs one resource makes some kind of sense, b) \nit&#39;s becoming an idiomatic design pattern for web apps anyway. There is \nthe accept/content-* machinery but no-one (statistically speaking) uses \nthat stuff to obtain &quot;the pdf&quot; or whatever.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
