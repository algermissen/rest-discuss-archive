Let&#39;s even\n&gt; assume that developers used the methods properly (i.e. no idempotent\n&gt; updates via POST).\n&gt; \n&gt; I bet it would be well under 10%.  Why?  Because I suspect that there\n&gt; are a lot more non-idempotent things one might want to do, than\n&gt; idempotent things.\n\nBy definition, this isn&#39;t a design approach based on uniformity unless \nhtml is the definition of what uniformity is. Which is my point - it has \nbeen.\n\n\n\n&gt; That&#39;s not to suggest I don&#39;t think the GET/POST restriction should be\n&gt; lifted (thanks WHAT WG), but my argument in favour of doing so is\n&gt; because restricting extensibility unnecessarily is daft, and can come\n&gt; back to bite you in the ass.  I just don&#39;t think it has (that much) in\n&gt; this case.\n\nThen we&#39;re in agreement. Having restricted extensibility unnecessarily \nisn&#39;t just daft; it&#39;s been harmful, as evidenced by the current web \ninfrastructure. People clearly have been keying off the wrong spec.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
