This is usually how we handling this\nin HTML.  Why would the same approach not work with an RDF-ish media\ntype?\n\n&gt; Here are some examples:\n&gt; HTML.IMG\n&gt; means &quot;retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don&#39;t navigate to it)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; X.INCLUDE\n&gt; means &quot;retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don&#39;t navigate to it)&quot;\n\nIf the embedded image feature of HTML had been implemented as `&lt;link\nrel=&quot;embedded-image&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;` would we be worse off (from a REST\nperspective)?  If a `link` with a specific rel is pretty much the same\nas the `img` tag then it seems that we could achieve that result with\nRDF-ish formats. If you think there is a material difference, please\nexample that in more details\n\nMy gut feeling is that retrieve vs navigate is a distinction without\nmuch of a difference in the context of automated user agents. The\ndistinction is obviously important for certain clients (ie, browsers)\nbut not for others (ie, proxies, screen readers, etc).\n\n&gt; HTML.A\n&gt; means &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed it)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ATOM.LINK@rel=&quot;alternate&quot;\n&gt; means &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed it)&quot;\n\nSeems like most links are either the &quot;navigate&quot; flavor or have some\nspecific semantics to the user agent that could be specified with an\n`@rel`. Given the markup nature of HTML it probably needs a special\nform of link to &quot;linkify some text&quot;. I don&#39;t see the need for more\nthan two kinds of links in HTML, and in more automata oriented formats\nit seems that one flavor of link should be sufficient.\n\n&gt; HTML.FORM@method=&quot;:get&quot;\n&gt; means &quot;collect the arguments, construct a URI and navigate to that\n&gt; resource using the HTTP method &quot;get&quot; (don&#39;t make a body w/ the args)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; HTML.FORM@method=&quot;post&quot;\n&gt; means &quot;collect the arguments, construct a body and navigate to that\n&gt; resource using the HTTP method &quot;post&quot; (don&#39;t construct a URI w/ the\n&gt; args)&quot;\n\nYeah, uri template support and a form vocabulary would be useful.\nHowever, may systems do not require that set of capabilities. I don&#39;t\nsee the method paramater as all that important.\n\nA get form is really just a specification for how to render a UI for a\nURI template. For an automated user agent such a specification is\nsuperflous, the same thing can be accomplished with just a link whose\ntarget is a URI template. (Possibly with a couple of extra resources\nrepresenting the set of valid values for the various options.)\n\nSimilarly, in the context of automated user agents, anything you can\ndo with a form, you can do without form by sufficiently specifying the\nmedia type and/or relationships.\n\n(Though in some situations a form might better than either of the\nabove choices.)\n\n&gt; ATOM:LINK@rel=&quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; means &quot;use this link to PUT or DELETE the indicated resource using\n&gt; guidlines set out in AtomPub\n&gt;\n&gt; none of the RDF media types i have encountered have these affordances\n&gt; built in; there is no universal way for servers to inform clients of\n&gt; the valid/appropriate possibilities at any point in time. Clients must\n&gt; have this information hard-coded instead.\n\nSo is your point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF\nbased media type?  Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do\nso?\n\nThese affordances you&#39;ve mentioned are either built on link+@rel which\nis, at least to me, semantically indistinguishable from an RDF triple,\nor they are media type specific, and therefore not &quot;universal&quot;.  Even\nthe ones that seem particularly distinctive don&#39;t always mean what\nthey are specified to mean.\n\nFor example, if my automated user agent reads in an HTML page it does\n*not* retrieve and embed image resources linked to by that page.\nNeither do the accelerating proxies though which it passes, they just\nretrieve and cache. Interestingly they do exactly the same thing with\nthe `a` tags in the HTML. For the proxies there is no distinction\nbetween `img` and `a` tags except perhaps in prioritization.\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
