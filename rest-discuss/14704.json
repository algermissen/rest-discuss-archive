The client need to retrieve the command \n&gt; from the server and then send the response of the device to the server \n&gt; to check its validity. Then the server says if it is ok or not.\n\nI think I do not understand what you are up to. Why does the client fetch the command for the device from the server?\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  Device      client     Server\n&gt;                    ----&gt;      Get command\n&gt;        &lt;-----      &lt;-----\n&gt; \n&gt;        ----&gt;       ----&gt;      Response from device\n&gt;   \t\t   &lt;-----     Response from server indicating\n&gt;                               if it is ok or not the execution\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be like: client calls authenticate of device. then the server \n&gt; sends the command to be sent to the device for authentication.\n\nHTTP authentication is orthogonal. Use one of the HTTP standard authentication solutions.\n\n\n&gt; The \n&gt; client send this command to the device and the response is sent back to \n&gt; the server. The server then replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have thought on:\n&gt;     /device/{id}   as resource\n&gt;     /device/{id}/authenticate\n&gt;          GET will retrieve the command and blank state\n&gt;              &lt;command&gt; value &lt;/command&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;state&gt; not defined &lt;/command&gt;\n&gt;          PUT will send the response and get the real state\n&gt;              ---&gt; &lt;response&gt; value &lt;/response&gt;\n&gt;              &lt;--- &lt;state&gt; not defined &lt;/command&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is REST. Is it better to create another resource as:\n&gt;     /device/{id}/authenticate/command  (only GET available)\n&gt;     /device/{id}/authenticate/response (only PUT available)\n&gt;     /device/{id}/authenticate          (only GET avaliable for status)\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help is welcome.\n\nCan you explain your requirements? I am having trouble understanding what you are trying to do.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; TA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
