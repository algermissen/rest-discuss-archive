I was only asking out of curiosity. If you restrict the\n&gt; scope of WRDL to XML-based representations (which multi-part/form-data is\n&gt; not) then I think it will be a much simpler and manageable spec.\n\nWell there are only two &quot;standardized&quot; representations (other than\nHTML), XML and form parameters so I think it may make sense to support\nthem both directly. I am thinking about a simple templating feature for\nXML:\n\n&lt;foo bar=&quot;{height}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;width&gt;{width}&lt;/width&gt;\n&lt;/foo&gt;\n\nIt probably doesn&#39;t make much sense to go beyond that. \n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Hmm. Now that I&#39;ve said that, I think I really like it. In XSLT, you specify\n&gt; what pattern you should look for (with a match attribute) and what value\n&gt; (relative to each node that matched the pattern) is the &quot;key&quot; or name for\n&gt; that node (with a use attribute).\n&gt; \n&gt; By following that example, WRDL can have named sets of references where the\n&gt; names are stored in the representations so they don&#39;t have to be hardcoded\n&gt; in the WRDL file!\n\nI didn&#39;t understand this the first time I read it, but I do now. You\nwant to allow the WRDL file to set up hashtables for the programmer\nwhere the keys are generated from the XML (e.g. &quot;title&quot; elements for\nMeerkat topics) and the values are references to resource objects. Good\nidea!\n\nI think I will also rename it to reference-type, because really we&#39;re\nclassifying references. Make sense to you?\n\n&lt;!ELEMENT reference-type (documentation?, appinfo?)&gt;\n\n&lt;!ATTLIST reference-type name %Name; #REQUIRED \n                    match %XPath; #REQUIRED\n                    use %XPath; #REQUIRED\n                    resourceType %QName; #REQUIRED&gt;\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Are you talking about what XSLT does when matching templates? The spec says\n&gt; that a processor can throw an error when multiple templates match a pattern\n&gt; with the same priority _or_ it can choose the last template that appears in\n&gt; the stylesheet.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;d be simplest to treat testing for multiple representation types\n&gt; like a xsl:choose/xsl:when. The first test that results in true gets\n&gt; evaluated.\n\nIn our other (offlist) discussion we agreed that the client should\nexplicitly ask for a representation. So I don&#39;t think we have to answer\nthis question. The test is almost superfluous...sanity checking at best,\ncruft at worst. Originally the model was you&#39;d get something back and\nfigure out what it was. But it&#39;s better to say what you want and be\nconfident you&#39;re going to get it. \n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
