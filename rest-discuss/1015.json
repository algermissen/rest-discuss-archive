If my goal is to, for instance, simply provide a naked,\n&gt; hierarchical, filesystem like space in which containers can be created and deleted and\n&gt; opaque blobs created, updated, and deleted --- all by name --- then I don&#39;t really\n&gt; need any more information at all other than the hierarhical organization.

At some point in the hierarchy, the\ncompany basically relinquishes any control over the namespace and the\nauthority becomes the employee.  But the &quot;containment&quot; relationship\npersists between authorities, whether that relationship represents\n&quot;employment&quot; (in this case) or &quot;customer of&quot; (in the case of, say,\nYahoo/Geocities).  Definitely a &quot;Web of Trust&quot; topic.\n\nBut in your example, is it your intent that the person PUTting into\nthis empty namespace be the authority for it?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
