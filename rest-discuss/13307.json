I think we all\n&gt; would really: what works on the big Web can be scaled down to work in\n&gt; less ambitious environments like enterprise systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; My stumbling block is that it&#39;s a platform vendor driving this, and I\n&gt; can&#39;t help but feel there&#39;s a potential for conflict of interest.\n&gt; \n\nyes and no.\n\nNo, because a simpler more scalable architecture like the Web would \ngreatly reduce the amount of effort we currently have to invest in our \nprojects and products, specifically around tooling and management.\n\nYes, well, because we sell middleware.\n\nThen again, REST-* was about defining restful middleware services, not \ndefining REST itself.\n\n&gt; Red Hat could do much more sensible and ambitious things than mooch\n&gt; around with enterprise middleware - they certainly have the talent and\n&gt; bandwidth to do something radical. If I wore a Red Hat, then I&#39;d be\n&gt; pushing to build a kick-ass Web server and nice frameworks around it\n&gt; to deal with things like hypermedia formats and business protocols\n&gt; (i.e. not JAX-RS).\n\nJAX-RS was for me (and Red Hat) to get my feet wet.  Until recently, I \nwas the only person in our division evalengizing REST as a direction we \nshould take.  My efforts weren&#39;t taken seriously until a few large \ncustomers started using RESTEasy.  Now I have a bit more political \ncapital to steer us in a RESTful direction.  REST-* was an effort to \nhave people tell us what the direction should be.\n\nBTW, what do you have against JAX-RS?  I&#39;ve liked it so far because it \ndoesn&#39;t get in the way with how you want to design your resources.  Its \njust a simple bridge between the HTTP message and your Java code.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
