What I can do  \n&gt; with HTTP auth is force them to sign in before doing things that  \n&gt; require being signed in, like posting to a forum or administration.  \n&gt; However, what I also want to do is be able to recognize via the  \n&gt; request whether or not the user is signed in. If not, I don&#39;t want to  \n&gt; force them to sign in, and instead will return a representation for  \n&gt; guests. If they are signed in, I want to return a personalized  \n&gt; representation of the resource. I can do this kind of personalization  \n&gt; with HTTP auth + cookies, if cookies are enabled, or HTTP auth + URL  \n&gt; rewriting, if cookies are disabled. But if I&#39;m using cookies and URL  \n&gt; rewriting to get a personalization, why not use the same for  \n&gt; authentication? The security answer to that is that it is easier to  \n&gt; do replay attacks if I use the cookies or URL rewriting for  \n&gt; authentication, so long as it is digest not basic authentication I&#39;m  \n&gt; using.\n\nUsing my (soon to be published) cookie authentication spec you get the\nsame benefits as HTTP Auth but also get control over the UI. \n\nMy scheme does require cookie and JS though.\n\n\n&gt; 6) I want to allow people to log into the entire network a la SSO. I  \n&gt; can do that with cookies and URL rewriting, but it isn&#39;t so easy to  \n&gt; do with HTTP authentication. I think I actually figured out a way to  \n&gt; do it if JS is enabled, but I haven&#39;t tried it and once again, what  \n&gt; do I do if JS is not enabled? Do I degrade by saying you can&#39;t have  \n&gt; SSO without JS? Do I degrade by switching to cookies/URL rewriting?\n\nSee the OASIS SSO stuff (Liberty alliance).\n\nI have a RESTfull addendum to that which I will try and publish here.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 7) Lastly, these sites will each have several people who can do  \n&gt; various administration roles such as editing, reviewing, moderating.  \n&gt; I&#39;m planning on having every administrator come up with a second  \n&gt; &quot;admin&quot; password of there own, and forcing them to supply the admin  \n&gt; password before doing any administration, all of which will happen  \n&gt; under HTTPS. This is one area where I&#39;ve considered HTTP auth might  \n&gt; fit, because all the administration could take place under /admin, I  \n&gt; don&#39;t care about SSO, I&#39;m not so worried about confusing the user  \n&gt; because that actually would add to the security. But once again, I  \n&gt; was stopped by the inability to log them off once done.\n\nBetter to have a single user and apply roles. Then they don&#39;t have to\nreauthenticate.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
