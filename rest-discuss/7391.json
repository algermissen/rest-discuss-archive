And it will be the case in many\n&gt; small to medium size businesses.)\n\nThe market will deal with businesses like that. I don;t see why \ngenuinely competent organizations should have to put up with bad \narchitectures to support their pointy-haired competitors.\n\nIt seems suspicious to me that these purported admins who are so \nincompetent they can&#39;t properly manage PUT and DELETE knew enough to \nblock these methods in the first place. I suspect what may really be \ngoing on is unchanged defaults in the firewalls and proxy servers. If \nindeed that&#39;s the case then it&#39;s much easier to fix the problem at its \nsource by educating a relatively small number of proxy and firewall vendors.\n\nIndeed all you may need to do when a customer tells you your system \nseems broken is say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re using proxy X? That&#39;s broken and \nnon-spec compliant. Use proxy Y instead and all will be fine.&quot;\n\nOf course, this is not a binary situation. Some will fix their systems \nand some won&#39;t. My experience leads me to believe that when you insist \non spec compliance, more people will fix their systems and come into \ncompliance than won&#39;t. You will lose a few percent. However if you try \nand support all the broken and brain damaged networks out there, you do \n  far more damage to everyone. You end up hurting the compliant \ncustomers to support the noncompliant ones in a dozen different, subtle \nways. Maximum net benefit to all involved is achieved by jettisoning the \ntruly incompetent organizations that will not and cannot learn the \nproper way to do things.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
