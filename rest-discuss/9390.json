Depending on which metaphor you\n&gt; prefer you are either first moving a file to a new location and then\n&gt; deleting it, or else first deleting it and then deleting another version\n&gt; of it from a special location for deleted files.\n\nYou seem to be assuming that the client is requesting that the &quot;move\nto trash&quot; happen.  AFAICT, it is not with either the DELETE method or\n(in Windows) right-click-delete action (a drag-to-trash action would\nbe different, of course).\n\n&gt; DELETE deletes. I think it&#39;s made perfectly clear that DELETE deletes in\n&gt; RFC 2616. When you have deleted a resource, it is deleted.\n\nSure, but it&#39;s also up to the server to decide what constitutes\ndeletion, at least within the bounds of the definition in 2616.  By\nthat measure, what Eric describes seems fine.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
