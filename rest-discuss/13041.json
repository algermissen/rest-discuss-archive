The approach you describe below is similar to a  \nclient trying to setup foreign key relations between different  \ndatabase entities. This model leaks abstractions and is not ideal for  \nwriting large systems.\n\nFor instance, take a simple shopping cart application. The server may  \nhave decided to use links to associate products to a cart, but that  \ndoes not mean that, clients should be able to create/edit/delete those  \nlinks. Instead, links come into being when the client &quot;adds products  \nto a cart&quot; and they go away when the client &quot;removes a product from  \nthe cart&quot;. That is the right level of abstraction for the client.\n\nIMO, links are for servers to provide navigability between resources,  \nand to let clients make state transitions via links.\n\nSubbu\n\n\nOn Jun 30, 2009, at 3:44 AM, Sam Johnston wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Subbu,\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Jun 30, 2009 at 5:45 AM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; LINK is similar - how a LINK relationship is created/managed/ \n&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed is\n&gt;&gt; undefined.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why isn&#39;t that up to the server(s) managing the resources? Links are\n&gt;&gt; for servers to describe relations between resources, and not for\n&gt;&gt; clients to manage such relationships.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why so? This use case requires that clients be able to manage links:  \n&gt; virtual\n&gt; infrastructure is modeled as compute, storage and network resources  \n&gt; and\n&gt; clients create, delete and link them as they see fit. The server can  \n&gt; too\n&gt; (for example, implicitly creating a storage resource and linking it  \n&gt; when you\n&gt; create a compute resource) but the point of OCCI\n&gt; &lt;http://www.occi-wg.org/&gt;is to allow for client manipulation.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re not the only ones who see a need either... the original  \n&gt; authors of the\n&gt; HTTP spec (RFC 2068) including LINK and\n&gt; UNLINK&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-19.6.1.2&gt;verbs for\n&gt; this around the same as this\n&gt; I-D &lt;http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-pritchard-http-links-00.txt \n&gt; &gt;specifying\n&gt; same in more detail. This is what Mark Nottingham (author of the\n&gt; Link: header I-D among other things, copied) had to say this morning  \n&gt; on\n&gt; apps-discuss:\n&gt;\n&gt; *- First and foremost, in the absence of the LINK and UNLINK verbs\n&gt; originally defined in RFC 2068[2] but specifically omitted from RFC  \n&gt; 2616[3],\n&gt; what is the preferred mechanism for manipulating these links via  \n&gt; HTTP? It\n&gt; appears that this header is intended for GET requests only, but  \n&gt; presumably\n&gt; specifying it in POST and PUT requests would be one option that  \n&gt; avoids the\n&gt; creation of [not so] &quot;new&quot; verbs (bearing in mind that short of  \n&gt; accepting\n&gt; Link: headers from empty POST/PUT requests, it would be necessary to  \n&gt; GET and\n&gt; then PUT the entire payload to update links - twice if they were\n&gt; reciprocal). While there was an attempt a dozen years ago to better  \n&gt; define\n&gt; the relevant HTTP verbs[4], it strikes me as more sensible to follow  \n&gt; the\n&gt; example of the Set-Cookie: header for this rather than WebDAV&#39;s  \n&gt; example of\n&gt; creating new verbs (even if we&#39;ve seen them before) but you guys are  \n&gt; the\n&gt; experts.*\n&gt;\n&gt; Undefined, but I imagine in a PUT/POST body does indeed make the  \n&gt; most sense.\n&gt; Using the Link header in a request doesn&#39;t have well-defined  \n&gt; semantics.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder then whether it&#39;s not sensible to define these semantics in\n&gt; an[other] Internet Draft (ala Set-Cookie) rather than having everyone\n&gt; running off and inventing their own in-band solutions... doing so  \n&gt; would make\n&gt; for some really clever RESTful interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sam\n\n\n"}}
