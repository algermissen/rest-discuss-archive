The &#39;to&#39; attribute \nspecifies a URI that can be directed to a specific presence ( or \nunspecific ) of a client ( typically an IM user, but certainly doesnt\n have to be ), or a component with or without a resource specification ( a\n component can be local or remote - it doesn&#39;t matter ) eg.\n    somebody@.../work-desk-5 ( client ) or \n    some.host/browse-component/whateverIcaretoputhere.\nWithin the IQ (info-query) element the payload definition, and behaviour\ncan be specified - by behaviour I mean type of query being undertaken,\neg. jabber:iq:browse states that the payload is a browse request to a\ngiven jid ( to address ) to discover information about/from that\nend-point.\n\nThe point of this all being, that there are some obvious parts to this\nprotocol that could lend itself to facilitating some passable (portion)\nof a REST implementation ( or so it seems to me ).\n\nIt would help if people in general debated the merits of this ( at least\nfor me ), to help clear up whether or not there is some merit in using\nsome or all of what Jabber has to offer in a REST based architecture.\n\nCheers.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2002 at 12:07:08PM -0500, Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt; On Wed, Nov 27, 2002 at 02:37:48PM +0000, Piers Harding wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Yannick - I&#39;d certainly like to get the lists opinion on this too.  I\n&gt; &gt; have ( as have others in the Jabber community ) wondered about Jabbers&#39;\n&gt; &gt; place in the REST world.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jabber appears to have some of the key components for REST with URIs and\n&gt; &gt;  a few of the RESTian verbs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t looked at the Jabber protocol in any detail in quite some\n&gt; time, but REST is an architectural style that is extremely constraining.\n&gt; A system doesn&#39;t &quot;conform&quot; to REST&#39;s constraints by accident, it has to\n&gt; be intentionally designed to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jabber, like pretty much every other system out there, can be engulfed\n&gt; by the Web, in the same way that FTP and email/SMTP were absorbed; by\n&gt; constraining interactions with that system to uniform interface\n&gt; semantics, and mapping the space of identifiable things in that system\n&gt; into URI space (often requiring a new URI scheme).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is it actually necessary for a toolset to implement all features of\n&gt; &gt; REST, or would the REST community be willing to endorse toolsets to a\n&gt; &gt; level of REST support?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what that means (&quot;level of REST support&quot;).
