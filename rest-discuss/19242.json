HTTP frameworks do encourage solving problems at the protocol\nlayer.  What they aren&#39;t much good for, unfortunately, is thinking in\nhypertext.  I don&#39;t want to say there&#39;s no versioning in REST, in fact\nif I PUT an existing image to my server, the old image is renamed not\nremoved; there&#39;s a &quot;versioned&quot; API inherent in this strategy.\n\nAs to API versioning, do just that, version your hypertext API -- not\nyour URLs, your conceptual mappings aren&#39;t changing.  Neither should\nyour media type -- I mostly use XHTML to define APIs, that&#39;s as detailed\na description of the actual API as intermediaries need in order to\nparticipate in the communication (which they won&#39;t do if you&#39;re just\n&quot;re-labeling&quot; XHTML as custom, versioned media types to conneg around\nproper hypertext API design).\n\nAnything else is up to the user-agent to work out.  This is actually\neasier for m2m than h2m; a v1 m2m client should already ignore any\nhypertext it doesn&#39;t understand, rolling out v2 can then re-use any\nnon-deprecated bits of the API already present plus the new stuff, and\nignore the deprecated stuff.  Can&#39;t it?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
