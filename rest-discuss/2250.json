In\n\nHow would I transfer representations of what I&#39;m purchasing to it?\n\n&gt; fact, if done correctly, I could even see having an HTTP server that was\n&gt; dedicated and optimized to doing nothing but maintaining one or more site&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;shopping cart resource&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure how this would work exactly, but I\n&gt; can vaguely see it working.\n\nYou&#39;d need some session info to do that.\n\n&gt; As for the client program being capable of maintaining state, I can see\n&gt; doing that sort of thing now (with a bit of client-side programming, mint\n&gt; you).  For instance, If you were at Amazon, each of the items you view is\n&gt; represented by an identifier (it&#39;s URL).  Suppose you could right-click on\n&gt; the page and select the &quot;add to amazon.com cart&quot;.  This would cause the\n&gt; current URL you were at to be stored locally in a &quot;cart&quot; that was specific\n&gt; to amazon (though I suppose it could be more generic too).\n\nThe thing about keeping the URI around, rather than the data, is that\nwhat&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; the URI might change.  e.g. the model might be upgraded\nbetween the time you decide you want it just the old model), and the\ntime you checkout.  You base your purchasing decision on the *data* not\nthe URI.  So you should keep hold of that.\n\n&gt;  Now, suppose you\n&gt; have found everything you wanted to buy.  You go up to your brower&#39;s menu\n&gt; (or taskbar or whatever) and bring up the amazon.com shopping cart ( which\n&gt; basically contains nothing but URLs).  You then click on the &quot;buy&quot; button.\n&gt; This prompts your browser to submit (via POST) all of the URLs to an\n&gt; amazon.com location (not sure how that would be know, but let&#39;s assume it\n&gt; is) and amazon would now create the check-out resource that contains the\n&gt; items you are buying... then it&#39;s business as usual.\n\nPretty close, except for s/URL/representation\n\n&gt; Now, I know that it would be possible to add this functionality to IE6.\n&gt; Obviously, it would also require the amazon.com&#39;s of the world to provide\n&gt; their part of the functionality.  But I think it would be possible.\n&gt; Further, it would be possible to merge this concept with the one above\n&gt; (dedicated &quot;shopping cart&quot; server), if wanted.  This would potentially allow\n&gt; someone to access their shopping cart from any browser later on, as well as\n&gt; some other interesting benefits I can think of (such as the ability to share\n&gt; shopping carts with friends regardless of where you shop at).\n\nYou can still save your shopping cart either way - just drag and drop on\nthe &quot;hold cart&quot; (or whatever) button in the page.\n\n&gt; &gt; But you could imagine browsing through a web site, dragging off\n&gt; &gt; products you want and dropping them in a local folder, then at some\n&gt; &gt; point dragging that folder and dropping it onto the &quot;checkout&quot;\n&gt; &gt; symbol within the web page.  No session required.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh yeah.  That&#39;s what I was saying too.  :)  Shoulda read the whole post\n&gt; first...\n\nOops, me too. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
