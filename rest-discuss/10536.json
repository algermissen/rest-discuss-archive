But in terms of self-descriptive\n &gt; messages, p=\r\narticularly when the available operations vary by user\n &gt; role, wouldn&#39;t it=\r\n be more RESTful to handle this at the protocol\n &gt; level?\n &gt;\n &gt; In both exa=\r\nmples below, a 300 response to an OPTIONS request is\n &gt; assumed to have no =\r\nentity body. So, the 300 response would have no\n &gt; Content-Type or ETag hea=\r\nders, and MUST send a Content-Length: 0 header:\n &gt;\n &gt; (GET | HEAD | OPTIONS=\r\n) http://example.org/feed.atom\n &gt; (Status-Line) HTTP/1.1 200 OK (or 300 Mul=\r\ntiple Choices for OPTIONS response)\n &gt; Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, DELETE\n &gt; Ac=\r\ncept: application/atom+xml;type=3Dentry; q=3D1.0, application/atom+xml; q=\r\n=3D0.5\n &gt; ETag: foo\n &gt; Vary: Authentication\n &gt; Content-Type: application/at=\r\nom+xml;type=3Dfeed\n &gt;\n &gt; (GET | HEAD | OPTIONS) http://example.org/entry:1.=\r\natom\n &gt; (Status-Line) HTTP/1.1 200 OK (or 300 Multiple Choices for OPTIONS =\r\nresponse)\n &gt; Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE\n &gt; Accept: application/atom+xml;=\r\ntype=3Dentry; q=3D1.0, application/atom+xml; q=3D0.5\n &gt; ETag: bar\n &gt; Vary: =\r\nAuthentication\n &gt; Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=3Dentry\n &gt;\n &gt; A c=\r\nlient could infer that POST or PUT requests with Content-Type\n &gt; applicatio=\r\nn/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed would most likely return 406 on this\n &gt; server, alon=\r\ng with any other MIME type not specified in Accept. (One\n &gt; could also expo=\r\nse alternate representations by presenting a list of\n &gt; links in an HTML me=\r\nssage body returned with the 300 response, which\n &gt; seems to me like a neat=\r\n place to tuck the &quot;self-documentation&quot; for a\n &gt; REST application.)\n &gt;\n &gt; T=\r\nhis seems to me, to be in the spirit of RESTful self-descriptive\n &gt; messagi=\r\nng over HTTP. Sadly, RFC 2616 insists that the Accept header\n &gt; is only a r=\r\nequest header. Happily, I hear RFC 2616bis is back with\n &gt; an emphasis on e=\r\nxtensibility... except... Accept still insists on\n &gt; being a request header=\r\n only. :-( Although I could call it the Foo:\n &gt; header, apparently? More im=\r\nportantly, what am I missing that requires\n &gt; this to be implemented as hyp=\r\nertext, a la the APP service document?\n &gt;\n &gt; -Eric\n &gt;\n &gt; [1] http://labs.ap=\r\nache.org/webarch/http/draft-fielding-http/p3-payload.html#header.accept\n\n I=\r\n have no preference between a response header or a standard media\ntype (e.g=\r\n. WADL) but a single header isn&#39;t sufficient, as different\nverbs can accept=\r\n different media-types, so we need to say something\n&quot;PUT-Accept: xxx&quot;, &quot;PAT=\r\nCH-Accept: yyy&quot;.\n\n Other than that I agree that OPTIONS needs more love.\n\n =\r\nBest regards,\n Daniel Yokomizo.\n\n"}}
