The XHTML calls an\n&gt; XSLT processor to transform a more application-specific data format\n&gt; into an XHTML API suitable for manipulating that back-end format.\n&gt;\n\nI meant, &quot;into an XHTML (or SVG or etc.) API suitable...&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the goal of XHTML is for those intermediaries (i.e. it&#39;s not for\n&gt; &gt; the clients benefit, nor the servers benefit), that can work.\n&gt;\n\nThe goals of using XHTML are far more than the concerns of intermediary\ncomponents.  More clients have a general knowledge of your markup,\nwhich means more clients to extend with specific knowledge of your\nmarkup.  Re-using HTML (or Docbook) for basic list and table structures,\nis easier to maintain over time than re-inventing basic list and table\nstructures in a neverending variety of XML languages.  The purpose of\nusing XHTML is to satisfy the principle of generality.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The point of code-on-demand is to allow the capabilities of the UA\n&gt; &gt; to be extended. Extending it to understand a data format seems like\n&gt; &gt; quite a reasonable thing to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It depends(...)\n&gt;\n\nWhat I meant was, it depends on the ubiquity of the media type.\nExtending the capabilities of a browser to understand XSLT using an\nAJAXSLT engine is one thing.  Extending the browser to understand a\nproprietary media type may be applying REST&#39;s optional constraint, but\nthis is not a loophole for violating REST&#39;s self-descriptive messaging\nconstraint.\n\nIn case anyone has the patience to read my last post.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
