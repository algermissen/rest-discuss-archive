Behind the mailbox is a \ndispatcher that forwards the messages to some internal system \nfunction that will handle them.\n\nWhich means ebXML messages need to be tagged with a bunch of \ndispatching addresses that are usually not URIs.\n\nebXML has a collaboration containment hierarchy that goes like:\nBusinessCollaboration\n..BusinessTransaction\n....BusinessAction (Requesting or Responding)\n\nSo a message needs to be tagged with identifiers for each layer in \nthat hierarchy to get to its eventual destination (the handler for \nthe BusinessAction).  And all (or at least many) messages need to go \nthrough the same dispatcher.\n\nIf I consider that from a REST perspective, we&#39;re collaborating about \nsome business deal which is usually embodied in a common business \nentity: let&#39;s say an Order.\n\nSo if I make the Order into a Web resource, created by the initial \nPOST, then all subsequent POSTs or GETs are addressed either to that \nOrder resource or one of its sub-resources (LineItems, Deliveries, \nInvoices, Payments, etc.)\n\nI consider Transactions to be business entities, so they could be sub-\nresources.\n\nSo I no longer have one gateway URI with a dispatcher behind it, I am \ndirectly addressing the relevant business resource.\n\nSeems much simpler and more scalable to me.\n\n(By the way, if anybody from ebXML is reading this, I think this is \nall compatible with the business principles behind ebXML...so don&#39;t \nshoot me yet.)\n\nDoes this make sense to anybody else?\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
