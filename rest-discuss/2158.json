But it also says;\n\n &quot;Nothing in this specification specifically precludes the use of a delta encoding for the body of a PUT request. However, no mechanism currently exists for the client to discover if the server can interpret such messages, and so we do not attempt to specify how they might be used.&quot;\n\nRFC 2774 should help with that problem.\n\nThere would still be some issues with PUT, such as ensuring that the\nmessage remains stateless.  I think that specifying a target etag as\npart request would help, but I haven&#39;t thought it through.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
