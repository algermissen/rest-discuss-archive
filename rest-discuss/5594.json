The previous version of the spec associated the rdf:type of\n&gt; the processing resource, as declared via the form, to that\n&gt; information, but it needn&#39;t be the only information the client uses to\n&gt; base its decision upon, nor reflect as a pre-condition in the message.\n&gt;\n&gt; So to answer your question, the application should use different URIs\n&gt; to do those things.\n\nOk, yes. But should the application still use (for example) the type  \ninformation to tell the client what each processor is for?\n\nI am asking, because now that the client is not required anmore to  \ncommunicate the itent to the processor there is no way for the  \nprocessor to tell the client if it cannot fulfill that intent (a shoe  \norder processor might recognize message bodies that are not shoe  \norders and send the appropriate HTTP error code (BAD REQUEST?) but it  \nwould be less reliable than the former approach).\n\nIs it correct that you deliberately &#39;traded&#39; this reliability for  \nsimplicity and ease[1] of adoption (you mention the 80/20 rule)?\n\nSorry to be somewhat difficult, but I just want to check that I am on  \ntrack.\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] and the *possibility* to use specialized rf:Containers with plain  \nHTTP (without SOAP or similar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
