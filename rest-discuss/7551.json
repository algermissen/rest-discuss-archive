With many organizations, \n&gt; &gt; even large one, use the same &quot;Jell-O&quot; model [1] for \n&gt; &gt; infrastructure configuration as some companies use \n&gt; &gt; for shipping software; when it stops quivering it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; done!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OTOH, Nic was speaking about the large organizations \n&gt; &gt; where one departments often didn&#39;t care about the \n&gt; &gt; concerns of others.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Elliotte is correct that we could fix the problem by \n&gt; getting the proxy makers to change their proxies.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, how long would it take to fix the problem. The big \n&gt; organization that I was referring to had (amongst others) a \n&gt; Novell Netware proxy server. It was at least 10 years old.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently made a trip to a medium sized company who were \n&gt; still using Microsoft Proxy Server 1.0. I don&#39;t even want to \n&gt; think about how old that is.\n\nDamn!  I knew I forgot to address that one point. :)  But no need, as your\ncomments covered it perfectly; we can fix it for new equipment but installed\nequipment will take years if not over a decade to rotate out of use...\n\n&gt; &gt; Indeed all you may need to do when a customer tells \n&gt; &gt; you your system seems broken is say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re using \n&gt; &gt; proxy X? That&#39;s broken and non-spec compliant. Use \n&gt; &gt; proxy Y instead and all will be fine.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s fine, assuming that information gets to the right \n&gt; &gt; person in the company (which is a huge assumption) and \n&gt; &gt; that the right person doesn&#39;t have other tasks they view \n&gt; &gt; as higher priority (which is another big assumption.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree Mike. It&#39;s often really difficult to find out what is \n&gt; actually causing the problem. Unless you have network access \n&gt; to the client site in question it&#39;s almost impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; And Elliotte&#39;s assertion doesn&#39;t work at all if we&#39;re talking \n&gt; about a web 2.0 business like digg or flikr. If those sites \n&gt; used PUT and it failed for everyone nehind a crappy proxy \n&gt; just how many of those failures would get reported to them?\n\nThat&#39;s a great point I hadn&#39;t thought to make; if a company is selling\nexpensive services (something like a Salesforce.com), customers will fix\nproblems for them. But users will just give up on free high volume web 2.0\nsites like digg and flickr w/o even letting them know...\n\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, only people who are drawn to the technology for \n&gt; &gt; personal interest see this as important enough to allow it \n&gt; &gt; to affect other factors. For another perspective on this, ask \n&gt; &gt; the WHATWG editor Ian Hickson if \n&gt; &gt; he thinks browser vendors will support standards that could \n&gt; &gt; potentially minimize their marketshare in any way.[2]  Almost no \n&gt; &gt; company will be willing to limit it&#39;s marketshare for a technical \n&gt; &gt; ideal. The way to achieve the technical ideal on as broad basis as \n&gt; &gt; possible is to make that support painless, not by ignoring market \n&gt; &gt; realities with the claim that &quot;it is the right thing to do \n&gt; &gt; for the greater good.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Spec compliance happens in the end. It just takes a long time.\n\nAgreed. But you and are both agree that business as got to be done in the\nmean time.\n\n&gt; Of course, it would help if broken and rubbish \n&gt; implementations didn&#39;t get so widespread in the first place. \n&gt; But that&#39;s to do with the ridiculous amounts of hype that \n&gt; drives our industry.\n\nhehe.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
