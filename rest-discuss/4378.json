As the model \nis coupled to the view if we wanted to make the service available to \na third party for incorporation into one of their services they \nwould be constrained in how they delivered that service.\n \nAn example of a dependent query is when the user is interested in \nobtaining routing information for 2 geographical locations. The \nsequence of actions to obtain a route is as follows:\n \n1) From the initial query page the user enters in the name of the \nfeature, the district it&#39;s contained in, and the feature type: \nstreet, business, point of interest. On the server the query is \nexecuted returning a document with links to one or more features.\n  \n2) The user selects the link for a particular location. The server \nreturns a document with a link to display a detail page for that \nlocation. The response document also contains the query options \npresented on the initial page (a 2nd query is required for a route).\n \n3) The user enters the name of a 2nd feature, the feature type etc, \nand submits the page.  The server returns a document containing \nlinks to nodes that match the query.  Each of these links has the co-\nordinate information from the 1st query appended to them, though we \nare looking at putting this information into hidden fields to \novercome the problem with URL length limit.\n \n4) The user selects the link for the desired location and the server \nreturns a document containing a list of textual directions, an image \n(a visual representation of the route), and links for zooming or \npanning the image. The links for manipulating the image have the \noperation type, location co-ordinates etc appended to them.\n \nHope that gives a little more context to my initial question?\n\nKind regards,\nAdam\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;S.

I&#39;m attracted to the simplicity\n&gt; &gt; of the REST style and the lightweight requirements it\n&gt; &gt; places upon its clients but am not certain that I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; fully grasped how to apply it to our particular\n&gt; &gt; service.  One of the recommendations I&#39;m having\n&gt; &gt; difficulty visualizing is how I can eliminate client\n&gt; &gt; session management.  In our application parameters for\n&gt; &gt; a query may be dependent upon the results of a\n&gt; &gt; previous query as in the case of generating routing\n&gt; &gt; information.  I&#39;m providing a brief description of\n&gt; &gt; what our system does and some of the constraints\n&gt; &gt; imposed upon it by our target platforms and would be\n&gt; &gt; very interested on any comments, advice on how I might\n&gt; &gt; go about re-implementing the system in a RESTful\n&gt; &gt; style.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The LBS solution is currently provided to mobile\n&gt; &gt; phones.  The system provides maps, routing and\n&gt; &gt; directions in response to user GET and POST requests.\n&gt; &gt; Map images embedded in the resultant documents are\n&gt; &gt; cached on the server, other intermediate documents are\n&gt; &gt; generated but not cached. The current system is\n&gt; &gt; implemented through a number of ASP scripts that\n&gt; &gt; provide search, list, and detail pages for map\n&gt; &gt; locations.  Maps are generated dynamically for\n&gt; &gt; co-ordinates or named locations by a 3rd party system\n&gt; &gt; co-located on the same server and exposing an XML\n&gt; &gt; RPC-style interface.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In prototyping the current non-REST system we\n&gt; &gt; discovered several limitations related to the phone\n&gt; &gt; handsets:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Some handsets have a maximum URL length of 255\n&gt; &gt; characters.  Passing session state in the URL along\n&gt; &gt; with co-ordinate pairs frequently took us above this\n&gt; &gt; limit.\n&gt; &gt; - Cookie support cannot be guaranteed for the phone\n&gt; &gt; browser precluding the use of native session-tracking\n&gt; &gt; mechanisms on the server\n&gt; &gt; - Variations in WML rendering require document\n&gt; &gt; transformation to phone-specific WML if optimal\n&gt; &gt; presentation is to be achieved\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; &gt; Adam Ratcliffe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Find local movie times and trailers on Yahoo!
