I was\n&gt; looking for a way to indicate the status and indicate that processing will\n&gt; continue. The 202 Accepted status doesn&#39;t leave much room for indicating\n&gt; whether the processing is in a transient error situation (database is down\n&gt; for nightly backup, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; I almost want to say NOTIFY is idempotent and POST isn&#39;t  - but I don&#39;t know\n&gt; what that all means anyway.\n&gt; The message-in-a-message can be avoided if the response status can be\n&gt; tunneled in a request header like Status:\n\nWhat you&#39;re describing is almost exactly the proper interpretation of the\nsemantic differences between POST and PUT.  Think of it this way:  the callback\nresource models the current state of the request as it evolves over time.\nPOSTing to that resource in effect modifies the state of that resource as the\ntransaction (using term loosely, don&#39;t get hung up here) progresses, while the\nfinal PUT effectively sets the final state of that resource.  The application\ncould then, presumably, delete the resource in question.\n\nA rather sloppy but perhaps illustrative way to think of it:\n\nPOST is like        echo &quot;something&quot; &gt;&gt; foo\nPUT is like          echo &quot;something final&quot; &gt; foo\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
