I can even call OPTIONS on the resource first to\nsee\n&gt; &gt;&gt; if=\r\n it allows me to alter the order. For new orders, GET and PUT can\nbe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; r=\r\neturned. For canceled or shipped orders, just GET is returned. And\nat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nany time I can GET /orders/new, /orders/canceled, /orders/shipped,\netc.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Trying to alter any of those resources returns 405 Method Not\nAllowed.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, I can see making things like /canceled etc. writable, if your\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requirement was to treat an order cancellation as a thing unto\nitself\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Wall St. probably works that way), and you wanted to allow users\nto\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; track a cancellation and allow the business to report easily on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ca=\r\nncellations. But that doesn&#39;t seem to work here, where an order\ncan\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;m=\r\nove itself&quot; into other states, like shipped.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So, where did I go o=\r\nff the rails?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong with a collection changin=\r\ng in-between\n&gt; &gt; GETs. CANCELLED and SHIPPED bins are shared resources and =\r\nunless a\nclient\n&gt; &gt; can have exclusive control over them, it simply has to =\r\nexpect that\n&gt; &gt; they may change without its knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; YS.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; That I understand. I guess I wasn&#39;t clear. To restate.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have a =\r\nresource called an order which can be in several states:\nnew,\n&gt; shipped, ca=\r\nnceled (I&#39;ll ignore the rest). That gives us at least three\n&gt; resource coll=\r\nections /new-orders, /canceled-orders, and\n/shipped-orders\n&gt; (or /orders, /=\r\norders/canceled, /orders/shipped or ...). Stefan\n&gt; recommends that if a use=\r\nr wants to cancel an order they should post\nthe\n&gt; URI of the new (open) ord=\r\ner to the /canceled-orders resource, and the\n&gt; server &quot;moves&quot; the order fro=\r\nm the new bucket to the canceled bucket.\n&gt; Whereas my instinct is to model =\r\nthe order with a status field, GET the\n&gt; order, change the status, and PUT =\r\nit back. Leaving /canceled-orders\nand\n&gt; /shipped-orders to be read-only, co=\r\nnvenience resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can see two reasons for doing it Stefan&#39;s way. 1=\r\n. If canceling and\n&gt; shipping an shipping an order are unique business proc=\r\nesses. For\n&gt; instance, if it is required that a &quot;cancel order&quot; request be s=\r\nubmitted\n&gt; (and thus be trackable), and the request itself is a resource, w=\r\nhich\ncan\n&gt; in turn be approved/disapproved, retrieved, etc. 2. To support, =\r\nas\n&gt; Stefan noted, the ability to locate the various resources/services on\n=\r\n&gt; separate servers without any backend dependencies (e.g., a database).\n&gt; B=\r\noth of these are valid, but neither are automatic. So my question\n&gt; again, =\r\nis there anything wrong with my seemingly straightforward means\n&gt; of alteri=\r\nng the status of an order or is it just another, legitimate,\n&gt; way of doing=\r\n things?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Pete\n&gt;\nDoes resource have to match implementation under the =\r\ncovers?  Couldn&#39;t I\nPOST to /shipped-orders and it be represented internall=\r\ny as the &quot;status&quot;\nfield being populated on the order?  I would hope so.\n\nHa=\r\nving said that , as the original poster, I contemplated just PUT&#39;ing\nthe ch=\r\nanged resource back to /orders/[orderID] however I didn&#39;t feel\ncomfortable =\r\nwith the fact that I would have to interrogate the &quot;status&quot;\nfield to actual=\r\nly know what &quot;operation&quot; I needed to perform (assume that\nshipping an order=\r\n involves more than just changing the orders status\ne.g. sends an e-mail ad=\r\nditionally while canceling does not ).  Maybe I\nam missing something.\n\n\n\n"}}
