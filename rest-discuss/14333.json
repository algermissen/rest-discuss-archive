They\ndid not HAVE to. They COULD have simply changed the media type, and\n406&#39;d the old clients.\n\nObviously, &quot;suddenly&quot;, all of the old client fail miserably, and are\ncut off from the service until they upgrade. No backward compatibility\nhere.\n\nAs for &quot;evolutionary&quot; software, it&#39;s pretty clear that it doesn&#39;t\nevolve. Rather you have backward compatibility that gives an illusion\nof evolution. The existing clients aren&#39;t changing, the service is\nsimply being friendly by keeping them in mind and not locking them\nout.\n\nI don&#39;t see any way that REST differs from SOAP, or any other system\nin this regard. As you&#39;ve observed, compliance and compatibility are\nhard coded in to the clients and server. If the protocol changes, the\nclients and servers need to be changed to remain compatible.\n\nVersioning and backward compatibility is the key to a robust, evolving\ninfrastructure. I think REST is better for such a system than\nsomething like SOAP simply because I think it is easier for a more\nadvanced client to leverage the latest services and APIs, as well as\nfor a server to better maintain compatibility with older clients.\n\nBoth of these are done through extensible types and con neg. As you\nget more and more servers and clients on different upgrade cycles,\nthis capability become more important. It&#39;s easy to see how you might\nget consumers using services that you, as the provider, particularly\nin an &quot;open&quot; enterprise, didn&#39;t even really &quot;know&quot; were being\nserviced.\n\nIn the end, though things like typed rels, and online documentation,\nideally when something goes wrong, payload inspection will direct the\npeople maintaining the consumers towards what they need to change to\nbecome compliant again and able to use the new service.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
