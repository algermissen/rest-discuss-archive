I may want even go further that web services in their \nnature maybe do not need to fulfil the &quot;hypermedia as the engine of \napplication state&quot;-constraint, or? The UI stuff would mostly realized \nvia another component (even if this component a web site) of the \napplication that consumes that web services.\nSo why bothering all the time about non-RESTful REST approximations. I \ncan imagine that it hurts when someone applies a term where this term is \nnot really appropriate. However, that is a quite natural thing in our \nsociety that happens all time because. We can not assume that everyone \nwho uses a term is so educated that he/she can be sure in applying the \nterm in a correct way. Curiously, we often understand each other even \nwhen utilizing such misconceptions (application of a term in a wrong way).\nI think also Roy T. Fielding maybe stopped bothering meanwhile about \nthis, or? We can&#39;t really reject that non-RESTful utilizing when \ncategorizing a service (or whatever) as RESTful.\nThat&#39;s life ;)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n\n"}}
