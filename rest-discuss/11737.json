Looking around the internet it \n&gt; seemed that=\r\n the de facto way of doing this would be:\n&gt; \n&gt; application/vnd.myformat+xml=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, just register &quot;myformat&quot; with IANA and have:\n&gt; \n&gt; application/myf=\r\normat+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; One huge downside of this though is that my browser does not=\r\n know\nhow to \n&gt; render application/myformat+xml.  \n\nThis is a really annoyi=\r\nng issue.  It is really too bad that browsers\ndon&#39;t render any unrecognized=\r\n `+xml` media type as XML.  Maybe we\nshould lobby the browsers to add this =\r\nfeature.  \n\nHave you considered just serving your documents as `application=\r\n/xml`\nwhen the requester is as browser?\n\n&gt; So, my question to this list is,=\r\n why \n&gt; aren&#39;t MIME properties used to identify XML schema?  For example:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; application/xml; schema=3Dhttp://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\n\nWell, it is tech=\r\nnically illegal as the application/xml media type does\nnot define a &quot;schema=\r\n&quot; attribute.  In practice it would probably not\nbreak anything.  Is it pret=\r\nty ugly, though: `application/atom+xml` is\nmuch nicer than `application/xml=\r\n; schema=3Dhttp://www.w3.org/2005/Atom`.\n\n\n\n"}}
