The main advantage as I see it is that they will have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; less to learn and that we will will converge on a more stable set of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relations which in turn will make it possible to create more generic\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code for indexing, crawling etc. Just make sure you create and define\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your own rel types according to the atom spec [2].\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally i don&#39;t much like atom:link.  It trades clarity for a false\n&gt;&gt;&gt; promise of re-use.  The idea that a great deal of leverage will be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gained by reusing atom:link in other formats seems not be born out in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reality.  Parsing arbitrary xml documents, looking for link elements\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and then doing things with them without understanding the semantics of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the overall representation sounds pretty far fetched to me.  (Is that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; edit link for the requested resource, or is it for a different\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource whose information is contained in the requested one.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The `&lt;{name} href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;` pattern promotes the meaningful name of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; item to the highest possible level.  This increases the clarity of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; representation.  As a client writer i care about semantics of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; various parts of the representations far more than i care about their\n&gt;&gt;&gt; types.  I can guess with little effort that an element named &#39;edit&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will contain a link.  With a link element i must scan to the right\n&gt;&gt;&gt; until i find the @rel in order to understand the purpose of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; element.  I&#39;ll take clarity over vague, unrealistic, promises of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; re-use any day.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To me&lt;atom:link rel=&quot;{name}&quot; href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;  is equal to&lt;{name} href=&quot;&quot;/&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree they are semantically equivalent.  However, the arrangement of\n&gt; information in an atom:link element increases the effort required to\n&gt; understand it.  Not much of course, but a little.  I prefer not to\n&gt; intentionally increase the complexity of my representations unless it\n&gt; provide a very real benefit.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;arrangement of information&quot;. \nDo you mean that they have to go and read the Atom specification?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides, we have the link header[1] which is better, in every\n&gt;&gt;&gt; imaginable way, than atom:link for expressing common relations.  It\n&gt;&gt;&gt; does not require the client be able to parse a particular format and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it unambiguously relates the link to the requested resource as a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; whole.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1]:&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Link headers is mostly useful for linking *entire resources* to other\n&gt;&gt; *resources* while atom:link gives you a more fine grained linking mechanism.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not against link headers in anyway, just saying it&#39;s a slightly\n&gt;&gt; different thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly.  The ambiguity of link elements (due to their fine\n&gt; grainedness) works against any real world re-use of them.  Clien have\n&gt; to understand the whole representation that contains link elements in\n&gt; order to use those links.  Therefore, there is little, or no,\n&gt; practical benefit to using atom:link elements but there is some cost.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean here. What I&#39;m saying that \ninstead of using your own &lt;FooLink&gt; you use should consider using \n&lt;atom:link&gt;. Link headers really doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Atom&#39;s \nlink element type.\n\n--\nTrygve\n\n"}}
