Word smithing, I \n&gt; know, but it&#39;s\n&gt; important to grok how general the dynamic is.\n\nThe link *selections* (actions) drive the state transitions, not the\nlinks themselves.  The engine *drives* the car; the highway does not\npull it along.  &quot;Dereferencing of hypertext links&quot; is the engine of\napplication state, taking the active interpretation of &quot;engine&quot;.  Enough\nwordsmithing.  It&#39;s not all that important, is it?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
