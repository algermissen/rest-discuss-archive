Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have no problem discussing the issue, within the confines of my\n&gt; own example. I see your point, but I define &quot;identical request&quot; to\n&gt; mean a combination of factors being identical. For instance, issuing\n&gt; a DELETE request to one of my 410 Gone resources will result in a\n&gt; 400 Bad Request result every single time that identical request is\n&gt; repeated. However, if you add a conditional If-Match to that DELETE\n&gt; request, in other words after you&#39;ve *modified* the request from\n&gt; before, you get a different result.\n\nAlthough I believe that you may be technically correct here, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that for most people a request is a\ncombination &lt;method, uri, host header, entity&gt;. Nowhere in HTTP can I\nthink of an example of a request whose essential meaning is modified\nby a request header (except, as above, host, which is only not part of\nthe URI as a matter of history). The request headers are there to make\nminor modifications to a request, not to change the overall meaning.\n\nAdditionally, there is almost certainly going to be confusion when\nclients try to DELETE a resource & discover that there is now added\nsemantics to the DELETE method in the form of If-Match, added\nsemantics which are *required* to successfully perform a DELETE on\nyour system. This added confusion may be worse than the technical\nnon-idempotence of your original two stage DELETE.\n\n&gt; [â€¦]\n\n&gt; Take any everyday not-anything-to-do-with-me DELETE usage. The first\n&gt; time a resource is DELETEd, a 2xx response is issued. The next time\n&gt; that identical resource is DELETEd, a 4xx response is issued. The\n&gt; time after that, and every other N &gt; _1_ time the identical request\n&gt; is repeated there&#39;s a 4xx response. The reason this is still\n&gt; idempotent under the N &gt; 0 rule is because of the exception to that\n&gt; rule, in parentheses, which says &quot;aside from error... issues&quot; in\n&gt; other words, 4xx responses aren&#39;t counted.\n\nNo, the reason that multiple DELETEs are idempotent is that they have\nthe same side effect (viz., the resource is deleted). What is returned\nas a response is not an issue.\n\nI am not going to suggest that you not implement this, but I must\nsuggest that you consider, when you have received as much resistance\nas your two stage DELETE has, if it is worth all the trouble. Many\npeople have had a bad reaction to various aspects of this idea.\n\nbest,\nErik Hetzner\n\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Jul_10_11:09:42_2007-1\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Jul_10_11:09:42_2007-1--\r\n\n"}}
