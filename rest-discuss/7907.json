HTTP clients and servers do received the same\nD=\r\nata but they use it in different ways. The Restlet API reuses the\nsame clas=\r\nses to model the Data exchanged but has separate classes to\nprocess it, dep=\r\nending on your role in the HTTP exchange (client or\nserver). See Data defin=\r\nition in REST:\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#se=\r\nc_5_2_1\n\nMy point is that there&#39;s no binary separation, life is a bit more\n=\r\ncomplex here. Some artifacts can be shared between a client and server\n(the=\r\n data and metadata), while others have to be designed specifically\nfor clie=\r\nnts or for servers. In the Restlet API, we&#39;ve tried to find a\nbalance betwe=\r\nen both needs: reuse and specificity.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying JSR 311 should have=\r\n separate APIs for client/server, \n&gt; just pointing out that there are scena=\r\nrios where it is desirable.\n\nIn my opinion, JSR 311 should exclusively targ=\r\net the server-side role.\nThe true challenge it to properly map between obje=\r\nct-oriented domain\nobjects (POJOs) and RESTful resources and representation=\r\ns. This is\ncomparable to the mapping between POJOs and RDBMS (EJB/JPA/Hiber=\r\nnate)\nor between POJOs and RDF graphs (Sommer).\n\nBest regards,\nJerome\n\n\n\n"}}
