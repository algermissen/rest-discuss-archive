While pursuing every dirty trick in the book to divest from me\nthe steamboat.com domain name for zero compensation, the Steamboat Ski\nand Resort Corporation was contracting with me for Internet services\nand consulting...\n\nOne of the coolest feats of DIY engineering I&#39;ve ever come across was\nthe realtime GUI for the snowmaking system.  The snowmaking chief\nhacked it together himself using MS Access (!) of all things.  He then\ndismissed one consultant after another, for basically not telling him\nwhat he wanted to hear when he asked us about networking his solution.\n\nWhich, for the record, was &quot;Sure, no problem, MS Access can do\nanything, including distributed client-server!&quot; and also why the single-\ncomputer prototype was never networked successfully...\n\nHad I known then what I know now, and had SVG existed, I could have\neasily come up with a REST encapsulation layer, which could then be\ncontrolled from a handheld over a wireless LAN, or controlled from the\nchief&#39;s home computer via the Internet.\n\nCertain aspects of snowmaking systems are intensely visual -- the guys\nrunning the system don&#39;t care so much what a valve does, beyond knowing\nthat it needs to be in position X for operation A and position Y for\noperation B.  So reading some HTML displaying the degrees from vertical\nof some named handle, even with an image inlined, would be useless.\n\nIn Access, this guy had designed a visual representation of his system,\nand could click on the handle to change it from X to Y so he could tell\nwith his eyeballs that his software settings correlated to his desired\nhardware settings.  Then he could create macros to change the entire\nsetup from A to B, and visually confirm success.\n\nGauges weren&#39;t images of gauges next to digital readouts either, they\nwere visual, with the same green-yellow-red range markings as the\nsystem&#39;s analog gauges.  One look at this MS Access creation, and you&#39;d\nknow it couldn&#39;t be represented in HTML and preserve any usability.\nSVG, OTOH, looking back now?  Perfect.\n\nNo, I don&#39;t remember what product he was using to create enhanced\nvisual interfaces in MS Access.  But it was really cool.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
