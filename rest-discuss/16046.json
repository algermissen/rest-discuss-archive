It must be Friday or something, this is one of those\n&gt; fundamental REST design patterns that&#39;s simply beyond dispute.  If I\n&gt; can create form markup that builds that query, and return 400 for any\n&gt; value over 360 or under -360, well, that&#39;s about as simple as hypertext\n&gt; REST APIs get.\n\nI don&#39;t follow your argument, as POST and GET are equally valid for a\nform. The decision point seems to be a whether a resource was created or\nnot - only the server can know and the server therefore can dictate the\nappropriate method (especially if its forms driven). So either method\nmay be appropriate.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n"}}
