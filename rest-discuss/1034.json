Knowing\nwhere other people are coming from can help in understanding each other and\nin communicating with and educating each other.\n\nIn my view, the current crop of Web application development tools is overly\nfocused on user interface aspects.\nWhen I see development tools and servers project &#39;MVC&#39; as a good way to\nbuild applications, it seems like they are looking from the server inward\nand applying MVC, where I see the value in looking at the server outward and\napplying MVC concepts. Design a system to separate data, presentation and\nlogic /outside/ the web server. This lets you build applications that span a\nsingle server - whether clustered or not.\n\nAnother thought I had was to daydream about what a real REST oriented Web\nserver development environment would look like. I&#39;m imagining a blend of a\nRDBMS interface with HTTP/REST concepts - rather than saying &quot;create table\nusers (userid int, email varchar(255))&quot; we could say &quot;create collection\nusers (userid uri)&quot; or something. And we could easily build user interface\nwithout putting the UI template in the URI. &quot;when user-agent like mozilla%&quot;\nor &quot;when accept like text/%&quot; or something.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
