I wrote vanilla XSLT 1.0 and only used MS extensions where \n&gt; &gt; XSLT 1.0 was woefully inadequate.\n&gt; \n&gt; That you used MS extensions suggest you really didn&#39;t get it. \n&gt; That you were working with the MS XSLT in the first place \n&gt; suggests you had problems you have improperly diagnosed, and \n&gt; you&#39;re assigning the blame to the wrong cause.\n\nYeah well maybe I didn&#39;t.  But they neither could anyone else on the XLST\nlist give me any alternatives, and that included Michael Kay.\n\nOf course, I&#39;m sure you could have done better. \n\n&gt; &gt; Pullease.  I&#39;d write XSLT for an XML document, and then another XML \n&gt; &gt; document that validates to the same schema would trigger \n&gt; differences \n&gt; &gt; in the XSLT transform; it would either break or produce \n&gt; output that I wasn&#39;t expecting.\n&gt; &gt; It was a nightmare to debug those situations and they happened over \n&gt; &gt; and over.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s not a side effect. That&#39;s an indication of bad code. \n&gt; Properly written, XSLT can handle a wide variation of inputs. \n&gt; However testing and debugging is as necessary as in any other \n&gt; software system. It&#39;s not magic.\n\nWell I guess I was just unable to &quot;get&quot; the &quot;right&quot; way to do XSLT.  And as\nI tend to be a lot more technically advanced than the average person, even\nmore reason to argue against XSLT for mainstream use.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever language you were working with it certainly doesn&#39;t sound \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like XSLT. It sounds like someone fed you a haggis for Christmas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dinner, called it a turkey, and consequently you now think \n&gt; we&#39;re all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; crazy because we say we love turkey.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your annoying use of condescention given you really have no \n&gt; knowledge \n&gt; &gt; of my experience only reflects negatively on you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going by what you posted. But what you say continues to \n&gt; strongly suggest that you encountered well known problems as \n&gt; a direct result of use of non-standard Microsoft technologies.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said repeatedly, I did my best to stick to the standard and only use\nMS extensions when I could find no other ways.\n\nThat said, please address how to handle this in XSLT 1.0 if MS&#39; extensions\nare not the answer:\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/gettingpastthexslterrorexpressionmustevalua\ntetoanodeset/\n\n&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t know them it&#39;s because you don&#39;t get out much.\n&gt; &gt; Google for JSON vs. XML and you&#39;ll find lots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again,you&#39;re misdiagnosing. XSLT is not the issue here. Even \n&gt; XML isn&#39;t really the issue. It&#39;s DOM. You&#39;re seeing symptoms, \n&gt; but you&#39;re badly misdiagnosing the causes.\n\nWhatever.\n\n&gt; &gt; And here are two more XSLT-related blog posts I wrote from 2004: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/rantingaboutxsltsverbosity/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/goodxslttutorial/\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, the second one seems to include quite a bit of \n&gt; non-standard Microsft XSLT and imperative thinking, and you \n&gt; thought that was a good tutorial? I can see why you had problems.\n\nYou can&#39;t write without being condescending, can you?\n\n&gt; &gt; And run this query: http://www.google.com/search?q=xslt+schinkel  \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ll find more than enough g*d d*mn evidence that YES I have used \n&gt; &gt; XSLT.  Thank you very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; I scanned a few of those. Looks like to me like you had some \n&gt; of the classic problems of an imperative programmer trying to \n&gt; migrate to a functional language.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t doubt you had problems, but they simply didn&#39;t arise \n&gt; for the reasons you think they did.\n\nAgain, whatever.  I notice you didn&#39;t actually address any of those &quot;classic\nproblems&quot;, nor did you apologize for accusing me of never having used XSLT.\n\nAnything that is counter-intuitive to wide swaths of the populations and\nthat requires a condescending &quot;expert&quot; to annoint &quot;the proper way of doing\nthings&quot; is not an appropriate candidate for general purpose use on the web.\nTake your religion elsewhere.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n\n\n"}}
