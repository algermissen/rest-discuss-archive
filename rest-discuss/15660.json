Another way of getting the media is using embedded metadata in the\n&gt; media itself. That is done, for instance, using the link. The\n&gt; mediatype attribute will tell you specifically which media you should\n&gt; expect to use for a particular link and operation. Of course, that\n&gt; reduces a bit the visibility (since an interim node should know the\n&gt; media the link is embedded in to be able to &quot;see&quot; it) and also limits\n&gt; the negotiation (the link &quot;suggests&quot; the media).\n&gt; \n\nOnce more:  @type has absolutely nothing remotely to do with content\nnegotiation, it does not &quot;limit&quot; it, it does not &quot;drive&quot; it, and it\ndoes not reduce visibility (not using @type reduces visibility).\n\nIt is simply an annotation.  Not any sort of instruction.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
