The extreme would be a  \n&gt; component that downloads itself almost completely at runtime (modulo  \n&gt; the HTTP implementation).\n\nThis sounds a lot like the web-trend of downloading only a javascript\nengine that evals into a highly-dynamic app w/in the client, which makes\nnetwork requests through the browser, rather than the browser itself...\n\n... I think the question is: what happens next?  If that\n&quot;demanding&quot; [:)] client never needs to contact the network again, then\nit&#39;s hard to say it has crossed a line that it doesn&#39;t use.  OTOH, if\nit&#39;s future communications are RESTful, then they are... or are not, as\nthe case might be.\n\nOne could download code that subsequently does nothing but jsled-RPC\n(TM :) calls, which starts to subvert REST.  This is minorly impeded by\nthe javascript engine in web browsers only easily allowing http, and not\nraw socket, access... but that&#39;s just a matter of time.  I fear this\nhappening pretty soon, actually, as javascript-in-browser is quite\ncapable and things like [1] are popping up all the time... how soon\nbefore you need -- effectively -- a custom &quot;client&quot; to access each site\non the net?\n\nOf course, it could easily go the other way: right now every dynamic\nwebsite tends to set every page to effectively be no-cache, because it&#39;s\na mix of static and dynamic pieces ... but if that engine can request\nthose things more granularly, then maybe we can use ETags,\nconditional-gets, &c. more widely and effectively.\n\n\nIn any case, downloading components that encapsulate server-defined\nfunctionality/interfaces/concepts/&c. can be useful, and a useful\nalternative to network traffic (i.e. forcing the client to invoke the\nserver to do that work).\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/10/06#2005-10-getGzipReportDownloadUrl\n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
