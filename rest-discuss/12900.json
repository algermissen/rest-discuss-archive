Neither &quot;?&quot; nor &quot;#&quot; belong to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; t=\r\nhe HTTP layer. Those are part of RFC 3986, and the fact that browsers\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n&gt; don&#39;t send the part of the URI after the &quot;#&quot; separator to servers is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n &gt; dictated by the media type (primarily the HTML family).\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I am not sure what you are saying, other than that you are saying \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n incorrect information. There is URIs mentioned in the HTTP spec, and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthere is the HTTP URI scheme. The HTTP URI scheme does not say anything \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; about fragment identifiers.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s what Subbu is trying to tell you =\r\n- how to dispatch on a fragid is \n&gt; defined by the media type not the trans=\r\nfer protocol or URI processing.\n\n\n\n&gt; Fragment identifiers are broken as des=\r\nigned in the web architecture. As \n&gt; we say in Ireland, I wouldn&#39;t start fr=\r\nom there.\n\nThen where would you start from?  Maybe I am missing a completel=\r\ny obvious practical or even theoretical alternative to this.  I&#39;ve said in =\r\nthe past that fragment identifiers are broken, because they are not object-=\r\noriented and do not lend themselves well to representing object-oriented hy=\r\npermedia.  I am not sure where you or anyone else stands on &quot;fragment ident=\r\nifiers are broken&quot;.  I don&#39;t know of any RFC or any IETF document that says=\r\n this, anywhere.\n\n&gt; &gt; Likewise, you will note in the practical sense of &quot;wh=\r\nat to expect in \n&gt; &gt; real world implementations&quot;, that Search Engines do no=\r\nt index content \n&gt; &gt; after the #. This imposes a real world practical limit=\r\nation on real \n&gt; &gt; world use. However, Google killing the question mark is =\r\nhuge. This kind \n&gt; &gt; of opens the door, just a crack, about the idea of Goo=\r\ngle having to \n&gt; &gt; require its Sitemap technology be able to understand fra=\r\ngment \n&gt; &gt; identifiers. In hypermedia theory, this means we can finally sta=\r\nrt \n&gt; &gt; building Web applications with &quot;open linking&quot; and &quot;deep linking&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Since you&#39;re say you&#39;re coming from this from a practical angle, I woul=\r\nd \n&gt; say it means user agents will need to know a lot more about media type=\r\ns \n&gt; than they do today, which is a very real form of coupling. Probably th=\r\nat \n&gt; will get pushed up to application developers.\n\nNo, you have it wrong,=\r\n in my humble opinion.  Today, the user agent we all use, The Web Browser M=\r\nodel, is too tightly coupled to the media type.  The Web Browser is a progr=\r\nam that has to know how to render the media formats it receives.  It has to=\r\n be way too smart.  I am arguing for the dumbing down of this and returning=\r\n to a more reasonable Object-Oriented approach where &quot;you don&#39;t need a brow=\r\nser&quot;, where your code and data go together.  The idea that a browser should=\r\n know how to render HTML is backwards.  Notice that I am saying the Browser=\r\n should simply be a gateway, and that inside the browser we can embed appli=\r\ncation-specific gateways.  In this way, the Browser can be configured more =\r\ntowards user preference.  Currently, if you want to write a Browser app, yo=\r\nu talk to a DOM Bridge that provides some Javascript call.  You shouldn&#39;t e=\r\nven know you are doing that.  Something like an HREF is a pervasive way of =\r\nthinking, and therefore by state-of-the-art we have tightly coupled the res=\r\nource identification mechanism with the browser&#39;s transfer agent.  Even new=\r\n technologies directly code against this model, and _that_ is the problem f=\r\nor application developers.\n\nSome big company like Microsoft writes an API l=\r\nike the Silverlight Navigation Framework, and it is tightly coupled to the =\r\nbrowser&#39;s transfer agent.  Then every application developer in the world wh=\r\no programs for that Silverlight media type is tightly coupled.\n\nI think of =\r\nthe Browser of the future as a software configuration management tool, with=\r\n ability to get out of the way of user accessibility issues and the like.  =\r\nThe Browser should give you a flexible, scalable, distributed model for acc=\r\nessing content like object-oriented programs.\n\nYou could certainly argue th=\r\nat HTML/XHTML decouples interface from implementation, but that is a ridicu=\r\nlous argument -- we all know from just looking at the gold standard for ren=\r\ndering pages, the Acid Test, that nobody can even correctly implement these=\r\n interfaces.  So it makes more sense to talk about shipping a working versi=\r\nonable object, a component, that has code+data.  I think the best explanati=\r\non of this from an engineering standpoint, for MBAs, is Joel Spolsky&#39;s Mart=\r\nian Headsets.  (Although I&#39;ve written a similar essay, it is nowhere near a=\r\ns funny or entertaining, and I take myself too seriously.)\n\n&gt; &gt; I guess I a=\r\nm just using REST to build real applications and not simply \n&gt; &gt; writing ab=\r\nout REST for the sake of writing about it. I&#39;m not a client \n&gt; &gt; looking fo=\r\nr stuff to stick in a PowerPoint presentation to show my boss.\n&gt; \n&gt; You don=\r\n&#39;t need to justify yourself here.\n\nThanks.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately this is a detai=\r\nl \n&gt; of the web&#39;s implementation/specs more than REST canon.\n\n\n\nhmm, I am n=\r\not sure what your last sentence means?  I can sort of perhaps see an argume=\r\nnt for saying &quot;this is not REST&quot;, but since a lot of this discussion revolv=\r\nes around media types and Roy acknowledges that part of his thesis as being=\r\n wanting, I thought I would start to color it in with my own opinions.\n\nI g=\r\nuess I am reading your sentence as &quot;Unfortunately this is a detail we do no=\r\nt talk about, even though it needs improvement.&quot;  Perhaps not fair, but whe=\r\nre else are you leading me?  It sounds like what I need to hear then is &quot;st=\r\nop going down this direction, you need to re-crystallize, here is what you =\r\nneed to go and where you need to go.&quot;\n\nIf you are simply saying &quot;the browse=\r\nr networking stack needs improvement&quot;, then okay, but I&#39;m not waiting until=\r\n 2022 for HTML5 to see something done.\n\n\n"}}
