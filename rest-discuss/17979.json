These are time \nconsuming operations and some of us our team members are suggesting to use SOAP \nfor these. Have two questions.\n\n1. Can we use REST for these maintenance operations? If so, can you let me know \npointers of examples?\n2. If SOAP is better fit, is that OK to hybrid web services implementation \nsupporting both REST and SOAP? Wouldn&#39;t this confuse/complicate client \ndevelopers?\n\nThanks,\n\n-rama\n\n\n"}}
