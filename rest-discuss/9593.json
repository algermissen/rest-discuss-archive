The fact that Atompub alone is not enough to mo=\r\ndel \n&gt; the full semantics of the application is no more to the point \n&gt; tha=\r\nn the fact that HTTP isn=92t either.

I agre=\r\ne with your points here, but I can&#39;t seem to get you to\nunderstand mine.  M=\r\naybe I&#39;m just too tired and we&#39;ll just have to leave my\npoints for another =\r\nday? :)\n\n&gt; (Is there an echo in here? Am I repeating myself? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; No, yo=\r\nu=92re not. I see two different statements. If the latter \n&gt; is what you me=\r\nant by the first, then the first one was not \n&gt; explicit enough for me to u=\r\nnderstand it clearly.\n\nThat was a joke. Are you German?  \n\nFYI, I&#39;ve got st=\r\nrong German heritage (&quot;Schinkel&quot;), so that comment was\nself-depreciating as=\r\n much as anything. :)\n\n&gt; Considering the latter argument, though, I=92m not=\r\n sure how \n&gt; =93just having a browser=94 solves the problem that Atompub \n&gt;=\r\n purportedly does not. Is it because HTML bundles the app \n&gt; chrome alongsi=\r\nde the data, which Atompub does not?\n\nOne reason is that web-services-on-HT=\r\nML (WSO-HTML?) can empower &quot;happy\naccidents&quot; whereas that is unlikely for A=\r\ntomPub anytime in the foreseeable\nfuture.  IOW, people surfing a combine we=\r\nbsite/web-service are more apt to\naccidentally visualize how they can write=\r\n web services to interact with the\nsite whereas most likely only people who=\r\n pre-envision using web services\nwill be likely to move forward with buildi=\r\nng Web Services from AtomPub.\n\nAnd for those who do decide to pursue web se=\r\nrvices being able to surf the\nweb service only requires the browser.  &quot;Surf=\r\ning&quot; an AtomPub service will\nrequire specialized clients.  The more &quot;surfab=\r\nle&quot; a web service is, the more\napproachable it is IMO.\n\nNot to mention the =\r\nfact that building WSO-HTML means that only one project\nis required to be a=\r\npproved by its sponsor (company, government agency,\ndepartment, manager, et=\r\nc.) instead of two, albeit one with more constraints.\n\n&gt; If so, I don=92t s=\r\nee this as a strong objection. I assume we \n&gt; will see technologies other t=\r\nhan HTML (eg. XForms) or \n&gt; complementary to HTML (eg. you an HTML page gen=\r\nerated by an \n&gt; XSL transform referred to from an xml-stylesheet PI in the =\r\n\n&gt; Atompub service document =96 assuming browsers had support for \n&gt; PUT an=\r\nd DELETE, and/or your server knew how to tunnel them \n&gt; through POST for le=\r\ngacy browser).\n\nGood. :)\n\n&gt; That sounds to me like =93it doesn=92t work the=\r\n way it always \n&gt; used to and that freaks me out.=94 There are developments=\r\n that \n&gt; weird me out too, but what they make me worry about is me, \n&gt; not =\r\nthe new ways; I don=92t want to get crusty and set in my ways.\n\nNo, it&#39;s mo=\r\nre like recognizing Jakob&#39;s law:\nhttp://notebook.arkane-systems.net/index.p=\r\nhp/Jakob&#39;s_Law_of_the_Web_User_Exp\nerience\n\n&gt; See also http://www.douglasad=\r\nams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html\n\nFunny, my Well Designed URLs initiative [1]=\r\n is consistent with that...\n\n&gt; &gt; I strongly believe there should be only on=\r\ne primary format for the \n&gt; &gt; web, HTML.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTML is going exactly nowhere=\r\n. All of the content I consume \n&gt; on the web today is HTML. However most of=\r\n the time it comes \n&gt; wrapped in something that=92s not `text/html`. What I=\r\n see is \n&gt; just the application chrome moving out of HTML and into \n&gt; struc=\r\ntured formats so that the content can stand pure and \n&gt; undiluted. I don=92=\r\nt see how you can disagree that this is a \n&gt; good thing unless you prefer v=\r\nisiting 300 sites in your \n&gt; browser over reading them in an aggregator.\n\nI=\r\n don&#39;t follow your vision for the future well enough to agree or disagree.\n=\r\n\n&gt; Your examples are at the extreme end of the continuum. \n&gt; Javascript is =\r\ncode run by the browser, but it=92s much closer \n&gt; to =93content=94 in many=\r\n characteristics than are applets and \n&gt; ActiveX controls.\n\nThe extreme end=\r\ns are exactly what I am trying to advocate for. \n\nAnd your points are simpl=\r\ny drawing rationalizing distinctions rather than\nrecognize the distinction =\r\nI was making regarding those thing people can\nretrieve and view with a brow=\r\nser and those things that require other tools\nand/or are hidden and require=\r\n programming skill to utilize during the\nbrowsing experience (i.e. Javascri=\r\npt)\n\n&gt; Note that I consider XMLHttpRequest an interim solution only. \n&gt; I=\r\n=92m not saying it=92s the way things should work; however I \n&gt; *am* saying=\r\n that you can use to make these things *work* in \n&gt; the here and now.\n\nYou =\r\ncan. I can.  MOST people CANNOT.\n\n&gt; Running code trumps theoretical purity.=\r\n\n\nAnd how does that related to what we are discussing?\n\n&gt; I think you are l=\r\nooking at it from the wrong angle, but \n&gt; Atompub is new and I guess it=92s=\r\n understandable that people \n&gt; have trouble imagining how their instincts w=\r\nould be changed \n&gt; by a world in which it was already ubiquitous.\n\nI am gen=\r\nerally the one who tries to understand why others don&#39;t have the\nvision, so=\r\n it is hard for me to take that comment without feeling a tad\ndefensive.\n\nT=\r\nhere are two reasons to mention here why I think HTML is important; 1.)\nJak=\r\nobs Law [1] and 2.) The &quot;view source effect.&quot;  People are much more apt\nto =\r\n&quot;view source&quot; and discover web services on HTML pages they happen to be\nsur=\r\nfing than they are apt to view source on AtomPub resources that they\ndon&#39;t =\r\nhappen to be surfing.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong. There is a great chance AdamPub =\r\nwill represent the\nprofessional end of web services as you likely envision =\r\nand that for those\nwho are serious will gravitate to AtomPub in addition to=\r\n WSO-HTML. Many who\nstart with WSO-HTML would likely then grativate to Atom=\r\nPub as they gained\nsuccess.  But in my world view WSO-HTML empowers everyma=\r\nn to create web\nservices, at least read-only web services.\n\n&gt; Here=92s the =\r\npoint (again): Atompub is infrastructure.\n\nFine. So is HTML.  One should no=\r\nt obviate the other.\n\n&gt; Think for a moment about a world in which plenty of=\r\n \n&gt; ready-made implementations exist as pluggable libraries or \n&gt; framework=\r\ns, or maybe even fullblown servers on the scale of \n&gt; Apache. (OK, the latt=\r\ner is less likely.) In this world, no \n&gt; one would think of the task as =93=\r\nwriting an Atompub \n&gt; implementation alongside the HTML interface.=94 You w=\r\nould use \n&gt; an Atompub imlpementation to build the plumbing of your \n&gt; appl=\r\nication, and then write the HTML interface as a client \n&gt; application on to=\r\np of the Atompub service. The Atompub \n&gt; service just falls out of that for=\r\n free.\n\nAre you saying that people would build AtomPub-based websites and t=\r\nhen apply\nan HTML layer?   While I agree that this might be likely in large=\r\nr\nenterprises or serious web business I highly doubt we&#39;ll ever see the 80%=\r\n of\nthe bottom of the pyramid doing that because to them it is an unnecessa=\r\nry\nlevel of indirection.  And that 80% is the part of the pyramid that\ninte=\r\nrests me most.\n\n&gt; The role in which I see Atompub is retrofitting HTTP with=\r\n a \n&gt; notion of collections. In so doing it sets up expectations \n&gt; for cli=\r\nents about how the mechanics of creating resources on \n&gt; the server will wo=\r\nrk.\n\nOkay, I&#39;ll buy that. One of the big problems with VBScript on ASP was =\r\nits\nlack of usable collections.\n\n&gt; The only means for changing state on the=\r\n server with a \n&gt; browser is HTML forms and POST. But these forms and POST =\r\n\n&gt; requests are mute and featureless; the browser has no idea \n&gt; whatsoever=\r\n about the meaning of what it=92s doing. You need a \n&gt; human to drive it.\n\n=\r\nAccepted.\n\n&gt; With Atompub, the client is no longer just putting forth its \n=\r\n&gt; fist with eyes shut tight, murmuring =93here=92s some data, I \n&gt; don=92t =\r\nknow what you want it for.=94 It can actually have an \n&gt; intent for that da=\r\nta and a notion of what is going to happen with it.\n\nOkay, but can you give=\r\n me specific examples?  &quot;Show me the code!&quot; :)\n\n&gt; Consider Amazon S3; it=92=\r\ns such a simple service that if it had \n&gt; happened 5 years later the docume=\r\nntation would consist of \n&gt; =93see RFC &lt;whatever Atompub will be assigned&gt;=\r\n=94 and no one \n&gt; would be writing custom clients for it.\n\nMy initiatve [2]=\r\n with Alan Dean (that I haven&#39;t had time for in quite a\nwhile but do plan t=\r\no return to) has a goal of minimizing custom clients.\n\n&gt; But that only scra=\r\ntches the surface. Think about how \n&gt; ubiquitous the notion of collections =\r\nis. To quote Bill de=A0h=D3ra:\n&gt; \n&gt;     &lt;http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007=\r\n/07/shipping_notes.html&gt;:\n&gt;     AtomPub sits in a very strange place, as it=\r\n has the potential\n&gt;     to disrupt half a dozen or more industry sectors, =\r\nsuch as,\n&gt;     Enterprise Content Management, Blogging, Digital/Desktop\n&gt;  =\r\n   Publishing and Archiving, Mobile Web, EAI/WS-* messaging,\n&gt;     Social N=\r\networks, Online Productivity tools. As interesting as\n&gt;     the adoption ra=\r\ntes, will be people and sectors finding\n&gt;     reasons not use it to protect=\r\n distribution channels and data\n&gt;     lockins with more complicated solutio=\r\nns. Any kind of data\n&gt;     garden is fair game for AtomPub to rationalize.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; This is much, much bigger than publishing systems.\n\nOkay.  That said, =\r\nwhat&#39;s wrong with applying the notice of collections to\nsemantic HTML?\n\n-- =\r\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedu=\r\nrls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n[1] http://www.welld=\r\nesignedurls.org\n[2] http://simplewebservices.org\n\n\n"}}
