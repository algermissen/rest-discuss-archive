I\n&gt; thought it might be useful for people new to REST (like me) to have  \n&gt; some\n&gt; concrete examples to look at for ideas about the &quot;right&quot; way to do\n&gt; things.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m most interested in the use of hypermedia to drive program-to- \n&gt; program\n&gt; interactions (as opposed to human-to-program, like a website).\n&gt;\n&gt; What are examples of hypermedia technologies that you&#39;ve used\n&gt; successfully or that you&#39;ve seen used successfully?  Some of the\n&gt; commonly cited examples I&#39;ve seen are:\n&gt;\n&gt;     * Atom and APP\n&gt;     * OpenSearch\n&gt;     * XML with custom XML Schema\n&gt;     * XForms\n&gt;     * XLink\n&gt;     * HTML microformats\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Have you had success with any of these?  Are there some there that you\n&gt; don&#39;t think should be there?  Others that are missing?\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, what are the existing, publicly available applications or\n&gt; frameworks currently in use that you feel are examples of really good\n&gt; RESTful design, especially in terms of their use of hypermedia to  \n&gt; drive\n&gt; application state?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; scott\n\n\n"}}
