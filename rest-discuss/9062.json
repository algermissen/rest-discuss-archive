Curse you, Chip Rosenthal!)\n\nAnd this is hopefully me replying on-list as intended this time. Sorry \nabout the earlier error.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Digest?\n&gt; \n&gt; Um... I looked at it, and I can&#39;t remember now why it wouldn&#39;t work\n&gt; down at the dumb browser (and dumb web server, as I just re-emphasized\n&gt; in my previous post) level.\n\nWhat browser doesn&#39;t support Digest?\n\nI know that dealing with this can be tricky with some small-budget \nhosts, but not all.\n\n&gt; What Would Lynx Do?\n\nSupport it out of the box. Best support around last time I looked (all \nthe others have a design flaw in not having a log-out button, though I \nthink there&#39;s a firefox extension that does that).\n\n&gt; Really?  It&#39;s a database-intensive app already, so in a high-usage\n&gt; situation you&#39;d already be dealing with multiple servers, and the\n&gt; session database would be pretty trivial in comparison to other stuff.\n\nIt means that you have n resources multiplied by m sessions to create \nn*m resources with an n*m management task.\n\nSince sessions are generally not something you can reuse safely m is \ninfinite.\n\n&gt; 99% of the time, auth wouldn&#39;t be required so the server would be\n&gt; ignoring the cookies and not making the lookup.\n\nStop the cookies actually being sent at all in these cases and we can \nmake that part scale.\n\n&gt; Plus, Javascript would\n&gt; hijack the non-dumb browser and go to a properly-RESTful authen mode,\n&gt; so it&#39;s only going to be happening for the small percentage of people\n&gt; without JS.\n\nWith my current pet project I&#39;m currently split on whether I do this or \nnot. The only advantage in doing this is that some people don&#39;t like the \npop-ups browsers use for auth - so if I decide to use js to push past \nthat I might do the above.\n\nThen again I personally do like the pop-ups, since they tend to be more \nsecure than cookie-based sessions (if Digest rather than Basic).\n\n&gt;&gt; Security with these schemes is at best dependant upon you getting every\n&gt;&gt; right (assuming yet another problem with cookie security isn&#39;t found).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, it worries me a bit. I wish I knew either a lot more, or a lot\n&gt; less about security.\n\nYou *really* can&#39;t code securely if you don&#39;t get the security issues at \nhand very well. Time for some research.\n\n&gt; I think of it as a kludge, like overloaded POST, not to be used unless\n&gt; there&#39;s nothing better. (And I started this thread because I really\n&gt; want to be *sure* there&#39;s nothing better.)\n\nThere&#39;s plenty better, but I use sessions all the time when I need stuff \ndone quickly because in many cases I can use the &quot;Session object&quot; in a \ngiven tool kit and do in 5 minutes what takes a large amount of code to do.\n\nI plan to build myself the tools that&#39;ll give me that same \n5-minute-to-working-code advantage with other methods though. If I ever \ndo get it done I&#39;ll release it.\n\n&gt; (Seriously? I&#39;m not serious. Other than a lot of the functionality of\n&gt; the app will also be accessible by email, and probably some of the\n&gt; decisions on how *that* works will be influenced by the architecture\n&gt; of the web side of it.)\n\nI think I would probably think of that in a very separate way. Can&#39;t say \nmore without knowing more; and even then maybe a whiteboard, some good \ncoffee and regular smoke-breaks would also help.\n\n\n"}}
