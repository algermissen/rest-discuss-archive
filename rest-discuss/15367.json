We&#39;re currently in the very early stages of planning for new\n&gt;&gt; apis for supporting pure REST and HTTP style development. Our goal is to\n&gt;&gt; create something simple, lightweight and true to form. We are looking\n&gt;&gt; provide a natural API both for the service author and for the consumer.\n&gt;&gt; This not an attempt to simply retrofit onto a SOAP based model.\n&gt;\n&gt; Great to hear that!\n&gt;\n&gt; As you might guess I have quite some thoughts on this :-) Are you thinking\n&gt; about the server- or the client side or both?\n&gt;\n&gt; On the server side, I think that the JAX-RS community has done a pretty good\n&gt; job as far as RESTfulness, clarity, and coding efficiency goes so you might\n&gt; want to look at what they did and adapt the approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It would be great to hear thoughts you guys have on what would be the\n&gt;&gt; ideal developer experience for using REST. Also if you&#39;d like to be\n&gt;&gt; involved we&#39;d welcome the feedback.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards\n&gt;&gt; Glenn\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt;\n&gt;  Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nSent from my mobile device\n\n"}}
