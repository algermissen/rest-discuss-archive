In fact, say\n &gt; Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Lynda Hardman and Lloyd Rutledge, the\n &gt; primary model for many hypermedia systems is directly applicable to\n &gt; the Semantic Web. Hypermedia systems are, basically, structured\n &gt; databases (in various media -- audio, video, etc.) with pieces of\n &gt; information (called nodes) and links to related pieces of\n &gt; information.  These systems typically denote link access points or\n &gt; link &quot;anchors&quot; in some manner within a node when it&#39;s displayed on a\n &gt; computer screen, such as underlined text displayed within documents\n &gt; on the Web. In order to annotate a specific portion of a Web\n &gt; resource, it needs an anchoring mechanism, and to establish a\n &gt; relationship between the annotation and the target resource, a\n &gt; linking model is necessary. Such elements will be paramount in the\n &gt; development of the Semantic Web, say the researchers.
