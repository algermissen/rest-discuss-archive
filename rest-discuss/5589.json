For\nthe query part the specification gives no indication about the\nrelati=\r\nonship between the multiple parameters. What could happen if we\nremove one =\r\nparameter? OTOH, a user has clearer expectations when\nremoving the trailing=\r\n part of a hierarchical path.\n\nIn addition, if you use extensions like All-=\r\nIn-One or GoUp in Firefox,\nyou can automatically remove subparts of a hiera=\r\nrchical path and\nsubmit the reduced URI to the server. If find myself using=\r\n this\nfeature very frequently.\n\nIn conclusion, my preference goes to hierar=\r\nchical URIs when there is a\nnatural hierarchical ordering between the URI p=\r\narts/parameters and\nwhen users can deduce meaningful relative URIs. Query p=\r\naths are very\nuseful for web forms and URIs where all the parameters can&#39;t =\r\nbe\ncleanly classified in a hierarchy.\n\nJerome Louvel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
