HTTP Extensions for Resource \nMetadata (HERM) [1] looks to be a good solution.  It\ncalls for the use of a pair of headers, Meta-Location\nand Meta-About.\n\nWe&#39;ve been considering some potential refinements. I\nfelt that the OPTIONS method would be the natural place\nto return the Meta-Location in the general case, which\nis similar to the use of the Allow header.  It&#39;s unclear\nthough if this is stretching the semantics of OPTIONS \ntoo far.  I&#39;d like to know if it is.\n\nRoy Fielding had mentioned in a posting to \nthis list that adding an extra header to each GET is not\noptimal [2], but that might be the easiest road to \nadoption.\n\nOther interesting ideas have been floated on the HERM \nassociated discussion list [3].\n\n\n\nThis topic is essentially one aspect of the TAG issue \n&quot;metadataInURI-31&quot; [4] specifically with regards to \nthis comment:\n\n    &quot;... and more importantly there should be a &quot;clean&quot;, \n    uniform way to refer to (and thus access) the metadata \n    of web resources...&quot;\n\nAnother potential issue brought up by Berners-Lee in \na recent posting [5] to www-tag concerns a similar issue: how\ncan site level &quot;metadata&quot; such as /favicons, p3p statements\netc., be bound to a site in a standard way.  It would seem \nthat the solution to the first issue could form the basis \nof the solution to the second issue.\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n[1] http://www.xfront.com/dist-reg/distributed-registry.html\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3315\n[3] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/distributed-registry/\n[4] http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#metadataInURI-31 \n[5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Feb/0093.html\n\n\n"}}
