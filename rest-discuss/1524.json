I espcially liked the www.my-home.org examples as an application\nwhere action verbs are a much more natural way of modeling the system.\n\nRegarding the parts-depot purchase example, I think having a URL that would\nmodel the &quot;add-to-cart&quot; action is fine.  You can simply make it a POST to\npreserve the no-side-effect condition for GET (maybe GET of that URL will\nreturn the part availability?).  In fact, a POST could provide an added\nopportunity to ask for additional authentication.\n\nI think having the action return a set of URLs that provides follow-on\nactions would be even more interesting.  For example, you could have the\nadd-to-cart action return URLs that allows you to remove from cart or go to\ncheckout.\n\nImplementing a client-side shopping cart is certainly reasonable, but\nwebsite have server-side shopping carts because they want to track customers\nas they actually add things to the carts even if they don&#39;t buy.  It allows\nthem to remind the shopper and also gather more customer behavior info.\n\nAgain, your pragmatic examples are very useful illustrations of the issues.\n\nThanks!\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
