I don&#39;t care what is inside the node of a\ngraph is not my concern... a node is a resource, at some instance what\nit will return is not my concern, as it will _always_ return the\nrepresentation of the resource.\n\n\n&gt; Finally, in the runtime resource graph, we can say that, resource with\n&gt; URI &quot;http://g/search?q=foo&quot; and resource with URI\n&gt; &quot;http://g/search?q=bar&quot; are two distinct resources (or objects). They\n&gt; are similar, simply because they are instantiated from the same class,\n&gt; i.e. &quot;http://g/search?q={searchTerms}&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nI thought so too. But in most cases , if you try to show a web\napplication by something akin to this there could be problems. say\npage A has a search form. If every possible query is a new node then\nthere could be a infinite possible edges from A to other nodes, all of\nwhich are essentially the same except for a parameter (which changes\nthe resource they represent , no doubt! ).\n\nI sometimes think that it is a single node, which by some magic will\nalways return what the user wants (i.e the params of the GET aren&#39;t a\nconcern of the graph). It is a simple abstraction that could work .\nBut many a times, in places where people are not comfortable with\nmod_rewrite , ? is used instead of URIs. For e.g in most forum\nsoftware , a thread is of the form :\n&lt;home&gt;/subforum/thread-title-threadid\nbut if mod_rewrite didn&#39;t work it would be :\n&lt;home&gt;/thread.php?sf=subforum&tt=thread-title&tid=threadid\n\n\nRegards,\nDevdatta\n\n"}}
