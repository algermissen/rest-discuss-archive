I&#39;ve already scoured\nthe wiki and the white papers but don&#39;t see any specific advice for my\nsituation.\n\nThe webapp is framed (not necessarily my choice, but it&#39;s also not\nnecessarily a bad choice for it either). The left frame contains an\nexplorer-type folder tree containing essentially the names of columns in a\ndatabase table. The right frame is a content pane. When the user selects a\ncolumn from the tree, the column&#39;s values should be added to a table in the\ncontent frame. Selecting another column from the tree adds more columns to\nthe table.\n\nQuestion is, how do I make all of this happen in a RESTful fashion? Is it,\nin fact, even possible given our design constraints? The links in the tree\nare going to have to be of the form:\n\nGET /viewer?column=foo\n\non the server-side, when processing such a request, we add the requested\ncolumn to a session variable and render the new table. But the URL for the\ntable frame is going to be incorrect after a couple such requests. If the\nuser were to bookmark the URL and revisit it later, they would get a table\nwith only the last column that was added. Clearly, that&#39;s not RESTful.\n\nI was idly wondering, would it be RESTful if the server-side piece that\nadds the requested column to the session variable were to redirect the\nbrowser to a URL for the table that was, well, unique? e.g.\n\n/viewer?column=foo&column=bar&column=bat\n\nAlternately, would it be RESTful if the server-side piece were to create a\nnamed resource which stores the state of the table and return a URL to that\nresource? e.g.\n\n/viewer?table=23\n\nOr is there another, better possibility that would make for a cleaner, more\nRESTful urlspace?\n\n- donald\n\n\n\n"}}
