Let&#39;s say I wan=\r\nt to write &quot;vacation.jpg&quot;, a few properties, and also store an associated b=\r\nlob of EXIF metadata.  My current hacky implementation works like this (URI=\r\ns truncated for brevity):\n\nPOST vacation.jpg?title=3DMy%20Vacation\nContent-=\r\ntype: multipart/form-data\n\n---\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=3D&quot;docu=\r\nment&quot;\nContent-type: image/jpg\n...\n---\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\r\n=3D&quot;exif&quot;\nContent-type: application/x-exif\n\n...\n\n---\n...\n201 Created\nConten=\r\nt-location: vacation.jpg\nContent-type: application/json\n{\n  &quot;document&quot; : &quot;v=\r\nacation.jpg&quot;,\n  &quot;*&quot; : &quot;vacation.jpg?content=3D*&quot;,  // results in a multipar=\r\nt as posted\n  &quot;basic&quot; : &quot;vacation.jpg?content=3Dbasic&quot;,  // the urlencoded =\r\nquery\n  &quot;exif&quot; : &quot;vacation.jpg?content=3Dexif&quot;  // returns just the exif\n}\n=\r\n\nEach of these metadata URIs supports standard PUT/GET/DELETE.  (Side note;=\r\n I don&#39;t love my returned entity, as the &quot;content=3D&quot; implementation actual=\r\nly supports arbitrary requesting combinations of multiple metadata entities=\r\n.)\n\nIn any case, it all works fine, but my inclination is that I should rea=\r\nlly provide this via PUT.  As it stands, though &quot;GET vacation.jpg&quot; just ret=\r\nurns the main image/jpg document (without metadata).  This would appear to =\r\nviolate rfc2616 section 9.6, which suggests that GET should return the same=\r\n entity that was PUT, i.e. the multipart document.\n\nSolving is possible, bu=\r\nt ugly.  I can change the PUT uri to:\n\nPUT vacation.jpg?content=3D*\n\nwhich =\r\nwould have the property that the exact same URL can be used for a GET and i=\r\nt would indeed result in the original multipart entity, and I&#39;d rely on the=\r\n clause that says &quot;a PUT request on a general URI might result in several o=\r\nther URIs being defined by the origin server&quot;, one of which would be the ma=\r\nin resource, &quot;vacation.jpg&quot;.  \n\nUnfortunately, discovering the &quot;vacation.jp=\r\ng&quot; URI would be out of band with the protocol headers (I wish there were a =\r\nway to return content headers for each of the multipart entities sent!) and=\r\n would have to be in the entity returned, as above.  So now GET looks user-=\r\nfriendly, but PUT is ugly.  \n\nIt looks weird and I can see this working, bu=\r\nt although I&#39;m\nfundamentally doing a PUT, I feel that I may be stretching t=\r\nhings a bit with the multipart entities, and maybe I should stick with POST=\r\n after all given the current spec(s).\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n\n"}}
