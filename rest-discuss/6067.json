Certainly the \n&gt;&gt; session ID is in the request.  The state of the session is not.  But the \n&gt;&gt; state of the resource isn&#39;t in the request either.  So I don&#39;t see your \n&gt;&gt; distinction.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; But when you get back the resource you don&#39;t get back the entire state\n&gt; of the session.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if we&#39;re talking session-less then you make an HTTP request for a\n&gt; resource and you get back exactly the representation of the resource\n&gt; you asked for.\n&gt;   \nBut you&#39;re not getting back /the entire state of the resource/.  Just a \nrepresentation of that resource.\n\nIf I use a session ID, then implicitly that session ID is part of the \nresource I&#39;m requesting, not a separate thing.\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been trying to convince you. I don&#39;t like advocacy. I have\n&gt; been trying to explain the benefits of REST, particularly cachability.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This point is probably the heart of this argument. Most RESTafrians I\n&gt; know see REST as an architecture that has clear wins and losses. It&#39;s\n&gt; not a religion to me or most of the others I know. \n&gt;   \nSo what you&#39;re saying is that if my application requires sessions, I&#39;m \nout of luck with REST.  Does that leave me back at SOAP, or can I get \nsome of the REST benefits while still having sessions?\n&gt; One big win is the scalability achieved through cachability. One big\n&gt; loss is that session less apps seem harder to grasp; probably because\n&gt; programming in the small (like my earlier JSP example) is so easy to\n&gt; do.\n&gt;   \nI certainly appreciate there are many wonderful sessionless apps that \ncan be created.  But suppose I already know the requirements of my app, \nand that includes sessions.  Are you saying there is always some way to \ndo the same thing with a sessionless app?  Or are you saying I should \nabandon REST if I need sessions?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
