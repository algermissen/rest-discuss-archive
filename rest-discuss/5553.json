It&#39;s sort of a quantum leap in complexity, to=\r\n store off these\n&gt; &gt; temporary resources and age them out properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm=\r\n, to be clear, I was responding specifically to notion &quot;presumably I\n&gt; woul=\r\nd then have to do an operation to remove the portfolio once I have a\n&gt; resu=\r\nlt, sort of a very primitive garbage collection operation&quot;, which I\n&gt; don&#39;t=\r\n think *must* be true: the server can manage its own resources.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t =\r\nconsider it to be the &quot;quantum leap&quot; of complexity to age out\n&gt; transient r=\r\nesources, but the systems I&#39;ve been working in recently have\n&gt; made such th=\r\nings relatively easy.\n&gt;\n\nWell to me it&#39;s a quantum leap because I have to c=\r\nreate a whole new\nsubsystem that I didn&#39;t need before,  to manage the lifec=\r\nycle of those\ntransient documents. It&#39;s not all that hard in principle, but=\r\n it&#39;s a\ndiscrete subsystem I can do without.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It is a bigger jump from =\r\njust using POST to do the analysis to doing a\n&gt; portfolio-POST + analysis-G=\r\nET, but I don&#39;t know why you dismiss it as\n&gt; &quot;[just] conformance to some pa=\r\nttern&quot; ... all architectures and designs\n&gt; are conformance to a set of patt=\r\nerns.  It&#39;s not blind conformance, but\n&gt; instead principled, done to achiev=\r\ne the advantages that the patterns\n&gt; enable and knowing the disadvantages c=\r\noncomitantly imposed.\n&gt;\n\n&quot;the advantages the patterns enable&quot;: In this part=\r\nicular case I could\nnot identify a single advantage.\n\n\n&gt; If you&#39;re trying t=\r\no operate under a strict interpretation of the HTTP\n&gt; operations -- as Jame=\r\ns&#39; original post (heh :) indicated -- then I think\n&gt; you must exclude the &quot;=\r\nprocess-this&quot; meaning of POST.\n\nProcess-this is broad enough to encompass e=\r\nxecuting a query, isn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt; Also under that\n&gt; interpretation, I don&#39;t se=\r\ne how one would get an analysis by anything\n&gt; other than GET.  In an ideal =\r\nworld there&#39;s nothing preventing the entire\n&gt; portfolio from being expresse=\r\nd in the GET, but there are practical\n&gt; issues with that (RFC2616 definitio=\r\nn of GET, client software&#39;s\n&gt; URL-length handling, &c.).  An alternative, t=\r\nhen, is to have the\n&gt; analysis-GET further identify a just-POSTed portfolio=\r\n resource.  Another\n&gt; alternative would be to POST a new analysis resource =\r\ncontaining the\n&gt; portfolio data, then GET that new analysis.  I&#39;d consider =\r\nthose\n&gt; alternatives listed in terms of their &quot;bestness&quot; according to my\n&gt; =\r\nworld-view, but &quot;best&quot; is always subjective, especially on open-ended\n&gt; pro=\r\nblems.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, there are potentially practical benefits of the mor=\r\ne\n&gt; &quot;complex&quot; versions, mostly around cache control of both the portfolio\n&gt;=\r\n and analysis resources.  W.r.t. fundamentals, a portfolio that is a\n&gt; prop=\r\ner resource can be properly cached, conditionally retrieved, or\n&gt; itself be=\r\n the output of some other process, &c.  W.r.t reusability, the\n&gt; portfolio =\r\nresources are not tightly bound to the analysis, and can then\n&gt; be used in =\r\nother contexts.  W.r.t. evolvability, the facilities for both\n&gt; creating an=\r\nd consuming portfolios can change independently of the\n&gt; analysis operation=\r\n, and vice-versa ... as well, the portfolio-related\n&gt; resources are then fu=\r\nll resources in their own right, and can be moved,\n&gt; proxied, cached, &c.  =\r\nAgain, a less open-ended question might preclude\n&gt; some of (the viability o=\r\nf) those possibilities.\n\n\nAgreed, if James wants cacheability, 303 is the w=\r\nay to go. And I guess\nto fully repro the functionality of GET, the response=\r\n would (or could)\nbe cacheable. So yes, if James would have intended the GE=\r\nT to be\ncacheable, then he should return 303 from a POST and manage the tem=\r\np\nresource.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, James&#39; primary concern might be implementation =\r\nsimplicity,\n&gt; which is probably going to trump all those things.\n&gt;\n\n:) Simp=\r\nlicity is good!\n\n\n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; --\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - `a=3Djsled; =\r\nb=3Dasynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
