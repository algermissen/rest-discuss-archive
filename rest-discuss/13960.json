Each identifier corresponds to a\nunique semantic and mapping over time.\n\n&gt; But in hindsight, what&#39;s the difference between\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /resource.xml\n&gt; GET /resource.json\n&gt;\n&gt; and\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /resource\n&gt; Accept: application/xml\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /resource\n&gt; Accept: application/json\n&gt;\n&gt; Semantically, the queries can be identical. Logically, one would\n&gt; ASSUME they&#39;re identical.\n\nThe former are requests on two different resources.  The latter\nare two varying requests on one resource.  The only difference,\nin my opinion, is that the single varying resource makes for a\nbetter bookmark because it is less susceptible to both\ndifferences in user agent capabilities (different accept lists)\nand changes in supported media types over time.  It is not,\nhowever, a replacement for the media-specific resources and\ntheir corresponding URIs.\n\nA better protocol would tell the client the available variants\nand how to get them, preferably in a way that doesn&#39;t impact\nlatency (trailers).  Yes, that was in HTTP/1.1&#39;s original design.\n\nThe media-specific resources are also useful for the apps\nthat don&#39;t want to negotiate, especially those performing\nremote authoring or versioning.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
