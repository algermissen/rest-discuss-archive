For example, you\n&gt; can GET a resource and receive an HTML representation of the\n&gt; resource&#39;s state along with one or more forms that &quot;describe&quot; how to\n&gt; interact with the resource you just &quot;GOT&quot; or with other\n&gt; related/subordinate resources. In short, GETting a resource tells you\n&gt; how to interact with it using other methods.\n&gt;\n\nYes. But keep in mind when you GET a HTML&lt; form from some URL, it\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily tell you how to interact with that resource -- it\ncan tell you to POST the form to some other URI. So let me rephrase\nyour statement: GETting a resource tells you how to interact with the\nweb application.\n\n&gt; If you&#39;d rather provide (or _also_ provide -- through content neg.) an\n&gt; XML representation of your resource, then you could embed xforms in\n&gt; your data. You would need an xforms processor on the client that\n&gt; allowed code to tweak form controls and submit the form through an API.\n&gt;\n&gt; So instead of publishing URIs (or URI templates) and schemas in a\n&gt; description of your resources/service you embed forms in the resource\n&gt; content.\n\nYep. No WSDL needed. Schemas for the XML documents you plan to\nexchange: you do need some shared understanding of the meanings of\nelements. But no, you don&#39;t need to declare that a certain URI accepts\nPOST of documents of a certain type. The application itself will tell\nyou what to POST.\n\n&gt;The client of the form just has a few simple controls to\n&gt; interact with. The form itself contains the logic of how to build the\n&gt; XML payload based on the control settings. When the controls are set\n&gt; to the client&#39;s liking, you submit the form. The form itself knows the\n&gt; URI it needs to GET/PUT/POST/DELETE to.\n&gt;\n\nSure. I think the UI portion of Xforms is not all that relevant,\nthough. If the form tells the client he needs to collect the Author\ndata from the user, let the client do it however it likes.\n\n&gt; Note that this mechanism would supplement, not replace, simple links\n&gt; embedded in the content... there&#39;s no reason to do anything different\n&gt; there.\n&gt;\n&gt; You get the simplicity and resilience of the &quot;human focused&quot; HTML web\n&gt; brought to the &quot;machine focused&quot; XML web. All you need is an xforms\n&gt; processor that can be driven via an API... know of any? ;-)\n&gt;\n\nThere is FormsPlayer of course, but I would just use a SAX parser to\nparse the Xform model and construct the filled in XML document.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
