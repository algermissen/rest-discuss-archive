There is no facility for re-sending a status\n    code from an asynchronous operation such as this.\n\n    The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose\n    is to allow a server to accept a request for some other\n    process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run\n    once per day) without requiring that the user agent&#39;s\n    connection to the server persist until the process is\n    completed. The entity returned with this response SHOULD\n    include an indication of the request&#39;s current status and\n    either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when\n    the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
