My question is what&#39;s appropriate/acceptable to\n&gt; put there? Could it be just a URI template and then the client would\n&gt; use that template to go directly to the resources it&#39;s looking for?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what my current situation is. My client application application\n&gt; manipulates &quot;content records&quot; that it identifies by a URN that takes\n&gt; the form of: &quot;mgid:[foo]:[bar]:[baz]:[id]&quot;. To the client, this isn&#39;t\n&gt; just an opaque string. It understands the concept of foos, bars, etc.\n&gt; and can extract them from the URN. (FWIW, these are design decisions\n&gt; that were made long ago and I have no control over.) Would it be\n&gt; appropriate for me to put something like this as the starting point\n&gt; for all clients?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://service.mysite.com/v{version}/mgid/{foo}/{bar}/{baz}/{id}\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then whenever the client accesses the service, it does a GET on\n&gt; http://service.mysite.com/ , parses the URI template, and carries on.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that sound reasonable? I gotten suggestions from some people (who\n&gt; don&#39;t know REST well at all) to POST the URN and respond with the\n&gt; correct URI or redirect to it. This, I&#39;m pretty sure, is a really bad\n&gt; idea.\n\nLetting the server resolve the URN into a URL would make it easier to\nchange the server and add new functionality without breaking clients,\nso you should look into it.  You can also do that with a GET, possibly\nreturning 303 (See Other) with the new URL.\n\nReturning a URL template that the client then populates doesn&#39;t sound\nmuch different from returning a form that the client populates, URL\ntemplates is just another mechanism and one we&#39;re seeing growing\nsupport for in client libraries.\n\nI think the risk here is with developers grabbing the template once,\nand then hard coding it into their client libraries, making it hard to\nchange the service afterwards (same problem we&#39;re seeing with\nWSDL/WADL), so I would recommend having the server resolve the URN\ninto a URL.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Michael\n\n"}}
