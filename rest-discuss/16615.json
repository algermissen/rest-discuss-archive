Or should the Accept and\n&gt; default be ignored when there is not content returned? \n\nDELETE...\n    A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an\n    representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action\n    has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been\n    enacted but the response does not include a representation\n\n204\n    The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always\n    terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.\n\nno message-body = no Content-Type header\n\nalso note:\n    The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the\n    inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in\n    the request&#39;s header fields, even if the request method does not\n    define any use for a message-body.  This allows the request message\n    framing algorithm to be independent of method semantics.\n\nSo you&#39;ll want to be avoiding a Content-Length on that 204 as well.\n\nRegards,\n\nNathan\n\n\n"}}
