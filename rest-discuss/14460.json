Transactions over HTTP should be optional,\n&gt; discoverable, negotiable, based on optimistic commits, and (in the\n&gt; case of failures) use compenstating requests as a way to reverse\n&gt; previous work.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; and\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; What is described here is a transaction service interface (TSI) that\n&gt; clients and servers can choose to implement in ways all parties can\n&gt; agree upon. This is the way media-types are currenly handled and TSIs\n&gt; could be defined, documented, and registered in much the same way.\n&gt; This includes the possibility of registering a media-type that matches\n&gt; the TSI implementation. True to the archetictural style of the HTTP\n&gt; protocol, this approach proposes a &quot;uniform interface&quot; for handling\n&gt; units of work over HTTP.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n\n\n"}}
