Nothing prevents you from returning the view\n&gt; of what you just created in the body, or to return a body with\n&gt; a meta refresh directing to the proper location, or simply let\n&gt; the user know with a message &quot; Whatever you did created\n&gt; something over there, click to have a look&quot;.\n\nThat’s not a solution, it’s a bad workaround. If a user fills in\na New Thread page on a web forum and then sends me a POST, and I\ncreate a new thread, I want to send the user to the thread they\njust created, and the user *expects* me to do that. Forcing an\nextra click on the user is pointless.\n\nCurrently what I do is sniff the user agent to see if I should\nsend 303 (it’s a browser) or 201 (it’s some kind of programmatic\nclient). Terribly ugly, but if empty 201 with Location isn’t\ntreated as a redirect, well I guess I will just have to continue\ndoing it this way. I was hoping to be able to throw this wart out\nof my code someday.\n\n&gt; Just like 300 shouldn&#39;t redirect, neither should 201, because\n&gt; http means several things could be created.\n\nThat’s why I said only 201 responses with an *empty* body should\nbe treated like redirects. If I return such a response, what\nbrowser behaviour is useful? Showing the user a blank page?\nThrowing up a dialog box? Both of those seem like unhelpfully\nliteralistic interpretations of the RFC 2616 text to me. The\nmeaning of such a response seems pretty obvious and umabiguous\nto me.\n\nDo you have any substantive objections against treating 201 as\na redirect *if and only if* the entity body is empty *and* it\ncontains a Location header?\n\n&gt; Although maybe we need a new response for a 201 with a 303\n&gt; functionality in case of unique creation result.\n\nThat would work for me. I’m just not convinced it’s necessary,\nnor am I convinced of the harm in special-casing empty 201 with\nLocation. And it seems to me that the latter has much better\nchances to be supported in the forseeable future than the former.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
