REST  \nis an architectural style that specifically addresses problems in the  \nspace of networked and large scale software systems. If you look at  \nthe common OO patterns (e.g. DataAccessor, Facade, Proxy,  \nDomainModel,...) for this problem space, you are pretty close to  \nREST. (I am very surprised that appearently so many well-trained  \npattern heads miss this astonishingly close relationship).\n\nSee http://www.jalgermissen.com/blog/fowler_a_restafarian.html as an  \nexample.\n\n&gt; For all these years,\n&gt; we have been educated to use cookie and server session management in\n&gt; most of cookbooks and tutorials. Yet many code libraries are built\n&gt; based on such habits.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think a good way to answer questions, is to build a simple web app\n&gt; based on what we understand about REST, and incrementally learn from\n&gt; the experience.\n\nI think it is important to understand what problem space REST is  \naiming at. If you start by looking at evolvability issues (what  \narchitectural properties must my system have to enable the components  \nto evolve independently from each other (that way minimizing the  \nimpact of (inevitable) change?), then a lot of the concepts of REST  \nbecome much easier to grasp. Do not ask: how do RESTful interfaces  \nlook like, but instead ask: How can I minimize the assumptions any  \ngiven software component makes about the others? How exactly does  \nevolvability improve? Then go back and look at non-REST styles and  \nanalyse the evolvability issues again.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; Try to build a toy first to figure out where&#39;s the\n&gt; real problem that bother you, it helps. :-)\n&gt;\n\n&gt; If REST has been published a decade ago, I&#39;m sure today we will have\n&gt; enough frameworks, tutorials and examples to answer all the questions.\n&gt; But hey, for this moment, those are the things we have to build up for\n&gt; ppl in the coming decade. ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/17/05, Jan Algermissen &lt;jalgermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Dec 17, 2005, at 6:01 AM, Lyle Kopnicky wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Where do I put the &quot;I forgot my password&quot; button?
