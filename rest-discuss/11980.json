(Please note that the web service is only an auxiliary\nfunction of the application, web services are not our core business.)\n\nOur prototype service model is intentionally simplistic: we have\n&quot;nodes&quot; and &quot;users&quot; in a one-to-many containment relationship.\nAll is fine creating, requesting and updating them, deleting &quot;users&quot;\nis also fine.\nBefore deleting a &quot;node&quot; however, the normal usage pattern would be\nmigrating all its &quot;users&quot; to another &quot;node&quot;.\nI am having trouble adding this single &quot;RPC-ish&quot; operation to our\notherwise RESTful service efficiently.\nThe clean solution would be the client listing, and migrating all\n&quot;users&quot; of the &quot;node&quot;.\nThis is however neither efficient, nor atomic.\nThe quick and dirty solution would be passing the fallback &quot;node&quot; as\nan argument of the DELETE operation, but that breaks many principles\nand benefits of REST.\n\nI am pretty sure similar architecturally unstylish situations will\narise in all our services, just like databases have stored procedures,\nnot just SQL.\n\nSurely I am not the first with such an issue. Could the kind members\nof this fine discussion group share their opinions on this, and/or\npoint me towards relevant literature?\n\n\nThank you in advance:\n\nGabor Szokoli\n\n"}}
