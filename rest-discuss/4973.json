Someone mentioned the client from Ronald\nTschalï¿½r http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ which is also pretty\ngood. I switched to use the Apache Commons http-client but not for any\nparticular reason. Ronald&#39;s stuff is usually very good - I used his\nJavaScript engine many years ago (& referenced it in a defunct Apache XML\nproject called Xang).\n\n"}}
