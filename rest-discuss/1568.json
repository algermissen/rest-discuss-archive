If the URI \n&gt; http://example.org/world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99 points to Seth \n&gt; (The Mighty), then I might PUT myself there, therefor updating my state:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99 HTTP/1.0\n&gt; Content-Type: application/rpg-character+xml\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;character&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;!-- what is Seth doing now?  could be walking, talking, etc --&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;performing&gt;\n&gt;        &lt;attack using=&quot;sword&quot;&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;against xlink:href=&quot;http://world-o-hacks/region27/ogre/33553&quot;\n&gt;                    xmlns:xlink=&quot;whatever-it-is&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;        &lt;/attack&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/performing&gt;\n&gt; /character\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s nice about that is the server can send back a representation of \n&gt; both my character AND the ogre.  I would look into the representation of \n&gt; the ogre to see if damage had been done, if it is fleeing, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s all about state transfer.  Kinda cool.\n\nExcellent example!  This is certainly a good way to write a RPG application\nin REST.  However, I think we can enhance this system by judiciously adding\naction oriented verb URIs.\n\nLet say Seth the Mighty wants to &quot;mental blast&quot; all ogres within 1/2 mile.\nWe can create an order for each ogre in the 1/2 mile radius, or we can\ncreate a temporary Ogre container that represents all ogres in 1/2 mile and\nsend the order to that container.  Both seems like a bit of work.\n\nBut, if the game hoster provided a URI for Seth the Mighty that allows:\n\n \nhttp://example.org/world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99/mental-blast?radius=.5\n\nThis would be pretty convenient.  The returned results could still be\nindividual states of all the ogres in the 1/2 mile radius (as well as the\ncurrent state of Seth).  Of course, you can also create a &quot;noun&quot; URI for\nSeth&#39;s mental blast capability:\n\n \nhttp://example.org/world-o-hacks/region27/combatant99/mental-blast-capabilit\ny\n\nAnd then create an order with the radius property set to .5 miles and POST\nthat order to the mental-blast-capability.  But, why bother defining a\nmental blast order format?  Not much value there.  And if\nmental-blast-capability has state (e.g. power-level), then having a URI that\npoint to it would make sense, otherwise we may not need that URI at all.\n\nUltimately, for concepts for which the act is the most important (as opposed\nto the actor or the actee), a verb resource may be more convenient.  Again\nit is a matter of convenience and readability -  ultimately, they do still\nresult in state changes and transfers.  A few other examples may be\n&quot;meditate&quot; which could increase strength or &quot;bathe&quot; to increase cleanliness.\n8-)\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
