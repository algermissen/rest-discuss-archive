I recently gave a couple of talks on REST vs. WS-*: Facts, Myths \nand Lies. See:\n\nhttp://sanjiva.weerawarana.org/2007/11/rest-vs-ws-facts-myths-and-lies.html\n\nI&#39;m sure a few people here will disagree with me on some of my views on \nREST ;-). I&#39;d be very happy to be educated and also to debate some of the \ndetails - comments on my blog are preferred but I&#39;ll be happy to follow up \non this list too.
