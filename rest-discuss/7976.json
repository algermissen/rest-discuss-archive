I don&#39;t think\n&gt;   that many webstores (and other sites) will like this.\n&gt; \n&gt; - having a machine authenticate on your behalf (outside the browser)\n&gt;   is difficult and requires new protocols to be supported.\n&gt; \n&gt; prooveme.com attempts to solve both these problems by giving \n&gt; each OpenID user a client certificate. Now when the user \n&gt; authenticates the auth happens immediately (the OP can say \n&gt; &quot;does the user have the cert?\n&gt; yes or no?&quot;). Users won&#39;t see any website change as they \n&gt; login (though they do see a page change obviously).\n&gt; \n&gt; prooveme.com can also help you get a machine to authenticate \n&gt; on your behalf. If you give your certificate to a machine \n&gt; then it can use the existing OpenID protocol to login... as \n&gt; long as the machine&#39;s HTTP client supports HTTPS and \n&gt; redirects. As an example, CURL does.\n&gt; \n&gt; My idea is to build a small amount of GUI into prooveme.com \n&gt; to allow users to generate additional certificates with time \n&gt; or login attempt constraints and to allow those certificates \n&gt; to be distributed to supporting clients.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody has any thoughts I&#39;d be really interested to hear them.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
