The only difference is the\nname of the HTTP header in which the\nauthentication token is passed.  But really the\nwhole premise of HTTP auth is unreasonable for\nautomated clients.  Clients just send a secret\ntoken.  They don&#39;t need a mnemonic separating\nusernames from passwords.\n\nFor human users, the login form that comes in the\n401 response is as visible as you want.  In\npractice Mozilla appears to auto-fill most login\nforms I reach correctly and without issue which\nmakes me think that visibility is a non-issue.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, 24 Jul 2003, Chuck Hinson wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex Jacobson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;--On Wednesday, July 23, 2003 2:53 PM -0700 &quot;Roy T.

The bigger question is why duplicate cookie\n&gt; &gt;functionality with auth-specific headers?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I would think that while cookies may be a defacto standard, cookie-based\n&gt; authentication is not (i.e., there is no standard implementation of\n&gt; authentication using cookies).
