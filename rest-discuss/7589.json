The dissertation talks about a resource as a\n&gt; &gt; mapping to a set of values. This is fine for GET but doesn&#39;t provide\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; framework under which we can assess the value of other methods. If\n&gt; &gt; instead of talking about a resource as &quot;what you see&quot; we can talk\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; a resource is &quot;demarcating state and mapping to representationt\n&gt; types,\n&gt; &gt; defining what you see and what it understands&quot; we can then talk\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; what a PUT might do.\n&gt; IMHO this simply isn&#39;t &#39;REST for the rest of us&#39;\n&gt; It&#39;s back in thesis land, abstracted to hell and gone.\n&gt; If this is good/valuable, please find some plain English to say it.\n\nPoint taken. In plain english:\n\nA resource isn&#39;t just the representations/documents it returns when you\ndo a GET. The resource means something. It is the service exposing its\ninterface as information rather than methods. A GET takes a copy of the\ninformation in a particular document format for consumption by the user.\nA PUT replaces that information with information provided by the user.\nPOST adds information to the resource, and DELETE PUTs the null state.\nThese methods can enable interaction with any kind of information. REST\nallows other methods to be defined, but they always act on generic\ninformation.\n\nConsider the java bean concept. A client has an expectation that\nget_foo() and set_foo() are operating on the same thing. The thing might\nbe a simple member variable, but might just as easily be a more abstract\nconcept. Either way, the fact that we have a uniform way of accessing\nthe information makes it possible to develop applications we otherwise\ncouldn&#39;t. We can do property-based editing with a java-bean. If we used\narbitrary methods we couldn&#39;t. Standard content types are also required.\n\nSometimes when we modify a resource, it will only be that resource that\nchanges. However, just as often the change will set other processing in\nmotion. When we POST a new purchase order we expect resources that\ndescribe the set of open purchase orders to change. This information is\naccessible from multiple resources, and could conceivably be modified\nusring one of several resources. We can talk about resource that share\ninformation as overlapping. Changes that might not be a simple overlap\nmay include a commission being paid for the puchase order achieving a\nparticular state of completion. Any kind of business logic may be\nperformed by the server so long as it provides a reasonable\ninterpretation of the request to modify a particular resource. Even a\nGET is likely to have sort of side-effect. A log file is bound to be\nupdated, at least.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
