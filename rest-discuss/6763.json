In pr=\r\nactice, most operations omit this header, but \npartial GETs are commonly su=\r\npported.\n\nUsing this header to get only half a file implies that you know \n=\r\nsomething about the internal structure of the resource. It torpedoes \nconte=\r\nnt negotiation and the &quot;URL opacity&quot; constraint that many \nadvocate. It fru=\r\nstrates many caching schemes. It opens up the system \nfor &quot;tunneling,&quot; some=\r\nthing which Roy pointed out was ultimately doomed \nto failure. Therefore I =\r\nassume many would characterize the header as \nunRESTful. (Am I right?)\n\nAnd=\r\n yet I believe partial GET/PUT/POST/DELETE are all necessary if you \nare de=\r\naling with truly massive resources (e.g., video archives, \nvirtual machine =\r\nbacking storage -- individual files easily in the \n100GB+ size range). Does=\r\n that mean I have to choose between massive \nresources and being RESTful?\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
