This also gives the flexibility of the application \nresources and the model resources being on totally different servers and \nusing HTTP to communicate, or they can be on the same server and talk in \nwhatever local protocol they like. The HTML interface could even be \nwritten by someone else, or there could be a number of competing HTML \ninterfaces to your model resources, we&#39;re already starting to see this \nhappen with things like Amazon Light (http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/).\n\nPaul.\n\ntoydi wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Paul,\n&gt;\n&gt;On 11/8/05, Paul James &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But then with a browser, we can GET our &quot;update our model&quot;\n&gt;&gt;form that POSTs a request to update the _model_resource_, our application\n&gt;&gt;resource (form) validates the request and does a PUT on our model resource.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Point me out if I were wrong ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;[Some terms]\n&gt;Data resource - the main resource which model the application domain\n&gt;(e.g Person, Entry etc)\n&gt;Application resource - HTML forms where each of them is a resource.\n&gt;Model resource - (a synonym for Data resource?)\n&gt;\n&gt;[A Scenario] to update an Entry (in browser) would be:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. Get a form\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;GET /forms/updateEntryForm\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; 200 OK (return back a HTML form &#39;Update Entry&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Press the submit button in the form\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;POST /forms/updateEntryForm\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;(2.1 updateEntryForm process the request, internally send a PUT to\n&gt;Entry, or maybe just call the update function in Entry)\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; 200 OK (return back the form, with updated data inside, plus maybe\n&gt;an &quot;Update success&quot; message)\n&gt;\n&gt;It means during implementation, we don&#39;t have to put ugly hidden input\n&gt;fields in the form to tell about request method and data resource&#39;s\n&gt;location. The form have to implicitly notice which data resource it\n&gt;responsible to, and process the POST request internally.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;--\n&gt;-toydi-\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n"}}
