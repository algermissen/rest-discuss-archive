But I rec=\r\nently\n&gt;&gt; saw an interesting piece of code, which forced me to think again a=\r\nbout\n&gt;&gt; the basics.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The code I am looking at, is actually overriding=\r\n HttpServletRequest\n&gt;&gt; and oerriding &#39;getMethod&#39; to change HTTP verb from P=\r\nOST to GET. then\n&gt;&gt; doing request forwarding.\n&gt;&gt; So for the forwarded resou=\r\nrce its a GET request, even if from browser,\n&gt;&gt; its was a POST request.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nI see two problems with this,\n&gt;&gt; 1. The response is still given to user age=\r\nnt as part of POST request.\n&gt;&gt; 2. For web container, even if getMethod is o=\r\nverridden, its a POST\n&gt;&gt; request. (I do not know, if in the forwarded reque=\r\nsts, web containers\n&gt;&gt; strictly use the request objects thats wrapped and d=\r\no not use any of\n&gt;&gt; the internal information for that request)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The a=\r\ndvantage of this method, is that you do not need to persist\n&gt;&gt; information =\r\nbetween redirects, So you do not need session or other\n&gt;&gt; persistence mecha=\r\nnism.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Anyone else has seem this kind of idiom used in J2EE web appli=\r\ncations?\n\n&gt; None of this has any bearing on what is seen at the protocol le=\r\nvel. At the protocol level, a POST is a POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; From your description it=\r\n seems that this idiom is based on an incorrect understanding of the protoc=\r\nol.\n\nI don&#39;t see how that is responsive to the question.  The server is\ncha=\r\nnging a POST request inside the service handler to be a GET\nrequest so that=\r\n the handler can do some funky chicken dance that\nhas specific behavior wit=\r\nhin the current JDK.\n\nThis is essentially the same thing that Apache httpd =\r\ndoes when\nan internal content handler needs to perform an internal redirect=\r\n\nto obtain some part of the content, such as with server-side\nincludes bein=\r\ng embedded in the POST response.\n\nREST plays no part in this because it is =\r\nall behind the resource\ninterface provided by the servlet engine.  There ar=\r\ne no constraints\non POST, so changing the method to a safer one (like GET) =\r\nis\ncertainly not going to violate any of the client&#39;s expectations\nregardin=\r\ng their POST.\n\nIt may be weird.  It may be unreliable over time.  But it is=\r\n not\ninherently for or against RESTful interaction with the client.\nThe rea=\r\nson for doing content handling in this manner is usually\nso that the intern=\r\nal request contains the same authentication\ninformation as the original req=\r\nuest, thereby avoiding some\nsecurity issues during request handling.\n\n....R=\r\noy\n\n\n"}}
