Paul actually brings up an interesting possibility\nre: my motivation in pressing the issue of URI opacity:\n\n&gt; You aren&#39;t trying to solve a real problem that you&#39;ve\nexperienced in practice,\n&gt; just trying to achieve a sort of hypertext-less purity.\n\nIn fact this isn&#39;t at all the case.  Most of the thorniest\ntechnical problems I&#39;ve dealt with in my entire career have all\ntouched on the stuff we&#39;re talking about: from mapping and\ntransforming between arbitrary data models at Evolutionary\nTechnologies* a over a decade ago to exposing an information\nmodel for presence in URIspace at Activerse to exposing a rich\nand flexible ontological model for online news in HTTPspace at\nClickfeed to filesystem namespace wrangling and breaking the\nbarriers between filesystem and Web at Deepfile.  In particular,\nopaque URIs make my job harder at Deepfile in ways that I can&#39;t\nreally discuss in detail until we open the kimono on what we&#39;re\ndoing.\n\nThroughout all of these, it&#39;s become clear that namespaces ---\nabstract machines which resolve semantically-meaningful names\ninto things --- are incredibly powerful tools for solving a\nvariety of problems.  We&#39;ve got one of those tools in URIs, I\njust hate to see us lose the use of it for obscure, political /\ncultural, or mistaken reasons.\n\nThe fact that I&#39;m invoking some theoretical arguments to support\nwhat I&#39;m asserting doesn&#39;t mean that the point is academic;  it\nmeans that the theoretical arguments demonstrate (or at least\nshould be evocative of familiar) definitive generalizations.\nI&#39;ve admittedly not done as good a job as I would like with those\narguments, but the points we&#39;re dicussing touch some very\nfundamental and philosophical parts of computer science such as\ncomputability, identity, representability, information theory,\nand so on.\n\nI&#39;ve tried to supplement these with some toy but concrete\nexamples that illustrate the points I&#39;m making.  I&#39;m happy to add\nmore (and more detailed) examples, if that&#39;s useful, and if\nanyone else can think of any good examples (or counterexamples)\nI&#39;m happy to add them.  I&#39;d like to communicate the problem well\nenough for people to understand --- but this may indeed be as\nsubtle and thorny a topic to the RESTful as REST itself is to the\nRPC enthusiast or Web layman.\n\nCheers,\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
