Roy&#39;s right that\n&gt; &gt;declaring it with a mandatory extension would alleviate the problem of\n&gt; &gt;resources processing the request when they shouldn&#39;t, but IMO the\n&gt; &gt;request still needs to have uniform semantics in order to be RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve had this kind of discussion before, Mark.\n\nYes, I sent a pointer earlier to our last discussion.  I&#39;ve learned a\nlot since then. 8-)\n\n&gt;  You have invented\n&gt; a constraint that does not exist in either the Web or my dissertation,\n&gt; and are saying it defines RESTful.  Sorry, you simply cannot say that.\n&gt; You can say that REST + Mark&#39;s constraint is a better design, but\n&gt; you can&#39;t say that REST contains a restriction unless it actually\n&gt; appeared in my dissertation (because REST is the name given to the\n&gt; architectural style described there, not some general philosophy\n&gt; of design that changes over time). Otherwise, you&#39;ll drive me insane.\n\nI&#39;ve given the possibility that I&#39;m talking about a new constraint\na lot of thought Roy, and determined that it is not in fact a new\nconstraint, it&#39;s simply the uniform interface constraint as described\nin your dissertation.\n\n&gt; Browsers will know how to\n&gt; traverse super-duper-query resources because the representation type\n&gt; that links to those resources, along with URIs, will presumably tell\n&gt; them how to do so in the same way that &lt;img src=&quot;..&quot;&gt; tells them\n&gt; how to process in-line images.\n\nRight, link metadata.  Have you looked at RDF Forms?  I&#39;m all over\nthat. 8-)  But I claim that it&#39;s not a wildcard, and that REST&#39;s\nconstraints constrain how it can be used.\n\nPerhaps it would help to describe my issue from another POV.\n\nImagine we have a typical RPC service which publishes a &quot;query&quot;\noperation, accepts an XQuery document as an argument, and responds with\nthe result of that query.  Now, suppose we&#39;re not happy with RPC and\nwant to move to a more &quot;loosely coupled, document oriented&quot; style.  What\ndo we do?  We simply remove the requirement that the &quot;query&quot; operation\nappear in the request message.  Voila, instant loosely coupled service!\nRight?  I claim not, since in removing the operation from the message,\nthe connector semantics - &quot;query&quot; in this case - have not changed!!\nTherefore, despite this looking very much like state transfer because\n&quot;on the wire&quot; it&#39;s just document in, document out, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s just\nnon self-descriptive RPC.\n\nIs the latter service RESTful?  If not, how does it differ from the\nXQuery-via-POST example I&#39;ve claimed isn&#39;t RESTful?  I don&#39;t think it\ndoes, architecturally.  The connector semantics are not uniform, and in\nfact I could substitute any service specific semantic for &quot;query&quot;.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
