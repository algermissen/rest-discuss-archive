But we must support\n&gt; two different ways of embedding domain specific data - either the\n&gt; (fictional) Scandinavian Sales Order Vocabulary or the (also fictional)\n&gt; US Sales Order Vocabulary. How should we approach that problem?\n&gt;\n\nYou can do this by utilising RDF(a) and provide knowledge \nrepresentations that utilise both vocabularies at once (sidy by side), \ni.e., the result would be a kind of duplicated knowledge \nrepresentations. Or you can provide a mapping between both vocabularies, \ndeliver your information by only utilising one vocabulary, and provide \nfurther information that make the machine client aware of the vocabulary \nmapping (a rather generic property for this is rdfs:seeAlso).\n\n&gt; First of all, we cannot do content negotiation and switch on the media\n&gt; type because 1) we don&#39;t want to mint new domain specific media types,\n&gt; and 2) because we want to use the same media type but with different\n&gt; vocabularies/schemas.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend to switch the media type, but to utilise a rather \ngeneric media type instead.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, the prerequisites might even be wrong: is supporting multiple\n&gt; vocabularies the right thing to do? Lets assume it is right and continue\n&gt; on (but you are most welcome to question this!).\n\nI guess, this depends on the intended clients. They have to know how to \nprocess retrieved information (incl. their vocabularies). In a kind of \nideal open world with &quot;shared meaning&quot; and &quot;shared understanding&quot;, maybe \none vocabulary would be enough, e.g., the rather generic GoodRelations \nVocabulary for e-commerce.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBo\n\n\nPS: I do not know the content of your mentioned vocabularies. However, \nby reading their names it rather looks like a localisation problem (or \nmaybe a wrong vocabulary design; e.g. do not design to close).\n\n"}}
