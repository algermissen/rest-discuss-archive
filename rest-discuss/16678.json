In reality, with the deployed stack (Internet/Web) then REST \nwhen applied does require Internet Media Types, however, if a completely \nnew stack were to be created and deployed then any central registry of \nstandardized types and any identifier system could be used - the cost of \nmigrating to a new registry for (?what&#39;s the benefit) would be so \nextraordinarily high that it&#39;s very unlikely to happen though.\n\n&gt; I understand that some other protocol may instantiate a different form\n&gt; of registry, but how does replacing Internet media types not go against\n&gt; the definition of data format in 5.2.1.2?  Should I be reading 5.2.1.2\n&gt; as &quot;most commonly known as a media type,&quot; i.e. as an example and not as\n&gt; a definition?  In which case, should &#39;media type&#39; be read as &#39;data type&#39;\n&gt; elsewhere in 5.2.1.2?\n\nIf the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then what good does it do? your protocol and the \nmessages sent would be incompatible with the entire deployed stack of \neverything we have on the Internet/Web \n(clients/servers/agents/intermediaries/caches/apps), how is being \nincompatible with pretty much everything RESTful?\n\nA shared understanding between clients and servers which support many \nprotocols already exists, Internet Media Types, this allows message \nbodies to move from one protocol to another, and indeed for the messages \nbodies / entities being transferred to be usable by apps on either side. \nPerhaps it&#39;s not up to the protocol to define a new (un)-shared \nunderstanding, but rather to adopt the existing shared understanding in \norder to be RESTful.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
