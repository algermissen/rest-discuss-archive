Some comments;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The various RPC protocols are also very\n&gt; &gt; general purpose.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is like saying that Ethernet is general purpose.  It&#39;s true, but\n&gt; not too useful.  RPC is a lower layer than HTTP because it defines no\n&gt; application semantics, leaving them for the &quot;API&quot; to define.\n&gt;\n&gt; Linda, like HTTP and FTP and NNTP, defines the methods.  So you&#39;ve\n&gt; got an application layer contract - a coordination language -\n&gt; between endpoints a priori.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Linda bills itself a &quot;coordination language&quot; -- used\n&gt; &gt; for coordinating multiple software processes. Until I have a precise\n&gt; &gt; definition of that term I can&#39;t say for sure whether RPC protocols and\n&gt; &gt; HTTP are also coordination languages but the term seems to apply to\n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;RPC&quot; in general isn&#39;t.  But any coordination language can be built\n&gt; on top with RPC methods.  HTTP is a coordination language.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Definitions aside, the point remains: in terms of generality, HTTP has\n&gt; &gt; more in common with SOAP than with SMTP. It is not just about moving\n&gt; &gt; HTML pages from servers to clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say it&#39;s the other way around.  SMTP &quot;DATA&quot; has a precise\n&gt; meaning, not unlike POST.  SOAP defines no meanings; you can either\n&gt; build them on top (RPC), or you can inherit them from the underlying\n&gt; protocol.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; HTTP is similar. HTTP allows you to read from the storage with GET,\n&gt; &gt; write to it with PUT and the addresses are URIs. Because disk space in\n&gt; &gt; the real world is limited, HTTP also has DELETE. And because multiple\n&gt; &gt; people will be using the system at once, there is a need for a method\n&gt; &gt; that will create guaranteed-new &quot;storage locations&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say that POST was the movement of the tape.  PUT creates new\n&gt; locations.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; FTP is the closest protocol to HTTP conceptually. But really the gap\n&gt;\n&gt; I think NNTP is probably closest.  It has POST (that&#39;s where HTTP&#39;s\n&gt; POST came from), a basic get (ARTICLE), and a very specific type of\n&gt; put (for setting read messages).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; important, though, FTP&#39;s semantics do not allow the server to be an\n&gt; &gt; active participant in the computation. HTTP very precisely defines how\n&gt; &gt; the server can do complicated computations by itself. It is not just a\n&gt; &gt; holder of bits -- it can embody a complex service!\n&gt;\n&gt; You mean the app here I guess.  You should distinguish between the\n&gt; web server and the web app.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; efficiency and modeling simplicity. For instance WebDAV has a LOCK\n&gt; &gt; method which could be modeled as a POST of a LOCk object. In theory the\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT actually, since it is defined absolutely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can see how this modeling process works. You think about the things\n&gt; &gt; you want to work with as resources and you apply HTTP methods to them.\n&gt; &gt; One day I hope and expect that Web resource modeling will be as widely\n&gt; &gt; understood as object oriented modeling.\n&gt;\n&gt; Indeed, they are already closely related.  Component based modelling is\n&gt; even closer because you work from a generic containment based API.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I say &quot;quasi-universal&quot; because there are limits. Just as XML isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; really great for binary media, HTTP isn&#39;t really great for streaming\n&gt; &gt; real-time media. So for those applications you should use something\n&gt; &gt; else.\n&gt;\n&gt; (though perhaps with HTTP&#39;s application semantics)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is no doubt that HTTP has its limitations. For one thing there is\n&gt; &gt; not much software out there that knows how to deal with HTTP in a\n&gt; &gt; peer-to-peer or asychronous fashion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what that means.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is a lot of software out\n&gt; &gt; there that claims to use HTTP but is well behind the HTTP specification.\n&gt; &gt; Also, HTTP is not going to take over the universe from established\n&gt; &gt; protocols with large software bases\n&gt;\n&gt; ... anytime soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; MB\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\n&gt; Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\n&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
