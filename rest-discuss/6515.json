It could be a set, it could also be \n&gt;something else (e.g., an apple).\n&gt;\n\nI think a resource, or a URI, is always a box (or set). The resource is never \nan apple, only the concept of an apple.  If there is no apple, the box is \nempty -- that&#39;s the null set i.e. a 404.  I think the actual apple itself is \nalways a representation of the concept of an apple.\n\nThe analogy really breaks down if we insist that &quot;an apple&quot; is itself a \nresource, because we&#39;re dealing with the Internet here.  If we have a nonzero \nnumber of apples we can never be certain how many apples we have, and of \ncourse if someone were to eat an apple it wouldn&#39;t exactly deplete our stock.\n\nIf I&#39;m doing version control I may also have some rotten apples in my box, \notherwise all rotten apples are cached externally to my box until a fresh \napple takes the place of each (revalidation).  As soon as the box contains \none apple that apple multiplies like rabbits.  A resource is a concept not an \nobject, an object is always a representation of its concept.\n\nIf my box isn&#39;t identifying the null set it must always contain either at \nleast one (thing called an) apple, or one and only one pointer to some other \nbox of apples.  If I want my box of apples to directly identify another box \nof apples (author&#39;s preferred version) then it may contain one redirection \npointer.\n\nIf I want my box of apples to directly identify many other boxes of apples \n(reader&#39;s preferred versions) and it contains multiple redirection pointers, \nit has ceased to be a box of apples and has become a box of boxes.  The \napples in those other boxes may be the same, but they are not equivalent as \nthey are members of different sets.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Furhter, \n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges#Oranges_as_a_type_of_apple\n&gt;doesn&#39;t really make it okay to put oranges where &quot;apples&quot; is on the \n&gt;label, indeed it would be pushing it to put oranges where &quot;pomum \n&gt;aurantium&quot; is labelled.\n&gt;\n\nI would agree, had I implied that my box contained apples-as-fruits, which \nmaybe I did.  What if we call it &quot;a box of things called apples&quot; instead?  If \nthe pictures inside are shown to a reasonable person who is asked, &quot;what are \nthese&quot; the response would not be &quot;photographs&quot; it would be &quot;apples&quot; or \n&quot;pictures of apples&quot;.\n\nEither response satisfies &quot;things called apples&quot; and so does &quot;pomum \naurantium&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s hard to illustrate the point that if I wanted to imply that my box was \nonly full of what people commonly know as an apple but I also had some pomum \naurantiums laying around, that those should go in a box labeled &quot;oranges&quot;. \nI&#39;m hoping my re-writer can do a better job.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
