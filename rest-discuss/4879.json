My feeling is that consensus is swinging strongly towards \nRESTful architecture but it&#39;s taking time for the full implications to \nsink in.  Developers now know why they want resources to have URLs, next \nup is to absorb the value of separating out the impact on state with \ndifferent methods.  That seems completely reasonable to me -- smart people \nhave to prove things for themselves.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
