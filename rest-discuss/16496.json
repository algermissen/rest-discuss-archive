Any\n   format without a rigorous and public definition must be named with an\n   &quot;X-&quot; prefix, and publicly specified values shall never begin with\n   &quot;X-&quot;.\n\n\n[RFC4288 - Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures]\n\nFor convenience and symmetry with this registration scheme, subtype\n   names with &quot;x.&quot; as the first facet may be used for the same purposes\n   for which names starting in &quot;x-&quot; are used.  These types are\n   unregistered, experimental, and for use only with the active\n   agreement of the parties exchanging them.\n(...)\n   Types in this tree MUST NOT be registered.\n\n\nSo, even if anyone with good-sense will agree that such things should\nbe used as last-resource, and by no means encouraged, doesn&#39;t this\nmean that even the RFC&#39;s foresee the use of media-types that MUST NOT\nbe registered (no ambiguity here whatsoever), with the only constraint\nthat they should start with a X, and we have been wasting our time\nwith this discussion?\n\nAnd thanks to Michael Schuerig for this nice post, that in my opinion\nexposes all this debate in such a simple and clear way that more than\n100 post in this list could not...\n\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/blog/\n\n"}}
