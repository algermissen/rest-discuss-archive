This \n&gt; could roughly take one of two forms:\n&gt; 1. A set of specifications based on a range of technologies that focus \n&gt; on REST constraint compliance, or\n&gt; 2. A more HTTP-centric set of specifications working on providing \n&gt; features not available on the Web and probably not consistent with REST \n&gt; constraints such as pub/sub, transactions, reliable POST, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Methinks a little from column A, and a little from column B. The two \n&gt; seconds I have read reading descriptions on your site suggest more (2) \n&gt; than (1).\n&gt; \n&gt; While this is a good thing to be paying standards attention to, the \n&gt; first thing you will want to start to do is break the stateless \n&gt; constraint of REST. This will take what is potentially a major \n&gt; frustration for Roy in ripping off the name of his architectural style \n&gt; to use as the codeword for a specific non-web architecture and turn it \n&gt; into something much worse where the so-called REST architecture actually \n&gt; doesn&#39;t comply with REST style. I really would suggest a name like \n&gt; HTTP-* or Web-* rather than REST-* might go a long way towards heading \n&gt; off a significant amount of angst.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a naming problem, and not a technical problem. Personally I am \n&gt; looking for a forum where I can do exactly the kinds of things you seem \n&gt; to be looking at: Focus on enterprise use of HTTP, and fill in gaps that \n&gt; can be filled in at small scales in ways that are sympathetic to HTTP \n&gt; but don&#39;t comply with REST architecture or are for some other reason not \n&gt; immediately applicable to the Web. I&#39;m ready to talk pub/sub if you are :)\n&gt; \n\nThese are all great points.  The output of REST-* is not meant to be an \nacademic exercise.  We want to create specifications that can be \nimplemented and solve specific problems.  While our goal is to be \narchitecturally pure, software, in general, is very rarely \narchitecturely pure when in its final form.  As a result, initial \niterations (and even final ones) maybe a mix of both HTTP and \nREST-centric designs.  Remember, WE JUST STARTED!\n\nThis, IMO, does not mean we should change the name of the site or to \ncoin a new buzzword.  The goal we are striving for is to be RESTful. \nREST is our ideal.\n\nI think what we can do is to make it clear what parts of each \nspecification aren&#39;t restful and more HTTP-centric.  Maybe even a \nspecific very visible link &quot;What&#39;s RESTful, What&#39;s just HTTP?&quot; for each \nspecification would be warranted.  This link is where the spec designers \ncould state what they think is restful or not, and where people could \npost links to blogs and articles that discuss what is and isn&#39;t restful \nabout our specifications.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
