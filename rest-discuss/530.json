Instead of &quot;watchable resource&quot; and &quot;Watched-URI,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;subscribable resource&quot; and &quot;Subscribed-URI&quot;.  Instead of just\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Location,&quot; &quot;Subscription-Location.&quot;  Etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not bad...I wonder if we&#39;ll regret using pub/sub terminology if people\n&gt; think it is too unlike pub/sub. When you subscribe to Playboy you don&#39;t\n&gt; get a once a month notification that there is a new edition available.\n&gt; You get a *magazine*. So our model is somewhat different. As you said,\n&gt; it is almost cache invalidation.\n\nOTOH, I think this is easily justified --- for Web-based subscriptions\ntoday, you don&#39;t expect to get the content sent to you, you expect to have\nthe content change from time to time and you&#39;re expected to go and get it.\nThis is just gravy on top of that. :-)\n\n&gt; &gt; (4) It might be useful to require an appropriate validator\n&gt; &gt; (entity tag or last-modified header) in every notification.\n&gt;\n&gt; Require is a little strong. Remember that part of the genious of HTTP is\n&gt; that basic implementations are so simple. MUST&#39;s start raising the bar.\n\nThat&#39;s true.  Perhaps SHOULD.  The problem with MAY is that nobody\nimplements it, and application developers can&#39;t depend on it.\n\n&gt; One reason that I&#39;m not happy with it yet as a cache invalidation\n&gt; protocol is that it is not good at replicating collections. It&#39;s easy to\n&gt; watch a document that represents a collection. But you can only\n&gt; replicate the sub-resources if you understand the syntax of the\n&gt; container. HTTP should have a &quot;give me this resource&#39;s children&quot; method\n&gt; or something...\n\nI was just thinking about this in the shower thismorning, just a few minutes\nago!
