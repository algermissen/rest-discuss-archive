That may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; influenced by the fact that most *authoring* goes over HTTPS,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and thus caches won&#39;t be able to do any harm.\n\nI guess it comes down to tolerance for stale data...\n\nWhen it comes to GETs we are pretty tolerant, but for anything else -\nand that is what authoring is (post, put, delete, all those webDav\nmethods, synchronization etc.), you do care about stale data.\nBasically it&#39;s because it means you&#39;ll have to waste your time\ninvestigating or fixing it with those you&#39;re\ncollaborating/trading/communicating with. Basically we&#39;re all lazy and\nour time is precious.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez has a saying that &quot;any idea which couldn&#39;t\nstand a few decades of neglect is not worth anything&quot;\n\nThat however was before the internet came along and timescales have\ncompressed since.\n\nMy guess is that for most things in life, and certainly on the web, 20\nminutes is fine - I say that because stock quotes are typically\ndelayed 15 to 20 minutes and that&#39;s all about money - we really care\nabout money.\n\nUnless you have specialized needs, say buying stocks, or arbitrage in\nfinancial markets or say you&#39;re one of those bloggers who live by\nPagerank and breathlessly check Technorati every 5 minutes salivating\nover every trackback and such (Attention! Me! Get!), you could do with\nstale data for GETs. A decade of living with the web has shown that\nreal time is overrated.\n\nOf course, you&#39;re only human and time is short, you still have low\ntolerance for poor latency, you do need the sub-second response for\nthe Google query and that YouTube video should start streaming within\n15-20 seconds tops.\n\nThe other thing that is compressing timescales further is mobility and\nlocation awareness. Sometimes you do want to GET information relevant\nfor here and now.\n\nBut even that is a second order effect, we&#39;re pretty tolerant of staleness.\n\nAt least that&#39;s my take...\n\n--  Koranteng\n\nObservers are worried - http://koranteng.blogspot.com/\n\n"}}
