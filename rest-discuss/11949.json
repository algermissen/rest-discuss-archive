Take a look \nat this format:\n\nhttp://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=895\n\nPretty damn cool.  But think of the implications of general \napplications, specifically database centric ones.  With a general diff \nmodel you have to transform from the database to your language, then \ntransform from your language to the data format, then apply the the diff \ntransformation, then bring it back into your language for any business \nlogic processing, then finally back to the database.\n\nThink of how much complication something like this causes for your \nclient code as well?  If you start requiring the every-day developer to \ngenerate and deal with more artifacts than what you have with WS-* \nyou&#39;re not going to make much headway.\n\nBill\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
