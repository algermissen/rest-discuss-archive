It&#39;s an architectural style. HTTP allows highly RESTfull\nsystems. But an HTTP app can be more, or less, RESTfull.\n\nHowever, it&#39;s impossible IMHO to talk about *pure* REST. Some things\nRESTfull are in contradiction with others and the extent to which one\nis used over another will be context specific. Some things\nanti-RESTfull are perfectly acceptable to most developers and always\nwill be. Cookies are about to get another lease of life from openid\nfor example.\n\n\nHaving said that I think if there was enough interest one could make a\nqualitative benchmarking system. I&#39;ve dropped another post about that.\n\n\n&gt; This kind of Email is one of the reasons why I tend to\n&gt; avoid using the R-word.\n\nAnd that would be quite right except when discussing the properties of\na particular web application/service as they pertain to it&#39;s\nscalability and maintainability. Which is what we do here of course.\n\nRoy has complained before about the term being hijacked. And I think\nit is slightly dangerous to talk about RESTfull toolkits and REST\nsupport. I am quite happy for people to say &quot;this one thing is more\nRESTfull than this other thing&quot;. As long as it is of course.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion I ask you this: is ML a functional language? Yes? Is ML\na pure functional language? Is C a functional language?\n\nYou take my point I&#39;m sure: in the absence of another word REST is\ngoing to be misused for implementation specifics.\n\n\n&gt; Pirates. &quot;Style&quot;. Pthrupt!\n\nWatch it. I&#39;ll have you down that plank before you can polish your\nsabre.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
