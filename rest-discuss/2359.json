Would you argue that a GET that bumped up a\n&gt;&gt; counter was safe?\n\n&gt; For me, this is the key question (and perhaps a little too tempting not\n&gt; to address).\n\nOkay, there&#39;s a qualitative difference between a GET that simply\nbumps up a counter, which is *generally* safe, and one that triggers a\nmore meaningful state change, which is *generally* not safe.\n\n&gt; The resource in this Google example is the results of a search query. The\n&gt; GET does not modify those results.\n\nEven if the GET does modify the results it&#39;s not necessarily unsafe (e.g., the\nresource may contain the counter of the number of times it&#39;s been accessed)\n\nConversely even if the GET doesn&#39;t modify the results it&#39;s not necessarily\nsafe (e.g., accessing the resources always returns the same result, but\nunbeknownst to the user, deducts five dollars from their checking account)\n\n&gt; The &#39;counter&#39; isn&#39;t related to the resource being requested. Nor is it\n&gt; (necessarily) exposed to the user.\n\nI don&#39;t see how you can say that it isn&#39;t related to the resource being\nrequested;\nits whole purpose is to count the number of times it&#39;s been accessed which\nseems like\na pretty important relationship.\n\nI actually agree with Mark in the general case: a URL that suddenly starts\nto return 403 when dereferenced via GET some magic number of times is bad\npractice.  A user should, in general, be able to blithely dereference URIs\nusing\nGET without it having any impact on the web they are using.\n\nWhere I see the line being drawn though is when this dereferencing is\nhappening\nwithin the context of a known authorization relationship with that web.  That\nauthorization was given under the explicit terms that that specific resources\nwill only be accessed a limited number of times.  Given those terms, I no\nlonger\nsee the change as being of &quot;unexpected significance&quot;; in fact it has precisely\nthe\nsignificance that the user expected it to have, which would make it safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
