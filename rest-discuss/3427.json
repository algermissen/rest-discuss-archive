For starters, I\nintend to support the following specs:\n\nRSS 0.92\nRSS 2.0\n\nHowever, how would I RESTfully determine which version to return to a given\nrequest?  Getting a request Accept: header value of &quot;text/xml&quot; or\n&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; wouldn&#39;t necessarily do any good (would it?).  As a\nresult, I have implemented a query parameter called &quot;rss&quot; which can have the\nvalues of &quot;0.92&quot; or &quot;2.0&quot;.  However, I have seen some other blog systems\n(most notably Sam Ruby&#39;s [1]) that use pseudo-extensions (&quot;.rss&quot;, &quot;.rss2&quot;)\nto acheive the same goal.\n\nSo, either way you look at it, a given resource could have three URIs.  Each\nURI returns a slightly different representation of the resource (e.g.\nadditional data in RSS 2.0 that&#39;s not in RSS 0.92, etc.).  To some extent, I\nthink this is okay, RESTfully speaking.  However, this brings into question\nthe need for content negotiation.\n\nWhen should one technique be used above another?  When conneg is not an\noption, what is the best technique to use, and is that technique nothing but\na kludge?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n[1] http://www.intertwingly.net/rss/\n\n\n"}}
