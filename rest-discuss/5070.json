When using SOAP some developers initially expect to not have to \n&gt; understand the details, and they will do their best to avoid \n&gt; understanding XML, SOAP, XSD, WSDL, etc. But, sooner or later they are \n&gt; going to have to understand the XML that is moving across the wire and \n&gt; understand how to get their SOAP toolkit to produce the required interface.\n\nThat&#39;s the big one IMO.
