As for the HTTP PUT\n&gt; verb being an &quot;ADD if not exist, otherwise EDIT&quot;, I have always had issues\n&gt; with this.  PUT is the logical equivalent of:\n&gt;\n&gt;     IF GET\n&gt;         EDIT\n&gt;     ELSE\n&gt;         ADD\n&gt;     END\n&gt;\n&gt; In my opinion (for what little that is worth), HTTP PUT is a &quot;lazy&quot; verb.\n&gt; You are attempting to perform a compoung command using a single command.\n&gt; This seems to me to be a particularly non-RESTian verb.\n\nIt&#39;s very RESTian in that the conditional is implemented on the server,\nwhich allows the client to PUT data to a location known by the client in\nadvance - bypassing gnarly issues of ownership of IDs. The server becomes\nstupid and the client becomes smart. Not all Web applications /have/ to be\nbuilt this way, but it is a very powerful way to build applications.\n\n\n\n"}}
