Colour me an entire rainbow of surprised.\n&gt; Really! I would never have thought. (Sure, they have good \n&gt; reasons to take that position. sure is convenient that it so \n&gt; happens to conflict with progress, though.)\n\nAs I discussed the ideas with him I came to reluctanty agree with his\npoints.  Cynicism really only reflects negatively on the cynic.\n\n&gt; But how is that relevant? In what possible way would \n&gt; supporting draconically parsed XHTML have broken existing \n&gt; non-XML sites\n\nApples and oranges.  We were not talking about XHTML we were talking about\nother things, and frankly I don&#39;t remember the specifics as it was probably\n6 months ago.\n\n&gt; Refusing to break existing clients&#39; stuff relevant is not at \n&gt; all incompatible with an interest in preventing the open web \n&gt; from evolving in a direction where it works as well or better \n&gt; than any proprietary MSFT platform.\n\nLike I implied, I don&#39;t immediately presume evil intentions but as a company\nMSFT is a fudiciary to its shareholders, not some intangible &quot;for the\ngreater good.&quot;  Do like the man you got kicked by the jackass; consider the\nsource and go about your business.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n\n\n"}}
