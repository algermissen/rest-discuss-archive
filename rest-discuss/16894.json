In my=\r\n original design, I gave the resources which only belong to user A a realm =\r\nlike &quot;A@...&quot; during digest authentication. And give user B &quot;B@examp=\r\nle.com&quot; as realm for those resources which only belong to B. But some resou=\r\nrces is shared by A and B, I cannot make a third realm alone other than A o=\r\nr B, because A also might share resources with others, the will be infinite=\r\n number of realm for user A. (Browser will ask for authentication for each =\r\nnew realm discovered, right?) What I want is the realm or challenge for sha=\r\nred resources belong to A and B could be something like a super set of A an=\r\nd B.\nI&#39;ve just learned that multiple WWW-Authenticate header in different s=\r\ncheme in challenge response is possible. But how about the same scheme? Wil=\r\nl it ask for two times user credentials (for A&#39;s and B&#39;s)?\nOr CORS and UM c=\r\nan help me fix this problem in other way? Thanks.\n\nBest regards,\nZhi-Qiang =\r\nLei\nzhiqiang.lei@...\n\n\n"}}
