I have a set of draft posts and published=\r\n posts. In order to\n&gt; &gt; change a draft post to a published post I need to &quot;=\r\npublish&quot; it. How should I\n&gt; &gt; represent one such command in REST?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\nere is my thoughts so far:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The two sets are represented by two diff=\r\nerent ATOM resources, each having\n&gt; &gt; their own URL. Each individual post a=\r\nlso has it&#39;s own resource URL. Nothing\n&gt; &gt; special here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order t=\r\no publish a post I can do:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Use a new HTTP verb called &quot;PUBLISH&quot; =\r\nand send that to the draft post I\n&gt; &gt; want to publish.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) POST the =\r\ncomplete blog post representation on the &quot;published posts&quot; URL,\n&gt; &gt; thereby=\r\n adding the blog post to the published list, and implicitly remove it\n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nrom the draft list.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Do an empty POST to a sub-resource of the bl=\r\nog post named &quot;publish&quot;\n&gt; &gt; indicating that I want to &quot;publish&quot; that resour=\r\nce.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) Expose the single &quot;published&quot; state value as a sub-resource =\r\nof the blog\n&gt; &gt; post and POST true/false to that resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 5) Maint=\r\ning a non-ATOM list of published blog post identifiers. When\n&gt; &gt; publishing=\r\n a blog post I can POST that post&#39;s identifier to the &quot;published&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ident=\r\nifier list (instead of sending the complete set of blog post data).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n What are your suggestions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
