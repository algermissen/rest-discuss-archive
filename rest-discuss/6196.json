I was just having a conversation with my\n&gt;&gt; coworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\n&gt;&gt; having to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\n&gt;&gt; sessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to their\n&gt;&gt; friends. Now their friends would jump into their session and potentially\n&gt;&gt; be able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click shopping) and\n&gt;&gt; cause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. It&#39;s called HTTP authentication. Anything involving personal, \n&gt; private data should require a username password combo to access. \n&gt; Presumably if someone e-mails their URL and username and password to a \n&gt; friend, they know what they&#39;re doing.\n\nDon&#39;t joke about that - this should not be encouraged in anyway.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
