New HTTP methods dont go\n&gt; &gt; through firewalls, and arent supported by all the various http client\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s not my experience. Any examples?\n\nsorry, I meant proxy servers, which are the bane of my life (that and\nthe lack of a centralised proxy server setting on linux and the\ninability of java clients to automatically determine proxy settings\nwith any reliability).\n\nOver HTTP (and not HTTPS), a fair few proxies, especially the old MS\nones that some companies still have around, are prone to rejecting\nverbs they dont like, which can mean the entire pre-DAV set of verbs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; libs out there. In particular, if javascript in IE/firefox/webkit\n&gt; &gt; doesnt support the method, it aint going to be used in AJAX land.\n&gt;\n&gt; IE6 and Firefox support arbitrary methods. The fact that XHR in IE7\n&gt; doesn&#39;t (right now) has been reported (and I think accepted) as a\n&gt; regression.\n\nany timetable for fixing that?\n\n&gt; &gt; If someone were to start a REST design patterns doc, &quot;inventing new\n&gt; &gt; verbs&quot; would be the antipattern, one that has just surfaced again in\n&gt; &gt; Web3S.\n&gt;\n&gt; I strongly disagree.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know that its &quot;PATCH&quot; may have appeal, but once you try and have a\n&gt; &gt; complete sequence of operations in a single verb, you have to worry\n&gt; &gt; about whether the sequence is atomic, what its rollback on failure\n&gt; &gt; mode is, whether it is partially visible, etc. WS-RF&#39;s bulk get/set\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. That&#39;s a feature, not a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; had this problem: they didnt spec the atomicity/isolation so you have\n&gt; &gt; no way of knowing if you are doing atomic or non atomic ops. Whereas\n&gt; &gt; if you have to make a set of operations, well, your expectations are\n&gt; &gt; set nice and low.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do agree that promising too much atomicity can be a problem. But that\n&gt; only means you need to be careful when defining the method. For\n&gt; instance, I don&#39;t see how requiring a PATCH operation to be atomic would\n&gt; be a problem. If all goes wrong, a server still return 5xx.\n\nI guess you could have an extra header saying &quot;x-atomicity&quot; or\nsomething. The risk is that you, the client, talk to one server and\nget an atomic experience, and all is well, then you go to another\nimplementation and suddenly you end up with race conditions,\nconcurrency problems, other callers seeing operations in the wrong\norder, etc. Stuff that shows up when you go live, not in testing. In\nWSRF there is/was no way to request atomic operations, or any way to\ndetermine if an endpoint was going to be atomic or not. Which made the\nbulk ops useless for atomic ops, and only for saving time over\nlong-haul links.\n\nNow, if you look at WebDAV specs, its semantics on the big move/copy\nops are effectively defined to be those of the win9x file system, i.e.\nif the operation stops half way through, the outcome is indeterminate,\nbut probably half-complete. No transactions there.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
