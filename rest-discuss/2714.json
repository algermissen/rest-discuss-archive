Some clients\ncan\n&gt; perform periodic queries against the server to obtain this data, these\nothers\n&gt; cannot.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does REST have to say about this class of problem?\n\nModel the receiver as a set of resources, then update them as needed in\nreal-time.\nEssentially, reverse the roles of client and server.\nWith HTTP, this means putting a port 80 listener on the client and handling\nPUT or POST.\nThe resources don&#39;t have to be persisted to disk, or anything like that.\n\nRemember - The Web works both ways.\n\n"}}
