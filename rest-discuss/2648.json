Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Seairth Jacobs&quot; &lt;seairth@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Response code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Headers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Entity-body (Message-body)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, which of the above is actually part of the representation of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resource?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this change based on the verb being used?  Does this change based\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the response code being used?  Are some headers considered part of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; representation while others are not?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believe a client agent needs to understand all of them to understand\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; is and is not the representation.\n&gt; &gt; For example, the Content-Type header is metadata /about/ the\n&gt; representation.\n&gt; &gt; A status code tells you if the entity is even a representation or not.\nAnd\n&gt; &gt; so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is also my current understanding, so I don&#39;t disagree with what you\nare\n&gt; saying.  However, this view seems almost useless when talking about REST\n(at\n&gt; least to me).  It seems to me that part of what makes REST effective is\n&gt; that, given a particular RESTful system, we can all agree on what does and\n&gt; does not constitute the representation of a resource (either sent or\n&gt; received, for that matter).  However, with HTTP this is not very clear to\n&gt; me.  I would think that the Message-body is always part of the\n&gt; representation (when there is one).  But the headers seems to be less\n&gt; well-defined.  For instance, would the &quot;Location&quot; header in a 201 response\n&gt; be considered part of the representation?  As you suggest, Content-Type\n&gt; would be about the respresentation.  Does that mean that it is not part of\n&gt; the representation?\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing that has suddenly occured to me is that I may be following a\nfalse\n&gt; assumption here as well.  I assumed that in RESTful applications,\n&gt; representations were *always* sent (in responses).  However, the more I\n&gt; think about this, the more this doesn&#39;t make sense.  If I can send a\nrequest\n&gt; that contains no representation (e.g. GET), then I should be able to\nreceive\n&gt; a response that has no presentation (201 maybe?).  This doesn&#39;t\nnecessarily\n&gt; help me understand what is part of a representation when one is sent, but\n&gt; this changed view would at least allow me to avoid wondering about several\n&gt; HTTP response codes for which there does not appear to be a\nrepresentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
