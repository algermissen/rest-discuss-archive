We know this because Seairth\n&gt; is specifically asking about a resource for which caching is\n&gt; important. Given this information, your suggestion to use digest\n&gt; authentication to &quot;maintain the privacy of the authenticator&quot;\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make any sense.\n\nYeeessss.... and I&#39;m saying that a cached representation of a resource is\nnot equivalent to the range of representations that resource is capable of\nemitting. There are scenarios where this is an important distinction.\n\n&gt; Does it seem odd to anyone that I am needing to argue that it is\n&gt; important to encrypt private data before transmitting it over a\n&gt; public network?\n\nWho said public network? Once again, there are scenarios where protecting\nthe authentication credentials is valuable, but the representations\nthemselves aren&#39;t as sensitive. I grant that there are likely many, many\nmore which do require encryption for appropriate security, but am\nunwilling to say that all scenarios require it.\n\nSince we seem to be starting to repeat ourselves, I suggest we move on.\n\n\n\n"}}
