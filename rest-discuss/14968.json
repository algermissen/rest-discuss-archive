The original site would need to check availability\n&gt; and respond back to the buyer with problems, which could also cause\n&gt; race conditions and vicious circles.  Not a pretty picture.\n\nFor those in supply-chain management, this is the arena of Distribution Requirements(or resource) Planning.\n\nhttp://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/distribution-distribution-requirements-planning\n\nThe traditional scenario is that of a bookstore where people can post books for sale, like Amazon. DRP was designed before the web so generally each &quot;store&quot; would send a forecast and the DRP system would allocate inventory based on the forecast AND actual orders. That&#39;s no longer real-time enough. \n\nA good example of handling race conditions today is online ticket sales. Tickets (inventory) are reserved for a period of time. If the financial transaction occurs within a given period of time, the tickets are permanently removed from stock. If the basket goes stale, the tickets (inventory) are returned to stock and become available.\n\nThis assumes there&#39;s a single inventory location. It would take work but your could come up with a peer-based solution using the Amazon model or some other peer-to-peer model like http://www.cs.virginia.edu/papers/vecchio-p2p-IDEAS05.pdf\n\nMark W.\n\n"}}
