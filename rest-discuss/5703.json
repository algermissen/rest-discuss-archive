If so, then I think the  \n&gt; &#39;Opaque URI&#39; meme qualifies as one, and you just stepped in it. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what Roy Fielding had to say on the topic, and I considered  \n&gt; it important enough to add to the microformats-rest wiki:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/opacity\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds like you should join us there. ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/\n&gt;\n&gt; The key, as I believe Jon Hanna said, is to make sure that clients  \n&gt; do not HAVE to know the URI&#39;s internal structure, but that doesn&#39;t  \n&gt; mean that *you* can&#39;t do MORE if you have appropriate  \n&gt; understanding. And if enough people share that understanding --  \n&gt; like a microformat -- there&#39;s nothing to prevent you from taking  \n&gt; advantage of that.  As long as you don&#39;t do something that makes  \n&gt; life harder for -other- people...\n\nEr, not quite.  The key is that the server is free to tell the client\nthat there does exist structure in a given URI-space, and then the\nclient is free to make use of that knowledge in future requests.\nThat is how server-side imagemaps worked -- HTML says that the src\nURI is structured such that appending &quot;?X,Y&quot; to that URI, where\nX and Y are non-negative integers, corresponds to points on a map\nthat can respond to future GET requests.\n\nThus, one way for the server to tell the client that a given URI\nis structured is to provide the URI in a standard element of a\nstandard media type that has been defined as such.  Another is to\ninclude the URI in a response header field.\n\nNote, however, that I am also one of the creators of the robots.txt\nstandard.  That particular scenario requires that the spider find out\nthe constraints on a site prior to the very first access of a real\nhypertext link.  It is too late to obtain that information by\nlooking at header fields after a normal request is made.  Adding a\nnew method to HTTP was out of the question because it would have\nto be deployed before it could be used [OPTIONS could fulfill that\npurpose today, 12 years after robots.txt was defined].  Adding fields\nto DNS wasn&#39;t an option back then, either.  Reserving /robots.txt\nremains the best option given the alternatives available.\n\nNote, however, that no other &quot;reserved URI&quot; features have the same\nrequirements as spiders, so it is still true that favicon and pics\nchose the wrong solution.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
