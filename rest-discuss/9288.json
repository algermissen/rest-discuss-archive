So the ETag would be for the new resource, not \nthe base resource.  A conditional PUT would do nicely.  From the client \nperspective, the semantics are &quot;full replacement&quot; and the client doesn&#39;t \nneed to care that the new nodeset gets merged into another resource.  \nRepeating the server-side XPointer GET reflects the changes and assigns a \nnew ETag.\n\nBut this is what I really want to do...\n\n[1] http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_darcs:Patch_theory\n\nDARCS&#39; strength over other RCS solutions are its powerful merge and undo \ncapabilities.  I keep thinking along these lines, but applying DARCS patch \ntheory to XML trees seems a bit daunting.
