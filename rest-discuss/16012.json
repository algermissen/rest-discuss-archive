I&#39;d suggest the dublin core=\r\n DCMI vocabulary. See: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/\n\nLets lo=\r\nok at your book example. DCMI defines terms &quot;title&quot; and &quot;source&quot;. The space=\r\n of values for title is a string represent the title of the book, while for=\r\n source we could choose to use the URN for the ISBN of the book.\n\n&lt;rdf:RDF =\r\nxmlns:rdf=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;\n         xmlns:dc=\r\n=3D&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; &gt;\n    &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Cookbook-Scalability/dp/059680168=\r\n8/&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;dc:source rdf:resource=3D&quot;urn:isbn:0596801688&quot; /&gt;\n         =\r\n &lt;dc:title&gt;RESTful Web Services Cookbook: Solutions for Improving Scalabili=\r\nty and Simplicity&lt;/dc:title&gt;\n    &lt;rdf:Description/&gt;\n&lt;rdf:RDF/&gt;\n\nFor the NAS=\r\nA example, we have to pick some namespace in which NASA exists. I was able =\r\nto find an OID for NASA, so I&#39;m using that to say that NASA is the publishe=\r\nr (another dublin core term) of http://www.nasa.gov.

Or that http://www.nasa.gov/ identifies a resource=\r\n\n&gt; that is NASA?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to start an httpRange-14 flamewar, but=\r\n just wondering\n&gt; if REST&#39;s notion of Resource is flexible enough to typica=\r\nlly\n&gt; accommodate these two use cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; //Ed\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
