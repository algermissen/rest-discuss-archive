Have the user observe some property of the system to determine\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whether to retry themselves. [...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; A technique I&#39;ve used once was to have the client send an HTTP header\n&gt; &gt; in the POST request which played a role sort of like a client-side\n&gt; &gt; etag with respect to the request body.  The server, upon receiving the\n&gt; &gt; message and updating the state of the resource, would return another\n&gt; &gt; header containing a hash of the last days worth of tags (which wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; many) on GET requests to that resource so that it could check if *its*\n&gt; &gt; update was applied.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I was thinking about taking the POST-and-GET-to-check route instead\n&gt; of a special interaction pattern. In the case of APP this would be\n&gt; even simpler,\n&gt; as all I&#39;d need to be looking for as a client is the existence of the\n&gt; POSTed entry\n&gt; in the collection (though I&#39;ll have to do some more evaluation of how\n&gt; to actually\n&gt; check for identity[1]..ETag, Atom ID,...)\n\nBut that would be an implementation dependency, so your client\nwouldn&#39;t be reusable with, say, non-APP resources.  My approach is\ngeneric.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One problem of this I see is laency. When could the client expect\n&gt; that its POST\n&gt; did not came through if it does not see the intended effect? What if\n&gt; the POST response\n&gt; (the one id did not receive) was 202 as opposed to 201?\n\nThen it would have to keep checking or else a subscription would have\nto be made.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] Mark, how did you ensure Client-ETag uniqueness across clients?\n\nIIRC, it was something like a MIME Message-Id.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
