OTH, it causes\n&gt; real dispatching pains because you do not know what you have before you poke\n&gt; into the body.\n\nObviously there&#39;s a balance.\n\nBut if you&#39;re using an encompassing &quot;one big media type&quot;, then don&#39;t\nyou inevitably have &quot;large&quot;, internal elements with different\nsemantics?\n\nContrived example of, say, &quot;financial document&quot; containing &quot;invoice&quot;\nand &quot;payment&quot;.\n\nTwo different, sizable, media types embedded in the generic &quot;financial\ndocument&quot;.\n\nSo, as a consumer, my &quot;invoice processor&quot; has to basically accept\n&quot;any&quot; &quot;financial document&quot; and then check it to see if it actually IS\nan invoice. I certainly can&#39;t ASSUME it&#39;s an invoice, it can be\nanything.\n\nBut, overall, it doesn&#39;t change the semantic load or burden on\nconsumers trying to leverage the document. The &quot;work&quot; is essentially\nthe same whether the invoice is embedded in the larger payload, or if\nit&#39;s its own document. The documentation of the semantics is the same\n(largely), the code to leverage that data etc is the same. The large\ndocument doesn&#39;t really &quot;gain&quot; anything save a vague promise and a\ncheck to ensure I&#39;m actually working with the right data.\n\nClearly you don&#39;t want ultra fine grained media types (tho, arguably,\nthat&#39;s what a micro format is).\n\nAnyway, that&#39;s just the other side of the fence in my opinion of this\ndiscussion.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
