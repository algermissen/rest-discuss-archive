Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; REST isn&#39;t about what your URLs look like, that&#39;s a\n&gt; matter of pref=\r\nerence, not constraint.\n\nI totally agree with Erick on this. \nAll the confu=\r\nsion comes precisely with the URL templating approach, which is fine but I =\r\ndo not favor much.\n\nDo not think on URIs. They can even be consecutive numb=\r\ners, who cares. Focus on what you are requesting, the resources.\nYou have, =\r\nit seems, several resources there.\n1. One that is a &quot;container&quot; of players.=\r\n You may not need that one, as the players may be grouped by a field or som=\r\nething. For now, you have it.\n2. The player itself.\n3. A player&#39;s type list=\r\n, which contains the player types. I guess those are just a value in for a =\r\nfield. It may even be something more complex, like a format (e.g. each play=\r\ner type may have a different format).\n\nSo, as you have three resources, thi=\r\nnk then you will need three different URIs. Those may be ugly or not, who c=\r\nares, what it is important is to have access to all those from a starting p=\r\noint.\n\nFollowing the suggestion Erick provides, will not only eliminate the=\r\n type list from being a resource, but also simplify the interaction, as you=\r\n won&#39;t need to request the type first in order to create the player.\n\nCheer=\r\ns.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
