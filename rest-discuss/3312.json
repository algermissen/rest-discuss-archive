Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Huh. I thought I looked at OPTIONS and it wasn&#39;t appropriate... don&#39;t know\n&gt; what I was thinking. Maybe I was looking only at what methods were\n&gt; allowed...\n&gt; This seems like the best approach so far.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the text from the RFC. The only downside is responses are not\n&gt; cacheable.\n&gt;\n&gt; [deleted]\n&gt;\n\nHmm... When the RFC says the response is not cachable, I am wondering if\nthey have proxies, etc. in mind.  For the client, it seems that caching\nwould have to be necessary unless the server could guarantee the metadata in\nthe OPTIONS response won&#39;t change for a certain period of time (which is\neffectively caching).  Otherwise, the verb is potentially useless...\n\nWRT this thread, you would do an OPTIONS to a URI and get a response back\nindicating the POST/PUTable content-types.  Since there is no guarantee that\nthe allowable types are going to ba allowable a moment later when you do\nyour actual POST/PUT, then it follows that it making a decision on the\nreturned metadata a day later would be little different than making a\ndecision on it a second later.  At worst case, if the resource&#39;s metadata\nchanged between the time the OPTIONS response came back and the client\nsubmitted a request based on the returned metadata, the server would/should\nreturn the appropriate error.  In turn, this would prompt the client to\nrequest the OPTIONS again and see what has changed...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
