W=\r\ne have chosen to treat a list as a collection of row elements.  A browser-b=\r\nased client will support editing of the list in a tabular view.  In additio=\r\nn to adding and removing entire rows, users will also be able to edit indiv=\r\nidual fields within a row.  We would like to support a Save button that sav=\r\nes all changes (possibly across multiple rows) on the current screen in one=\r\n http request.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our current thinking is that we would send back a colle=\r\nction containing only the rows to be updated (or inserted/deleted). However=\r\n (without getting down into the details) the back-end will need to be able =\r\nto determine whether individual fields in each row actually need to be upda=\r\nted, so there is some question as to how to represent whether or not an ind=\r\nividual field has been changed.  We would like to use the same document typ=\r\ne both for getting the list entries and posting changes back to the list. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any pointers to some examples of MIME types or applic=\r\nation protocols that support this sort of model? \n&gt; \n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
