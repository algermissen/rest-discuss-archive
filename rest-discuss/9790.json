I also want the option of using the same front end to\ntalk to classic HTTP(S)  accessible systems.\n\nWhat I may do is create a custom XMPP message, call it RestOperation,\nwith the normal verbs+headers as for HTTP, routing the stuff to the\nback end which can treat it as a normal servlet request. The response\nwould be packaged up and resent to the sender, with status code.\n\nthe problem here is addressing. I&#39;m going to talk to something like\nnode1@jabberfarm from node2@jabberfarm. Everything sending a message\nneeds a unique address to identify the sender. Everything receiving a\nmessage also needs a unique jabber id. Where do URI fit in here?\n\nI could have some URI like xmpp://node@jabberfarm/services/ntp/status\n; and have node@jabberfarm handle the dispatch. For responses, well,\nI&#39;d have to do something there with a unique address for every client,\nor one per process+dispatch on some URI in the response.\n\nThe other option is I create lots and lots of jabber identies, which\nis ok for a private openfire server; doesnt scale to reusing third\nparty relay servers (or should I call them ORBs :), like googletalk.\nUsing a separate jabber ID for every resource stops me having a notion\nof hierarchical resources, but lets me do very dynamic stuff, in which\nresources are free to move around on the network. This is very ORBy,\nexcept I&#39;d be staying with the usual verbs.\n\nthoughts?\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
