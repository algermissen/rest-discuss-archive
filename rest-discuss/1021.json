However, if in a hyptertext representation of\n&gt; http://foo.com/bar/b I encounter &lt;a href=&quot;..&quot;&gt; I can infer --- indeed, \n&gt; the\n&gt; hypertext processor is being explicitly told --- that \n&gt; http://foo.com/bar/ is\n&gt; a resource.  So my question is this:  what is special about hypertext \n&gt; and\n&gt; hypertext processors that they should be allowed to do this?\n\nAbsolutely nothing. This behaviour is specified by RFC1808, not the HTML \nspec. If you want to use a relative URI in Flash, in RDF, in SVG, in \nMIME messages, in XML - it acts the same way. It just happens that HTML \nis the most widely deployed.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Also, a practical issue is that any web server I&#39;ve used typically\n&gt;&gt; makes it a lot easier to bind a chunk of code to query based URI than\n&gt;&gt; hierarchical based URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Without a doubt.  It&#39;s unfortunate that the very software that builds \n&gt; the\n&gt; most powerful namespace in the world so completely fails to give us \n&gt; tools for\n&gt; using that namespace in powerful, flexible ways.\n\nI so agree. This is one of the things that URISpace [1] groped around; \nhaving one flexible, URI-savvy format for configuring your server \n(including authentication, authorisation, processing, http headers, \netc.), your surrogate (aka reverse proxy), as well as things like robots \ncontrol and privacy policies would be very powerful.\n\n1. http://www.w3.org/TR/urispace.html\n\n--\nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
