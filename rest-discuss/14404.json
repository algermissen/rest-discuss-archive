Resource modeling before URI\nmodeling is, I think, of critical importance.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Why is getting away from implementations and driving towards modelling\n&gt; helping?\n&gt; \n\nWho&#39;s to say?  All I know is the current approach is an abysmal\nfailure, so there&#39;s nowhere to go but up.  Please post continuation or\nresponse to this debate in the other thread; I created this new thread\nprecisely because the last one went off-topic into intense criticism.\nSeparation of concerns, and all...\n\nThanks,\nEric\n\n"}}
