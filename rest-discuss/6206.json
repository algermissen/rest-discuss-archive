Also, if there are any differences. What desirable  \n&gt; properties of REST would you loose when opting foor cookies? I&#39;m  \n&gt; aware of differences in client support, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a  \n&gt; real REST issue.\n\nA cookie can be just like HTTP auth. I&#39;m about to publish an article\non this on onlamp.com - it&#39;s just taking longer than I thought because\nof other commitments.\n\n\n&gt; Also, in case of &#39;personalized&#39; resource representations (which I  \n&gt; think you should try to avoid if possible, to facilitate caching) is  \n&gt; there any architectural difference between using HTTP auth and &quot;vary:  \n&gt; authorization&quot; or a cookie and &quot;vary: cookie&quot;?\n\nAs soon as you have per user resources on the server side then you\nhave resources that can&#39;t be cached.\n\nUsing cookies at least gives you the chance of using client side code\nto vary what is presented to the user without changing the\nrepresentation for everyone. Clearly, this only works for small\namounts of variable data. The contents of a shopping basket, or some\nuser details for example.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
