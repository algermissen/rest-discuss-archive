What does\n&gt;&gt; a particular form of link mean? Ie. what does it imply about the\n&gt;&gt; operations you can expect to be able to perform on the target of\n&gt;&gt; the link? These are the things that a client has to know in order\n&gt;&gt; to operate a REST service.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The structure of URIs, in contrast, is a server implementation\n&gt;&gt; detail that the client neither need nor should care about.\n&gt;\n&gt; (I know I&#39;m going to regret asking this, but it&#39;s been bothering me for so\n&gt; long that I have to ask it.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the concept of (promiscuous) bookmarking means that the client\n&gt; effectively does care (or at least becomes dependent upon) the structure of\n&gt; URIs.\n\nWhy ? The client becomes dependant on the URI ... but not the\nstructure .. I bookmark the URI, not assume a template from it. The\nonly case of promiscuous bookmarking of a template I can think of is\nthe use of search engines in browsers.\n\n&gt; What&#39;s been bothering me for a long time is that I think there is a\n&gt; fundamental tension between REST&#39;s concept of &quot;bookmarks as limited set of\n&gt; entry points&quot; and the Web&#39;s concept of &quot;URIs for everything&quot;.\n&gt; When I read some of the posts in this list, including those by Roy Fielding\n&gt; himself, I sometimes get the sense that &quot;entry point&quot; URIs should be kept to\n&gt; a bare minimum in order to minimize the &quot;dependency surface area&quot; between\n&gt; clients and servers. For example, Roy made this comment about bookmarks:\n&gt; &quot;REST is limited to the client being told what to do next by the current\n&gt; state of where they are now, aside from the entry point(s) we call a\n&gt; bookmark.&quot;\n\nMy view is that bookmarking templates is fine as long as it is limited\nto a few important starting points (like a search engine).\n\n&gt; In other words, bookmarks are an aside -- only a relative handful of URIs\n&gt; should be &quot;bookmarked&quot; by clients. But isn&#39;t one of the core principles of\n\nAnd this handful could contain a template too ...\n\nBottom line .. bookmarking should be limited - whether thats template\nor URI itself.\n\n&gt; the Web the idea that any URI should be bookmarkable and that bookmarking is\n&gt; to be encouraged? And remember, bookmarking doesn&#39;t just mean putting the\n&gt; URI into a list of favorites in a browser. It also means the client\n&gt; embedding that URI into a representation that it passes along to some other\n&gt; client. Sometimes the REST talk of URI &quot;entry points&quot; seems like an implicit\n&gt; rejection of deep linking, ie forbidding linking to any site page other than\n&gt; a site&#39;s main or home page. And a rejection of deep linking is fundamentally\n&gt; at odds with the core principles of the Web.\n\nYeah .. I have noticed this too .. I don&#39;t have an answer to this --\nit does look like it is against the concept of deep linking.\n\nI think (in a wild guess) , that you can deep link inside a website,\nto the start of an application/transaction - but not deep link inside\nit somewhere (as I said this is very crude and I don&#39;t know the answer\n)\n\n&gt; If promiscuous bookmarking is indeed encouraged by the Web (and by REST),\n&gt; then a well designed system must assume that any URI that appears in any\n&gt; representation it returns could someday be used as an &quot;entry point&quot;. In\n&gt; which case the system must assume that the world of clients is potentially\n&gt; dependent on the entire structure of its initial &quot;network&quot; of  URIs -- not\n&gt; just a handful of designated &quot;entry point&quot; URIs. In other words the ratio of\n&gt; bookmarked (entry point) URIs to all the URIs returned in representations\n&gt; isn&#39;t extremely small, its potentially one-to-one.\n&gt; To put it another way, what&#39;s the difference in the degree or nature of the\n&gt; dependency, from the server&#39;s POV, between:\n&gt;\n&gt; The entire set of URIs it has ever returned in representations being\n&gt; bookmarked by clients and then used later as entry points; and\n&gt; Clients generating such entry-point URIs via URI templates and a scripting\n&gt; language\n&gt;\n&gt; Conceptually the difference is that (2) can generate novel URIs that were\n&gt; never returned in any representation. For example, a geospatial system could\n&gt; have returned millions of lat/long URIs in various representations over the\n&gt; years, but never returned one with the specific lat/long that a client\n&gt; script generates, eg no one had ever asked about THAT part of the Pacific\n&gt; yet.\n\nI think , the server should encourage people to bookmark only a\nparticular set of URIs. A (not good) example is how blogs require you\nto permalink instead of the page you are viewing . If the user doesn&#39;t\nfollow what the server asked it to do, then he/she would end up in a\nmess (which won&#39;t be server&#39;s fault).\n\n\n\n&gt; But pragmatically there seems to me to be no difference at all. In other\n&gt; words, the idea that one can substantially reduce the dependencies between\n&gt; clients and servers by returning a network of URIs in representations\n&gt; (HATEOAS) instead of explicitly documenting the URI templates that could\n&gt; generate them, seems only to work if one prohibits or at least discourages\n&gt; promiscuous bookmarking of URIs, ie prohibits deep linking by REST clients.\n&gt; This is why I think the structure of URIs IS important and the use of URI\n&gt; templates is NOT suspect. Do others see this as a tension as well, or I am\n&gt; just misunderstanding something?\n&gt;\n\nI think I am also misunderstanding things .. we need Roy here I think :)\n\nBut I do see the tension!\n\nCheers\nDevdata\n\n"}}
