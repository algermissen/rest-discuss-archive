I really like this part:\n&gt; &quot;a critical point is that the choreography application model requires \n&gt; that implementation details (the business process rules) be exposed \n&gt; as part of the interface. This will make them very brittle should \n&gt; they need to change, as well as drastically increasing the \n&gt; coordination costs of implementing a multi-party process (since the \n&gt; more parties that are in the process, the more agreement that will \n&gt; need to be made). By keeping process implementation details hidden \n&gt; behind the interface, none of those problems exist.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, in UN/CEFACT we have proposed as a hypothesis that all \n&gt; multi-party business scenarios can be decomposed into sets of two-\n&gt; party interactions with all coordination activities being the \n&gt; *internal* responsibility of any party with dependent commitments \n&gt; with multiple other parties.\n\nI&#39;m confident that a large number of scenarios can be so reduced, but\nI&#39;m not sure that all can.  For example, scenarios with fan-out\n(pub/sub) or fan-in (multi-party rendezvous).  But perhaps you mean that\neven fan-* can be abstracted as a two-party scenario, which is possible\nsince some party (likely third party) has to take responsibility for\nproviding the fan-in or fan-out point.  Have to think on that one ...\n\nI agree with all your other observations too.\n\nBTW, I meant to mention this in the paper;\n\nhttp://www.ebpml.org/bpel4ws.htm\n\nwhich I don&#39;t agree with completely, but it has some good observations,\nincluding;\n\n&#39;However, &quot;BeePEL&quot; authors do not yet understand the concepts of &quot;Business Transactions&quot; and its necessity for business state alignment. They keep talking about callbacks and shy away from assembling messages into meaningful transactions which when successful guarantee state alignment: [...]&#39;\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
