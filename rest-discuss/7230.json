If the seller is not the Web-app but an actor (independent process) then the Web app is responsible for coordinating both (as eBay does for sellers and bidders or Amazon with non-Amazon sellers and buyers).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Does that idea require a 3rd party for automated buyers and automated\n&gt;sellers to do business?\n&gt;\n&gt;(I agree that a 3rd party is almost a necessity to coordinate\n&gt;multi-party interactions like auctions, but I&#39;m still thinking 2-party\n&gt;interaction.)\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that&#39;s too much to require.  I think some 2-phase commit\n&gt;transaction protocols figured out how to pass the coordinator role\n&gt;back and forth between agents. \n\nThat is a very good point. Passing the coordinator role would mean both peers have to be clients and servers running the same web app (each one running the portion of the app that corresponds to its role). The state that is transferred back and force not only puts the client component(s) in a certain state, it is also used to align the two running web apps. That&#39;s mind blowing - need to chew on that one. Seems to bear interesting possibilities regarding process alignment and from there on to distributed transactions.\n\n&quot;State alignment transactions&quot; come to mind.\n\nWonder at what point this is breaking REST....?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJan\n\n(Will search for reference when I get\n&gt;time.)  I suspect REST can do likewise.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But as I said, this needs to be cooked.\n&gt;\n&gt;For sure.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
