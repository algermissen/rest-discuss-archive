This is \nexacerbated if the invocation is going across the internet.\n\nIn that situation, it is usually considered very poor design to hold a \ntransaction and tie up the resources on the back end.\n\nBetter bet is to keep the granularity of your REST (or WS) calls coarse \nenough that the transaction is handled entirely by the back end.\n\nIt points to your colleage thinking of the world in local RPC terms.  That \ndoesn&#39;t fly very well in a distributed system.  You might want to point him \nat the Fallacies of Distributed Computing  (from Peter Deustch, extended by \nJames Gosling):\n\n1) The network is reliable.\n2) Latency is zero.\n3) Bandwidth is infinite.\n4) The network is secure.\n5) Topology doesn&#39;t change.\n6) There is one administrator.\n7) Transport cost is zero.\n8) The network is homogeneous.\n\n\nIn other words, wrt REST: it&#39;s a feature, not a bug! ;-)\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
