PUT is a PUT is a PUT, and DELETE is a DELETE is a DELETE -- \ntheir semantics must not vary by resource or we&#39;ll be in for a world of \nhurt. (POST, of course, being the well defined exception to the above by \ndesign.) The heart of the matter is really one of providing a /uniform \ninterface/ for web resources... an interface that has a well defined \nsemantics for methods, independant of the resources they are applied to.\n\nYannick Loiseau queries:\n\n&gt; [...] resources as distributed objects. Doest it make sens ?\n\nPlease refer to Dan Connollys&#39; editorial of 13 February, 1997, in Web \nApps Magazine:\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/9703-web-apps-essay.html&gt;\n\n    /&quot;I must take this opportunity to dispell a myth that is all to\n    pervasive in the scientific and product literature surrounding the\n    Web: that distributed objects are something that can be, or some day\n    will be, /added to/ the Web. Distributed objects are the very heart\n    of the Web, and have been since its invention. [...]&quot;/\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, the notion of resources as distributed \nobjects makes sense. Moreover, it not only makes sense, it is the whole \npoint...\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\n"}}
