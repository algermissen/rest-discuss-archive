The specification of mediatypes and link semantics tell the  \nclient implementor what to look for in responses and what HTTP calls  \nto make on which resources.\n\nIf the media type you are using does not have the necessary semantics  \n(e.g. application/xml or application/json do not, while application/ \natomsrv does) you cannot convey the necessary semantics to the client.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; plus when I delete an order from Amazon is it doing a http DELETE  \n&gt; operation with the link directly or is it doing a http POST on a  \n&gt; button action which is then interpreted as a http DELETE on the  \n&gt; server and forward to the service...\n&gt;\n\nThe use of POST partly has to do with browser capabilities and with  \nthe collaboration style. Canceling an order is more than just deleting  \nthe order resource. Such things are better done with POSTs and  \nexplicit documents (e.g. order cancelation).\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ollie Riches\n&gt; RBS Global Banking & Markets\n&gt; Office: +44 203 361 4071\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jan Algermissen [mailto:algermissen1971@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 September 2009 14:48\n&gt; To: RICHES, Oliver, GBM\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Re: REST exposing supported operations...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ollie,\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 21, 2009, at 3:33 PM, Ollie wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For some of the resources I&#39;m working with don&#39;t have a method\n&gt;&gt; &#92;operation that maps on to PUT, POST, DELETE\n&gt;\n&gt; Think differently: design your resources in a way that you can  \n&gt; achive the goals with the uniform interface (GET,PUT,POST,DELETE).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if I&#39;m using HTTP as the transport.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bbzzzz - sorry, this rings the buzzer :-) You have to make sure you  \n&gt; understand that HTTP is not a transport protocol but an application  \n&gt; protocol.
