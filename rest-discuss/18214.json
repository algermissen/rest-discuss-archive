REST is concerned with the\n&gt; communication between components on the network.\n\nExactly. REST gives you nothing in terms of what to do with the data once it \nhas been communicated from the server to the client. Neither is that the \npurpose of REST - I am not saying that REST is wrong, I am not saying it \nshould be changed. Roy is rather precise on what REST is - I am not \nquestioning that! What I am looking for is a set of guidelines that would \nwork on the level above REST, giving people best practices for making APIs \nthat are 1) REST, and 2) agrees upon very few ways to work with the data.\n\nAs it is today, people (okay, me at least) turns to REST for all the \ngoodness it is supposed to bring. Only to discover that once they have \ndecided on their resources they are left without guidelines for how to \nencode them. That&#39;s not part of REST, and it should not be part of REST. But \nthe end result is that we get a myriade of different encoding solutions - \nall trying to map their specific problem domain to a media type, and doing \nit their own way.\n\nSo, again: maybe its time for a REST-Interop guide that speaks about how to \nrepresent specific problem domains for M2M scenarios.\n\n/J�rn \n\n\n"}}
