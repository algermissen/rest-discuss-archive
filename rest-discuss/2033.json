I&#39;ve thought about this, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; never found any method to actually implement this; is there something\n&gt; I should know about browsers?\n\nNo, you&#39;re right. I was talking about more of a machine-to-machine\nscenario. PUT and DELETE are holes in current Web specifications. HTML\nwas defined before recent versions of HTTP and has not caught up. XForms\nsupports PUT which means that XHTML 2.0 will support PUT. I thought we&#39;d\nget pushback on DELETE so I didn&#39;t push the issue for the current\nversion of XForms. They think of their job as generating XML documents\nso getting GET support was a fight already. DELETE might be beyond the\npale.\n\nAlso, you could say that PUT and DELETE are supported in some &quot;browsers&quot;\ninsofar as they support WebDAV. It&#39;s just hard (impossible?) to get at\nthat functionality from HTML. I agree that&#39;s a problem and it would be\ngreat if you decided to make it your personal cause to fix it. ;)\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; How do I code the HTML A:href to evoke a PUT or DELETE out of Mozilla\n&gt; and MSIE?  Even if the method is possible and simple, I think there is\n&gt; your answer: I&#39;ve used web browsers and built websites for almost a\n&gt; decade, and _I_ don&#39;t know, so I&#39;d hardly expect the average\n&gt; 2yr-experienced webservices designer to know the distinction even\n&gt; exists.\n\nSure, that&#39;s a problem. My point to Sam is that people who do know the\ndistinction should not avoid them for the reasons he describes. Avoiding\nthem because of browser (or server!) limitations is one thing. Avoiding\nthem because of ignorance is another thing. But Sam seemed to think we\nshould avoid them for global consistency reasons as you might in a\nrelational database. But the methods are inherently mediated on the Web\nso you can implement whatever consistency fixups you need in the\nhandling for the methods.\n-- \nXML, Web Services Architecture, REST Architectural Style\nConsulting, training, programming: http://www.constantrevolution.com\nCome discuss XML and REST web services at the Extreme Markup Conference\n\n"}}
