In concrete terms, &quot;when you GET a representation of a resource,\n&gt;&gt;should that representation include a description of the operations\n&gt;&gt;the resource supports?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s not what I am asking.  Rephrased:\n&gt;\n&gt;Is the *ability* to perform a GET against a resource part of that resource?\n&gt;\n\nIs that the same as &#39;Is the ability to respond to a GET request  part of \nthe resource?&#39;\n\n&gt;Is the response itself (not just the body) part of that resource?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAre the words that are used to describe an idea part of the idea?\n\nI&#39;m not sure how to determine the answer to your question.  My instinct \nis to say that the HTTP stuff is not part of the resource, but at this \npoint, I&#39;m not sure how I would defend that statement (give me a while \nand I might come up with something).\n\n\n&gt;or\n&gt;\n&gt;Can a resource be accessible through HTTP and still not have any aspect of\n&gt;HTTP be part of itself?\n&gt;\n&gt;In concrete terms, suppose there is a text file (content-type: text/plain).\n&gt;It exists, but is not accessible (limited to the discussion of HTTP).  It is\n&gt;resource R.  Now, we make that text file available via HTTP at URI_A.  I can\n&gt;issue a GET on URI and get back a representation of that text file.  Is it\n&gt;still resource R or is it now resource R&#39;, where the ability to perform a\n&gt;GET on it and to get back a representation (plus HTTP headers, etc) are also\n&gt;part of the resource?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nA couple of points.\n\nI seem to remember something somewhere talking about how resources may \nbe composed of other resources (which is what I think your example \ndescribes).  I think in your example, you have identified two resources \n- one that is accessible via HTTP (R&#39;) and one that is not (R).  The one \naccessible via HTTP (R&#39;) is composed of another resource (R) that is not \naccessible via HTTP. (Either that or you have a resource that is \naccessible via two different mechanisms - your definition doesnt give \nenough detail for me to know which is the case.)\n\nThe second point is that a GET on R&#39; by definition returns a \nrepresentation of R&#39;, not R.  It may happen that the representations of \nthe two resources are the same, but that doesnt change what you call the \nresults of a GET on R&#39;.  How a resource&#39;s representations are produced \n(e.g., retrieve from file or from database) is an implementation detail, \nand I wouldn&#39;t normally consider that detail to be relevant to the \ndefinition of the resource (although I&#39;m sure there are resources where \nthat detail is relevant).\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
