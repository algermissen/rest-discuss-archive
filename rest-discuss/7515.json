I&#39;m a bit of a newbie too but let me take a stab at this as an\nexerci=\r\nse. \n\nNow let me first say that the way you posed the question is very\n&quot;obj=\r\necty&quot; or &quot;servicey&quot; to begin with and makes it a bit hard to\nanswer. You&#39;ve=\r\n basically said &quot;I have a service with methods A, B, and\nC; how do I make i=\r\nt resource based?&quot; The problem is that REST has no\nconcept of class-specifi=\r\nc methods, so without knowing what A, B, and C\ndo, its hard to answer your =\r\nquestion. In short, there is no straight\nforward transformation of an abstr=\r\nact service to abstract resources.\n(At least not that I know of...) They ar=\r\ne two very different ways of\nmodeling the interface. I can&#39;t transform one =\r\ntype of solution to\nanother without understanding the problem.\n\nBut I can i=\r\nnfer a bit about the problem from the fact you are using\nthe concept of a p=\r\nerson and things a person can do (eat, sleep, work).\nI&#39;ll assume here that =\r\nsleep() and work() change the state of the\nperson (to sleeping and working =\r\nrespectively). Maybe there is a\nsubstate when working that says what work y=\r\nou are doing. Let&#39;s also\nassume that eat() adds some food items to a list o=\r\nf things eaten.\n\nSo to work (on building a bike shed):\nPUT /person/ittay/cu=\r\nrrentactivity\nContent-Type: application/x-activity+xml\n\n&lt;activity&gt;\n  &lt;type&gt;=\r\nwork&lt;/type&gt;\n  &lt;sub-type&gt;building a bike shed&lt;/sub-type&gt;\n&lt;/activity&gt;\n\nTo sle=\r\nep:\nPUT /person/ittay/currentactivity\nContent-Type: application/x-activity+=\r\nxml\n\n&lt;activity&gt;\n  &lt;type&gt;sleep&lt;/type&gt;\n&lt;/activity&gt;\n\nTo eat an apple:\nPOST /pe=\r\nrson/ittay/stomach\nContent-type: application/x-food+xml\n\n&lt;food&gt;apple&lt;/food&gt;=\r\n\n\nNow these actions could also kick off related business processes. I\nthink=\r\n the only method that can&#39;t is GET. Note that you could use get\nto retrieve=\r\n the current activity from /person/ittay/currentactivity or\nthe list of thi=\r\nngs eaten from /person/ittay/stomach.\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Ittay Dror &lt;ittayd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks for your example and site refer=\r\nence.\n&gt; \n&gt; i did know that i use only HTTP methods, what i lacked is how to=\r\n\nmodel my business methods. i am a newbie at this (maybe i should have\nindi=\r\ncated that)\n&gt; \n&gt; may i impose with a followup?\n&gt; \n&gt; say i have a person ent=\r\nity in my application. this entity has\nseveral business methods (eat, sleep=\r\n, work). how should i model a rest\napi for these? create a PersonManager re=\r\nsource (which then will need\nto accept as argument what action to do), or c=\r\nreate resources per\naction (/person/ittay/eat maybe?). \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; itta=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ittay,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; the kind of question =\r\nyou ask indicates that you have no yet\nunderstood a fundamental aspect of R=\r\nEST, namely that there is a\nuniform interface. You do not get any other met=\r\nhods as the uniform set\n(the HTTP methods in the case of using HTTP as an a=\r\nrchitecture)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without any intention to be rude, I suggest you take =\r\na while to\nread through some of the REST material out on the Web (the REST =\r\nwiki\nat http://rest.blueoxen.net is a good starting point as is Paul&#39;s site=\r\n\nat http://prescod.com/rest ). This will help in future discussions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Should I use &#39;POST&#39; with a &#39;method=3Dbuild&#39; parameter to the &#39;plan=\r\n&#39;\nURI?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No, this is about the worst from a REST POV as it is hidden=\r\n RPC.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Think along these lines:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Provide a means for client=\r\ns to pick a resource that behaves the\nway they are interested in (some hype=\r\nrmedia the clients come accross\ncould declare a resource as a BuildingManag=\r\ner) and then use POST to\nsubmit the building plan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; POST /BuildingM=\r\nanager\n&gt; &gt; Content-Type: application/blueprint          &lt;-- this type is\nfi=\r\nctous; it would need to be standardized within the realm of your system\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &lt;blueprint&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;wall location=3D&quot;....&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/blueprint&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; IOW, in a RESTful system clients late-bind to resources based on\nrunt=\r\nime-declared abstract bahavior of those resources and they\ncommunicate via =\r\na fixed set of methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HTH,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jan \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ittay\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yahoo!
