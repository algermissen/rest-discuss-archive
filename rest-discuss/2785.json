A REST developer who\n&gt; *really* got it would call them like they are: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.\n&gt; And that same developer would know that SOAP was irrelevant.\n\nAll other arguments aside, I strongly disagree that a REST developer would\nonly get it right if they were to use HTTP verbs.  HTTP verbs have specific,\nlimited meanings that are not necessarily a good match with the Groove Web\nServices.  It is just as RESTful to create ones own set of verbs that\nactually provide the exact functionality needed.  While I admit that HTTP\n(and its verbs) is fairly prolific, it is not the &quot;be all, end all&quot; of web\nprotocols.  While HTTP is RESTful, not all things RESTful are HTTP.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
