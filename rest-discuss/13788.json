It should be location-less, or in IT words &quot;shared&quot;. Se=\r\ncond, a resource may have all the URIs you want, or that it needs, that is =\r\nnot a restriction.\n\nThird, I plenty support that resources are locatable an=\r\nd accessible by any node in a network, and REST is for networking systems, =\r\nso I don&#39;t see why is there a restriction for servers to be clients.\n\nNow, =\r\nas FOREST to be a pattern and not an style, means it is applicable to tacti=\r\nc design. That means it is local, and thus may not be applicable to the who=\r\nle system. In fact, as you actually go into details of implementation, it I=\r\nS a pattern.\n\nWhat I mean is that your REST applications may contain parts =\r\nimplemented using FOREST and others using other patterns. Thus, you need:\n1=\r\n. Identify the context where your pattern can be used (as the title suggest=\r\n, cases where we need integration may be).\n2. Identify the particular probl=\r\nem it is solving.\n3. You already defined the solution, even getting down to=\r\n propose implementation.\n4. List the consequences of applying it.\n\nWill rea=\r\nd it again, trying to understand each bit.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez\n\n\n---=\r\n In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;duncan_b_cragg&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve expanded a little on the motivation behind FOREST in this =\r\nblog post:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/forest-get-only-rest-inte=\r\ngration-pattern/\n&gt; \n&gt; Duncan Cragg\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
