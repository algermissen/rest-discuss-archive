Cross site GETs can \nhave serious resource usage consequences, up to and including DDOS \nattacks.  Though I understand why they might not want to tackle that, it \nwould be awfully nice if a server could simply specify (to a compliant \nUA) which sets of resources are available for cross-site requests and \nwhich are not.  As long as we&#39;re changing browser code anyway we might \nas well go for it.  And this would handle all methods in one efficient \nmechanism.)\n\nBut yes, having to do two requests for each POST/PUT/DELETE is a major \nproblem for protocols such as AtomPub / GData.

I believe the WG&#39;s current proposal puts REST\n&gt; designs at a significant disadvantage. The Working Group will be\n&gt; taking up this issue in its weekly teleconference this Wednesday and I\n&gt; hope feedback from the members of this mailing list might help\n&gt; communicate the importance of this issue for web developers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently, the Same Origin Policy limits the ways in which a web page\n&gt; served by one site, Site A, can communicate with resources hosted on a\n&gt; separate site, Site B. The WG aims to provide a way for Site B and the\n&gt; browser to agree on a loosening of these restrictions. For example,\n&gt; given the consent of Site B, the browser would allow a page from Site\n&gt; A to receive the response to a GET request on a resource hosted by\n&gt; Site B. Similarly, the page from Site A would be allowed to send an\n&gt; arbitrary POST to a resource hosted by Site B and receive the\n&gt; response.\n&gt;\n&gt; Essentially, the WG&#39;s current proposal is for the server to express a\n&gt; cross-domain request policy (XDRP) for each hosted resource. Before\n&gt; sending a cross-domain, non-GET request to a particular resource, the\n&gt; web browser must query that resource&#39;s XDRP and enforce any expressed\n&gt; constraints. For more detail, please refer to the the WG&#39;s current\n&gt; draft proposal &lt;http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the problems with this design is that there is a mandatory\n&gt; network round-trip to fetch the XDRP for a resource before the browser\n&gt; can begin communicating with that resource. Essentially, there&#39;s a one\n&gt; network round-trip penalty for each distinct URI a web application\n&gt; uses. For example, consider the effect of this design on a mashup that\n&gt; uses the ATOM protocol to communicate with another site. When creating\n&gt; a new member resource, the server sends the client a distinct URI\n&gt; identifying the resource. In essence, the server is saying: &quot;Send your\n&gt; updates here&quot;. But before sending a PUT request to the specified URL,\n&gt; the mashup application must first send a request for the XDRP, in\n&gt; effect asking permission to use the resource it was just told to use.\n&gt; The same happens for each distinct URL the client uses. The result is\n&gt; a tragically comical network protocol in which the client repeatedly\n&gt; asks permission to do what the server just told the client it could\n&gt; do.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve pointed out this problem to the WG and the response from one of\n&gt; the main contributors to the specification was:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ian Hickson wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; I do not believe that we should change the API to optimise for the one\n&gt;&gt; case of an API that involves a lot of non-GET requests to unique\n&gt;&gt; resources. It is trivial to optimise the server&#39;s protocol in\n&gt;&gt; this case\n&gt;&gt; anyway (just use one URI and put the parameters in the body), and this\n&gt;&gt; more closely matches what most people will be doing anyway.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; See: &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Jan/0297.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Members of this mailing list may see a similarity between this\n&gt; proposed design advice and the long-ago discussions about the design\n&gt; of SOAP where requests are all sent to a single URL and the actual\n&gt; target resource is identified by arguments in the message body.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also pointed out that this design advice discourages use of URIs,\n&gt; whereas webarch encourages use of URIs.

Under the WG&#39;s current proposal, these designs will be penalized\n&gt; with a network round-trip for each distinct URI. The proposal&#39;s main\n&gt; designer dismisses this design style. The WG&#39;s editor sees this issue\n&gt; as only a &quot;quibble&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt; See: &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Jan/0306.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark Nottingham and I have proposed an alternate design for\n&gt; cross-domain requests that does not have these performance problems\n&gt; and negative design pressures. Essentially, the alternate proposal\n&gt; asks the host, instead of each resource, if it is willing to accept\n&gt; cross-domain requests. If so, these requests are then so labeled, in\n&gt; the same way as the WG currently proposes. The task of enforcing a\n&gt; per-resource policy is then managed solely by the host. Under such a\n&gt; design, there is one network round-trip before requests begin to flow,\n&gt; but it is one round-trip per host, not per resource. This way there is\n&gt; no penalty for heavy use of URIs. To date, the WG has rejected\n&gt; pursuing such a design.\n&gt;\n&gt; This design discussion is also taking place under the time pressure of\n&gt; the Firefox 3 release, which plans to implement the WG&#39;s current\n&gt; proposal.
