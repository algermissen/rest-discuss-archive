Hypermedia controls can be very easily expressed in the media types themselves (just as HTML does for &lt;a&gt; &lt;img&gt; or &lt;form&gt;). Why would you add WADL top HTML for example?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, May 26, 2010 at 1:29 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On May 26, 2010, at 10:11 PM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What if we arranged it &quot;off site&quot; where you wouldn&#39;t need attendance.
