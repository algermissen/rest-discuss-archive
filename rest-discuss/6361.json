But all were agreed that REST \n&gt; itself doesn&#39;t suggest one or the other approach, as long as \n&gt; client code is not hard-coded with knowledge of any chosen \n&gt; structure. So it&#39;s just a matter of human understanding. My \n&gt; own preference is for &lt;/sites/&gt; (including trailing slash) \n&gt; and &lt;/sites/2&gt; (using the plural), treating &quot;sites&quot; as a kind \n&gt; of virtual folder. The implementation approach I use lets me \n&gt; differentiate those however I want, so they are separate \n&gt; &quot;pages&quot; regardless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Justin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/1/06, Scott Chapman &lt;scott_list@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m considering making different URL&#39;s for retrieval of a \n&gt; list of sites vs.\n&gt; &gt; one site (sites are actual locations on the ground in my scenario):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; List of sites: http://www.../sites?name1=value1&name2=value2\n&gt; &gt; Single site: http://www.../site/2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this considered Ok for good REST development or should \n&gt; the &quot;sites&quot; \n&gt; &gt; (plural) URL be used in all cases?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am considering this because the implementation on the server side \n&gt; &gt; would be cleaner, having separate &quot;pages&quot; for list vs. single site \n&gt; &gt; returns. I&#39;d like to know what people think of this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to RESTful design. Please let me know what the \n&gt; pro&#39;s and con&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; are of doing it this way from a design perspective.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; Scott\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
