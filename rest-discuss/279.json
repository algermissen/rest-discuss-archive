According to (1), a typical test\n&gt; Apache server can handle ~250 requests per second.\n&gt; Assuming your clients poll once per second, you\n&gt; max out at 250 simulatenous clients.  That sucks!\n[..]\n&gt; (1) http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/benchmarks.html\n\nErr, that&#39;s hits per second, not concurrent connections. You&#39;re using\na benchmark of Apache by an Apache competitor as an indication of how\nall Web servers perform in general? Tsk. It&#39;s widely acknowledged\nthat Apache is performance-limited, in a trade-off for stability,\ndevelopability, etc.\n\nLet me be more explicit: I know of at least two vendors who have HTTP\nimplementations that can handle 50,000+ concurrent persistent\nconnections on commodity hardware. \n\nIt&#39;s much more instructive to look at intermediary implementations\nwhen you&#39;re talking about the performance overhead of HTTP; they&#39;re\nmore optimised for performance, and they&#39;re not doing anything with\nthe payload; it&#39;s all just overhead. It&#39;s relatively easy to achieve\n1000+ reqs/sec [1]. Most modern HTTP intermediaries can approach or\nexceed wire speed.\n\nI&#39;d note that these numbers don&#39;t include any of the larger\ncommercial vendors (with more developed implementations) who\nparticipated in past years, but now don&#39;t want their numbers made\npublic, as it starts a performance war...\n\n\n[1] http://www.measurement-factory.com/results/public/cacheoff/N04/raw.html\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
