That is the essential\n&gt; difference between forcing the server to implement isolation versus\n&gt; letting the server figure it out how to implement its own resources.\n\nI understand.  I don&#39;t think I was advocating such a draconian attitude, \nbut I do get your point.\n\n&gt;&gt; the same resource via the same URI (where one was outside of a\n&gt;&gt; transaction and the other was inside the transaction) didn&#39;t fit my\n&gt;&gt; understanding resource state.  Am I just misunderstanding it all?  For\n&gt;&gt; instance, is it enough for a server to return  a response that includes\n&gt;&gt; something like the following headers for a GET request within the\n&gt;&gt; context of the transaction?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vary: X-Transaction-URI\n&gt;&gt; X-Transaction-URI: http://example.com/t/123\n&gt;\n&gt; If the state of the resource is not isolated, then there is no need.\n&gt; If they are isolated, then all of the within-transaction responses\n&gt; will have to be marked as cache-control private or no-cache.\n&gt;\nOkay, I have missed something along the way here.  Using the same URI \nfor a resource, how can a resource be kept from &quot;isolation&quot; and still be \nwithin a transaction?  If this has been spelled out already, just point \nme to the post.\n\n&gt; Please, never prefix a header with &quot;X-&quot;.\n\nI realize this is off topic, but why?  Am I supposed to use &quot;x.&quot; or \nsomething else instead?  I realize that HTTP isn&#39;t actually using MIME, \nbut I thought the same general approach was used.  Can you point me to a \nmore appropriate RFC on how this *should* be done?\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
