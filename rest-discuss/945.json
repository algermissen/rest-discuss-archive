So it does a GET on that URI and retrieves some RDF asserting \nthat\n&gt; it is of type http://stds.org/product.  company2 knows this means \nthat\n&gt; it can submit an offer document to that URI, so it puts one \ntogether and\n&gt; POSTs it there.  company1&#39;s software receives the offer, and can do\n&gt; one of two things;\n&gt; \n&gt; - respond with an &quot;Acceptance&quot; document immediately\n\nEasy.\n\n&gt; - respond with an &quot;Ack&quot; document, which includes a URI that refers\n&gt; to the Acceptance or Rejection document in the future.\n\nThe more interesting case...\n\n&gt; How&#39;s that?\n\nVery simple.  Want to keep going?  I&#39;m interested to find out if this \nsimple plan will run into trouble in the next user stories.\n\nIf so, may I change the names from Company1 and Company2 to Seller \nand Buyer?  (Did I assign them correctly? I&#39;ll get confused \notherwise.)  \n\n\nOk, so we got:\nhttp://seller.com/thing\n\n-To which URI the Buyer POSTs an offer to buy (i.e. Purchase Order).\n\nAnd I&#39;ll focus on the case where the Seller responds to the Buyer \nwith an &quot;Ack&quot; document including a URI referring to an Acceptance or \nRejection document in the future.  Which the Buyer will check in the \nfuture.  All the documents except the &quot;Ack&quot; are in the control of the \nSeller.\n\nSorry if this is tedious, but if I rephrase, it may tell you if I \nunderstand or not.  Did I?\n\nOk, then, next complication:  the offer to buy should not be good \nforever, it should have a time constraint.  At the appointed time, \nthe Buyer could check the URI for the Acceptance or Rejection \ndocument and if it&#39;s not there, the deal is off.  How would you \nhandle that?  We want it to be clear to both parties that the deal is \noff, so they don&#39;t end up in court because the Seller tried to keep \ngoing.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
