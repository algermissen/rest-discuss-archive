I don&#39;t see a reason for an additional\n&gt; con=\r\nstraint unless you make that property a requirement.\n&gt; \n\nNo, REST requires =\r\na registry for self-descriptiveness, but does not\nrequire a central registr=\r\ny.  A distributed registry would merely assign\ndifferent syntax to differen=\r\nt authorities, i.e. &#39;schema/foo&#39; would be\nhandled by a different registrati=\r\non authority from IANA and the existing\nsyntax.  No collisions and (properl=\r\ny managed) no splitting, means\nsender intent is clearly and unambiguously d=\r\neclared, which is the point:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect\n\n=\r\nBy self-defining, I mean something like &#39;Content-Type: http://example.\norg/=\r\nfoo&#39; where the identifier becomes a first-class object.  That\napproach come=\r\ns with all the drawbacks Nathan and Mark mentioned, with\nnone of the benefi=\r\nts of having a registry; the difference is one of\nbeing self-descriptive or=\r\n NOT being self-descriptive, as explained:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/rest-discuss/message/16638\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2008/02/media-t=\r\nype-centralization-is-a-feature-not-a-bug/\n\nObviously, some other term is n=\r\needed to define what folks are trying to\noverload self-descriptive to mean,=\r\n because self-descriptive =3D registered\netc. *exactly* as Roy clarified, n=\r\not discoverable by URI (ad-hoc\nidentifiers are the opposite of self-descrip=\r\ntive as defined by the\nthesis, even without Roy&#39;s clarification, as I expla=\r\nined thoroughly\nwith my Gopher examples -- it&#39;s fundamental to the differen=\r\nce between a\n(REST) network-based API and a (NOT REST) library-based API, a=\r\nnd as\n*proof* of my position I just need to point to the specs which all\nst=\r\nate that we&#39;re dealing with MIME and that MIME involves a registry,\nnot fir=\r\nst-class objects as identifiers.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, from what I can tell, the on=\r\nly view point that requires an\n&gt; additional constraint is yours i.e. a &quot;non=\r\n-self-defining&quot; constraint.\n&gt;\n\nUhhh, no, Roy has quite clearly defined self=\r\n-descriptive to mean\n*registered*, not searchable-for-in-Google.  Saying so=\r\nmething may be\nunderstood by searching Google for it, is NOT the definition=\r\n of self-\ndescriptiveness.  Exhibit A is application/rss+xml -- anyone can\n=\r\n*discover* that it isn&#39;t self-descriptive of sender intent.  If it were\nreg=\r\nistered, it still wouldn&#39;t be self-descriptive of sender intent, as\nbeing r=\r\negistered is only the *minimum* requirement (and doesn&#39;t even\n_begin_ to be=\r\n optional).  Try arguing against *any* of the examples\nI&#39;ve given, please -=\r\n- it doesn&#39;t do me any good to know that I&#39;m always\nwrong without knowing a=\r\nbout what, or how, I&#39;m wrong.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone else is happy that both approac=\r\nhes establish shared\n&gt; understanding and facilitate self-descriptiveness in=\r\n their own way -\n&gt; and you aren&#39;t.\n&gt; \n\nOh, stop it with that crap already, =\r\nplease, Mike.  The definitions are\nquite clear.  From REST:\n\n&quot;The data form=\r\nat of a representation is known as a media type [48].&quot;\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.=\r\nedu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_2\n\nFrom MIME:=\r\n\n\n&quot;A registration process is needed, however, to ensure that the set of\nsuc=\r\nh values is developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public\nmanner. Thi=\r\ns document defines registration procedures which use the\nInternet Assigned =\r\nNumbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for\nsuch values.&quot;\n\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt\n\nIt is NOT self-descriptive to follow some proce=\r\nss that has nothing to\ndo with what&#39;s defined.  REST says &quot;standardization&quot;=\r\n not &quot;screw the\nRFCs and do it your own way.&quot;  I seriously don&#39;t know what =\r\nelse REST\ncould _possibly_ mean by identifiers which are self-descriptive o=\r\nf\nsender intent to process representations which are defined as MIME\ntypes.=\r\n\n\nNobody is really free to define self-descriptive in their own way such\nth=\r\nat they can merely ignore RFC 2048 and still call it REST.  Give me a\nbreak=\r\n.  REST is not free-form, it is standardized.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Preferring one way for w=\r\nhatever reason is one thing, claiming the\n&gt; other is &quot;not REST&quot; is another =\r\nthing entirely.\n&gt; \n\nNot being self-descriptive is NOT REST.  This isn&#39;t abo=\r\nut what I\nprefer, it&#39;s about basic definitions of fundamental concepts.  Th=\r\nere is\na fundamental architectural difference between having a registry (as=\r\n\nREST quite clearly calls for by referring to MIME, as quite clearly\nconfir=\r\nmed by Roy for the common case of the Web), and making identifiers\nfirst-cl=\r\nass objects with URIs (which MIME says nothing about, and REST\nsays nothing=\r\n about using anything besides MIME, and isn&#39;t at all what\nRoy meant by sayi=\r\nng self-descriptive =3D registered).  When you have a\nfundamentally differe=\r\nnt approach from REST, it&#39;s obviously some other\narchitectural style -- unl=\r\ness REST is the only architectural style and\neverything on the Web is encom=\r\npassed by it, which is poppycock.\n\nClaiming that this fundamentally differe=\r\nnt approach, which goes against\neverything REST/Roy/AWWW/RFCs have to say o=\r\nn the matter, comes down to\npreference and that it&#39;s still RESTful either w=\r\nay, is nonsensical unless\nyou can back it up against any of the strong argu=\r\nments that have been\npresented here by myself or others, or explain why Roy=\r\n didn&#39;t really\nmean registered in a registry when he said self-descriptive=\r\n=3Dregistered,\nor why Roy didn&#39;t really mean MIME, or that MIME doesn&#39;t rea=\r\nlly say\nanything about a registry...\n\nIt&#39;s quite rational for me to point o=\r\nut that instead of defining self-\ndescriptive to mean something that it cle=\r\narly was never intended to\nmean, perhaps we should define another term for =\r\nthat meaning, i.e.\nself-defining.  That&#39;s how distributed software architec=\r\nture is\npracticed, by defining what constraints achieve what effects -- usi=\r\nng\nURIs instead of registered identifiers is a whole &#39;nother ball of wax\nwh=\r\nich is incongruous with REST as written or as instantiated by HTTP.\n\nWhile =\r\nit&#39;s fine to speculate about alternative approaches to a\nregistry, don&#39;t lo=\r\nse sight of the fact that REST requires a registry\nfor identifiers and HTTP=\r\n re-uses the MIME-defined IANA central registry\nfor media type identifiers,=\r\n and that this is what self-descriptive\nmeans.  The REST style simply doesn=\r\n&#39;t include using URIs as media type\nidentifiers, any more than the specs al=\r\nlow such usage.  Get over it.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
