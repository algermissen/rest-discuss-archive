Especially when it saves me from  \ninventing a new XML language or using ATOM+simple extensions with its  \noverhead (which I propably do not need in my domain).\n\nIs there an implementations-related &#39;maximum&#39; of HTTP header lines  \nthat serves as a sort of natural boundary for using the HTTP header as  \na domain specific envelope?\n\nDunno, but it just feels odd at times to have the HTTP header and the  \nATOM envelope itself when dealing with ATOM-based implementations. Do  \nI put my Links in the header or in &lt;link&gt; elements...or both?\n\nJan\n\n"}}
