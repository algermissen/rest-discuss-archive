The expectation is the semantics, not the mechanism.  So\n&gt; if there&#39;s a connector semantic called &quot;GET_STOCK_QUOTE&quot; which provides\n&gt; the expectation that when I submit a document which describes an\n&gt; exchange/symbol tuple, any response I get will necessarily be a quote\n&gt; for that stock, then that&#39;s the expectation I&#39;m talking about.   And if\n&gt; that&#39;s what is expected, then a) the semantic isn&#39;t uniform, and b) the\n&gt; non-uniform semantic isn&#39;t made explicit in the message and is therefore\n&gt; not self-descriptive.\n\nI&#39;m confused as to what&#39;s supposed to be self-descriptive, the\nsematics of the service, or merely how to dereference a URI\nbased on hypertext.\n\nFor example, let&#39;s talk about buying books from Amazon. To simplify\nthe case I will assume I have one-click purchasing turned on. What\nhappens then is that with a single POST of x-www-form-urlencoded\ndata I can purchase a book. (In the process at least two new URIs\nare created, one to reflect my purchase and another to track\nthe shipment.)\n\nWere I to POST that same x-www-form-urlencoded data to a different \nserver (google, ebay, etc) I probably wouldn&#39;t purchase a book. \nDoes that imply that to be perfectly RESTful we should have a new\nmethod, &quot;PURCHASE_BOOK&quot;, that carries the sematics of book purchasing\nin a uniform manner? Or does some of the &#39;self descriptive&#39; nature \ncome from the use of HTML and it&#39;s use of forms to describe the\ndata to be sent to a URI that accepts x-www-form-urlencoded data?\n\n\tThanks,\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n"}}
