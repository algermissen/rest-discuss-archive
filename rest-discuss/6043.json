The verb is the &#39;action&#39;. The object is &#39;what&#39;.\n&gt;   \nI like your formulation of subject, verb, and object. I understand that \nthe subject can be a user or a session.\n\nI&#39;m not clear why the subject and object can&#39;t both be represented in \nthe URL. Multiplexed, so to speak. E.g., \nhttp://www.example.com/sessions/29823/buybooks.html, or \nhttp://www.example.com/buybooks.html?session=29823. By naming the \nsubject using a cookie, you render the page uncacheable.\n&gt; This is a valuable conceptualisation as it stands. However, this \n&gt; conceptualisation will lead you to realise that the ideal &#39;subject&#39; is \n&gt; not in fact a &#39;user&#39;. Rather, a &#39;user session&#39; is better. This is \n&gt; because without a &#39;user session&#39; all users who authenticate with your \n&gt; server can only have one session in all time. Alternatively, in order to \n&gt; facilitate &#39;session&#39; you need to indicate the session in the &#39;resource&#39;. \n&gt; This is tantamount to putting a &#39;session context&#39; in the URI, and that \n&gt; is not desirable. (Breaks bookmarks, can lead to insecure URLs which \n&gt; can&#39;t be shared, etc.)\n&gt;   \nIf I send someone a bookmark to \nhttp://www.example.com/sessions/29823/buybooks.html, but they do not \nhave permission to view that session, the server can create a new \nsession (say 33472) and redirect them to \nhttp://www.example.com/sessions/33472/buybooks.html.\n\nOr does that break the GET rule? Perhaps it should redirect them to \nhttp://www.example.com/start.html, from which they can click a button to \nPOST a new session.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
