That is, I cannot assure=\r\n I will get the same server for each request.\n\nSo, the client creates an or=\r\nder, which is then a resource, and it is given an ID for it (ID=3DURI). The=\r\nn, it adds line items. At the end, it can get the order to verify and the s=\r\nerver in turn will send back the header and all lines so far. The client th=\r\nen requests to place the order, which the other server that responds does.\n=\r\n\nAs you can see, no server has a state, and I don&#39;t need to keep sending ba=\r\nck and forth all the data. \n\nNow, per user resources. No, you should not th=\r\nink of a private resource that is temporarily locked by a client. At creati=\r\non, any other client that has the same ID for the order, is able to read it=\r\n.\nIt is not good either, to &quot;reserve&quot; each line in the order for a final co=\r\nmmit. That does not make sense. What you are doing is creating a package, w=\r\nhich will be reserved all at once, in one transaction, in the last request,=\r\n by the server in turn. If it happens one of the goodies is already sold ou=\r\nt, then the server returns an error and that&#39;s it. Simple.\n\nWilliam Martine=\r\nz Pomares\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Alexandros Marinos &lt;al3xgr@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Making that state addressable doesn&#39;t change anything.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The stateless constraint is being violated here because the meaning o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; the message sent when any user hits a &quot;Purchase&quot; button on a page\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n showing an order is &quot;Purchase these line items&quot;, yet the message\n&gt; &gt; conta=\r\nins no information about the line items, only a pointer (URI or\n&gt; &gt; cookie,=\r\n doesn&#39;t matter) to some state held on the server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n what I am reading from this is that a &#39;restful&#39; shopping cart would need\n&gt;=\r\n to send the entire order over at the time of purchase. So for one thing,\n&gt;=\r\n there is no way to progressively reserve items as you find them. (or maybe=\r\n\n&gt; you can reserve them but then you can&#39;t say &#39;buy everything I reserved&#39;)=\r\n.\n&gt; Still this doesnt make transaction-like behaviours impossible. It just\n=\r\n&gt; necessitates that the transaction is specified in one go.\n&gt; \n&gt; However I =\r\nfear this per-user resource thing is much more restrictive than\n&gt; that. If =\r\nI have a user account on a service, is that a per-user resource?\n&gt; What if =\r\nI want to add some preferences to the account? In the worst case I\n&gt; can se=\r\ne, should the entire registration be repeated at every request? Is\n&gt; restfu=\r\nl design therefore completely at odds with having services that store\n&gt; use=\r\nr profiles and allow the users to store things in that profile? So for\n&gt; ex=\r\nample an amazon S3-like service is impossible as storing your files in the\n=\r\n&gt; service is state, and deleting a directory doesn&#39;t give details about the=\r\n\n&gt; files but only a pointer to the directory to be deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alexandros=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
