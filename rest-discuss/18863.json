Simple and useful. I have some comments.\n&gt; I&#39;d change the redaction a bit in section 4.1: &quot;It is an object whose\n&gt; names are link relation types&quot; should be &quot;It is an object whose\n&gt; *property* names are link relation types&quot;. The same thing in 4.2.\n\nthanks, will amend\n\n&gt; Appart for these, I&#39;d remove the &quot;hreflang&quot; link attribute, what if a\n&gt; resource supports several languages? The language stuff seems better\n&gt; addressed using HTTP headers rather than a link attribute.\n\nThis is optional and intended as a &#39;hint&#39; as this is how its defined\nin the Web Linking RFC that&#39;s referenced.\n\nI was actually considering introducing all of the remaining link\nparams introduced by Web Linking - I take it you would be against that\ndecision?\n\n&gt; I&#39;d remove\n&gt; the &quot;self&quot; link since it is redundant. The resource consumer already\n&gt; knows the resource URIs.\n\nThat may be true for the root resource, but not for the embedded\nresources. I think it&#39;s &#39;tidier&#39; to include it for all resource\nobjects as it is consistent and lends itself better to situations\nwhere resources are included as partials within other documents.\n\nCheers,\nM\n\n"}}
