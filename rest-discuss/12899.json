In both cases, the entire URI (fragment \nexcepted) will be used for dereferencing. The distinction between the \ntwo formats is mainly cosmetic and an implementation detail regarding \nhow to dispatch the call on the server side; the client shouldn&#39;t really \ncare since URIs are meant to be opaque (excepted when the hypermedia \ndictates how to form a URI, which is the case of GET forms in HTML).\n\nIn contrast, the &quot;fragment identifier component of a URI allows indirect\nidentification of a secondary resource by reference to a primary \nresource and additional identifying information&quot; [1]. It is not actually \nused for dereferencing, so never seen by the server.\n\n[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5\n\n&gt;  &gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; You may be reading too much into this. Neither &quot;?&quot; nor &quot;#&quot; belong to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the HTTP layer. Those are part of RFC 3986, and the fact that browsers\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; don&#39;t send the part of the URI after the &quot;#&quot; separator to servers is\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; dictated by the media type (primarily the HTML family).\n\nAlthough what the secondary resource identified by the fragment depends \non the media type (once the representation has been obtained), I don&#39;t \nthink that not sending it is dictated by the media type.\nThe way I read [1] is that it should never be sent for dereferencing, \nirrespectively of the media type of the representations involved: &quot;As\n    such, the fragment identifier is not used in the scheme-specific\n    processing of a URI; instead, the fragment identifier is separated\n    from the rest of the URI prior to a dereference, and thus the\n    identifying information within the fragment itself is dereferenced\n    solely by the user agent, regardless of the URI scheme.&quot; [1]\n\n\n\nTo come back to the initial point (Google using \n&lt;http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=site%3Atech.groups.yahoo.com%20inurl:rest-discuss&gt;), \nthis seems to be relying on JavaScript.\nIf you look at what the browser does when you paste this URI in the \nlocation bar: it deferences &lt;http://www.google.com/&gt; (maybe redirected \nto &lt;http://www.google.co.uk/&gt; or similar) and obtains an HTML that \ncontains some JavaScript. Then, there is an automatic redirection to the \nURI with a question mark (which is the one that is actually used for the \nsearch).\nPresumably, if this redirection wasn&#39;t occuring yesterday, this implies \nthat an asynchronous request was made to populate the page with the \nsearch results (instead of just one when using the question mark).\nI think this is a trick that can also be used with GWT-based applications.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBruno.\n\n\n"}}
