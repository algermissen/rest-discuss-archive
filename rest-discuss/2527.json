IIRC, Basically Tim&#39;s position is that &quot;1&quot; identifies \n&gt; the HTTP resource (the W3C&#39;s web page) and &quot;3&quot; identifies the &quot;logical \n&gt; concept&quot; (the W3C). I believe that Fielding thinks that 1. identifies \n&gt; the logical concept and it is up to the identifying context to be \n&gt; explicit whether it is talking about a resource or a representation.\n\nTim&#39;s approach seems less robust, but the disagreement is really the \nproblem here, as if people publish RDF that makes assertions about the \nfollowing resources:\n\n\thttp://www.w3.org\n\thttp://www.w3.org/\n\thttp://www.w3.org#\n\thttp://www.w3.org/#\n\thttp://w3.org\n\t...\n\n...all of which will reach the homepage of the W3C (albeit possibly after\na redirect) and yet these are all syntactically distinct, so logical\nstatements involving one cannot be used in inferences involving the\nothers. Problem for RDF, no? And any other mechanism used to describe web\nservices that depends on URI syntax, which is why I mention it here. It\nalso brings up the thorny question or URI equivalence again.\n\n&gt; I tend to agree with Vincent that there is no reason in Web architecture \n&gt; to prefer 2. to 1. I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt to &quot;hint&quot; that the resource \n&gt; is a container. But if it isn&#39;t then it is especially annoying that it \n&gt; is difficult to leave off the slash in most web servers.\n\nAgain, the problem is more with the lack of consistency and the problems \nthat will create when exact comparisons are required.\n\nMichael\n\n\n"}}
