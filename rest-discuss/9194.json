If someone \n&gt; else thinks there was actually consensus on this point please let the \n&gt; AtomPub editor know about it.\n&gt; \n\nThere wasn&#39;t consensus on this point, but I for one continue to argue \nthat HTTP requires that a server that substantially changes a client \nrequest not return a 200 level response to a PUT. This is irrespective \nof what APP says.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
