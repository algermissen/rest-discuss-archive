Modeling a &#39;property&#39; as a collection that is URI\n&gt; addressable. Using POST to &#39;add&#39; to a collection (is that create+insert or\n&gt; just insert?).\n&gt; But how do people know that &#39;properties&#39; is a name (in the response headers)\n&gt; to use? Is defined by DAV or something?\n\nYep.\n\n&gt; How do people know &quot;;name&quot; is the format of URIs? Have you figured out the\n&gt; opacity issues?\n\nIt&#39;s on my todo list.  I haven&#39;t figured out &quot;;&quot; yet though, but when I\ndo I&#39;ll write up all my findings on &quot;?&quot; and &quot;/&quot;.\n\nRoy used that notation first.  It suggests to me that its meaning can\nhave a wider scope than just the URI to which it&#39;s appended.  If so,\nthat&#39;s pretty darned useful, though less opaque (which is ok, as long\nas its interpretation is uniform).  It appears to work like a HTTP\nheader.  But it is not itself a URI, so perhaps a registry is needed,\nor we can figure out a way of making it a URI.\n\n&gt; Given that the technology of the day (.asp .jsp) doesn&#39;t allow for &#39;extra\n&gt; path info&#39; you will see urls for properties like:\n&gt; http://www.clewless.com/monitors/subs.asp?customer=27\n&gt; \n&gt; Try appending &quot;;subscriptions&quot; on the end of that.\n\nI&#39;ve heard that deployed URI support is actually pretty good, except\nmaybe in some funky cases like http://foo.com/bar;q?a=b\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
