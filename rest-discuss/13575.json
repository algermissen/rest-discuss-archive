If I re-use the format and keep the content\ntype &quot;atom+xml&quot;, then client&#39;s wouldn&#39;t know my specific usage of atom\n(e.g. semantics behind some of my &quot;rel&quot; attributes).  I could, I\nsuppose, reuse the format but declare it under a new content type that\nimplies some semantics.  I suppose the concern is that by reusing a\nmedia type it takes some &#39;rel&#39;, request history, or other context to\ngive the client more information to adequately process it.\n\nA decent example of the dilemma can be seen with opensearch&#39;s usage[1]\nof atom for results.   The links to rel=(next|previous|first|last)\naren&#39;t necessarily understood by knowing atom alone.  They have\nspecific might have specific meaning in opensearch&#39;s usage of those\nparticular rel values.\n\nSo is it silly to reuse a format, but declare a new ContentType as\nbasically a specific usage of an existing content type?  Or, more\ngenerally, how are people doing these things within your enterprise\n(where content type explosion seems to be worse than on the wild\ninternet)?\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n\n\n[0] - http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n[1] - http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_description_elements\n\n"}}
