Exposing the state of \nthe communication as a resource through a URI makes sense and will \nget me around the problem of the URI length restriction.\n\nWondering if you can recommend a primer document on HTTP, I&#39;ve \nreally only considered it in terms of GET and POST methods up to now.\n\nCheers\nAdam\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, sandeep@e... wrote:\n&gt; Hey Adam,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elimination of state management is one area I&#39;m uncertain about\n&gt; \n&gt; Try to look at state in a different way than you are used to on \nthe web so far.\n&gt; You could start off by reading this excellent document:\n&gt; \n&gt; A Web-Centric Approach to State Transition by Paul Prescod\n&gt; http://www.prescod.net/rest/state_transition.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m attracted to the simplicity\n&gt; &gt; of the REST style and the lightweight requirements it\n&gt; &gt; places upon its clients but am not certain that I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; fully grasped how to apply it to our particular\n&gt; &gt; service.  One of the recommendations I&#39;m having\n&gt; &gt; difficulty visualizing is how I can eliminate client\n&gt; &gt; session management.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST does not recommend that you eliminate client session \nmanagement!\n&gt; In the words of Roy:\n&gt; &quot;...communication must be stateless in nature,...such that each \nrequest from\n&gt; client to server must contain all of the information necessary to \nunderstand\n&gt; the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on \nthe server.\n&gt; Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This architectural choices has two design trade-off&#39;s:\n&gt; 1) &quot;...it may decrease network performance by increasing the \nrepetitive data\n&gt; (per-interaction overhead) sent in a series of requests, since \nthat data cannot\n&gt; be left on the server in a shared context.&quot;\n&gt; 2) &quot;In addition, placing the application state on the client-side \nreduces the\n&gt; server&#39;s control over consistent application behavior, since the \napplication\n&gt; becomes dependent on the correct implementation of semantics \nacross multiple\n&gt; client versions.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy goes on to say:\n&gt; &quot;Cookie interaction fails to match REST&#39;s model of application \nstate... As a\n&gt; result, cookie-based applications on the Web will never be \nreliable. The same\n&gt; functionality should have been accomplished via anonymous \nauthentication and\n&gt; true client-side state.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And here is what your looking for:\n&gt; &quot;A state mechanism that involves preferences can be more \nefficiently\n&gt; implemented\n&gt; using judicious use of context-setting URI rather than cookies, \nwhere judicious\n&gt; means one URI per state rather than an unbounded number of URI due \nto the\n&gt; embedding of a user-id.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In prototyping the current non-REST system we\n&gt; &gt; discovered several limitations related to the phone\n&gt; &gt; handsets:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Some handsets have a maximum URL length of 255\n&gt; &gt; characters.  Passing session state in the URL along\n&gt; &gt; with co-ordinate pairs frequently took us above this\n&gt; &gt; limit.\n&gt; &gt; - Cookie support cannot be guaranteed for the phone\n&gt; &gt; browser precluding the use of native session-tracking\n&gt; &gt; mechanisms on the server\n&gt; &gt; - Variations in WML rendering require document\n&gt; &gt; transformation to phone-specific WML if optimal\n&gt; &gt; presentation is to be achieved\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul&#39;s approach should get you around the first 2 limitations. The \nlast\n&gt; limitation that you mention is related to representations and is \nactully\n&gt; dependent on your application architecture.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sandeep\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
