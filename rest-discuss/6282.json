SSL/TLS are at the transport\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level. They don&#39;t affect application semantics unless you&#39;re talking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about authenticating with client certificates.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I don&#39;t code it, I can&#39;t see it happening.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my problem I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah right.\n&gt; \n&gt; You do have to recode both ends. Languages usually have a separate api\n&gt; for connecting to SSL/TLS services. Java has HTTPSUrlConnection for\n&gt; example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually the SSL/TLS versions are just copies of the normal HTTP versions\n&gt; and just as simple to use. On the server side you have to install a\n&gt; certificate but there are detailed instructions for doing that in most\n&gt; languages I&#39;ve used SSL/TLS from.\n\nNot really to take a job away from Nic (besides, you shouldn&#39;t be hiring\nhim to do just the SSL implementation part anyway... :), but here&#39;s a\nworking example that will do both 2-way SSL authentication and regular\nHTTP requests to the same service in C#.  Feel free to use the code.\n\nhttp://sdec.reach.ie/rigs/rig0007/code/client/dotnet/rrmtp-client.cs\n\nAs Nic said, both ends will have to be updated, and, depending on the\ncomplexity of your production environment infrastructure, your server\nimplementation may need to do SSL/HTTPS during development and not in\nproduction because a hardware accelerator may be used for SSL\ntermination.  It just depends.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nast\n***************************************************************************************************\nThe information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged Access to this email by anyone other than the intended addressee is unauthorized.
