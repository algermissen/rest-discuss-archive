If this is really \n&gt; accepted common wisdom, almost all examples of RESTful apps I&#39;m aware \n&gt; of, and most articles (including e.g. the excellent one at http:// \n&gt; www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/01/restful-web.html from Joe Gregorio) do \n&gt; not, in fact, describe RESTful applications.\n\nAgreed. The most precient example of a RESTful application at the moment\nis called the world-wide-web. If you have to write new client-side\nsoftware to deal with your new server-side software, you have failed the\nREST test. A generic browser with sufficient knowledge of standard verbs\nand content types should be able to access and interact with your\nRESTful service. Special-purpose clients can still be written, but they\nshould never be required.\n\n&gt; Or should we view REST as an ideal and a RESTful app as one that \n&gt; tries to come as close to it as possible?\n\nWe should leverage, replicate or integrate with the success of\nmicroformats in defining standard content types. Tantek and his\ncollaborators have been very successful in developing a model for\nstandard-building and also the practice of standard building. The model\nessentially amounts to:\n\n* Looking for existing formats that overlap the subject area you are\nattempting to standardise\n* Looking for already-published data (or perhaps software that already\nproduces data) linked to the subject area\n\nFind the closest match, and use that as your starting point. New ideas\nor requirements are largely ignored. Cover the 80% case and evolve\nrather than trying to dot every &quot;i&quot; all at once. Sort out an namespace\nclashes with previously-ratified formats to ensure that terms line up as\nmuch as possible and that namespaces do not have to be used. Allow\nextensions to occur in the wild without forcing them into their own\nnamespaces.\n\nGiven the success that microformats have already achieved, I would\nsuggest that directly copying their standards back into the XML world\nwould also be a viable standardisation mechanism. I have certainly been\nusing them myself as the guideposts to content-type development when\nhumans are not involved in a conversation.\n\nI don&#39;t know whether pure machine-to-machine information transfer is at\nthe tipping point that microformats have achieved yet. Microformats can\nsurvey a huge amount of html-encoded information and genuine experince\nin determining which existing formats are useful and which are chaff. To\ndevelop pure machine-oriented formats in the same way we would need a\nlarge base of nearly-restful services to look for commonality between.\n\nIf we are at the tipping point, a wiki, mailing list, instant messaging\nchannel, and community champions might be enough to get things going. It\nmight be useful to kick off such a community for problem domains that\nfall between the microformat cracks (Are there enough invoices on the\nweb yet for the microformats crowd to standardise the format?).\n\nCommunity-driven formats are probably the only real way to develop\nuseful ontology through content types. As such, the nearly-RESTful\nservices out there are still of benefit. So long as they migrate to a\nstandard once the industry they are part of starts to pick up, REST will\nbe the ultimate outcome. This outcome also has a name: The semantic web.\nRDF really isn&#39;t the cornerstone of the semantic web. RDF is too closely\naligned to artificial intelligence and high ideals as to how information\ncan be reasoned with generically to be really useful as an information\nexchange mechanism. The semantic web is here, however, today. A content\ntype is an ontology, and we already have good experience with some very\npopular and useful ontologies. Perhaps there are already enough web\napplications today with nearly-RESTful APIs that standardisation based\non actual use may be viable.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
