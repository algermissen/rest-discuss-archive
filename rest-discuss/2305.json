This will be even more the case when the \n&gt; &quot;negotiators&quot; are\n&gt; computers and where the negotiations cannot be used as hints towards\n&gt; human intent. Computers will also tend to use predefined contracts\n&gt; because they aren&#39;t smart enough to write their own. \n&gt; Therefore the most\n&gt; relevant question will often be: &quot;Did you really agree to this\n&gt; predefined contract or not?&quot;\n\nWe&#39;re not disagreeing here.  What I meant is that the harder part of\ntheir job is deciding what constitutes the contract, and determining\nthat requires context outside the contract document itself, including\na certain amount of conversation.  But I agree that the focus is on\nthe final contract, i.e. what in their judgment constitutes that.  That\n&quot;did you really agree?&quot; stuff may depend on what was said before the\nsigning.\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
