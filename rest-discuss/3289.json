Isn&#39;t that\n&gt; what the OPTIONS method is for?  Shouldn&#39;t you be able to do an OPTIONS request\n&gt; on the resource itself and have whatever meta information returned?  That way\n&gt; there&#39;s no need for two resources with links back to each other.\n\nInteresting idea.  RFC2616 is incredibly vague\nabout exactly how you use OPTIONS.  It is so vague\nso as to be unusable as is.\n\nThat being said, I like the idea of putting the\nmeta-data in OPTIONS.\n\nPerhaps we can define a convention here about the\nheaders and body of an OPTIONS response so as to\nmake interoperability easy.\n\nHere is the information it would be nice for the\nserver to be able to send:\n* Allow: methods\n* Content-Types: available via content-negotiation\n* Accept-POST: content types\n* Accept-PUT: content types\n* Accept-PUT-Charset:\n* Accept-POST-Charset:\n* Accept-PUT-Encoding:\n* Accept-POST-Encoding:\n* Accept-PUT-Language:\n* Accept-POST-Language:\n* WWW-GET-Authenticate:\n* WWW-POST-Authenticate:\n* WWW-PUT-Authenticate:\n\nMy strawman proposal is that the server sends a\n200 OK with these headers in response to an\nOPTIONS request.  Content-Types would have the\nsame format as Accept.\n\nAn alternative for all the method specific headers\nwould be to use the non method specific versions\nof each of these headers with a method=METHOD\nparameter.\n\nThoughts?\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
