You talk about the design\n&gt; decisions in Plan9 or ReiserFS\n\nReiserFS isn&#39;t a distributed filesystem at all.  The lessons from ReiserFS involve\nembedding semantics in names, not issues of distribution.  Plan 9 has (some might say\nis) a distributed &quot;file&quot; system, but it&#39;s so idiosyncratic that it&#39;s not a good\ncomparison, here.\n\nMy point in bringing up different filesystems is to help &quot;you&quot; (or the otherwise\ndogmatically-afflicted ;-) remedy your misunderstanding that the Web is somehow\ndifferent from all filesystem-oriented efforts.  There&#39;s not a single high-level\narchitectural characteristic of the Web that isn&#39;t present in some other filesystem\neffort, distributed or local.  (There are admittedly none that have *all* those\ncharacteristics.)  There&#39;s *no good reason* to believe that there&#39;s any single thing\nunique about the Web beyond its default and de facto hypermedia interface and the\nsynthesis it achieves of all its features.  Given the similarities, IMO it&#39;s fair to\ndraw lessons from any / all filesystems which share some characteristic, goal, or what\nhave you with the Web.  Categorically stating that lessons learned elsewhere aren&#39;t\napplicable to the Web because it&#39;s special (when it isn&#39;t) smacks of a kind of\ntechnological provincialism that&#39;s frustrating.  We should be proud of the Web.  We\nshouldn&#39;t be too proud of ourselves. ;-)\n\nLet me be clear about my claims:  after a fair bit of thought, I&#39;ve concluded that the\nstrictest statements and interpretations of the Opacity Axiom may be a mistake caused by\novergeneralization from early historical problems in the Web&#39;s development.  To the\nextent that it has nothing to say contrary to my following assertions, then I&#39;m\ngenerally fine with it:\n\n  * URI should be constructable by human or machine\n  * URI should be meaningfully deconstructable by human or machine\n  * URI designers should be encouraged to build meaningful namespaces\n\n&gt; Yes, if you take the union of all features of all file systems and pick\n&gt; and choose then you may get something that looks like the Web. But if\n&gt; you want to claim that the Web should learn from the design decisions\n&gt; made in file systems then you have to choose one or two logically\n&gt; similar file systems and demonstrate that the problem domain is similar.\n\nWell, that&#39;s rather silly, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s like saying &quot;tell me everything you know\nabout numbers.  You may only use the number 2.&quot;\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve not noticed that SMB/CIFS use semantically meaningful names much\n&gt; other than lpt1: so I don&#39;t see how they are relevant to your argument.\n\nIf my CIFS home directory contains, say, &#92;&#92;someserver&#92;jbone&#92;mail&#92;archive&#92;FoRK&#92;1999 then\nthat name is indeed semantically meaningful, and its possible that both humans and\nsoftware might be able to make some deductions about what other names exist in that\nhierarchy.  Particularly if I give them some guidance on the semantics and generative\ngrammar of that naming scheme as it relates to my information organizational structure.\n\n&gt; In fact, the Windows operating system encourages application designers\n&gt; to dereference names through the registry and ignore the actual file\n&gt; names.\n\nYes, and what a good idea that turned out to be. ;-)  Contrast this with systems where\ninstalling an entire piece of software is simply a matter of unpacking a tarball in a\ndirectory.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
