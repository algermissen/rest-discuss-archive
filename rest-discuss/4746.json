It would be more  \naccurate to say\nthat some people insisted HTTP could not carry internationalized data in\nheader fields (which is blatantly false -- it is only inconveniently  \nencoded),\nand thus spawned an incredibly convoluted XML format for properties,  \nwhich\nlater got boiled down to name-value pairs (like all metadata systems).   \nDASL\ngot invented because an XML search interface was needed to deal with  \nthe complex\nproperties, but was later dropped due to lack of interest in a  \nhalf-assed\nvariation of what the real database people were working on with XQuery.\n\nThe issue of identification started because of a really bad paper tiger  \ndesign\nfor munging URIs that was proposed by someone else, rejected, and then  \nreplaced\nby me during a meeting at Xerox PARC with the imagemap-style URI  \nprovided\nby the server.  Larry did not object to that style of munging.  The  \ndesign was\nnot used by WebDAV because the editors chose not to for some unknown  \nreason,\nnot because there was any objection from the working group (on the  \ncontrary,\nboth Henrik and I objected to the extra methods).  All of that nonsense\nabout extra round-trips is just bullshit invented by Yaron --  \nMicrosoft&#39;s own\nimplementations had no such concern for round-trips and actually made  \ntwo\nunnecessary requests prior to each WebDAV resource action just to check  \nif it\nwas actually WebDAV-enabled.\n\nWebDAV is stuck with that design because we let Microsoft dominate the\nworking group as the only significant implementation.  Apache&#39;s mod_dav\ndidn&#39;t come along until much later.  Henrik&#39;s implementation in libwww,\ncompleted during the HTTP/1.1 design, was ignored because it didn&#39;t use  \nXML.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
