Yes, they may have mostly the same \n&gt; &gt; content but they have different breadcrumbs which mean one can&#39;t be \n&gt; &gt; cached and served for the other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just because you navigated to a location circuitously doesn&#39;t \n&gt; mean you&#39;d want to see that path reflected in your \n&gt; breadcrumbs. You probably want canonicalized breadcrumbs. You \n&gt; have a back button if you want to retrace your steps; you \n&gt; have breadcrumbs to navigate the site.\n\nTo paraphrase Dan Connolly, I think you and I are on different planets.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
