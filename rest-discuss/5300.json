Perhaps if I \nprovide an example of what I am trying to accomplish it might motivate \nthat discussion further.\n\nIn the system I am building there are a number of models that represent \nthe state of a system. I would like to be able to interact with those \nmodels in three different ways.\n\n1. As a service where the model itself can be observed and manipulated \nat the data level by other services, models and processing functions in \nthe system. Clearly an XML representation would be used for this level \nof interaction.\n2. As a web page so humans can view and manipulate the model via browser \ninteraction, therefore we are talking an xhtml representation of the model.\n3. As a web component that can be composed into a composite view (by \nanother service or web designer) with other model instances in the \nsystem. In this case I can imagine this representation being xhtml but \nit also be simply an image (e.g. graph representing the state of the \nmodel) or some other visual element that can be embedded in a web page.\n\nWhat I would like is a consistent interaction model across the 3 uses, I \nbelieve a RESTful approach can provide that (like things such as SOAP \ncan&#39;t - I&#39;ve tried) and so I would like to leverage the best practices \nfor doing this. I have no problem using content negotiation if that is \naccepted way to accomplish the requirements, I do tend to view content \nnegotiation as a feature that has not been developed in a consistent way \nso I tend to be fearful of going in that direction but hey I am fairly \nnew to all of this.\n\nthanks\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
