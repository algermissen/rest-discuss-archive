These tools help embed XML\ninto the world (people expect XML formats for everything) while not\nactually helping users once you get beyond the structural basics,\nunless they are knee-deep in application specific code (i.e. Ant-aware\neditors that know about property settings, targets, &lt;import&gt; etc)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem with RDF and its style of information architecture -\n&gt; it&#39;s being pushed on a world that isn&#39;t ready for it. It&#39;s not wrong,\n&gt; it&#39;s impractical. There&#39;s a hierarchy of needs, which for most people\n&gt; means that RDF can&#39;t be a practical concern right now. We have to more\n&gt; immediate, base concerns, like encoding, and tags, and addressing, and\n&gt; translations, and indexing, and term search, and malformedness. The W3C\n&gt;   missed this point for the better part of a decade, by assuming that\n&gt; syntax didn&#39;t matter, whereas for most people syntax is everything. The\n&gt; consortium telling developers in these times that syntax doesn&#39;t matter\n&gt; is like Marie-Antoinette telling people to eat cake.\n&gt;\n&gt; The web will evolve to support interlingua of the kind the W3C thinks we\n&gt; should have now;  the success of application protocols clearly indicate\n&gt; that  speech act style communications do work, and short of a paradigm\n&gt; shift, that suggests interlingua very likely critically important to the\n&gt;   future of distributed systems. But the future where they are generally\n&gt; available and used is years off. Broad use of horseless carriages\n&gt; implies a good enough road infrastructure gets built out in advance.\n\nIf you look at the current generation of languages, they can just\nabout handle hash tables, either in-language (python, ruby) or as\ngarbage-collected object types (Java, C#). Thats the limit of the\nlanguage&#39;s structure, or simple lists. The old sapir-whorf hypothesis\nkicks in and people stop trying to express things the language makes\nhard. Or they start off with simple XML and evolve it over time to\nsomething that represents a graph, without a graph centric data format\n(Ant build files, RPC/encoded SOAP, that new Systems Modeling\nLanguage, etc). From an RDF-purist perspective, this is wrong, but for\na developer, slowly evolving things, it works. What is more, being XML\nis a selling point. Whereas being RDF? Nobody cares right now.\n\nOn my todo list for the next few months is to do a better way of\npresenting test results; XML or XHTML under Atom is my likely choice,\nbut I may allow the jena team to propose an alternative if they can\ncome up with something that works. Where &quot;works&quot; doesnt just mean &quot;RDF\ninside an Atom feed&quot;, or even &quot;extensible representation of results of\ndistributed and cross platform tests&quot; but &quot;produces output that can be\neasily interpreted&quot;. Its a lot easier to tell people to pump stuff\nthrough an XSL engine or view in firefox than suggesting a\nfacet-viewer -even if the latter is more powerful.\n\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
