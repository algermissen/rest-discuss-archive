The definition could be extended to\n&gt;&gt; inc=\r\nlude that information, right?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, not if we&#39;re talking about REST&#39;s =\r\nuniform interface. =A0A generic\n&gt; description of rel=3D&#39;circle&#39; could conce=\r\nivably require a positive\n&gt; integer, but individual application domains mus=\r\nt still have a mechanism\n&gt; to delimit the value, i.e. declare a range of 4 =\r\n- 50.\n\nThose application domains can extend and/or over-ride the descriptio=\r\nn\nto suit their specific requirements.\n\n&gt; Declaring that\n&gt; range in the def=\r\ninition of the link relation limits the re-use of that\n&gt; link relation in o=\r\nther application domains, since it&#39;s application-\n&gt; specific.\n\nRight, a sys=\r\ntem-wide description of a rel will be more generic than an\napplication-spec=\r\nific one, extension is re-use.\n\n&gt; Such application specifics belong in hype=\r\nrtext, not link-\n&gt; relation definitions (which should strive to be generic)=\r\n.\n\nI think this might be based on unexamined suppositions.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; An XFor=\r\nms slider control can delimit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the allowable values and declare them to=\r\n be pixels, resulting in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; self-documenting API instead of an endpoint=\r\n dependent upon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out-of-band knowledge.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This would be a self-docu=\r\nmenting API to you, but not to the automated\n&gt;&gt; (m2m) client you build agai=\r\nnst it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be a self-documenting API for any user-agent which =\r\nunderstands\n&gt; the slider form control, I fail to see what bearing the natur=\r\ne of the\n&gt; user (machine or human) has on it.\n\nTo me, self-documenting mean=\r\ns clients interact with the application by\nintuitively comprehending the se=\r\nmantics and controls they are\npresented with as they are proceeding through=\r\n the application. So the\nquestion is; are machine clients capable of a leve=\r\nl of intuitive\ncomprehension to make these more complex form controls worth=\r\n pursuing?\nI&#39;m not sure they are.\n\nThe current available writing on machine=\r\n based form consumption seems\nto focus on the theoretical benefits without =\r\nactually demonstrating\nthe extent of change they can enable, in practice,  =\r\nover the\nout-of-band approach.\n\nThe question is not whether machines can or=\r\n can&#39;t interact with\nform-like controls, they can, it&#39;s whether doing so is=\r\n worth the\neffort or is prohibitively complex.\n\nI guess keeping consumption=\r\n of your application down by making it both\ntheoretically &#39;pure&#39; and prohib=\r\nitively complex is one way of dealing\nwith a scalability challenge.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nAn automated client is dependent on the knowledge you instill it with\n&gt;&gt; up=\r\n front which, from its point of view when interacting with the\n&gt;&gt; applicati=\r\non, is out-of-band.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You lost me there. =A0REST is the antithesis of =\r\nhard-coding such\n&gt; information into the client code.\n\nWhich part of the dis=\r\nsertation are you taking this from?\n\n&gt; If the range of 4 - 50 is baked into=\r\n\n&gt; the client code, the client can&#39;t adapt if the service modifies the\n&gt; al=\r\nlowable range. =A0If, however, this range is presented in a hypertext\n&gt; con=\r\ntrol, updating the service range from 4 - 50 to 4 - 25 won&#39;t break\n&gt; existi=\r\nng clients because this knowledge is presented in-band.\n\nThis is the wrong =\r\nway of thinking about this problem. In either case,\nthe automated client wi=\r\nll be fed an objective which included a\nnow-out-of-range value. The only ch=\r\nange to the client behaviour you\nare making, is that the client can use the=\r\n control to pre-empt a 4xx\nresponse and avoid making the request in the fir=\r\nst place. In both\ncases the automated client will still have to take some\np=\r\nre-established action hard-coded into it. That is the nature of\nautomated t=\r\nhings.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
