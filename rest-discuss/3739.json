This is a key part of the &quot;self-describing&quot;\numbrella.  As an example, if you were a party to the court action, then\nyour identity (via your name) on some document is likely relevant.  But\nthe colour of your hair probably wouldn&#39;t be (as an example of what\nmight be returned from GET on my URI).\n\nIn Paul&#39;s example there, if the state of the resource was important,\neven if it was believed static, it should have been included in the\ncourt documents by value rather than by reference.\n\nMB\n\nOn Thu, Jul 03, 2003 at 06:17:46PM -0700, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Paul,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I buy all that, and yet I still have an issue with Tyler&#39;s example\n&gt; &gt; of the bank account URI that identifies anyone&#39;s account at that\n&gt; &gt; bank, depending on who&#39;s fired up their user agent.  To me, the\n&gt; &gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\n&gt; &gt; has identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\n&gt; &gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\n&gt; &gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n&gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt;  &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I want\n&gt;  &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be dragging\n&gt;  &gt; any URI into court.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed \n&gt; messages_ into courts. Let&#39;s say you have a very precise (specific) and \n&gt;   URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation. \n&gt; Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed. \n&gt; The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it \n&gt; in the database. You&#39;ll be out of luck unless you saved a digitally \n&gt; signed message with the old value.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
