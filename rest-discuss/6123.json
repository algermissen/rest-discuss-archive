Do I just\ncall:\n        http://www.ex=\r\nample.org/my/directory/\n\nand hope that there is not any &quot;index.html&quot; file t=\r\nhere so that I can\nharvest the hyperlinks and look for those that start wit=\r\nh that URL?\nSurely there must be a better way?\n\n&gt; Yes. I&#39;m working on one a=\r\ns well where the meta data is communicated\n&gt; with JSON. I hope to make a li=\r\nnux implementation of the client. At the\n&gt; moment it&#39;s FUSE based.\n\nIs the =\r\nonline-storage system you are working RESTful?  And if so, would\nit be poss=\r\nible to get a temporary (1 week or so) test account to test my\nREST client =\r\nagainst it?\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve found\n&gt; http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/res=\r\ntlet/DirectoryRestlet.html\n&gt; very intuitive.\n\nQuite useful, thank you.  Alt=\r\nhough I am working on a REST client, so I\nwould need to find HTTP/XML outpu=\r\nt.  Do you know the output from this\nJava Servlet implimentation of REST is=\r\n similar to those used by RESTful\nonline storage services such as amazon?\n\n=\r\nThanks again for your feedback and thanks in advance.\nAlicia.\n\n\n\n"}}
