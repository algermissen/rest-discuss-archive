Yet, I need \n&gt; to customize the pages depending on dynamic content.  I&#39;m going to argue \n&gt; that cookies are a good way to do this.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, say I have a page displaying the weather.  When a browser GETs the \n&gt; page, I can deliver an HTML page that uses AJAX to retrieve the actual \n&gt; data, and fill it into the form.  I have maximized cachability, since \n&gt; the HTML page doesn&#39;t change.\n&gt;\n&gt; But how does this work when I have a user session?  Let&#39;s say I have a \n&gt; book site, and the user has a shopping cart.  Following John E.&#39;s \n&gt; subject-verb-object paradigm, the session is the subject.  The content \n&gt; changes according to the subject.  Am I doomed to just render all the \n&gt; content dynamically?\n&gt;\n&gt; One way to handle this is to use cookies.  The user GETs a generic \n&gt; shopping cart page.  The page contains JavaScript which retrieves the \n&gt; contents of the shopping cart, from a generic URL.  The response to the \n&gt; request for the shopping cart page does not depend on the subject.  But \n&gt; the response for the request for the contents of the cart relies on the \n&gt; cookie.  Thus the shopping cart page can be cached, even if the contents \n&gt; of the cart can&#39;t (and they&#39;re dynamic, so who cares).\n&gt;\n&gt; Can this be done without cookies?  Suppose I try to encode the session \n&gt; ID in the URL.  Then when the JavaScript retrieves the shopping cart \n&gt; contents, it must use a different URL for each session.  That means that \n&gt; URL must be written into the shopping cart page, which means the \n&gt; shopping cart page must be unique for each session, which means the \n&gt; shopping cart page is no longer cacheable.  Whoops.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone else agree with this explanation as to why cookies are \n&gt; valuable for cacheability?\n\nThis is all fine.\n\nAgain, I say there&#39;s  nothing unRESTful about cookies. It&#39;s putting a\nsession id in a cookie and hiding data in the session on the server\nthat&#39;s wrong.\n\nAnother way of doing this though is without a cookie. the user could\nhave a resource on the server:\n\n  http://store/nicferrier/cart\n\nand the client side AJAX could update that resource as and when I\ncheck things in and out of my cart.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
