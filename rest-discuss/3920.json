It just has to \nhave a clear meaning with respect to a POSTed request entity and a target \nresource.  Unless the client knows what it means for a request entity to be \na subordinate of a target resource it can&#39;t make a request for the server \nto do make it so.  Either it is making a request for something else, or it \nis making a request for something random.  The only way for the client to \nknow what it means for a request entity to be subordinate to a particular \nresource is for it to have a model of what the resource actually is and how \nanother entity can be subordinate to that resource.\n\nThe question on the table is how the client discovers this model.\n\nIf the client discovers this model via out-of-band documentation, then \nthere is really no reason to restrict the method name used to being POST. \nIf we have to learn about a resource specific definition of &quot;subordinate&quot; \nfor each resource, then we are better off proliferating method names and \nrelying on 405 (thank you Seairth for the correction) to tell us what is \ngoing on.\n\nQuestion for Seairth: Why do you insist on using POST?\n\nIf you do insist on using POST then implicitly you are saying that the \nclient can acquire this model from within HTTP itself (without reference to \ncustom resource APIs).  I think the only way HTTP provides for acquiring \nthis model is by the client knowing the content-type of the target \nresource.\n\nAlternative question for Seairth: If you do insist on using POST, how does \nthe client know what it means?\n\nYet another version of this same question: Can you give an example of how a \nserver could in theory return 200 and still violate the semantics of POST?\n\nIf you can&#39;t (if everything is permitted), then again why restricting \nyourself to this one method name.  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to proliferate \nmethod names corresponding to each service provided and use 405 to know \nwhat is actually available.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

For example, it is meaningful to\n&gt;&gt; talk about POSTing a log-entry to a log-file because we understand that\n&gt;&gt; log-entry can be a subordinate of a logfile (even if the log-entry never\n&gt;&gt; gets its own URI).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In contrast, I&#39;m still waiting for you to explain how an RNA notification\n&gt;&gt; is subordinate to an RNA inbox.  Is it subordinate &quot;in the same way that\n&gt;&gt; a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is\n&gt;&gt; subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n&gt;&gt; subordinate to a database?&quot;  Unless you define what an inbox is, you\n&gt;&gt; can&#39;t really POST to it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And, my more general point is, once you define what an inbox is, you\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t need specifically to document POST as it is defined entirely by the\n&gt;&gt; semantics of RFC2616 and your definition of an inbox.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt;&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no way to violate the semantics of POST under this\n&gt;&gt; interpretation\n&gt; ;\n&gt;&gt; it has no meaning.  If POST means nothing in particular, why not use\n&gt;&gt; another verb name?  At very least, you could then use 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED\n&gt;&gt; to determine whether or not the resource has the behavior you expect from\n&gt;&gt; your method.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; S.

For reference (RFC2616 9.5):\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     The POST method is used to request that the origin\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     new subordinate of the resource identified by the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Note that this does not say that the request entity is a &quot;subordinate\n&gt;&gt; &gt; resource&quot;.  It only says that it is &quot;a new suboridnate of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; resource&quot;. Though some may disagree, that&#39;s a world of difference.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; POST never once claims that the request entity is a resource.  All it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; claims is that the target resource can make a resource out of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; request entity.  This is evident by the variety of functions that POST\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can handle:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Annotation of existing resources;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;       mailing list, or similar group of articles;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Providing a block of data, such as the result of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;       submitting a form, to a data-handling process;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     - Extending a database through an append operation.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Make special note of the third example.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, the POST definition also says:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     The actual function performed by the POST method is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     determined by the server and is usually dependent on\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     subordinate to a database.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; When trying to clarify what the definition means by &quot;subordinate&quot;, it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; focuses on easily visualizable concepts where &quot;subordination&quot; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; already\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; well-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that the request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; way around. A record cannot insert itself into a database, the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; database must insert a record into itself.  The same can be said for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; file/directories and articles/newsgroups.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; itself treat the request entity as a resource.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     The action performed by the POST method might not\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     appropriate response status, depending on whether or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     not the response includes an entity that describes\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     the result.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also,\n&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; would argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; response, but that&#39;s a minor issue.)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And the last relevant part of the specification is:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     If a resource has been created on the origin server,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     an entity which describes the status of the request\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     and refers to the new resource, and a Location header\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     (see section 14.30).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; resource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; definition, the response entity is the &quot;status&quot; of the request, not a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; representation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even\n&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST\n&gt; itself\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is still nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other words, the response is still just the output of the target\n&gt; resource\n&gt;&gt; &gt; function based on the input.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And that&#39;s it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; additional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\n&gt;&gt; &gt; directories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; accept POST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.  Boring, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; quite useful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
