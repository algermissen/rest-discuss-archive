You can send &quot;request data&quot;.  The data may\neither\n&gt; &gt;have a specific meaning (e.g. PUT of a resource state) or not (e.g.\nvarious\n&gt; &gt;uses of POST), but it isn&#39;t a representation.  A representation (in the\n&gt; &gt;context of this discussion) can only exist as it relates to a resource.\n&gt; &gt;Only the server has resources and only the server returns representations\nof\n&gt; &gt;those resources.  I think...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes, you do send representations in PUT and POST.  The &quot;Transfer&quot; in\n&gt; Representational State Transfer is not just for responses - it also\n&gt; applies to requests.\n\nThis makes no sense to me.  What is a request entity a representation of?\n\n&gt;  A PUT request contains a representation of the\n&gt; resource you want to store at the specified URI.  And according to Mark\n&gt; B., the representation transferred in the PUT is the same representation\n&gt; (bytewise) that&#39;ll be returned by a GET of the same resource (assuming\n&gt; no intervening state changes).\n\n&gt;From RFC2616 Section 9.6:\n\n&lt;quote&gt;The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\nsupplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing\nresource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of\nthe one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to\nan existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new\nresource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the\nresource with that URI.&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nI see nothing here saying that the request entity is a representation.  All\nthat I see is a request entity that may replace or create a new resource\nidentified by the request-URI.\n\n&gt; I would argue the same holds for POST.  A POST request transfers an\n&gt; entity to the server.  I don&#39;t see any reason not to consider that\n&gt; entity a representation of some (perhaps unnamed) resource. In fact, in\n&gt; some cases, the representation that is transferred will be GETable as a\n&gt; named resource once it is submitted to the server.\n\nI would be even less inclined to agree with you for POST.  POST only\ntansfers a request entity.  That&#39;s it.  Seeing it as a representation of an\nunnamed resource only make the REST model (as applied to HTTP) more\nconfusing to me, not less.\n\nThis would be an entirely different matter if the request also contained a\nURI that identified an actual resource that the request entity could be\nconsidered a representation of (sort of a PUSH usage instead of PULL).  But\nit doesn&#39;t.  Not even when using PUT.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
