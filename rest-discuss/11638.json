If s=\r\no how do you find that as the technical \naspects (caching for example) affe=\r\nct your resource design the two \nseperate?\n \nAlso how do you find this affe=\r\ncts aggregates, for example if you have \nFactFind entity as part of the Cus=\r\ntomer aggregate then when you PUT \ndoes the fact find controller load the C=\r\nustomer before updating it&#39;s \nFactFind?\n \nThe other issue I have is with se=\r\nrvices/factories, but I&#39;m thinking \nin those cases POSTing makes more sense=\r\n (the equivalent of sending \nthem a message).\n \n \n&gt; One thing that&#39;s worth =\r\ngetting right (albeit an impl relative to the\n&gt; network interface) is the r=\r\nepository pattern Evans talks about.\n \nYeah I fully buy into DDD and don&#39;t =\r\nuse the anemic repository \napproach.\n \n \n&gt; Partial updates are still a chal=\r\nlenge practically speaking; I&#39;m \n&gt; leaning towards forms POSTing directly t=\r\no the resource. \n \nThat makes perfect sense, would you recommend going a st=\r\nep further \nand posting to the aggregate root resource? \n \n \n&gt; I think the =\r\nMVC pattern will slowly replaced by &quot;View ORMs&quot; - \n&gt; Object Resource Mapper=\r\ns.\n \nSounds interesting, not really sure exactly what you mean though?\n\n\n"}}
