Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know enough about MIME politics to know\n&gt; &gt; the correct answer to whether you proliferate MIME\n&gt; &gt; types (per se) or simply add a version parameter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My point is simply that MIME provides the OBVIOUS\n&gt; &gt; and traditional mechanism for solving this\n&gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Better to fix MIME implementations, than to create\n&gt; &gt; an entirely new mechanism for content-type.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree.  To that end:\n&gt;\n&gt; I propose the addition of a new MIME subtype to each of the 8 existing\n&gt; media-types.  The name of the subtype will be &quot;type-uri&quot;.  The type will\n&gt; have a single required parameter &quot;uri&quot;, whose value is a URI.  The complete\n&gt; media type (including URI) will identify a specification.\n&gt;\n&gt; The following limitations are placed on the URI (yes, Joe.  I know I&#39;m\n&gt; wading into those murky waters.  &lt;g&gt;) :\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Creation rules of a new URI *must* be according to the scheme used.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) The URI *must* be compared at the octet level.  As a result, creators of\n&gt; new URIs should be very careful about the characters they use to ensure\n&gt; maximum compatibility (e.g. do not use characters that may need escaping in\n&gt; some instances).  This also means that URIs are case-sensitive.  I realize\n&gt; that some schemes are case-insensitive, but require a case-sensitive version\n&gt; of the URI to be used will not break those schemes.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) If the scheme used has any form of dereferencing, then the URI *must* be\n&gt; dereferencable and *should* dereference to details about the associated\n&gt; specification.  Since it is not possible to guarantee that a URI will be\n&gt; dereferencable at all times (e.g. network or server outages), recognition of\n&gt; the MIME type *must* not rely on the ability to derefence the URI.  For this\n&gt; purpose, the URI must be recognized as nothing more than an octet string.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) It is strongly recommended that a dereferencable URI point to an entity\n&gt; describing (or otherwise directing the user to) the associated\n&gt; specification.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s it really.  I&#39;m sure there are all sorts of unanswered... umm...\n&gt; questions.  So let&#39;s here them.  If you have a better suggestion for the\n&gt; subtype name, let&#39;s here that too.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
