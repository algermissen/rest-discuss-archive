Ofcourse, having a code\n&gt; that matches with your resources is probably much simpler and we don&#39;t\n&gt; want to make the systems any harder than they are. But when you are\n&gt; talking about REST, what code is present in the server doesn&#39;t really\n&gt; matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess I might be confused by what you mean by server side classes -\n&gt; obviously the code that actually handles the request will be very\n&gt; different for WS-* and REST, but if both want to achieve the same\n&gt; thing (say mailing a book) then why can&#39;t both have the same code\n&gt; underneath ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan said :\n&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t want to bog down into implementation details, to be honest. I\n&gt;&gt; will be talking about the importance of media-types and the use of\n&gt;&gt; Accept* for conneg, but not as a Fallacy / Fact thing - just\n&gt;&gt; commentary.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually , we should all just ping Roy and ask him to just write down\n&gt; his famed chapter on media types. ( that he couldn&#39;t write because of\n&gt; the hard deadline of his thesis)... maybe a new thread on rest-discuss\n&gt; is warranted?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have to admit that I have always found POST slightly annoying. I\n&gt;&gt; understand why it fulfills the catch-all MISCELLANEOUS role but it\n&gt;&gt; provides a refuge for scoundrels too often (imho). How can you have\n&gt;&gt; &#39;universal semantics&#39; for a method that is semantically meaningless by\n&gt;&gt; definition?\n&gt;\n&gt; You should read and point people towards Roy&#39;s post on rest-discuss -\n&gt; &quot;Rest is not file storage&quot; deploring how everyone looks down upon\n&gt; POST. I think this is important cos most of the REST decks/articles on\n&gt; the net really do look down upon POST and Roy&#39;s POST levels the field\n&gt; a bit. (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10740). It\n&gt; might also help people relate to REST as an interface model (when he\n&gt; talks about UI) .\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;\n\n"}}
