Moving a vehicle from one fleet to another.\n&gt; You want to do this atomically so it&#39;s probably not good to do a\n&gt; DELETE followed by a POST. You would just have to POST an entity\n&gt; describing the transfer to some special &quot;transfer&quot; URI.\n\nHere, I think the answer is subtly wrong due to the question itself\ncontaining a subtle bug. The question assumes that it is meaningful to\nmove a resource from one url to another: that the resource has one\ncanonical name at one time and another at another time. However, cool\nurls don&#39;t change.\n\nThe question reveals a bug in the underlying URL-space. If it is\npossible for a vehicle to move from one fleet to another, then its name\nshould not include the fleet it belongs to. The fleet it belongs to\nshould instead be part of the content. That way, changing the fleet is\nthe same kind of operation as changing any other attribute of the\nvehicle.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
