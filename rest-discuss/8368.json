If the client isn&#39;t\na user-=\r\nagent, but is instead a knowledgeable actor in the domain, it can\nbe out of=\r\n place for the server to tell it what links to traverse, and\nwhat forms loo=\r\nk like, rather than the client just constructing the links\nand building the=\r\n &quot;form-response&quot; from out-of-band knowledge.
