I&#39;ve never seen even one.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, if I go to:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://api.talis.com/stores/bbc-backstage/services/sparql\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and enter the query :\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; select ?s where { ?s ?p ?o }\n&gt;&gt; limit 10\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; then click the &quot;Search&quot; button, I get a bunch of results in SPARQL\n&gt;&gt; results format.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Granted, that&#39;s what happens, but this is not REST.\n\nWhen the URI associated with a SPARQL query is dereferenced with HTTP,\na representation of the identified resource is transferred from server\nto client agent. What&#39;s not RESTful about that?\n\n&gt;&gt; Endpoints can be certainly conceptualised as a kind of RPC target,\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s what the setup provided at most endpoint URIs looks like: a\n&gt;&gt; form with a box for entering the query and a button to run it on a\n&gt;&gt; remote system. But this is misleading. The form box is really just an\n&gt;&gt; aid to composing URIs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it isn&#39;t.  When hypertext is the engine of application state, the\n&gt; form provides instructions for how to build URIs.  Foreknowledge of a\n&gt; query language is required to make use of SPARQL endpoints, this is not\n&gt; hypertext driving application state.\n\nIn this specific case it&#39;s just a difference in the user interface.\n\nHere&#39;s a URI:\n\nhttp://api.talis.com/stores/bbc-backstage/services/sparql?query=select+distinct+%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo+where+{+%0D%0A%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo%0D%0A}+%0D%0Alimit+500%0D%0A\n\nYour agent doesn&#39;t need any knowledge of SPARQL to use that any more\nthan it needs to know the BBC&#39;s URI construction system to use:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/classic-chandler/\n\nBut quibbling about this isn&#39;t very interesting. One interesting\naspect is that the hypertext part of linked data is qualitatively\ndifferent than that which we are familiar with in HTML.\n\nWhile :\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://danny.ayers.name/&quot;&gt;My Home Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand\n\n#me foaf:homepage &lt;http://danny.ayers.name/index.rdf#me&gt; .\n\nsay essentially the same thing, the latter (shorthand for\n&lt;http://danny.ayers.name/index.rdf#me&gt;\n&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage&gt; &lt;http://danny.ayers.name&gt; .)\noffers two extra opportunities for manipulating application state.\n\nSPARQL resource format is also hyperlink-rich (in fact CONSTRUCT\nqueries have RDF results), and I think we&#39;ve hardly started scratching\nthe surface of the potential.\n\nCheers,\nDanny.\n\n--\nhttp://danny.ayers.name\n\n"}}
