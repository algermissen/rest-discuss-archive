The processing is\nalso encapsulated as a REST resource, making use of POST to apply its\nprocessing to the data subset, identified with URI.\n\nNow, this all works fine if we consider all types of services residing\non the same server (or multiple servers with a common shared data access\nbackend).  The processing type resources take dataset URI as an argument\nin the POST or PUT, does its magic and generates URI for the\nnew/modified dataset.  However, what we would like to do is to have\nmultiple independent REST systems, possibly under different\nadministrative boundaries and domain names. The dataset resources can be\non a totally different servers / domains than the processing ones, for\nvarious reasons. Several open questions arise, like where the URI,\nresulting from the processing service should point, if the processing\nservice itself doesn&#39;t want to implement any of the data storage/access\ncapabilities itself?  What about authentication and authorization within\nsuch a system (centralized, federated )?\n\nWhile this is a typical scenario for SOAP web services, it seems we are\nhitting the limits of REST architecture here - having multiple\nindependent services, that we would like to access in an uniform way\nfrom a client. Quick search on REST services composition reveal this is\nindeed an unexplored issue, the vast amount of the REST talks only touch\nthe case of a single REST system.\n\nLooking for your comments;  is the above a scenario unsuitable for REST\narchitecture, are we doing something completely wrong, has anybody\nexperience with distributed REST resources, exposing the same API?\n\nBest regards,\nNina Jeliazkova\n\n-- \n---------------------------------\nDr. Nina Jeliazkova\nTechnical Manager\nIdeaConsult Ltd.\n1000 Sofia, Bulgaria\nTel: +359 886 802011\nICQ: 10705013\nwww: http://ambit.sourceforge.net\n---------------------------------                          \nPGP Public Key\nhttp://cert.acad.bg/pgp-keys/keys/nina-nikolova-0xEEABA669.asc\n\t8E99 8BAD D804 1A43 27B7  7F87 CF04 C7D1 EEAB A669\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
