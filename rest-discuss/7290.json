Can it be hosted somewhere\n&gt; &gt; faster? Who looks after it?\n&gt; Eugene Kim of Blueoxen hosts and maintains it, and helps me (and\n&gt; others) with spam cleanup.\n&gt; He mentioned to me that he might upgrade our software this week, but I\n&gt; haven&#39;t heard any more. I don&#39;t know if that will help with the speed\n&gt; problems you mention.\n\nOn the whole I think that RESTwiki is an underutilised valuable\nresource. I think that the current implementation is admirable and\nalready very important, but could do with some tweaking. I hope I am not\ntoo direct in listing a few issues i have the current implementation on\ntechnical and social fronts. I don&#39;t think I can solve any of the\ntechnical problems, but perhaps the social ones could be minimised by a\nbit more discusison and consensus among contributors.\n\nOn the technical side I see problems of\n* Availability from time to time (for example, it is timing out for me\nas I write this email),\n* Bugs and esoterica in the wiki software\n* An inability to upload images\n* No support for non-english users?\n* Doesn&#39;t look as good as wikipedia :)\n\nOn the social side I see problems of\n* A lack of overall structure and accessibility of information\n* Lack of separation between important concepts and side issues,\ngenerally a lack of focus for the wiki\n* Difficulty in coordinating users of the wiki\n* Overuse of jargon to introduce wiki linking\n* Lack of consistent editorial style\n* Unclear licencing. Is this all CC?\n\nPersonally, I like mediawiki. Whether a transition to that technology is\nfeasible or appropriate is I suppose a matter for Eugene. I think it\nwould solve some of the technical problems, and also assist in one or\ntwo of the social problems. Perhaps the biggest social advantage of\nmediawiki is the separate discussion tab available for each page. The\ncurrent editorial style reads far too much like a discussion between\ncontributors and far too little like straightforward practical advice.\n\nI would like to brainstorm a few functions of the wiki to help clarify\nits structure:\n* To establish the problem statement of REST, and why the problem domain\nthat REST applies to are not appropriately addressed in other\napproaches. ie, that REST is about defining a protocol environment that\nwill last for decades across loosely integrated components and scale\nboth technically and socially to the size of the Internet.\n* To explain the style through example and practical experience. This\ncontrasts with the from-first-principles view of REST that Fielding&#39;s\nthesis describes. I have put a few pages together on this front in\nlatter months of 2006.\n* To clarify common misunderstandings and elaborate on the dissertation\nwhere required.\n* To introduce and form a reference site for a small vocabulary that can\nbe used when talking about REST. For example the &quot;REST Triangle&quot; of\nnouns, verbs, and content types.\n* To help develop the style, for example by experimenting with new nouns\nor content types. In this way the wiki can act as a preliminary\nstandards organisation, especially for odd content types for which no\nobvious body exists.\n* To make clear that REST is backed by professionals who know what they\nare doing and can put together a wiki that gives users confidence in the\nstyle.\n\nI suggest that these purposes be reflected on the front page as\nsubheadings linking to relevant articles. The wiki contributors should\nbe prepared to cull old material that doesn&#39;t reflect the purpose of the\nwiki and produce new material as required to fill the gaps. Discussion\nand unnecessary jargon should be culled. All material should be\nuser-focused and relevant. All pages should be proof-read with the user\nin mind.\n\nREST shouldn&#39;t be an exclusive club, and I think the RESTwiki is the\nbest tool we have to make REST more accessible. As a wiki, it is easy to\nkeep up to date and wide-ranging. However as a wiki, it is hard to keep\ncorrect and focused. I think with a little more bold reviewing the wiki\ncould help us make some great headway.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
