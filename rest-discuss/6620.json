There shouldn&#39;t be any.\nThe difference should be expressed in the action (method) and the\nmetadata (media type), not by changing the content.  That is only  \npossible\nin a system that alters the media type based on the reason the  \ncontent is\nbeing viewed (i.e., the resource), which in turn is only possible if\nwe don&#39;t rely on a single meaningless media type for message exchanges.\n\n&gt; What problems does it cause with intermediaries to only specify the  \n&gt; low-level types (say, charset and the fact that it&#39;s XML)?\n\nIntermediaries cannot find the schema inside an XML body fast enough\nto keep up with Internet-scale systems, and even if they could that\nis not sufficient information to tell the system how the sender intended\nthe message to be interpreted.  The media type tells the recipient how\nthe sender expects it to be processed, not just what the format is.\n\n&gt; Indeed, what problems does it cause with a consumer of the XML,  \n&gt; assuming they can spot the schema on the first line and/or figure  \n&gt; out what they&#39;ve got by a little scanning around the elements?\n\nBecause if one component believes that &quot;text/xml&quot; messages are safe\nand another component believes that &quot;text/xml&quot; messages should be\ntreated like a dynamic invocation interface, then the only way to\nprevent a security hole is to block all XML content.  We have to all\nagree that &quot;text/xml&quot; will be processed in a specific, safe manner,\nand some dangerous stuff can be related to &quot;application/flash+xml&quot;\nand other specific media types.\n\nThat way we can make a conscious decision to block dangerous content\nonly when it is used in a dangerous way.  (Some people will block all\ndangerous content anyway, but that is a separate issue.)\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
