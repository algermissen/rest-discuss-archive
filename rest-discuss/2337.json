If we reexecute the sequence, the result of the second GET will \n&gt; have been affected by the first PUT ...\n&gt; \n&gt; ... but hang on a minute: that&#39;s _only_ true with respect to client- \n&gt; visible results. If we&#39;re only paying attention to the effects of the \n&gt; sequence on the server, then this sequence is perfectly idempotent, and \n&gt; any number of reexecutions will have exactly the same effect as the \n&gt; first.\n\nWell, an important difference between a sequence and an individual\ninvocation that I don&#39;t think you&#39;re taking into account, is that\napplication state is held by the client.  So between &quot;GET /foo&quot; and &quot;PUT\n/foo&quot;, the data being transferred may change.  For example, the client\nmay be incrementing a counter.  Certainly, from both a client and\nserver perspective, that&#39;s non-idempotent.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
