The problem with \n&gt;&gt;this approach is that I can&#39;t address representations of a \n&gt;&gt;resource, only a resource. What would you suggest?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d agree that Picture is the resource and that there can \n&gt; be two representations, the binary images and the XML/RDF.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can use content negotiation (i.e. the Accept header) to \n&gt; retrieve alternate representations from the same URI. But that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t address your addressing requirements. I&#39;d meet that \n&gt; by either: parameterising the url, e.g:\n&gt; \n&gt; /pictures/124?format=rdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Or by making the metadata a sub-ordinate resource:\n&gt; \n&gt; /picture/124/metadata\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been leaning towards the latter approach lately, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen both in use and I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much to choose between \n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can do this and STILL support content negotiation though, \n&gt; so it&#39;s not either/or.\n\nI just wanted to post the URL of my term paper[1].
