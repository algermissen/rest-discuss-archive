What idioms should I recommend to service creators so that their task is simplified and we can streamline their implementation complexity.\n\nSure, in terms of URI patterns the key &quot;idioms&quot; are derived from the\nlimitations of the hypertext in use. i.e. if your system is driven by\nhtml you should adopt the &quot;?key=value&...&quot; query part pattern it\nspecifies ( http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.1\n). In contrast a system revolving around hypertext types that use URI\ntemplates would be much more liberal.\n\nThe mapping of URI to Resource should be trivial - if unnecessarily\nspecifying URI patterns significantly reduces complexity then the\ntools you have probably aren&#39;t fit for purpose.\n\n&gt;&gt; The only benefit you will get from rules/convention like this\n&gt;&gt; is being able to establish a reusable library for routing on\n&gt;&gt; the server side a la Rails&#39; routing DSL - the benefit of which\n&gt;&gt; is questionable, and invites bad, non-hypertext practices on\n&gt;&gt; the client side.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand why such tooling would make any more or less likely to diverge from being truly hypertext driven.\n\nIf your clients become aware that you are using patterns and your URIs\nstart to appear more transparent to them; there&#39;s a higher likelihood\nthey will start generating URIs instead of just following the\nhyperlinks. I doesn&#39;t necessarily cause that behaviour - it just\ninvites it and makes it more likely to happen. Removing that potential\nis probably a good thing in a distributed system.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a common recurring pattern and not having to have N services solve it N times from scratch seems very beneficial to me in a company setting where time to deliver and the total productivity of the entire software development effort are key.\n&gt;\n\nSure. imo - URI patterns are not the right place to look for\nproductivity gains, beyond enabling the handling of patterns enforced\nby the hypertext in your system.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
