Bowman write:\n\n&gt;&gt; So yes, you&#39;re right, there is such a thing as URI fragment \n&gt;&gt; identifiers and they are indeed client-side.  But we aren&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; talking about them at all in this example. \n\nUh, beg to differ (and I do appreciate your help and I&#39;m sorry for being\npedantic, but...); these were the URLs we had as an example:\n\n http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16\n http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35\n\nThose follow the semantics of http fragments (i.e. id=&#39;attributes&#39;, not\nXPATH to element) AFAIU.  But my reason for being pedantic is to get to the\nbottom of understanding what can be done with HTTP given it&#39;s current\nimpementations?  According to WebArch[1], HTTP can&#39;t use fragment\nidentifiers for other than bookmarks.
