Here, since PNG is lossless, so there&#39;s not much of a compromise\n&gt; in place unless the client simply can&#39;t decode PNG (always possible).\n&gt;\n&gt; But then consider BMP vs JPEG. JPEG is lossy, but the results are certainly\n&gt; adequate for a lot of use cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider a low fidelity &quot;mobile&quot; representation. That seems completely\n&gt; appropriate, don&#39;t you think?\n\nYes that is a good example.\n\n&gt; And, of course, this is only for GETing representations -- this has nothing\n&gt; to do with PUT or POSTing representations. That&#39;s a completely different\n&gt; animal.\n\nIf for example PUT would need to be made on such resource, then I\nguess the client would need to GET the lossless representation first\non his mobile device before manipulating it with the user agent and\nsending the modified version to the server. In your case the use for\nthe lossy representation may be a preference. But there are case when\nuser agent limitation could not get around this. So it would have to\nPUT the lossy representation on the server.\n\n--Philippe\n\n"}}
