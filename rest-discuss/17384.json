I know it was designed for content management, but representations th=\r\nat include forms really could use versioning like this too, so that rigid u=\r\nser agents can have time to adapt.  They could bind against a specific vers=\r\nion, whereas a more adaptive user agent could always bind against latest-ve=\r\nrsion.\n\n&gt; on a similar track, iv&#39;e been toying w/ using the RFC 2119\n&gt; word=\r\ns\n&gt; (MUST, MAY, etc.) as a way to decorate hypermedia elements\n&gt; in a\n&gt; &quot;pr=\r\nofile&quot; that is consumable by agents. in theory (LOL)\n&gt; agents could\n&gt; compa=\r\nre their own &quot;design-time profile&quot; (indicating what\n&gt; that agent\n&gt; currentl=\r\ny supports) with the &quot;run-time profile&quot; provided in\n&gt; the\n&gt; response (@prof=\r\nile in the document, profile param in media\n&gt; type, Link\n&gt; header, etc.).=\r\n=A0 Mismatches could be handled by the\n&gt; agent as &quot;stop&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;warn&quot;, &quot;ignore=\r\n&quot;, etc.\n\n\nCool, reminds me of Telnet option negotiation: http://www.faqs.or=\r\ng/rfcs/rfc1143.html\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
