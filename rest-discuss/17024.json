Actually, in this model, the=\r\n  \n&gt; entries are the &quot;key&quot; resources and your &quot;content&quot; resources are  \n&gt; l=\r\ninked from the entries. Even if you don&#39;t use Atom, you could use a  \n&gt; mod=\r\nel like this. Arguably, an HTML-based wiki or content repository  \n&gt; uses t=\r\nhis model as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
